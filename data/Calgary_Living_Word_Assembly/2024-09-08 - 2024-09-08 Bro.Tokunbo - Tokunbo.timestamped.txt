[25:15] this
[25:16] opportunity to have it
[25:20] as that uh my last service will
[25:25] be at Calgary
[25:28] [Music]
[25:30] my first service I believe was at Le
[25:33] bridge and I have had one here I've had
[25:37] the privilege of
[25:40] traveling uh a few places in your
[25:43] country and I've have the privilege of
[25:46] sitting in the midst of rich men
[25:49] speaking the word of
[25:51] God and I've had the privilege also
[25:54] of Breen
[25:58] hearing the word of God from
[26:01] me this morning I first want to thank
[26:04] the
[26:06] pastor for the opportunity of preaching
[26:10] to service in your
[26:12] church the opportunity of being Pastor
[26:15] to a host
[26:17] of our family our
[26:23] Dynasty and also for supporting the leth
[26:27] brid church where also so I had
[26:29] opportunity to
[26:32] preach every family that has shown your
[26:35] love to me to our
[26:38] children I want to thank
[26:41] everybody something is unique in this
[26:45] assembly and that
[26:48] is what I design the
[26:52] Oneness the
[26:54] unity at least what man can see
[27:01] I want to thank God for
[27:06] that this
[27:08] morning
[27:11] I I'm going to
[27:15] speak to you as if I'm speaking to my
[27:17] home
[27:19] church because we are one in the
[27:22] faith one body one baptism one spirit
[27:28] because we are going the same way
[27:31] traveling the same
[27:32] way and we are supposed to be each
[27:35] other's
[27:36] keeper and we as ministers are supposed
[27:39] to
[27:40] operate within the Ambit of his
[27:44] grace and
[27:47] the anointing yes of the ministry that
[27:52] has committed unto us in the
[27:55] fivefolds and that if we love ourselves
[28:00] what we have to do is to help each
[28:03] other to fight the
[28:06] battle harder and higher amen and that
[28:11] is why I believe God has laid in my
[28:13] heart to ask us to
[28:15] study the
[28:17] message how can I
[28:22] overcome before we can
[28:24] [Music]
[28:25] overcome we have to
[28:30] know what we need to overcome
[28:36] right before we can
[28:38] overcome we have to know where we are
[28:44] at that is what we want to look
[28:49] at the title of the message
[28:52] is where are we
[28:55] spiritually amen where are we where is
[29:00] Cal Church
[29:02] spiritually where is every
[29:05] individual
[29:06] spiritually and I took that from the
[29:09] prophets in the seven Church which are
[29:13] you conversant
[29:17] with about P
[29:21] 36 the prophet
[29:23] said 96 of the old Salon book
[29:28] this is an 8 8857
[29:31] book so he said where where oh where are
[29:37] we
[29:38] spiritually he was talking of the church
[29:41] of his time he was talking of the pente
[29:44] of the time he said we are in a
[29:46] Wilderness of
[29:48] Darkness how far we have wandered from
[29:51] the first church of
[29:54] Pentecost the Church of Pentecost is
[29:57] nowhere in View and the word cannot be
[30:01] found that does not mean this local
[30:05] assembly it doesn't mean the bride in
[30:07] this real of the thought pool of the
[30:09] ministry of the
[30:10] Prophet it
[30:14] means those
[30:16] who may be hearing brother Braham may
[30:19] have heard him but they remained in the
[30:22] realm of the Pentecostal denomination
[30:24] right and we have had almost the on that
[30:28] have been here we have been hearing
[30:30] about the evil and danger of
[30:32] denomination that's right and the
[30:35] denomination simply means
[30:45] substitution denomination simply means
[30:51] substitution If the message says put
[30:54] this
[30:55] up and I put this up
[30:59] though they are papers white they have
[31:02] inscriptions on them I have substituted
[31:05] the
[31:06] message and the prophet of the Lord told
[31:08] us that substitution is not only as a
[31:15] group an
[31:18] individual can substitute the
[31:22] message a family can decide this is what
[31:26] we want to do despite the fact that the
[31:29] message said do it this way and also I
[31:32] want you to know that no matter how
[31:36] small no matter how
[31:40] little
[31:43] the thing is whether conduct whether
[31:47] order whether Doctrine no matter how
[31:50] small it
[31:52] is it will not go through the future of
[31:55] God right and
[31:58] as bright material
[32:01] amen if it does not pass as bright
[32:04] material it cannot pass as wife material
[32:11] right amen we are going to talk about
[32:14] those things
[32:17] this
[32:22] morning our scripture we are starting
[32:24] from numbers 13
[32:29] verse 20 and verse 21
[32:32] Numbers Chapter
[32:35] 13 Verse 30 and verse 31 we are going to
[32:40] see two
[32:43] accounts two
[32:46] groups and they are
[32:48] testimony of one
[32:50] message the testimony of one
[32:54] visitation and we are going to see how
[32:57] God dealt with them that is the way the
[33:00] unchanging God is dealing with
[33:04] us that was in the first
[33:07] Exodus this is the Third Exodus right
[33:11] and it is exactly the same thing in
[33:13] Ghana they will say the same
[33:17] thing that means that
[33:20] exactly
[33:22] s is the truth
[33:28] the national greed that is off I believe
[33:31] that God has a purpose in it because
[33:35] brother Brown says being spiritual we
[33:37] will
[33:38] see something that God is doing in every
[33:41] situation I believe that God is telling
[33:44] us by the national g that is off that
[33:46] our whole life at this time should be
[33:50] placed on the message of the hour
[33:54] alone every other thing will fail amen
[33:59] this is not strange to me at home we
[34:01] have the national g
[34:05] eratic but it's St to
[34:08] you God wants you to know that the only
[34:12] place that you can place your
[34:14] faith in this journey young and old is
[34:17] exactly 100% of what brother has told us
[34:22] not because it is brother Branham but
[34:24] because brother Bram is the voice of God
[34:27] to this last
[34:29] days Jehovah
[34:32] God enveloped himself with the body that
[34:36] we call Brother
[34:37] Braham Jehovah God impersonated himself
[34:42] in brother Braham it is not
[34:44] impersonating Jehovah Jehovah himself
[34:49] emptied himself can
[34:51] himself into that
[34:54] man and when his word is do say the Lord
[34:58] amen that you and I should know that
[35:01] what Jehovah demands from me is what
[35:04] brother has
[35:06] said may God help
[35:09] us numbers 13 Verse 30 and Caleb steal
[35:14] the people before Moses and said let us
[35:18] go up at once and possess it for we are
[35:23] well able to overcome it amen
[35:28] the second
[35:30] testimony but the man that went up with
[35:32] him said we are not able to go up
[35:37] against the people for they are stronger
[35:40] than
[35:42] we he looked at it with the eyes of man
[35:47] looking at man amen Caleb looked at it
[35:51] in the with the eyes of God looking at
[35:56] God David looked at Goliath with the
[35:59] eyes of God yes sir and he saw God
[36:02] overcoming
[36:04] him one
[36:06] failed one was
[36:09] accepted that is how our Jehovah father
[36:12] God is looking at every
[36:16] heart there's conduct there's order
[36:20] there's doct in the Church of the Living
[36:23] God and that's what makes up the
[36:26] Bible That's all that the message is
[36:29] that's why this book is a
[36:33] compendium of the of the message of the
[36:36] Prophet this is seven
[36:40] church we are going to read also
[36:45] from Ephesians
[36:48] [Music]
[36:50] 4 I trust God that I will not take your
[36:53] [Music]
[36:54] time because I know we have another
[36:56] program
[37:03] Ephesians chapter 4 from verse
[37:07] 11 and he gave some
[37:10] Apostles and some
[37:13] prophets and some
[37:16] evangelists and some
[37:18] pastors and teachers what for for the
[37:23] perfecting of the
[37:24] Saints they were Saints that's right but
[37:27] they must be perfected am that is not
[37:31] all for the work of the
[37:34] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[37:37] Christ or the building up the of the
[37:40] body of Christ my friend is looking at
[37:42] me and he knows that building is not
[37:46] just somebody coming somewhere and then
[37:48] put some gravel and then you
[37:51] go building has its steps it
[37:55] stages until the
[37:59] final stage is accomplished the building
[38:03] is not yet a
[38:05] building that can be
[38:08] accommodated remember
[38:12] that it goes on to say
[38:18] that for the edifying of the body of
[38:21] Christ till we we all we that is why I
[38:27] said I want to speak to you as if I'm
[38:30] speaking to my home Church am we
[38:33] all until my home church becomes the
[38:36] individuals of God in it
[38:39] become becomes the The Dwelling Place of
[38:42] the almighty
[38:44] God where he becomes one with him and
[38:47] one with each one and then one in calary
[38:50] and all over the nations of the world we
[38:52] are not going in the
[38:55] Rapture brother AB said that God Christ
[38:58] is not going home with a part of his
[39:00] body not
[39:04] there that is why it says Paul for
[39:07] seeing these things told us that it is
[39:10] till we all come in the unity of the
[39:14] faith it is not the unity of faith it is
[39:17] not my faith it is in the unity of the
[39:20] one
[39:22] faith we must be United in the one faith
[39:25] if the prophet says that this this leave
[39:30] must be like this in the Church of God
[39:32] if it's like this in my church it's not
[39:35] right and if Pastor Barry comes to our
[39:38] church being a faithful Minister he will
[39:41] tell us after the finance of everything
[39:43] everything well I'm going I'm going back
[39:45] to Canada we don't have eratic
[39:48] electricity there I'm going back to my
[39:49] country but he will say but
[39:52] please I noticed that this strand must
[39:56] be like this
[39:59] and if we are truly God's children we
[40:02] will tell we ask him where do you
[40:05] sit it shows us that this is the
[40:08] message we must the
[40:10] message that is our
[40:20] life because that's the voice of God
[40:24] changing from William Braham to bury
[40:27] Johnson
[40:30] we don't see like that that he wants to
[40:33] Wants to Rule us be and we throw it back
[40:37] we are throwing God away from our amen
[40:44] amen because it's not brother Barry it
[40:49] is the word of
[40:52] God they will all come to the unity of
[40:55] the faith and the knowled of the Son of
[40:58] God to a perfect manto the
[41:02] measure of a
[41:04] sture of the
[41:07] fullness of
[41:09] Christ it's not just coming to
[41:13] Perfection it is coming to the
[41:16] measure of the
[41:18] stature of the fullness of Christ and
[41:22] because we are all Bible readers you
[41:24] will know that Paul mentioned that full
[41:27] of Christ many other
[41:31] places coming to the sometimes you will
[41:34] say coming to a portion where we are
[41:38] [Music]
[41:39] blameless and that started from the Old
[41:42] Testament God's demand for his church is
[41:46] to come to
[41:47] Perfection Perfection of
[41:49] himself perfection in the states that he
[41:52] is because they are husband and wife
[41:57] yes from the Old
[41:59] Testament it could not be done here
[42:02] because the law cannot perfect anything
[42:04] because the blood of the Lord is the
[42:07] blood of goats and Bulls and Rams that
[42:09] is the blood of the Kingdom where we
[42:11] fell where our mother eve took us right
[42:15] we fell there and so their blood cannot
[42:17] perfect us that was why God had to come
[42:20] in his own blood amen and the blood is
[42:23] the bleeding bloody word hallelujah amen
[42:28] and everything that he says to us I'm
[42:30] sorry I'm shouting I'm shouting because
[42:32] there's no Nea sorry Nea is the nans are
[42:38] laughing there's no national g that's
[42:40] why I'm
[42:43] shouting the
[42:45] bleeding bloody words
[42:49] yes is what gave us this salvation amen
[42:54] that's why our men today are not in be
[42:56] Palace
[42:57] right that's why our women are not on
[42:59] the
[43:01] streets that's why we are not jumping
[43:03] and shouting and speaking in tongues and
[43:05] caros in the same church and we say we
[43:09] in church that's why we are decent
[43:11] people that we are we are made what we
[43:13] are because of the portion of the
[43:15] message that we believe
[43:19] Hallelujah there are message Believers
[43:22] so-call message Believers that are not
[43:24] like this right
[43:30] we are coming to the measure of the
[43:32] fullness of Christ amen that we
[43:35] henceforth be no more
[43:37] children because we are
[43:41] growing we are moving to a Perfection we
[43:46] are moving to the fullness of
[43:49] Christ there's a growth yes sir let me
[43:53] give you a
[43:55] testimony by the grace of God have
[43:57] finished my
[43:58] studying over and over and over and over
[44:00] but this
[44:02] morning I I first strongly to listen to
[44:06] the
[44:07] message God's being
[44:11] misunderstood that brother Brown would
[44:13] say when he was preaching the seals that
[44:16] if the angel didn't come I would have
[44:19] said something wrong if I didn't read
[44:21] that Salon book this morning if I didn't
[44:24] listen to that Salon book this morning I
[44:25] would have said something wrong
[44:31] I pre that salmon I've looked at it over
[44:34] and over I've answered questions with it
[44:37] over the years but my my my
[44:41] thinking about one thing I want to talk
[44:43] about was C I don't know why but God had
[44:47] to take me to listen to that and when I
[44:50] listen to it all my thoughts frizzled
[44:54] away they must frizzled away because the
[44:57] master is
[44:58] talking the Lord has
[45:01] spoken what I thought was right the
[45:04] master said it's
[45:07] wrong and that was what I was thanking
[45:10] God for in pastor's room that if God
[45:13] helped me to see that it was a prage
[45:18] that I believe that God will also help
[45:20] me to see what he will present to us am
[45:25] and then all will be well
[45:27] am Paul says but
[45:32] speaking the truth in
[45:35] love we may grow up into
[45:40] him in all
[45:45] things from our inside to our outsides
[45:49] right from our feet to our
[45:53] head from our legs the tip there to the
[45:56] tip here you remember in the holy of
[45:58] holies the tip of one k must touch the
[46:01] wall the tip of the other must touch the
[46:04] second and the same thing there and they
[46:06] must look to each other yes sir because
[46:09] they are guiding angel of of
[46:13] Jehovah and the the the the the the Mery
[46:16] seat will be here we are doing the same
[46:19] thing it must be exactly the same amen
[46:23] because we are here for him the prophet
[46:26] said the Bride on Earth is the strength
[46:29] of God on
[46:32] Earth in other words the way God wants
[46:37] to appear to people will be represented
[46:40] in my sister and my sister and my and
[46:44] everyone the way he wants to be seen on
[46:47] Earth today under the BR po
[46:51] Ministry yes the final pool amen the
[46:56] pool of the manifestation of the
[46:59] world what we have accumulated from the
[47:02] first po second P 33 63 until 65 and it
[47:06] went and then the the churched groping
[47:10] in darkness and what they don't know not
[47:12] darkness of Darkness but the darkness of
[47:14] their mind they don't know what's
[47:15] happened when brother left the bre in
[47:18] America they don't know what happened
[47:20] what we
[47:21] do the man that they have always looked
[47:24] at is gone what are we going to do then
[47:27] they also now
[47:30] started growing from the
[47:33] message right the Lily growing from the
[47:38] M
[47:40] struggling the way God say to be that is
[47:43] the nature that God has compelled on it
[47:47] it must struggle it must fight and it
[47:51] must the figh and then when it gets to
[47:56] the water up in the water then it shows
[47:58] you and I the glory that God has
[48:01] inherent
[48:02] Glory the inherent glory god now brings
[48:06] it out and it is beautiful to our eyes
[48:09] beauty is in the eye of the
[48:12] beholder it doesn't Reon to us as bad it
[48:15] reckons to us as
[48:17] beautiful the Beast will come they will
[48:20] do have their parts
[48:23] the the the the the the the the Young
[48:27] and a young woman I want to give
[48:29] themselves go call their por and give
[48:32] this is my all
[48:36] my but it
[48:39] struggles it
[48:40] overcame to come to that when it is that
[48:44] that is when we can call it
[48:47] lily flower
[48:50] right it's showing God's glory you and I
[48:56] are to show God's
[49:00] strength God's
[49:02] Beauty as a branch from the vine tree of
[49:05] God Amen that is why these men were
[49:08] anointed to speak these things to us and
[49:11] God brought brother Braham open them and
[49:14] as we studed them they unfold and the
[49:17] prophet said when the word unfolds the
[49:21] bride also will unfold amen because the
[49:24] word is the food of the Bride
[49:27] right that is why he does not only wash
[49:31] us from inside to outside he also washes
[49:34] us from outside to
[49:37] inside from up to down and down to up
[49:40] you remember when he built the uh Moses
[49:44] Temple when he was given the
[49:46] specification to Moses he started from
[49:49] outside to inside then he told him the
[49:52] same thing inside outside to inside
[49:54] inside to outside that's why is doing
[49:57] with us so that we will measure Our
[50:00] lives our
[50:02] spirituality by his word using his word
[50:06] as plumbline as ytic as pattern as
[50:11] standard of our very being amen amen
[50:15] amen in everything
[50:18] amen and what is what
[50:20] succeeds in
[50:22] fullness he will present to this world
[50:26] Mystics
[50:27] exactly right amen
[50:31] paradoxes the Power House of
[50:34] God where God can and say
[50:38] Daniel brother didn't understand what is
[50:41] do this
[50:43] just that brother understands am because
[50:47] that God is fully formed in brother
[50:51] Daniel God has so much confidence in
[50:54] brother Daniel that he will didn't do
[50:57] otherwise because he himself had worked
[51:00] upon him how by the
[51:05] words at his
[51:11] spirits speaking the truth in love may
[51:15] grow up into him in all things which is
[51:19] the head even
[51:22] chrisis you see Paul repeating growing
[51:26] growing
[51:27] into him growing that's our life
[51:32] amen I will also read lastly Mark
[51:36] 16 to see when we are Overcomers what
[51:40] will be in our midst or what must be in
[51:45] our
[51:46] midst what must be in our midst because
[51:50] our God wants to show
[51:53] himself t
[51:56] C assembly C living what
[52:01] assembly must not only gather
[52:05] as a unit amen but must gather as a
[52:11] power house where from the neighborhood
[52:14] God will send people to
[52:17] you from the from within us God will
[52:20] raise somebody up and say go to the
[52:23] street that is very far from here
[52:25] somebody's there
[52:27] he has this problem take Pastor they
[52:30] want you to pray for them pray for them
[52:33] that what supposed to be when the bread
[52:35] has become the wife of the
[52:39] Lamb so you see how
[52:43] far I am supposed to be how far I I'm
[52:48] still from where I'm supposed to
[52:53] be but he has made a way we will see
[52:55] that he made the way in the commission
[52:58] that he gave to us to go and tell he
[53:01] already put everything in his position
[53:05] it's our duty to open up in our
[53:08] dedication and our surrender and our
[53:10] consecration to open up to him so that
[53:13] he can use the
[53:15] Avenues of his glory The Avenues of his
[53:19] attributes if they are no sick we can
[53:21] never know him as
[53:24] Jehovah if we don't have we can never
[53:27] know him and if we are sick and we don't
[53:30] go to him even though we be Believers he
[53:33] can never manifest
[53:35] himself the prop pre the message the
[53:38] presence of God
[53:41] unrecognized the presence of God is
[53:44] there but if it is not recognized if
[53:47] it's not called to come and dwell with
[53:49] me if the disciples didn't tell him at
[53:52] that day Lord care not that we perish
[53:55] yes sir he will not come up the Sheep
[53:59] will not capsize yes sir but he will not
[54:01] come up but when they woke up from all
[54:04] their human
[54:06] efforts
[54:07] [Music]
[54:08] amen isn't he in his ship with
[54:12] us let go wake him up it is his duty to
[54:16] take care of
[54:18] us and he
[54:20] came peace be still amen and the storm
[54:25] was over yes Amen in the distress of
[54:29] David when Israel
[54:32] sinned and God allowed Satan to
[54:37] make Satan
[54:42] to walk on David David said go number
[54:47] Israel and said King live forever
[54:50] there's no need to number them Jehovah
[54:52] has already told us what will be he said
[54:55] who is King here
[54:57] are you the
[54:59] king sorry
[55:02] sir and then he went and numbered
[55:05] them and God had a prison against them
[55:08] yes sir he sent a plague on them David
[55:12] chose what he wanted I don't want to
[55:14] disuss myself before the Nations because
[55:18] David can never lose a
[55:21] war right if he has chosen to lose a
[55:25] war then
[55:26] the Ty would not be there right we must
[55:30] have the Ty so he chose God
[55:34] be and when God saw what was
[55:37] happening God himself said it is enough
[55:40] to that angel amen is
[55:43] enough and there was
[55:45] quiet and out of that church
[55:49] listen out of that seeming
[55:53] evil that was where Mountain Moria was
[55:59] resuscitated to take his position what
[56:03] happened in Abraham's time where Abraham
[56:07] took Isaac to to sacrifice him on that
[56:12] same Mountain it was owned at that time
[56:15] by a gentile but it was God's own eye
[56:19] the
[56:20] mountain the mountain top the mountain s
[56:24] in Jerusalem is the eye of God on Earth
[56:28] that's the center of the world that's
[56:30] the most important Landmark on the face
[56:33] of the Earth it was owned
[56:36] by a
[56:39] deite and God used David to claim it
[56:43] right the Temple Mount became where the
[56:46] temple was behind it was where he died
[56:49] as our
[56:51] Isaac it took that so correction is not
[56:56] not anything big in the Church of God he
[57:00] must correct us and we must to
[57:03] correction amen why does it correct us
[57:05] Paul told us in Hebrews it corrects us
[57:09] because we are his
[57:12] children it doesn't correct
[57:15] bastards if if even corrects them they
[57:19] cannot take they don't
[57:21] have what the we with to receive
[57:25] correction
[57:29] he says here in Mark 16 from verse 15 he
[57:34] said unto them go into all the world and
[57:37] preach the gospel to Every Creature he
[57:40] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[57:42] saved but he that believeth not shall be
[57:45] damned and these signs shall follow them
[57:48] that believe in my
[57:50] name shall they cast out Devils they
[57:54] shall speak with new tongues
[57:56] they shall take off serpents and if they
[57:59] drink any deadly thing they shall not
[58:01] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[58:03] sick and they shall recover amen so then
[58:08] after the Lord has spoken unto
[58:11] them he was received up into heaven and
[58:15] he sat down on the right hand all the
[58:18] power of
[58:19] God and they in cagri went
[58:24] forth and preach everywhere
[58:28] amen one two and the Lord who sent them
[58:32] to preach was walking with
[58:36] them and confirming the words not their
[58:41] own words but his own words amen with
[58:43] signs following him am let us start from
[58:47] there it is the duty of every individual
[58:52] believer brother says every individual
[58:55] believer to go and tell how you got
[58:57] saved yes
[59:01] sir a true testimony how many people are

[59:33] us if the go to TI go to is just any
[59:39] time all the men here that are not it
[59:43] people must go to
[59:44] them
[59:46] right that is how God is a god of
[59:50] details right he means what he says he
[59:54] says what he means amen and his own
[59:58] because they will hear
[1:00:01] him my sheep they hear my voice the
[1:00:05] voice of another they will not follow
[1:00:08] they will hear it a thousand voices
[1:00:13] brother says about the oncoming storm he
[1:00:16] said the uncoming storm is coming to
[1:00:23] everybody whether Believers or
[1:00:25] unbelievers
[1:00:28] brother BR says to us that every
[1:00:32] individual will be individually and
[1:00:35] privately
[1:00:38] tested not you but your
[1:00:42] faith the trial of our faith what does
[1:00:47] it mean the trial of your revelation of
[1:00:50] the
[1:00:52] message what is revealed to you
[1:00:55] everybody will hear
[1:00:58] it how is it revealed to you what does
[1:01:01] it mean to you amen what does it mean
[1:01:04] this verse when we read it in the
[1:01:05] scriptures what does it mean to
[1:01:08] me went forth and preached does it mean
[1:01:11] to me crowd of
[1:01:14] Believers if Pastor is not there Deon is
[1:01:16] not there TR is not there we cannot
[1:01:18] evangelize
[1:01:20] no no it's not that
[1:01:23] am he talking to the individual right he
[1:01:27] that has an ear let him hear what the
[1:01:31] spirit is saying unto the
[1:01:34] churches if you have read that book
[1:01:37] recently you see that brother brah
[1:01:40] stopped and emphasized that that command
[1:01:43] is not talking to the
[1:01:44] she the she is the church is the
[1:01:49] assembly he's talking to he who has ears
[1:01:54] he the indiv indidual am Brother
[1:01:59] Dan Brother Henry Don is not here I know
[1:02:04] that those words very well brother
[1:02:07] cap what does that scripture mean to
[1:02:11] you in your
[1:02:13] neighborhood with your
[1:02:16] co-workers it's not only in our lives
[1:02:18] that we will testify but we must talk
[1:02:22] right how do we approach them when we
[1:02:24] talk to them
[1:02:26] some people don't have not had this
[1:02:28] message before they baptized in Father
[1:02:31] Son and Holy Ghost they don't know
[1:02:33] better right they are children of God
[1:02:36] they are fine people but we know it and
[1:02:41] we keep it here or in our
[1:02:45] homes the way that
[1:02:49] c c gry I miss C gr with Calvary I
[1:02:53] should be very
[1:02:54] happy will miss your names with the
[1:02:57] place this is a place that is the
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:04] place the way to look at this thing is
[1:03:07] that this whole Bible is talking about
[1:03:10] me
[1:03:12] amen and how much have I done what he
[1:03:16] said he do if we don't go he will not
[1:03:19] follow us if he doesn't follow us we
[1:03:22] will not see the signs that are supposed
[1:03:24] to follow us
[1:03:27] and so if you go back to seven Church
[1:03:29] Ages page 250 we will see that he will
[1:03:32] not count our assembly as haven't grown
[1:03:36] to make
[1:03:37] it he will ask us questions when it's
[1:03:41] not that we not get there we'll get
[1:03:42] there but it will ask us question why
[1:03:45] did you not have this signs and miracles
[1:03:49] and wonders in your midst it's there you
[1:03:53] get there I think
[1:03:59] together we are to be here in his
[1:04:02] T we are to take his position that I'm
[1:04:05] quoting from that book we have to take
[1:04:06] his position on
[1:04:10] Earth what do you want to say about it
[1:04:13] what is your
[1:04:15] thinking about
[1:04:18] it if you enter into that by the grace

[1:04:59] we
[1:05:01] spiritually my my my my my subject is
[1:05:06] Overcoming By the word by the Holy Ghost
[1:05:10] baptism by
[1:05:12] sincerity correction and
[1:05:16] faith those who read that
[1:05:20] book that sermon will notice something
[1:05:25] that you must also look at
[1:05:28] properly you remember that brother
[1:05:30] Braham said at the beginning of that
[1:05:34] message excuse
[1:05:40] me he
[1:05:42] said it was supposed to
[1:05:45] be it was supposed to preach a
[1:05:49] a the Bible
[1:05:52] study Sunday School
[1:05:56] then he said he came back home
[1:05:59] late so he could not study completely
[1:06:02] study what he had in mind for that
[1:06:04] Sunday school he said but I had a
[1:06:09] brother
[1:06:10] spoke and from the notes I made from him
[1:06:14] I've taken this text to come and preach
[1:06:17] to you today look at your pastor is
[1:06:19] taking notes majority of this church you
[1:06:21] don't take
[1:06:23] notes it is a fundamental part of the
[1:06:27] ministry of the Prophet that it says
[1:06:29] bring your notes and
[1:06:31] pencils what is the reason he says when
[1:06:33] you get back home you will look at it
[1:06:36] you will pray over it you will study it
[1:06:38] if you don't do it you cannot the three
[1:06:41] cannot
[1:06:42] follow so you come to church on Sunday
[1:06:45] you listen to somebody oh it's great
[1:06:47] Pastor is great Pastor has done well
[1:06:48] today this and this and then you get
[1:06:50] home uh what we have gravy of this of
[1:06:54] salad of this
[1:06:57] in another 24 hours you have lost 50%
[1:07:01] of the third
[1:07:03] day V of it will
[1:07:06] remain but if you have your note which
[1:07:08] is following the order of the
[1:07:11] church it's an order it is not it is not
[1:07:14] a thinking it's not just brother
[1:07:17] suggested it is an order of the Church
[1:07:19] of the Living
[1:07:21] God because he wants us to grow what you
[1:07:25] have here in church is not
[1:07:30] sufficient your memory of what you here
[1:07:32] in church is not sufficient for the
[1:07:36] week if you don't do it you are not
[1:07:38] following the message
[1:07:43] totally the angel of the Lord will be
[1:07:45] here say these people are so
[1:07:48] disobedient yes that's what he will say
[1:07:50] remember what he told us the Tor in the
[1:07:53] home yeah he will go back to the father
[1:07:56] and say your children are so good they
[1:07:58] dress well to church the sisters are so
[1:08:00] beautifully dressed and this but God
[1:08:03] what we going to do for this people
[1:08:05] didn't know how to
[1:08:06] write don't they have papers in their
[1:08:08] schools in their in their
[1:08:11] homes didn't they read the prophets when
[1:08:14] you read that part of the
[1:08:16] message what how do you
[1:08:19] feel do you judge yourself right
[1:08:26] brother Brown will say I stop so that
[1:08:29] that will sink
[1:08:32] in amen it's not that we should
[1:08:36] Endeavor we should
[1:08:39] compul because it's part of our message
[1:08:42] remove that from the message you are not
[1:08:44] in the full
[1:08:45] message amen do you think that brother
[1:08:49] doesn't know what he didn't know what he
[1:08:52] said when he said I William Abraham I
[1:08:56] write down notes when ministers preach
[1:08:59] if you remember what he said
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:02] in in the S he continuously was
[1:09:07] practically begging the people to come
[1:09:08] bring your notes and make
[1:09:11] notes humble yourself he said from where
[1:09:14] brother has spoken I have made 20
[1:09:18] notes brother
[1:09:24] Bram we can not preach like this in
[1:09:26] Africa as hard as this at least I'm in a
[1:09:30] V Church there people that cannot
[1:09:32] write will stand like of sh will stand
[1:09:36] and judge Israel in time of Jesus
[1:09:39] Christ greater
[1:09:46] thanon you are
[1:09:51] allate if you don't have the words
[1:09:55] to overcome you must have the word in
[1:09:58] the way it is said if you don't have the
[1:10:01] word if you don't write down you believe
[1:10:05] that you
[1:10:07] understand listen the proper father goes
[1:10:10] on in the message that he gave to me to
[1:10:13] help me today to preach right today in
[1:10:16] that message God being misunderstood he
[1:10:20] said you must ask questions
[1:10:25] amen so if you hear this seron don't
[1:10:30] remember what I said how you
[1:10:34] ask how you going to ask me where where
[1:10:36] is this one in the in the Bible you have
[1:10:38] you have you you have passed through
[1:10:39] Ephesian Church AG in Ephesians church8
[1:10:42] the Brethren the
[1:10:45] church went to the apostles the socalled
[1:10:48] apostles and they fac them say it was PE
[1:10:53] prous for church members to face
[1:10:56] ministers what you are not saying what
[1:10:59] Paul
[1:11:00] said therefore you are
[1:11:03] false because he said because they knew
[1:11:06] what Paul preached as Paul preach
[1:11:10] hallelujah amen and they are filled with
[1:11:13] the Holy Ghost so if you don't remember
[1:11:15] what I pr today how are you going to
[1:11:18] confront me not with fight but to ask
[1:11:21] questions a church that is not asking
[1:11:24] question can not grow
[1:11:27] am good brother right yes because it is
[1:11:31] here there are 19 salmons of question
[1:11:34] and
[1:11:35] answers 19 question and answer
[1:11:38] sermons that's the only way we can know
[1:11:41] what is your mind amen look if you don't
[1:11:43] ask questions what will happen is that
[1:11:46] you will M to your wife your wife or
[1:11:48] your husband will be the first
[1:11:56] he
[1:11:58] preing if she's not spiritual or if she
[1:12:02] doesn't even understand that is why Paul
[1:12:04] said the women your women should ask
[1:12:08] questions when they get
[1:12:12] home and then as the
[1:12:15] church we should ask questions from our
[1:12:20] husbands if we don't do it we cannot
[1:12:23] grow as well as a church church that
[1:12:26] does
[1:12:27] it because there's something
[1:12:31] lacking when we eat our
[1:12:34] food nutritionist tell us what to eat if
[1:12:38] you don't eat it you don't you have not
[1:12:40] seen children
[1:12:43] with marasmic children but they T will a
[1:12:47] big as a PR woman the LI be th the head
[1:12:52] will be big
[1:12:55] not no nutrients in the body but he
[1:12:57] still living take that child I don't
[1:13:01] want to say bring bring that child to
[1:13:03] Canada get that somewhere in Nigeria and
[1:13:06] give him good food right yes
[1:13:13] yes why was it marasmic because it was
[1:13:16] done eating all that was
[1:13:19] available and that is what the same
[1:13:21] thing in the spirit that's right we
[1:13:24] don't need anybody to call come and tell
[1:13:25] us we are all message readers right we
[1:13:30] when we see it we must eat
[1:13:33] it if you are confused about it that is
[1:13:36] why God has placed the fivefold here for
[1:13:38] you ask
[1:13:41] them brother say if you allow brother n
[1:13:48] to preach Jehovah Witness do to you it's
[1:13:52] you
[1:13:56] why don't you ask
[1:13:58] questions
[1:14:00] because what is pre you don't follow it
[1:14:03] more than the gates of the church I'll
[1:14:06] tell you
[1:14:09] that how many can produce
[1:14:13] the three quarters of the thought that
[1:14:18] brother glob
[1:14:22] Express it's gone
[1:14:26] it's
[1:14:28] gone it will work on us for a few
[1:14:30] moments but it's gone I'm supposed to
[1:14:31] stop at 12 or
[1:14:33] 12:30 am I supposed to not
[1:14:38] normally bring
[1:14:40] it no I want to know what I'm supposed
[1:14:42] to
[1:14:45] stop 12
[1:14:47] 12 16
[1:14:51] minutes if you don't have it
[1:14:55] you are not respecting the
[1:14:58] message because you are not following it
[1:15:02] the way so you will not receive the
[1:15:04] blessings heaven will not be happy
[1:15:07] because heaven already has loaded
[1:15:10] blessings for us that's right amen
[1:15:14] amen and brother brah says that is how
[1:15:17] you expel your thoughts that's how the
[1:15:19] ministers know and that's how the
[1:15:22] ministers can go and study what you
[1:15:25] don't
[1:15:29] know the mins are also human beings they
[1:15:32] have wives they have their time to
[1:15:35] spend but if we see that this is
[1:15:38] recurring in the midst of the people
[1:15:41] then by the anointing of God they will
[1:15:43] go and study and bring it from his
[1:15:46] roots right GL and everybody be happy in
[1:15:49] the church am amen you see how your
[1:15:53] latency
[1:15:56] is don't help the
[1:15:59] Ministries
[1:16:02] yes we're not talking
[1:16:05] about there are things that we can
[1:16:07] preach and everybody will be Hing but
[1:16:09] when it comes to this kind of preaching
[1:16:12] that's right amen we have to
[1:16:15] swallow
[1:16:17] the the bitter the pill with water which
[1:16:21] is the holy spirit Hallelujah when it
[1:16:24] gets in it to do it Peaceable
[1:16:27] work of building let us read
[1:16:32] from seven
[1:16:34] churches the very introduction of the
[1:16:37] Church of the
[1:16:40] book this volume will concern itself
[1:16:42] with various major doctrines such as
[1:16:45] godheads water baptism Etc found in
[1:16:50] Revelation 1
[1:16:52] 23 his main them is setting forth the
[1:16:56] detailed study of the seven Church ages
[1:16:59] why this is necessary in order to study
[1:17:03] and understand the rest of the
[1:17:05] Revelation if we don't understand the
[1:17:07] Book of Revelation we are not part of
[1:17:09] the brides only the bride that
[1:17:12] understand that book because in the days
[1:17:14] of the voice of the seven Angel when
[1:17:16] begin to S the mystery of God will be
[1:17:18] finished as he has declared unto his
[1:17:21] servants the prophets and it is those
[1:17:23] who receive that Revelation that can be
[1:17:26] prepared for the coming of the
[1:17:28] Lord for out of the Ages come the seals
[1:17:33] out of the seals come the trumpets out
[1:17:36] of the trumpets come the ve at the first
[1:17:39] bust of a Roman Candle the church Ages
[1:17:41] come forth with a mighty initial
[1:17:44] illumination without which there could
[1:17:46] be no further light but once the
[1:17:50] Brilliance of the seven Church ages is
[1:17:52] given by divine revelation in know words
[1:17:55] that in this book shows to you and
[1:17:59] teaches you the spirits that work in the
[1:18:02] seven churches amen those Spirits had
[1:18:06] earlier worked in the seven churches of
[1:18:08] the Jews of the
[1:18:10] Hebrews after the seven churches
[1:18:12] finished it crossed over to us that's
[1:18:14] why bam Spirit K Spirit B spirit all
[1:18:18] those spirits come back
[1:18:20] here and when we have the message it
[1:18:23] opens them to us when a devil is exposed
[1:18:27] it becomes
[1:18:29] powerless that's why tell us what makes
[1:18:32] people to to to sleep off to the church
[1:18:34] a devil on your
[1:18:36] shoulder we didn't know that in
[1:18:38] Pentecost but this ministry that opened
[1:18:41] the Book of Revelation showed all that
[1:18:43] to us he
[1:18:45] said life upon life follows until the
[1:18:49] whole of Revelation open why before our
[1:18:53] wondering eyes
[1:18:55] and we
[1:18:56] being edified or built up am we did not
[1:19:03] start as man when our parents gave back
[1:19:06] to us we started as
[1:19:09] babies then we are what we are today
[1:19:12] that's why we have children amongst us
[1:19:15] if it was in spiritual birath be bth
[1:19:19] as men when we are going back home we
[1:19:23] have no babies because he will call he
[1:19:25] will change this one those who are dead
[1:19:27] they will not rise up as babies they are
[1:19:28] going to rise up in their
[1:19:31] Prime so now we need to be built
[1:19:36] up or eded and purified by
[1:19:42] spirit and made ready that is the cost
[1:19:46] of being made ready we will be built it
[1:19:49] will be purified and then be made ready
[1:19:52] not prepared made ready for the coming
[1:19:55] of the Lord so as I was saying brother
[1:19:58] Braham took notes from somebody right
[1:20:02] brought you to preach how can I overcome
[1:20:05] number two from there brother Braham
[1:20:08] also we could also learn from there the
[1:20:11] sincerity of this
[1:20:14] man yes why would he come to tell us
[1:20:17] that I took no to come and preach I
[1:20:19] didn't study
[1:20:22] well can I tell the congregation uh
[1:20:27] this I didn't study well to preach this
[1:20:29] sermon we will think in our flesh that
[1:20:34] we are reducing our importance to the
[1:20:37] church
[1:20:39] no he told us in the message how can
[1:20:42] overcome that greatness is Simplicity
[1:20:46] that's
[1:20:48] right greatness is
[1:20:52] Humanity humanity is the first sign say
[1:20:56] the first sign of Holy Ghost
[1:21:00] baptism because when you he that we
[1:21:03] should not message believer should not
[1:21:04] wear glasses whatever is happening to
[1:21:06] your eyes you will throw your glasses
[1:21:08] away why Mage said
[1:21:12] it we're not ashamed because said
[1:21:17] it may the Lord Jesus Christ help us
[1:21:20] amen yes I have 10 minutes to to reach
[1:21:24] to reach
[1:21:25] 12:00 I would try what did
[1:21:30] Adam in the beginning what were the
[1:21:34] things that were
[1:21:37] lost and what are the things that we
[1:21:41] have coming
[1:21:45] to Adam lost eternal
[1:21:49] life Adam lost rights of life right
[1:21:54] right to the Key of
[1:21:55] Life Adam lost fellowship with God
[1:22:00] complete fellowship with God coming
[1:22:03] every day every evening cool of the day
[1:22:07] if God came to Adam in the cool of the
[1:22:10] day and
[1:22:13] instituted as part of the feast ofice
[1:22:16] last Church evening service why do
[1:22:26] there's only one reason because time
[1:22:30] need you needed your time for other
[1:22:32] things that's is the true
[1:22:39] reason or you are coping other
[1:22:43] people from the
[1:22:45] beginning God measured time day in
[1:22:49] evening and morning
[1:22:54] evening and morning is the first
[1:22:57] day why did Brother Brown kept that on
[1:23:02] it told them in the Old Testament in the
[1:23:04] morning you must have morning oblation
[1:23:07] in the evening you must have evening obl
[1:23:09] the aroma or the the smoke of the
[1:23:15] sacrifice must continue to go onto me
[1:23:18] Jehovah through the day I must I must SP
[1:23:20] your offering
[1:23:22] right time is one of the treasures that
[1:23:27] God gave to us it's one of the talents
[1:23:29] that God G to us amen if you don't spend
[1:23:31] your time for God when God wants it you
[1:23:34] will spend your time for yourself or at
[1:23:45] once if like I tell in my my church when
[1:23:49] I was in big church I said the look if
[1:23:52] you have this problem if if 20 Brethren
[1:23:56] stand in a row at the
[1:23:59] pastor's office after service the same
[1:24:02] question Pastor why don't you have this
[1:24:04] why don't you have this why don't you
[1:24:06] have this why don't pastor and his they
[1:24:08] will think
[1:24:12] twice
[1:24:15] happy we preach for 1 hour 1 and a half
[1:24:19] hours and then we socialize outside for
[1:24:21] 2 hours
[1:24:24] in summer can you do that in
[1:24:28] Winter am I've not been here in winter
[1:24:31] but my wife has
[1:24:33] been no you
[1:24:36] can't why nature does not want you to do
[1:24:41] it you cannot bear it nature is was
[1:24:45] cruel at that
[1:24:46] time talked about winter as the time of
[1:24:49] death cruelity God showing to the people
[1:24:52] because of their sin cruelity of of of
[1:24:55] of of the
[1:24:58] elements but when God brings a
[1:25:01] leaf when we canot let us do more for
[1:25:06] God is that the time that our it ought
[1:25:10] not to
[1:25:18] be Adam lost fellowship with God
[1:25:25] this love that we have with our God is
[1:25:27] like in
[1:25:29] honeymoon or a few years after
[1:25:33] honeymoon the latest room and are they
[1:25:45] here
[1:25:48] okay sleeping sitting as as as

[1:25:57] wife he say no I until I get money we go
[1:26:01] together the love of
[1:26:04] honeymoon in a correct family the love
[1:26:08] of honeymoon is not supposed to
[1:26:13] seize and where is
[1:26:16] darling where the apple of his
[1:26:19] eyes where his
[1:26:21] wife the wife of theen
[1:26:24] and it gives us a direct
[1:26:27] order of when you come to the let me let
[1:26:30] me let me tell you something that God
[1:26:32] made me to inspired me to be able to say
[1:26:35] this to
[1:26:37] you usually the way God
[1:26:42] is when I have something important I go
[1:26:44] back to the
[1:26:46] Tes I search the message that brother R
[1:26:49] preached on that
[1:26:52] day I went to search the message the
[1:26:55] preach on
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:27:00] 908 only three
[1:27:02] messages
[1:27:04] 57 the two of them Hebrews I think 6 he
[1:27:10] preed one in the
[1:27:12] morning they had a dinner for brother
[1:27:17] right you know that's important message
[1:27:20] a dinner in in between services
[1:27:25] for their golden wedding anniversary and
[1:27:28] they came to the
[1:27:31] house because did not want that to
[1:27:35] because want to honor the oldest family
[1:27:38] in our church we didn't want that to
[1:27:41] dishonor
[1:27:42] God there are certain things that we do
[1:27:45] that we dishonor God
[1:27:46] but we don't think that it is but that
[1:27:49] is what it
[1:27:51] is Adam lost his inheritance
[1:27:54] in life and Adam lost his control his
[1:27:58] Dominion or his
[1:28:02] sunship and that is what Christ has come
[1:28:06] to give back to you and I on the platter
[1:28:10] of gold and that gold is this golden
[1:28:14] seven cost
[1:28:17] menu Seven Seals seven Thunders seven
[1:28:22] cosmen gold
[1:28:24] want
[1:28:27] to and we
[1:28:29] are maybe not
[1:28:32] willfully
[1:28:35] but we don't seem
[1:28:37] to remember that we are in a boot that's
[1:28:43] right where God is and he has everything
[1:28:46] in to
[1:28:48] amen time is one of the greatest apart
[1:28:52] from our souls time is one of the
[1:28:54] greatest assets
[1:28:56] treasure talent that has given to us and

[1:31:16] Church a Star Church where everything
[1:31:19] that is in the message you can see it
[1:31:25] yes in
[1:31:27] every
[1:31:29] Journey there must
[1:31:34] be
[1:31:35] arguments not negative arguments that's
[1:31:38] right but talking with each other I
[1:31:42] don't see why we should place this like
[1:31:44] this what does a message
[1:31:46] say I don't see why people should wear
[1:31:50] kind of what does brother that's the
[1:31:54] part
[1:31:55] of it is also
[1:32:00] written it is also written right let's
[1:32:05] take the example of our sisters they are
[1:32:07] the Showcase of the
[1:32:10] church if people look at the Hao of our
[1:32:14] sisters that if you know Africans there
[1:32:17] are some Africans

[1:33:00] amen whatever you are disposed to wear
[1:33:03] as attachment or or switch or wi it must
[1:33:09] not be artificial to your own it is part
[1:33:12] of the message amen when somebody else
[1:33:15] come from the church in band you know
[1:33:19] that place you cannot know because I
[1:33:21] don't know it either
[1:33:24] if he comes and looks
[1:33:27] around he's not judging but because we
[1:33:30] have Kindred Faith
[1:33:33] amen when he SE an African with the here
[1:33:37] here he will say this is
[1:33:40] from and then

[1:33:46] J that's that's name are you a nor no
[1:33:52] I'm southwest
[1:33:55] he will feel some
[1:33:58] kind my my knowledge the is on should
[1:34:08] them it's part of the
[1:34:10] message artificial outside means
[1:34:14] artificial insight
[1:34:31] K
[1:34:32] Church my story is not
[1:34:34] ended but 12:00 is staring at me in the
[1:34:38] face

[1:34:43] somebody comes to you and say it is
[1:34:46] written don't stay there check all
[1:34:51] around because it's also
[1:34:55] I don't care what
[1:34:58] anybody WR but it's also
[1:35:03] written that also written is what makes
[1:35:06] us to CL higher amen and press harder if
[1:35:09] we remain here it is written yes but
[1:35:13] when we are faced with it also
[1:35:15] written then where are we going to
[1:35:17] stand what are you going to
[1:35:20] do when you have the privilege of having
[1:35:23] the whole why do you have the
[1:35:27] half and that to dress yourself for the
[1:35:30] king do you don't you remember that
[1:35:33] Esther told ha

[1:35:44] king others have come oh in Nigeria this

[1:35:51] king
[1:35:52] wanted he knew that what the king wanted
[1:35:55] would be what who choose his bread for
[1:35:59] him but when this gu this young lady
[1:36:03] this virgin came who had been graced by
[1:36:12] God
[1:36:15] to says you are the friend of the king
[1:36:19] because God had granted her favor before
[1:36:23] that man to put her in the best place
[1:36:26] give her good medings taught her how
[1:36:29] would do here everything said just what
[1:36:32] and when the man dressed and got before
[1:36:35] our
[1:36:36] sh our was broken
[1:36:38] down this
[1:36:42] is
[1:36:44] that
[1:36:46] amen because her dressing was according
[1:36:50] to all that
[1:36:54] heart am in his mind the picture Jesus
[1:36:59] Christ is painting a picture today that
[1:37:02] is what brother told us by the message
[1:37:04] he's painting a picture of his
[1:37:07] Brides without spots without wrinkle
[1:37:10] without blemish or any of s things and
[1:37:13] he is the owner of the brides he knows
[1:37:16] what he
[1:37:18] wants and that is why he gave to us an
[1:37:22] Eleazar amen
[1:37:24] yes Amen brother Bram to empty his mind
[1:37:28] to his
[1:37:30] mind look at me haveed before you go
[1:37:34] tell my
[1:37:37] people everything that I am tell them
[1:37:40] when they enter into that I
[1:37:45] will these
[1:37:47] things are there for us don't ever
[1:37:50] forget that
[1:37:52] principle amen don't sit to it don't
[1:37:55] freeze on it is
[1:37:58] written When anybody brings anything to
[1:38:01] you that the prophet but the prophet yes
[1:38:03] he said this he also said
[1:38:05] this and he can show it to you from
[1:38:08] Genesis to Revelation without
[1:38:11] enemies it must not say contrary in
[1:38:14] Exodus or Galatians it must say the same
[1:38:18] thing because this is one book this is
[1:38:21] God
[1:38:24] and when it says that it must also say
[1:38:26] the same thing from
[1:38:28] 1933 to
[1:38:30] 1965 and it will be in the spirit of the
[1:38:34] message
[1:38:36] amen when we are like
[1:38:40] that nobody can deceive
[1:38:44] us nothing can push us here or there
[1:38:48] remember that principle it is also
[1:38:51] written
[1:38:53] that was the
[1:38:55] brid that was called in Revelation
[1:38:59] 4 when John had all these things he was
[1:39:04] called come
[1:39:06] uper to come and now behold that
[1:39:10] brid and he saw you there and he saw me
[1:39:16] there
[1:39:18] dressed in the white
[1:39:20] Rems of his own righteousness amen amen
[1:39:24] our righteousness cannot get
[1:39:26] there they are F the RS the way I think
[1:39:29] it should be is not
[1:39:33] there the way I want to appear is not
[1:39:36] there amen it is what he wants to do and
[1:39:39] if you run
[1:39:41] this through the
[1:39:44] scriptures you will find out
[1:39:47] that what is Con confronting you has
[1:39:51] confronted every
[1:39:54] believer is something
[1:39:57] new it has confronted every
[1:40:01] Believer from the beginning he
[1:40:04] confronted
[1:40:05] if if accepted L
[1:40:09] O Brother BR say if God will not
[1:40:15] accept
[1:40:16] him or will condemn it because of one
[1:40:20] word say how do you think that he will
[1:40:24] accept you with one word out what is the
[1:40:28] word is it not the message of the
[1:40:31] Prophet are there minors and majors in
[1:40:33] it
[1:40:36] no
[1:40:39] no everything must be
[1:40:45] cured because that's is what we produce
[1:40:47] the bread anything that is not itat from
[1:40:51] 33 to 65 from Genesis to Revelation is
[1:40:55] not
[1:40:56] its
[1:40:59] 99.9999999% is not
[1:41:02] its 101% is not
[1:41:05] it
[1:41:08] is 100% am that's why it g to us the
[1:41:14] parable of
[1:41:16] the
[1:41:21] S so allow is softness of life as in
[1:41:25] laia softness of Life the riches that we
[1:41:29] have and things like that to
[1:41:32] choke our services to
[1:41:35] God you also see it in the
[1:41:38] message when we see it what we don't
[1:41:41] want in the message we look away from it
[1:41:44] we open the pages too quickly because we
[1:41:46] don't want to we don't want that to work
[1:41:48] upon us but if you get to anything that
[1:41:51] you are not doing in your life on your
[1:41:53] family on your local assembly which is
[1:41:56] where we operate ritually it is what we
[1:41:59] get from here that will take out to op
[1:42:02] breakes this is where we feed that's why
[1:42:04] brother BR goes to the mountains and
[1:42:06] thinks to fill up so that it can come to
[1:42:09] Pour down to us yes what you hear in
[1:42:11] church what you hear your personal
[1:42:13] devotion what you hear your family
[1:42:14] that's how you
[1:42:16] feel then you go out and dress and walk
[1:42:19] the way the message says am if you don't
[1:42:22] feel up we're not going to show him to
[1:42:26] the world and everything that is said in
[1:42:29] the word is what will make us to fill
[1:42:32] up if we neglect anyone we are
[1:42:35] neglecting our
[1:42:40] Salvation is it Jonah Jonah says the one
[1:42:43] in the fish belly Jonah he says anyone
[1:42:48] that how does he put it forsake his
[1:42:51] Mercy or forsake something for six his
[1:42:55] Mery Jonah Jonah is in this Minor
[1:43:01] Prophets now the light has come so the
[1:43:05] government says I should start
[1:43:13] preaching Jonah
[1:43:17] sorry anyone that
[1:43:21] forsakes they that of serve lying
[1:43:25] vanities forsake their
[1:43:28] Mercy they observe lying vanities things
[1:43:32] of the world things that are not true
[1:43:35] are just vanities they are not true they
[1:43:37] forsake their Mercy this is Mercy given
[1:43:39] to us amen the message is the mercy of
[1:43:42] God when we forsake anything in
[1:43:45] it we are forsaking our mercy and we
[1:43:49] don't want to forsake our
[1:43:51] Mercy Church in Cal
[1:43:56] since government has approved that can
[1:43:58] go on
[1:43:59] preaching let me also talk
[1:44:02] about the pattern of God I have here a
[1:44:05] long read but will not read it when you
[1:44:08] get home read what David gave to the
[1:44:11] people of Israel he called Israel
[1:44:13] together from the least to the greatest
[1:44:16] right and his son was there remember
[1:44:20] that that son had before that time has
[1:44:22] been placed on the throne not of Throne
[1:44:26] of David the Bible say he has been
[1:44:28] placed on the throne of the
[1:44:30] Lord Solomon was enthroned on the throne
[1:44:34] of the Lord giving us what will happen
[1:44:36] in the
[1:44:38] future it was so important to God
[1:44:42] to place it like that in the scriptures
[1:44:45] so that we know what he saying he told
[1:44:47] him everything about the new Temple
[1:44:52] before all that time they did not have a
[1:44:54] temple they had a
[1:44:55] tabernacle now God was now going to stay
[1:44:59] in their midst live in their
[1:45:02] midst that he has told them from
[1:45:05] Exodus let them make me a sanctuary that
[1:45:08] I want to dwell in their
[1:45:13] midst and he gave him the the
[1:45:17] measurement the type of material the way
[1:45:19] they will build it everything that not
[1:45:21] only the temple the other the other
[1:45:24] houses that he now gave it to he said
[1:45:27] God showed this to me in the
[1:45:29] spirit God revealed that to him you call
[1:45:34] it Blue Print here you call it plan the
[1:45:37] house of plan of the house in our place
[1:45:40] he gave him that blueprint from the
[1:45:42] spirit yes sir it was revealed to him as
[1:45:46] it was reveal to brother to build him
[1:45:49] human
[1:45:51] bodies yes sir
[1:45:53] and when he gave it to him he told him
[1:45:57] do it exactly as he has given it to me
[1:46:00] this is the seven books he gave him the
[1:46:03] seven
[1:46:05] books and when Solomon came Solomon said
[1:46:08] to God God this is what you spoke by
[1:46:13] your mouth to my father David this is
[1:46:16] now your hands have produced it I have
[1:46:20] built it according to what the servant s
[1:46:25] amen huram and the others they did it
[1:46:29] exactly what was said amen that was how
[1:46:32] that was how God
[1:46:35] came after their dedication and lived in
[1:46:38] it if something was not in place God
[1:46:41] would not come right don't we know that
[1:46:43] we are in the same Exodus am don't we
[1:46:46] know that he's he gave those ones as
[1:46:48] types to us amen types and antitypes
[1:46:52] they don't fail
[1:46:54] if the type says this is the way it
[1:46:55] should be the ant the antip cannot say
[1:46:58] this is the way it should be he gave us
[1:46:59] what you can see
[1:47:02] Shadow if these are six
[1:47:05] fingers are these six fingers no five
[1:47:08] fingers this one cannot be six fingers
[1:47:12] if the shadow says five this must be
[1:47:16] five if he dealt with them like that in
[1:47:20] the first exus second exus
[1:47:23] first Tabernacle second Tabernacle the
[1:47:26] third Tabernacle came he came and Christ
[1:47:28] said that when you see me you see the
[1:47:31] father that's right I do nothing but
[1:47:34] what I see the father done
[1:47:36] right oh what is the works of God the
[1:47:39] works of God is to believe him
[1:47:42] Hallelujah whom he has sent
[1:47:45] amen that's how to work the works of God
[1:47:49] that is how to work the works of God
[1:48:00] there are people that have falling away
[1:48:02] from the message that's not your
[1:48:05] portion there are people today that have
[1:48:07] been in the message and are accusing the
[1:48:09] prophets abusing him speaking evil about
[1:48:13] him that is not your portion but do you
[1:48:15] know that as hard as they are doing it
[1:48:18] yeah if I decide to step out of one word
[1:48:22] we are in the same whats amen right
[1:48:25] right God help
[1:48:29] us I'm lay this things down because that
[1:48:31] is what he laid in my heart amen for
[1:48:35] you and I believe in you as as well as I
[1:48:39] believe God I believe in you I believe
[1:48:41] in your
[1:48:44] hierarchy I believe in
[1:48:46] you I believe that we have not come here
[1:48:49] to waste time we have not come here to
[1:48:52] look at our eles have not come here to
[1:48:54] look at any other assembly there may be
[1:48:56] a
[1:48:58] thousand 20,000 people 200,000 people
[1:49:02] but don't come to hear about he does not
[1:49:05] count his people he weighs his people
[1:49:08] that's what told us he does not count
[1:49:10] his people he weighs his people and the
[1:49:14] scale is the scale of the word that's
[1:49:18] right no matter what we do how
[1:49:24] Victorious or
[1:49:27] how we we we we achieve successes in
[1:49:30] what we do if it's not the perfect word
[1:49:34] of God it will crumble that's right
[1:49:37] that's
[1:49:40] right that behoves of you as a local
[1:49:44] assembly
[1:49:46] to look at
[1:49:51] everything in Theon of the
[1:49:54] ages I will read this and then since you
[1:49:57] have
[1:49:58] read the book yourself am you know that
[1:50:02] what I'm saying they're
[1:50:04] there in principle they're there they
[1:50:07] may not be in
[1:50:08] Words resume of the
[1:50:11] ages from our studies we have already
[1:50:15] learned that much of the Revelation is
[1:50:17] totally
[1:50:19] misunderstood because we have not
[1:50:21] Formerly Known
[1:50:23] that the church spoken
[1:50:25] of and chur spoken
[1:50:28] to in the Book of
[1:50:31] Revelation does not refer to the pure
[1:50:36] ecclesial the elect the body of Christ
[1:50:39] the bride but it speaks to the entire
[1:50:43] body people who are called
[1:50:47] Christians so when brother Brown speaks
[1:50:50] when the Bible speaks he is not speaking
[1:50:53] to the pure Church
[1:50:55] alone he's speaking to Pure Church
[1:50:57] knowing that in that womb there is also
[1:51:02] a
[1:51:06] king I'm reading from
[1:51:08] the seven
[1:51:13] churches thus we learned that the church
[1:51:16] is made up of two
[1:51:18] Vines the true and false
[1:51:23] everyone that believes in message is not
[1:51:28] elens right everyone that believes the
[1:51:31] message
[1:51:32] from
[1:51:34] Africa to America to Asia to
[1:51:39] Australia and to
[1:51:41] Europe they are not
[1:51:44] elects
[1:51:46] amen you remember the brother that came
[1:51:48] and brought Amen to us you remember that
[1:51:52] brother
[1:51:53] I don't I didn't bring anyone but I used
[1:51:55] my voice to say amen I want to I want
[1:51:57] you
[1:51:58] to approve that that is the truth
[1:52:01] [Music]
[1:52:05] am we read the first
[1:52:08] Exodus all the ones that took the
[1:52:11] message of the Prophet to the Gentile
[1:52:13] land to The Possession what Adam lost
[1:52:17] that took it there that brought fruits
[1:52:20] of the land that saw the problem and the
[1:52:23] Beauties there they were not all
[1:52:27] Christians so you cannot say because
[1:52:30] this people do it like this this do
[1:52:33] no what does the message
[1:52:44] say
[1:52:47] not not all Israel is Israel so not all
[1:52:51] Christians
[1:52:54] are
[1:52:55] Christians thus we learn that the church
[1:52:58] is made up of two Vines the true and the
[1:53:01] force the two Vines are motivated by two
[1:53:03] kinds of
[1:53:04] spirits one has the Holy Spirit while
[1:53:08] the other is endued with a spirit of
[1:53:11] antichrist both claim to know amen and
[1:53:15] to be known of God you are listening I
[1:53:18] know you are
[1:53:20] listening both poort to speak for
[1:53:24] God both believe certain very basic
[1:53:28] truths and differ on others but since
[1:53:31] both bear the name of the Lord being
[1:53:35] called
[1:53:36] Christians and by such name bearing
[1:53:40] obviously claim a relationship to him
[1:53:43] and God calls that relationship
[1:53:46] marriage what does God do God now holds
[1:53:50] both of them responsible
[1:53:53] amen you are holding me responsible to
[1:53:56] be lightskinned how can I ever be
[1:53:58] lightskinned but because I said I'm I'm
[1:54:00] a ccasian I'm a Caucasian I'm a ccasian
[1:54:03] you're a ccasian okay we will prove
[1:54:06] it that's what he's saying right they
[1:54:13] claim that they are
[1:54:15] Christians they claim that he knows them
[1:54:18] but how do you know by their fruit you
[1:54:21] will know
[1:54:24] them
[1:54:29] yes we F learn that these two Vines will
[1:54:32] grow side by side until the end of the
[1:54:35] ages when both will come to maturity to
[1:54:38] be harvested this is our maturation
[1:54:41] time this is when we should be
[1:54:46] mellowed ripened
[1:54:49] mellowed so that the master can plock us
[1:54:53] what are we showing to the
[1:54:54] world what's our assembly showing to the
[1:54:57] [Music]
[1:54:58] world people look up to
[1:55:01] you brother brah came to preach in
[1:55:03] Calgary brother brah knows your stamped
[1:55:08] grounds right the second pool of the
[1:55:11] ministry was first exhibited in
[1:55:15] Regina I have the privilege of going
[1:55:18] there I went there to take photograph
[1:55:22] not not as a an idol but to say God you
[1:55:25] brought me to the place where the second
[1:55:27] pool amen of a
[1:55:29] Ministry of your coming down yes I can I
[1:55:33] see I I see the pr you are
[1:55:36] here didn't come to our
[1:55:41] country
[1:55:44] right the false Vine would not overcome
[1:55:47] and destroy the True Vine but then
[1:55:50] neither would the True Vine be able ble
[1:55:52] to bring the false Vine into saving
[1:55:55] relationship with Jesus Christ so
[1:55:57] there's no frustration this is the truth
[1:56:00] no it's not the truth God bless you but
[1:56:03] this is the truth know this is the
[1:56:07] truth that's why elect will not
[1:56:09] persecute
[1:56:13] elect third the third principle we learn
[1:56:19] the most amazing truth that the holy
[1:56:22] Spirit could and would fall upon the
[1:56:25] unregenerated false Vine Christians and
[1:56:28] manifest powerfully in various signs and
[1:56:31] wonders even as Judas had a Ministry in
[1:56:34] the Holy Ghost though he himself was
[1:56:36] pronounced a devil so you don't need to
[1:56:40] look at
[1:56:42] anybody Hallelujah you have all read
[1:56:45] Christ is the mystery of God
[1:56:47] revealed he said even your husband even
[1:56:50] your pastor even your wife even
[1:56:53] anything that will draw you away from
[1:56:56] the word of God don't allow it that's
[1:56:59] right if you have a pastor here that is
[1:57:00] bringing the
[1:57:03] book word for word to you yes you don't
[1:57:06] have any anything to tell God yes
[1:57:09] sir and he was talking his

[1:57:17] service and you see it
[1:57:26] how can I
[1:57:28] overcome by the word am am by the Holy
[1:57:33] Ghost baptism amen by
[1:57:37] sincerity by correction taking
[1:57:40] correction and by faith that's what you
[1:57:44] will find catl in that
[1:57:48] book your
[1:57:50] time your
[1:57:52] Treasures your money don't waste
[1:57:57] fruit it's part of the
[1:58:00] message Ram told his compatriots the
[1:58:04] food that you waste here if they get to
[1:58:06] India or Africa they will F
[1:58:11] Millions when Jesus Christ had enough
[1:58:14] food in his ministry what did he do he
[1:58:17] collected the fragments yes he not to go
[1:58:21] into uh
[1:58:22] the trash being right so you know how
[1:58:26] much to prepare if you have a husband
[1:58:28] that is L you will know if you have a
[1:58:31] husband that eats small you will know if
[1:58:33] your husband eats small and you put
[1:58:35] lad who do you want to eat

[1:59:02] Bible but
[1:59:04] us when we get to our estate as the wife
[1:59:08] of the king we are growing into it amen
[1:59:11] that's why this has come light has come
[1:59:14] and we have the grace of God I also have
[1:59:19] here your prayers
[1:59:23] a church that does don't pray can not be
[1:59:25] strong I will tell pastor if I have the
[1:59:28] time what I'm Not A Gifted person but
[1:59:31] sometimes God helps me
[1:59:34] what you are contending
[1:59:40] with you must know your
[1:59:42] enemy the only thing that will destroy
[1:59:45] your enemy is your prayer and you stand
[1:59:47] in the word because you have the spirit
[1:59:50] of God but you can have the word watch
[1:59:52] you can have the spirit you can see your
[1:59:54] enemy and let them go
[2:00:00] free you don't do anything about
[2:00:06] it we have talked about adult Sunday
[2:00:09] school your
[2:00:11] youth go and check what the message says
[2:00:15] about caring of Youth amen this
[2:00:19] generation in this book it told us what
[2:00:22] they will be if you don't give them the
[2:00:24] word and guide them according to the
[2:00:27] word amen they will become Embers right
[2:00:33] lastly they become hot
[2:00:38] ashes Lord because what they got
[2:00:43] in Sunday
[2:00:45] school the first Sunday
[2:00:48] school and they had
[2:00:50] him at least on the school when they are
[2:00:53] in their rage when the world is fighting
[2:00:55] against them if we don't bring them into
[2:00:59] adulthood by the message those one will
[2:01:02] not last them
[2:01:09] right brother Brown told us that the
[2:01:13] young ladies young men on Sunday after
[2:01:17] service in between service I will talk
[2:01:20] to the young ladies Young
[2:01:22] teers I'll talk to them
[2:01:25] about life sex and things like that
[2:01:30] right they know more about those things
[2:01:33] than when I was in their
[2:01:35] age and you know that they know but
[2:01:38] parents will
[2:01:40] pretend they talk of say they don't know
[2:01:43] but you know that they
[2:01:44] know if you don't guide them who will
[2:01:47] guide them said one woman
[2:01:49] outside will say that he lost them will
[2:01:52] guide them and by the time you know you
[2:01:55] have lost your chance
[2:01:56] amen exactly Amen brother Abraham told
[2:02:01] us how many have read generation
[2:02:07] here I recommend that you read that
[2:02:10] book in that book you will see what the
[2:02:12] children of the Prophet said about they
[2:02:15] brother Braham and
[2:02:18] games I don't want to ask
[2:02:22] is 123 I
[2:02:25] must but what he said to us
[2:02:29] about I've had the voice I needed to
[2:02:32] hear I've heard the pastor's
[2:02:34] Voice
[2:02:37] Hallelujah you say Generations that's
[2:02:39] the book generation okay yes I I was to
[2:02:42] ask it on Friday many have read
[2:02:46] it here in
[2:02:49] page 44
[2:02:53] he
[2:02:54] said let me start from3 have you ever
[2:02:58] noticed how the world gets into the
[2:03:00] spirit of things that are in the
[2:03:03] world they go to their ball games so it
[2:03:08] is their b games it is not ours right
[2:03:12] amen
[2:03:13] [Music]
[2:03:14] amen they are spotting events it's not
[2:03:17] ours right they can do it in basic
[2:03:21] classes as of their
[2:03:23] school
[2:03:25] than thank you but when we now get
[2:03:28] there church now gets them to do
[2:03:33] it okay let me read the prophets they
[2:03:36] enter into the spirit of it they it has
[2:03:39] a spirit that's different from our
[2:03:42] spirit they don't sit there like wall
[2:03:46] Flowers Old drys sticks they enter into
[2:03:50] the field of things in their ball games
[2:03:54] in their sporting
[2:03:56] events they must enter I was once once a
[2:03:59] sportsman I was a Pocky
[2:04:03] Skipper I know the spirits I have been
[2:04:06] there
[2:04:08] amen they become a part of things but oh
[2:04:12] how they hate the Christians for getting
[2:04:15] into this Spirit of God's
[2:04:18] word amen the spirit of God's word is
[2:04:22] different from the spirit of
[2:04:26] games right when you begin to Anchor and
[2:04:30] happen and heighten their emotions on
[2:04:35] these things they will not be able to
[2:04:38] separate the two when they get to older
[2:04:41] age that's
[2:04:42] right true brother Abraham said that
[2:04:46] when you give your children comics and
[2:04:48] things you are preparing their hearts
[2:04:51] for the the blast that is coming
[2:04:54] right not even their physical body the
[2:04:57] way they look at it you are destroying
[2:04:58] their brain but it's in the message but
[2:05:01] we do
[2:05:02] it there are cautions that has been
[2:05:05] given to
[2:05:06] us then now
[2:05:08] says they call us Fanatics and holy
[2:05:11] rulers because we don't get into that
[2:05:15] Spirit do you do
[2:05:19] that there's nothing that they won't do
[2:05:22] to show their hatred and disapproval
[2:05:25] because we don't have that in in in in
[2:05:28] in our in our
[2:05:30] Arena but the prophet say ignore it amen
[2:05:35] you can expect it knowing where it is
[2:05:38] coming from where does it come from from
[2:05:40] their
[2:05:41] master who has come into the church if
[2:05:45] you read Overcomers you see there Satan
[2:05:48] has come into the church am
[2:05:51] Satan has come to the message because it
[2:05:53] must come to the
[2:05:55] message not the message the pure message
[2:05:58] but it has come in our M amen that is
[2:06:02] what you be didn't he go to heaven where
[2:06:06] God said where are you coming from about
[2:06:10] job it must
[2:06:12] come we're not afraid of those things it
[2:06:15] must come amen
[2:06:19] amen just go on and get in the spirit of
[2:06:24] worship when they are doing that you get
[2:06:26] in the spirit of worship amen our spirit
[2:06:29] is clean right
[2:06:31] amen our spirit is fresh yes our spirit
[2:06:35] is
[2:06:36] real our spirit is sober and serious
[2:06:40] nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord
[2:06:44] the joy of the Lord is what is our
[2:06:47] strength that is why we we derive our
[2:06:50] strength we don't derive our strength in
[2:06:53] soccer right we don't derive our
[2:06:55] strength our spiritual strength in these
[2:06:58] games brother said I could have been
[2:07:01] playing
[2:07:02] golf I could have been playing any of
[2:07:04] these games he
[2:07:06] said does all these big men do that but
[2:07:09] I don't want it because there I will mix
[2:07:12] up with women that are new day dressed
[2:07:15] so that is why I make my game fishing
[2:07:17] like your
[2:07:18] pastor fishing and hunting where I will
[2:07:22] be alone with the
[2:07:24] [Music]
[2:07:28] Lord Church in carre I love you amen not
[2:07:32] because my children are here but because
[2:07:35] you love me I can feel that you love me
[2:07:39] I must let you see these things I'm
[2:07:41] passing this way maybe no time no time
[2:07:44] no longer then when we meet at his feet
[2:07:48] and everything is in position then we
[2:07:50] will embrace amen and said that will
[2:07:53] make
[2:07:54] it you see me
[2:07:57] somewhere in a little place because I
[2:07:59] come from a little
[2:08:00] church
[2:08:02] singing Amazing
[2:08:04] Grace amen what has brought us all here
[2:08:10] to come up
[2:08:12] here to make our homes what our homes
[2:08:17] should be a correct home remember
[2:08:20] married one
[2:08:22] the prophet told us that what cause
[2:08:25] problem in the house
[2:08:28] sex as Paul also said morning and my
[2:08:33] EG right my EG this is the way I want to
[2:08:36] do it it's not of God am brother say he
[2:08:40] may be there to trust you to try you he
[2:08:44] said you are your husband may have
[2:08:46] different libido
[2:08:48] different how do you put it now
[2:08:53] different desires of each other say find
[2:08:57] a a comfortable medum because that is
[2:09:01] one of the things that cause problem and
[2:09:03] then you get to the pastor you won't
[2:09:05] talk about you talk about all things
[2:09:06] because you don't want to talk about
[2:09:08] that but Paul says that it can happen 1
[2:09:11] Corinthians 7
[2:09:13] amen Satan introduces it like that
[2:09:17] because he wants to ca disunity we must
[2:09:20] be wise by what the message has given us
[2:09:23] to be wise our desire should be more of
[2:09:26] God more of God more of God to see him
[2:09:30] more clearly that's right as the message
[2:09:34] unfolds then we will unfold amen as we
[2:09:37] study then we will be
[2:09:40] more everything that you know that is
[2:09:44] not 100% the message why don't you as
[2:09:47] individual
[2:09:49] first because the pastor cannot bring un
[2:09:51] for on
[2:09:52] anybody but why don't you as an
[2:09:54] individual look into the
[2:09:57] books I said I want to be sincere to
[2:10:00] myself right brother Braham at the end
[2:10:03] of the second pool God demanded from him
[2:10:06] be more sincere he said he didn't say I
[2:10:09] was not sincere but he said I should be
[2:10:12] more sincere because he was taking me to
[2:10:14] a higher height maybe he wants to take
[2:10:16] this local assembly to a higher height
[2:10:18] maybe he wants to take individuals to a
[2:10:20] higher height Maybe wants to take
[2:10:22] families to higher Heights why don't we
[2:10:24] consider
[2:10:26] it why don't we sit down program called
[2:10:31] business meetings why don't we sit down
[2:10:34] as families and see these things there
[2:10:36] have
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:39] manymore when we had the first law
[2:10:44] supper in this church I told Pastor that
[2:10:46] God Tau me something that I quickly sent
[2:10:49] home they some people are better than we
[2:10:51] are doing
[2:10:53] it because I found that that's what the
[2:10:55] prophet said we're not doing it I sent
[2:10:56] it
[2:11:08] home I love
[2:11:10] you you love me
[2:11:14] Hallelujah the word of the Lord is our
[2:11:17] comfort amen amen I know that
[2:11:22] it's
[2:11:23] hard to see that beautiful faces like
[2:11:26] this are not yet
[2:11:28] there but that's the best thing that we
[2:11:31] can do for each
[2:11:32] other the parable of the face have you
[2:11:36] ever considered the parable of the face
[2:11:38] the face can see everything in the body
[2:11:41] but it can never see
[2:11:44] itself it can see everything it can't
[2:11:47] see itself and it can't see it back
[2:11:52] somebody else must come and tell
[2:11:55] him I want more of Christ how many will
[2:11:59] join me I want more of Christ I want
[2:12:03] more of Christ with my family I want
[2:12:05] more of Christ with this assembly I want
[2:12:07] this assembly to be a prime a token
[2:12:10] assembly a token is what you remove from
[2:12:13] all others that's why he said he will
[2:12:15] make us his token amen this is my token
[2:12:18] my 10th yes shall
[2:12:26] f as should bow our
[2:12:28] heads and talk to the Lord
[2:12:39] ourselves talk to the Lord
[2:12:44] yourself ministers cannot pray for the
[2:12:46] church
[2:12:49] except what to do Amen in
[2:12:54] interceding it takes the
[2:13:00] church
[2:13:01] herself the individual
[2:13:08] herself talk to God say there's a
[2:13:11] difference between praying in the
[2:13:13] Prelude When you pray silently and when
[2:13:16] you after service when you talk to God
[2:13:18] don't look at what your your nebor is

[2:21:10] [Music]
[2:21:14] yes I just had had a question did how
[2:21:17] many people heard from your theophanies
[2:21:19] today did you hear from God
[2:21:22] today did the Lord speak to
[2:21:27] you what the discussion is about it is I
[2:21:30] I said to our brother he he made a quote
[2:21:33] in in Gan I'm not even sure what the
[2:21:36] language is properly but the same same
[2:21:39] same if that same spirit that raised up
[2:21:43] Christ from the dead dwells in your body
[2:21:45] it will also Quicken your mortal body
[2:21:48] and in our age not just to work not to
[2:21:51] signs and wonders but to the literal
[2:21:53] life of Jesus Christ the word for our
[2:21:55] day we heard the word today can you say
[2:21:58] that how do you say it we're going to
[2:22:01] learn that so he said P which means
[2:22:03] exact that's all
[2:22:07] yeah I I don't know if I could say it
[2:22:09] properly
[2:22:14] but p p
[2:22:16] p it sounds funny and I think it is to
[2:22:20] some extent but it needs to be
[2:22:22] exact I one of the notes I've got is 99%
[2:22:26] is
[2:22:27] off 101% is
[2:22:31] off but 100% is truly What It
[2:22:35] Takes what a wonderful message this

[2:22:39] brother toonbo oonoo who's going to pray
[2:22:42] for him as he
[2:22:44] travels I'm sure that he won't stop
[2:22:46] ministering the word uh my understanding
[2:22:49] is that he's been on the field
[2:22:51] continually for probably 30 years he
[2:22:53] hasn't had a break and uh coming here
[2:22:56] has given him a real break it's been a
[2:22:59] wonderful time of fellowship and uh just
[2:23:01] a a tremendous understanding around the
[2:23:04] word I I never ever get tired of
[2:23:07] listening to these generals who have
[2:23:09] been on the field for so many years I
[2:23:11] mean I I got a lot of notes and a lot of
[2:23:14] inspiration for future future Services I
