[54:52] everyone of the annual General men's
[54:55] meeting tomorrow night seven o'clock at
[54:56] the church you have your Bibles I'd like
[54:59] to read from Genesis chapter 14 tonight
[55:03] Genesis chapter 14 we'll start with
[55:05] verse 13.
[55:09] probably a fairly familiar scripture
[55:12] about that fella named Melchizedek
[55:20] I just think it's interesting to look
[55:22] back and see the origins of what we're
[55:24] doing here
[55:26] started somewhere
[55:30] it goes all the way back to Genesis 14
[55:32] and Abram he wasn't even Abraham yet
[55:36] Genesis 14 verse 13.
[55:38] says and there came one that had escaped
[55:40] and told Abram the Hebrew
[55:43] for he dwelt in the plane of mammary the
[55:45] Amorite brother of eschal and brother of
[55:49] Aynor and these were Confederate with
[55:51] Abram
[55:52] and Abram heard that his brother was
[55:55] taken captive armed with his he armed
[55:58] his trained servants born in his own
[56:01] house 318
[56:03] and pursued them unto death
[56:07] this is uh Abram going after lot we know
[56:11] lot was captured while lot was
[56:13] misbehaving down in Sodom and Gomorrah
[56:15] we know that Abram separated himself
[56:18] from lot he didn't hear from the Lord
[56:20] for quite a while until he had that
[56:22] separation and now we have circumstances
[56:25] being arranged to pull him back to lot
[56:28] again isn't that interesting and we know
[56:31] that brother Branham says that he
[56:32] pursued them unto Dan and that means the
[56:34] uttermost parts he went the farthest for
[56:36] his brother even though he knew he
[56:38] needed to be separated from him that
[56:40] they had Strife he still went after his
[56:43] brother
[56:44] verse 15 says and he divided himself
[56:46] against them he and his servants by
[56:49] night and smote them and pursued them
[56:51] onto hoba which is on the left hand of
[56:53] Damascus and he brought back all the
[56:56] goods and also brought again his brother
[56:59] lot and his goods and the woman also and
[57:02] the people
[57:03] and the king of Sodom went out to meet
[57:05] him after his return from the slaughter
[57:07] of chador lammer and of the kings that
[57:12] were with him at the valley of Shava
[57:15] which is the King's Dale
[57:18] and Melchizedek king of Salem brought
[57:21] forth Bread and Wine and he was the
[57:23] priest of the most high God
[57:26] and he blessed him and said Blessed Be
[57:28] Abram of the most high god possessor of
[57:31] Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most
[57:32] high God which hath delivered thine
[57:34] enemies into thine hand
[57:36] and he gave him tithes of all
[57:40] and the king of Sodom said unto him give
[57:42] me person the persons and take the goods
[57:45] to thyself and Abram said to the king of
[57:48] Sodom I have lift up mine hand unto the
[57:51] Lord the most high God the possessor of
[57:53] Heaven and Earth
[57:54] that I will not take from a thread even
[57:57] to a shoe latch it and that I will not
[58:01] take anything that is thine lest thou
[58:04] should say I have made Abraham rich
[58:07] save only that which the young men have
[58:09] eaten and the portion of the man which
[58:11] went with me
[58:13] Aynor eschel and mamry let them take
[58:16] their portion
[58:17] let's just bow one more time
[58:20] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[58:21] for this word we know that it's the only
[58:23] thing that's Eternal heavens and earth
[58:25] will pass away but this word that we've
[58:27] read just now it will remain because
[58:30] it's your word and father tonight we
[58:33] pray that you would just come by here
[58:34] and Quicken it to our bodies Lord to our
[58:37] minds and to our souls as we heard this
[58:39] morning Father we have come to church
[58:41] tonight so that we can get right in our
[58:43] heads and we thank you Father for that
[58:46] idea we thank you for that desire we
[58:49] pray now that you would just help us to
[58:50] get right in our hearts father before we
[58:52] come to this table that we would
[58:54] recognize the magnitude of what we're
[58:56] about to partake of we just ask all
[58:59] these things father in the name of Jesus
[59:01] Christ we pray amen God bless you
[59:03] tonight you may be seated
[59:05] how many enjoyed that service this
[59:07] morning my
[59:09] Supernatural Union by faith in The Voice
[59:13] by knowing whose voice it is that truly
[59:15] was speaking to us
[59:17] certainly thankful to see sister Faye
[59:19] back in service
[59:21] thankful for a ever-present tense I am
[59:27] you know what we're talking about
[59:28] tonight and the story of Abram and
[59:31] Melchizedek here in Genesis chapter 14.
[59:35] it can seem like a an interesting story
[59:37] and and it I just find it interesting
[59:39] myself
[59:40] that the king of Sodom went out to meet
[59:43] him
[59:44] and Melchizedek the king of Salem went
[59:47] out to meet him he had an audience of
[59:49] people he was the hero in that day he
[59:52] actually saved the day
[59:54] but you know it's interesting because he
[59:56] tried to spoil him the king of Sodom
[59:58] tried to spoil him tried to say you know
[1:00:00] what just take everything you want you
[1:00:01] can have all of the goods we just want
[1:00:04] the people back and and you know he just
[1:00:06] wouldn't have it he said no way because
[1:00:08] you're going to say that you made me
[1:00:10] Rich you'll be talking to your people
[1:00:11] and the other kings that are alive and
[1:00:13] you'll say that it's from your hand and
[1:00:15] my righteousness only comes from the
[1:00:18] Lord my blessings only come from above
[1:00:21] God is my provider he is the one that
[1:00:24] meets all of my needs according to his
[1:00:26] riches in Christ Jesus Abram had that
[1:00:29] Revelation what an incredible Revelation
[1:00:32] that is we know that Abram he had such a
[1:00:34] a good relationship with the Lord that
[1:00:37] the Lord spoke to him called him out we
[1:00:39] know that brother Branham said that he
[1:00:40] was a gentile even though this word says
[1:00:42] here that he was a Hebrew I don't know
[1:00:44] how you explain that but you can I guess
[1:00:47] by faith you can believe that he was a
[1:00:50] Hebrew even though the brother Bradham
[1:00:51] said he's a gentile but he was called
[1:00:52] from his own people told to just forget
[1:00:54] about everything you think you know all
[1:00:56] of your Traditions all of your family
[1:00:58] all of your home place just leave them
[1:00:59] behind and just follow me follow my
[1:01:02] voice come and see what I've got to show
[1:01:04] you and took them out and and we know
[1:01:06] that the the story you know the story
[1:01:08] they made the sacrifice together he he
[1:01:10] made the the animals split them apart
[1:01:13] and laid them out Abram fell into a dark
[1:01:15] sleep and and a smoking furnace was
[1:01:18] there and a lamp went in between all of
[1:01:20] the the carcasses demonstrating the the
[1:01:23] pillar of fire before it even came but
[1:01:26] here he was in a situation where he was
[1:01:28] able to recognize this was God himself
[1:01:31] speaking to him and it didn't matter
[1:01:33] what anybody else thought didn't matter
[1:01:35] what anybody else said to him he
[1:01:37] followed that voice he had faith in that
[1:01:39] Supernatural Union by the voice in which
[1:01:42] he heard he knew who his God was but you
[1:01:45] know brothers and sisters it takes
[1:01:47] Revelation to get to that place and
[1:01:49] Revelation is something that it comes
[1:01:52] from God it's nothing that we can
[1:01:53] actually just go out and buy why we
[1:01:55] can't just go and find Revelation it's
[1:01:57] got to be from God himself we know that
[1:02:00] Jesus he asked the disciples who do you
[1:02:03] say that I am what's the word on the
[1:02:04] street who are they talking about who is
[1:02:06] here some said Elias some said Jeremiah
[1:02:08] are a prophet and then he brought it
[1:02:10] right down home and that's what it has
[1:02:12] to be for us today in our lives it's got
[1:02:14] to come right down to home who do you
[1:02:16] say that he is who do you say
[1:02:18] Melchizedek is then it comes even
[1:02:21] further than that brothers and sisters
[1:02:22] who do you say you are
[1:02:25] because if it just stops at Jesus and
[1:02:28] just stops at Melchizedek if it just
[1:02:30] stops at brother Branham you've missed
[1:02:32] the point the whole point is so that we
[1:02:34] can come to a full recognition of Who We
[1:02:37] Are
[1:02:37] then the Rapture will go
[1:02:40] but you got to have faith
[1:02:42] in that Supernatural Union I'm just
[1:02:44] gonna I'm just gonna keep that for a
[1:02:45] while brother I love that we have to
[1:02:47] have faith in the voice there has to be
[1:02:50] a supernatural Union an invisible Union
[1:02:53] has to take place the whole world will
[1:02:56] say I could see you you're the same
[1:02:58] person you've ever been but wait what
[1:03:00] what's wrong with you there's something
[1:03:02] wrong with the way you act now you don't
[1:03:04] talk the same you don't you don't speak
[1:03:06] the same you don't do the same things
[1:03:09] it's a supernatural Union something
[1:03:11] happens
[1:03:13] and you know what what I'm getting at
[1:03:15] how do these two come together is that
[1:03:17] Abram was able to have communion with
[1:03:20] Melchizedek and brother Bradham says it
[1:03:22] very clearly we'll get into the quote a
[1:03:23] little bit later I'm going to try and
[1:03:24] just do this quickly because I don't
[1:03:25] really want to keep us here late tonight
[1:03:26] we've got a lot of service here to fit
[1:03:28] in but you know brother Branham talks
[1:03:31] about what it was that happened and and
[1:03:33] God himself will come and Minister
[1:03:37] communion to the believer to his
[1:03:39] children to his bride and I would go
[1:03:42] even further because we talked about it
[1:03:44] today we're not going to the marriage
[1:03:45] we're going to the wedding supper though
[1:03:48] marriage is right here so in various
[1:03:50] stages some people are bride and some
[1:03:52] people are wife some people have had
[1:03:54] that invisible Union when you've had
[1:03:56] that invisible Union are you still the
[1:03:57] bride maybe I want to say your wife we
[1:04:01] know that Revelation it says that we
[1:04:03] have reason to rejoice and be very glad
[1:04:05] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:04:08] and not his bride has made herself ready
[1:04:11] his wife hath made herself ready a
[1:04:13] little bit here like we saw today a
[1:04:15] little bit there a little bit here a
[1:04:16] little bit there with stammering licks
[1:04:18] and lips and other tongues right that's
[1:04:21] how he does it but here we have this
[1:04:23] fellow Melchizedek brother Adam talks
[1:04:25] about him we'll read a little bit in a
[1:04:26] bit a bit in a bit but melchized a king
[1:04:29] of Salem he brought forth Bread and Wine
[1:04:32] and he was the priest of the most high
[1:04:34] God and you know some people will say
[1:04:37] this is a maybe now not a second or a
[1:04:40] third person but a fourth person this is
[1:04:42] someone else way out there but like
[1:04:44] we've been talking about brother Branham
[1:04:46] he teaches very clearly it's just God
[1:04:48] changing his mask it's God amorphe it's
[1:04:53] not another person
[1:04:55] we can wind up with a bunch of different
[1:04:56] persons and you know what we don't want
[1:04:59] to do that we want to make sure that we
[1:05:00] recognize who this was brother Branham
[1:05:02] says it this fellow was God and that's
[1:05:04] all who this fellow was but he came as
[1:05:07] the king of Salem and he brought forth
[1:05:09] Bread and Wine he was the priest of the
[1:05:11] most high God and he blessed him and
[1:05:14] said Blessed Be Abram
[1:05:16] can you imagine that Blessed Be Abram
[1:05:19] of the most high God I think that we can
[1:05:22] as Believers when we receive this word
[1:05:24] for our day and we truly have communion
[1:05:27] with the Lord when we come up here to
[1:05:29] have communion brothers and sisters
[1:05:31] don't look at the Deacons
[1:05:32] don't look at me
[1:05:34] you have to have it in your heart that
[1:05:36] you're taking communion from Melchizedek
[1:05:39] priest of the most high God and remember
[1:05:41] that he's praying for you here we have
[1:05:44] to be able to say Blessed Be Your Name
[1:05:47] of the most high god possessor of Heaven
[1:05:49] and Earth and blessed be the most high
[1:05:51] God which hath delivered thine enemies
[1:05:53] into thine hand
[1:05:55] because we heard it this morning didn't
[1:05:57] we hear it this morning I thought it was
[1:05:58] so good Satan comes to church but
[1:06:01] brothers and sisters if we're coming to
[1:06:03] church to have communion with
[1:06:04] Melchizedek with a priest of the most
[1:06:07] high God then that Satan is going to get
[1:06:09] a flogging he's gonna get stuck to the
[1:06:12] wall until we're done here and then
[1:06:14] we'll let him go do whatever he wants to
[1:06:16] do but while we're here he can't touch
[1:06:18] us
[1:06:19] and I would go further to say that he
[1:06:21] can't touch us anyway unless it's
[1:06:23] appointed of the father and if it is
[1:06:25] appointed of the father it's going to be
[1:06:26] for our benefit that's the only reason
[1:06:29] he's going to have access to us
[1:06:32] and he blessed be the most high God
[1:06:34] which hath delivered thine enemies into
[1:06:35] thine hand blessed be the most high God
[1:06:37] which have delivered thine enemies into
[1:06:40] thine hand when you come and take
[1:06:41] communion remember that's what
[1:06:42] Melchizedek said to Abram and if you are
[1:06:45] if you are connected to Abram which you
[1:06:47] are spiritually speaking if you're a
[1:06:50] Believer today a gentile believer then
[1:06:52] you are the spiritual Seed of Abraham
[1:06:54] not Abraham but Abraham he had a name
[1:06:57] change and so do we but when that
[1:07:00] happens brothers and sisters blessed be
[1:07:01] the most high God which hath delivered
[1:07:03] thine enemies into thine hand
[1:07:06] and he says he gave him tithes of all
[1:07:08] I heard something this week that just
[1:07:10] made me chuckle what did what did
[1:07:13] Melchizedek do because he accepted
[1:07:14] doesn't say he refused it it says that
[1:07:16] he accepted it right he gave him tithes
[1:07:18] of all what did he do with all those
[1:07:19] camels and sheep
[1:07:21] what did he do with all those tides
[1:07:23] I don't know it's an interesting thought
[1:07:25] hey
[1:07:26] verse 23 kind of jumps out a little bit
[1:07:29] too that I will not take from a thread
[1:07:31] even to a shoe latch it and that I will
[1:07:33] not take anything that is thine lest
[1:07:36] thou should say I have made Abraham Rich
[1:07:37] you know what the devil wants us to put
[1:07:40] our stock in anything but God he wants
[1:07:43] us to say man that was a good deal
[1:07:44] you're sharp you're so good at that deal
[1:07:47] that you made or or or My you got such a
[1:07:50] good degree look at how how the Lord's
[1:07:52] blessed you so you could actually obtain
[1:07:54] the job and earn so much money brothers
[1:07:56] and sisters if there's any good thing in
[1:07:58] our life it came from up there it came
[1:08:00] from him and the only thing that we did
[1:08:03] was just got up and went forward but so
[1:08:05] long as we do that he'll bless us along
[1:08:07] our way like we said to the young people
[1:08:09] I think it's so important to recognize
[1:08:11] our the will of God the perfect will of
[1:08:13] God is not a destination we're not going
[1:08:16] to say that that the perfect will of God
[1:08:18] is for me to go out and and have a PhD
[1:08:21] in in whatever that's not going to be
[1:08:24] the perfect will of God the perfect will
[1:08:26] of God is for you to to go forwards and
[1:08:28] keep his word before your face every
[1:08:31] single day as you go to get the PHD or
[1:08:34] as you go to school to be a tradesperson
[1:08:36] whatever it is you do keep the Lord
[1:08:38] first
[1:08:39] that's the perfect will of God it's not
[1:08:42] going to a specific destination and
[1:08:44] that's not doing a specific thing
[1:08:46] although when you march forward God will
[1:08:49] orchestrate things so that you do go the
[1:08:52] right way so that you do do the right
[1:08:54] things so that you are in his perfect
[1:08:56] will if you keep his word first
[1:09:00] you know out of Hebrews chapter 7.
[1:09:03] I just think it's beautiful here
[1:09:05] Hebrews chapter 7 verse 19. I'll just
[1:09:09] read it for time's sake for the law made
[1:09:10] nothing perfect
[1:09:12] but the bringing in of a better hope did
[1:09:15] by the witch we draw an eye unto God
[1:09:18] isn't that beautiful
[1:09:21] now I just want to go and take a look at
[1:09:23] this one part here the law made nothing
[1:09:25] perfect but the bringing in of a better
[1:09:28] hope did what Hope was that brothers and
[1:09:32] sisters that was faith
[1:09:34] faith in the word just jump over to
[1:09:36] Hebrews chapter 1 says now Faith is the
[1:09:39] substance of things hoped for the
[1:09:41] evidence of Things Not Seen the only way
[1:09:43] that we're going to get Revelation is to
[1:09:45] have faith the only way that we're going
[1:09:47] to have faith is to have Revelation what
[1:09:49] comes first the faith or the revelation
[1:09:52] I don't know I think it's the sea Gene
[1:09:55] of God it gives us access to both
[1:09:59] I think it's just beautiful
[1:10:01] I'm just going to cut through some here
[1:10:02] just so I don't keep us too long I just
[1:10:05] want to talk about this and if I have
[1:10:06] one lasting thought tonight it's simply
[1:10:08] this when we come to the communion table
[1:10:09] like we've said in the past
[1:10:11] don't do it if your heart's not right
[1:10:13] you're better off to just not do it
[1:10:15] because the word of God says that if we
[1:10:17] come unrighteously if we don't come
[1:10:19] according to the will of the word then
[1:10:22] what happens is many are weak and sickly
[1:10:24] Among Us
[1:10:25] because we eat and drink damnation to
[1:10:27] ourselves if we got something wrong in
[1:10:29] our heart just don't come just sit in
[1:10:31] your seat just relax don't worry about
[1:10:32] it go make it right do whatever you need
[1:10:35] to do but you know what if you have
[1:10:36] everything right if your heart condemns
[1:10:38] you not then you have confidence towards
[1:10:40] God right and then when you take
[1:10:42] communion with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:43] this opens up the access to many
[1:10:45] blessings in our lives it's not just
[1:10:47] Health it's not just wealth it's the
[1:10:49] spiritual revelation of the word for our
[1:10:51] day and the spiritual Revelation more
[1:10:53] importantly of Who You Are
[1:10:57] who is this Melchizedek 1965.
[1:11:00] I'm just gonna Escape that here from
[1:11:02] paragraph 105 he says notice
[1:11:05] after the battle was over
[1:11:07] after the battle was over not before the
[1:11:10] battle we don't get it before the battle
[1:11:12] we gotta fight for every single inch of
[1:11:14] ground that we get in our Promised Land
[1:11:16] notice after the battle was over
[1:11:18] Melchizedek served his Victorious child
[1:11:20] communion
[1:11:21] think of that
[1:11:23] part of himself
[1:11:26] isn't that interesting
[1:11:27] here we have Melchizedek in Genesis but
[1:11:31] it takes all the way through there's a a
[1:11:33] stopover in Psalms 110 where Melchizedek
[1:11:37] is topped about but then it goes all the
[1:11:39] way over to the New Testament after the
[1:11:41] Old Testament through all the prophets
[1:11:43] then we have this Melchizedek this
[1:11:45] fellow turn up again in another body of
[1:11:48] Flesh named Jesus Christ
[1:11:51] and what does he do he does the ultimate
[1:11:53] communion doesn't he and that's what
[1:11:55] we're here to do tonight to follow his
[1:11:56] instructions he said do this in
[1:11:59] remembrance of me and that's why we're
[1:12:00] here is to remember him from 2000 years
[1:12:03] ago and from even further as this
[1:12:05] Melchizedek was brother Branham says
[1:12:07] notice after the battle is over
[1:12:08] Melchizedek served his Victorious child
[1:12:10] communion think of that part of himself
[1:12:13] now we want to see here and type here is
[1:12:17] in view the communion
[1:12:19] after the battle
[1:12:20] he gave of himself
[1:12:22] because the communion is part of Christ
[1:12:25] and after the struggle is over after
[1:12:28] you've done got yourself whipped out
[1:12:31] then is when you partake of Christ
[1:12:34] become part of this being you get it
[1:12:39] the communion the true communion with
[1:12:41] the Lord it doesn't come for free
[1:12:43] even though it is a free gift of God he
[1:12:45] tells us here's the free gift but
[1:12:47] sometimes you've got to fight through
[1:12:48] some devil sometimes you got to fight
[1:12:50] through some Humanity sometimes you got
[1:12:52] to fight through some traditions but so
[1:12:55] long as you do that brothers and sisters
[1:12:56] you fight through all of that junk that
[1:12:59] you've got to in this life he's waiting
[1:13:02] there for you at Communion and boy oh
[1:13:05] boy we want communion every day don't
[1:13:07] think about commuting necessarily just
[1:13:09] being at the community table we want
[1:13:10] communion having that Fellowship every
[1:13:13] single day every single moment of every
[1:13:15] day maybe when we start when we go on
[1:13:17] our knees maybe when we first open our
[1:13:18] eyes we can start having communion with
[1:13:20] the Lord when we close our eyes at night
[1:13:22] after the day is over we can have
[1:13:24] communion with the Lord in our dreams we
[1:13:26] can have communion
[1:13:27] after the battle he gave of himself
[1:13:30] because the communion is part of Christ
[1:13:31] and after the struggle is over after
[1:13:33] you've done got yourself whipped out
[1:13:35] then is when you partake of Christ
[1:13:37] become part of this being you get it
[1:13:41] isn't that wonderful you don't stay
[1:13:43] yourself
[1:13:44] you're eating his body just like John in
[1:13:47] Revelations right take eat the book
[1:13:51] many times we just go Revelations 10 1-7
[1:13:54] right but there's an 8 to 11. there's
[1:13:57] our part that's our identification take
[1:13:59] the book and heat it up that's the
[1:14:01] communion we're talking about when you
[1:14:03] do that you become part of this being
[1:14:06] you don't just become part of this book
[1:14:08] you become part of this being this
[1:14:09] Melchizedek this man this one that we're
[1:14:12] talking about tonight he goes on to say
[1:14:13] paragraph uh sorry 106. Jacob wrestled
[1:14:17] all night and wouldn't turn him loose
[1:14:19] until he blessed him that's right how
[1:14:21] many of us can do that how many of us
[1:14:23] can just wrestle with an angel all night
[1:14:25] until we get that blessing I think
[1:14:28] that's just an incredible story but
[1:14:29] we're not going to stop there tonight He
[1:14:31] says battled for life and after the
[1:14:33] battle is over then God gives you of
[1:14:36] himself that is his true communion
[1:14:40] he gives you of himself
[1:14:43] the little bread and wafer it just
[1:14:46] represents it
[1:14:47] he's giving you himself
[1:14:50] but I want to say this and even though
[1:14:52] he's giving of himself
[1:14:54] we're coming in commandment of his word
[1:14:57] his perfect will
[1:14:59] it might not feel perfect Satan's going
[1:15:01] to make it feel as awkward as all get
[1:15:02] out but we're coming in his perfect will
[1:15:05] to actually represent that part of him
[1:15:08] in US
[1:15:10] to receive what he has given us
[1:15:15] the wafer just represents it he says you
[1:15:18] shouldn't take it lest you've wrestled
[1:15:19] it out and become a part of God
[1:15:22] that's why we say to our children until
[1:15:24] you've actually been baptized in the
[1:15:26] name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't
[1:15:28] don't come to the community table once
[1:15:29] you've done that you know what you
[1:15:31] potentially have the Holy Ghost already
[1:15:33] and some might have it before they get
[1:15:35] baptized and some might have it after
[1:15:37] they get baptized that's not for us to
[1:15:38] say you know the Lord shows you but
[1:15:42] sometimes we might have a little bit of
[1:15:43] confusion about that but if you've been
[1:15:44] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:45] Christ it's open
[1:15:48] you want to open it up to you he says
[1:15:50] remember at this time the communion had
[1:15:52] never been instituted back in Genesis
[1:15:54] he's talking about not until before the
[1:15:56] death of Jesus Christ hundreds and
[1:15:58] hundreds and hundreds of years later
[1:16:03] Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today
[1:16:04] forever
[1:16:06] he is the same he doesn't change his his
[1:16:09] operation he doesn't change his pattern
[1:16:10] isn't that a wonderful thought if we
[1:16:13] think about it and and start taking and
[1:16:15] saying well that was for a different age
[1:16:17] and that was for a different culture and
[1:16:19] that was for a different tradition maybe
[1:16:21] a different Community a different time
[1:16:23] and space then what part of the Bible is
[1:16:26] applicable but if we can do what the
[1:16:27] prophet taught us to just simply say you
[1:16:30] know what this is the absolute and not
[1:16:32] just say it because he said it but say
[1:16:33] it because we believe it through
[1:16:35] Revelation through faith we can say man
[1:16:38] it truly is it's the first communion
[1:16:43] after his child
[1:16:46] Abraham had won the victory I love how
[1:16:48] brother Branham changes it to Abraham
[1:16:49] not Abram
[1:16:51] had won the victory Melchizedek met him
[1:16:53] and gave him wine and bread showing that
[1:16:54] after this Earthly battle is over
[1:16:58] we will meet him in the heavens
[1:17:00] and take the communion again
[1:17:04] it'll be the wedding supper laughs
[1:17:07] hi he said Jesus said this I will not
[1:17:11] drink no more of the Vine or eat the
[1:17:14] fruit until I eat it and drink it with
[1:17:16] you Anew in my father's kingdom is that
[1:17:20] right
[1:17:21] isn't that a wonderful promise
[1:17:24] when he gave the communion that night
[1:17:25] the last supper we're going to read it
[1:17:27] here when he did that he said to them
[1:17:29] I'm just not going to eat anymore
[1:17:30] because there's a whole bunch of you
[1:17:32] that I want to come and partake of this
[1:17:34] with me I want to partake of this with
[1:17:36] you isn't it a wonderful thing there's
[1:17:38] something special about breaking bread
[1:17:40] with brothers and sisters of like
[1:17:42] Precious faith
[1:17:44] he says notice again Melchizedek went to
[1:17:47] meet Abraham before he got back home
[1:17:49] what a beautiful type
[1:17:51] here we have
[1:17:53] here we have Melchizedek meaning Abraham
[1:17:56] before he got back home after the battle
[1:18:00] we meet Jesus in the air
[1:18:02] before we get home that's right
[1:18:05] second Thessalonians tells us that
[1:18:07] before we meet him in the air
[1:18:10] you know I just was thinking about the
[1:18:13] the communion and and Revelation and I
[1:18:17] wasn't gonna but let's turn over to Luke
[1:18:18] 24.
[1:18:20] let's just do it quick
[1:18:24] quick
[1:18:25] Luke 24.
[1:18:38] even after
[1:18:39] The Last Supper
[1:18:41] after
[1:18:42] Jesus broke the bread and gave them wine
[1:18:46] he still had another communion service
[1:18:50] I'll just start we'll start reading with
[1:18:51] verse 15 here Luke 24.
[1:18:54] and it came to pass that while they
[1:18:56] communed together and reasoned Jesus
[1:18:58] himself Drew near and went with them
[1:19:00] but their eyes were Holden that they
[1:19:02] should not know him
[1:19:03] and he said unto them what manner of
[1:19:05] communications are these that you have
[1:19:07] one to another as you walk and are sad
[1:19:10] I wanna and and the one of them whose
[1:19:13] name was cleopas answered said unto him
[1:19:16] aren't they only a stranger in Jerusalem
[1:19:18] and has not known the things which have
[1:19:20] come to pass there in these days
[1:19:22] and he said unto him what things
[1:19:25] and they said unto him concerning Jesus
[1:19:27] of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty
[1:19:30] indeed and word before God and all the
[1:19:32] people and and this is Jesus this one
[1:19:36] they're speaking this too
[1:19:38] verse 20 and how the chief priests and
[1:19:40] our rulers delivered him to be condemned
[1:19:42] to death and have crucified him but we
[1:19:44] trusted
[1:19:45] that it had been he which should have
[1:19:48] redeemed Israel and beside all this
[1:19:50] today is the third day since these
[1:19:52] things were done
[1:19:53] yea and certain women also of our
[1:19:55] company made us astonished when they
[1:19:58] were early at the Sepulcher and when
[1:19:59] they found not his body they came saying
[1:20:01] that they had also seen a vision of
[1:20:03] angels which said that he was alive and
[1:20:06] if you remember back into the gospel
[1:20:08] when they came back and told the rest of
[1:20:10] the disciples they thought they were mad
[1:20:13] they said you're telling Idol Tales we
[1:20:16] don't believe you this is crazy even
[1:20:18] though this is all that they had been
[1:20:20] told this was what they were supposed to
[1:20:21] expect
[1:20:23] verse 24 and certain of them which were
[1:20:25] with us went to the Sepulcher and found
[1:20:27] it even so as the woman had said wow but
[1:20:31] him they saw not
[1:20:33] he's then he said unto them o fools and
[1:20:36] slow of heart to believe all that the
[1:20:38] prophets have spoken ought not Christ
[1:20:39] who have suffered these things and to
[1:20:41] enter into his glory and beginning at
[1:20:43] Moses and all the prophets he expounded
[1:20:45] unto them in all the scripture the
[1:20:47] things concerning himself
[1:20:50] and they drew nigh onto the village
[1:20:52] whether they went and he made as though
[1:20:54] he would have gone further but they
[1:20:55] constrained him saying abide with us for
[1:20:57] it is toward evening and the day is far
[1:20:59] spent and he went into tarry with them
[1:21:01] and it came to pass as he sat at me with
[1:21:04] them he took bread and blessed it in
[1:21:05] break and gave it to them and this is
[1:21:08] you know the beautiful part here
[1:21:09] brothers and sisters and their eyes were
[1:21:11] open and they knew him and he vanished
[1:21:13] out of their sight and they said to one
[1:21:14] another did not our hearts burn within
[1:21:16] us will he talked to us by the way while
[1:21:18] he opened to us the scriptures
[1:21:21] the point I want to get to with this
[1:21:22] brothers and sisters is Melchizedek
[1:21:24] himself Jesus Christ the one who had
[1:21:27] gone and been crucified and then rose
[1:21:30] again from the dead we heard our Prophet
[1:21:32] say that this was the same Melchizedek
[1:21:34] in this quote we read who was this
[1:21:35] Melchizedek 1965 he explains it very
[1:21:37] clearly that was God that was God in
[1:21:40] Melchizedek that was God and Jesus and
[1:21:42] that was God here but what we're saying
[1:21:45] that I wanted to get to how did he
[1:21:47] identify himself
[1:21:49] and this is the critical key for
[1:21:51] everyone who might be interested in the
[1:21:53] message and how Melchizedek and all this
[1:21:55] could come together you know how he
[1:21:56] identified himself was by the word
[1:21:59] and their own testimony verified that
[1:22:02] but once they had enough word when he
[1:22:05] prayed it all came together he gave them
[1:22:08] the Revelation just like he gave Peter
[1:22:11] because Peter didn't have that
[1:22:12] Revelation his father in Heaven gave it
[1:22:14] to him who is the same person it's not
[1:22:17] persons but the same one gave him that
[1:22:21] Revelation the same one gave them the
[1:22:23] Revelation then their eyes were open and
[1:22:24] they knew him and he vanished out of
[1:22:26] their sight and they said my didn't our
[1:22:28] hearts burn within us as he revealed
[1:22:31] himself to us out of his word if we want
[1:22:34] a closer walk with him if we want a
[1:22:36] closer communion with him brothers and
[1:22:37] sisters this is where it's coming from
[1:22:39] right here pressing play and reading
[1:22:42] this word and and having communion with
[1:22:44] him and the more we do it the closer the
[1:22:46] communion is going to get to the place
[1:22:48] where we will be one there will be a
[1:22:51] union and when that happens you're no
[1:22:52] longer Twain right Ephesians chapter
[1:22:55] five the twain become one and that's the
[1:22:57] great mystery that is Christ The Mystery
[1:23:00] of God revealed
[1:23:01] it's his bride Jesus Christ
[1:23:05] I'm going to stop there
[1:23:07] God bless you tonight as we come to the
[1:23:09] communion table tonight I just want to
[1:23:11] encourage each one of us just uh
[1:23:14] consider the gravity of it it's not
[1:23:16] something that we take lightly this is
[1:23:18] the Lord's body this is Discerning the
[1:23:20] Lord's body Discerning the body of
[1:23:22] Believers that we're with and
[1:23:24] understanding that there can't be
[1:23:25] anything in our hearts if we're coming
[1:23:27] to this table we need to make sure that
[1:23:29] our hearts are good and clean that we've
[1:23:31] got it straight that we've come to
[1:23:32] church and we've got our heads straight
[1:23:34] when we've got our head straight we're
[1:23:35] going to have our hearts straight when
[1:23:37] we get our hearts straight you know what
[1:23:38] it will do it we'll get our heads
[1:23:39] straight I think that thought is is so
[1:23:42] beautiful we cannot walk around with a
[1:23:44] ball and chain dragging around things in
[1:23:46] our lives dragging around
[1:23:48] ought against a brother or a sister and
[1:23:50] come to the communion table and think
[1:23:51] it's going to be okay you eat and drink
[1:23:53] damnation to yourself I just want to
[1:23:55] scream don't do it just go make it right
[1:23:58] and then come have communion
[1:24:00] but hey if everything is good then come
[1:24:03] and have communion have confidence
[1:24:05] towards the Lord
[1:24:07] when your heart condemns you not
[1:24:09] maybe stand with me tonight
[1:24:13] we'll just turn over to First
[1:24:15] Corinthians chapter 11 before we take
[1:24:17] communion
[1:24:19] we'll just bow in prayer
[1:24:22] first
[1:24:24] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:24:26] tonight
[1:24:27] we just thank you for your goodness to
[1:24:29] us Lord we thank you Lord that we can
[1:24:32] have
[1:24:33] true communion with you
[1:24:35] Lord Jesus we know that you're you you
[1:24:38] said through your Prophet that millions
[1:24:40] and billions of people would be
[1:24:42] impersonators of Christianity
[1:24:44] father we just ask that tonight if
[1:24:46] there's anything in our hearts Lord that
[1:24:48] condemns us we pray that you would just
[1:24:50] reveal it to us just now
[1:24:53] father we pray that you would give us
[1:24:54] Lord the ability to have constraint if
[1:24:57] there's something in our lives father
[1:24:59] that's not right to not come to the
[1:25:01] table
[1:25:02] because we will eat and drink damnation
[1:25:04] to ourselves but Lord father we just ask
[1:25:07] that if there's anything in our lives
[1:25:09] that we could ask you to forgive us for
[1:25:11] this moment we just ask that you would
[1:25:13] forgive us Lord
[1:25:14] that you would allow us to come with
[1:25:16] confidence to this table tonight
[1:25:20] and father we'll be careful to give you
[1:25:21] all the praise
[1:25:22] we just ask that you would bless this
[1:25:24] portion of our service Lord bless the
[1:25:26] words that were spoken today this
[1:25:28] afternoon and tonight we just ask that
[1:25:30] you would be with us in every aspect of
[1:25:32] this service as we go forwards now Lord
[1:25:35] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:25:39] let's start reading with First
[1:25:40] Corinthians
[1:25:43] chapter 11.
[1:25:45] verse 23.
[1:25:47] as we move into the communion portion of
[1:25:50] the service
[1:25:55] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:25:57] which I also delivered unto you
[1:25:59] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:26:02] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:26:04] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:26:07] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:26:10] broken for you
[1:26:12] this do in remembrance of me
[1:26:15] after the same manner also he took the
[1:26:18] cup
[1:26:19] when he had took the cup when he had
[1:26:22] stopped saying this cup is the New
[1:26:24] Testament in my blood
[1:26:26] this do ye as oft as ye drink it in
[1:26:29] remembrance of me
[1:26:31] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:26:34] drink this cup
[1:26:36] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:26:39] come
[1:26:40] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:26:42] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:26:44] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:26:46] and blood of the Lord
[1:26:49] but let a man examine himself
[1:26:52] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:26:54] drink of that cup
[1:26:56] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:26:57] unworthily eateth and drink his
[1:27:00] damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:27:02] Lord's body
[1:27:03] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:27:06] among you and many sleep
[1:27:09] or if we would judge ourselves we should
[1:27:12] not be judged
[1:27:13] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:27:16] of the Lord
[1:27:18] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:27:20] world
[1:27:21] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:27:23] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:27:26] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:27:29] home that you come not together unto
[1:27:31] condemnation and the rest
[1:27:34] will I set an order when I come
[1:27:38] let's just take a couple moments and
[1:27:40] tarry one for another
[1:27:42] invite the
[1:27:44] musician to come
[1:27:47] play the piano and the brothers to come
[1:27:49] and serve communion
