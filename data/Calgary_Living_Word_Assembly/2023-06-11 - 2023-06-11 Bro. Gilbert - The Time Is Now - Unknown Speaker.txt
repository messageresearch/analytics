way Lord Jesus take control of the service father you know the needs of the hearts of your children they have come here for one purpose Lord they just want to hear from you not to hear from a man Lord Jesus I pray as I commit myself now in your hands may I not be a hindrance for them to hear what thou has purposed for them to hear this morning we want to commit the service now in your hands take control father of the service from now up to the end so that when we come to the end of the service father May each one of us father come up with a song that surely God has spoken to my heart father we commit our pastor who is away and the rest of the Believers that are away father we just want to commit them in your hands Lord Jesus may you have your own way even the scriptures that we are going to read may you preach the breath of life upon them Lord Jesus that heavenly father they may not just be words that we are reading or hearing but may they bring life and that change in our lives we humble ourselves as we look unto thee for your blessings in Jesus Christ's name we pray let's turn to our Bibles Revelation chapter 5 and 2nd Corinthians chapter 2. if you are there you can say Amen okay and I saw in the right hand from verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven or in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the Elder says unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals there are of second Corinthians chapter 2. 6 sorry second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 7. to 10. by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by Honor and dishonor by evil report and could report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many regions as having nothing and yet possessing all things may God add the blessings you can have your seeds this morning the title of my sermon is the time is now on Wednesday they evangelize the Evangelist talked about the day this is the day that the Lord has met now we want to zero in from the day now to time the time is now now if somebody says the time is now the time is now for what there must be something to be done yeah as I said somewhere else if you find somebody that is defeated with life and says the time is now that person wants to commit suicide he or she has made a decision the time is now now for us to say the time the time is now there must be something some circumstances that we have seen and we say by this then the time is now now the subject is my name is in the Book of Life so if we can trace that to find your name in The Book of Life then that will be the greatest thing you've ever had in your Christian Life I've divided into three portions the first portion why is the book important why is it important you are always talking about the book the book the book why is it important then two what is your name there is one thing to talk about it but is your name there then after you know that your name is there then you can apply it amen now in the book where we have read in Revelation John says there was nobody to take the book and open it and because there was nobody to take the book and open it John wept John must have been very serious why he was so much interested in the contents of that book why because in that book it is your inheritance in that book there is your eternal life in that book there is your courtship in that book is all that you need so now back to Genesis when God made man he made him a fellow God man was supposed to speak things into existence you were supposed to speak things and happen why because Man was created in the image and likeness of God so if you are in the image and the likeness of God then you are a god of the Earth [Applause] but what happened when Adam failed he forfeited that book when he forfeited that book it went back to the original owner but it was made for us no the original owner He adjusted to hold it waiting for the Redemption claims was there are these Redemption of claims then he returns it back to the owners the beneficiaries of that book are you a beneficiary amen now when Adam failed all that made Adam God was detached from him and because we were in Adam we also lost the courtship now when we lost the courtship and that courtship it was raw it was put in a book and rolled with Seven Seals hello may God help us this morning it was it was Seven Seals and put aside then how are we going to benefit out of it and thus the result that book is very important we can talk about that book from January to December why because that book is very important when you get that book oh my goodness when you receive that book and identify your name that this is my name nobody can shake you hey man now this is what the prophet says 63 0 3 17 e if you can get it I will appreciate if not it's okay paragraph 116. now oh my now the forfeited died of deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty God the title did to to the Earth and to eternal life when Adam forfeited it then Saturns that the hands could not hold it so it went back to its original owner God himself we are going to find out just in a minute there he sits on the throne with it in his hand the title did oh brother Prana who claps his hands now paragraph 117 all right Waiting For What in the hands of God waiting for the Redemption claims he made a way of redemption he made a way back and somebody someday the Redeemer is to take it back you see where we are getting to now we will watch this Pharaoh sitting upon the throne all right waiting for the Redemption claims it's Redemption what is this book of redemption this is the title did the abstract diet or did paragraph 119 its Redemption means all decompositions only composition to all that was lost by Adam and the eve oh my what ought that to do to upon again Christian decomposition to that Abstract title did the title did of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam lost do you possess what Adam lost okay amen okay in that book that was forfeited it had the package of our courtship but God has a law that the way we are born we cannot access that book until you are born again until you are born the way God wanted you to be born now we were supposed to be born by the spoken word the way Adam was born by the spoken word so if you have not been born by the spoken word there is no way you can access this book and if you cannot access this book then you don't have any legal claim to the promises of God okay amen now this document is our record claim to our courtship isawarika claim to our inheritance to who we are in God's mind as sons and daughters that can sit and have fellowship with him fellowship and the communion must be of the same nature I'll explain it Fellowship God wanted to have fellowship and as long as you are in you are in him there was no way he could have fellowship with you so he had to produce you out so that now he can have fellowship with you but we are saying fellowship and the communion have to be of the same nature amen if I find you with your chicken having fun oh you are so cute oh how are you you are having fellowship with chicken there must be something wrong yeah so fellowship and the communion must be of the same nature so for you to have fellowship with God you must have the nature of God in you or rest there is no way you can have fellowship with God amen okay now why is that book important we've said it holds your inheritance it has your eternal life it has all the promises that God has made for you hello I will come very slowly because I want this one to sink deep if you have a problem with it you can come and see me or take time to listen to the quotes take time to read those quotes there is something I want to put across so that we can know who we are because if we say the time is now the time for what okay now there is one thing possessing the title and there is another thing occupying the title The occupying the property you can have the title but somebody else is living or staying on your property I would explain the title is just a paper you can have it you can keep it in yourself but when we go to your property it is somebody else occupying that property and your property can be your children your property can be your health your property can you can be your peace your property can be anything so you can have the title and the claim oh this is my title did I have the title did but the property this quarter is occupying it you can feel it now yourself what the pro what part of your property the squatter is occupying you have the title did oh you are so proud I'm a proud owner but who is okay the devil can be sitting on your property he can be sitting on your health he can be sitting on your joy you are even in the church and you are you you you just can't even enjoy the service why this quarter is sitting on your property but now if we say the time is now then the time has come for us to claim back what the squatter is living on the time is now so what is that property that the squatter is sitting on God help us so having the prop having the title it is not enough you need to occupy the property yourself I want to occupy the property myself I have the title did yes but I want to sit on my property myself God help us oh yes so you don't have to live under privileged life there so I wonder how many of us have identified that their name is there you don't have to live under under privileged life you know that your name is there what where that that that book it is the title did it is your record claim you can have it and use it to enforce now you are clean hello God help us so now we need to find out when was this book released to us because we can talk about it oh John oh John oh John that is okay but now when was this book released to us so that we know whether our names are there or not in the message they preach 6303 17 e paragraph 37. the prophet says now see the mystery of this seven sealed book will be revealed at the sounding of the seventh judge Angel's message again now see seven seal book will be revealed at the sounding of the seventh Church Angels message the seventh angel begins to sound and there is the messages wrote out there and we cut them in tape and book form yeah okay now and we got it in tape and book form now at the beginning of the sounding of the message the mystery of God should be finished now we no longer talk about the Mysteries they have been revealed oh my the book of The Mystery of God is Not is not revealed until the seventh Angels message is sounded now the question is are we living before or after the seventh Angel's message if we are living after then this book has been released now if it has been released to who it has been released to the beneficiaries where are the beneficiaries oh my so now the seven sealed book is available to human beings for the first time since Adam failed foreign oh my God help me so you are courtship and inheritance lies in that book that's why that book is very important and it should be your concern when you sit here your concerned is to hear your name to see your name we are not here to see one another no I am here because I'm interested in that book I'm interested in my name in that book why because that book is my inheritance that the book is my courtship that the book is my title did which I can use to enforce my claim God help us amen in the message adoption 605 22m part 3. 605 22 m paragraph 170. oh brother Neville forgive me for taking this time oh that word inheritance it has got to oh oh oh I know the king's Man's brother I don't I hope I don't think I am but oh my oh what an inheritance what we have obtained an inheritance somebody has to leave you something and the god before the foundation before the foundation of the world left you something a name written on the book God left you an inheritance what is the inheritance and name written in the book that is your inheritance so that book is very important God help us but God's challenge is to make sure that only the pretestinated seat receives it I'll repeat it God's challenge is to make sure that only the predestinated seed those who are in him will see it the rest will not see it the rest will be having issues the rest will be having will be saying this and that but in the pretestinated seat once you see your name or you can holler like John or kulari hallelujah praise God I have seen my name so I may go ahead of my sermon before the graduation there is what what they call rehearsal now in the rehearsal yeah you have to I you the the seeds are are arranged so you have to see where your name is yeah but before you come to see your name you must make sure your name is on the list of the graduates you cannot come to check on the seats on the sitting Arrangements if your name is not on the list of the graduates so you are sitting here this morning because you are interested in knowing whether your name is on the list of the class ones may God help us so if that is your purpose of coming here this morning then you have no interest interest in knowing who is saying amen and who is not saying amen because your interest is is my name there is my name there yeah you are so concerned with your name you don't even if somebody tries to interrupt you you say please hold your peace I'll be interested in knowing my name I want to say my name on the list and that's why we are here God help us amen oh yes now if you have that name if you have seen your name then where we read in the book of Corinthians it applies to you let's read it read it again yeah oh my foreign by what of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by Honor and the dishonor by evil report in the good report as deceivers and yet true people may look at us and say you are deceivers sometimes they love at us that you follow a man but we may look deceivers and yet we are true oh my as a known and yet well known we may not be known in the world because for the world they try to look for the names of Honor Dr so and so but they ask we are not interested in the names of Honor we are interested in our names in the Lamb's Book of Life oh my as sorrowful and yet always rejoicing oh my goodness you look at somebody may you look so miserable but inside he's just rejoicing because of what God has made him or her oh my goodness I have read my name I know my name is there and when you come to the point where you say I know and I know truly my name is there then you must have seen it when once you see your name you can never remain the same that I your identification of that name in that book it brings a change in your life it changes the way you look at things it changes the way you behave it changes the way you dress it changes the way you act it changes the way you respond to people why because you have seen your name amen oh my as having nothing and yet possessing all things as if you have nothing but you possess all things why you have the diet of it you have the title did to your claims do you have something you want to claim you have the title teeth make sure you see your name amen now when I say that all that Adam lost is in this book I wonder how many can believe this that all that Adam lost oh my goodness I may not have time to read everything okay now now in the message unveiling of God now my subject this morning that is 6406 14 m paragraph 22. now my subject is moaning I trust that God will reveal this and each time if you who take the tips and listen and I hope and the trust that you have had a spiritual understanding of what god of what that God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out then it might be that some would say Oh you mean God would purposely do a thing like that he certainly does it one time the crowd was just too large for him then he said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood all right some people looked at you say they said no that's too much they walked away the crowd reduced they remained seventh ministers oh we are ministers of the Gospel he made another statement they said no that is too much they walked away they remained 12. why he was reducing the number to remain only those who believed in him so he said now the twelve who remained he said okay you are still here oh you're still coming to church okay no yeah he met even a harder statement do you also want to go go he was not pleating with the people please come to church oh we are going to have sandwiches no no he only wanted the thoroughbred the cream those who can believe on him regardless of the circumstances they will say Amen no matter what they will say Amen that is me so he thinned the crowd until they remained 12. but Peter said to whom else can we go you have to come to a point where you say to whom else can I go I've come this far I've come this far where else can I go God help us amen okay now when the lamb takes the book he passes it down to the prophet the word comes to the prophet and the Prophet The Prophet reveals it and is out in books and tips oh my now in the message the guide 62 10 14 e 6 2 10 14 e paragraph 35. and the Holy Spirit always speaks of the word I've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he will guide you to it that is the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you are supposed to be all the way up here by that time see bring us into the full stature of Sons and Daughters of God we are supposed to be way up but what is happening we are doubting even what God has met us we can't even believe ourselves go to have mercy on us okay what is the attraction on the mountain 6507 25e paragraph 147. that that shall never die it's constantly unrolling itself from the very thing happening to the picture being Jesus standing looking at us how many have seen that picture nobody has seen that picture if you have not seen that picture how have you seen your name God have mercy the evening light has come caught vindicating himself what is it it is the fact that God and the Christ are one the white how many seen it the white weak upon him as we talked in Revelation 1. see the Supreme deity supreme authority no other voice no other God no other nothing in him towards the fullness of the godhead bodily the Angels themselves was his weak amen what has happened on Mount Sunset God confirming his word that's what all this noise is about it is God fulfilling his promised word again Revelation 10 1-7 and Saint Luke 17 30 being fulfilled now we can say this day this scripture has been fulfilled and we Are Witnesses okay never despise Revelation there is power behind revelation okay let me jump okay so now who came down on Mount sunset the anointed ones at the end time 650 7 25 M and paragraph 269 and now now I want you to know this is sure and you that listen to to this step you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it is the will of my father that I declare to do and determined to do I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was already standing there when he appeared who appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are I'm only one that is near when he does it I I want us to have the confidence of what who we have in our meetings who came down we are not following a man he says against even his better judgment he was only a voice that God used to speak to he was only standing there where these things were being performed now who was performing these things God Has Come Down For What so that you can Unite with him until you come to a point where you say I and my father are one oh yes the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you are feeding on he is the one you are fitting on on on not a man his words with a man's what will fail but your feet feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man if you haven't felt fully on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above All these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it oh my now is my name there is your name there 63 0 3 17 e the bridge between the seven Church H's and the Seven Seals please I'm coming now to our subject just laying the foundation so that we know we have seen the importance of the book now if you are convinced of the importance of this book then you will be concerned what is your concern is my name there so now we are coming to a point where we want to know is my name there how do you know how can you identify your name how do you know that your name is there so paragraph 300 in the preach say is my name there I don't know now imagine you go to the prophet yeah and ask him Prada pranam is my name there then it tells you I don't know if you are not there you will be discouraged and say if it is not there is not there do I care huh the way the young men would say it if it's not there it's not there who cares [Laughter] but if you are a serious candidate you will care so now is my name there then he says I don't know so some will stop there and walk away but those who are serious they want to follow up because they want to be sure their names are there so let's now follow that story oh I hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world is my name there because this book is very important this book is very important the preachers have been talking about it so this book is very important is my name there okay can we know if our names are there yes paragraph 301 but the first thing that represented represented that Redemption come the lamp that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book Glory opened the book and tore of the seals and said send it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people he takes the book he keeps

means we can now exercise it the time is okay oh my the message of restoration 62 0-422 paragraph 86. enforcement or water text how I'd like to have two days on that enforce to restore means to bring it back or to restore Acclaim can it be enforced now to bring anything back to its rightful honor where it belongs therefore some way it went away from its rightful honor and can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring it back to bring it back to it who really owns it or to bring it back to its natural estate where it was at the first time bring it back into the natural condition paragraph 85 like if somebody stole some property and they are holding the property captive then you can take the law and call to this person and the law forces and forces this person to restore this property back to its natural honor into its liable fast estate the same law that made me to be born and shaped in iniquity never taught how to speak the first lie all the demons in my lineage loted in me the devil enforced it in his time but now it's my time now it is my time I wonder if we can recognize that that now is my time we can leave that door change to people but now is my amen the law forces it doesn't beg oh please please please no the law forces oh yes you remember what happened when Jesus Christ came to the demons they saw him far and they say why have you come before our time how many are afraid that scripture the demon says they see him from far they say why have you come before our time if we can exercise our courtship the demons will see us from far I said why have you come before our time so the demons know their time but I wonder if we know our time so the law forces it does not beg man okay if Saturn okay 60 okay still in the same same message of restoration paragraph 98 if Saturn has robbed you of the privilege of being a son and a daughter of God we have a right this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God bring them back oh my in the message just one one more time 63 0 1 2 0 e paragraph 50 16. now if something in the word can make you realize that you are free by his grace if something in the word can make you realize hello if something can make you realize what is that something is the revelation if you catch that Revelation if something in the word can make you realize when you catch that revelation then what will happen oh what makes you understand or some Act of God that it would that it included you it includes us all then you just accept it on those basis and you are free also you don't have to feel any different you don't have to feel anything at all it's not based on feelings Jesus didn't say did you feel it did you believe it oh my oh my okay I got the same same paragraph faith is an arm a mighty arm that holds the sharp to HD sword of God and that sharp to HD sword will cut every Promise free if that arm of faith is able to yield that sword some people has very weak muscle muscle trouble and they can just may be just cut off a little scratch enough to join a church others can come into justification some can go all the way to the baptism of the Holy Spirit a great strong arm holding this Bible can cut every Promise free so how strong are your muscles how strong are your muscles how strong are your muscles do you see people in the gym yeah without somebody supervising him or her yeah trying to gain muscles so how strong are your muscles some have just very strong weak muscles they just scratch others they can just go up to justification others will just go up to sanctification others will go all the way up to the baptism of the Holocaust but what we are talking about you go beyond until you say your name in the book when you say your name in the book all these are included in that package hello yes if you go all the way so it depends how much I how strong are your muscles hello oh my goodness amen as you amend the word you strengthen your muscles but if we have not said I meant since we started that is me that is me Hallelujah glory to God you strengthen your muscles oh my oh my okay God works in unexpectable way some things that you think in your mind that how God is going to work it out it may not work it out that way why he works in unexpectable way sometimes he answers prayers and yet you are still praying for it why because in your mind you have your own way on how you expect things to be done or how you expect God to answer that prayer he might have answered that prayer a long time ago and yet you are still praying praying for it okay okay now it reminds me Second Kings this story in second Kings chapter two let's let's open it I want us to get something there before we close I know some people are praying that I finish but before their prayers are answered let's look at this story second Kings chapter three okay are we there it's a beautiful story here from verse 1. now tehoram son of Ahab began to Reign Over Israel in Samaria the 18th year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and reigned 12 years and he wrote evil in the sight of the Lord but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the image of Baal that his father had met nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeropoham the son of nebot which made Israel to sin he departed not the route from and the Misha king of Moab was a sheep sheep master and rendered unto the king of Israel and a hundred thousand lamps and 100 000 Rams with a wool but it came to pass okay it came to pass when Ahab was dead that the king of moha prepared against the king of Israel and the King jehoram went out of Samaria and the same time and numbered all Israel and he went okay let's jump to verse 11. but Jehoshaphat said is there not there uh not here a prophet of the Lord that we may inquire you can read the whole story now from verse 1 but let's because of time but Jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord by him and one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said here is Elisha the son of shaffard which brought water on the hands of Elijah and Jehoshaphat said the word of the Lord is with him so the king of Israel and the josephat and the king of Adam went down to him and Elijah said unto the king of Israel what have I to do with thee get thee to the prophets of of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and the king of Israel said unto him nay for the Lord hath called these three kings together today deliver them into the hand of Moab and Elisha said as the Lord of hosts liveth before whom I stand surely where were it not that I record the presence of josephat that the king of Judah I would not look toward thee nor CD but now bring me a mystery and it came to pass when the mystery played that the hand of the Lord came upon him and he said thus says the Lord make this Valley full of ditches okay this is the situation they were going they were in a fight they had gone the wrong way of the desert until they were so weary because there was no water so they needed some water but then Jehoshaphat advised them now you are looking forward of it oh yeah Elijah is there so when they went to Elijah he said bring me the musician so that after the musician played then the word of the Lord came to Elijah and told them what to do now this is this is what he told him make Bus 15 verse 16. and he said that says the Lord make this Valley full of ditches for thou says the Lord he shall not see wind neither shall I ye see rain ye that yet that Valley shall be filled with water that he may drink both ye and your cuddle and your beasts make this Valley full of ditches make this body full of ditches read these messages yeah the more you underline them you are making body full of ditches yeah so after you make body full of ditches what happens now the water came they didn't see the rain they didn't see the wind but what happened the water came you will not see the wind you will not see the rain but what will happen the water will come make this body full of dishes read the word listen to the word as you listen you are making values full of dishes and what will happen water will come and you will drink and even your animals they will also drink God help us make Valley full of dishes oh my oh yes now we are talking about enforcing now the claim you have won the case you have the title the legal claim now what happens in most cases you look for the agent yeah who is the agent you must have an agent the prophet says the holy spirit is your agent yeah oh my now we have an agent that God has given us who listens to your instructions because you are unaware of God oh my goodness if we cannot say Amen to that one then I I wonder if we really have the agent yeah the prophet says the holy spirit is our urgent I don't have to read that quote but I will just quote it the prophet says somebody stole our brother's vehicle and the prophet says he engaged the agent he sent the agent the Holy Spirit who condemned that person until he abandoned the vehicle so if you have an agent yeah this quarter understands the agent he only knows the agent oh my goodness illegal fraternity there are some names you mentioned then once you mention that oh he says who who is your who is your legal agent you mentioned that name then your opponent will just surrender I cannot argue with that person you have already won the case so who is your agent who is your agent now what if you don't have the Holy Spirit so you don't have an agent and that's why you just copy for him to plead oh mercy oh mercy no if you have an agent the prophet says the agent listens to your instruction is and you send the agent what happens the squatter knows the agent oh my goodness may God help us who is your agent God help us oh my okay now stealing the message of restoration 6204 22 paragraph 89. but the law of the spirit of God is to force Saturn to give up that which he has unrightfully and deceptically taken from God Souls of men he took from God source of women children sicknesses of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights you have been given now it is you to exercise it can we exercise it can we take it oh my goodness now okay paragraph 134 I love this paragraph 134 and God
