in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians certainly appreciate each one thing of their gift if you have your Bibles this morning I want to make a little bit of a change in direction from Joshua we've come to the end of the Book of Joshua but I don't think it will ever end it will continually go on because it's moving forward into our Promised Land turn with me this morning to the Book of Genesis chapter 12. I want to talk a little bit about Abraham Abram at this point he hadn't received a name change but Abram Genesis chapter 12. Genesis chapter 12 verse 1. says now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee and I will make thee make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and I will curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abram was 70 and five years old when he departed out of heron and Abram took Sarai his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan and into the land of Canaan they came let's just bow in prayer one more time gracious Lord Jesus we thank you for this word thank you for your leadership Lord Jesus we thank you Father that we are able to through your leadership father have true communion with you and Lord Jesus we pray that this morning you would just serve us the bread and the wine father that you would break this bread of life open to us once again father that you would have just enough to serve us father to sustain us to take us Lord Jesus a little further into canaan's Fair land lord God we pray that you would just be glorified with all that said and done now father that I could get out of the way and that you could just have the preeminence father that you could speak now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen bless you this morning you may be seated certainly wonderful to see the change in seasons in 24 hours A lot can happen around here and we're certainly thankful for it not really excited about winter just yet but it is what it is I think we should have some nice temperatures this next week and we'll just see what the Lord has in store we certainly had a nice time of Fellowship on Friday evening with all the young people I would just like to commend each one for the willingness to participate to come out and put your shoulder to the wheel those who traveled to come and participate God bless you brother um certainly was a wonderful time of fellowship and if anybody missed out uh we certainly would like to have more of them so we'll see maybe collaborate with for the Joel and Sister Crystal and see if we could sneak in another one here and there it was wonderful to see everyone together um we have a community service coming up next Sunday just want to remind everyone of that on the 31st which will be the following day Monday we're going to have a fellowship at our house and uh I believe we just want to get a little bit of a notice an RSVP for those people that want to attend we'll have some some food and just some fellowship November the 12th we'll have the November calendar coming out this week November the 12th we will have uh a men's breakfast in Calgary we're going to get together with the men and we're going to talk about men things it's not going to be a business meeting so save your business discussions for the business meeting the men's business meeting this is going to be a men's fellowship meeting and it's going to be the first of many Lord willing we also are glad to announce we're going to have a youth banquet on the 26th of November so if you can pencil that in 26th of November we're going to have a banquet for the Youth it's a Saturday and we have uh brother Toby odinoa was going to be the keynote speaker he's going to lay on us what the Lord has placed upon his heart for the Youth and we know that he has a tremendous testimony and we just want to see what the Lord has in store so we'll have more details to follow on that banquet look for them on the youth chat and we'll go from there are you happy this morning it's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord we were just mentioning it on the way in here you know one of these days it's just going to break Eternal bright and fair and we won't have to go through another service we won't have to go to another day of work we won't have to go and and deal with school again we won't have to go and deal with all the the toils of this life you know brothers and sisters one of these days it's going to change forever and it's never been as close as it is today and you know all of the Saints of all of the ages have looked towards this day and this is the day that the Lord hath made and we have the opportunity to rejoice and just be glad in it he's chosen us to be the ones to cross the finish line what a tremendous blessing it is I uh I just felt led to to get into a discussion about Abram Abraham and ultimately basically leadership and communion if I had to title it it would be leadership and communion and I believe it'll be uh probably a little while we'll talk about this there's so much in here but you know just at the very end of the prophet's message the message that God gave the prophet God's message to the last age God's message to the world through the seventh angel messenger the second last recorded message was leadership being able to be led and then the last one was communion and and it was in that order on purpose it wasn't accidental whether Branham didn't just decide one day well maybe we'll just try this and see what happens no no that was just as he was going off the air as he said in the in the invisible Union of the Bride this is my message to the church it wasn't brother branham's message to the church it was God's message to the church just just look up because one of these days the fire is going to fall and you are actually the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you never did it in the from the beginning you never did it imagine if you could go forward spiritually and just say you know what I can't fail I'm here to say this morning which we already know you can't fail you can't fail spiritually brothers and sisters God has already created you before the foundation of the world to be a part of him and he cannot fail he's God so if you come from him before the foundation of the world ain't no devil that can stand in your way they're going to come around and they're going to try and harass us every single day every single hour of every single day but you are already virtuous you're already spotless you're already the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus Christ that he has carefully Chosen and positionally placed to be wherever it is that we live wherever it is we're at whatever it is we're going through his choice not ours but we're just able to say Amen to it we're just able to say be it unto me Lord according to Thy Word I just want to be all that you created me to be and that's what I think the story of of Abram and Abraham is is going to really get into because God saw Abram when he was a heathen he was even a gentile is my understanding of this in in Genesis chapter 12 God calls him to get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee he didn't even know where he was going but God said just you know what grab your backpack get get your get your luggage get all your stuff ready and just follow me don't don't don't worry about your father's house don't worry about your father's lineage get away from your Kindred get away from all of your Traditions get away from all of it and just come and follow me and now he had the opportunity to either accept that leadership or to reject that leadership because it was a personal revelation to him it doesn't say that God spoke to all of his Kindred and his father it doesn't even say that God spoke to lot but we know that Abram must have spoken to lot to say hey I've got a leadership something's going on in my life God's called me no doubt lot probably said to him who's God we've got God Gods what are you talking about Abram are you sure you're okay in the head are you feeling okay but he was so convinced he was concerned to do something about it but God said get thee out of thy country and and from thy Kindred and from my father's house into a lamb that I will show thee and I will make a great nation and I will bless thee and make thee thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and we know that that's a scripture that the United States of America has applied very strongly and many nations around the world have done that but it's still enforced today that very scripture right there but look at the last part of this scripture here this this verse 3 and in the shall all the families of the earth be blessed not just some of them not just the Hebrew families not just the Jews not just the ones who are in the promised land not just the ones who are Jews in another land all the families of the Earth every one of them will be blessed Because of You Abram because you were willing to follow the leadership of the Lord you were not willing to compromise and say well I'll follow you but I'm going to drag a little bit of my father's tradition and I'm just going to bring a little bit of my Kindred with me we know that Abram he followed the Lord he left he took lot was the son of haran it was his his brother Abram's brother and Heron died so a lot was kind of an orphan and the uncle he felt for him and he said hey I've got this blessing the Lord's called me he's he's leading me and I've got enough victuals for everything I can give you work and cattle and sheep and oxen and just just come with me and I'll make sure you looked after but that wasn't what God Said God said Abram you come and we know that when he took lot as long as lot was with him there was Strife in the camp brother Bradham brings it out he talks about it and he said that God didn't even talk to him again until he separated with lot God allowed there to be Strife between the herdsmen they actually were able to recognize there was there was a problem we can't stick together we've got to do something about this we've got to separate and through that Abram got back to where he was supposed to be on his own with God and as soon as he was God spoke to him again and and gave him a little bit more of encouragement a little bit more of Direction and that's what it takes brothers and sisters for us in our day is we've got to be willing to follow the leadership of the lord we can't just come to a communion service and say that I've got communion we can't just come to a service and say that I've got communion with the Lord Jesus Christ because I believe God sent a prophet we have got to follow the leadership of the Lord in our lives according to the word for our day in order to have true communion because communion is actually the relationship it's the most intimate relationship that we could ever have to have communion with the Lord Jesus Christ having a husband and a wife relation is one thing it's very intimate it's very close and nobody knows us like our spouses do oh my but when we go just a little step further and get into spiritual communion brothers and sisters That's Where It's At that's where it's the most intimate out of every single relationship we could ever have but when we can get to that place my nothing really matters it doesn't really upset us what's going on nothing really matters because we understand our husband's completely in control it's nothing out of control there's nothing out of kilter many times it will look like this world is falling apart the Devils will come and make it look like the world is falling apart they'll actually show us literally that the world is falling apart but does that mean that it is even if it is it doesn't matter because we know who who our husband is we know exactly who our relationship is with and because of that we have a peace that passes all understanding when we have a true leadership of the Lord Jesus Christ then we know our position in Christ and this is something that we've been getting into and I just think it's beautiful and I can see how it's kind of coming together but you know what is our position in Christ brothers and sisters it's one thing to say that we've got a great position in Christ and a great Revelation from Jesus Christ but if we've got a great position in Christ and a great Revelation from Jesus Christ about the word and and how we fit into the word then we're going to be exactly according to the word in our families when we're a husband we're going to be a word husband when we're a wife we're going to be a word wife when we're when we're a child we're going to be a child according to the word we're not going to be living Our Lives some other way we're going to be exactly according to the word we're going to follow the leadership of the word for our day you know brother Bradham he brought that out very clearly throughout the message of the hour Ephesians chapter 5 we've been talking about that for a long time how important it is to recognize our position in the body what's our position in the body what's our position in our family because the family is what makes up the body and if we're not dealing with our families then are we dealing with our bodies it's one thing to come to church but we need to make sure that we're actually the Christians that we come to church as when we're at home we need to be the same people but looking at the leadership of the Lord in our lives Abram was given this leadership and he followed it and as long as he followed it God blessed him God spoke to him God God showed him that there is a promise coming for you in your life and and Abram he accepted the leadership and he took a long lot even though God didn't call him he took lot because he felt for him and many times we have situations where we we want to do something maybe just a little bit more maybe just a little bit different than what the leadership of the Lord is and you know God won't won't curse us for it but we might not actually hear from him as long as we stay in that position where we're just a little bit outside of his word but then when we get back in line with his word according to the direction that he's given us then he'll speak to us again you know brother Branham he says that lot even though a lot we know the story about lot I'm not going to go too far into that today but after the herdsmen had strife and God allowed the situation to come to a head in the family we know that lot was actually a little bit entitled wasn't he because Abram was the one that actually saved him Abraham was the one that actually brought him out and and allowed him to increase and and have all of his Goods but then suddenly there's this big problem with his uncle and instead of just humbling himself having the the the surrender to the leadership the headship of his uncle respecting him what did they do they they clashed but it wasn't an accident it was so that God could separate his son separate the chosen one so that that promise could come to pass in his life and as long as he stayed in that position he wasn't able to be blessed but brother Branham said even though Abram Abraham was a silver dollar in God's economy lot was a penny okay so it's interesting when we look at it brothers and sisters we can see people in our lives and maybe we'll have a a a a notion about what sort of uh denomination they are in God's economy we don't want to do that we don't want to do that that's between them and God the only thing we want to do is make sure that we know what we are if we're a silver dollar then we want to make sure we stay a shiny silver dollar we don't want to be tarnished if we're a quarter be a quarter if we're a nickel be a nickel and I would say this if you're a penny just be a penny and it's up to us to make sure that we don't judge anybody we just want to make sure that we keep ourselves clean don't want to judge anybody but Abraham he didn't hear Abram he didn't hear from God again until he parted ways with lot and we know that lot he was gravitated directly to the most Naturally Speaking uh affluent areas he had to go for the the planes where all the water was and and Sodom and all the riches were and and Naturally Speaking he went for the best but we know that brother Bradham said Abram he just stayed out in the desert he said it's okay I know God will look after me I I know that God's called me and and he'll provide every single need that I've got I don't have to worry about it you know just sort of doing a high level flyover today I think we'll probably dig in and get a little further into this as we go but looking at this Abram dealing with lot over in chapter 13. is where lot and Abram separated Abram said to lot you know when there was Strife between the herdsmen he said to him in verse 8 of 13 and Abram said unto lot let there be no Strife I pray thee between me and thee remember it was the herdsmen that were actually upset but here we have Abram identifying no it's not just a herdsman it's between me and the why do we have this just let's not have any Strife I pray thee between me and thee and and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren just go and choose whatever way you want to lot and and and God will bless you and and whatever way you go I'll go the opposite way we'll just we'll just part ways here but we're Brethren let's remain that way and isn't it interesting because even though he had the leadership to actually part ways that way and to say just go whatever way you want lot go get whatever you want and I'll go the other way even though he did that then God allowed a test to come his way didn't he look he went down to Sodom and no doubt Abram knew what was in Sodom no doubt lot knew what was in Sodom they were aware of what was going on there and still that's what lot wanted to do and we know it wasn't good that was where lot vexed his righteous Soul daily with the things he saw and he heard it wasn't a good place but they were rich and increased with goods and had need of nothing but here we have Abram saying unto him just go don't worry about it let's just not have Strife because we're Brethren remember we're brethren we are Brethren that's the Baseline it's tremendous we're all a part of God's economy but as they went forwards as brethren we know that lot found himself in a lot of trouble he found himself actually captured by the Kings they came and tossed the cities and they took all of the goods and they took all of the people and and lot found himself in a position where he didn't know what to do no doubt he was wondering about that God that Abraham had no doubt he was praying to that God that Abraham knew he was saying where's that God of my uncle and what happened now Abraham was given the opportunity to say oh that poor kid I knew that he was gonna I knew it was going to be a problem now God teach him a lesson let him have it let them have it he deserves it he didn't he didn't listen he wanted to have Strife even though we're Brethren I was good to him I brought him up and out I helped him when his father was was done and now he's actually gonna get it he's gonna get what he deserved how many times as Believers can we potentially do that to one another we don't want to do that but he didn't this is what I'm saying God because of the leadership now God gave him the test to prove it isn't it interesting how Abram's life was just a series of tests all the way along do you trust me Abram do you trust me Abram do you trust me Abram and what did he do he knew exactly who he was he knew exactly where he stood he knew exactly who called him and he went forward he took all the trained men from his house they rose up and they went after the Kings and and they got lots and they got all the people and they got all the goods we know the story I'm sorry I'm going into it I didn't really intend to but here we are so they they go and and he rescues a lot and he takes him out from from this terrible situation and the kings of Sodom they they say you know what just just take all the goods give us the people and and and we'll be good we're so thankful for everything that you've done and what did what did Abram say to him you know what I'm not interested in one bit of money from you I don't want any of the goods because you're going to turn around and say that you blessed me that you made me Rich no way it was the most high God that has blessed me he's the only one that's ever blessed me and he's the only one that will ever bless me if I have anything good in my life it's because of him not you he made it very clear where he stood with those men and he said you know what if you want to do something hey just cover the cost put the gas in my vehicle for for driving to come and rescue you guys feed feed the men that actually put money out of their pocket to come and rescue you guys you can just look after them but I'm good it's for me and my house we we we're fine but isn't it interesting it was only then after the leadership of the Lord that he really actually had separated himself from all of the worldly items he he really consecrated himself and then the true test came to actually go and save his brother or not true truly prove whether they were brothers or not and through that test he was able to demonstrate they were brothers and what was the very next thing after the slaughter of the kings that happened it was that Melchizedek the priest of the most high God came and actually served him Bread and Wine served him communion but brothers and sisters it didn't come without the test right communion true communion from God never comes without a test we will always be tested we will always be tried in our lives our spiritual walk it's not the trials of our life it's not the trials of our jobs and the trials of our education and the trials of our health it's the trials of our faith that's the thing that's more precious than pure gold in our lives that's the thing that the devil wants to do is try our faith he'll bring us up he'll bring us down he'll drag us through the mud brother Branham says it in adoption you know the Tudor we've talked about this but isn't it interesting how he says it the tutor he can take the story back to the father to say you know what I've I've let him go to the hospital and and has turned his wife against him and and he's been kicked out of the church and he's had all these different things happen to him but he still says praise the Lord he still wants to serve God he doesn't want to change one bit in fact he actually worships a little louder when the problems come around he doesn't give up and change his attitude because of the circumstances he pushes harder when we've had the test we're able to have the communion but my when we're able to have the community and look back at the test and say God tested me so that I could actually prove him at his word in this moment oh my we have reason to shout brothers and sisters remember I just want to encourage it and and maybe people think I'm a little Pentecostal maybe I have a little slant that way but this is the quietest place we're ever going to be up there we're going to be shouting with all of our might because we know we made it we're redeemed and we never deserved it for one second we should have died oh but he gave us he gave us the invitation to come up to his house he chose us in him before the foundation of the world and the other side of it is down there they're going to be saying I could have sat in a message church I could have had my parents they preached the message of the hour to me and I rejected it it was there and I rejected it maybe my neighbor they were a little fanatical and they talked about this this seventh angel messenger and I didn't listen it's going to be loud down there two brothers and sisters right here we've got the opportunity to Rejoice we don't have to wait until eternity to start the Everlasting song we can start right now but you know communion communion is a very special thing the first communion was with Melchizedek coming down after the slaughter of the Kings and and presenting the bread and the wine after the test and we know brothers and sisters after the test in our lives those Dark Lonely Nights the sun rises in the morning and and Melchizedek himself comes to us if we're willing to just pass the test if we're willing to just stand the test if we're willing to not give up a not waver if we're willing to Just Praise as the word instructs us through our trials not get mopey and and complain through our trials that's not what the word says and so what happens when we do that we get another trial and then if we do it again we get another trial and if we do it again we get another trial he wants to see us rejoice remember brother Bradham says it that the devil will come to a place it'll come to a place in the lives of a True Believer when the devil just don't know what to do with you he just don't know what to do with the bride of Jesus Christ because she she's stronger than the circumstances stronger than the problems and she knows that she isn't but he is and he's the one who's in control of every situation but we know that Melchizedek came down and served communion for the first time to Abram after the trial after the slaughter of the Kings not before sometimes I feel like we can come to church and try and have communion with the Lord Jesus Christ without actually doing what we need to do and you know there's no no patents Penance maybe I'm not saying it right there's no way that we can earn our way into communion with God what I'm talking about brothers and sisters is the true communion of the Lord Jesus Christ is to be completely sold out to him to actually not hold on to anything from our father's house to not to not have anything from our father's Kindred to have no tradition to have no Gods no Idols remember in the last chapter of Joshua the one of the last addresses of Joshua and of God through Joshua said to the people before he died before he went off the scene put away the gods of your fathers don't have any Traditions don't have anything that will get in the way of mixing with this word for your day because if you do you'll die and it's the same thing today brothers and sisters we're talking about the promised land the Lord Jesus Christ if we're thinking that we can just say I could just pick and choose like a buffet table of the message of the hour and I'll just leave the things that I don't like and I'll take the things that I like and I'll say God bless you God sent a prophet it won't turn out right we've got to take the whole Buffet we have to eat it all because he told John take the book and eat it up and it will be sweet as honey in your mouth but it will make your belly bitter the reason it makes your belly bitter is because this flesh can't stand it there's no flesh that will actually live and see God that's why it can't stand it but boy oh boy when we eat this book brothers and sisters it changes our very fiber and one day it's going to actually change it's going to make that Revelation so strong in our lives it's going to change our body and remember that's what we're after we're after rapturing faith that Faith that's greater than any faith of every age brother Bradham says it's going to take more faith than any other age in this age in which we live in because we're looking for a body change and the only way we're going to get that body changes to eat the whole book and the whole book is the message of the hour including the Bible because the message of the hour points to the Bible and you know I'll go even further with that and say the message of the hour is the Bible because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and I would say that right now the word has been made flesh and is dwelling Among Us brothers and sisters through us then we know that there was another communion served in the upper room and I want to say it this way we know that it was the word that was made flesh dwelling Among Us that came to serve communion but I'll say it this way and I think brother Branagh might somewhere I could be wrong with it but it was Melchizedek that came and served that communion to the the boys in the upper room the disciples in the upper room because we know that Melchizedek was actually a type of Jesus Christ because what what's the word say about him that he was he was without dissent without father without mother he wasn't a normal human being he wasn't someone that we can tangibly say well you know he's from here and and he was you know brought up under someone and and did this and that and the other no we know that he was very God himself that came down and who was Jesus Christ we know that Jesus Christ was very God he's not a different man the the this is the difference between the the penny and the silver dollar I'll say it this way because the penny he said my lords right the silver dollar said Lord he recognized Elohim when he came to visit in the plains of mammary when he came to tell him personally he didn't just send a messenger he came himself and said oh my I'm about to visit you according to the time of life and we know that his wife laughed she said how could I have pleasure with my Lord even she said it my Lord but we know that there was a a there was a communion that was served again just sort of running with the the pattern Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever there was a communion that was served to the disciples in in the upper room as the last supper and and we know that that is a a such a significant event to the life of a True Believer because it's one of the ordinances that was given to us as Believers of this message of the hour and that is to have communion and we know that communion is a very intimate thing and we come to the communion table because it's an outward expression of the inward work we know that we're not interested in letting things come in our lives and become a root of bitterness so much that it would keep us from coming to that table because if I can't come to that table then I'm not going to see the full benefit of this word in my day so we take the opportunity to come to communion whenever we get the opportunity and if something is wrong in our lives brothers and sisters we just need to go make it right don't let anything get in the way of you and that communion table because the word of God says that many are weak and sickly among you many sleep many suffer because they don't take this this communion serious you know we can't have this communion this sweet relationship this intimacy with the Lord Jesus Christ if we're not willing to follow his word and and this is where I think it gets really good for me because I've learned so much I cannot say that I serve God according to the message of the hour if I'm not a father according to the word I can't say that I serve God according to the message of the hour if I'm a wife and I don't serve my husband according to the word if I'm doing something else then I'm I'm off the word and you're either on the word or you're off the word there's no in between there's no middle ground Satan wants us to believe oh it's a pretty shade of gray you don't have to worry about it you can just do this or just do that you can't you've got to follow the word of God it's all the way or none and you know God knows your heart that's the key when the heart is right then the outward expression manifests brothers and sisters and when the heart is wrong the outward body manifests we think we can hide it but you can hide it and it's not about hiding it it's about getting in line with the word because who here who here doesn't want the full blessing of the word raise your hand and I know it's a loaded question it's silly to say that but every one of us wants it we all want that kind of a blessing so we have to follow the word all of the word you know brothers and sisters if there's no leadership in our lives or if there's only a partial leadership in our lives or some leadership in our lives then there's no communion we can we can be a false Pretender of the word and think that we're actually partaking of communion but you know what if we're mistreating our wives we're not getting communion if we're not serving our husbands we're not getting communion we think we are but you know what that's the worst that's the worst curse that this world could ever have that's what happened to Eve she thought she was serving God but we know that she is the only one that was deceived Adam wasn't deceived but she was truly deceived thinking she was doing something right Satan came along he's a Slicker he told her that look that's the way you're created you're built for it to worry about it it's good we're going to be actually bringing God's word to pass just just go for it it'll be fine and it wasn't fine we know it wasn't fine but it was all part of God's plan we don't want to try and interpret the word we just want to live the word we just want this word to manifest in our lives brothers and sisters and and our lives have an outward expression more than we know no leadership in our lives according to the word there's no communion we can we can act it all we want and we can we can probably fool many people but we will never fool God and we'll never fool the devil and we can tell the lie so much we heard that a few Services ago it's the human nature right if you tell someone a lie enough they'll start to believe it and sometimes we'll tell ourselves a lie so much that we'll even start to believe our own lies and you know I I think it's frightening for us to do that but it's true I'll just say this just listen to politics you know without leadership we're not going to have communion it was only after Abram followed the true leadership of the Lord that he got served communion it wasn't before that God didn't come down to Abram and serve him communion Melchizedek didn't come and knock on his father's door and say I have communion for you you just follow me and everything will fall into place he had to follow the leadership of the Lord by faith in his life he had to step out from all that he knew by faith to see if he could actually get to that place of true communion with the Lord it was only after patiently enduring only after patiently enduring did Abram receive a name change because that's what happened to him and that's what happens to all of us brothers and sisters there's a new name written in our Stone isn't it and that's going to be a body change for us so so Abram so he could receive the promise God gave him a body change didn't he he came down himself and told him I will visit you according to the time of life brothers and sisters in this age did God himself not come down and visit us himself and tell us that I will visit you according to the time of life when that time is just right when the the cup of the amorites uh iniquity is full when when all of things are ready then there will be a body change he came down himself he didn't send a messenger we know that he had a messenger William Miriam Branham but what was sunset Mountain what happened 1963 what was the attraction on the mountain was it just God's Prophet out hunting if that's all it was brothers and sisters I really would like to have a further conversation because there's more to it than meets the eye only after God's leadership can we receive the true blessing in our lives and we know that in Abram's life he got the name change to Abraham we just sort of doing a high level flyover today I hope it's okay he got the name change and once he got the name changed God came down and actually visited him and confirmed that his name was changed called him Abraham in the plains of mammary when they ate the fatted calf they fellowshipped he washed their feet go to let me get a little water and and I I prayed that I could just let a little water and just wash your feet because I recognized that you are Elohim can you imagine that brothers and sisters what happens when we have a communion service are we able to have that Revelation about our brothers and our sisters just just let me a little water I pray thee that I could just wash your feet because I recognize that you are the Tabernacle of the most high God right here on Earth right now today do we recognize that brothers and sisters I think personally if we could recognize that that wouldn't keep one believer away from a communion service you'd be there so fast because you could recognize that you want to actually wash elohim's feet just like if we could recognize the the blessing that goes along with the tithe or an offering if we could recognize the blessing that goes along with that it's not about finances forget about finances finances are one thing but what about your marriage what what about your health what what about your spiritual ability to feed upon this word and to have strength to stand up against all the Devils that come around what about the ability to intercede like job for my children because per Adventure they could sin oh Lord let me make a sacrifice in the morning before the sun even comes up for my children because the prophet of God said that I'm the Holy Ghost for them until the age of accountability my how important is it for us to make sure that we understand the true revelation of the word for our day it's not about saying God sent a prophet it's about recognizing who we are because once we recognize what we are then the Rapture will go I don't want to spend another moment here then we have to we know that the children of Israel they spend 30 to 40 years extra in bondage I don't know if we'll spend any extra time here or not I'm not saying we will or we won't I'm just saying the word of God says they the promise was for 400 years right we would agree on that but hey they were there for 430 years I think the prophet says somewhere 440 years we don't want to stay here a moment too long I don't want to stay here a moment too long my goodness it hasn't even entered into the heart of man what what lays in store for us on the other side that's so fascinating to think about anyways you know Abram he was looking for that that promise and and we know that when he saw Elohim in the plains of mammary In the Heat of the day when he came to visit him and his wife and he declared my Lord we know his name changed and we know that nothing was the same for him after that we know that he was even able to ask the Lord the Lord said should we reveal our secret to Abram should we keep anything back from from our our son here on Earth and and he said no no we'll we'll actually tell you we'll let you know and and Sodom is going to be judged now we're going down to see we've heard the cries of the evil and we're going down to see ourselves is this truly what's actually happening and we know that Abram once again what did he do he interceded for his brother because he was his brother again he could have said man I told that kid saved him once but I told him he just wouldn't listen to me he didn't do that because he said he was a brother he's my brother he's my brother's son he's my kin he's my my blood my flesh and my blood we need to do something to save him so he asked God even contested in conversation with god I pray thee would you go down and destroy it for 30 people and we know that he counted it down please Lord don't get upset with me I just I just I just want to ask you what about 20 people would you destroy the whole city for 20 righteous Souls and he says no no no no I'd save the whole city even if there was 20 Souls there but there ain't 20 Souls there Abraham there's not 20 Souls there well what about tensels and we know that he counted it down even to five Souls oh my no I wouldn't destroy it not even for five but here we have him conversing with Elohim himself it's so amazing to think about that and you know brothers and sisters it's the same thing for us today we have the ability to converse with Elohim ourselves when we come to a service like this I'll even say this brothers and sisters right now the very thoughts in your heart are speaking louder in heaven than my voice through this microphone you are conversing with God in heaven whatever it is that's on your heart it's a wonderful thing we have the ability to the very access the very Throne of God Almighty where that one that came down to visit Elohim we can go to his house and visit him and bring our supplications and our prayers that we know that he came and he gave him a name change and he gave him a body change because he was able to follow the leadership he served in communion he took him he tested him he tried him he said now I believe that that you're ready for the next test Abram and and that's what it was it was a test wasn't it he was given the promised son Isaac was given to him and once he was given to him it was wonderful they must have just rejoiced and had such a celebration because they got that promised child they'd been waiting for for so many years we know that he had done the bird's eye and knitted the booties and did everything brother Branham said he didn't he didn't get weak in faith he was strong and and of a good courage as he marched in the land he knew that God promised him and it was going to happen and he actually lived his life according to that promise that it's going to happen and as Believers today we need to do that as well brothers and sisters we need to keep hoeing our potatoes and going to school and going to work and doing the things we need to do coming to church being in service but we need to be looking to the sky because any day now it's going to change for us but he was finally given that promise of Isaac the promised son that the whole world would be blessed through all of the Nations all of the families of the Earth would be blessed through that son and that's where he had a revelation because God said to him now you've got your son that's great you know you've been following me that's great I'm so pleased you're my son now I want you to take your son the one that I've given you that promised son take him to the top of the mountain and I want you to sacrifice him I want you to build an altar and I want you to cut him let him bleed and die for me show me that you love me Abram show me that you love me Abraham you you have followed me this far don't don't get weak on me now don't get weak in the knees now how many times in our lives brothers and sisters do we have situations that literally bring us to our knees where we get weak in our knees but that's simply God saying don't get weak on me now just show me that you love me let me see that you know that you love me and once he actually took him up we know that Isaac said to him hey Dad I see the fire and I see the wood but where's the lamb and what did Abram say to him what did Abraham say God will provide that lamb don't you worry son God will provide us a sacrifice because he's Jehovah Jireh he will provide what we need and we know that they got up there and we know that he got to the place where everything was placed in order and he told he must have told his son Isaac you are a promise from God you were created in him from before the foundation of the world before I left my father's house he told me that I would be blessed through my seed there would be a blessing to the entire world all of the families of the world would be blessed because of you like the dust on the on the beach of the sea the dust on the earth will be the numbers of the people that come from us from you my son because you are the promised son you didn't come from Hagar you weren't a a mingled seed you're the pure seed you're the promise seed you are the promised one Isaac it's all coming through you he must have told him all the way up don't worry son Jehovah Jireh is here and he's going to provide we're going to be completely safe because if perhaps you do die in this in this sacrifice God is obligated to raise you up according to his word don't you worry son it's all going to turn out and we know that Isaac had to Just Surrender Isaac had to follow the leadership of his daddy Isaac had to be willing to say okay Dad I trust you with all my heart I don't know what's going to happen here but one way or another I'm going to live according to what you're telling me so I guess just tie my hands up I guess just lay me on top of the wood I guess just pull that knife back and cut my throat daddy chop it up just like the the other sacrifices that have happened and we know that right when he was about to do it because God knew his heart he wasn't bluffing anymore he was so he must have been so frustrated and so much anxiety but he was still willing to follow through with it it was then in the moment then when he was willing to do it fully that God said Abraham just stop now I know Abraham that you love me but we know that it wasn't that God all of a sudden got this Revelation that Abraham loved him it was simply that God knew that now Abraham knew that he loved God it was all about understanding the Revelation and that's where he was able to say he's Jehovah Jireh he can provide he will always provide the need in the moment but it was only after the leadership of God that he got there if he would have said no way I had a conversation with my wife and she said nope you're not taking my son nope this is a promised son after all we went through with Hagar and all of that drama you want to take the promised son now the one that God gave us and you want to sacrifice no way unlikely she would have taken him because she knew how crazy her husband was likely she would have taken her son and shipped him off somewhere and hit him kept him done something to prevent it from happening because her husband was that fanatical but you know what when a husband truly is truly under the leadership of the Lord Jesus Christ he's going to look a little fanatical God's Gonna lead him and he's going to do things that people don't understand but that's the way God is and you know what I'm not going to say outside of the word of God just for the record Brothers if it's outside of the word of God there's something wrong there it's always going to be according to the word of God but it was only so he could receive the promise right that's what he was after he knew there was a promise in this son and it was way bigger than them and their family it was about the families of the Earth and and I think it's so fantastic to think about it when we have a family here today we're blessed because of that because of him because of his leadership because of his willingness to surrender to that leadership and you know what I'll throw this out there excuse me not the cough I apologize for getting excited but makes my voice a little hoarse um the leadership of the Lord call it the headship of the Lord we've got to be willing to surrender to the headship of the Lord we we've got to be willing to surrender to the headship of our husbands we've got to be willing to surrender to the headship of a pastor we've got to be willing to surrender to the headship in our lives if we're not willing to do that then we're not really going to be blessed according to the word because God's program is very clearly laid out if we don't follow his program we're not going to receive the blessing the full blessing and this is the dangerous part sometimes we can see a blessing in our life what we perceive to be a blessing but it can actually turn into a curse God can give us a lot of money in our lives and that's the age we live in right money is abundant we can go and borrow money we can get money if we need money we can get a job and and make money money is easy to get for the most part if you really want it it's not going to fall from Heaven it doesn't fall from Heaven you've got to run to get it especially in in the area that we live in you can't just walk and think you're going to get it but you know just getting money isn't a blessing of God getting money is actually going to be a bit of a curse because the more of it you get the more responsibility you've got and the more responsibility you've got the more pressure you've got and the more pressure you've got the more trouble you potentially have you can have situations where this money will start to control you instead of you controlling the money and that's why the word says the love of money is the root of all evil we don't want anything to get in the way of our sacrifice we want to be able to go right to the Mountaintop with our sacrifice with our promise with all the Revelation that we've got remember I I said that before when we talked about Abraham and going up to the Mountaintop with Isaac we talked about this we studied it a while ago and really I said this and I think it's the same way for us as Believers there's times in our lives where we've got to go right to the Mountaintop where it's just us and God and we've got to take everything that we think we know and sacrifice it unto God and say Lord just be it unto me according to your word I don't even understand what's going on in this situation it's making me weak in the knees it's making me wonder if you've really called me but you know when we get to that place which is that specialized place that he loves to get us to where we actually step right into the fire that's when the fourth man will turn up in the fire that's where he'll turn up and say now I know that you love me now I know for sure that you're willing to set aside all of the things that your father taught you all of the things from your family all of the traditions and reasonings and you're just willing to follow me now I know that you love me and that's when he'll come and serve communion but not until we get to that place in our lives we don't have true communion in our lives without leadership and and it might sound sound kind of crazy to be going this way but I I just it's I think it's really neat to to look at it and and you know we have to have leadership in our lives but the leadership has got to be according to the word in our lives and if we don't actually follow the leadership of the Lord and what is the leadership of the Lord leadership of the Lord is the person of Jesus Christ the message of the hour that we've been given we we we can have many different interpretations of it and say well you know what I can just go and listen to tapes or I can just go to this group over here that believes a slant of the message of the hour I can go to that group over there that believes a slant of the message of the hour but it's keeping me we don't believe that we should have fellowship with anybody else it's not actually following the word of God you know if you're dealing with an Infidel you're dealing with someone that's blatantly blatantly sinning the word of God says to not have fellowship with that person but someone who is worshiping under the same token that you're worshiping and to say that we're not Brethren how can you actually ever receive true communion with God when Abraham he saw that his his nephew went right down to Sodom how am I how would we be if we saw a son or a daughter of God go from the congregation right into sin would we go after him brother Bradham says we better go after them not turn our backs on them but if we bring them back and they won't be reconciled themselves that's where it comes to a place where you need to say you know maybe we just need to put some separation between us brother Branham says you ever put someone out from under the blood watch them then if they're truly a Son of God they'll come right back because they can't stand being out from under the blood who would want to be out from under the blood nobody would but who would want to put someone out from under the blood I don't think anybody would truly not it wouldn't be an exercise that we want I don't even know why I'm going there but it's it's interesting brothers and sisters we don't have true communion with the Lord without having leadership from the Lord and we can say all we want that we have leadership from the Lord but you know what talk is cheap and the proof is in the pudding are we able to live it that's what it comes down to we've got to be able to live the message of the hour and some people will say oh brother Barry there's no way that you can live the message of the hour because you've got all these dues and you've got all these don'ts and you've got all these other things in between you know what all of that stuff just follows just like the gifts when people want to put the gifts out front all of that stuff is supposed to follow you get Jesus Christ into your life where he justifies you where you recognize that he's Justified you that he has Sanctified you that he has already glorified in you then all of that stuff just follows suddenly you want to do the right thing suddenly you don't want to go to the bar rooms suddenly you don't want to start wearing revealing clothing suddenly you don't want to keep cutting your hair suddenly you just want to be in church suddenly different things start to happen in your life the Lord just cleanses you out you stirs you up you know I got into this scripture in Acts 19. let's just turn over to Acts 19. we've still got a little bit of time here it's amazing how it goes by I certainly love the leadership of the Lord and how he leads talking about leadership of the Lord the leadership of the Lord and how we have the leadership of the Lord has got to happen or we don't really have true communion looking at this story of the Vagabond Jews in Acts chapter 19. start reading with verse 13. these were people that were around the church and claiming to have leadership in their lives but not really having the communion verse 13 says uncertain of the Vagabond Jews exorcists took upon them to call over them that had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure You by Jesus whom Paul preacheth and there were seven sons of one Siva a Jew and a chief of the priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know on Paul I know but who are ye and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of the that house naked and wounded and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified talking about this scripture here how does this apply and and it I would say it applies in in the leadership of the Lord having the true leadership of the Lord here we have the sons of a Jew of Siva a Jew and a chief of the priests but yet his sons were misbehaving we're having this discussion about Eli and how his sons were misbehaving and when our sons are misbehaving according to the word it doesn't turn out right but to look at this scripture here they had leadership they they wanted to do the right thing they wanted to follow the word and they wanted to make a show of it they wanted to do their own thing they wanted to try and Castle the devils and and be the strong spiritual ones in the midst but but look at what happened to them because they were not willing to accept the full leadership of the Lord and what I want to say about that is they weren't willing to accept the leadership they weren't willing to fall under the ministry of the messenger for their age who was Paul they wanted to do it their own way they wanted to mingle it a little bit they wanted to take a little bit of their father's tradition maybe a little bit of whatever tradition in my case it would be a little bit of the Pentecostal tradition we'll just mix that in mingle it a little bit and and see if it would be okay put some speaking in tongues as the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost putting that out there first you know maybe just a little bit of that funny business and and what happened to them the evil spirit recognized it the evil spirit answered them and said Paul I know and Jesus I know but who are you and I just can't help but think about it brothers and sisters today in our age talking about the leadership of the Lord if we're not willing to actually accept the leadership of the Lord according to the messenger for our day according to the prophet for our day which would be the same as Paul because he preached what Paul preached he didn't mix it he didn't mingle it he didn't make it anything else he preached what Paul preached if we don't follow the word for our day but yet we pretend what can happen to us brothers and sisters this Spirit can leap on them the spirit leapt on them and and I was looking at this and and just marveling at it because I've often thought that this scripture would represent a maniac I think about the spirit that leapt on him and they left wounded and naked and and this is a maniac like the maniac of Galleria who had the the Fetters and the chains and and they couldn't bind him because of all the the Legion of devils that were in him you know I've always had that that concept but it just occurred to me you know what this was a religious devil if they're willing to try and and mix it with something else what happens to them then that religious devil leaps on them imagine brothers and sisters today if we try and mingle the message of the hour if we try and and pretend to actually go all the way but never go all the way just always have a little bit of reservation about the word for our day or about what God is doing in our midst if we have that reservation then what we're doing is we're mingling there's something going on there's some kind of funny business and and if we try and actually live the message of the hour from a mingled perspective watch out because a religious spirit can leap on you and what will it do it will thrash you and it will cause you to leave the house you'll leave the house wounded and naked believing that something bad was done to you and the only thing that was done to you is you just actually mingled the word you didn't actually allow the Lord to actually lead you all the way but if we're willing to let the Lord lead us all the way then we're never going to misbehave like these children did we're going to say be it unto me according to Paul's word because Paul preached what God wanted preached and we're going to say the same thing be it unto me according to William Miriam branham's word because he actually brought the word of God for our day he wasn't God but he introduced God and that's why we need brothers and sisters the god of the man you know this word Vagabond strongs G 40 22 is to come all around that is to stroll to facilitate veer fetch a compass Vagabond wandering about for me I just find it fascinating if we if we take it and run it as a a parallel to a maybe a Believer today and and think you know what maybe this isn't just a ravaging nasty Spirit that's that looks like a monster what if this is a religious spirit which it was it was it was it was from the priest the worst kind of spirit the one that will just ravage but never being able to just settle down always having the desire to to be a vagabond and just just go to to Veer never having a a solid foundation just just staying put and trusting God that God is in complete control never quite settled just a little bit uneasy you know Matthew 7 verse 17 it says even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but every corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is Hue and down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them not everyone that saith unto the Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven and and what is the will of My Father which is in heaven the will of My Father which is in heaven is the word for our day and and we can bring it even further down than that brothers and sisters I just believe it's what the Lord's been shown me on Wednesday nights get in our positions we need to be a father we need to be a husband we need to be a wife and we need to be a child and we need to be according to the word and if we're outside of the word then are we doing the will of Our Father in heaven we can come to church all we want we can quote the quotes all we want we we can we can have all the buzzwords all we want we can have all the Mysteries all the Deep things of the message of the hour but it's not going to do us one bit of good if we're out of our position if we're not following the word of God according to the word that's been given to us for our day then we're actually not serving the lord and you know brother Branham says it that there's going to be millions and billions of false Pretenders coming in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name and we cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity ye that know better but don't do it Ye Ye that know not to do it but still do it workers of iniquity I don't think he's talking about rank sinners in that message in in that scripture there you know Abraham he had a he had a real leadership of the Lord there's another leadership of the Lord that uh I want to get into but I don't know if we've got time today I I think you know what I'm just gonna I'm probably gonna press pause there today brothers and sisters we need to make sure that we know where we stand we know who we are so that we can actually receive true communion as we go forwards I want to talk about this communion that that Abraham had Abraham was given communion with Melchizedek Melchizedek brought him communion served him Bread and Wine There's real real significance to it as we go forwards I believe that uh we can see a whole bunch in that I uh maybe I'll call the musicians this morning I apologize we had a request for a baby dedication and I got a little sidetracked this morning but we will definitely do a baby dedication now maybe if you'll stand with me yeah brother Levi and sister Naomi we have the the baby dedication and we just want to uh we just want to bring the baby and dedicate the baby unto the Lord we have the ability brothers and sisters to go all the way right to the Mountaintop with our revelation and to see the the leadership of the Lord in our lives and to take what we have and try it remember Paul said that he died daily and what did that mean truly that he just died out to himself he would lay down his life and and and and all the things that he thought he knew but you know there's a lot of things in Paul's life that Paul had to deal with on a daily basis so that he could just get up and go and likely that was the persecution of the church and from his perspective likely it was all of his faults and failures he had to just let them die so that he could actually go forwards to be in his position and and if he didn't do that how would he ever be able to go forwards and have the confidence that he needed we need to do that ourselves to give the Lord leadership in our lives to just allow ourselves to not be completely beaten down by our faults and our failures and to allow them to rule us we we need to be able to look beyond that and recognize that God has done something so significant in our lives that Satan can't change it we can't change it we have been given such a wonderful gift in our day maybe let's just bow in prayer here a gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness to us Lord we thank you Father for the ability Lord Jesus to just to take your word the way that you've given it to us in our day father to not mingle it with anything father to not think that we could just take and and make it something that would suit us father but Lord you have positionally placed each one of us father to take your word the way that you have given it to us father and to apply it in our lives in such a way that it would actually bring that seed Gene from you from before the foundation of the world to life and Lord we thank you for it father we pray that

their commitment unto you father we just are thankful for Ethan Timothy we pray that we could dedicate him back to you this morning we ask that you would keep sickness from him Lord that you would
