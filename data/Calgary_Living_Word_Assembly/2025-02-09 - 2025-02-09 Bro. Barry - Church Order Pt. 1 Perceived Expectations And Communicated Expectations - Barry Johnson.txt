in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles this morning I just would like to read from first first Corinthians chap 11 First Corinthians chap 11 I have just one verse 1 Corinthians 11 verse 1 it says be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ this is the Apostle Paul speaking to the Corinthian Church and we know that he's not just speaking to the Corinthian Church he's speaking to Calgary Living Word Church he's speaking to any one that would read the scripture amen let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we pray that you would just bless the reading of this word that you would just minister to us father sovereignly today that we could just commit our hearts and our minds into your hands father that you would mold us and that you would shape us father and Lord if there's anything here today that would be contrary to you and your word father we pray that you would just take it from us Lord that we would just have a little space of time where you could minister to us sovereignly we love you Lord and we thank you we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated we just want to uh a couple of announcements we've got brother Cadre coming up this weekend service at 6 o'clock on Saturday and uh regular service Sunday morning at 10: a.m. we will have the youth uh service at our house afterwards we'll have lunch and then uh we'll discuss a few things with the youth there and certainly looking forward to that um we have a breakfast actually on Saturday morning for those people who are interested the brothers it's uh Men's breakfast um that will be at 10:00 a.m. and the details have been put out on the chat and if you don't have that any of the details and you would like to attend please by all means just reach out we want to make sure that you're a part of the chat and uh that you're invited to come so um on the 26th of February we will have the men's meeting the annual gen men's meeting here with the church so we will cancel the service it's a Wednesday night and uh we will meet in the basement and just go over all of the Relevant Church matters that we need to and then uh as I've mentioned in the past September 12th 13th and 14th we have brother Andrew Glover here and uh certainly looking forward to a wonderful time around the word in those days and we actually uh we were able to engineer these times so that we can actually have the majority of the people here I had scheduled it during the summer and kind of caught the tail end of August when people were going away and hopefully this time we can have as many people that would want to be a part of it be able to be a part of it and and not traveling but I know it's impossible to to make it work for everyone um we're all busy people and making plans so we certainly trust that you'll be able to make it and if you can't we certainly have the opportunity for you to stream or uh potentially listen later are you happy this morning amen amen certainly thankful for the opportunity to gather together again in his name um what I'd like to do today is uh just get into a little bit of church order I had mentioned in the past that it was something that I really wanted to do and uh I I really do want to do it so we're going to do it we're going to get into talking about church order and you know we're not just talking about the the Natural Things even though the Natural Things type the spiritual things you see the way people live their lives and the outward expression demonstrates what's going on on the inside and and that's just the way it is with humans with uh people and so when we're in the church we have uh we talked about it last week and I think it's really important I'm going to keep talking about it and I don't mean to do it in a in a way that makes people feel bad or uncomfortable it's just um it's important to make sure that we're having communication that that someone is talking and someone is listening and you know we're able to do that back and forth and and there's certain expectations that we do have for the house of the Lord and if we never communicate them then I think it's uh it's not really fair to expect anybody to behave any other way than they're used to behaving we come from many different walks many different backgrounds many different traditions and teachings even in the message of of the hour yes let's let's be honest one person on one side of the country might be taught something in the message of the hour that someone on the other side of the country could be taught something totally different what we want to do is walk right down the middle of the road and do exactly what the word says to do amen I think it's so beautiful the scripture that we read this morning out of 1 Corinthians chap 11 Paul who is the Apostle to the age he is the prophet to the age the age messenger his job was probably um maybe even the heaviest job out of all of the Apostles I'm not saying it is but maybe it was because he had to take and set the entire church in order according to the word and everybody had their own ideas they were coming out of Law and they needed to experience Grace but there was an order for that Grace to actually take place and that's what Paul was actually doing and that's why we have read this scripture here today I think it's so wonderful because really what Paul preached is what we believe that's the bottom line some people will say that we we we we're part of a cult that we follow a man William Mariam brandom and I'm I'm going to dig into that today a little bit I think it's really important to talk about it and I'm going to talk freely today so I trust that you'll bear with me in in maybe my Folly as we go forwards with it because it's important to be clear it's important to talk openly and honestly about this stuff so that there's an understanding of what's going on because many times people will hear oh William Bram who is that and what will they do immediately or and then whatever comes up is truth right that's the way it is now y people fact check I've even heard of people factchecking during the preaching not in this congregation for the record but I've heard it's a thing when you bring something and and you're saying that this is fact or this is what you know is what I believe or what I'm thinking or or feeling some people they're Skeptics and you know we live in a world where the whole world is skeptical and and even more so around people who are actually seeking the truth but remember brothers and sisters if you can find the truth the truth will make you free the truth will make you free and that's why we're here today I believe because we desire the truth we're not interested in false Doctrine we're not interested in getting hitched up with some kind of a cult or some kind of a a a thing where people are just going to be a part of an association that will put us into the path of Destruction that'll put us in the Great Tribulation we want to go on the Rapture and we're not screaming crying for the Rapture to come crying out Lord please hasten the day so we can have the Rapture what we want to do is fulfill the purpose that God's brought us here for we're all here for a purpose yes and who knows what that purpose is some some some purposes are are to be Apostles and and some are to be prophets and some are to be evangelists and and and and and we know there's gifts in the church right evangelists and teachers pastors we we all have a role to play and and some might say well you know I I don't fit that role at all I would say this brothers and sisters we're we're Kings and Priests according to God and especially the brothers we're pastors of our home we're pastors of our home we're the ones executing the office of the priest for our amilies and if we're not maybe we should take a look at it because our families are depending on it we're The Gatekeepers it's up to us to lay in the gate anyways uh talking about expectations and perceived versus communicated you know and the conduct in the house of the Lord in this house of the Lord just a few housekeeping items I just want to mention them continue to hold them before us brothers and sisters the basement is an extension of the sanctuary it is not a place to go and have a social Fair during the service it's not a place to have children running around with cars it's a place to just maybe take children that are a bit squirmy and maybe it's too hot in here whatever it is it needs to be an extension to the sanctuary we want to create an environment where we can go somewhere else with children so that if they're children in this Sanctuary that are squirming and and making noise and making a fuss you can pick them up and take them out and I would like to remind everyone to parents please be conscious of it because if your children are are fidgety and making noise it might be something that we're totally toned deaf to we could be completely used to that sound because that's what they do all the time but I I I think maybe sometimes in the house of the Lord people aren't aware that other people aren't used to that and when children are making little noises they can really irritate people and cause people to miss what's being said so I just want to encourage everyone the basement is an extension of the sanctuary please take your children down if they can't sit still in here or they need a drink or they need to go out you're welcome to go downstairs even if you feel a little bit warm in the service I'll say this too brothers and sisters if you're starting to feel sleepy it's a devil the devil wants you to go to sleep and not get what's coming out of the service if you start to feel a little sleepy just get up and go for a walk we have speakers in the washrooms for a purpose we have speakers in the basement for a purpose you can go and and and and just still be a part of the service even in the basement we just want to remind parents to monitor your children don't leave it to the deacon it's not their responsibility we're not one of those churches where you can just drop your children off in the basement and someone's going to watch them for you there's churches that are like that they're available if someone really needs that where they'll even give you a pager when you drop your child off this isn't the type of church that does that it's up to the parents to watch over your children so we just would like to ask that you please watch over your children and if they make a mess just clean it up for them and you know if you find a situation happens and you can or you're confused about the situation how to deal with it just ask a deacon the deacons will gladly assist you they're here for you we are all here for you and uh I hope that's okay I'm just going to continue to remind us and just trust that uh we'll just be able to be a blessing one to another in the house of the Lord as we go forwards you know we're uh talking about church order and uh basically I I just want to get into kind of what we believe and you know we listened to church order by William Mariam Branham in 1958 he preached this message it was uh number 107 and and we listen to it on a Wednesday night and I'm just going to pick through this and I'm going to take my time and go through through it real slow he preached another message on Church order and we'll go through that one and we'll pick our way through it where we need to but I just want to make sure that we all understand the direction that we're going each and every church is Sovereign we are not a part of an association there is no endorsement by any other church that gives us the ability to worship the way we do there is no separate um entity that actually funds this church this church is completely Sovereign it's governed independently excuse me by the the boards there's two boards one is the Deacon board the other one is the trustee board the deacons deal with the church matters the deacons are the call it spiritual leaders in the church that's an actual office in the church the lay Ministry is not an office in the church it's it's lay Ministry and there's wonderful gifts I'm not disput disputing that at all but the actual Church offices are the deacons and the trustees they're a part of what governs the church and I I just think it's wonderful brother Bram talks so clearly in these messages and we could just uh just press play and I feel like I could sit down he would say it much better than me but there's a couple things that I just want to really drill down into as we go forwards today you know brother bam he says in this message in uh Church order as mentioned 1958 17 he says we believe in an Apostolic Church teaching Apostolic blessings for peoples of this day I'm just going to go through sort of what he says we believe and then I'm going to come back and actually elaborate but I think there's a few things in here that are really important and uh it it's so good to hear this is what we believe brothers and sisters we believe in an Apostolic Church teaching Apostolic blessings for peoples of this day um we believe in the Full Gospel and believe that all the signs and wonders that was spoken of by our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his church until he returns not until someone says they should be over he goes on to say we believe in those things and believe that they are to be set in in order that the church has its order and that each church has its doctrines and Order and discipline he goes on to say our church has no members as joiners we believe that the whole Universal Church of the Living God is our brothers and our sisters isn't that beautiful I'm just going to skip down and talk a little bit about what he says in in the next paragraph he says we believe in justification by faith Romans 51 he goes on to say we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord and you know we talked about justification and sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost maybe I'll go back and read this paragraph I think it's important I hope it's okay if I do a lot of quoting today but I got a lot of talking that I want to do as well but I'd rather hear a Vindicated prophet's words than my words he says we believe in justification by faith Romans 5:1 we believe that after a person being justified by Faith remember that was Luther's protest he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ and many people are willing to just stop there and say Amen bless God I'm a Christian I'm a good person and and sure enough likely they are but it might not be enough to actually see the entire blessing the apostolic blessing that's in the church and so we have brother about I'm saying here but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh wait a second I thought I thought he said that that we believe in justification by faith Romans 51 we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ I've got peace with God I I know that he died for me and rose again on the third day and and and I've accepted him as my savior but I still just can't kick smoking I just don't understand it I just can't quit drinking I've got this thing where I I just have to have a little sip here and there and everywhere it just I can't get rid of it I just can't stop watching movies I can't stop scrolling I can't stop whatever it is in our life if you can't stop it brothers and sisters there's a problem we need to actually seek the Lord but you know we can live in this state here and be good people yes many people do it amen there's a furtherance to it we can have peace with God but it's possible that the same person could have habits such as drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord so we have the justification process and then we have the sanctification process brother bam says and that's we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13:12 and 13 maybe let's turn over there today let's turn to Hebrews 13 just so we understand what he's saying as he references these verses I trust that everyone's warm by the grace of God it's a pretty miserable drive in this morning but we're certainly thankful for his traveling mercies amen amen in Hebrews chapter 13 verses 12 and 13 wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate I I just love how he doesn't just read verse 12 it's not just the reference to verse 12 it's verse 13 as well let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach how important is that brothers and sisters to make sure that we're bearing his reproach not our reproach if we look at our reproach we're failed it's over our reproach is continual and Perpetual until the day that we actually change these Robes of flesh but if we're willing to bear his reproach he paid it all that we wouldn't have to right if we're willing to judge ourself according to his word then we shouldn't need to be judged right I think it's just a beautiful thing here he goes on to say I'll just read where I left off here any and and that's we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13:12 and 13 whereby Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gates and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age which we are now living that's the age in which we're in brothers and sisters it doesn't cease it's not going to cease until the Rapture of the bride goes home because when she goes up Satan comes down that's going to be the next major change in the dispensations we know there was a major change at Calvary when Christ came it was Major when Christ came but when he actually died and rose again and triumphed over death hell and the grave for our sake what he did was showed there was an open Triumph of the love the love of Jesus Christ for his bride the next one that's going to happen is the rapture of his bride the catching away of his wife brother bradam goes on to say and we also believe that after the person has been Sanctified first they've been Justified then they've been Sanctified the unclean habits has gone from the person he is a Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are gone we believe that he then is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit which comes as a filling of the believer and then when the believer dot dot dot I'm going to pause there I think it's important brothers and sisters to to to to just dwell on this for a second because I want to say this as a question I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand I'll say raise it in your heart how many people have been candidates for the Holy Ghost in their lives you know that you've been Justified you know that you've been Sanctified and I would say you know that you've even gone on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost but wait a second I still have habits in my life I can't get rid of how many people this morning hey the pastor here will raise his hand and say I've got things in my life that seem to never leave that seem to never I can never seem to conquer you know what Paul had things in his life too and he sought the Lord Thrice for it and what did the Lord say to him hey Paul you need to recognize that my grace is sufficient for you my grace doesn't give you the Liberty to make Grace a disgrace and continue sinning willfully but what it does is give you the opportunity to recognize that I've done at all it's got nothing to do with you the only thing you've got to do with it is to accept it Hallelujah hlj so we can be justified we can be Sanctified we can be filled with the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you what I want to say this brothers and sisters because I believe it with all my heart even though I still struggle in my heart in my life and my mind my mind is the worst place that's the the place the Devil comes and tries to get us but you know what I I I realize is it's not that we haven't been delivered we've been delivered every single time we cry out to Christ we've been delivered if we want to be he's already given it to us am the only thing is the Devil Comes around and says no you're not don't you remember how fun that is don't you remember how wonderful that is of an experience to do or whatever it is to think to say to act all of the stuff that we do as human beings and then suddenly we find ourselves doing it and then we're like see I know I don't have the Holy Ghost here I go again on this stupid cycle the best thing that we could ever do brothers and sisters is ignore our flesh ignore our problems make them right when we make them wrong because we do and we have to we've got to go and apologize we've got to submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God right if we're not willing to do that he can't help us that's right but when we're willing to do that if we can do it quickly why was David a man after God's Own Heart we had such I believe such a powerful prayer meeting on Thursday my goodness Hallelujah brothers and sisters why did David have the the description that he was a a man after God's Own Heart is because he repented quickly that's what the Vindicated Prophet said in our age he was quick to repent so he was a man after God's Own Heart he wanted to see the Lord in his life remember he was a murderer he was an adulterer he had all these things in his life that he had to to to witness and and say yep when someone come around and say you remember what you did he would have to say yeah yeah and it's wonderful because Paul would say yeah not me but the sin that lith in me that c nature that I can never Escape because it's in my DNA I just can't get rid of it but David was quick to repent right amen even when the prophet came to him and said hey you know there's this man he's got this problem in this Kingdom and he's got all this money he's got all everything in his life he's got at all and this's one person with this one Widow with this one little lamb and this guy with everything just had to go and take that little lamb what did David say that man should die that man deserves death that's what David said and the prophet turned to him and said That's you that's you David and what did he do he repented but think about it brothers and sisters this is the god that we serve this is a God that has a a a heart for his children he has a desire to see us come High think about it this Ahab who was married to Jezebel we know the story we know all about him and all the stories and how terrible he was and the backsliding condition remember when the prophet came and told him you're doomed for what you've done the dogs are going to lick your blood you will not make it back from Battle and and and we know what happened Ahab this rank sinner who had that wife Jezebel the word of God says that he walked softly before God he recognized oh my I know that God's real and I know that I'm a backslider but I'm just going to tiptoe because I know what's going on here the prophets actually said the word of God the prophet said thus saith the Lord to me concerning me and what happened God said hey I heard his his his testimony I've seen the way he's walked softly and I want you to tell him I'm not going to bring it back in his day but it's going to come out upon his children and that's where I think brothers and sisters we can live a good life here today but if we're not serving God with all of our heart if it's some sort of a hidden sin thing where we're just only going so far you know what's going to happen we might be fine but our children might not be our children might be the ones who bear the reproach for our sin we need to make sure we know exactly what we're doing and that's why I think it's so important to make sure that we establish the church on proper conduct order and Doctrine to get Church short are established properly we can assume that everybody understands courtship dating and marriage we can assume that everyone does but I promise you everyone doesn't understand what that means if we're dating in the message you're not in the message dating is not a word for believers because dating means you're going to go and try it out and see if it works and if it doesn't work well I'm just going to move on it doesn't matter no when we engage ourselves to have a conversation with one or the other a man or a woman it oughtn't to be a boy or a girl but it should be a man or a woman if we're going to do that then we ought to be doing it with all all of our heart we should be doing it with the full intent to be married with children with that individual and if we're not in that position we don't do it dating is not in the vocabulary of a Believer anyways courtship is carrying on what brother bramy says here we also believe that after the person has been Sanctified the unclean habits has gone from the person he is a Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are gone I can tell you brothers and sisters he'll take habits away he'll take the ones away that need to be away and he'll leave the ones that need to remind us about his grace that's what it comes down to he'll take the ones away that will drive us into the ground but he will leave just maybe one or two to remind us about his grace I think it's so important to remember that we're going to fight all the way to the rapture or we're going to fight all the way to hell we're going to fight brothers and sisters one way or another that's the life that we've been given so we might as well be on the winning side right brother bam goes on to say it's just as many times as I have taught it like picking up a glass out of the chicken yard if anybody's ever seen a chicken yard you'll know what he's saying it's filthy it's all full of manure and you have a glass that's left in a chicken yard it it just gets disgusting you'd probably never want to use it again although you could if if it wasn't cracked or broken and and You' be able to pick it up and justify it brother bam he says justification is picking it up ready to use it with a purpose in heart that's what God does to The Sinner but he's still filthy then he excuse me then he is cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a compound word which means cleaned and set aside for service in the old Testament the altar Sanctified The Vessel and it was set aside for service he goes on to say this is probably one of the most important parts brothers and sisters because it can sound like justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost you're climbing steps you're going up the stairs the ladder you're trying to get to the next level it's not a video game we're not trying to go on an adventure it's not our our our our actions don't actually caused us to be Believers because we're Believers we have actions it's very important to remember this brother bam he says we believe the holy spirit is putting the same vessel in service we don't become a new vessel and that's why the devil tries to play so hard on us to say look at you you're the old guy you're the old girl you're the same person nothing's happened in your life something's truly happened in our lives when we've been Justified and we've been Sanctified brother bramy said says this and I think it's so important to remember that the holy spirit is not another step of Grace right many times it's taught that way in the denominations and sometimes even in around the message it's taught that way it's not that way we have the prophet for our day saying we believe the holy spirit is putting the same vessel in service that the holy spirit is not another step of Grace but more of the same Grace more of the same Grace that picks the glass up out of the chicken yard more of the same Grace that brings that chicken Yard glass to church to become Washed by the Water of the disinfecting word from all of the filth of this world that's why we come to church to get Washed by the Water of the word amen but it's more of the same Grace that fills the believer to the extent where that signs and wonders such as the apostolic gift spoken in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 manifest themselves through this believer when the Holy Spirit comes to take up the gift let's turn back over to First Corinthians chapter 12 just so we make sure we're on the same page with what he's talking about it's beautiful here I love it because both of the footnotes or the header notes in my Bible it says spiritual gifts on both pages spiritual gifts are important brother bam or sorry the word in chapter 12 1 Corinthians 12:1 it says now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant isn't that beautiful we should understand spiritual gifts it shouldn't be something that we don't know that we're not aware of properly he says ye know that you were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb Idols even as ye were LED how many were a gentile carried away unto a dumb Idol I can say that I was I I went out into the Wilderness I had to be led away and have some dumb Idols in my life he goes on to say wherefore I gave you to understand I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed so nobody speaking by the spirit of God is going to curse jesus' name and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost isn't it beautiful the perspective we've been given as Believers of this message understanding the message is Jesus Christ we're believing Jesus Christ we're believing every single word of this Bible that's our absolute that's our reference point we go back to the prophet all the time but the prophet goes to the Bible that's why we do it but you know nobody is going to be able to say Lord without having the Holy Ghost in their life nobody many people are going to say Lord but many are going to go to you know the scripture many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord have we not cast out devils in thy name haven't we seen many wonderful Mighty works and had many prayer services and song services and all the different services oh my we had such a wonderful life of Christianity believing the message of the hour down there didn't we and he's going to say depart from me because you worked iniquity and I never even knew you you weren't willing to actually go all the way to calling me Lord from your heart we know that the word says that many times people will say it with their lips but their hearts are far from them we need to know where we stand brothers and sisters and all it takes is just complete surrender to the to to the Lord to be able to call him Lord means that he governs every aspect of Our Lives not most of them not some of them but every aspect of Our Lives Hallelujah show some something in there whatever you want to say every aspect of Our Lives when he's in that position of Our Lives then he's Lord until he's in that position of Our Lives he ain't Lord we're just calling him Lord it sounds good we've been taught that it's a tradition he needs to govern every single area of our lives and you know I'm I'm saying this in such a way that I'm saying Lord help me all the way along here cuz I know me I know where I stand I know the struggles I have we're all humans brothers and sisters we're all sinners saved by grace the only thing that's absolute is his word am the only way we can call him Lord is by the Holy Ghost now where there are diversities of gifts but it's the same spirit and until we can recognize this we're going to be bumbling around and and mixing stuff up and and be being confused it's going to sound different I mean who is God and who is Jesus and who's the Holy Ghost what's all this this about it wasn't until I heard about the message of the hour that I actually caught the revelation of who Jesus Christ really is I'm not going to say was I'm going to say is because he's just alive today as he ever was but I'll tell you honestly where I caught the Revelation was watching the movie called The Gospel of John and it was such an interesting time in my life I can say it because it was just my testimony and I'm sure everyone would have an opportunity given the microphone to have their testimony about when they understood this this very specific point but I just saw Jesus walking on the shoreline it was right at the end of the movie I think it was when John or they were saying you know I can't remember how the the scripture goes I'm making it confusing but anyways Jesus was walking on the shore and and he said what's it to you about whether he's here till I come or not don't worry about that just follow me what is it to you and many times we can get caught up looking at one another wondering is that for them are they supposed to be doing that should they be acting that way what is it to us brothers and sisters just follow [Music] Christ but it was during that movie that I caught the Revelation that's not a man walking on that Shoreline that's not just an ordinary man that's God Amen that's God in flesh and we can read it all a hundred times over maybe our lifetime in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Jesus Christ is God and it's it's it's it's a beautiful thing it becomes so easy many times the scholars will make it so confusing to say the father is this and the son is that and the Holy Ghost is the other they're not three persons of the Holy Trinity brothers and sisters they're all different offices of The Same Spirit the same God God manifest in three different ways and morphe is the word that was used in the message of the hour God just changing a mask it's just like a person playing three different parts in a play sometimes they'll wear a mask that looks a certain way and they'll go off the stage and get another mask and come back in and they'll play a different role with different words it's the same thing brother Bram goes on to say we believe that the holy spirit is putting the same vessel in service that the holy spirit is not another step of Grace but more of the same Grace that fills the believer to the extent where that signs and wonders such as the apostolic gift spoken in 1 Corinthians 12 manifest themselves through this believer not through the pastor not through the teacher not through the Evangelist even though all of that happens but through this believer the one that gets filled with the Holy Ghost right I think it's so beautiful um we'll carry on here in the scripture now there are diversities of gifts this is verse 4 of 1 Corinthians CH 12 diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all right for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another learning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues now this one this really blew me away when I realized all of this in my spiritual walk because I was raised to believe that really the the the fruit of the spirit is the ability to speak in tongues period not even interpretation of tongues but still there's all these other gifts that are a part of it hey isn't that wonderful verse 11 says but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit the Holy Ghost dividing to every man severly as he will for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or gentiles Iles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many I could go on here for the sake of time I'm not going to he talks about if the foot shall say I'm not the hand and we need every single part of the body brothers and sisters we don't want to look at our pinky toe and say you stink get lost we need our pinky toe we need our nose we need our ears we need every single part of the body it's it's vital to the church that every single part of the body is here and that's why I think brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us the more so even more so as we see the day approaching if we see a brother or sister that's just not around maybe they're just stumbling maybe for some reason they're not in service reach out to them encourage them send them a text we all need each other none of us are getting out of here until we're all come into the the unity of the spirit brothers and sisters he goes on to say I believe that the scripture teaches that gifts and callings are without repentance and isn't that true you can look at someone like Elvis Presley he speaks about Elvis Presley he says he sold his soul for a fleet of Cadillacs he had the gift there that gift was from birth before the foundation of the world and he could have chosen to use it for God for the glory of God or give it over to the devil and unfortunately that's what he chose to do he gave it over to the devil and I Marvel brothers and sisters at how many gifts we have in the body here how many gifts in the body of Believers worldwide that could easily just walk right into a record label and get signed right now without having any training or anything else just exactly as they are but they're not using it for the devil they're using it for the the kingdom of the Lord what an amazing thing it is amen I have no doubt there's Believers in even in this congregation that have that quality of music that quality of singing it it's the way it is and you know we all have gifts every one of us just because you have a musical gift it doesn't make it more important than someone who has the gift of wisdom and someone who has the gift of Prophecy someone who has the gift of healing someone who has the gift of tongues or interpretation there's those those gifts are in the body for a purpose he says I believe that that scripture teaches that gifts and callings are without repentance that when we are born in this world we are sent here by one purpose that is of god and that therefore we are even become adults before we are even become adults while we are yet children the gifts that we have of God is in US then isn't that beautiful and only the filling of the Holy Spirit puts these gifts into operation because if we've been given a gift which we have every one of us has nobody has has has not been given a gift is just a void person that's just here floating around is an empty Spirit no no that's not the way God does it every single person has a gift everyone I think it's beautiful that that's the way he does it he goes on to say but we have them in the beginning the gifts such as teachers and apostles and Prophets and Gifts of tongues and the nine spiritual gifts according to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 they're already there it just behooves us to make sure that we've got the Holy Ghost so we can see those gifts operate properly so that we can see those gifts develop properly it's important for the children to learn how to play instruments in church if anybody has a gift I want to say it this way if anybody has a gift as a child they've been learning to play the piano for the last 10 years and it's just a secret nobody knows about it by all means let me know let a deacon know let somebody know we we want to see that happen in fact moving forward we are we've talked about it as deacons we're going to have some musical Gatherings with the children and opportunities for them to bring their gifts and have church because you know brothers and sisters the Lord could decide to T for a few more years we don't know that some people want to say sure enough he is nobody's given me their Cadillac keys yet but if you have any I'd be happy to take them I'm just joking because I don't want to be here to drive it if the Church of the Living God goes home it's a joke about brother Bram he said you know someone offered their Cadillac Keys you know maybe that was import taste forgive me but brothers and sisters we have the ability to actually train them up in the way they should go and it's not just to get them saved we need to remember that if the Lord should T we could pass away who's going to be looking after the church who's going to be playing the piano who's going to be playing the guitars who's going to be playing the organ who's going to be doing the sound who's going to be leading songs who's going to be ministering if the Lord should T it's a very real thing and it would be very foolish of us to think that we should just not worry about it because God's just going to raise them up or it's like saying we're just not going to worry about it God's going to raise our children up we don't have to do that no no no we're the stewards of our children it it behooves us to make sure that we're teaching them properly amen amen just like in the house of the Lord the children are the next generation of Believers that's why Church order is so important to know how to do it so anyways if there's anybody with a gift that you would like to express as a child don't be bashful come and see me let me know will certainly make room for you says I believe that the scripture teaches that gifts and callings are without repentance and that when we are born in this world we are sent here with one purpose that is of god and that before we are even become adults while we are yet children the gifts that we have of God is in us then so those gifts are right here right now Brothers and Sisters Let's develop them and only the filling of the Holy Spirit puts these gifts into oper ation that's why anybody that plays up here needs to have the Holy Ghost in their life we need to know that the people who are actually playing as a gift or leading songs as a gift or preaching as a gift has the Holy Ghost in their life he goes on to say but we have them in the beginning such as teachers Apostles and Prophets and Gifts of tongues the nine spiritual gifts according to 1 Corinthians CH 12 now we believe that these gifts are in operation today and they should be in every local church so what gifts if you wonder this go back and study 1 Corinthians chapter 12 my we should be seeing according to what the prophet says here the word of wisdom the word of knowledge Faith Gifts of healing working of Miracles if you wonder if the Miracles are happening brothers and sisters come to a prayer meeting in here the testimonies are coming forward amen out of these prayer meetings amen it's amazing if you've got a need don't miss a prayer meeting they're powerful to another prophecy Discerning of gifts diverse kinds of tongues and interpretation of tongues all of those things are what he's saying here now we believe that these gifts are in operation today and they should be in every local church it's not something for us to be afraid of brothers and sisters if someone would speak out in tongues and someone would interpret there is an exact order for it to happen and as we advance in our study with this church order we'll definitely drill down in the operation of speaking in tongues there's a very specific order for it it it's not as we spoke on Wednesday is it called Galia it's not just talking to you and then all of a sudden I would just bust out in speaking in tongue some other language something something say confusion is what Paul said unless there's an interpretation there has to be an a proper order according to the word I'm so thankful that there is a proper order according to the word and and a prophet that would come and set the church in order take it back to where it's supposed to be all of these gifts should be in operation in every local church although in such we have found throughout the world that there's much fanaticism hooked along with people who profess to be Apostolic Believers now brothers and sisters I'm going to just take us and step aside from there a little bit and I'm not going to try and add to or take away from don't get me wrong I just want to change our perspective just want to change our perspective a little bit and and say that we have seen much fanaticism hooked along with the people who profess to be message believers now this is where I said at the very beginning I hope you can bear with me I'm going to really drill down on this and I'm going to be very clear it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to know exactly what's right and exactly what's wrong it's not going to be something that somebody can do for us because the word of God says it's going to be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so this fanaticism brothers and sisters and and I know I'm preaching to the choir if you've been in the message for any amount of time you've seen fanaticism around the message and what happens is it causes a train wreck and people's lives we're just going to call it straight what it is is it's a devil because it's either good or it's evil so anyways we have have the prophet here saying although we have we have found throughout the world that there is much fanaticism hooked along with the people who profess to be Apostolic Believers or message believers they profess it brothers and sisters there's a difference between professing something and actually living something the professor is the one that just continually professes it but the one who's living it is the one that's doing it they're the ones that are actually got their shoulder to the wheel and doing it just as they are in other orders and so forth we have Fanatics I I want to be a fanatic myself if you listen to the message the Oddball brother bam talks about that guy wearing the sign right he's wearing the sandwich board and he's walking up and down the Boulevard and one side of it says I I'm a fool for Christ I'm a fool for Christ and people look at it and Scorn them maybe and the other side of the sandwich board says who fool are you cuz we're going to be a fool for someone in this world we're going to serve a dumb Idol or we're going to serve the Living God and it's just that simple it's life or it's death there's no middle ground no inet and that's just the way it is unfortunately but that's exactly the word that we believe I think it's so beautiful so there's much fanaticism hooked along with the people who profess to be a Apostolic Believers and the apostolic believer what is that brothers and sisters I'm going to go back into my notes and really start preaching what my notes are I haven't even gotten into my notes today but we're just sort of skipping across the pond as I say many times just sort of hitting the highlights and we're going to take our time with this if we've got to come back we will but what is an Apostolic believer one who has all these signs believing that all these signs are in operation in the church that's an Apostolic believer they won't get upset because they see speaking in tongues and interpretation they believe in wisdom they believe in healing they believe in miracles they believe in knowledge they believe in the nine spiritual gifts that's an Apostolic believer just as they are in other orders and so forth we have Fanatics that's been all along we've had had these Through the Ages they had it in the apostolic day and as Paul said there that how some had come and persuaded them away after other doctrines and so forth I want to say this brothers and sisters it's possible to have other doctrines that can actually persuade people away from the truth and it's not that somebody would come and preach any other gospel it's that they would preach the gospel and live another one when that's happening that's exactly what Paul is talking about here exactly what the prophet's talking about here we can persuade people away from the truth by preaching something and living something else he says but in his own teaching he said if an angel from heaven would teach anything else than what he had taught let him be a cursed so remember brother Bram said it I believe the Holy Ghost through brother Bram the Vindicated Prophet the church age messenger the seventh angel messenger the Holy Ghost said that our lives that we live preach the loudest sermon that would ever be preached we can say all we want but but our lives speak volumes and you know it's interesting because he even said this too that our thoughts are louder in heaven than our voices here on Earth but in his own teaching he said if an angel from heaven would teach anything else then what he had taught let him be cursed Paul was setting the church in order he says so we as the Bram Tabernacle at 8 and Penn Street here he's talking to his church there but I think we could say the same here we here at Calgary Living Word try to follow the teachings of the New Testament for we believe that Jesus Christ being the Son of God and Paul the Apostle was called and chosen vessel by election of God to be sent to the Gentile Church to set it in order and we know we had seven Church age Messengers we've gone through it there's the exposition of the seven Church Ages which is the study of the church ages as laid out in the Book of Revelations chapter 2 and Chapter 3 The the church ages are laid out there and and brother bradam he he wrote the book about it we know we've been studying it on Wednesday nights but you know there was a church age messenger at the beginning to set the church in order and there was a church AG messenger at the ending to put the church in order isn't it wonderful Hallelujah the Capstone Ministry of the church to actually set it right in order and we know that it was just exactly the same as John the Baptist it was to set the church in order because there was one coming he was the one voice crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord that's what John the Baptist was set for and to be able to baptize Jesus to introduce Jesus to the world we know that that's why he came a and so he did but there was another John the Baptist with an Elijah anointing I'm going off on a tangent here but that Elijah anointing happened with brother Bram and what did he do he set the church in order to and he said Behold the Lamb of God I have come to make a way for the Lord and he didn't even say that we know that a star came down ball of fire and said you know as John the Baptist was sent to forth on the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so your ministry has been sent to forerun the second coming of the Lord amen and now now God's chosen to take him off the scene and we know that he said the two of us won't be standing here if what I think is going on is happening the two of us won't be standing here because isn't it interesting that God doesn't just explain it all to us right he doesn't give us all the answers he gives us his word and we have to try and stumble our way along just by his word amen but it's beautiful because we don't have to stumble if we're willing to just go all the way and call him Lord and let the Holy Ghost rule over our lives if we're willing to do that then we're able to actually see the full manifestation of the word in our lives and we don't have to hiccup along we don't have to stumble around we're not groping in darkness I think it's just beautiful he he he he was to be sent to set the Gentile Church in order carrying on here he says now we believe in water baptism another big one so all of these we're going to actually drill down into and preach on I hope it's okay it's it's maybe just a little bit but I'm probably not going to try and hold us on a three-hour service today which I think I could I feel inspired enough to do it but we'll uh we'll just see how the Lord leads now we believe in water baptism in the Bram Tabernacle by immersing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen which is the apostolic teaching of the Bible and I just love how simp brother brownon made it when he brought this Doctrine to the denominational world he said show me anywhere in the Bible where they actually baptize people in the name of the father and in the name of the son and in the name of the Holy Ghost we can show you where he baptized in the where they baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but it was never once done recorded in the Bible in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost even though Jesus told his disciples to do that but why did he tell his disciples to do that because they knew Jesus they knew his name they knew his voice they knew who he was they didn't have to be told that he's some father Jesus wasn't a father and we know there's deceiving spirits that have gone out in the world that say that he was and that he was married and that he wanted to be and you know it's all doctrines of devils he wasn't a father he was the son he was the manifestation of God in flesh the way that God chose to condescend from his absolute Glory down to a way that human beings could potentially begin to conceive a man called Jesus who is God manifest In the Flesh before his time who could speak to a storm right before his time who could make bread from bread who could make fish from Fish before his time who could go in and raise gyrus his daughter before his time who could actually say wow I haven't seen Faith such as this in all Israel just go home your servant is well before his time who could go and walk to the just ignore the people calling him saying you know what Lazarus is dead you got to come our brother our buddy come come come we know you can help him but he said you know I I'm a little tired I got to just take some time and and relax here I wonder I can't imagine that would have been an easy thing for Jesus to do I mean sure some would say well he was God but he was all man too remember when the people were calling him and he knew that he had the ability to speak to the storm to to raise people from the dead when they were saying his best friend Lazarus was dead oh my Mary and Martha were upset you know if you would have been here came four days too late why would you do that totally disappointed us and what did he say this happened so that I could show you who I am people would say you know what he he was just a man he was just man because he had emotion he cried but that wasn't a man that put his shoulders back according to the prophet and spoke Lazarus come forth that was all God brothers and sisters and he came for that purpose to demonstrate who he was I I think it's just magnificent when we catch the revelation of Jesus truly being God and there's no need to try and chop them into pieces and explain there's this personality and there's this personality and there's that personality and they all should behave in certain ways because they're separate persons and all that business it makes it confusing the devil's in the details he loves the details if we could just accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and savior who could be our Lord and savior but God yes sir we believe in water baptism in the Bram Tabernacle by immersing In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ which is the apostolic teaching of the Bible and many all members and or comers to the Bram Tabernacle who desire such May at any time requesting to be immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus May consult the pastor and if they have repented and Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ the pastor will as soon as possible even then if he can baptize them immediately this does not bring them into the fellowship of Believers We Believe sorry this does bring them into the fellowship of Believers we believe that water baptism by water baptism we are brought into a fellowship and I would say the fellowship we are brought into the fellowship and we could you know say where he says at at Bram Tabernacle we could say Calgary Living Word right there if you desire to be baptized we we have a pool downstairs and we have stuff ready if you want to be baptized amen amen we've done it that way to make sure that we can we we like to say you know we'll uh fire up the pool and next week we can do it but if somebody just has the desire to get baptize we can do it on the spot no problem so just so you know I think it's so beautiful but by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we are brought into the members being members of the body of Jesus Christ which is all over the world now another thing that we believe that the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all now we believe that when these gifts and so forth are operating in the church which we covet and desire that the people who are gifted by the Spirit come and worship with us I think it's beautiful he sets all of this in motion I'm going to stop reading the actual the actual uh message and now I'm going to open my notes you know in what we believe brothers and sisters the pattern that was established it it was set according to the Apostle Paul and it's beautiful because when we read that scripture that said you know if we or an angel from heaven come and preach any other thing than what we've already preached I think it's so important for us to catch that part what's already been said is what needs to be said if we're bringing a new doctrine into the church we're actually into something wrong because no angel messenger no Prophet no speaking in tongues no Pastor no evangelist nobody is going to preach anything who is a True Believer of this word is going to preach anything contrary to the this word every single one of them if they are Spirit-filled calling him Lord Jesus Christ in their life they're going to preach what Paul preached am amen and it doesn't matter how many people do something differently I want to say this brothers and sisters I think it needs to be said very clearly we could have 20 different message churches doing something different than what this message says it makes it wrong if it's doing it different than what this message says if it's doing different than what the word says it doesn't matter how many churches around the world whatever their denomination is if they're doing it just because many people do it don't make it right it's got to be according to the word and I I'll say this you know one really big one that's very popular these days not in the message for the record but what's very popular is a woman preacher the word says not to do it because what she's doing is usurping Spiritual Authority the word says not to do it so where did it change where did it become okay the only way that happened was because one person somewhere along the way said it's okay we can do it and then somebody else said well they're doing it so we must be able to do it it's it's it should be fine I mean we see manifestation of the spirit right we see gifts and tongues remember the devil can impersonate any one of the gifts any one of these gifts that we just mentioned the devil can impersonate this is where it becomes so close it would deceive the very elected if it were possible the only way we're going to be able to know the difference is to have the Holy Ghost in our life the only way we're going to know the difference is to make sure that when those gifts are operating they're operating according to the word in proper Church order amen and that's why I think it's so important for us to make sure that we're just taking our time we're not russing we're making sure that we're just taking our time to explain this and what I want to do is ex is is just mention this too brothers and sisters I think it's very important if we have questions about this please write them down contact us let's talk about it I'll take the question and and preach a sermon on the question I I think it's important for us it could be children it could be adults it can be anybody if you hear my voice and you got a question send the question and let's let's talk about this it's so important for us to make sure we know where we stand but Paul he said to the church he only said what was already said he didn't bring a new doctrine he was just trying to set the church in order out of Galatians 1:8 it says but though we are an angel from heaven my angel from heaven could you imagine that preach any other gospel unto you than what we have preached unto you then what you've already heard let him be a curse verse n says and as we said before so say I now again if you didn't get it the first time catch it now if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be a cursed that's why I think it's so beautiful beautiful let's take a look at what brother branam actually said and you know what's amazing I love it this is the way the Lord does stuff I'm only just starting to get into the notes that I had planned for today I I wanted to get into the the message that we were talking about but if we could just part on one thing there's like we're almost at noon and I don't want to hold us because I know we've got commitments today and I don't want to rush this either the exposition of the seven Church ages out of the resume of the ages what what did Brother Bram say this man who we listen to who we call the seventh angel messenger who who who was the manifestation of the scripture Revelations 10:7 Malachi 45 and 6 behold I send you Elijah before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord what did he actually say if you type in Google William Mariam Bram you're going to get all of the Google stuff and we know for sure that you can't trust Google we got into this discussion we were hunting it's so good who who in the right mind would say I've got this problem in my life and I'm only only going to go to Google and self- diagnose my problem with my health by someone who has posted something on on some website to say that if you have this then you should do that who's going to trust that with their life we're all going to go to the doctor we're going to go and Trust our health with the doctor why would we trust our spiritual well-being with Google right it doesn't make any sense our Eternal rest we're going to base it on Google on a Google search seriously what about Revelation by the spirit what did this guy say though many times people will say we just follow a guy what did he say let's listen to it if we just followed the guy let's just take it naturally and say well if we're just following a guy what did he say to do he says not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they can that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization yes I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied this is what he said right that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and man wherein men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him but we know that we live in the midst of a leoan church age where I am rich I'm increased with goods and I have need of nothing many times we've got degrees under our belt on our walls we have earned the right to have what we have I've worked really hard many years to be able to earn what I earn I've got a tremendous portfolio I'm rich I'm increased with goods and I don't need nothing there's nothing you could tell me there's nothing you could give me sure enough that's the age in which we live in others they've done nothing they're bums their whole life but their parents worked hard and their parents passed away and transfer all the wealth to them now they're loaded they're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing but we have the Lord saying I challenge you to just buy of me gold that's DED in the fire a real character one that actually went to the cross that took all of the reproach that we got from the scripture that we read this morning and took it and bore it for your shame if we would just do that that's the age in which we live in brothers and sisters that's the spirit that's combating us you know the brother Prophet said that it's important for us to recognize the tactics of our enemy that's right that's a major tactic that he uses is to get us get us so that we've got it going on right we've got the portfolio everything's good in our life man what do we need we need Christ we need Christ more now than we've ever needed him oh my I think it's so beautiful so those are the words that he said those are the words that he said and I'm going to part on these words because I think it's real good we'll pick up from here next time and uh and really carry on with this because I think it's that important and I'm going to cause some questions here I know it there's going to be a stirring we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ here brothers and sisters we don't have to be afraid don't get nervous when I talk like I'm going to I'm going to mention what is a cult I know it gets to be a bit much when we're talking this way but I think it's important children remember there's three types of Believers in every Church we're not we're not ignorant as we read in the scripture he would not have that we're ignorant brother Bram told us there's three types of Believers in the church it's important to remember that there's there's the Believers the make Believers and the unbelievers who they are that's up to God brothers and sisters it's not up to us don't look at any human being and say they're that or they're that as soon as you start doing that I want to say you're that I was judging people as Christians to be weak but when brother Aaron mcir witnessed to me he said by the way you're calling people Hypocrites is causing you yourself to be one because there cannot be a real or a false without their first being a real there has to be someone who is genuine and even though there's a lot of people who are make Believers and and unbelievers and impersonators There's real Believers and I I was like wow I don't want to be a hypocrite I don't want to be judging people like that it was enough to get my attention to say well there's got to be a genuine I might as well stop and take a look at it and I can say for me that was my burning bush I was like man that bush ain't being consumed I got to go check this out but when I went in the first thing I saw was a picture of a man with a halo over his head and I was like there it is it's a cult that was my original human reaction but remember brothers and sisters it was that service July 27th 2005 that I heard my pastor preach and I got saved like I've never been saved before I never thought I would would ever be able to be saved but in that service the words that were spoken were the words that needed to be said to unlock the spirit in my life amen amen so we can have all the opinions we want when it's the time appointed of the father there ain't nothing going to stop him from moving just apply the token to your homes brothers and sisters put the token on your children put the token on your marriage put the token on your church put the token on your job apply the token the way we're supposed to the def of a cult if you just type it into Google which is what I did I'm going to be honest definition of a cult so this could be wrong but I don't think it is I think it's going to be popular opinion is going to be based around this right cult cult definition is a cult is a is a small group of people who have extreme beliefs and practices that are considered strange or Dangerous by others and you know it's interesting because if we look at what Paul preached in the world in which we live it looks strange and maybe even dangerous to some doesn't it oh my and you know there's some people even in churches that want to just gather together there's some people that are are insistent that we just drink communion out of one cup now it's getting down to the Brass tax because here we're actually using separate cups all because of Co right but I'm one that never wants to live on the dangerous side now I'm not saying that the spirit of God isn't able to sanctify that cup I'm really stepping in it now aren't I but I think it's important brothers and sisters we need to know where we stand we need to know who we are I'm not interested as the leader maybe of this church to try and take us down a dangerous path and say you need to drink out of one cup and if you don't you're not a Believer that's getting culty listen to the characteristics Cults are often controlling and manipulative and can isolate members from the outside world my you ever heard of anybody in the message stopping people from seeing their families oh my if you don't follow me you're lost I've got the keys to the kingdom God's given me a greater Revelation than anyone on and on and on you can go right you ever heard that before how many people here feel like you're being controlled or manipulated how many people here are being told that you need to isolate from other members of your family or the outside world how are you ever going to be able to witness to people if you don't W go and live your life the world that we live in amen we have to work in this world we got to go to school in this world we have to have friends we have to have neighbors do we talk to our neighbors or are we just like oh there's a neighbor there I don't want them to see that I'm going to church now or whatever whatever whatever or even worse oh my look at that scuzzy person they don't believe what I believe my goodness are we ever good and what we do but those people over there they're always doing this or that or the other you know but for the grace of God there go go ey that's the word of God the the way that we're we're we're created we would be right there with them if we didn't have ears to hear what this spirit says but Cults are often controlling manipulative and can isolate members from the outside world some of the characteristics the leader this really got me going this morning I think it's good Cults are usually led by charismatic figure who is worshiped by members I'm so thankful that I'm not that charismatic and I I'm sure that nobody's worshiping me and if you are repent I'm telling you I ain't nothing to worship I I will actually myself brothers and sisters now I'm not joking I'll lead you to hell if you try and worship me you need to worship Jesus Christ amen I need to worship Jesus Christ if anybody ever says you got to worship anything else you know they're a lying Spirit Cults are usually led by charismatic figure who is worshiped by members beliefs Cults have unusual or extreme religious spiritual or philosophical beliefs once again you take a look at the way the world is versus what Paul taught and it looks that way you could say whoa there's some unusual things some unusual behavior not a woman preacher wearing pants cutting hair it's it's all these different things that's a bit weird it's a bit hard on women isn't it and because of that it seems to be unusual and extreme and it's all religious and spiritual and philosophical it's the word of God that's what Paul preached that's it is and you know if you want to see it alls you have to do I believe is uh go back to uh 1 Corinthians chapter 11 where we read and that actually talks about the behavior of a woman in a church and how she should be and remember that feminine is an example of the church Jesus the Lord God Almighty is the masculine the church is the feminine the husband is the masculine the wife is the feminine that's the way it works anyways uh it goes on to say here in our our definition of a cult in in terms of characteristics isolation Cults can isolate members from their friends and families and what it does is it causes control coercion Cults can use brainwashing gaslighting and other Psych ological manipulation tactics to control members hostility Cults can be hostile to people who are not members and I say Lord help us have you ever seen someone in the message I'm just going to say it straight you ever seen someone in around the message who is hostile towards another message Church they don't see it the way that we see it they're Canon fodder serpent seed unwise virgin at best when you hear people talking like that you know what's going going on but it doesn't mean we need to actually come and have a fight with them either we can actually be wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove we can say Lord have mercy help that person they're obviously maybe not as mature as they could be because a Believer is going to say it that way they're not going to say Well they're not as mature as me my goodness I've got a message PhD I've got the holy ghost in my life I'm not like that you know as soon as we start doing that we are but Cults can be hostile to people people who are not members and that's not what we are there there's no no Creed but Christ there's no law but love amen and the only book that we have is the Bible even though we reference the message of the hour the message points to the Bible I just had one other thing that I'm going to bring out here because I want to talk about this more I'm going to I fully intend to and uh hopefully we can get some questions because remember we can preach all we want but what do our live show he says or it says here in this uh definition from Google the coercion Cults can use brainwashing gaslighting and other psychological manipulation tactics to control members sure enough Cults do that if you look around and you see some of the Cults I'm sure people have heard about different Cults I'm not going to get into naming them but you know we we can see the the brainwashing it happens I I would say that if this is a cult I'm I'm totally brainwashed into it because the garbage that was in my brain before it's not there now when Christ came into my life he washed my brain of all the stuff that I was interested in my heart's desire is no longer the same so I could say that I've been brainwashed but I know one thing is for sure I have not been gaslighted have you have you ever heard gaslighting I had to look it up I've heard it mentioned a lot and I thought I understood it at one point but I had to look it up and so I got another one of these Google uh definitions here I think it's important gaslighting is a type of psychological manipulation if there's any psychological manipulation I say Lord have mercy I'll call the musicians as I close I I want to continue this I'm not actually ending on this because I want to just stop here brothers and sisters this is only getting started gaslighting is a type of psychological manipulation where someone tries to convince another person that their reality is false I believe this is so important if we're message Believers and we're going to go and talk to people and try and win them to Christ we aren't going to win Nobody by saying you're wrong I'm right you're wrong if we do that brothers and sisters it is going to be a problem it's going to demonstrate that again we maybe aren't as mature as we can get to but gaslighting is a type of psychological manipulation where someone tries to convince another person that their reality is false it's a form of emotional abuse that can cause a victim to question their own own thoughts feelings and Sanity now I don't know if you've ever had someone Gaslight you I think sometimes people will do it and not even realize they're doing it right but when somebody says stuff to make you think they're right and you're wrong and you know that you're right you've actually got proof that you're right but they're saying that you're wrong you're getting gas lit but that doesn't mean that they're a bad person sometimes we think that we genuinely think that we're right and it causes confusion all we need to do is have a conversation about it brothers and sisters but as Believers gaslighting is something that we need to be aware of but this is all from that cult definition remember talking about a cult this is not what we believe this is not who we are there's nobody in here that is held by force nobody in here is held by control or manipulation if you want to go go if you don't want to attend here anymore there's so many other churches probably better ones but there's other people that might want to come they're welcome to to come there's no control get into Jesus Christ amen yes I think this is just amazing though when you look at this because it can totally be spiritually applied it's a form of emotional abuse that can cause a victim to question their own thoughts feelings and Sanity I'll say it's the devil brothers and sisters maybe stand with me as we close says here how it works the abuser uses a series of actions to confuse the victim and make them doubt their own reality the abuser may deny the victim's memory or perception of an event the abuser May blame the victim for things that aren't their fault the abuser may try to shift the focus away from their abusive Behavior now remember all of this came out from the definition of a cult but remember what we said what what did this seventh angel Messengers say he he never came to actually get people to follow him he did not come to set up an organization he wasn't looking to set up a a franchisable organization where everyone would pay homage to them financially he didn't come to do that he wanted to see one thing established and that was a true spiritual relationship between God and Men again that's his purpose that's why he came that's why we listen to what he said cuz I know that I can say I'm one of them I'm so glad that he came around and did what he did fulfilled the role that God gave him for this life in which we live I think it's real important brothers and sisters some of these things I know that we know have been exercised in and around the message and whether they're preached or acted they're still there and it's very important to know exactly where we stand and hey if you see any of these things exhibited in brother Barry you got to come and tell me because I'm not interested in that the only thing I'm interested in is Christ and seeing people get filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that is the only thing that's going to help us in the day in which we live that happens through church order through teaching brother brandham said it very clearly that preaching saves the person but teaching positionally places them in the land and that is I believe where we're at brothers and sisters we're in the promised land we just need to know our positions and as we go forwards as we know our positions we're going to see the manifestation of the Lord in our lives maybe in a way like we've never seen before amen if we can just humble ourselves to the word not to our own thoughts or Traditions maybe our own experiences we we we know that Paul I'll probably preach on this too Paul he had such a tremendous experience wasn't it he was knocked off his horse he was knocked off his high horse his high religious horse Paul was knocked to the ground he met the pillar of fire he caught the greatest revelation ever right but once he did he didn't base all of his life afterwards on that one experience what did he do he went and checked up with the word amen he went to see if it was actually in the word and once he realized that it set his soul on fire and I just trust brothers and sisters that through the the coming days and weeks that we could just check up our experiences with the word don't leave it as just a pillar of fire experience don't leave it as a man William Mary and bram's experience don't leave it to Mom's experience dad's experience the pastors of their deacons experience make it your own experience amen and check it up with the word let let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love you and we thank you for your word thank you Father for establishing it properly on a firm foundation Lord for not leaving us or forsaking us Lord but Lord giving us the leadership and the guidance that we need thank you for sending us a
