[54:18] [Applause]
[54:25] morning so and honor and privilege to be
[54:27] in his house this morning I've never
[54:30] seen this church this full before so
[54:33] permit me to be intimidated
[54:36] already but we know that we haven't come
[54:38] to see man we've come to the presence of
[54:41] God to be blessed we have come to
[54:44] receive from him he told Moses he said
[54:48] Gather the people together he said I the
[54:50] Lord will give them
[54:52] water you know brother Dom was praying
[54:55] and the things that the Lord was
[54:57] speaking to my heart this morning came
[54:59] out in that
[55:00] prayer you know the first one was the
[55:02] fact that we cannot be here if we didn't
[55:05] have a desire to come sir as we leaving
[55:09] the house this morning that was one of
[55:10] the things I said in my prayer and then
[55:13] he talked about the foolishness of
[55:15] preaching and the Lord took me to that
[55:17] scripture this
[55:19] morning and I was thinking about it I
[55:21] think perhaps yesterday but I read it
[55:23] this morning and how that
[55:27] I was wondering what Paul meant when he
[55:29] said that through the foolishness of
[55:31] preaching God will bring his word to
[55:33] those that believe and I realize that
[55:37] it's all about the fact that God decides
[55:39] to use a badger
[55:41] skin to speak to hide behind that Badger
[55:45] skin to speak to his people God decided
[55:48] to take a badger which we know like is
[55:50] it's not a pleasant animal he could have
[55:53] decided to use the the the skin of sheep
[55:57] but God decided to use a Bader
[55:59] skin and speak through a Bader skin so
[56:03] God decides to use men men that are only
[56:06] Sinners saved by grace like myself to
[56:09] speak the word but Paul said for those
[56:12] that believe and I believe that we here
[56:15] this morning with faith in the word of
[56:17] God trusting that the Lord will speak to
[56:20] us I know we have a lot of visitors I
[56:23] can't start to mention names so I don't
[56:25] miss anyone
[56:27] but I just want to say sister Lori that
[56:28] was
[56:29] wonderful and if you don't know the
[56:32] person that played the piano was the one
[56:34] that wrote the
[56:35] song but uh she brought that song
[56:39] Alive in a way that uh we've never heard
[56:43] it
[56:46] before thank you musicians Lord bless
[56:48] you let's just bow to pray before we
[56:50] read the
[56:52] [Music]
[56:54] word Lord
[56:57] the hour has
[57:00] come the word Lord Jesus is a discerner
[57:03] of au thought and the intent of the
[57:06] heart if you will take me out of the way
[57:10] and just speak your
[57:12] word without a doubt the needs of your
[57:15] people will be
[57:16] met so that's what I'm asking for this
[57:19] morning that through the foolishness of
[57:22] preaching you will reveal yourself to
[57:25] your children
[57:26] amen father speak to us this morning
[57:29] that which you have placed in my heart I
[57:32] want to yield to you father am just Lord
[57:35] let it be that you will speak to the
[57:38] needs of your people yes Lord I know I'm
[57:41] repeating that Lord but I don't know how
[57:44] this will meet the need of everyone in
[57:46] here but you know how it will Lord
[57:50] Jesus and I ask that you do that father
[57:53] that at the end of this service Lord
[57:54] Jesus be able to give you thanks we want
[57:57] to remember our pastor once again just
[58:00] asking that you'll be with him and the
[58:01] wife Lord Jesus in their trip we trust
[58:04] that you've used him Lord to be a
[58:06] blessing there Lord Jesus I ask that
[58:08] specifically Lord and I know that you
[58:10] have done it Lord we are waiting for
[58:12] testimonies there father of what you did
[58:15] in in Ohio Lord Jesus this morning and
[58:18] we know you will do the same for us here
[58:19] Lord that at the end we might come back
[58:22] and say thank you Father for all that
[58:24] you've done for in Jesus Christ Christ's
[58:26] name we pray amen
[58:29] amen just before you take your seat
[58:31] let's just uh we're going to read three
[58:33] portions of the scripture thank you once
[58:35] again
[58:36] musicians try to make sure that I don't
[58:39] forget the musicians it's being a
[58:42] musician it's it's not a good thing if I
[58:45] forget so I have to always remember
[58:49] Hallelujah let's turn first to Matthew
[58:52] Chapter 7
[58:56] we'll take from verse 24 to
[59:00] 29 if you can please give me some volume
[59:03] on the monitor that will be helpful just
[59:06] want to be sure I'm not
[59:09] yelling almost lost my voice but uh the
[59:13] Lord was gracious I still have something
[59:14] to speak with this
[59:16] morning Matthew 7 24 to
[59:21] 29 very familiar story or actually just
[59:25] an illust ation that Jesus gave here as
[59:28] he was uh preaching his first
[59:31] sermon therefore whosoever heareth the
[59:34] says of mine and dth them I will liken
[59:37] him unto a wise man which built his
[59:40] house upon a
[59:42] rock and the rain descended and the
[59:45] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[59:48] upon that house and it fell not for it
[59:52] was founded upon a rock notice that
[59:55] Jesus was talking about those that hear
[1:00:01] the
[1:00:02] says that he was sharing with them and
[1:00:04] not just hear it but does it those that
[1:00:07] do those sayings it was likening them
[1:00:10] unto a man that will build his house
[1:00:13] upon a rock 26 says and everyone that
[1:00:15] heareth the sayings of mine and doeth
[1:00:17] them not shall be likened unto a foolish
[1:00:21] man which built his house upon the S and
[1:00:25] the reain the said edad and the floods
[1:00:27] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[1:00:30] that house and it fell it didn't just
[1:00:33] fall he said and great was the fall of
[1:00:37] it and it came to pass when Jesus had
[1:00:39] ended the sayings the people were
[1:00:42] astonished at his Doctrine for he taught
[1:00:46] them as one having Authority and not as
[1:00:49] the
[1:00:51] scribes let's go to Psalms 11
[1:00:56] I'll just take a verse there 11
[1:01:04] verse3 says if the foundations be
[1:01:08] destroyed what can the righteous do and
[1:01:11] then lastly First Corinthians 2 I know
[1:01:14] you're still flipping the pages I'm
[1:01:16] sorry just don't want to waste any time
[1:01:19] at all um you can also read it right
[1:01:22] behind me on the screen 1 Corinthians
[1:01:25] 2:6
[1:01:27] 28 this was Apostle Paul speaking here
[1:01:31] to the
[1:01:33] Corinthians said how be it will speak
[1:01:35] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[1:01:38] not the wisdom of this world nor of the
[1:01:41] princeses of this world that come to not
[1:01:45] now he's talking about two types of
[1:01:49] wisdom vers 7 he explains more but we
[1:01:51] speak the wisdom of God in a mystery
[1:01:56] the wisdom of God is always a mystery
[1:01:58] until it is revealed to you and God
[1:02:01] makes sure makes sure that that
[1:02:03] Revelation is personal am even the
[1:02:05] hidden
[1:02:07] wisdom it's a mystery it's hidden which
[1:02:10] God ordained before the world unto our
[1:02:14] Glory it's hidden it's a mystery but
[1:02:18] then God ordained it for our Glory
[1:02:20] meaning that it is meant for us and
[1:02:22] that's why he's got to reveal it to us
[1:02:25] which none of the princes of this world
[1:02:26] knew for had they known it they will not
[1:02:30] have crucified the Lord Of Glory and the
[1:02:33] Lord had bless you to the read of his
[1:02:34] word may you have your
[1:02:38] seats this morning I want to take a
[1:02:41] title the definitive significance of the
[1:02:45] foundation the
[1:02:47] definitive significance of the
[1:02:49] foundation amen the word definitive will
[1:02:52] mean not able to be changed or improved
[1:02:56] proved you know you could talk about a
[1:02:58] definitive judgment or ruling you could
[1:03:00] talk about the fact that there are no
[1:03:03] definitive answers or solution to a
[1:03:05] problem you could also talk about the
[1:03:07] fact that for instance the police have
[1:03:10] no definitive proof of our guilt and
[1:03:13] another meaning of it is when you
[1:03:15] consider something to be the best of its
[1:03:19] type so we're talking about the
[1:03:21] foundation and the reason I use that
[1:03:23] word definitive is the fact that when
[1:03:26] you look at a house and I'm not a
[1:03:28] builder so will Paul correct me if I if
[1:03:31] I'm wrong or the other people that work
[1:03:34] in that industry here but I know as much
[1:03:36] as the fact that of all the things that
[1:03:39] you could do in a building the most
[1:03:43] important part is the foundation that's
[1:03:45] right if the foundation is wrong every
[1:03:49] other thing about that building will be
[1:03:52] wrong as a matter of fact there are
[1:03:54] times when a building has been completed
[1:03:58] and it looks really nice in this part of
[1:04:00] the world I don't think that can happen
[1:04:01] in Africa where we build with bricks and
[1:04:03] with blocks but in this part of the
[1:04:06] world when the foundation has a problem
[1:04:10] they've got to lift the entire house and
[1:04:13] fix the
[1:04:14] foundation but that is always
[1:04:17] expensive now another thing I want you
[1:04:20] to note is that in this analogy that
[1:04:23] Jesus gave it is possible that the
[1:04:26] material that was used in those two
[1:04:28] instances were the same that's right the
[1:04:32] material could have been the
[1:04:35] same but the problem was with the
[1:04:40] foundation someone decided to have the
[1:04:43] right foundation and someone else
[1:04:46] decided to have the wrong
[1:04:48] Foundation now both of them experien the
[1:04:51] storms
[1:04:53] yes you don't know where I'm going this
[1:04:55] morning but we'll get there soon both of
[1:04:58] them
[1:04:59] experienced the storms amen and
[1:05:03] regardless of the similarity in the
[1:05:05] material that was used to build the
[1:05:07] houses the foundation determined which
[1:05:10] house will stand that's
[1:05:12] right
[1:05:15] amen they might have used the best of
[1:05:18] material they might have sourced the
[1:05:20] best of wood that they could use to
[1:05:22] build a house but when there was a
[1:05:25] problem them without
[1:05:26] Foundation when the storms came the
[1:05:29] house could not stand that's right and
[1:05:32] Jesus will tell us that not only did it
[1:05:34] fall great was the fall of
[1:05:39] it now this morning I want to take a
[1:05:42] subtitle the foundation of
[1:05:46] marriage so we're talking about
[1:05:48] foundation and that's why I was praying
[1:05:50] and saying Lord I don't know how this
[1:05:52] would meet the need of everyone here
[1:05:54] because I felt this is for the young
[1:05:55] people
[1:05:56] but just to be sure that we take care of
[1:05:59] everybody including the children who
[1:06:01] might not have a lot of this things
[1:06:04] applicable how many of you children
[1:06:06] remember the song that goes with the
[1:06:09] story that Jesus
[1:06:11] told can we all be kids for a while can
[1:06:14] we sing it yeah what song is
[1:06:18] that you can't
[1:06:20] remember okay Daniel can remember what
[1:06:23] song is it
[1:06:25] yeah okay so let's go the wise man built
[1:06:29] his house upon the rock the wise man
[1:06:33] built his house upon the rock the wise
[1:06:37] men build his house upon the rock and
[1:06:40] the rain came falling
[1:06:44] down the rain came down
[1:06:48] fls okay the rains came down and the
[1:06:52] floods up the rains came
[1:06:56] down and what
[1:06:58] [Music]
[1:07:01] happened okay and the foolish man the
[1:07:04] foolish man built his house upon the
[1:07:09] sand
[1:07:12] bu the foolish man built his house upon
[1:07:16] the sand and the rain
[1:07:20] came so the Rings came down and the
[1:07:24] floods
[1:07:26] the rain came down and
[1:07:30] the the RS came down and
[1:07:34] [Music]
[1:07:37] the wind Splash thank you let's give
[1:07:41] everyone a
[1:07:46] hand so if you can remember that song
[1:07:48] that you can remember my message this
[1:07:50] morning
[1:07:52] okay now why do we talk about marriage
[1:07:55] why we talk about marriage as a found
[1:07:57] and talk about the foundation of
[1:07:58] marriage but Braham says in the message
[1:08:00] the marriage of the Lamb he said now
[1:08:03] marriage in one sense is a
[1:08:05] type the Earthly marriage here is a type
[1:08:09] of the Heavenly
[1:08:12] marriage now if you think about that
[1:08:15] deeply you'll understand that God did
[1:08:19] not just Institute marriage for
[1:08:22] fun God instituted marriage as Paul will
[1:08:25] tell us he instituted marriage because
[1:08:28] he wanted to show a type of Christ and
[1:08:31] the
[1:08:32] church now when you talk about something
[1:08:35] being a type then there must be an
[1:08:37] original that's right so the type
[1:08:40] supposed to follow the way the original
[1:08:43] is meaning that if I am a married person
[1:08:47] I'm I'm supposed to be looking at the
[1:08:49] original which is Christ and the church
[1:08:51] and if I get it wrong in any way then
[1:08:54] what I'm trying to say is that the
[1:08:57] original is not right because I'm
[1:08:59] supposed to be a reflection of the
[1:09:03] original and many times you know we
[1:09:06] could talk about people who are
[1:09:08] married and um how many people are
[1:09:11] married
[1:09:13] here how many people have had storms in
[1:09:16] their
[1:09:22] marriage storms are meant to happen
[1:09:26] sometimes it's terms of
[1:09:29] disagreement I see it this way you see
[1:09:31] it that way you know one of the things I
[1:09:33] heard before I got married
[1:09:34] is there have been marriages that
[1:09:37] crashed just because
[1:09:41] someone always forgets to put down the
[1:09:43] toilet
[1:09:46] seat and from something as little as you
[1:09:50] did not put down the toilet seat
[1:09:52] marriages can crash
[1:09:57] but if the marriage is built on the
[1:10:00] right
[1:10:01] foundation those storms will
[1:10:04] come storms of disappointment when your
[1:10:08] spouse will do something that pains you
[1:10:11] because you don't expect them to do it
[1:10:14] when those Storms Come As Long as That
[1:10:17] marriage is founded on the Rock who is
[1:10:21] The Rock On Christ the solid rock I
[1:10:24] stand all other ground is sinking
[1:10:30] sand you know the other part that we
[1:10:33] read in First Corinthians brother Paul
[1:10:36] was talking about two types of
[1:10:39] wisdom brother Paul talked about the
[1:10:41] wisdom of this
[1:10:43] world and then he talks about the wisdom
[1:10:46] of God for everything in this life there
[1:10:50] are two kinds of wisdom or two kinds of
[1:10:53] advises or two kinds of ways in which
[1:10:56] you could approach it and when it comes
[1:10:58] to marriage this world has its own
[1:11:02] explanation of how marriage should be
[1:11:05] approached but I want to tell you this
[1:11:08] morning that any
[1:11:10] idea any
[1:11:13] advice any wisdom that is different from
[1:11:16] the wisdom and the word of God it is
[1:11:19] sinking
[1:11:22] s so for our young people
[1:11:26] that are not yet married or that are
[1:11:29] thinking of you know getting into
[1:11:30] marriage at some
[1:11:33] point I want to by the grace of God show
[1:11:36] you from the word of God what kind of
[1:11:40] foundation God wants you to have as you
[1:11:43] approach
[1:11:47] marriage you know we live in a country
[1:11:50] where the rate of divorce is Skyrocket
[1:11:56] it's even gotten to a point where I mean
[1:11:59] maybe some young people ask themselves
[1:12:01] should I even get
[1:12:03] married and let me just share some
[1:12:05] statistics
[1:12:07] from uh what we currently have in Canada
[1:12:10] just some statistics with you it says
[1:12:12] that 40 to 50% of the first marriage is
[1:12:16] estimated to end up in
[1:12:18] divorce so when someone like me that
[1:12:20] comes from Africa
[1:12:22] reads something like first marriage it
[1:12:25] it's actually a bit weird I was having a
[1:12:27] conversation with one of my colleagues
[1:12:28] and she was like oh my kids are
[1:12:31] preparing for their father's
[1:12:34] wedding I'm like that doesn't make sense
[1:12:37] your kids cannot be preparing for their
[1:12:39] father's wedding because you should be
[1:12:40] married to their father
[1:12:43] already but what she was trying to tell
[1:12:45] me is that of course she was married
[1:12:48] before she was divorced and then she
[1:12:50] married someone else and uh ex-husband
[1:12:55] has been going with someone for a while
[1:12:57] and now it's time for them to get
[1:12:58] married and the kids are preparing for
[1:13:00] that wedding their father getting
[1:13:02] married to someone
[1:13:05] else and here we are been told that 40
[1:13:08] to 50% of the first marriage is
[1:13:11] estimated to end up in
[1:13:13] divorce 60% of second marriages are most
[1:13:16] likely to get divorced that's people
[1:13:19] that now go and marry someone else after
[1:13:21] their first marriage and 73% of the
[1:13:24] third marriage end up getting
[1:13:27] separated those that say you know what I
[1:13:29] didn't get it right the first time try
[1:13:31] the second time didn't get it right want
[1:13:33] to try it again 73% of them get
[1:13:38] separated and it says the couples aging
[1:13:40] 50 and more have a divorce rate of
[1:13:44] 26% that is after they have been married
[1:13:47] for a long
[1:13:48] time there's still chances that after 50
[1:13:52] divorce can still happen
[1:13:56] you know another thing that we hear a
[1:13:58] lot around this part of the world and
[1:14:01] it's actually getting to all the parts
[1:14:02] of the world is what they call common
[1:14:06] law and common law is a man and woman
[1:14:10] feeling like you know we don't want any
[1:14:12] strings
[1:14:14] attached let's just be together enjoy
[1:14:17] the benefits of marriage decide if we
[1:14:20] want to have kids together but we are
[1:14:22] not going to do anything that's called
[1:14:24] marriage
[1:14:26] that was not how God intended
[1:14:28] it now some of those people they're
[1:14:32] doing that because they have seen other
[1:14:34] bad examples of
[1:14:36] marriage I was in the barber shop a
[1:14:39] while ago and there was this man that
[1:14:42] was I think he from Z brother tabis that
[1:14:45] was being he was getting his haircut T
[1:14:47] night and he was having conversations
[1:14:49] with this Barbers they mostly from Ghana
[1:14:52] and I just knew that they were talking
[1:14:54] about
[1:14:55] marriage and a divorce case because this
[1:14:57] guy was talking about the fact that oh I
[1:14:59] brought her to this country after I've
[1:15:01] spent 20s something years you know
[1:15:03] making all the money and the only thing
[1:15:05] she has to her name I co signed and
[1:15:08] that's a car um she has nothing and now
[1:15:11] she's taking you know most of what I
[1:15:13] have because it's now a divorce
[1:15:17] case so you hear a lot of people see
[1:15:21] those
[1:15:22] examples young people and they are
[1:15:25] scared of coming close to
[1:15:29] marriage because of the
[1:15:32] Shipwreck that he can see all
[1:15:36] over now why am I talking about this cuz
[1:15:39] we're Believers right we we are
[1:15:40] believers we believe the message we are
[1:15:43] Christians right we shouldn't we
[1:15:45] shouldn't think about the things that's
[1:15:46] happening in the
[1:15:48] world that's what you think but Jesus
[1:15:51] Christ in his
[1:15:53] prayer he said Lord
[1:15:55] I'm not asking you to take them out of
[1:15:57] the
[1:15:58] world but I'm asking you to keep them
[1:16:02] from the wrong influence in the world we
[1:16:05] are in the world but not of the world
[1:16:08] there was a man that was he didn't
[1:16:10] realized that it was getting closer to
[1:16:15] the world and his name was
[1:16:17] lot lot and I and and and Abraham Lord
[1:16:21] being Abraham's uh nephew as as you know
[1:16:24] the story
[1:16:25] were far away from Sodom and
[1:16:28] gomorra but when their hurs men started
[1:16:31] to fight and Abraham said you know what
[1:16:33] Lord you just you just you know let
[1:16:36] let's not fight let's let let's let's
[1:16:38] just separate for now you know we're
[1:16:41] still brothers and then you choose where
[1:16:43] you want to go Lord decided to pitch his
[1:16:46] tent the Bible said towards
[1:16:49] Sodom that's right he didn't go into
[1:16:52] Sodom he just went close to Sodom
[1:16:56] but when the destruction of Sodom
[1:16:57] happened where was Lot in
[1:17:01] Sodom it was
[1:17:05] gradual and if we don't talk about those
[1:17:07] things we will not realize where it will
[1:17:11] become normal for us to do the things
[1:17:13] that the people in the world
[1:17:18] do there are very very sad stories I've
[1:17:22] heard within the the uh the the Circles
[1:17:25] of the
[1:17:26] message we've heard of people that got
[1:17:29] married went on honeymoon and that was
[1:17:32] the end of the
[1:17:34] marriage we've heard of people that were
[1:17:38] courting and they had differences they
[1:17:42] had fights and they kept pushing on and
[1:17:45] saying that well we can make it through
[1:17:47] and and they get to the point where
[1:17:48] they're
[1:17:49] married and few months after the
[1:17:52] marriage collapses
[1:17:56] all of those is because it was
[1:17:59] built on sinking
[1:18:03] sand now brother BR says this here and
[1:18:07] and you know one single
[1:18:10] mistake as I said before the wisdom of
[1:18:13] this world does not consider the things
[1:18:16] that God
[1:18:17] says but remember this morning we want
[1:18:20] to bring certain instructions and
[1:18:24] principles
[1:18:25] that God has given us concerning
[1:18:27] marriage especially to our young people
[1:18:31] so that they don't make the
[1:18:32] mistakes some mistakes cannot be
[1:18:35] corrected am true some mistakes when it
[1:18:39] happens when it comes to the matter of
[1:18:42] marriage that person's life becomes not
[1:18:47] what he supposed to be anymore let me
[1:18:50] read what thing brother brah said in
[1:18:52] questions answers 1964 brother Braham
[1:18:54] was ask the
[1:18:56] question brother Braham what is the
[1:18:58] meaning of an analment it's talking
[1:19:00] about analment when it comes to marriage
[1:19:02] are people free to marry or is it just
[1:19:04] another word for divorce I would like
[1:19:06] some information on
[1:19:08] this but the brah said sure they're
[1:19:11] married as long as they take that vow
[1:19:14] they are
[1:19:15] married just like a boy if he promises a
[1:19:19] girl to marry her under good faith
[1:19:23] meaning that he's making the sinc year
[1:19:25] promised to marry someone brother
[1:19:28] Abraham said he is obligated to that
[1:19:31] girl he is just as good as married the
[1:19:35] only thing the Lord does is give a Bill
[1:19:39] of Rights to live together to keep from
[1:19:41] being common law husband and wife what
[1:19:44] brother BR is saying is when they now
[1:19:46] come to church you know that when you
[1:19:48] come to church depends on which church
[1:19:50] some Churches have the right to actually
[1:19:52] give you like a marriage certific ific
[1:19:55] at if you don't get that from a church
[1:19:57] you have to go to um I think a
[1:20:00] magistrate or something and then get
[1:20:02] that certificates but brother Braham is
[1:20:05] saying that that is not when the
[1:20:06] marriage
[1:20:08] happens and it's going to prove to us by
[1:20:10] the word the marriage happens when you
[1:20:13] go I know these days if you go on one
[1:20:15] knee will you marry
[1:20:18] me but that's the moment before God that
[1:20:22] God sees you as married
[1:20:26] so before you ever get to that point as
[1:20:29] we hear Brother Braham say you've got to
[1:20:32] be double
[1:20:33] sure that that's the person you want to
[1:20:36] spend the rest of your life
[1:20:40] with the ram said the only thing the
[1:20:43] Lord does is give you a Bill of Rights
[1:20:45] to live together from being common La
[1:20:47] husband and wife but when a man tells a
[1:20:49] woman I will marry you honey I'll take
[1:20:53] you for my wife will you take he said
[1:20:56] he's married your vow is sacred that's
[1:21:01] what marries you anyhow I think we're
[1:21:03] reading it
[1:21:05] right there's not no preacher can marry
[1:21:09] you no magistrate or nothing else it's
[1:21:12] your own vow to God and to this man when
[1:21:14] you promise you are married said you see
[1:21:18] brother brah said said you
[1:21:20] said only answer that that by the Bible
[1:21:24] to you want the Bible on it raise your
[1:21:25] hand if you want it how many wants the
[1:21:27] Bible reference on that yeah now we got
[1:21:30] to about 6 or 8 minutes all right Joseph
[1:21:33] A husband being a just man a espoused
[1:21:36] husband remember that Joseph and Mary
[1:21:38] Mary the mother of Jesus they were not
[1:21:41] married at the time that the Holy Ghost
[1:21:43] overshadowed Mary
[1:21:46] remember and then when the Holy Ghost
[1:21:48] overshadowed Mary she Bram said she was
[1:21:50] just a young girl I can't remember how
[1:21:52] Bram said she was probably teenager
[1:21:55] at that time and when Joseph discovered
[1:21:59] that Mary was pregnant the Bible said he
[1:22:02] was going to put her away
[1:22:05] privately it was going to why why was it
[1:22:08] going to do that because according to
[1:22:10] the law she was meant to be
[1:22:13] stoned that means she has lived a FIY
[1:22:17] life she's been a fornicator and
[1:22:19] according to the lord they're supposed
[1:22:20] to take her and stone her but he knew
[1:22:24] that she was the good girl he couldn't
[1:22:26] explain what had happened went out to
[1:22:28] tell us that Joseph had been married
[1:22:30] before so he was way older than
[1:22:32] Mary but it was taking her now they were
[1:22:36] engaged not yet married but let's let's
[1:22:40] see what bar says here Joseph her
[1:22:41] husband being the just man was mindly to
[1:22:43] put her away privately on this wife
[1:22:46] because before they came together she
[1:22:48] was found with a child of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:52] and the angel of the Lord appeared to
[1:22:53] him on a dream and
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:22:56] saying Joseph thou son of David fear not
[1:23:00] to take unto thee Mary thy
[1:23:03] girlfriend marry thy what
[1:23:08] wife already married he had already
[1:23:12] promised
[1:23:13] her so it's not something to joke with
[1:23:16] oh I'll marry you no it's a serious
[1:23:21] issue but abam says I'll just go to one
[1:23:24] 98 don't you make your vow to anybody L
[1:23:29] you mean to stick with it remember
[1:23:32] there's a Bible for it Joseph promised
[1:23:33] to marry Mary and God said that was it
[1:23:37] he said read the Old Testament laws on
[1:23:38] that and it's also the same thing he
[1:23:41] said if you promised to marry a woman
[1:23:44] and you married another one you was
[1:23:46] committing adultery and he throwed you
[1:23:48] out of the camp yes you have to keep
[1:23:50] your vows when you promise a woman that
[1:23:53] she's a sacred little IAL and that's to
[1:23:55] bring the child into the world again so
[1:23:58] when you promise her you must marry her
[1:24:01] remember he said the promise must be in
[1:24:03] good faith yes if someone comes around
[1:24:06] you jokingly tells you I want to marry
[1:24:08] you has someone else it's not in good
[1:24:11] faith that person lies to you that is
[1:24:14] not binding that's right but when you
[1:24:17] mean it from your heart and you promise
[1:24:19] yourselves then it is
[1:24:23] binding now anytime we want to learn
[1:24:26] about something that God has placed in
[1:24:29] the Bible or given to us we can always
[1:24:32] go back to the first time God did it to
[1:24:35] understand the
[1:24:37] why so we're going to take a look
[1:24:40] at I'm just going to make this easy for
[1:24:42] us to understand because a lot of young
[1:24:44] people are students so if I give you
[1:24:47] like four points you can always remember
[1:24:49] those four points but I'm going to bring
[1:24:51] four points that I will call four
[1:24:53] different levels of
[1:24:55] maturity that is required before
[1:24:57] marriage for a good foundation of
[1:25:00] marriage four levels of
[1:25:04] maturity amen now let's remember that
[1:25:07] when God the first time God instituted
[1:25:09] marriage it was with our first parents
[1:25:12] it was Adam and Eve
[1:25:14] right but I've often wondered why God
[1:25:17] did not create Adam as a baby
[1:25:26] procreation was going to start very
[1:25:28] quickly because as God was making all
[1:25:30] other things God was giv that law of
[1:25:33] reproduction let every seed bring forth
[1:25:35] according to His
[1:25:37] Kind so God created Adam and made Adam a
[1:25:42] mature
[1:25:44] man and what I'm getting to as we're
[1:25:46] going to get a little bit into it is all
[1:25:48] of us will agree that people that think
[1:25:51] about marriage are people that are
[1:25:53] physically mature
[1:25:55] so we're going to look at physical
[1:25:57] maturity as the
[1:25:59] first maturity level that I want to talk
[1:26:01] about this
[1:26:04] morning but it was not just about Adam
[1:26:08] being a mature man or being created a
[1:26:11] mature
[1:26:12] man God made sure that Adam had a home
[1:26:19] amen let's let's recap the story God
[1:26:22] created a spirit man
[1:26:25] gave him Dominion Genesis chapter 2 God
[1:26:28] took the dust of the Earth formed flesh
[1:26:31] put that spirit in in in that in that
[1:26:34] man and then made him a living
[1:26:37] soul and then later on God saw that it
[1:26:40] was not good for man to be alone and
[1:26:43] then God took a reib I can't remember
[1:26:46] who I was who I was hearing from that
[1:26:48] said I I don't know how God would use
[1:26:50] one reib and create a woman but is the
[1:26:53] creator that's right right so God took a
[1:26:55] re from this man made a woman but before
[1:26:59] that happened there was a
[1:27:01] garden that God had made the man to be
[1:27:05] overseer
[1:27:07] of he had a
[1:27:09] responsibility he has a home let's put
[1:27:12] it this way Adam had a home and a
[1:27:16] job yes
[1:27:19] sir so you see some young men
[1:27:22] now ready to
[1:27:24] Mar what's your plan well we'll just Pi
[1:27:28] against me
[1:27:31] no you've got to have a
[1:27:36] job and then Adam was also a Son of God
[1:27:41] in terms of spiritual maturity as a
[1:27:44] matter of fact the serpent could not
[1:27:46] have deceived
[1:27:49] Adam it couldn't
[1:27:51] have that's why Satan was very subtle
[1:27:55] Satan found the time that Eve had
[1:27:57] strayed
[1:27:58] away and went in that animal and had a
[1:28:01] conversation that's right so when you
[1:28:04] are talking about a
[1:28:06] man that is ready I'm going to talk
[1:28:09] about men first because there's a huge
[1:28:12] responsibility that God has given us as
[1:28:14] men when it comes to building the
[1:28:19] family so God ensured that he was a
[1:28:21] mature man God ensured he had had a home
[1:28:24] God ensured he had a job he could have a
[1:28:28] sense of
[1:28:29] responsibility it was not meant to be
[1:28:31] calling
[1:28:37] Daddy you can't call Daddy when you have
[1:28:40] moved into your own
[1:28:41] house and say Daddy help me take every
[1:28:45] decision it shows that you've never
[1:28:48] learned how to be responsible before you
[1:28:50] got to that place amen so God I don't
[1:28:55] have the time to read all the scriptures
[1:28:56] but God the purpose of marriage we all
[1:28:58] agree
[1:28:59] procreation it was also for
[1:29:02] companionship and then it was also for
[1:29:05] Redemption God intended marriage for
[1:29:10] Redemption so many people agree that
[1:29:13] physical
[1:29:15] maturity is required for marriage but
[1:29:18] they stopped
[1:29:20] there that is why the concept of dating
[1:29:24] was
[1:29:26] introduced but when you look in the
[1:29:29] message of the hour and the advice that
[1:29:33] was given by the message of the hour you
[1:29:36] will not find dating there what you will
[1:29:39] find is courtship might ask me brother
[1:29:42] Toby what's the
[1:29:47] difference the intention of dating has
[1:29:51] nothing to do with marriage
[1:29:56] when someone comes and says I love you I
[1:29:58] want you to be my
[1:30:00] girlfriend most of the time it has no
[1:30:05] goal that is related to
[1:30:07] marriage if it has a goal related to
[1:30:10] marriage it is quing we're going to
[1:30:12] explain
[1:30:15] it it is let me just you know pause here
[1:30:18] and say it is natural for you as a young
[1:30:21] person when you get to a certain age
[1:30:24] that you you desire the the
[1:30:28] companionship of the opposite sex it's
[1:30:32] normal there's nothing wrong with
[1:30:36] it it's just the same way that Paul told
[1:30:39] us that God gave us a member in our
[1:30:42] bodies he called it a little member
[1:30:46] called the tongue and he said that
[1:30:48] member as little as it is it can put a
[1:30:51] house on fire
[1:30:54] but what do you have to do you have to
[1:30:55] put it under
[1:30:58] control so when you get to that age and
[1:31:01] your body tells you I'm ready you've got
[1:31:04] to tell your body that is more than just
[1:31:06] being physically
[1:31:08] mature when it comes to marriage that's
[1:31:13] right
[1:31:15] now I was talking about
[1:31:18] dating let's take a little bit uh let's
[1:31:21] take go down the history and find out
[1:31:24] you know what didn't is how did it
[1:31:26] because it wasn't always there right and
[1:31:29] I'll tell you why it is
[1:31:32] wrong and what is right and what the
[1:31:34] right way
[1:31:36] is so this is just some historical
[1:31:40] writings said the rituals of courtship
[1:31:44] have evolved over time and what is
[1:31:46] considered romantic today would have
[1:31:48] been scandalous if not criminal less
[1:31:51] than 100 years ago
[1:31:55] as revealed in morai wiggle a remarkable
[1:31:59] history of the subject here are 10
[1:32:01] things you might not know about dating
[1:32:02] and courtship over the
[1:32:05] years so number one is it was not
[1:32:07] originally called dating where did that
[1:32:10] word dating come
[1:32:13] from the the word dating in the context
[1:32:16] of relationships reaches back to
[1:32:19] 1896 it was first used in the newspaper
[1:32:22] column in which a young man laments that
[1:32:26] his girlfriend is seeing other people
[1:32:30] that they are feeling all my dates as in
[1:32:33] the dates in Her
[1:32:37] calendar so he's supposed to be courting
[1:32:39] this
[1:32:40] person but she was seeing other men and
[1:32:43] she had so many men that she was seeing
[1:32:46] that were filling up our dates in our
[1:32:50] calendar and that's how the word dating
[1:32:54] you know
[1:32:57] originates in the 1990s dating could be
[1:33:01] a
[1:33:02] felony I'll tell you why it is different
[1:33:05] from
[1:33:07] courtship when a young man approaches a
[1:33:09] lady and says I want you to be my
[1:33:11] girlfriend most of the time the parents
[1:33:14] are not
[1:33:15] involved most of the time the pastor is
[1:33:18] not
[1:33:19] involved when you listen to the ritual
[1:33:22] of marriage that is read on the wedding
[1:33:25] day it is said that it should not be
[1:33:28] entered into
[1:33:33] unadvisable remember it wasn't man that
[1:33:35] came up with
[1:33:36] marriage it was
[1:33:39] God and if God came up with something
[1:33:42] God has got
[1:33:43] principles many of us when we buy
[1:33:47] appliances we forget to read the
[1:33:50] manual and that puts us in a lot of
[1:33:52] trouble
[1:33:54] one of the things I remind myself is if
[1:33:56] I'm finding it hard to put together I'm
[1:33:59] doing something
[1:34:01] wrong because the manufacturer will have
[1:34:04] conceded every little bitty
[1:34:07] part and made it in such a way that if
[1:34:09] you were just to read the manual you get
[1:34:12] it done
[1:34:13] faster how many people buy Ikea
[1:34:19] products someone said that uh if you
[1:34:22] want to know how strong the relationship
[1:34:24] between couples are just try to put them
[1:34:27] together to to put together some my care
[1:34:29] products and then you'll
[1:34:33] see at the time of the last century
[1:34:35] dating was still a New Concept and law
[1:34:38] enforcement wasn't sure what to make of
[1:34:40] it but they were sure something sorted
[1:34:42] was going on a young man and a woman
[1:34:45] meeting in public him buying have food
[1:34:48] drink and Gifts well it was veritable
[1:34:53] process
[1:34:54] prostitution in the eyes of the
[1:34:56] authorities and women could be arrested
[1:34:59] for it in the 1900s early
[1:35:03] 1900s D didn't introduce privacy to the
[1:35:06] process of courtship let me explain
[1:35:09] it initially courtship was not supposed
[1:35:13] to be
[1:35:16] private when courtship is happening
[1:35:19] they're not going to hide
[1:35:22] somewhere or be somewhere that someone
[1:35:24] else is not because they want to make it
[1:35:26] open to the public that we are not
[1:35:29] allowing ourselves to get into intimacy
[1:35:32] that she come after
[1:35:36] marriage these days is hard because of
[1:35:39] social
[1:35:41] media I don't want to get into all those
[1:35:43] dirty stuff but young people you
[1:35:46] know you know how you could go for Camp
[1:35:49] a brother will take your number and you
[1:35:51] know the kind of conversations that will
[1:35:53] happen happen Daddy doesn't know Mommy
[1:35:56] doesn't know Pastor has no
[1:35:59] idea that is not the foundation that God
[1:36:02] laid that's not the foundation that the
[1:36:04] prophet
[1:36:05] laid said ironically a man and a woman
[1:36:08] meeting in public was the best way to
[1:36:10] have some privacy before dating
[1:36:13] courtship involved stors calling on
[1:36:16] prospective Partners In The Family Home
[1:36:19] and since MC manions were not yet a
[1:36:22] thing it meant the Parlor or kitchen
[1:36:26] where there was always eyes and ears
[1:36:29] closed by so what I meant is a man is
[1:36:32] interested in a young lady we're going
[1:36:34] to see brother the braham's
[1:36:36] example the man goes and ask the parents
[1:36:40] of the young lady I'm interested in your
[1:36:43] daughter I would like to know her
[1:36:47] more when he comes to the house they
[1:36:51] know him they know he's come for her
[1:36:54] they are not excusing them they all are
[1:36:57] in the open
[1:37:00] area it's getting to know her it's
[1:37:02] getting to see her he getting to see her
[1:37:04] behavior he getting to see how she
[1:37:07] responds when a mother or a father tells
[1:37:10] her something to do is trying to see how
[1:37:13] she relates with her
[1:37:15] siblings she probably also goes to his
[1:37:18] house to meet with him and his parents
[1:37:21] and she's watching and saying oh how
[1:37:23] does he respond to his mother when she
[1:37:26] talks to him because that's the way it's
[1:37:29] going to respond to
[1:37:31] her when they're
[1:37:35] married a boy that will think I'm now a
[1:37:37] boy and your mother will talk to you and
[1:37:40] you will talk back to your mother you
[1:37:41] will do the same to your
[1:37:45] wife it's a bad habit that you've got to
[1:37:49] get rid of right now before you get oh
[1:37:52] I'm going ahead myself s too much we'll
[1:37:55] get there all of those things is message
[1:37:58] I'm not bringing my own ideas I'm just
[1:38:00] telling you a bit of history and then we
[1:38:02] are going to see just to give context to
[1:38:04] what brother Braham
[1:38:06] said now the last point I want to talk
[1:38:08] about dating before D didn't came into
[1:38:10] the picture courtship and calling were
[1:38:14] conducted with the express goal of
[1:38:18] marriage it was a family
[1:38:21] affair as schar men hers property and
[1:38:25] happiness the newly established dating
[1:38:28] industry however add other goals in
[1:38:33] mind marriage will hurt the business of
[1:38:39] dating for the first time in human
[1:38:41] history writes wiggle dating made it
[1:38:45] necessary to buy things in order to get
[1:38:48] FaceTime with a prospective partner and
[1:38:52] this remains true today
[1:38:55] when you're caring someone there no
[1:38:56] there's no necessity to buy it you know
[1:38:59] it's not it's not you're not trying to
[1:39:02] impress that person with
[1:39:05] material but dating the concept of
[1:39:07] dating is take me to a restaurant take
[1:39:10] me out somewhere buy me some nice shoes
[1:39:14] buy me some nice jewelry that is the
[1:39:17] concept of
[1:39:20] dating now let's see what brother Braham
[1:39:22] said about the process of marriage and
[1:39:24] let's see what that dating is there the
[1:39:26] message come down paragraph 35 preach to
[1:39:29] 1962 butam said we take for instance the
[1:39:32] marriage for
[1:39:34] Union we found out that the marriage we
[1:39:38] find the courtship that's number one and
[1:39:42] the agreement that is with the same as
[1:39:45] engagement because that's when you're
[1:39:46] making the promise and then the marriage
[1:39:50] which is a ceremony elsewhere it says
[1:39:52] this courtship there's engagement and
[1:39:54] then there's a ceremony right that
[1:39:57] should settle it for all the time now
[1:40:00] it's the same thing that's the same
[1:40:03] thing it is with Christ and the church a
[1:40:05] courtship God calling to our hearts you
[1:40:07] see why I'm saying that marriage in the
[1:40:09] natural is a mirror of Christ and the
[1:40:13] church so if you take it out of place
[1:40:16] you are not mirroring Christ and the
[1:40:18] church and that's not what God
[1:40:20] wants a courtship God is calling to our
[1:40:23] heart Hearts we surrender the marriage
[1:40:24] ceremony and the bride takes the
[1:40:26] bridegroom's
[1:40:28] name so that is what God expects from us
[1:40:32] so physical maturity yes but not just
[1:40:35] that I'll move on to the next one how
[1:40:37] are we doing with time pretty good
[1:40:41] emotional
[1:40:42] maturity emotional
[1:40:45] maturity we live in a world that
[1:40:48] emphasizes self love
[1:40:55] the problem in most marriages is due to
[1:41:00] selfishness the man wants to put himself
[1:41:03] before the
[1:41:04] woman the woman wants to put herself
[1:41:07] before the man is what brother Bram
[1:41:10] called elsewhere the I
[1:41:13] problem always about I
[1:41:17] me that is the problem when it comes to
[1:41:21] most
[1:41:22] marriages but let us go back and listen
[1:41:25] to what Jesus
[1:41:27] said Jesus replied you must love the
[1:41:29] Lord your God with all your heart all
[1:41:31] your soul and all your mind this is the
[1:41:34] first and greatest Commandments a second
[1:41:36] is equally important love your neighbor
[1:41:39] as yourself the entire law and all the
[1:41:42] demands of the Prophet are based on
[1:41:44] these two Commandments they had come to
[1:41:47] ask Jesus which is the most important
[1:41:50] commandment in all the Commandments that
[1:41:51] Moses gave us and Jesus gave gave that
[1:41:53] description that gave that answer but
[1:41:56] brah says in God using his gift he said
[1:41:58] any Christian will think of others
[1:42:01] before
[1:42:02] himself every Christian will think of
[1:42:05] others before himself and in marriage if
[1:42:08] you can think of your spouse before you
[1:42:10] think about yourself there will be peace
[1:42:12] at
[1:42:14] home I had a colleague you know back in
[1:42:16] Nigeria
[1:42:17] who everyone knew and she herself knew
[1:42:20] that her husband was not faithful to
[1:42:23] them
[1:42:24] marriage but there's something she said
[1:42:27] that I found impressive she said every
[1:42:29] morning this Unfaithful man goes to his
[1:42:33] wife and says are you
[1:42:38] happy just wants to know because he
[1:42:41] knows that regardless of what he's doing
[1:42:43] and all he's struggling with if the wife
[1:42:45] is
[1:42:46] happy then it's
[1:42:50] fine it's not a good thing to do
[1:42:54] the other thing he was doing but it's
[1:42:56] important to know whether your spouse is
[1:42:59] happy or
[1:43:00] not even if it's as your own detriment
[1:43:04] you've got to make that person happy but
[1:43:06] what I'm saying is we live in a world
[1:43:09] today where what is
[1:43:12] being emphasized is love yourself first
[1:43:17] self first self love and we are growing
[1:43:21] kids that way and when it gets to the
[1:43:24] point where they have to get married or
[1:43:26] they finally get married you're going to
[1:43:28] find out that they put themselves first
[1:43:31] all the time and marriage cannot work
[1:43:34] like that marriage is all about
[1:43:37] sacrifice brother brah had an encounter
[1:43:40] well he had an experience I'll just read
[1:43:43] the quotes I think this is from the
[1:43:45] message a paradox CU this is a good
[1:43:48] example that gave so for instance a few
[1:43:52] days ago I was called on to scene a
[1:43:54] little something going on there was a
[1:43:57] fine young man very fine boy he was
[1:44:01] going with a little girl very fine
[1:44:03] little girl out of a fine family and
[1:44:05] this boy all of a sudden came up with
[1:44:08] some kind of an idea and he just walked
[1:44:13] away he did something wrong to that
[1:44:16] little girl and much as promised that to
[1:44:20] do a certain thing and didn't do it and
[1:44:22] instead of coming to the girl and
[1:44:26] apologizing just saying that felter word
[1:44:29] sorry is it five letters yes it's fine I
[1:44:34] still know my
[1:44:37] spelling just to say sorry that was hard
[1:44:41] like a gentle man should do he it just
[1:44:45] wasn't in him to do
[1:44:50] it it must have been a burd
[1:44:53] nice looking chest six
[1:45:00] box but when it comes to the
[1:45:05] intellect when it comes to what we in HR
[1:45:08] these days call emotional
[1:45:11] intelligence is called a
[1:45:15] zero just to say
[1:45:19] sorry are there people like that in the
[1:45:22] churches the message churches there are
[1:45:24] yes sir because this was the message
[1:45:26] church that brother was talking
[1:45:28] about and the father and the mother
[1:45:30] called me to the scene and said we will
[1:45:32] desire to know what's wrong with our
[1:45:35] boy maybe they tried to talk to him
[1:45:38] she's your wife just tell her you're
[1:45:40] sorry like
[1:45:42] nope walked
[1:45:44] away now it's not easy to do something
[1:45:48] but you must be truthful and honest
[1:45:50] therefore the boy was a Christian as far
[1:45:52] as a believer
[1:45:54] let's see whatam classifies here and he
[1:45:56] explains it he had repented and had been
[1:46:00] baptized and had his position among the
[1:46:03] Believers but yet had not received the
[1:46:07] baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter how
[1:46:11] much he thought he
[1:46:16] had the holy spirit will make you say
[1:46:20] sorry that's what AB is trying to say
[1:46:22] Amen
[1:46:23] said you think you have it having it is
[1:46:25] two different things you might be able
[1:46:26] to try to say you have and you might be
[1:46:29] able to show some evidence of some
[1:46:31] emotion but unless your life is
[1:46:34] vindicating what you are
[1:46:36] professing to have you still haven't got
[1:46:39] it no matter how many emotions how many
[1:46:42] jump run Sensations speaking in tongues
[1:46:44] or shouting or whatever you might lay it
[1:46:47] upon which is all right I believe in all
[1:46:50] that too but unless your life CS with
[1:46:52] your test
[1:46:53] then you haven't got it cuz the fruit of
[1:46:55] the spirit vindicates what you are just
[1:46:57] like the fruit of any tree tells what it
[1:47:00] is Jesus said by their fruit you shall
[1:47:03] know them said now this young fellow
[1:47:06] parent his mother is German no
[1:47:08] reflection on the German but there's a
[1:47:10] Trin in that
[1:47:12] family they'll just sit and you can talk
[1:47:14] to them they just stare at you right in
[1:47:16] the face this girl sister the mother of
[1:47:19] this boy or sister I have come down the
[1:47:21] street many more morning and this young
[1:47:23] lady be sitting out in the yard and I'll
[1:47:25] say good morning to you she'll just look
[1:47:28] at
[1:47:29] me and I'll stop and I'll say sure a
[1:47:31] fine morning she'll just stand look
[1:47:34] right at you an intelligent woman and
[1:47:37] I'll say come up see us sometime she'll
[1:47:40] just turn and look well our brothers are
[1:47:43] that way father and mother is that way
[1:47:46] amen hallelujah now the father of the
[1:47:49] boy is strictly an Irish Man Moody and
[1:47:52] High tempered High strong that's his
[1:47:56] whole family like that except one other
[1:47:59] out of the family
[1:48:01] converted this father and mother bought
[1:48:03] a christans filled with Holy Ghost and
[1:48:04] they have brought this young man up in
[1:48:06] the way of the
[1:48:07] Lord and now this young man is about 17
[1:48:10] or 18 years old something along there a
[1:48:12] very fine kid he's been a real model boy
[1:48:14] at home nice kid and he's got a brother
[1:48:17] that's just vice versa but the girls the
[1:48:19] mother's family lives close to a church
[1:48:23] but do you think they've ever come over
[1:48:26] there no they don't go to church and
[1:48:29] they know it's right but it was not just
[1:48:32] in them it was just not in them to ask
[1:48:35] forgiveness or ask pardoning even from
[1:48:39] God I'm adding that but that's what
[1:48:41] that's a context they just wouldn't do
[1:48:43] it it's not just in them now the jeans
[1:48:46] in the father and the mother of this boy
[1:48:48] no matter how much they converted Still
[1:48:50] Remains the flesh that's been
[1:48:52] interpreted out of this boy therefore
[1:48:54] the boy has got a complex in him just
[1:48:56] like from his mother's family that they
[1:48:58] are not forgiven they will not apologize
[1:49:01] and that's where the boy
[1:49:03] stands at this time he wasn't married to
[1:49:06] that girl they were going together but
[1:49:09] he lacked emotional
[1:49:12] intelligence he he I mean I could say
[1:49:15] it's a spiritual problem but I don't
[1:49:17] want to put it to spiritual problem
[1:49:18] because we know that there are people
[1:49:19] who are not Christians that don't find
[1:49:21] it hard to say sor
[1:49:24] sorry there are marriages of
[1:49:26] non-christians that have
[1:49:28] worked because they've used the
[1:49:30] principles of the
[1:49:32] Bible these are
[1:49:34] principles these are principles we study
[1:49:37] them in school we study psychology most
[1:49:39] of those things if you come back you
[1:49:40] find out that they took them from the
[1:49:42] pages of the scripture because the
[1:49:44] person that designed the human mind is
[1:49:46] God yes
[1:49:51] sir let me just go to 30 29 and I said
[1:49:55] to the boy look at your family
[1:49:57] practically all of them are drunks I
[1:49:59] don't want to me any miss anything
[1:50:00] that's
[1:50:02] important let's just go back to 27 I'm
[1:50:06] sorry now I said to the father no matter
[1:50:09] how much you've raised him up said now
[1:50:11] look at you out of your family all of
[1:50:13] them drunks and fighting and shooting
[1:50:15] and cutting and so forth now look at
[1:50:17] your family to the mother there are a
[1:50:18] bunch of people just said there I won't
[1:50:21] speak very in the dependent and so forth
[1:50:24] irreverent to religion but I said it's
[1:50:26] not you you are the only one of all your
[1:50:29] sisters and brothers and you are sweet
[1:50:31] kind and forgiven what does that now
[1:50:33] he's speaking to one of the parents of
[1:50:35] of the boy said what does that and you
[1:50:38] are tree part of that family tree yet
[1:50:41] you have received the Holy Ghost that's
[1:50:43] the thing that make you tender and sweet
[1:50:47] it's not your people anymore it's your
[1:50:50] Christ that lives in you
[1:50:53] I said to the boy look at your family
[1:50:55] practically all of them are drunks and
[1:50:56] so forth I said how moody and high
[1:50:59] tempered and high strong but you're not
[1:51:02] you're kind forgiven what's that the
[1:51:04] Holy Spirit you're no more what you are
[1:51:06] it's Christ in you I said now that same
[1:51:09] thing has to happen to your son he got
[1:51:13] to be delivered from The Strain in the
[1:51:16] family he got to be delivered from that
[1:51:18] bad habit of not being able to say sorry
[1:51:23] brother brah did say here that the
[1:51:24] parents raised him in the way of the
[1:51:26] Lord which we should all
[1:51:29] do and the father raised up and said my
[1:51:32] son went to the altar he was baptized
[1:51:34] correctly in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:51:35] and water baptism in in the pool said I
[1:51:38] know my son has come to
[1:51:40] Christ but ra said I said that may be
[1:51:43] all right all the outward motions it
[1:51:46] might be identified as a
[1:51:48] Believer with all the Believers but
[1:51:50] until he until he is regenerated born
[1:51:54] again I advise that young man never to
[1:51:59] never marry a woman it'll make hell on
[1:52:02] Earth for her until that gentle sweet
[1:52:05] forgiving Spirit of Christ comes
[1:52:09] [Music]
[1:52:11] in many of us will say but ABR said I'll
[1:52:14] advice I'll keep it at there I won't
[1:52:16] make it a
[1:52:18] Doctrine but if you want a sweet
[1:52:20] marriage receive the Holy Ghost
[1:52:25] brother Braham said in choosing of a
[1:52:27] bride he said the Holy Ghost will tell
[1:52:29] you who to marry is that important and
[1:52:35] sometimes you tell that to people and
[1:52:36] like no how why are you making it a
[1:52:38] Doctrine you know why why must I have to
[1:52:40] receive the Holy Ghost before I Get
[1:52:42] Married the question I want to ask you
[1:52:45] is why is marriage more important than
[1:52:48] the Holy
[1:52:49] Ghost right
[1:52:52] why is it that being converted and being
[1:52:55] a
[1:52:56] Christian is not as important as you
[1:52:59] getting
[1:53:01] married because the Holy Ghost is freely
[1:53:03] given that's right amen you don't need
[1:53:06] to T the only people that were told to T
[1:53:09] were those that went to the upper room
[1:53:11] and that taring brother BR said I
[1:53:13] stopped since they received the Holy
[1:53:15] Ghost right so if you are sincere in
[1:53:18] your heart and desperate as much as you
[1:53:20] want to get married if you are desperate
[1:53:23] to receive the Holy Ghost the brah said
[1:53:25] that God is under obligation to give it
[1:53:28] to
[1:53:31] you he's under obligation to give it to
[1:53:34] you so advised don't let this young man
[1:53:38] marry until he receiv receives the Holy
[1:53:40] Ghost when he receives the Holy Ghost he
[1:53:42] will become like his parents kindhearted
[1:53:46] that strain in the family will be gone
[1:53:49] it will be delivered from it amen
[1:53:51] because now there's a another spirit
[1:53:53] that dwells in it you love the Lord this
[1:53:58] morning the next one I'll talk about is
[1:54:00] financial and material maturity and then
[1:54:02] we'll come to spiritual
[1:54:05] maturity and this probably doesn't apply
[1:54:08] as much here as it does where I come
[1:54:11] from but it's not the intention of
[1:54:15] God that a
[1:54:19] man will marry a woman
[1:54:23] and not be
[1:54:25] independent what I'm trying to say is
[1:54:28] when it comes to decision when it comes
[1:54:30] to how that new unit operates it is
[1:54:35] supposed to be independent of any other
[1:54:41] unit you have to get to a level of
[1:54:44] Independence that neither of the parents
[1:54:47] are influencing that
[1:54:50] marriage and some times that requires
[1:54:54] you having your own space yes
[1:54:59] sir I know of a
[1:55:01] couple that had problems in the process
[1:55:05] of getting married differences fightings
[1:55:08] and all finally got
[1:55:11] married you know after being counseled
[1:55:14] and told you know you have to put all
[1:55:15] your differences
[1:55:17] away but the mother of the husband was
[1:55:21] leaving with
[1:55:24] them and what caused the problem that
[1:55:26] led to the
[1:55:27] separation was that the husband said his
[1:55:30] wife was
[1:55:31] disrespecting his
[1:55:35] mother newly weeded
[1:55:38] couple if the mother was not there in
[1:55:40] the first place that wouldn't have been
[1:55:42] a
[1:55:43] problem when two adults that have lived
[1:55:46] their life separately for I don't know
[1:55:48] 15 20 30 years depending on when you get
[1:55:52] married
[1:55:53] come together there has got to be
[1:55:56] differences you've been raised by two
[1:55:58] homes different homes you have
[1:56:02] different characters as a person you've
[1:56:04] had different experiences in life that
[1:56:07] has shaped you to become who you are and
[1:56:09] then you bring this two people
[1:56:12] together there's going to be a time of
[1:56:15] friction I don't know when that time
[1:56:17] ends
[1:56:18] anyway for those that have been married
[1:56:20] for close to 50 years is you know I'm
[1:56:23] not looking at Paul but I heard a story
[1:56:26] of uh friend told me a story years ago
[1:56:30] about a couple that you know they were
[1:56:31] grandparents and they had been married
[1:56:34] and I think someone went and visited
[1:56:35] them and and then the next thing they
[1:56:38] heard the man says I've told you not to
[1:56:40] be putting this thing here he probably
[1:56:42] been telling her for 50 years but
[1:56:44] nothing had
[1:56:48] changed but those differences will
[1:56:50] continue to be there right that's so
[1:56:53] when that unit is just about to start
[1:56:57] God expects Independence you said give
[1:57:00] me a scripture for
[1:57:03] it you want a
[1:57:06] scripture when it was time for Isaac to
[1:57:09] get
[1:57:11] married Abraham called
[1:57:14] elazar and gave him instruction after he
[1:57:17] made him to
[1:57:19] swear when El I'll just give us the
[1:57:21] story because we all know the story when
[1:57:23] elazar went and got
[1:57:26] Rebecca where did he bring Rebecca to he
[1:57:29] said Rebeca met Isaac on the
[1:57:33] field and after meeting Isaac on the
[1:57:35] field where did where did Isaac and
[1:57:36] Rebecca go they went into the tent of
[1:57:40] Sarah remember that time Sarah was
[1:57:43] dead they didn't go into the tent of
[1:57:46] Abraham and the new wife that he has but
[1:57:50] went into the tent of Sarah
[1:57:52] so that they can have their independence
[1:57:55] get to know themselves better and start
[1:57:58] to grow a another unit of the society a
[1:58:01] new
[1:58:03] family brother Bram gave
[1:58:06] examples an example of two different
[1:58:08] couples that he married in the early
[1:58:11] part of his ministry and this is in the
[1:58:13] message Ching of a
[1:58:15] bride because when I say things like
[1:58:17] this you
[1:58:19] know it kind of feels like how much
[1:58:22] should a man have before he he starts to
[1:58:25] think of getting
[1:58:29] married and this is actually funny like
[1:58:32] what brother Braham did here brother
[1:58:34] Braham said I've married many couples
[1:58:36] but it always reminds me of Christ and
[1:58:37] his bride one of the weddings I
[1:58:39] performed here some time ago it was
[1:58:41] quite an outstanding thing in my life
[1:58:43] and it's been several years ago when I
[1:58:44] was just a young Minister my brother was
[1:58:47] working on the WPA I don't know whether
[1:58:50] anybody ever remember that anyone has
[1:58:53] told as old as me and that was a project
[1:58:56] that the government had and my brother
[1:58:58] worked up there about 30 miles and they
[1:59:00] were digging some out some laks a
[1:59:02] project for the con conservation and
[1:59:05] there was a boy worked up there with him
[1:59:07] from Indianapolis about 100 miles above
[1:59:12] Jeffersonville uh where I lived and he
[1:59:15] said to my brother one day he said doc
[1:59:17] said I want I'm I'm going to get married
[1:59:20] if I just had enough money to pay the
[1:59:23] preacher he said I got enough money to
[1:59:26] get my license but said I haven't got
[1:59:28] enough money to pay the preacher so at
[1:59:30] that time you need to actually probably
[1:59:32] go to a church pay someone who is a
[1:59:35] preacher recognize a preacher to marry
[1:59:37] you I'll just save us I'll just talk
[1:59:39] about the story so we we save some time
[1:59:41] but what happened was you know brother
[1:59:44] bram's brother told Brother Bram about
[1:59:46] it um after speaking to this colleague
[1:59:50] and saying you know what my brother is a
[1:59:51] preacher I'm sure sure that he won't ask
[1:59:53] you for any money and brother Ram said
[1:59:57] uh to his brother that definitely I'll
[1:59:58] marry them without
[2:00:00] charging so brother Brown now starts to
[2:00:03] describe this couple as they came on
[2:00:05] their wedding day in paragraph 94 she
[2:00:10] got out of the car and they came up to
[2:00:11] the steps and when they walked in the
[2:00:13] poor little thing just about all she had
[2:00:17] on was a skirt and she didn't have no
[2:00:19] shoes hardly on she had a
[2:00:23] hitchhiked from she had hitchhiked from
[2:00:25] Indianapolis down had a little hair
[2:00:27] hanging down back in a long kind of
[2:00:30] plates down our back looked very young
[2:00:33] now brother starts to ask
[2:00:36] questions that you should ask yourself
[2:00:38] before you ever think of marriage before
[2:00:41] you think of the
[2:00:42] ceremony butam said and I said to her
[2:00:45] are you old enough to get
[2:00:46] married he said yes sir she said I have
[2:00:49] my reading permission from my father and
[2:00:53] mother I believe at that time it was
[2:00:55] have been a
[2:00:58] requirement I had to show it to the
[2:01:00] court here to get my license I said all
[2:01:03] right I said I'd like to have a talk
[2:01:05] talk to you a little bit before we
[2:01:06] perform this wedding the sat down the
[2:01:08] boy looking around the room he needed a
[2:01:10] haircuts real bad he was a poor little
[2:01:14] guy and he kept looking around the room
[2:01:16] he wasn't listening to me I said son I
[2:01:19] want you to listen to what I'm saying
[2:01:22] said yes sir I said you love this girl
[2:01:26] he said yes sir I do I said you love him
[2:01:30] was asking the lady so yes sir I do I
[2:01:33] said now have you got a place to take
[2:01:37] her after you
[2:01:44] marry I know some of the young men are
[2:01:46] too young to start thinking about
[2:01:49] this but when we were growing up up we
[2:01:52] heard these things from you know as
[2:01:55] early as we could understand what he
[2:01:58] meant and I will say that I will not be
[2:02:02] here
[2:02:04] today if I did not remember those things
[2:02:08] that we were
[2:02:09] told if I did not remember that your vow
[2:02:12] marries
[2:02:14] you I will not be qualified to stand in
[2:02:17] front of
[2:02:19] you because I will have married
[2:02:24] wrong so it's important there's no age
[2:02:27] where it's too young to know it if you
[2:02:29] don't need it now keep it in your back
[2:02:32] pocket if Christ Harries you're going to
[2:02:35] need it
[2:02:37] someday have you got a place to take her
[2:02:39] after you marry said yes sir I said all
[2:02:43] right I said I want to ask you something
[2:02:45] I understand you working up here in this
[2:02:48] pwa he said yes that's about $122 a week
[2:02:52] week I said you think you can make a
[2:02:55] living for
[2:02:57] her he said I'll do all I can
[2:03:03] do talk about being
[2:03:08] responsible I don't know if I read that
[2:03:10] quote butam talked about the fact that
[2:03:13] one thing he is I think I didn't finish
[2:03:14] reading it one thing he has learned in
[2:03:17] his
[2:03:18] life that's why he was talking about the
[2:03:21] fact that CHR will always put
[2:03:24] themselves last put the other person
[2:03:27] first I'm just going to go back to it
[2:03:29] and read it because I think it's good
[2:03:31] for us
[2:03:32] to be reminded of
[2:03:37] that butam said in God using his
[2:03:40] gifts a Christian will think of others
[2:03:42] before himself every Christian tries to
[2:03:44] put God
[2:03:47] first his family
[2:03:49] second he's number three
[2:03:53] brother brah said I have tried to make
[2:03:55] that a practice in my own life God first
[2:04:00] family circum then comes
[2:04:06] him I said you think you can make a
[2:04:08] living for her he said I'll do all I can
[2:04:10] do paragraph 99 I said well that's all
[2:04:13] right I said now what if he gets out of
[2:04:17] now turning to the sister what if he
[2:04:19] loses this job sister what are you going
[2:04:22] to do going to run back home to mama
[2:04:28] papa this was before brother brah was
[2:04:30] going to marry them she said no sir I am
[2:04:34] going to stay with
[2:04:36] him and I said what sir if you have
[2:04:38] three or four
[2:04:40] children nothing to feed them and you
[2:04:43] haven't got any work what are you going
[2:04:45] to do send her away said no sir I'll
[2:04:49] struggle right on well will make it
[2:04:53] somewhere brother brah said I felt
[2:04:56] little at seen that he really loved her
[2:04:59] and they loved one another I married
[2:05:04] them the part I don't have here I can
[2:05:07] just tell us the story it was about the
[2:05:10] same time that brother B brother BR
[2:05:11] married another couple from Rich homes
[2:05:15] so after a few weeks the said he decided
[2:05:17] to go take a look you know just visit
[2:05:20] these two couples and see how they doing
[2:05:23] and brother BR wasn't going to just go
[2:05:25] knock at at their door it was going
[2:05:28] to snitch and just watch and see what
[2:05:32] they were doing so brother Bram
[2:05:35] went first to the rich
[2:05:38] couple so he was peeping through the
[2:05:41] window trying to hear the conversations
[2:05:43] they didn't know he was around the
[2:05:45] corner and he said they were
[2:05:48] fighting what were they fighting over
[2:05:51] they had gone to a dance the night
[2:05:54] before and they were fighting over the
[2:05:57] fact that the boy danced with one girl
[2:05:59] and the girl danced with one
[2:06:03] boy and as soon as brother Braham
[2:06:05] knocked the door they opened the door
[2:06:06] they saw brother Braham they came
[2:06:08] together and held
[2:06:10] themselves hi honey don't you think it's
[2:06:12] so nice to have brother Bram in our
[2:06:14] house like yeah yeah nice to see you
[2:06:19] guys and then brother Brown went to
[2:06:21] visit this other
[2:06:24] couple they were leaving I don't know
[2:06:26] the word for it I can't remember the
[2:06:29] word used but they were living in what
[2:06:30] I'll call just a container like an AB
[2:06:33] abandoned
[2:06:35] container so but Abraham was listening
[2:06:37] to their conversation as
[2:06:40] well the man was telling the
[2:06:44] lady I'm sorry I really wanted to buy
[2:06:46] you this dress but I can't afford it he
[2:06:49] had just come with his income $12 a week
[2:06:54] and started to they were dividing so
[2:06:55] much for food so much for this so much
[2:06:59] for that so much for
[2:07:01] groceries and he was like I'm really
[2:07:03] saving up to really really help get this
[2:07:06] and she was like no don't worry about it
[2:07:08] I know you're trying as hard as you can
[2:07:10] let's just manage what we have brother
[2:07:13] abrah said if I was going to
[2:07:16] choose I would choose those poor people
[2:07:19] that is the real marriage
[2:07:26] so we need material
[2:07:29] maturity not in the sense of
[2:07:31] riches but in the sense of
[2:07:35] responsibility in the sense of knowing
[2:07:38] that you are at a place where when you
[2:07:41] ask the question do you have a place to
[2:07:43] take heart you can say yes I do it might
[2:07:46] not be the prevest of places it might
[2:07:49] not be the most you know convenient
[2:07:52] places that could take
[2:07:56] her but I know that we will be together
[2:07:59] we will work things
[2:08:02] out we'll make it
[2:08:06] together the the the the the the you
[2:08:08] know when you look at the marriages of
[2:08:10] rich
[2:08:12] people the most interesting
[2:08:15] stories are the stories of those that
[2:08:18] started
[2:08:19] poor that married their wife when they
[2:08:21] had
[2:08:23] nothing and they worked together to grow
[2:08:26] whatever God gave them the business that
[2:08:28] God gave them to grow to a stage where
[2:08:30] it's now become
[2:08:33] huge because you know that the man the
[2:08:36] the woman did not marry the man because
[2:08:37] of the money they actually grew it
[2:08:42] together spiritual
[2:08:45] maturity you know I talked about dating
[2:08:48] and people that studied the message
[2:08:50] might tell me me oh brother brah also
[2:08:52] dated
[2:08:54] someone
[2:08:56] yes yes I'll read
[2:08:58] it but brother BR was not a
[2:09:01] Christian that's right when he went out
[2:09:05] with a
[2:09:06] go and as I read the story you also
[2:09:11] realize what type of girl it was and
[2:09:15] what type of influence he was trying to
[2:09:18] bring upon him and then you if you want
[2:09:21] to against what I'm saying ask yourself
[2:09:22] is that the type of influence that I
[2:09:24] need in my
[2:09:26] life but R said I remember my first
[2:09:28] dates I had with a little girl this is
[2:09:30] in life story you know how boys are when
[2:09:33] you get about 16 17 you got a
[2:09:36] sweetheart and that first one you know
[2:09:39] how she
[2:09:40] looks I was a big old bashful country
[2:09:43] boy but I remember the first girl that I
[2:09:46] had oh she had teeth like pearls she had
[2:09:50] eyes like a dog love neck like a swan oh
[2:09:53] she was just the prettiest thing I ever
[2:09:55] seen in my
[2:09:57] life a lot of the brothers can say
[2:10:02] yes so she's she had just come back into
[2:10:05] school so I said to the other boyfriend
[2:10:07] I said you get your dad's old Ford I got
[2:10:10] 75 cents and we'll get us two gallons of
[2:10:14] gasoline for a quarter and so I'll have
[2:10:17] 50 cents left and we'll go out and have
[2:10:19] a good time
[2:10:22] not a Christian at this time so we had
[2:10:24] to jack off the old Ford up and you know
[2:10:27] uh did you ever do that to your old Ford
[2:10:30] when it was about half back SLE anyhow
[2:10:33] you know and pull it up till we got each
[2:10:37] started I mean growing up in Africa we
[2:10:41] back in the day when things were really
[2:10:43] hard most of the vehicles wouldn't start
[2:10:46] so we do what we call jump
[2:10:48] starting and jump starting is not taking
[2:10:51] another battery to start a car the
[2:10:54] vehicles that have not the type this
[2:10:56] type of vehicles you drive today these
[2:10:57] ones are easy to drive you drive it you
[2:11:00] know and and uh the first time and
[2:11:02] before you know you're a driver but
[2:11:04] those days the vehicles have clutches so
[2:11:08] you've got to understand how to balance
[2:11:11] between your clutch and your um the gas
[2:11:14] pedal right so that was the way we'll
[2:11:18] start a car that won't start you push sh
[2:11:22] and then you have
[2:11:23] to exactly some people know this yeah
[2:11:27] the older
[2:11:28] ones not trying to sound old but that's
[2:11:31] what brother the r was trying to
[2:11:33] describe
[2:11:34] here so a car that's backstage said my I
[2:11:37] think she'll um and they said we um and
[2:11:41] and pull it up till we got it started
[2:11:43] and he got his girl I got mine and he
[2:11:45] way we went my I think she'll go out
[2:11:47] with me went at night time didn't have
[2:11:50] to dress too good you know but Bram did
[2:11:53] not come from a a rich background he
[2:11:56] came from a very poor background so what
[2:11:58] he saying here is he'd rather go at
[2:12:00] night when no one will see what he's
[2:12:02] wearing because he wasn't wearing
[2:12:04] anything that looked good at
[2:12:05] all so they went at night time and um
[2:12:09] said we wasn't going nowhere anyhow so I
[2:12:12] sat back at the back of the car thing
[2:12:14] talking to this little lady Hardway over
[2:12:17] on one side and Midway over the other
[2:12:19] side just bashful you know
[2:12:22] I know my face was bound to be red cuz
[2:12:26] it was just so bashful so they stopped
[2:12:28] down at the place they got some
[2:12:30] sandwich and uh for an eal and let me
[2:12:34] just go to where they started having a
[2:12:37] conversation
[2:12:40] um 41 anyhow she was but BR talked about
[2:12:44] the fact that before he knew it this My
[2:12:45] Little Queen was smoking a
[2:12:49] cigarette anyhow she was smoking this
[2:12:51] little cigarette I looked at her my she
[2:12:53] sure passed out of my view I looked at
[2:12:56] her I could hardly believe it was her
[2:12:59] that pretty little girl sitting there
[2:13:00] smoking that cigarette she was blowing
[2:13:03] it through her nose you know sickening
[2:13:06] looking any man let his wife smoke
[2:13:08] cigarettes shows what is made out for
[2:13:11] made out of that's right so brah talked
[2:13:14] about the fact that she offered him the
[2:13:18] cigarette and he said no ma'am things I
[2:13:21] don't
[2:13:23] smoke and she said you don't dance cuz
[2:13:26] she's asked him about dancing before you
[2:13:28] don't smoke said what do you like to do
[2:13:31] said well I like to hunt and fish that
[2:13:34] didn't interest her she said you are a
[2:13:37] big
[2:13:38] CeCe said oh my I was going to be big
[2:13:42] bad
[2:13:45] Bill we all like
[2:13:48] that when I got to University I didn't
[2:13:50] want to associate myself with any
[2:13:52] Christian
[2:13:53] group cuz the adamic nature is there you
[2:13:56] just want to be that boy that all the
[2:13:58] girls are looking
[2:14:00] at and then they say oh it's
[2:14:04] cute that's what your nature
[2:14:09] wants but like I said the tongue is a
[2:14:11] little member but what we have to do is
[2:14:14] we've got to bring it under
[2:14:17] control so but Abraham was also like
[2:14:19] that he wasn't saved he said once before
[2:14:22] that my dad called me a CCE they were
[2:14:24] going talked about the fact that they
[2:14:26] were going with uh the Dad's friend and
[2:14:29] the dad they were drinking and and then
[2:14:31] the Father the father's friend said oh
[2:14:34] have some drink and the father looked at
[2:14:36] his friend and said oh that's if I ever
[2:14:38] got a Cissy out of my boys that's the
[2:14:39] one that a Cissy but Bram felt bad like
[2:14:43] give it to me I'll drink it but remember
[2:14:46] he had an experience with
[2:14:47] God and that experience came back that
[2:14:50] wind came and said
[2:14:52] sh and he threw it away I didn't realize
[2:14:55] it's almost 12 but we're going to close
[2:14:58] down so brother Braham eventually of
[2:15:01] course he couldn't do what this lady was
[2:15:04] asking him to do he couldn't
[2:15:06] smoke he felt really bad he left the
[2:15:10] vehicle he started walking
[2:15:12] away do he tried to do it the Holy
[2:15:15] Spirit did not allow him to do it he
[2:15:16] started working away 46 and I sat there
[2:15:19] I said I'll go home and finish a job
[2:15:21] nobody wants me and nobody my life is a
[2:15:23] misery so what's the use of me living
[2:15:26] sitting out there in that field that
[2:15:27] night God's grace wish I had more time
[2:15:29] but I can't to get to that right here to
[2:15:31] stay to say what taking place but
[2:15:34] someday I will with God's help now he
[2:15:36] says you might wonder how I got married
[2:15:39] I finally found a girl that didn't drink
[2:15:41] and smoke and I want you to know here if
[2:15:45] you go back and read the live story but
[2:15:46] talked about how he and sister hope had
[2:15:49] received the Holy Ghost
[2:15:53] and when it was time for them to get
[2:15:57] married so he went with a girl that went
[2:15:59] to church he didn't go with a girl who
[2:16:02] was out in the world when he met Christ
[2:16:06] right something changed about his
[2:16:09] life and when they were going to get
[2:16:10] married he talked about the funny story
[2:16:12] of where he was so bashful to talk to
[2:16:14] Sister Hop's mother because she was a
[2:16:17] very bold woman um and they had had a
[2:16:21] conversation like you go talk to your
[2:16:22] mom I'll go talk to your dad and even
[2:16:25] when he went to talk to uh sister H's
[2:16:27] father who was called Charles he
[2:16:29] couldn't even motion out the words to
[2:16:33] say that I want to marry your daughter
[2:16:35] they got outside he said oh it's a
[2:16:36] beautiful day and then Charles look at
[2:16:39] him like Bill you can have
[2:16:43] her and he was like are you serious and
[2:16:46] brother Braham said those same thing
[2:16:47] that that man said that poor guy brother
[2:16:50] Braham said I will work till my Palms
[2:16:53] become callous just to make sure I make
[2:16:55] a living for
[2:16:56] her a sense of responsibility but the
[2:17:00] Holy Ghost made him understand that this
[2:17:03] was a person meant for you there's so
[2:17:05] many more things to say maybe God will
[2:17:08] inspire one of the brothers or our
[2:17:09] pastor to go into it but just want to
[2:17:12] encourage our young
[2:17:14] people brother raham told us that
[2:17:17] outside of
[2:17:18] Salvation the best thing that God can
[2:17:21] give to a man is a good
[2:17:24] wife so in all of the things that are
[2:17:27] important in this life is salvation
[2:17:31] number one and marriage comes
[2:17:34] next in life there are three major
[2:17:37] events that happen your birth your
[2:17:40] marriage and your death is only one of
[2:17:42] them you're conscious of what's
[2:17:44] happening and that's marriage let us
[2:17:47] remember that God designed Mar
[2:17:52] marriage it was his
[2:17:55] design because he wants to reflect a
[2:17:57] relationship that he has with his church
[2:18:00] with his bride and he says see that
[2:18:04] example and follow after it I'll call
[2:18:07] the
[2:18:10] musicians and let's just be on our
[2:18:14] feet right at
[2:18:16] 12:00 right on time
[2:18:22] I pray that the
[2:18:24] Lord will use these
[2:18:29] words whichever way he wants to use
[2:18:33] it to set the right
[2:18:36] direction for brothers and sisters who
[2:18:41] are not yet
[2:18:42] married and for those that are
[2:18:45] married if the foundation was wrong
[2:18:51] he's still a way
[2:18:54] maker he can repair it in his case he
[2:18:58] doesn't have to lift the whole
[2:19:00] building he just goes there and fixes it
[2:19:05] and regardless of the storms that will
[2:19:07] come regardless of the rain that will
[2:19:10] fall that house will
[2:19:13] stand let's bow our heads to
