[38:30] Amen. God bless you tonight. Welcome to
[38:32] the house of the Lord once again. Truly
[38:36] an honor and a privilege to gather
[38:38] together. Hallelujah. in his name. If
[38:42] you have a need tonight, maybe just make
[38:43] it known unto him by way of an uplift
[38:46] hand. We just have a couple of requests
[38:49] that we want to bring before him
[38:51] tonight. Starting with the praise report
[38:53] from Sister Amber who says, "I'm
[38:56] praising God that a family crisis which
[38:58] could have impacted the whole morning
[39:00] was over in minutes after prayer."
[39:03] Praise God. We have a prayer request for
[39:06] a summer Kremplin. Sister Rebecca's
[39:10] daughter, Sister Rebecca's sister's
[39:12] daughter. So, her niece, she's in her
[39:15] early 20s, said she doesn't want to
[39:16] serve the Lord anymore. Raised in the
[39:19] message. Just praying that the Lord will
[39:21] intervene. We also want to remember the
[39:24] carpenters's request for Lincoln Stanley
[39:27] Strong, their six-month-old uh great
[39:30] nephew having trouble breathing. Let's
[39:33] just go to him in prayer tonight.
[39:35] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful
[39:37] that we can be in your presence, Lord,
[39:40] we know that you're already here. We can
[39:42] sense your presence, Father. And you
[39:44] know, whether we can feel it or or
[39:46] perceive it, it doesn't matter. Your
[39:48] word says it and we believe it, Lord
[39:50] Jesus. Father, we just want to remember
[39:52] these requests that were made known unto
[39:54] you tonight by the way of an uplift
[39:56] hand. Father, we want to bring them to
[39:58] you, Father. The only place of
[40:02] consolation in this world, the only
[40:04] place of healing, Lord, the only place
[40:06] of redemption, and that's you, Father.
[40:10] Lord Jesus, tonight we just commit each
[40:12] request unto you, Father. We want to
[40:14] remember this other request from the the
[40:17] Carpenters, Lord Lincoln Stanley Strong.
[40:20] Father, we pray that you would just
[40:22] touch that boy in the name of Jesus.
[40:24] Father, we know that you're able to heal
[40:27] breathing problems, Lord. Chest
[40:30] congestions, Father. Lord Jesus, all of
[40:33] the afflictions of this flesh, you are
[40:36] able to heal. And we just commit that
[40:38] need into your hands, Father. And Lord,
[40:40] we just want to remember the other need
[40:42] that we mentioned tonight, Lord Jesus.
[40:44] Summer Kremplin. Father, we pray that
[40:47] you would just minister to her, Lord. We
[40:49] know there was a time where your prophet
[40:52] was here and there was someone's son
[40:54] that ran wayward, Father. And we know
[40:57] that someone sent the agent of the Holy
[40:59] Ghost after them, Father. And Lord
[41:01] Jesus, tonight we just ask that we could
[41:04] do the same thing, Father. That we could
[41:06] send you after her, Father. That Lord,
[41:09] you would turn her heart around, Lord.
[41:11] That you would just allow her to come to
[41:13] know you in the power of your
[41:15] resurrection. And we know that's why
[41:16] people leave is because they haven't
[41:18] come to know you that way. Because if
[41:20] anybody ever does get to know you one
[41:23] time that way, they will never want to
[41:25] leave.
[41:27] But Father, we know there's been too
[41:28] much churchianity, too much getting in
[41:32] the message. Oh, but very little of
[41:35] getting the message inside of us.
[41:37] Father, tonight I pray that would be
[41:40] another step of your grace in our lives,
[41:42] Lord. that we wouldn't be gathered here
[41:44] in the message, Father, but Lord Jesus,
[41:48] we would bring the licks of message fire
[41:50] together tonight, Lord. Father, that we
[41:53] would recognize that message that lives
[41:55] inside of us, and that is that you have
[41:57] risen 2,000 years later, Father. Lord
[42:01] Jesus, in the heart of each one of us,
[42:04] tonight, we just commit this service
[42:05] into your hands, Father. be with those
[42:07] who are traveling, Lord, who are away
[42:09] for work, Father, who would rather be
[42:11] here, but Lord, or trying to provide for
[42:14] their families, Lord. Maybe away for
[42:16] work on on on vacations, maybe wherever
[42:20] they are, Father. Anyone who isn't here
[42:22] tonight, Father. We know that you know
[42:24] where they are. And we pray that you
[42:25] would just be with them, Lord. Bless
[42:27] them abundantly, Father. Bring them back
[42:30] home safely at the appointed time, Lord.
[42:32] Now, we just turn to you, Father, in
[42:34] your word. We commit this service now,
[42:37] the rest of it into your hands for your
[42:39] glory. We just pray that we could all
[42:41] get out of the way and just give you the
[42:42] preeminence, Father, the speaker and the
[42:44] hearer alike. In Jesus Christ's name we
[42:47] pray. Amen. Amen.
[42:50] Amen. Thank you,
[42:52] musicians. Certainly wonderful to be
[42:54] here again. Amen. If you have your
[42:57] Bibles, we want to continue our study in
[42:59] the exposition of the seven church ages.
[43:02] And uh we're drawing to a close. It's
[43:05] rapidly approaching and I just want to
[43:08] mention that we will certainly do
[43:09] questions and answers if anybody has a
[43:11] question. I haven't received any
[43:13] questions so far. So I guess that's a
[43:16] good thing. But uh I certainly would
[43:18] like to get into some questions as well.
[43:21] It's an opportunity for us to learn and
[43:23] grow. And uh so just consider that.

[43:30] [Music]
[43:31] 3 verse
[43:34] 14. And unto unto the angel of the
[43:38] church of the Leodysans, write these
[43:41] things, saith the Amen, the faithful and
[43:44] true witness, the beginning of the
[43:46] creation of God. I know thy works, that
[43:49] thou art neither cold nor hot. I would
[43:52] thou wart cold or hot. So then, because
[43:56] thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor
[43:59] hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.
[44:02] Because thou sayest, I am rich and
[44:04] increased with goods, and have need of
[44:06] nothing. And knowest not that thou art
[44:09] wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
[44:12] blind, and naked.
[44:15] I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[44:18] in the fire that thou mayest be rich,
[44:21] and white raignnt that thou mayest be
[44:24] clothed, and that the shame of thy
[44:27] nakedness do not appear. And anoint
[44:30] thine eyes with Isav that thou mayest
[44:35] see. As many as I love, I rebuke and
[44:38] chasen. Be zealous, therefore, and
[44:40] repent. Behold, I stand at the door and
[44:43] knock. If any man hear my voice and open
[44:46] the door, I will come into him and will
[44:50] s with him and he with me. To him that
[44:54] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[44:56] in my throne. Even as I also overcame,
[45:00] and am set down with my father in his
[45:02] throne. He that hath an ear, let him
[45:06] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[45:08] churches. Let's just bow one more time.
[45:11] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[45:13] ears to hear what your spirit says to
[45:16] the churches. Your spirit says to the
[45:18] church ages, what your spirit says to
[45:21] the living church today. Father, we pray
[45:25] that you would just bless the words that
[45:26] are spoken tonight, Father, to our
[45:28] spiritual nourishment that we would grow
[45:30] thereby. We just ask all these things in
[45:33] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. I
[45:36] bless you tonight. You may be seated.
[45:47] Certainly wonderful to be back in the
[45:49] house of the Lord. Picking up from where
[45:51] we left off last time at the end of the
[45:55] Leodysian church age. I guess we don't
[45:58] have any more church age scriptures to
[46:01] read
[46:02] um after tonight really. The resume of
[46:06] the ages is a a culmination a summary of
[46:09] the entire book. And uh I just thought
[46:13] that we would be diving into the tail
[46:15] end of the Leodysian church age.
[46:18] Basically the last two paragraphs um
[46:21] where we left off last
[46:23] week. just uh really good little bit of
[46:27] word and uh I just think it's so
[46:30] applicable to the bride, the church, the
[46:34] the elect
[46:36] lady. In paragraph 187, it says, "The
[46:40] corn of wheat, the bride wheat that fell
[46:43] into the ground at
[46:45] Nya has come back to the original word
[46:48] grain again."
[46:50] Now, it might sound really simple and
[46:52] and we know this. We've heard it.
[46:54] Brother Barry just labors on these
[46:56] things sometimes and I just think it's
[46:58] so good. But we could easily look over
[47:00] this and say that, you know, it's come
[47:03] back to the original word grain again
[47:04] and move on. But I just want to point it
[47:07] out. I want to underline it. I want to
[47:09] italicize it, make it bold, highlight
[47:12] it, harp on it. That it's already come
[47:15] back to the original word. Amen. It's
[47:18] not going to come back to the original
[47:20] word. It's that original word that
[47:23] changes our character that gives us the
[47:26] character that gold that can be tried in
[47:29] the fire. It's so easy to get caught up
[47:31] in the gold in this world, to look at
[47:35] the price of what gold is trading at, to
[47:38] look at the portfolios and get caught up
[47:40] in all of the investments on earth. But
[47:44] he says, "I challenge you to buy of me
[47:48] gold that's tried in the fiery fiery
[47:51] trials of afflictions." And that gold is
[47:55] not man-made gold. That's not an element
[47:58] on the periodic table. It's actually a
[48:01] character that is
[48:04] Christlike. And that word which will do
[48:06] that for us has already been restored.
[48:09] What a day we're living in. It is
[48:12] absolutely tremendous. And and he says
[48:14] the next three words, "Praise God
[48:16] forever." Yes. Listen to the
[48:18] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[48:22] in this last age. And we know that, you
[48:25] know, in Jeremiah's day, they just never
[48:27] listened. They said, "We've got our
[48:28] religious ways. We've done it this way
[48:30] for years. What do you have to tell us?"
[48:33] Um, and
[48:34] uh we know that judgment was at their
[48:37] door. And and and it's so sad because
[48:40] even after the city was under siege,
[48:43] Jeremiah told them, "If you just go out
[48:45] and surrender, you'll be a slave for the
[48:47] rest of your life, but at least you'll
[48:49] live." But they couldn't do it. There
[48:51] just was something inside of them that
[48:53] wouldn't allow them to actually
[48:54] surrender their lives to the voice of a
[48:57] vindicated prophet, which is so in in
[49:01] entirely sad. It's so terrible. But we
[49:04] have the ability to do that. Yes. Listen
[49:07] to the authenticated prophet of God who
[49:10] appears in this last age. Press play and
[49:14] then obey. Just press play. Listen to
[49:16] what he says. Read what he says. And
[49:19] then just do what he says. It's not that
[49:22] complicated. What he says from God, the
[49:26] bride will say.
[49:28] She won't try and spin it into something
[49:30] of her own. She won't try and blend it
[49:34] with anything else. she'll just take it
[49:36] the way he said it and then she'll
[49:39] actually say it the way he said it. What
[49:42] a tremendous thing that is. And you
[49:44] know, I I'll tell you, brothers and
[49:45] sisters, from my perspective in in call
[49:49] it the pastoring role for me, that's all
[49:51] of my consolation is to simply say what
[49:54] the prophet said. As soon as I get
[49:56] outside of that, it's for not. It's time
[50:00] to step down and and someone else to
[50:02] move in. And God will do that in his
[50:03] program. But what an amazing thing it is
[50:06] to think that that is the word that God
[50:08] will back up. That is the anointed word
[50:11] for this day. Alls we really need to do
[50:13] is come in and say what the prophets
[50:15] already said because that's what the
[50:17] word says. Even at the end of
[50:19] Revelation, the spirit and the bride say
[50:23] come. The same thing. They're not saying
[50:25] separate words. But it's beautiful what
[50:28] he says from God. that prophet the bride
[50:31] will say the spirit and the prophet and
[50:35] the bride will be saying the same thing
[50:40] and when one is saying something
[50:42] different we know it is not the spirit
[50:47] and it's not the
[50:49] prophet and I would go so far as to say
[50:52] perhaps not even the bride because the
[50:55] bride will say the same thing a true
[50:57] bride who is a wife is going to say what
[51:00] her husband once said. She's not going
[51:03] to be contrary to him. She's not going
[51:05] to be continually saying her own thing.
[51:09] She's going to support
[51:10] him. And what they will say will have
[51:14] already been said in the word. It's so
[51:16] easy and simple, isn't it? So clean, so
[51:19] beautiful, so refreshing. It's just
[51:22] going to be what's already been
[51:24] said. There's no new revelation coming
[51:26] our way.
[51:28] The only revelation is that one day we
[51:30] will actually see an an a a molecular
[51:32] body change. That's that's the
[51:34] revelation that will take place. That it
[51:36] actually has happened. All that we've
[51:38] talked about, all that we've preached
[51:40] about, all that we've prayed for, all
[51:41] that we've taught our children about,
[51:43] all that we've ever hoped for is
[51:45] actually now. One of these days,
[51:47] brothers and sisters, it's not going to
[51:49] it's not going to get any farther away.
[51:52] It's getting
[51:53] closer. He goes on to say, they're
[51:55] saying it now. come out from among her
[51:58] now and be ye separate. This is not a
[52:03] time to try and be like the world. It's
[52:08] not a time to try and dress like the
[52:10] world. It's not a time to try and talk
[52:13] like the world. It's not a time to to
[52:16] live like the world. This is a time to
[52:19] come right out of the world and be
[52:20] separate from all of the ways of this
[52:23] world. But it's tricky. I know it is.
[52:26] I'm not saying that. I don't I live in a
[52:28] a pie in the sky palace where everything
[52:31] in my world is perfect. No, no. I live
[52:33] under the same temptations that each and
[52:35] every one of us do. Social media is a
[52:38] very difficult place to live. It's so
[52:41] tempting. There's so many different
[52:42] things that take our attention away. And
[52:45] you know what happens when that happens
[52:47] is we're influenced by it. We become
[52:50] influenced by it. We become influenced
[52:52] by all the fashion, by all the cars, by
[52:54] all the music, by even churches. This is
[52:58] where it gets really treacherous because
[53:00] we see a lot of churches online in
[53:02] social media behaving certain ways,
[53:05] doing certain things. And it causes us
[53:07] to maybe desire to do things that way.
[53:10] But every church is sovereign and every
[53:12] church ought to be following the
[53:14] leadership of the Holy Ghost.
[53:15] Hallelujah. Not the latest post online
[53:18] from some social media thing. My
[53:22] they are saying it now. Come out from
[53:24] among her now and be ye separate. The
[53:26] cry has gone out. The cry is going
[53:30] out. How long will the voice cry? We do
[53:33] not know. But one thing we do know, it
[53:36] won't be long for this is the last age.
[53:39] And we know that the vindicated prophet
[53:41] that we're talking about here uh just a
[53:43] few words back he even said that this
[53:46] age is over while he was yet on earth.
[53:48] And he said that we're now into the
[53:50] bride age, another age. And it's not an
[53:53] eighth messenger age. It's the time for
[53:56] the invisible union of the bride of
[53:58] Jesus Christ and the bride to be united.
[54:02] Jesus Christ himself and his bride to
[54:05] get united so that she goes from being
[54:07] the bride to becoming the
[54:09] wife. The separation for when he goes to
[54:13] reveal himself to his brethren. Just
[54:14] like the story of Joseph, she his wife
[54:18] is already in the palace. She's not
[54:20] there when he's on earth revealing
[54:22] himself in
[54:24] Egypt. They're saying it now. Come out
[54:26] from among her and be separate. The
[54:28] cry's gone out. Cry is going out. How
[54:30] long will this will the voice cry? We do
[54:33] not know. But we do know it won't be
[54:36] long, for this is the last age. He that
[54:38] hath an ear, let him hear what the
[54:40] spirit saith to the churches. Amen. The
[54:43] spirit has spoken. The setting sun is
[54:46] about to fade into eternity for the
[54:49] church ages. Then it will be all over.
[54:52] Then it will be too late to come.
[54:55] And I love how he says this, but if
[54:57] somewhere in this series, God has dealt
[54:59] with you by his spirit, if somewhere in
[55:02] this series, in any of these church
[55:03] ages, God has dealt with you by his
[55:05] spirit, may you even now turn to him in
[55:08] repentance and give your life to him
[55:10] that by his spirit he may give you
[55:12] eternal life. Amen. You know, I was just
[55:15] contemplating it today and how people
[55:17] will say that we we listen to a man
[55:20] that's that's talking here and you know,
[55:22] everybody follows a
[55:24] man, don't they? All the people that say
[55:27] they don't follow a man, but they're
[55:28] Christians. They follow Paul.
[55:31] You're following a man. Yes. Paul was
[55:33] the first church age messenger. This is
[55:36] the last church age messenger.
[55:38] It's scriptural in Malachi and
[55:40] Revelation. We know that there is
[55:42] supposed to be someone that comes to
[55:44] turn the heart of of the of the children
[55:47] to the faith of the Pentecostal father.
[55:49] So, who is that going to be and when's
[55:50] it going to happen? It's beautiful
[55:52] because I know I'm preaching to the
[55:53] choir, but sometimes there's people that
[55:54] will be listening or or maybe watching
[55:56] later. There are people that look at
[55:58] this and you know, they need to know
[56:01] that mystery is history. He's already
[56:03] come. He's already declared that this is
[56:06] an open book. Hallelujah. So tonight
[56:09] we're going to close out the Leodysian
[56:11] church age with that that sentence. And
[56:14] we're going to move into the resume of
[56:15] the ages, which is sort of a summary of
[56:18] all of the church ages. And uh he just
[56:21] says it in here. He doesn't introduce
[56:22] any new doctrine. There's no new ideas
[56:26] brought forward. It's just a
[56:27] consummation of all of them from the
[56:30] beginning to the end. So carrying on
[56:33] here he says in the resume of the ages
[56:35] due to the fact that our studies have
[56:37] been a verse byvere exposition of those
[56:39] scriptures that deal with the seven
[56:42] ages we have not set forth a continuous
[56:45] historical pattern of the church as much
[56:48] as we ought to have done. It is
[56:51] therefore our purpose now to take this
[56:54] chapter and beginning with the Ephesian
[56:57] age trace through all ages the church
[57:01] and her history as given to John by the
[57:03] spirit of God. We will not be adding new
[57:06] material as much as correlating what we
[57:10] already
[57:12] have. Excuse me. And I can't help but
[57:16] think given the chance he was on his
[57:20] road back to Jeffersonville, Indiana
[57:22] from
[57:24] Arizona. And we know that it was a car
[57:26] accident in I think Texas where he
[57:29] actually went on to go into the hospital
[57:32] and then went on to be with the
[57:34] Lord. And many people would say, well,
[57:36] if he was a prophet of God, why wasn't
[57:38] there a fiery chariot that came down and
[57:39] took him home?
[57:41] We know that Elisha actually got sick,
[57:44] didn't he? Prophets actually can get
[57:47] sick and die. That's that's the way this
[57:49] flesh has to go. But you can't kill
[57:51] their spirit because it's not their
[57:52] spirit, is it? Just like you can't kill
[57:55] our spirit because it's not our spirit.
[57:59] But I think it's interesting how uh you
[58:02] know, we can be in the mindset that we
[58:04] have got this to do because we have this
[58:06] to do. God has shown us that we have
[58:08] this to do that we actually can't be
[58:11] taken home or the rapture cannot take
[58:13] place. That's putting God in a box. He's
[58:17] God and whatever he wants to do, he'll
[58:20] do. And if he sees fit for us to not go
[58:23] and preach the trail of the serpent, the
[58:25] beast at the beginning and the beast at
[58:28] the end. If he doesn't see fit for us to
[58:31] do that, it guess what? He's going to
[58:32] take us home. And that's what brother
[58:33] Pannannah was on the road to do from
[58:35] Arizona, his home in Arizona to go to go
[58:37] to Jeffersonville to preach that that
[58:40] message. But I don't even know why I'm
[58:42] going there tonight. I think it's
[58:44] interesting though. This is uh this is
[58:46] uh I guess the exposition of the church
[58:49] ages, the summary of all of it. And I
[58:51] just I just feel like this would be
[58:53] perhaps what he would have preached is
[58:55] the resume of the ages as as he says it.
[58:59] Carrying on, he says, "From our studies,
[59:01] we have already learned that much of the
[59:04] revelation is totally misunderstood
[59:07] because we have not formally known that
[59:09] the church spoken of and spoken to in
[59:13] this book does not refer to the pure
[59:17] ecclesia, the elect, the body of Christ,
[59:20] the bride, but it speaks to the entire
[59:24] body of people who are called
[59:27] Christians, whether they be true or
[59:30] merely
[59:31] nominal. All Israel is not Israel. So
[59:35] all Christians are not
[59:38] Christians. It gets tough when you start
[59:40] looking at it from that perspective, but
[59:42] we know it. And uh I think it's worth
[59:45] saying it is, you know, the prophet said
[59:47] that there's three kinds of believers in
[59:50] every group. And it's not up to us to
[59:52] put anyone in or take anyone out. I
[59:55] would say this and I would always say
[59:57] this when I say those words. It's up to
[59:59] us to search our hearts and and and ask
[1:00:02] God to search our hearts and to try us
[1:00:04] and and and let us not be any one of the
[1:00:07] other two. But let us just be the
[1:00:08] believers.
[1:00:10] Who wants to be a makebeliever? What a
[1:00:12] miserable place to live.
[1:00:14] And an unbeliever. There ain't no point
[1:00:17] being there.
[1:00:19] But he said there's all three. So I
[1:00:21] don't know. All Israel is not Israel. So
[1:00:23] all Christians are not Christians. And
[1:00:26] and maybe you wonder why you saying
[1:00:27] that, Brother Barry. He said it in the
[1:00:29] word. God said it in the word that the
[1:00:31] two vines will be so close that it would
[1:00:33] deceive the very elected if it were
[1:00:35] possible. So we say it all the time.
[1:00:37] It's not the the ecclesiastical world
[1:00:40] out there. No, it's right here.
[1:00:45] Let us let us just be believers. Let's
[1:00:47] just be believers. It's so much easier
[1:00:50] to just be honest and be a believer than
[1:00:52] than to make believe and and and to
[1:00:54] unbelieve. My I think it takes more
[1:00:57] faith, doesn't it, to unbelief? More
[1:00:59] faith to be an atheist to try and kick
[1:01:01] against the pricks and say that there's
[1:01:02] some other solution for it all.
[1:01:08] My boy oh boy, we'll just carry on here
[1:01:10] the next paragraph. Thus, we've learned
[1:01:12] that the church is made up of two vines,
[1:01:14] the true and the false. The two vines
[1:01:17] are motivated by two kinds of spirits.
[1:01:20] And there's only two two spirits, two
[1:01:22] kinds of spirits in the world. There's
[1:01:24] many different devils which are
[1:01:27] tormentors, but there's only one spirit
[1:01:30] of Christ and one spirit of Lucifer.
[1:01:33] Those two are the spirits. The two vines
[1:01:35] are motivated by two kinds of spirits.
[1:01:37] One has the Holy Spirit while the other
[1:01:40] is endued with the spirit of Antichrist.
[1:01:44] Both claim to know and be known of
[1:01:47] God. My both purport to speak for God.
[1:01:53] Both believe certain very basic truths
[1:01:56] and differ on others. But since both
[1:01:59] bear the name of the Lord, being called
[1:02:01] Christians and by such name bearing
[1:02:05] obviously claim a relationship to him,
[1:02:08] God calls it marriage.
[1:02:11] It's so beautiful
[1:02:13] because marriage is the example of our
[1:02:16] Christian walk.
[1:02:18] I love how brother Toby brought that in
[1:02:20] the service. It's exactly God now holds
[1:02:24] them both responsible to him and
[1:02:27] therefore speaks to each both churches,
[1:02:31] both of the groups in the church, both
[1:02:33] of the vines. He speaks to both of them
[1:02:35] in the book of Revelation. We further
[1:02:38] learned that these two vines would grow
[1:02:39] side by side until the end of the ages
[1:02:42] when both would come to maturity and
[1:02:45] both be harvested. The false vine would
[1:02:48] not overcome and destroy the true vine.
[1:02:51] But then neither would the true
[1:02:54] vine be able to bring the false vine
[1:02:57] into a saving relationship with Jesus
[1:03:00] Christ. My you would think that you
[1:03:03] would be able to you would you would
[1:03:05] want to the true vine I believe desires
[1:03:07] that to see that relationship
[1:03:09] established with every
[1:03:12] human but it's not going to be possible
[1:03:16] unfortunately we learned the most
[1:03:18] amazing truth that the Holy Spirit could
[1:03:21] and would fall upon the
[1:03:23] unregenerate false vine Christians and
[1:03:27] manifest powerfully in various signs and
[1:03:30] wonders.
[1:03:31] Even as Judas had a definite ministry in
[1:03:35] the Holy Ghost, though he himself was
[1:03:38] pronounced to be a
[1:03:41] devil. Remember, manifestations are not
[1:03:45] the sign of God's approval.
[1:03:48] That is not the sign of God's spirit. We
[1:03:52] love to see the works follow, but it's
[1:03:54] got to be the word. So I want to say
[1:03:56] when you have the word first, when we
[1:03:58] have the word first, when we continually
[1:04:00] esteem the word of God to be first and
[1:04:02] then we see the signs and wonders,
[1:04:04] rejoice
[1:04:06] because we've got it in the right order.
[1:04:08] And we should expect to see the stuff
[1:04:10] happen in our
[1:04:13] lives. My with these principles in mind,
[1:04:16] we start to trace the church through the
[1:04:18] various seven ages. This is why I was
[1:04:21] talking about brother Brad. I'm
[1:04:22] preaching the trail of the serpent. Here
[1:04:24] he he's talking about it without saying
[1:04:26] it that way. The word the birth of the
[1:04:28] church was at Pentecost. As the first
[1:04:31] Adam was given a bride fresh from the
[1:04:33] hand of God and was undefiled for a
[1:04:36] brief span, so was Christ, the last Adam
[1:04:40] given a bride pure and fresh at
[1:04:42] Pentecost. And she remained separate and
[1:04:45] undefiled for some time. Acts 5:13. And
[1:04:49] of the rest no man join himself to them.
[1:04:54] Acts 2:47. And the Lord added daily such
[1:04:57] as would be saved and such as should be
[1:05:01] saved. How long this continued we do not
[1:05:04] know. But one day, even as Eve was
[1:05:07] tempted and seduced by Satan, so the
[1:05:10] church was contaminated by the entrance
[1:05:13] of an antichrist spirit. 1 John 4:3. And
[1:05:19] this is that spirit of antichrist
[1:05:21] whereof ye have heard that it should
[1:05:22] come and even now already is in the
[1:05:27] world. Revelations
[1:05:29] 2:4-5. And Jesus said concerning his
[1:05:32] bride in that first age, I have somewhat
[1:05:34] against thee because thou hast left thy
[1:05:37] first love. Remember therefore from
[1:05:40] whence thou art fallen and repent.
[1:05:44] You know, it's so
[1:05:46] wonderful in a
[1:05:48] marriage. Isn't that all we have to do
[1:05:51] when we have a problem in our marriage?
[1:05:54] When we have a situation, when things
[1:05:56] become sticky, because they will and
[1:05:58] they do. The ones that say they don't, I
[1:06:01] don't know if they actually have a if
[1:06:04] they are in a marriage because there are
[1:06:06] confusions, there are situations, there
[1:06:08] are circumstances.
[1:06:10] But you know, the only thing we need to
[1:06:13] do is repent in a marriage. If we're
[1:06:16] willing to repent in a marriage, what
[1:06:18] happens is we break. The problem fades
[1:06:21] away. But when we say, "I'm right.
[1:06:23] You're wrong. I stand on my ground. I've
[1:06:26] got my pet doctrines. I know that I'm
[1:06:28] right. Look out." What we have is a
[1:06:31] spirit of pride going on. And we know
[1:06:33] that was the first thing in heaven. That
[1:06:35] was the first sin was pride. And where
[1:06:38] pride is, all the rest of the sin comes
[1:06:39] along with it. He doesn't come alone.
[1:06:42] But here we have just a I think a really
[1:06:45] interesting example. And and and it's
[1:06:48] just a matter of repenting. That's
[1:06:50] really all that needs to happen. There
[1:06:52] just needs to be a repentance in the
[1:06:54] heart. And when there's a repentance in
[1:06:56] the heart, it actually it causes a place
[1:06:59] for love to reign. And we know that
[1:07:01] that's what it's supposed to be is uh
[1:07:04] charity. But I'm not going to get too
[1:07:06] far into that. In Corinthians, we'll
[1:07:08] carry on here. The church was in that
[1:07:10] first age already a fallen woman. As sa
[1:07:13] Satan had gotten to Eve before Adam,
[1:07:16] even now had Satan seduced the church
[1:07:19] and the bride of Christ before the
[1:07:21] marriage supper of the lamb. And what
[1:07:24] specifically was in her midst that
[1:07:27] caused the
[1:07:29] fall? What but Revelation 2:6?
[1:07:33] Oh, the deeds of the nickelatans. I love
[1:07:36] the way he lays it out here because you
[1:07:38] know, brothers and sisters, in this
[1:07:39] church age book from the beginning up
[1:07:42] until the end right now where we're at,
[1:07:44] he talks about every single church age
[1:07:47] suffering from the deeds of the
[1:07:49] nickelutans. Suffering from politics.
[1:07:52] Politics getting a hold of the church
[1:07:55] instead of the leadership of the Holy
[1:07:57] Ghost running the thing. having men
[1:07:59] raising up in the church and saying, you
[1:08:01] know, we did it this way where we came
[1:08:03] from and we did it that way where we
[1:08:05] came from and we should do it the other
[1:08:07] way
[1:08:08] now. And then the leadership of the Holy
[1:08:11] Ghost becomes deposed and it becomes a
[1:08:14] political maneuvering inside the church,
[1:08:16] not recognizing that that's actually the
[1:08:18] spirit of the antichrist creeping into
[1:08:21] the church, which will cause it to
[1:08:23] become lukewarm, formal, and powerless.
[1:08:26] And you know that can happen in the
[1:08:28] music, that can happen in the worship,
[1:08:31] that can happen in the preaching.
[1:08:33] It's a very very treacherous thing. It's
[1:08:37] very delicate. And he is so subtle.
[1:08:40] Remember, he's the most subtle beast of
[1:08:42] the field. This is who we're talking
[1:08:44] about, Lucifer, who was created co-equal
[1:08:47] with God without creative ability.
[1:08:49] There's no way that we'll outsmart him.
[1:08:51] He will always outsmart us as human
[1:08:54] beings. But it's always been politics
[1:08:57] that got in and caused the church to
[1:08:59] become lukewarm, formal, and powerless.
[1:09:02] And we need to be very careful because
[1:09:04] it's the deeds of the nickelans. It's
[1:09:05] it's the leoty being conquered by the
[1:09:09] ministry. And you know, many times we
[1:09:11] can step back and look at it and say
[1:09:13] some of the ministry that we've seen
[1:09:14] maybe in our generations, in our lives,
[1:09:16] and we say they're wacky. Look at the
[1:09:18] way they behave. Those ministers,
[1:09:20] sometimes there's ministers that are
[1:09:22] that way. You know, we don't have to
[1:09:23] look very far. There's ministers that
[1:09:24] actually accept worship in their name.
[1:09:27] Let's be honest. But you know, if they
[1:09:29] would actually refuse that, if they
[1:09:31] would put it down and say, "Stop doing
[1:09:33] that. You're making me to be an
[1:09:35] antichrist by behaving that way." Just
[1:09:37] like the prophet did. He set the
[1:09:39] example. If people would behave that way
[1:09:41] at a ministering level, at a pastoral
[1:09:44] level, at an evangelical level, in in in
[1:09:47] the five-fold ministry level, if they
[1:09:48] would do that, they would actually stop
[1:09:51] that antichrist spirit from being able
[1:09:52] to creep into the church.
[1:09:56] The deeds of the nickelatans, that's
[1:09:58] what's caused it. He goes on to say,
[1:10:01] "Already that first age had turned from
[1:10:03] following the pure word of God. They
[1:10:06] turn from God's demand of a church
[1:10:08] absolutely dependent upon him depending
[1:10:12] entirely upon God to fulfill his word
[1:10:14] from start to finish apart from human
[1:10:17] government to
[1:10:20] nickelism which is organizing a human
[1:10:23] government within the church. Sometimes
[1:10:26] it's not actually an official
[1:10:29] government. I would say most times it's
[1:10:31] not. Most times it's the power of
[1:10:33] influence. Most times it's the guy
[1:10:36] that's got the big fat tithe. I've got
[1:10:39] this tithe and if you don't do it this
[1:10:41] way, then I'm going to leave.
[1:10:43] You know, the God-scent minister is
[1:10:45] going to say, "Amen. If that's what it
[1:10:48] is, you got to go. I don't want to hold
[1:10:51] you back." But I pray that God would
[1:10:53] give you a revelation because you're not
[1:10:56] actually giving the money to this
[1:10:58] church. You're giving the money to God.
[1:11:00] Amen. I love the way we heard it. It's
[1:11:03] not our money. It's God's money. Brother
[1:11:07] John brought that out really good. But
[1:11:10] it's it's the nickelatans, the deeds of
[1:11:12] the nicicoatans. It's such a treacherous
[1:11:14] thing and it it can come in so many
[1:11:16] different forms into the framework of
[1:11:18] the Christian church. We have got to be
[1:11:20] vigilant. He says, which is organizing
[1:11:23] human government within the church,
[1:11:25] which is all governments do, legislate
[1:11:28] for the people.
[1:11:30] They did exactly what Israel did. They
[1:11:34] took the expediency of human government
[1:11:36] instead of the word and the spirit. I
[1:11:41] say, Lord, help us keep the word first
[1:11:45] and the spirit second. The word will
[1:11:48] bring the spirit. If we are willing to
[1:11:50] humble ourselves to the word of God, we
[1:11:52] will have that spirit. It's such a
[1:11:55] beautiful
[1:11:56] thing. He goes on to say, "Death had
[1:11:58] entered." How do we know? Do we not hear
[1:12:01] the voice of the spirit raised in that
[1:12:03] first age for all who will hear? As he
[1:12:05] is calling to him that overcomemeth,
[1:12:07] will I give to eat of the tree of life
[1:12:10] and the paradise of God. Can you
[1:12:13] imagine, brothers and sisters, in that
[1:12:15] first church age, they desired that?
[1:12:17] They desired to have a fully open book.
[1:12:18] And here we are at the last church age.
[1:12:20] We've got a fully open book. We have
[1:12:22] full access to that tree of life. All
[1:12:25] the cherubams have stepped aside now and
[1:12:26] they're guarding the way with their
[1:12:28] swords. so that we can get in. Whereas
[1:12:30] once upon a time, the flaming swords
[1:12:32] were guarding the way to that tree of
[1:12:34] life, that church, first church age.
[1:12:36] They wanted to find it, but we have full
[1:12:38] access to it
[1:12:39] now. God does not now. Oh my. But sorry,
[1:12:44] I got ahead of
[1:12:45] myself. How do we know? Do we not hear
[1:12:48] the voice of the spirit raised in that
[1:12:50] first age for all who will hear as he is
[1:12:53] calling? To him that overcomemeth will I
[1:12:54] give to eat of the tree of life and the
[1:12:56] paradise of God. The church had already
[1:13:00] embibed too deeply of the tree that
[1:13:02] means drink too deeply of the tree of
[1:13:05] death or denominational false vine whose
[1:13:09] end is the lake of fire already drank
[1:13:12] the poison once it's down you can't get
[1:13:15] it out. You can try all you want but
[1:13:17] you're not getting it out. And that's
[1:13:18] what they did. But there are now no
[1:13:21] cherubam with flaming swords to guard
[1:13:24] the tree of life. Now, I think it's
[1:13:27] beautiful. I'll probably be preaching on
[1:13:28] this in the near future. You know what?
[1:13:30] Those flaming swords were put back into
[1:13:32] the hand of man, weren't they up in
[1:13:35] Sabinia Canyon? Why was there a sword
[1:13:37] put in the hand of the prophet? Why was
[1:13:39] all that Adam lost restored unto him?
[1:13:41] Why did he he preached that? Because
[1:13:43] that's where those swords went, I
[1:13:46] believe, to give full access to that
[1:13:49] tree of life. Amen. God does not now
[1:13:52] depart from the midst of the church as
[1:13:54] he departed from Eden. Oh no, he will
[1:13:58] ever be in the midst of his church until
[1:14:00] the final age. And until that time, he
[1:14:04] calls to all to come. Now, please let us
[1:14:08] be careful here. This message to the
[1:14:11] angel of the church which is at Ephesus
[1:14:14] is not a message to the actual local
[1:14:17] Ephesian church.
[1:14:20] It is a message to the age.
[1:14:24] And that age had in it the seed of truth
[1:14:28] and the seed of error exactly as set
[1:14:32] forth according to the parable of the
[1:14:34] wheat and excuse me and the tears. The
[1:14:37] church ages is the field and in it are
[1:14:41] the wheat and the tears. The false
[1:14:43] church
[1:14:44] organized, humanized the government and
[1:14:47] the word and fought the true
[1:14:51] Christian. You know, brothers and
[1:14:53] sisters, it we read it in in the church
[1:14:56] ages earlier on. Brother Brandham says
[1:14:59] it, I believe the Holy Ghost in brother
[1:15:01] Brandham says it that the elect cannot
[1:15:05] persecute or harm the elect. That is
[1:15:09] right in this church age book. The elect
[1:15:11] cannot persecute and harm the elect.
[1:15:16] Amen. He says that it's the reprobates
[1:15:18] that do it. And the reprobates are the
[1:15:20] ones that cast themselves out. They're
[1:15:23] the ones that are not a part of the
[1:15:25] economy of God. So when we see
[1:15:27] persecutions, when we see anger, when we
[1:15:30] see people rising up and getting angry
[1:15:33] and persecuting, we know that that's not
[1:15:35] the spirit of Christ.
[1:15:38] And we need to just be able to identify
[1:15:40] it. Not not so that we can actually try
[1:15:43] and put anybody out. We don't want to do
[1:15:44] that. We would that everyone would come
[1:15:46] in.
[1:15:49] And that age had in it the seed of truth
[1:15:52] and the seed of error exactly as set
[1:15:54] forth according to the parable of the
[1:15:56] wheat and the tears. The church age is
[1:15:58] the field. In it are the wheat and the
[1:16:00] tears. The false church organized,
[1:16:02] humanized the government and the word
[1:16:05] and fought the true Christian. Tears
[1:16:09] always flourish
[1:16:12] mightier. I have that highlighted. Tears
[1:16:16] always flourish mightier than wheat or
[1:16:20] any other cultivated plant. Isn't that
[1:16:24] interesting? The tear church grew
[1:16:26] rapidly in this first age. But the wheat
[1:16:30] church was flourishing also. By the end
[1:16:33] of the first age, the deeds of the
[1:16:36] nicicoatans were flourishing in the
[1:16:39] local false vine churches with
[1:16:41] increasing attempts to spread their
[1:16:44] influence further than their own body.
[1:16:48] Its influence was felt upon the true
[1:16:52] church for men like the venerable
[1:16:55] polycarp. Someone who is very highly
[1:16:58] esteemed or respected. That's venerable.
[1:17:02] By the venerable polycarp we're calling
[1:17:04] themselves bishops with a reference to
[1:17:08] that title which was not inherent in it
[1:17:11] according to the word. And we know that
[1:17:14] we also read in the church age book a
[1:17:16] few chapters back about this very thing
[1:17:19] where they were calling themselves
[1:17:20] bishops and elders. Brother Brandham
[1:17:22] says very clearly an elder in the church
[1:17:25] is someone with age. They've been in the
[1:17:28] church a long time. They've got
[1:17:30] experience under their belt. That is the
[1:17:32] definition of elder. There is no
[1:17:35] eldership anointing of elders in the
[1:17:37] church of the living God. That is not
[1:17:40] true according to the message of the
[1:17:41] hour. However, there's people that do
[1:17:43] believe that and hold to that doctrine
[1:17:45] and and that's theirs. That's not the
[1:17:48] true doctrine of this message. Tears
[1:17:51] always flourish mightier than wheat or
[1:17:54] any other cultivated plant. The tear
[1:17:56] church grew rapidly in the first age,
[1:17:57] but the wheat church was flourishing
[1:17:59] also. By the end of the first age, the
[1:18:02] deeds of the nickelutans were
[1:18:03] flourishing in the local false vine
[1:18:06] churches with increasing attempts to
[1:18:08] spread their influence further than
[1:18:11] their own body. Its influence was felt
[1:18:14] upon the true church for men like
[1:18:16] venerable Polycarp were calling
[1:18:18] themselves bishops with a reference to
[1:18:20] that title which was not inherent in it
[1:18:23] according to the word. Also in that age,
[1:18:26] the true church had lost its first love.
[1:18:30] That love was typified as the love of
[1:18:33] bride and groom at their marriage and
[1:18:37] early years of wedded
[1:18:39] life. There was a cooling of that
[1:18:42] complete
[1:18:43] love and abandonment to God. And you
[1:18:46] know brothers and sisters in marriage
[1:18:48] that's exactly what can happen. We can
[1:18:51] have a beautiful marriage. Bride and
[1:18:54] groom fall in love and you live the
[1:18:57] early years of your wed life and the
[1:19:00] complexes of life come around and they
[1:19:03] cause us to get caught up in our own
[1:19:05] moments and we drift apart. That that
[1:19:08] that closeness is is now not there. And
[1:19:12] what happens is we become separated
[1:19:15] people living in the same place
[1:19:17] sometimes still husband and wife but
[1:19:20] without that really close bond. And you
[1:19:24] know what has to happen? There just
[1:19:25] needs to be a repenting. Isn't it
[1:19:27] interesting? It's exactly the same thing
[1:19:30] with Christ that we're reading about
[1:19:31] here. We can have a cooling off in our
[1:19:34] marriage with him if we're not careful.
[1:19:37] We have to cultivate our marriage. We
[1:19:40] have to cultivate our marriage here
[1:19:42] naturally. We have to cultivate our
[1:19:43] marriage spiritually. It takes
[1:19:48] work. There was a cooling of that
[1:19:51] complete love and abandonment to God.
[1:19:54] But notice Revelations 2:1 describes the
[1:19:57] Lord Jesus as in the midst of his church
[1:20:00] and holding the messengers in his right
[1:20:02] hand. Because this bride has fallen
[1:20:07] because the church corporate is now an
[1:20:11] ad mixture of true and false. He does
[1:20:14] not leave it. It is his. Isn't that
[1:20:18] beautiful? Even though it's defiled, he
[1:20:20] doesn't leave it. Even though it's
[1:20:22] complicated and political, he doesn't
[1:20:25] leave it. I think that's so beautiful.
[1:20:27] It's a wonderful thing. It is his. And
[1:20:31] according to Romans 14, that is exactly
[1:20:34] right. Romans 14:7-9. For none of us
[1:20:38] liveth to himself, and no man dieth to
[1:20:41] himself. For whether we live, we live
[1:20:44] unto the Lord. And whether we die, we
[1:20:47] die unto the Lord. Whether we live,
[1:20:50] therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
[1:20:53] Amen. For to this end Christ both died
[1:20:56] and rose and revived that he might be
[1:20:59] the Lord of both the dead and the
[1:21:01] living. Amen. On the cross he bought the
[1:21:05] whole world of people. Isn't that
[1:21:08] beautiful? Hallelujah. And you know
[1:21:11] there's a scripture I can't remember
[1:21:12] where it is. I think it's in uh in John
[1:21:15] that we are his inheritance.
[1:21:19] Maybe it's in Romans. We are his
[1:21:21] inheritance. He purchased it. It is
[1:21:24] purchased by the father through the
[1:21:27] death of his son on the cross. On the
[1:21:30] cross, he bought the whole world of
[1:21:32] people. They are his. He is the lord of
[1:21:35] the living and the dead as pertaining to
[1:21:38] ownership. Not relationship. Remember
[1:21:41] when we studied that? Isn't that
[1:21:43] beautiful? It's ownership. He owns us.
[1:21:48] He owns us. My and you know we could
[1:21:52] look at our family and say that we own
[1:21:54] our families too. And truly indeed we do
[1:21:57] but we don't dominate them as though
[1:21:59] we're owners. It's not that kind of
[1:22:02] ownership. And he walks in the midst of
[1:22:05] that body that has within it life and
[1:22:09] death in that church. He knows who is
[1:22:12] who. He knows what's in the hearts of
[1:22:15] men. Amen. What was planted in the first
[1:22:18] age will develop in the second age and
[1:22:21] in all other ages until it comes to
[1:22:24] maturity and harvest. Thus, in the
[1:22:27] Simian age, we expect the enlargement
[1:22:29] and enlightenment of the church
[1:22:31] corporates history through a revelation
[1:22:34] of the
[1:22:36] spirit. In this age, the hatred of the
[1:22:38] false vine increases. See, they have
[1:22:42] verse nine separated themselves from the
[1:22:44] company of the true. They went out from
[1:22:47] them. They were liars. They called
[1:22:51] themselves what they are not. But did
[1:22:54] God destroy them? No. Let them alone.
[1:22:58] And both will go to the
[1:23:01] harvest. It's another good reason. I
[1:23:03] just love preaching the word. Just
[1:23:04] preaching the truth. It's up to God to
[1:23:07] do the separating. It's not up to us.
[1:23:09] Amen. God's word does all the
[1:23:10] separating. God's word is a sword that's
[1:23:13] sharper than any two-edged sword. It
[1:23:16] will do the
[1:23:18] dividing. My in this age the hatred of
[1:23:21] the false vine increases. See that verse
[1:23:23] n separated themselves from the company
[1:23:25] of the true. They went out from them.
[1:23:27] They were liars. They called themselves
[1:23:29] what they are not. But did God destroy
[1:23:31] them? No. Let them alone. Both will go
[1:23:34] to the harvest. But Lord, they should be
[1:23:37] destroyed, for they are destroying thy
[1:23:40] people. They are killing
[1:23:43] them. Nope. Let them
[1:23:48] alone. But to my bride, I say, be thou
[1:23:50] faithful unto death. Love me even
[1:23:55] more. Sometimes that's tough with bitter
[1:23:59] persecution.
[1:24:01] We learn in no uncertain terms that this
[1:24:04] false vine is the vine of
[1:24:07] Satan. Their gathering is of him, Satan.
[1:24:12] They meet in the name of God and
[1:24:16] lie that they are Christs.
[1:24:19] They
[1:24:20] preach, they
[1:24:22] teach, they
[1:24:24] baptize, they
[1:24:26] worship, they partake of various rights
[1:24:29] given by Christ to the
[1:24:31] church. Yet they are not of
[1:24:34] God. But since they say they are, God
[1:24:38] will hold them
[1:24:39] responsible. And in each
[1:24:42] age, he speaks of them and to them.
[1:24:48] I think that's such a heavy powerful
[1:24:50] statement right there. The people who
[1:24:53] are the pretenders, the ones who
[1:24:56] actually claim Jesus Christ but are not
[1:24:59] willing to actually come all the way
[1:25:01] according to the word. Isn't it amazing
[1:25:03] to think that he doesn't just get rid of
[1:25:06] them? But what he does is he sees it as
[1:25:09] he's purchased everyone and he will hold
[1:25:11] each one accountable to their
[1:25:14] relationship, to their their confession.
[1:25:17] And I think brother Brandham, he even
[1:25:19] talks about it. You know, the drunkards,
[1:25:21] they're not worried about the judgment
[1:25:22] of God. The murderers, they're not
[1:25:25] worried about the judgment of God. The
[1:25:28] ones who are worried are the ones that
[1:25:30] know they don't got it right. The ones
[1:25:32] that know they're just holding back a
[1:25:34] little bit. There's something in their
[1:25:36] heart that they just can't let go of.
[1:25:38] They're just a little bit reserved.
[1:25:39] They're the ones that are afraid of
[1:25:41] what's going to happen. But I just think
[1:25:44] it's amazing here. He says, "Since they
[1:25:45] say they are Christians, since they say
[1:25:47] they are, God will hold them
[1:25:50] responsible. And in each age, he speaks
[1:25:53] of them and to them." I want to say
[1:25:55] tonight, brothers and sisters, don't be
[1:25:57] one of them. Go on to be one of the
[1:26:00] truly elect of God. Give yourself wholly
[1:26:03] over to his word. Have no reservation
[1:26:06] about this message of the hour. If you
[1:26:08] don't understand it or you can't figure
[1:26:10] it out, just ask him to come and explain
[1:26:12] it to you. And I guarantee you if you
[1:26:14] give him the full preeminence that he
[1:26:17] will explain it, it will become a new
[1:26:19] book through the lens of the message of
[1:26:21] the hour. It's such a beautiful
[1:26:25] thing to think that we won't even have
[1:26:28] to go and stand before that throne
[1:26:29] because we'll be in that throne.
[1:26:31] We'll be seated in judgment with him and
[1:26:34] and and
[1:26:35] and having mercy upon who we will have
[1:26:39] mercy. crying out for the people who
[1:26:41] don't have a hope, hoping that somehow
[1:26:45] someway they did do something for the
[1:26:47] bride, for the elect in the age in which
[1:26:49] they lived, even though they claimed to
[1:26:52] be a Christian.
[1:26:53] My he goes on to say, they remind us
[1:26:56] exactly of Balum. Remember the deeds of
[1:26:59] the nickelans. You can't have nickelism
[1:27:02] without this fella turning up, without
[1:27:05] this behavior here.
[1:27:07] Balamism. They remind us exactly of
[1:27:10] Balum. He had the prophetic office. He
[1:27:13] knew the proper approach unto God as
[1:27:15] demonstrated in the sacrifice of the
[1:27:18] clean
[1:27:19] beasts. Yet he was not a true word
[1:27:23] prophet.
[1:27:25] For when God told him not to go honor
[1:27:31] Bailac, sorry, when God told him not to
[1:27:36] go honor Bailac with his
[1:27:38] presence, he sought to go anyway, for he
[1:27:42] was
[1:27:43] motivated by his lust for gold and
[1:27:47] prestige. Those giants were pretty big
[1:27:49] in his life.
[1:27:51] We don't want to be motivated by a lust
[1:27:55] for gold or prestige in this life,
[1:27:58] brothers and sisters.
[1:28:00] So God let him
[1:28:01] go. The perfect will of God gave way to
[1:28:04] the permissive will of God because of
[1:28:07] the heart desire of
[1:28:09] Balum. God actually said, "Go ahead."
[1:28:13] Isn't it interesting? Because he asked
[1:28:15] God first and God said, "No, don't go."
[1:28:18] Right? But he had to go back and ask
[1:28:20] again because he had this thing in his
[1:28:22] heart. And then God did say go. And he
[1:28:25] says, "Did God change his mind?" "No,
[1:28:28] sir." God had his way regardless of
[1:28:31] Balum going. Balum did not enol the will
[1:28:35] of God. God had his way regardless. It
[1:28:39] was Balum who was the loser for he
[1:28:42] bypassed the word. And today we have
[1:28:45] that very same thing. women preachers,
[1:28:49] organization, false doctrine, etc., and
[1:28:53] people worshiping God, manifesting in
[1:28:56] the spirit, and going right on as did
[1:28:59] Balum, claiming that God has spoken to
[1:29:03] them, even when the commission received
[1:29:07] is opposite to the revealed word. That's
[1:29:10] right.
[1:29:12] And I will not deny that God spoke to
[1:29:15] them. But it was just like when he spoke
[1:29:18] to Balum that second time. That's where
[1:29:21] we need to be very cautious and careful.
[1:29:24] We need to make sure that we're
[1:29:26] following the word of God. Amen.
[1:29:29] And I say, Lord, check me. Help me know.
[1:29:32] Cuz boy, I don't want to get that way.
[1:29:36] I know many times we can want something
[1:29:38] real bad in our life and God just
[1:29:41] doesn't give it to us. And because he
[1:29:43] doesn't give it to us doesn't mean that
[1:29:44] he won't give it to us. Maybe he's just
[1:29:46] not giving it to us right now. But we
[1:29:48] need to have the patience to trust him
[1:29:50] as our Lord, as our God, and let him
[1:29:53] bring it to pass. Amen.
[1:29:57] I just think it's amazing how he says
[1:29:59] this. And I will not deny that God spoke
[1:30:01] to them. But it was just like when he
[1:30:04] spoke to Balam that second time as he
[1:30:07] knew that Balum wanted his own heart
[1:30:09] desire above the word and he gave it to
[1:30:12] him yet all the while in the end having
[1:30:16] his own
[1:30:18] way. Even so today God tells folks go
[1:30:22] ahead with your own heart's desires for
[1:30:25] they will already be rejected. They w
[1:30:28] have already rejected the word, but the
[1:30:32] will of God will be done regardless.
[1:30:34] Amen. And I've heard it said
[1:30:37] before that God will sometimes let us
[1:30:40] get into his permissive will and he will
[1:30:41] allow us to go through the fence board,
[1:30:43] the knot hole in the fence board
[1:30:45] sideways. He'll let us have a bumpy road
[1:30:48] in our life. We'll have some problems.
[1:30:50] We'll have some circumstances and some
[1:30:53] situations to get us to look up. God
[1:30:57] will always have his will come to pass.
[1:31:01] The will of God will always be done
[1:31:02] regardless. Amen. I hope you see this.
[1:31:05] It will not only clear up much of what
[1:31:07] is seen in all ages, but it will
[1:31:11] especially help in this last age which
[1:31:14] has so much manifestation and external
[1:31:17] blessings when the whole period is so
[1:31:20] against the word revealed will of God.
[1:31:25] Amen.
[1:31:26] I think that's so important. That
[1:31:28] three-word statement, word, revealed,
[1:31:31] will
[1:31:35] his will is his word.
[1:31:37] If ever in an age received a message
[1:31:40] loud and clear, this age did. It was and
[1:31:44] is that Old Testament truth. The son of
[1:31:48] the bond woman will distress the son of
[1:31:51] the free woman until the son of the bond
[1:31:54] woman be cast out. That lets us know
[1:31:58] that the hatred and blasphemy of Satan
[1:32:02] against the true Christian will be
[1:32:04] vented through a group who are nominal
[1:32:08] false Christians. And this will increase
[1:32:12] until God uproots that false vine at the
[1:32:15] end of the Leodysian age. And you know,
[1:32:19] brothers and sisters, we might not see
[1:32:21] it, but I can tell you just by my own
[1:32:23] experience, by a little bit of study
[1:32:25] that's going on right now on the message
[1:32:28] of the hour. They are attacking William
[1:32:31] Marryiam Brham savagely, calling him all
[1:32:34] manner of names. I'm not going to get up
[1:32:36] and give them any credit, but what I am
[1:32:38] going to say is exactly what he said
[1:32:40] would happen is happening right now.
[1:32:43] Right now, today. And you can bet that
[1:32:45] they're going to keep pushing until it
[1:32:47] comes to the place where the government
[1:32:48] steps in and says, "If you get together
[1:32:51] and you mention this guy's name, we will
[1:32:54] shut you down." That day is very fast
[1:32:57] approaching. That's why I think it's so
[1:32:59] beautiful. We've got every single
[1:33:00] opportunity when we come to service to
[1:33:02] worship. Amen.
[1:33:04] One of these days it could change. We
[1:33:06] saw it happen with co brothers and
[1:33:07] sisters. And just before that happened,
[1:33:09] we had one of the best worship services
[1:33:11] I think we almost ever had. Just
[1:33:14] tremendous what can happen when we just
[1:33:16] let our inhibitions go and just give him
[1:33:19] freespirited worship. We don't have to
[1:33:21] worry. But uh we have every opportunity
[1:33:24] to give him our very best when we come
[1:33:26] to church. I I think that as we see that
[1:33:29] day approaching, um I just want to turn
[1:33:32] up the volume
[1:33:37] myself. My
[1:33:40] goodness. The third age revealed by the
[1:33:42] spirit the prophecy that the worldly
[1:33:45] church would adopt nickelatanism as a
[1:33:48] doctrine.
[1:33:50] The separation of the clergy from the
[1:33:53] leoty grew from the biblical truth of
[1:33:56] the elders, shepherds of the flocks,
[1:33:58] ruling the flock by the word to the
[1:34:01] deeds of the
[1:34:03] nicicoatans, wherein the clergy set
[1:34:05] themselves in ranks one over the
[1:34:09] other, which unscriptural
[1:34:14] formula then evolved into a priesthood
[1:34:18] that placed the clergy
[1:34:20] between man and God, giving the clergy
[1:34:23] certain rights, all the while denying
[1:34:27] the leoty their god-given
[1:34:30] rights. This was
[1:34:32] usurpation. In this age, it became a
[1:34:36] doctrine. It was established in the
[1:34:39] church as they assured as the assured
[1:34:43] word of God, which indeed it was not,
[1:34:46] but the clergy called it the word of
[1:34:47] God. And therefore the doctrine was
[1:34:51] antichrist. And that can happen in our
[1:34:53] day, brothers and sisters, where people
[1:34:55] can become a part of a church that gets
[1:34:57] set up, started, and they rely on the
[1:35:00] people that set up and start the church
[1:35:02] instead of seeing a spiritfilled pastor
[1:35:05] rise up in that church and become a
[1:35:08] sovereign body. That is exactly what
[1:35:11] happens. And and it's indeed necessary
[1:35:13] for people to help start a church. But
[1:35:15] once that church is started, then it's
[1:35:18] time to take hands off and let the Lord
[1:35:20] run that
[1:35:21] church. He goes on to say, because human
[1:35:24] government is politics, pure and simple,
[1:35:27] the church became involved in politics.
[1:35:31] This involvement was welcomed by a
[1:35:34] dictator emperor who joined the church
[1:35:36] politics with state politics and by
[1:35:39] force established the false church,
[1:35:42] Satan's false religion as the true
[1:35:44] religion. And though various edicts by
[1:35:47] various emperors, we find the false
[1:35:50] church with state power destroying the
[1:35:52] true vine even more avidly.
[1:35:57] Sad to say, the true vine was not
[1:35:59] exactly immune to this doctrine. By
[1:36:03] that, I do not mean that the true vine
[1:36:06] ever did establish the nicicoatan ideas
[1:36:09] as a doctrine. Far from it. But that
[1:36:13] little worm of death kept sucking at the
[1:36:17] true vine, hoping that it might fall.
[1:36:21] Even within the true church, men whom
[1:36:24] God had called
[1:36:27] overseers were holding that title to
[1:36:30] mean a little more than just a local
[1:36:35] responsibility. It was not the clear
[1:36:38] understanding of Paul that existed in
[1:36:41] the church at this time. For Paul had
[1:36:44] said, "And they glorified God in me."
[1:36:46] Galatians 1:24. No matter what authority
[1:36:50] Paul had, he kept the people looking to
[1:36:54] God from whom is all authority.
[1:36:59] The moment we get people looking to us,
[1:37:03] it's nickelanism.
[1:37:07] No matter what authority Paul had, he
[1:37:09] kept the people looking to God from whom
[1:37:11] is all authority. But the clergy was
[1:37:15] always looking to divine leadership plus
[1:37:22] human. And thus in giving honor where
[1:37:26] honor was not due, we find that the true
[1:37:29] church was spotted with
[1:37:32] humanism with nickelanism established.
[1:37:37] Remember, remember brothers and sisters,
[1:37:39] as we say this, as we talk about this,
[1:37:41] as I preach it, it's not a raging
[1:37:45] monster. It's just a subtle whisper.
[1:37:48] It's just an undercurrent. It's just a
[1:37:50] conversation over a coffee, conversation
[1:37:53] in the corner of the church, in the
[1:37:55] basement, or in the parking lot or over
[1:37:58] a dinner. It's a very, very subtle
[1:38:01] thing. It's not a raging monster what
[1:38:04] we're talking about here.
[1:38:06] The church was spotted with
[1:38:08] humanism. With nickelatanism
[1:38:11] established, apostolic succession placed
[1:38:15] ministers, pastors voted in,
[1:38:19] etc. It was only one step for the false
[1:38:22] church to proceed to
[1:38:24] balamism. The second step to the depths
[1:38:27] of Satan was now in full
[1:38:31] progress.
[1:38:33] Remember he says it very clearly. There
[1:38:35] is no such thing as apostolic
[1:38:38] succession.
[1:38:39] Nobody according to the church of the
[1:38:42] living God is simply appointed in.
[1:38:44] That's not the way it works. Nobody is
[1:38:47] simply given a title of a leader of a
[1:38:50] church just because they're born in the
[1:38:52] lineage of a church. That's not the way
[1:38:54] it works. There has to be the voice of
[1:38:56] the Holy Ghost in the people in the body
[1:38:59] of believers. There has to be otherwise
[1:39:03] we have uh this combination of the
[1:39:06] nickelanism and
[1:39:08] balamism and it is a slippery slope once
[1:39:11] you get down that road. The second step
[1:39:14] was the doctrine of Balum described in
[1:39:17] revelations
[1:39:18] 2:14 wherein Balam taught Bailo to
[1:39:22] stumble the children of Israel by united
[1:39:25] meeting. and and how how did he actually
[1:39:29] get him to do it? I believe we'll
[1:39:32] probably wind up closing out with this
[1:39:34] this paragraph here because it's such an
[1:39:37] important one, brothers and
[1:39:39] sisters. The way that he did it for
[1:39:41] those who don't remember, and even those
[1:39:44] who do, I'm just going to talk about it.
[1:39:46] He actually took them and showed them
[1:39:48] the hinderer parts of the people in
[1:39:51] multiple different angles, not just
[1:39:53] once, but multiple times. took this
[1:39:57] prophet of God and showed all of the
[1:39:59] hinderer parts of the people talking
[1:40:02] about their weaknesses, talking about
[1:40:04] how they behave in this situation and
[1:40:07] how they behave in that situation. You
[1:40:09] know, we're honestly we're all human
[1:40:11] beings and we've got the the beautiful
[1:40:14] polished bright side that we all like to
[1:40:18] display to the world around us. But we
[1:40:20] all have hinder parts, too. We all have
[1:40:23] weaknesses. And you know, Satan is just
[1:40:26] waiting for the opportunity to actually
[1:40:29] get in a conversation just like this one
[1:40:32] here we're talking about. That is how he
[1:40:35] got them to believe they were all united
[1:40:38] together. That was the that was the
[1:40:40] actual action part of it. But before it
[1:40:43] happened, we know that Bailo taught
[1:40:46] Balam to cast a stumbling block before
[1:40:48] the children of Israel. And how did he
[1:40:50] do it? He actually got them looking at
[1:40:52] their hinder parts. It's such a
[1:40:54] difficult thing, but I think we really
[1:40:56] need to remember, let's talk about the
[1:40:58] the front parts of one another. Let's
[1:41:00] talk about the good things. The prophet
[1:41:01] of God said, "Say good things. Don't
[1:41:05] talk bad about someone." You don't have
[1:41:07] to kill someone. You can assassinate
[1:41:09] them by talking about their character.
[1:41:11] Amen.
[1:41:14] Alls we need to do is say good things.
[1:41:17] Let the Holy Ghost rule. Amen. And you
[1:41:20] know, nobody will hear us when we're
[1:41:22] talking at our dinner table or driving
[1:41:23] in our car. Nobody will hear the slaying
[1:41:26] that's going on when we're talking about
[1:41:28] our brother and our sister or other
[1:41:30] people. No one will hear the slaughter
[1:41:33] taking place, but God does. And and and
[1:41:37] who more important is there to hear what
[1:41:39] we're saying? But God. And you know what
[1:41:43] else happens is Satan hears it, too. And
[1:41:45] then he thinks, "Right on. Now I've got
[1:41:46] a foothold. Now I'm getting through my
[1:41:48] doctrine of the of the balumism is
[1:41:51] actually taking hold. This is actually
[1:41:54] taking place in this person's life. Now
[1:41:56] I know that I can continue on with them
[1:41:58] and you can watch it will just progress
[1:42:00] if it's not dealt with. It is a terrible
[1:42:03] thing this doctrine of Balum. The second
[1:42:06] step was the doctrine of Balum described
[1:42:08] in Revelations 2:14 where Balum taught
[1:42:10] Bailo to stumble the children of Israel.
[1:42:14] I said that wrong earlier. I said it
[1:42:15] backwards. I apologize. to stumble the
[1:42:18] children of Israel by a united meeting.
[1:42:21] There the guests would do two more
[1:42:24] things contrary to the word of God. You
[1:42:27] recall that Bailac needed help to keep
[1:42:30] his
[1:42:31] kingdom. He called on the most dominant
[1:42:33] spiritual figure of his day, Balam.
[1:42:36] Balam gave the advice that trapped and
[1:42:40] destroyed Israel. Can you imagine how
[1:42:42] he'll answer for that one day? the gift
[1:42:45] that God gave him to be a prophet, a
[1:42:47] God-given prophet, and then he took it
[1:42:49] and used it that way. My Balum gave the
[1:42:53] advice that trapped and destroyed
[1:42:54] Israel. It was first of all to suggest
[1:42:58] that they all get together and talk
[1:43:00] things over and eat together and get
[1:43:03] things ironed out. My get a bunch of
[1:43:07] ministers together and start disputing
[1:43:09] doctrine.
[1:43:10] Okay, after all, understanding each
[1:43:14] other goes a long way, right? Once you
[1:43:17] accomplish that, you can go from there.
[1:43:20] The next step would be worshiping
[1:43:23] together. And of course, a little
[1:43:25] pressure from the host usually makes the
[1:43:28] guests go a lot further than they
[1:43:30] intended. Now that didn't only happen
[1:43:33] back there to God's church of the Old
[1:43:36] Testament, but it happened to the church
[1:43:38] of the New Testament. For there was an
[1:43:41] emperor who like Bailo needed help to
[1:43:43] secure his
[1:43:45] kingdom. My so Constantine invited the
[1:43:48] nominal Christian first Christian church
[1:43:52] of Rome to help get him the Christians
[1:43:55] behind
[1:43:56] him as they were a very large body. The
[1:44:00] outcome was the Nyine Council of
[1:44:04] 3:25. There the Christians, both true
[1:44:07] and nominal, came together at the
[1:44:10] invitation of
[1:44:12] Constantine. The true Christians had no
[1:44:15] business even going up to the meeting.
[1:44:18] Can you believe that? They had no
[1:44:20] business going to that meeting.
[1:44:23] Goodness. I'll call the musicians as we
[1:44:25] close tonight.
[1:44:28] They had no business going up to that
[1:44:30] meeting. In spite of all Constantine
[1:44:34] Constantine could do to unite them all,
[1:44:38] the real believers knew they were out of
[1:44:41] place and left. But to those who
[1:44:44] remained, Constantine gave of the
[1:44:47] state's treasury along with political
[1:44:50] and physical force.
[1:44:52] The people were introduced to idol
[1:44:55] worship and
[1:44:57] spiritism. For statues with the names of
[1:45:00] saints were placed in the buildings, and
[1:45:02] the people were taught to commune with
[1:45:04] the dead or pray to saints, which is
[1:45:08] nothing more nor less than
[1:45:11] spiritism. for the food that man truly
[1:45:14] needs, even the word of God. They were
[1:45:17] given creeds and dogmas and rituals,
[1:45:21] which were also enforced by the state.
[1:45:25] And above all, they were given three
[1:45:28] gods with a triple compound name of the
[1:45:31] one true God. and water baptism in the
[1:45:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ gave way
[1:45:38] to the pagan baptism of three titles.
[1:45:46] My the real believers ought not to have
[1:45:49] gone there. They had already lost much
[1:45:53] truth. And now they too would lose the
[1:45:57] understanding of Godhead and forfeit
[1:46:00] names for titles in water
[1:46:04] baptism. Maybe stand with me as we close
[1:46:07] tonight. He says, "Now watch this
[1:46:09] doctrine of Balum most
[1:46:11] carefully. Notice above all that it is
[1:46:16] deliberate. It is the deliberate
[1:46:19] maneuver of a corrupt clergy to bind the
[1:46:23] people to them by leading the people
[1:46:27] deliberately into the sin of unbelief.
[1:46:31] The nickelan doctrine was the corruption
[1:46:34] of the clergy as they sought political
[1:46:38] power amongst
[1:46:39] themselves. While
[1:46:41] balamism is the subjection of the people
[1:46:44] to their system of creed and worship in
[1:46:47] order to hold
[1:46:49] them. My now watch this carefully. What
[1:46:53] was it that bound the people to the
[1:46:55] nominal church and thereby destroyed
[1:46:58] them? What was it? It was the creeds and
[1:47:03] dogmas formed in church
[1:47:06] tenants. It was the doctrine of the
[1:47:09] Roman Catholic
[1:47:11] Church. They were not given the true
[1:47:14] food, the word. They were given the food
[1:47:17] that came from idol worship.
[1:47:20] Babylonian paganism wrapped up in
[1:47:24] Christian
[1:47:26] terminology. And the very same spirit
[1:47:30] and doctrine is amongst all
[1:47:33] Protestants and it is called
[1:47:38] denomination. My the leadership of men
[1:47:42] instead of the leadership of the Holy
[1:47:44] Ghost. We'll stop there tonight. Let's
[1:47:47] just bow in
[1:47:48] prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord
[1:47:50] Jesus, we just thank you for your word.
[1:47:53] Thank you for the the office of a
[1:47:56] vindicated prophet.
[1:47:58] Lord, thank you that Lord we are able to
[1:48:02] recognize
[1:48:03] that we live in a world of 8 billion
[1:48:06] people.
[1:48:07] Lord, very few, very, very few people
[1:48:11] are able to recognize what you've done
[1:48:14] in this last age. And Lord, we don't
[1:48:17] count it a great thing for us. Lord, we
[1:48:20] count it in in absolute humility because
[1:48:23] we recognize that the only way that we
[1:48:26] are able to see this is because you have
[1:48:28] chosen us to do so. And Lord, we don't
[1:48:31] want to take and add a word to it and we
[1:48:34] don't want to take a word from it. We're
[1:48:37] so thankful that this prophet, this
[1:48:39] messenger that you gave to this age
[1:48:42] simply pointed to your word.
[1:48:45] Father, I just pray tonight that he that
[1:48:48] hath an ear, let him hear what your
[1:48:50] spirit saith unto the church in this
[1:48:52] last
[1:48:53] day. We know not what time you will take
[1:48:57] us home, but we know that day is is so
[1:49:00] close. Help us, Father, to be ready.
[1:49:03] Help each one of us to search our hearts
[1:49:05] and our minds, Lord. and and more than
[1:49:08] that to give you the ability to search
[1:49:10] our hearts and our
[1:49:12] minds. Lord, that we would just be
[1:49:14] correct according to your word for our
[1:49:16] day. Lord, we love you and we thank you.
[1:49:19] We pray that you would just keep your
[1:49:20] hand upon us as we go our separate ways
[1:49:22] tonight. We just ask if it be your will
[1:49:25] that you would bring us back again on
[1:49:27] Sunday. Thank you for the ability to
[1:49:29] have a communion service, Lord. We look
[1:49:32] forward to it and we just ask that you
[1:49:34] would do something special for us, Lord.
[1:49:37] in that very
[1:49:38] service. Now, just keep your hand upon
[1:49:41] us, Lord, and receive the worship,
[1:49:43] Father, as we close with a few songs.
[1:49:45] Now, we just ask all these things in
[1:49:47] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:52] Amen. Can we sing
[1:49:55] 1201, Psalm 34?
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:11] I'm sorry. I sought the
