[47:48] given him praise from your heart this
[47:49] morning. Stand with me if you would as
[47:51] we change the order and ask our pastor
[47:54] to come. The highlight of the of the
[47:55] service we know is the word preaching
[47:58] the word instant season. I love this
[48:01] song. You were the word at the
[48:03] beginning. He's the same yesterday,
[48:06] today, and forever. What a wonderful,
[48:08] what a powerful, what a glorious name it
[48:10] is that the name of Jesus that we serve.
[48:13] For you were the word at the
[48:19] beginning, one with
[48:22] God, Lord most
[48:28] high, your hidden glory in creation.
[48:35] Now we
[48:37] feel you our
[48:40] Christ. What a beautiful name it
[48:44] is. What a beautiful name it
[48:47] is. That name of
[48:51] Jesus Christ my
[48:55] king. What a beautiful name it
[48:59] is. I think it is.
[49:03] But you believe it is the name of
[49:12] Jesus. You did one day
[49:17] without. So Jesus,
[49:20] you never down. That's you and me. Oh my
[49:28] sin was greater. Your love was gater.
[49:34] [Applause]
[49:34] [Music]
[49:38] Oh, what a wonderful
[49:42] day. What a
[49:47] wonderful
[49:49] Jesus Christ.
[49:57] [Music]
[50:00] is
[50:02] what is the name of
[50:08] Jesus death could not hold
[50:13] you before
[50:15] you
[50:18] s of sin
[50:22] and the
[50:25] heavens praise of your glory
[50:29] [Music]
[50:32] Yeah.
[50:43] Heat.
[50:47] Yeah. Heat.
[50:52] [Music]
[51:04] Heat.
[51:05] [Music]
[51:13] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[51:15] [Music]
[51:29] In the name of Jesus.
[51:35] Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:38] Glory be to
[51:42] God. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[51:45] Lord. Blessed be your
[51:50] name. You know, I want to say this and I
[51:53] think it's so important to recognize it.
[51:55] I'm going to call it what it is.
[51:58] Some people might say this was a nation
[52:00] worshiping. This was a a race
[52:02] worshiping. This was a group of people
[52:04] from here or there. I want to say this.
[52:07] This is the redeemed worshiping.
[52:13] There ain't no skin color. There ain't
[52:15] no culture difference. It's the redeemed
[52:18] of God. Those that recognize what he did
[52:21] before the foundation of the world.
[52:24] That's what gives us the liberty to
[52:26] worship. Amen. And what an opportunity
[52:28] to gather together one more time in his
[52:31] name and have no reservation.
[52:34] Amen. You know, I'm sorry if it makes us
[52:36] uncomfortable here. This is the quietest
[52:39] place we're ever going to be. Because
[52:41] once the redeemed gets up in front of
[52:43] the throne and gives their worship, all
[52:46] heaven is going to be quiet to listen to
[52:48] that. Oh my. And the people, they go
[52:51] down. They're going to be the ones
[52:53] thinking I could have worshiped, but I
[52:55] just didn't want to for some reason.
[52:57] Maybe my traditions, maybe the pastor,
[53:00] maybe someone said that I
[53:03] shouldn't. I just want to encourage
[53:05] every single one of us. Don't think
[53:07] about anyone else but Jehovah,
[53:10] Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
[53:12] and forever. And what he's done, but not
[53:14] so much what he's done, not so much what
[53:16] he's going to do. What's he doing right
[53:18] now?
[53:18] [Music]
[53:20] every single need that we have in our
[53:22] lives, he is here and able to meet that
[53:25] need.
[53:28] My, isn't it wonderful? You want to push
[53:32] back the powers of darkness and and see
[53:34] devils flee and see afflictions leave
[53:36] and deliverance come, just worship.
[53:40] That's where the victory lies.
[53:43] Yeah.
[53:45] My I just can't help but get emotional
[53:47] in his presence. I'm so excited to to be
[53:51] here. God bless you all. Thank you for
[53:53] coming
[53:55] today. My It is
[53:58] tremendous tremendous to be in his
[54:00] presence.
[54:02] And I'm sorry. I just can't really get
[54:04] over that. I I I don't know if we ever
[54:06] will get over that, but we have to. I
[54:08] know we need to move forwards in the
[54:09] service here. And boy, oh boy.
[54:15] Okay. You know, it came to the place
[54:18] when they were dedicating the temple
[54:19] that the ministers couldn't even stand
[54:22] to minister because of the presence of
[54:23] God. I I just hope that everyone feels
[54:26] them the same way that I do
[54:29] today. My
[54:32] what a tremendous blessing it is to know
[54:34] that the King of Kings and Lord of Lords
[54:37] is right here in our midst.
[54:42] I I'm not trying to make this up and and
[54:44] and create an emotional stir. I just
[54:47] want to acknowledge him for who he is
[54:50] today.
[54:54] My you know some people take the quotes
[54:58] and and make different things out of
[55:00] them. Brother Brandham said the Holy
[55:01] Ghost is without sensation,
[55:04] but that's not without emotion.
[55:07] Let's not confuse the two.
[55:11] My Amen. Let's just bow in prayer.
[55:15] Heavenly Father, Lord, what an honor and
[55:17] a privilege it is one more time to think
[55:20] that you have given us, Lord, the
[55:22] ability to gather together in your name.
[55:25] Amen. Lord Jesus, not just as a
[55:27] figurative action, Lord, out of
[55:30] tradition and and duty, but Lord, out of
[55:33] a love and a passion that you've put in
[55:35] our hearts before the foundation of the
[55:37] world to come and meet with you, Lord
[55:40] Jesus, to give you praise and honor and
[55:43] glory. We know there was a time
[55:45] mentioned of in the Bible, oh Lord,
[55:48] where the the morning stars, they sang
[55:51] together and the sons of God, oh Father,
[55:54] they didn't whisper for joy, they
[55:56] shouted for joy. And there's something
[55:59] on the inside of the inside, Lord, that
[56:01] just desires to shout unto you, Father.
[56:04] We thank you for what you've done. We
[56:06] recognize that you're here, Lord. And we
[56:09] just want to give you the preeminence
[56:10] that you desire in this service, Lord
[56:13] Jesus. Amen. Father, we thank you for
[56:16] each life represented here, Lord. Some
[56:18] have come from far and some from wide,
[56:20] Lord Jesus. Father, we pray that you
[56:23] would just be glorified in all that's
[56:24] said and done
[56:26] today. Lord, we just ask that you would
[56:28] bless our service as we go forwards. We
[56:30] thank you for your goodness and your
[56:32] tender mercy to us even now this
[56:34] morning. Lord, the blessing that we've
[56:36] already received, we just commit this
[56:39] service into your hands now for your
[56:40] glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[56:44] Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning.
[56:47] I'm going to ask you to just take your
[56:48] seats if you don't mind. We have a baby
[56:51] dedication today.
[56:55] And uh it's brother
[56:58] Jel
[57:01] Odeno. Brother Jel Odoo. just a
[57:05] tremendous blessing to see the Lord
[57:08] ministering to his children and and
[57:10] giving us the ability to have families
[57:13] and to see the life coming through the
[57:16] body.
[57:17] And today we would just like to dedicate
[57:20] brother
[57:23] Jel and we have some names. I believe
[57:26] they are African names, Nigerian
[57:28] specifically and uh J Reel.
[57:34] Oh, wada
[57:36] miloju. I hope I pronounced that right.
[57:39] Olu
[57:41] watou and chukuima. Chuku a mika. I
[57:46] probably have not pronounced them right.
[57:48] And I I certainly apologize, but the
[57:52] words are big. And
[57:54] uh you know, it's difficult when you get
[57:57] up here and you get nervous. And
[58:00] I I I just feel that. But you know
[58:02] Jeriel the name is uh Hebrew
[58:06] origin and it relates to foundation or
[58:10] establishment and I think it's wonderful
[58:12] because we can say that this name was
[58:14] founded by God and God is my foundation.
[58:19] [Music]
[58:24] My an
[58:26] oluo Jew. The origin is Yoruba,
[58:30] southwestern Nigeria language. And the
[58:33] name is meaning I am assured in the
[58:36] Lord. Amen. I am confident in the Lord.
[58:41] I have unwavering trust in the Lord.
[58:46] Isn't that a wonderful name to name your
[58:48] child? To think that names have power.
[58:51] Names have very distinct influence over
[58:55] children.
[58:57] And this is the name of brother Jerryel.
[59:03] Tremendous. Just wonderful, wonderful
[59:06] names. And Chuco
[59:09] Mika, the origin is Igbu,
[59:12] Southoutheastern Nigeria language. And
[59:15] the name meaning is God has done great
[59:18] things.
[59:20] And all of these have scriptural
[59:22] references. I think they're just
[59:24] wonderful. But this morning, we would
[59:26] just like to invite the Odonovo family,
[59:30] brother Faren and Sister Merritt, if you
[59:33] would like to come up with your family
[59:35] and bring baby Jeriel up with you, we
[59:38] will dedicate him. If you want to play,
[59:41] bring them
[59:43] in. We'll just sing that song as they
[59:45] come forwards.
[59:49] Oh, bring them
[59:51] in. Bring them in.
[59:56] Break them in from the fields of s.
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:21] Jesus. You know, I
[1:00:24] uh my I just want to read a scripture
[1:00:27] here out of Mark chapter
[1:00:29] 10. And they brought young children to
[1:00:32] him that he should touch
[1:00:35] them. And his disciples rebuked those
[1:00:38] that brought them. And we know that
[1:00:41] that's the traditional teaching. Don't
[1:00:43] don't mess with things. Don't get out of
[1:00:45] order here. But when Jesus saw it, he
[1:00:49] was much displeased. And he said unto
[1:00:51] them, "Suffer the little children to
[1:00:52] come unto me, and forbid them not, for
[1:00:56] such is the kingdom of God. Verily, I
[1:00:58] say unto you, whosoever shall not
[1:01:00] receive the kingdom of God as a little
[1:01:03] child, he shall not enter
[1:01:05] therein." And he took them up in his
[1:01:08] arms, and put his hands upon them, and
[1:01:11] blessed them.
[1:01:13] And that's what we are going to do
[1:01:16] today. Certainly wonderful to have this
[1:01:21] honor. Hey
[1:01:24] buddy, brother
[1:01:26] Jerry, can you see
[1:01:29] him? God bless you,
[1:01:32] buddy. Yeah, it's okay if you're yawning
[1:01:34] in
[1:01:36] church. You're allowed
[1:01:38] to. Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:01:42] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[1:01:44] one more time. What an honor and a
[1:01:47] privilege it is to hold one of your
[1:01:50] elect.
[1:01:51] Father, this morning, Lord Jesus, we
[1:01:54] want to thank you for this life of
[1:01:56] brother Jeriel, Lord Odono. Father, we
[1:02:00] thank you for the Odinoo family, Lord
[1:02:02] Jesus, brother Farah, Sister Merritt,
[1:02:05] Sister Zoe, and Brother Jason, Lord. And
[1:02:08] this morning, Father, we just want to
[1:02:09] take this life that you have given unto
[1:02:12] this family, Lord, and dedicate it back
[1:02:15] unto you, Father. Lord Jesus, we know
[1:02:18] that all life comes from you. And what
[1:02:20] greater honor and privilege is it as
[1:02:23] parents, Lord Jesus, to acknowledge you
[1:02:25] as the giver of all life. And Father, to
[1:02:28] be able to take that life that you have
[1:02:30] given us and dedicate it back unto you.
[1:02:33] So father this morning even as a body of
[1:02:36] believers here in Calgary we unite
[1:02:38] together around this family Lord around
[1:02:41] the Odonovos and we just ask Lord Jesus
[1:02:43] in the name of Jesus that you would
[1:02:46] watch over this boy for the duration of
[1:02:48] his life father as we've read about and
[1:02:50] heard about so many times Lord there's
[1:02:52] so many different things that we could
[1:02:54] ask for but Father this morning we unite
[1:02:56] together and we ask for the salvation of
[1:02:59] this boy we just pray that Lord Jesus
[1:03:02] you would guide his footsteps all the
[1:03:04] days of his life. That you would lead
[1:03:06] him and guide him into all
[1:03:08] righteousness, Lord. That his desire
[1:03:10] would be unto you first and foremost,
[1:03:12] Lord. And oh, Father, that all of the
[1:03:15] other gifts would follow, Lord Jesus.
[1:03:17] Father, we pray that you would allow him
[1:03:19] to be an inspiration of joy to his
[1:03:21] family, Lord Jesus, that he would be an
[1:03:23] inspiration of the foundation of your
[1:03:26] love and your gospel to all the people
[1:03:28] around him, Lord, because he knows what
[1:03:30] you've done for him. Father, we pray
[1:03:32] that you would just keep sickness away,
[1:03:35] Lord. And Father, let him just
[1:03:37] experience the joy of your
[1:03:40] salvation. Father, we love you and we
[1:03:42] thank you and we just want to commit
[1:03:43] this boy into your hands now for your
[1:03:45] glory. As we dedicate him in the name of
[1:03:48] Jesus Christ, we'd ask Lord also that
[1:03:50] you would watch over the family in every
[1:03:53] aspect. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:03:56] Amen.
[1:03:57] Amen. Amen. God bless you, buddy. You
[1:04:01] feel that presence, don't you? It's not
[1:04:03] brother Barry. Oh
[1:04:05] my.
[1:04:07] Hallelujah. God bless you, brother.
[1:04:11] Congratulations. Bless you,
[1:04:13] sister. Bless you, sister. Oh, bring
[1:04:17] them
[1:04:18] in. Bring them
[1:04:22] in.
[1:04:24] Bring them in from the fields of sin.
[1:04:30] Bring them
[1:04:33] in. Bring them
[1:04:37] in. Bring the little to
[1:04:44] Jesus. Amen.
[1:04:47] Wow. I believe we could just go home now
[1:04:50] and just be blessed from what we've
[1:04:52] experienced.
[1:04:54] Maybe stand with me as
[1:04:56] we begin the service. Now, let's uh
[1:04:59] let's turn to Revelations chapter 13.
[1:05:01] Thank you,
[1:05:05] musicians. Revelations chapter 13. I'd
[1:05:07] like to continue on our thought. Amen.
[1:05:10] Hallelujah.
[1:05:15] About the end of days.
[1:05:20] And maybe pick up a little bit from
[1:05:22] where we left off last Sunday.
[1:05:25] Revelations chapter 13 verse
[1:05:30] 1. And I stood upon the sand of the sea,
[1:05:33] and I saw a beast rise up out of the
[1:05:37] sea, having seven heads and 10
[1:05:41] horns, and upon his horns 10
[1:05:44] crowns, and upon his heads the name of
[1:05:49] blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was
[1:05:53] like unto a leopard, and his feet were
[1:05:55] as the feet of a
[1:05:57] bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a
[1:06:01] lion. And the dragon gave him his power,
[1:06:04] and his seat, and great
[1:06:07] authority. And I saw one of his heads as
[1:06:10] it were wounded to death.
[1:06:17] My and his deadly wound was
[1:06:20] healed. And all the world
[1:06:24] wondered after the
[1:06:27] beast. And they worshiped the dragon
[1:06:29] which gave power unto the beast. And
[1:06:32] they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is
[1:06:35] like unto the
[1:06:37] beast? Who is able to make war with him?
[1:06:41] And there was given unto him a mouth
[1:06:45] speaking great things and
[1:06:47] blasphemies and power was given unto him
[1:06:51] to continue 40 and two
[1:06:54] months. And he opened his mouth in
[1:06:57] blasphemy against God to blaspheme his
[1:07:00] name and his tabernacle and them that
[1:07:05] dwell in heaven. Let's just bow one more
[1:07:09] time. Amen.
[1:07:10] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[1:07:12] word. Thank you, Lord, for the scripture
[1:07:15] that we've read. And Lord Jesus, we just
[1:07:17] invite you now to break it open to us
[1:07:20] fresh once again, Lord. Father, we pray
[1:07:23] that you would just, Lord, allow the
[1:07:25] words that you want spoken and stop the
[1:07:27] words that you don't. And Father, in the
[1:07:30] end, we'll be careful to give you all
[1:07:31] the praise. We thank you, Father, for
[1:07:33] your presence here today. Lord, thank
[1:07:35] you for each soul represented here.
[1:07:37] Lord, help us to recognize, Father, that
[1:07:40] we have opportunity, Lord Jesus, to make
[1:07:43] room for you in our lives. Our desire is
[1:07:46] to bring you glory. Father, we just ask
[1:07:49] now that you would bless our service,
[1:07:50] Father. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:07:52] Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning.
[1:07:55] You may be seated. Thank you everyone
[1:07:58] for coming
[1:08:00] today. Certainly thankful for the
[1:08:03] presence of the Lord. you know, talking
[1:08:06] about the uh the baby
[1:08:08] dedications, I think it's a wonderful
[1:08:10] thing that we can recognize
[1:08:13] um that we do it and it's wonderful to
[1:08:15] give back. And you know, sometimes I
[1:08:18] think it helps if we just hear maybe
[1:08:20] what brother Bradom said about it. And
[1:08:22] out of 1957, brother Brandham in God
[1:08:25] keeps his word and
[1:08:29] uh I do apologize to the sound
[1:08:32] technicians. I may have had a technical
[1:08:34] issue this morning, so they might not
[1:08:35] have the quotes that I've got, but if
[1:08:37] you just uh bear with us, I'm sure it'll
[1:08:39] all be fine. He says, "Now, I want
[1:08:42] Sister Gertie, if she will, before we
[1:08:45] bring the little ones up for a baby
[1:08:46] dedication." In the Bible, we find out
[1:08:50] the only place that I know of in the
[1:08:52] scripture where the order of babies.
[1:08:56] Now, a lot of people sprinkle them and,
[1:08:58] you know, and call it baptism and so
[1:09:01] forth, which that's okay, but I always
[1:09:04] just try to
[1:09:06] like to stay just the way the Bible says
[1:09:10] it. And you know, in the Bible, they
[1:09:13] never baptized little children. Neither
[1:09:16] did they sprinkle them. They just
[1:09:18] brought them to our Lord. And he took
[1:09:21] them in his arms and blessed them and
[1:09:23] said, "Suffer the little children to
[1:09:25] come unto me and forbid them not, for
[1:09:28] such is the kingdom of heaven." Isn't
[1:09:30] that wonderful?
[1:09:32] And I know that there's a lot of people
[1:09:34] even in denominational churches that
[1:09:36] will do exactly what we just
[1:09:38] did. Exactly. And we have the prophet
[1:09:42] saying that such is the kingdom of
[1:09:43] heaven. That's beautiful. And the
[1:09:45] strange thing was now that I just turned
[1:09:48] right down in the Bible just exactly
[1:09:50] where it's at in Mark 10 just here it is
[1:09:52] right before me. And so the Lord brought
[1:09:55] the little children and they brought the
[1:09:56] little children to him and he just
[1:09:58] blessed them and said suffer the little
[1:10:00] ones to come to me and don't forbid them
[1:10:03] for such is the kingdom. Now we know
[1:10:06] that our Lord has gone to glory and his
[1:10:08] spirit returned back in the church to
[1:10:10] carry on the message until he comes
[1:10:12] again. We're looking for that. And the
[1:10:15] way we do it here is just to bring the
[1:10:17] little ones up and we bring the elders
[1:10:19] of the church up and I take the little
[1:10:21] ones and dedicate them to the Lord. I
[1:10:23] think it's such a sweet little service
[1:10:26] to see those little bitty
[1:10:28] fellows because it's no matter how young
[1:10:31] we are or how old we are, one of those
[1:10:35] little ones has just got a place in our
[1:10:38] heart. Isn't that right? Amen.
[1:10:42] How many pray for one another's kids
[1:10:44] here today?
[1:10:46] You know, if there's anything that we
[1:10:48] not only could pray for, but need to
[1:10:50] pray for is for the little ones in the
[1:10:53] congregation. Amen. Because a lot of the
[1:10:56] elders understand what it means to be a
[1:10:58] battlecard veteran. They understand what
[1:11:01] it means to be knocked around and kicked
[1:11:03] down and to shake it all off and get
[1:11:06] back up and go to church again. But a
[1:11:08] lot of times the little ones, the young
[1:11:11] ones spiritually and physically, they
[1:11:14] don't understand that. They feel like
[1:11:16] they've completely failed God and they
[1:11:18] can never succeed and never make it. So
[1:11:20] why bother? Why not be just like the
[1:11:22] world? Eat and drink and be merry for
[1:11:25] tomorrow we just die anyway. We're not
[1:11:26] going to be able to make it. We can't do
[1:11:28] this. And it's 100% right. We say it all
[1:11:31] the time. There's no way that we can do
[1:11:32] this. It takes Jesus Christ to do this
[1:11:35] in our lives. He is the reason we get
[1:11:37] back up and we dust ourselves off and we
[1:11:40] come to church.
[1:11:43] But if you if you ever run out of things
[1:11:45] to pray for, just think about the little
[1:11:48] children.
[1:11:49] Now, when we come to God, that's just
[1:11:51] the way we are in God's heart. We never
[1:11:54] leave that stage. We are always little
[1:11:56] children. Amen. Isn't that wonderful?
[1:12:00] We're children of the King. I'm a child
[1:12:03] of the King. We sing that song. Oh yes.
[1:12:05] Oh yes, I'm a child of the king. His
[1:12:07] royal blood now it flows through my
[1:12:10] veins.
[1:12:12] I you who were wretched. My now we can
[1:12:17] sing. And we have the ability here. It's
[1:12:19] so beautiful. We have the ability here,
[1:12:21] brothers and sisters, to sing just as
[1:12:23] loud as we want. Amen. To just give him
[1:12:25] all the glory and honor and praise that
[1:12:28] we want to. We can go to a hockey game
[1:12:30] and people aren't afraid to jump up and
[1:12:32] shout, right? people aren't afraid to
[1:12:35] get in the spirit of things in this
[1:12:37] world. How much more ought the children
[1:12:39] of the king to get in the spirit of
[1:12:41] things. I I just think it's wonderful.
[1:12:43] And you know, I'm I'm I was in the back
[1:12:45] and I was just so happy to see the way
[1:12:47] the the song service went today. And
[1:12:50] some people might get upset by it, but
[1:12:52] you know, I I I just think that the
[1:12:54] further we go down the road, the more we
[1:12:56] recognize what he's done for us, the
[1:12:57] more we recognize how little there is
[1:12:59] that we could ever do to to get
[1:13:00] ourselves there, how much more we're
[1:13:03] going to worship him and give him praise
[1:13:04] and honor and glory. And we've said it
[1:13:06] in the past, you know, when we get to
[1:13:08] heaven, we're probably not going to be
[1:13:09] reading quotes and we're probably not
[1:13:11] going to be reading the Bible and
[1:13:12] studying and having prayer meetings and
[1:13:13] going through all of that. We're going
[1:13:14] to be praising the Lord because we know
[1:13:17] that we made it. Amen. And isn't it
[1:13:19] wonderful to think that he's given us a
[1:13:20] thousand year space?
[1:13:23] Thousand years
[1:13:26] to get all of our emotions out of the
[1:13:29] way. And then he says,
[1:13:32] "Behold, all old things are passed away.
[1:13:35] Behold, all things are new. And there's
[1:13:37] a new Jerusalem city that comes down for
[1:13:39] us to inhabit." And it's going to be a
[1:13:41] totally different thing than what we're
[1:13:43] used to. I just think it's amazing.
[1:13:45] Amen. And you know, when we prayed this
[1:13:48] morning, I I just want to say our prayer
[1:13:49] has been answered. I asked the Lord with
[1:13:52] the musicians this morning that that
[1:13:53] heaven and earth would just embrace. And
[1:13:56] you know, if you're wondering why it
[1:13:58] seemed maybe a little bit different, I
[1:13:59] don't know. Maybe the Lord just allowed
[1:14:01] that to happen. Heaven and earth just
[1:14:03] embraced. And I want to say right now,
[1:14:05] brothers and sisters, he hasn't let go.
[1:14:08] He's still embracing right now. He's
[1:14:10] right here, right now, offering to
[1:14:12] deliver whatever it is that we have need
[1:14:14] of. if we're willing to just surrender
[1:14:16] unto him.
[1:14:19] I just love that that special this
[1:14:21] morning. God bless you, brother
[1:14:23] Faren. My I just love that. It's
[1:14:26] beautiful. You know, I I just have a
[1:14:28] couple of announcements that I need to
[1:14:29] make and uh I I think unfortunately we
[1:14:32] have them and and it just has to be. We
[1:14:36] uh we want to remember Sister Rebecca
[1:14:40] uh Sister Rebecca moving back to
[1:14:42] Nigeria.
[1:14:45] Oh my sister Rebecca Odolene who's
[1:14:47] moving back to Nigeria and uh she's
[1:14:49] going to be married. She is betrothed
[1:14:51] right now and uh the Lord is certainly
[1:14:53] good. We've prayed for that to happen
[1:14:55] and we're praying for a safe delivery
[1:14:59] and uh that the Lord will just bless
[1:15:02] their marriage abundantly. And uh I
[1:15:04] asked when we had the conversation
[1:15:06] originally when she plans to come back
[1:15:08] and she said I don't
[1:15:10] know. So, you know, we just trust the
[1:15:13] Lord that he's working it all out for
[1:15:15] his glory. And, uh, we just want to see
[1:15:16] the Lord's blessings in her life and
[1:15:19] wish her the very, very best. And, uh,
[1:15:21] it's going to go quickly. She's, I
[1:15:23] think, uh, probably about a week longer
[1:15:25] here at Calgary Living Word and then
[1:15:27] she's going to go and start making
[1:15:29] preparations for her wedding and and
[1:15:31] then who knows when we'll see her again.
[1:15:33] So, don't be bashful. Please reach out
[1:15:35] to her and uh, wish her all the best.
[1:15:39] We have another uh announcement to make.
[1:15:42] And uh it's with a heavy heart, but with
[1:15:46] a a smiley face, a uh uh it's it's good
[1:15:50] because we follow the leadership of the
[1:15:52] Lord. I got a phone call this week from
[1:15:54] brother Justice Oli and uh he wanted to
[1:15:58] announce that the Lord has finally given
[1:16:00] him a date and that is that he and his
[1:16:02] family are moving back to
[1:16:04] Nigeria. And
[1:16:08] uh yeah, they're not going to visit,
[1:16:10] they're going to live. And I asked
[1:16:12] Brother Justice, is it okay if I
[1:16:14] announce it? And I think it's very
[1:16:16] important to make sure that we are on
[1:16:18] the same page with this.
[1:16:20] Um, you know, we have to go where the
[1:16:23] Lord leads us. And, uh, Brother Justice
[1:16:26] and Sister Sharon Rose feel led to go.
[1:16:28] And, uh, I believe there's going to be,
[1:16:30] um, employment there. And the Lord's
[1:16:33] just been working on this for a long
[1:16:35] time. And, you know, I just want to say,
[1:16:36] uh, kudos to Brother Justice publicly.
[1:16:40] To me, it means a lot because just about
[1:16:44] two years ago, maybe a year and a half,
[1:16:46] brother justice had another conversation
[1:16:48] with me and he said to me, "We're
[1:16:50] feeling led to do this. The Lord is is
[1:16:53] leading us this way." And I just would
[1:16:54] like you to know that. We don't have any
[1:16:56] details worked out, but you know, for me
[1:16:58] in a in a role of a pastor, it means so
[1:17:01] much to know that someone would would
[1:17:03] take the time to say the Lord is
[1:17:05] actually leading this way. You know,
[1:17:07] when the Lord is doing that, we can pray
[1:17:09] together and and ask the Lord for his
[1:17:11] will to happen and and here we see the
[1:17:14] doors opening and he's just making a way
[1:17:16] for it. It's it's tremendous. So, I I
[1:17:18] kind of knew maybe what would be coming.
[1:17:21] I just didn't know how quickly it would
[1:17:22] be coming. And so, uh I believe as I
[1:17:25] understand the 1 of September, the
[1:17:27] Elagis are going to be in Nigeria. So,
[1:17:31] the end of August they're going to be
[1:17:33] leaving. So, we're going to make sure
[1:17:35] that we celebrate them. We appreciate
[1:17:37] them and uh we're certainly thankful for
[1:17:40] what they've contributed to the body
[1:17:42] here. They've been a wonderful wonderful
[1:17:44] addition and uh just a real
[1:17:46] encouragement. I've been able to spend a
[1:17:49] little time with brother Justice and uh
[1:17:51] you know in in him working he worked
[1:17:53] with us in our business a little bit and
[1:17:55] I think more than anything he wanted
[1:17:57] some fellowship and uh it was just a
[1:17:59] wonderful time to get to know him a bit
[1:18:01] you know and uh we're going to miss
[1:18:04] them.
[1:18:05] We miss one another on this side when we
[1:18:08] have to part. But we know there's coming
[1:18:09] a day
[1:18:11] where that will never
[1:18:13] happen. Where we'll always be together.
[1:18:16] We won't have to part. Are you happy
[1:18:18] this morning?
[1:18:22] I am certainly happy. I know that it was
[1:18:24] a bit of a fight to get here today to to
[1:18:28] get through all of the stuff that we
[1:18:30] needed to this week so that we could,
[1:18:32] you know, be in our position, but
[1:18:33] there's a blessing in store. I am
[1:18:36] sure. We just also wanted to mention
[1:18:38] that uh please don't forget there's a
[1:18:41] potluck this afternoon and uh it's at
[1:18:44] our place after service. Um if the
[1:18:47] preacher doesn't go too long, we'd like
[1:18:49] to aim for eating about 2:00 and uh so
[1:18:53] if you plan to come, please feel welcome
[1:18:55] to and if you need an address after
[1:18:57] service, we can certainly get that for
[1:18:58] you.
[1:19:00] Um but anyways, here we go.
[1:19:04] I think it's so wonderful to know that
[1:19:06] we have been given the revelation that
[1:19:08] we have in the day in which we live.
[1:19:10] Sometimes we can look at this message of
[1:19:12] the hour and and and maybe not by any
[1:19:16] fault of our own begin to make it
[1:19:18] something other than it is. It can
[1:19:20] become a a list of dos and don'ts. It
[1:19:22] can become a legalistic perspective. It
[1:19:25] can be creeds or dogmas. And and we know
[1:19:29] we've seen all manner of that. But to
[1:19:31] come to the place where it is truly the
[1:19:33] glorious liberty of the word of God in
[1:19:36] our lives, we really don't need to be
[1:19:39] told what to do. We are certainly able
[1:19:43] to allow the Holy Ghost in our lives to
[1:19:46] minister the truth to us as we
[1:19:49] go. And you know, as we as we look at
[1:19:51] this word and and the message of the
[1:19:53] hour, we we can see these things that
[1:19:56] we've talked about. You know, we've been
[1:19:58] preaching out of uh Matthew chapter 24
[1:20:00] and we know that that is the the end of
[1:20:04] days and and the disciples had Jesus and
[1:20:07] and they said to him, you know what what
[1:20:09] they asked him one question in three
[1:20:12] parts. What what is the sign of the end?
[1:20:16] And and what's it going to look
[1:20:18] like? And uh we know that Jesus, he
[1:20:21] began to give them an answer. And I
[1:20:23] don't know if they were ready fully
[1:20:25] ready for the answer that he gave. But
[1:20:27] when we look at these scriptures, we we
[1:20:29] can look at them and and I guess the
[1:20:31] point that I really feel led to talk
[1:20:34] about is we don't have to be afraid of
[1:20:36] the end of days. We don't have to be
[1:20:39] afraid to see um a government elected, a
[1:20:42] government fall. We don't have to be
[1:20:45] afraid of the beast. We don't have to be
[1:20:48] afraid of the dragon. We don't have to
[1:20:51] be afraid of the false prophet. We don't
[1:20:53] have to be afraid of false prophets. We
[1:20:56] don't have to be afraid of ministries,
[1:20:58] per se. We don't have to be afraid.
[1:21:01] There should be no fear because perfect
[1:21:03] love casts out fear.
[1:21:06] Perfect love takes out fear. There's no
[1:21:08] need to be afraid or worried or
[1:21:10] concerned when we know who is in charge.
[1:21:15] But in our scripture today, I just want
[1:21:18] to carry on a little bit. in verse 7 of
[1:21:21] Revelations chapter
[1:21:23] 13 talking about this one who opened his
[1:21:27] mouth in blasphemy against God. Isn't it
[1:21:29] a a tremendous thing to think about who
[1:21:31] who this could be that verse six he says
[1:21:34] he opened his mouth in blasphemy against
[1:21:36] God calling things that are as though
[1:21:39] they're not right saying that it's not
[1:21:41] God and and to blaspheme his name the
[1:21:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ to to say
[1:21:48] that it's not the Lord Jesus Christ to
[1:21:50] say that it's a devil to blasphe his
[1:21:52] name and his tabernacle where's his
[1:21:56] tabernacle
[1:21:58] Many times we can think about it and
[1:22:00] say, "Well, that tabernacle, it's in
[1:22:02] heaven." And sure enough, there was a
[1:22:04] time where the prophets saw the vision
[1:22:06] in heaven where the temple post, they
[1:22:09] shook at the presence of the Lord,
[1:22:11] right? But we're not talking about that
[1:22:13] tabernacle. I don't believe that this is
[1:22:15] the tabernacle that really he's speaking
[1:22:17] of here because we know that he doesn't
[1:22:20] live in a house made with hands. He
[1:22:23] lives in a fleshy heart of a man. That
[1:22:26] is his tabernacle, the body of the bride
[1:22:29] of Jesus Christ. But this man, he opened
[1:22:32] his mouth in blasphemy against God, to
[1:22:34] blaspheme his name and his
[1:22:37] tabernacle and them that dwell in
[1:22:41] heaven. Can you imagine that? What good
[1:22:43] is it going to do to talk about those
[1:22:45] people in heaven, to blaspheme them?
[1:22:46] They're already there. That's right.
[1:22:49] This guy has some audacity, though.
[1:22:52] And verse 7, and it was given unto him
[1:22:54] to make war with the saints, and to
[1:22:56] overcome them, and power was given him
[1:23:00] over all kindreds and tongues and
[1:23:04] nations. We know this is right out of
[1:23:06] Daniel 7. And all that dwell upon the
[1:23:10] earth shall worship him whose names are
[1:23:14] not written in the book of life of the
[1:23:17] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:23:20] world.
[1:23:23] If any man have an ear, let him hear.
[1:23:27] Anybody here have an ear today?
[1:23:30] If we have his spirit, we have an ear.
[1:23:34] And without his spirit, we can say we
[1:23:36] have an ear and we can hear it with our
[1:23:38] ears naturally speaking. But that's not
[1:23:40] the ear that he's talking about. He's
[1:23:42] talking about the ear that's here. This
[1:23:44] here ear. It's right inside the heart,
[1:23:47] right in the soul of the brothers and
[1:23:49] sisters, his children. And as we read
[1:23:51] these things, we can see that all that
[1:23:53] dwell upon the earth shall worship him
[1:23:55] whose names are not written in the book
[1:23:56] of life of the lamb slain before the
[1:23:58] foundation of the world. Who are those
[1:23:59] people that will worship him? The ones
[1:24:01] that reject the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:03] Ghost. This is why we preach about the
[1:24:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Brothers and
[1:24:07] sisters, outside of that baptism of the
[1:24:09] Holy Ghost, you're going to worship this
[1:24:11] guy that's blaspheming heaven, that's
[1:24:14] blaspheming the saints, that's
[1:24:15] blaspheming the tabernacle, that's
[1:24:17] blaspheming the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:19] Christ. You will do that. You will
[1:24:22] worship him because it's the word of
[1:24:24] God. Some people might say, "Well,
[1:24:26] Brother Barry, I can control what I want
[1:24:28] to do." Sure enough, we can. But, you
[1:24:30] know, we don't have to actually go out
[1:24:32] into the world and join up with the
[1:24:34] denominations. I'm so thankful I had a
[1:24:36] pastor that taught me that you can be a
[1:24:38] denomination of one
[1:24:42] just by saying I I I don't believe it
[1:24:44] that way. I'm just going to do it this
[1:24:45] way. I'm just going to do it my way. I'm
[1:24:47] just going to make it the way that I
[1:24:49] want it that suits my life. You know
[1:24:51] what happens is you're actually
[1:24:53] rejecting the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:54] Why would you say that, brother Barry?
[1:24:56] Because the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:24:58] the Holy Ghost himself will never reject
[1:25:00] one word of the word.
[1:25:04] If someone has the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:06] Ghost, they will come in line 100% with
[1:25:09] the words of the vindicated prophet.
[1:25:14] They're and and they're not going to
[1:25:16] comb their hair the way that he combs
[1:25:17] his hair. They're not going to drive a
[1:25:19] Ford because he drove a Ford. We're not
[1:25:22] going to go out and get a belt buckle
[1:25:24] because he had a belt buckle. Brothers
[1:25:26] and sisters, we're not talking about
[1:25:28] that. We're talking about thus sayaith
[1:25:29] the Lord.
[1:25:31] Thus saith the Lord. There's a lot of
[1:25:33] things that he said that that that he
[1:25:35] maybe predicted and he said and and I
[1:25:38] think and I I I perceive and many
[1:25:40] different ways of saying it, but it's
[1:25:42] thus sayaith the Lord that we go after,
[1:25:44] right? That is our absolute.
[1:25:48] It has to be. There has to be an
[1:25:50] absolute.
[1:25:52] But we can look at all these things and
[1:25:53] we don't have to be afraid. Let's turn
[1:25:55] over to Matthew chapter 24 just for a
[1:25:59] moment as we begin.
[1:26:03] Matthew 24. Let's just read the the
[1:26:05] first few verses
[1:26:09] here. Matthew chap 24 verse
[1:26:16] 1. And Jesus went out and departed from
[1:26:20] the
[1:26:21] temple. And his disciples came to him
[1:26:25] for to show him the buildings of the
[1:26:27] temple. And Jesus said unto them, "See
[1:26:29] ye not all these things. Verily I say
[1:26:32] unto you, there shall not be not be left
[1:26:35] here one stone upon another that shall
[1:26:39] not be thrown
[1:26:41] down." And as he sat upon the Mount of
[1:26:44] Olives, the disciples came unto him
[1:26:47] privately, saying, "Tell us, when shall
[1:26:49] these things be, and what shall be the
[1:26:52] sign of thy coming and the end of the
[1:26:55] world?"
[1:26:56] And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:26:58] "Take heed that no man deceive you." We
[1:27:00] talked about that the last couple times.
[1:27:02] Take heed that no man deceive you. How
[1:27:04] will we be able to make sure that no man
[1:27:05] deceives us? By simply having the Holy
[1:27:08] Ghost in our lives. We can know the word
[1:27:10] of God, but remember the letter kleth,
[1:27:14] right? But the spirit giveth life.
[1:27:18] For many shall come in my name, saying,
[1:27:20] I am Christ and shall deceive many. And
[1:27:24] ye shall hear of wars and rumors of
[1:27:26] wars. And you know, right in the middle
[1:27:28] of this verse, I think is so good. This
[1:27:30] is where I want to I want to get to,
[1:27:31] brothers and sisters. See that ye be not
[1:27:34] troubled.
[1:27:36] See that you be not troubled. Don't be
[1:27:37] shaken. Don't get nervous. Don't worry.
[1:27:41] He has this all under his control.
[1:27:45] See that you be not troubled. For all
[1:27:47] these things must come to pass, but the
[1:27:49] end is not yet. Amen. So even though we
[1:27:53] see that happening, keep hoing your
[1:27:55] potatoes.
[1:27:56] Amen. That means the plant is already
[1:27:58] growing. It's already been happening in
[1:28:01] the garden and you know that as the
[1:28:03] plant grows, it actually needs to be
[1:28:06] healed. And that's what brother Brandham
[1:28:07] was talking about. There's already
[1:28:09] something happening. You're already busy
[1:28:10] doing something. You're putting hand
[1:28:12] towards something. Just do it with all
[1:28:14] of your might. And if you look at the
[1:28:16] book of Ecclesiastes, that's what it
[1:28:17] says in there. What you put your hand
[1:28:19] to, do it with all your might.
[1:28:21] Just keep going. Don't be troubled.
[1:28:23] Don't worry. Ho your potatoes like he's
[1:28:26] coming in a hundred years from now. My
[1:28:29] goodness. But live like he's coming
[1:28:31] tomorrow.
[1:28:33] Don't be bashful to tell people about
[1:28:35] this this gospel that we we know that we
[1:28:38] hold so dear to us. See that you be not
[1:28:40] troubled, for all these things must come
[1:28:41] to
[1:28:42] pass, but the end is not yet.
[1:28:46] For nation shall rise against nation,
[1:28:48] kingdom against kingdom. And there shall
[1:28:50] be famines and pestilence and
[1:28:51] earthquakes in diverse places. All these
[1:28:55] are the beginning of
[1:28:56] sorrows. All of these are the beginning
[1:28:59] of sorrows. And you
[1:29:02] know my they shall deliver you up to be
[1:29:05] afflicted and shall kill you. And ye
[1:29:08] shall be hated of all nations for my
[1:29:11] name's sake. And then shall many be
[1:29:13] offended and shall betray one another
[1:29:14] and shall hate one
[1:29:17] another. And many false prophets shall
[1:29:20] rise and shall deceive many. And because
[1:29:23] of
[1:29:24] iniquity because iniquity shall abound,
[1:29:26] the love of many shall wax cold. But he
[1:29:28] that shall endure to the end, the same
[1:29:31] shall be saved. And this gospel of the
[1:29:33] kingdom shall be preached into all the
[1:29:36] world for a witness unto all
[1:29:38] nations. And then the end shall come.
[1:29:42] And you know, we we've said it before
[1:29:44] and I believe it with all my heart. With
[1:29:46] the way technology is these days and the
[1:29:48] efforts that people have put forward, it
[1:29:51] isn't really a big stretch of the
[1:29:53] imagination to be able to say that this
[1:29:56] scripture has already been fulfilled.
[1:29:59] This day, this scripture is fulfilled.
[1:30:02] This gospel of the kingdom shall be
[1:30:04] preached in all the world for a witness
[1:30:08] unto all nations. Amen. And then the end
[1:30:11] shall come. But to think, brothers and
[1:30:13] sisters, God who is rich in mercy, Amen.
[1:30:17] One more time has called us to come and
[1:30:21] dine. One more time to fellowship around
[1:30:24] these things. Amen. Hallelujah. What a
[1:30:27] tremendous thing it is. We know these
[1:30:29] things and we don't need to be afraid.
[1:30:32] But I just wanted to make sure that we
[1:30:34] talked about this. Matthew 24, the
[1:30:36] middle part of verse 6. See that you be
[1:30:38] not troubled. As we look around and we
[1:30:40] see these things, don't worry about it.
[1:30:42] Don't think for a second that there's
[1:30:44] coming a time where you're suddenly
[1:30:45] going to have the mark of the beast and
[1:30:47] you're just going to get caught off
[1:30:48] guard and suddenly you're going to be
[1:30:50] worshiping this one who calls himself
[1:30:52] God and sets as God in the temple of
[1:30:55] God. You're not going to be worshiping
[1:30:56] that guy if you get the Holy Ghost. But
[1:30:58] if you choose not to get the Holy
[1:31:00] Ghost, you might. Right? So, we just
[1:31:04] need to make sure that we're preaching
[1:31:05] the truth in season. brothers and
[1:31:07] sisters. And I think for for for the
[1:31:09] realization to know how close we must be
[1:31:12] to the very end. What else is there to
[1:31:14] preach? We can talk about the different
[1:31:16] things. And sure enough, we have
[1:31:17] teaching. But you know, there's nothing
[1:31:19] else more important to us than to know
[1:31:22] that we have the Holy Ghost, that we
[1:31:24] have the seal of God in our lives, that
[1:31:26] we're actually teaching our children
[1:31:28] that they need to have the Holy Ghost in
[1:31:30] their life. And that the children might
[1:31:33] not the children might not even see it
[1:31:35] in the parents. They might look at the
[1:31:36] parents and say, "You got a temper like
[1:31:38] a buzzsaw. How could you have the Holy
[1:31:40] Ghost?"
[1:31:42] You know, we all are human.
[1:31:45] We all have weaknesses. We all have
[1:31:48] strengths. And the devil knows them. And
[1:31:51] he's going to try and manipulate them to
[1:31:53] try and throw people off. And more than
[1:31:55] anything, he wants to try and throw us
[1:31:57] off. I want to say this today. Have you
[1:31:59] ever got to the place where you're so
[1:32:02] disgusted with yourself, you don't even
[1:32:03] want to look at yourself in the mirror?
[1:32:05] Anybody ever been there?
[1:32:09] The devil knows how to do that to us.
[1:32:13] But isn't it wonderful that the spirit
[1:32:14] of God comes around and
[1:32:16] says, "Get up." Amen. You're a son of
[1:32:20] God.
[1:32:22] That's the devil that does that to us,
[1:32:24] brothers and sisters. And we don't have
[1:32:26] to stay down. What that is is a giant
[1:32:29] down in the valley boasting, blaspheming
[1:32:32] the tabernacle of God and his
[1:32:35] name. I think it's so important to see
[1:32:37] that how the rubber meets the road in
[1:32:39] the day in which we live. When we can
[1:32:41] see the devil coming around and trying
[1:32:43] to mess with us, we can push him back.
[1:32:45] We don't have to tolerate him. Amen.
[1:32:47] Coming into our our lives and trying to
[1:32:50] mess things up everywhere we go,
[1:32:52] everywhere we look.
[1:32:54] You know, in our scripture today out of
[1:32:56] Matthew chapter 13, I wanted to talk
[1:32:58] about the uh the the relevance, the
[1:33:01] significance of Revelations chapter 13.
[1:33:03] I've said it a few times in the past
[1:33:05] when I was preaching, saying that
[1:33:06] Revelation 13 is unfolding before our
[1:33:08] eyes. And I I believe it with all my
[1:33:10] heart. Truly, it is. And you know, if uh
[1:33:14] if we just go back to Revelations
[1:33:16] chapter
[1:33:17] 13, I just want to read this here. the
[1:33:21] the first couple verses it says
[1:33:23] Revelation 13:1 and I stood upon the
[1:33:26] sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up
[1:33:28] out of the sea having seven heads and 10
[1:33:33] horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and
[1:33:36] upon the
[1:33:38] heads the
[1:33:40] name of
[1:33:43] blasphemy. So, we know that this one
[1:33:45] here is the same one that's in verse
[1:33:47] six, who opens his mouth and blasphemy
[1:33:49] against God, blaspheme his name and his
[1:33:51] tabernacle and them that dwell in
[1:33:53] heaven. But it's interesting to see that
[1:33:56] this one, he rose up out of the
[1:33:59] sea. This one rose up out of the sea. If
[1:34:02] you were to just go back a little bit to
[1:34:03] Revelations
[1:34:05] 12, it's kind of an interesting
[1:34:07] comparison.
[1:34:12] Revelations 12:1 says, "And there
[1:34:15] appeared a great wonder in heaven, a
[1:34:17] woman clothed in the sun and the moon
[1:34:20] under her feet, and upon her head a
[1:34:22] crown of 12
[1:34:24] stars. And she being with child cried
[1:34:28] travailing in birth, and pained to be
[1:34:32] delivered. And there appeared another
[1:34:34] wonder in heaven. And behold, a great
[1:34:38] red
[1:34:40] dragon having
[1:34:42] what? Having seven heads and 10
[1:34:46] horns and seven crowns upon his heads.
[1:34:52] And his tail drew the third part of the
[1:34:53] stars of heaven, and did cast them to
[1:34:55] the earth. And the dragon stood before
[1:34:57] the woman, which was ready to de to be
[1:35:00] delivered for to devour her child as
[1:35:03] soon as it was born. And we know the
[1:35:06] story here. I'm not going to go any
[1:35:08] further with that right now. But I I
[1:35:10] just wanted to make sure that we sort of
[1:35:12] highlighted that comparison so that when
[1:35:13] we read this in Revelations chapter 13,
[1:35:15] we understand who this beast is. This is
[1:35:18] not just some other beast. It's not just
[1:35:22] some other figure. The anointing behind
[1:35:25] this is the same one as Revelations 12.
[1:35:29] The exact same identification. uh seven
[1:35:32] heads and 10 horns and upon his heads 10
[1:35:35] crowns and upon his heads the name of
[1:35:38] blasphemy. This is the devil. This is
[1:35:43] the devil power coming to the earth and
[1:35:46] manifesting now through Revelations 13.
[1:35:49] First we look at it and it's the devil,
[1:35:52] that red dragon in heaven.
[1:35:56] But there came a time where that devil
[1:35:57] was kicked out of heaven with the
[1:36:00] minions, with the angels that he
[1:36:02] actually disturbed and got them to leave
[1:36:04] their first estate. And what happened
[1:36:06] was he brought that down to earth. And
[1:36:08] and here we are now in the midst of it.
[1:36:11] And we're able to see this. But I just
[1:36:14] wanted to take a little bit of time
[1:36:15] today and talk about this scripture
[1:36:16] here. In verse two, it says, "And the
[1:36:18] beast which I saw was like unto a
[1:36:22] leopard, and his feet were as the feet
[1:36:24] of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of
[1:36:27] a
[1:36:27] lion, and the dragon gave him his power
[1:36:32] and his seat, and great
[1:36:35] authority." Brother, are you able to
[1:36:37] bring up that picture that I sent last
[1:36:41] week? That that creature for the United
[1:36:44] Nations?
[1:36:48] The beast which I saw, this is John the
[1:36:52] Revelator talking about this. We know
[1:36:54] that he was caught up in the Lord's day.
[1:36:57] He was caught up into another
[1:36:59] dimension. The beast which I saw was
[1:37:02] like unto a
[1:37:04] leopard, and his feet were as the feet
[1:37:07] of a
[1:37:08] bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a
[1:37:11] lion.
[1:37:13] And the dragon gave him his power and
[1:37:17] his seat and great authority. And you
[1:37:21] know, I was doing a little bit of
[1:37:22] reading about this and I think it's
[1:37:24] important to mention
[1:37:26] it. There's a significance behind this
[1:37:29] creature and it's not the creature and
[1:37:33] it's not the people that made the
[1:37:35] creature and it's not the country so
[1:37:38] much as it is the power behind it. what
[1:37:43] that creature is
[1:37:45] representing. The United Nations, the
[1:37:48] nations coming together, united for
[1:37:52] peace. United to bring peace and order
[1:37:56] to the world. This is the United
[1:37:58] Nations. And we know that the the
[1:38:01] creature, I maybe mentioned it last
[1:38:03] time, I don't know if I did. I apologize
[1:38:05] if I didn't. It was created by a couple
[1:38:06] of artists in Mexico and and donated to
[1:38:10] the United States. the United Nations.
[1:38:13] And there's an inspiration behind that.
[1:38:14] I don't really want to get too far into
[1:38:16] that, but I just think the significance
[1:38:17] is is pretty unreal when when you look
[1:38:20] at it. Why would the inspiration be to
[1:38:23] make it as a leopard and to have feet
[1:38:26] like a bear and his mouth as the mouth
[1:38:29] of a lion? And you know, this beast has
[1:38:32] no power. It's just a sculpture. And
[1:38:34] people would say it's fine art, you
[1:38:35] know, and and sure enough, it is. It's
[1:38:37] pretty neat to think that somebody could
[1:38:38] actually create something like that. and
[1:38:40] and and be able to give it as a gift.
[1:38:44] It's it's amazing. But what's the
[1:38:45] inspiration behind it?
[1:38:48] I think the wise have the ability to
[1:38:51] discern things like this. And if you
[1:38:54] look online, they will say that, oh,
[1:38:56] some people say that this is the
[1:38:58] manifestation of the end times and the
[1:39:00] apocalypse is upon us when this is here.
[1:39:02] And you know, we don't need this to be
[1:39:05] able to say amen to all of that. We had
[1:39:07] a vindicated prophet that told us it's
[1:39:09] later than we think. But when we can
[1:39:11] look at natural occurrences, things that
[1:39:14] are actually happening around us, and
[1:39:16] and be able to see that we can draw a
[1:39:18] parallel with scripture, I I think
[1:39:21] that's the Lord we serve. He doesn't
[1:39:22] leave us in the dark. It's amazing to
[1:39:25] see this. That's okay, brothers. You can
[1:39:28] you can turn it off now. I just want to
[1:39:30] make sure that we we brought that up.
[1:39:31] And the beast which I saw was like unto
[1:39:33] a leopard. His feet were like of a bear
[1:39:35] and his mouth is the mouth of a lion.
[1:39:37] And that's the representation of it. But
[1:39:39] the dragon gave him his power and his
[1:39:42] seat and great authority. So what we're
[1:39:45] talking about here isn't so much that
[1:39:47] that that sculpture and and maybe the
[1:39:50] the inspiration behind the creation of
[1:39:52] it. Sometimes I think people have
[1:39:54] inspiration and they don't even
[1:39:56] understand why they have inspiration.
[1:39:57] And I'm sure if you were to talk to
[1:39:59] maybe music artists and ask them why you
[1:40:01] had the inspiration to write songs like
[1:40:04] you wrote, they would say, "I don't
[1:40:05] know. It just came to me. It just in a
[1:40:07] certain way, in a certain setting, in a
[1:40:09] certain place and time, the inspiration
[1:40:11] strikes and I just pick up my pen and
[1:40:13] write." Isn't that interesting? It
[1:40:15] sounds a little familiar, doesn't it?
[1:40:18] Inspiration can get behind a pen in the
[1:40:21] hand of a person.
[1:40:24] Many songs come from inspiration. But
[1:40:27] you know, there's only two sources of
[1:40:28] inspiration, isn't there, in this world.
[1:40:30] The prophet of God says, "We don't even
[1:40:32] have a thought coming." I know. I
[1:40:33] remember hearing ministers say that, and
[1:40:35] I thought, "Wow, that's just a
[1:40:36] legalistic minister." But the prophet of
[1:40:37] God said that we we've got one of two
[1:40:41] voices to listen to. We've got the Lord
[1:40:43] in our life or we've got the devil in
[1:40:46] our
[1:40:47] life. And we can choose which one we
[1:40:50] listen to. But here we have this beast
[1:40:53] that that rises up. It's got seven heads
[1:40:55] and 10 horns. Upon his horns, 10 crowns
[1:40:57] and upon his heads the name of
[1:40:59] blasphemy. A and this beast which I saw
[1:41:03] that we just saw the picture of. He
[1:41:06] has authority. He has power and he has a
[1:41:10] seat that the dragon gave him. It's
[1:41:14] pretty amazing to think about. So now
[1:41:15] let's move from the sculpture and let's
[1:41:17] talk a little bit about the United
[1:41:18] Nations because that's what we're
[1:41:20] talking about. That's the seat. That is
[1:41:23] the authority and that is the power. And
[1:41:26] we know that every single country that
[1:41:28] wants to be a part of this can be a part
[1:41:30] of this. But they have to be a part of
[1:41:31] this the way that they have decided this
[1:41:33] is the way it works. And some of the
[1:41:35] countries have backed out of it and said
[1:41:37] forget about it. We're not going to try
[1:41:39] and create an alliance and do things the
[1:41:41] way that you want to do it because it's
[1:41:42] in the United States of America. And and
[1:41:45] those countries, they will never be
[1:41:46] governed by the United States of America
[1:41:48] and namely the communist countries. And
[1:41:51] we know that the prophet in our day, he
[1:41:53] said that you don't have to fear
[1:41:54] communism. You don't have to fear
[1:41:57] Nazism, but you should fear something.
[1:42:00] He said you should fear one thing. And
[1:42:03] that one thing is the purple curtain.
[1:42:06] Amen. And that purple curtain is Rome.
[1:42:11] Amen. It's so interesting and maybe even
[1:42:13] contrary to the way that this world
[1:42:15] thinks. But you know, how will the devil
[1:42:17] take over this entire world? How will he
[1:42:20] have such great authority and power that
[1:42:22] the entire world will worship him
[1:42:26] and not even realize
[1:42:30] it? We know that he was created co-equal
[1:42:33] with God just that he can't create.
[1:42:39] But this this beast which he saw that
[1:42:43] had power and a seat and
[1:42:47] authority. And he goes on to say here,
[1:42:49] John preaching this, he says, writing
[1:42:52] this under inspiration in the spirit on
[1:42:54] the Lord's day, and I saw one of his
[1:42:55] heads as it were wounded to death, and
[1:42:59] his deadly wound was
[1:43:02] healed, and all the
[1:43:04] world wandered after the
[1:43:09] beast. And we know that this is the
[1:43:11] Roman Catholic Church. If you look at
[1:43:14] the horse riders and and and the uh the
[1:43:18] seals, brother Brandham talks about
[1:43:20] this. He talks about it very clearly in
[1:43:22] there. And I just have a couple of
[1:43:24] quotes that I'm going to bring today.
[1:43:25] I'm not going to be a quote reader today
[1:43:27] and go too far with them, but there are
[1:43:29] a couple that I want to mention, but
[1:43:31] just talking about this here, how this
[1:43:33] beast is there was a head that was
[1:43:36] wounded unto death and we know this
[1:43:39] deadly wound was healed. Brother Bradom
[1:43:41] says very clearly this was the Catholic
[1:43:42] Church in the early days and and it was
[1:43:45] a shift from the way the Roman church
[1:43:48] operated in the early days. A and we
[1:43:52] know that it almost died because the
[1:43:54] people got fed up with it and rose up
[1:43:56] against it. A and what happened was that
[1:43:59] was the wound to its head. And somehow
[1:44:02] that beast, he's conniving. He wasn't
[1:44:05] willing to just lay down and die. So
[1:44:08] what did he do? He changed his mask and
[1:44:10] we know that the prophet talked about
[1:44:11] that in morph. God does it and the devil
[1:44:14] does it. And what happened was it
[1:44:16] shifted from the way the Roman Catholic
[1:44:18] Church did it and it shifted to paple
[1:44:20] Rome. A and so what it is now is there
[1:44:23] is a vicor to Christ. There is a pope
[1:44:25] that sits on the on the throne and he
[1:44:27] has the triple crown. We know that there
[1:44:30] is a verse at the end of Revelation
[1:44:33] chapter 13. It says, uh, maybe verse 17
[1:44:37] at the end of it, it says, "And no man
[1:44:39] might by ourselves, save he that hath
[1:44:40] the marker, the name of the beast, or
[1:44:42] the number of his name. Here is the
[1:44:44] wisdom. Let him that hath understanding,
[1:44:46] count the number of the beast, for it is
[1:44:50] the number of a man." Brother Brandham
[1:44:52] talks very specifically about numbers
[1:44:54] and the significance of numbers and the
[1:44:57] biblical numerology. And and number six
[1:45:00] specifically is the number of a man.
[1:45:04] And we know that number six, it goes
[1:45:06] into the sixth seal, the sixth church
[1:45:08] age. There's many different parallels
[1:45:10] that we can draw with it. The six is the
[1:45:14] number of the man. But it says here, for
[1:45:17] it is the number of a man, and it is the
[1:45:20] number is 600, three score, and six.
[1:45:24] Many people are looking for a mark that
[1:45:26] they're going to have to put on their
[1:45:27] hand or on their forehead. And we've
[1:45:28] talked about this in the past. It's
[1:45:30] actually the thoughts towards the action
[1:45:34] and then the action that comes forward
[1:45:36] in the day in which we live. It's not
[1:45:37] going to be a physical mark before the
[1:45:39] church of the living God gets to go
[1:45:42] home. It's actually going to be a
[1:45:44] spiritual mark. And you know, it's as
[1:45:47] simple as this. To reject the baptism of
[1:45:48] the Holy Ghost is to accept that mark.
[1:45:51] We know that there was a time where the
[1:45:54] prophet saw a vision and he was told
[1:45:57] that there should be an angel. There
[1:45:59] should be a group of men that actually
[1:46:01] go and walk through the city and find
[1:46:04] those that are sighing and crying for
[1:46:06] the abominations that are in the land.
[1:46:08] And one of those men should take an
[1:46:09] inhorn with him and go and set a mark
[1:46:13] upon those which actually sigh and cry
[1:46:16] for the abominations. and everyone else,
[1:46:19] women, children, old, young, men,
[1:46:23] whoever it is, slay them, destroy them,
[1:46:26] and have no mercy upon any one of them.
[1:46:29] We can see that as a natural type, and
[1:46:32] how there's many times in history that
[1:46:34] that's happened, and it's it's terrible
[1:46:36] to think about. But what's worse is that
[1:46:38] the devil is actually going to have his
[1:46:40] way with all of the people that don't
[1:46:43] actually sigh and cry for the
[1:46:44] abominations in the land.
[1:46:47] Brother Bradom, he says it many times.
[1:46:49] We know it. The true baptism of the Holy
[1:46:51] Ghost, it causes us to say amen to the
[1:46:53] word every time. And we know that that's
[1:46:54] the identification of it is to be able
[1:46:56] to agree with the word for every time.
[1:46:58] But he also says the identification of
[1:47:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is sighing
[1:47:03] and crying for the abominations in the
[1:47:05] land. Amen.
[1:47:07] There's going to be a mark set upon each
[1:47:09] one. And one way or another, we're going
[1:47:12] to have a mark. And if we don't accept
[1:47:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, we've
[1:47:17] already accepted that
[1:47:19] mark. And that is the mark of the beast.
[1:47:23] And we know that the natural types of
[1:47:25] spiritual, the natural marking of people
[1:47:28] is going to come after the spiritual.
[1:47:31] Amen. That's the way it is in the word
[1:47:34] of God. And that's the way it will be
[1:47:36] here in Revelations chapter 13.
[1:47:40] What I want to talk about today is
[1:47:42] Revelations chapter 13 and the relevance
[1:47:44] with Revelations chapter 13 and the
[1:47:46] United States of America. Brother
[1:47:48] Brandham, I believe it is the only one
[1:47:51] that has ever drawn the parallel with
[1:47:53] Revelations chapter 13 being the United
[1:47:57] States of America. Revelations chapter
[1:47:59] 13, the beast which I saw, this is verse
[1:48:01] two, was like unto a leopard. His feet
[1:48:03] were the feet of a bear. His mouth has a
[1:48:05] mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his
[1:48:07] power and his seat and his great
[1:48:10] authority. Now, we've already talked
[1:48:11] about the United Nations here. United
[1:48:14] Nations is in New York. And I saw one of
[1:48:17] his heads as it were wounded to death
[1:48:18] and his deadly wound were healed. And
[1:48:20] all the world wondered after the beast.
[1:48:22] Isn't it interesting how those two are
[1:48:25] tied together now? Rome and the United
[1:48:27] States of America, the the UN. But the
[1:48:31] Pope never says anything about the UN.
[1:48:33] You don't see the pope go to the United
[1:48:35] Nations and address the United Nations.
[1:48:37] Maybe he has. I don't know if he has,
[1:48:39] but you don't hear about Rome coming to
[1:48:42] be a part of the United Nations. This is
[1:48:44] under the surface, brothers and sisters.
[1:48:48] And they worshiped the dragon which gave
[1:48:50] power unto the beast. And they worshiped
[1:48:53] the beast, saying, "Who is like unto the
[1:48:55] beast? Who is able to make war with
[1:48:58] him?"
[1:49:00] My And then you see verse five. And
[1:49:02] there was given unto him a mouth
[1:49:04] speaking great things and blasphemies
[1:49:07] and power was given unto him to continue
[1:49:09] 40 and two months. And we know when we
[1:49:13] excuse
[1:49:15] me when we read this the power was given
[1:49:18] unto him to continue 40 and two months.
[1:49:21] How many knows how many years that is?
[1:49:23] Coincidentally it's exactly what the
[1:49:26] prophet in our day brought. That's three
[1:49:28] and a half years. Exactly three and a
[1:49:31] half years. And we know many people are
[1:49:33] looking for the great tribulation to be
[1:49:35] seven years. But what they're missing is
[1:49:37] that Messiah was cut off in his
[1:49:39] ministry. He was cut off in the first
[1:49:42] three and a half years of his seven-year
[1:49:44] ministry. That's what the prophet in our
[1:49:46] day taught. Amen. And there's going to
[1:49:48] be three and a half years or 40 and two
[1:49:51] months. And there's no coincidence that
[1:49:53] if you see over in Revelations, uh my I
[1:49:56] think it's in Revelations 11, there's
[1:49:58] the two witnesses. I probably have it
[1:50:00] wrong, but the two witnesses, he says,
[1:50:02] I'll give power unto my two witnesses.
[1:50:05] And what are they going to do? They're
[1:50:06] going to minister their ministry for how
[1:50:08] long? 40 and two months. Exactly.
[1:50:11] According to the scripture that we're
[1:50:13] talking about here. So, this guy is
[1:50:16] going to have his power 40 and two
[1:50:18] months when he truly comes to
[1:50:19] manifestation, which he already is in
[1:50:21] position. Now, you can see it. And I'm
[1:50:23] not talking about a physical man. I'm
[1:50:25] talking about the power, the authority,
[1:50:27] the seat that we can already see in the
[1:50:30] United States of America.
[1:50:33] But you know, we I I'll never forget it.
[1:50:36] Sometimes you just hear a sermon
[1:50:37] preached and you hear somebody say
[1:50:39] something and brother Joshua one time he
[1:50:42] preached and he talked about the United
[1:50:43] States of America in Revelations chapter
[1:50:46] 13 and how they have 13 stars and 13
[1:50:49] stripes. And if you look at the flag
[1:50:50] today, there isn't 13 stars on the flag.
[1:50:53] And there's more than 13 stripes, I
[1:50:55] believe, on the flag today. But there
[1:50:57] was a flag that was exactly 13 stars and
[1:51:01] 13 stripes. And that came out in
[1:51:05] 1777. That flag was the flag that flew
[1:51:08] until they came out with this new modern
[1:51:10] version of the flag of the United
[1:51:12] States. But sometimes when we're
[1:51:14] Canadians, we can look at it and think,
[1:51:15] "Yeah, 13 stars, 131 131 13, Brother
[1:51:18] Random talks about it. We're exclusive.
[1:51:19] We're Canadians. We're not a part of
[1:51:21] that. But I I was blown away when I
[1:51:23] heard brother Joshua say it. Don't think
[1:51:25] that we're not tied to the United States
[1:51:27] of America. We're on the same continent
[1:51:28] after all. But really, it is an
[1:51:31] invisible line like we here spoke about
[1:51:33] recently. It really is an invisible
[1:51:35] line. They have borders there, but that
[1:51:37] doesn't stop anything spiritually.
[1:51:40] There's no no stopping all of the
[1:51:42] influence that's going on in this world.
[1:51:44] But when we look at at what's going on
[1:51:45] in Canada, we have 13 13 uh colonies,
[1:51:49] don't we? We have 10 provinces and three
[1:51:52] territories. Isn't it interesting how
[1:51:54] we're 13 as well?
[1:51:57] It's no coincidence.
[1:51:59] I remember brother Joshua preaching that
[1:52:01] and I was like, "Wow, that's
[1:52:02] incredible." Yeah. 10 provinces and
[1:52:04] three territories. 13 ties us directly
[1:52:07] together with the United States of
[1:52:08] America. We're not exclusive. Anybody in
[1:52:11] this world is not exclusive, though.
[1:52:13] This is just the seat of the power and
[1:52:16] authority. This is just where it's
[1:52:17] coming up out of. And and we can look at
[1:52:19] this and say we we we we read that John
[1:52:22] said he saw a beast rise up out of the
[1:52:24] sea. We we need to maybe talk about this
[1:52:27] for a minute. Just the beast portion of
[1:52:29] it and and the sea in in out of 1964,
[1:52:33] the feast of the
[1:52:34] trumpets. Just talking about the beast.
[1:52:37] Now it says in paragraph 205. And now
[1:52:40] you see what the beast is, don't you?
[1:52:43] It's a
[1:52:44] power. It's not a person and it's not a
[1:52:47] it's not a a a place or a thing
[1:52:50] necessarily. And and we know that
[1:52:52] there's coming a time where the the
[1:52:54] devil isn't it beautiful. The devil I I
[1:52:57] just think it's so important, brothers
[1:52:59] and sisters, to remember this.
[1:53:01] Revelations, oh my. the devil, he's
[1:53:04] going to be cast into the lake of fire
[1:53:06] where the beast and the false prophet
[1:53:09] are. Right? That's coming. And I think
[1:53:12] it's important for us to remember that.
[1:53:14] Remember that that that's happening. But
[1:53:17] I I think before maybe I was studying
[1:53:19] all this, I always thought there's going
[1:53:20] to be a guy that's going to be the
[1:53:21] beast. But what it is is that power is
[1:53:24] going to be thrown into the lake of
[1:53:26] fire. And we know that death is going to
[1:53:27] be thrown into the lake of fire. Hell is
[1:53:29] going to be thrown into the lake of
[1:53:30] fire. All denominationalism is going to
[1:53:33] be thrown into the lake of fire. Anybody
[1:53:35] whose name was not found written on the
[1:53:36] lamb's book of life before the
[1:53:38] foundation of the world, they're going
[1:53:39] to be thrown into the lake of
[1:53:41] fire. It was created for the devil and
[1:53:43] his angels.
[1:53:45] But some people choose to go there.
[1:53:48] Isn't it wonderful that we serve a God
[1:53:50] that gave us the ability to have free
[1:53:51] moral agency? We're able to choose our
[1:53:55] destiny. The only thing is he knows what
[1:53:58] choice we would make.
[1:54:01] So beautiful in in in the feast of the
[1:54:04] trumpets in paragraph 205. And now you
[1:54:05] see what a beast is, don't you? It's a
[1:54:07] power and a power. Ecclesiastical
[1:54:11] power. An ecclesiastical power. A
[1:54:14] religious
[1:54:16] power. You think the beast would be the
[1:54:19] great monster coming up out of the sea
[1:54:21] that maybe looks like the United Nations
[1:54:24] uh leopard there that we saw. It's going
[1:54:26] to be something scary. It's not going to
[1:54:28] be. Brother Brandham says it very
[1:54:29] clearly in questions and answers just
[1:54:31] after feast of the trumpets. He talks
[1:54:33] about how scary it really is because
[1:54:36] it's an ecumenical move. Amen. It's not
[1:54:40] accepting the true baptism of the Holy
[1:54:42] Ghost. It's being a denomination of one.
[1:54:44] It's saying, "I'm going to take the
[1:54:46] message of the hour and make it what I
[1:54:48] want it to be." We've got to make
[1:54:50] ourselves what the message of the hour
[1:54:52] said we ought to be.
[1:54:56] a and a and a and a power an
[1:54:59] ecclesiastical power. Jesus said it' be
[1:55:02] so close like the real thing. It had
[1:55:05] deceived the very elected if it was
[1:55:07] possible. See, brother Barry isn't just
[1:55:09] making this up here. This is what the
[1:55:11] prophet's saying. It'll be that close,
[1:55:13] brothers and sisters. That's why we're
[1:55:16] crying out about it if it was possible.
[1:55:18] But it's not possible. Why not? Because
[1:55:20] you can't deceive God.
[1:55:24] We're not talking about deceiving one
[1:55:25] another. We're talking about getting his
[1:55:27] mind inside of you so that nobody can
[1:55:30] deceive you. Not even the beast himself.
[1:55:33] Not even that power, not even that seat
[1:55:36] or authority. It can't come close.
[1:55:41] It didn't deceive the elected if it was
[1:55:42] possible. But he promised to have
[1:55:45] something here for us in that day that
[1:55:48] we wouldn't be deceived. And that's the
[1:55:50] word and Christ to make it manifest to
[1:55:55] us. Isn't that beautiful? They're
[1:55:58] supernaturals, devils, unseen to the
[1:56:02] eye. But you can see what they're doing.
[1:56:04] See, when we excuse me, when we look at
[1:56:08] the occurrences that are happening in
[1:56:10] this world and and we see the behaviors
[1:56:12] of the governments and we see what's
[1:56:15] going on, we can see this. We've been
[1:56:19] given the ability to see it, but it
[1:56:21] gives us the the hope. It gives us the
[1:56:23] strength and the courage to not be
[1:56:25] afraid to know who is in complete
[1:56:29] control. So this this beast, it rises up
[1:56:33] out of the
[1:56:35] sea. Isn't that an amazing thing to
[1:56:37] think that it rises up out of the sea?
[1:56:39] And you know, it's pretty simple.
[1:56:40] Brother Brandham says that the sea is
[1:56:42] water, right? No, he doesn't say that.
[1:56:46] He doesn't say that. We can look at this
[1:56:47] and I know sometimes you hear people
[1:56:49] interpret the book of Revelations and
[1:56:51] they take it quite literally and say
[1:56:52] that you know the the devil he's he's
[1:56:55] coming up out of the sea and John was
[1:56:57] sitting on the on the beach. He was
[1:56:59] sitting on the beach in the sand and he
[1:57:01] was just relaxing and he saw this beast
[1:57:03] rise up out of the water. That's not
[1:57:05] what took place. He saw the beast rise
[1:57:08] up out of people. The beast rose up out
[1:57:11] of people. The sea represents people.
[1:57:15] And we know that he talks about this
[1:57:17] later on in the book of Revelation. And
[1:57:19] before the throne of God, he saw a sea
[1:57:22] of glass. And brother Brandham brings it
[1:57:24] out very clearly and says that is
[1:57:26] people's, tongues, and nations. It is
[1:57:29] people. It's humans. That is the sea
[1:57:32] that he's talking about. That's where
[1:57:33] this beast rises up from people.
[1:57:37] in 1963 and look away to
[1:57:40] Jesus. Talking about the sea and a bit
[1:57:44] about the dragon 1963 look away to
[1:57:46] Jesus. He says there's coming a time
[1:57:50] upon this nation. Isn't it amazing? We
[1:57:53] need to remember where he's preaching
[1:57:55] this. He's preaching it in
[1:57:56] Jeffersonville, Indiana. He's not in any
[1:57:58] other continent, in any other country.
[1:58:00] There's coming a time upon in this
[1:58:03] nation to where this nation is going to
[1:58:05] exercise all the power that the beast
[1:58:08] had before it which was pagan Rome when
[1:58:12] it became papal Rome. See that this
[1:58:16] nation will do
[1:58:18] that. And to think about
[1:58:21] it, there's never
[1:58:23] been a president in the United States of
[1:58:26] America so bold as the one that's there
[1:58:29] now. He's not afraid to open his mouth
[1:58:31] and just say whatever he wants to say.
[1:58:34] And you know what? God bless him. He
[1:58:38] should. He can't stop the will of God.
[1:58:41] He can't stop the children of God. In
[1:58:44] fact, what he could do is help expedite
[1:58:46] things.
[1:58:49] I think he could actually help our
[1:58:51] cause. But you can see him calling an
[1:58:55] ecumenical move for prayer in the United
[1:58:58] States of America.
[1:59:01] And you know what I want to say today,
[1:59:03] just so anyone would know it, I'm not
[1:59:04] for or against Trump. I'm not for or
[1:59:08] against Carney. I'm not for or against
[1:59:11] any government in this world. I'm for
[1:59:13] Christ. Amen.
[1:59:16] And you know, Brother Brandham even says
[1:59:17] it, as believers, we ain't got no part
[1:59:20] taking part in a political move.
[1:59:24] Because every single political move is
[1:59:26] of the devil.
[1:59:30] The only one that isn't is God.
[1:59:36] Some might hear Brother Barry talk, and
[1:59:38] I do talk about Trump. I'll say it, and
[1:59:40] you've heard me say it. I made the
[1:59:41] mistake of saying, "Brother Trump one
[1:59:43] time.
[1:59:45] You know what? I want to say this,
[1:59:46] brothers and sisters. The prophet in our
[1:59:49] day said, "We're going to be surprised
[1:59:51] one day when we get over there. Who is
[1:59:53] there and who isn't there?" Amen. Is he
[1:59:56] going to be there? I don't know.
[1:59:59] Maybe he's the beast.
[2:00:01] Maybe he's the false prophet. Maybe he's
[2:00:04] a brother. Right? That ain't up to us to
[2:00:08] decide. That's up to God to decide.
[2:00:12] Amen. I'm not supporting him. Don't get
[2:00:14] me wrong. I know that he has some very
[2:00:17] very sketchy things in his life and he's
[2:00:19] going to answer for them. I'm only going
[2:00:22] to look towards my things and and make
[2:00:24] sure that my things aren't sketchy. I
[2:00:25] don't want to be sketchy
[2:00:27] and I'm not going to say anything. But I
[2:00:30] I just think it's amazing when you see
[2:00:31] someone with so much boldness to say the
[2:00:35] things that he says. Does it not line up
[2:00:38] with what we're talking about here? He
[2:00:40] opened his mouth in blasphemy.
[2:00:45] You see him calling for prayer and
[2:00:47] calling for people ministry all over the
[2:00:49] place to come and pray for him and and
[2:00:52] and they do in droves. They love that
[2:00:55] they've got a president that's in the
[2:00:56] United States giving them the religious
[2:00:59] liberties that they once had that the
[2:01:01] other governments were persecuting
[2:01:04] against. But what's actually taking
[2:01:07] place, brothers and sisters? Don't think
[2:01:09] for a second we're going back to a a
[2:01:11] Holy Ghost revival in the United States
[2:01:13] of America or in Canada. That's not
[2:01:16] what's taking place. Pap Rome is moving
[2:01:19] in for its position.
[2:01:22] That's right. There is coming a time
[2:01:24] upon this nation to where this nation is
[2:01:26] going to exercise all the power that the
[2:01:29] beast had before it which was pagan Rome
[2:01:32] when it became papal Rome. See that this
[2:01:35] nation will do that. Revelations 13
[2:01:38] plainly explains it. We didn't go on to
[2:01:41] to read about it. Let maybe let's just
[2:01:43] read this. We've got a couple minutes
[2:01:45] here before we're going to have to
[2:01:47] close. It's amazing how time
[2:01:49] goes. Verse 7 in Revelations chapter 13.
[2:01:53] And it was given unto him to make war
[2:01:54] with the saints and to overcome them.
[2:01:56] And power was given him over all
[2:01:58] kindreds and tongues and nations. and
[2:02:01] all that dwell upon the earth shall
[2:02:02] worship him whose names are not written
[2:02:04] in the book of life of the lamb slain
[2:02:06] before the foundation of the world. If
[2:02:08] any man hath an ear, let him hear. If
[2:02:10] you have an ability to hear this,
[2:02:12] brothers and sisters, you've got an ear.
[2:02:14] He has given you the ability to know
[2:02:16] that your name has been written in the
[2:02:18] lamb that was slain before the
[2:02:20] foundation of the world in that book.
[2:02:22] And and your name is written with blood.
[2:02:24] It can't be erased. Amen. Verse 10 says,
[2:02:27] "He that leadth into captivity shall go
[2:02:29] into captivity. He that kleth with a
[2:02:32] sword must be killed with a sword." Here
[2:02:33] is the patience and the faith of the
[2:02:37] saints. And I beheld another beast
[2:02:39] coming up out of the earth, and he had
[2:02:42] two horns like a
[2:02:45] lamb. And he spake as a
[2:02:49] dragon. We have all this symbolism. It's
[2:02:52] amazing to think about. But we have a
[2:02:53] prophet in our day, backwoods hillbilly
[2:02:57] from Kentucky had the ability to say
[2:02:59] that this little lamb that rose up with
[2:03:01] two
[2:03:02] horns. Lambs don't have horns, do
[2:03:06] they? This little lamb that rose up with
[2:03:08] two horns, it actually matches the
[2:03:10] American buffalo. Exactly. He says that
[2:03:15] it matches the American buffalo. And he
[2:03:18] positionally places Revelations chapter
[2:03:21] 13, the United States of America right
[2:03:23] here with
[2:03:24] that. I beheld another beast coming up
[2:03:28] out of the
[2:03:29] earth, not the sea, but the
[2:03:32] earth. And he had two horns like a lamb,
[2:03:35] and he spake as a dragon. And he
[2:03:38] exercisth all the power of the first
[2:03:41] beast before him, and causeth the earth
[2:03:44] and them which dwell therein to worship
[2:03:48] the first beast whose deadly wound was
[2:03:51] healed. And we've had the prophet say,
[2:03:54] we just read that, whose deadly wound
[2:03:55] was
[2:03:57] healed. It went it went from from pagan
[2:04:02] Rome where they had all the pagan gods
[2:04:05] where they destroyed millions and
[2:04:07] millions. Brother Brandham talks about
[2:04:08] the red horse rider and he says the
[2:04:10] reason that guy is red is for all of the
[2:04:12] people that he killed. But we know it's
[2:04:15] the same beast. It's the antichrist
[2:04:16] spirit going through all the different
[2:04:18] ages. But the reason he was red in that
[2:04:20] age for that time, it was because of all
[2:04:23] the people that he killed. But it was
[2:04:26] pagan Rome at the time. And it shifts to
[2:04:28] papal roman. And it's going to exercise
[2:04:30] all the power of the first beast before
[2:04:33] him that causth the earth and them which
[2:04:36] dwell therein to worship the first beast
[2:04:38] whose deadly wound was healed. So we
[2:04:40] know that's Rome. And he doeth great
[2:04:42] wonders so that he maketh fire come down
[2:04:45] from heaven on the earth in the sight of
[2:04:47] men. Now unfortunately I don't have that
[2:04:49] quote with me for 13. Revelations 13:13.
[2:04:53] Isn't that an interesting parallel right
[2:04:55] there? But what I want to say is brother
[2:04:58] Bradom says that that's already taken
[2:05:00] place. That's already happened. The
[2:05:02] United States of America, Revelations
[2:05:03] chapter 13, is already called fire down
[2:05:05] from heaven in the sight of all men in
[2:05:08] Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[2:05:12] It's taken place. This is history. And
[2:05:14] deceiveth them that dwell on the earth
[2:05:17] by the means of those miracles which he
[2:05:20] hath power to do in the sight of the
[2:05:22] beast.
[2:05:25] Rome sits by and
[2:05:27] watches paple Rome watches this take
[2:05:32] place my
[2:05:36] my saying to them that dwell on the
[2:05:39] earth that they should make an image to
[2:05:41] the beast which had the wound by a sword
[2:05:44] and did live and what is the image of
[2:05:45] the beast image unto the beast is the
[2:05:47] ecumenical move it is all of the nominal
[2:05:51] Christians that don't accept this word
[2:05:54] of the vindicated prophet. All of the
[2:05:56] churches that claim Jesus Christ, they
[2:05:58] are the ones he's speaking about here.
[2:06:01] And I know some people might be wincing
[2:06:03] at that, getting upset. But, you know,
[2:06:05] we've already said it. To reject the
[2:06:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost is to receive
[2:06:09] the mark of the beast. That is the way
[2:06:12] it is. That's where we're at, brothers
[2:06:13] and sisters. In verse 15, it says, "And
[2:06:16] he had power to give life unto the image
[2:06:19] of the beast." Oh, those churches can
[2:06:23] exist. They can still operate. They can
[2:06:26] still have charitable organization
[2:06:27] numbers. They can still function and
[2:06:30] worship. They can still have all that
[2:06:33] they want to do so long as they're
[2:06:35] willing to actually do it the way that
[2:06:36] they want
[2:06:38] it. He had power to give life unto the
[2:06:41] image of the beast. that the image of
[2:06:44] the beast should both speak and cause
[2:06:47] that as many as would not worship the
[2:06:49] image of the beast should be
[2:06:52] killed. Now, we're we'll get into all of
[2:06:55] this. I just wanted to read this here.
[2:06:57] Verse 16. And he causth all both small
[2:07:00] and great, rich and poor, free and bond.
[2:07:02] Doesn't matter who it is. Every single
[2:07:04] human being on the earth, no matter what
[2:07:07] your stature is, where you live, or what
[2:07:10] you're doing, to receive a mark in their
[2:07:12] right hand or in their
[2:07:14] foreheads, that no man may buy or sell,
[2:07:17] save he that hath the mark, or the name
[2:07:19] of the beast, or the number of his name.
[2:07:22] Here is the wisdom. Let him that hath
[2:07:23] understanding count the number of the
[2:07:24] beast, for it is a hu the number of a
[2:07:26] man, and his number is 63 score and six.
[2:07:32] out of look away to Jesus. We we read
[2:07:34] this here. There's coming uh my I'm
[2:07:38] actually going backwards. I don't want
[2:07:39] to do that. I want to go forwards. You
[2:07:40] know, there's the the beast that rises,
[2:07:44] the seven heads and the 10 horns and the
[2:07:46] seven crowns. We we saw the parallel. We
[2:07:49] can understand it. how the beast was in
[2:07:52] heaven that that that dragon, he was
[2:07:55] able to influence and take away those
[2:07:58] angels to try and persuade them to think
[2:08:01] that there's something other than their
[2:08:03] estate, the position that they're in.
[2:08:05] There is a greater calling. And you
[2:08:07] know, many times that's the way the
[2:08:09] devil works today in the church. Maybe
[2:08:12] the the way that the church is
[2:08:13] operating, it's just maybe not as
[2:08:16] fascinating or as good as we would like
[2:08:17] it to be. Maybe there's deeper things
[2:08:20] being spoken of in different ways, but
[2:08:23] you know, God knows exactly what we need
[2:08:25] in the way that we need it. And and the
[2:08:27] devil is going to try and influence us
[2:08:29] to think that there's other ways that it
[2:08:31] should be done exactly like those angels
[2:08:33] were drawn away from. But those those
[2:08:35] those angels, they followed someone who
[2:08:38] had the the seven heads and the t horns.
[2:08:41] And it's exactly the same as the book of
[2:08:44] Revelation in chapter 13.
[2:08:47] But we know that the beast rose up out
[2:08:50] of a sea and it's a power. And you know,
[2:08:52] I just want to identify this in 1963 out
[2:08:55] of the fifth seal. The USA is definitely
[2:08:57] in the Bible. Brother Brandham, he says,
[2:08:59] "Now we find out that the beast of
[2:09:01] Daniel, it meant that it was a power
[2:09:05] raising up amongst the people." All
[2:09:07] right. And John's visions here also
[2:09:10] showed that it was powers, nations
[2:09:12] rising up like the United Nations
[2:09:15] appears in the sorry the United States
[2:09:18] appears in Revelations 13 as a lamb.
[2:09:22] Then if you want to know different, you
[2:09:25] say, well that's talking about national
[2:09:27] power. It also represents holy power
[2:09:31] too.
[2:09:32] A beast. Did you know that? I'll call
[2:09:35] the musicians as we close today.
[2:09:38] Notice
[2:09:39] Rebecca. When the servant of Abraham,
[2:09:43] Eleazar, when he came to get
[2:09:45] Rebecca, she mounted upon a camel, the
[2:09:49] very camel she watered. Amen. And she
[2:09:52] rode this camel to meet her unseen
[2:09:55] bridegroom.
[2:09:57] The very thing she
[2:10:00] watered was the thing that took her to
[2:10:03] her future home and husband. Right,
[2:10:07] brothers and sisters. I want to let that
[2:10:08] soak in today. The very thing that she
[2:10:12] watered was the thing that took her to
[2:10:15] her future home and husband. Prophet of
[2:10:19] God speaking here. And it's the same
[2:10:21] thing today. See, the very thing that
[2:10:24] the church is watering, that is the
[2:10:27] seed, the seed of the word. It's the
[2:10:29] very word that becomes alive and carries
[2:10:33] us to our unseeded bridegroom.
[2:10:35] [Music]
[2:10:36] Where is that word alive, brothers and
[2:10:38] sisters? Where do we water that word?
[2:10:40] Sure enough, we come into the church and
[2:10:42] we know that we get washed by the water
[2:10:44] of the word. The water of the word is
[2:10:45] raining down on the just and the unjust
[2:10:47] all at the very same time. The thing
[2:10:50] that's so beautiful is every single seed
[2:10:53] takes in that water. And every single
[2:10:55] seed grows and rejoices from the
[2:10:58] nourishment of that water. Amen.
[2:11:01] And there ain't no way we can hide what
[2:11:03] seed is inside of us. It's beautiful.
[2:11:06] Brother Brandham says, "And look how
[2:11:08] perfectly Isaac had left the home and
[2:11:10] was out in the fields away from his home
[2:11:13] when Rebecca saw him." And you know, I
[2:11:16] just think it's beautiful, brother
[2:11:18] Brandham. He says it in the church meets
[2:11:19] Christ in the air. Maybe stand with me
[2:11:21] as we close today. And the church meets
[2:11:23] Christ in the air. And then he takes her
[2:11:25] back into the home, father's home, where
[2:11:29] the mansions are promised. Isaac took
[2:11:32] Rebecca the same way. And notice it was
[2:11:35] love at first sight. Oh my. She just run
[2:11:38] to meet him. And that's the way the
[2:11:40] church will meet Christ in the air and
[2:11:43] forever be with him. Brothers and
[2:11:46] sisters, today I just want to say, make
[2:11:48] sure that we work work out our own
[2:11:51] salvation with fear and trembling. make
[2:11:53] sure that we diligently work out our
[2:11:56] calling and election
[2:11:59] and make sure that we water it. As long
[2:12:01] as we're watering it, the thing that
[2:12:03] we're watering is the thing that will
[2:12:05] take us home. We don't have to be afraid
[2:12:08] when we see all this nonsense going on
[2:12:10] in the world. All of these things that
[2:12:12] are upset and and and turned over and
[2:12:15] backwards and all of the different
[2:12:18] confusing things and ways that the
[2:12:20] governments are behaving and acting,
[2:12:22] they don't have to cause fear in our
[2:12:24] lives. My desire today is that we would
[2:12:26] have more encouragement, that we would
[2:12:28] have courage to see that God has this
[2:12:31] all under control, that he's given us
[2:12:32] the ability to understand it. He's given
[2:12:34] us an ear to hear what the spirit saith
[2:12:37] unto the church. Amen. God richly bless
[2:12:40] you today as we close in prayer.
[2:12:43] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[2:12:45] your word and thank you Lord that we
[2:12:46] don't have to be afraid as we see these
[2:12:48] things happening. Lord, we can see that
[2:12:51] nations are rising against nations,
[2:12:53] kingdoms against
[2:12:55] kingdoms, pestilence and
[2:12:57] earthquakes. Oh father, so many
[2:13:00] different things taking
[2:13:01] place even in our day in which we live,
[2:13:04] Lord. Having to see a pandemic take
[2:13:07] place where the whole world shuts down
[2:13:09] at the same time. So many things you've
[2:13:12] given us to see, Lord, in the day in
[2:13:14] which we live. And we're thankful, Lord
[2:13:16] Jesus, because we have the desire to
[2:13:19] worship you in spirit and in truth. And
[2:13:22] that only comes by your spirit living
[2:13:24] out through us. Father, I pray that
[2:13:26] Lord, if there's anybody here today that
[2:13:29] desires to know you more, Father, that
[2:13:32] desires the true baptism of your Holy
[2:13:34] Spirit, that Lord, you would just grant
[2:13:37] it to them in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:13:39] Father, we know that while while Peter
[2:13:42] yet spake these words, your spirit fell
[2:13:45] on a whole bunch of people. Lord, we
[2:13:47] know that, Father, it's not our words,
[2:13:50] Lord. It's your word that brings life.
[2:13:53] And Father, we just ask that Lord, you
[2:13:56] would bless everyone who has the desire,
[2:13:58] Lord. And anybody that maybe has grown a
[2:14:00] little bit cold in their experience,
[2:14:02] Father, that desires more of you, that
[2:14:04] you would grant it to them, Father, in
[2:14:06] the name of Jesus Christ. Father, I lift
[2:14:08] my hand unto you and say, Lord, I need
[2:14:10] more. Father, we love you and we thank
[2:14:13] you for your goodness and your tender
[2:14:15] mercies to us. We pray that you would
[2:14:17] just be with each one now as we go our
[2:14:19] separate ways, Lord. Be with those who
[2:14:21] couldn't come today for whatever the
[2:14:22] reason, Lord. wherever they're at, maybe
[2:14:25] traveling or
[2:14:26] working. Father, we just want to ask
[2:14:30] Lord that you would go with us now as we
[2:14:31] go our separate ways that we would
[2:14:33] consider the words that were spoken
[2:14:34] today, Father. And Lord, if we have any
[2:14:37] questions, Lord, we know it's a
[2:14:39] scriptural question. There has to be a
[2:14:42] scriptural answer for it, Lord Jesus. We
[2:14:44] love you and we thank you. We just ask
[2:14:46] all these things now. In Jesus Christ's
[2:14:49] name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[2:14:53] Amen. Is so glad to trust in
[2:14:57] Jesus. Is so sweet. Is so sweet. It is
[2:15:02] so sweet to trust in
[2:15:09] Jesus. Just to
[2:15:12] take him at his word.
[2:15:18] just to
[2:15:21] rest upon his
[2:15:25] promise. Just to
[2:15:28] know the
[2:15:30] [Music]
[2:15:33] savior.
[2:15:35] Jesus.
[2:15:37] Jesus. How I trust him. How I
[2:15:45] through him more and
[2:15:49] more
[2:15:51] Jesus.
[2:15:53] Jesus
[2:15:55] preious
[2:15:57] Jesus. Oh for grace to trust him.
[2:16:07] Oh, how
[2:16:09] sweet to trust in
[2:16:13] Jesus. Just to
[2:16:17] trust his
[2:16:19] cleansing blood.
[2:16:22] I
[2:16:25] saw faith to touch
[2:16:30] me the
[2:16:33] healing
[2:16:35] cleansing
[2:16:37] blood.
[2:16:39] Jesus,
[2:16:41] Jesus, how I trust him. How I
[2:16:48] prove him more and
[2:16:53] more
[2:16:55] Jesus.
[2:16:59] Jesus.
[2:17:01] Jesus. Oh, for
[2:17:04] grace to trust him more.
[2:17:10] Yes, it's
[2:17:12] sweet to trust in Jesus.
[2:17:18] Just cross
[2:17:20] from and to
[2:17:24] sea. Just from
[2:17:30] Jesus
[2:17:32] taking life and
[2:17:35] rest and joy and peace.
[2:17:41] Jesus.
[2:17:44] Jesus. How I trust him. How
[2:17:51] I
[2:17:53] [Music]
[2:17:55] glor
[2:17:57] Jesus.
[2:17:59] Jesus.
[2:18:01] Preious Jesus.
[2:18:04] Oh, for grace to trust
[2:18:11] in. I'm so
[2:18:14] glad I learned to trust him.
[2:18:26] Precious and I
[2:18:30] know
[2:18:31] that Heat. Heat.
[2:18:39] [Music]
[2:18:44] Jesus. Jesus.
[2:18:48] [Music]
[2:18:58] Oh
[2:19:00] Jesus,
[2:19:02] Jesus.
[2:19:03] Precious
[2:19:06] Jesus.
[2:19:07] Oh, praise to trust him more.
[2:19:16] Amen. Can we sing 9005? We don't have
