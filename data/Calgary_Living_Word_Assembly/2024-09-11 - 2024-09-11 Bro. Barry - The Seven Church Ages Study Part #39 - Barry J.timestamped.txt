[50:23] 12 and to the angel of the church in
[50:26] pergamus write these things saith he
[50:30] amen which hath a sharp sword with two
[50:33] edges I Know Thy works and where thou
[50:36] dwellest even where Satan's seat is and
[50:39] thou holdest fast my name and Hast not
[50:42] denied my faith even in those days where

[50:49] martyr

[50:56] against thee because thou Hast there
[50:58] them that hold the doctrine of balum who

[51:04] before the children of Israel to eat
[51:06] things sacrificed unto idols and to
[51:08] commit
[51:09] fornication so hast thou also them that
[51:13] hold the doctrine of the nicians which
[51:15] thing I hate repent or else I will come

[52:08] thank you for that ear Lord we just pray
[52:11] that that ear could become Keen tonight

[53:02] Sunday it'll be at our house and uh
[53:05] we're certainly excited about that we
[53:07] have a communion service coming up on
[53:09] the 22nd and that will be at 5:30 p.m.
[53:12] so that we can hopefully get everyone
[53:14] home at a decent time so that the
[53:16] children can get ready for school are
[53:19] you happy
[53:21] tonight the uh odinos have gone back
[53:25] home they're probably getting on the
[53:26] plane right about now and uh so we know
[53:29] their families took them to the airport
[53:31] tonight and we're certainly thankful for
[53:33] the time we had to visit and fellowship
[53:35] and the influence that they have had on
[53:38] their children they're an absolute
[53:41] blessing tonight we're going to carry on
[53:44] and uh we will definitely finish off the
[53:47] uh pergami and church age Lord
[53:50] willing and I just think it's amazing
[53:52] you know I I think this is uh number 39
[53:56] of the uh of the study service number 39
[54:00] of the study and I just made a note here
[54:02] when we started this and it was October
[54:04] 4th 2023 when we started and we are just
[54:09] just halfway through now so I think it's
[54:11] a a wonderful thing there's so much in
[54:14] here um this is basically the the
[54:17] message of the hour in essence aside
[54:20] from the lives that we live we can quote
[54:23] a bunch of quotes and we can talk about
[54:25] what the prophet did in his day but who
[54:27] are we today what life are we living H
[54:31] how do would people the closest to us
[54:33] describe our lives and I think that's
[54:36] probably the the Keystone of really what
[54:39] the message is it's not a histor history
[54:42] it's not a historical book even though
[54:44] we can uh look at it many times and
[54:46] there's lots of History that's discussed
[54:48] in it but uh we're talking about a
[54:50] living word that's what this this church
[54:52] assembly is called a Living Word
[54:55] assembly and and uh you know if it's not
[54:58] a Living Word then we're just simply
[54:59] wasting our time brother Branham said
[55:02] we're just a lodge then at that point we
[55:04] just get together and have a wonderful
[55:06] time of Fellowship but it has to be
[55:08] Jesus Christ alive inside of us amen
[55:13] tonight we're going to pick up from
[55:14] where we left off on the rewards um I
[55:17] just had one one quote that I wanted to
[55:20] bring from here um the last time I I
[55:23] brought a whole bunch of uh notable
[55:26] quotes from the last um chapter that we
[55:30] were
[55:31] into um I believe it was the saman
[55:35] church age this time I'm only going to
[55:38] bring one and and there's so much in
[55:41] here this is the second longest Church
[55:42] age out of all the church ages the very
[55:44] next one the thot tyan Church age is the
[55:47] longest one and we know that was over
[55:50] the the span of the Dark Ages but uh I
[55:54] think it was just about 900 years but
[55:56] but uh you know out of this one the
[55:58] pergami and church age do you want to
[56:00] look this up brother just type in there
[56:03] it is you can't
[56:05] claim there it is you can't claim I I
[56:09] just want to take a little bit of time
[56:10] and and bring this forward here tonight
[56:12] because I think this is probably for me
[56:16] the most notable out of this church Age
[56:18] and and there's a lot in here I'm not
[56:20] saying that others aren't notable but I
[56:23] just don't really want to take too much
[56:24] time dwelling upon it
[56:28] it's uh and there it is you can't claim
[56:31] that manifestation is the evidence of
[56:34] being Spirit born spirit
[56:38] filled and there it is you can't claim
[56:41] that
[56:42] manifestation is the evidence of being
[56:46] Spirit born spirit filled no sir I'm
[56:51] repeating it because I want the brothers
[56:52] to bring it up and I I apologize I'm
[56:55] pitching a curveball
[56:57] it might even be a screw ball if you
[56:58] know baseball you got her all right and
[57:02] there it is you can't claim that
[57:04] manifestation is the evidence of being
[57:06] Spirit born spirit filled no sir I will
[57:09] admit that true manifestation is the
[57:11] evidence of the Holy Spirit doing Mighty
[57:14] acts but it is not the evidence of the
[57:18] individual being spirit filled even
[57:21] though even though that individual has
[57:25] an abundance of those
[57:29] manifestations the evidence of receiving
[57:32] the Holy Ghost today is just the same as
[57:34] it was back in the day of Our
[57:37] Lord it is receiving the word of Truth
[57:41] for the day in which you
[57:43] live there was people in jesus' day that
[57:46] accepted Jesus they might not have
[57:48] understood him but they accepted him and
[57:50] they followed them yes sir and there was
[57:52] people that didn't it was one or the
[57:54] other that's right
[57:57] it is receiving the word of Truth for
[57:59] the day in which you
[58:02] live Jesus never did stress the
[58:05] importance of the works as he did the
[58:08] word he knew that if the people got the
[58:11] word The Works would follow that is the
[58:15] Bible now I'm saying this I'm hovering
[58:18] here for a minute because I want to let
[58:19] it soak I just want to dwell here for a
[58:21] minute because we can say that we've got
[58:24] the manifestations in our life we can
[58:26] say that we hear the
[58:29] word but what do the two come together
[58:32] in our life do we have the word cause
[58:36] manifestation or do we just simply have
[58:38] the word and some other manifestation or
[58:41] do we just have a manifestation without
[58:44] the word right what do we have in our
[58:47] life the prophet of God is saying here
[58:49] you got to have both it's not
[58:53] optional to claim one and not have the
[58:55] other
[58:56] means that something is a miss something
[58:59] is off the evidence of receiving the
[59:02] Holy Ghost today is the same as it was
[59:04] back in the day of our lord it's
[59:06] receiving the word of Truth for the day
[59:07] in which you live remember when the
[59:09] disciples were empowered by the Lord he
[59:13] sent them out with power right go two by
[59:16] two and they came back and they were
[59:18] having a rejoicing time they were on
[59:20] fire for the Lord they had some
[59:21] tremendous meetings healing campaigns
[59:24] Devils being cast out success in the
[59:27] word but what did Jesus say to them
[59:30] don't don't Rejoice because devils are
[59:33] subject to you rejoice because your name
[59:36] is written in heaven and I wrote it
[59:38] there can you imagine that my Jesus
[59:43] never did stress the importance of the
[59:45] works as he did the word he knew that if
[59:48] the people got the word the true word if
[59:50] they truly got baptized with the Holy
[59:52] Ghost those signs and wonders would
[59:54] follow after them
[59:57] amen now Jesus knew that there was going
[1:00:00] to be a terrible drift away from the
[1:00:02] word in the pergami and age which was
[1:00:05] yet 200 years off from the patmas vision
[1:00:09] he knew that drift would cause them to
[1:00:10] go into the Dark Ages he knew that the
[1:00:13] way man originally got away from God was
[1:00:16] by first leaving the
[1:00:19] word if you leave that word you have
[1:00:24] left God right amen so if we have one
[1:00:28] substitute one substitute one tradition
[1:00:31] one teaching one
[1:00:33] something that's different than that
[1:00:35] word we've left
[1:00:38] God
[1:00:40] why if you leave that word you have left
[1:00:42] God thus he is presenting himself to the
[1:00:45] church at pergamus and indeed to all
[1:00:48] churches of all
[1:00:50] ages I am the
[1:00:53] word if you want deity in your midst
[1:00:56] then welcome and receive that word am
[1:01:00] now this is what I wanted to get to
[1:01:02] brothers and sisters this sentence here
[1:01:05] I'm framing it that far back and I'm
[1:01:07] going to go a little further forward but
[1:01:08] this sentence right here don't let
[1:01:13] anyone or anything get between you and
[1:01:17] that
[1:01:19] word how easy it can
[1:01:22] happen it's treacherous in the age in
[1:01:25] which we live the devil wants to get
[1:01:27] anything he can in our way to get us off
[1:01:31] the word right
[1:01:34] anything
[1:01:36] am say it again don't ever let
[1:01:40] anyone or
[1:01:42] anything get between you and that word
[1:01:47] this which I am giving you the word is a
[1:01:50] revelation of myself I am the word
[1:01:54] hallelujah remember that
[1:01:56] who is speaking there I just have to say
[1:01:58] that who is speaking there was this just
[1:02:01] a man was this just William
[1:02:05] bradam I just was listening to questions
[1:02:07] and answers over and over and over and
[1:02:10] uh you know he says someone says are you
[1:02:12] the son of man he says no I am a son of
[1:02:15] man he was the son of man amen he was
[1:02:20] the god Prophet amen I am a prophet amen
[1:02:25] my
[1:02:26] yes the next sentence I'll never forget
[1:02:29] my pastor teaching me this I wonder if
[1:02:32] we are sufficiently impressed with the
[1:02:34] word in our
[1:02:35] midst cuz brothers and sisters don't
[1:02:38] look for some great Revival to happen
[1:02:40] this is it manen are we sufficiently
[1:02:43] impressed with the word right here in
[1:02:44] our midst right I wonder if we're
[1:02:47] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:02:49] our midst let me give you a thought here
[1:02:51] how do we pray we pray in jesus' name
[1:02:53] don't we every prayer is in his name or
[1:02:56] there isn't any answer yet in 1 John
[1:03:00] 5:14 we are told this is the confidence
[1:03:02] that we have in him that if we ask
[1:03:04] anything according to his will he
[1:03:06] heareth us and if we know that he hear
[1:03:11] us whatsoever we ask we know that he we
[1:03:14] have the petitions that we desire of him
[1:03:16] now we ask what is the will of God there
[1:03:20] is only one way to know his will and
[1:03:23] that is by the word of God Lamentations
[1:03:26] 3:37 who is he that saith and it cometh
[1:03:30] to pass when the Lord commandeth it not
[1:03:33] there it is if it isn't in the word you
[1:03:35] can't have it so we can't ask unless
[1:03:39] it's in the word and we can't petition
[1:03:42] or ask unless it's in his
[1:03:45] name there it is again Jesus the name is
[1:03:49] the word will you can't separate God and
[1:03:53] the word they are one
[1:03:56] I think that's so
[1:03:57] beautiful that's the most notable for me
[1:03:59] out of this paman church age I think
[1:04:02] it's so important but brothers and
[1:04:04] sisters don't ever this is man or
[1:04:07] Prophet or God speaking through the man
[1:04:09] Prophet don't ever let anyone or
[1:04:12] anything get between you and that word
[1:04:16] myen talking about the rewards out of uh
[1:04:20] the pergami and church age here in
[1:04:21] Revelations chapter 2 Revelations 2
[1:04:25] verse
[1:04:26] 17 he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:04:28] the spirit saith unto the churches to
[1:04:31] him that overcometh will I give to eat
[1:04:33] of the Hidden mana and I will give him a
[1:04:35] white stone and in the stone a new name
[1:04:39] written which no man knoweth saving he
[1:04:43] that receiveth
[1:04:44] it brother bradam speaking here he says
[1:04:47] each message to each age holds out an
[1:04:51] incentive to the believer and isn't this
[1:04:54] just the way the word the the the Lord
[1:04:56] the word our heavenly father is
[1:04:59] encouraging him to be an overcomer not
[1:05:03] slapping them to be an overcomer not
[1:05:05] pushing them through the pipe to be an
[1:05:06] overcomer but encouraging them
[1:05:09] encouraging them to be an overcomer and
[1:05:12] thereby rewarded of the Lord in this age
[1:05:16] the spirit is promising the hidden mana
[1:05:19] and a new name written in a white stone
[1:05:23] amen now since each of these messages is
[1:05:26] directed to the angel human messenger a
[1:05:30] very great responsibility as well as a
[1:05:33] wonderful privilege is his lot to these
[1:05:36] men God makes special promises as in the
[1:05:40] case of the twel Apostles sitting on 12
[1:05:42] Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:05:47] then remember Paul was given a special
[1:05:49] promise that of presenting the people of
[1:05:53] the Bride in his day to Jesus my 2
[1:05:58] Corinthians 11:2 for I am jealous over
[1:06:00] you with a Godly jealousy for I have
[1:06:04] espoused you to one husband that I may
[1:06:06] present you as a chaste amen virgin to
[1:06:11] Christ I could just take and and
[1:06:13] probably maybe even on Sunday preach an
[1:06:15] entire sermon on that one verse because
[1:06:18] you know what if we're going to be a
[1:06:20] virgin to Christ we're going to be a
[1:06:21] virgin to the word if we're going to be
[1:06:23] a virgin to the word there ain't no room
[1:06:25] for word worldly junk in our lives
[1:06:27] brothers and sisters he is not going to
[1:06:29] play second fiddle to anything Amen to
[1:06:33] anything and and I think we probably
[1:06:36] will get into that maybe on Sunday Lord
[1:06:38] willing paragraph 231 so it will be with
[1:06:43] every messenger who has been faithful to
[1:06:46] the word of his hour and his age it will
[1:06:50] be so in the last day it will be the
[1:06:52] same special reward that was given to
[1:06:55] Paul
[1:06:56] I think most of you remember how I said
[1:06:58] I had always been afraid to die lest I
[1:07:01] should meet the Lord and he should not
[1:07:03] be pleased with me as I have failed him
[1:07:07] so many
[1:07:09] times been a little bible study and uh
[1:07:13] we're going through the church ages and
[1:07:16] it's actually interesting because it's
[1:07:17] way back we're right at the very
[1:07:18] beginning of the exposition of the seven
[1:07:21] Church ages and you know uh part of the
[1:07:23] discussion last night came up and it was
[1:07:26] on the thought of uh fatalism and and
[1:07:31] how we can just come to a place where
[1:07:33] we'll say you know what if if we die
[1:07:35] well it's God's plan and and I'm just
[1:07:38] going to die it's just going to happen
[1:07:39] and and doesn't matter you know there's
[1:07:41] no point to even trying what we do it's
[1:07:44] just God's Will and and the universe is
[1:07:46] just going to take over and and I don't
[1:07:47] have any choice in the matter and you
[1:07:49] know sometimes we don't have any choice
[1:07:51] in the matter but we have a choice in
[1:07:53] how we conduct ourselves in the matter
[1:07:56] and that's the Difference Maker I
[1:07:57] thought it was such a rich thought that
[1:07:59] came out of
[1:08:01] there I just think it's so good to look
[1:08:04] at this and think that we could say
[1:08:07] maybe we could go and meet God and and
[1:08:10] not be ready we have the profit for our
[1:08:13] age saying that it makes me wonder Lord
[1:08:17] do I need to do some work on myself
[1:08:19] maybe I need to do a little more study
[1:08:21] on the inward Parts it it would be a
[1:08:24] fearful thing truly to go and and and
[1:08:26] know that you're going to meet God but
[1:08:28] what an amazing thing as a Believer to
[1:08:30] think that you know what one day that's
[1:08:31] going to happen and we can have
[1:08:33] confidence that we know where we're
[1:08:35] going to go amen For Better or For Worse
[1:08:38] not making Grace a disgrace and saying I
[1:08:40] I know I'm going to die someday anyway
[1:08:42] and I believe the message of the hour so
[1:08:43] I could just go and live any old way I
[1:08:45] want and God's going to sort it out if
[1:08:47] I'm truly elected then I'll never be
[1:08:48] lost right if we're truly elected we'll
[1:08:51] never have that
[1:08:52] attitude right amen
[1:08:56] brother bam goes on to say well I had
[1:08:57] been thinking of that one morning as I
[1:08:59] lay in bed and suddenly I was caught up
[1:09:02] in a most peculiar Vision I say it was a
[1:09:06] PE was peculiar for I have had thousands
[1:09:09] of visions and not once did I seem to
[1:09:12] leave my body but there I was caught up
[1:09:16] and I looked back to see my wife and I
[1:09:18] saw my body laying there beside her then
[1:09:21] I found myself in the most beautiful
[1:09:23] place I have ever seen it was of
[1:09:25] paradise I saw throngs of the most
[1:09:27] beautiful people and happiest people I
[1:09:30] have ever seen they all looked so young
[1:09:33] about 18 to 21 years of age there was
[1:09:37] not a gray hair or a wrinkle or any
[1:09:40] deformity amongst them the young women
[1:09:43] all had their hair down to their waist
[1:09:45] and the young men were so handsome and
[1:09:48] strong isn't that beautiful we can look
[1:09:51] at this and say wow this is you know
[1:09:53] brother bradam he's got this this this
[1:09:55] Vision that he says that he had but you
[1:09:57] know remember we'll see that that he
[1:10:00] says it in here that he preached what
[1:10:01] Paul preached yeah that's what we
[1:10:03] believe we don't believe that brother
[1:10:04] brandham brought a new message that's
[1:10:06] outside of the word of God he he
[1:10:08] preached what Paul preached and we're
[1:10:09] resting on that that's what we said to
[1:10:12] him in this Vision here but if you'll
[1:10:14] turn with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 12
[1:10:18] I just think it really Bears uh it's
[1:10:22] important to just make sure that we're
[1:10:24] not we're not just making this stuff up
[1:10:26] this isn't just something that's drummed
[1:10:28] up and and we call it the message and
[1:10:30] and whatever and it sounds good it's
[1:10:32] important to recognize there's a
[1:10:34] scriptural identity to what this man's
[1:10:36] talking about here he he he said that he
[1:10:39] was caught up and he saw his body lying
[1:10:42] there in 2 Corinthians 12: 1 to 4 we
[1:10:47] have Paul speaking here and it's called
[1:10:49] Paul's vision is the footnote in my
[1:10:51] Bible it's not expedient for me
[1:10:53] doubtless to Glory I will come to
[1:10:55] visions and Revelations of the Lord I
[1:10:59] knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago
[1:11:03] whether in the body I cannot tell or
[1:11:05] whether out of the body I cannot tell
[1:11:07] God
[1:11:08] knoweth such and one caught up to the
[1:11:11] third heaven right and I knew such a man
[1:11:14] whether in the body or out of the body I
[1:11:16] cannot tell God knoweth how that he was
[1:11:19] caught up into
[1:11:22] paradise and heard unspeakable Words
[1:11:25] which is it is not lawful for a man to
[1:11:28] utter so here we have Paul going into a
[1:11:32] vision now some people might say well he
[1:11:34] he's just replicating what Paul did and
[1:11:36] so you can tie the Loose Ends back
[1:11:38] together I know how the devil works we
[1:11:39] know how that's the devil will work how
[1:11:41] how theologians will try and say that
[1:11:43] we're just making this up but there's
[1:11:45] some interesting things in this Vision
[1:11:47] that actually separates it from maybe
[1:11:49] what theologians would try and Scorn
[1:11:51] this to be brother bradam in paragraph
[1:11:53] 234 he goes on to say oh how they
[1:11:56] welcomed me they hugged me and called me
[1:11:59] their darling brother and kept telling
[1:12:00] me how glad they were to see me as I
[1:12:03] wondered who all those folks were one
[1:12:05] beside me said they are your
[1:12:09] people now remember this is a man that
[1:12:11] wasn't looking for
[1:12:12] accolades he was never one time looking
[1:12:15] for offerings he was never one time
[1:12:17] looking to be
[1:12:18] promoted he would rather just step aside
[1:12:22] and let somebody else shine that was who
[1:12:24] he was
[1:12:26] but yet all these people were announcing
[1:12:29] him and and and thanking him and and not
[1:12:32] praising him but welcoming him yes sir
[1:12:35] he says I was so astonished I asked are
[1:12:38] all these Brams he said no they are your
[1:12:42] converts amen he then pointed to one
[1:12:45] lady and said see that young lady that
[1:12:47] you were admiring a moment ago right she
[1:12:50] was 90 years old when you won her to the
[1:12:53] Lord amen I said oh I and to think that
[1:12:57] this is what I was afraid of just makes
[1:13:00] me think of Brother Gary Walker's
[1:13:01] testimony remember what he said one day
[1:13:04] we'll look back and say it was all worth
[1:13:06] it every single trial every single pain
[1:13:10] every single problem every issue we'll
[1:13:13] look back and say it was worth it all
[1:13:16] the man said we're resting here while
[1:13:18] waiting for the coming of the Lord I
[1:13:21] replied I want to see him he said you
[1:13:23] can't see him just yet
[1:13:25] but he's coming soon and when he does he
[1:13:28] will come for you first and you will be
[1:13:31] judged according to the gospel you have
[1:13:35] preached and we will be your subjects
[1:13:38] yes sir how many of his subjects do we
[1:13:40] have here tonight I just I just
[1:13:42] highlighted that and we will be your
[1:13:45] subjects I said do you mean I'm
[1:13:47] responsible for all these he said
[1:13:49] everyone you were born a
[1:13:52] leader I asked him will every one be
[1:13:56] responsible what about St Paul he
[1:13:59] answered me he will be responsible for
[1:14:03] his day right I think it's so amazing to
[1:14:06] look at this and say there's all the
[1:14:08] different days you know we can look back
[1:14:10] and say there's wonderful things from
[1:14:12] Paul's day and wonderful things from
[1:14:14] irania day wonderful things from
[1:14:16] Columbus Day and all the different days
[1:14:19] but you know what brothers and sisters
[1:14:21] we're going to be responsible for all of
[1:14:23] those days all of them are a culmination
[1:14:27] to the age in which we live and that is
[1:14:30] where we live that's where we stand he
[1:14:32] answered me he will be responsible for
[1:14:34] his day well I said I've preached the
[1:14:37] same gospel Paul preached and multitude
[1:14:41] cried were resting on that amen and I
[1:14:45] can't help but think brothers and
[1:14:46] sisters because he was not in a natural
[1:14:48] place he was in an eternal place we were
[1:14:52] all right there with him we were all
[1:14:54] there saying that to him
[1:14:56] yes I can see that God is going to give
[1:14:58] a special reward to his Messengers who
[1:15:01] have Faithfully discharge the
[1:15:03] responsibility he has placed upon them
[1:15:06] and that's true I'm sure we all agree
[1:15:09] upon that if they have received the
[1:15:11] revelation of the word for that age and
[1:15:13] Faithfully preached in their day and
[1:15:15] lived what they preached They will
[1:15:17] receive a great reward amen yes that's
[1:15:21] wonderful thing to look at but how does
[1:15:23] that apply to us I can't help but think
[1:15:26] let's just turn over to Matthew chapter
[1:15:29] 10 we still have some time tonight
[1:15:32] amen Matthew chapter
[1:15:42] 10 Matthew chap 10 verse
[1:15:49] 41 very familiar scripture but sometimes
[1:15:53] it just Bears record we need to remind
[1:15:56] ourselves of these things here we have
[1:15:59] them talking about the messengers of the
[1:16:00] ages and how they're going to receive a
[1:16:02] great reward but brothers and sisters
[1:16:04] it's not just for him it's not just for
[1:16:06] them he that receiveth a prophet in the
[1:16:08] name of a prophet shall receive a
[1:16:11] prophet's reward all we have to do is
[1:16:14] receive the prophet amen and he that
[1:16:17] receiveth a righteous man in the name of
[1:16:19] a righteous man shall receive a
[1:16:20] righteous man's
[1:16:22] reward and we know the the very next
[1:16:25] scripture and whosoever shall give to
[1:16:27] drink unto one of these little ones a
[1:16:29] cup of cold water only in the name of a
[1:16:33] disciple verily I say unto you he shall
[1:16:35] in no wise lose his reward some of the
[1:16:39] littlest things that we could ever do
[1:16:41] are going to have some of the greatest
[1:16:43] rewards on the other side what I want to
[1:16:46] point out here brothers and sisters is
[1:16:48] don't push this off and make it just for
[1:16:49] the prophet Just For The Messengers just
[1:16:51] for the age Messengers take it and make
[1:16:54] it yours
[1:16:55] take it and Own It know that it's our
[1:16:58] reward we are going to get the same
[1:17:00] reward because we believe the same word
[1:17:02] that he
[1:17:03] brought carrying on he says now with
[1:17:05] this thought in mind look at the verse
[1:17:08] again I will give him the hidden Mana we
[1:17:11] all know the Mana was angel food it was
[1:17:15] what God sent down upon the grass for
[1:17:19] Israel at the time of their wanderings
[1:17:21] it was perfect
[1:17:22] food it was a amazing how those little
[1:17:26] pellets of food kept them in perfect
[1:17:29] health no one got sick it was all they
[1:17:31] needed when the ark was made they put
[1:17:34] some of that Mana into it then the ark
[1:17:36] was put behind the veil and only the
[1:17:38] high priest would dare approach unto it
[1:17:42] unto I and then he had
[1:17:46] sorry approach unto I and then he had to
[1:17:50] have the sacrificial blood the bread
[1:17:53] from Heaven symbolized by Mana one day
[1:17:57] came down from heaven and became life
[1:17:59] for all who believe on him amen he said
[1:18:03] I am the bread of life I am the living
[1:18:06] bread that came down from heaven If any
[1:18:09] man shall eat of this bread he shall
[1:18:11] live forever John 648 and
[1:18:17] 51 let's turn over to Luke
[1:18:20] 10 Luke 10 verse 23 and 24
[1:18:38] four this Mana that came down from
[1:18:41] heaven fed the children of Israel and we
[1:18:43] know they had it there to sustain them
[1:18:46] and it was perfect food it was angel
[1:18:48] food brother Bram goes into talking
[1:18:49] about it here but it's interesting
[1:18:52] because the human response to it was
[1:18:55] what is it and that's the definition one
[1:18:58] of the definitions of Mana what what is
[1:19:00] this and and they got sick of it they
[1:19:03] got bored of it and and that's where I
[1:19:05] can't help but think about that that
[1:19:07] quote that we read a little bit earlier
[1:19:09] tonight are we sufficiently impressed
[1:19:11] with the word because this hidden Mana
[1:19:13] is really what we're talking about when
[1:19:15] we talk about this word this is hidden
[1:19:16] Mana this is stuff that people desired
[1:19:19] to see once upon a time but weren't able
[1:19:21] to but here we are it's just natural
[1:19:23] it's just normal in Luke 10 verse 23 and
[1:19:27] he turned unto his disciples and he said
[1:19:29] privately he didn't say it publicly did
[1:19:32] he blessed are your eyes which see the
[1:19:35] things that ye see yes for I tell you
[1:19:38] that many prophets and Kings have
[1:19:41] desired to see those things which ye see
[1:19:44] yes and have not seen them and to hear
[1:19:47] those things which ye hear and have not
[1:19:50] heard them but here we are we have this
[1:19:53] hidden Mana it's just given to us freely
[1:19:57] and uh it's because we have an ear
[1:19:59] because we have the seed Gene of God in
[1:20:01] us when this word comes by our way it
[1:20:03] quickens that seed Gene of God and and
[1:20:05] it comes to life we can't help that but
[1:20:07] I just think it's amazing to look at
[1:20:09] this these little pellets of food every
[1:20:12] time that we read the word every time
[1:20:14] that we listen to a message every time
[1:20:16] we come to church brothers and sisters
[1:20:18] there are little pellets of food and
[1:20:20] sometimes they can actually seem to be a
[1:20:23] little boring and maybe a little bit old
[1:20:25] but I think we heard it well and clear
[1:20:27] on Sunday if we're willing to come
[1:20:29] prepared for service these little
[1:20:30] pellets of food can give us sustenance
[1:20:33] like we've never even imagined these
[1:20:35] little pellets of food kept them in
[1:20:37] perfect health they will keep us in
[1:20:39] perfect health and it says here no one
[1:20:41] got sick you know we're not talking
[1:20:43] about our physical body sometimes we
[1:20:45] will get sick I just feel like preaching
[1:20:47] now but you know brothers and sisters
[1:20:49] don't worry about our physical bodies it
[1:20:50] has to perish we will see Deliverance of
[1:20:53] these physical bodies bodes but worry
[1:20:55] about spiritual sick there are so many
[1:20:58] spiritual viruses going around now it is
[1:21:01] unreal we talk about the the natural
[1:21:04] viruses in this world I would say don't
[1:21:06] worry so much about the natural viruses
[1:21:08] people might take this and make it out
[1:21:10] of context by a recording and that's
[1:21:12] okay they can but just make sure you put
[1:21:14] this part in we're talking about
[1:21:15] spiritual viruses the kind of thing that
[1:21:17] can get in you and you have a real hard
[1:21:20] time getting out the only way that you
[1:21:22] can get a virus out of you is for your
[1:21:24] body to actually outgrow it it has to
[1:21:26] run its course you can have a vaccine or
[1:21:29] some antibodies put in you some sort of
[1:21:31] medication but that virus is not just
[1:21:34] going to leave like some sort of an
[1:21:36] illness some sort of organism that could
[1:21:38] get into you but we have spiritual
[1:21:40] viruses and if we're not careful it will
[1:21:43] take away our ability to see these
[1:21:46] little pellets of food keeping us in
[1:21:48] perfect health keeping us from getting
[1:21:51] spiritually sick but here we have
[1:21:53] brother badam saying it was all the
[1:21:54] children of Israel needed when the ark
[1:21:56] was made they put some of that Mana into
[1:21:58] it when then the ark was put behind the
[1:22:01] veil and only the high priest would dare
[1:22:04] approach unto I and then he had to have
[1:22:08] the sacrificial blood the bread from
[1:22:10] Heaven symbolized by Mana one day came
[1:22:12] down from heaven and became the life for
[1:22:14] all who believe on him we've read these
[1:22:18] scriptures here I am the bread of life I
[1:22:20] am the living bread that came down from
[1:22:22] heaven If any man shall eat of this
[1:22:24] bread he shall live forever John 6:48 to
[1:22:27] 51 when he went away he left us his word
[1:22:31] man shall not live by bread alone by all
[1:22:34] of the natural sustenance in this world
[1:22:37] but by every word that proceeds out of
[1:22:40] the mouth of God I just can't help but
[1:22:42] think about the the prophet Micaiah and
[1:22:45] and the story who's going to get my word
[1:22:47] to come to pass in the life of of Ahab
[1:22:51] the story of him go the god sitting on
[1:22:53] the throne
[1:22:54] and and we know that there was all kinds
[1:22:57] of spirits coming up with different
[1:22:58] ideas but one Spirit came and and knelt
[1:23:00] down before the throne the word of God
[1:23:02] says and says I'll go and deal with them
[1:23:05] and how is he going to deal with them he
[1:23:06] was going to go and be a religious
[1:23:08] spirit a lying religious spirit and God
[1:23:12] said okay go brothers and sisters don't
[1:23:16] think that it was just for that day we
[1:23:18] know the L lid of hell has been torn off
[1:23:21] and all of these Spirits are manifesting
[1:23:23] now don't worry about the natural
[1:23:25] sustenance so much as the
[1:23:28] spiritual my his word was bread it was
[1:23:32] the perfect Mana which if a man live by
[1:23:35] he shall never
[1:23:38] die some people might say but brother
[1:23:40] bury in this flesh we die yeah we will
[1:23:44] all of our
[1:23:45] fleshes they have to perish and what a
[1:23:48] wonderful thing it is I think about this
[1:23:50] guy here and I would much much rather
[1:23:52] lay this flesh down and have a eternal
[1:23:54] life then take this guy with me and be
[1:23:56] struggling with him
[1:23:59] forever we're not talking about this
[1:24:01] flesh Never Dying we're talking about
[1:24:03] our souls Never Dying brother bam says
[1:24:06] right after the death of the fathers no
[1:24:09] one seemed to know the exact truth and
[1:24:11] in a short while this Mana seemed to
[1:24:14] have become hidden to the people but in
[1:24:17] every age God began to give back by
[1:24:19] Revelation that which was hidden until
[1:24:22] this last day according to revelation
[1:24:24] 10:7 a prophet will come and reveal all
[1:24:27] the Mysteries and then the Lord will
[1:24:28] come but we know Revelations 101:7
[1:24:31] there's still an 8
[1:24:32] to13 take the book and eat it up amen
[1:24:35] and it will be sweet as honey in your
[1:24:37] mouth but it'll make your mouth your
[1:24:39] belly bitter your flesh won't be able to
[1:24:41] handle these little pellets of food
[1:24:44] because the little pellets of food
[1:24:45] aren't for this flesh they're for our
[1:24:48] souls the brandom says now in each age I
[1:24:51] say The Messengers receiv received
[1:24:53] hidden truth but they don't did not
[1:24:55] receive it for themselves only but it is
[1:24:58] as it was when the disciples were asked
[1:25:01] to serve the multitudes Loaves and
[1:25:05] Fishes Jesus gave them the broken
[1:25:08] food but they in turn gave it to the
[1:25:10] people right can you imagine the
[1:25:13] disciples in that story I just was
[1:25:15] thinking about it myself can you imagine
[1:25:17] the disciples taking that food and
[1:25:19] actually hybridizing it just pinching a
[1:25:21] little bit maybe and putting it in their
[1:25:22] pocket and thinking I'm just going to
[1:25:24] get my own little bit of each one of
[1:25:25] these foods and maybe I'm going to put a
[1:25:27] little bit of salt on this one here
[1:25:29] because you know maybe it just needs a
[1:25:30] little bit of a a spin on it could you
[1:25:32] imagine if they started doing that to
[1:25:34] that
[1:25:35] food that's what ministers do with this
[1:25:37] word that's right God gives his hidden
[1:25:41] Mana to the Overcomer it cannot be
[1:25:44] otherwise he would not open his
[1:25:46] treasures to those who spurn what is
[1:25:49] already revealed that's so beautiful
[1:25:53] what I have been saying about the
[1:25:55] messenger of each
[1:25:56] age receiving from God some of the
[1:25:59] original truth of Pentecost is typed out
[1:26:02] in the Old Testament where Moses
[1:26:04] commanded to take up three and 1 half
[1:26:07] pints of mana and place it in the golden
[1:26:09] vessel behind the veil of the holy of
[1:26:12] holies there the priest of every
[1:26:15] generation could enter with sacrificial
[1:26:18] blood then he could take a small portion
[1:26:20] of his this Mana for it did not corrupt
[1:26:25] which was part of the original and eat
[1:26:28] it can you imagine that it would just
[1:26:30] never corrupt he is the same yesterday
[1:26:33] today and forever this word purely will
[1:26:37] never corrupt but there's people that
[1:26:39] will try and make it something else
[1:26:41] which will corrupt we know that Jesus
[1:26:44] said you'll know them by their fruits
[1:26:45] just let them go just see what happens
[1:26:47] I'm the vine ye are the branches and
[1:26:49] every single branch that produces fruit
[1:26:51] will be purged and everyone that does
[1:26:54] will be heu down and cast into the
[1:26:56] fire I just can't help but think here
[1:26:58] we've been given the the the story he
[1:27:01] mentions the story about how Moses was
[1:27:03] commanded to to go in there and and the
[1:27:06] high priest once a year he was the only
[1:27:08] one that was able to go in and actually
[1:27:10] see this hidden Mana see these little
[1:27:13] pellets of food that sustained the
[1:27:15] people but you know nowadays we are
[1:27:19] commanded to go in there as well and to
[1:27:22] actually stay out of of that inner Veil
[1:27:25] means death to us once upon a time if we
[1:27:28] went in there it meant death to us
[1:27:31] nowadays to stay out of there means
[1:27:34] death
[1:27:36] thank now in every age the messenger of
[1:27:39] the Lord to that age was given the
[1:27:41] revelation of God for that specific
[1:27:44] period once the messenger was
[1:27:46] enlightened by truth he would bring that
[1:27:49] truth to the
[1:27:51] people and they whose ears ear had been
[1:27:55] opened by the spirit would hear that
[1:27:58] truth believe it and go
[1:28:03] home and live
[1:28:05] it and live
[1:28:08] it just believing it ain't
[1:28:10] enough right saying I believe is the
[1:28:13] start it's just like getting the Holy
[1:28:16] Ghost when we get the Holy Ghost in our
[1:28:17] life that's just the start the
[1:28:20] overcoming power is going to overwhelm
[1:28:22] us for the amount of battles that that
[1:28:24] will go through Hallelujah because the
[1:28:26] battles are going to come there's no way
[1:28:29] around that the battles will come the
[1:28:31] devil's going to rage he is going to
[1:28:33] come and test us all the way to the end
[1:28:36] whether we go in the sky or we go in the
[1:28:38] grave he's going to test us every single
[1:28:40] day of Our Lives there's no way around
[1:28:42] that but the proof is whether we
[1:28:44] actually get mad and go home and say
[1:28:46] there's nothing to it I sered God all
[1:28:49] these years and he just didn't answer my
[1:28:50] prayers the way that I think that he
[1:28:52] should maybe I just didn't try transform
[1:28:54] into some other being like I thought
[1:28:56] maybe I should maybe someone was
[1:28:59] supposed to be a certain way and they
[1:29:01] just never were all these different
[1:29:03] things the devil's going to come around
[1:29:04] and try and make us think but it's all
[1:29:06] lies because the only thing that counts
[1:29:08] is our ability to receive the word to
[1:29:11] say Amen to the word and when we say
[1:29:13] Amen to the word they whose ears had
[1:29:16] been opened by the spirit would hear
[1:29:19] that truth believe it and live it amen
[1:29:24] right and it comes to the place we've
[1:29:25] talked about it where it's not our faith
[1:29:27] any longer it's the end of our faith the
[1:29:29] end of our faith is when we get the Holy
[1:29:31] Ghost brothers and sisters that's when
[1:29:32] that spirit that we hear that's opened
[1:29:34] our ears that's quickened to us that
[1:29:36] truth that we believe it begins to live
[1:29:40] through us thank you Lord and and that's
[1:29:42] really the the tricky part many times we
[1:29:45] see so many people living the word going
[1:29:47] out there living the word and maybe
[1:29:49] they're good at the message of the hour
[1:29:51] and they know lots of quotes and and the
[1:29:53] the word word gets us excited and we can
[1:29:55] say that we've got 10 year in the
[1:29:57] message of the hour but can we live it
[1:30:00] that's the key that's the critical
[1:30:02] Factor what do the people closest to us
[1:30:06] say about us do they say we live it but
[1:30:11] Bram goes on to say now then there is
[1:30:13] also the thought of the future partaking
[1:30:16] of the Hidden Mana I love it because
[1:30:19] there's a time where there's going to be
[1:30:20] a future partaking of it and I say I'm
[1:30:22] so glad I can say I'm one of them I
[1:30:25] think it will be the Eternal partaking
[1:30:27] of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:30:29] Eternal ages to come how else could we
[1:30:33] begin to know the unsearchable riches of
[1:30:35] his own being right all that we have
[1:30:38] longed to know all are unanswered
[1:30:41] questions all that will be revealed amen
[1:30:45] it just brings a rest to know that
[1:30:47] that's really what we're going
[1:30:50] to it will come from Christ who is our
[1:30:53] life
[1:30:54] that we receive it oh sometimes we think
[1:30:58] we get to know a little of him and his
[1:31:00] word down here and it's so good it makes
[1:31:02] us rejoice but one day when our flesh
[1:31:05] changes that word and he will become
[1:31:09] what we had never dreamed Possible Oh
[1:31:12] Lord hasten that day my It also says
[1:31:16] here that he's going to give the
[1:31:18] Overcomer a white
[1:31:20] stone and in not on the stone
[1:31:24] a new name just makes me think of Junior
[1:31:27] Jackson's dream everybody familiar with
[1:31:28] Junior Jackson's
[1:31:30] dream he said brother branam got this
[1:31:33] this crowbar this this bar iron bar
[1:31:35] looking thing and it it happened and
[1:31:38] they were all looking at this pyramid
[1:31:39] this Stone and brother Bram came and
[1:31:41] cracked it open with this this this
[1:31:45] metal thing I can't help but think it
[1:31:47] wasn't a crowbar it was a sword a sword
[1:31:49] of the king allowed him to open that
[1:31:51] rock of Revelation and what did he do he
[1:31:54] told them look on this and what did he
[1:31:56] do he went out west and all of that is
[1:31:58] just so good it's it's wonderful because
[1:32:00] we can see that it's already fulfilled
[1:32:01] it's already happened but that white
[1:32:03] stone with with a name written in it not
[1:32:06] on it look on this brothers and sisters
[1:32:08] we need to become this word this is that
[1:32:11] stone that we need to look
[1:32:14] upon so
[1:32:16] beautiful my It also says here that he's
[1:32:19] going to give the Overcomer a white
[1:32:20] stone and in not on the Stone a new name
[1:32:26] I just can't help but think it's so
[1:32:27] beautiful it's not going to be
[1:32:30] whitewashed hey we're not going to be
[1:32:32] whitewashed we're not going to have our
[1:32:34] name on the outside not a badge to say
[1:32:36] that I believe the message of the hour
[1:32:38] I've got Jesus Christ the say yesterday
[1:32:40] say I got the Holy Ghost right here no
[1:32:42] it's going to be the life that's being
[1:32:44] lived because it's inside of
[1:32:46] us it's in the stone the new name which
[1:32:51] the owner alone knows that's why nobody
[1:32:54] can ever talk you out of it once you
[1:32:55] truly get saved once you truly become
[1:32:59] baptized with the Holy Ghost in your
[1:33:00] life nobody's ever going to talk you out
[1:33:03] of it doesn't matter nothing will come
[1:33:05] between you and that word ever amen
[1:33:08] doesn't mean there won't be trials there
[1:33:10] will be trials there will be
[1:33:12] tribulations but we'll always be able to
[1:33:14] come back to the word amen now the idea
[1:33:17] of a new name is familiar one Abram was
[1:33:20] changed to Abraham Sarai to Sarah
[1:33:24] Jacob to Israel Simon to Peter and Saul
[1:33:29] to Paul these names either brought about
[1:33:32] a change or were given because of a
[1:33:36] change it was only after Abram and Sarai
[1:33:41] had their names Changed by the Lord that
[1:33:44] they were made ready to receive the
[1:33:47] coming son in Jacob's case he had to
[1:33:50] overcome and then he was called a prince
[1:33:53] in the case of Simon and Saul when they
[1:33:57] had received the Lord their change came
[1:34:01] and today brothers and sisters
[1:34:05] today each one of us as true believers
[1:34:09] has had a change in name amen we are
[1:34:13] Christians and it's not the general
[1:34:15] Christians out there where we can say
[1:34:18] we're we're we're like the Catholic
[1:34:22] Universal no there's a lot of people
[1:34:24] that claim this claim but very few of
[1:34:27] them can stay with the word amen we are
[1:34:31] Christians it is a name common to all of
[1:34:34] us but one day we will have another
[1:34:36] change we will of a certainty receive a
[1:34:40] new name it could well be that name was
[1:34:44] our true and original name written in
[1:34:47] the Lamb's Book of Life from the
[1:34:49] foundation of the
[1:34:52] world he knows the name but we do not
[1:34:56] one day at his good pleasure we will
[1:35:00] also know yes we will know also a white
[1:35:03] stone how beautiful here is another
[1:35:06] picture of the saint receiving
[1:35:08] recompense for the hand of God for his
[1:35:11] trials upon the Earth you know after
[1:35:14] Constantine the false church was able to
[1:35:16] dip its hand into the State Treasury and
[1:35:18] thereby erect beautiful buildings full
[1:35:20] of lovely statuary these statues made of
[1:35:23] White marble were actually Roman Idols
[1:35:26] renamed as Saints the churches and their
[1:35:29] Furnishings were exceptionally beautiful
[1:35:31] even as one sees today but God was not
[1:35:35] with them if anybody has ever been to
[1:35:38] Rome the Vatican City if you stand in St
[1:35:41] Peter's Square on top of the the
[1:35:44] Basilica I think it's called there's
[1:35:46] statues of all of the Saints all around
[1:35:50] it's it's actually stunning how
[1:35:52] incredibly large it is the architecture
[1:35:55] is
[1:35:57] astounding but God's not there yes
[1:36:00] sir where was God he says he was with
[1:36:03] his Saints in some little home or in a
[1:36:07] cave or some wild mountain area where
[1:36:10] they hid from false church
[1:36:15] members they weren't hiding from the
[1:36:17] enemy government they weren't hiding
[1:36:20] from the
[1:36:21] military they were hiding from false
[1:36:23] church members you know I just this
[1:36:25] makes me think about brother bradam and
[1:36:27] and the story of thy house in Tipton
[1:36:30] Georgia and uh you know in that little
[1:36:33] house meeting just a few people they had
[1:36:35] a house recorder there and they were
[1:36:37] able to record it just could you imagine
[1:36:39] sitting around with a prophet and having
[1:36:41] him just having a church meeting in our
[1:36:43] house what he said to the people there I
[1:36:45] think is astounding he said you know the
[1:36:47] secret to my
[1:36:48] Ministry the secret to my Ministry is
[1:36:51] this when the angel came to me me and
[1:36:54] gave me my commission I believed
[1:36:57] them I just believed them and I can't
[1:37:00] help but think brothers and sisters when
[1:37:01] we listen to this message of the hour
[1:37:03] when we receive this message of the hour
[1:37:06] every single time there's something new
[1:37:07] we've heard it over and over we could
[1:37:09] listen to the same message over and over
[1:37:10] and always get something new out of it
[1:37:12] every single time that
[1:37:13] happens all we have to do is believe him
[1:37:17] that's all we just have to believe it
[1:37:19] and what happens is it changes us on the
[1:37:21] inside out my they did not have
[1:37:25] beautiful buildings gown choirs fine
[1:37:27] clothes and other worldly attractions
[1:37:30] but now in this special promise to the
[1:37:33] True Believers of all ages God has
[1:37:36] declared he will give them rewards of
[1:37:39] great Beauty and eternal duration amen
[1:37:43] he says let the wealthy look down on the
[1:37:45] poor let them give large sums to the
[1:37:48] church that in turn might honor the
[1:37:52] donor by by placing a marble plaque or
[1:37:55] some statuary in their honor on public
[1:37:59] display that all may
[1:38:02] applaud I was just thinking about this
[1:38:04] the other day actually this very thing
[1:38:06] not in the church but outside where you
[1:38:10] see in memory of and and so and so and
[1:38:13] you see a name on a park bench and and I
[1:38:15] think my is that as far as it goes where
[1:38:19] people give their money and and they
[1:38:21] just have a plaque in their name
[1:38:24] how
[1:38:25] sad he goes on to say someday the God
[1:38:28] who sees and knows all will once more
[1:38:32] commend the Widow for giving her all
[1:38:36] though it be but two mites and he
[1:38:39] himself will reward with the treasures
[1:38:41] of Heaven yes hidden mana and a new name
[1:38:45] in a white
[1:38:47] stone how good is the Lord to us to
[1:38:51] reward us so wonderfully am amen and we
[1:38:54] so
[1:38:55] undeserving oh I want to be ready at all
[1:38:58] times to do his will and to lay up
[1:39:01] Treasures in Heaven amen God bless you
[1:39:04] tonight I'll call the
[1:39:07] musicians next Wednesday we'll begin the
[1:39:10] tharan
[1:39:11] age it's the longest
[1:39:14] age 1606 to
[1:39:17] 1520 and I think it's one of the most
[1:39:20] fascinating ages the stories in here
[1:39:23] that brother Bram talks about are uh
[1:39:27] amazing you know the other interesting
[1:39:29] thing is even though it's the longest of
[1:39:32] Ages it's not as many pages as the
[1:39:35] pergan church age it's actually quite
[1:39:38] small in comparison
[1:39:40] to before we go into maybe stand with me
[1:39:43] as we close tonight before we go into uh
[1:39:46] the next Church age I just I just want
[1:39:49] to read this for those people who maybe
[1:39:52] don't know um haven't heard it sometimes
[1:39:55] it's good just to have a refresher amen
[1:39:57] but the purpose of this message of the
[1:40:00] hour through the lens of the Prophet his
[1:40:03] words to the church at the very end of
[1:40:06] the seven Church ages this is in the
[1:40:09] resume of the ages it's the last three
[1:40:11] paragraphs of the book he says so we
[1:40:13] conclude the seven Church ages saying
[1:40:16] only what the spirit said to each age he
[1:40:20] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:40:23] Spirit saith to the
[1:40:25] churches I sincerely believe that the
[1:40:27] spirit of God has been speaking to us
[1:40:30] not only in teaching us truths of the
[1:40:32] ages but he has been Faithfully dealing
[1:40:35] with hearts that they may turn to him
[1:40:39] that is the reason for all preaching and
[1:40:42] teaching for it is the preaching and
[1:40:45] teaching of the word that the sheep hear
[1:40:47] the voice of God and follow him now
[1:40:51] brother Bram he says in adoption that
[1:40:55] preaching saves people and teaching
[1:40:59] positionally places them we have to
[1:41:02] learn these things and that's why we're
[1:41:04] going through this book word by word
[1:41:07] paragraph 75 says not for one moment do
[1:41:09] I bring a message to the people that
[1:41:11] they may follow me or join my church or
[1:41:15] start some fellowship or organization I
[1:41:19] have never done that and will not do
[1:41:21] that now
[1:41:23] but we can all look around and saywell
[1:41:25] there's a lot of people that have done
[1:41:27] that that's not what he was
[1:41:29] intending there's a lot of people that
[1:41:31] have a lot of horror stories terrible
[1:41:34] things that they would say is related to
[1:41:36] this message of the hour but that's not
[1:41:38] what this Prophet actually intended
[1:41:41] that's not what he was promoting other
[1:41:43] people took it and promoted their own
[1:41:47] agendas not for one moment do I bring a
[1:41:49] message to the people that they may
[1:41:51] follow me join my church or start some
[1:41:54] fellowship an organization I've never
[1:41:56] done
[1:41:58] that and will not do that now I have no
[1:42:01] interest in those things but I do have
[1:42:03] an interest in the things of God and
[1:42:05] people amen and if I can accomplish just
[1:42:08] one thing I will be
[1:42:11] satisfied that one
[1:42:14] thing is to see established a true
[1:42:17] spiritual relationship between God and
[1:42:19] Men yes wherein men become New Creation
[1:42:23] in Christ filled with his spirit and
[1:42:26] live according to his word I would
[1:42:28] invite plead and warn all to hear his
[1:42:30] voice at this time and yield your lives
[1:42:34] completely to him even as I trust in my
[1:42:37] heart that I have given my all to him
[1:42:40] may God bless you and may his coming
[1:42:43] Rejoice amen your heart let's just bow
