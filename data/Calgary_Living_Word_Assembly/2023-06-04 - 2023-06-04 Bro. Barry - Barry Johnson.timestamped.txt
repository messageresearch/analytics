[25:19] good morning Lord bless you all
[25:24] just felt led to
[25:26] read another poem to you today
[25:30] it's kind of interesting because I've
[25:31] never written a poem in my life
[25:35] never even enjoyed poetry
[25:38] but two weeks ago I was driving in my
[25:41] vehicle
[25:43] and these words came to me and over the
[25:45] last two weeks the to help the Holy
[25:47] Ghost I've kind of added to it and honed
[25:51] it so
[25:52] I strongly believe that someone's meant
[25:54] to hear this today
[25:56] the title of the poem is spiritual
[25:58] maturity
[26:01] once we knew in part
[26:04] our vision incomplete
[26:07] our prophecies mere Shadows at our feet
[26:11] with passion our Prophet implored
[26:15] this beautiful Truth for us to explore
[26:20] oh don't be children be women and men
[26:24] the End Road is here
[26:26] let faith in you transcend transcend
[26:30] a little greenness left to bake
[26:35] he's waited for fruit on the branch to
[26:38] take
[26:40] with a heart full of compassion
[26:43] he encouraged us so
[26:46] seek God's face and let wisdom flow
[26:50] the time has come
[26:52] to own our place
[26:55] true love Faith and God's divine grace
[26:59] the perfect one has come
[27:02] he's arrived
[27:03] Shining Light so clear
[27:06] no longer in part we truly see and hear
[27:11] as a child we thought and acted like a
[27:15] child might
[27:16] but the matured
[27:18] are promised to be led by the mind of
[27:21] Christ
[27:23] with heart mind
[27:26] and speech all aligned
[27:30] choosing to live by God's truth each
[27:33] time
[27:35] once we saw through a mirror dark and
[27:37] unclear
[27:39] the world's turmoil often caused our
[27:42] hearts to fear
[27:44] but now we see him face to face
[27:47] by loves Eternal embrace our chosen
[27:51] place
[27:53] with the true anointing of his spirit
[27:56] we are renewed
[27:58] it's God's power
[28:00] it transfigures and imbues
[28:03] with all authority to discern to love
[28:07] and to serve
[28:09] his great name we abide and are
[28:12] preserved
[28:14] the anointing from above did descend
[28:17] guiding us always our true purpose to
[28:21] defend
[28:22] through great storms and trials we often
[28:26] tripped and squirmed
[28:28] but by his Loving Care
[28:30] we found the strength to stand firm
[28:34] for in his mighty name
[28:37] we did overcome
[28:39] because our Victory he hath already won
[28:44] his election persevered
[28:47] and will never fail
[28:49] it's the guide pulse that keeps you and
[28:52] I from drifting off the trail
[28:56] Our Hope and Faith have endured but it's
[28:59] his love his most precious and pure
[29:03] the anointing we received anchors Within
[29:06] a teacher of Truth free from all sin
[29:11] no need for man's teachings God's word
[29:14] is true
[29:15] simply abide in him and he will abide in

[47:41] be in his presence once again
[47:43] we just have a few prayer requests we'd
[47:45] like to bring before the the Lord this
[47:47] morning starting with the praise report
[47:50] I'm sure that anyone who is a part of
[47:53] the chat of the local assembly here saw
[47:55] this morning about brother Frank
[47:57] Cronkite
[48:00] we need to give him praise
[48:03] as much as we give him requests
[48:15] to go from a terrible prognosis by the
[48:19] doctors
[48:21] to something that they can work with
[48:24] we'll just trust that that report
[48:26] continues to change
[48:28] when they go to do the examination again
[48:31] we certainly want to thank everyone for
[48:34] your prayers I know on behalf of the
[48:36] Cronkite family and the Hoffer family
[48:39] thankful for the prayers and I've had
[48:42] the opportunity to talk to brother Frank
[48:44] and he has said thank you for the
[48:46] prayers
[48:47] and he's just in a good spirit
[48:50] it's a tremendous thing to see I just
[48:53] want to continue to thank the Lord for
[48:54] touching brother Frank and the Cronkite
[48:57] family
[48:58] I just want to remember sister Sharon
[49:00] Rose who was traveling in Nigeria now
[49:02] the clawsons who are traveling in
[49:05] Saskatchewan
[49:06] certainly thankful for Sister Mary
[49:09] Jeanette coming home
[49:13] she uh
[49:15] went to visit family and to visit
[49:18] friends
[49:19] believers
[49:21] her people and she just had a wonderful
[49:23] time
[49:25] so we're certainly excited to hear their
[49:27] good reports from her
[49:29] we just like to remember brother sister
[49:32] Sharon and Brother Sam Brennan they're
[49:34] not feeling well this morning brother
[49:35] Andrew Claussen is not feeling well
[49:39] the livesies are not feeling well
[49:42] we had a request from Sister Naomi
[49:45] neighbor for her grandfather for the
[49:48] James Mayfield who has felt led to
[49:50] travel to Burma Myanmar which is uh
[49:54] basically turned upside down now with
[49:57] war and civil one rest so we certainly
[50:00] want to make sure we are in the perfect
[50:01] will of the Lord when we put ourselves
[50:03] in a position like that
[50:06] sister Naomi's request was that the Lord
[50:08] would just bring her Grandpa home safely
[50:11] if you have a need this morning maybe
[50:12] just make it known unto him with an
[50:14] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer
[50:16] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus one
[50:19] more time
[50:20] we know that your ear is open to our
[50:22] prayers
[50:23] father we never want to treat you like a
[50:26] vending machine where we put our tithe
[50:29] in the plate and we expect a result
[50:32] father we thank you for your word and
[50:35] your word simply says that if we would
[50:37] just try you in these things that you
[50:39] would rebuke the Devourer for our sakes
[50:42] father and we know that that goes well
[50:44] beyond a financial blessing Lord Jesus
[50:47] we thank you for your word we thank you
[50:49] for the understanding that we can just
[50:52] follow your word according to the way
[50:54] that you have given it to us father Lord
[50:57] we know that it's evolved and it's been
[50:59] handed down through the centuries and
[51:00] many times the devil would like to put
[51:03] it in people's minds that somehow
[51:05] there's a deluded word that we can't
[51:07] trust or we can't believe but we know
[51:10] that you sent a prophet in our day and
[51:12] we know that you only speak to men
[51:14] through prophets Lord and we just accept
[51:16] that word that you sent through the
[51:18] prophet saying that you just need to
[51:21] take your word the way that you have
[51:23] given it to us and we thank you for that
[51:25] word because it's a perfect word and
[51:27] it's an unveiled word Lord there's no
[51:28] more mystery to it father this morning
[51:31] we thank you for your goodness to every
[51:32] one of us Lord thank you for the many
[51:34] needs in our lives Lord because without
[51:37] them we would not know the attributes

[51:44] our every need we know that you are our
[51:46] Banner that you are our comfort that you

[51:55] that you are a friend that sticketh
[51:57] closer than a brother Lord Jesus father

[52:03] morning we just asked that you would
[52:04] Lord just sovereignly meet the need that
[52:07] was made known unto you this morning by
[52:09] each and every uplift hand father we
[52:12] know that we all have things in our
[52:14] lives that we're trying to understand
[52:16] and work through and go through father
[52:19] and we pray that you would just help us
[52:21] through them because you never said that
[52:22] you would take us away from the trial
[52:24] that you would take the trial away from
[52:26] us that you said you would make a way
[52:28] through the trial and father through
[52:30] that trial you would make a way of
[52:31] Escape for us father and Lord we thank
[52:34] you for that promise Lord
[52:36] so we just thank you for meeting each
[52:38] and every need this morning Lord father
[52:40] we pray for brother James Mayfield this
[52:42] morning Lord we know he has family here
[52:44] that loves him Lord Jesus and we just
[52:46] ask that you would watch over our
[52:48] brother Lord that he would just be in
[52:49] your perfect will father from the
[52:51] beginning to the end of his trip Lord
[52:53] Jesus father that there would just be
[52:55] testimonies of his journey father of
[52:58] your goodness to him and to the people
[53:00] around him and father according to
[53:01] Sister Naomi's request father that you
[53:04] would bring her Grandpa home safely at
[53:06] the appointed time
[53:08] father we just want to continue to ask
[53:10] father for those who are traveling now
[53:12] sister Sharon Rose Lord that you would
[53:14] be with her in Nigeria that you would
[53:16] bring her home safely father at the
[53:19] appointed time we pray for the clausons
[53:20] who are in Saskatoon Lord that you would
[53:22] watch over them and bring them home
[53:24] safely at the appointed time
[53:26] father we know that there's many people
[53:27] that are ill now in the congregation
[53:30] father brother Aiden and sister Michelle
[53:32] Lord we pray that you would just touch
[53:34] them Father we just rebuke that Spirit
[53:37] of covet in the name of Jesus Christ and
[53:40] father we just thank you for raising
[53:42] them up according to your word according
[53:44] to the promise in your word father we
[53:46] pray that you would watch over the
[53:47] children father that they would not have
[53:49] anything to do with it that it just
[53:51] wouldn't touch them Father Lord Jesus we
[53:54] pray that you would just be with brother
[53:55] Andrew father we pray that we could just
[53:57] rebuke that that Spirit of gout in the
[54:00] name of Jesus Christ father Lord that he
[54:02] could just raise up and be free from
[54:04] that Lord once and for all that it would
[54:07] not Badger him and and drag him down but
[54:09] father we know that that's the position
[54:12] of Satan is below our feet father and we
[54:14] know that he's trying to mess with
[54:16] brother Andrew's walk and we just rebuke
[54:18] that devil in the name of Jesus Christ
[54:21] father we just love you and we thank you
[54:23] today we pray that you would just be
[54:25] with sister Sharon and Brother Sam
[54:27] Brennan father no doubt they would
[54:29] probably prefer to be here today than
[54:31] not feeling well but Lord we know that
[54:34] you know every situation and we pray
[54:36] that you would just touch their bodies
[54:37] also Father Lord that you would raise
[54:40] them up so they could be healthy again
[54:43] according to your will
[54:45] we just love you and we thank you today
[54:47] Father Lord we just ask that you would
[54:49] be glorified now in all that's said and
[54:51] done as we go forwards with this service
[54:53] father from the beginning to the end we
[54:55] pray that you would be glorified in all
[54:57] that said and done father we just love
[54:59] you and we thank you and we ask all of
[55:02] these things now in Jesus Christ's name
[55:04] we pray amen amen
[55:07] thank you musicians
[55:11] certainly thankful to be here today if
[55:13] you have your Bibles I'd like to
[55:16] continue on sort of with what we were
[55:19] talking about the last couple of weeks
[55:21] in sort of uh
[55:24] uh maybe just turn to Matthew 14 while I
[55:27] talk I apologize
[55:31] Matthew 14.
[55:33] we'll start with verse 22.
[55:40] we were talking about the believer's
[55:42] position in Christ and uh I just maybe
[55:45] have gone on a little bit of a tangent
[55:47] but I believe it's the leadership of the
[55:48] Lord and I'm certainly thankful for it
[55:50] and I've learned enough to know that we
[55:52] just have to follow it when it happens
[55:55] so we'll just start with Matthew chapter
[55:58] 14.
[56:01] start with verse 21.
[56:04] this is ending with the story
[56:07] of the feeding of the five thousand of
[56:10] the bread and and the fish and we're all
[56:13] familiar with that story and they took
[56:16] up 12 baskets full afterwards
[56:19] verse 21 says and they had they that had
[56:22] eaten were about five thousand men
[56:24] beside women and children
[56:27] so who knows how many people that really
[56:29] was that was a lot of people
[56:31] they still had 12 baskets full one for
[56:34] each disciple
[56:36] verse 22 and straightway Jesus
[56:38] constrained his disciples to get into a
[56:41] ship and to go before him unto the other
[56:44] side while he sent the multitudes away
[56:48] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[56:51] he went up into a mountain apart to pray
[56:54] and when the evening was come he was
[56:57] there alone
[56:58] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[57:01] sea tossed with waves for the wind was
[57:03] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the
[57:06] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[57:10] the sea
[57:11] and when the disciples saw him walking
[57:13] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[57:18] is a spirit and they cried out for fear
[57:21] but straightway Jesus spake unto them
[57:24] saying
[57:25] be of good cheer
[57:27] it is I
[57:29] be not afraid
[57:31] let's just bow one more time
[57:36] gracious Heavenly Father Lord sometimes
[57:38] when we read your word just
[57:41] strikes our souls father
[57:44] and this morning one more time I pray
[57:46] that as we approach you father that we
[57:49] wouldn't do it
[57:50] lightly
[57:51] father that we would do it with
[57:53] reverence in our hearts that we would
[57:55] recognize who we've invited to be in our
[57:58] service today
[58:00] and Lord just like that story that we
[58:03] read some time ago father about Simon
[58:06] the the
[58:07] Pharisee father let us not be like him
[58:10] Lord Jesus but let us meet you and greet
[58:14] you with a kiss father let us wash your
[58:17] feet Lord Jesus let us recognize your
[58:21] presence and appreciate you in our midst
[58:23] today father as you speak to us along
[58:25] the way Lord we just ask that we could
[58:28] take this word that was spoken father
[58:30] and just allow you to break it open to
[58:33] us fresh like a fresh loaf of bread Lord
[58:36] Jesus father that it would just feed our
[58:39] souls one more time we just love you and
[58:42] we thank you for your goodness to us
[58:44] thank you for this word Lord we just ask
[58:47] all these things now in Jesus Christ's
[58:49] name we pray amen
[58:51] God bless you this morning you may be
[58:53] seated
[58:57] I just
[58:59] think it's so wonderful
[59:02] the words that Jesus spoke to the
[59:05] disciples in that moment when they were
[59:07] sore afraid they were dealing with the
[59:10] spirit they were so afraid of the storm
[59:12] that was happening all around them they
[59:15] were so afraid all together if it wasn't
[59:18] the storm it was the spirit and what was
[59:22] the first words that Jesus said
[59:24] is just simply be not afraid
[59:29] be of good cheer
[59:31] it is I
[59:34] if we could just recognize that when
[59:36] we're in the midst of the storm brothers
[59:37] and sisters there's so much to all of
[59:40] this I I I know there's so much to
[59:42] unpack I don't know if we'll get into it
[59:44] today but the very next part of this
[59:46] maybe we'll get into a little bit later
[59:47] is when Peter he said hey if that's you
[59:50] Lord then then bid me to come unto you
[59:52] let me do what you're doing and we know
[59:55] that he actually did
[59:57] but like I said we're not going to go
[59:58] too far into that we just have a few
[1:00:00] announcements we're already into June
[1:00:02] everybody knows that it's just amazing
[1:00:04] to think that it's just time just flies
[1:00:07] and uh
[1:00:08] we have brother Dale Smith will be here
[1:00:10] this Wednesday to take the service
[1:00:13] I would like to apologize it was brought
[1:00:15] to my attention that some of the folks
[1:00:17] here did not receive ballots to vote on
[1:00:21] the church offices because we did it
[1:00:23] virtually
[1:00:25] um I definitely apologize for that I
[1:00:27] don't know what happened but I just
[1:00:29] would like to let everyone know that the
[1:00:32] results that came in were unanimous it
[1:00:35] was 100 except for one person and some
[1:00:38] one person voted no and and I don't know
[1:00:41] what that means or or where it's at and
[1:00:44] I don't think it's relevant to say who
[1:00:45] it is so I'm not going to but I just
[1:00:48] wanted to let you know the lowest score
[1:00:49] was 99 percent so a couple of ballots
[1:00:54] um I don't know if it would change much
[1:00:55] but I certainly do apologize for that
[1:00:58] and moving forwards hopefully we can
[1:01:00] iron out these wrinkles and uh and make
[1:01:03] it easier for everyone
[1:01:06] um
[1:01:07] on the 11th we're going to be away that
[1:01:10] will be next weekend we're going to
[1:01:11] Saskatoon and brother Gilbert has agreed
[1:01:14] to take the service on Sunday
[1:01:16] and uh so he'll be ministering at home I
[1:01:19] I certainly would like to thank the
[1:01:21] Brethren here in the local assembly for
[1:01:24] their willingness to put their shoulder
[1:01:25] to the wheel and to minister I was just
[1:01:28] meditating on this to know that as
[1:01:30] brother Mervin took the service on
[1:01:32] Wednesday and you know the brother said
[1:01:34] that you know we're not pulling one way
[1:01:36] and the other we're all pushing together
[1:01:39] for the same goal and and that means a
[1:01:42] lot that means a lot I think to everyone
[1:01:45] but it means a lot to me personally to
[1:01:47] know that we can go away and we don't
[1:01:50] have to wonder it's not a nail biter
[1:01:52] wondering what what's going to be said
[1:01:53] or what we're going to have to deal with
[1:01:55] when we come home and most of all the
[1:01:58] most important thing is that the Sheep
[1:02:00] get fed that the Believers get a meal
[1:02:03] and and that's the critical factor with
[1:02:06] all of this and and I just want to take
[1:02:07] a moment here and just just offer a
[1:02:10] bouquet to each minister in the
[1:02:12] congregation here for your efforts thank
[1:02:14] you
[1:02:15] [Applause]
[1:02:21] we know the only reason that we can have
[1:02:23] success to come and stand behind the
[1:02:25] sacred desk is surrender our willingness
[1:02:28] to put aside our thoughts and to put
[1:02:30] aside our ideas and try and find the
[1:02:32] mind of the Lord just for a few moments
[1:02:35] to try and maybe bring something that
[1:02:37] would bless the congregation and it's
[1:02:39] not easy to do so God bless you
[1:02:42] I just wanted to mention we have a
[1:02:44] prayer meeting uh coming up on the 15th
[1:02:46] at 7 30 that'll be Thursday the 15th we
[1:02:49] have a youth event on the 16th that's
[1:02:51] going to be at our house and this month
[1:02:53] we will not have a communion service but
[1:02:55] we will have a worship service on the
[1:02:57] 25th at 6 PM that will be an evening
[1:03:00] Sunday evening service so I trust that
[1:03:03] everyone will uh maybe practice a
[1:03:06] special or if you've got a song in your
[1:03:08] heart that you'd like to sing or maybe a
[1:03:10] poem that you would like to read it's
[1:03:12] certainly an appropriate time just to
[1:03:13] get together and let our hair down so to
[1:03:16] speak and just Worship the Lord just
[1:03:18] Express to him the joy that he has put
[1:03:20] in our hearts
[1:03:22] you happy this morning
[1:03:24] we have uh brother Danny del mundo
[1:03:27] family is coming and I understand
[1:03:29] they'll be here in July and we have
[1:03:31] brother Andrew Glover tentatively
[1:03:34] arranged for the 13th of August
[1:03:37] and uh for the James nuvanda Bandy all
[1:03:40] the way into September the 27th and I
[1:03:43] was looking at this and I was thinking
[1:03:44] boy this isn't going to be long and
[1:03:47] we'll be having brother James nouveanda
[1:03:48] Bandy here at the end of September it's
[1:03:51] amazing how this goes
[1:03:53] I was uh I was awake very very early
[1:03:56] this morning and I was quite surprised
[1:03:58] actually at how early it starts to get
[1:04:01] light we're almost at the uh I guess the
[1:04:04] summer equinox it'll be June 21st the
[1:04:08] longest day of the year and uh yeah it
[1:04:12] gets light pretty early now and it's
[1:04:15] funny because it'll just change just
[1:04:16] like that and it'll start getting darker
[1:04:18] and darker and let's just enjoy the
[1:04:20] sunshine while we have it
[1:04:24] last week we talked about uh
[1:04:27] Mount Transfiguration
[1:04:29] I just want to do a little recap on that
[1:04:31] because I think it plays into uh sort of
[1:04:34] what we're talking about here today the
[1:04:37] scripture in Matthew chapter 14 and we
[1:04:40] know that Jesus he took Peter James and
[1:04:44] John up to a mountain apart and we know
[1:04:48] that he was transfigured before them
[1:04:50] we're not going to go and read the
[1:04:51] scripture this morning I'll just do a
[1:04:53] quick fast recap and we know that Jesus
[1:04:55] was transfigured before them and that's
[1:04:58] what the word says He was transfigured
[1:05:00] and the Miriam Webster dictionary says
[1:05:02] to give a new and typically exalted or
[1:05:05] spiritual appearance to
[1:05:07] excuse me transform outwardly and
[1:05:09] usually for the better
[1:05:11] Strong's
[1:05:13] g339 is metamorph foe I'm probably not
[1:05:16] saying that right but that's what it
[1:05:18] looks like and it's to transform
[1:05:19] literally or figuratively metamorphose
[1:05:23] and that is changing transforming and we
[1:05:28] know that we live in a world right now
[1:05:30] where we have a tremendous movement
[1:05:33] afoot
[1:05:35] in the world for people wanting to
[1:05:38] transform their bodies they want to
[1:05:41] transform their genders some people
[1:05:44] don't even want to change their bodies
[1:05:45] they just want to change their genders
[1:05:46] they want to transform into whatever
[1:05:49] they feel fits in the moment I'm not
[1:05:52] going to dwell on this too much but I
[1:05:54] think it's very important because it's a
[1:05:55] relevant topic to the day in which we
[1:05:57] live because it's an impersonation of
[1:06:00] the truth there is going to be a
[1:06:02] transformation of bodies on this Earth
[1:06:05] and it's going to be according to the
[1:06:07] word of God in the moment in the
[1:06:08] twinkling of an eye there is going to be
[1:06:11] a brand new body that we step into
[1:06:13] brothers and sisters and there's a
[1:06:15] reason why these people are doing this
[1:06:16] they don't understand it but they're
[1:06:18] doing it anyways it's because of the
[1:06:20] anointing on the age
[1:06:22] and it's no wonder that they're talking
[1:06:25] we talked about this as well there's no
[1:06:27] wonder that they have this idea that
[1:06:30] they need to be called I or or we and
[1:06:33] them and they the the pronouns the the
[1:06:36] personal pronouns are plural personal
[1:06:39] pronouns they're not singular pronouns
[1:06:42] and if you just you know bear with me as
[1:06:44] I go over this remember that we're
[1:06:46] talking about it is I it's not we and
[1:06:50] it's not they it's I and we know that
[1:06:53] when Moses he was looking at the burning
[1:06:55] bush he said I'm going to read the
[1:06:56] scripture a little bit later but he said
[1:06:58] who should I say sent me
[1:07:00] who is it that I'm talking to and he
[1:07:03] told them I'm the god of of your fathers
[1:07:05] of of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and and
[1:07:09] and he said yeah that's that's who I am
[1:07:11] but I want you to tell them not that I'm
[1:07:13] the god of them I want you to tell them
[1:07:15] that I am sent you
[1:07:18] not we or they or I was or I will be but
[1:07:22] I am the present tense singular personal
[1:07:26] pronoun
[1:07:28] and I think that's just an exact
[1:07:30] duplication here we are dealing with
[1:07:32] another counterfeit it's not just the
[1:07:34] trans movement it's the ideology of a
[1:07:37] plurality of spirits and it's okay to
[1:07:40] say that we have a multiplicity of
[1:07:42] personalities in people why do they want
[1:07:45] to be called we and they
[1:07:47] why is that
[1:07:49] what has that got to do with a single
[1:07:51] person
[1:07:52] it's so they can hide they can maybe
[1:07:54] just be whatever they want to be there's
[1:07:57] more than one there right we talked
[1:07:59] about this last week
[1:08:01] if we don't actually get the Holy Ghost
[1:08:02] In Our Lives brothers and sisters we've
[1:08:04] got one of two options get the Holy
[1:08:06] Ghost in our lives and be sealed wasn't
[1:08:08] that such a good description brother
[1:08:09] Mervin
[1:08:10] so beautiful on Wednesday to be filled
[1:08:13] and sealed means he took for those
[1:08:16] people weren't here he took and did it a
[1:08:18] couple times I thought for sure that he
[1:08:20] had break the can he took cans of pop
[1:08:21] one empty that was empty used and he
[1:08:26] stepped on it and it just crashed
[1:08:27] immediately aluminum can just munch but
[1:08:30] he took a full one that was filled and
[1:08:32] sealed and he stood on it and raised up
[1:08:35] on it see how strong it is when you're
[1:08:38] full and and sealed if we're not filled
[1:08:40] with the Holy Ghost and sealed brothers
[1:08:42] and sisters we're going to be crushed
[1:08:43] under the weight of this world under the
[1:08:45] plurality of the spirits that want to
[1:08:47] change our pronouns or or the gender of
[1:08:51] of our bodies
[1:08:53] but it's because we're dealing with the
[1:08:55] plurality of spirits and we talked about
[1:08:56] this out of Matthew chapter 12 verse 43
[1:08:58] when the unclean Spirit has gone out of
[1:09:00] a man he walked a few dry places seeking
[1:09:02] rest and findeth none you know many many
[1:09:05] times until we come to that place of
[1:09:08] recognizing that we're Justified
[1:09:10] Sanctified and and take that that pause
[1:09:13] that rest where we need to just wait
[1:09:15] until we know that the the the the
[1:09:18] disciples they were instructed by Jesus
[1:09:20] to go and tarry and wait in Jerusalem
[1:09:23] until
[1:09:24] you're endured with power from on high
[1:09:26] we have got to do the very same thing we
[1:09:28] have to have our own Opera room
[1:09:29] experience but there Comes A Time In Our
[1:09:32] Lives before that where we have to be
[1:09:33] justified we have to recognize that he
[1:09:36] has Justified us and that gives us the
[1:09:37] ability to be Sanctified but the brown
[1:09:39] talks about it like a a glass in a
[1:09:41] chicken yard and how a glass can be just
[1:09:44] left maybe a coffee mug or a clear glass
[1:09:46] can be just left in a chicken yard with
[1:09:48] all the manure and the dirt and the
[1:09:50] worms and the food bits and the the
[1:09:53] justification is recognizing that that
[1:09:55] that cup belongs to me and and taking
[1:09:58] that cup and picking it up and saying I
[1:10:00] own this cup this cup is mine and nobody
[1:10:03] can do anything with it but it still
[1:10:04] needs to be cleaned and then it's the
[1:10:06] sanctification or the sanitization is
[1:10:09] the way that I remembered it sometimes
[1:10:11] you'll maybe run it under hot water
[1:10:12] maybe you'll put it through a Boiling
[1:10:13] Pot maybe you'll put it into a fire
[1:10:15] depending on what kind of a cup it is
[1:10:17] but it gets cleaned out and it gets
[1:10:19] sterilized that's the sanctification but
[1:10:21] what good is it if it doesn't get filled
[1:10:25] it's got to be filled
[1:10:27] sometimes in that process of
[1:10:29] sanctification there's things that have
[1:10:31] to go right and when we're dealing with
[1:10:34] human beings sometimes those things that
[1:10:36] gotta go are spirits and I'll say this
[1:10:38] brothers and sisters myself I'm a living
[1:10:40] witness I had spirits that had to go
[1:10:44] some people would say oh that's not not
[1:10:46] possible but it is possible I'll tell
[1:10:48] you I battled with spirits and you know
[1:10:50] brothers and sisters even as Believers
[1:10:52] in the word of God once you get the Holy
[1:10:54] Ghost we know this you're you're not
[1:10:55] exempt from trials and the trials that
[1:10:58] we get are spirits they're going to come
[1:10:59] around they're Devils they're tormentors
[1:11:01] to torment us to shake us down to prove
[1:11:04] who we are but sometimes we've got to be
[1:11:06] Sanctified we got to get those Spirits
[1:11:08] out and once they're out you got to get
[1:11:11] sealed
[1:11:12] and if you don't get sealed here we have
[1:11:15] this scripture here Matthew 12 when an
[1:11:17] unclean Spirit has gone out of a man you
[1:11:19] walk a few dry places seeking rest and
[1:11:21] findeth none the spirits get taken out
[1:11:25] then he saith the spirit then he saith I
[1:11:30] will return into my house from Once I
[1:11:31] came out and when he has come he findeth
[1:11:34] it empty swept and garnished
[1:11:38] it's a it's a perfectly furnished flat
[1:11:40] it's all ready to go with all of his
[1:11:43] favorite things
[1:11:45] all of his favorite foods maybe
[1:11:48] everything that he enjoys it's a place
[1:11:50] of rest for him to enter into that body
[1:11:52] once again
[1:11:53] if you don't have a seal upon that door
[1:11:56] and we know that there was a type given
[1:11:58] in to the children of Israel and and I
[1:12:01] think it's the book of Exodus and that
[1:12:03] was the the Passover Lamb they had to
[1:12:05] take and and apply that blood to the the
[1:12:07] lintel and the doorpost and unless they
[1:12:09] did that the death angel would pass over
[1:12:11] and they would actually see a death
[1:12:15] the firstborn would die
[1:12:17] but the spirit then he saith I will
[1:12:19] return into my house from Once I came
[1:12:21] out and when he has come out he findeth
[1:12:22] it empty swept and garnished then go
[1:12:25] with he and taketh with him seven other
[1:12:27] Spirits more wicked than himself hey
[1:12:30] boys we've got a we've got a party place
[1:12:32] let's get together and party
[1:12:34] and that's what happens
[1:12:37] if we're not careful
[1:12:40] then go with he and taketh with him
[1:12:42] seven other Spirits more wicked than
[1:12:43] himself they enter in and dwell there
[1:12:45] and the last state of the man is worse
[1:12:47] than the first even so shall it be also
[1:12:50] unto this wicked generation
[1:12:52] and we know that we we talked about Mark
[1:12:54] chapter five I gotta stop laboring on
[1:12:56] this and and get going because we want
[1:12:58] to we want to go forwards here we don't
[1:13:00] want to just go backwards but Mark
[1:13:02] chapter five we know the story of Legion
[1:13:04] Jesus speaking and he asked him what is
[1:13:07] thy name and he answered saying my name
[1:13:09] is Legion for we are many we talked
[1:13:11] about this that it's a it's a Roman
[1:13:13] regiment and and typically the size was
[1:13:16] anywhere from 40 4500 to 5500 soldiers
[1:13:23] forty five hundred to fifty five hundred
[1:13:25] I would just I can't get over this to
[1:13:27] think I I don't know if I could contend
[1:13:29] with one devil knowing what I've
[1:13:31] experienced in my life and I'll say it
[1:13:33] with smoking or with alcohol those are
[1:13:35] devils
[1:13:36] and they were more than I could control
[1:13:39] could you imagine having a hundred or a
[1:13:42] thousand or five thousand
[1:13:44] no wonder this man couldn't be contained
[1:13:46] they couldn't contain Legion they
[1:13:49] couldn't bind them they put Fetters on
[1:13:50] him chains they couldn't bind him he
[1:13:53] wouldn't live with other human beings he
[1:13:55] lived like an animal in the caves
[1:13:58] but you know what it's a plurality of
[1:14:00] spirits and that's what causes people to
[1:14:02] behave the way they do you know I I
[1:14:04] remember hearing it years ago that once
[1:14:06] upon a time we we saw it in Kenya too I
[1:14:09] remember brother Gilbert pointing it out
[1:14:10] on the street when we're driving he said
[1:14:12] see that that's a Madman right there and
[1:14:14] he was disheveled he had raggedy clothes
[1:14:17] and his hair was crazy and you could
[1:14:19] tell he was just walking around and you
[1:14:21] know you don't have to look very far in
[1:14:23] the news now and you see people doing
[1:14:24] that now
[1:14:25] you see people doing that now and of
[1:14:27] course they're trying to hang it on the
[1:14:28] administration and all this stuff but I
[1:14:31] couldn't believe it there's people just
[1:14:32] standing there and they're just on the
[1:14:34] street and they're just
[1:14:36] like this and they're just standing
[1:14:38] there doing that that's what they're
[1:14:39] doing there's other people they're bent
[1:14:40] right over just like this just
[1:14:42] completely just that that's what they're
[1:14:44] doing that's their life they're just
[1:14:46] there I I don't know it's a plurality of
[1:14:49] spirits they're mad men
[1:14:51] but you know we can see the obvious ones
[1:14:53] the ones that are tricky are the ones
[1:14:55] that put on a two or three piece suit
[1:14:57] brothers and sisters and go and function
[1:14:59] in this world because that's what
[1:15:01] happens without the Seal of the Holy
[1:15:03] Ghost in our lives
[1:15:04] but there's no wonder we have this
[1:15:06] plurality of pronouns and in Modern
[1:15:09] English I looked it up and and I'll just
[1:15:10] read it again the personal pronoun
[1:15:12] pronouns officially include IU he she it
[1:15:16] we and then it goes into they them us
[1:15:18] him her his hers it's theirs
[1:15:23] are and your
[1:15:25] that's the world we live in
[1:15:28] but that's not the believer's position
[1:15:30] in Christ
[1:15:32] the believer's position in Christ has a
[1:15:34] perspective through the word and that
[1:15:36] perspective is to be not afraid of all
[1:15:39] of this even though we see perplexing
[1:15:41] times we see troubling times all around
[1:15:43] Be not Afraid even though the storm is
[1:15:45] happening Be not Afraid even though we
[1:15:48] see spirits all around us be not afraid
[1:15:50] because it is I when we read this word
[1:15:54] of God when we hear the message of the
[1:15:55] hour we don't need to be afraid brothers
[1:15:57] and sisters
[1:15:58] we don't have to worry about it I talked
[1:16:00] about this out of Exodus chapter 3 when
[1:16:02] now when Moses kept the flock of Jethro
[1:16:04] as father in the law father-in-law the
[1:16:07] priest of Midian and he led the flock to
[1:16:09] the back side of the desert and came to
[1:16:11] the Mountain of God even to Horeb and
[1:16:13] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[1:16:14] in a flame of fire out of the midst of a
[1:16:16] bush and he looked and behold the bush
[1:16:18] burned with fire and the Bush was not
[1:16:20] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[1:16:23] aside and see this great sight why this
[1:16:25] bush is not burned and we know brother
[1:16:28] Adam says very clearly that was a pillar
[1:16:29] of fire in that bush he met that Pillar
[1:16:32] of Fire
[1:16:33] and when the Lord saw that he turned
[1:16:35] aside to see God called unto him out of
[1:16:38] the midst of the Bush and said Moses and
[1:16:40] he said here am I
[1:16:44] I think it's just interesting I want to
[1:16:46] pause and dwell on this not us here we
[1:16:48] are it was just Moses
[1:16:51] right
[1:16:52] and he said draw not nigh hi hither put
[1:16:55] off thy shoes off of thy feet for the
[1:16:56] place wherein thou standest is Holy
[1:16:59] Ground moreover he said I am the god of
[1:17:02] thy father and of the god of Abraham the
[1:17:05] god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and
[1:17:07] Moses
[1:17:08] hit his face for he was afraid to look
[1:17:10] upon God and the Lord said I have surely
[1:17:14] seen the Affliction of my people which
[1:17:16] are on Egypt and have heard their Cry by
[1:17:18] reason of their task Masters for I know
[1:17:22] their sorrows
[1:17:23] he's not saying we and they
[1:17:27] and I am come down to deliver them out
[1:17:31] of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[1:17:33] bring them up out of that land into a
[1:17:36] good land and a large unto a land
[1:17:39] flowing with milk and honey unto the
[1:17:42] place of the Canaanites the Hittites the
[1:17:44] amorites and the parasites and the
[1:17:46] hivites and the jebusites
[1:17:49] verse 13 and Moses said unto God behold
[1:17:52] when I come unto the children of Israel
[1:17:54] and shall say unto them the god of your
[1:17:56] fathers hath sent me unto you and what
[1:17:59] and and they shall say to me what is his
[1:18:02] name
[1:18:03] what shall I say unto them he didn't say
[1:18:06] Jehovah
[1:18:07] he didn't say Jesus I said this already
[1:18:10] we know it and God said unto Moses I am
[1:18:13] that I am
[1:18:17] the present tense
[1:18:20] and he said thus shalt thou say
[1:18:22] unto the children of Israel I am
[1:18:25] hath sent me unto you
[1:18:29] brothers and sisters
[1:18:32] this is such a beautiful type of the
[1:18:34] scripture that we read this morning
[1:18:36] out of Matthew chapter 14 when when you
[1:18:40] recognize your position in Christ when
[1:18:42] you recognize that you're in the
[1:18:44] promised land with the Holy Ghost in
[1:18:46] your life that you're Justified you're
[1:18:47] Sanctified you're filled with the Holy
[1:18:49] Ghost you are in a land that's large and
[1:18:52] that's flowing with milk and honey
[1:18:54] you're in a land that is sweet you're in
[1:18:58] a land where all of the the troubles are
[1:19:01] are over if you can stay in your land we
[1:19:04] know the children of Israel they had
[1:19:05] that promise so long as they're in their
[1:19:06] land they'll be blessed but as soon as
[1:19:08] they step out of their land God can't
[1:19:10] bless them because the promise is in the
[1:19:12] Promised Land
[1:19:14] but they they came into a land that was
[1:19:17] full it was flowing with milk and honey
[1:19:19] it was safe for them and we have been
[1:19:23] given that ability in our day to have
[1:19:24] that in our lives in our homes as
[1:19:27] families I think it's so beautiful even
[1:19:29] in our church you know we're going to be
[1:19:32] in a land though
[1:19:33] just like the Bible said where there's
[1:19:35] the parasites and the hivites and the
[1:19:37] jebusites and we're going to contend
[1:19:39] with all of those brothers and sisters
[1:19:41] but it's not going to be naturally
[1:19:42] speaking at least it hasn't been
[1:19:45] who knows what it will be in the future
[1:19:47] as these Spirits the plurality of
[1:19:50] spirits begin to manifest in in people's
[1:19:52] lives you know what's interesting if you
[1:19:54] were to go and actually say that I'm a
[1:19:56] Christian to some of these people you'll
[1:19:58] have a fight on your hands
[1:20:00] you say I don't believe that I don't
[1:20:02] believe in any of that we could happen
[1:20:04] potentially have a fight on our hands
[1:20:06] with how aggressive some of these people
[1:20:09] behave
[1:20:10] but the Believers aren't doing that the
[1:20:12] Believers aren't aggressors we're not
[1:20:13] going out looking for a fight
[1:20:16] but you know even in the midst of all of
[1:20:17] it brothers and sisters this is where I
[1:20:19] want to get to today just be not afraid
[1:20:21] be not afraid for it is I and what is I
[1:20:25] I is you
[1:20:28] when you're in the midst of the storm
[1:20:29] brothers and sisters don't worry if you
[1:20:32] believe this word of God if you've been
[1:20:33] Justified if you've been Sanctified if
[1:20:35] you know that you've tarried in
[1:20:36] Jerusalem in your Promised Land if
[1:20:39] you've waited until you got that baptism
[1:20:41] of the Holy Ghost when when you get that
[1:20:43] brothers and sisters you don't got to
[1:20:45] worry because when that storm comes
[1:20:47] around just just just be quiet quiet
[1:20:50] yourself and look around and see if you
[1:20:52] can see Jesus because he is there he is
[1:20:55] the ever present help in time of trouble
[1:20:58] Be not Afraid brothers and sisters it is
[1:21:01] I
[1:21:03] you know I I just I've been studying
[1:21:05] this I've been looking at all of the
[1:21:07] messages if you type in it is I think
[1:21:09] there's about 12 of them that come up
[1:21:10] and and it's just amazing to hear
[1:21:13] Brother brownie takes this text in the
[1:21:14] out of Matthew chapter 14 he does a few
[1:21:17] uh different scriptures but mostly out
[1:21:19] of Matthew chapter 14 and and I just
[1:21:22] really got into it is I out of 1960 it's
[1:21:25] 11 24. brother banham says oh they were
[1:21:29] all convinced it must have been about
[1:21:31] that time it got dark and Satan saw them
[1:21:36] alone without him
[1:21:40] now that's just what the devil wants is
[1:21:43] to see The Church Without Christ
[1:21:46] he says I don't care what your name is
[1:21:49] how much your name's in Gold letters
[1:21:52] we are the holy church we are this he
[1:21:55] says it's not a holy church there's no
[1:21:59] such a thing as a holy church there's no
[1:22:02] such a thing as a holy mountain
[1:22:05] holy relics or even holy people
[1:22:09] he says it's the holy ghost in the
[1:22:11] people
[1:22:12] that makes the holy part
[1:22:15] and that's the Holy Spirit and outside
[1:22:17] of that brothers and sisters I would say
[1:22:20] this as a Believer outside of Heaven the
[1:22:22] Holy Ghost if we resist the Holy Ghost
[1:22:24] there's people see there's people that
[1:22:26] are on their journey I want to be real
[1:22:28] clear today as I talk about this there's
[1:22:30] people that are on their Journey they're
[1:22:31] in that justification they're in the
[1:22:33] sanctification stage and and they're
[1:22:35] tearing they're waiting for that gift of
[1:22:37] the Holy Ghost and and that's happening
[1:22:38] that's the promise God will do it in his
[1:22:41] time and you just need to stay firm stay
[1:22:44] in your position don't get get weary and
[1:22:46] well doing don't don't worry about
[1:22:48] trying to make it happen don't worry
[1:22:49] that it's not gonna happen just sit
[1:22:51] still and just let God do the work
[1:22:54] but then there's people that will go all
[1:22:56] the way up to sanctification and they'll
[1:22:58] resist the Holy Ghost in their lives and
[1:23:01] they will not go all the way and you
[1:23:03] know I want to say this clearly and and
[1:23:06] I'm just going to say it I think that's
[1:23:08] the most miserable place a human being
[1:23:10] could live is to get to the place where
[1:23:12] they're just about to receive the Holy
[1:23:14] Ghost but they resist it they won't go
[1:23:15] all the way and we've talked about it
[1:23:16] many times because there's a door and a
[1:23:19] door and they can go all the way up to
[1:23:20] that place but they've got one thing in
[1:23:22] their life that they just won't open
[1:23:23] that door to maybe it's a hurt maybe
[1:23:26] it's a fear maybe it's a resentment
[1:23:28] maybe someone's done something to them
[1:23:30] but you know what we don't have the
[1:23:32] option we've got to go all that way and
[1:23:34] just open all the doors Be not Afraid
[1:23:36] brothers and sisters it is I and if we
[1:23:39] can just allow that door to open he'll
[1:23:41] come in and sup with us
[1:23:46] we've got to be willing to do the work
[1:23:48] on our part
[1:23:50] but you know to be that Christian
[1:23:53] that goes all the way up right to the
[1:23:56] end and just won't take that step over
[1:23:58] the threshold just won't go beyond
[1:24:01] that's got to be the most miserable
[1:24:02] place to be
[1:24:04] how can you function in life because
[1:24:06] you're always going to be looking over
[1:24:07] your shoulder you're always going to
[1:24:08] know that you're you haven't gone all
[1:24:10] the way and it's only between you and
[1:24:12] God it's not between anybody else nobody
[1:24:14] will even know it
[1:24:18] you know just made me think when when I
[1:24:21] was looking up this quote
[1:24:22] how we can think that we have Jesus in
[1:24:24] our lives
[1:24:25] and not have them
[1:24:27] Mary and Joseph they thought they had
[1:24:29] Jesus with them didn't they
[1:24:32] and remember it was when that time
[1:24:34] happened that they went back three days
[1:24:36] journey
[1:24:37] so they actually lost six days and it
[1:24:39] was in that moment that Mary actually
[1:24:42] denied her own testimony
[1:24:45] where she said where you been your
[1:24:46] father and I have been worried about you
[1:24:48] and he said sitting in the temple where
[1:24:51] he's supposed to be don't you know woman
[1:24:53] that I'm about my father's business
[1:24:56] we can actually leave Jesus behind
[1:24:58] brothers and sisters and and not even
[1:25:00] know it brother Brandon preaches that
[1:25:02] and knoweth it not but you know what I
[1:25:04] just I don't want to say that we're
[1:25:05] doing that I just want to say Be not
[1:25:07] Afraid
[1:25:08] because it's I if we can just recognize
[1:25:10] Jesus and invite him inside our boat
[1:25:13] according to our story today we know
[1:25:15] that there's another story that the
[1:25:17] winds were boisterous and Jesus was in
[1:25:19] the boat he was already in the boat he
[1:25:20] was in the back of the boat and Satan
[1:25:22] saw that that they were all together and
[1:25:24] this time he was ringing his hands
[1:25:26] thinking hooray I can go and toss this
[1:25:28] boat and get rid of all of them all of
[1:25:30] my troublemakers all in one go but they
[1:25:33] got all upset and they didn't recognize
[1:25:34] who was in the back of the boat but then
[1:25:36] they finally cried out and woke him up
[1:25:38] if they would have just recognized you
[1:25:40] know what this storm has nothing to do
[1:25:42] with us because you don't know who's
[1:25:43] here this is the guy who created this
[1:25:46] world he created the wind he created the
[1:25:48] water he created this universe and
[1:25:51] unless he goes down we don't go down
[1:25:56] be not afraid it is I but they brought
[1:25:59] him in this message
[1:26:01] he says
[1:26:02] it is not the Acts of the Apostles
[1:26:05] these are maybe some quotes that we're
[1:26:07] very familiar with but I think it's just
[1:26:08] really important to have the
[1:26:10] conversation once in a while just to
[1:26:11] stir up our Pure Minds by way of
[1:26:13] remembrance brother Bradham says oh say
[1:26:15] oh he's a holy man he's not a holy man
[1:26:19] it's the holy ghost in the man
[1:26:21] I always kind of differed with the
[1:26:23] saying the Acts of the Apostles
[1:26:28] that isn't the Acts of the Apostles
[1:26:31] he says they were men
[1:26:33] it was Acts of the holy spirit in the
[1:26:36] apostles that brought forth the great
[1:26:38] victory
[1:26:41] wasn't the Acts of the Apostles
[1:26:44] I think it's so good to recognize this
[1:26:46] brothers and sisters if we've got
[1:26:48] anything good in our lives it's not the
[1:26:50] acts of brother Berry
[1:26:52] it's not the acts of brother or sister
[1:26:55] it's the acts of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:57] in US isn't it and isn't it wonderful
[1:27:00] just to give him the acknowledgment just
[1:27:02] to give him the credit just to say thank
[1:27:04] you Daddy thank you Lord that's all a
[1:27:06] parent ever really wants parents you
[1:27:08] know when they lend children money I
[1:27:10] probably shouldn't say this but
[1:27:11] typically parents will lend children
[1:27:12] money and you know they're really not
[1:27:14] too fussed about the money they want the
[1:27:15] child to learn the lesson but in the end
[1:27:17] of the day they just want to hear thank
[1:27:18] you they just want to have thanksgiven
[1:27:21] to them
[1:27:22] how much more the heavenly father that
[1:27:25] gives us everything brother Branham goes
[1:27:27] on to say here and when Satan's seen the
[1:27:31] little Church Without Christ
[1:27:33] then he said this is my opportunity
[1:27:36] and I'm sure we've all witnessed it
[1:27:37] before
[1:27:38] when things get a little upset in the
[1:27:40] church that's when Satan says oh there's
[1:27:42] my opportunity that's when I'm going to
[1:27:44] get in there that's what I'm going to
[1:27:45] try and mess things up you know we have
[1:27:48] that poster at the back brothers and
[1:27:49] sisters if you haven't seen it it's out
[1:27:51] of Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:27:52] don't don't think that we're all going
[1:27:54] to be one big happy Bunch all the time
[1:27:57] it's not a fairy tale here we're
[1:28:01] wrestling against flesh not against
[1:28:03] flesh and blood but against
[1:28:03] principalities and powers and that that
[1:28:06] word to the church it says that we need
[1:28:08] to draw closer together now more than
[1:28:11] ever we don't want to get clannished we
[1:28:13] don't want to have this group and that
[1:28:14] group and the other group inside the
[1:28:16] group as soon as we start to do that
[1:28:18] then Satan's going to get in there and
[1:28:19] start mixing things up and you know he
[1:28:22] even says in there that he'll send
[1:28:24] someone to come and sit down in the
[1:28:25] group maybe for years
[1:28:28] they'll sit down in the group and they
[1:28:30] will be a conduit
[1:28:31] for the devil to come in and inject some
[1:28:33] poison into that group of people and
[1:28:36] what will happen then they'll either get
[1:28:38] upset and leave or they'll get together
[1:28:40] with the body of Jesus Christ but the
[1:28:43] only thing that we can do as a body of
[1:28:44] Believers is draw that much closer
[1:28:46] together and when people want to step
[1:28:48] back and draw away we want to draw the
[1:28:50] circle bigger Spirit of Christ is to
[1:28:53] draw the circle bigger not to draw the
[1:28:55] circle smaller not to say no you don't
[1:28:57] believe it the way I believe it then you
[1:28:58] know you're probably going to find a
[1:29:00] better church somewhere else no we want
[1:29:02] to see our brothers and our sisters
[1:29:04] Fellowship
[1:29:06] but Satan's just looking for that window
[1:29:07] of opportunity he's looking for that
[1:29:09] moment when Satan's seen that little
[1:29:12] Church Without Christ then he said
[1:29:13] that's my opportunity this is the time
[1:29:15] when I'll teach them how to blaspheme me
[1:29:18] and and he began to blow with his breath
[1:29:21] a storm down on the sea and the little
[1:29:23] boat was just about to sink perhaps in
[1:29:27] Galilee there the waves was so heavy
[1:29:29] they went almost to the bottom
[1:29:32] and perhaps on every gleaming wave and
[1:29:35] every lightning time that flashed the
[1:29:39] devil would laugh out there and say I
[1:29:42] got them now
[1:29:43] because they've gone away without him
[1:29:47] brothers and sisters if we've ever gone
[1:29:49] away without him then I want to say this
[1:29:52] be afraid be afraid but if you've got
[1:29:56] Jesus if you recognize him in your life
[1:29:59] in your your family in your home if
[1:30:03] you're putting him first before all of
[1:30:05] our decisions be not afraid because it
[1:30:07] is I
[1:30:09] and we know I and my father are one
[1:30:11] that's where we're getting to with all
[1:30:13] of this that's our position in Christ is
[1:30:16] that he and I are one and that's not
[1:30:18] putting it out there and making it
[1:30:19] something Blasphemous that's the promise
[1:30:22] for our day because if we have his
[1:30:24] spirit in us then who are we going to be
[1:30:28] brother Bradham says if you've got the
[1:30:30] spirit of Dillinger what are you going
[1:30:31] to do
[1:30:32] you're going to be a gangster right if
[1:30:35] you've got the spirit of Mozart in you
[1:30:37] you're going to compose
[1:30:39] if you've got the spirit of Christ in
[1:30:41] you then you're going to be the word
[1:30:44] that's all
[1:30:47] I just love the story
[1:30:51] story of them being in the ship and uh
[1:30:54] and the visual that brother Branham
[1:30:56] brings when he talks about this stuff
[1:30:58] how he
[1:30:59] how he gives it a bit of drama
[1:31:03] and you know I just really love the
[1:31:05] service on on Wednesday there was so
[1:31:06] many good points
[1:31:08] and brother Mervin he brought he brought
[1:31:10] some things that I just want to mention
[1:31:11] three things that I I think are well
[1:31:13] worth mentioning and I probably will
[1:31:15] continue to do that and even if I just
[1:31:18] meditate myself on them but
[1:31:20] just for today it's for free thank you
[1:31:23] brother Mervin
[1:31:24] he said you know what if we ask for
[1:31:26] wisdom
[1:31:27] we're going to get problems to solve
[1:31:30] God's going to give us problems he'll
[1:31:31] answer our prayers but it's not going to
[1:31:33] be just a a cloud floating down with all
[1:31:36] of the wisdom and and all the
[1:31:38] intelligence in the universe that's
[1:31:40] going to come to us it's not going to be
[1:31:41] like that he's going to give us problems
[1:31:42] to solve so that we can learn from those
[1:31:45] problems and how we solve them and and
[1:31:47] really how we don't solve them how he
[1:31:50] solves them how we need to surrender
[1:31:51] ourselves just like the ministry and
[1:31:53] allow Christ to come and solve the
[1:31:55] problems in our lives if we ask for
[1:31:57] wisdom he's going to give us problems so
[1:31:59] if he does just Rejoice because those
[1:32:01] trials are more precious to us than than
[1:32:04] gold than pure gold and if we ask for
[1:32:08] courage he's going to give us trials
[1:32:11] it's not just going to be a flowery bed
[1:32:13] of ease
[1:32:17] if we ask for love this one took the
[1:32:19] cake for me my goodness
[1:32:22] if we ask for love how many remembers
[1:32:24] this if we ask for love God will give us
[1:32:26] troublemakers
[1:32:28] we're going to have problems with people
[1:32:30] because we're going to have to learn how
[1:32:32] to love prickly ones those ones that
[1:32:34] just want to find a fault with
[1:32:36] everything that's going on and that's
[1:32:37] just their Essence that's the way it is
[1:32:40] but if we ask for love God's going to
[1:32:42] give us troublemakers I thought that was
[1:32:45] so incredible
[1:32:46] because it's true it's so simple but you
[1:32:49] know what we said it earlier we're just
[1:32:51] going to draw the circle bigger brothers
[1:32:52] and sisters we're not going to draw it
[1:32:53] tighter and smaller that's not the
[1:32:54] spirit of Christ
[1:32:56] nope and if people just get upset
[1:32:58] because they want to they they want to
[1:33:00] have that sort of thing go on then what
[1:33:03] what can we do we love our brothers and
[1:33:05] we love our sisters but we love the word
[1:33:07] more we love the word most and when we
[1:33:11] have the word we love one another
[1:33:12] because the word said how will the world
[1:33:14] know that you love me not that you have
[1:33:17] all the quotes and you have all the
[1:33:19] notes and you've got all the history and
[1:33:20] the message of the hour no there's no
[1:33:23] Apostolic succession brother Branham
[1:33:26] says because their parents are in God
[1:33:27] doesn't have any grandchildren no he
[1:33:30] only has children Sons and Daughters of
[1:33:33] God that's all and the only way we're
[1:33:35] getting in is to go and have that Upper
[1:33:36] Room experience on our own
[1:33:40] my
[1:33:42] if we ask for love God will give it to
[1:33:45] us
[1:33:46] but we're going to have to deal with
[1:33:47] prickly people and I just say you know
[1:33:49] brothers and sisters I'm not saying this
[1:33:50] to to say if you're going to ask God for
[1:33:53] something you need to be afraid
[1:33:55] I want to say this if you want to ask
[1:33:57] God for something then ask big I ask
[1:34:00] bold ask God to give you all that you
[1:34:03] need to equip you for the journey
[1:34:04] because he will you know if we have to
[1:34:07] deal with prickly people maybe he'll
[1:34:09] give us a body suit he'll give us some
[1:34:10] big thick welding gloves that will be
[1:34:12] able to just grab the cactus person and
[1:34:14] hug them and not get prickles in us that
[1:34:17] hurt us maybe they'll stick to our our
[1:34:19] gloves and our our suit but they won't
[1:34:21] get in our skin they won't hurt us
[1:34:24] if we need wisdom he'll give us problems
[1:34:27] but he'll give us the ability to solve
[1:34:28] those problems brothers and sisters I'm
[1:34:30] not saying this to scare us I'm just
[1:34:32] saying that God will give us everything
[1:34:35] we need but the only way we're going to
[1:34:36] get it is to come his way
[1:34:40] you know I thought this one part of the
[1:34:42] story here
[1:34:44] Jesus what did he do after he fed the
[1:34:48] multitude I just find this really
[1:34:50] interesting and maybe it's just me it's
[1:34:52] a simple thing but did you catch the
[1:34:54] part that Jesus sent the people away
[1:34:57] he actually said it's over now show's
[1:35:01] over time to go home there's nothing to
[1:35:03] see here
[1:35:04] he constrained the people to leave and
[1:35:06] once he did that he got the disciples to
[1:35:09] get in the boat and send them across the
[1:35:12] way and brother Branham says you know in
[1:35:14] this message that somebody found fault
[1:35:16] with that to say that Jesus sent them
[1:35:18] away they left though why did they go
[1:35:21] brother Adam says I I said something
[1:35:23] about that one time and someone
[1:35:24] corrected me afterwards said but brother
[1:35:26] Branham he constrained them to go away
[1:35:28] without them I said yes but they done
[1:35:31] wrong by doing so
[1:35:34] can you imagine that
[1:35:36] the disciples done wrong by doing so
[1:35:38] here we have a prophet of God
[1:35:41] how does this how does this line up it's
[1:35:44] kind of like this it doesn't really it's
[1:35:46] not really congruent but if you take a
[1:35:48] step backwards and you listen to what
[1:35:50] the prophet says it really does because
[1:35:52] he goes on and he says I said yes but
[1:35:55] they done wrong by doing so when Elijah
[1:35:57] and Elijah was a type Christ to the
[1:36:01] church he goes into this story you
[1:36:03] remember the story of Elijah and Elisha
[1:36:06] Elijah says to Elisha what could I do
[1:36:08] for you you know what what would you
[1:36:10] like and he says I want a double portion
[1:36:12] of what you got buddy I I want some of
[1:36:14] that Holy Ghost in me I want that Spirit
[1:36:16] to be in me but I want a double portion
[1:36:18] of it and he says oh man you ask a hard
[1:36:20] thing how can I ever do that but alas
[1:36:23] you know what if you see me when I go
[1:36:25] you can have what you want right and now
[1:36:27] we have brother Brad I'm saying this is
[1:36:29] a type of Christ in the church this is
[1:36:31] the Bride of Jesus Christ and Jesus
[1:36:33] Christ and he said you know if you see
[1:36:36] me when I go that's fine you can have it
[1:36:38] and then along the way afterwards he
[1:36:41] says to him he's the trainer he's the
[1:36:43] master he's the instructor how about you
[1:36:45] just wait for me here he said it three
[1:36:47] times I think it is just stay here and
[1:36:49] wait for me here I got another thing I
[1:36:51] gotta go and do over here and he said no
[1:36:53] uh-uh you're not getting out of my sight
[1:36:54] I'm not letting you go one second out of
[1:36:56] my sight I am going all the way with you
[1:36:58] because I am going to see you go when
[1:37:01] that promise comes to pass because why I
[1:37:03] believe that that promise is coming to
[1:37:05] pass and needs to be the same way for
[1:37:07] the Church of the Living God we need to
[1:37:09] make sure that we keep our eyes on
[1:37:10] Christ we don't want to get any
[1:37:12] distractions brothers and sisters don't
[1:37:14] get fussed with people don't worry about
[1:37:16] the situations and the troubles and and
[1:37:18] most of all brothers and sisters don't
[1:37:20] don't look at me
[1:37:22] don't look at men don't look at Ministry
[1:37:24] don't don't look at at pet doctrines
[1:37:28] look at the message of the hour look at
[1:37:30] the word of God for our day and get
[1:37:32] caught up in that atmosphere in that
[1:37:35] spirit and then when that promise comes
[1:37:37] to pass when your body is about to
[1:37:39] change you'll get that double portion of
[1:37:41] the promise for you in your life
[1:37:44] brother Adam says when Elijah and Elisha
[1:37:46] which is a type Christ and the church
[1:37:48] Elisha taking a double portion of the
[1:37:50] spirit these things that I do shall you
[1:37:53] do and greater than this shall you do
[1:37:57] when the cloak that was on him the Holy
[1:38:00] Spirit was on him falls upon the church
[1:38:05] I got studying this one time brothers
[1:38:07] and sisters and I don't know maybe you
[1:38:09] can call me crazy it's fine I am I know
[1:38:11] it but I I don't know if I was in a
[1:38:13] dream or if I was awake or if it was a
[1:38:16] vision I don't know I'm not a super
[1:38:18] spiritual guy I I don't know but I had a
[1:38:20] moment in time in my life sometimes we
[1:38:22] have these Impressions and and they just
[1:38:25] strike us so deeply and they're so vivid
[1:38:27] what I saw was a vision of Elijah going
[1:38:31] up and I don't know maybe I was just
[1:38:32] listening to a message and I fell into a
[1:38:34] dream it could be that simple but it was
[1:38:35] just so vivid to me Elijah went up and
[1:38:39] his mantle came down but his mantle
[1:38:41] wasn't a mantle in in my little vision
[1:38:44] or whatever you want to call it what it
[1:38:46] was was a message book it was the
[1:38:48] message of the hour that was the mantle
[1:38:50] that fell down when Elijah went up and
[1:38:53] you know what brothers and sisters I
[1:38:54] stepped back and I thought my goodness I
[1:38:56] talked to a brother about this one time
[1:38:58] and he says oh no we're not going to go
[1:38:59] and get into Elijah's mantles now there
[1:39:01] is a Doctrine about mantles and I'm not
[1:39:03] going to do that I'm not trying to do
[1:39:04] that what I am trying to say though is
[1:39:07] that we have been given that double
[1:39:08] portion already brothers and sisters if
[1:39:10] we take this message of the hour and
[1:39:12] accept it this way we just have the
[1:39:14] prophet of God say that it is a type of
[1:39:16] Christ and the church what would be that
[1:39:19] mantle
[1:39:20] a prayer cloth from Jeffersonville
[1:39:22] Indiana is that going to take us into
[1:39:25] the body change brothers and sisters
[1:39:27] an artifact from Brother Branham that's
[1:39:30] not going to change our bodies
[1:39:32] the only thing that's going to change
[1:39:33] our bodies is the message of the hour
[1:39:35] that brother Branham brought to us
[1:39:38] the Fulfillment of his purpose to be
[1:39:40] Malachi 4.
[1:39:43] but I just think it's beautiful he says
[1:39:46] Elisha taking a double portion of that
[1:39:48] Spirit these things that I do shall you
[1:39:50] do and greater than this shall you do
[1:39:52] and we know that is greater we talked
[1:39:56] about this again brother Mervin he
[1:39:58] taught me this you know Jesus he broke
[1:40:00] the bread from bread didn't he and he
[1:40:02] broke the fish from the fish it was just
[1:40:04] a regular Wednesday night service but so
[1:40:06] you know what it happens brothers and
[1:40:07] sisters it becomes yours it's your
[1:40:09] Revelation from God it's your free gift
[1:40:10] from God and it comes to the five-fold
[1:40:12] ministry but here we have brother
[1:40:15] brother Mervin explaining this exactly
[1:40:17] like brother Bradham says you can look
[1:40:18] it up God he created fish from Fish and
[1:40:22] bread from bread Jesus did that when he
[1:40:24] was here but what did Brother Branham do
[1:40:26] with the squirrels where did those come
[1:40:28] from
[1:40:29] that's more than just bread from bread
[1:40:32] and fish from Fish greater than these
[1:40:35] shall you do he says when the cloak that
[1:40:37] was on him the Holy Spirit was on him
[1:40:40] falls upon the church because he was
[1:40:43] just one man church is universal More
[1:40:47] Than This shall you do for I go to the
[1:40:50] father and Elisha knowed more about that
[1:40:52] being a prophet than the church does
[1:40:55] today okay
[1:40:56] Elijah Elijah said when there was a
[1:40:59] gathering said you stay here the Lord's
[1:41:01] called me Yonder I'm going up to the
[1:41:03] school of the prophets but Elisha like
[1:41:05] the church ought to be today as the Lord
[1:41:07] God lives I'm not going to leave you for
[1:41:10] he had an objective in his mind and his
[1:41:13] motives was certainly right you know
[1:41:16] brother Branham I'm going to jump ahead
[1:41:17] of myself here I'm just going to say it
[1:41:19] brother Bradham says if you've got the
[1:41:21] right mental attitude towards God's
[1:41:23] promises in his word then you can have
[1:41:25] what you ask
[1:41:27] but you got to have the right mental
[1:41:28] attitude and the only way you're going
[1:41:29] to have the right mental attitude is to
[1:41:31] have the right thinking
[1:41:32] when those thoughts come into your mind
[1:41:34] like brother Toby preached my goodness
[1:41:37] it's just beautiful it's so true though
[1:41:39] if we don't have the right thinking that
[1:41:40] right thinking has to be according to
[1:41:42] the word according to the word for our
[1:41:44] day we could have thinking that says we
[1:41:46] need to go up and build an ark
[1:41:48] and we can put on sunscreen so we won't
[1:41:49] get sunstroke like that guy did the one
[1:41:51] time right he got sun stroke and was up
[1:41:53] there beating on the hill
[1:41:55] even when they could prove there wasn't
[1:41:56] rain we could go down that road but
[1:41:58] that's not going to save us today
[1:41:59] because all that wood and Pitch that's
[1:42:01] going into that wood is going to burn
[1:42:03] the promise for our day is a baptism by
[1:42:06] fire it's not going to be a flood of
[1:42:07] water
[1:42:10] all right
[1:42:13] I'm not going to leave you for he had an
[1:42:15] objective in his mind and his motives
[1:42:18] was certainly right and we know that he
[1:42:20] was given a double portion
[1:42:22] he did exactly the double amount of
[1:42:24] Miracles and I don't know them offhand
[1:42:25] someone probably does
[1:42:27] but you know one of them that really
[1:42:29] speaks to me I just think is so
[1:42:30] wonderful how the the I think it was the
[1:42:33] prophets were with Elisha was with the
[1:42:35] prophets and they are working and they
[1:42:37] were trying to get some stuff done they
[1:42:39] were gonna I think get some victuals
[1:42:41] going on and they were cutting wood by
[1:42:43] the river
[1:42:44] remember this story and one of the one
[1:42:47] of the servants he he said alas Master
[1:42:50] oh I'm in big trouble I don't have much
[1:42:53] money but uh the ax that I was using the
[1:42:55] head came off of it the iron ax head
[1:42:58] came off and it landed in the water and
[1:43:00] now it's at the bottom of this stream
[1:43:02] and I borrowed this and I can't give it
[1:43:04] back I don't have any money to pay for
[1:43:06] it what am I gonna do I'm here helping
[1:43:08] you trying with all my heart and he says
[1:43:10] oh where did it go and he says well it
[1:43:12] was in that general area and he goes
[1:43:13] over there and what happens
[1:43:15] the prophet of God made that iron swim
[1:43:19] and you know it goes beyond iron
[1:43:22] swimming brothers and sisters what the
[1:43:23] word of God says what it is is a control
[1:43:26] a change of the molecular composition of
[1:43:30] the universe
[1:43:31] something changed the time space
[1:43:34] continuum for something to completely go
[1:43:37] against gravity how could iron swim
[1:43:42] the prophet of God right there and you
[1:43:44] know brothers and sisters if you believe
[1:43:46] this message of the hour and you have
[1:43:48] that mantle in you the Holy Ghost the
[1:43:51] prophet of God just said don't be afraid
[1:43:54] because it is I when you face the
[1:43:56] troubles when the storms come around
[1:43:58] don't be afraid it is I
[1:44:02] Satan's gonna say oh now I got you
[1:44:04] you're away from the church you're away
[1:44:05] from all your brothers and sisters
[1:44:06] you're away from that that really good
[1:44:08] feeling that you get in a service when
[1:44:10] we're having a really good service now
[1:44:11] you're on your own now I got you now I
[1:44:13] can get you where I want you nope just
[1:44:16] say be not afraid because Jesus is right
[1:44:18] here Jesus is here
[1:44:21] I don't know if anybody remembers the
[1:44:23] story about sister Jermaine
[1:44:26] powerful story powerful story I I don't
[1:44:30] say it to credit anything but I just say
[1:44:33] this don't ever blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[1:44:36] don't ever blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[1:44:39] sister she had problems in her body and
[1:44:41] she was before a surgeon and the surgeon
[1:44:44] said I could have this wrong but my
[1:44:46] understanding is the surgeon said to her
[1:44:49] you're gonna you're gonna have to deal
[1:44:50] with this and there's nothing you can do
[1:44:52] about it and she said oh no I don't
[1:44:54] accept that and he said what do you mean
[1:44:55] you don't accept that she said Jesus is
[1:44:57] here and the surgeon said to her what
[1:44:59] are you talking about woman it's just
[1:45:01] you and me in this office Jesus isn't
[1:45:03] here that's that's I don't know if you
[1:45:04] said that's crazy but he just dismissed
[1:45:06] it like like she was crazy and and she
[1:45:09] said no no no no no but he just
[1:45:10] completely dismissed her like she was
[1:45:12] not well in the head and I'm not sure
[1:45:15] how it went physically for her
[1:45:17] afterwards but I know if I understand
[1:45:19] correctly how it went for him physically
[1:45:21] afterwards I I understand that he had an
[1:45:24] accident afterwards after he blasphemed
[1:45:26] the Holy Ghost because she was not
[1:45:28] talking about herself she was talking
[1:45:30] about the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ
[1:45:31] himself
[1:45:34] don't ever blaspheme the Holy Ghost we
[1:45:36] can do a lot of things in this world
[1:45:37] Jesus said I'll forgive you for it when
[1:45:40] he was here when God was standing here
[1:45:42] on flesh he said you know what I'll
[1:45:43] forgive you for that now
[1:45:45] but boy oh boy when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:45:48] if you do it if you say one word against
[1:45:50] this this Holy Ghost one word will not
[1:45:53] be forgiven
[1:45:55] you know that made me shudder to my
[1:45:56] bones because I actually came in and I
[1:45:58] started to believe this message and
[1:46:00] started to get Justified and Sanctified
[1:46:03] and was looking for the promise of being
[1:46:05] filled with the Holy Ghost myself and
[1:46:07] and I remember taking the lord's name in
[1:46:10] vain
[1:46:11] to my shame brothers and sisters I'm not
[1:46:13] saying that for any glory and I thought
[1:46:16] it was it was really heavy hearted for
[1:46:19] me to the point where I was ready to
[1:46:20] turn around and walk back out that door
[1:46:22] and say I'm no good I know I know I
[1:46:24] can't be saved because I've already gone
[1:46:26] too far but thanks be to God for a
[1:46:28] prophet that would say there's only one
[1:46:30] unpardonable sin and that's the
[1:46:32] blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[1:46:35] is not to take the lord's name in vain
[1:46:37] I'm not saying go do it but I'm saying
[1:46:39] if you've done it it's not unpardonable
[1:46:42] if you come and ask the Lord to forgive
[1:46:44] you if you acknowledge that
[1:46:49] brother Branham he says what the church
[1:46:51] needs today
[1:46:52] he says that's what the church has got
[1:46:54] to do today
[1:46:56] no matter what comes or goes
[1:46:59] hold on to him
[1:47:02] I love how he says this because we can
[1:47:04] get caught up in the church and say oh
[1:47:06] there's this and oh there's that and
[1:47:08] this should be this way and that should
[1:47:09] be the other way and I thought it was
[1:47:11] supposed to be something else as soon as
[1:47:13] we start doing that brothers and sisters
[1:47:14] what we're doing is we're putting a stop
[1:47:16] we're putting a period behind
[1:47:18] the Lord behind the word of God in our
[1:47:20] midst brother Adam says that's what the
[1:47:21] church has got to do today no matter
[1:47:23] what comes or goes hold on to him if the
[1:47:26] church cools off no matter what takes
[1:47:29] place hold on to God's unchanging hand
[1:47:35] get a hold of calvary
[1:47:37] and stay there that's the way to get
[1:47:40] something from God hold to it he says
[1:47:42] Don't Let The Devil shake you away don't
[1:47:45] let the devil Shake You Down he's coming
[1:47:48] to Shake You Down and God will allow him
[1:47:50] to Shake You Down God will allow it to
[1:47:53] happen brother Bonham uses that
[1:47:54] illustration very clearly about the the
[1:47:56] train company and how they pack up the
[1:47:58] the train cars and if they're not packed
[1:48:01] correctly when the inspector comes
[1:48:02] around he'll give them a shake to see if
[1:48:05] they're packed correctly and when he
[1:48:06] shakes them if they rattle around he'll
[1:48:08] say you know what that's good everything
[1:48:09] is in there but it just needs to be
[1:48:11] packed better so I'll come back around a
[1:48:13] little while give you some time to just
[1:48:15] repack that car and that's the same with
[1:48:17] our lives we've got to make sure that
[1:48:19] everything is packed incorrectly that we
[1:48:21] have the word of God packed into our
[1:48:23] lives the correct Manner and when we do
[1:48:25] he'll come around the devil will shake
[1:48:27] us down he'll use the devil as a tool to
[1:48:30] shake us down
[1:48:31] to prove that we've got that seal and I
[1:48:35] just I can't get over that example that
[1:48:37] we got
[1:48:38] can you imagine that brothers and
[1:48:39] sisters us being just a soda can
[1:48:43] and the devil having permission to just
[1:48:44] come and step right on top of our head
[1:48:46] and just stand with one foot right on
[1:48:49] top of our head and when we're filled
[1:48:51] and sealed can't touch us
[1:48:54] nothing happens that weight just gets
[1:48:57] totally transferred down to the floor
[1:48:59] and the floor is what gets damaged but
[1:49:01] it doesn't hurt us but boy if we're not
[1:49:03] filled and sealed what happens if we've
[1:49:05] got a little tiny pinhole in there if
[1:49:07] it's just some other way if it's some
[1:49:10] other thing if it's some other filling
[1:49:12] then what's going to happen is he's
[1:49:13] going to step on it and it's just going
[1:49:15] to squish out we could be filled and not
[1:49:17] sealed right brothers and sisters what
[1:49:18] would happen if we were filled and not
[1:49:20] sealed with a soda can here on stage I
[1:49:23] kind of thought that might happen I was
[1:49:25] cringing I was thinking oh no we're
[1:49:27] going to get Coke all over the piano and
[1:49:29] the pulpit no but what happened nothing
[1:49:32] happened because he was sealed and
[1:49:35] filled but if it's just filled and not
[1:49:37] sealed it's going to spray everywhere
[1:49:42] got to get sealed brothers and sisters
[1:49:45] gotta get filled and I want to say this
[1:49:47] I think it's beautiful I'm not trying to
[1:49:49] intellectualize it and make it something
[1:49:51] weird it's not a buried doctor and don't
[1:49:54] don't think it is when you get filled
[1:49:55] you get sealed the filling is the
[1:49:58] ceiling
[1:49:59] it's not a different thing
[1:50:01] and and I think brother Mervin I think
[1:50:03] did you talk about it how yeah you did
[1:50:06] you did I won't go too far into it the
[1:50:08] new birth and the baptism of the Holy
[1:50:10] Spirit they're the same thing
[1:50:13] they're the same the filling and the
[1:50:15] ceiling is the same thing brothers and
[1:50:16] sisters it's not a pet Doctrine where we
[1:50:19] can say now once you've accomplished
[1:50:20] these tasks now you can move on to the
[1:50:22] next part and you get a badge and you
[1:50:24] can move into a different section of the
[1:50:26] church and you'll be able to get a
[1:50:28] different anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:30] you know that's not the way it works not
[1:50:32] not in the Church of the Living God if
[1:50:34] you believe then just be Not Afraid
[1:50:35] brothers and sisters just receive that
[1:50:37] filling of the Holy Ghost just allow it
[1:50:39] to happen to you because when it does
[1:50:41] Satan won't be able to touch you the
[1:50:43] Gates of Hell won't be able to Prevail
[1:50:44] against that Revelation that comes into
[1:50:46] your heart when you know that you know
[1:50:48] that you know when you get to that place
[1:50:50] ain't nothing going to touch you
[1:50:54] and when we get the problems in our
[1:50:56] lives
[1:50:57] we just want to thank the Lord for them
[1:50:58] because they're only there to perfect us
[1:51:01] they're only there so that God can bring
[1:51:03] out his glory in our lives
[1:51:06] I say Lord help me give give me a
[1:51:09] trepidatiously give me courage because I
[1:51:12] know when you give me courage you're
[1:51:13] going to give me trials give me wisdom
[1:51:15] how to deal with those trials and I know
[1:51:18] that that's going to give me problems
[1:51:19] but you know what it's it's nothing is
[1:51:22] going to conquer me if I've got the holy
[1:51:24] ghost in my life so whatever the Lord
[1:51:26] wants done that's what's going to happen
[1:51:29] he's the one that's in control
[1:51:32] don't let the devil shake you away
[1:51:33] though brothers and sisters
[1:51:35] stay in our position if we can just stay
[1:51:37] in our position our position is to be
[1:51:39] seated in his throne
[1:51:41] with him
[1:51:42] to have him inside of us supping with us
[1:51:45] be not afraid it is I brother goes on to
[1:51:50] say in his message
[1:51:51] like Ruth
[1:51:54] to Naomi the moabite
[1:51:57] that your people be mine
[1:51:59] where you die I'll die
[1:52:01] where you're buried I'll bury
[1:52:05] where your God is
[1:52:06] that'll be my God
[1:52:10] I'm going to stay with you
[1:52:13] he says that's the way she won Boaz
[1:52:17] that's the way the church wins Christ
[1:52:20] when we're willing to sell out
[1:52:23] all of our our theories all of our
[1:52:25] things I said it before and I'll just
[1:52:27] say it I want to make sure that I'm
[1:52:28] clear about this I I'm really starting
[1:52:30] to explore this I heard something that
[1:52:31] I've probably heard many times but I've
[1:52:33] never it's never really resounded with
[1:52:35] me and I caught it and what brother
[1:52:37] Branham says is pet Doctrine and you
[1:52:40] don't have to look very far to see pet
[1:52:41] doctrines all over the place and and
[1:52:44] it's interesting because unless we're
[1:52:46] willing to let go of our pet doctrines
[1:52:48] brothers and sisters we're not going to
[1:52:50] be able to follow Jesus Christ we're not
[1:52:53] going to be able to go all the way with
[1:52:54] him because our pet doctrines are going
[1:52:56] to hold us back but when we're willing
[1:52:58] to let go of all of those pet doctrines
[1:53:00] all of those theories and ideas and
[1:53:02] traditions and teachings
[1:53:04] that's the way we win Christ when we
[1:53:06] sell out to him when we show him that
[1:53:10] there's nothing that we're willing to
[1:53:11] hold on to there's no grudge there's no
[1:53:13] anger there's no fear there's no
[1:53:15] frustration there's no problems there's
[1:53:17] no trials there's no situations that I'm
[1:53:19] going to esteem greater than my ability
[1:53:22] to hold on to that word and follow that
[1:53:24] word
[1:53:25] but sometimes we can do that we can hold
[1:53:27] on to things and they will hinder us
[1:53:29] from being able to go on
[1:53:32] let your people be my
[1:53:35] where you die I'll die
[1:53:36] were you buried I'll bury where your God
[1:53:39] is that'll be my God I'm going to stay
[1:53:42] with you that's the way she won Boaz
[1:53:44] that's the way the church wins Christ
[1:53:46] regardless of what the world's got to
[1:53:49] say
[1:53:51] ing you've went on
[1:53:54] went off on the deep end you've done
[1:53:58] this that or the other stay with Christ
[1:54:00] hold on to him stay with it
[1:54:03] you know brothers and sisters the world
[1:54:05] will say it they will say you've gone
[1:54:07] off the deep end you you're you've gone
[1:54:10] into a cult you've gone into some weird
[1:54:11] thing but I just want to say be not
[1:54:13] afraid because it is I
[1:54:15] Be not Afraid Brothers and Sisters of
[1:54:17] the message of the hour there's folks
[1:54:19] that maybe will be I heard somebody say
[1:54:21] recently that brother Branham was a
[1:54:22] criminal and I just couldn't believe
[1:54:24] that when I heard that it just broke my
[1:54:26] heart to think that people would
[1:54:27] actually say that go into that why would
[1:54:31] people say that what what's the matter
[1:54:33] and I know what it is it's Mark chapter
[1:54:36] six
[1:54:38] when they saw him walking upon the sea
[1:54:42] they supposed it had been a spirit and
[1:54:44] cried out
[1:54:47] for they all saw him and were troubled
[1:54:50] and immediately he talked with them
[1:54:53] and said unto them be of good cheer it
[1:54:55] is I be not afraid
[1:54:58] and he went up into them into the ship
[1:55:00] and the wind ceased
[1:55:03] and they were so amazed in themselves
[1:55:05] beyond measure and wondered
[1:55:08] could you imagine that just being in the
[1:55:10] midst of a storm and seeing Jesus
[1:55:12] walking on the water and and seeing him
[1:55:15] come and supposing it was a spirit and
[1:55:17] being afraid of being swamped by the
[1:55:20] storm and the boat you're going to drown
[1:55:21] and die and then to see a spirit and
[1:55:24] then realize it's not a spirit it's your
[1:55:26] friend
[1:55:27] it's the master it's the rabbi it's the
[1:55:30] teacher
[1:55:32] and for him to get in the boat and there
[1:55:33] they find themselves and he went up in
[1:55:35] on onto them into the ship and the wind
[1:55:38] ceased and they were so amazed in
[1:55:40] themselves beyond measure and wondered
[1:55:41] for they considered not the miracle of
[1:55:44] the loaves
[1:55:46] what just happened remember the story
[1:55:48] that we talked about right at the very
[1:55:49] beginning the feeding of the five
[1:55:51] thousand just the men not including the
[1:55:53] women and the children how many people
[1:55:54] were there there the feeding of the five
[1:55:56] thousand and the 12 baskets that were
[1:55:58] left over that they collected afterwards
[1:56:00] they considered not the miracle of the
[1:56:02] loaves why didn't they brothers and
[1:56:04] sisters because their heart was hardened
[1:56:07] and we know that the last days those
[1:56:10] people who scoff at the word those
[1:56:12] people who only go so far where it's a
[1:56:15] so far gospel their hearts will be
[1:56:17] hardened their hearts will be hardened
[1:56:19] and you know we talked about it last
[1:56:20] week I believe it was or maybe it was a
[1:56:22] week before it was a little while ago
[1:56:23] that it says in the word of God that he
[1:56:25] will send a delusion not just a delusion
[1:56:27] he'll send a strong delusion people's
[1:56:30] way and another place in the Bible I
[1:56:32] think it's in Isaiah or Zechariah
[1:56:34] forgive me he says that I will give them
[1:56:37] a delusion of my choosing
[1:56:40] not just anything it's going to be what
[1:56:42] he chooses to give them as a delusion
[1:56:45] it's no wonder people have all these
[1:56:47] different thoughts and ideas going on
[1:56:48] right now but why does it happen it's
[1:56:50] because their hearts are hardened
[1:56:52] people's hearts are hardened we know the
[1:56:54] word of God says that because of
[1:56:56] iniquity the love of many shall wax cold
[1:57:01] and that's a tough thing
[1:57:03] all we need to do is do what we know we
[1:57:05] need to do and to stop doing what we
[1:57:07] know we need to stop doing and just
[1:57:09] allow our hearts to remain tender before
[1:57:12] the Lord let's turn over to Luke Chapter
[1:57:14] 24. we still have a couple minutes here
[1:57:20] that's okay
[1:57:23] Luke chapter 24 thank you everyone for
[1:57:26] the specials today so beautiful
[1:57:29] the the poetry and the songs it all sets
[1:57:32] an atmosphere it all goes together
[1:57:35] everyone adding their their sacred
[1:57:38] portion to the service because the
[1:57:40] service is not just the preaching of the
[1:57:42] word it's everybody coming with a desire
[1:57:45] in their hearts
[1:57:47] Luke 24 we'll start reading with verse
[1:57:49] 32 of Luke chapter 24.
[1:57:53] picking up sort of at the tail end of
[1:57:55] the of the
[1:57:57] the story that we talked about the two
[1:57:59] on the road to Emmaus
[1:58:02] verse 31 is and their eyes were open and
[1:58:04] they knew him and he vanished out of
[1:58:06] their sight
[1:58:07] sort of the end of that story there but
[1:58:09] then it goes into another story here
[1:58:11] verse 32 and they said one to another
[1:58:13] did not our hearts burn within us well
[1:58:15] they talked with us by the way and while
[1:58:18] he opened to us the scriptures and they
[1:58:21] rose up the same hour and returned to
[1:58:24] Jerusalem and found 11 gathered together
[1:58:26] with them that were
[1:58:30] sorry found the eleven gathered together
[1:58:32] and them that were with them saying the
[1:58:35] Lord has risen indeed and hath appeared
[1:58:37] to Simon
[1:58:38] and they told what things were done in
[1:58:41] the way and how he was known of them in
[1:58:45] Breaking of bread
[1:58:47] and as they thus spake
[1:58:49] Jesus himself stood in the midst of them
[1:58:52] and said unto them peace be unto you
[1:58:56] isn't it a beautiful thing what his
[1:58:59] immediate introduction is his immediate
[1:59:01] greeting is
[1:59:03] be not afraid it is I
[1:59:06] peace
[1:59:07] be to you
[1:59:09] peace be unto you don't don't don't be
[1:59:12] afraid I'm not coming to destroy you I'm
[1:59:15] coming to love you I'm coming to
[1:59:17] encourage you
[1:59:18] but what is human nature brothers and
[1:59:20] sisters
[1:59:21] the human nature is verse 37 but they
[1:59:24] were terrified and afraided and supposed
[1:59:26] they had seen a spirit
[1:59:29] what
[1:59:31] it's the same narrative as in the boat
[1:59:34] they're afraided that they've seen a
[1:59:36] spirit
[1:59:38] and he said unto them why are you
[1:59:40] troubled and why do thoughts arise in
[1:59:42] your hearts haven't you this is me
[1:59:45] speaking haven't you got thinking now
[1:59:47] don't you think according to the words
[1:59:49] that I've instructed you so that when
[1:59:51] those thoughts come you don't let them
[1:59:52] arise in your heart you take them into
[1:59:54] captivity
[1:59:57] and he said unto them why are you
[1:59:59] troubled and why do thoughts arise in
[2:00:01] your hearts behold my hands and my feet
[2:00:03] that it is I myself handle me and see
[2:00:07] for a spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as
[2:00:10] ye see me have
[2:00:13] and when he had thus spoken he showed
[2:00:15] them his hands and his feet and while
[2:00:17] they yet believed not for joy and
[2:00:20] wondered he said unto them have ye hear
[2:00:24] any meat
[2:00:26] let me show you something else
[2:00:29] and he gave them they gave him a piece
[2:00:31] of broiled fish and then honeycomb and
[2:00:34] he took it and did eat before them
[2:00:37] and he said unto them these are the
[2:00:39] words which I spake unto you while I was
[2:00:41] yet with you that all things must be
[2:00:44] fulfilled which were written in the law
[2:00:46] of Moses and in the prophets and in the
[2:00:49] Psalms concerning me
[2:00:52] verse 45 is really where I want to get
[2:00:54] to brothers and sisters I don't want to
[2:00:56] dwell on the fact that they were
[2:00:57] afraided and there was a spirit verse 45
[2:01:00] and then opened he their understanding
[2:01:04] that they might understand the
[2:01:07] scriptures
[2:01:08] that's where we need to get brothers and
[2:01:10] sisters is to have him to recognize him
[2:01:14] in our midst that he is here and it
[2:01:17] takes him to open our understanding to
[2:01:20] the scriptures but when that happens
[2:01:22] we're not going to be afraid we're not
[2:01:24] going to be afraided and feared because
[2:01:26] we see people that we have known in the
[2:01:29] past we're going to say Amen that time
[2:01:31] is here the Rapture is upon us brothers
[2:01:34] and sisters we're now witnessing the
[2:01:36] tale end of this the Capstone the
[2:01:38] culmination of what everyone talked
[2:01:40] about through all the centuries
[2:01:42] someone has to be that person on Earth
[2:01:45] to be a living witness of it isn't it
[2:01:48] amazing that there were people that
[2:01:50] Jesus chose to actually show himself to
[2:01:53] he he chose to bring himself to and let
[2:01:57] them handle him and say handle me don't
[2:02:00] you see the the holes in my hands and in
[2:02:02] my feet the wounds that I took For All
[2:02:04] Mankind just give me some meat give me
[2:02:06] some bread give me something because
[2:02:08] this is Flesh and Bones brothers and
[2:02:10] sisters but it's a new glorified body
[2:02:12] and that's what's waiting for you just
[2:02:15] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[2:02:17] but it takes him to come around that he
[2:02:20] would open our understanding to the
[2:02:23] scriptures
[2:02:25] but verse 37 the natural tendency of a
[2:02:28] human being is they were terrified and
[2:02:30] afraighted and supposed that they had
[2:02:32] seen a spirit but remember brothers and
[2:02:35] sisters his first words are peace be
[2:02:37] unto you
[2:02:39] remember that God is not the author of
[2:02:41] confusion when we start to see the storm
[2:02:45] turning up and boiling over all around
[2:02:47] us
[2:02:51] excuse me
[2:02:53] don't worry
[2:02:55] because he is not looking to see us
[2:02:57] destroyed
[2:02:58] he might want to shake us down a little
[2:03:00] bit sometimes we just need a little
[2:03:01] distraction in our lives don't we
[2:03:04] sometimes we can get just focused on one
[2:03:06] thing and we can just start focusing on
[2:03:07] that one thing and just get a little too
[2:03:09] focused on that one thing whether it's a
[2:03:11] problem whether it's a hobby whether
[2:03:12] it's an interest whatever it is and what
[2:03:14] will God do he'll give us that little
[2:03:16] shake that that that little test that
[2:03:18] little thing that we need to just
[2:03:20] distract us from that to smarten us up
[2:03:23] and bring us right to the center of the
[2:03:24] road again but we all need it we all
[2:03:27] need correction and if we can't receive
[2:03:29] correction then we know what we are
[2:03:31] actually we don't
[2:03:34] you know Hebrews 13 8 it says
[2:03:37] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:03:39] and forever doesn't it he doesn't change
[2:03:42] so brothers and sisters I want to say Be
[2:03:45] not Afraid it is I when the storms of
[2:03:47] life come up in our lives don't don't
[2:03:49] don't worry don't be afraid be not
[2:03:51] afraid it is I and and and peace be unto
[2:03:56] you that is his desire for us Be not
[2:03:58] Afraid peace be unto you Hebrews 13 8
[2:04:02] Brothers and Sisters Jesus Christ the
[2:04:05] same yesterday today and forever
[2:04:08] I'll call the musicians
[2:04:11] but you know out of this message it is I
[2:04:13] 1960 brother Branham says he cannot be a
[2:04:16] god of Miracles one day
[2:04:18] and not a god of miracles in the next
[2:04:20] day
[2:04:22] for the Bible said he's the same
[2:04:25] yesterday today and forever he's still
[2:04:27] God
[2:04:28] and if you take the right mental
[2:04:30] attitude towards any promise
[2:04:33] when you read
[2:04:35] it in the Bible
[2:04:37] it's the truth
[2:04:39] no matter how many tries to put it on
[2:04:43] another age
[2:04:44] how many times people will say yeah you
[2:04:46] know that's coming in the future
[2:04:48] because sometimes we can do that we can
[2:04:50] say yeah it's coming in the future the
[2:04:52] Rapture is coming in the future I want
[2:04:53] to say this brothers and sisters the
[2:04:55] raptures right now
[2:04:57] this is a part of the Rapture if we
[2:04:59] could look at our lives and recognize
[2:05:01] that we're living out a part of the
[2:05:03] Rapture of the Church of the Living God
[2:05:06] the present tense I am
[2:05:08] is not going to be he he's not going to
[2:05:11] be the I will be or he's not the I was
[2:05:13] he's the I am
[2:05:16] and I want to say it again and again and
[2:05:18] again Be not Afraid peace be unto you it
[2:05:22] is I Be not Afraid brothers and sisters
[2:05:25] it is I we don't have anything to fear
[2:05:28] if we're putting him first in our lives
[2:05:32] when you read it in the Bible it's the
[2:05:34] truth no matter how many tries to put it
[2:05:36] on another age
[2:05:37] it's in the past or an age that's in the
[2:05:40] future
[2:05:41] he never did declare he was the I was
[2:05:43] he's the I am
[2:05:46] always
[2:05:47] maybe stand with me this morning as we
[2:05:49] close
[2:05:52] you know I'll just read one more
[2:05:53] scripture verse 49 of Luke chapter 24.
[2:05:57] and and I just want to encourage every
[2:05:58] one of us
[2:06:00] look for that in your life
[2:06:03] see if you can find that in your life
[2:06:05] brothers and sisters that you know that
[2:06:06] you've been filled and you know that
[2:06:08] you've been sealed
[2:06:10] and and you have to have it
[2:06:13] you have to have it there's no way
[2:06:15] around that
[2:06:16] and you're not going to be a pop can
[2:06:18] don't get me wrong that was just an
[2:06:19] example and it was just a beautiful
[2:06:20] example
[2:06:22] but you're going to be a vessel of the
[2:06:25] Holy Ghost you're going to be a temple
[2:06:26] of the Holy Ghost and I want to say it
[2:06:28] this way even if you don't believe that
[2:06:31] you have the Holy Ghost right now but
[2:06:32] you believe the word of God you've gone
[2:06:34] through justification you've gone
[2:06:35] through sanctification you are already a
[2:06:38] temple of the Holy Ghost because God
[2:06:40] chose you before the foundation of the
[2:06:42] world in him that you should be holy and
[2:06:44] Without Blame the sin the Spotless
[2:06:47] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ so don't
[2:06:50] let the devil come around and say oh no
[2:06:51] you don't got it just tell them yes I do
[2:06:53] you'll never live above your confession
[2:06:55] maybe oh you don't see the signs of it I
[2:06:58] don't need to because it's not about a
[2:07:00] feeling and it's not about a sign or a
[2:07:02] wonder what it's about is my ability to
[2:07:04] say Amen to the word and to believe it
[2:07:06] and to have the desire to live that word
[2:07:09] not just say I know all the quotes and
[2:07:11] I've got a bunch of notes I got all the
[2:07:13] message library that there is I've got
[2:07:15] all the recordings I've even got some
[2:07:17] unique special letters that brother
[2:07:19] Bradham hand wrote That Ain't Gonna Save
[2:07:21] Us brothers and sisters it's got to be
[2:07:23] the person of Jesus Christ filling us
[2:07:25] and sealing us but boy oh boy once we
[2:07:28] get to that place where we know that
[2:07:30] we've been filled where we know that
[2:07:31] we've been sealed brothers and sisters
[2:07:33] Satan is going to be powerless before
[2:07:34] you that's what brother Bradham was
[2:07:36] talking about he wants to creep into the
[2:07:38] framework of the Christian church and
[2:07:39] make it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[2:07:41] and make us say oh that guy's a fanatic
[2:07:43] and and look at this problem I'm over
[2:07:45] here look at that thing over there don't
[2:07:47] worry about any of that brothers and
[2:07:49] sisters keep your eyes focused on Elijah
[2:07:51] keep your eyes focused on the Lord and
