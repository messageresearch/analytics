[34:47] book um just wanted to uh while you're
[34:51] turning over to Revelations CH 3 verse
[34:54] 14 I just wanted to remind everyone that
[34:57] we had put it out there a little while
[34:58] ago and I should have done it much
[35:00] sooner but you know it's got to be a
[35:02] revelation I guess and that's the way
[35:04] things are it's my first time going
[35:07] through as a congregation study with
[35:09] this book and you know if there's
[35:11] anybody that has
[35:12] questions about this book there there
[35:15] they've got to be spiritual questions
[35:17] that means there has to be a spiritual
[35:19] answer for them so I just wanted to
[35:21] remind us that we are certainly open to
[35:24] questions and answers for this so if you
[35:27] have a question question by all means
[35:28] reach out or just write it down and drop
[35:31] it in the offering or put it in the box
[35:33] at the back however is convenient for
[35:36] you we certainly would love to uh engage
[35:39] in the questions and answers over in
[35:42] Revelations chapter 3 verse
[35:45] 14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[35:48] the leod Deans
[35:50] write these things saith the amen the
[35:54] faithful and true witness the beginning
[35:57] of the creation of God I Know Thy works
[36:00] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[36:03] would thou were cold or hot so then
[36:08] because Thou Art lukewarm and neither
[36:10] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my

[36:21] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[36:26] wretched and Mis miserable and poor and
[36:29] blind and

[36:34] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[36:37] rich and white rment that thou mayest be
[36:41] clothed and that the shame of thy
[36:44] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[36:47] eyes with isav that thou mayest
[36:51] see as many as I love I rebuke and
[36:54] chasen be zealous therefore and repent
[36:57] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[37:02] any man hear my voice and open the door

[39:33] it's warm and
[39:35] safe carrying on in our our study of
[39:38] this book you know the uh where we left
[39:42] off I'll just pick up there brother Bram
[39:44] he it's in the leoan church age he says
[39:46] yes sir the church is no longer the
[39:49] mouthpiece of
[39:50] God it is its own
[39:53] mouthpiece and it's just amazing if you
[39:56] look around found um at different
[39:59] denominations and
[40:01] different
[40:04] beliefs true words have never been
[40:06] spoken there's so many different
[40:08] versions of What Christianity
[40:11] is he goes on to say so God is turning
[40:14] on
[40:15] her he will confound her through the
[40:18] prophet and the bride and that is a
[40:21] powerful statement amen he will confound
[40:25] them through the prophet they'll reject
[40:28] the prophet that God could send a
[40:29] prophet to this age not just that
[40:32] brothers and sisters this is where it
[40:34] gets down to the the brass tax as it
[40:36] were the bride the bride will confound
[40:40] them for the voice of God will be in her
[40:44] yes it is for it says in the last
[40:47] chapter of Revelation verse 17 the
[40:50] spirit and the bride say come isn't that
[40:53] beautiful in harmony they will say the
[40:56] same thing
[40:57] just like parents when the children go
[41:00] and ask Mama mama can I do this she says
[41:04] no they run to Daddy Daddy can I do this
[41:08] they don't even have to talk as parents
[41:10] but they just say the same thing there's
[41:13] something about them when they're in
[41:15] unity once more the world will hear
[41:18] direct from God as at
[41:20] Pentecost but of course that word bride
[41:23] will be repudiated as in the first age
[41:27] now he has cried out to this last AG you
[41:30] have the word you have more Bibles than
[41:33] ever and can you imagine what brother
[41:36] brandham would have said here if he
[41:38] would have known the power of
[41:41] these you have computers you have the
[41:44] internet right you have the table with
[41:47] every single recorded message every
[41:49] single printed word you have all of
[41:53] it my you have more Bibles than ever but
[41:57] you are not doing anything about the
[41:59] word except dividing and hacking it into
[42:03] pieces taking what you want and leaving
[42:07] out what you don't
[42:09] want and this is where it gets
[42:11] interesting you can get into that study
[42:12] that we talked about a while ago that
[42:14] got passed around about the different
[42:15] versions of the
[42:17] Bible you just get into the New World
[42:20] Translation and whole verses are taken
[42:23] out of that Bible yes the the the the
[42:27] NIV is Twisted some of the verses aren't
[42:30] even they're missing words like and and
[42:33] you could say hey I believe this Bible I
[42:35] believe every single word of it but is
[42:37] it the inspired word that was given and
[42:40] I mean it just goes back to what we
[42:41] talked about earlier here where he says
[42:43] that the they'll just reject the prophet
[42:45] as soon as you reject the prophet then
[42:46] you have the open door for anything else
[42:49] it becomes a freef fall you can take any
[42:51] any version of the Bible and say sure I
[42:54] could use that version of the Bible and
[42:56] still be saved sure enough maybe you
[42:58] could but can you actually be in the
[43:00] Rapture as the Bride of Jesus Christ by
[43:03] rejecting anything that the prophet said
[43:06] I don't know I personally would say
[43:08] that's pretty Shaky Ground you're going
[43:09] out on a limb there
[43:11] but
[43:15] anyways brother bradam I'm just going to
[43:17] read this again now he has cried to out
[43:18] to this last age you have the word you
[43:20] have more Bibles than ever but you're
[43:22] not doing anything about the word except
[43:24] dividing and hacking it into pieces
[43:27] taking what you want and leaving out
[43:29] what you don't want you are not
[43:31] interested in living it but debating
[43:36] it I would sooner you were cold or hot
[43:41] if you were cold and rejected it I could
[43:43] stand that if you would get white hot to
[43:47] know its truth and live it I would
[43:50] praise you for that but when you simply
[43:53] take my word and don't honor it I in
[43:56] return turn must refuse to honor
[44:00] you my I will spew you out for you
[44:05] nauseate me who would want to nauseate
[44:09] God Almighty
[44:12] wow now anybody knows that it is
[44:15] lukewarm water that makes you sick at
[44:17] the
[44:19] stomach if you need an emedic lukewarm
[44:23] water is about the best thing to drink a
[44:27] lukewarm church has made God sick and he
[44:30] has declared he will spew it out reminds
[44:34] us how he felt just before the flood
[44:37] doesn't
[44:39] it oh would to God the church were cold
[44:42] or hot best of all she should be fervent
[44:46] hot but she is not sentence has been
[44:50] passed she is no longer God's voice to
[44:52] the
[44:53] world she will maintain that she is
[44:57] but God says not I remember when I first
[45:00] started coming around I heard brother
[45:02] Ken Boer preach and and he talked about
[45:05] this that it would be better that you
[45:08] were either cold all the way or hot
[45:11] because of what the word says I couldn't
[45:13] believe it when I heard that and
[45:14] actually caught a bit of a revelation
[45:16] about that God would prefer that we were
[45:19] actually one or the other but because
[45:21] we're lukewarm my I say Lord don't let
[45:23] us get
[45:25] lukewarm oh God God still has a voice
[45:28] for the people of the world even as he
[45:30] has given a voice to the bride amen that
[45:34] voice is in the Bride As we have said
[45:37] and we will talk more about that later
[45:40] that's exciting news I'm excited to get
[45:42] there now the second he says because
[45:45] thou sayest I am rich and increased with
[45:47] goods and have need of nothing and
[45:49] knowest not that thou art wretched and
[45:51] miserable and poor and blind and
[45:53] naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[45:56] Tri in the fire that thou mayest be rich
[46:00] and white rayment that thou mayest be
[46:02] clothed and that the shame of thy
[46:03] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[46:06] eyes with isav that thou mayest see
[46:10] isn't it beautiful in Revelations 3:17
[46:12] to18 that he not only just pronounces
[46:15] the the the symptoms but he pronounces
[46:17] The Cure he gives you the Cure and and
[46:21] there's no way that cure will actually
[46:22] work outside of like we speak about on
[46:24] Sunday spiritual revelation Revelation
[46:27] by the spirit it's going to take
[46:30] Revelation by the spirit to actually
[46:32] understand what those verses mean amen
[46:34] going on he says now look at the first
[46:36] phrase of this verse because thou sayest
[46:39] see they were speaking they were talking
[46:42] as the mouthpiece of God the this proves
[46:45] exactly what I said verses 16117 meant
[46:50] but though they say it that does not
[46:52] make it right and we know that's the
[46:55] propaganda machine just continually say
[46:57] it just keep saying it and eventually
[46:59] everyone will just buy into it if you
[47:01] just keep saying it that's what the
[47:02] media Outlets do just keep saying the
[47:05] same thing it doesn't matter whether
[47:06] it's true or false just keep saying it
[47:08] the more you say it the more they hear
[47:09] it the more they'll like it that's
[47:11] exactly what the radios do with music a
[47:14] new song gets released and they pay big
[47:16] money to get it on the radio stations
[47:19] and they just keep playing and playing
[47:20] and playing and many times I know when I
[47:23] was in the world I'd hear a song and I'd
[47:24] think man that's a weird song I don't
[47:27] really dig that song but then after a
[47:29] month or so I'd be like oh yeah that's
[47:31] that song and before long I'd be you
[47:33] know moving with that
[47:35] song initially my reaction was I don't
[47:38] like it but that's just human nature
[47:39] Satan knows exactly how to get through
[47:43] but though they say it that does not
[47:45] make it right just because everyone's
[47:46] saying it doesn't mean it's right the
[47:48] Catholic Church says she speaks for God
[47:51] saying she is the assured voice of the
[47:53] Lord but how many people can be so
[47:56] spiritually Wicked is more than I
[48:00] know but they produce according to the
[48:03] seed which is in them and we know where
[48:06] that seed came from don't we
[48:09] o
[48:11] burn the leod dean church is saying I am
[48:14] rich and increased with goods and have
[48:16] need of nothing that was her
[48:19] self-estimate she looked at herself and
[48:22] that was what she saw she said I am rich
[48:25] which means that she is wealthy in the
[48:28] things of this world she is boasting in
[48:32] the face of James chapter 2 verses 5 to7
[48:36] hearken my beloved Brethren hath not God
[48:40] chosen the poor of this world rich in
[48:43] faith and HS of the Kingdom which he
[48:46] hath promised to them that love him but
[48:49] ye have despised the poor do not the
[48:52] rich do not rich men oppress you and
[48:55] draw you before the judge judgement
[48:57] seats do not they blaspheme that worthy
[49:01] Name by the which you are
[49:03] called now I do not suggest that a rich
[49:08] person cannot be
[49:10] spiritual but we all know what the world
[49:13] says very few are it is the poor that
[49:17] predominate in the body of the true
[49:21] church now then if the church becomes
[49:23] full of wealth we know only one thing
[49:26] thing this is hard kabad and remember
[49:31] that word means the spirit of the Lord
[49:34] has
[49:34] departed kabod and I I think it's
[49:38] important I'm going to put this in here
[49:39] as well brothers and sisters there's
[49:42] nothing wrong with having wealth but
[49:44] seek ye first the kingdom of God he will
[49:48] bless us we know many people in the
[49:50] Bible that we're very blessed but we
[49:52] also know many people today that say I
[49:55] just don't want to get a job so I'm
[49:57] going to say I'm going to be spiritual
[49:59] and I'm going to be the person that
[50:00] brother Bram is talking about here and I
[50:02] don't have to work because God's going
[50:04] to bless me the children of Israel had
[50:07] to get out of bed in the
[50:08] morning they had to get out of bed and
[50:11] go to work and so long as they were
[50:13] willing to do that God did the work for
[50:15] them
[50:16] amen but if we're not willing to get out
[50:18] of bed and go to work God can't bless us
[50:20] brothers and sisters and we know it's
[50:22] not about blessing and having all of the
[50:25] spiritual wealth we're not we're not
[50:27] talking about that I'm saying that
[50:29] brother bradam says that it's razor thin
[50:33] it's razor thin it's a paradox we've got
[50:35] to live in this world but not be of this
[50:38] world we have to provide for our
[50:41] families so
[50:44] anyway I do not suggest that a rich
[50:46] person cannot be spiritual but we all
[50:49] know that the word says that very few
[50:51] are it's the poor that predominate in
[50:54] the body of the true church now then if
[50:56] the the church becomes full of wealth we
[50:58] know only one thing kabad has been
[51:02] written over her portals you can't deny
[51:06] that for that is the
[51:08] word talk about wealth in the church why
[51:12] there never has been such a show of
[51:14] wealth the beautiful sanctuaries that
[51:17] are multiplied in number as never before
[51:21] the various groups Vie with each other
[51:24] to see who can build the biggest and the
[51:27] loveliest and they build Education
[51:30] Centers worth unestimated
[51:33] millions and those buildings are used
[51:35] only an hour or two a
[51:39] week now that would not be such a
[51:42] terrible thing but they expect this
[51:45] little time spent by the children in the
[51:48] education plant to take the place of the
[51:51] hours of training supposed to be given
[51:54] in the home
[51:57] I thought he was going to say as I was
[51:59] reading this originally in the church
[52:02] but it's not brothers and sisters
[52:04] judgment starts at the house of the Lord
[52:06] right but we are supposed to train up a
[52:09] child in the way they should go and then
[52:12] they won't depart from
[52:14] it he goes on to say money has poured
[52:16] into the church until different
[52:19] denominations own stocks and bonds
[52:22] factories oil wells insurance companies
[52:26] they they have poured money into welfare
[52:28] and retirement funds now this sounds
[52:31] good but it has become a snare to the
[52:34] ministers for if they decide to leave
[52:37] their group for more light or the love
[52:40] of God their pensions are lost to
[52:43] them but you know I can tell you for
[52:46] sure there would be no greater blessing
[52:48] to one of those men to be able to walk
[52:51] away from that to say you know what
[52:52] forsaking
[52:54] all I take Christ amen
[52:57] to be able to do that would be the
[52:59] greatest blessing ever and there's no
[53:01] doubt that God would bless that person
[53:04] I'd have no doubt about that that's
[53:05] right but it's fear that grips us fear
[53:09] grips us when we want to be able to
[53:10] provide for our
[53:12] families brother BR goes on to say most
[53:14] can't stand this and stay with their
[53:16] pressure
[53:17] groups now don't forget that this is the
[53:20] last age we know that this is the last
[53:22] age because Israel has gone back to
[53:24] Palestine if we believe that he really
[53:27] is coming then there must be something
[53:29] wrong with those people who are building
[53:31] so vastly it makes one think that these
[53:35] people plan on staying here forever or
[53:39] that the coming of Jesus is hundreds of
[53:41] years off and who knows it could be we
[53:45] don't know that we're supposed to just
[53:47] continue on working the way that we do
[53:49] and paying our bills and getting paid
[53:53] and loving our families and going to
[53:55] church putting our shoulders to the
[53:56] wheel we're supposed to just be good
[53:57] Christians right that's what the prophet
[53:59] said good Christian people don't be
[54:01] Fanatics one way or the other just
[54:03] continue on he he he could come tomorrow
[54:06] he could come in a hundred years from
[54:07] now but you know the devil likes to get
[54:10] in the details and say well you know
[54:12] there some people that believe that you
[54:14] know you got to go through the
[54:15] tribulation some are are
[54:17] post-tribulation and some are
[54:19] pre-tribulation and some are midt people
[54:23] I I trust that none of the Believers of
[54:25] this message are anything but pre-trib
[54:28] Believers because the one that's already
[54:31] judged doesn't need to be judged we
[54:34] don't need to judge our wives once we
[54:36] marry them we marry our wives and then
[54:39] we love our wives and the the the the
[54:43] weddings here on Earth are just a
[54:44] natural type of what actually happen
[54:47] spiritually so beautiful he goes on to
[54:49] say do you know that Religion Today is
[54:52] known as Big Business it is an absolute
[54:56] fact fact that they are placing business
[54:58] managers in the churches to take care of
[55:02] the
[55:03] finances this is what is this what God
[55:07] desires did not his word teach us in the
[55:09] book of Acts that seven Men full of the
[55:12] Holy Ghost and Faith serve the Lord in
[55:16] business matters you can surely see why
[55:19] God said you
[55:20] must you say you are wealthy I never
[55:24] said so there are radio programs
[55:27] television programs and I can tell you
[55:30] from my experience seeing the television
[55:32] programs I've said it many times see a
[55:34] tell evangelist calling for money
[55:37] begging for money send us money then God
[55:39] will bless you it's terrible but it's
[55:41] it's true it's very much real and the
[55:44] numerous Church Endeavors that are
[55:46] costing millions and millions of dollars
[55:49] wealth Pours and pours into the church
[55:52] that membership increases along with the
[55:55] money yet the work is not being done as
[55:57] it was done when there was no money but
[56:01] men rested solely on the ability given
[56:03] to them by the Holy
[56:05] Ghost there are paid preachers paid
[56:08] assistants paid Ministers of music and
[56:11] education paid choirs paid custodians
[56:15] programs and entertainment all costing
[56:18] great sums but for all that the power is
[56:24] decreasing we know brother bradam says
[56:26] that people in the last days will trade
[56:29] power for
[56:32] programs yes the church is Rich but the
[56:34] power is not there God moves by his
[56:38] Spirit not by the amount of money or
[56:41] talent in the church that's why I think
[56:44] it's so beautiful we can't allow
[56:47] politics to dictate how the church is
[56:49] going to be run as soon as we do that we
[56:51] start to fall slip into this category
[56:54] here he goes on to say now now I want to
[56:56] show you how diabolical this urge for
[57:00] money has become my the churches have
[57:05] gone all out to get a membership
[57:07] especially of the
[57:09] wealthy
[57:10] everywhere there is the cry to make
[57:13] religion so attractive and appealing
[57:16] that the rich and cultured and all who
[57:18] have worldly Prestige will come in and
[57:21] be active in the
[57:23] church can't they understand
[57:26] that if wealth is the Criterion of
[57:29] spirituality then the world already has
[57:32] God has all of God and the church has
[57:37] nothing what a comparison such a simple
[57:40] comparison but powerful thou sayest I am
[57:44] increased with Goods this literally
[57:45] means I have spiritual riches this
[57:48] sounds like the Millennium with streets
[57:51] of gold and the presence of God but I
[57:53] wonder if this is so is the church truly
[57:58] rich in the spiritual things of God let
[58:01] us examine this 20th century leod and
[58:05] boast in the light of the
[58:08] word if the church were truly
[58:12] spiritually Rich its influence would be
[58:15] felt upon community life but exactly
[58:20] what kind of lives are these so-called
[58:23] spiritual and influential men of the
[58:26] community
[58:28] living out in Suburbia out in the better
[58:31] class districts there abounds wife
[58:34] swapping prostitution and bands of
[58:37] children crashing parties exactly a
[58:40] terrible toll in property damage
[58:43] immorality has reached an all-time high
[58:46] in promiscuous sex acts narcotic
[58:49] addiction gambling stealing and all
[58:52] kinds of evil isn't it bizarre that he
[58:56] would be talking about all of those
[58:58] things in the same paragraph he's
[59:00] talking about the
[59:03] church
[59:05] why I mean even coming from the world I
[59:08] never would have thought all of that
[59:09] would be lumped together to me that's
[59:11] shocking and the church goes on claiming
[59:14] how fine this
[59:16] generation how fine is this generation
[59:18] how full are the churches and how
[59:21] responsive are even the natives on the
[59:24] mission fields
[59:26] they get
[59:27] results the church has turned the people
[59:30] over to the doctors especially the
[59:33] psychiatrists how can it Pratt about
[59:36] being rich spiritually is more than I
[59:39] know it isn't true they are bankrupt and
[59:43] don't know it you know brother bradam
[59:46] uses this this dialogue a little bit in
[59:50] here as he goes forward they are
[59:51] bankrupt and don't know it I had never
[59:54] thought of it that way I heard actually
[59:55] brother brother Eugene Braun talk about
[59:57] this the first time I ever heard it and
[59:59] uh you know if we're not willing to make
[1:00:02] investments
[1:00:03] spiritually we can't go and withdraw
[1:00:06] spiritually we can try but our bank
[1:00:09] account spiritually is going to be empty
[1:00:10] if we have a marriage and we don't
[1:00:12] invest in our marriage we can't expect
[1:00:16] to see returns coming out of our
[1:00:18] marriage if we don't have a relationship
[1:00:21] and the same thing with our children if
[1:00:22] we're not willing to invest in our
[1:00:24] children we're not going to see that
[1:00:27] return come out of our family the way
[1:00:29] that we think we should we need to make
[1:00:31] sure that we have the right investment
[1:00:33] and spiritually speaking this is
[1:00:36] powerful we don't want to be spiritually
[1:00:39] bankrupt he goes on to say take a good
[1:00:41] look around you examine the people as
[1:00:42] they walk by in the multitudes you see
[1:00:46] can you pick out those that have the
[1:00:48] appearance of
[1:00:49] Christians watch how they dress watch
[1:00:51] how they act hear what they say and see
[1:00:54] where they go every once in a while you
[1:00:56] find people and you can say that must be
[1:01:00] a type of a Christian right there and
[1:01:02] usually it's the women isn't it because
[1:01:04] they're displaying Holiness they have
[1:01:06] long hair you can see they have long
[1:01:07] hair and they have long garments they're
[1:01:09] wearing dresses it's
[1:01:12] different watch how they dress watch how
[1:01:15] they act hear what they see and see
[1:01:17] where they go surely there ought to be
[1:01:20] some real evidence of the new birth
[1:01:22] amongst all those we see go by but few
[1:01:27] there be today the fundamental churches
[1:01:31] are telling us they have millions saved
[1:01:34] and even spirit
[1:01:36] filled spirit
[1:01:39] filled can you call woman spirit filled
[1:01:43] who go around with frizzy bobbed hair
[1:01:45] shorts and slacks halters and briefs all
[1:01:50] painted up like
[1:01:51] Jezebel if these are adorned in modest
[1:01:55] appar
[1:01:56] apparel as becometh Christian woman I
[1:01:59] would hate to think what it would be
[1:02:01] like if I had to witness a display of
[1:02:05] immodesty
[1:02:08] wow now I know that the women don't set
[1:02:12] the Styles Hollywood does that but
[1:02:15] listen ladies they still sell Yard Goods
[1:02:18] and sewing
[1:02:20] machines you don't have to buy what's in
[1:02:22] the
[1:02:23] stores and then use that as an excuse
[1:02:28] exuse this is a deadly serious matter
[1:02:30] that I'm going
[1:02:33] into have you not read in Scripture that
[1:02:35] when a man looks on a woman and lust
[1:02:38] after her in his
[1:02:40] heart he has already committed adultery
[1:02:43] with her in his
[1:02:45] heart and suppose you dressed in such a
[1:02:48] way as to cause
[1:02:50] that that makes you his partner in sin
[1:02:54] even though you would be absolutely
[1:02:57] unaware of it being a true virgin with
[1:03:00] no such
[1:03:02] desires yet god holds you accountable
[1:03:05] and you will be
[1:03:07] judged that is powerful it's amazing
[1:03:11] because you know I I just I'm going to
[1:03:14] say it we preached on this a little
[1:03:16] while ago we should be able to come to
[1:03:17] church and not have to have fear of
[1:03:20] encountering something that's going to
[1:03:22] draw a man's eye the red-blooded male
[1:03:25] has been created
[1:03:26] thus to have the desire to look and it
[1:03:30] behooves the sisters to heed the words
[1:03:32] written right here to make sure that
[1:03:34] we're dressing appropriately to not
[1:03:37] Garner something like that to
[1:03:39] happen but you know it's not the women
[1:03:42] necessarily in total the men have
[1:03:45] responsibility as well and I just want
[1:03:48] to say this Brothers Brothers
[1:03:50] specifically and sisters because they're
[1:03:52] listening you know if God will hold the
[1:03:54] sister this accountable
[1:03:56] how accountable will the men be
[1:03:59] held he's not just going to take the
[1:04:01] sisters and and throw them into the fire
[1:04:04] he's got equal judgment he's a just
[1:04:06] God if the woman is going to be judged
[1:04:09] that hard or or that straight then I
[1:04:13] would say for sure the men will be
[1:04:16] also so we need to know where we
[1:04:19] stand I think this is so good to hear it
[1:04:22] we need to know it's it's like we spoke
[1:04:24] about on Sunday about you know we can
[1:04:26] have a a a a perceived expectation
[1:04:29] without ever communicating it a and
[1:04:31] maybe we start to get upset or get mad
[1:04:33] because maybe something isn't happening
[1:04:35] the way that we think that it should
[1:04:37] sometimes we see that in families we see
[1:04:38] it in marriages we can see it in work
[1:04:40] relationships we can see it in friend
[1:04:41] relationships we can see it in in church
[1:04:45] uh Church existence we can see it all
[1:04:48] over the place but the thing is we need
[1:04:50] to communicate and isn't it wonderful
[1:04:52] that we serve a just God that would
[1:04:54] actually make sure this point
[1:04:56] specifically so specifically is
[1:04:58] communicated to us in the age in which
[1:05:00] we live it's so incredibly
[1:05:06] important
[1:05:09] my brother Bram he goes on to say now I
[1:05:12] know you ladies don't like this kind of
[1:05:14] preaching but sister you were dead wrong
[1:05:17] in what you were
[1:05:18] doing if your hair is cut you're wearing
[1:05:21] makeup you're wearing shorts you're you
[1:05:24] know you're you're fitting the bill of
[1:05:26] what he described there he says the
[1:05:27] Bible forbids you to cut your hair God
[1:05:29] gave it for a covering he gave a command
[1:05:32] for you to wear it long it's your glory
[1:05:36] when you cut your hair you signified
[1:05:40] that you left the headship of your
[1:05:43] husband like Eve you walked out and went
[1:05:47] on your
[1:05:48] own you got the
[1:05:50] vote you took men's jobs you left off
[1:05:54] being female
[1:05:56] you ought to repent and come back to God
[1:05:59] and this is
[1:06:00] so opposite of this world my and if all
[1:06:06] this wasn't bad enough a whole lot of
[1:06:08] you took the idea that you could invade
[1:06:11] the pulpits and the church offices that
[1:06:14] God reserved for men and for men only
[1:06:18] now remember we said this a little bit
[1:06:19] earlier just because everyone's saying
[1:06:21] it just because everyone's doing it
[1:06:23] doesn't mean it's right it's correct
[1:06:25] according to the word of God right and
[1:06:28] the more we see it it doesn't mean that
[1:06:31] it's
[1:06:34] right Oh my he says oh I touched a sore
[1:06:37] spot then didn't I well show me one
[1:06:40] place in the Bible that God ever
[1:06:41] ordained a woman to preach or take
[1:06:44] authority over a man and I will
[1:06:47] apologize for what I have said you can't
[1:06:50] find that I'm wrong I'm right for I
[1:06:54] stand with the word
[1:06:56] and in the word if you were spiritually
[1:06:59] Rich you would know that's
[1:07:01] true there's nothing true but the word
[1:07:04] Paul said in 1 Timothy 2:12 I suffer not
[1:07:08] a woman to teach nor to usurp authority
[1:07:12] over the man now I know you can go a
[1:07:15] little bit further and that's where the
[1:07:17] churches take it and they say that well
[1:07:20] they're supposed to communicate and and
[1:07:22] it gets slippery and they take the
[1:07:24] scripture and they they bend it to to
[1:07:26] suit their their ideologies but just
[1:07:29] because everyone is saying it it doesn't
[1:07:31] matter Paul said it and that's what we
[1:07:32] believe and I think that's so beautiful
[1:07:34] there has to be a benchmark and we know
[1:07:36] that at the beginning of this book Paul
[1:07:38] was the first age messenger he set the
[1:07:40] pattern for every every Church age
[1:07:43] coming after amen he goes on to say you
[1:07:47] can't possibly take a place amongst the
[1:07:49] five-fold ministry of Ephesians 4 and
[1:07:53] not take authority over men
[1:07:56] sister you had better listen to that
[1:07:59] word it was not the spirit of God
[1:08:02] manifesting in a spirit filled life that
[1:08:04] told you to preach because the spirit
[1:08:08] and the word are one amen they say the
[1:08:12] same
[1:08:14] thing that's why when you see someone
[1:08:17] claiming that they've got a revelation
[1:08:18] from God and it's contrary to the word
[1:08:20] of God you know that's not of
[1:08:22] God and it's terrible because sometimes
[1:08:25] you see it and you have to scratch your
[1:08:26] head and you know I don't think it's
[1:08:28] really necessary for us to make sure
[1:08:30] that every single time we encounter that
[1:08:32] that we we get ready for a fight to say
[1:08:36] that I know I'm right just like brother
[1:08:37] bradam said he knew that he was right he
[1:08:39] knew where he stood we know where we
[1:08:41] stand the bride knows the word the word
[1:08:43] is in the bride and she has thus sayith
[1:08:46] the Lord but she doesn't have to
[1:08:48] actually battle she doesn't have to
[1:08:49] fight the word does the fighting the
[1:08:51] word does the Discerning the word does
[1:08:53] the dividing between the the soul and
[1:08:55] the spirit it's not up to us to to worry
[1:08:58] about that it's just up to us to worry
[1:09:01] about being in the
[1:09:02] word he said you can't possibly take the
[1:09:04] place among the five-fold ministry of
[1:09:06] Ephesians 4 and not take authority over
[1:09:08] men sister you'd better listen to that
[1:09:11] word it was not the spirit of God
[1:09:14] manifesting in a Spirit-filled life that
[1:09:17] told you to preach because the spirit
[1:09:20] and the word are one they say the same
[1:09:24] thing amen somebody made a
[1:09:27] mistake somebody was fooled isn't it
[1:09:31] interesting how he puts these words in
[1:09:32] there he says somebody made a mistake
[1:09:34] somebody was fooled he he's given them a
[1:09:36] way out it's so important to make sure
[1:09:38] that we have a way
[1:09:40] out let God do the Sorting it's not up
[1:09:43] to us to sort people out that way they
[1:09:45] made a mistake they were fooled so wake
[1:09:48] up before it's too
[1:09:50] late Satan fooled Eve and you know Satan
[1:09:54] would never
[1:09:56] ever have been able to fool Eve if she
[1:09:59] would have remained in her
[1:10:01] husband if she remained even in her
[1:10:05] husband's word she would never have been
[1:10:07] able to be fooled but as soon as she
[1:10:09] started to deviate from the word of her
[1:10:12] husband just like us as soon as we start
[1:10:14] to deviate away from the word of our
[1:10:16] husband
[1:10:19] uhoh I just love this though somebody
[1:10:21] made a mistake someone was fooled just
[1:10:23] wake up before it's too late Satan
[1:10:26] fooled Eve your mother he's fooling the
[1:10:28] daughters now may God help
[1:10:31] you I have need of nothing now when
[1:10:34] anybody says I have need of nothing he
[1:10:37] could very well be saying I have
[1:10:39] everything or he could be saying I don't
[1:10:42] want anymore as I am full now you can
[1:10:47] express this any way you want and it all
[1:10:50] adds up to the fact that the church is
[1:10:53] complacent
[1:10:56] she's satisfied with what she has she
[1:10:59] either figures she has it all or has
[1:11:03] enough and that is exactly what we find
[1:11:06] today which denomination is not claiming
[1:11:09] that it has the Revelation and the power
[1:11:13] and The Truth Listen to The
[1:11:17] Baptists and they have it all listen to
[1:11:20] the Methodist and they have it all am
[1:11:22] listen to the Church of Christ and
[1:11:24] everyone is wrong but them here what the
[1:11:28] Pentecostals say and they have the
[1:11:30] fullness of the
[1:11:32] fullness now they know I am telling the
[1:11:35] truth about them for not one of their
[1:11:37] manuals say any different they wrote it
[1:11:41] all out just so nice and put their names
[1:11:45] to it and finished it all up God just
[1:11:49] doesn't have
[1:11:51] anymore and there are those who just
[1:11:53] don't want
[1:11:56] anymore they do not believe in healing
[1:11:59] and would not want it although it is in
[1:12:02] the word I just can't help but think
[1:12:05] about that woman that was in the
[1:12:07] hospital when brother Brandon went to
[1:12:08] pray for that that other person there
[1:12:10] and and he said can we pray and and as
[1:12:14] he went to pray that woman said pull
[1:12:17] that
[1:12:18] curtain pull that curtain she was all
[1:12:20] upset because he was going to pray and
[1:12:23] and he was shocked and it shocking
[1:12:25] because there's some people they stay so
[1:12:27] firm in their beliefs there there's no
[1:12:31] flexibility and their ability to be able
[1:12:33] to just accept the word for their
[1:12:35] day like we said on Sunday I believe it
[1:12:38] was Sunday that God's going to be
[1:12:39] revealing himself throughout eternity
[1:12:41] man there's nobody that can come to the
[1:12:43] place that could say on Earth on this
[1:12:45] side of Eternity that I've got it all
[1:12:46] I've got enough there's never going to
[1:12:48] be enough we're always going to want
[1:12:51] more they do not believe in healing and
[1:12:54] would not want it although it is in the
[1:12:56] word there are those who would not take
[1:12:59] the Holy Spirit if God opened the
[1:13:01] heavens and showed them a sign can you
[1:13:04] believe
[1:13:06] that now they are all saying and trying
[1:13:09] to prove that they have it all or they
[1:13:12] have enough yet is that the truth
[1:13:15] compare this 20th century Church to the
[1:13:19] first century Church go ahead do that
[1:13:22] where's the power where's the love
[1:13:26] where's the purified church that with
[1:13:29] stod sin and walked with faith toward
[1:13:32] Jesus huh where's the
[1:13:35] unity I I know that when you start to
[1:13:38] see Discord and and not Unity my I would
[1:13:44] say
[1:13:45] leoan he says you can't find it if this
[1:13:48] church has all it needs why were they
[1:13:50] crying out for more of God in the book
[1:13:53] of Acts as though they didn't have it
[1:13:55] all and yet they had far more than they
[1:13:58] have
[1:14:00] today he goes on to say God's
[1:14:03] diagnosis now what God saw was entirely
[1:14:06] different from what they said they
[1:14:09] saw they said that they were rich in
[1:14:12] goods and spiritually wealthy they had
[1:14:17] arrived they had need of
[1:14:20] nothing but God saw it otherwise he said
[1:14:23] you don't know this but you are wretched
[1:14:25] miserable poor blind and naked now when
[1:14:29] a people are that way especially naked
[1:14:32] and don't know it there has to be
[1:14:34] something awfully
[1:14:36] wrong surely something must be
[1:14:41] happening it's not that God has blinded
[1:14:44] their eyes as he did the
[1:14:46] Jews is the gospel going back to the
[1:14:49] Jews is history repeating itself I say
[1:14:52] it is and we know we say it all all the
[1:14:55] time just any day now CNN and Fox News
[1:14:59] and all the AL all the news outlets
[1:15:02] they're going to be posting on their
[1:15:04] websites live coverage of two witnesses
[1:15:07] in Israel they're going to see
[1:15:11] it we know the gospel is going back to
[1:15:13] the
[1:15:15] Jews God says this church of the Leo
[1:15:18] Dean age is wretched and that word comes
[1:15:21] from two Greek words which means in
[1:15:25] endure and
[1:15:26] trial and it has nothing to do with the
[1:15:28] trials that come to a true Christian for
[1:15:31] God describes a Christian in trial as
[1:15:34] blessed and his attitude one of
[1:15:38] Joy whereas this description is phrased
[1:15:42] as wretched and miserable my how strange
[1:15:46] in this age of Plenty in this age of
[1:15:49] progress in this age of abundance How
[1:15:52] can there be trials
[1:15:55] well now it is strange but in this age
[1:16:00] of Plenty and
[1:16:02] opportunity when everyone has so much
[1:16:06] and there is so much more to be
[1:16:09] had what with all the inventions to do
[1:16:12] our work and so many things to give us
[1:16:15] pleasure
[1:16:16] suddenly we find mental illness taking
[1:16:19] such a toll as to alarm the
[1:16:23] nation when everybody ought to be happy
[1:16:27] with really nothing to be unhappy
[1:16:30] about millions are taking sedatives at
[1:16:33] night pep pills in the morning rushing
[1:16:36] to doctors entering institutions and
[1:16:39] trying to drown out unknown fears by
[1:16:44] alcohol yes this age boasts of its
[1:16:48] tremendous stores of worldly
[1:16:51] Goods but the people are less happy than
[1:16:54] ever
[1:16:56] isn't that true you look around the
[1:16:59] world and you see
[1:17:00] people same countries fighting one
[1:17:04] another total opposition to one another
[1:17:07] because of political views to the place
[1:17:09] where they want to fight they want to
[1:17:11] harm one another but they're Brothers
[1:17:14] they're Sisters of the same
[1:17:21] Nation we know that it's supposed to be
[1:17:23] that way the word of God says
[1:17:26] it
[1:17:31] my this age boasts of its spiritual
[1:17:34] attainments but the people are less sure
[1:17:37] of themselves than
[1:17:38] ever this age boasts of better moral
[1:17:41] values and it's more corrupt than any
[1:17:45] age since the
[1:17:47] flood it talks about its knowledge and
[1:17:51] science but it's fighting a losing
[1:17:53] battle in all fields
[1:17:55] for the human mind and soul and spirit
[1:18:00] cannot comprehend or even keep apress
[1:18:03] with all the changes that have come upon
[1:18:06] the Earth in one
[1:18:09] generation we have gone all the way from
[1:18:12] the horse and buggy age to the Space Age
[1:18:16] and we are proud and boastful about it
[1:18:20] but inside is a Dark Void Cavern that is
[1:18:23] crying out in torment and without a
[1:18:27] known reason men's hearts are failing
[1:18:29] for fear and the world is so darkened
[1:18:32] that this age could well be called the
[1:18:34] age of
[1:18:36] neurotics and we know one of the biggest
[1:18:41] biggest businesses on Earth today is Big
[1:18:45] Pharma all of the drugs that are
[1:18:47] prescribed to people and I don't know
[1:18:49] what the percentage is someone here
[1:18:50] probably might know more than I but I
[1:18:54] can imagine that the psychological
[1:18:56] aspect of drugs to treat people for
[1:18:59] depression anti-depressants all of those
[1:19:02] things that we read about here is
[1:19:04] probably a humongous percentage of that
[1:19:07] in big
[1:19:09] Pharma but it's the age we live
[1:19:12] in just kick God out and see what
[1:19:14] happens hey it boasts but it cannot come
[1:19:18] back it cries peace and there is no
[1:19:21] peace it cries that it has a great
[1:19:24] amplitude of all things but it keeps
[1:19:26] burning with desire like an unsatisfied
[1:19:30] fire there is no peace saith God to the
[1:19:33] wicked Isaiah
[1:19:35] 57:21 they are
[1:19:38] miserable that means they are objects to
[1:19:40] be
[1:19:41] pied
[1:19:44] pied they scorn
[1:19:46] pity they are full of
[1:19:49] Pride they VA what they have but what
[1:19:53] they have will not stand the test of
[1:19:56] time they have built upon quick sand
[1:20:00] rather than the rock of revelation of
[1:20:03] God's
[1:20:04] word soon cometh the earthquake soon
[1:20:08] there will be the storms of wrath of God
[1:20:10] in judgment then come sudden destruction
[1:20:13] and in spite of all their carnal
[1:20:15] preparation they will still be
[1:20:17] unprepared for what comes upon the
[1:20:22] Earth they are those who in spite of all
[1:20:25] their worldly efforts are actually
[1:20:29] opposing themselves and don't know
[1:20:33] it objects of pity they are indeed pity
[1:20:37] the poor people who are in this last
[1:20:41] day in this last day ecumenical move for
[1:20:44] they call it the move of God when it is
[1:20:47] of Satan you know brothers and sisters
[1:20:49] if you just go I think I talked about it
[1:20:51] on Sunday but I can't get away from this
[1:20:53] if you listen to Satan's Eden brother
[1:20:56] Brenham talks in there about how the
[1:20:58] people will be be having wonderful
[1:21:00] worship Services they'll be having
[1:21:01] tremendous
[1:21:03] praise and not realize that they're
[1:21:06] worshiping actually worshiping
[1:21:09] Satan they'll have wonderful music
[1:21:12] wonderful programs wonderful choirs all
[1:21:15] the while worshiping the devil can you
[1:21:17] believe it when I was growing up in the
[1:21:19] world I always thought the the Church of
[1:21:21] Satan was the only place to worship
[1:21:24] Satan
[1:21:25] I come to find out that God sent a
[1:21:26] prophet and said no no it'll be in
[1:21:29] churches they'll be in churches thinking
[1:21:31] they're worshiping God when they're
[1:21:33] actually worshiping the devil shocking
[1:21:36] pity them brothers and sisters pity
[1:21:38] those who do not know the curse of
[1:21:40] organization pity those who have so many
[1:21:43] beautiful churches such lovely
[1:21:45] parsonages such grandly trained choirs
[1:21:48] such a show of wealth and such a sedate
[1:21:52] and reverent form of worship
[1:21:55] just say Amen in one of those churches
[1:21:57] sometime when the preaching's going on
[1:21:59] pity them don't envy them back to the
[1:22:02] old store buildings back to the dimly
[1:22:04] lit rooms back to the cellers back to
[1:22:06] the less of the world and more of God
[1:22:10] pity those who make their great claims
[1:22:12] and talk about their gifts feel for them
[1:22:15] as objects of pity for soon they will be
[1:22:18] objects of Wrath and you know brothers
[1:22:21] and sisters I can't help but think you
[1:22:23] know when when you look around in this
[1:22:25] world you can't help but actually sigh
[1:22:28] and cry for the Abominations in the land
[1:22:30] it I personally believe it's not
[1:22:32] necessarily the lgbtq thing it's not all
[1:22:35] of the sinful things that are going on
[1:22:37] in this world it's the people that think
[1:22:39] they're worshiping God but are truly
[1:22:41] worshiping Satan they genuinely want to
[1:22:44] do right but don't know it brother
[1:22:48] Brandon preaches it and knoweth it not
[1:22:52] my paragraph 20 here they are poor now
[1:22:56] of course that means spiritually poor
[1:23:00] and go back to that word bankrupt again
[1:23:03] they haven't actually been able to
[1:23:05] invest properly it's beautiful brother
[1:23:08] brandham preaches Investments as one of
[1:23:09] the last
[1:23:10] messages they have to invest properly if
[1:23:13] you don't invest properly you're not
[1:23:15] going to get the right return these
[1:23:16] people are not going to get the right
[1:23:18] return that's why they're to be pied
[1:23:20] it's not about being boastful and it's
[1:23:22] not about being puffed up true
[1:23:23] revelation and causes humility in a real
[1:23:26] believer and causes them to sigh and cry
[1:23:29] brother branam says that's one of the
[1:23:31] signs of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:33] being able to sigh and cry for the
[1:23:35] Abominations in the land he says they're
[1:23:39] poor now of course that means
[1:23:41] spiritually poor or bankrupt the sign of
[1:23:44] this age as it closes is bigger and
[1:23:47] better churches with more and more
[1:23:50] people with more and more
[1:23:52] manifestation of what is supposed to be
[1:23:56] demonstrations of the Holy
[1:24:00] Ghost but the filled altars the gifts of
[1:24:03] the Spirit in operation the remarkable
[1:24:05] attendance is not the answer from God
[1:24:09] for those who come to the altars very
[1:24:11] seldom stay to go on with God they have
[1:24:14] just an experience and you know I I
[1:24:16] can't help but think that's what my
[1:24:18] pastor used to preach about with a camp
[1:24:20] experience you can go and get caught up
[1:24:22] in the emotion of it and then come back
[1:24:25] home and actually just slip back into
[1:24:27] the position you were once
[1:24:29] in and that's not what the camp
[1:24:32] experience is all about the camp
[1:24:34] experience is about going and making
[1:24:36] friends and drawing closer to God to
[1:24:38] grow spiritually that's what God is
[1:24:40] interested in our lives and you know I I
[1:24:43] just can't help but tell that story one
[1:24:45] more time that I heard an evangelist
[1:24:48] talk about how a guy came in a prayer
[1:24:50] line and said you know when I was young
[1:24:51] I was 16 years old I went to a camp and
[1:24:54] something happened to me I know
[1:24:55] something happened to me in a prayer
[1:24:57] line and I went home and I was so
[1:24:59] excited and I told all the people about
[1:25:01] something happening to me and they all
[1:25:02] said oh it's all just emotion you had a
[1:25:05] camp experience forget about it don't do
[1:25:07] it those people get all hung up on all
[1:25:10] that stuff you just continue on with the
[1:25:12] way we do things here forget about that
[1:25:14] and you know the man went 40 years in
[1:25:16] his life to a prayer line to an
[1:25:19] evangelist for the spirit of God to tell
[1:25:21] that man you know what happened there is
[1:25:23] you got the whole Holy Ghost you've had
[1:25:25] the Holy Ghost your whole life and the
[1:25:27] devil tried to tell you that you don't
[1:25:28] have the Holy Ghost so you fought your
[1:25:31] whole entire life looking for something
[1:25:33] you've already
[1:25:35] had don't put God In The Box you can get
[1:25:38] the Holy Ghost at
[1:25:41] camp but just keep feeding them just
[1:25:44] keep feeding
[1:25:46] them
[1:25:51] my for those who come to the altars very
[1:25:53] seldom state to go on with God and after
[1:25:56] the great campaigns are finished where
[1:25:59] they are all those who came down the
[1:26:02] Isles they heard a man they listened to
[1:26:05] an appeal they came into the net but
[1:26:08] they were not fish and turtle like they
[1:26:11] had crawled back to their own
[1:26:13] Waters then there was all this talk
[1:26:16] about
[1:26:18] glossia
[1:26:19] glossolalia
[1:26:21] glossolalia who knows that word
[1:26:25] glossolalia I had never heard it until I
[1:26:27] actually read this book so I I actually
[1:26:30] made sure I I looked it up and brought
[1:26:32] it here it says the phenomenon of
[1:26:36] apparently speaking in an unknown
[1:26:39] language especially in a religious
[1:26:41] worship it is practiced especially by
[1:26:45] Pentecostal and charismatic Christians
[1:26:48] and you don't have to look very far you
[1:26:50] can see people they'll be having a
[1:26:51] conversation they'll they'll be talking
[1:26:53] and then all all of a sudden they'll
[1:26:54] just go off in some unknown language
[1:26:57] gasalia will take over in the
[1:27:00] conversation and you'll be like
[1:27:02] what what what did you just
[1:27:05] say but they just carry on and uh yeah
[1:27:09] there's a term for it colossal Alia I
[1:27:12] hope I'm saying that right it is
[1:27:14] supposed to be the evidence of the
[1:27:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost and people are
[1:27:18] thinking that what we are in the midst
[1:27:20] of a great
[1:27:22] Revival the Revival is over my a
[1:27:26] Vindicated Prophet saying these words
[1:27:30] the Revival is over America had her last
[1:27:34] chance in
[1:27:37] 1957 and I know someone has done it
[1:27:40] there's a video out there but if you
[1:27:41] were to look it up you could go and look
[1:27:43] at what happened after 1957 in terms of
[1:27:46] crime statistics or moral values in
[1:27:49] North America or maybe specifically in
[1:27:51] the United States but Canada and the US
[1:27:54] they're twins they're tied we're tied
[1:27:55] together we're the same as much as we
[1:27:58] don't want to be or or do want to be it
[1:28:00] doesn't matter we're all North Americans
[1:28:02] but if you look at the rate of crime and
[1:28:05] and immorality from this point 1957 I
[1:28:09] saw a video where a brother did this
[1:28:11] might have been Lonnie Jenkins that did
[1:28:13] it but the crime rate is astounding it
[1:28:16] it if you look at a bar graph it just
[1:28:18] goes just about straight up from this
[1:28:20] point in time 1957 just reject God take
[1:28:23] him out and see what happens he says the
[1:28:25] Revival is over America had her last
[1:28:27] chance in 57 now the tongues are God's
[1:28:30] sign of impending
[1:28:34] disaster not of of of Revival the
[1:28:38] tongues are the sign of impending
[1:28:40] disaster my goodness even as they were
[1:28:43] when they appeared upon the wall at
[1:28:45] belshazzar's
[1:28:47] feast and We Know It took a prophet to
[1:28:49] come and actually deal with it didn't
[1:28:53] it and that Prophet was rewarded it's
[1:28:55] amazing he says' don't you know that
[1:28:57] many are going to come in the last day
[1:28:59] and sayl Lord have we not done many
[1:29:01] wonderful Works in thy name even to the
[1:29:04] casting out of
[1:29:05] devils and he will say depart from me ye
[1:29:07] that work iniquity I never knew you and
[1:29:10] remember that word new in the Bible is a
[1:29:13] very intimate experience it is not just
[1:29:18] a knowledge I'll say it this way it was
[1:29:21] it's a perfect
[1:29:22] realization a perfect realization my I
[1:29:26] should probably call the
[1:29:28] musicians don't you know that many are
[1:29:30] going to come in the last day and say
[1:29:32] Lord Lord have we not done many
[1:29:34] wonderful Works in thy name even to the
[1:29:37] casting out of devils and he will say
[1:29:40] depart from me ye that work iniquity I
[1:29:42] never knew you that's Matthew 7:22 to 23
[1:29:45] Jesus said they were workers of iniquity
[1:29:50] knowing that they should do something
[1:29:53] and not doing it
[1:29:54] and knowing not to do something and yet
[1:29:57] doing it workers of
[1:30:01] iniquity yet you get a man that can come
[1:30:04] and pray for the sick get oil and blood
[1:30:07] appearing in the
[1:30:10] congregation excuse me prophecy coming
[1:30:13] forth and all manner of the Supernatural
[1:30:16] and the people will gather around him
[1:30:19] and swear that he is of the Lord e even
[1:30:24] though he is actually making
[1:30:27] money a racket of religion and living in
[1:30:31] sin the only answer they have is the
[1:30:34] absolutely unbiblical answer of well he
[1:30:39] gets results so he must be of
[1:30:42] God how
[1:30:44] terrible how actually poor this age is
[1:30:48] in the spirit of
[1:30:49] God and the poor poverty stricken ones
[1:30:54] don't even know it and we know he's not
[1:30:57] talking about poverty stricken
[1:31:00] financially he's talking
[1:31:02] spiritually maybe stand with me as we
[1:31:05] close
[1:31:06] [Music]
