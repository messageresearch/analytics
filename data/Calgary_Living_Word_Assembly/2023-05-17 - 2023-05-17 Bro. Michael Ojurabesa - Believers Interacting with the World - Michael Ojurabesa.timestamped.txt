[43:18] mind
[43:20] um all right if it will stand together
[43:22] we made this uh evening as we approach
[43:25] the word tonight
[43:29] The Book of Matthew Matthew chapter 10
[43:31] verse 1.
[43:36] because Matthew
[43:38] um
[43:51] look up Matthew chapter 10 always from
[43:53] verse one but let's pray one more time
[43:55] lord Jesus we thank you for this word
[43:57] have given us
[43:58] you have the Revelation in this word we
[44:00] don't have nothing Lord please Lord open
[44:02] this word to us Lord
[44:04] and blessed children father in Jesus
[44:06] name
[44:06] amen
[44:08] because Matthew chapter 10 from verse
[44:10] one I read and he said when he had
[44:12] called unto him his twelve disciples
[44:15] he gave them power against unclean
[44:17] spirits
[44:19] to cast them out and to heal all manner
[44:21] of sicknesses and all man of diseases
[44:23] and if you skip to verse 16 and said
[44:26] behold I send you
[44:28] as sheep in the midst of wolves be a
[44:30] therefore wise as serpents on harmless
[44:34] as those you may be seated while I read
[44:36] the book of Romans 12. Romans chapter 12
[44:39] verse 1.
[44:45] and it says I beseech you from verse 1
[44:49] 12 verse 1 I said I beseech you
[44:50] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[44:52] that ye presents your brothers a Living
[44:55] Sacrifice
[44:56] holy
[44:58] acceptable unto God which is your
[45:00] reasonable service
[45:01] and being unconformed to this word but
[45:04] be ye transformed by the renew of your
[45:05] mind that you may prove what is that
[45:07] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[45:09] God Amen
[45:12] before I go ahead I just want to say if
[45:13] you open a remarks about you know what
[45:16] it means to have a pastor a great pastor
[45:19] um a pastor is one that represent the
[45:21] Lord Jesus Christ as a Good Shepherd
[45:23] amen and he asked a great great role as
[45:26] the father of the house that we all go
[45:27] to for support and strength amen and
[45:31] Bertram said a few things about what a
[45:32] pastor is and he said a few things that
[45:36] I like I said the um
[45:38] um he said
[45:39] um and the sermon Moses 1950 said that
[45:42] that's the reason you're passing
[45:43] sometimes when your pastor comes to you
[45:45] the reason he can't help is
[45:47] you've got to have faith in your pastor
[45:49] you have to believe that he's a man of
[45:50] God so that what I'm trying to say there
[45:52] is that God cannot help you if you don't
[45:55] have trust in your pastor
[45:56] so because see I know he's a man it's
[45:58] fallible but you're going to trust the
[46:00] gift on him especially if he's fitting
[46:02] you with the word and also said in uh uh
[46:05] Believers down me uh paragraph 7-1 I
[46:07] said right there so I noticed you've got
[46:09] to have confidence in the man you you're
[46:11] dealing with or it won't do you any good
[46:14] to do any dealing
[46:16] you've got to believe your pastor
[46:19] he's a good god-saved preaching to go on
[46:22] the gospel
[46:23] and stand behind him with everything you
[46:26] got
[46:27] if he isn't go somewhere else that's the
[46:30] only reason it's given but if he is stay
[46:32] right there
[46:33] that's right now that clears up both
[46:35] sides now remember if you purchase the
[46:37] gospel stay with him help him cause his
[46:40] man sent from God ordained of God to
[46:43] feed your soul
[46:45] so I'm I've I had I've been under the uh
[46:48] um my dad been a passenger and I've been
[46:50] in different churches and you know I
[46:52] just I was talking about the Barrett
[46:53] back there I said the Pastor submission
[46:55] is very important now when you choose
[46:57] the pastor like a church it's like what
[46:59] Abraham said like you can choose another
[47:00] bride it choosing like a junior bride so
[47:02] you got to pray about it when you go to
[47:03] church just go out you like to pass out
[47:06] the way he dresses it's cute or whatever
[47:07] or he's eloquent or it's not a thing
[47:10] it's not like an extra minor minor
[47:12] things the main thing is that it's
[47:14] fitting you with the word of God
[47:15] wholesomely and that's what's going to
[47:17] help you and help your family so if he's
[47:19] not doing that then you can go somewhere
[47:21] else but I say but the battery I love
[47:22] his spirit I met him on Sunday and then
[47:24] I've heard about good things about my
[47:26] brother and my dad and I just met him I
[47:28] just humble man of God and on Sunday all
[47:30] he did was just open the word of God to
[47:33] us and just feed us with it
[47:34] and you know we went we are still in the
[47:36] strength of that going from Sunday and
[47:37] that's what I want you to appreciate
[47:39] that man so much you might not agree
[47:40] with him some things it's all right
[47:42] we're we're all human we have our
[47:43] opinions we respect that position amen
[47:46] give him all the support the needs give
[47:47] him all the respect needs all the prayer
[47:49] that I need sometimes it needs your
[47:51] prayers don't need you an argument oh
[47:52] Pastor I like I know this you might know
[47:54] the ministry is more than him
[47:55] but that doesn't matter
[47:58] pray for him for us to bring him to that
[48:00] position where you are bird brown said
[48:03] when you get the point where you are
[48:04] feeling bigger than a pastor it's time
[48:06] to leave so I want to just want to
[48:08] encourage you to support the Barry and
[48:10] listening to strenu you'll be surprised
[48:11] how much God will bless you I've been a
[48:13] blessing of that everywhere I go I don't
[48:15] I don't know I don't hide myself I
[48:17] support the pastor I give all I can and
[48:18] God has really blessed me for that so
[48:20] please do that my brothers and sisters
[48:21] amen praise the Lord
[48:23] amen so I'm gonna go ahead right quickly
[48:25] and just um to our um um title today uh
[48:31] we're reading from The Book of Matthew
[48:32] 10 verse 1 and verse 16. also Romans 12
[48:37] verse 1 and 2 and I have a little title
[48:39] that God gave me um a couple weeks ago
[48:41] that and I've been you know thinking
[48:43] about on uh Sun On Sunday when Brother
[48:45] Bear asked me I was thinking I had two
[48:47] titles I'm working on and God has been
[48:49] my heart and I was singing God for some
[48:52] science and then he just showed me
[48:53] exactly what he wanted me to do so I I
[48:55] just stay with this right here so I hope
[48:57] it's a blessing to you I was just
[48:58] helping preach everybody okay don't
[49:00] don't be quiet on me just say Amen if
[49:02] you can amen if I'm saying a word just
[49:04] say Amen to thou help me along amen
[49:06] praise the Lord so the little title I
[49:08] have the tonight is Believers
[49:09] interacting with the word
[49:12] Believers interacting with the world and
[49:14] you know we're nowhere in this world we
[49:16] are now of this world but we have to
[49:17] interact with them every day we interact
[49:19] with them at our jobs and our neighbors
[49:21] and even family members that are not
[49:24] Believers and all that stuff but what's
[49:25] important here that I really want to get
[49:27] to First is with the believer
[49:29] who is a Believer that's a question that
[49:31] you can you know ask anybody and it was
[49:33] the real believer like a True Believer
[49:35] and the first thing I you know put down
[49:37] there and I was just you know thinking
[49:39] about is that a Believer is one that
[49:41] accepts receive the goodness which is
[49:44] the word of boy's age you receive that
[49:47] thing first that word first it does not
[49:49] question it it might not understand it
[49:51] but he knows that this is true something
[49:53] down his heart says this is God speaking
[49:56] to me and it goes there and just grab
[49:59] all of it it must start to understand
[50:00] over the years later but at that point
[50:02] in time it's connecting to that word
[50:04] amen and that's remind me of fervation 3
[50:06] 20 when when
[50:08] um John was talking you know in the Book
[50:10] of Revelations three and it was you know
[50:12] the last 10 Church all towards the in
[50:14] and out Los Angeles a church that's
[50:16] miserable blind and think they have it
[50:18] all and they're poor and Jesus said in
[50:20] verse 20 it said
[50:22] how even with all these conditions even
[50:24] all this what's going around I said I
[50:26] was standing at the door and knock
[50:28] it said If any man listen if any man
[50:32] will hear my voice
[50:34] and remember that that man's not he does
[50:37] not hear God's voice by his own power or
[50:39] might or how good it is or how much
[50:41] money he has or how much Acumen
[50:42] intelligence he has that man is able to
[50:45] hear the voice of God because God is
[50:46] inside of him so like the Bible says a
[50:49] deep call into deep God has the power to
[50:52] stimulate your heart your thirst and
[50:54] hunger for God where when it is like I
[50:58] can hear God there's various voices out
[51:00] there the verse voices and they know
[51:02] even women of our own voices but when
[51:05] God's voice come it's different
[51:07] it might not be big it comes the verse
[51:09] till Small Voice and he can
[51:10] differentiate that voice from other
[51:12] voices and like my masses calling me and
[51:14] Jesus said he said if
[51:17] that man hears my voice it didn't stop
[51:20] right there and opens the door
[51:23] when that my whole point of the story
[51:25] said I will come in myself so what makes
[51:27] a Believer is not our big address so how
[51:30] much career you have I have more PhD
[51:31] emeritance that you have or how much
[51:33] wealth you have in this world that's not
[51:35] what makes it believable how much
[51:36] message you know how much you know uh uh
[51:39] uh uh intellectual part of the message
[51:41] that you understand that's not what it's
[51:42] one that accept God's word accept
[51:44] goodness and after I accept it it
[51:47] doesn't stop right there it retracts
[51:48] from some Godly ways and that's most of
[51:50] us have ish you know I've been in that
[51:52] position where some of us are safe from
[51:54] denominations from somewhere Muslims and
[51:56] my dad was with Muslim way back
[51:57] somewhere in the Catholic church and
[51:59] some of us were even born in the message
[52:00] but we're born in Mexico we didn't
[52:02] receive God yet
[52:03] and I'll tell you this if you're a young
[52:05] person right here today we're born in
[52:06] the message I'm invite you your life
[52:09] will never be the same until you meet
[52:10] God and accept him you might strive you
[52:13] might pray you might do whatever you
[52:14] might saying so nice to have good voice
[52:16] player instrument or the more unto you
[52:18] accept God in your life you will never
[52:20] you will never be able to overcome day
[52:22] to day amen so some of us also as young
[52:24] young young children born a message we
[52:27] still were there we are stubbornness to
[52:28] disappear their parents we stole me from
[52:30] the pot we did various things but guess
[52:32] what when God touch Our lives our life
[52:35] changed that we didn't have to tell us
[52:36] no more because we accepted God Amen so
[52:39] you try from Young early ways and then
[52:41] go back to what Paul Peter said in Acts
[52:44] 2 38 and then you repent the word
[52:47] depends means that you're going this way
[52:49] and all of a sudden change direction to
[52:51] another way it's not that you're going
[52:52] this way and say maybe I'll just you
[52:54] know I can do a little bit of the things
[52:55] I used to know the Bible said he said
[52:57] all things that pass away it's all
[52:59] things that become new so there's a
[53:01] repentance axis 38 and the Paul said
[53:03] Peter told him I said repent dear if I'm
[53:05] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[53:06] the remission of your sin and then you
[53:08] shall be filled with the gift of the
[53:09] Holy Spirit now when you see the holy
[53:11] spirit it's not just receiving you can
[53:13] receive and transmit
[53:15] so when you receive not just oh I have
[53:17] to understand just so enjoy it no that
[53:19] believer receives the Holy Spirit and
[53:21] then ability to transmit to another
[53:23] person amen and then like I said
[53:26] repentance means that there's a chain of
[53:28] Direction now that believer we're
[53:30] talking about who's a Believer right now
[53:31] so don't forget about that that believer
[53:33] has a benchmark
[53:35] The Benchmark is that the believer
[53:37] follows only the Master's command
[53:39] you can have other other ideas and I
[53:42] know philosophies all all around him but
[53:45] he follows the Master's command now when
[53:46] I use the world's command people think
[53:47] it's a military term like oh man he's
[53:50] forced to do it he's not forced to do it
[53:51] it's not coerced to do it it's a man in
[53:54] love with the Lord have you seen a man
[53:55] and woman young young lady you know in
[53:57] the church and a young assistant you
[53:59] will fall in love with each other they
[54:00] can't do without each other and Brahma
[54:02] was saying that if you're going to marry
[54:03] a girl make sure that you can make sure
[54:05] you get to a point where you can live a
[54:06] day without her if you still can survive
[54:09] without her you're not in love it but
[54:11] the moment you start like I don't know
[54:12] before I met my wife Jennifer you know
[54:14] we're friends and all of a sudden we
[54:16] just you know keep talking to them and
[54:18] then there's a point out I was like man
[54:19] I just can't do my day without her I
[54:21] would do 12 hours on the phone and
[54:22] because I was in love with a girl and
[54:25] that's how that's how it is in the
[54:26] fiscal time spiritual if you love God so
[54:28] much it wouldn't force you to do nothing
[54:30] you're just out of the love you I said
[54:32] Lord I just want to please you I said
[54:34] please don't let me pleasing to you let
[54:35] everything that I I you know I I have
[54:37] not owned I just want to please you what
[54:39] do you want me to do next amen that's
[54:41] what that happens that believer he has a
[54:43] benchmarks he's not force to it it's a
[54:45] love I fear between a believer in the
[54:46] Lord where he wants to please the Lord
[54:48] and whatever he does for Romans 8 14
[54:50] said for us may not live by the spirit
[54:52] of God they are the sons of God Amen and
[54:55] that is guess what it doesn't stop there
[54:56] and say you know I'm safe right now I
[54:58] just stop right there it starts to
[54:59] examine itself daily
[55:01] that's a believer I'm just giving up you
[55:03] know what what when I'm looking like
[55:04] that like that the believer she'll be he
[55:07] said exams of daily with God's word he
[55:10] immerses himself in God's word and the
[55:12] better he does that the Better Lives
[55:14] becomes amen the better you immerse
[55:16] yourself into God's word every day your
[55:17] life just just you just find out your
[55:19] life is changing you're just
[55:20] surrendering like brother I saw him this
[55:22] morning you're just surrendering Just
[55:23] Surrender that's all he asks for he
[55:25] didn't said to ask Just Surrender says
[55:26] that word and immerse in it and then
[55:28] before you know it please ask them oh no
[55:30] that you were trying to fight to the
[55:31] struggling with slowly just fall out
[55:35] amen and you know you know what you're
[55:37] trying to do is doing one thing with
[55:39] Matthew 5 48 said Is it true he's
[55:41] striving for Perfection he said be a
[55:43] death of perfect I see heavenly father
[55:44] is perfect and they strive for
[55:45] profession sometimes it's going to make
[55:47] mistake as a believer
[55:48] but a bouncer will make mistakes every
[55:50] day
[55:51] sometimes you know even has been a wife
[55:53] as much as you love it sometimes you you
[55:54] know you just don't go on same page I'm
[55:57] telling from experience so I mean the
[55:59] other ones can tell I have a short life
[56:01] of marriage but I can't tell a little
[56:02] life I live so far sometimes not even
[56:04] good but even with the mistakes one
[56:06] thing stressing down in his heart that
[56:08] brings him back to repentance I said
[56:10] Lord I messed up this on this part I
[56:12] messed the Lord please forgive me and
[56:13] the Bible said it's just unable to
[56:15] forgive all of our sins not just part of
[56:18] it it's a whole of it he knows that
[56:20] you're gonna even have those mistakes
[56:21] before he even made them
[56:23] and the ultimate sacrifice for for your
[56:26] correction so that's amazing that God is
[56:29] a god that is not it doesn't love you
[56:31] based on what you do in the next moment
[56:33] or what you're gonna do tomorrow or what
[56:34] you're gonna do you know next week no he
[56:36] didn't love you based on that it love
[56:38] you unconditionally
[56:39] amen hallelujah so you know it's so
[56:41] amazing how the life of Believers you
[56:43] know it makes me mistake but God is the
[56:45] word of God is so powerful to cleanse
[56:46] him and bring him back on his feet again
[56:48] amen so we're talking about uh believer
[56:51] another thing about Believers is
[56:53] inspiration where is this inspiration
[56:55] coming from from above
[56:58] amen it states of music
[57:00] from above
[57:02] it's conversations from above it's
[57:05] association's kind of friends he has
[57:07] from above the kind of dressy he you
[57:10] know dressing he puts on the fashion
[57:11] style from above so it's not him no more
[57:14] it's Christ leaving in him the hope of
[57:16] Glory Hallelujah now I want to just I'm
[57:20] enjoying this so much but I just just go
[57:23] quickly so I don't I'm wasting my time
[57:24] so the unbeliever if you look on the
[57:26] opposite look at all believer uh but
[57:28] Brown was saying about
[57:30] um unbelievers and I have like three
[57:32] categories that kind of you know break
[57:34] them out a little bit to what I'm
[57:35] Believers are and I have one the fourth
[57:37] one is the one that never heard the word
[57:39] Abraham said that he has traveled all
[57:41] over the world in the sermon um uh in
[57:43] this summer right here I'm trying to see
[57:45] but I'm saying something right here and
[57:47] I was saying provided way of worship uh
[57:49] fellowship and but Obama saying they
[57:51] said he's traveled the world over and
[57:52] I've seen all kinds of people and some
[57:55] of them don't even know which is right
[57:56] or left
[57:57] so I've seen people that did not even
[57:59] know which was right and left and know
[58:01] this word never heard the word of the
[58:04] Lord Jesus in their lives
[58:06] so there are believers out there who
[58:08] have never encountered God's word amen
[58:11] that's one category I know the category
[58:12] is one who have heard it
[58:14] but did not receive it
[58:16] we have around as well family friends
[58:18] you know good people they're nice to us
[58:20] they want to be there for us and but
[58:21] they just don't they don't see it but
[58:23] they don't reject it
[58:25] but to me I'm looking at that as an
[58:27] indirect rejection
[58:28] it can't be on the fence he said they
[58:30] accept it or you reject it so they don't
[58:33] they don't say anything against it but
[58:35] they just don't see the way it says and
[58:37] they they respect it
[58:38] then the third um the third group is one
[58:41] that totally rejected they received the
[58:42] word they see it and like you know what
[58:43] I'm not for it I'm out they even talk it
[58:45] some even blast them against it so what
[58:48] happened is that that man does not
[58:50] it could be a believer let's get to the
[58:52] we'll get to that in a minute it could
[58:53] be a believer but he has not seen it yet
[58:56] oh he's not a Believer as a doesn't have
[58:58] sin of God anymore I just rejected right
[58:59] like like that so they never come to
[59:01] repentance like the believer always come
[59:03] to the Panthers amen there's no
[59:06] repentance dictionary of a non-believer
[59:07] Anything Goes it does anything there's
[59:10] no there's no restraint it follows the
[59:13] new trend it follows the new challenge
[59:15] and all that stuff it does everything
[59:16] that's just new it doesn't have a set
[59:18] goal for himself no battery no barricade
[59:20] it's got to be filled with the spirit
[59:23] so there's no fans but so I don't have
[59:25] the spirit of God but I can't you know I
[59:27] can I can be somewhere no he can't he
[59:29] said you have the spirit of God or you
[59:31] have the devil in you
[59:32] right so you gotta choose one so you're
[59:34] going to sleep with the spirit Soul was
[59:36] saying that did they have been the God
[59:37] of this evil age yes he goes he fills in
[59:40] so we have now I've gotten you even if
[59:43] you have a pen and you're that place is
[59:45] cleansed and God doesn't come in right
[59:46] away the devil's gonna take his place
[59:49] amen is this person comes from the myth
[59:52] health
[59:53] and that's why you look at the music
[59:54] that we have in the world today look at
[59:56] the conversations that's in war today
[59:58] look at the the style the fashion that
[1:00:01] just turning people to be naked instead
[1:00:03] of covering them covering themselves or
[1:00:04] perceptually the female gender and
[1:00:06] that's what if you notice that that's
[1:00:08] not from God
[1:00:10] is Holy
[1:00:12] so with that happening the inspiration
[1:00:14] that is that unbeliever that it's not
[1:00:16] from from God but from from Benin now
[1:00:20] the unbeliever is a soccer boy everybody
[1:00:22] knows a soccer ball right here
[1:00:24] have you ever played soccer before I
[1:00:25] play soccer I know in America I mean
[1:00:28] it's spelled in the U.S it's football
[1:00:30] um um they play football but in Africa
[1:00:32] and some part of Canada so I can I can
[1:00:34] align with Canada Canadians right yeah I
[1:00:37] see a lot of soccer stadium like well I
[1:00:38] need to play some soccer but
[1:00:39] if you say something to talk about
[1:00:41] before an unbeliever to soccer ball in
[1:00:44] the legs of the enemy I'm gonna explain
[1:00:47] that
[1:00:49] so when you play soccer if you haven't
[1:00:51] played soccer before when you hit it
[1:00:53] wherever you hit it to is where it goes
[1:00:55] it has no direction of its own if you
[1:00:57] leave it's gonna stay right there but if
[1:00:59] you go out go go to it and kick it out
[1:01:01] of your foot or with the toe it goes
[1:01:04] wherever you you know direct it to an
[1:01:06] unbeliever is a soccer ball in the end
[1:01:07] of the devil because that's his God
[1:01:10] it's in his heart it does whatever he
[1:01:12] wants with it but guess what he can't do
[1:01:14] anything with a believer
[1:01:15] a Believer is Lost Child it's so it's so
[1:01:18] strong like God doesn't play with any of
[1:01:20] his children but Brown said he said God
[1:01:22] will destroy
[1:01:23] no multiple of this word for just one
[1:01:26] child
[1:01:27] so he doesn't play with God's children
[1:01:28] are so powerful you don't know let me
[1:01:31] tell you brothers and sisters you're a
[1:01:33] powerful you might be sitting here so
[1:01:34] humbly but you're powerful that meant
[1:01:36] multiple of this war
[1:01:38] because of you God can born can just
[1:01:41] destroy things just for you
[1:01:43] so the devil cannot do nothing you know
[1:01:45] cannot touch you unless God allows them
[1:01:48] to look at job was try God try him say
[1:01:51] have you seen myself and James oh yeah I
[1:01:53] know my because he's covering him all
[1:01:54] the time that's why yes it's Rich he's
[1:01:56] has everything he wants he'll say okay
[1:01:58] go check him out but don't touch his
[1:02:01] soul touch his body
[1:02:03] so there's nothing that can happen to
[1:02:05] you I'm gonna try that's gonna happen to
[1:02:07] you without God allowing it to happen
[1:02:10] amen praise the Lord
[1:02:13] now we have uh the next one we're
[1:02:15] talking about which is uh the uh
[1:02:17] make-believer if you want to um you know
[1:02:20] find more about this song about the
[1:02:22] brown push about three kinds of
[1:02:24] Believers I mean just a refresher I'm
[1:02:25] not telling anything new it's just to
[1:02:27] remind us of all things that we've
[1:02:28] already known you know just a reminder
[1:02:29] for the word that God has and stuff for
[1:02:31] us make believer it's uh a fabricated uh
[1:02:34] believer
[1:02:36] make believe is manufactured it's
[1:02:38] believe it's manufactured you just try
[1:02:40] to follow it just try to you know see
[1:02:43] what's going on try to you know wear a
[1:02:44] garment that looks like it it's made up
[1:02:47] not real it's hypocritical is that man
[1:02:49] in the church that is skeptical about
[1:02:51] what whatever has been done it's kept
[1:02:53] about the gift of God of whatever the
[1:02:55] moon of God it finds false all the time
[1:02:57] remember I'm safe gonna find Falls in
[1:02:59] God's house going to find a lot of fault
[1:03:02] for me you're gonna see a lot
[1:03:05] you get from Brother Barry maybe a
[1:03:07] million a million but guess what that's
[1:03:09] not what we're here for we're not here
[1:03:11] to find faults we have to make ourselves
[1:03:13] right this is an hospital where we come
[1:03:14] with all our diseases on sickness in the
[1:03:16] Lord Here I Am Here I Am Lord this is
[1:03:19] what I've been struggling all week this
[1:03:20] is what I want to get better and he's
[1:03:21] here to all cleanse us all so we're not
[1:03:24] here to look for faults
[1:03:25] amen but they make believe that's what
[1:03:27] it does and you know it stays longer but
[1:03:29] Brian was saying that in the in the
[1:03:30] message on the three kinds of Believers
[1:03:32] said you know it stays longer than short
[1:03:34] than to be unbeliever they only was like
[1:03:35] oh I don't like this that I'm out
[1:03:37] but maybe stays and you can't even think
[1:03:39] he may be replaced music in the church
[1:03:41] he might even be a song leader he might
[1:03:42] even be a preacher
[1:03:43] but it's not accepted the word yet
[1:03:46] amen faith has no roots in that make
[1:03:48] believer it says long on the church now
[1:03:51] but I'm saying something right here and
[1:03:53] I really like that I would love to uh to
[1:03:54] read and um in uh three kinds of
[1:03:57] Believers uh was saying right here said
[1:04:00] it's supernatural produces three kinds
[1:04:03] of believer
[1:04:05] so when God moves what happens Sith and
[1:04:08] also moves
[1:04:09] and every time that that move is you
[1:04:11] know according
[1:04:13] three kinds of Believers are produced
[1:04:16] now saying three kind of Believers are
[1:04:18] saying it said c said when it's
[1:04:20] supernatural is displayed it produces
[1:04:22] three different types
[1:04:24] he did it down in Egypt and I've looked
[1:04:26] through the scriptures it's always like
[1:04:27] that when God moves it's always that
[1:04:30] that you know set of Believers produced
[1:04:33] it's produced the unbeliever
[1:04:35] the believer
[1:04:37] and make believer he did all the classes
[1:04:39] and just were down to we just go go uh
[1:04:41] to just go on and on through the night
[1:04:43] spend nowadays everywhere you find it
[1:04:45] you see you see them three and always
[1:04:48] that way you see and you find them
[1:04:49] everywhere that's what's just trying to
[1:04:51] say that they're always everywhere
[1:04:52] that's what Obama's trying to say but
[1:04:54] the thing is
[1:04:55] it's still now separate them
[1:04:58] how do you know
[1:04:59] it's a Believer how do you know who is
[1:05:01] an unbeliever how do you remember we're
[1:05:03] talking about in interaction Believers
[1:05:05] interacting in the world so we have to
[1:05:08] understand we're Believers was an
[1:05:10] unbeliever who is the make-believer dam
[1:05:12] and I don't know we we interacting with
[1:05:16] amen Matthew Matthew Chapter 13 24 to 30
[1:05:19] if you go in there talk about power of
[1:05:21] the soul I won't read it because of our
[1:05:22] time but I want to just quickly go ahead
[1:05:24] and basically talk about how a good man
[1:05:27] came to plant seeds you know and then in
[1:05:29] the night after I left the enemy came
[1:05:31] and planned tears in it and then when
[1:05:34] they came when they came back and things
[1:05:36] were the wheat and the tears of corn
[1:05:37] they're like wow we're planning all this
[1:05:39] and and the lord of the of the the
[1:05:42] swords as he said said the enemy Planet
[1:05:44] it was like oh let's just put them about
[1:05:46] I said no don't pull him out
[1:05:48] and because that's natural for you just
[1:05:50] want to go there and just pick it up I
[1:05:51] said don't pull them out I said leave
[1:05:53] him let them grow together I love them
[1:05:55] said verse 30 said let them both grow
[1:05:57] until Harvest
[1:06:00] this just tells us that the Believers
[1:06:03] True Believers and non-believers and
[1:06:05] make believe as they co-exist
[1:06:07] and the water where either in the church
[1:06:08] or out there we live together there you
[1:06:10] know this so much so much going on with
[1:06:13] that and say but how do you identify
[1:06:15] that how do you you know separate that
[1:06:18] scripture said buy their fruits
[1:06:21] amen Genesis 8 22 if you want to write
[1:06:23] it down he said why did Earth remain see
[1:06:26] time on the Harvest cold and heat no tea
[1:06:29] time and harvest cold and heat summer
[1:06:31] and winter day and night shall never
[1:06:34] cease
[1:06:35] so when there's a seat Zone once later
[1:06:38] later 20 years later it could be 40
[1:06:40] years even 50 years later the Harvard is
[1:06:41] going to come
[1:06:43] amen and Matthew 7 was saying right
[1:06:46] there also Master Matthew 7 was saying
[1:06:47] you know
[1:06:50] what Jesus was saying about you know
[1:06:54] buy their fruits you know them verse 20
[1:06:55] I was talking about how you know you
[1:06:57] have false prophets coming in and they
[1:07:00] you know hide where uh shifts clothing
[1:07:02] but they are wolves and said Beware of
[1:07:04] them and said how will you know them by
[1:07:06] their fruits so that's how we know the
[1:07:08] difference between all those Believers
[1:07:09] and another thing I know I will let you
[1:07:12] know if a man or a woman is a Believer a
[1:07:14] True Believer in time
[1:07:16] the fruits of their life will depict
[1:07:18] what's on the inside
[1:07:20] you said but how it's going to be I was
[1:07:22] going to just push them or no
[1:07:24] I've ever heard the word pressure before
[1:07:27] pressure is a tool of God
[1:07:31] pressure will fall out what's on the
[1:07:33] inside
[1:07:35] pressure can come from trials can come
[1:07:37] from from the trials in the marriage it
[1:07:38] could come in different various forms
[1:07:40] but you can you can you can pretend for
[1:07:42] a long time after a while you're gonna
[1:07:45] give in
[1:07:46] amen pressure means squeezing crushing
[1:07:49] just like when they have a order not
[1:07:51] with the wine that we have today you
[1:07:53] have grapes and then of course the
[1:07:54] grapes and they squeeze them to get them
[1:07:56] out and you know I know that word for
[1:07:58] but she's that word is tension
[1:08:01] Act of stretching
[1:08:03] like in music when if you all this
[1:08:05] pianos uh instruments that they have
[1:08:07] strings they have tension and the more
[1:08:09] you stretch them the acute the sound
[1:08:12] comes like you can hear it distinctly
[1:08:15] so pressure will bring out what is on
[1:08:18] the inside of you whether you're a seat
[1:08:19] of God or not whatever seed God or you
[1:08:21] just either pretending to bring it out
[1:08:22] and Barbara was saying something here
[1:08:24] today you know people were thinking oh
[1:08:25] now you're Christian now you're saved
[1:08:28] you don't have any more pressure you
[1:08:29] just have it to be easy you pray and go
[1:08:31] just answer the prayer and then
[1:08:32] everything just goes smooth but that's
[1:08:33] something but Brian was saying United
[1:08:35] time I signed 1963 for uh program 17 it
[1:08:38] was saying that some people try to
[1:08:40] introduce Christianity that you are free
[1:08:42] from war
[1:08:43] no you're not
[1:08:45] you are free from tension they say that
[1:08:47] I said no your attention when you become
[1:08:49] a Christian
[1:08:51] like my grandma said another place said
[1:08:53] the moment you're saved this is all the
[1:08:55] artillers of the enemy just come at you
[1:08:57] because now you have you have you drew a
[1:09:00] line and say hey I'm not serving you no
[1:09:02] more I'm serving God at that point say
[1:09:03] hey get him
[1:09:05] so the extension right there it said
[1:09:07] your attention when you come a Christian
[1:09:08] because he was he was kind of I mean
[1:09:10] sloppy Abigail Loki whatever it was out
[1:09:12] there and not caring what it did and
[1:09:13] that's what I believe it is it's just
[1:09:14] you know do whatever nobody who's him
[1:09:17] but instead but when you become a real
[1:09:18] Christian paragraph 18 every moment
[1:09:21] you're wondering am I pleasing my Lord
[1:09:24] amen if I could hear from him you know
[1:09:27] something happened a couple weeks ago
[1:09:29] where you know I assuming she's my boss
[1:09:31] and unbeliever and then I was trying to
[1:09:33] use my Approach as a human and you know
[1:09:35] just to fight it and God told me you
[1:09:37] can't do that it said just
[1:09:40] find God in every situation that you
[1:09:42] find you you find yourself in so when I
[1:09:45] went back to work the next I told my
[1:09:46] wife about it I was not looking at my
[1:09:48] boss anymore I was trying to see God in
[1:09:49] him and you know what all the tension
[1:09:52] just seized because I was not looking at
[1:09:54] you know
[1:09:55] this is a this is a non-believer I was
[1:09:57] looking at him as okay where can I see
[1:10:00] God on him
[1:10:01] amen so you know I wasn't looking at you
[1:10:04] know that man I was looking at how do I
[1:10:06] please God when I'm dealing with this
[1:10:07] man and that's what the believer said my
[1:10:09] pleasing my Lord if I could hear from
[1:10:10] announce so much I I was I'll I'll talk
[1:10:13] to girl when I leave there I said Lord I
[1:10:14] just want to hear it I just want to walk
[1:10:16] with you even in distress of work and
[1:10:18] pressure and you know you know
[1:10:20] situation that my boss is putting me in
[1:10:22] but I really want to just just see you
[1:10:25] and then it puts your attention you're
[1:10:27] always on guard that's what makes you
[1:10:30] who you are but after all know this
[1:10:32] after all tension is a blessing
[1:10:36] it's just the way you're looking at it
[1:10:37] it's just the way you're looking at it
[1:10:39] he said now if you just look to the
[1:10:40] other side no matter how things you
[1:10:42] slice anything you used to go two sides
[1:10:44] to it and listen about uh paragraph 19
[1:10:47] says so tension what is tension if I
[1:10:49] could if I could be born without this
[1:10:51] tension well if I couldn't have this
[1:10:54] tension if I only be what I am then I
[1:10:56] will not be the Christian
[1:10:58] perhaps it was this tension that drove
[1:11:01] me to Christ
[1:11:02] it's been a blessing to me
[1:11:05] amen so pressure will push out the real
[1:11:07] you just like a tea bag tea bag you
[1:11:09] might not it might look like a certain
[1:11:11] color but most of the time the colors
[1:11:13] know what it really is when you get our
[1:11:15] teeth back get a very hot water maybe
[1:11:17] 100 I don't know I use uh I used to use
[1:11:20] a centigrade in Nigeria and then I got
[1:11:22] to us and I got all messed up and
[1:11:24] confused and I'm back here I'm thinking
[1:11:25] we see miles or kilometers and I'm just
[1:11:27] confused but you know that's 100 degrees
[1:11:29] am I right Fair am I right on a degree
[1:11:31] Centigrade yeah for for water to boil so
[1:11:33] if you put
[1:11:35] um that tea bag in that cup and drop in
[1:11:38] that very hot water you see the color
[1:11:40] coming out you can even if you can hear
[1:11:42] I'm just hypothetically you can hear the
[1:11:44] tea bag is screaming like oh this water
[1:11:46] is still hot but guess what it's
[1:11:48] bringing on the real color or for that
[1:11:50] tea bag ass and that's what it is about
[1:11:52] Christian when you know you might not
[1:11:54] even know what they have but when that
[1:11:57] trial comes that that that that's the
[1:11:59] situation that pressure comes it just
[1:12:01] makes it more beautiful
[1:12:02] amen hallelujah so pressure will
[1:12:04] determine exactly where you are amen I'm
[1:12:06] gonna go ahead right quick so remember
[1:12:08] we're talking about interactions with
[1:12:10] unbelievers um Believers and and make
[1:12:12] believe us and we've established by the
[1:12:14] scriptures done by the word by the mess
[1:12:16] of the hour that we have to kind of
[1:12:17] Believers and coexist now now that we
[1:12:20] know that the coexists do we now say
[1:12:22] Believers have to be in a bubble so you
[1:12:24] don't want to understand you don't want
[1:12:25] to attack to them just stay in your
[1:12:27] house or wear it a level a suit puts gas
[1:12:30] Max on I just want to touch them and
[1:12:32] just talk to them so they won't make you
[1:12:33] say do we do that
[1:12:35] no we're not gonna do that because the
[1:12:37] co-az is as close family members they
[1:12:39] might be your dad might be your mom
[1:12:41] might be your brother or sister it might
[1:12:43] be a cousins people that you really love
[1:12:44] so much and because I saw as friends
[1:12:46] great friends who are good to us even as
[1:12:48] good neighbors neighbors who would do
[1:12:49] anything to to help colleagues that work
[1:12:51] in a career uh business partners you
[1:12:54] know they even in the church
[1:12:56] do we say we're gonna you know just
[1:12:57] being above or no we can't
[1:13:00] and that's why we need the Holy Ghost
[1:13:02] the world is going to give us
[1:13:03] discernment
[1:13:05] as a Believer when you get the Holy
[1:13:06] Ghost in your life the next thing that
[1:13:07] comes is discernment to be able to
[1:13:09] discern not by face value either Luke
[1:13:11] are nice there how good they are how
[1:13:13] given they are but determined to help
[1:13:15] you to separate the people like oh
[1:13:18] something you might even understand why
[1:13:20] see German is very strong
[1:13:22] second time I mess with certain people
[1:13:24] and I see them and then after my wife I
[1:13:25] said I don't know but I just feel funny
[1:13:27] on this person it's like don't judge
[1:13:29] them you know I say I'm not judging them
[1:13:30] I'm just telling how I feel and then
[1:13:32] down the line of down the years and
[1:13:34] certain things come up like oh
[1:13:35] you were right but guess what I couldn't
[1:13:38] Express I couldn't explain what happened
[1:13:39] but you know the sermon is just better I
[1:13:42] see my children God because now you
[1:13:44] already know exactly what's coming so as
[1:13:46] mature God God's gonna start speaking to
[1:13:48] you from mild to ear but you have to
[1:13:50] imagine saving the word for you to grow
[1:13:52] spiritually where discernments go bigger
[1:13:55] but a brownie didn't get that position
[1:13:56] the way it was where it could discern
[1:13:58] you have to walk with God onto a point
[1:14:00] in time where it was my trust
[1:14:01] spiritually and you know what you can't
[1:14:03] be there too
[1:14:06] where God put Branham in in a position
[1:14:08] as a prophet we know as a prophet but
[1:14:10] God has so much is tough for us
[1:14:12] it's a Greater Works that you do now
[1:14:14] it's not Greater Works in in quality
[1:14:17] it's in quantity I'll maybe if I have
[1:14:20] time I'll share that uh that uh um quote
[1:14:22] the girl was talking about it that you
[1:14:24] do more of this but we need to walk with
[1:14:26] God God does not dwell in investors
[1:14:28] that's dirty God wants invest that's
[1:14:30] preserved for him and he can step into
[1:14:32] that and work amen
[1:14:34] so Germans have important for a believer
[1:14:37] um Hebrews 5 14 if you want to read that
[1:14:39] say about strong meat belonged to them
[1:14:40] that are full of age even those who by
[1:14:43] original views have their senses senses
[1:14:46] not of not the same not the physical
[1:14:47] sense not spiritual sense exercise to
[1:14:50] discern but good and evil
[1:14:52] amen and I remember now not all all
[1:14:55] believers are unbelievers or make
[1:14:56] Believers no unbelievers and make
[1:14:58] Believers are sins of enemies some of
[1:15:00] them are still God's children who have
[1:15:02] never seen that green light yet
[1:15:04] there are some of them we have God said
[1:15:05] in them they've never just encountered
[1:15:07] God
[1:15:08] but guess what the moment they encounter
[1:15:10] God the story changes
[1:15:13] you'll be shocked at how much you know
[1:15:15] Zeal they have for God
[1:15:19] how much um sacrifice to give in because
[1:15:21] you know
[1:15:22] God has you know touch their lives watch
[1:15:25] Muslims am I mean I've been around a lot
[1:15:27] most I can tell you they're very very
[1:15:29] zealous they don't play whatever they
[1:15:31] believe in they are indoctrinated so
[1:15:33] much and then watch I've watched those
[1:15:35] Muslims that God saved with the word
[1:15:37] over the message devour oh my God they
[1:15:39] just blow out
[1:15:43] was in them and later it's just catching
[1:15:46] them boom they're up there and then you
[1:15:48] meet them a year or two years later you
[1:15:49] think they've lived for like 10 years
[1:15:51] because they're saying Mars what they're
[1:15:52] believing so when God touches your life
[1:15:54] it's a different ballgame hey man so not
[1:15:57] all those unbelievers I believe and and
[1:15:59] make Believers are sisters of enemy some
[1:16:01] of them are God said amen as long as
[1:16:03] I've got sitting them they will never be
[1:16:05] lost
[1:16:05] and that's why I cannot give up on your
[1:16:07] family members your friends your people
[1:16:09] that you love don't give up on them
[1:16:10] don't say you know it's hey you know
[1:16:12] he's now he's in prison right now oh now
[1:16:14] he's doing this and that now he's doing
[1:16:16] drugs don't give up on your own your
[1:16:17] people keep praying unto God answer your
[1:16:20] prayer because you never know
[1:16:22] a preacher Nigeria preacher I was saying
[1:16:24] one time and said he said give for
[1:16:26] example you're walking through the
[1:16:27] street anybody's in the hood before I
[1:16:29] bring the hood very bad bad neighborhood
[1:16:32] Detroit eyes and Chicago has it you know
[1:16:34] this person doesn't look like that it's
[1:16:35] so beautiful
[1:16:36] [Laughter]
[1:16:37] everything's just cleaned so but if
[1:16:39] you've been to the hood before you see
[1:16:41] you know really bad guys that you know
[1:16:43] they've been through it and then that
[1:16:45] preacher said if you see see let's say
[1:16:47] you know sitting on your own by your
[1:16:49] Windows 10 you're looking out and God
[1:16:50] said Hey to that guy with a roster in
[1:16:53] there within his hand that guy's my my
[1:16:56] son Let's assume that I was just saying
[1:16:58] that
[1:16:59] that guy's my son he said the moment you
[1:17:01] know that because you're a Christian you
[1:17:03] do everything to please that man
[1:17:05] because you know for sure God has told
[1:17:08] you that man is God's son
[1:17:10] so and that's where we treat everybody
[1:17:11] I've made don't we should not have you
[1:17:14] know
[1:17:15] um
[1:17:15] no categorize people and say you know I
[1:17:17] can't talk to these people I can't be
[1:17:19] around these people wherever God leads
[1:17:21] you go put your opens your mouth to
[1:17:22] evangelize speak to them just talk to
[1:17:24] them share your testimony do whatever I
[1:17:26] can do to help them hold your faith
[1:17:27] though don't say because oh because I'm
[1:17:29] going to be around them and now I want
[1:17:31] to don't be like them hold your faith
[1:17:33] but at the same time still reach out to
[1:17:35] them
[1:17:36] amen
[1:17:37] amen don't give up on your loved ones
[1:17:39] because
[1:17:40] you never know keep pressing keep
[1:17:41] praying keep believing amen I'm gonna go
[1:17:43] farther uh so now we're talking about
[1:17:45] you know you know
[1:17:47] um interactions with the ward and
[1:17:49] basically
[1:17:50] one thing I go put in my heart here is
[1:17:52] that you cannot interact with the devil
[1:17:54] or the rest of the vessel vessel of
[1:17:57] devil out there if you don't have
[1:17:58] something inside of you
[1:18:00] you have to have something
[1:18:01] you've done something you're gonna
[1:18:02] struggle I mean audio just pull it over
[1:18:04] to the other side
[1:18:06] and now the thing about scripture and
[1:18:07] ask people came to me about foundations
[1:18:09] and Psalm 11 verse 3 if you want to
[1:18:12] write it down say something said if the
[1:18:14] foundation be destroyed what can the
[1:18:17] righteous do you really said in in
[1:18:20] strict words verbatim he said what can a
[1:18:22] good man do
[1:18:23] now I was like so who's the good man I
[1:18:26] was just in the wondering just sometimes
[1:18:28] you go to have answers from the
[1:18:29] scriptures the answers are there you've
[1:18:31] got to open your eyes you see right
[1:18:32] there so and I was just thinking about
[1:18:33] it and then I go to Matthew 19 verse 16
[1:18:35] and 17 where that man came to Jesus said
[1:18:37] oh good master and Jesus said there's no
[1:18:40] one that's good no one but God
[1:18:43] so I said oh I'm not understand what
[1:18:45] this means so if the foundation will be
[1:18:47] destroyed what can be righteous
[1:18:50] which is God is righteous do basically
[1:18:53] so that means that if you really you
[1:18:55] want to interact in this world as a
[1:18:57] Believer you got to have something to
[1:18:59] you to combat the tactics or the
[1:19:02] artilleries or the weapons or the
[1:19:03] strategies of the enemy if don't have it
[1:19:05] if you have a great Foundation it's
[1:19:07] going to affect you and I was thinking
[1:19:08] of the word foundation you know I took a
[1:19:10] sermon sometimes like my church a couple
[1:19:12] months ago about Foundation which is
[1:19:14] really important for everybody
[1:19:15] foundation and now you know um I'm
[1:19:18] looking at definition right here and
[1:19:20] saying financial means establishing
[1:19:22] yourself in the present day truth of
[1:19:24] God's word
[1:19:26] having your two feet on the ground and
[1:19:29] it's not something bogus something big
[1:19:30] somewhere where you have to have some
[1:19:31] vocabulary and have to go to school on
[1:19:33] College do Masters or a PhD for it no
[1:19:35] it's not gospel is simple
[1:19:37] read listen
[1:19:40] meditate and pray
[1:19:42] it's as simple as that God didn't see
[1:19:45] God made salvation so easy that he said
[1:19:47] If any man
[1:19:49] will open the door
[1:19:51] no matter how Wars it is it's leave even
[1:19:54] Paul of uh became Paul later he killed
[1:19:57] he he was part of mother he was he was
[1:20:00] part of the model even though he didn't
[1:20:01] kill directly part of it but God saved
[1:20:03] him
[1:20:04] so it's it's just they're establishing
[1:20:07] yourself in God's word when you're after
[1:20:09] you're saved establish yourself in that
[1:20:11] word if you are saved that you don't
[1:20:12] understand that word you will lose that
[1:20:14] that salvation now when I mean salvation
[1:20:16] you will lose your as the city of God
[1:20:18] God Will Take It Go do anything to save
[1:20:19] you but at that point in time you lose
[1:20:22] that person that you are because you're
[1:20:23] not establishing them in that word amen
[1:20:26] so after you're saved you have to keep
[1:20:28] reading that word until it makes you
[1:20:29] better and better and better and better
[1:20:30] hey man read listen meditative and and
[1:20:33] pray what does that do it's what your
[1:20:35] prayer Waters the seed of God's word in
[1:20:37] you daily
[1:20:38] amen because someone talks about but but
[1:20:40] no you know one of the
[1:20:42] um question answers said I cannot grow
[1:20:44] to the Easter storm read the Bible and
[1:20:46] pray every day
[1:20:48] it's as simple as that God wants to take
[1:20:50] him as simple as word is and then he can
[1:20:52] do great wonders in our lives amen this
[1:20:54] Foundation puts in place a framework of
[1:20:57] Godly principle and guidance
[1:21:00] which is built on Christ himself the
[1:21:02] Chief Cornerstone
[1:21:04] amen and you know what what happens like
[1:21:06] he helps a God's word Bridge your that
[1:21:08] inner man now it's not you trying to
[1:21:11] interact a fight with all that tillage
[1:21:13] of enemy right now it is the inner man
[1:21:15] in you the the older goes in you doesn't
[1:21:17] combat combat the enemy on his vessels
[1:21:20] and that's what that's what we need
[1:21:22] we're Foundation First
[1:21:24] number two is builds I was thinking
[1:21:26] about after you as you read you know
[1:21:28] listen medicine I pray on the review
[1:21:30] word it builds faith in you so that's
[1:21:32] the foundation of function of faith and
[1:21:34] then that brings it brings me to Romans
[1:21:36] 10 10 17 where it says faith comes back
[1:21:38] here
[1:21:39] and here by the word of God now I have
[1:21:42] some people in the message now that say
[1:21:44] oh I'm just gonna sit on the house
[1:21:46] and just you know read my Bible or read
[1:21:48] the message play the tape and say that
[1:21:50] and no and they feel feel spiritual
[1:21:52] about it
[1:21:54] but then that scripture said that we
[1:21:56] should not forsake the Assembly of the
[1:21:57] Saints as a manner of some so we're
[1:21:59] gonna put a balance to that as much as
[1:22:01] you want to be oh I don't want to be in
[1:22:02] a drama I don't want to be anything
[1:22:04] I don't want to do they sell a lot going
[1:22:06] on the church right now you still want
[1:22:07] to make sure if you're obeying every
[1:22:09] part of God's word
[1:22:10] we go to Walmart and we see crazy people
[1:22:12] there we never stop going to
[1:22:15] do we still keep going every day we see
[1:22:17] crazy I mean during Kobe that sounds
[1:22:18] some crazy people wearing
[1:22:20] different attires but we should go there
[1:22:22] I'll jump out of some crazy people
[1:22:24] different Jenners and we'll see go there
[1:22:27] but not one completely complain about
[1:22:28] the house of the Lord because we feel
[1:22:30] like we can't do it
[1:22:32] you need to come here to strengthen
[1:22:34] yourself that's what we are you
[1:22:35] threatening me out threatening you
[1:22:36] sometimes I come to church and I'm just
[1:22:38] so tired and I just don't feel like
[1:22:40] going on it happens there are times like
[1:22:42] that and then but the bear says the
[1:22:43] sermon like oh thank you Lord and that's
[1:22:45] the word for the day so please don't
[1:22:47] stop coming to church if if you're out
[1:22:50] of town I understand but if you're in
[1:22:51] town brother sister come back to church
[1:22:53] this is where God is going to strengthen
[1:22:55] you amen
[1:22:56] amen
[1:22:58] so first time by hearing and hearing by
[1:23:00] the word of God
[1:23:01] and this kind of brings them back to I'm
[1:23:03] just dying a few things together brings
[1:23:04] it back to the Statue of a perfect man
[1:23:05] you know how you know you know but
[1:23:08] Abraham talk about that statue and they
[1:23:09] know it goes up and on the pyramid and
[1:23:11] if you have that uh if you have that
[1:23:13] that image can never bring it up so I
[1:23:15] can um go through that hey man I'll be
[1:23:17] enjoying it brothers and sisters hey man
[1:23:19] praise the Lord
[1:23:28] so if you look at what I have here
[1:23:31] um I'm just uh quickly running through
[1:23:33] it and um I think we're doing good so
[1:23:35] far
[1:23:36] amen so um
[1:23:40] if you look at this uh I'm sure you've
[1:23:42] read this statue for everyone several
[1:23:44] times but I'm just going to remind us
[1:23:45] and if you look at I thought I was
[1:23:46] talking about Foundation to come back
[1:23:48] this the the award and interacting this
[1:23:51] world you have to have a great
[1:23:51] Foundation inside of you but after
[1:23:53] you're saved this Foundation of Fate
[1:23:55] number one was talking about that right
[1:23:56] there faith is the foundation that is it
[1:23:58] is the key I remember when when when uh
[1:24:01] Jesus was asking them in the in the book
[1:24:03] in the gospels I was saying oh uh would
[1:24:06] you say I am I sell something oh yeah
[1:24:08] your Johnny this and that then look at
[1:24:10] John Peter said would you say I am
[1:24:14] I see your your Christ the son of living
[1:24:16] God and said flesh and blood has not
[1:24:17] revealed this to you
[1:24:19] and basically if you notice Peter was
[1:24:22] not he got a breath of God at that point
[1:24:25] in time it wasn't even saved
[1:24:27] because if you were saved he wouldn't
[1:24:29] run away when Jesus was crucified
[1:24:33] but it was it was it was a seat of God
[1:24:36] but he had not gotten that power yet
[1:24:41] excuse me
[1:24:42] so when he said those words there were
[1:24:45] two words they're powerful words but
[1:24:47] they were not in him yet
[1:24:49] it can be around the presence of God he
[1:24:51] can have a breath of God sometimes you
[1:24:52] remember in the Old Testament when Saul
[1:24:54] went among them the prophet saw the
[1:24:56] prophet and they were prophesying and he
[1:24:57] also prophesied not because he was a
[1:24:59] prophet but he was taking that breath so
[1:25:01] that's different between taking a breath
[1:25:03] of words around and having to give her
[1:25:05] yourself
[1:25:06] so Peter didn't have it but after acts
[1:25:09] acts acts in Acts 2 chapter 1 when that
[1:25:12] when that that thing came to when those
[1:25:13] people came to him it was the one item
[1:25:15] from people he couldn't hide no more
[1:25:16] yesterday
[1:25:17] whatever I can do because what that
[1:25:20] boldness had been in him that Foundation
[1:25:22] of faith has been established a name in
[1:25:24] no way he was and what what it was
[1:25:26] raised up for he didn't hide no more
[1:25:28] they took him to prison you think that I
[1:25:29] would stop him no
[1:25:31] the Holy Ghost in you you know gives you
[1:25:33] boldness and confidence
[1:25:35] in the in the midst in the midst of
[1:25:36] Trials and in the midst of no no no no
[1:25:39] no no the enemy out there I mean
[1:25:40] unbelievers and whatever goes on there
[1:25:42] little girls gives you confidence to
[1:25:44] walk and say yeah I'm here I have
[1:25:46] government my side what else
[1:25:49] and that's why you know you you see a
[1:25:51] lot of happening the message around us
[1:25:53] and now you see people have been
[1:25:54] messaged for 30 40 years and they've
[1:25:56] been great ministers and they just leave
[1:25:57] I pray if they're going to bring them
[1:25:59] back
[1:26:00] but the question is do they meet God
[1:26:02] ever
[1:26:03] because remember that Peter D in in
[1:26:05] Matthew 10 I read he did Miracles there
[1:26:09] but he was not he didn't accept that
[1:26:11] word yet
[1:26:12] so like I said the pressure will bring
[1:26:14] out what is in you when the pressure
[1:26:15] came out there before the cross he
[1:26:17] couldn't stand it because there's
[1:26:18] nothing inside of him
[1:26:19] but what it said was a true word it said
[1:26:22] but I said this and Jesus said right
[1:26:24] there he told him said on this
[1:26:26] foundation on this Revelation I'll be my
[1:26:28] church that relation is nobody but
[1:26:30] Christ himself someone receive Christ it
[1:26:33] gives you that revelation of Faith now
[1:26:34] now Faith starting like it's it's a key
[1:26:37] it's an opening opens the door now you
[1:26:39] believe in every word that comes to you
[1:26:41] you have faith in them I'm saying
[1:26:43] somewhere said you know that Faith
[1:26:44] starts as a little faith and it goes to
[1:26:46] Marble faith and it goes to a mountain
[1:26:48] fate that's the way he put it and before
[1:26:50] you know it because if you don't have
[1:26:52] faith for the little word of God right
[1:26:54] now how are you gonna have faith for
[1:26:55] that for for the rapture
[1:26:57] you want because it's gonna grow over
[1:26:59] time you have it right now for you know
[1:27:01] for for your sicknesses for diseases for
[1:27:03] the prayer request something you're
[1:27:05] praying for a family member and that fit
[1:27:07] grows you know as you go no what what is
[1:27:09] that Faith you're believing God's word
[1:27:11] even if you don't understand what it's
[1:27:12] saying you believe it and then it
[1:27:14] becomes to you or no according to what
[1:27:15] you what you believe amen so we have
[1:27:17] faith right here but if you look at it
[1:27:19] this is right
[1:27:21] it's such a perfect man look on the
[1:27:22] other side
[1:27:23] what happens the fourth one day can you
[1:27:25] see it says doubt unbelief
[1:27:29] if you notice it's inverted the reason
[1:27:31] why I invited it this is just my my
[1:27:33] imagination I hope God uses for you
[1:27:37] this one right here if you go to Egypt
[1:27:39] it just add the the technology of the
[1:27:42] pyramid
[1:27:43] and I was reading through that that you
[1:27:46] know why they have pyramids that's right
[1:27:47] side up why it's as a Capstone I'm gonna
[1:27:51] tell you the reason so because I was
[1:27:53] like this is really deep because we we
[1:27:54] believe these things and we don't
[1:27:55] nonsense some things but it's really
[1:27:57] true god is perfect
[1:27:59] so it was saying that if a parameters is
[1:28:02] right side up with the Pinnacle off like
[1:28:03] that it means the inspiration is from
[1:28:05] heaven
[1:28:06] I was like wow that's amazing and it's
[1:28:09] it's also said it said it shows if the
[1:28:12] way it's going upwards is standing now
[1:28:14] but it goes up it turns out it said it
[1:28:16] means that
[1:28:17] that that person from God's coming down
[1:28:20] to earth and then he's trying whoever
[1:28:21] whatever vessel who is traveling towards
[1:28:23] Perfection I was like wow that's amazing
[1:28:25] that and that's what we are doing
[1:28:27] Matthew 5 48 who is driving onto
[1:28:30] perfection
[1:28:31] we're not trying to do anything and as
[1:28:33] it goes out all the extra Flex extra
[1:28:34] Surplus things things that go we don't
[1:28:36] want is cutting them out as we're going
[1:28:37] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:28:40] patience and it goes all the way and
[1:28:41] guess what it doesn't stop there
[1:28:44] because it's not complete if the
[1:28:45] Capstone don't seal it up
[1:28:47] amen and then I'm looking right here
[1:28:49] Faith doubt virtue but said virtue
[1:28:53] strength
[1:28:54] strength and I was saying earlier if you
[1:28:57] have strength in you you have it and can
[1:28:59] transmit it
[1:29:00] you remember that woman not to use your
[1:29:02] blood when she when she uh went and held
[1:29:04] the government if Jesus said virtue get
[1:29:05] out one of me what was that that was
[1:29:06] strength
[1:29:08] amen son and you know we're talking
[1:29:09] about the beauty of Faith the beauty of
[1:29:11] of a Believer the stats of a Believer
[1:29:13] where he can combat what's going on
[1:29:15] there what's going to come out you're
[1:29:17] gonna say a lot of doubts out there
[1:29:20] to help you now what you're going to see
[1:29:22] again from virtue you see weaknesses out
[1:29:24] there similar weaknesses oh I can't do
[1:29:26] this I can't do that like everybody's
[1:29:27] just relying on the system relying on
[1:29:29] whatever you know but as a Believer no
[1:29:31] you know you have strength inside of you
[1:29:33] next thing is knowledge no it's not
[1:29:36] knowledge of
[1:29:37] here on the other side is knowledge of
[1:29:39] man
[1:29:40] how I can do it how can I get this done
[1:29:42] what's the approach what's the
[1:29:44] intelligence behind it that what how can
[1:29:46] intellectually approach it that's not
[1:29:47] the way the knowledge of this knowing I
[1:29:50] have knowledge of God
[1:29:52] you can't know who you really are until
[1:29:55] you know God
[1:29:57] because there's a purpose for every man
[1:30:00] every believer right here every brother
[1:30:02] every sister every child and adult
[1:30:04] there's a purpose that God created you
[1:30:05] for
[1:30:07] and guess what
[1:30:09] if you look at if you look at the Book
[1:30:10] of Revelations after you know angel came
[1:30:13] in and all that stuff it went down to
[1:30:15] what's the purpose after the seven angel
[1:30:17] came in this voice of sending Joe you
[1:30:19] know it's one purpose what are you here
[1:30:22] for
[1:30:23] and John said eat that eat the book
[1:30:27] it's bitter
[1:30:29] but it's for you so you have a purpose
[1:30:31] while you're here and then that purpose
[1:30:34] if you don't have knowledge of who God
[1:30:36] is
[1:30:37] you never know who you are
[1:30:40] amen I hope you're enjoying this
[1:30:42] basically and then so basically we're
[1:30:44] looking at what God who God is and
[1:30:47] knowing who I am so how many who is even
[1:30:49] God
[1:30:51] what is his purpose
[1:30:54] then I find myself in in God's plan like
[1:30:57] oh I found myself under where am I this
[1:30:59] is what God plan you're playing this and
[1:31:00] that and then that he wants to worship
[1:31:01] him oh that that's that's my purpose so
[1:31:04] that overrides every of my agendas every
[1:31:06] other things I Aspire for that I know
[1:31:08] what God has me to be he wants me to be
[1:31:11] amen
[1:31:13] now if you notice that as it's going up
[1:31:16] that's an aspirations to go to desire
[1:31:17] you know aspiring for the better thing
[1:31:19] and then next thing is uh Temperance
[1:31:22] remember I'm saying that's that's
[1:31:23] restrained restrained like you know you
[1:31:26] have control
[1:31:27] you're not just doing anything anywhere
[1:31:29] you're not just following anything but
[1:31:31] if you look on the other side there's no
[1:31:32] restraint it's anger and wrath and so
[1:31:34] many things going on but that's what's
[1:31:36] out there but you need temperance
[1:31:39] to combat that
[1:31:41] if you don't have Temperance of God in
[1:31:42] your you if that allowed the world to
[1:31:44] subdue those fleshy manifestations in
[1:31:47] you it's you you was just getting angry
[1:31:49] for nothing
[1:31:51] amen
[1:31:53] and it goes off the patience
[1:31:56] patience pronounce these patients with
[1:31:58] God
[1:31:59] patience with the word of God every
[1:32:01] promise is given it might not be
[1:32:03] manifested yet you know it's for you but
[1:32:05] your patient will go until it does what
[1:32:08] he has planned for you
[1:32:09] but out there is a lot of impatience oh
[1:32:11] I can't do that oh this can happen oh I
[1:32:13] don't believe in God's word the days of
[1:32:15] Miracles are passed that's what's out
[1:32:16] there today but as a Believer if you're
[1:32:18] getting built in this in this spiritual
[1:32:20] realm if he's a patient in you so you
[1:32:22] can combat in patients out there in the
[1:32:24] world
[1:32:25] amen
[1:32:26] nursing is godliness
[1:32:28] out there is some godliness
[1:32:31] can you imagine how much and goodness is
[1:32:32] out here today
[1:32:34] especially in America that where we live
[1:32:35] at so much that you can't even stand
[1:32:38] some
[1:32:39] but guess what we need to combat it is
[1:32:42] godliness
[1:32:43] you want to be like God
[1:32:45] amen
[1:32:48] wow the Bible say yeah God's
[1:32:51] Psalm 82 verse 6 said I said about
[1:32:54] um David said I said yeah gods next
[1:32:57] thing is uh brother Candace
[1:33:00] if you look at the opposite right there
[1:33:01] is self-love
[1:33:03] even if there's so much motivation
[1:33:05] motivational speaking today that's about
[1:33:07] oh just to love yourself
[1:33:09] don't care about whatever your parents
[1:33:10] or your mama say and they it comes to
[1:33:12] selfishness where even the families are
[1:33:14] broken apart and everybody's independent
[1:33:16] and we're not even looking out for
[1:33:17] ourselves no more
[1:33:19] but God has God didn't bring that well
[1:33:21] God brought his brother Candace that I
[1:33:23] should love your brother
[1:33:24] tolerate your brother forgive your
[1:33:26] brother you mess up he will he's human
[1:33:28] he will step on your shoes you're nice
[1:33:30] you just bought yesterday he would step
[1:33:31] on it but guess what you have the heart
[1:33:34] in you God has so subdue that personal
[1:33:37] Pride like he probably is okay I'll take
[1:33:39] care of it even if if it's raining I'll
[1:33:41] take care of it that's what God has
[1:33:43] given us combat self-loveness God has
[1:33:45] done himself love because if you had
[1:33:47] self-love you wouldn't come down to
[1:33:48] earth to you and me but because he
[1:33:51] didn't have self-love he came down and
[1:33:52] say you know what I'm gonna sacrifice
[1:33:53] myself you know what I'm gonna call
[1:33:54] myself
[1:33:56] so if yeah oh my God hallelujah I feel
[1:33:59] good about this right now John John said
[1:34:02] he said beloved let us love one another
[1:34:04] for the love is of God and everyone that
[1:34:06] love it is born of God I know what God
[1:34:08] either love it not know it not God for
[1:34:10] God is love
[1:34:11] amen and you know what that kind of ties
[1:34:14] into the Capstone
[1:34:16] because that's who God is it's perfect
[1:34:19] love now if you look through the up to
[1:34:21] seven churches you see how the devil
[1:34:22] came you know with different tactics and
[1:34:24] then the four-star second and third uh
[1:34:27] um Church agency came with the the White
[1:34:31] House writer
[1:34:33] then it came up um with uh the writers
[1:34:36] writer and then came with the uh the
[1:34:38] black horse ride and the last one it
[1:34:39] came with was the pillars write a
[1:34:40] combination of all the colors together
[1:34:42] and that's what it's doing right now
[1:34:43] he's combining his tactics
[1:34:46] but you know what
[1:34:47] he can't do nothing in the presence of
[1:34:49] perfect love
[1:34:51] because I have a scripture here that's
[1:34:52] perfect love cast it out all fear so I'm
[1:34:56] so excited that even even if that would
[1:34:58] come with all these combined taxes
[1:35:00] against me against my brother against my
[1:35:02] sister I have something that has given
[1:35:04] me if I can just connect to it it's
[1:35:06] perfect love
[1:35:08] amen praise the Lord I'm really feeling
[1:35:10] good right here I feel like jumping
[1:35:11] amen praise the Lord
[1:35:13] perfect love is so strong but Abraham
[1:35:16] said in in the sermon love uh uh when
[1:35:19] love is projected paragraph nice and
[1:35:22] love is the greatest weapon that God has
[1:35:24] ever given us
[1:35:26] so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna interact
[1:35:28] with some Believers out there I just I
[1:35:30] need perfect love that's all I need to
[1:35:32] win this battle I don't need any extra
[1:35:33] without any any independent uh way of
[1:35:36] Mind intellectual artillery or tactic I
[1:35:39] shouldn't have that perfect love in me
[1:35:40] to to win that that that but that's the
[1:35:43] greatest weapon so far
[1:35:46] perfect love is the greatest tool God
[1:35:48] has given every belief every believer to
[1:35:50] interact with unbelievers and make
[1:35:52] believe us in the present world
[1:35:54] perfect love combines the wisdom of a
[1:35:57] serpent listen
[1:36:00] with the armlessness of a dove
[1:36:03] Matthew 10 can open it right with me I'm
[1:36:05] I've done a few minutes Matthew 10 I'm
[1:36:09] 10 16. let's read that quickly because
[1:36:11] that's what perfect love does
[1:36:15] Matthew 10 16.
[1:36:17] said behold I send you as sheep in the
[1:36:19] midst of wolves
[1:36:22] unbelievers make-believers wolves be ye
[1:36:25] therefore wise as what
[1:36:28] and armless as what
[1:36:30] I know you know suffering don't mean
[1:36:32] anything good let's be honest
[1:36:34] if you see a Snicker right here now
[1:36:35] we're gonna jump out
[1:36:36] in Africa maybe not over here we're
[1:36:38] gonna jump out so but the thing is it
[1:36:41] doesn't have anything good if you go
[1:36:42] back to Genesis 3 and 2 instead of the
[1:36:45] servant was soft subtle so basically he
[1:36:48] doesn't have any characters but what
[1:36:50] Jesus was saying right here is deeper
[1:36:51] than just the the cast I guess the
[1:36:54] characteristics of that animal
[1:36:56] what he was trying to say is that that
[1:36:59] it was talking about assuredness
[1:37:01] not Sly Communists because the Sovereign
[1:37:04] is cunning but that's not what it was
[1:37:06] when it was talking about the scripture
[1:37:07] because I'm saying perfect love combines
[1:37:11] the uh the the wisdom of is a serpent
[1:37:15] and the homelessness of a dove
[1:37:17] now the sureness is not slight condensed
[1:37:21] but Swift discernment
[1:37:23] it can be read like oh I know where
[1:37:25] that's coming from but you know what you
[1:37:27] can't have that you don't even can you
[1:37:29] bring that picture back up again please
[1:37:30] my brother thank you you can't have that
[1:37:32] you don't have knowledge of God in you
[1:37:33] because but Obama said the knowledge
[1:37:35] about the U.S no make sure to know what
[1:37:37] is good and what is not you're able to
[1:37:40] judge right now people will say you know
[1:37:42] unbelievers I said oh um but Jesus said
[1:37:45] in Matthew 7 don't judge no man y'all
[1:37:47] know that and they bring that scripture
[1:37:48] to you and they must go to scripture but
[1:37:50] Paul also said he said it's spiritual
[1:37:52] man
[1:37:53] does what
[1:37:55] so it's not with him judge no more it's
[1:37:57] the knowledge of God in him that's
[1:37:58] judging that man
[1:37:59] so it's not it's not trying to no
[1:38:01] condemn any man it's still you know you
[1:38:04] know it's absorbent it's tolerant but is
[1:38:05] it kind of the word the guy said the
[1:38:07] word says you're wrong brother you're
[1:38:08] wrong
[1:38:09] amen hallelujah so you know it's just
[1:38:12] amazing how you know we just uh
[1:38:15] let the world do the to their own things
[1:38:17] bro I believe in in the Judgment of the
[1:38:19] holy spirit amen it's perfect amen like
[1:38:22] let's go back to what we're talking
[1:38:23] about shooting us up you know Street
[1:38:24] discernment whether it is of god or not
[1:38:27] now at the same time it's bringing about
[1:38:30] perfect love is bringing about
[1:38:34] um homelessness of a dove
[1:38:37] so as much as he's standing for the
[1:38:39] truth it's not losing its innocence
[1:38:41] amen is still serving the law
[1:38:44] blamelessly I can see that in scriptures
[1:38:46] remember I I maybe I would just I'll
[1:38:48] leave that um some other time but when
[1:38:50] Jesus uh went into the temple
[1:38:53] and whip them out and say this is my
[1:38:55] father's house it's like oh he he
[1:38:57] doesn't believe it's an unbeliever
[1:38:59] but he was doing the right work but at
[1:39:02] the same time it's not losing his
[1:39:04] innocence as as a man of God they could
[1:39:07] not say anything against them
[1:39:08] it was blameless
[1:39:10] so
[1:39:12] this this scripture uh Matthew 10 6 16
[1:39:15] just talking about those combining those
[1:39:16] two together it's a paradox it's like a
[1:39:18] it's a like a simile it's just it's
[1:39:20] really two different characters all
[1:39:22] those characters coming together but
[1:39:23] that's what prophetler does in this age
[1:39:25] you know the devil is not kind of
[1:39:26] smarter than his creator
[1:39:33] for you
[1:39:35] perfect love gives you the boldness to
[1:39:38] take a firm step
[1:39:40] firm stand
[1:39:42] not missing words
[1:39:44] with respect to what you believe and
[1:39:46] express the love of Christ at the same
[1:39:47] time
[1:39:49] that's what prophet does
[1:39:50] perfect love calls for a total
[1:39:52] separation from the world
[1:39:54] even though we live in the world we are
[1:39:57] not of this world
[1:39:58] Hallelujah
[1:40:00] Exodus 19 if you want to write it down
[1:40:02] when God came down to the to the
[1:40:04] Israelites there he wanted to speak to
[1:40:06] them and said go separated said we'll
[1:40:07] clean yourself up
[1:40:08] what did he have for them perfect love
[1:40:10] he wanted to communicate with them it
[1:40:12] was not successful but in our age
[1:40:13] successful now because God came down
[1:40:16] himself
[1:40:17] he tried to do it you know he wanted to
[1:40:19] he just wanted to fellowship with his
[1:40:21] people but there were two um it was so
[1:40:23] too strong for them to take at that
[1:40:24] point in time but right now God doesn't
[1:40:26] send it again
[1:40:27] and it's here
[1:40:28] amen
[1:40:31] perfect love course separation Lexus 19
[1:40:33] and also second Corinthians 6 14 to 18
[1:40:36] foreign
[1:40:40] romance 12 for verse 1 to 2. basically I
[1:40:44] already Amplified version and this is
[1:40:46] what it says it says therefore I urge
[1:40:48] you brothers and sisters by the mercy of
[1:40:50] God to present to your bodies
[1:40:52] dedicating all of yourself
[1:40:55] set apart as a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:40:59] and well pleasing to God which is a
[1:41:02] rational logical intelligent act of
[1:41:04] worship and listen to verse two now do
[1:41:06] not be confirmed like I said a perfect
[1:41:07] love calls for total what separation
[1:41:12] do not be confirmed to this word any
[1:41:14] longer with the superficial values and
[1:41:15] Customs there is all over the place
[1:41:17] superficial
[1:41:19] but be transformed I love I love this
[1:41:22] part I'm progressively changed
[1:41:25] so the changes is Gradle it's a process
[1:41:27] it doesn't it's not it's an instance
[1:41:29] it's not overnight God is just giving
[1:41:31] you strength and then you just you just
[1:41:32] see your life just change like wow you

[1:41:36] wife you just oh God this is me you see
[1:41:38] the way you're acting your husband
[1:41:39] that's not the way you were when you got
[1:41:41] married to her
[1:41:42] it's not you no more it's a progressive
[1:41:44] change as if my choice spiritually
[1:41:48] amen by the renewing of your mind
[1:41:51] focusing on Godly values and ethical
[1:41:54] attitude so so now your focus is not on
[1:41:56] oh let me try to please my wife please
[1:41:58] my husband please my pastor your focus
[1:42:00] is ongoing values I said focusing on
[1:42:03] that things are happening behind you
[1:42:05] Hallelujah
[1:42:07] by the renewable mind focus on God's
[1:42:08] only violence and ethical attitudes so
[1:42:11] that he may prove for yourself what the
[1:42:13] will of God is
[1:42:15] that which is good
[1:42:17] and acceptable and perfect in his plan
[1:42:21] purpose for you
[1:42:23] amen am I'm almost done Brethren I hope
[1:42:25] you're enjoying it I really feel good
[1:42:27] about this and it's just you know my
[1:42:29] heart soul is just so blessed
[1:42:31] perfect love says that the environment
[1:42:33] counts
[1:42:35] the environment that it you find
[1:42:37] yourself perfect love says it counts
[1:42:41] amen
[1:42:43] I'm a Roundup for this I'll save
[1:42:45] everything else
[1:42:47] we have been causing some something very
[1:42:49] higher
[1:42:50] let's support our column
[1:42:52] we're closer Home than ever
[1:42:55] don't let the pattern of the war there's
[1:42:56] so much distraction in the world right
[1:42:57] now good distraction I'm there very
[1:42:59] enticing like like Bible said if it was
[1:43:02] possible the electricity but you know
[1:43:04] what you never received but before the
[1:43:06] financial of the world before this water
[1:43:07] was even was even made we had the seat
[1:43:09] of God in us
[1:43:10] so don't let us focus on where we're
[1:43:13] headed at focus on The Godly battle on
[1:43:16] the word of God on what has given on
[1:43:17] that perfect love and ignore everything
[1:43:19] else
[1:43:21] no no forget about the associations the
[1:43:24] modern ways the trends the distractors
[1:43:26] and focus on our goal let me let me read
[1:43:29] this prescription while I end this you
[1:43:31] know perfect love say something right
[1:43:32] here he said there's no fear first John
[1:43:34] 4 18 there's no fear in love
[1:43:37] but perfect love casted out what
[1:43:39] so the Devil comes with combine taxes to
[1:43:42] cause fear
[1:43:43] and you know how they're in the war
[1:43:44] right now there's so much fear
[1:43:45] Everybody's scared of Russia is Captain
[1:43:47] America America is scared of China
[1:43:50] that's what the devil brought all the
[1:43:51] taxes bring about fear but this one what
[1:43:53] does what it cast out that fear and
[1:43:55] that's that's all we need to to to to to
[1:43:57] equip ourselves in this world to
[1:43:59] interact with this world that we are
[1:44:00] because we know of this world we have a
[1:44:02] home we're headed to
[1:44:03] Romans 8 15 said but ye have not
[1:44:05] received the spirit of bonded to what to
[1:44:08] fear but you have received the spirit of
[1:44:10] what
[1:44:11] when you step into this this position
[1:44:13] right here in perfect love what is
[1:44:14] welcome you become adopted sons and
[1:44:16] daughters amen praise the Lord and say
[1:44:19] you have no you have received the spirit
[1:44:21] of adoption whereby you cry I have a
[1:44:22] father so that's where production makes
[1:44:24] you cry into father daily
[1:44:25] non-stop that's not you no more
[1:44:27] the last scripture I'm going to read
[1:44:29] right here it's the second Timothy 1
[1:44:30] verse 7 said for God I've not given us
[1:44:32] the spirit of fear
[1:44:34] but of what power
[1:44:36] I love that
[1:44:38] you're gonna have power to do to be
[1:44:39] whatever way you want to be on the God's
[1:44:41] will and I guess perfect will and of
[1:44:44] love
[1:44:46] I love it sound mind
[1:44:48] we have a we have so much uh so many God
[1:44:51] has given us on this age we don't need
[1:44:53] any extra thing not nothing extra it's
[1:44:56] as simple as the prophet brought it
[1:44:58] if we're just lay on it and just let it
[1:45:01] just seep in we'll be just fine
[1:45:03] amen praise the Lord let's buy us
[1:45:06] everybody
[1:45:20] Lord we thank you tonight Lord for your
[1:45:22] word
[1:45:24] it's real lord Jesus
[1:45:28] it's from you and we know Lord that you
[1:45:30] have a plan
[1:45:33] and we are part of your plan Lord Jesus
[1:45:36] because we know we have to interact in
[1:45:38] this world and you know
[1:45:40] fix different trials on this world and
[1:45:41] you know just because whenever I'm here
[1:45:43] we have surrendered Our Lives to you
[1:45:46] they have given all to you but we still
[1:45:48] have to go to these trials around us
[1:45:49] Lord
[1:45:50] they give us strength in our hearts Lord
[1:45:53] is not to be distracted by any not to
[1:45:55] the character about whatever is going
[1:45:56] around us or are we how good it looks
[1:45:58] but just focus on you Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:00] and just live our life for you and just
[1:46:02] follow let that word take his full curse
[1:46:05] yes in our life that's what we ask for
[1:46:07] Lord we have don't ask for anything
[1:46:08] special we're gonna ask for something no
[1:46:10] no out there that's that looks so low so
[1:46:13] ambiguous Lord reaction just for you
[1:46:15] to living our life daily
[1:46:18] suppress our flesh and let this it lets
[1:46:22] your spirit take perfect control
[1:46:24] kill us if you don't have that perfect
[1:46:26] love feel us with that perfect love it's
[1:46:27] very important Lord that we can conquer
[1:46:29] the Fearless in the world today the
