wonderful thing and I hear that uh we have um almost permission granted I heard a couple of amens that we could go after nine is that right we're okay I know we have children I that have to go to school we certainly won't keep us here late tonight Revelations chapter 3 Revelations chapter 3 verse one continuing our study in the exposition of the seven Church ages in my count it looks like it's number 47 we're in the sardan church age Revelations 3:1 and unto the angel of the church in Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for that ear to hear what the spirit saith Lord and father we thank you that there's a promise that Lord there's some whose names you will not blot out of the book of life but father we don't look at ourselves in that position father we're so thankful that we look at ourselves in the book of the the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world Lord your choice Lord Jesus and we know there's there's a place father in that book where the names will never ever be changed and father we just thank you for that Revelation Lord we thank you for sending us a prophet we thank you Lord Jesus for your word Lord and how wonderful it is to worship you you in spirit and in truth tonight we just invite you Lord to have the preeminence now as we go forwards in all that's said and done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just a couple of announcements we have the Youth Event uh which is actually the financial session this Sunday after service uh 2 p.m in the basement um we have brother mvin taking the service service on Sunday as well as well as the 24th we have brother gift marufu here on December the eth he is formerly of Saskatoon Tabernacle now living in Zambia with his family and uh I wanted to bring a big hello from Brother Cadre Diggs I spoke to him today and uh he says God bless you all and we're looking forward to him coming potentially in February so we'll see what happens there seems brother hyre he likes the the cool weather here he likes to wear a beanie they call it down south and we know what is a toque it's uh wonderful to have friends in this gospel are you happy tonight tonight I want to pick up where we left off in the sardan church age and it's right in the middle of uh the discussion about election and I don't think I did it justice on Sunday I think I maybe only just barely scratched the surface of it and we'll probably spend a little bit of time talking about election in the future here but tonight I just wanted to maybe make a little bit of a correction to what I said last Wednesday um and even on Sunday I might have said it as well I can't remember but I I said I compared it to getting into the weeds talking about getting into the the discussion of election and uh it certainly isn't a weedy topic and I got I just got thinking about it that's what pre teachers do sometimes start overthinking stuff you know the wheat and the weeds and you know it's in a position the story of election the idea of election is not an easy one it's not a simple discussion is what I mean it's it's not easy to walk through it's long grass it's reads maybe a bit swampy it's a little bit difficult to walk through and sometimes the idea of election can be a very difficult thing to understand and personally I believe it's exactly that way for purpose it's exactly that way for the purpose of Faith because if we could understand everything then we wouldn't need faith and we need to have faith without faith it's what imposs it's impossible to please God so we have to live by faith and we know the word says the just will live by faith we have to have faith and I believe the the the whole entire discussion about election is by faith we have to know that we have to look at it from that perspective and and it's not an understanding but we try to understand it the best that we can we try to explain it the best we can and you know with call it the tools that we've been given and I think the best tool that we've been given is a Vindicated profit in the age in which we live that is the voice box that God chose to actually Express himself to the age through and to tie up all the Loose Ends and to cap off the the seven Church ages to to eliminate all the Mysteries and here we are we find ourselves in the exposition of the seven Church ages again in the sardian church age talking about election picking up in uh in this where we left off we left off with the scripture maybe I'll just read the scripture it's out of Luke 10 verse 17- 24 um and the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject to us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven that's pretty fast that's like that behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and Hast revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them I can't help but imagine that Jesus would probably say the exact same thing to the people who believe this message of the hour don't Rejoice because you're able to see Devil's move don't Rejoice because of the many signs and wonders don't Rejoice because of the first and the second pole but Rejoice because of the spoken word third pole Rejoice because you understand that when you speak why it's the same as deity speaking amen that's what the prophet said and and further to that that's what God Said through the prophet amen we know this isn't just a prophet speaking many people would like to say well that was just a prophet that was just the prophet well what part of it is the prophet and you know we've had this discussion I'm not going to go too far into that but I just think it's beautiful here we have Jesus telling his disciples I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them have an ear to hear what what the spirit saith unto the Church of leoda so going on he says the Book of Life is definitely located in heaven and we know last night he actually or last Wednesday we read where he asked the question where is it located he's answering it here The Book of Life is definitely located in heaven and will appear at the great white Throne judgment in these verses Jesus said that the names were written in heaven they were written in the Book of Life for that is where names are placed Jesus was speaking to the 70 verse 17 but he was also speaking to the 12 verse 23 these had all been rejoicing that Devils were subject to them in jesus' name isn't it interesting it just makes me think about it Jesus thinned out the herd when he said I and my father are one and unless you eat and drink Eat My Flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you the 70s said whoa now you're going crazy now we can't follow you this was just before this Christ's rejoiner was Rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you but rather that your names are written in the heaven book of life you will note here that Judas was one of those who were casting out devils in jesus' name but we know that he was a devil the son of predition John 670 and 71 Jesus answered them have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil he spake of judas's scariot the son of Simon for it was for he it was that should betray him being one of the twel it's just really as I've been studying this it really got me thinking what would it be like to be one of those 12 be in that position to think my the master has said that one of us is a devil that that would be humbling that that would really cause me to stir I I would think Lord have mercy my John 17:12 while he was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scripture might be fulfilled John 13101 and 18 10 to 11 and 18 Jesus saith unto him he that is washed needeth not safe to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not not all clean I speak not of you all I know whom I have chosen but that the scripture might be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me I got thinking about this did Judas know while Jesus was saying these words did he know in his heart I I took a little look at it and uh maybe we'll get into a little bit later I just wanted to pose that question throw it out there just to think about brother Bram in paragraph 111 here in my book he says now if language means anything at all we must admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus John 1318 yet he was not clean John 13:10 to11 Judas was also given to Jesus by the Father John 17:12 Let It Be noted here that the choose and giving is the exact parallel as in the illustration of Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau for though Esau and Pharaoh were both forn they were predestinated to wrath isn't it interesting how the devil just loves to eliminate election and predestination get those two words out of the Bible and everyone can come right everyone's going to be saved anybody that can say jesus' name will just it'll be just fine right he's a do old grandpa that's what they make him while the end of Moses and Jacob was glorification first Peter 2 8-9 a shows both reprobates and elect even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation Judas was numbered with the 12 and actually had a part with them in the ministry previous to Pentecost but we know brother bradam said it when it came time for The Showdown when it came time for the word when it came time to be baptized with the Holy Spirit which we preach about thoroughly he couldn't go all the way Judas could not go on to receiving the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and that's why he wasn't there but I want to say this as we go brother Bram says it a little bit later on but I just want to try and encourage us if anybody has any doubt or any fear in their life to say well brother Barry he just said that you know maybe even Judas didn't even know whether he was a son of predition or not we know the Scripture it says it uh maybe we'll get into it I'm saying it now I guess but Jesus asked a question and all the disciples it says all of them asked amongst themselves Lord is it I so that would caused me to believe that perhaps even Judas didn't even know it but he was he was definitely uh the son of predition because he fulfilled that scripture but that's neither here or there whether he knew it or not but what I want to say tonight the devil is going to say to us well if you don't know maybe there's question in your life maybe you don't know maybe you don't know there is a solid evidence tonight I want to say there's no doubting your position in Christ Jesus the devil's going to come around and say well you did this so no or or you did that so no or maybe the other so there's no way and and just try and put a little bit of seed of doubt in your mind but just just remember there is a very clear evidence a very clear evidence and we're going to get to it Judas could not go on to receiving the Holy Ghost if you've gone on to receiving the Holy Ghost you're sealed to the day of your Redemption if you have the desire in your heart to go on to receiving of the Holy Ghost you're sealed to the day of your Redemption because the Lord will give it to you all you have to do is meet his requirements not everyone can desire to get the Holy Ghost in their life brothers and sisters but the devil's going to come in and say well you know maybe you don't have it maybe you do have it you know all of that that that selft talk that confusion but if you have the desire just keep going just keep marching don't get weary and well-doing keep going to church keep coming com to Sunday school keep worshiping God keep reading your Bible keep praying keep listening to the message God is faithful and just he will give you the Holy Ghost if you have the desire for the Holy Ghost and you'll know it acts 1:16 to 17 men and Brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas which was guide to them that took Jes Jesus I just love this scripture how can people say that the Holy Ghost and and god Jehovah are separate how how can that ever happen David never had the Holy Ghost did he the Holy Ghost wasn't yet given but the word says by the Holy Ghost he spake these words for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry brother Bram goes on to say the part that Judas obtained amongst the 12 and then lost was neither inferior to the ministries of the other 11 nor was it a devilish foreign Ministry interjected amongst the ministries of the others I think I'm just going to let that soak we'll read it again I think it really is important to focus on this a little bit to remember the part that Judas obtained amongst the 12 and then lost L was neither inferior to the ministries of the other 11 nor was it a devilish foreign Ministry interjected amongst the ministries of the others it wasn't some different Minister that just popped up and popped in and somehow was able to just say Amen to the word with them he had all that they had everything that they were doing he was doing this part's amazing to me acts 1:25 that he may take part of this ministry and upon ostle ship from which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place and we know this is where they cast lots and we know the lot I believe fell on mithas is that right going on brother Bram he says in paragraph 113 Judas a devil lost a god-given holy ghost Ministry and killed himself and went to his own place predition we know that's where he went went his name was even in the book of life but his name was blotted out as I speak tonight and as as I think about all this I just can't help but think that you know everyone's name must be written everyone must have a name written on the book anyone who ever existed in the world must have their name written on the book Maybe I'm Wrong someone might want to discuss it in in a kind way I appreciate it if you're kind if I am wrong but I'll receive it right we're we're all about being able to be corrected if it's according to the word but I just can't help but think that every single human being ever expressed Before and After the flood anyone ever their names were written God knew that person there's not one person that was just surprised or accidental or just slipped in and slipped out or whatever that was missed or forgotten the books must be amazing that will be just astounding to see that day where the books are open and the judgment is set my but here we have Judas a devil this is why I'm saying this brothers and sisters because some people are actually they're they're created unto wrath that's what the word says but their names are in a book and somehow some way they choose to actually forfeit that position in the book it's amazing to think about brother bradam says now before we pursue this thought on Judas let us go back to the Old Testament and see where God did the same thing in Genesis 3523 to 26 the sons of Jacob were 12 in number and their names were as follows Reuben Simeon Levi Judah isachar and zebulun Joseph and Benjamin Dan and naali Gad and Asher these 12 sons descendants become the 12 tribes of Israel with the exception that Joseph did not have a tribe named after him for in the Providence of God there were to be 13 tribes and Joseph's two sons were given the honor of bringing the 12 to 13 outside of this who talks like that who says these things you know know of course that this was necessary as Levi was separated unto God for the priesthood thus when Israel left Egypt and God gave them the Tabernacle in the wilderness we find the tribe of Levi ministering to the 12 tribes named Ruben Simeon isachar Judah zebulun Benjamin Dan napali Gad Asher Ephraim and Manasseh so now it's changed Ed the order of the host names the order of the host names them thus in numbers 10 11-28 there is no mention of Joseph or Levi but when we look at Revelations 7: 4 to8 where it says there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel it names them thus Judah Ruben Gad Asher napali man Manasseh Simeon Levi isachar zebulun Joseph Benjamin we are back to the 12 tribes with Levi and Joseph named amongst them but with Dan and Ephraim missing the question now arises why are these two tribes deleted and I I just can't help but think the theologians don't like talking about this stuff this this is not skim milk the answer lies in Deuteronomy 29: 16 to 20 for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we came through the Nations which ye passed by and ye have seen their Abominations and their Idols wood and stone silver and gold which were among them lest there should be among you a man or woman or family or child whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord Our God to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth Gall and wormwood and it came to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he blessed himself in his heart saying I shall have peace though I walk in the imagination of my heart to add drunkenness to thirst the Lord will not spare him but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under Heaven wow I say Lord let us not walk in the imaginations of our heart herein is pronounced the curse against idolatry or spiritual fornication the tribe that turned to idolatry was to have its name blotted out and brother bradam he talks about this I'm just going to mention it here because I think it's worth just dwelling on a little bit he talks about having the name blotted out from under heaven but he also says it says under heaven not in heaven and that's a very important fact of the word of God to recognize we'll get into it a little further brother banam talks about it but people can have their name blotted out from under heaven but not in heaven the Providence of God here we have brother banam saying the tribe that turned away to all idolatry was to have its name blotted out remember God deals with Israel as a nation and he deals with the Gentiles as individuals so I could read this tonight and say the person that turned to idolatry was to have his name blotted out help us Lord and the history of the two tribes whose names were blotted out because of idolatry is found in First Kings 1225 to30 then jeroboam built in sheim in Mount Ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from then and built in pinu and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the House of David so smooth and religious if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto the Lord even unto rabo the king king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to rabam King of Judah politics creeping into the church now whereupon the king took took counsel from where did he take counsel is what I want to say where did that King get counsel he took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem I'll just make it easy for you to worship we'll just all do it the way that you know it's simple right Behold thy Gods oh Israel which brought thee what up out of the land of Egypt Devils don't die Devils don't die I just want to say this Exodus 32 are you able to go there brother Exodus 32 if you have your Bibles you could turn there too Exodus 32 the story of The Exodus I just want to tie it back together to say this is we we all know it I'm sure but sometimes it's good just to dwell on it a little bit in Exodus 32:1 and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount we you know the story I'll just give the background the children of Israel were out now God told them you'll Worship in this mountain he told the people to wait here I've got a meeting I got to go to the top of the mountain where there's thunder and lightning and smoke and fire and uh he feared exceedingly but anyways the people were down Moses went up he spending time with God he was a long time he was 40 days people don't like it when you got to wait even then I I I was looking at it thinking my even then people were impatient and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount this is verse one of 32 Exodus the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him up make us Gods which shall go before us boy they wanted to be religious they didn't want to get a guitar and start playing rock and roll right they wanted to be religious it's amazing and said unto him up make us Gods which shall go before us for as this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we what not what has become of him man we're waiting too long our time is just too valuable we can't wait anymore just get it going and a it's amazing this whole thing Aaron said unto them break off the Golden Earrings which are in your ears of your wives and your sons and your daughters and bring them up unto me and all the people break off the Golden Earrings and their ears brought them unto Aaron and he received them in their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and he after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy Gods o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt this is while they were yet being brought up out of the land of Egypt here they are saying this the exact same words that we read tonight Devils don't die after he received them at their hand and fashion it with uh sorry I read that already verse 5 and when Aaron saw it he built an altar before it and Aaron made Proclamation and said tomorrow is a feast to the Lord they rose up early on the Tom my they must have been tired after all their work but they were able to rise up early on the moral to do their religion right and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play and we know the story as it goes on I'm not going to go too far into that we know the Lord said man Moses I'm done with these people already they're a stiff neck ridiculous people that just won't listen um I'll just do away with them I'll wipe them off the face of the Earth and I'll start a new nation in you and we know just for the record brothers and sisters this is the the value of a Prophet this Prophet is the one that stayed with the Lord isn't it interesting that even the most religious supporters of this prophetic Ministry that led them up out of Egypt here they are a few days removed from a prophet and they're the most religious people worshiping calfs Lord help us we cannot stray there is no straying from the word of a prophet as soon as we do it brothers and sisters that's what's going to happen and it's going to be oh so religious so religious but it's just exactly isn't it th those calfs there you are behold the god that brought you up out of Egypt the one that parted the waters goodness sakes thank the Lord for a prophet my I apologize I got so excited I don't even know where I left off just be honest oh there it is herein is pronounced the curse against idolatry or spiritual fornication the tribe that turned to idolatry was to have its name blotted out in the history of the two tribes whose names were blotted out because of idolatry was found in First Kings and we read about jeroboam I'll just read I think it's verse 28 and they shall kill me and go again again to rabo King of Judah the politics I'm going to lose out and they'll just run after him whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it's too much for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods oh Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt how God must have just hated hearing that and he set the one in bethl and the other one put he in Dan and this thing became sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan Ephraim is joined to his idols let him alone that's a scripture Hosea 4:17 note particularly that the punishment for idolatry was that the name of the tribe was to be blotted out from under Heaven Deuter Deuteronomy 2 9: 20 it does not say that it would be blotted out in heaven but from under heaven and that is exactly as it is for now Israel is back in Palestine and soon the Lord will seal 144,000 of them but from that number Dan and Ephraim are missing Revelation 7: 4 to8 and I heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel and of the tribe of Judah were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Reuben were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of GAD were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Asher were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of nephalem were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Manasses were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Simeon were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Levi were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of isachar were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of zabulon were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Joseph were sealed 12,000 of The Tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000 note Dan and Ephraim missing now with this this see Daniel 12:1 which refers to these 144,000 being sealed during the six seal and the time of the Great Tribulation or Jacob's trouble and at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book however after this period of tribulation during the Millennium as seen by Ezekiel in 48: 1 to8 and 22 to 29 we see the tribes back once more in divine order but from the time that Ephraim and Dan joined themselves to Idols they died and those tribes have no more recognition now I realize that since the destruction of Jerusalem all records of all tribes have been lost so that no one can say for sure what tribe he is from but God knows that great God who is bringing Israel back to Palestine knows exactly which tribe every true Israelite is from and from all the assembled 144,000 Dan and Ephraim will be missing here are the tribes of Israel now these are the names of the tribes from the north and to the coast of the way by hethlon as the one goeth to HTH has zanan the border of Damascus northward to the coast of HTH for these are his sides East and West a portion for Dan and by the border of Dan from the East side unto the West Side a portion of Asher and by the border of Asher from the East side even unto the West Side a portion for naftali and by the border of naftali from the East side unto the West Side a portion for manasse and by the border of Manasseh from the East side unto the West Side a portion for Ephraim and by the border of Ephraim from the East side even unto the West Side a portion for Reuben and by the border of Reuben from the East side to the west side a portion for Judah and by the border of Judah from the East side unto the West Side shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and 20,000 reads in breadth and in length as one of the other parts from the East side unto the west side and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it we know that's Ezekiel 481 to8 moreover from the possession of the Levites and from the possession of the city being in the midst of that which is the princes between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall be for the prince sorry this is Ezekiel 48:22 to 29 that brother Brandon mentioned earlier as for the rest of the tribes from the East side unto the West Side Benjamin shall have a portion and by the border of Benjamin from the East side unto the West Side Simeon shall have a portion and by the border of Simeon from the East side to the West Side isachar a portion and by the border of isachar from the East side unto the West Side zebulun a portion and by the border of zebulun from the East side unto the West Side Gad a portion and by the border of GAD at the South Side Southward the Border shall be even from Tamar unto the Waters of strife in Kadesh and to the river toward the great sea this is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance and these are their portions saith the Lord God another illustration that we might take is the story of Israel leaving Egypt for Canaan land I think this is pretty much where we'll end off tonight maybe we'll go a little further we'll see another illustration that we might take out is the story of Israel leaving Egypt for Canaan land God's purpose in this age was to bring Israel out and to take them in and we know in the Christian walk there's two parts to it coming out of and going into this is not just about the children of Israel we got to come out of all of our old systems all of our old teachings all of our own thoughts and ideas and come into the person of Jesus Christ we have got to come into the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a coming out and a going in to the end that they might serve him thus when they left Egypt they all came out under the blood of the sacrificial lamb even cor and Dayan why they all went through the waters of baptism in the Red Sea they all enjoyed the mighty Miracles all ate of the Mana all drank of The Rock and in so far as obvious external blessings and manifestations were concerned they all partook in like and equal manner all the children of Israel they were blessed just because they were the children of Israel my but when they came to Moab those who joined in the Feast of Baal peor they all died their carcasses fell in the wilderness and we know that this is where they actually were persuaded you know what we're all the same we all worship the same God let's just get together and have a feast and we'll worship together and everything will be fine right no no God said separate yourselves do not mix with the people in the land and they went completely against the word of God and that's why they found themselves in a situation at Moab at the Feast of Baal peor their carcasses fell in the wilderness for it was there that they refused the word of God and turned from it and we know it was everyone who was I think 20 or 21 years of age and younger they're the ones that went into the promised land and all of the elders all of them their carcasses fell in the wilderness that's what he's talking about here now now this is what Hebrews 6 1:9 speaks of which was brought out so carefully in the pergam and age and I think I needed to correct myself too I referred to this as uh Romans 6 I think maybe on Sunday I uh yeah just thinking too much again but um brother Bram he says you can't go along with just part of the word you have to take all the word and we know that Hebrews 6 um we probably won't read it tonight maybe we will next time Hebrews 6 is you know where the the the rain falls on the just and the unjust alike the the story that brother bradam talks about how he didn't understand that scripture and how the Lord showed him the vision of the Earth being a a dis up Earth and how he saw the man in white sowing seeds in the day and at night time the the the villain came behind the man dressed in black sewing seeds also seeds of tears and and he was able to catch the revelation of this that the the wheat and the weeds they all Rejoice on the same rain I believe we talked about that last last time brother bam talked about the corn the the wheat corn and we won't go too far into that but you know he says here you can't go along with just part of the word you have to take all the word and I just think that's such a beautiful thing because we don't have to try and interpret and try and figure out what part to take out and and what part to put in we can just say be it unto me according to the Thy word let let it be all of your word and and let me become subject to all of it let me change to match that word not try and change that word to match me brother brandom goes on to say there are people who seem involved in the things of God Almost 100% they are like Judas no one but Jesus knew exactly what kind of a person Judas was not even Judas but Jesus knew but I'm going to just reiterate tonight and say brothers and sisters we don't judge anyone we're not interested in judging anyone we want to judge ourselves let's take ourselves and subject ourselves into the mirror of God's word and see when we look into it do we see the reflection of Christ or do we see our old selves because if we see our old selves we just need to say Lord help me I don't want to see the old me I want to see you when I look into your word into the mirror of your word so the day came that Judas did exactly what Israel did at ba peor well he didn't go and worship at the feast did he there wasn't a a time where he just took another wife and did all of that no he's not talking about the literal he's talking about the spiritual and I know we're all there but maybe just for the sake of discussion I'm trying to maybe dramatize it a little bit he decided that he wanted to join with the false Vine forces enter into a financial political organization of anti- word Antichrist religion not just Antichrist but Antichrist religion this was religious people he was fooled it says here the other 11 were not they could not be for they were of the very elect so when Judas left and betrayed the Lord his name was removed from The Book of Life Revelations 22:19 this just brings to mind the thought that I don't know somewhere along the way maybe we'll see it in the future here brother Bram I can't remember exactly where he says it but you know the uh the Jews there's elected Jews they're not just uh 144,000 leftovers there's very elected Jews as well they're not bride of course but they're elected of God it's a very interesting study brother Bram goes on to say here in paragraph 122 in closing I will call the musici musicians and we'll close off here with this paragraph because we'll pick up here again and this this paragraph is one of those paragraphs it just is now I'm sure that you have noticed that those whose names were in The Book of Life were a part of the religious order of that day and centered around the true worship of God and worship of him him though they did not worship according to the truth word my I just can't help but think of the the message brother bradam preached you know trying to do God a service without it being his will and and in that message he said you know what they had all of the religious motion all of it they could scream and shout and play and dance and sing they had they could do it all even preach it but not be completely on the word is false and that's the key it's either true or it's false like Judas they didn't go all the way see how Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth he shared no knowledge of the Mysteries he had a Ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devils in jesus' name but when The Showdown came he sold out for gold and political power and I want to say to us brothers and sisters never let us sell out for gold or political power popularity or friends you know what the word is what is true and all else is false and even if we wind up being the only one to be able to say be it unto me according to Thy word that's what God's looking for brother Ram said even in a city of a million people if there's only going to be one person saying Lord let it be me he said Let It Be You When The Showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he was devoid of the spirit now this is the part of this paragraph that I wanted to get to and I'm so glad we're able to close off here make no mistake about it brothers and sisters make no mistake about a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way not part way he says that's the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes fail right there and when they fail to go into that word their names are taken off the book of life you know I know people and I'm sure we all do maybe stand with me as we close here we we all know people they're not half-hearted about things when they decide they're going to do something in their life they they study it and they research it and and maybe they save for it and they plan for it and they think about it and they talk about it and they plan for it and they save for it and they study it that's the things of this world do we do that with the word of God in our lives in our homes I just can't help but think you know when we are all in that's our evidence brothers and sisters don't doubt as long as your heart is there and you're Allin with your heart and you know genuinely in your heart we know in our heart whether we're honest and all in or whether we're not we know it we know it we can hide it real good but we know and God knows I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way amen and that's our evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost not one of the gifts of the Spirit no no our ability to be all in that's where we need to be let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father tonight Lord we thank you for your word thank you for sending us a Vindicated Prophet Lord a man that you could use that would be fully surrendered Lord to think that out of all of the millions and billions of people after or during the life of that man no one else no one else was chosen by you worthy enough to pack this word but you chose him father a man of your own choosing to pack this word and Lord we're so thankful that he was honest with it and Lord I just can't help but think based on all that we've said tonight knowing that when your prophet he preached the seventh seal he prayed at the end and he said Lord if I've got to go down to the river and the waves start coming in and I have to lay down this old sword let someone pick it up that will be honest with it I can't help but think there's answer to that prayer there's people who are honest with your word that have picked it up and and they're willing to subject themselves wholly and completely to you and your word father tonight I pray that each one of us would be those subjects and I pray that we could go forwards Lord and look for those others in the City of Calgary who are that way as well we know that the first hour worker was entitled to the same rate of pay as the 12th hour worker all of them are given the ability to have eternal life and father we're so thankful for the the work that you've done for us through US Lord and that you continually do in our lives lord it's only because of your grace that we are able to stand it's only by your grace that we have breath in our lungs father food in our cupboards jobs to go to Lord all of it a church to attend father it's all because of you it's all by your grace we thank you for your grace Lord thank you for your goodness thank you for the Revelation in the day in which we live father help us to receive the revelation of your word to the maximum potential that we could be filled with your spirit Lord Jesus that we would find ourselves exactly where we left off in this word tonight Lord oh Father we love you and thank you we just want to commit each life into your hands now For Your Glory as we go our separate ways be with those who couldn't come tonight Lord
