[4:37] Hallelujah God bless you tonight welcome
[4:40] to the house of the Lord each and
[4:43] everyone I believe something special is
[4:45] in store
[4:46] tonight we just
[4:48] have a couple of requests we'd like to
[4:51] bring before the church before we change
[4:53] the order and invite brother mvin
[4:55] Panetta to come and take the word just
[4:58] have a request for sister Judith who is
[5:01] at Urgent Care tonight knew would be in
[5:04] service but uh she thinks maybe she has
[5:06] a bit of
[5:07] pneumonia so she has a request here that
[5:10] she wanted to bring before the church I
[5:12] have a request that I'd like to bring
[5:14] before the church I had an old friend
[5:16] reach out to me who
[5:21] uh he found out about who I am and where
[5:25] I'm at in my life I haven't talked to or
[5:28] seen this gentleman for probably just
[5:32] about 20 plus
[5:34] years and there's a great transformation
[5:37] that he's witnessed and he said that he
[5:39] wants to participate he wants to come to
[5:42] church he wants to get to know the God
[5:45] that I know and to me that's astounding
[5:48] because it's my past that I'm not proud
[5:51] of that
[5:54] I but if he wants to get to know the God
[5:57] that I know I want him to come if you
[6:00] could remember Shawn Mitchell in your
[6:02] prayers his mom is in the hospital her
[6:05] name is Julie Mitchell she needs a touch
[6:07] from the Lord she had a a hip
[6:09] replacement and injury but uh and we
[6:13] certainly want to remember Sister
[6:15] Stella's
[6:16] friend chrisy for a quick recovery let's
[6:20] just go to the Lord in prayer tonight
[6:21] gracious Heavenly Father we're so
[6:23] thankful that we have a place of of
[6:26] mercy and Grace that we can come to in
[6:28] this world father where this world would
[6:31] be so full of darkness and wickedness we
[6:33] know that there is a sanctuary there's a
[6:36] place of peace and rest and that's only
[6:38] in you father that's only under your
[6:41] token father and only full obedience to
[6:44] the complete word of God entitles us to
[6:46] that Sanctuary father and tonight we
[6:48] claim that token and Lord Jesus we just
[6:51] want to hold that token over each
[6:52] request that was made known tonight
[6:54] father we pray that we could just send
[6:56] your Angels by way of sister Jud jth
[6:59] even right now father at an urgent care
[7:02] facility father we pray that you would
[7:04] just Lord undertake for her father that
[7:07] you would just be her great physician
[7:08] even right now Lord father that we could
[7:11] just stand together as a body of
[7:12] Believers here and just rebuke that
[7:14] devil in the name of Jesus Christ Lord
[7:16] Jesus not jump up and down and scream
[7:18] and shout but just speak the word and

[7:39] Resurrection then father amen father we
[7:43] pray that we would just have words fitly

[11:49] musician musicians uh I'll just
[11:53] try
[11:57] uh so so yeah let's uh read and then
[12:01] I'll explain after
[12:04] the this presentation I don't know if it
[12:07] will work okay so let's uh read two
[12:11] scriptures and then I'll let you see
[12:15] Malachi 41
[12:21] to3 I think it's okay you don't need to
[12:24] turn over there because uh we have only
[12:26] an hour so I'll try to not to hold you
[12:31] like
[12:32] Pharaoh uh I will release you early so
[12:37] Malachi 41 and3 for behold the day
[12:41] cometh amen that shall burn as an oven
[12:44] amen and all the proud yay and all that
[12:47] do wickedly shall be
[12:49] stubbled and the day that cometh shall
[12:53] burn them up said the Lord of hosts that
[12:56] it shall leave them neither Ruth nor
[12:59] Branch verse two but to you amen who's
[13:03] that you that's you and me amen that
[13:05] fear my name shall the son of
[13:08] righteousness arise with healing in his
[13:11] wings amen and ye shall go forth and
[13:15] grow up up as culbs of the stall amen a
[13:19] special location culbs of the stall and
[13:22] ye shall tread down the
[13:24] wicked they they shall be a for they
[13:26] shall be ashes under the Souls of your
[13:29] feet in the day that I shall do this
[13:31] said the Lord of hosts we will place
[13:33] this later on in a timeline but then
[13:35] let's read another scripture here which
[13:37] is uh another end time uh scripture
[13:42] here second Peter 3 11-13 seeing then
[13:46] that all these things it's saying all
[13:49] these things shall be dissolved and what
[13:52] manner of persons ought you to be in all
[13:56] holy conversation and godliness looking
[14:00] for looking for and Hasting unto the
[14:02] coming of the day of God wherein the
[14:06] Heaven's being on fire shall be
[14:09] dissolved and the elements shall melt
[14:12] with fervent heat nevertheless we amen
[14:17] you and me again according to his
[14:20] promise and what's that promise where
[14:22] can we find that promise in the word
[14:24] amen look for new heavens and new earth
[14:28] yes where where IND dwelleth
[14:30] righteousness amen may the Lord add
[14:33] blessings to the reading of his word you
[14:35] may be
[14:36] seated
[14:38] so I am I'm debating with the title
[14:41] because the thing is you can put a lot
[14:44] of titles in this uh message because
[14:46] it's the whole thing so it's the message
[14:48] in a nutshell you can say that's why
[14:50] I'll try it message in one hour because
[14:53] it's uh it's Wednesday but uh I know
[14:56] barbaric can take over or other
[14:59] ministers but I'll just uh highlight the
[15:01] points uh so I entitled this actually
[15:05] the comings of the Lord why comings
[15:07] because Jesus came in three times right
[15:10] and then we'll uh we'll put them in a
[15:13] timeline so that at least we we can have
[15:15] visuals and we know one one picture
[15:18] paints a thousand words right so you can
[15:21] it means it means you can talk 1,000
[15:24] words but then with one picture it will
[15:26] it will be equivalent so I'll I'll I'll
[15:28] try to not to speak more but I'll I'll
[15:32] try
[15:33] to uh put into uh layout so that we can
[15:37] see where we are right now we know we're
[15:39] end time message Believers amen oh by
[15:42] the way I want to acknowledge the
[15:44] presence of uh brother Ariel uh Ariel
[15:47] deuz is my massage therapist and uh we
[15:51] just invited him and he's uh here
[15:53] tonight and praise the Lord uh and who
[15:55] knows that uh he can uh be a a
[15:58] beneficiary we know it's the word of God
[16:00] so everyone if we believe the Bible
[16:03] right and and and the the word of God is
[16:06] the absolute it's not the man that is
[16:07] absolute it's the word through the man
[16:09] that is a prophet that is absolute it's
[16:12] the word of God Amen so yeah welcome uh
[16:16] brother Ariel amen
[16:19] so just a preview I know I I've been
[16:24] telling Barberry I I might repeat some
[16:26] slides but then the thing is because the
[16:28] message is Rich you cannot preach it at
[16:31] one time but then you have to go back
[16:32] and then Zoom this is a zoom out uh
[16:36] portion but then we can zoom in tonight
[16:39] also so just for those who haven't seen
[16:43] this
[16:45] presentation you can see uh where is
[16:50] the it's from eternity to
[16:52] Eternity right so you can see
[16:56] here eternity what is eternity it means
[16:59] no no beginning no end but when did Time
[17:03] start it's when God started to speak
[17:05] Amen in the beginning was the word and
[17:08] the Word was with God and the Word was
[17:09] God and the word became flesh and dwelt
[17:11] among us at the same time Genesis 1:1 in
[17:14] the beginning God created heaven and
[17:16] Earth but then the thing the thing here
[17:18] is in creation you can see Genesis 1:1
[17:20] in the beginning God created heaven and
[17:22] earth BR Branham is saying that's period
[17:24] and then between 1 one and one two could
[17:27] be millions of years ions of years we
[17:30] don't know amen but then the thing is uh
[17:33] the point here is I'm just trying to put
[17:35] it maybe in a five minute overview so
[17:38] that we can go with the topic so that we
[17:40] know where we are right now we believe
[17:42] that we are at the end because of the
[17:43] signs and because of the calendar and
[17:46] because of what's happening to the Jews
[17:48] amen so after creation it's Adam and
[17:51] then after Adam it's Noah and then Jesus
[17:54] Christ and today if you can see every
[17:56] 2,000 years there's a big milestone that
[18:00] happens in the time of Adam you can see
[18:03] here the the Earth before the fall it's
[18:06] perfect although they're created they
[18:09] were not supposed to die amen because
[18:11] he's a spoken word creation Adam is he
[18:15] he he was not supposed to fall but then
[18:17] our creation right now is through the
[18:20] union of a a man and a woman which is
[18:23] already a perver perverted creation
[18:25] that's not the original plan of God it's
[18:27] supposed to be a spoken word word but
[18:29] then we know that God has attributes
[18:31] that he wanted to uh to accomplish or
[18:34] manifest in his life or or in his being
[18:37] God that's why he allowed all these
[18:39] things it might not be the perfect will
[18:42] it is his permissive will but which will
[18:44] accomplish his perfect will amen amen so
[18:47] everything happens for a reason amen and
[18:50] everything will manifest according to
[18:52] the word of God Amen he has the
[18:55] different attributes he wanted to be a
[18:57] God so he
[18:59] and God is an object of worship so he
[19:01] must someone must worship Him and at
[19:04] first baram said he created angels first
[19:07] to worship him otherwise he cannot be
[19:09] God by him alone as Elohim amen so
[19:13] anyway so you can see the the Milestones
[19:15] that I want to run through as I I've
[19:18] said this just like a table of contest
[19:20] of time it's just like flying over
[19:22] Canada from east to west if you if you
[19:25] if you try that in Vancouver you will
[19:26] see on top from East uh the maritimes up
[19:30] to West over over BC but uh I I want you
[19:36] to be with me and then we will fly over
[19:38] time amen from eternity to Eternity and
[19:41] then this called time element is where
[19:44] we are right now amen so you can see
[19:47] from Adam to Noah is 2,000 years
[19:49] approximately okay so there's no exact
[19:52] dates but uh you you can study the Bible
[19:55] and then you will find out that the the
[19:56] flood happened in 2 348 BC okay uh we
[20:01] don't have time to prove it here but I
[20:03] believe you you believe the message of
[20:06] the hour and also those who already did
[20:08] the timelines like uh Bishop Asher who
[20:11] did this whole entire Ministry putting
[20:13] all the dates and bar branam also quoted
[20:16] Bishop Asher for those dates amen and
[20:18] that's why we're putting here it's again
[20:21] it has been preached last time we don't
[20:23] have our own thoughts our own mind we
[20:25] Just Surrender ourselves and then we'll
[20:27] put all the good things together so that
[20:30] they will become alive right amen so
[20:33] from Noah to Adam and then Jesus Christ
[20:37] from Noah is another 2,000 years and
[20:39] today is 2023 so if you if you do the
[20:42] math again another 2,000 years right and
[20:46] then beyond there we will go Millennium
[20:49] but then before that you can
[20:51] see in Adam's time it's almost perfect
[20:55] until the fall but after the fall then
[20:58] then comes death amen that's so so you
[21:02] can see here the the fall of Man in
[21:05] Genesis 2 and3 Adam set Cain and then
[21:08] from set you will see Cain he's a hybrid
[21:10] because he's a mixture right he's a mix
[21:13] of uh of the serpent and Eve amen and uh
[21:17] you can see
[21:18] Seth I didn't put Abel here because he
[21:20] was slain by Cain but all the uh the
[21:26] lineage of set up to Noah
[21:28] bar banam is saying that uh they are
[21:31] perfect sons of God it means they're
[21:33] sons of God the last Son of God is Noah
[21:36] but the Cain's uh uh offsprings they are
[21:42] mixture in Genesis 6 so actually Noah
[21:45] married from uh the daughters of men
[21:48] that's why all the sons of Noah they are
[21:50] hybrid also they have that uh uh uh
[21:54] Serpent's blood in them they're not Ser
[21:57] you can say for us uh we have the
[21:59] Serpent's blood in us because we're
[22:01] mixed already because all of mankind
[22:04] came from the the three sons of Noah
[22:07] amen because the as far as we can see
[22:10] there are only eight Souls that were
[22:11] that were left after the flood but even
[22:15] before that though we know that no uh
[22:18] Enoch was a type of the Bride he was
[22:20] raptured he didn't he was not dead amen
[22:23] he he he didn't die so quick one so the
[22:28] the hearts of uh the people in Noah's in
[22:32] Noah's time were continually evil that's
[22:35] why God even repented in creating man so
[22:39] he sent the flood you can see the flood
[22:40] there so it's approximately 2,000 hours
[22:43] uh 2,000 years so that's the first
[22:46] Milestone that we know that's why we we
[22:48] always say 6,000 years ago or 4,000
[22:52] years ago this is from today is 4,000
[22:54] years ago that's Noah amen and then what
[22:58] happened to to Noah after that it came
[23:02] Abraham and then Abraham begat Isaac the
[23:05] promised son and then Esau and Jacob
[23:08] Jacob became Israel and then the the the
[23:10] Ten Commandments and that's the law
[23:13] basically it's in Exodus 20 amen I'm I'm
[23:16] trying to rush so that at least we can
[23:18] go with the with our topic basically and
[23:20] then come Jesus Christ which is the
[23:23] shedding of blood here it's water but
[23:25] Jesus Christ shed his blood and amen for
[23:28] our salvation for our Redemption amen
[23:31] and and the exact date uh I mean
[23:34] approximate the date of uh the death of
[23:36] Jesus Christ is 33 ad but you can see
[23:39] here in between Jesus Christ and Noah is
[23:41] about 2,000 uh 2,000 years and then
[23:44] today so you can see the the
[23:48] progression from white to become darken
[23:52] darker and dark darker because the
[23:54] condition of time right now you as you
[23:57] can see what we're seeing out there is
[23:59] totally almost black out there's no more
[24:02] God out there amen it's only the only
[24:05] thing that uh God is Not uh uh he
[24:09] repented by the way and then he said I
[24:11] will not uh by the rainbow the Covenant
[24:14] he said he will not uh uh uh make this
[24:18] world perish Again by water but he
[24:21] didn't he promised it not by water but
[24:23] he will do it by fire amen still because
[24:26] of what man is uh uh status right now
[24:31] it's still continually evil amen so that
[24:35] is today so it means it's another 2,000
[24:38] years so what are we waiting for in this
[24:41] age right now is baptism of fire right
[24:45] so you can see it's the spirit which is
[24:48] fire before we cross over to the 10,000
[24:51] years of Peace there there's a lot of uh
[24:54] details here which we will tackle I hope
[24:56] I I will be able to to do it amen so you
[24:59] can see between Noah and Jesus Christ
[25:03] the only way you can be saved although
[25:05] you will not be raptured is following
[25:08] the law right the sacrifice amen
[25:12] sacrifice of bulls and goats but who can
[25:14] who can be perfect no one there's
[25:17] because an animal can cannot be a
[25:18] perfect sacrifice amen so that's why
[25:21] they waited for Jesus
[25:23] Christ to be uh crucified and you can
[25:27] see the last one that went with him is
[25:30] the thief on the cross right remember
[25:34] that one is uh he is the one the last
[25:38] predestinated SE for the Old Testament
[25:40] they've been waiting for him to accept
[25:42] Jesus Christ so that they can all be
[25:45] raptured amen imagine that a
[25:49] thief yeah it's it's it's kind of
[25:52] powerful on that on that perspective if
[25:55] we will see it because the thing is it's
[25:57] the same same for us right now until we
[25:59] see the last predestinated
[26:01] seed whether he will be the chiefest of
[26:05] Sinner chiefest of Sinners Like Me and
[26:08] some of you maybe because you might
[26:10] claim that you you don't sin but for me
[26:12] I claim I'm a sinner I'm just saved by
[26:14] grace amen so until we find that and
[26:18] it's also preached last Sunday that uh
[26:21] the thing is the good thing is uh we
[26:23] cannot all be divided it's even in the
[26:26] message that everyone must collaborate
[26:29] so that the third pool will manifest
[26:32] it's so important that's why we cannot
[26:33] forsake even the assembling of ourselves
[26:36] as we see the day approaching because uh
[26:39] it's very important actually I was
[26:41] supposed to to put a video so that at
[26:43] least there will be an intermission for
[26:45] the younger ones but I will just uh I
[26:48] will just uh uh narrate it I hope it's
[26:53] about the elephants protecting their
[26:55] calvs so basically if you see against
[26:58] the Lions basically think of the Lions
[27:00] as the as Satan and and your parents as
[27:05] the older elephants and you are the Cal
[27:08] right this is for the young people but I
[27:09] will I'll tackle the older people after
[27:12] but uh uh so the younger Cals if they
[27:17] you can see how how Satan is like a
[27:19] roaring lion seeking whom he may thear
[27:22] you know how he attacks he will attack
[27:25] when the Cal is isolated right when he's
[27:29] away from the parents and remember the
[27:32] parents remember until you receive the
[27:35] gift of the Holy Ghost your parents are
[27:37] your Holy Ghost amen so you see how the
[27:41] elephants will work out against the lion
[27:44] they will form almost a circle and the
[27:46] CBS are in the middle so imagine that as
[27:50] with the older elephants full of Faith
[27:54] Believers when they are around
[27:58] the calvs then the lion cannot attack so
[28:01] you see it's the same so don't be
[28:03] isolated amen but sometimes also with
[28:06] the older elephants if they are alone
[28:09] the lion can also attack and many lions
[28:11] will come the pride can Attack One lion
[28:14] so you see how important the the
[28:18] fellowship amen it's so important that
[28:20] we will not forsake that because when
[28:22] you're isolated that's the time the
[28:24] devil can come of course prayers must be
[28:27] between us and God but then the thing
[28:29] Fellowship is is sharpening iron you
[28:32] know iron sharpens iron we know that
[28:35] that's why when we Fellowship we talk
[28:37] about the things of God and we are after
[28:40] Fellowship almost we we're always pumped
[28:43] up amen because uh we know that's the
[28:46] importance of having a family of God
[28:49] Amen Believers of like Precious Faith
[28:52] together amen so it's so important that
[28:55] uh uh we will be together so you can see
[28:59] with with what we have with what we
[29:01] receive we know that we are at the end
[29:03] and that out there it's cruel amen we
[29:08] cannot survive by our own that's why we
[29:10] need each other amen amen brothers and
[29:12] sisters I it's not uh it's not because
[29:16] we we say that we're pumped up with
[29:18] faith we have high faith that we can
[29:19] just you know alone no we need each
[29:23] other amen and until we find that last
[29:25] pred predestinated seed until we all
[29:28] collaborate in one mind and one Accord
[29:30] amen with because we belong to a
[29:33] mystical body We Don't Belong only to CL
[29:35] wa Calgary Living Word no all all the
[29:38] church churches that believe the the
[29:42] Bible as the absolute the word of God as
[29:44] the absolute they belong to the mystical
[29:46] Body of Christ amen and we're so glad
[29:49] that uh God sent a prophet in this age
[29:52] so that we can uh we can understand the
[29:54] Bible and I will put a little bit so
[29:57] that that we can proceed so you can see
[29:59] here law right and then after that it's
[30:03] all by his grace through the through
[30:07] after he gave up The Ghost and then he
[30:10] he releases life and then where is that
[30:13] uh life now it's living in you and me in
[30:16] the form of the Holy Ghost amen so and
[30:19] we've been always talking about the
[30:21] Great Commission Matthew 289 and acts
[30:24] 238 right yes it was commiss IED to
[30:28] Peter in Acts 2 until they receive the
[30:31] uh the gift of the Holy Ghost amen but
[30:34] there are two here Matthew 28:19 go ye
[30:37] therefore preach the gospel and be
[30:40] baptized in the name of the father and
[30:41] of the son and of the Holy Spirit right
[30:43] but then in Acts 2:32 the Fulfillment of
[30:46] that commandment right in Matthew 28:19
[30:49] it was Jesus speaking to the disciples
[30:52] he didn't want to say baptize in my name
[30:55] otherwise some M some man some men can
[30:58] come and then okay you can baptize in my
[31:00] name even Paul are you baptized in the
[31:03] name of Paul no right he didn't he the
[31:06] the Commandment is preach or or or uh
[31:10] baptize in the name of the father and of
[31:12] the son and of the Holy Spirit but those
[31:14] are titles and acts 238 will manifest
[31:18] such commandment and it we it's a
[31:20] fulfillment of the Commandment you think
[31:23] all all the apostles including Paul are
[31:26] wrong and can we prove that there is
[31:28] someone that is you know baptized uh in
[31:32] the name of the titles no we cannot
[31:34] prove that and it's even in the Bible
[31:36] that's why this is called Great
[31:37] Commission amen and that is the key
[31:41] right repent and be baptize if you want
[31:44] the Holy Ghost right then you have to be
[31:48] baptized fully submerged and uh until
[31:51] that is revealed to
[31:53] us you know uh because we're still alive
[31:57] we are not like the one uh the thief on
[31:59] the cross that he cannot have the chance
[32:01] to be baptized right because it's not
[32:04] the actual baptism that will that will
[32:06] save you right or that will give you the
[32:08] Holy Ghost it's the belief in Jesus
[32:10] Christ right it's the actual belief in
[32:13] the word of God which is Jesus Christ
[32:15] himself amen and and you can see that
[32:17] that's Grace and then later on we will
[32:20] cross over today because we're waiting
[32:23] for the Rapture amen after the Rapture
[32:26] it's peace we call it 1,000 years of
[32:28] Peace because why because Satan will be
[32:30] bound amen okay let's go so for those
[32:34] who haven't seen this so you can see
[32:37] eternity from eternity to Eternity is
[32:40] like a perfect circle has no beginning
[32:43] is has no end so when did time come time
[32:47] came because of sin amen and that is
[32:51] from start to finish you can see here
[32:53] this is the element of
[32:56] time
[32:58] but Jesus blood breathes the
[33:01] Gap
[33:03] right that blood will make us back to
[33:07] Eternity again and we're so thankful on
[33:09] that blood amen he's the perfect
[33:12] sacrifice he alone right
[33:15] he's no one no one is worthy except him
[33:19] because he's uh uh we tackle about
[33:21] original sin why why do we need a virgin
[33:24] birth why why why it has to be through a
[33:27] virgin because he was not conceived
[33:30] through the union of a man and a woman
[33:32] amen is a he is a spoken word creation
[33:36] amen and he's the only perfect sacrifice
[33:39] and that's the reason why the Old
[33:40] Testament saints were not uh able to be
[33:43] raptured because they were only
[33:45] sacrificing the blood of bulls and goats
[33:47] we need to sacrifice the blood of Jesus
[33:50] Christ himself amen so from eternity
[33:53] will go back to Eternity through the
[33:55] blood of Jesus Christ
[33:57] there are three comings so we're
[34:00] tackling now so the the subject there
[34:03] are three comings of Jesus Christ and
[34:05] it's a
[34:06] timeline the first one is from birth to
[34:10] Calvary right that is uh the purpose of
[34:13] his
[34:14] coming is to redeem his
[34:17] bride right and we'll support that with
[34:19] Coates and the second coming is to catch
[34:22] away his bride from Pentecost to the
[34:27] seven Church
[34:28] ages and the third coming which is at
[34:31] the end of all things is to reign with
[34:34] his bride is after
[34:37] the the Battle of armagedon to uh before
[34:41] the new Heaven and new earth I put some
[34:43] addition there so stay stay with me so
[34:46] which is good to to see that he has
[34:49] three comings so we know the seventh
[34:52] seal is the second and third coming
[34:54] right the seventh seal the book because
[34:56] it was was uh revealed in 1963 up to
[34:59] today it's a big timeline it's not an
[35:01] event it's a timeline so once we
[35:04] understand that it's a timeline then we
[35:06] know to place where to place them amen
[35:10] so you see here question and answers
[35:12] Christ comes three times amen the first
[35:15] time he came to redeem his church is
[35:18] that right the second time he comes to
[35:20] receive his church which is the rapture
[35:23] the third time he comes with his church
[35:26] right
[35:27] he come to redeem her he comes to
[35:29] Rapture her and be caught away in the
[35:31] time of plagues and so forth returns
[35:33] back for the Millennium amen lives
[35:36] through the Millennium so then we find
[35:39] out that the coming of Christ is in
[35:41] Trinity he first to redeem his bride
[35:43] next to receive his bride and comes next
[35:47] with his bride amen ask King and Queen
[35:49] to Reign through the Millennium you know
[35:51] that everything is in Trinity and we're
[35:53] in a trinity we have a mortal body a
[35:56] Celestial body body and glorified body
[35:58] three stages brings us back to our
[36:00] Perfection again like in Eden yeah we've
[36:03] been talking about theophany before but
[36:05] this is not the topic but then the thing
[36:06] is theophany plus mortal body it will be
[36:09] when you pick that up it will be
[36:11] glorified body and the theophan is the
[36:14] soul brother Ram is saying and where is
[36:16] God now if if your soul belongs to
[36:19] Christ then where is he reigning right
[36:22] now that's why the message is Christ in
[36:24] us it's living in our Soul we and the
[36:28] Breath of God is basically it will make
[36:31] us a living Soul same as what he did in
[36:33] with Adam but this flesh it's a mortal
[36:36] flesh right it's composed of 16 elements
[36:39] that whether we live or we die as long
[36:42] as the theophany that's why we have
[36:43] someone something uh we have a place
[36:46] waiting right uh it's called theophany
[36:49] that uh for those who already uh gun
[36:51] before us they are in their theophany
[36:53] they're waiting to pick up their mortal
[36:56] body wherever it's in uh in the grave or
[36:59] or right now for us we're still living
[37:01] it will be picked up and then it will
[37:03] become a glorified body then we will
[37:04] meet him in the air but you see there
[37:07] will be this Rapture for our age we have
[37:10] to wait for everyone even the sleeping
[37:13] Saints they have to resurrect first we
[37:16] have to wait for them that's why they're
[37:18] just waiting for the Perfection of the
[37:20] last predestinated seed it's so
[37:21] important that's why for us that's the
[37:24] reason why we have fivefold Ministry for
[37:26] there are missionaries that go to field
[37:27] to look for the last predestinated seat
[37:30] amen otherwise we'll still extend our
[37:33] time here amen so we don't want to
[37:35] expedite or something it's it's
[37:37] everything is in his control but then
[37:39] the thing is if we are uh you know not
[37:43] doing our job being uh being the bride
[37:45] of Christ who's extending the grace and
[37:48] mercy here in this world then we might
[37:50] end up with more more time amen so I
[37:54] think there's a work to be done amen
[37:56] amen so you can see so the new Heaven
[37:59] and new
[38:00] earth all right 30 minutes and we can I
[38:03] have yeah 40 slides I yeah reduced them
[38:07] to half so so we we will be finishing
[38:10] yeah so and I saw a new Heaven and new
[38:13] earth so this one is new Heaven and new
[38:15] earth just to show that there is a new
[38:17] Heaven and new earth and with timelines
[38:20] it's it's it's like adoption we are
[38:23] being placed where we are so that at
[38:25] least we can have an overview on on
[38:27] where we are and when we know where we
[38:29] are and where we're
[38:31] going it it just solidifies our faith
[38:34] that oh Lord thank you for your promise
[38:36] thank you for your election thank you
[38:38] for your predestination thank you for
[38:39] showing that this to us and we will be
[38:42] at rest amen so you see here even in
[38:46] Revelations 21 1-6 and I saw a new
[38:49] Heaven and a new Earth this is John
[38:51] speaking for the first Heaven and the
[38:53] first Earth were passed away and there
[38:55] was no more sea you see see even even
[38:57] the heaven will pass away that's why
[39:00] where can you lay your your your faith
[39:04] it's in the word because the word will
[39:05] never pass away but Heaven and Earth
[39:07] will pass away but my word will never
[39:10] pass away that's why we are being told
[39:13] go back to the absolute which is the
[39:15] word always amen it's very important
[39:19] that we have those foundation so that we
[39:21] know where we where we go amen amen and
[39:25] we need each other always always think
[39:26] about that that there's no one man
[39:29] ministry right we believe in the
[39:31] five-fold ministry and we thank the Lord
[39:32] that uh uh Barberry acknowledges that
[39:36] which is uh he's also a minister before
[39:38] but now he's the pastor but then there
[39:39] are other Ministries there are teachers
[39:42] there are Apostles prophets and there's
[39:45] a purpose we know that we heard that
[39:47] it's for the perfecting of the Saints
[39:50] edification of the body so we cannot be
[39:52] perfected by one man it should be the
[39:54] five-fold ministry amen amen so and I
[39:58] John saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[40:00] coming down from God out of Heaven
[40:03] prepared us or like a bride adorned for
[40:06] her husband so it's a it's a you can see
[40:09] the New Jerusalem is like a bride
[40:11] adorned for her husband because it's a
[40:13] righteous perfect amen and I heard a
[40:15] great voice out of Heaven saying behold
[40:18] the Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[40:20] will dwell with them and they shall be
[40:22] his people and God himself shall be with
[40:25] them and be their God so you can see
[40:27] here and God shall wipe away all tears
[40:30] from their eyes and there shall be no
[40:32] more death neither sorrow nor crying
[40:34] neither shall there be any more pain for
[40:37] the former things are passed away and he
[40:41] that sat upon the throne said behold I
[40:43] will make things new and he said unto me
[40:45] right for these words are true and
[40:47] faithful so you see it's the word of God
[40:49] it's true and faithful and they will all
[40:51] come to pass amen and he said unto me it
[40:54] is done I am Alpha and Omega the
[40:57] beginning and the end I will give unto
[40:59] him that is a thirst of the Fountain of
[41:01] Water of Life freely amen so this is a
[41:05] blessed hope amen we're looking for a
[41:07] new Heaven and new earth we're not only
[41:09] looking for millennium we're new looking
[41:11] for new Heaven and new earth but then
[41:12] the thing is the bride I will tackle the
[41:15] classes of people after you can see we
[41:17] are special people amen I don't want to
[41:20] be uh ahead of myself the sunship of
[41:22] Jesus Christ so he came in three son's
[41:26] name the first one is son of man there
[41:30] are so many scriptures which we will not
[41:32] read but it's a
[41:34] prophetic uh title son of man means it's
[41:37] a prophet and then Son of God which is
[41:40] the holy ghost or Holy Spirit and then
[41:44] son of David in the Millennium but then
[41:46] brother branam
[41:48] made and uh put it based on scriptures
[41:52] that before before the Son of God and
[41:55] Son of of David Ministry there will be a
[41:58] son of man ministry again it's a
[42:00] prophetic Ministry meaning the word the
[42:03] full word will come through a prophet
[42:06] and then the subjects like you and me
[42:09] will also preach a prophetic Ministry
[42:11] through that Prophet right amen that's
[42:14] why it's so important that you can see
[42:16] all this there is a pattern here before
[42:19] the flood there was a prophet that's
[42:21] right and what is his
[42:23] name who was the prophet
[42:27] Before the
[42:28] Flood Noah that's right so Noah preached
[42:32] how many years 120 years thank you Elias
[42:36] uh he he got it because maybe if you can
[42:38] read so you can see Before the Flood
[42:41] there's a a milestone that happened so
[42:44] there was a prophet in the land that
[42:45] preached that there will be rain that
[42:47] there will
[42:48] be uh the Earth will be
[42:51] flooded before Jesus Christ came his
[42:54] first Advent first coming
[42:56] was there a
[42:57] Prophet that prepared his
[43:00] way is the the the man crying in the
[43:04] wilderness prepared the way of the Lord
[43:06] who is that
[43:07] man John the Baptist amen so two so two
[43:12] scriptures will blend together and make
[43:14] like a witness so so meaning for the
[43:19] third uh Milestone which is the rapture
[43:22] that we're we're we're we're waiting for
[43:24] so there should be a prophet also in the
[43:26] land and we know that that is brother
[43:28] Branham who by Vindication of what he
[43:32] preached there's so many Visions many
[43:34] miracles many healing he's the son of
[43:38] man or or the prophet that uh precedes
[43:43] the second coming or or he he's the he's
[43:46] the one that uh uh how do you call it uh
[43:50] yeah precedes the second coming of of
[43:53] Jesus Christ amen so there should be a
[43:55] prophet that's why for us we believe in
[43:57] a prophetic Ministry because the word
[43:59] comes through prophets right amen so you
[44:02] see here Prophet Holy Spirit and then
[44:04] Prophet this is a son of man ministry
[44:06] again prophet and then as a king so you
[44:08] see these are the sunship of Jesus
[44:10] Christ amen so there there actually
[44:13] three but then son of man it's just
[44:15] repeated here because at first when he
[44:18] came he's a prophet and then it was
[44:20] handed over to the prophet of this age
[44:22] and then to us right now amen that's why
[44:24] we still belong it's not only for br
[44:27] Bram son of man Ministry 1773 and 107
[44:30] but also for the bride which is 10
[44:32] Revelations 108 to1 amen amen this is
[44:35] just a a quick one so that at least we
[44:37] know where we are right now so you see
[44:40] it's a it's a timeline so that we know
[44:42] the importance why we believe a prophet
[44:44] why God sent a prophet it didn't end
[44:47] that way there is a purpose and there is
[44:49] a manifestation that's why we believe it
[44:51] we're not amen gble that uh that you can
[44:54] be baptized three times like me right I
[44:57] mean I was baptized three times first as
[45:00] a Catholic and then as a as an
[45:02] Evangelical and then the third in the
[45:03] message the right baptism you cannot be
[45:06] Gible if without a basis right but then
[45:08] the thing is you have to make your
[45:10] calling an election sure we have to know
[45:12] that we know that we know that we know
[45:14] amen and how would how would we know if
[45:17] we don't attend church how would we know
[45:18] if we don't read the Bible amen it's so
[45:21] important brothers and sisters that's
[45:22] why for this it's just putting things
[45:25] together so that we can have a a life
[45:27] this is life it's a positive gospel
[45:29] brothers and sisters it's a positive
[45:32] messag amen and the message is not from
[45:34] a man amen it's from God through a man
[45:38] and then how would we know that it's
[45:40] Vindicated you have a a written word
[45:43] everyone can read the Bible y but you
[45:46] will have a spoken word yes sir right
[45:49] through a prophet because not
[45:52] every everything that uh that is written
[45:55] can be of tailed like the Seven Seals
[45:58] you cannot even explain without the
[46:01] prophet right they're silent but we need
[46:04] a prophetic utterance we we need the
[46:07] prophet to to to really tell us what
[46:10] they are yes but how would we prove that
[46:12] it's true they manifest they become
[46:15] living word amen so that's so important
[46:18] and that's how to if we heard it if we
[46:22] want to to experience God just tell him
[46:24] how he wants
[46:26] uh how uh how we want him to you know
[46:29] manifest to us or or show himself to us
[46:31] we have different examples right Thomas
[46:34] is a doubting Thomas I want to put my uh
[46:37] my fingers on on your nails scattered
[46:39] hands and and feet it happened right so
[46:44] uh you know the the the the road to Emos
[46:48] the the two
[46:49] men they were withheld I mean Their Eyes
[46:52] Were withheld until they saw the
[46:54] breaking of the bread so what what I'm
[46:55] saying here is in different types or
[46:57] different forms if you want to seek God
[47:00] he will show himself to us as long as
[47:03] we're sincere amen and and the motive
[47:05] and objective is Right amen so you see
[47:08] this is the sunship of Jesus Christ
[47:09] that's the sunship but then the thing is
[47:12] uh it it's also backed up by coat you
[47:14] can see here uh okay let's see I won't
[47:18] read all throughout but then the thing
[47:20] is here just to prove that uh it was in
[47:23] the message so and and you you can see
[47:26] here in the 177 but now he is through
[47:29] the C to through the church age now he
[47:32] has been Son of God okay in the
[47:34] Millennium will be son of David sitting
[47:36] on David's throne but between this time
[47:40] this
[47:41] time we find out by scriptures he is to
[47:44] reveal himself as son of man a prophet
[47:48] so you can see that those those small
[47:50] words but they are proven amen and then
[47:54] it's a prophetic thing
[47:56] and and you see here the word of the
[47:59] Lord comes to prophets only amen so yes
[48:03] right we might claim that we're not
[48:05] prophets but we believe of the Prophet
[48:07] so therefore we will receive the
[48:09] prophet's reward we might not be
[48:11] preachers but we can live the life of
[48:13] the message then we our our our lives
[48:17] will be more than the preacher itself
[48:20] because it's a living testimony a best
[48:22] sermon preach Our Lives amen never to
[48:25] theologian
[48:26] amen it is to prophets and the Lord said
[48:29] he did nothing in his unchanging word we
[48:31] just talked about until first he shows
[48:33] His prophets amen and the end time them
[48:36] Seven Seals that this Bible has sealed
[48:38] up the Sevenfold mysteries of all Christ
[48:41] has to be revealed first and it can only
[48:43] brought be brought to a
[48:46] prophet we've been looking for that for
[48:48] years and we believe this spirit is
[48:50] Among Us now so we find so you see how
[48:52] important brothers and
[48:54] sisters this is precious to us amen if
[48:57] it if it if it didn't change your life
[49:00] you know I don't know because the thing
[49:03] is it it testimony yeah we always say it
[49:07] starts with a test but then once you
[49:09] overcome that test it's your personal
[49:12] testimony can they it might be similar
[49:14] to some but it's personal to you so if
[49:17] they tell me oh you you belong to a cult
[49:20] I don't care because it changed my life
[49:23] amen from mvin the old Irvin who died
[49:26] then now to the new mvin that still
[49:28] living and believing the word of God
[49:30] Amen and it's a change that's the
[49:33] greatest
[49:34] Miracle to every person amen is the
[49:37] changing from sinner conversion from
[49:40] sinner to Saint am and why it's
[49:42] important that we go back to the word
[49:44] lots of books can inform
[49:47] us but the Bible can transform us that's
[49:51] why the word is so important amen amen
[49:54] because it's the life but you cannot
[49:56] just read it by just reading verse to
[49:58] verse because this it's a mystery it's a
[50:02] yeah that's why Mysteries are revealed
[50:04] by prophets amen it's not by by
[50:07] theological uh seminarian uh Seminary uh
[50:11] education amen so the end of sun sunship
[50:14] of Jesus Christ so you see sunship has
[50:16] end BR Bram mentioned that
[50:19] too because son is a begotten so it has
[50:23] a beginning so it has an ending yes sir
[50:26] imagine that that's why all let's see it
[50:28] by scripture so that at least we can
[50:30] enjoy that we're we're not basing it on
[50:33] our own understanding so you see in 1
[50:35] Corinthians 15:2
[50:37] 24-28 then cometh the end right when he
[50:42] shall have delivered up the kingdom to
[50:44] God even the father when he shall put
[50:47] down all Rule and all authority and
[50:50] power he will put down right now he in
[50:52] Authority we're always putting
[50:54] everything uh in his name we are doing
[50:57] everything in his name and we shall do
[50:59] everything in his name including
[51:01] baptism that's why it's so important
[51:03] everything but then remember that
[51:04] there's a there's a scripture that his
[51:07] word is above his name his word is
[51:10] magnified even above his name so it
[51:12] means the word is more absolute than his
[51:14] name amen so the word is the absolute
[51:17] what I'm saying here
[51:19] is he for when he shall put down all
[51:22] Rule and all all authority and Power for
[51:25] he must Reign till he had put all
[51:27] enemies under his feet The Last Enemy
[51:31] that shall be destroyed is death let's
[51:34] continue for he had put all things under
[51:36] his feet but when he said all things are
[51:39] put under him it is Manifest that is
[51:41] accepted which did put all things under
[51:44] him this is the key verse here and when
[51:48] all things shall be subdued unto him
[51:51] then shall the son also himself be sub
[51:55] subject unto him that put all things
[51:57] under him that God may be all in all so
[52:01] you see that's the reason why bar branam
[52:03] is not a
[52:04] Oneness right not like what this finger
[52:07] one it's an attribute it's it's a
[52:10] manifestation it's dispensation amen
[52:13] father son holy spirit is not three Gods
[52:16] it's just one God in three
[52:17] manifestations three dispensations so
[52:20] same for here you can see he will be
[52:22] subject to God but let's put this one
[52:25] also it's it's a good thing to back it
[52:27] up so that I'm not uh it's not coming
[52:30] from me on top of Mount Zion will set
[52:33] the lamp and the city will need no light
[52:37] for the lamb is the light therefore and
[52:39] above the lamp will be the father above
[52:42] the lamp will be the father which is the
[52:45] logos God the great light the eternal
[52:48] light that will shine just above the
[52:51] throne so you can see here let's let's
[52:54] just read it so at least and Jesus will
[52:56] not be on his father's Throne he'll be
[52:59] on his throne he will not be but he will
[53:03] be so it means he not future at that
[53:05] time he will be on his throne and the
[53:08] father will
[53:10] hover over the
[53:12] son which the father and son will be
[53:16] one and while they are yet speaking I'll
[53:19] answer before they can think I'm
[53:20] thinking for them that's right so is
[53:22] there an end for the sunship so we
[53:25] thought that sunship is eternal that's a
[53:27] doctrine of the of the other
[53:29] denominations that sunship is eternal no
[53:32] amen he started so he will end right so
[53:36] but he will end as God amen amen because
[53:39] he's God from the beginning so you can
[53:41] see the those are the scriptures
[53:45] so see we're talking about different uh
[53:48] things here but then the thing is there
[53:50] are classes of people in this world
[53:54] right they are summarized this way so
[53:57] that at least it's clear the wise
[53:59] virgins which is the
[54:01] bride second one is the foolish virgins
[54:04] the third is the 144,000 and the elect
[54:06] Jews the reprobates the borderline
[54:09] Believers the sheep and the goats which
[54:11] is the righteous and the wicked let's
[54:13] let's check one by one what they are of
[54:15] course we'll start with the bride are
[54:17] you bride this evening amen do we
[54:19] believe that we're the Bride of Jesus
[54:21] Christ amen because to qualify for a
[54:24] bride you you you must wear the word of
[54:26] righteousness completely and that will
[54:29] come through the prophet of this age
[54:30] amen amen so who are the wise virgins
[54:34] they are the lack of God they are God's
[54:37] chosen ones the predestinated seed the
[54:41] Bride of Jesus Christ as spoken of in
[54:43] Ephesians 1:44 1:4 to5 according as he
[54:48] had chosen Us in him before the
[54:50] foundation of the world that we should
[54:52] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[54:54] love
[54:55] having predestinated us unto the
[54:57] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[54:59] himself according to the good pleasure
[55:01] of his will amen how did he
[55:04] predestinated us how did he predestinate
[55:07] us because of his for knowledge right we
[55:10] we've been talking sister L on on on
[55:13] yeah sometime there and uh it was
[55:15] preached last Sunday and then you see
[55:17] how God works and then when you're
[55:19] talking about the Lord and then he will
[55:21] hear it and then it will be Vindicated
[55:23] you see he will choose you be before he
[55:27] will have a for knowledge of you so
[55:29] basically election or predestination
[55:32] comes after his forn knowledge because
[55:35] whom he did for know Romans 8 he
[55:39] predestinate whom he predestinate he
[55:42] called whom he called he justified whom
[55:46] he justified them he also glorified you
[55:49] see the sequence there right it's not
[55:51] it's not coincidence there there's a
[55:54] reason for it it amen so that's the
[55:57] bride the elect if you are a fish you're
[56:01] a fish that's right you cannot be a a
[56:04] spider but then the thing is our our our
[56:08] uh our work here on Earth is to look for
[56:11] the fish not to clean it cleaning is by
[56:14] the holy spirit amen by the washing of
[56:16] the Water by the word amen through how
[56:19] how through preaching still true man but
[56:21] we're not the one who will oh you do
[56:23] this you do that it's not by law but by
[56:26] his grace alone amen because the law
[56:30] 99% uh uh concurrent oh I mean uh if you
[56:35] follow the law 99% with 1% uh mistake
[56:38] you're still a sinner in the in the End
[56:41] Amen it's just like uh doubt and Faith
[56:44] right 90 99% Faith but 1% doubt it's
[56:47] still unbelief so it means it must be
[56:50] 100% the mark which is preached by by
[56:54] Barbarian bar Gilbert the 100% Mark
[56:57] different tests but same mark it must be
[57:00] 100% amen because we we can God will not
[57:04] give us something that we cannot uh
[57:07] overcome that's why we're called
[57:08] Overcomers right and it depends on the
[57:10] faith that we have yes sir and if our if
[57:13] our if our trials is maybe very very uh
[57:17] uh very hard to overcome maybe our faith
[57:19] is so high that uh or you know that God
[57:22] knew that we can overcome but we are all
[57:25] Overcomers of this age amen so you see
[57:27] the bride is God's
[57:29] choice they will be restored or brought
[57:32] back and they will be redeemed or bought
[57:35] back amen because they have eternal life
[57:38] in the first place isn't that beautiful
[57:40] brothers and sisters we we can put our
[57:42] belief in that I mean our faith in that
[57:44] because it's a it's it's an assurance
[57:47] amen
[57:49] so they are the redeemed they are
[57:52] converted they're translated and saved
[57:55] saved is common because it's not only
[57:58] the bride that will be in in the new
[58:00] Heaven and new earth that's why we have
[58:02] classes of people we'll we'll continue
[58:04] with that he's the word she is the word
[58:06] bride because we we put her clothing the
[58:09] word of God it's our righteousness his
[58:12] righteous righteousness become uh became
[58:15] our righteousness because we believe in
[58:17] him and he living in US amen he's a
[58:20] believer of the message of the hour this
[58:22] the bride because this message is for
[58:24] Rapture this is not only for salvation
[58:27] but it's for Rapture it's for Redemption
[58:28] it's for translation it's not only for
[58:31] salvation you will not go to through
[58:32] tribulation brothers and sisters if you
[58:34] believe this message amen she is the
[58:37] Queen of
[58:38] Heaven he's the capital c church not
[58:42] small CA Capital CA that's why it's
[58:45] highlighted
[58:47] amen he h she has the
[58:50] name her name is in the Lamb's Book of
[58:53] Life amen we know the Book of Life
[58:55] contains a a chapter of the Lamb's Book
[58:58] of Life and those names will not be
[59:00] blotted out amen amen we're Overcomers
[59:03] brothers and
[59:05] sisters we're more than conquerors amen
[59:08] we're the
[59:10] elect now being judged as she accepts
[59:13] the message of the hour so you see the
[59:16] judgment is happening right now whether
[59:19] you you're a Believer or unbeliever
[59:21] because there is a white Throne judgment
[59:23] which I have another timeline I still
[59:25] have 10 minutes bear with me I will let
[59:27] you go amen so we are being judged right
[59:32] now amen right for what we do according
[59:35] to the word yes what did we do with the
[59:37] word that we received through the
[59:39] prophet
[59:42] amen she will sit with Christ in
[59:46] judgment 1 Corinthians 6223 and
[59:49] Revelations 321 I think 1 Corinthians
[59:51] 62:3 is why why go to law or or a judge
[59:55] or or the court or whatever can't you
[59:58] judge uh simple things here as compared
[1:00:02] to you know the Heavenly things don't
[1:00:04] you know that we will judge Angels right
[1:00:07] we will judge Angels so that's why with
[1:00:09] the word of God right based on it
[1:00:12] everything is there it's just like uh
[1:00:14] when you're in a court or whatever
[1:00:17] profession you are you have certain uh
[1:00:20] rules that you need to follow if you're
[1:00:21] not following that then okay you you are
[1:00:24] violator of this or what but in this
[1:00:27] case it's according to the word right
[1:00:30] that's our Bible That's the I I
[1:00:33] remembered when when taking the
[1:00:35] exam uh
[1:00:37] here uh about ethics for for with a Pega
[1:00:42] and their basis one of their bases is
[1:00:45] the Bible moral about morality so it
[1:00:49] means they still believe before that
[1:00:52] there is God that the Bible is true
[1:00:54] because the product of a Bible will be
[1:00:57] peace will be love will be God Amen so
[1:01:00] that's why they they put that as one of
[1:01:02] their basis it's it's profound I I I I
[1:01:06] was surprised when I saw that that it's
[1:01:08] based on Bible also all the ethics
[1:01:10] because when you do something if it's
[1:01:12] not based on the word then you will
[1:01:14] think only of you know profit or
[1:01:16] whatever even though you're not uh uh
[1:01:18] you know if you're in a business or if
[1:01:20] you're working but if you're working for
[1:01:22] the Lord you want to please the Lord not
[1:01:24] the man or the boss amen it's
[1:01:26] important so because we can judge things
[1:01:30] according to the word and we are all
[1:01:32] work in progress we know that right no
[1:01:34] one is perfect amen amen and that's why
[1:01:37] we have Grace we have to extend Grace to
[1:01:39] each and everyone because we are one
[1:01:40] room Schoolhouse we know that amen so
[1:01:44] she will be raptured amen because only
[1:01:46] the bride will be
[1:01:48] raptured right because the Rapture there
[1:01:50] are six uh five uh six raptures in the
[1:01:53] Bible but then the thing is for our age
[1:01:55] for the Gentiles right the bride will be
[1:01:58] raptured and that is for this message
[1:02:00] because even the 144,000 will have their
[1:02:03] own Rapture or or or redemption or seal
[1:02:06] sealing in the Bible right but that's
[1:02:07] not for us so we will be in the
[1:02:10] Millennium amen we'll cross over we will
[1:02:14] be in new Heaven and new earth in the
[1:02:16] Kings and queen's chamber oh
[1:02:19] beautiful isn't that beautiful that's
[1:02:21] why you can see The Parables there all
[1:02:23] about Kingdom
[1:02:25] the kingdom of of the Holy Ghost the
[1:02:27] kingdom because we will sit as king and
[1:02:29] queen not only in the Millennium even
[1:02:32] Beyond Amen in the new Heaven and new
[1:02:34] earth we have enough oil which is the
[1:02:37] Holy Ghost in their lamp and vessel I
[1:02:40] put enough there because uh the other
[1:02:43] ones you will see they didn't have
[1:02:44] enough we'll go to the marriage supper
[1:02:47] which is the rapture which is the
[1:02:48] meeting in the air amen so you see these
[1:02:50] are all our attributes amen of being the
[1:02:53] bride the foolish virgins that's the
[1:02:56] second
[1:02:57] class they were virgins it means they
[1:03:00] didn't defile their you know their
[1:03:02] bodies it
[1:03:03] means they they're pure but did not go
[1:03:07] all the way in accepting the word of
[1:03:09] their day that's the message of the hour
[1:03:10] so it means they didn't accept the
[1:03:12] message of the hour that's why they're
[1:03:13] called foolish virgins amen that's why
[1:03:16] they will not go to the Rapture because
[1:03:17] if they accepted the message of the then
[1:03:19] they will go to the
[1:03:20] Rapture virgin means Purity they were
[1:03:22] all good people every every one of them
[1:03:25] virgin Sanctified vessels of God Amen
[1:03:29] they will be left behind and will go to
[1:03:32] tribulation we will plat this later on
[1:03:34] they will be saved but not in the
[1:03:37] Millennium amen will be judged as
[1:03:39] righteous by Jesus Christ with the bride
[1:03:42] during white Throne judgment we we don't
[1:03:44] need to wait for that right we want to
[1:03:47] be judged now amen and follow the word
[1:03:50] right
[1:03:51] now as for Matthew 25:3 2-33 and
[1:03:55] Revelations 20 to1 amen how their names
[1:03:58] are also in the book of life and they
[1:04:00] will come up in the second resurrection
[1:04:02] that is beyond Millennium that's the
[1:04:05] second Resurrection that's the white
[1:04:06] Throne judgment such are the foolish
[1:04:08] virgins and the righteous as are spoken
[1:04:11] of in Matthew 25 in this class also are
[1:04:14] those who do not worship the Beast or
[1:04:16] become involved in the Antichrist system
[1:04:19] but die for their faith even though they
[1:04:21] are not in the bride not having been
[1:04:23] born again but they will come up in the
[1:04:26] second resurrection and go into eternal
[1:04:28] life so you see eternal life is not only
[1:04:31] for the bride amen it's also for those
[1:04:33] who will be you know purged also like
[1:04:36] the foolish virgins they are the church
[1:04:39] small SE the denominational church amen
[1:04:43] their names are in the book of life but
[1:04:45] not in the Lamb's Book of Life otherwise
[1:04:47] they will be the
[1:04:49] bride they will miss the Millennium
[1:04:51] right oo we'll be in the new Heaven and
[1:04:54] new Earth but outside the city
[1:04:57] oh aren't you glad you in the city have
[1:05:00] oil but not
[1:05:02] enough and it ran out amen oh the
[1:05:06] 144,000 and the elect Jews their names
[1:05:09] remain in the book of life right
[1:05:11] multitud Marty juice they are also saved
[1:05:14] but they're not the bride but they will
[1:05:16] be in the Millennium right the 144,000
[1:05:19] elect juice sealed as per Revelation 7
[1:05:22] will be slain at the end of the three
[1:05:24] and a half years of tribulation that
[1:05:25] means after tribulation there is a three
[1:05:27] and a half years at that time because uh
[1:05:30] uh Moses and Elijah will preach for
[1:05:31] three and a half years yes that's the
[1:05:33] time they will also be martyred together
[1:05:35] with the uh W with the with Moses and
[1:05:38] Elijah amen we'll be in the Millennium
[1:05:41] as Servants of the bridal chamber
[1:05:43] they're
[1:05:45] Uno they're they're the promised people
[1:05:47] but then God blinded them for a reason
[1:05:50] for you and me isn't that beautiful
[1:05:53] brothers and sisters sisters oh what
[1:05:56] more can we ask the fourth one the
[1:05:59] reprobates who are these reprobates
[1:06:01] their names were not written in the Book
[1:06:03] of Life they're in the revelations 138
[1:06:06] and Revelation 178 they're like Pharaoh
[1:06:10] Romans 9:17 and22 Proverbs 16:4 the Lord
[1:06:14] had made the wicked for the day of
[1:06:16] evil job 2130 the wicked is reserved to
[1:06:20] the day of Destruction they shall be
[1:06:22] brought forth to the day of Wrath in 1
[1:06:24] Peter 2:8 and it says even to them which
[1:06:26] stumble at the word being disobedient
[1:06:29] where unto they were appointed then
[1:06:32] june4 says it too who were before of old
[1:06:35] ordained to this
[1:06:37] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[1:06:39] grace of God into lasciviousness you see
[1:06:42] we cannot make them bride we cannot make
[1:06:44] them be saved they're born that way and
[1:06:48] God because of his for knowledge knew
[1:06:49] that they they won't even everyone is
[1:06:52] given the chance but uh you know if if
[1:06:54] if you don't hid that chance or you
[1:06:56] don't follow and Obey believe first and
[1:06:59] then obey right but then the thing is
[1:07:01] because of his for knowledge and it's
[1:07:03] about the sovereignty of God anyway
[1:07:05] right we we're just so thankful that he
[1:07:08] opened our eyes and then and we
[1:07:10] understand it's not because we're
[1:07:11] intelligent or we know everything no no
[1:07:14] one knows the more we know the more we
[1:07:16] we realize we don't know amen they're
[1:07:19] condemned these reprobates are condemned
[1:07:21] and they are called unbelievers they
[1:07:23] don't believe the word at so you can see
[1:07:26] sometimes we will meet people like that
[1:07:27] but then the thing is what can we do
[1:07:29] right it's about our reaction to what
[1:07:32] they do to us amen right borderline
[1:07:37] Believers they're like Judas in Acts
[1:07:39] 11617 and 25 they're like balum they're
[1:07:43] condemned also their names were written
[1:07:46] The Book of Life and later blotted out
[1:07:49] wow I'm so glad that my name is in the
[1:07:51] Lamb's Book of Life amen they're called
[1:07:54] the make Believers right okay the sheep
[1:07:57] and the goats so you see here this is
[1:08:00] during the white Throne judgment so the
[1:08:02] Sheep perhaps like Nicodemus and galel
[1:08:05] who stood for the children in the time
[1:08:06] of trouble will enter into eternal life
[1:08:10] because of their kindness you see to the
[1:08:12] Bride As per Matthew 2533 to 40 and
[1:08:15] Matthew 10:42 they gave cup of cold
[1:08:18] water to this little ones even simple
[1:08:20] ones the ones that help you when you
[1:08:22] have a flat tire
[1:08:24] they they gave you a favor in a line
[1:08:27] whatever whatever good that they will do
[1:08:29] to the bride they're called the friend
[1:08:31] of the Bride then they will be judged
[1:08:33] according to their Works their works of
[1:08:35] what on what they did to the bride also
[1:08:38] right so that's why and then the goats
[1:08:40] the
[1:08:41] wicked they are condemned because of
[1:08:43] their what unkindness to the bride so
[1:08:46] the other the opposite imagine oh and
[1:08:49] then they're also condemned to
[1:08:51] Everlasting punishment Everlasting means
[1:08:54] uh they will be totally separated from
[1:08:56] God because once they are Juds and they
[1:08:58] are they will be sent to Hell together
[1:09:01] with the with the false prophet and uh
[1:09:04] and uh and Satan then they will be
[1:09:07] forever you know away or totally separ
[1:09:10] separated from God they will not have
[1:09:12] eternal life because in in Hell there's
[1:09:14] no eternal hell we know that because
[1:09:16] otherwise they will still alive right
[1:09:19] hell is created for for the devil amen
[1:09:23] will be Juds according to their works so
[1:09:25] you see so these are the classes of
[1:09:28] people so you see knowing the classes of
[1:09:30] people what do we need to do in our
[1:09:33] lives being the bride we know that we
[1:09:35] have the highest calling here so we have
[1:09:37] to extend the grace every time we don't
[1:09:40] need to provoke other people that are
[1:09:42] not Believers if they don't accept what
[1:09:44] we're
[1:09:45] preaching we cannot do anything because
[1:09:48] God didn't open their eyes right amen so
[1:09:51] our our our job or our the work of the
[1:09:54] ministry here is to continue the the
[1:09:56] ministry of Jesus Christ because
[1:09:59] Ministry of Jesus Christ is through the
[1:10:01] is is for the Israelites but then they
[1:10:04] were blinded and that's why Paul Paul's
[1:10:08] preaching is to the Gentiles amen and
[1:10:10] then the prophet of this age is also a
[1:10:12] gentile amen and it it was handed over
[1:10:15] to the bride right now we are the one
[1:10:18] preaching now to the Lost amen because
[1:10:20] it needs a vessel right this gospel
[1:10:23] needs to be preached to all throughout
[1:10:25] the world that's the Commandment amen so
[1:10:27] that's why we need to be the vessels and
[1:10:31] our work is to preach and teach the
[1:10:34] gospel is not to clean right let the
[1:10:37] Holy Spirit cleanse every believer and
[1:10:40] let him do the election not us oh you
[1:10:43] are bride or you are reprobate not us
[1:10:46] brothers and sisters it's the word it's
[1:10:49] God himself who will do the election
[1:10:51] amen not us so sequence of time events
[1:10:54] okay nice oh three more minutes I think
[1:10:57] I I'll
[1:10:58] finish sequence of end time events this
[1:11:02] is beautiful I put the summary only so
[1:11:04] that at least it's uh it's fast I
[1:11:07] preached this here 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:11:09] but I put a summary so that we know why
[1:11:13] I I I want to uh uh preach on it that uh
[1:11:17] why do we need to know the 70 weeks of
[1:11:19] Daniel why did BR branam is always
[1:11:21] talking about it because we know God
[1:11:23] time piece is
[1:11:25] Israel if he said if if you know if you
[1:11:28] want to know the time of or or the day
[1:11:30] of the week right or the time of the
[1:11:32] week check your calendar but if you want
[1:11:35] to know the Time of the Season or or or
[1:11:37] or this day what time the day it is
[1:11:39] check Israel and what's going on in
[1:11:42] Israel right now is has been very close
[1:11:45] now that they're they're in their
[1:11:47] Homeland right all the checklist of the
[1:11:50] end time in Matthew 24 is already there
[1:11:53] war rumors of wars Israel is in their
[1:11:56] Hometown the only thing that is left the
[1:11:59] way we see it there's pestilence there's
[1:12:00] earthquakes in diverse places the only
[1:12:03] thing that we're waiting for is the
[1:12:04] preaching total preaching of the Gospel
[1:12:06] all throughout the world because the
[1:12:08] thing is there could be some that will
[1:12:10] not hear it but then the thing is the
[1:12:12] intent is for everyone to hear and then
[1:12:14] they can be judged whether they accept
[1:12:16] or not because you cannot judge
[1:12:18] something that they they haven't done
[1:12:20] right it's unfair for everyone that will
[1:12:22] be judged if they didn't hear it right
[1:12:25] and didn't accept it or or reject it or
[1:12:28] accept it amen so that's judgment did
[1:12:30] you accept this or did you reject it
[1:12:32] amen so you can see here 70
[1:12:36] weeks right 7 weeks and 62 weeks it
[1:12:39] started in 445 BC up to 30 ad the
[1:12:42] calculation is 69th week so there's a
[1:12:45] half week during the uh uh Ministry of
[1:12:49] Jesus Christ and then he was cut off we
[1:12:53] know that scripturally and then that cut
[1:12:55] off is because God wants a bride of his
[1:13:00] own choosing from the Gentile there is a
[1:13:02] reason why he did that otherwise he will
[1:13:04] just continue but time was not
[1:13:07] calculated on the Gentiles so that's why
[1:13:10] why why he didn't come yet even though
[1:13:13] Baran was preaching in 1960s he said oh
[1:13:16] the coming of the Lord is so is here it
[1:13:18] could be tomorrow or what but he's so
[1:13:20] gracious that until the last
[1:13:22] predestinate cities in the fold then he
[1:13:25] cannot come the last Gentile and then it
[1:13:28] will be crossed over or this message of
[1:13:30] the hour which is the Full Gospel of
[1:13:32] Jesus Christ going back to the Jews
[1:13:34] again amen the other half week so you
[1:13:37] can see the timeline there 69th and this
[1:13:40] is the 70th week you can see the total
[1:13:42] is 70 weeks but they we're not counting
[1:13:44] the time now because it's still the time
[1:13:46] of the Gentiles all right so we'll not
[1:13:49] do the calculation but uh if you're
[1:13:51] interested we can calculate on uh Bible
[1:13:53] study so this is the summary of it you
[1:13:56] can see from eternity to Eternity but uh
[1:13:59] actually the 70 weeks of Daniel because
[1:14:01] Daniel is for the Jews the time of
[1:14:04] Daniel is for the Jews not for the
[1:14:06] Gentiles so that's why bar Branham
[1:14:08] preach it that uh why is it important so
[1:14:10] that you know where the time you are
[1:14:12] living and the time that oh really it's
[1:14:15] really at the end time amen so that's
[1:14:18] why it's so important if you will plot
[1:14:20] it 69 weeks here have Jesus Christ
[1:14:23] because he he got commission when at the
[1:14:25] age of 30 and he has three and a half
[1:14:27] years of uh Ministry before he was
[1:14:29] crucified that's Jesus Christ that's the
[1:14:31] first half of the 70th week and then
[1:14:34] come the the the seven Church Ages which
[1:14:38] is around 2,000 years and then before
[1:14:42] after the the Rapture will come and then
[1:14:44] there's another three and a half years
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:48] so yeah I know this is uh uh between the
[1:14:51] seals and the Seven Church ages I know
[1:14:53] bar Barberry will tackle the uh it in
[1:14:57] very detail but this one is the the
[1:15:00] sequence of events after the Rapture so
[1:15:04] this is a fresh
[1:15:07] one so the first one let's start from
[1:15:10] today because that's the thing that is
[1:15:12] imminent right now is the rapture that's
[1:15:14] the only thing we're waiting for right
[1:15:15] now brothers and sisters is the chain of
[1:15:17] our bodies amen everything is is in
[1:15:21] place it's just the Reen changing of the
[1:15:24] body which is the meeting in the air
[1:15:27] Rapture amen that's the Rapture of the
[1:15:29] Gentile bride to the marriage
[1:15:32] supper then comes the tribulation per
[1:15:35] period before the Millennium what will
[1:15:37] happen here this is the last half week
[1:15:39] we just tackle it with the 70th week of
[1:15:42] Daniel that's exactly 1,260 days in
[1:15:46] Revelations 11 it's mentioned and 1 260
[1:15:49] days in prophetic calendar 360 days per
[1:15:52] year it's exactly 3 three and A2 years
[1:15:54] so you see how perfect even the
[1:15:56] numbers where is the bride at after the
[1:15:59] Rapture he will be in the palace amen
[1:16:02] and that's why we're important it's a
[1:16:04] type when Joseph amen his family his
[1:16:07] bride is in the palace while Joseph is
[1:16:09] revealing himself to his brothers it's
[1:16:12] the same for us while Jesus Christ is
[1:16:14] revealing to his 144,000 elect Jews that
[1:16:18] he blinded purposely so that he can get
[1:16:21] a bride with we will be in the
[1:16:24] Palaces oh brothers and sisters if if
[1:16:27] you if this is founded in our hearts who
[1:16:30] can who can shake us
[1:16:32] amen the two witnesses you see these are
[1:16:36] the things that will happen here
[1:16:38] so the two witnesses or prophets of
[1:16:41] Revelations 11: 3-12 Moses and Elijah
[1:16:44] will minister to the 144,000 elect juice
[1:16:48] okay and then the foolish virgins also
[1:16:50] will be purged and killed so you see the
[1:16:53] foolish virgins the the bride is already
[1:16:55] out we are already in our glorified body
[1:16:57] we crossed the dimension but it's still
[1:17:01] a time element because Millennium is a
[1:17:03] thousand years amen but our bodies are
[1:17:06] different so NE there will be no more
[1:17:07] death for the bride amen amen after
[1:17:11] their Purge there will be Battle of our
[1:17:13] magedon it's in Revelation
[1:17:16] 16:16 Jesus returns with white horses
[1:17:19] with the glorified Saints forces of evil
[1:17:22] are overcome by Jesus as king of kings
[1:17:24] and Lord of lords Revelations 19:11 to
[1:17:27] 21 that is the third coming of Jesus
[1:17:30] Christ start off his third coming with
[1:17:32] the bride we will help basically uh the
[1:17:36] Israelite uh the the Jews basically
[1:17:38] that's so so that we can defeat the the
[1:17:41] Beast which is the Roman Catholic church
[1:17:44] amen and you see all the forces of evil
[1:17:47] will be will be uh
[1:17:49] overcome at that battle of our armagedon
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:53] men and you you can find that in the
[1:17:56] message don't worry so it's not from me
[1:17:59] the Beast and the false prophet are cast
[1:18:01] alive into the Lake of Fire so it means
[1:18:04] even before the Millennium they will be
[1:18:05] cast this false beast and false prophet
[1:18:09] but later on they will be totally cast
[1:18:12] to the you know to the to Hell after all
[1:18:16] nature is Purge which is the six Hill
[1:18:19] and Earth will be burned as an oven this
[1:18:21] is the Malachi 413 that's why I said we
[1:18:24] will point we will try to plot this
[1:18:26] Malachi 413 and second Peter where they
[1:18:29] are because this one is natural fire
[1:18:32] volcanic fire or whatever fire but it's
[1:18:34] not coming from Heaven amen
[1:18:37] so then comes the Millennium so Satan is
[1:18:41] Bound for a th years Revelations 20 1-
[1:18:45] 3A Christ and the bride ruled the
[1:18:47] nations with a rod of iron as king and
[1:18:50] queen this is our rign this is our
[1:18:52] honeymoon
[1:18:53] right Witham is saying it's the
[1:18:55] honeymoon between the bride and the
[1:18:56] groom the hens will be raised as Nations
[1:18:59] hens hens means they haven't heard the
[1:19:02] gospel right because if you will reign
[1:19:05] as a king and a queen there you should
[1:19:07] have a domain right right there should
[1:19:10] be a subject who are the subject these
[1:19:12] are the heathens but where did these
[1:19:15] heathens come
[1:19:18] from it's a question but uh we we can
[1:19:21] talk about it but I don't want to
[1:19:23] presume also but then the thing is uh
[1:19:27] it's in the word that heathens will be
[1:19:28] raised we cannot limit God how they will
[1:19:31] be raised right so but then the thing is
[1:19:33] if there are
[1:19:35] people because in in I I believe it's is
[1:19:39] in Isaiah 65 we're thinking there will
[1:19:42] be no death in the Millennium but there
[1:19:44] is death in the Millennium not for the
[1:19:46] bride but there will be Mortals this
[1:19:48] hens because it says in in in Isaiah 65
[1:19:53] right a a a a child will not get old
[1:19:56] because he will he he or she will die at
[1:19:59] 100 years same for the for for the trees
[1:20:03] so it means there's still death in the
[1:20:04] Millennium and at the same
[1:20:07] time there will be a little season when
[1:20:10] uh when Satan will be loose I I will
[1:20:12] continue with that so 144,000 Jews serve
[1:20:14] as unics to the bridal chamber this is
[1:20:16] the Millennium okay and then the post
[1:20:19] Millennium what will happen there Satan
[1:20:22] will be loose out of prison for a little
[1:20:24] season this is in this is what I'm
[1:20:27] talking about 20 and 3 B it's the second
[1:20:31] portion of this uh Revelations 20 and 3B
[1:20:34] he will be loose for a season for what
[1:20:35] to deceive the
[1:20:37] heans they will be like the sun of the
[1:20:39] sea where will this hens come from
[1:20:41] because for 10,000 years imagine how
[1:20:43] many people can be you know produced by
[1:20:46] The Mortals right during the Millennium
[1:20:49] because you cannot just raise someone as
[1:20:51] an enemy right other otherwise God will
[1:20:53] just you know make rocks and then
[1:20:56] worship him so they need to have their
[1:20:58] own free will right so this heans they
[1:21:01] didn't hear the Millennium that's why
[1:21:02] they called hens and they reproduced in
[1:21:05] the Millennium that's why there's so
[1:21:06] many but uh uh the thing there is uh I
[1:21:10] don't want to presume so much but then
[1:21:12] the thing is uh it just makes sense but
[1:21:14] it's not about sense or or reasoning but
[1:21:17] uh it's just scripturally there will be
[1:21:19] death in the Millennium amen and there
[1:21:22] will be Battle of Goen magod in
[1:21:25] Revelations 20 and9 and then holy fire
[1:21:28] comes down from heaven so this is the uh
[1:21:31] Revelations 20 and 9 and 2 Peter
[1:21:34] 31-13 if you will put the scriptures
[1:21:37] sometimes it got reversed and whatever
[1:21:40] but then the thing is if if the one that
[1:21:42] we read we look for a new Heaven and new
[1:21:44] earth after the fire after the Holy Fire
[1:21:48] It's called amen the devil is cast into
[1:21:50] the Lake of Fire and tormented forever
[1:21:53] Revelations 20 and 10 great white Throne
[1:21:56] judgment second or general Resurrection
[1:21:58] separate the sheep and the goats so this
[1:22:01] is the one where where the bride will
[1:22:03] sit with Jesus Christ as judge so that's
[1:22:06] why our families of course we will be
[1:22:08] biased right your family you so and
[1:22:11] you're the judge of course we everyone
[1:22:13] in right but then the thing is our
[1:22:15] families will be saved that's the
[1:22:17] scripture say but then we pray that
[1:22:20] there will also be bride not only be
[1:22:21] saved amen
[1:22:23] right and also our friends of course our
[1:22:25] colleagues who did good to us that's why
[1:22:28] right yeah and we will judge according
[1:22:29] to their Works what did they do to the
[1:22:32] bride death and Hell cast into Lake of
[1:22:34] Fire second death Revelations 24 those
[1:22:36] not found written The Book of Life are
[1:22:38] cast into the Lake of Fire so this is
[1:22:41] before eternity and then after that we
[1:22:44] will go to Eternity which is the Eighth

[1:27:10] J Amen brother brandom said in the
[1:27:14] things that are to
[1:27:16] be he said that uh when you see uh that
[1:27:20] the life of Jesus Christ is
[1:27:23] ending because there's something that
[1:27:25] will come after it and uh he said uh we
[1:27:30] must be thankful that there's such thing
[1:27:32] as death because it's the only means so
[1:27:35] that we can cross over so that's when we
[1:27:38] are alive but then
[1:27:41] spiritually to grow and to live is for
[1:27:45] you to die first and that's why we need
[1:27:48] death in ourselves death with our own
[1:27:51] understanding death met with our own
[1:27:53] thinking we need the mind of Christ
[1:27:55] brothers and sisters and the only way we
[1:27:57] can take all this message of the hour
[1:28:01] which is Christ in us the hope of glory
[1:28:02] is to surrender ourselves amen not only
[1:28:05] die but rot so that we can grow oh
[1:28:07] brothers and sisters we we want to thank
[1:28:09] the Lord for for his grace and mercy for
[1:28:12] his election for his predestination for
[1:28:15] for his Wonderful Grace amen I'll ask
[1:28:18] Barberry to finish I hope it's real to
[1:28:23] you because uh you can see it's like a
[1:28:26] Roman Candle once you open a topic then
[1:28:29] it's just like a Candy I cannot blame
[1:28:31] him when there's so much good things
[1:28:34] brothers and sisters and we we thank the
[1:28:37] Lord
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:41] amen you enjoy that
[1:28:49] tonight certainly wonderful to
[1:28:53] understand exactly where we
[1:28:55] are many of us know exactly where we are
[1:28:57] but sometimes it's good to just have our
[1:28:59] Pure Minds stirred up by way of
[1:29:02] remembrance some of these things I think
[1:29:05] are so good to to hear it's important
[1:29:07] for us to
[1:29:09] recognize that you know at the flood
[1:29:12] that's where all of the pure bloodline
[1:29:16] Naturally Speaking died
[1:29:18] out and when we think about the whole
[1:29:20] idea the concept this just struck me at
[1:29:22] the very beginning tonight the whole
[1:29:24] concept of serpent seed we talk about
[1:29:27] you know what every one of us Naturally
[1:29:29] Speaking our serpent seed because we're
[1:29:32] in a hybrid condition and this flesh
[1:29:34] will never be redeemed it will never be
[1:29:36] saved but it's the soul it's on the
[1:29:38] inside it's what's on the inside that
[1:29:41] counts so if we think that we're doing
[1:29:43] good works in this world and that's
[1:29:45] going to save us brothers and sisters we
[1:29:47] missed the Mark it's our soul that he's
[1:29:49] come for what a tremendous thing tonight
[1:29:52] to recognize this world's fit for
[1:29:54] judgment and uh we're just on the brink
[1:29:57] brothers and sisters brother Bram says
[1:29:58] it we'll just be doing our thing it'll
[1:30:00] just be a natural life that we live and
[1:30:02] we'll just step into that new dimension
[1:30:04] and and that's just any day now let's
[1:30:07] just bow in prayer as we close gracious
[1:30:09] Heavenly Father we're so thankful that
[1:30:11] we can look at these things that we
[1:30:14] heard about tonight father recognizing
[1:30:16] that you you you took and and you you
[1:30:19] hid them you wrapped them up in mystery
[1:30:21] for many many years and we know that
[1:30:24] there's there's men in the Bible that
[1:30:25] desire to see it and and we know that
[1:30:27] even angels desire to look upon these
[1:30:30] things prophets sages desired to look
[1:30:33] upon these things that we just speak
[1:30:35] about on a regular Wednesday night
[1:30:37] service oh father I pray that we would
[1:30:40] be able to understand the things that
[1:30:41] were spoken tonight father and if we
[1:30:44] can't I pray that as we heard we can ask
[1:30:46] you to reveal these things to us

[1:30:52] and father we just thank you that those
[1:30:54] people in this world who can hear your
[1:30:57] word that they've been called to hear
[1:30:59] your word if we have the ability to hear
[1:31:01] your word it's because you called us to
[1:31:03] hear it father you gave us ears to hear
[1:31:06] what your spirit says to this age and
[1:31:09] father we know that if we can hear it
[1:31:11] that that means we are already Justified
[1:31:13] father and father we know that there's a
[1:31:15] day coming where we will be glorified
[1:31:18] and we just long for that day but until
[1:31:20] then we'll keep laboring father we'll
[1:31:22] keep giving you the fruit of our lips
[1:31:24] we'll keep worshiping you father more
[1:31:27] and more as we see that day approaching
[1:31:29] Lord father we know that we just can't
[1:31:32] keep quiet we just can't shut up we just
[1:31:35] can't hold our peace Lord we have to cry
[1:31:37] out unto you and express the love that
[1:31:39] you have given to us father back to you

[1:31:55] of us as we go our separate ways Lord
[1:31:57] that we could all do our part to find
[1:31:59] that pre last predestinated seed father
[1:32:02] that we would encourage one another

[1:32:10] another unto love Lord father we thank
[1:32:13] you for the the the burden you placed on
[1:32:16] brother mvin and we pray that you would
[1:32:17] just restore his strength Lord that you

[1:32:21] his tasks from today father that he was
[1:32:23] distracted from as he prepared as he had
