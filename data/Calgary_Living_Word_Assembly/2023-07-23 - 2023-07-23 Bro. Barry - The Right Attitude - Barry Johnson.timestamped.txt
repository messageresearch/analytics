[1:05:04] and we'd like to remember sister Tina
[1:05:05] who is

[1:05:24] that you are Lord
[1:05:27] Heavenly Father we know that we can only
[1:05:30] call you Lord by the Holy Ghost
[1:05:34] and father many people want to call you
[1:05:36] Jesus many people want to claim the
[1:05:39] blood father but Lord not many really
[1:05:42] want to have you Lord over their lives
[1:05:44] and father this morning we just pray
[1:05:47] that we could consecrate ourselves fresh
[1:05:49] unto you once again Lord if there's
[1:05:51] anything in our lives Lord Jesus that
[1:05:54] would be displeasing unto you we just
[1:05:56] ask Lord that we could commit it unto
[1:05:58] you father that we could just ask you to
[1:06:01] forgive us just now Lord and invite you
[1:06:03] Lord Jesus to have the preeminence in
[1:06:05] our hearts Lord in our minds in our
[1:06:08] souls father Lord if we need a little
[1:06:10] filling of your Holy Spirit Lord Jesus

[1:06:14] right now and ask you Lord just give us
[1:06:16] a little top up in our our cups Lord
[1:06:19] Jesus that father this morning when we
[1:06:22] approach you we could do it with
[1:06:23] confidence Lord God that we could know
[1:06:25] that there's nothing standing in the way
[1:06:27] of our prayers father that we can have
[1:06:29] confidence in our hearts towards you
[1:06:32] Lord Jesus father this morning morning

[1:06:56] accepts their solution uh that she will

[1:07:01] that you have given her Lord that you
[1:07:03] will touch her so Lord as a body of
[1:07:05] Believers here in Calgary and from afar
[1:07:07] Lord we just want to stand together for
[1:07:10] our sister Lord Jesus that you would
[1:07:12] just manifest in the situation Lord that
[1:07:15] you would touch her that you would raise
[1:07:16] her up that you would have your will in
[1:07:19] this situation Lord that your will would
[1:07:21] be done father Lord we have many ideas
[1:07:24] and and thoughts but we know our
[1:07:25] thoughts are not your thoughts and your
[1:07:27] ways are higher than ours father so we
[1:07:30] just want to commit our sister into your
[1:07:31] hands father fully and completely and
[1:07:34] we'll be careful to give you the praise

[1:08:45] pray amen all Hallelujah
[1:08:49] thank you musicians God bless you this
[1:08:51] morning welcome to all of our visitors
[1:08:54] we uh just want to turn to the book of
[1:08:57] Isaiah this morning
[1:08:59] Isaiah chapter 7 there's still a bit
[1:09:02] more so much more but uh just a bit more
[1:09:05] today I guess we'll push a little
[1:09:07] further Isaiah chapter 7 verse 10.
[1:09:15] talking about a sign I've been preaching
[1:09:18] from a super sign
[1:09:21] for a couple weeks now and uh
[1:09:24] we'll probably push a little further
[1:09:25] with that but
[1:09:27] see what the Lord has in store
[1:09:29] let's start with verse 10 in Isaiah
[1:09:32] chapter 7 moreover the Lord spake unto
[1:09:35] ahaz saying
[1:09:37] ask the assign of the Lord thy God
[1:09:40] ask it either in the depth or in the
[1:09:44] height above
[1:09:46] but ahaz said I will not ask neither
[1:09:48] will I tempt the Lord
[1:09:50] and he said hear ye now o House of David
[1:09:53] is it a small thing for you to worry men
[1:09:56] but will ye weary My God also
[1:10:00] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:10:02] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[1:10:04] conceive and bear a son and call his
[1:10:07] name Emmanuel
[1:10:09] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[1:10:12] Heavenly Father Lord as we turn back the
[1:10:15] pages of this book we know that Lord we
[1:10:18] as humans can read it we can read the
[1:10:20] black and white print father but we know
[1:10:22] Lord Jesus it takes your spirit to
[1:10:24] reveal it to us and father we just ask
[1:10:27] and we invite you father to reveal this
[1:10:29] word to break this bread of life to us
[1:10:31] fresh once again Lord help us Lord to
[1:10:34] see what you have between the lines Lord
[1:10:36] we just ask that you would be glorified
[1:10:39] in all that's said and done now help me
[1:10:41] to get out of the way and just give you
[1:10:43] the preeminence father in Jesus Christ's
[1:10:45] name we pray amen God bless you this
[1:10:48] morning you may be seated
[1:10:51] certainly are thankful to gather
[1:10:54] together one more time this way
[1:10:56] we want to just remind everyone about
[1:10:58] the services in Edmonton next weekend
[1:11:00] it's the 30th Anniversary meetings of
[1:11:03] this weekend there will be brothers
[1:11:06] Nathan and Ray Erickson from Lima Ohio
[1:11:09] as well as brother Ron Spencer from uh I
[1:11:13] believe he's in Kentucky
[1:11:15] so it'll be a wonderful time of
[1:11:16] Fellowship
[1:11:17] and uh just worshiping the Lord
[1:11:22] wow we have brother Gilbert taking the
[1:11:25] service in uh in our stead we'll be up
[1:11:27] there as well
[1:11:29] so
[1:11:30] um yeah
[1:11:31] we had a wonderful Youth Event this
[1:11:34] weekend I understand we have uh a lot of
[1:11:36] visitors that attended the Youth Event
[1:11:37] and there's a bit of Fellowship I guess
[1:11:40] Friday night and uh they had a hike
[1:11:42] yesterday and I understand
[1:11:45] uh that this is the fifth year in a row
[1:11:47] that they've actually had a hike and
[1:11:49] I've been saying to brother Joel that we
[1:11:51] should make this something maybe
[1:11:53] official every year we can have a
[1:11:56] Calgary Living Word hike and we'll just
[1:11:59] see what the Lord will do in the future
[1:12:00] if he should tarry It's a Wonderful
[1:12:02] opportunity we have the amenity of the
[1:12:05] mountains so close to us and many times
[1:12:08] we can just take it for granted I know I
[1:12:10] do I take it for granted they're there
[1:12:12] and they've been there my whole entire
[1:12:14] life and I probably haven't climbed as
[1:12:16] many mountains as I should but uh you
[1:12:19] know we have the opportunity so it's
[1:12:21] wonderful that we have folks willing to
[1:12:24] take the opportunity to have the
[1:12:26] initiative to put things together to
[1:12:28] facilitate a time of Fellowship like
[1:12:31] that in God's Beauty
[1:12:33] so God bless you brother Joel and Sister
[1:12:34] Crystal for putting your shoulders to
[1:12:36] the wheel
[1:12:37] [Applause]
[1:12:44] and everyone that participates because
[1:12:47] it wouldn't be the same without you so
[1:12:49] God bless you all for taking taking the
[1:12:51] initiative to come and fellowship with
[1:12:53] us we trust the Lord bless you
[1:12:55] uh so many visitors I'm not going to
[1:12:57] begin trying to say your names because
[1:12:59] I'm probably going to get something
[1:13:00] wrong we'll greet you afterwards and we
[1:13:02] have a fellowship afterwards for those
[1:13:04] who don't know we have a potluck this
[1:13:05] afternoon and we're certainly uh
[1:13:07] inviting you you're welcome to come and
[1:13:09] attend and have some fellowship with us
[1:13:11] as long or as short as you would like
[1:13:13] and uh just make yourselves at home if
[1:13:16] you need instructions for the address we
[1:13:18] can certainly get that to you
[1:13:20] um
[1:13:21] after service you happy this morning
[1:13:24] I just haven't been able to get away
[1:13:26] from this sign a super sign brother
[1:13:29] Branham talked about and uh probably not
[1:13:31] going to read very much from Super sign
[1:13:33] today there's a little bit of a
[1:13:34] different direction I think that I want
[1:13:36] to go
[1:13:37] um because I I just think that I want to
[1:13:40] maybe see if we can bring it a little
[1:13:41] bit down home a little bit to right
[1:13:43] where we live and see if the Lord won't
[1:13:45] do something with that and you know one
[1:13:47] of the things that has the the greatest
[1:13:49] impact on the word of the Lord in our
[1:13:51] lives we can have all of the mechanics
[1:13:54] figured out we can have church and we
[1:13:56] can have home and we can have dress and
[1:13:58] we can have finances we can have
[1:14:00] everything in order in our lives but if
[1:14:02] we don't have the right attitude
[1:14:03] brothers and sisters
[1:14:05] the spirit of the Lord ain't going to be
[1:14:07] with us
[1:14:08] and we were talking about it in the
[1:14:10] foyer we've talked about it before but
[1:14:11] you know there's people that call Jesus
[1:14:14] Jesus
[1:14:16] and they'll call him Lord but they won't
[1:14:17] allow him to be the true Lord of their
[1:14:19] lives they won't be willing to surrender
[1:14:22] all of the leadership to him to have
[1:14:26] that wedding ceremony we know that
[1:14:27] there's a reason why the bride wears a
[1:14:30] veil
[1:14:31] so she can take that Veil off and give
[1:14:33] it to her husband and that Veil goes
[1:14:36] upon her husband's shoulder and what
[1:14:38] that means it signifies that he has now
[1:14:41] all of the authority and she's willing
[1:14:44] to submit to him and now many sisters
[1:14:46] would say my goodness you're going to
[1:14:48] get me to call my husband Lord yeah I am
[1:14:50] according to the word of God if he is
[1:14:53] your husband truly according to the word
[1:14:55] of God then he is your lord and that's
[1:14:56] how you want to serve God Is by serving
[1:14:59] your husband because that's what the
[1:15:00] prophet for our day said but that's not
[1:15:02] common practice in the world today for a
[1:15:04] woman to say I want to serve my husband
[1:15:06] like he's my Lord who am I that's not
[1:15:09] what the world says the world says Be
[1:15:11] Strong be a strong woman and have a
[1:15:13] strong opinion and have a strong mind
[1:15:15] and a strong will and do everything your
[1:15:18] way and maybe talk to your husband a
[1:15:20] little bit no I'm not saying sisters do
[1:15:21] that but that's the way of the world
[1:15:22] isn't it
[1:15:24] I believe brother Bradham even says you
[1:15:26] know the laodicean age is about women's
[1:15:29] rights
[1:15:34] and you know we as the church the
[1:15:36] feminine how do we behave according to
[1:15:38] the Lord
[1:15:39] how do we serve the Lord
[1:15:42] our attitude towards the word of God
[1:15:45] shows it all we don't have to say a word
[1:15:48] our attitude displays it all out of
[1:15:50] proving his word in 1965 he says here is
[1:15:54] a woman
[1:15:55] Touched By His Garment she was healed
[1:15:58] with a blood issue he's talking about
[1:15:59] the story in in the gospels of the woman
[1:16:02] who just touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:16:04] that's what he's talking about he saw
[1:16:06] said a soldier spit in his face and put
[1:16:08] a crown of thorns on his head he felt no
[1:16:11] virtue there
[1:16:13] he says it's your approach
[1:16:15] are you bringing it up sorry it's
[1:16:17] paragraph 27 of 1965 proving his word
[1:16:22] I'll go slow and I'll give you the the
[1:16:24] title first so you can bring it up
[1:16:27] paragraph 27.
[1:16:33] it's your approach he says
[1:16:37] how do we approach the word how did we
[1:16:39] approach the Lord this morning when we
[1:16:41] came to church
[1:16:43] he says the attitude is what it takes
[1:16:47] and that's what it is tonight dear
[1:16:49] friend it takes the attitude
[1:16:51] we are and believe that we are in the
[1:16:56] presence of Jesus Christ how many here
[1:16:57] this morning believe that you're in the
[1:16:59] presence of Jesus Christ
[1:17:02] we are and believe that we are in the
[1:17:04] presence of Jesus Christ but it's your
[1:17:06] attitude that brings the results
[1:17:10] the mechanics is here and so is the
[1:17:14] Dynamics
[1:17:15] if you can just get started I love this
[1:17:18] if you can just get started it's not up
[1:17:21] yet if you can just get started he says
[1:17:24] God will do the rest
[1:17:28] and you know where I've been going with
[1:17:31] this in my mind is to think that how
[1:17:33] many times have I tried to do the rest
[1:17:36] how many times do we try and do the rest
[1:17:38] brothers and sisters the only way it's
[1:17:41] going to happen is for God to do the
[1:17:43] rest
[1:17:44] we get the mechanics together with the
[1:17:46] Dynamics and just allow God to do it
[1:17:49] something good is going to happen
[1:17:53] but it's your approach it's your
[1:17:55] attitude
[1:17:57] it's our attitude if we come to church
[1:17:59] with a bad attitude
[1:18:01] that song leader oh that trustee that
[1:18:05] Deacon oh that that Pastor I never voted
[1:18:09] for him
[1:18:10] you know what just allow God to do the
[1:18:13] work
[1:18:14] just say maybe I never did the vote for
[1:18:16] any one of those people in the body but
[1:18:18] God it's your church after all it ain't
[1:18:21] my church and if you are God be God
[1:18:24] and if you can't change my heart then
[1:18:26] show me where to go because the prophet
[1:18:28] of God said if you can't be fed
[1:18:30] somewhere then just go where you can be
[1:18:33] but you know what the difference is
[1:18:35] brothers and sisters is when that moment
[1:18:37] happens it's what's the attitude do we
[1:18:40] leave angry or do we say hey you know
[1:18:42] what God's leading me I got this
[1:18:44] leadership from the Lord and and I just
[1:18:45] can't be fed here and I just think I'd
[1:18:47] be better to go elsewhere and you know
[1:18:49] can you pray with me a little bit can we
[1:18:50] just have this what's the attitude
[1:18:53] what's our approach
[1:18:56] makes all the difference
[1:18:58] because we can fool everyone else we can
[1:19:00] even fool ourselves but we can't fool
[1:19:02] God
[1:19:05] 28 says now this subject that I want to
[1:19:08] speak on for a few moments
[1:19:10] is proving his word
[1:19:13] now I know I've been talking about a
[1:19:15] sign but I really want to maybe
[1:19:16] underline this proving his word it takes
[1:19:18] God brothers and sisters to prove his
[1:19:20] word
[1:19:21] only God can prove his word
[1:19:24] we can try all we want to and say I'm a
[1:19:27] Christian I believe the message I was
[1:19:29] raised in the message I know all the
[1:19:31] quotes I've got all of the things worked
[1:19:33] out in my life everything is perfect we
[1:19:35] know that there was once one man that
[1:19:37] came to Jesus that way right
[1:19:39] he was young and he had the World by the
[1:19:42] tail or so he thought
[1:19:44] and Jesus loved them
[1:19:46] he was rich
[1:19:48] he was young and he was a ruler
[1:19:52] and Jesus looked at him after he ran
[1:19:54] after Jesus
[1:19:56] and he said why do you call me good
[1:19:59] because there's something wrong with you
[1:20:01] just get rid of everything you've got
[1:20:02] forget about it forget about the money
[1:20:04] give it all to the poor
[1:20:06] and take up your cross and come and
[1:20:08] follow me and we know the guy left
[1:20:09] sorrowful because he couldn't let go
[1:20:12] could he the world's possessions the
[1:20:15] treasures of this world he was too busy
[1:20:17] trying to prove God himself
[1:20:20] to say that God's blessed me he was too
[1:20:22] busy trying to prove God himself and God
[1:20:25] saw it God discerned him when he met
[1:20:27] that word that day and what happened
[1:20:30] we know he lifted up his eyes in hell
[1:20:33] and he found the tables had turned
[1:20:35] completely around
[1:20:36] but God proves his word brothers and
[1:20:38] sisters it's not up to us
[1:20:41] paragraph 28 of this message says now
[1:20:43] this subject I want to speak on for a
[1:20:45] few moments proving his word
[1:20:49] now that's a great thing
[1:20:51] I think of that proving his word now God
[1:20:55] is just as able to prove his word
[1:20:57] tonight as he ever did prove it
[1:21:00] as the Bible also said prove all things
[1:21:03] hold fast to that which is good
[1:21:07] prove all things brothers and sisters
[1:21:09] just allow the Lord to do it ask him to
[1:21:12] prove prove it Lord
[1:21:14] are you Lord Of My Life prove it
[1:21:17] and I promise if we if we go sincere
[1:21:20] that way to the Lord he'll prove it how
[1:21:22] many here doesn't want to see the
[1:21:24] Dynamics of the Lord
[1:21:27] I believe everybody here wants to see
[1:21:29] the Dynamics of the Lord in our lives I
[1:21:31] I didn't mean to say that in a trick way
[1:21:32] I would never do that I don't mean to do
[1:21:34] that what I want to do is try and
[1:21:36] encourage us to to maybe just cultivate
[1:21:38] our minds this morning to think you know
[1:21:40] what we want to see the Dynamics of the
[1:21:42] Lord we're not looking to see Mighty
[1:21:43] signs and wonders but they just follow
[1:21:45] us but you know what when we feel the
[1:21:47] presence of the Lord brothers and
[1:21:48] sisters we should be able to speak to
[1:21:49] that storm and see it move back and I'm
[1:21:52] not talking necessarily about clouds
[1:21:53] maybe there's a tornado going to take
[1:21:55] out our house but when we have problems
[1:21:57] in our car in the road if we're going to
[1:21:59] have a terrible accident we cry out Lord
[1:22:01] Jesus
[1:22:03] but if he's not Lord Jesus in the rest
[1:22:04] of our life how could he be Lord Jesus
[1:22:06] in that moment
[1:22:12] paragraph 64 er sorry is this the same
[1:22:15] message oh
[1:22:18] I apologize I've got this Pokey thing
[1:22:20] again whoo
[1:22:23] I might have to go to a handheld mic
[1:22:26] we'll see how this goes
[1:22:28] um
[1:22:30] same same message
[1:22:32] I'm not sure I think this is towards the
[1:22:34] end of it
[1:22:35] um
[1:22:36] I'm sorry I don't have the paragraph
[1:22:38] number he says now as you come with the
[1:22:40] mechanics he's talking to a woman in the
[1:22:42] prayer line it's at the end of the
[1:22:43] message
[1:22:44] now as you come with the mechanics May
[1:22:47] It Strike the Dynamics
[1:22:51] it'll go to work
[1:22:53] he says sins are confessed the sister
[1:22:55] answers
[1:22:58] you are ready he says to her
[1:23:01] sins confessed this morning
[1:23:03] to the bride the sister sins confessed
[1:23:06] we don't need a prayer line do we sins
[1:23:08] confessed this morning then you're ready
[1:23:11] not because of me because of he because
[1:23:14] he's here we've already set the time the
[1:23:16] mechanics so we just need to make sure
[1:23:18] that we allow that Dynamics to come and
[1:23:20] flow through US brothers and sisters we
[1:23:22] will not leave this building the same
[1:23:23] way we came in we're going to either
[1:23:25] leave this building better or we're
[1:23:26] going to leave this building worse than
[1:23:27] we came that's the way it is when we
[1:23:29] have a service with the Lord he says
[1:23:31] Dear God I pray that you will heal her
[1:23:33] make her well in Jesus Christ's name
[1:23:36] amen a simple prayer a simple statement
[1:23:40] and a simple sister goes on to receive
[1:23:44] her healing in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:23:47] but where I'm going with this is the
[1:23:49] attitude it's the approach how are we
[1:23:51] doing this since confessed are we coming
[1:23:53] sincerely are we coming and consecrating
[1:23:56] our lives to the Lord when we come to
[1:23:58] church are we consecrating our lives to
[1:24:00] the Lord in the morning when we get up
[1:24:01] in the morning are we consecrating our
[1:24:03] children are we consecrating our
[1:24:04] marriages are we consecrating our lives
[1:24:06] to the Lord Jesus Christ every day
[1:24:09] it's our attitude
[1:24:11] 1950 zero seven one six I'll probably
[1:24:14] just go through this quickly so you
[1:24:15] don't have to worry he says out of
[1:24:17] Believers thou this and I say this with
[1:24:19] a challenge in faith I hear this and I
[1:24:22] think my I like that I want a challenge
[1:24:24] in faith we have people that want to go
[1:24:26] and challenge to climb a mountain how
[1:24:28] about a challenge in faith this morning
[1:24:30] brothers and sisters and I say this with
[1:24:32] a challenge in faith that every promise
[1:24:35] of God will be brought to pass if you
[1:24:37] take the right mental attitude towards
[1:24:40] it he says that's right look at it
[1:24:42] believe it
[1:24:43] don't be afraid of it look at it and
[1:24:46] believe it and just take the right
[1:24:47] mental attitude towards it how do we get
[1:24:49] the right mental attitude I I asked the
[1:24:52] question myself how do we how do we get
[1:24:54] the right mental attitude I've said this
[1:24:55] quote many times but what is the right
[1:24:57] mental attitude it's just saying I
[1:24:59] believe God's word right be it unto me
[1:25:01] according to Thy word not my will but
[1:25:03] thy will be done let thy will come to
[1:25:05] pass in my life let the mechanics in my
[1:25:07] life just touch have those Dynamics just
[1:25:10] touch those mechanics and just see what
[1:25:11] happens because you know when the
[1:25:13] Dynamics in an engine in a two-stroke
[1:25:15] engine or a four-stroke engine or any
[1:25:17] kind of engine a jet engine it just
[1:25:18] takes One Touch One Touch to the
[1:25:21] mechanics and when that happens we know
[1:25:23] there's fire and we know
[1:25:25] that's what we're looking for this
[1:25:27] morning
[1:25:28] the pillar of fire and he's here
[1:25:30] brothers and sisters
[1:25:34] brother Branham says John sprole many of
[1:25:37] you has heard of John the glory Barn
[1:25:40] years ago in Lay Sao Lorraine France
[1:25:44] said him and his wife walking up one
[1:25:46] afternoon at a statue
[1:25:49] looking at a statue of Christ and he he
[1:25:52] stand out criticizing he said why I
[1:25:55] don't see no suffering don't see nothing
[1:25:57] that looked like anything that would be
[1:25:58] so great about that Monument here
[1:26:02] I wonder how many times do we encounter
[1:26:05] that in the service here
[1:26:06] maybe not here but in another church
[1:26:08] anywhere maybe you get a minister maybe
[1:26:10] it's a Wednesday night you just have an
[1:26:12] ordinary average lay Minister get up and
[1:26:15] on a Wednesday night a Wednesday service
[1:26:17] somebody that's just a brother that's
[1:26:19] got a leadership for the Lord and it's
[1:26:20] just that brother you know that brother
[1:26:23] what way are we looking at it you know
[1:26:25] where I'm going with this story I'm sure
[1:26:26] we're all familiar with it he said the
[1:26:27] guide said while you're looking at it
[1:26:29] wrong sir said you got to get down here
[1:26:33] at the altar said there's an altar built
[1:26:36] up here and said now look up he looked
[1:26:39] up and said oh my his heart like to
[1:26:41] broke brother Branham says see it's just
[1:26:44] the way you look at it if you look at
[1:26:46] the word
[1:26:48] if you look at the word was way back
[1:26:50] there and Christ lived years ago and
[1:26:52] he's not today and he's not the same
[1:26:55] yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13 8
[1:26:57] brother branham's Keystone scripture of
[1:26:59] the message of the hour he's not the
[1:27:02] same yesterday today and forever that's
[1:27:04] just the way you'll get out of it
[1:27:07] he's the great I was and the great I
[1:27:10] will be but who is he to you today who
[1:27:13] do you say that I the son of man am
[1:27:17] he's not the same yesterday today and
[1:27:19] forever and that's just what you'll get
[1:27:20] out of it but it's not to be looked
[1:27:22] looked off as history it's to be get
[1:27:25] down and look up to it and believe it
[1:27:30] the way you look at the word of God
[1:27:33] having the right attitude towards the
[1:27:36] word of God the way that we look at the
[1:27:38] word of God we've got to come to him and
[1:27:41] consecrate ourselves to him we cannot
[1:27:43] live in this world without getting
[1:27:44] filthy brothers and sisters
[1:27:46] I I know there's some people here that
[1:27:48] are probably just just about Saints but
[1:27:51] I know I'm not I I know I I don't know I
[1:27:54] I get filthy walking in this world
[1:27:55] that's not to say that I go out to the
[1:27:57] bar rooms that live in sin but you know
[1:27:59] the thoughts come to our minds and
[1:28:00] instead of taking it into captivity and
[1:28:02] and taking the double barrel shotgun of
[1:28:04] the all the New Testaments of the word
[1:28:06] and Blasting it out sometimes in my mind
[1:28:08] I'll just entertain the thought
[1:28:13] and instead of taking into the Captivity
[1:28:14] of the word
[1:28:16] I'm guilty
[1:28:18] because of the hybrid condition that I'm
[1:28:20] in but that doesn't mean I'm lost
[1:28:22] it just means I have this battle going
[1:28:24] on
[1:28:26] and you know I'll just be honest with
[1:28:27] you I've had the devil coming at me hard
[1:28:31] coming at me fierce
[1:28:33] coming after me
[1:28:35] and and even to the point in my dreams
[1:28:38] and I just have been marveling this last
[1:28:41] week saying Lord what is it and I know
[1:28:43] what it is he showed me and then he
[1:28:46] started to show me dreams of real
[1:28:47] powerful services and real victories in
[1:28:51] church and it just it's so beautiful
[1:28:54] when we can actually go through and take
[1:28:56] inventory in our lives brothers and
[1:28:57] sisters and that's what I want to try
[1:28:59] and do is and just encourage us to have
[1:29:01] the right mental attitude how we
[1:29:03] approach the word of God and you know
[1:29:05] what we how all every one of us there's
[1:29:08] a reason why we're here this morning
[1:29:09] it's because he's given us a sign isn't
[1:29:10] it
[1:29:11] he's given every one of us an individual
[1:29:13] sign and if he hasn't this morning I
[1:29:15] just want to encourage you to ask him
[1:29:17] because he will give you a side that he
[1:29:20] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:29:22] that he's the present tense I have that
[1:29:24] he's not a God that I was or I will be
[1:29:27] he is the I am
[1:29:30] he wants to be known that way
[1:29:33] he doesn't want to be off in the future
[1:29:35] and he doesn't want to be off in the
[1:29:37] past brother Bradham said it back in the
[1:29:38] 60s and the whole message of the hour
[1:29:40] that people are so busy looking
[1:29:42] backwards and looking forwards and
[1:29:44] ignoring what he's trying to do right
[1:29:46] now and and I think it's beautiful
[1:29:48] because I said it trying to do right now
[1:29:50] but he's doing right now
[1:29:52] and people will either get on board or
[1:29:54] they'll just watch the bus go by but
[1:29:56] he's going to do what he's going to do
[1:29:58] and nobody's going to stop him from
[1:29:59] doing it his will will be accomplished
[1:30:02] all the way along
[1:30:05] you know the right mental attitude will
[1:30:06] bring his word to pass but how do we
[1:30:08] have the right mental attitude the only
[1:30:10] way we're going to get it is by his Holy
[1:30:12] Spirit by the Holy Ghost himself Jesus
[1:30:14] Christ and what is the the the the I am
[1:30:18] today it's the message of the hour it's
[1:30:21] it's the revealed word it's the opening
[1:30:23] of the word it's Revelations 10 1-7 that
[1:30:27] Mighty angel that descended wasn't
[1:30:28] brother Branham
[1:30:30] that wasn't a a prophet of God that
[1:30:32] descended brothers and sisters that was
[1:30:34] God himself
[1:30:35] being a present tense showing the world
[1:30:37] that you know what this this is not just
[1:30:40] a cloud that's on on on on a picture
[1:30:43] somewhere in someone's wall it's not
[1:30:44] just a cloud that people try and
[1:30:47] superimpose the face of Jesus Christ the
[1:30:49] prophet of God said you can see his eyes
[1:30:50] his ears his nose you can see his face
[1:30:53] there and what did he tell the prophet
[1:30:55] he said take that picture that man has
[1:30:57] taken and present it a certain way man's
[1:31:00] idea is this way but turn it right turn
[1:31:03] it the right way turn it the right way
[1:31:05] and look at it and what is it doing it's
[1:31:07] the face of Jesus Christ face to face
[1:31:10] with the world
[1:31:13] we know that when we were
[1:31:16] a child we acted as a child right
[1:31:19] and that scripture wasn't just speaking
[1:31:21] about us growing up
[1:31:22] as a child although we can take it and
[1:31:25] and make it that way it's about the word
[1:31:27] and the maturing of the word Through the
[1:31:28] Ages and recognizing that there was a
[1:31:31] time where where Christians were
[1:31:33] children and they drank milk
[1:31:36] and he is al-shaddai
[1:31:38] for a purpose
[1:31:40] so that the children could be fed but
[1:31:41] there comes a time where there's Eagles
[1:31:43] that eat strong meat and the only thing
[1:31:45] they can deal with is strong meat they
[1:31:47] can have milk and it's nice to have with
[1:31:49] cookies before you go to bed but where's
[1:31:51] the beef
[1:31:53] where's the meat where's the strong meat
[1:31:56] we've got to be able to have that strong
[1:31:58] meat in our lives and that strong meat
[1:32:00] is the opening of the word where the
[1:32:02] Eagles gather together that's where the
[1:32:03] carcass is and we're feeding on the
[1:32:05] unfailing body word of Jesus Christ
[1:32:10] it's got to be the word
[1:32:12] that's the only way we're going to get
[1:32:13] the right mental attitude is to actually
[1:32:15] have his word to take that book and eat
[1:32:16] it just like John was instructed to the
[1:32:18] the verse 8 2 11 or 8-13 uh the the
[1:32:22] final part of Revelations 10 there's one
[1:32:25] to seven and that was the prophets part
[1:32:27] that was the mighty angel coming down
[1:32:28] but then there's the other part take
[1:32:30] that book John who is John being a type
[1:32:32] of the Bride go and take that book and
[1:32:34] eat it up and it's going to be sweet as
[1:32:36] honey in your mouth
[1:32:37] everybody here like honey
[1:32:40] it's very sweet it's the sweetest thing
[1:32:42] there is really on Earth naturally made
[1:32:47] it's gonna make your belly bitter this
[1:32:48] flesh can't stand it how can I ever live
[1:32:51] that message you'll never be able to
[1:32:52] live that message never that's why you
[1:32:55] need the Holy Ghost because when you
[1:32:57] want to go one way the Holy Ghost is
[1:32:59] going to say if you go down that trail
[1:33:02] it's going to look just fine you're
[1:33:04] going to be just fine it's going to look
[1:33:05] just like the right way but the next
[1:33:07] step is going to take you off a thousand
[1:33:09] foot cliff and you're not going to turn
[1:33:11] out well when you hit the bottom
[1:33:15] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives will be our
[1:33:17] guide brother Branham preaches that
[1:33:19] message of God we need to have a guide
[1:33:20] everybody needs to have a guide we've
[1:33:22] got to be willing to have leadership if
[1:33:23] we can't have leadership we can't have
[1:33:25] the Holy Ghost it's pretty much that
[1:33:27] simple people will say oh I've got the
[1:33:29] Holy Ghost yeah well you got a pastor
[1:33:33] let's start with the basics brother
[1:33:34] Bradham said how are we ever going to
[1:33:36] teach the algebra if we can't have the
[1:33:38] ABCs if you can't surrender to the
[1:33:41] headship of leadership in terms of the
[1:33:43] fivefold ministry as set out in the
[1:33:45] bible let alone what the prophet said
[1:33:47] how you ever going to have the Holy
[1:33:49] Ghost in your life
[1:33:51] you gotta follow the word of God having
[1:33:53] the right mental attitude towards the
[1:33:55] promises of God is going to bring it to
[1:33:57] pass
[1:33:58] the right mental attitude is going to
[1:33:59] cause the right physical actions
[1:34:03] it'll cause a manifestation of it the
[1:34:06] word of God is given
[1:34:07] given to live by it's not given to
[1:34:09] interpret we're not supposed to
[1:34:11] interpret the word of God God interprets
[1:34:13] his own word by bringing it to pass
[1:34:14] right that's what the prophet taught us
[1:34:17] that's what God taught us through the
[1:34:18] prophet so it's not up to us to try and
[1:34:20] interpret it and say well you know what
[1:34:21] brother Bradham said this but I can do
[1:34:23] that and and my family's done the other
[1:34:25] and look at us we're great it's fine it
[1:34:28] is fine but will it be fine when you get
[1:34:30] over there
[1:34:32] the word of God is given to us to
[1:34:34] believe
[1:34:36] that's why God sent prophets in the
[1:34:38] bible isn't it
[1:34:40] he didn't send them so that they could
[1:34:41] have their own Ministries what did the
[1:34:43] prophets in the bible do
[1:34:47] prophets in the bible
[1:34:49] they said one thing basically
[1:34:52] get back to the word
[1:34:55] somehow man we know it's the Antichrist
[1:34:58] Spirit gets in around Church
[1:35:00] it's amazing when you think about it hey
[1:35:02] how in the Garden of Eden how how simple
[1:35:05] it is as a Believer when we look at it
[1:35:07] but how how simple it is how how
[1:35:08] treacherous it is how Satan got in in
[1:35:11] the Garden of Eden and how he took
[1:35:13] advantage of everything and what did man
[1:35:14] immediately do man wanted to get
[1:35:16] coverings we're talking about this on
[1:35:18] Friday night we're driving around with
[1:35:19] the two youngest boys having an ice
[1:35:21] cream we're just talking about this this
[1:35:23] this how man just wanted to have a
[1:35:25] covering there had to be some kind of a
[1:35:27] covering
[1:35:28] there had to be and and what was it it
[1:35:32] wasn't a fig Leaf the Bible says a fig
[1:35:34] leaf and Christianity in the world will
[1:35:36] say it was a fig leaf and other people
[1:35:37] might say maybe it was a small animal
[1:35:39] they just made coverings they created
[1:35:41] clothes maybe they had a designer
[1:35:42] collection but we know it wasn't any of
[1:35:44] that according to the prophet for our
[1:35:46] day it was a religious Behavior
[1:35:48] it was a religion they hid themselves
[1:35:51] because they recognized outside of the
[1:35:54] veil of God's word they were naked
[1:35:57] they were wretched they were blind
[1:36:01] and they felt like they had need of
[1:36:02] nothing right the laodicean church
[1:36:06] but that's why God sent prophets in the
[1:36:07] bible was to say get back to the word
[1:36:09] just get back to God's word get back to
[1:36:11] the word for your day and if you do that
[1:36:13] it'll be okay
[1:36:16] this morning I want to just take a
[1:36:18] little bit of a look at Judges chapter
[1:36:20] 13 if you don't mind
[1:36:22] turning there
[1:36:27] seeing how this will relate how
[1:36:30] you know the Lord will give you a sign
[1:36:31] and he gave
[1:36:33] he gave a sign that a virgin shall
[1:36:36] conceive and we know that that happened
[1:36:39] we know that that happened over in Luke
[1:36:40] there's the story of Jesus birth and how
[1:36:44] he came into the world
[1:36:47] I just want to take a little bit of a
[1:36:48] look at someone who was given a sign
[1:36:51] in the form of Samson this morning
[1:36:53] Samson was given a sign
[1:36:56] in Judges chapter 13
[1:37:00] verse 1 says in the children of Israel
[1:37:02] did Evil again
[1:37:04] in the sight of the Lord
[1:37:06] the Lord delivered them into the hand of
[1:37:08] the Philistines 40 years
[1:37:11] there was a certain man of Zora
[1:37:14] of the family
[1:37:16] of the danites
[1:37:18] whose name
[1:37:20] was
[1:37:22] Manoa and his wife was Baron and bear
[1:37:25] not
[1:37:26] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[1:37:28] the woman
[1:37:29] and said unto her behold now Thou Art
[1:37:33] Barren and bear us not but Thou shalt
[1:37:35] conceive and bear a son
[1:37:38] she was given a sign
[1:37:41] verse 4 says now therefore beware I pray
[1:37:45] thee and drink not wine nor strong drink
[1:37:48] and eat not any unclean thing
[1:37:51] for Lo
[1:37:52] shall conceive
[1:37:55] and bear a son and no razor shall come
[1:37:57] on his head
[1:37:58] for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
[1:38:02] God from the womb
[1:38:04] and he shall begin to deliver Israel out
[1:38:07] of the hand of the Philistines
[1:38:10] I just think this is a beautiful
[1:38:12] scripture a little bit of a maybe a type
[1:38:16] on how the angel came and and gave her a
[1:38:19] sign and you know a little bit further
[1:38:20] down it says that she didn't even catch
[1:38:22] the angel's name but the angel actually
[1:38:25] told her this stuff when she went and
[1:38:27] told her husband she's pretty excited
[1:38:28] about it and went and told her husband
[1:38:30] you know what I was Baron I am bare and
[1:38:32] you know that I'm Barren and and I
[1:38:34] haven't been able to have a child but
[1:38:35] suddenly I've got this vision of an
[1:38:37] Angel and now now he's telling me that
[1:38:39] I'm going to have a child and and and to
[1:38:41] take the Nazarite vow myself and to not
[1:38:43] eat anything or drink anything to just
[1:38:46] completely consecrate myself to the Lord
[1:38:48] as a Nazarite and and that was according
[1:38:51] to Old Testament uh scripture back in uh
[1:38:54] I believe it's in Leviticus and maybe
[1:38:56] we'll get there if we have time this
[1:38:57] morning but here we have this woman
[1:38:59] saying the angel instructed me to behave
[1:39:01] that way to consecrate myself because
[1:39:04] the one that's coming in my womb is
[1:39:06] going to be a Nazarite consecrated from
[1:39:09] my womb
[1:39:10] and you know brothers and sisters I want
[1:39:12] to say it today we all know it but
[1:39:14] sometimes I think we just need a little
[1:39:16] bit of remembrance or our Pure Minds
[1:39:18] stirred up by way of remembrance that we
[1:39:20] just need a little bit of encouragement
[1:39:21] to remember that if you have the ability
[1:39:22] to hear this message of the hour then
[1:39:24] you were consecrated by God before the
[1:39:26] foundation of the world from the womb to
[1:39:29] have this consecration yourself you are
[1:39:32] a Nazarite unto the Lord yourself
[1:39:34] there's a lot of different angles and
[1:39:36] directions we could go with this but
[1:39:37] today I just want to make it about the
[1:39:39] bride and Christ and how she is a
[1:39:41] Nazarite consecrated unto him
[1:39:44] and you know what we've been given a
[1:39:46] sign in our day we have the sign but
[1:39:48] here in her day they were given a sign
[1:39:51] and given the ability to recognize that
[1:39:54] they're going to have a baby now verse 6
[1:39:56] says then the woman came and told her
[1:39:58] husband saying a man of God came unto me
[1:40:01] and his countenance was like the
[1:40:03] countenance of an angel of God very
[1:40:05] terrible but I asked him not whence he
[1:40:08] was neither told me his name
[1:40:11] but he said unto me behold Thou shalt
[1:40:13] conceive and bear a son and now drink no
[1:40:16] wine nor strong drink neither eat any
[1:40:19] unclean thing for the child shall be a
[1:40:21] Nazarite to God from the womb to the day
[1:40:24] of his death
[1:40:26] isn't that awesome to think about
[1:40:28] nothing could change that from his life
[1:40:30] and you know what's the same thing for
[1:40:32] us today brothers and sisters if you're
[1:40:34] a Nazarite today if you were yesterday
[1:40:36] you will be tomorrow and this business
[1:40:38] of thinking you're you're lost maybe
[1:40:40] somewhere along the way and then you get
[1:40:42] saved and and you get saved and you just
[1:40:44] have these thoughts that come into your
[1:40:45] mind and maybe you stumble and fall and
[1:40:47] revert back to some old ways and the
[1:40:49] Devil comes around and tries to remind
[1:40:50] you that that's happened in your life
[1:40:52] and and and maybe you've fallen down you
[1:40:55] will not be able to change that
[1:40:57] consecration that you've made in your
[1:40:58] life if you have ever been baptized in
[1:41:01] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:41:02] the remission of your sins to receive
[1:41:04] the gift of the Holy Ghost and you have
[1:41:06] received the gift of the Holy Ghost in
[1:41:07] your life you can never lose it
[1:41:10] you're sealed to the day of your
[1:41:12] Redemption
[1:41:13] it's impossible for you to lose that
[1:41:15] token in your life impossible
[1:41:20] here we have Samson in the Old Testament
[1:41:22] and I'm just I just want to maybe back
[1:41:24] up a little bit just to maybe set the
[1:41:27] the stage for where this is and and
[1:41:29] maybe the light of the scripture we took
[1:41:31] an extensive study for a while on the
[1:41:32] book of of Joshua and how the Lord had
[1:41:35] taken the children of Israel from their
[1:41:37] captivity and and and with Moses out
[1:41:40] into the Wilderness and then from the
[1:41:42] Wilderness to get up and get ready
[1:41:44] because the the Ark of the Covenant the
[1:41:46] word of God is going to take you over
[1:41:47] into the promised land now after 40
[1:41:49] years all the old murmurers the The
[1:41:52] Grouchy ones the critical spirit people
[1:41:54] they were all gone and now the young
[1:41:57] group had grown up under this message of
[1:41:59] the hour in their day and they were
[1:42:01] going to follow the word with all their
[1:42:02] heart they weren't interested in all the
[1:42:04] murmuring and nonsense that was going on
[1:42:06] in their day and so they followed over
[1:42:08] and they went over into the promised
[1:42:10] land and they went and had many many
[1:42:11] conquests they went and consecrated
[1:42:13] themselves they the Lord said to them
[1:42:15] once you get on the other side you've
[1:42:17] got to follow that seal of circumcision
[1:42:19] and you've got to make sure that you get
[1:42:20] everything right consecrate yourselves
[1:42:22] today in the sight of the Lord and show
[1:42:24] him give him something to honor
[1:42:28] and we know that they did
[1:42:29] and brothers and sisters today I just
[1:42:31] want to say give them something to honor
[1:42:33] if you have any doubts if you have any
[1:42:35] questions or wonders in your life just
[1:42:37] give them something to honor
[1:42:39] sometimes we can go stale in our lives
[1:42:41] spiritually speaking
[1:42:43] give them something to honor put an
[1:42:46] investment in that bank account I had
[1:42:48] heard it said a while ago and I thought
[1:42:50] it was so good maybe one day we'll get
[1:42:51] into it but you know sometimes in our
[1:42:53] lives brothers and sisters we can
[1:42:55] actually become spiritually bankrupt
[1:42:58] if we're not putting love in the tank we
[1:43:01] want to withdraw how many times do we
[1:43:03] want to withdraw out of that that
[1:43:05] spiritual tank but if we're not putting
[1:43:07] anything into it what do we have to give
[1:43:09] out
[1:43:10] I say Lord help me
[1:43:12] but you know the world Satan I would say
[1:43:14] he's crafty he came up with this thing
[1:43:17] and it's a relatively new in in terms of
[1:43:20] history and and that's a plastic thing
[1:43:22] called a credit card isn't it and he's
[1:43:26] been able to place it in the hands of
[1:43:27] everyone and and even children young
[1:43:30] people old people middle people every
[1:43:32] people can have a credit card everyone
[1:43:34] can have a credit card people with good
[1:43:36] credit bad credit everyone can have a
[1:43:38] credit card and you can start to spend
[1:43:39] money that's not even yours you don't
[1:43:41] even have that money and and you know
[1:43:43] sometimes I wonder if spiritually
[1:43:45] speaking we can start trying to do that
[1:43:47] as well
[1:43:49] we start to run a deficit
[1:43:52] and imagine how that must feel for God
[1:43:54] but boy if we can look at that and say
[1:43:56] Lord help me let me let me find some
[1:43:58] work let me find some way to pay that
[1:44:01] debt so that I can make sure that my
[1:44:03] account standing with you is 100 correct
[1:44:06] that I've got an A plus rating with you
[1:44:08] and you know what it's not something
[1:44:10] that we're going to do it's going to be
[1:44:11] a complete submission where we change
[1:44:13] our perspective and say I could never do
[1:44:15] it but Lord when you come around oh my
[1:44:18] you'll just take my debt and you'll
[1:44:19] throw it into the sea of your
[1:44:20] forgetfulness and what does that is
[1:44:22] total submission complete surrender
[1:44:26] saying you know I I actually repent and
[1:44:29] repentance
[1:44:31] Godly repentance work with sorrow
[1:44:33] doesn't it
[1:44:35] when someone really does repent they
[1:44:37] want to change their ways they don't
[1:44:39] want to just keep doing the same thing
[1:44:41] they change their ways
[1:44:44] when we repent we change our ways
[1:44:47] we're creatures of habit though when the
[1:44:50] devil knows it very well let's just turn
[1:44:52] over to Leviticus chapter 11. I just
[1:44:54] want to I just want to try and fit this
[1:44:57] in here I guess before we run out of
[1:45:00] time we still got lots of time praise
[1:45:01] the Lord
[1:45:04] levitic uh sorry numbers
[1:45:12] I said Leviticus
[1:45:16] I meant numbers
[1:45:20] sometimes we could just get so much on
[1:45:22] the go
[1:45:31] Numbers Chapter 6.
[1:45:37] this was an instruction that people were
[1:45:39] given in the Old Testament
[1:45:42] it's the vow of the Nazarite
[1:45:45] verse 1 says and the Lord spake unto
[1:45:46] Moses saying
[1:45:48] speak unto the children of Israel and
[1:45:50] say unto them
[1:45:52] when either a man or a woman shall
[1:45:53] separate themselves to a vow a vow of a
[1:45:57] Nazarite to separate themselves unto the
[1:45:59] Lord
[1:46:00] he shall separate himself from wine and
[1:46:03] strong drink
[1:46:04] and shall drink no vinegar of wine
[1:46:07] no vinegar of strong drink neither shall
[1:46:09] he drink any liquor of grapes
[1:46:12] nor
[1:46:13] eat moist grapes or dried
[1:46:17] all the days of his separation shall he
[1:46:19] eat nothing that is made of the vine
[1:46:22] tree
[1:46:23] from the colonels even to the husk
[1:46:27] all the days of the vow of his
[1:46:29] separation there shall no razor come
[1:46:31] upon his head until the days be
[1:46:34] fulfilled
[1:46:35] in the which he separateth himself unto
[1:46:38] the Lord
[1:46:39] he shall be holy
[1:46:41] and shall let the locks of the hair of
[1:46:44] his head grow
[1:46:46] all the days that he separateth himself
[1:46:48] unto the Lord
[1:46:50] he shall come at no dead body
[1:46:54] he shall not make himself unclean for
[1:46:57] his father or for his mother
[1:46:59] for his brother or for his sister when
[1:47:02] they die
[1:47:03] because the consecration of God is upon
[1:47:07] his head
[1:47:08] now there's a lot more to it I'm not
[1:47:10] going to go into it for the sake of time
[1:47:12] but if you would like to later on go
[1:47:14] ahead and read the rest of Numbers
[1:47:16] Chapter 6 it really talks about the vow
[1:47:19] of the Nazarite and and how important it
[1:47:22] is to recognize it's a pretty serious
[1:47:25] thing I was thinking about it this
[1:47:27] morning when I was studying it what it
[1:47:29] would be like to take that vow because I
[1:47:31] like to eat grapes
[1:47:33] and I don't mind raisins either
[1:47:36] but you know what that vow is to
[1:47:37] actually not eat either one of those and
[1:47:39] some people would say well you know that
[1:47:41] was the Old Testament law but how much
[1:47:43] of the Old Testament is actually
[1:47:45] unapplicable today we're living under
[1:47:47] grace and I understand that but just for
[1:47:49] the sake of discussion and illustration
[1:47:51] this morning I mean it's a pretty
[1:47:53] tremendous thing what I want to get to
[1:47:55] is to think about it not even eat a
[1:47:58] grape there's nothing wrong with a grape
[1:48:00] is there grapes are delicious grapes are
[1:48:02] refreshing in their and they're chewy
[1:48:04] sometimes we would freeze them and give
[1:48:06] them to the kids so they could chew on
[1:48:08] them when they were teething and and the
[1:48:10] grape juice is wonderful isn't it it's
[1:48:11] nice and raisins are pretty good too
[1:48:13] they're dried grapes but what this point
[1:48:16] is in here I believe with all my heart
[1:48:18] is that you're not even going to go
[1:48:20] anywhere near it you're going to make
[1:48:22] this vow you're going to vow this vow
[1:48:24] you're going to do everything that this
[1:48:26] word says to do and that's to actually
[1:48:28] steer completely clear from it nobody is
[1:48:30] ever going to be able to say well were
[1:48:32] you drinking grape juice or were you
[1:48:33] drinking
[1:48:35] vinegar or were you drinking wine what
[1:48:37] were you doing you're actually
[1:48:38] completely steering completely away from
[1:48:40] it and you know as Believers today in in
[1:48:42] our lives we had talked about it before
[1:48:44] is it is it wrong to drink a glass of
[1:48:46] wine
[1:48:48] oh my I'm getting into some some choppy
[1:48:51] Waters here I know it but I'm going
[1:48:52] there and I think it's important to
[1:48:55] brothers and sisters because it's quite
[1:48:56] simple the instruction that I was given
[1:48:58] the leadership that I was given you know
[1:49:00] it's okay it says it in the Bible I'll
[1:49:02] say it from the pulpit it says it
[1:49:04] Timothy uh Paul said it to Timothy or
[1:49:06] it's okay to drink a little wine for the
[1:49:08] stomach's sake isn't it once in a while
[1:49:10] I'm not encouraging us to drink wine but
[1:49:12] what I do want to say is what will the
[1:49:14] people around you say that see you
[1:49:15] drinking it
[1:49:18] the word of God says to shun all
[1:49:20] appearance of evil
[1:49:23] if we have a Nazarite vow are we willing
[1:49:25] to go that far to shun all appearance of
[1:49:29] evil
[1:49:30] nothing wrong with having a bottle of
[1:49:31] wine around the house to maybe cook with
[1:49:33] I'm not going to judge that one way or
[1:49:35] the other
[1:49:37] you want to cook with it cook with it
[1:49:39] but are you drinking it
[1:49:41] if you're cooking and having a sip I
[1:49:43] think you know what maybe it's I don't
[1:49:46] know you're a revelation
[1:49:48] but are we willing to go so far to say
[1:49:51] that I'm not going to let anybody make a
[1:49:54] mark against me nobody is ever going to
[1:49:56] say that I was drinking wine and you
[1:49:58] know what it might not be anybody in the
[1:49:59] congregation might not be the neighbors
[1:50:00] nobody else around you will see it but I
[1:50:02] promise you your children are watching
[1:50:07] the children will say you know what I
[1:50:09] know Grandma she used to have a bottle
[1:50:10] of brandy a little Mickey a brandy in
[1:50:13] the cupboard in her house and she
[1:50:14] probably didn't even know that I knew
[1:50:15] about it or maybe she did and it was
[1:50:17] just maybe a joke it was for medicine
[1:50:19] when you got sick you had it with a
[1:50:20] little bit of something else and you
[1:50:22] know maybe it made you a little better
[1:50:23] and sure enough that's fine
[1:50:26] but what what message does it send
[1:50:28] brothers and sisters
[1:50:32] we can have one you can have wine I'm
[1:50:33] not gonna say you shouldn't
[1:50:35] there's some people that would say yeah
[1:50:36] we can take Liberties and have wine but
[1:50:38] you know what when you start opening
[1:50:40] doors like that what else can you do
[1:50:43] how far do we go
[1:50:45] I'm not going
[1:50:46] any further but it's endless we could go
[1:50:49] on and on and on it's not about do's and
[1:50:51] don'ts as soon as it gets into do's and
[1:50:53] don'ts the Holy Spirit has left
[1:50:56] then we can say Ichabod over top of our
[1:50:58] house the spirit of the Lord has left us
[1:51:01] if we have to rely on do's and don'ts
[1:51:03] what we need to rely on is the baptism
[1:51:05] of the Holy Ghost to lead us and guide
[1:51:07] us into all truth
[1:51:09] because if we believe that he will he
[1:51:12] will if we give him the opportunity he
[1:51:14] will
[1:51:19] we need to make sure that we're setting
[1:51:20] the right the right example our children
[1:51:22] are watching and for our children to say
[1:51:24] well Mommy and Daddy they had wine they
[1:51:26] had they had maybe had alcohol once in a
[1:51:28] while it was it was it was something
[1:51:30] special maybe it was just a Christmas on
[1:51:32] Christmas Eve in the darkest you know
[1:51:34] latest hours they had a giggle and maybe
[1:51:36] a little glass of Sherry or wine or
[1:51:39] whatever it is
[1:51:40] careful
[1:51:41] careful
[1:51:43] because the children will take it and
[1:51:45] they'll go over to a friend's house and
[1:51:46] their friends will be doing it it might
[1:51:47] not be Christmas Eve maybe it'll be
[1:51:49] Monday morning and the parents will be
[1:51:51] drinking it and they'll say you want
[1:51:53] some and the kit if they see mommy and
[1:51:55] daddy doing it they'll say well maybe
[1:51:57] why not I know Mommy and Daddy did it
[1:52:00] and they're okay
[1:52:01] it's it's a slippery slope
[1:52:04] it's a very slippery slope
[1:52:07] I just want to go back to the Samson
[1:52:09] again
[1:52:10] and you know
[1:52:12] we've been given a sign in our day and
[1:52:15] and I just want to keep bringing that up
[1:52:17] because Samson he was given a sign but
[1:52:20] he was also a sign
[1:52:22] the children of Israel had gone over
[1:52:25] into the promised land they had gone and
[1:52:27] had many conquests and they had the the
[1:52:30] prophet Moses take them out in a cross
[1:52:32] and and they saw the Lord and and they
[1:52:35] saw like we said the the elders passed
[1:52:37] away in the wilderness and the Young
[1:52:38] Generation came up and went across and
[1:52:40] and they conquered and they had
[1:52:42] conquests and they followed the Lord the
[1:52:44] will of the Lord over and over again
[1:52:46] they won the Victory and the Lord won
[1:52:48] the victory for them but what happened
[1:52:50] was then Joshua passed away
[1:52:53] right at the beginning of the Book of
[1:52:54] Judges
[1:52:55] now after the death of Joshua
[1:53:00] the children of Israel did evil in the
[1:53:02] sight of the Lord
[1:53:04] and they did whatever felt good
[1:53:06] in their own sight
[1:53:08] because there was nobody there to judge
[1:53:10] them there was no prophet in the land
[1:53:12] they had the word the Old Testament word
[1:53:14] the book of Moses but they did whatever
[1:53:16] felt good in their own sight and you
[1:53:18] know what if we're not careful we can
[1:53:20] start to do that
[1:53:21] and we don't want to do that we want to
[1:53:23] bring ourselves into subjection with the
[1:53:25] word of God
[1:53:27] like we said at the beginning you know
[1:53:28] what we all have the Holy Ghost but
[1:53:30] sometimes we get a little bit low
[1:53:32] sometimes we can actually withdraw a
[1:53:34] little bit more than we've actually
[1:53:36] allowed to go in the tank and that's why
[1:53:37] we gather on Sundays and Wednesdays
[1:53:39] that's why we have church that's why we
[1:53:41] feed on the word of God so we can lift
[1:53:43] up our cup and say Lord fill me up
[1:53:45] because we know that there was ten
[1:53:47] virgins five were wise five were unwise
[1:53:49] the only difference between them was the
[1:53:51] unwise didn't have enough oil
[1:53:54] they even had oil they just didn't have
[1:53:56] enough
[1:53:59] you know and judges 14 the next chapter
[1:54:02] over
[1:54:04] I just think it's amazing how someone
[1:54:07] can be a Nazarite from the womb
[1:54:10] which we all can be but you know
[1:54:13] we will become what we look at
[1:54:17] when we're when we're living Our Lives
[1:54:19] we got to make sure we've got our focus
[1:54:21] in the right direction on the right
[1:54:23] thing because if we don't have it on the
[1:54:25] right thing brothers and sisters we're
[1:54:26] going to have a wreck
[1:54:27] and you know Samson in the very
[1:54:30] beginning of his Conquest hey here we
[1:54:34] have Judges chapter 14. and maybe if you
[1:54:37] could turn there I'll just pause for a
[1:54:39] second if you're not there already
[1:54:42] but Judges chapter 14 the very first
[1:54:45] scripture
[1:54:46] it shows what happened to Samson
[1:54:52] as many times I've wondered at myself
[1:54:54] what happened to him he was a Nazarite
[1:54:56] from the womb
[1:54:57] Judges chapter 14 verse 1 says in Samson
[1:55:00] went down to Timnath
[1:55:04] and saw a woman in Timnath of the
[1:55:07] daughters of the Philistines
[1:55:09] this was a a Nazarite from the womb he
[1:55:12] was supposed to take a bride from his
[1:55:14] own people
[1:55:16] he wasn't supposed to go and mess around
[1:55:17] with the Philistines
[1:55:20] but here he was down there and what did
[1:55:22] he see he saw a woman of the Philistines
[1:55:24] and you know if we're not careful
[1:55:25] Brothers we'll see a woman of the
[1:55:27] Philistines
[1:55:29] and as the Bride of Jesus Christ if
[1:55:31] we're not focused on the word of God we
[1:55:34] could potentially see a woman of the
[1:55:36] Philistines something shiny something
[1:55:39] attractive something that's going to
[1:55:41] take our attraction off of the word of
[1:55:43] God
[1:55:46] verse 2 says and he came up and told his
[1:55:48] father and his mother
[1:55:50] at least he was honest right and said
[1:55:52] I've seen a woman in timna of the
[1:55:55] daughters of the Philistines now
[1:55:56] therefore get her for me to wife
[1:56:00] his father and mother tried to
[1:56:02] straighten them out his father and his
[1:56:04] mother said unto him is there never a
[1:56:06] woman among the daughters of thy
[1:56:08] Brethren are among all thy people that
[1:56:10] thou goest to take a wife of the
[1:56:12] uncircumcised Philistines
[1:56:14] and Samson said unto his father get her
[1:56:17] for me for she pleases me well
[1:56:21] can you imagine
[1:56:24] verse 4 here but his father and his
[1:56:25] mother knew not that it was of the Lord
[1:56:29] and that he sought occasion against the
[1:56:31] Philistines for at that time the
[1:56:33] Philistines had dominion over them
[1:56:37] I'm not going to read on I would say for
[1:56:39] the sake of time uh you can read on
[1:56:43] maybe you could jump down to verse six
[1:56:45] and the spirit of the Lord came mightily
[1:56:47] upon him
[1:56:48] and he rent as he would have rent a kid
[1:56:52] this was the story of the Lion's story
[1:56:53] and and he had nothing in his hand but
[1:56:56] he told his father neither sorry I'm
[1:56:58] jumping ahead of myself
[1:57:00] I'm probably sounding really mixed up
[1:57:02] it's because I am
[1:57:03] let's go back to verse 5.
[1:57:06] then when Samson down and his father and
[1:57:09] his mother
[1:57:10] to Timnath and came to The Vineyards of
[1:57:14] Timnath and behold a young lion roared
[1:57:17] against him
[1:57:18] and the spirit of the Lord came mightily
[1:57:21] upon him and he rent him as he would
[1:57:22] have rent a kid and he had nothing in
[1:57:25] his hand
[1:57:26] but he told not his father or his mother
[1:57:28] what he had done
[1:57:31] and he went down and talked with the
[1:57:33] woman
[1:57:34] and she pleased Samson well
[1:57:38] and after a Time
[1:57:40] he returned to take her
[1:57:42] and he turned aside to see the carcass
[1:57:45] of the lion and behold there was a swarm
[1:57:48] of bees and honey in the carcass of the
[1:57:50] Lion
[1:57:53] and he took thereof in his hands and
[1:57:55] went on eating
[1:57:57] and came to his father and mother
[1:57:59] and he gave them and they did eat
[1:58:02] but he told them not he told not them
[1:58:05] that he had taken the honey out of the
[1:58:08] carcass of the Lion
[1:58:10] now why didn't he tell his parents that
[1:58:13] because they're not supposed to touch
[1:58:15] anything unclean
[1:58:17] they're not supposed to touch the
[1:58:19] carcass of a dead animal
[1:58:21] especially something with pause
[1:58:25] now I wanted to talk about Leviticus
[1:58:27] chapter 11 I'll just read it for time's
[1:58:28] sake
[1:58:29] verse 27 of Leviticus 11 it says and
[1:58:32] whatsoever goeth upon his paws among all
[1:58:35] manner of beasts that go on all four
[1:58:37] those are unclean to you unto you who so
[1:58:41] toucheth their carcass shall be unclean
[1:58:45] until the even and he that beareth the
[1:58:47] carcass of them shall wash his clothes
[1:58:49] and be unclean until the even they are
[1:58:52] unclean unto you
[1:58:55] directly out of the word of God and here
[1:58:57] we have him slay a lion
[1:59:00] and and now the bees swarm inside of him
[1:59:03] it makes me wonder how that happened
[1:59:05] because first he'd have to be emptied
[1:59:07] out inside
[1:59:09] maybe a little too graphic but
[1:59:11] suddenly there's a swarm of bees in this
[1:59:13] lion
[1:59:14] and how did that happen he was busy
[1:59:17] chasing that woman in the Philistines
[1:59:19] but we know that it was the Lord's
[1:59:21] choice
[1:59:23] as the Nazarite and and I even wonder
[1:59:26] where is this going brother Barry I was
[1:59:29] studying this and thinking my I just
[1:59:30] sometimes you have to wonder but I can
[1:59:33] see how it's coming together it's just
[1:59:34] wonderful to think how the Lord does
[1:59:36] things how he moves
[1:59:38] the power of the devil in 1955 brother
[1:59:42] Branham a message that he preached the
[1:59:44] power of the devil he says how happy I
[1:59:46] am you know if you when you're really
[1:59:49] badly tempted on something
[1:59:52] if you'll just make Jesus your Refuge
[1:59:55] and shut your eyes and pass right by it
[2:00:01] it'll be the sweetest experience that
[2:00:03] you've ever went through
[2:00:06] I'll tell you brothers and sisters by
[2:00:07] experience my silly little story of the
[2:00:09] rattlesnake
[2:00:11] I I've thought about it many times my
[2:00:13] whole family walked past that thing
[2:00:15] and we couldn't see it
[2:00:17] it wasn't visible
[2:00:19] but I can close my eyes and walk past it
[2:00:21] in my mind and it's pretty sweet to
[2:00:24] think the angel of the Lord didn't let
[2:00:26] that thing strike any of my children or
[2:00:28] my wife
[2:00:30] you know
[2:00:31] that's just a natural but how many times
[2:00:34] in our lives spiritually speaking how
[2:00:37] many times in our lives do we have
[2:00:39] temptations does the devil come around
[2:00:41] and try and get us you know he knows
[2:00:45] exactly what our behaviors are
[2:00:48] but if we can just make Jesus our refuge
[2:00:50] and shut our eyes to whatever the
[2:00:52] Temptation is close your eyes to it
[2:00:54] change your perception allow him to
[2:00:59] actually be our refuge and and just pass
[2:01:02] right by it he says it'll be the
[2:01:04] sweetest experience that you've ever
[2:01:05] went through he says Samson one time
[2:01:07] when a lion run out to kill him he
[2:01:10] killed that lion and when the Holy Ghost
[2:01:12] came upon him I love the way he says
[2:01:14] that because he is Jesus Christ the same
[2:01:16] yesterday today forever
[2:01:17] when the Holy Ghost came upon him while
[2:01:20] he killed slew the lion as he would a
[2:01:22] little kid or animal so when one day
[2:01:25] passing by a lion's carcass laying there
[2:01:28] the old frame and some bees had built
[2:01:31] Honeycombs in there and he ate it and he
[2:01:33] said it was the sweetest honey he'd ever
[2:01:35] eat the very thing that was going to
[2:01:38] kill him and when he passed by and seen
[2:01:40] the old carcass he enjoyed the honey off
[2:01:43] him
[2:01:44] so is it now amen but I can see that old
[2:01:48] life that I once loved how many people
[2:01:51] can look back and see that old life that
[2:01:53] they once loved and now it's dead as all
[2:01:57] midnight I tell you I can raise my hands
[2:02:00] and praise the Lord and eat the sweetest
[2:02:02] honey I've ever eaten my life
[2:02:04] it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[2:02:08] you know if you've ever had to slay a
[2:02:10] line in your life
[2:02:12] you've ever had to do it you know it
[2:02:14] you can look back to it and it is the
[2:02:17] sweetest thing
[2:02:18] it is the sweetest thing in your life it
[2:02:21] makes it so easy to worship I keep
[2:02:23] talking about worship but when it
[2:02:25] happens to you when he speaks to you
[2:02:27] directly there's nobody that's ever
[2:02:29] going to stop you from worshiping
[2:02:30] because you nobody ever talked you into
[2:02:33] it right
[2:02:34] acts of the Holy Spirit 1954 brother
[2:02:37] Adam says in paragraph 40 and we're
[2:02:39] saved not by works
[2:02:43] what we do
[2:02:44] it ain't what I've done that saved me
[2:02:47] it's what Christ done that saved me see
[2:02:49] not what I have no Holiness if I tried
[2:02:53] to say well I quit drinking I quit
[2:02:55] smoking I quit stealing lying so forth
[2:02:59] that's what I done see that would be my
[2:03:02] own I'd have something to brag about but
[2:03:04] I didn't didn't quit nothing
[2:03:08] he just come and took it out of me
[2:03:12] and you know what I can testify to every
[2:03:14] one of those he just came and took it
[2:03:16] out of me just just about this time of
[2:03:19] year probably close to 20 years ago he
[2:03:21] just came and just took it right out of
[2:03:23] me
[2:03:24] I didn't quit nothing he just took it
[2:03:26] right out of me and see that's that's it
[2:03:29] then it ain't what I'd done it's what he
[2:03:32] done
[2:03:33] he'll give you a sign brothers and
[2:03:35] sisters you'll show himself to you
[2:03:38] paragraph 43 and then the Holy Spirit
[2:03:41] then abides in and grows daily just
[2:03:44] grows making itself greater and greater
[2:03:47] pushes out the things the cares the
[2:03:50] temptation
[2:03:51] remember we've said it many times if we
[2:03:53] try to do stuff if we try to get rid of
[2:03:56] it if we try to rebuke that rattlesnake
[2:03:58] on the pathway he's just gonna sit there
[2:04:00] and look at you
[2:04:01] he's not going to hear your words he
[2:04:04] doesn't care he just wants to strike you
[2:04:06] the moment he gets a chance he will I
[2:04:08] rebuke you I rebuke you just turn around
[2:04:10] and walk away from it
[2:04:15] makes itself greater and greater pushes
[2:04:17] out the things the cares the temptation
[2:04:18] as you overcome them the Holy Spirit
[2:04:21] takes its place
[2:04:24] how can we ever expect to overcome
[2:04:25] without getting the baptism of the Holy
[2:04:27] Ghost brothers and sisters
[2:04:29] if anybody's ever afraid of it don't be
[2:04:30] afraid of it be afraid of not getting it
[2:04:35] as you overcome them the Holy Spirit
[2:04:37] takes his place do you know what if
[2:04:39] you've got a real bad temptation of
[2:04:41] something that's not right overcome that
[2:04:43] thing a few times and watch if your
[2:04:46] testimony doesn't Bloom on account of it
[2:04:49] says look at Samson when he found that
[2:04:52] that lion run out to kill him when he
[2:04:54] slew the lion when the power of God come
[2:04:56] upon Him slew him with his bare hand
[2:05:00] just probably pulled his Jaws apart
[2:05:03] little bitty curly-headed shrimp about
[2:05:06] that high little bitty old fellow
[2:05:08] scrawny
[2:05:10] scrawny look on the street seven little
[2:05:12] locks hanging around his head like a
[2:05:15] little
[2:05:17] and he was no more than a little
[2:05:19] until the spirit of God come upon him
[2:05:22] [Applause]
[2:05:23] now it wouldn't be hard to believe that
[2:05:25] a great big giant could slay a line with
[2:05:27] his hands
[2:05:29] I believe he could do it but what's the
[2:05:31] funny thing was the little bitty fellow
[2:05:34] done it
[2:05:35] and I want to tell you even the little
[2:05:37] bitty fellows sitting in the front rows
[2:05:39] here the little bitty fellows may be
[2:05:42] spiritually feeling here you know what
[2:05:44] he's not going to use a spiritual giant
[2:05:46] he doesn't ever use spiritual Giants he
[2:05:49] uses David's David's those ones that are
[2:05:52] quick to repent
[2:05:53] but sometimes in their lives they've got
[2:05:56] some some things that he's got to work
[2:05:58] out of them and they seem like great
[2:05:59] trials
[2:06:02] David was a murderer
[2:06:04] David had adultery in him and God had to
[2:06:07] get those things out
[2:06:10] but it's still his name David
[2:06:13] he still was the one who had have the
[2:06:15] throne for eternity
[2:06:19] the throne that God chose for himself
[2:06:25] the spirit of the Lord come upon him and
[2:06:29] he slew the line threw it over to one
[2:06:31] side bees built their hive in there and
[2:06:33] Samson the sweetest honey he could ever
[2:06:35] come out of that carcass of that that
[2:06:37] killed lion is that right why he
[2:06:39] overcome it with the power of God and I
[2:06:41] want to say this brothers and sisters it
[2:06:43] just just throw it in there and I'm just
[2:06:45] going to continue to do it you know many
[2:06:47] times we can look at this and say in our
[2:06:50] lives we can look at our lives and say I
[2:06:52] follow the word of God I'm doing
[2:06:53] everything that I can I'm trying hard to
[2:06:55] make this right I want it to be right
[2:06:56] and it can look completely wrong how did
[2:06:59] it look for Samson in his day all those
[2:07:01] people who were critics all those people
[2:07:03] who knew Joshua all those people who had
[2:07:06] heard about Moses maybe even knew Moses
[2:07:09] all those people who who were there and
[2:07:11] and really religious people in the day
[2:07:14] to see him go down and say to his
[2:07:16] parents beg them for a Philistine wife
[2:07:18] are you kidding but we know the word of
[2:07:20] God says that that was the direction of
[2:07:22] the Lord that wasn't just his Direction
[2:07:24] he was created as the Nazarite in the
[2:07:27] womb of his mother
[2:07:29] to go and do that
[2:07:31] because God wanted to thump the
[2:07:32] Philistines
[2:07:34] God was getting fed up with the
[2:07:35] Philistines having having the the upper
[2:07:38] hand on the children of Israel so he
[2:07:40] raised someone up to deal with those
[2:07:42] animals
[2:07:44] and if you've got something you want to
[2:07:46] eat you want to eat some sweet honey
[2:07:48] from just overcome it with the power of
[2:07:51] God that's right watch how good it is oh
[2:07:53] my pass buy it maybe you've been a
[2:07:56] drunkard and yet every time you smell
[2:07:58] whiskey or beer or something you want to
[2:08:01] drink it overcome it by the power of God
[2:08:03] pass by one time and see what a feeling
[2:08:06] you got in your heart when all the thing
[2:08:08] is dead and gone all finished oh my
[2:08:12] sweet honey you get out of it
[2:08:15] true brothers and sisters and we all
[2:08:18] know it we've all overcome but how do we
[2:08:20] overcome
[2:08:22] by the blood of the lamb and by our
[2:08:24] testimony
[2:08:26] and you know I I was in discussion with
[2:08:28] a a Elder Minister and he said it you
[2:08:30] know what sometimes you'll be in a group
[2:08:32] of people and and something will come up
[2:08:34] something will pop up and as a Believer
[2:08:36] we recognize those things to be Spirits
[2:08:39] when they pop up and suddenly we'll
[2:08:41] start to have maybe a little feeling or
[2:08:43] a thought or something will start coming
[2:08:45] around us and we'll be like where did
[2:08:46] that come from how come am I feeling
[2:08:47] this what is it it's an attack of the
[2:08:49] devil it's a spirit that's trying to get
[2:08:51] on you trying to get into your mind
[2:08:53] trying to get you to take that thought
[2:08:55] and not take it into captivity of the
[2:08:57] word
[2:08:58] but you have the ability to eliminate it
[2:09:02] because you already have the blood of
[2:09:03] the Lamb you've already applied that
[2:09:05] blood to Your Heart Right There to my
[2:09:07] heart was the blood applied
[2:09:10] give glory to his name say hey you know
[2:09:13] what I overcame drinking one time even
[2:09:16] though you want to try and get on me and
[2:09:18] tell me that I want to have a beer I
[2:09:20] want to go and hang out with the boys no
[2:09:22] I don't I want to go to church I want to
[2:09:24] call my brothers and sisters and
[2:09:26] fellowship around the things of the Lord
[2:09:28] I want to go to prayer meeting on
[2:09:29] Thursday night I want to have an extra
[2:09:31] church service because I know it's
[2:09:33] changing me from glory to glory
[2:09:36] just living in this world is going to
[2:09:38] give me Temptation upon Temptation upon
[2:09:40] temptation but when I get together Lord
[2:09:42] with my brothers and sisters I know
[2:09:45] there's power
[2:09:48] overcoming power
[2:09:50] but when that Spirit starts to rise up
[2:09:52] and try and your Serpent's authority to
[2:09:55] you brothers and sisters you can say no
[2:09:57] God delivered me from that I used to be
[2:09:59] a drunk but by the blood of the lamb and
[2:10:01] by my testimony of what he's done for me
[2:10:04] I no longer desire to drink alcohol
[2:10:08] because he delivered me from it
[2:10:10] and I know how hard it is to contend
[2:10:12] with that when that Spirit gets on you
[2:10:14] brothers and sisters that's why millions
[2:10:16] and probably even billions of people
[2:10:17] live according to a 12-step program for
[2:10:20] the rest of their lives every day
[2:10:22] they'll get up and look in the mirror
[2:10:23] and say I'm so and so and I'm an
[2:10:26] alcoholic
[2:10:28] we have the ability to get up and say
[2:10:30] I'm so and so I'm a son of the king
[2:10:33] I belong in Heavenly places in fact I'm
[2:10:36] already seated there
[2:10:38] I don't have to tolerate that junk
[2:10:43] but you know what sometimes it's going
[2:10:44] to look pretty nasty on the outside
[2:10:47] so if we see a brother or sister going
[2:10:49] through a bit of a rough patch in their
[2:10:50] life take a look at Samson here and
[2:10:53] recognize that sometimes the Lord he
[2:10:56] ordains things to happen a certain way
[2:10:58] maybe Satan is going to get a thumping
[2:11:01] by that child that's living a little bit
[2:11:03] Wayward maybe there's some drinking
[2:11:05] Devils maybe there's some partying
[2:11:07] Devils maybe there's some whatever kinds
[2:11:09] of devils God wants to thump them and
[2:11:11] he's going to use your child maybe your
[2:11:13] husband maybe your wife to do it through
[2:11:17] we don't know just keep praying just
[2:11:20] keep playing a token you have the
[2:11:22] ability to do that we know we read this
[2:11:24] just recently First Corinthians chapter
[2:11:26] 10 verse 12 wherefore led him that
[2:11:28] thinketh he standeth take heed lest
[2:11:31] Heath both don't let Pride think don't
[2:11:33] let us think that we're standing on our
[2:11:35] own brothers and sisters because it
[2:11:36] ain't us standing we got nothing on our
[2:11:39] own verse 13 says there hath no
[2:11:42] temptation taken you but such as is
[2:11:44] common to man
[2:11:46] all men go through it all women go
[2:11:49] through it human beings will go through
[2:11:50] it in this hybrid condition but isn't it
[2:11:53] wonderful brothers and sisters there's
[2:11:54] come in a thousand year reign where we
[2:11:56] will stand before the devil and he will
[2:11:59] be powerless before us he's going to
[2:12:00] have all the power he has today but he's
[2:12:03] going to be bound with chains of
[2:12:04] circumstance and no circumstances is
[2:12:06] going to be your testimony the life that
[2:12:08] you live and the body that you've been
[2:12:10] given
[2:12:12] the scripture says but God is faithful
[2:12:14] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[2:12:16] above that ye are able isn't he a
[2:12:18] wonderful God God who is rich in Mercy
[2:12:21] but will with the Temptation also make a
[2:12:24] way to escape
[2:12:27] that ye may be able to bear it
[2:12:29] he's not going to take us around it he's
[2:12:32] not going to take us under it or or or
[2:12:33] over it he's going to take us right
[2:12:35] through the middle of it brothers and
[2:12:37] sisters and you know what we're going to
[2:12:38] slay Devils all the way through it
[2:12:40] they're gonna fall all over the place
[2:12:42] you know I just like to take a look at
[2:12:45] this stuff the way the Lord leads me and
[2:12:47] and I just have to sometimes express the
[2:12:49] things that I've been going through and
[2:12:51] one of them is the the the the vehicles
[2:12:53] having a vehicle with a with an
[2:12:55] electrical problem anybody ever have a
[2:12:57] vehicle with an electrical problem
[2:12:59] they're so painful
[2:13:01] they're so taxing because they're so
[2:13:03] elusive
[2:13:05] right sometimes it's really obvious and
[2:13:07] you can just do one little thing maybe
[2:13:09] change the battery and it's fixed
[2:13:10] sometimes you got to change the battery
[2:13:12] and then the alternator and then it's
[2:13:13] fixed but when you do both of those
[2:13:15] things and it's still the same thing you
[2:13:18] just want to pull your hair out and say
[2:13:19] ah if you take it to a mechanic they'll
[2:13:22] say whoo electrical problem
[2:13:25] some mechanics will say ah nah I'm not
[2:13:27] even interested it's just a hassle I'll
[2:13:30] do some work on it in the end of this be
[2:13:32] an endless warranty case some mechanics
[2:13:34] aren't even interested but you know what
[2:13:36] they're common electrical problems are
[2:13:38] common and I just I just want to try and
[2:13:40] relate this a little bit to us just
[2:13:42] hopefully it does something for us you
[2:13:44] know they they will just continue to
[2:13:46] drain the Dynamics in the vehicle and
[2:13:48] every time you want to go you can't go
[2:13:50] it's frustrating
[2:13:52] and it's so difficult to deal with
[2:13:54] vehicles nowadays with so many wires in
[2:13:56] them and you know I just I've just been
[2:13:59] going through something with the vehicle
[2:14:00] that we've got and and it's just it's
[2:14:03] super frustrating and uh you know
[2:14:06] it's it's it's just the way it is in
[2:14:08] this life I guess we have these things
[2:14:10] that we've got to deal with and uh so
[2:14:12] we've got this side by side most people
[2:14:14] are familiar with it and it's it's just
[2:14:17] continually dying and I I just was
[2:14:19] thinking you know doing a little bit of
[2:14:20] troubleshooting how do I deal with this
[2:14:22] how do I fix this because I don't want
[2:14:24] to go to a mechanic and pay him the shop
[2:14:26] rates to do it not that they're not
[2:14:28] worth it but I don't think I just really
[2:14:30] have the money for it but I just don't
[2:14:32] want to do it you know and so anyways I
[2:14:34] I haven't really troubleshot it yet I've
[2:14:36] just tried to bandage it and boost it
[2:14:38] and try and get it to go and finally it
[2:14:41] just died yesterday and it just made me
[2:14:42] think you know what what is this problem
[2:14:44] and I started to research it a little
[2:14:46] bit type in the making the model in the
[2:14:48] internet and see what it is and you know
[2:14:50] what they call these types of drains
[2:14:51] they call them parasitic power drains
[2:14:55] parasitic power drains a life that lives
[2:14:58] off of something else right and it's
[2:15:01] just a teeny little bit of a drain but
[2:15:03] it's just a teeny little bit of enough
[2:15:05] of a drain to make it not useful
[2:15:08] and it makes it so frustrating
[2:15:13] I haven't really troubleshot it but I
[2:15:15] will and I'll get to the bottom of it
[2:15:17] but you know it just made me think about
[2:15:19] how this this types the natural to the
[2:15:22] spiritual
[2:15:23] a parasitic power drain
[2:15:26] how can that be dynamically speaking in
[2:15:30] the Church of the Living God
[2:15:32] we can have a parasitic power drain of
[2:15:34] the Dynamics in our life or in our
[2:15:37] spirit in in our service
[2:15:40] how many times does it happen
[2:15:44] and I just want to say it you know
[2:15:45] sometimes we need to troubleshoot it you
[2:15:48] know the the process some people might
[2:15:50] understand the process that they were
[2:15:51] saying to troubleshoot this stuff you
[2:15:53] can put a gauge on the battery and you
[2:15:54] can read the the reading of how what the
[2:15:56] electrical current is currently in the
[2:15:58] battery and and you can just go to the
[2:16:00] fuse block and you can pull out fuse by
[2:16:02] fuse and that number should stay the
[2:16:04] same whether it's good or bad on the
[2:16:06] battery it should stay there on the
[2:16:07] reading but as soon as you find which
[2:16:09] fuse stops that drain from happening you
[2:16:13] know what circuit it is but it takes
[2:16:15] research
[2:16:17] it takes a little bit of Investigation
[2:16:18] it takes a little bit of consultation
[2:16:21] you have to talk to someone who knows
[2:16:22] how to deal with this stuff if you have
[2:16:24] a problem in your life brothers and
[2:16:26] sisters that you can't seem to get over
[2:16:27] the word of God says to confess your
[2:16:29] faults one to another then actually pray
[2:16:32] for one another and you can be healed
[2:16:36] all right but if we're too afraid to
[2:16:38] talk
[2:16:39] if if we've been hurt before because
[2:16:42] we've talked and somebody else has gone
[2:16:44] and talked about what we've talked about
[2:16:45] it's pretty tough to let your guard down
[2:16:48] but you know what don't give up brothers
[2:16:50] and sisters There's real Believers
[2:16:51] there's people that you can have
[2:16:53] confidence in
[2:16:54] there's a five-fold Ministry
[2:16:57] but we need to take a look at every
[2:16:59] single circuit to make sure that we find
[2:17:01] that problem and when we find that
[2:17:03] problem we can isolate it is what it's
[2:17:05] called and when you could isolate it
[2:17:07] then you can actually deal with it
[2:17:08] sometimes you got to go in and you got
[2:17:10] to cut some wire you got to cut that bad
[2:17:12] section of wire right out of there and
[2:17:14] get rid of it and you got to splice in a
[2:17:16] new section of wire and you know what if
[2:17:19] we have something in our lives that
[2:17:20] we've identified it's a problem and we
[2:17:22] just don't know how to deal with it ask
[2:17:23] God to come and splice in a new piece of
[2:17:25] wire and he'll do it properly brothers
[2:17:27] and sisters so much so that we won't
[2:17:29] even remember that we had that problem
[2:17:31] when it's done
[2:17:34] but you know what as human beings we're
[2:17:36] predictable aren't we
[2:17:38] we're creatures of habit and you know
[2:17:41] why we are
[2:17:42] I would say this because we're living in
[2:17:45] the hybrid condition because animals are
[2:17:47] the same way even though they're
[2:17:49] unpredictable sometimes humans can be
[2:17:51] very unpredictable too but you know I
[2:17:54] remember a story brother told about uh
[2:17:57] maybe it was even here I don't know but
[2:18:00] it was a story about a raccoon in a
[2:18:02] national park and how the park Warden
[2:18:05] was explaining they were looking at this
[2:18:07] Trail in the in the in the national park
[2:18:09] and and this this this park Warden was
[2:18:13] there explaining that trail had been
[2:18:15] there for decades maybe even centuries
[2:18:18] and and on that trail there are specific
[2:18:21] footprints
[2:18:22] I think it was even in the Rocks close
[2:18:24] to the river and and worn into the Rocks
[2:18:27] Footprints and and what the the warden
[2:18:30] said was this is where a raccoon walks
[2:18:33] and they've done it families for
[2:18:35] generations and generations they walk
[2:18:37] along this pathway and the warden said
[2:18:39] that you can guarantee that a raccoon
[2:18:41] will put his foot right there
[2:18:43] you can see that footprint and you know
[2:18:46] that that raccoon will actually do that
[2:18:48] and I just remembered thinking about
[2:18:50] this I started as I Was preparing I
[2:18:52] started thinking about this little story
[2:18:53] and I just thought yeah you know it's
[2:18:55] applicable because as human beings if
[2:18:57] we're not careful the devil who is that
[2:18:59] parasitic drain in our lives he'll know
[2:19:02] that if outside of us living according
[2:19:04] to the word of God in our day he will
[2:19:06] see that we'll put our foot right there
[2:19:08] he'll know that that is our weakness and
[2:19:10] we will go and we'll put our foot right
[2:19:12] there in that spot and as soon as we do
[2:19:13] it then he'll grab us and you'll have us
[2:19:15] and we'll have that parasitic drain and
[2:19:17] we'll go through the same cycle over and
[2:19:19] over again but you know brothers and
[2:19:21] sisters we have the ability to sidestep
[2:19:23] the devil we don't have to walk in the
[2:19:25] same path that we walked all of our
[2:19:27] Lives we don't have to walk in the same
[2:19:28] path that our daddy walked in or that
[2:19:30] our Granddad walked in or that our
[2:19:32] great-grandfather walked in or our
[2:19:34] uncles or our aunts we can walk in the
[2:19:37] place where we have been told to walk we
[2:19:39] can walk with the Apostles of trod
[2:19:41] brothers and sisters we don't have to
[2:19:42] follow the genetic conditions that we
[2:19:45] live in
[2:19:47] humans are predictable according to the
[2:19:49] devil but sons and gods of Sons and
[2:19:52] Daughters of God they're not gonna
[2:19:53] they're not gonna follow what the devil
[2:19:54] has
[2:19:56] a perseverance in 1962-0719e
[2:20:01] paragraph 120
[2:20:03] . well anybody knows
[2:20:05] an old bleached out Jawbone of a mule
[2:20:07] and then Philistines helmets
[2:20:10] was better than an inch thick with brass
[2:20:12] and a vesture of what they call mail
[2:20:15] which was lapped over metal
[2:20:18] down like that and with Spears and great
[2:20:20] Shields a thousand of them
[2:20:23] but the spirit of the Lord come upon
[2:20:26] that little shrimp
[2:20:27] wasn't a giant come upon that little
[2:20:30] shrimp he reached back there
[2:20:32] where
[2:20:34] to that Nazarite vow
[2:20:35] he reached back there to that place in
[2:20:37] his life and he was able to feel them
[2:20:39] locks
[2:20:40] he knew that that's where his strength
[2:20:42] lied he knew that was an indicator that
[2:20:45] he had that position of God and as soon
[2:20:48] as he recognized that what happened
[2:20:50] brother Branham goes on to say it he
[2:20:52] reached back there and felt them Seven
[2:20:53] Locks he knowed he was still a Nazarite
[2:20:56] Hallelujah he took what was in his hand
[2:20:59] and he beat them skulls right in with
[2:21:02] that old Jawbone and anybody knows you
[2:21:04] hit one of them skulls with a Jawbone
[2:21:06] it'd fly into a million pieces
[2:21:09] but God was there to hold it together
[2:21:13] and he beat down and killed a thousand
[2:21:15] Philistines
[2:21:16] he was persistent why
[2:21:19] he wasn't afraid
[2:21:20] he could feel that Nazarite vow with him
[2:21:24] Hallelujah
[2:21:28] I want to encourage us this morning
[2:21:29] brothers and sisters
[2:21:31] reach back there and feel that Nazarite
[2:21:33] vow
[2:21:34] look for that Nazarite vow in your life
[2:21:36] if you haven't looked for it recently
[2:21:38] take some time
[2:21:40] take a little bit of time and think
[2:21:42] about that Nazarite vow in your life if
[2:21:44] the devil is tempting yes or Rejoice
[2:21:46] because there's something that he wants
[2:21:48] from you and you know what he can never
[2:21:50] have it because you are a Nazarite unto
[2:21:52] the Lord from before the foundation of
[2:21:55] the world just reach back there wherever
[2:21:57] it is and feel those locks of hair and
[2:22:00] stand up to the devil stand in your
[2:22:02] position don't back up March forwards
[2:22:07] brother Branham says in paragraph 122 a
[2:22:09] man or a woman can feel the presence of
[2:22:10] Jesus Christ know that you are born
[2:22:13] again of the Holy Ghost
[2:22:16] let nothing stand in your way
[2:22:19] persistent when God speaks down and says
[2:22:22] it's you I give you Faith tonight your
[2:22:27] healing is sure
[2:22:28] it's my word then you can be persistent
[2:22:34] I just think that's so beautiful we
[2:22:36] don't have to tolerate the devil
[2:22:38] brothers and sisters
[2:22:41] but I know it my experience we get
[2:22:43] little parasitic little Dynamic drains
[2:22:47] in our lives Little Things
[2:22:49] but remember it's not the big things
[2:22:51] that really do us in is it it's the
[2:22:54] little foxes that spoil the vine
[2:22:57] the little foxes the little tiny things
[2:22:59] they're the ones that do it
[2:23:04] it's wonderful that we can actually
[2:23:06] really see the young boys up here in the
[2:23:09] front row
[2:23:11] the young believers
[2:23:13] the ones who are listening to this word
[2:23:15] being preached the ones who actually
[2:23:17] will grow up to be those samsons that
[2:23:20] will be able to reach back and feel
[2:23:22] those locks of hair one day because the
[2:23:23] devil's coming as a roaring lion to see
[2:23:26] who he can devour but you know Brothers
[2:23:29] when you've got the holy ghost in your
[2:23:31] life Ain't Nothing Gonna Move you
[2:23:33] you'll be able to withstand every single
[2:23:35] Temptation the devil brings at you
[2:23:38] how to perseverant perseverance 1964.
[2:23:42] brother Branham says we find this Samson
[2:23:43] was a Nazarite he had seven little curls
[2:23:45] that hung down his back and when the
[2:23:47] spirit of the Lord come upon him he
[2:23:49] feared nothing why he was persistent as
[2:23:51] long as he could feel that Nazarite vow
[2:23:53] with him as long as he could reach back
[2:23:55] here and feel those locks he knew that
[2:23:57] he was in the will of God and nothing
[2:23:59] could bind him a city couldn't bind him
[2:24:01] a lion couldn't kill him he took the
[2:24:03] Jawbone of a mule and it dried and beat
[2:24:06] down a thousand Philistines with it do
[2:24:08] you know those helmets those brass
[2:24:10] helmets was over an inch thick you know
[2:24:11] what would happen happen when an old
[2:24:13] desert dry bone would hit against him
[2:24:15] why it would burst into a million pieces
[2:24:17] he stood there single-handed with his
[2:24:19] Jawbone of a mule
[2:24:21] beating over their head and killed a
[2:24:23] thousand Philistines why he was
[2:24:25] persistent every time he hit he felt
[2:24:28] that Nazarite vow moved back upon him
[2:24:32] how much
[2:24:33] ought the church tonight that claims
[2:24:36] that you are born of the spirit of God
[2:24:40] I just think it's beautiful because he
[2:24:42] doesn't say that he just went and felt
[2:24:44] that that Nazarite vow I better call the
[2:24:46] musicians he he didn't just reach back
[2:24:48] there and feel that Nazarite vow and
[2:24:49] then go and hit one it was every time he
[2:24:52] hit one he felt that Nazarite vow and
[2:24:54] brothers and sisters this morning I want
[2:24:56] to say it for us every time you slay a
[2:24:59] devil how are you going to slay a devil
[2:25:01] not by rebuking it by rebuking it by
[2:25:03] simply saying I rebuke you in the name
[2:25:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ and then just
[2:25:06] walk it away from it
[2:25:08] you destroy that devil
[2:25:10] because that devil has no more power
[2:25:12] over you
[2:25:13] you can't get your hands on the devil
[2:25:15] and tangibly tear them apart you can
[2:25:18] destroy him by having no influence over
[2:25:20] you you got no power over me Satan your
[2:25:24] minions don't work all of your tactics
[2:25:26] are finished we know exactly what your
[2:25:29] answer is and I am your answer that I am
[2:25:32] truly The Living Church of the Living
[2:25:35] God I am the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:25:36] brother Branham says how much ought the
[2:25:39] church tonight that claims that you are
[2:25:41] born of the spirit of God standing in
[2:25:42] the meeting seeing the Vindication of
[2:25:44] the resurrection of Jesus Christ and
[2:25:46] claimed to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:25:47] and could sit still and let Satan push
[2:25:49] you around like he does
[2:25:52] it's a strange thing
[2:25:54] as long as you can feel the presence of
[2:25:57] the Holy Ghost
[2:25:58] know that it's his word and his promise
[2:26:00] for this day you should be persistent
[2:26:03] and press in until it's over
[2:26:06] perseverance stay with it
[2:26:09] God promised it
[2:26:11] it's not you it's God
[2:26:15] just remember that brothers and sisters
[2:26:17] it's not up to us to make it come to
[2:26:18] pass
[2:26:19] it's up to God to make it come to pass
[2:26:21] but you know the quote we read at the
[2:26:22] beginning is just close your eyes and
[2:26:24] just close your eyes to that devil to
[2:26:26] that snake to that problem to that
[2:26:27] situation just close your eyes and just
[2:26:29] walk by and just say Lord deliver me
[2:26:32] from this moment and you know what
[2:26:33] you'll actually get the sweetest honey
[2:26:35] that you've ever had in your life
[2:26:36] because you'll have the victory over
[2:26:38] that thing
[2:26:39] and all we need to do is exercise that
[2:26:42] exercise
[2:26:43] not stand and try and fight it if we try
[2:26:45] and fight it we're not going to do it
[2:26:46] it's got to be God
[2:26:48] just give it over to him maybe stand
[2:26:49] with me this morning as we close
[2:26:54] this bow gracious Heavenly Father
[2:26:56] Lord Jesus I pray that this morning
[2:26:59] somehow some way the word spoken was
[2:27:01] able to just encourage someone father
[2:27:03] Lord I pray that we would be able to
[2:27:06] just reach back and feel that Nazarite
[2:27:09] vow and Lord not just every time we have
[2:27:11] a problem but father let us go forwards
[2:27:14] with confidence knowing that we have the
[2:27:16] word oh father that we have the Holy
[2:27:18] Ghost In Our Lives Lord that there's
[2:27:19] nothing that needs to stand in our way
[2:27:21] because we have everything when we have
[2:27:23] you Lord Jesus
[2:27:25] and Satan cannot stand before us we know
[2:27:27] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[2:27:29] the Revelation that you have given us
[2:27:31] help us to recognize that Lord as we go
[2:27:34] forwards I pray that you would bless the
[2:27:36] visitors father that you would just give
[2:27:38] them an abundance of of peace and joy
[2:27:40] father that you would just take them
[2:27:42] home with a spring in their step Lord
[2:27:43] Jesus father that you would give them
[2:27:45] traveling mercies all the way back home
[2:27:47] and they would bring them there safely
[2:27:49] at the appointed time father and Lord if
[2:27:52] it be a will for us to gather together
[2:27:53] after service Lord we'll be thankful and
[2:27:56] and and and give you all the praise and
[2:27:58] all the glory we just asked now that you
[2:28:00] would be with sister Tina once again
[2:28:02] father that your will would be worked
[2:28:04] out in her life father because she's
[2:28:06] being persistent father Lord we just
[2:28:09] invite you Lord to have your will in
[2:28:11] your way we'll stand together with her
[2:28:13] as Believers of your word father we love
[2:28:16] you and we thank you we ask all these
[2:28:18] things now in Jesus Christ's name we
