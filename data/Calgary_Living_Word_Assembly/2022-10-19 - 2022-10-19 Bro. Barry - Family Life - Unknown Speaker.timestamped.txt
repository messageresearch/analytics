[33:43] name we pray amen
[33:46] [Music]
[33:47] musicians
[33:49] if you have your Bibles tonight I just
[33:51] want to go back to
[33:53] what we were reading about in the past
[33:58] maybe pick up and carry on just as a
[34:02] refresher will turn to Ephesians chapter
[34:04] 5.
[34:05] then I would like to turn over to
[34:07] Colossians chapter 3.
[34:10] and then I would like to turn over to
[34:14] First Peter chapter 3.
[34:17] talking about families and roles
[34:20] husbands wives children
[34:25] we read it on Sunday brother Branham
[34:28] says it
[34:29] it's important to not try and bring too
[34:31] much at one time and to make sure that
[34:33] when we get a specific point to just
[34:37] continually hold it before the people
[34:39] until they get it and I'm sure that
[34:41] everyone has it but
[34:44] um I just feel led to go back here so
[34:46] Ephesians chapter 5
[34:48] verse 21 submitting yourselves one to
[34:51] another in the fear of God I believe
[34:52] this is the key to it all right here
[34:55] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[34:58] husbands as unto the Lord for the
[35:00] husband is the head of the wife even as
[35:02] Christ is the head of the church
[35:05] and he is the savior of the body
[35:07] therefore as the church is subject unto
[35:10] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[35:12] husbands in everything
[35:15] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[35:17] also loved the church and gave himself
[35:20] for it
[35:21] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[35:23] with the washing of the Water by the
[35:25] word
[35:26] that he might present it to himself a
[35:29] glorious church not having spot or
[35:31] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[35:34] should be holy and without blemish
[35:37] so ought men to love their wives as
[35:40] their own bodies
[35:41] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[35:45] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[35:47] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[35:50] the Lord the church for we are members
[35:53] of his body of his flesh and of his
[35:55] bones
[35:57] for this cause shall a man leave his
[35:59] father and mother and shall be joined
[36:01] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[36:04] flesh
[36:05] this is a great mystery but I speak
[36:07] concerning Christ and the church
[36:09] nevertheless that every one of you in
[36:13] particular
[36:14] so love his wife even as himself
[36:17] and the wife see that she reverence her
[36:19] husband
[36:22] as you turn over to Colossians chapter 3
[36:25] I just want to mention this here I think
[36:27] it's so important that I said it before
[36:30] but I just want to say it again that
[36:31] before we get into the roles and and
[36:34] talking about husbands and wives as Paul
[36:36] mentions here the key to it all is to be
[36:39] able to submit yourselves one to another
[36:41] in the fear of God and not think that
[36:43] the scripture puts one above the other
[36:45] and not to say that she's a weaker
[36:47] vessel so she needs needs to submit and
[36:49] that's just all that's truly not the
[36:52] spirit of Christ because Christ gave his
[36:55] life for his wife
[36:57] and he didn't put her away and how many
[37:00] occasions actually when we talk about
[37:02] this as the Bride of Jesus Christ do we
[37:05] give him to truly be able to put us away
[37:08] because it was for a fornication right
[37:11] adultery
[37:12] that's the the reason that's what makes
[37:15] it legal according to the law but we
[37:17] don't live under the law do we we live
[37:18] under grace but if we really want to
[37:20] talk about it
[37:22] um as his wife how many occasions does
[37:24] he have to put us away if he truly
[37:26] wanted to according to this word my
[37:28] goodness isn't his grace marvelous don't
[37:30] we have a lot to Rejoice for
[37:33] goodness of God my goodness you know I
[37:36] just want to read from verse 16 just to
[37:38] bring a little context to this scripture
[37:40] here in Colossians chapter 3 and and
[37:43] we'll just go down to 20.
[37:45] so Colossians chapter 3 verse 16 let the
[37:48] word of Christ dwell in you richly
[37:52] in all wisdom
[37:54] knowing that we have an open book
[37:55] there's no more Mysteries right
[37:58] let the word of Christ dwell in you
[38:00] richly in all wisdom
[38:02] teaching and admonishing one another in
[38:06] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[38:08] singing with Grace in your hearts to the
[38:11] Lord that's what we did tonight my and
[38:14] when he hears that he comes
[38:16] verse 17 and whatsoever ye do in word or
[38:20] deed do all in the name of the Lord
[38:23] Jesus
[38:24] giving thanks to God and the father by
[38:27] him
[38:28] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[38:31] husbands as it is fit in the Lord
[38:33] husbands love your wives
[38:36] and be not bitter against them children
[38:39] obey your parents in all things for this
[38:42] is well pleasing unto the Lord
[38:45] if you'll turn with me over to First
[38:48] Peter chapter 3.
[38:55] I remember brother Ken preaching on on
[38:57] on I think this very scripture here and
[38:59] whatsoever ye do and word or deed do all
[39:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[39:04] and you know brothers and sisters if we
[39:06] can't do whatever it is we want to do in
[39:08] the name of the Lord Jesus then we ought
[39:10] to do it
[39:12] we better just put it aside and say no I
[39:14] I don't need to do that because I can't
[39:16] do it according to the word I can't do
[39:19] it with the Lord Jesus
[39:21] whatsoever we do in word or deed
[39:24] First Peter chapter 3
[39:26] likewise ye wives this is verse one of
[39:30] First Peter chapter three likewise he
[39:33] wives be in subjection to your own
[39:35] husbands
[39:37] that if any obey not the word they also
[39:41] May with a conversation without sorry
[39:45] that if any obey not the word they also
[39:48] May without the word be won by the
[39:51] conversation of the wives
[39:55] while they behold your Chase
[39:56] conversation coupled with fear who's
[39:59] adorning let it not be that outward
[40:01] adorning of plating the hair and of
[40:03] wearing of gold or putting on of apparel
[40:07] but let it be the hidden man of the
[40:09] heart
[40:10] in that which is not corruptable even
[40:12] the ornament of a Meek and quiet spirit
[40:16] which is in the sight of God of great
[40:19] price
[40:20] for after this manner in the old time
[40:23] the holy women also who trusted in God
[40:25] adorned themselves being in subjection
[40:28] unto their own husbands
[40:31] even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him
[40:33] Lord whose daughters ye are as long as
[40:36] ye do well and are not afraid with any
[40:39] amazement
[40:40] like wise ye husbands dwell with them
[40:43] according to knowledge
[40:45] giving honor unto the wife as unto the
[40:48] weaker vessel and as being heirs
[40:51] together of the grace of life
[40:53] that your prayers be not hindered
[40:56] let's just bow in prayer
[40:59] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we pray that
[41:01] tonight our prayers wouldn't be hindered
[41:04] Lord we pray that we could take this
[41:06] scripture into our very Souls Lord Jesus
[41:08] that we could just savor it Lord when we
[41:11] look at our lives and we look at our our
[41:13] positions in our homes and in our
[41:16] families Lord Jesus let us also examine
[41:19] our position in you father Lord are we a
[41:22] good wife unto you Lord Jesus are we
[41:25] good children obeying your word unto you
[41:28] father Lord we just ask that you would
[41:30] bless the reading of your word now as we
[41:33] go forwards tonight we pray that you
[41:34] would just speak to us father once again
[41:36] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[41:40] bless you tonight you may be seated
[41:44] I just felt it would be good to have a
[41:46] little bit of a uh just a refresher to
[41:49] go back to
[41:50] kind of talking about the roles in the
[41:53] family and Lord willing we'll continue
[41:56] on with this study this teaching I think
[41:59] it's been absolutely wonderful
[42:02] if for nobody else just for myself I
[42:04] apologize if that's a little a little
[42:06] selfish I certainly don't mean it to be
[42:07] that way but it's really opened my eyes
[42:10] of understanding given me an
[42:11] understanding that I don't think I've
[42:13] had in the past
[42:15] just have a few announcements tonight we
[42:17] have a prayer meeting tomorrow evening
[42:19] we have a youth event Friday evening
[42:21] on the 29th we have the Men's breakfast
[42:23] in Edmonton on the 30th we'll have a
[42:26] communion service
[42:28] on the 31st we're going to have a
[42:29] fellowship
[42:31] and sounds like a busy Church life and
[42:34] it is
[42:35] where we certainly want to make
[42:37] opportunity and occasion to be able to
[42:39] get together as much as possible and you
[42:41] know if I've always said this and I'll
[42:43] continue to say it if you're busy and
[42:45] and life has its pressures I understand
[42:48] it there's no judgment if you can't come
[42:51] to anything we know that the communion
[42:53] table is a very important thing I would
[42:55] highly recommend making that a priority
[42:57] but it's up to you let the Holy Ghost
[42:59] lead you there's no pressure nobody's
[43:01] going to judge you and say because you
[43:03] didn't come you're not worthy to any one
[43:05] of the things that we mentioned so
[43:07] remember the prophet said the quote he
[43:10] said was the desire in the heart should
[43:13] be to be there not that when every time
[43:14] the doors are open that you actually are
[43:16] there physically it's important to make
[43:18] sure that we do get the quotes right I'm
[43:21] sure he says it both ways but I just
[43:24] want to make sure that we understand
[43:25] that it's truly what what's the desire
[43:27] in the heart of the individual right
[43:29] it's not a a code of conduct coming to
[43:33] this building every single time the
[43:35] doors are open are coming to a
[43:36] fellowship every time we get together or
[43:38] being a part of an event every time
[43:39] there's an event that's not going to
[43:41] save you that that might actually
[43:43] mislead you if you feel like that's
[43:45] going to do something for your salvation
[43:46] your salvation is is solely dependent on
[43:49] your ability to surrender to the word
[43:51] for your day to actually get get
[43:54] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:55] Christ for the remission of your sins to
[43:57] repent for your sins to then get
[43:59] baptized and then actually get the
[44:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what's
[44:03] going to save you and that's all that
[44:04] will save you it won't be a church
[44:05] attendance it won't be a church
[44:06] membership it won't be saying God sent a
[44:09] prophet or any of that and and I'll stop
[44:11] now I'll just continue on with our
[44:13] teaching tonight
[44:15] um if you can come then God Bless you
[44:17] that's great we did ask for I believe
[44:20] the the
[44:21] 31st fellowship if you're coming to let
[44:23] us know we want to RSVP that so we can
[44:26] make sure that we have enough Provisions
[44:28] for everyone we're gonna I think order
[44:30] some pizza and just have some fellowship
[44:32] so just let us know November the 12th uh
[44:35] 10 a.m it's a Saturday we're going to
[44:37] have a men's breakfast in Calgary here
[44:39] the details are yet to come and what I
[44:42] want to do is talk to the brothers I
[44:43] want to have an open Forum where we can
[44:45] get together and and talk about the the
[44:48] things in our lives that we deal with as
[44:51] brothers I believe it's important uh
[44:54] just right out of Titus we're going to
[44:57] read Titus a little bit later Titus
[44:58] Chapter 2 we've haven't mentioned it for
[45:00] a while but we're going to continue to
[45:02] hold this before us we want to make sure
[45:04] that the elders are instructing the
[45:06] youngers the elders have gone through
[45:08] battles when we come to church and we
[45:10] see the elders in the church it looks
[45:11] like everything is perfect in the elders
[45:13] lives the elders actually
[45:16] everything seems to be fine but for the
[45:18] young people that don't know it yet the
[45:20] elders have many scars in their lives
[45:22] many battles that have been fought many
[45:24] battles that they've had to surrender
[45:26] all of their will to get through so that
[45:29] the Lord could win the battle and I know
[45:31] that in Titus it says for The Elder
[45:33] women to instruct the young women but it
[45:35] also says for the men to instruct the
[45:37] young the Elder men to instruct the
[45:39] young men so we're definitely going to
[45:41] get together and we're going to see what
[45:42] the Lord will do there
[45:44] we're not trying to bring in a program
[45:45] or or do anything like that this is
[45:48] simply just trying to apply the word and
[45:50] and go forwards and you know what if
[45:52] it's incorrect then God will actually
[45:54] change it I trust he will and if it's
[45:56] correct then I trust God will bless it
[45:58] one way or another God will have his way
[46:01] and if we just sit still and do nothing
[46:03] then God isn't really going to do much
[46:05] will he we need to be able to march
[46:07] forward and trust that God will go we
[46:09] need to be strong and very courageous
[46:11] and not be dismayed about all the
[46:13] different thoughts and ideas that we
[46:14] encounter in our lives we've got to be
[46:16] willing to just trust God and so that's
[46:19] what we want to do here you know looking
[46:21] at this scripture here in uh in in First
[46:23] Peter
[46:24] chapter 3 there's so much that I want to
[46:27] say about the other ones but this one
[46:28] really caught my attention tonight
[46:30] thinking that you know when we look at
[46:32] this wives be in subjection unto your
[46:34] own husbands
[46:36] it's important to do that
[46:38] why is it say that it says it here that
[46:41] if any obey not the word
[46:44] they also May without the word
[46:48] be won by the conversation of the wives
[46:53] the wives have the occasion to save the
[46:55] husbands that might just be a little bit
[46:57] outside of the word the husbands that
[46:59] don't quite have the word and I thought
[47:02] you know that's that's interesting
[47:03] because many times as husbands we're the
[47:06] leaders all the times were the leaders
[47:08] we're supposed to be the head of the
[47:09] home and truly we are scripturally
[47:12] speaking spiritually speaking we are the
[47:14] heads of the home but sometimes we can
[47:16] get just a little bit out of order
[47:18] in the home sometimes we can get just a
[47:20] little bit out of order in our position
[47:22] sometimes we can get a little bit just
[47:25] off the word if you will maybe the
[47:28] temper gets a hold of us maybe we get
[47:30] distracted with something maybe
[47:31] something happens in our life and we
[47:33] just get a little bit off this word here
[47:35] is saying that the wife if she is in
[47:38] subject subjection to her husband then
[47:41] she has the opportunity to actually do
[47:43] something about it she can be the one to
[47:46] actually have the conversation to bring
[47:48] her husband back to the center line and
[47:51] if she's not subject to her husband how
[47:53] will she ever do that if she just gets
[47:55] upset and and does her own thing
[47:58] you know with this study here I've
[48:00] really been impressed with it because
[48:01] when we look at the roles when we look
[48:03] at wives being in subjection to their
[48:05] husbands and we look at husbands loving
[48:08] the wives and we look at children
[48:10] obeying the parents really what's
[48:12] happening when we don't follow those
[48:14] instructions we can say that we're not
[48:17] according to the word for our wives or
[48:19] for our husbands or or for our parents
[48:22] but really what's happening is it's for
[48:24] God
[48:25] because the children when you look at
[48:27] your parents your parents are actually
[48:29] the Lord for you remember whether
[48:31] Bradham said that your parents are
[48:33] actually the Holy Ghost until the age of
[48:35] accountability for the children to me
[48:37] that's such a heavy weight that's such a
[48:39] has so much gravity to it as a parent to
[48:42] think that we are the Holy Ghost for our
[48:44] children until the age of accountability
[48:47] how much pressure is that that's that's
[48:49] quite a bit of responsibility as a
[48:51] parent to make sure that we're not
[48:54] bringing garbage into our homes many
[48:56] times we can do that and say you know we
[48:59] will just make excuse for it and say
[49:01] well it's just it's just this or it's
[49:03] just that I would say this brothers and
[49:05] sisters brothers specifically if you're
[49:08] bringing something into your home make
[49:10] sure that you can do it according to the
[49:12] Lord that you can invite the Lord Jesus
[49:14] Christ to be a part of whatever it is
[49:16] you're doing and if you can't do that
[49:18] you better not bring it into your home
[49:20] because sometimes you can actually open
[49:22] the proverbial Pandora's Box you can get
[49:25] a devil to enter into your home enter
[49:27] into your family and you know it happens
[49:29] very easily and very subtly but try and
[49:32] get rid of it once you get it there it's
[49:34] not that easy it actually can become
[49:37] detrimental to the family unit and it's
[49:40] just easier to avoid it and that's one
[49:42] reason brother Bradham said you know
[49:43] just get the shotgun out and get rid of
[49:45] the television shoot it out but now now
[49:48] we know the devil pulled one over on
[49:49] humanity and and put a a smartphone in
[49:53] everybody's hand which gives them the
[49:54] ability to have access to way more than
[49:56] a television could even have I remember
[49:58] when I was a kid they were talking about
[50:00] the information superhighway and I
[50:02] didn't really understand what that meant
[50:03] but I do now
[50:05] because you don't even have to do
[50:07] anything we had such a weird situation a
[50:09] little while ago
[50:11] um I was just having a conversation with
[50:13] Isaac our oldest and I can't remember
[50:15] even what it was about it was just a an
[50:18] off-the-cuff strange conversation we had
[50:20] about something and suddenly my phone in
[50:24] my pocket started playing a song with
[50:27] the lyrics exactly according to the
[50:30] words that we were speaking
[50:32] and he thought that I actually played
[50:34] that song because sometimes I'll just be
[50:36] silly and I know a lot about music and a
[50:38] lot of songs and different things and
[50:40] you know I'm sorry I'm I'm human too I
[50:43] had a weakness when I was in the world
[50:44] and still pray for me but he thought
[50:47] that I was actually playing the song
[50:49] because it was about the conversation we
[50:50] were having and it was just the phone
[50:52] picked it up I don't know if I pushed
[50:54] the button by accident and Siri just
[50:56] started listening or must have been but
[50:59] what a strange thing these things are
[51:01] always listening
[51:03] we need to be careful what we bring into
[51:05] our homes
[51:06] but looking at this this tonight you
[51:08] know in my Bible it says the meek Spirit
[51:10] how important it is for a wife to be in
[51:12] her position how important it is for a
[51:14] husband to be in his position how
[51:15] important it is for a child to be in
[51:17] their position because when we're in our
[51:18] positions and we're actually living Our
[51:21] Lives serving according to what the
[51:22] Bible says for our positions we're
[51:24] actually serving God that way brothers
[51:25] and sisters don't look at it and think
[51:27] well I'm serving God because I go to
[51:29] church and because I pay my tithe and
[51:31] because I pray and I read my Bible those
[51:34] are all parts of it but what about your
[51:36] role how do you act in your family how
[51:38] do you act in your role according to
[51:40] your spouse or or your parents if we're
[51:43] out of order that way then that's how
[51:45] we're serving God
[51:47] it's important to look at it that way
[51:49] because that's the word of God and if
[51:52] we're not following the word of God are
[51:53] we serving God
[51:55] it can be real easy to to just be going
[51:58] through the motions and not really be in
[52:00] there but I just think it's fascinating
[52:02] here to look at this how the wives can
[52:04] can be in subjection to their own
[52:05] husbands that if any obey not the word
[52:07] that they also without the word may be
[52:11] won by the conversation of the wives the
[52:13] wives can intercede and you know while I
[52:16] was going through this and and it just
[52:17] struck me it's awesome how the Lord
[52:19] takes us and leads us turn with me over
[52:21] to Exodus chapter four there's an
[52:23] example of this in here it's a wonderful
[52:25] example
[52:27] and you know you probably know exactly
[52:30] where I'm going with it but it's just
[52:32] it's just neat to see that it's possible
[52:35] for a wife to save the husband
[52:37] when she's actually in her position but
[52:40] you know what happens if a wife gets out
[52:42] of her position and says nope I'm strong
[52:44] and I'm just gonna do my thing and say
[52:46] no way you're not going to get away with
[52:48] that you're not going to treat me that
[52:49] way I'm going to do my thing yada yada
[52:51] yada you know it just becomes difficult
[52:54] for the Lord to actually move in the
[52:56] situation but in Exodus chapter 4 verse
[52:58] 19 it's the story of zipporah
[53:02] brother Branham said that Moses had a
[53:04] temper
[53:04] and God gave him a wife with one also
[53:09] right
[53:11] Exodus chapter 4 verse 19 and the Lord
[53:13] said unto Moses in Midian go returning
[53:16] to Egypt for all the men are dead which
[53:19] sought thy life
[53:21] and Moses took his wife and his sons and
[53:23] set them up on an ass and returned to
[53:25] the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod
[53:27] of God in his hand and the Lord said
[53:30] unto Moses when thou goest to return
[53:32] into Egypt
[53:34] see that thou do all those wonders
[53:37] before Pharaoh which I have put in thine
[53:39] hand but I will harden his heart that he
[53:42] shall not let the people go
[53:45] and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh thus
[53:47] saith the Lord Israel is my son even my
[53:49] firstborn and I say unto thee let my son
[53:52] go that he may serve thee and if you
[53:55] thou and if thou refuse to let him go
[53:57] behold I will slay thy son even thy
[54:01] firstborn
[54:02] so even right before he went down there
[54:05] God was given him the instructions for
[54:07] the final plague that's what's going to
[54:09] happen Pharaoh you're going to lose your
[54:10] son if you won't let mine go
[54:13] verse 24 and it came to pass by the way
[54:16] in the Inn that the Lord met him and
[54:19] sought to kill him
[54:20] sought to kill Moses the Lord met him
[54:23] and was going to kill him verse 25 then
[54:26] Sephora
[54:27] took a sharp Stone and cut off the
[54:29] foreskin of her son and cast it at his
[54:31] feet and said surely a bloody husband
[54:33] Thou Art to me
[54:35] so he let him go
[54:37] and she reminded him she said a bloody
[54:40] husband Thou Art because of the
[54:42] circumcision
[54:43] you're supposed to do it but you didn't
[54:45] do it so I had to intercede for you
[54:49] and because of that you live
[54:52] and she recognized that she acknowledged
[54:54] that she made sure in case he forgot it
[54:56] she reminded him again
[54:59] isn't it interesting though it just
[55:01] completely dovetails with First Peter
[55:03] chapter 3 here that the wives when
[55:06] they're in subjection to their own
[55:07] husbands when they're in tune with their
[55:09] position they have the opportunity to
[55:12] change the circumstances when they need
[55:14] to be changed but if they get upset and
[55:17] they hold on to things and things are
[55:19] just being drug around and they just
[55:21] can't let go of stuff and they have
[55:23] anger and frustration and maybe fear and
[55:26] anxiety about their husbands
[55:29] they're not in their position but when
[55:31] they can just go on their knees and say
[55:33] Lord I don't know what's going on I
[55:34] don't like what's going on I don't trust
[55:36] what's going on but I know you have it
[55:38] all under control Lord I know you can
[55:40] change the circumstances because you're
[55:42] God and you're the present tense I am
[55:44] you are a God of this present time
[55:46] you're not the god of the future even
[55:48] though you are you're not the god of the
[55:49] past even though you are and I don't
[55:51] want to know you that way I want to know
[55:52] you of the god right now in my life I
[55:55] need to see you move in my family I need
[55:58] to see you move in my marriage I need to
[56:00] see you move in my children
[56:02] I believe the wives have the opportunity
[56:04] according to the word here to change the
[56:07] circumstances to change the situation
[56:10] but the wives have got to be in
[56:12] subjection to their own husbands they
[56:14] have to
[56:17] and it's interesting because the
[56:18] husbands they need to love their wives
[56:21] have to and you know they don't have to
[56:24] and say well I've got I've got to love
[56:26] you so I just love you I only because I
[56:29] love you I just love you so what does
[56:31] that mean to a wife a wife's gonna say
[56:33] yeah right I I believe it the word says
[56:35] that you have to love me so I get that
[56:38] you love me yeah but when a husband says
[56:40] you know honey like we've read those
[56:42] quotes earlier on in in this study and
[56:44] and you just take your wife by the hand
[56:46] and you look at her and you tell her
[56:48] honey I love you I truly love you you're
[56:51] my sweetheart and many times I might
[56:53] have upset you and done things to to
[56:55] actually make you feel bad and maybe
[56:57] I've let you down and maybe things have
[56:59] happened but I truly love you with all
[57:01] my heart you're my wife you're my
[57:03] sweetheart I just want to spend the rest
[57:05] of my life with you when you do that
[57:07] when you take her up into your arms and
[57:09] you make a little love to her brother
[57:10] Branham says you put your arm around her
[57:12] and you show her affection then you're
[57:14] actually living the love
[57:17] but when you just say I just love you
[57:19] because the word says I have to I have
[57:22] to
[57:23] doesn't mean anything does it she's
[57:25] going to say whatever buddy
[57:28] whatever I don't believe you and the
[57:31] circle will just go it'll just be like
[57:33] running on a hamster will anybody have a
[57:34] hamster anybody ever see a hamster wheel
[57:37] a hamster will just run Miles and Miles
[57:39] they say that hamsters folk run miles in
[57:42] a night literally miles in a night if
[57:44] they could but that's what happens
[57:45] brothers and sisters when we get in that
[57:47] circumstance that situation will be just
[57:48] like a hamster and it'll slowly go up a
[57:50] little bit on the wheel and it'll go
[57:51] back down but it'll just be running with
[57:53] all of its might on this wheel and and
[57:55] if we're not actually following the word
[57:57] subjecting ourselves one to another in
[57:59] the fear of God if we're not starting
[58:01] there then how is it going to work
[58:05] you know we talked about uh we talked
[58:09] about First Corinthians chapter 13. and
[58:12] I just think it's so beautiful because I
[58:14] said it before and I I'll say it again I
[58:17] think it was just under inspiration that
[58:18] I said it before but I believe that
[58:20] that's like a barometer a spiritual
[58:22] barometer for our lives if we want to
[58:24] see whether we're actually living our
[58:27] Our Lives according to a Christian Life
[58:30] uh I mean we know that the word
[58:32] Christian means Christ like right that's
[58:35] what a Christian Life is it's being
[58:37] christ-like it's not being foolish and
[58:40] it's it's not being rude and it's not
[58:42] being hurtful and it's not being
[58:44] vindictive it's not remembering the past
[58:47] it's it's being forgiving and loving we
[58:50] know that it's it's all of that but in
[58:53] in in in in in First Corinthians chapter
[58:55] 13 if we don't have charity
[58:58] it's for naught and what is Charity
[59:01] brothers and sisters we know that
[59:02] Strong's is g26 agape brother Branham
[59:06] brought that and uh just the definition
[59:08] of it is love that is affection or
[59:10] benevolence it's something that we do
[59:12] it's a affection it's it's something
[59:15] that we express and tonight we did that
[59:17] in song and and worship and we express
[59:21] that and Agape is is God's love that's
[59:24] giving the love that's beyond what we
[59:27] have as humans a filio love and filial
[59:31] love is just the feelings that we have
[59:33] it's it's the love that we feel in our
[59:36] our souls but it's still not agape love
[59:40] but charity
[59:41] charity thinking about charity and and
[59:44] you know brother Branham he brought the
[59:46] difference and and made it so clear
[59:48] which is so nice but when we get into
[59:50] agape love agape love is something that
[59:54] we can't even comprehend with our minds
[59:56] our human finite Minds we just can't
[59:59] even really comprehend that and like I
[1:00:01] said before husbands when we look at it
[1:00:04] and and you hear some folks talk about
[1:00:06] it uh about you know divorce and whether
[1:00:09] you can marry again and and all of this
[1:00:11] stuff the Liberty is there those are
[1:00:14] spirits that want to get into the church
[1:00:16] and defile it and make it lukewarm
[1:00:18] formal and Powerless you know if we look
[1:00:21] at that think about it how on Earth
[1:00:23] could we ever make it to Heaven if God
[1:00:26] would look at us we said it earlier in
[1:00:27] the service I just feel so impressed to
[1:00:29] talk about it though how could we ever
[1:00:31] make it to Heaven if God actually
[1:00:32] behaved that way towards us as his bride
[1:00:35] we give him so many occasions to put us
[1:00:37] away
[1:00:38] Heaven Help Us
[1:00:41] but he has a love for us that we can't
[1:00:43] even comprehend
[1:00:45] and remember the word says that we're
[1:00:47] supposed to love our wives like Christ
[1:00:49] loved the church
[1:00:51] there should be no occasion none
[1:00:56] brother even says it you know if my wife
[1:00:58] were to
[1:00:59] do something or if I were to do
[1:01:01] something we would just take each other
[1:01:03] back but I wouldn't do it for the world
[1:01:05] I wouldn't want to hurt her
[1:01:08] I wouldn't do it for the world because I
[1:01:10] wouldn't want to hurt her because I love
[1:01:11] her that much
[1:01:14] but you know talking about charity we
[1:01:17] can talk about charity and and say that
[1:01:19] it's love because we know it's love but
[1:01:21] I believe it goes even further than that
[1:01:23] and and I know that we all do agree with
[1:01:25] that too charity is is Christ it's it's
[1:01:29] himself the the person of Jesus Christ
[1:01:32] Living out through our lives so if we
[1:01:35] don't have you know when we read this
[1:01:36] let's maybe turn over there just just
[1:01:39] for the sake of
[1:01:40] discussion tonight
[1:01:42] First Corinthians chapter 13.
[1:01:46] just look at maybe the the first four
[1:01:49] verses
[1:01:51] first first Corinthians chapter 13
[1:01:54] though I speak with the tongues of men
[1:01:56] and angels and have not Christ
[1:02:00] I am become as a sounding brass or a
[1:02:02] tinkling symbol and and though I have
[1:02:05] the gift of Prophecy and understand all
[1:02:07] Mysteries and all knowledge
[1:02:09] and though I have all Faith so that I
[1:02:12] could remove mountains and have not
[1:02:14] Christ
[1:02:16] I am nothing
[1:02:19] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[1:02:21] the poor and though I give my body to be
[1:02:24] burned
[1:02:25] and have not Christ
[1:02:28] it prophetth me nothing
[1:02:31] I think it's just such a wonderful
[1:02:33] perspective to look at that way because
[1:02:36] sometimes I think this can be read and
[1:02:39] and construed and maybe an intangible
[1:02:42] way where it can be sort of out there as
[1:02:45] Charity while I don't have the chair
[1:02:47] I've got charity I've got lots of
[1:02:49] Charity I've got my charitable donations
[1:02:51] I give to the poor I I I give things
[1:02:54] away to the to the people that need it I
[1:02:57] do all these things I I serve in the
[1:02:59] church and I I've I've done all these
[1:03:02] different things in my life that people
[1:03:04] don't even know about the right hand
[1:03:05] doesn't know what the left hand is doing
[1:03:07] according to the word and that's
[1:03:09] fantastic but do you have Christ in your
[1:03:12] life you have to have the Holy Ghost in
[1:03:14] your life if you don't have the Holy
[1:03:16] Ghost in your life it's all for nothing
[1:03:19] honestly we would be better off to keep
[1:03:21] it all and enjoy it and eat and drink
[1:03:24] today for tomorrow we die which is what
[1:03:27] the rest of the world does
[1:03:29] but we want to know that that charity is
[1:03:31] not just a charitable organization that
[1:03:34] we're a part of and it's not just me
[1:03:36] dealing with a filial love and and just
[1:03:40] being kind and loving to other human
[1:03:42] beings on Earth it's it's having that
[1:03:44] charity the Holy Ghost himself Jesus
[1:03:47] Christ the person living out through me
[1:03:50] in my life
[1:03:52] I read this before and I think I'll read
[1:03:53] it again but just the the first actually
[1:03:56] three verses tonight
[1:04:00] out of the Amplified Bible
[1:04:02] our spiritual barometer not the
[1:04:04] Amplified Bible but just just First
[1:04:06] Corinthians chapter 13 here this
[1:04:09] um
[1:04:09] you know it says in verse one if I can
[1:04:11] speak in the tongues of men and even of
[1:04:14] angels
[1:04:15] but have not love that reasoning
[1:04:18] intentional spiritual devotions such as
[1:04:21] is inspired by God's love for and in us
[1:04:25] I am only a noisy gong or a clanging
[1:04:28] symbol
[1:04:30] I just want to say this if I don't have
[1:04:32] the Holy Ghost and I I have all of that
[1:04:34] in my life then then it's just for
[1:04:36] nothing
[1:04:38] verse two and if I have a prophetic if I
[1:04:41] have prophetic powers
[1:04:43] the gift of interpreting the Divine will
[1:04:46] and purpose
[1:04:47] just understand all the Mysteries we've
[1:04:49] been given all the Mysteries all the
[1:04:50] Loose Ends from all the ages have been
[1:04:52] tied up in our day we've been given all
[1:04:54] the prophetic powers on a silver platter
[1:04:56] to this age and if I have the prophetic
[1:04:59] powers and the gift of interpreting the
[1:05:01] Divine will and purpose and understand
[1:05:03] all the secret truths and Mysteries
[1:05:06] and possess all knowledge
[1:05:09] and if I have sufficient Faith so that I
[1:05:11] can remove mountains and have not love
[1:05:15] God's love in me
[1:05:18] what is God's love in me
[1:05:20] it's the Holy Ghost
[1:05:22] it's the Holy Spirit the Seal of promise
[1:05:25] if I have not God's love in me I am
[1:05:28] nothing I useless nobody
[1:05:31] and I would say that we really truly are
[1:05:33] useless nobody if we don't have the Holy
[1:05:36] Ghost In Our Lives if we don't know that
[1:05:38] we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we
[1:05:40] truly are
[1:05:41] we need to make sure and I don't mean
[1:05:43] that if we don't know if we have the
[1:05:44] Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and
[1:05:45] sisters we're all on a journey I'm not
[1:05:47] trying to come down or throw off on
[1:05:49] anyone I'm trying to encourage us to get
[1:05:51] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to know that
[1:05:54] we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to
[1:05:55] recognize that this charity that we
[1:05:57] speak about here is the Holy Ghost in
[1:05:59] our lives and with the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:06:01] Lives we're going to fulfill be able to
[1:06:03] fulfill those roles that are set out for
[1:06:05] us in the scriptures that we read
[1:06:07] earlier tonight in in Ephesians and in
[1:06:10] Peter and in Colossians
[1:06:13] when we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:06:15] we're going to be able to fulfill those
[1:06:16] rules
[1:06:17] even if I Dole out all that I have to
[1:06:20] the poor providing food and if I
[1:06:21] Surrender my body to be burned or in
[1:06:24] order that I may Glory but have not love
[1:06:27] God's love in me I gain nothing
[1:06:31] brother Branham he talks about charity
[1:06:33] and and in a few places in the message
[1:06:35] he says and but you see the greatest of
[1:06:40] these is charity is love
[1:06:43] like brother Leo expressed this morning
[1:06:45] love where there is tongues that shall
[1:06:47] cease where there's prophecies it shall
[1:06:49] fail but when charity which is love it
[1:06:53] will always endure see
[1:06:55] and we know that's further on in the
[1:06:57] scripture we just haven't read that
[1:06:58] tonight for time's sake I think there is
[1:07:01] nothing greater than love
[1:07:03] and love if we can't express it now we
[1:07:07] can say that we have love
[1:07:09] we're just saying that
[1:07:11] but when we can really Express what
[1:07:13] we've said that we have
[1:07:16] then we show it in ourselves
[1:07:21] now we're not a perfect people
[1:07:24] we make our mistakes
[1:07:27] we do things that's wrong
[1:07:30] but you see love covers all of that
[1:07:35] we're willing when we see our mistakes
[1:07:38] to come back and apologize to one
[1:07:40] another
[1:07:42] brother Bradham speaking here he says
[1:07:44] yeah that's Warriors
[1:07:46] that's really men and women that's
[1:07:49] Gallant
[1:07:50] and you know brothers and sisters this
[1:07:52] is Brother Barry gonna throw this in
[1:07:54] here now I'm gonna say this when
[1:07:56] somebody does have the ability because
[1:07:58] of God's love in our lives to come and
[1:08:01] apologize and and try and make a wrong
[1:08:03] right
[1:08:04] the other side of the coin is the
[1:08:07] believer with love and charity in their
[1:08:09] life is going to say Amen to that
[1:08:11] they're going to say it's okay
[1:08:14] I might not be happy right now but by
[1:08:17] God's grace we'll get over it and we'll
[1:08:19] go forwards together we'll be able to
[1:08:21] move forwards as Believers because we're
[1:08:24] all going to wind up in the same place
[1:08:25] there isn't going to be a different
[1:08:27] department for for one church or the
[1:08:29] other church or one group or the other
[1:08:31] group it's all of us have been baptized
[1:08:34] into one body by one Spirit one body
[1:08:37] baptized into Christ Jesus
[1:08:40] brother random says now we're not a
[1:08:42] perfect people we make our mistakes we
[1:08:43] all we do things that's wrong but you
[1:08:46] see love covers all of that we're
[1:08:47] willing when we see our mistakes to come
[1:08:49] back and apologize to one another yeah
[1:08:51] that's real Warriors that's really men
[1:08:54] and women that's gallant and any man can
[1:08:56] go out to the battlefield that's got
[1:08:58] nerve enough to walk out there but when
[1:09:00] he gets knocked down then get up and try
[1:09:03] again see there used to be a song that
[1:09:05] the young young man and woman used to
[1:09:07] sing in the church if I fall if I fail
[1:09:09] see if I fall I forget how it goes let
[1:09:12] me rise and try again
[1:09:14] this is out of the power of
[1:09:16] transformation in 1965. I just think
[1:09:20] it's wonderful to look at that and see
[1:09:22] you know what's the life being lived
[1:09:24] it's that that life of Charity in our
[1:09:26] lives the Holy Ghost living out through
[1:09:29] us we've said it many times that talk
[1:09:31] talk is cheap and our children as
[1:09:33] parents can see it when when we just
[1:09:35] tell our children just just do as I say
[1:09:37] not as I do just just follow the word
[1:09:40] just just take our children and and send
[1:09:42] them to Sunday school but brother
[1:09:44] Bradham says don't just send them to
[1:09:45] Sunday school bring them to Sunday
[1:09:47] school come and sit down as parents and
[1:09:50] learn as well
[1:09:52] you know this this this this we're
[1:09:54] talking about tonight is is of the
[1:09:56] common salvation we're we're talking
[1:09:58] about being being saved Justified
[1:10:01] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost in
[1:10:03] our lives and and and that was the only
[1:10:05] way that we're ever going to be able to
[1:10:08] succeed according to the scriptures that
[1:10:10] we've read as a husband and as a wife
[1:10:13] and as a child it's the only way
[1:10:16] and what we're talking about here is is
[1:10:18] that you know
[1:10:20] it's not just what we say it's what we
[1:10:22] do right it's the life that we live
[1:10:25] we can say it all we want
[1:10:28] but our lives speak volumes brother
[1:10:30] Bradham says that our thoughts
[1:10:33] are louder in heaven
[1:10:36] than our words are
[1:10:38] how much more Our Lives brother Branham
[1:10:40] says that we can talk all we want but we
[1:10:42] speak a sermon we preach a sermon by the
[1:10:44] life that we live
[1:10:45] and what kind of lives are we living
[1:10:47] what kind you know we can say it I I
[1:10:49] just want to really emphasize and drive
[1:10:51] it home tonight we can say it about when
[1:10:54] we live our lives when we go to work and
[1:10:55] we go to school and we do all the things
[1:10:57] outside of our homes but tonight I want
[1:10:59] to drill down about our homes because
[1:11:01] what's happening behind closed doors is
[1:11:04] what counts because really when we live
[1:11:06] our lives behind closed doors that's who
[1:11:09] we really are when we're alone when it's
[1:11:11] just a husband and a wife when it's just
[1:11:13] a family unit the the children our
[1:11:16] children seeing the congruent message
[1:11:18] that they see our parents as well we're
[1:11:20] at church are we the same parents when
[1:11:22] we're at home are we the same parents
[1:11:24] when we're under pressure in different
[1:11:26] situations or do we just flip and the
[1:11:28] switch goes off and we're just a
[1:11:30] different person all together
[1:11:32] was Christ different
[1:11:35] remember Christian means christ-like
[1:11:38] being like Christ
[1:11:40] there's times where Christ got upset but
[1:11:43] not very many
[1:11:45] and usually it was with the most
[1:11:47] religious people
[1:11:49] it wasn't with his family
[1:11:51] I don't think he ever yelled back talked
[1:11:53] back to his mom and dad did he and and
[1:11:55] you know it's interesting to think I
[1:11:58] don't think his parents ever really
[1:11:59] mistreated him did they
[1:12:02] we need to make sure that we understand
[1:12:04] that as as as husbands we need to make
[1:12:07] sure that we're treating our wives
[1:12:08] correctly we're treating them nicely
[1:12:10] brother Branham says she's your
[1:12:11] sweetheart
[1:12:12] treated nicely and if you mistreat her
[1:12:15] you're not mistreating her you're
[1:12:17] mistreating yourself and I would go so
[1:12:20] far as to say this Brothers if we're
[1:12:22] mistreating our wives what we're doing
[1:12:24] is we're mistreating God because if your
[1:12:27] wife has the Holy Ghost who are you
[1:12:29] actually mistreating
[1:12:31] and wives if you're actually not
[1:12:34] submitting to your husbands who are you
[1:12:37] not submitting to if he's got the Holy
[1:12:39] Ghost
[1:12:40] but I'm sure that could be contested
[1:12:42] sometimes in our lives we'd say well
[1:12:44] maybe that husband doesn't have the Holy
[1:12:45] Ghost maybe zipporah says that about her
[1:12:47] husband
[1:12:49] he never had the Holy Ghost I had to
[1:12:51] intervene I had to step in and clean
[1:12:52] things up so that he didn't get killed
[1:12:54] but isn't that what it's about being a
[1:12:56] family
[1:12:57] we we want to actually help one another
[1:12:59] we want to see one another succeed we
[1:13:01] don't want to throw off on one another
[1:13:03] we don't want to mistreat one another
[1:13:09] I hope it's okay I'm not going too far
[1:13:12] salvation is of the Lord brothers and
[1:13:14] sisters
[1:13:15] out of the Ephesian Church age
[1:13:18] brother proud of says and the reason I'm
[1:13:20] saying it that way is it's not something
[1:13:21] that we do we don't just go and get
[1:13:24] salvation we can't just go and buy it we
[1:13:26] can't just tie their way into it we
[1:13:28] can't just do Penance like the the
[1:13:32] like the most religious I wanted to say
[1:13:34] the heathens but that's just rude
[1:13:37] salvation is of the Lord out of the
[1:13:38] Ephesian Church age brother random says
[1:13:40] now you'll notice that Jesus is walking
[1:13:42] alone in the midst of his churches and
[1:13:45] he's talking out of the Book of
[1:13:46] Revelation here the the Ephesian Church
[1:13:48] Age and and what the spirit says to the
[1:13:50] Ephesians in the Ephesian Church age
[1:13:53] and we know that Paul is the messenger
[1:13:55] to the Ephesian Church age he says now
[1:13:57] you'll notice that Jesus is walking
[1:13:58] alone in the midst of his churches there
[1:14:00] is no one else with him neither indeed
[1:14:03] can there be for he alone wrought her
[1:14:06] salvation and having purchased her with
[1:14:10] his own blood he owns her
[1:14:13] isn't that beautiful to think that
[1:14:15] brothers and sisters we we were owned he
[1:14:18] owns us we are his inheritance and he
[1:14:20] won't lose one of his own
[1:14:24] neither indeed can there be for he alone
[1:14:27] Rod her salvation and having purchased
[1:14:29] her with his own blood he owns her he is
[1:14:33] her Lord and Master she gives him all
[1:14:37] the glory and that Glory he will not
[1:14:39] share with another
[1:14:42] to think about this now as the Bride of
[1:14:45] Jesus Christ
[1:14:47] he's pretty sure about the way he wants
[1:14:50] these words written there's no accident
[1:14:51] about this church age book and there's
[1:14:53] people that want to try and edit it and
[1:14:55] take some of this stuff out of it
[1:14:56] because it gives the the devil's Liberty
[1:14:59] to actually get into the church cause it
[1:15:01] to be lukewarm formal and Powerless but
[1:15:04] the true bride of Jesus Christ says Amen
[1:15:06] to this because we know that he bought
[1:15:08] her with his own blood and and the blood
[1:15:10] of Jesus Christ wasn't the blood of a
[1:15:12] man that was the blood of God because it
[1:15:14] was the the egg that was formed and the
[1:15:18] seed Gene of God formed in the womb it
[1:15:21] wasn't Mary and it wasn't Joseph it
[1:15:24] wasn't anything to do with mankind that
[1:15:27] was all Supernatural that happened there
[1:15:29] it was God in man
[1:15:32] he is her Lord and Master she gives him
[1:15:35] all the glory and that Glory he will not
[1:15:38] share with another there's no Pope with
[1:15:41] him there's no Archbishop with him Mary
[1:15:44] the mother of his Earthly body is not
[1:15:47] with him he does not speak and turn to a
[1:15:51] father for he is the father
[1:15:55] he does not turn to give orders to a
[1:15:58] holy spirit for he is God
[1:16:01] eternal spirit and it is his life that's
[1:16:04] flowing and pulsating in the church
[1:16:07] giving her life and without him there
[1:16:11] would be no life
[1:16:12] this is out of the church age book out
[1:16:15] of the seven Church ages the revelation
[1:16:16] of the seven Church ages the Ephesian
[1:16:19] Church age I think it's so wonderful to
[1:16:21] look at it this is his life that's
[1:16:23] pulsating through the church it's his
[1:16:26] life that gives the bride the ability to
[1:16:28] to surrender to submit unto him because
[1:16:32] honestly we need to be looking at this
[1:16:35] scripture like we've talked about many
[1:16:36] times the book of Ephesians chapter five
[1:16:39] we're all the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:41] aren't we
[1:16:43] we need to be looking at it as a wife to
[1:16:46] a husband to make sure that we're
[1:16:48] surrendering ourselves unto him because
[1:16:50] he's speaking of a mystery even though
[1:16:52] he's talking about you know the family
[1:16:54] order and everything needs to be in
[1:16:56] order and and the husbands need to love
[1:16:58] their wives and the wives need to
[1:16:59] reverence their husbands are we
[1:17:01] referencing our husband with everything
[1:17:03] that we do in word indeed
[1:17:08] the life of the church brothers and
[1:17:10] sisters is the life of Jesus Christ
[1:17:14] brother Brown goes on to say in the
[1:17:15] Ephesian Church age who walketh in the
[1:17:18] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:17:20] how meaningful are these words when
[1:17:23] viewed in the light of the scripture
[1:17:24] which describes him as Christ who is our
[1:17:29] life
[1:17:30] for Christ indeed is the life of the
[1:17:33] church
[1:17:36] Christ indeed is the life of the church
[1:17:39] charity
[1:17:40] Christ
[1:17:42] indeed is the life of the church
[1:17:45] he goes on to say she has no other life
[1:17:47] without him
[1:17:50] she is simply a religious Society a club
[1:17:53] a meaningless Gathering of the people
[1:17:57] it has to be Christ in our lives
[1:18:01] I I just think this is so powerful and
[1:18:04] forgive me for even saying it but this
[1:18:06] is the words of the Prophet it's
[1:18:07] important I believe for us to recognize
[1:18:09] that that this is what he said this is
[1:18:11] what God wanted to say to the people
[1:18:14] through the prophet and and we might be
[1:18:16] very familiar with this but if we're not
[1:18:18] I think it's important for us to get he
[1:18:20] says as a corpse
[1:18:22] Bejeweled and dressed is still a corpse
[1:18:25] so the church no matter what her
[1:18:28] programs and her gracious efforts might
[1:18:31] achieve without Christ
[1:18:33] she is a corpse also
[1:18:36] but with him and her
[1:18:38] in her midst with him motivating her she
[1:18:42] becomes to the wonderment of all
[1:18:47] I just think you can't deny this when
[1:18:49] you read this it just makes it so clear
[1:18:50] he says his body the fullness of him
[1:18:54] that filleth all in all
[1:18:57] many times we could look at that and say
[1:18:58] well he's talking about Christ the one
[1:19:00] that came and walked on Earth and and
[1:19:02] was here when the scriptures were
[1:19:03] written with the apostles and you know
[1:19:06] 2000 years ago but he's not talking
[1:19:08] about 2000 years ago he's talking about
[1:19:09] the bride body of Jesus Christ being the
[1:19:11] fullness of God
[1:19:13] right I'll just stop talking and I just
[1:19:16] want to read this he says as a corpse
[1:19:18] Bejeweled and dressed is still a corpse
[1:19:20] so the church no matter what her
[1:19:22] programs and her gracious efforts might
[1:19:24] achieve without Christ she is a corpse
[1:19:27] also but with him in her midst with him
[1:19:31] motivating her she becomes to the
[1:19:34] wonderment of all his body the fullness
[1:19:37] of him that filleth all in all and this
[1:19:40] very hour he is walking in the midst of
[1:19:43] the last ages golden Candlestick what he
[1:19:46] was as he walked in the first stage he
[1:19:50] is even now in this last stage Jesus
[1:19:53] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:19:55] forever
[1:19:56] Jesus Christ the fullness of the godhead
[1:20:00] bodily walking in his bride today
[1:20:04] how could we ever deny any of the word
[1:20:07] if we have his Spirit living in us if we
[1:20:09] have a spirit living in us then we're
[1:20:11] going to do exactly what his word says
[1:20:14] in every place and we're not going to
[1:20:16] make excuses for it
[1:20:19] what we'll do is maybe we'll have
[1:20:21] someone point it out to us or maybe
[1:20:22] we'll hear some preaching that will
[1:20:24] bring it to our attention or maybe we'll
[1:20:26] hear it in the message of the hour and
[1:20:28] what will happen when we have his spirit
[1:20:30] will actually reckon ourselves to the
[1:20:32] word and we'll do what brother Branham
[1:20:34] said if we need to go and talk to
[1:20:35] someone and say hey I'm sorry I I didn't
[1:20:38] realize it was this way then we'll just
[1:20:40] do that and the other person will say
[1:20:42] Amen praise the Lord we're Believers
[1:20:44] don't worry about it let's go forwards
[1:20:49] anyways I apologize
[1:20:52] for maybe getting a little too excited
[1:20:54] about it but it's just wonderful to see
[1:20:56] that it's his spirit that that we're not
[1:20:58] talking about actually just getting
[1:20:59] something intangible like the Holy Ghost
[1:21:01] and saying you know I've got it and and
[1:21:04] it's going to be okay everything is fine
[1:21:05] what what we're looking at for our day
[1:21:08] brothers and sisters I think is maybe
[1:21:09] the point that I want to try and get
[1:21:10] across tonight is we're talking about
[1:21:12] the fullness of Christ the word coming
[1:21:15] of the Lord he's not going to come in in
[1:21:18] this age the way that many people think
[1:21:20] he is where it's the cataclysmic events
[1:21:23] that are going to take place before the
[1:21:25] the coming of the Lord when the coming
[1:21:27] of the Lord comes he's going to meet us
[1:21:29] in the air we're going to meet with him
[1:21:31] in the air and the clouds and the dead
[1:21:33] in Christ will first rise and then we
[1:21:35] who which are alive and remain will go
[1:21:38] to meet them in the clouds together
[1:21:40] we're not going to see him on Earth it's
[1:21:43] not going to happen that way he's coming
[1:21:45] that way in Revelations 19 but we're
[1:21:47] coming with him and we're going to be
[1:21:49] riding horses does anybody here know how
[1:21:51] to ride a horse
[1:21:53] I don't know how to ride a horse but I
[1:21:55] think we're all gonna know it'll just be
[1:21:57] something that we're able to do
[1:21:59] sometimes you hear Brother Branham talk
[1:22:01] about it people will challenge that and
[1:22:02] say there's no animals in heaven but
[1:22:04] brother Branham said you know I I felt
[1:22:06] felt my horse
[1:22:07] nudge me from behind felt my dog lick my
[1:22:10] hand I I I Jesus comes riding on a horse
[1:22:14] and he's coming from somewhere you can't
[1:22:17] really question that that's what the
[1:22:19] word says
[1:22:21] but we're looking at it tonight brothers
[1:22:22] and sisters as being his body the
[1:22:25] fullness of him that filleth all in all
[1:22:27] and and you know I think in our day
[1:22:30] brothers and sisters if we make it
[1:22:31] anything less than that then we're
[1:22:33] actually taking the word and we're
[1:22:35] making it something else other than what
[1:22:38] it is for our day just like if somebody
[1:22:40] were to have said in Noah's day you know
[1:22:42] you could just make your own boat
[1:22:44] you could just get gopher wood we could
[1:22:46] just go and get together we've got some
[1:22:48] really good investors we we could go and
[1:22:50] get the exact same wood we could reverse
[1:22:52] engineer the the way that Moses built
[1:22:55] that Ark and we could build our own Ark
[1:22:56] and do it exactly the way that he's
[1:22:58] doing it and we'll just get by just fine
[1:23:00] and 125 years of doing that and maybe
[1:23:04] built a second Arc exactly like Noah's
[1:23:07] but there was only one Ark that God
[1:23:09] commissioned to be built not to right
[1:23:12] but many times if we take and and say
[1:23:15] that you know what the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:16] in our age is going to be anything
[1:23:18] different than the fullness of the
[1:23:21] godhead bodily in his bride
[1:23:24] then I believe we're making it something
[1:23:26] other than what the prophet brought for
[1:23:27] us
[1:23:29] just like in Moses in in Noah's day I
[1:23:32] hope I didn't say Moses earlier in
[1:23:34] Noah's day if we tried to build a
[1:23:36] different boat it wouldn't work
[1:23:38] maybe it would float for a little while
[1:23:39] but it just wouldn't work God wouldn't
[1:23:41] allow it
[1:23:43] remember we talked about it I just can't
[1:23:45] help but think tonight that song was
[1:23:46] anointed meet you in in there in in
[1:23:49] where that in thy house
[1:23:52] this is thy house this is your house
[1:23:55] Lord and it's not this building when we
[1:23:58] sing that song brothers and sisters
[1:23:59] we're not talking about that we're
[1:24:00] talking about that little Shack another
[1:24:02] example of kind of what we're talking
[1:24:03] about the the fullness of the godhead
[1:24:05] bodily in our day remember brother
[1:24:07] Branham said the angel of the Lord was
[1:24:09] standing with him and told him I'll meet
[1:24:11] you in there and brother Branham said
[1:24:14] that that that light went from where
[1:24:16] they were into that shed but he said the
[1:24:20] angel didn't move the angel stayed with
[1:24:22] him so there was something about that
[1:24:24] light something different about that
[1:24:26] light brother Branham says it in being
[1:24:27] led to the Holy Spirit 1956.
[1:24:30] run out of time here and just then now I
[1:24:33] want you to watch this and listen how it
[1:24:35] is now so you watch the difference then
[1:24:37] I heard something whipping around where
[1:24:39] where like that always goes and every
[1:24:42] time we have a healing service that's
[1:24:44] just what happens and the way it has
[1:24:46] always sounded sounded that way in the
[1:24:47] bush that time when I heard it it's
[1:24:49] always been that way and I felt it I
[1:24:52] heard it rather going moving and I
[1:24:53] looked and here went that real soft
[1:24:56] light moving away from me and went down
[1:24:58] and went into that little building then
[1:25:01] there's something different between that
[1:25:03] light and the angel
[1:25:05] because he was still here with me and
[1:25:08] the light had went into that building
[1:25:10] and this angel
[1:25:12] still speaking behind me which is a big
[1:25:14] man and he said I will meet you in there
[1:25:18] I just can't help but think brothers and
[1:25:20] sisters that in there is right here in
[1:25:23] the heart of the Sons and Daughters of
[1:25:25] God and the Believers that light that
[1:25:27] life Christ himself imparting himself to
[1:25:31] this age we know that we can look back
[1:25:33] to Calvary and say the spear was put in
[1:25:35] and blood and water spilled out on the
[1:25:37] ground and that blood cell was split at
[1:25:40] Calvary so that he could come back upon
[1:25:43] his many-membered body and he came back
[1:25:44] he did according to what he said go into
[1:25:47] Jerusalem and Terry ye there until you
[1:25:49] receive power from on high and when they
[1:25:52] did that the Holy Ghost came down and it
[1:25:54] was licks of fire right cloven tongues
[1:25:57] above their heads when the day of
[1:25:58] Pentecost was fully come and that
[1:26:01] rushing Mighty Wind that swept into the
[1:26:03] room I just can't help but think I could
[1:26:04] start preaching right now because when
[1:26:06] did that happen it was when they were
[1:26:07] all in one mind and one Accord brothers
[1:26:09] and sisters they weren't all pulling in
[1:26:11] different directions thinking different
[1:26:12] things I just think it's the same way
[1:26:15] for us today when we can recognize that
[1:26:17] he wants to have preeminence in a bride
[1:26:18] body one mind and one Accord recognize
[1:26:22] that we're accepting the fullness of the
[1:26:24] word the full manifestation the full
[1:26:27] power of the message of the hour
[1:26:29] brothers and sisters we're not looking
[1:26:30] at a at a at a measure of the message of
[1:26:33] the hour many times we could look at it
[1:26:34] and say well brother Branham said you
[1:26:36] could have a teaspoon of it you know
[1:26:37] what you could have an endless Fountain
[1:26:39] of it tonight if you want it all you've
[1:26:41] got to do is ask for it and he'll give
[1:26:43] it
[1:26:45] you know many times we can get scrupled
[1:26:47] up we can get tied up we can get mixed
[1:26:49] up we can get confused we can get down
[1:26:51] we can get oppressed and depressed with
[1:26:54] Devils they'll come around and try and
[1:26:55] make us feel depressed they do it on a
[1:26:58] regular basis brothers and sisters I'm
[1:27:00] an example of it I have felt so
[1:27:03] depressed I wanted to go and actually do
[1:27:05] something to myself and and I told the
[1:27:08] story one time about being out in
[1:27:09] Victoria it's awful when you get into
[1:27:11] that position but it's a devil that's
[1:27:13] just trying to get you and you know what
[1:27:15] it is I'll tell you what it is usually
[1:27:18] there's something wrong in your life and
[1:27:20] you got to go make that thing right and
[1:27:21] until you make that thing right God will
[1:27:23] say you can go down there and you can
[1:27:25] put some pressure on my son or my
[1:27:27] daughter because they need to get right
[1:27:29] and as long as you're going down the
[1:27:32] path and not making that thing right
[1:27:33] that thing's gonna bug you and bug you
[1:27:35] it's not always like that but I would
[1:27:37] say more often than not it probably is
[1:27:38] it was with me
[1:27:41] but you know there's a way back brother
[1:27:43] brought him in the Ephesian Church age
[1:27:44] he says it and what is the way back the
[1:27:47] way
[1:27:48] the way is the way of repentance
[1:27:52] that's the way back brothers and sisters
[1:27:54] all we need to do is repent
[1:27:57] we just need to repent he says if a
[1:27:59] sinner has to come to God by way of
[1:28:01] repentance
[1:28:02] this is beautiful because he speaks to
[1:28:05] the church here if a sinner has to come
[1:28:07] to God by the way of repentance then the
[1:28:11] lukewarm or backslider will have to
[1:28:14] repent that much more repent he says
[1:28:17] just repent that's all we got to do is
[1:28:19] repent but what keeps us from repenting
[1:28:22] brothers and sisters it's Pride
[1:28:24] it's Pride the original sin the one that
[1:28:27] started that battle that started in
[1:28:29] heaven that's being finished on Earth
[1:28:30] God chose a bride to actually be the one
[1:28:34] to be victorious to take that power away
[1:28:37] from Satan because when the bride goes
[1:28:39] up he comes down and you know what
[1:28:41] brothers and sisters it's never been
[1:28:42] closer we have never ever been so close
[1:28:45] to the countdown of the launching of the
[1:28:47] Bride of Jesus Christ someday she's
[1:28:49] going to go up someday we're going to
[1:28:51] start seeing the supernatural appearance
[1:28:53] of people in our lives and some people
[1:28:55] have said well you'll just see them and
[1:28:57] you won't talk to them and other people
[1:28:58] have said well you'll see them and
[1:28:59] you'll hear from them and they'll say
[1:29:01] take courage brother or sister because
[1:29:03] it's only moments away you know what I
[1:29:05] don't know if it matters all we need to
[1:29:07] do is make sure we got the token have
[1:29:09] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives because when
[1:29:11] that day comes and it's soon brothers
[1:29:13] and sisters it has to be soon doesn't
[1:29:15] that have to be soon oh my there's Wars
[1:29:18] there's rumors of wars Israel's in her
[1:29:20] Homeland the seventh angel messenger
[1:29:22] came and brought the message tied up all
[1:29:24] the loose has left the scene for 50 60
[1:29:27] years now where are we at
[1:29:30] we might not even make it home tonight
[1:29:31] wouldn't that be wonderful
[1:29:33] just cross right over into Glory every
[1:29:35] one of us as we go out those doors we go
[1:29:37] out those doors into eternity
[1:29:40] bye
[1:29:42] one of these days brothers and sisters
[1:29:44] Rapture is imminent many times people
[1:29:47] will look around and say oh atomic bombs
[1:29:49] are imminent you know what before they
[1:29:51] can go off before one bomb can go off
[1:29:53] our Prophet prophesied that the bride
[1:29:55] goes home before one of those bombs can
[1:29:57] go off
[1:30:00] brother Branham says here he says if a
[1:30:03] sinner has to come by the way of God has
[1:30:05] to come to God by way of repentance then
[1:30:07] lukewarm or the backslider will have to
[1:30:09] repent that much more repent bring forth
[1:30:12] fruits meat for repentance
[1:30:15] here's what brother Branham says prove
[1:30:17] it by your life
[1:30:18] if you do not repent said God I will
[1:30:21] remove your lampstand
[1:30:23] certainly a church in that condition
[1:30:25] can't give light to the world its light
[1:30:28] has turned to Darkness remember the
[1:30:30] story of the five wise and the five
[1:30:33] unwise virgins they're all virgins and
[1:30:35] they all had lamps so they all had oil
[1:30:37] and they all slept every one of them
[1:30:39] were sleeping right but the cry went
[1:30:42] forth which is the message of the hour
[1:30:43] the shout and the voice and the Trump
[1:30:47] that shout went forth behold the
[1:30:49] bridegroom cometh and that's already
[1:30:51] happened brothers and sisters that's
[1:30:53] already history in that story of the
[1:30:55] five wise enough five unwise and you
[1:30:57] know they all stood up and they all
[1:30:59] trimmed their lamps because they knew
[1:31:00] the bridegroom was coming but the only
[1:31:02] difference was one had oil and one
[1:31:04] didn't have oil and we just need to make
[1:31:06] sure we've got oil in our lamps so that
[1:31:08] we can keep it burning but you know
[1:31:10] brother Bradham says certainly a church
[1:31:11] in that condition can't give light to
[1:31:13] the world its light has turned to
[1:31:16] Darkness God will then take away its
[1:31:18] faithful messenger and its faithful
[1:31:20] Shepherds and leave them to themselves
[1:31:24] and they will go on talking about
[1:31:25] Christianity but will be bereft of it
[1:31:30] we're not worrying about that tonight
[1:31:32] but this is the age which we live in
[1:31:34] brothers and sisters even though this is
[1:31:36] the Ephesian Church age brother Adam's
[1:31:37] talking about the first church age the
[1:31:39] messenger Paul went to it this is very
[1:31:42] pertinent today the shout has gone
[1:31:44] forward we need to be rising and
[1:31:46] trimming our lamps and making sure that
[1:31:48] every time we have the opportunity that
[1:31:50] we can we're getting oil to put in that
[1:31:52] lamp because we're not going to be able
[1:31:54] to trim it so that we can get that lap
[1:31:56] burning bright and clear we need to be
[1:31:57] polishing and making sure that all the
[1:31:59] old carbon is out of it that we're not
[1:32:01] actually dimming out
[1:32:03] it's got to be the Life of Christ Living
[1:32:05] out through us the fullness of the
[1:32:07] godhead bodily and I know some people
[1:32:09] will choke at that to say brother Barry
[1:32:11] you're making yourself something and you
[1:32:13] know what truly if we have the life of
[1:32:15] Jesus Christ in us then then who are we
[1:32:17] who are we
[1:32:19] you know what the word says the message
[1:32:21] of the hour says that when the church
[1:32:23] recognizes what it is
[1:32:25] then the Rapture will go I just can't
[1:32:27] help stop
[1:32:28] can't stop talking about it brothers and
[1:32:31] sisters and we recognize who we are what
[1:32:33] we are then the Rapture will go
[1:32:36] misses Jesus Christ
[1:32:38] misses Jesus Christ when we can
[1:32:40] recognize that brothers and sisters in
[1:32:42] every single situation in our lives when
[1:32:44] we're dealing with our husbands when
[1:32:45] we're dealing with our wives when we're
[1:32:47] dealing with our children when we're
[1:32:48] dealing with our children's teachers
[1:32:50] when we're dealing with our bosses when
[1:32:51] we're dealing with our neighbors when
[1:32:53] we're dealing with the people that cut
[1:32:54] in front of us at Tim Hortons when the
[1:32:56] people get mad at us because we cut them
[1:32:58] off on the road all of these situations
[1:33:00] in our lives misses Jesus Christ we have
[1:33:03] the opportunity to bestow Grace to this
[1:33:06] world to shine the light of Jesus Christ
[1:33:08] the literal life of Jesus Christ to the
[1:33:11] people around us
[1:33:12] or we can get caught up in the humanity
[1:33:15] of our lives and actually
[1:33:18] maybe not do that
[1:33:20] it's got to be the Life of Christ Living
[1:33:21] out through Us and how do we get into
[1:33:23] Christ brothers and sisters or how does
[1:33:25] Christ get into US is probably the more
[1:33:28] pertinent question it's by one Spirit
[1:33:30] one spirit that we're all baptized into
[1:33:33] one body not two bodies not three bodies
[1:33:35] not a whole bunch of different Church
[1:33:37] bodies one body one body we're all
[1:33:40] baptized
[1:33:42] it's the holy ghost in the man brothers
[1:33:44] and sisters I'll call them musicians now
[1:33:46] he says in hear ye him and as he goes up
[1:33:50] to the Mount called Mount Carm Mount
[1:33:53] Transfiguration sorry it must have been
[1:33:55] a wonderful place
[1:33:57] Mount Transfiguration Peter later
[1:34:00] regarded it as a holy Mount he said he
[1:34:03] was in
[1:34:04] now that doesn't mean the mountain was
[1:34:06] holy it meant the holy God was on the
[1:34:09] mountain
[1:34:11] but the Branham says this in this
[1:34:12] message oh I wish I could get that to
[1:34:15] you
[1:34:17] it's not the holy church
[1:34:20] it's the holy spirit in the church
[1:34:23] what makes it what it is
[1:34:25] it isn't the holy man
[1:34:27] it's the holy ghost in the man makes him
[1:34:30] what he is
[1:34:32] it's not it's not the holy wife
[1:34:35] that makes her who she is it's not the
[1:34:38] holy husband or the holy Child it's the
[1:34:40] holy ghost in the husband it's the holy
[1:34:43] ghost in the wife
[1:34:45] and you know what I would say this even
[1:34:47] it's the holy ghost in the child
[1:34:50] brother Branham he talks about it when
[1:34:52] should you baptize your child and he
[1:34:55] says just as soon as you can as soon as
[1:34:58] they want to get baptized you should be
[1:35:00] doing it you wouldn't want to he says it
[1:35:02] you wouldn't and this is just me
[1:35:04] paraphrasing it but you wouldn't want to
[1:35:06] actually not baptize them when they want
[1:35:08] to get baptized
[1:35:10] and then actually have something happen
[1:35:12] to them because he says that your blood
[1:35:14] their blood actually will be upon you if
[1:35:17] you don't actually let them get baptized
[1:35:21] children are smart
[1:35:23] they want to get baptized for a purpose
[1:35:26] sometimes maybe they want to do it
[1:35:27] because it looks fun
[1:35:29] and exciting but other times when all
[1:35:32] they hear about is getting baptized in
[1:35:34] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:35:36] their mission of your sins after you
[1:35:37] repent so that you can get the baptism
[1:35:39] of the holy spirit for yourself
[1:35:41] when they hear that over and over again
[1:35:42] and they say Mommy Daddy I want to get
[1:35:44] baptized there's a purpose for it
[1:35:48] but if they hear that over and over and
[1:35:50] over again and they never act upon it
[1:35:54] what good is it
[1:35:56] a parent can only be the Holy Ghost for
[1:35:58] a child so long
[1:36:00] and then you know what happens if that
[1:36:02] child doesn't actually mature into the
[1:36:04] word if that word doesn't get into that
[1:36:07] child to the place where they take
[1:36:09] action then what happens is the world
[1:36:11] will get them and I can assure you
[1:36:13] brothers and sisters the world is empty
[1:36:15] the world is cruel the world is terrible
[1:36:19] the world has no remorse and what
[1:36:22] happens in the end is between God and
[1:36:24] the individual but when children want to
[1:36:27] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:36:28] Jesus Christ for their mission of their
[1:36:30] sins we need to make sure that we do
[1:36:31] that
[1:36:32] we meet give them the opportunity
[1:36:35] maybe stand with me tonight as we close
[1:36:39] submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:36:41] the fear of God
[1:36:42] husbands
[1:36:44] love your wives wives submit yourselves
[1:36:46] unto your husband's children obey your
[1:36:48] parents because you know when you do
[1:36:51] those things you're actually obeying the
[1:36:53] word of God
[1:36:55] and you're actually submitting
[1:36:57] yourselves to God brother Branham says
[1:37:00] it clearly that wives when you do that
[1:37:01] the way you serve your husband is how
[1:37:03] you serve God
[1:37:04] and I would say this husbands the way
[1:37:07] you treat your wife is is the way maybe
[1:37:10] you want God to treat you
[1:37:13] if you I I I'm just going to stop there
[1:37:16] I just can't help but think that to me
[1:37:19] is staggering because I have mistreated
[1:37:20] my wife sometimes I know it
[1:37:23] and I wouldn't want God to treat me that
[1:37:25] way
[1:37:27] let's just bow in prayer
[1:37:28] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[1:37:30] love you tonight we love you with all of
[1:37:33] our hearts Lord and father we pray that
[1:37:35] Lord you would just forgive us for any
[1:37:37] transgressions Lord that you would
[1:37:39] forgive us for any sins in our lives
[1:37:41] Lord father any iniquity we pray that
[1:37:43] you would just take it out of the way
[1:37:45] for us father and Lord if there's
[1:37:47] anything undone in our lives Lord that
[1:37:49] you would maybe just bring it to our our
[1:37:52] our Consciousness father that we could
[1:37:54] just make it right father Lord that we
[1:37:56] wouldn't want to make ourselves make it
[1:37:59] all about ourselves Lord Jesus we know
[1:38:01] that we live in a narcissistic age
[1:38:03] father we pray that Lord we would just
[1:38:05] simply make it all about you father if
[1:38:08] we could do that Lord Jesus I believe
[1:38:10] that many of the troubles in our lives
[1:38:12] would change we would have the
[1:38:14] perspective father that you could Lord
[1:38:16] do everything for us Lord and do
[1:38:19] everything for us not just for us but
[1:38:21] through US Lord Jesus father we pray
[1:38:24] that as we read about in the in the
[1:38:26] quotes tonight father that we could just
[1:38:28] be that light to the this world
[1:38:30] and the only way we could ever do that
[1:38:32] is to have your life in US father Lord I
[1:38:34] pray that you would help the children to
[1:38:36] obey their parents Lord Jesus because we
[1:38:39] know that's pleasing unto you father we
[1:38:41] know that as the children obey their
[1:38:43] parents they're obeying you father
[1:38:45] Lord Jesus and when the children disobey
[1:38:48] the parents they're disobeying you and
[1:38:51] father when the wives don't submit to
[1:38:53] their husbands they're not submitting
[1:38:55] unto you and when the husbands don't
[1:38:57] love their wives and they get bitter
[1:38:59] against them Father they're not not not
[1:39:01] getting bitter against anything other
[1:39:03] than themselves Lord Jesus father we
[1:39:06] don't want to see ourselves as husbands
[1:39:09] to be treated that way by you father so
[1:39:11] Lord we pray that you would just give us
[1:39:13] the strength Lord Jesus to Humble
[1:39:15] ourselves in the sight of the Lord
[1:39:17] father that you would lift us up Lord
[1:39:19] Jesus that you would give us the ability
[1:39:21] to live this word that we talk about
[1:39:23] father we just love you and we thank you
[1:39:25] we ask that you would bless each one
[1:39:27] tonight father go with us as we go our
[1:39:29] separate ways pray that you would just
[1:39:31] keep your hand upon us father be with
[1:39:33] those who couldn't be here tonight for
[1:39:35] whatever reason wherever they are father
[1:39:37] we pray that you would just strengthen
[1:39:39] them encourage them be with those who
[1:39:40] are maybe online father maybe those who
[1:39:43] listen to this afterwards father either
[1:39:45] way we just love you and we thank you we
[1:39:48] ask all these things now in Jesus
[1:39:49] Christ's name we pray
[1:39:51] amen
