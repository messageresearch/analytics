[0:00] really excited about the subject this
[0:02] morning and continuing we're going to be
[0:04] reading John 3 16 here just in a moment
[0:06] but part two of for God so loved as I
[0:09] mentioned last time I think was last
[0:10] Sunday we said this is a setup and I
[0:12] think you should probably be
[0:13] anticipating that the it's just going to
[0:14] keep building and this is foundation for
[0:17] going into what I'd like to look at and
[0:19] I may end up looking at it sooner than I
[0:20] thought I would on the restoration of
[0:22] the first love and also love secrets
[0:25] that are being made manifest and
[0:27] revealed to us in these last days I
[0:28] think these things kind of all build to
[0:30] the thought of the Capstone which is
[0:31] charity and the revelation of Jesus
[0:34] Christ in this hour so if you look at
[0:36] John chapter 3 verse 16 it says for God
[0:38] so loved the world that he gave his only
[0:41] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[0:43] him should not perish but have
[0:45] everlasting life I believe we took this
[0:47] and broke it down in different ways last
[0:49] Sunday but we looked at how that God is
[0:50] the lover and the world is the loved so
[0:53] we talk about the lover that's God when
[0:55] we talk about the loved that is the
[0:57] world
[0:58] and say it now and this is going to be
[1:01] repeated over and over again that's a
[1:02] particular world not just the world
[1:04] we're thinking about
[1:05] and so in this it says for God so loved
[1:08] the world so the lover loved the loved
[1:10] that he gave so the lover is the giver
[1:12] and here it says he's a giver of his
[1:14] only begotten son in order to give
[1:17] eternal life and therefore the love is
[1:19] the receiver and it receives that son to
[1:22] live eternally and we saw that how the
[1:24] lover is eternal the love is eternal and
[1:27] the loved is eternal so we we see that
[1:30] hatred has an end because the object of
[1:31] hatred will will be gone but for the the
[1:34] loved of God that God who loves is
[1:37] eternal the love is eternal and
[1:39] therefore the loved is eternal and so
[1:41] this love because everything is have it
[1:44] has an eternal quality the love is a
[1:47] redeeming love
[1:48] it's not a condemning love it's not a
[1:50] love that finally says all right that's
[1:51] it I'm done uh we're finished here it's
[1:54] over but it's a love that's always
[1:55] seeking to recover always seeking to
[1:57] renew it's a redeeming love
[1:59] and we looked at it from the standpoint
[2:01] I'm trying to remember just exactly
[2:03] where we were in the scripture and we
[2:04] saw that perfect love removes every
[2:07] barrier between the lover and beloved
[2:10] and so if there's something between the
[2:12] lover and the loved uh love wants to
[2:14] remove that perfect love wants to remove
[2:15] that obstruction God was not satisfied
[2:18] looking at a Chasm between you and him
[2:21] and said you know what I'll put up with
[2:22] sacrifices and I'll I'll take their
[2:25] burnt offerings and I'll watch them
[2:27] through their cycles of repentance and
[2:29] sin God was not satisfied for that God
[2:31] wanted to close that Gap he wanted to
[2:33] remove the barrier and that's what
[2:35] perfect love does is if there's ever any
[2:37] disagreement if there's ever any
[2:38] disharmony if there's ever any hate
[2:40] perfect love wants to remove that
[2:43] and as we look at for God so loved the
[2:45] world and we're looking at the loved
[2:46] world the believer you individually as a
[2:49] Believer you are a part of the mystery
[2:51] of the loved world and so we talk about
[2:53] the loved world or the world that God
[2:55] loved we're looking at two different
[2:56] worlds when it comes to The Condemned
[2:58] and the redeemed you have the loved
[3:00] world the redeemed world and you also
[3:02] have The Condemned world of the world of
[3:03] hate the world of the ungodly
[3:05] and a second Thessalonians chapter 2
[3:08] verses 10 to 13 and it's speaking of the
[3:12] Antichrist the wicked one
[3:14] I'm gonna take a deep breath and a sip
[3:16] of water and just slow down
[3:20] I didn't even have a Red Bull or
[3:21] anything this morning and I just feel so
[3:23] amped up
[3:25] I need to put on a football helmet and
[3:27] run into a wall or something right now
[3:29] just to kind of get some of this energy
[3:31] out
[3:32] or maybe forego the football helmet just
[3:34] do it
[3:36] it says and with all speaking of the
[3:38] Antichrist and with all deceivableness
[3:39] of unrighteousness and them that perish
[3:41] so now you have them that perish because
[3:43] they receive not the love of the truth
[3:45] that they might be saved look at what's
[3:46] at the heart of Salvation love the love
[3:49] of the truth they didn't receive it so
[3:51] it's something that was going to be
[3:52] given and for this cause shall God send
[3:54] them delusion that they should believe a
[3:56] lie now just think of this if you don't
[3:58] love truth and and you're you're being
[4:01] deceived by all sorts of unrighteousness
[4:03] and you're you're doomed to perish and
[4:06] then God sees that and guess what he
[4:07] does
[4:08] send strong delusion
[4:10] he compounds it he says and he sends God
[4:12] shall send them strong delusion they
[4:14] should believe a lie that they all might
[4:15] be damned who believe not the truth but
[4:17] had pleasure and unrighteousness that
[4:20] was there long and that was their desire
[4:21] that was their joy that was their love
[4:23] is this unrighteousness so that's one
[4:25] world that's the world of the ungodly
[4:27] that's the world of hate that's the
[4:28] world of sin that's the world of
[4:29] unbelief that's the world of human
[4:31] nature Fallen nature but now he says but
[4:33] we are bound to give thanks always to
[4:35] God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord
[4:38] because God hath from the beginning
[4:40] chosen you to Salvation through
[4:43] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[4:45] of the truth remember how brother Bram
[4:48] teaches us that the predestinator are
[4:49] the only ones included in Redemption are
[4:51] considered in Redemption so when we read
[4:54] this the take away from it the very
[4:56] clear takeaway from is there's those who
[4:58] are chosen to delusion
[5:00] and those who are chosen to Salvation
[5:02] And if that if that language kind of
[5:04] hurts a little bit then there's those
[5:05] that are chosen to delusion and then
[5:07] everyone or to Salvation and everyone
[5:08] else they're just kind of left with
[5:10] what's at what's left and so when we
[5:13] look at this as God choosing one to
[5:15] Salvation
[5:16] the object of elective love is chosen to
[5:20] be saved it is by God's choice brother
[5:23] man makes a remarkable statement you're
[5:24] not a Christian by your desire you're a
[5:26] Christian by God's desire and so it kind
[5:28] of puts it all we love him because he
[5:30] first loved us and he chose us by
[5:31] elective love and so the object of
[5:35] elective love uh has a different Destiny
[5:38] than everyone else has a different fate
[5:39] than everyone else and if some of you
[5:41] are kind of um building very quickly and
[5:44] taking the next step you say oh does
[5:45] that mean there won't be anyone else in
[5:47] eternity uh who isn't the object of this
[5:50] elective love they'll be those who are
[5:52] there but we're just looking at this
[5:54] elective love that gives unique and true
[5:57] salvation to the elect
[5:59] and there'll be those who enter into
[6:01] eternal life they'll be those who were
[6:03] not part of the body of Christ and not
[6:05] saved
[6:06] that will receive eternal life at White
[6:08] Throne judgment I think we've gone
[6:09] through that even recently and so this
[6:11] isn't this isn't trying to bring some
[6:13] hard stop to uh to eternal life or some
[6:16] hard stop to those who will be there in
[6:18] eternity but it is meant to distinguish
[6:21] among those who are God's elect and
[6:24] everyone else who finds themselves under
[6:25] a different Destiny and fate
[6:27] and I think the devil would like to blur
[6:29] those lines it says in Matthew chapter
[6:31] 24 verses 11 and 12 and many false
[6:33] prophets shall rise and shall deceive
[6:35] many so we read where it says as many as
[6:39] I love by rebuke and chasten and so the
[6:41] the many are those that he loves so that
[6:44] says that he's loved many not all but
[6:45] there's a many that God loves it means
[6:47] there's an elect that God loves and here
[6:49] it says that false prophets shall arise
[6:51] and shall deceive many not all but many
[6:53] and because iniquity shall abound the
[6:55] love of many shall wax cold
[6:58] it's through this process that we see
[7:00] there there's no love for the truth
[7:02] there's no love for the things of God
[7:03] there's no love for righteousness and so
[7:06] this love that we're talking about
[7:07] perfect love becomes such a unique thing
[7:09] that it can only be found among the
[7:11] elect
[7:13] even A Love For Truth a love for Christ
[7:15] a love for things of righteousness that
[7:17] there's not even just uh even a sincere
[7:20] desire to uphold virtuous sincere desire
[7:22] to uphold righteousness because of
[7:24] iniquity the love for the simple things
[7:26] of the gospel and the pure word of God
[7:27] is waning all across the world
[7:31] and it's these false prophets that are
[7:33] deceiving many but now if you've jumped
[7:34] to verse 24 for this shall arise false
[7:37] Christ and false prophets and shall show
[7:38] great signs and wonders in so much if it
[7:42] were possible they shall deceive the
[7:44] very elect
[7:45] and there's your for God so loved the
[7:48] world in other words it's the love of
[7:50] God that keeps you from being deceived
[7:53] there is a predestinated objective for
[7:55] the love of God those that God loves he
[7:58] has a predestinative objective for them
[8:00] and that objective will not allow you to
[8:02] be deceived
[8:04] I know we like to think it's because we
[8:05] study and because we pay attention in
[8:07] church and that we just we're just good
[8:09] enough and by golly when we see
[8:10] Vindication we recognize it that quick
[8:13] and hey you know what can I say we're
[8:15] spiritual right and so we feel really
[8:17] good about ourselves but God's always
[8:18] going
[8:22] it reminds me of the other day I was
[8:24] going to Dutch Bros or some say Dutch
[8:26] Brothers there's a debate on that but
[8:27] Dutch Bros I think is the official
[8:29] corporate stance and as I'm getting my
[8:32] drink for my the drink for my wife
[8:34] uh I was asked who's the most famous
[8:38] person you ever met and I'm like
[8:40] and I didn't really know what to say I
[8:42] was like I've met some athletes in my
[8:43] time and I asked them who's the most
[8:45] famous person they met I don't know who
[8:47] that was
[8:48] and and as I drove away I just had this
[8:52] image and I kind of looked at my
[8:53] passenger seat and there was Jesus going
[8:55] really
[8:58] come on man
[9:00] that was I mean that was served up just
[9:02] perfectly and I'm just driving away you
[9:05] know with the the 911 or triple
[9:07] emergency or whatever it is it's got 340
[9:09] grams of uh milligrams of caffeine in it
[9:12] and I'm like sorry you want me to go
[9:14] back and order another one
[9:16] it just completely forgot that the most
[9:18] famous person I've ever met is Jesus
[9:20] Christ
[9:21] but the reason why that we're not
[9:23] deceived is because of him
[9:25] it's not anything we can brag about it's
[9:27] not being raised right it's not being
[9:28] taught right that there's such a small
[9:31] Veil between deception and and knowledge
[9:35] and Revelation or discernment and Christ
[9:37] is that protection he is that barrier
[9:40] and I'm wanting you to recognize that it
[9:42] has it has to do with the quality and
[9:44] nature of God's election and
[9:45] predestination because God's love
[9:47] demands that the predestinated objective
[9:50] is fulfilled
[9:51] if he has something he's going to do
[9:53] he's going to accomplish it and his love
[9:56] requires this object of his love it
[9:57] requires that God's objective will be
[10:00] fulfilled and brother Brown was looking
[10:01] at God so loved the world he said God is
[10:03] reserving life
[10:05] this is what love does it's reserving
[10:07] life
[10:08] and so in this phrase for God so loved
[10:11] the world there's a beautiful mystery
[10:12] that's expressed in this phrase and I
[10:15] would say it's expressed in a way to
[10:16] where
[10:17] the immediate thought and I was I went
[10:19] to private school for a number of years
[10:21] and it was a Baptist Southern Baptist
[10:22] convention private school and so this
[10:24] was taught so God so loved the world and
[10:26] the world was just everybody and
[10:27] everyone regardless of of their
[10:30] background or calling or their
[10:32] repentance or their quality in life no
[10:33] matter what it's just God loved everyone
[10:35] he loved the world he loved the
[10:36] mountains he loved the cities he loved
[10:37] the streams God just loved everything
[10:39] and so there's this idea that the world
[10:41] just kind of speaks to all of humanity
[10:43] all of creation all of human nature Jew
[10:46] Gentile you name it they're all kind of
[10:47] lumped in here but the world that's
[10:49] being referred to here is not all humans
[10:51] are human nature it's not the present
[10:53] World nor is it the future world
[10:55] but it's a specific object or subject in
[10:58] second Peter chapter 2 verse 5 it says
[11:00] speaking of God and spared not the old
[11:02] world but saved Noah the eighth person a
[11:05] preacher of righteousness bringing in
[11:06] the flood upon the world of the ungodly
[11:08] the old world was inhabitants of the
[11:11] earth it was the men the race and and
[11:14] their Affairs their goods their
[11:15] Pleasures that's what world can be used
[11:17] to refer to that it has to do with
[11:19] Humanity what they're interested in what
[11:22] their Affairs are their goods their
[11:23] devices their Pleasures their
[11:25] possessions and so when God spared not
[11:27] the old world it was all the inhabitants
[11:29] therein and it was all their goods and
[11:31] all their possessions and all their
[11:32] cities and so God destroyed the ungodly
[11:35] world because of sin the Bible says
[11:37] their imagination was only evil
[11:39] continually and he preserves only eight
[11:41] Souls
[11:42] and so God so loved the world that he
[11:44] gave his only begotten son and now when
[11:46] we back up to the days of Noah God was
[11:48] so uh repentant of having created man
[11:51] that he's like I'm going to wipe them
[11:53] off the face of the Earth and he only
[11:54] preserves eight well when the old world
[11:56] was destroyed let me say this it didn't
[11:58] destroy the world that God loved
[12:02] in second Timothy chapter 4 verse 10 so
[12:04] that's the world passed and then it says
[12:06] for demuth Demas hath forsaken me having
[12:08] loved this present world
[12:13] again this is an example of how that the
[12:17] world that Demas loved is its Affairs
[12:20] it's politics it's present State it's
[12:22] current condition as it relates to
[12:24] humanity and Paul is forsaken
[12:28] by Demas who had a love for a world and
[12:31] this world is a different world than the
[12:33] world that God loved the soul loved
[12:35] World holds a mystery which I believe we
[12:37] kind of really drilled down last time
[12:38] which you are a part of by
[12:39] predestination it says for God so loved
[12:42] the world you you ought to think of
[12:43] yourself as being a part of that my
[12:45] predestination this is God's elective
[12:47] love for me
[12:49] but this mystery holds more than just
[12:51] individual salvation though that is the
[12:52] most important thing for us it holds
[12:54] more in its type and is it
[12:56] representation but all of it that this
[12:58] world represents is God's original plan
[13:00] and purpose
[13:01] that God so loved the world he has some
[13:04] objective he has he's the lover with the
[13:06] loved and his love has an elect object
[13:09] and it has a predestinated objective for
[13:12] that object
[13:13] and as Jesus says for God so loved the
[13:16] world that he gave his only begotten son
[13:18] he is and he's what he's rep what he's
[13:22] raising to this Jew is important for us
[13:24] to consider because the audience being
[13:27] Nicodemus holds a key to understanding
[13:29] the mystery of this lover his love and
[13:31] the loved speaking to a Jewish rabbi I
[13:33] believe as we mentioned last time
[13:35] and he's kind of rebuking him or
[13:37] refuting rebutting the belief that the
[13:39] messiah's salvation this King Messiah
[13:41] when he comes was going to be only to
[13:43] Israel or to the Jews because that's the
[13:45] way that they looked at it you could go
[13:46] through countless other scriptures and
[13:48] you say that and even in the rabbinic
[13:50] teachings in the midrash and you go and
[13:52] read all their or their Traditions that
[13:54] oral history has been transcribed in
[13:55] their writings uh they take from many
[13:57] different scriptures how that when the
[13:59] Messiah comes he's going to be tender to
[14:01] Israel and sharp to everyone else
[14:03] they take Malachi 4 2 about the son of
[14:05] righteousness Rising with healing in his
[14:07] wings he says there's healing for the
[14:08] Israelites but the all the other nations
[14:10] shall be burned by it
[14:12] so though there's healing the wings of
[14:15] the son of righteousness for Israel but
[14:17] everyone else those wings are going to
[14:18] burn them they're going to be destroyed
[14:19] and we're going to walk out on the ashes
[14:20] of the wicked they say there's Mercy for
[14:22] Israel but judgment for the rest of the
[14:24] Nations
[14:25] and so Jesus is and if I could say this
[14:28] now and come back to it uh maybe a later
[14:30] time Jesus is hinting at the Gentile
[14:32] Brave
[14:34] because here are the Jews like we're it
[14:35] we are the chosen ones we are the seed
[14:38] of God we are the Seed of Abraham we are
[14:40] the ones that all the promises pertain
[14:42] to that when the Messiah comes he's
[14:44] going to restore our kingdom and raise
[14:46] up this great Kingdom and in this
[14:48] Kingdom the Messiah is going to rule and
[14:50] Reign and we're gonna he's gonna Rule
[14:52] and Reign Over all other nations of the
[14:54] rod of iron and they'll all come to his
[14:56] light but his subjects
[14:58] to us and subjects to our nation
[15:01] and so the kingdom was at the center of
[15:03] the Prophecy of the Messiah and that's
[15:05] enormous concept and principle that uh
[15:07] you just would open up a whole other
[15:09] channel of thought but Jesus in John
[15:12] chapter 3 will read verse 3 and Skip to
[15:14] verse 5.
[15:15] after Nicodemus has kind of offered this
[15:18] a compliment we know that you couldn't
[15:19] do these things unless you came from God
[15:21] it's at that moment that Jesus now
[15:23] speaks to something that's going to be
[15:24] at the very heart of Nicodemus because
[15:27] Nicodemus is a believer that the Messiah
[15:29] is going to come when he comes he's
[15:31] going to restore Israel and if if this
[15:33] is the Messiah if you're the Messiah
[15:35] then you're going to restore the kingdom
[15:37] break the bonds of slavery and bondage
[15:39] of Rome you're going to bring You're
[15:41] Going To Rule and Reign and the whole
[15:43] earth is going to be uh see the light of
[15:46] this great glorious Kingdom so the
[15:47] kingdom is at the heart of what this Jew
[15:50] is thinking about so Jesus says in verse
[15:53] 3 verily verily I say unto thee except a
[15:55] man be born again he cannot see the
[15:58] kingdom of God
[15:59] now this has some layers to it because
[16:02] it to a Jew
[16:04] when a non-jew is converted they kind of
[16:07] viewed him as being like a newborn baby
[16:08] that was kind of their language that
[16:10] they would use is that a non-jew when
[16:12] converted begins again and knew as as a
[16:15] babe so when Jesus says that except a
[16:17] man be born again he cannot see the
[16:19] kingdom of God he's kind of spoke
[16:21] directly to kind of what's in the heart
[16:22] of Nicodemus and he's saying and I think
[16:25] Nicodemus kind of catches that there's
[16:27] some sort of rebuttal here because he's
[16:28] like what what is a man gonna do you
[16:30] know you're obviously not talking about
[16:31] a gentile you're talking about the Jews
[16:34] who are looking to see the kingdom they
[16:35] want to see the kingdom they want to see
[16:37] it restored the Messiah is going to be
[16:38] the one that's restored it and he says
[16:40] unless you are born again you won't see
[16:42] that
[16:43] he said well how can that be how are we
[16:45] going to enter back into our mother's
[16:46] womb and be born a second time he says
[16:47] verily verily I said to thee accept a
[16:49] man be born of water in the spirit he
[16:50] cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[16:53] and as we could read the next few verses
[16:55] we'd find that he's dividing between the
[16:57] flesh that which would be of Abraham
[16:58] that which would be of their parents
[16:59] between those that were born of the
[17:01] Flesh and those born of the spirit and
[17:03] this is a really strong challenge to
[17:06] Jewish tradition because everything to
[17:08] them related to Bloodline and flesh they
[17:10] found they found their their
[17:12] sanctification they found the security
[17:14] and the fact that they could trace their
[17:15] blood lineage back to Father Abraham and
[17:18] as long as their genealogy was correct
[17:20] you know as long as they got the 23andMe
[17:23] test back and they were related to
[17:25] Abraham they were good and then if you
[17:27] were a non-jew then you had to come in
[17:28] another way and you had to be the one
[17:30] that's a convert and a proselyte uh to
[17:33] the Jewish faith and you'd be as a
[17:34] newborn babe so Jesus is saying wait a
[17:37] minute I want to take you into a
[17:38] different thought process here that even
[17:41] though you're born after the Flesh of
[17:42] Jew there's a spiritual birth that's
[17:44] required to understand the kingdom of
[17:46] God
[17:47] and in in the church age book chapter
[17:49] four and this is part of the smyrnian
[17:51] church age where brother Brown's going
[17:53] through the love of God in the election
[17:54] of God and all these different
[17:55] statements we've been reading about
[17:57] perfect love and love brother man says
[17:59] and and this is his all caps right so
[18:03] he's wanting he he's yelling at us we
[18:06] did not become seed by rebirth we were
[18:08] seed and therefore we were reborn for
[18:11] only the elect can be reborn
[18:14] did you get that
[18:15] only the elect can be reborn so when
[18:19] Jesus is still talking about accept a
[18:20] man be born again if we just took that
[18:23] to the next level we say unless a man is
[18:25] elected to a birth you'll never
[18:27] understand or see the king of God
[18:29] because we were seed is the reason we
[18:31] could be quickened in non-seed there's
[18:33] nothing to Quicken
[18:35] so there's nothing if someone's non-seed
[18:38] they cannot be born again
[18:40] and so John 3 16 refers to God's Act of
[18:43] love whereby he has elected you to
[18:46] Salvation he has chosen you to Salvation
[18:48] and has chosen you to sanctification and
[18:50] through by belief of the truth and when
[18:52] he's telling this to Nicodemus except a
[18:54] man be born again and he comes back
[18:56] around and says for God so loved the
[18:57] world that he gave his only begotten son
[18:59] that whosoever would believeth to him
[19:01] would not perish but what would be born
[19:03] again into everlasting life
[19:06] it's according to election because only
[19:08] the elect can be reborn
[19:10] John 3 16 for God so loved the world
[19:12] this is an act of love to fulfill his
[19:14] predestinated objective
[19:16] it is it is in order that God would
[19:19] bring forth his perfect will
[19:21] so to put it this way God's not looking
[19:24] at a massive humanity and I think we've
[19:27] um we've kind of unpacked it this way
[19:29] before that God did not create Adam and
[19:32] the woman put him in the garden and then
[19:35] said hold on I'm going to be right back
[19:37] and go take a nap
[19:38] and then go and while he's gone he comes
[19:41] back to walk with him the cool the
[19:42] evening he's like
[19:43] what have you done
[19:45] what happened like like a new puppy or
[19:48] something he left him alone in the
[19:49] apartment he's going who did this who
[19:51] did Adam Adam and he's not distraught
[19:54] and he's like well you know you know
[19:55] what I don't know what else to do except
[19:57] to shut down the garden get out of here
[19:59] fend for yourselves and then God's just
[20:01] over there stewing going okay what
[20:02] should I do what should I do what should
[20:04] I do what should I do how am I going to
[20:05] fix this and I got an idea they're gonna
[20:08] there's gonna be billions of people born
[20:09] throughout centuries and throughout
[20:11] thousands of years but I'll send my son
[20:13] as a sacrifice and then whoever believes
[20:14] in him I'll let them live in heaven one
[20:16] day
[20:17] and that was God's kind of backup plan
[20:19] or that was his response to the devil's
[20:22] move and the devil's like move and says
[20:24] check and then God thinks about it for a
[20:25] while and moves and says Checkmate
[20:26] that's not how it worked
[20:29] as soon as the devil made his move it
[20:31] was Checkmate on the devil I mean it was
[20:33] game over at that point because that's
[20:34] what God was planning on all along what
[20:37] Satan did in the garden worked out God's
[20:40] predestinated plan and objective and so
[20:42] God has a perfect will he's trying to
[20:44] achieve God has something he's wanting
[20:46] to accomplish and so his part of sending
[20:49] the son was to achieve that desired
[20:51] objective
[20:52] listen to the statement that brother
[20:54] Brandon makes when Divine love is
[20:55] projected to its object Sovereign Grace
[20:58] steps in and produces what is projected
[21:01] when Divine love is projected to its
[21:04] object Sovereign Grace steps in and
[21:06] produces what is projected and if I
[21:08] could put this in a real personal way
[21:10] you are the object of divine love and
[21:12] when Divine love is projected to you as
[21:14] the object Sovereign Grace will step in
[21:17] and produce what is projected and I say
[21:19] be it unto me Lord
[21:21] be it unto me
[21:23] so I I think there's been enough said
[21:25] perhaps to get us to think about the
[21:27] world that is meant here in John chapter
[21:29] 3 verse 16 is different than the world
[21:31] of the humanity
[21:34] and the word the word world in the Greek
[21:37] and as is used in the Bible
[21:41] could be used a collection of any sort
[21:43] you know the world of doomlings or the
[21:46] world of
[21:47] uh Monopoly or something but it says the
[21:50] the world this is one of the uses of it
[21:53] an appropriate and harmonious
[21:55] Arrangement or Constitution order or
[21:58] government
[21:59] so a world is a an apt Arrangement a
[22:02] harmonious Arrangement or the uh the the
[22:05] the constitution of something the order
[22:07] of something the government of something
[22:09] and that's used the term world could you
[22:11] be used
[22:12] to refer to a government an order a
[22:15] constitution or a harmonious arrangement
[22:18] of something
[22:19] you with me
[22:20] I feel like I just opened up a book of
[22:23] different languages or something
[22:24] everybody's like um
[22:26] what harmonious
[22:28] it's an appropriate Arrangement
[22:30] something apt and there's order and
[22:32] there's Harmony
[22:33] and this word is translated to adorning
[22:36] in the scripture
[22:38] which is an ornament or decoration an
[22:40] adornment so it's a so whereas it says
[22:43] for God so loved the world that word
[22:45] world there is translated to adorning in
[22:48] the Bible for God so loved the adorning
[22:50] there's so there's something some
[22:52] arrangement some Constitution and so it
[22:54] would speak of like the adorning there
[22:56] would be like the arrangement of stars
[22:58] as the ornaments of the heaven or the
[22:59] ornament of Heaven it's a constitution
[23:02] it's a particular arrangement in order
[23:03] and that's a world of something in First
[23:06] Peter chapter three now this is where
[23:07] I'm just wanting to dive deep now follow
[23:10] me First Peter chapter 3 verses three
[23:12] and four speaking of the woman who's
[23:14] adorning let it not be that outward
[23:17] adorning of plaiting the hair and of
[23:18] wearing of gold or putting on of apparel
[23:20] but let it be the hidden man of the
[23:23] heart in that which is not corruptable
[23:25] so this is something Eternal and
[23:27] everlasting even the ornament of a Meek
[23:29] and quiet Spirit which is in the sight
[23:32] of God of great price
[23:34] so if we read that and we translated
[23:37] this Cosmos to to or Cosmos if we
[23:40] translated it to World it says whose
[23:42] World let it not be the outworld world
[23:45] of planning and wearing and putting on
[23:49] who's adorning whose World let it not be
[23:51] the outward world of the of the physical
[23:53] things but let the world be but let it
[23:56] let the adorning be the World hidden in
[23:59] your heart
[24:00] let the ornament be that hidden part in
[24:03] your heart so it's a hidden world of the
[24:04] heart that the Bible says is precious
[24:06] and valuable in God's eyes
[24:08] we put so much on this part right
[24:11] so much on the pretense the look and
[24:13] what other people think and there's so
[24:14] much competition that goes on how we
[24:16] present ourselves and what we do and the
[24:18] pictures we take and what we share and
[24:20] the vacations we go on and everything is
[24:22] just it's almost so interesting I just I
[24:25] I want to go to Paloma Park on a regular
[24:27] basis and just find a table of a bunch
[24:29] of homeschool moms or women that are
[24:31] pushing their little buggies that have
[24:32] babies and just sit and listen to the
[24:34] cattiness
[24:35] yeah well mine only has one diaper a day
[24:37] and it's cloth
[24:39] you know and it's been passed down from
[24:41] 500 Generations George Washington used
[24:43] it and it's just like everyone's just
[24:45] trying to one-up one another
[24:47] and and it's so much competition and so
[24:49] much talk oh you're going to Disneyland
[24:51] on vacation well we're renting out
[24:53] Disney World
[24:54] so whatever you do don't go on June 16th
[24:57] because it closed we've got it locked
[25:00] down
[25:01] right in the middle of pride month
[25:05] and so there's this outward part that
[25:07] everyone's concerned about and it's that
[25:09] world
[25:10] and he said don't don't Adorn yourself
[25:12] let your world not be the outward world
[25:16] but let your world be the world the
[25:18] hidden man of the heart the the world of
[25:21] a Meek and quiet Spirit the world that
[25:23] is in God's eyes very valuable
[25:25] I think this is kind of a this is a
[25:27] revelation and an element in this
[25:30] scripture that's that's not that's not
[25:31] often seen because we might just say
[25:33] well don't worry about how you do your
[25:34] hair but just be meek and quiet but it's
[25:36] actually speaking to a world that's more
[25:38] precious to God than even someone who's
[25:40] just quiet
[25:42] the world the word that's used for World
[25:45] Cosmos comes from kameo which means to
[25:47] tend for to care for
[25:49] and camiso which is also also means to
[25:53] take up in order to care for and
[25:55] Preserve
[25:56] so Paul Peter is saying let your world
[25:59] not be the outward world where you have
[26:01] the cares of this world as Jesus refers
[26:03] to it so you have a world of man's doing
[26:05] that he cares about that he's concerned
[26:07] about that he cares for so what world
[26:09] speaks of something that you take up and
[26:11] you try to preserve something you tend
[26:13] to something you try to facilitate
[26:15] something you're looking out after and
[26:17] so here's the world of the outward
[26:20] nature the world of outward things the
[26:22] world of the flesh the world of the eyes
[26:23] and the and the lust and all those
[26:25] different things that's the one world
[26:27] that's the world that's condemned but
[26:29] there's another world that God sees and
[26:31] that he values
[26:33] the world he loves and wants to redeem
[26:35] is the world of John 3 16. it's the one
[26:38] he cares for
[26:39] that word there uh Co comizo speaks of
[26:42] taking up it has elements of redemption
[26:44] to take up to 10 for to preserve and to
[26:46] care and so we're always we're
[26:48] constantly trying to pick up this flesh
[26:50] pick up this world pick up the politics
[26:52] pick up the pretense pick up all the
[26:54] outward part but there's a world that
[26:55] God loves that he wants to redeem
[26:58] and so that loved world
[27:01] is a harmonious arrangement
[27:04] it's a specific order
[27:06] it's a government a constitution that
[27:08] God values
[27:10] there's the adorning of the outward man
[27:12] there's the world of the outward man but
[27:14] there's a hidden man of the heart
[27:15] there's a hidden world that God loves
[27:16] there's a hidden world that God values
[27:19] that's the world that God loves
[27:21] and this I hope this doesn't seem to be
[27:24] too
[27:25] too much of a quick of a shift here but
[27:28] I want to look at Genesis chapter 1
[27:29] verse 31 and and this will be my
[27:31] transition
[27:33] in the beginning when God created the
[27:35] Heaven and the Earth and he built this
[27:36] great beautiful Eden that's the world
[27:38] that God loved
[27:40] it
[27:40] represents something in there it has
[27:43] such Rich meaning to us and I found I
[27:46] found myself I guess I'll say this in a
[27:49] way just asking for your prayers but
[27:51] there's things that I that it may just
[27:53] be me but there seems to be so much
[27:54] inspiration behind it but I'm so
[27:57] desirous to preach things maybe that I
[27:59] haven't preached before things that are
[28:01] opening up to me in a greater way and a
[28:03] higher level and there's this drive
[28:05] and this desire to want to minister on
[28:08] those things and I find that God keeps
[28:10] moving me back to things I say this that
[28:12] are so practical
[28:14] and in that I find myself saying that's
[28:17] sufficient
[28:19] because my goal is not to have awesome
[28:21] Sunday mornings my goal is to have even
[28:24] better Monday mornings
[28:26] that's what that's what I want for our
[28:28] church that that teaching and preaching
[28:30] is not to build a climax for one awesome
[28:33] Saturday once a year during our
[28:35] convention and you're thinking when is
[28:37] that I don't know let's talk about it
[28:39] but it's not to build that kind of
[28:41] climax but our climax I want our
[28:42] climaxes to be on what the world calls
[28:45] hump day we're like no this is Peak day
[28:46] like I've just been riding this riding
[28:49] this Trail and I'm going to go to church
[28:50] on Wednesday night and I'm going to get
[28:51] another bump and and that's what I and I
[28:54] realized that God at least as he's
[28:55] dealing with my heart is giving us tools
[28:57] that are so practical that if you don't
[28:59] look at this as an opportunity to have
[29:01] your ears itched you can get something
[29:02] out of this you can get a lot out of
[29:05] this and so I find myself coming back a
[29:07] lot to Genesis chapter one and in the
[29:09] beginning because God is manifesting
[29:11] something not mysterious and deep in the
[29:13] way that ooh that was great that's
[29:15] really rich but it's practical for us to
[29:17] understand what God is doing in the time
[29:19] we're living in now
[29:20] and so it says in Genesis 1 31 and God
[29:23] saw everything that he had made and
[29:26] behold it was very good and it says the
[29:28] evening
[29:29] in the morning were the sixth day
[29:32] and
[29:33] it says in verse 2 that the the heavens
[29:35] and the Earth were finished so God has
[29:38] done creating he has done bringing forth
[29:41] his creation
[29:42] and he's and he says it is very good and
[29:46] we recognize from the scripture that six
[29:48] other times he has said it's good it was
[29:52] good it was good it was pleasant it's
[29:54] agreeable it this is excellent but now
[29:56] it's very excellent
[29:58] and so there's something being expressed
[30:00] in this that when God finishes creating
[30:01] he sees something that's exceedingly
[30:04] pleasing so this is God's this is not
[30:06] revealing all of God's heart but it
[30:08] shows something further in God's desire
[30:10] to say now that I've brought this forth
[30:12] I see something very pleasing to me and
[30:15] it's important for us whether you would
[30:17] accept that man and the woman existed as
[30:20] separate entities at this point or he's
[30:23] looking at man and woman as one
[30:24] regardless whatever's represented in
[30:27] that God sees the potential of it and
[30:29] God in looking at it says this is this
[30:31] is very good
[30:33] not because this not because he's done
[30:36] and he's ready to leave it to itself and
[30:38] just visit in the evenings for
[30:39] Fellowship but he sees something that's
[30:41] now reflecting it's something in his
[30:43] desire
[30:44] and so God in the beginning as we've
[30:46] looked at this in the past he's planting
[30:48] the seeds of his great plan Eden is the
[30:51] place of God's Delight it's a his
[30:53] pleasure it's a place of Happiness it's
[30:55] a place of joy and so as he creates and
[30:58] he creates this world and he puts the
[30:59] man there and he puts them in there to
[31:00] till the garden it's in this canvas that
[31:03] God is painting a picture of what's in
[31:05] his heart
[31:06] that we can say well this is this is
[31:09] representative of something inside of
[31:11] him
[31:12] and if God is creating a world
[31:15] and he's being deliberate about it he's
[31:17] been intentional it's not just throwing
[31:19] it out there and things are just kind of
[31:21] sticking and things are unfolding but
[31:22] he's very intentional brother Branham
[31:25] when he's preaching in Arizona he speaks
[31:26] about the in the power of transformation
[31:28] The Great Master of all intelligence he
[31:31] had in his mind what he wanted to do and
[31:32] he refers to the trailer park in
[31:34] Prescott he says when you Brethren
[31:35] designed this park uh how you'd make it
[31:38] was in your mind you kept working that
[31:39] Vision out he said that's the way God
[31:41] did about the world he worked it was in
[31:44] his mind
[31:46] now when we use the phrase that
[31:49] God's thought that it exists first and
[31:52] his mind is a thought
[31:54] and then the word is a thought expressed
[31:58] I I think that we have a tendency to
[32:01] associate God's Thoughts with our
[32:02] thoughts when the Bible clearly says
[32:04] they're not
[32:06] right so when he says my thoughts are
[32:08] not like your thoughts don't don't think
[32:10] of it this way we're like oh God must be
[32:13] wanting to go to Rito's today and I
[32:15] really want to go to PF Changs
[32:17] that that's not the your thoughts are
[32:19] different right you ever seen the the
[32:21] little one single panel cartoon where
[32:23] the cowboy says to the other and he goes
[32:25] Do You Hear What I Hear and the other
[32:27] couple goes no I Hear What I Hear
[32:29] and so it's in that way that God's
[32:32] thoughts are different and ours and that
[32:34] they're completely different it's not
[32:36] that he's thinking about something
[32:38] you're not thinking about it's that his
[32:40] thoughts are completely different
[32:42] so God is not just over there like us
[32:44] who just we're just thought receptors
[32:46] and we're kind of like where'd that come
[32:47] from and we just have all sorts of crazy
[32:48] ideas and and they always come right
[32:51] when we lay our head down on our pillow
[32:53] right and we're going to bed and our
[32:56] spouse wants to go to sleep Nelson says
[32:57] did you ever think about this did you
[32:59] ever think about that you're like I'm
[33:00] trying not to
[33:03] that's how we think but God's thoughts
[33:06] are not our thoughts so when you think
[33:08] of God's thoughts don't think in terms
[33:10] of just things that are entering in his
[33:12] mind think about
[33:14] well there's maybe a lot of thoughts and
[33:16] thinks in here
[33:18] you should form the representation in
[33:21] your thoughts that God's thoughts are
[33:23] what he is meditating on
[33:26] God's thoughtfulness because they're
[33:28] substance to his thoughts
[33:30] and so when God begins to create
[33:32] creation is not just his thoughts
[33:34] expressly I'm thinking of a bunny rabbit
[33:37] and I'm thinking of stars no it's God
[33:39] creation it's God's Eternal
[33:41] contemplation
[33:42] what God thinks about what he meditated
[33:45] on what his mind revolved around it was
[33:48] God's Eternal contemplations and
[33:50] thoughts coming into existence
[33:54] so now if you could look at this
[33:55] statement with me I believe I have the
[33:56] from God's power to transform this is
[33:58] very important for us to grab a hold of
[34:00] these words
[34:03] only in the sense of what I'm trying to
[34:05] express to you today really hinges on
[34:07] this
[34:08] says in the Garden of Eden was God's
[34:11] economy of Innocence
[34:13] so this is used in a language I think
[34:15] that is precise for a reason when he
[34:18] creates and he places man in the East of
[34:20] Eden in a garden this is God's economy
[34:24] and it's an economy of innocence and
[34:26] that was one of the dispensations so now
[34:28] he carves out economy and dispensation
[34:31] the first dispensation was innocence and
[34:34] you'll find those two phrases are
[34:35] obviously connected people knew no sin
[34:38] they didn't know anything about Sin both
[34:39] Adam and Eve were naked but they were
[34:41] hid from their nakedness by a spirit
[34:43] Veil over their face that's that perfect
[34:46] love
[34:47] this is something that's covering them
[34:49] this is something that they're dwelling
[34:50] in this is something they understand
[34:51] everything had the right context and
[34:54] never nothing was misunderstood where if
[34:56] you would if they could have beheld them
[34:58] without understanding they'd be like why
[35:00] are you doing that but with perfect love
[35:01] there's this understanding there's this
[35:03] confidence there's this trust and so it
[35:06] says in the Garden of Eden or the Garden
[35:07] of Eden was God's economy of Innocence
[35:09] the world that God created is his
[35:12] economy
[35:13] which means Arrangement or mode of
[35:15] operation it's a system of interaction
[35:17] so when we think about economics or
[35:19] economies today and whatever that scale
[35:21] might be in whatever way that you
[35:23] understand it this is what God had
[35:25] produced he had produced an economy an
[35:27] arrangement a way of operating a way of
[35:29] interacting in a way of transacting this
[35:32] was God's perfect world
[35:34] I hear an economy he had participants in
[35:37] the economy I'm sure there's some to
[35:39] some degree maybe an economist that can
[35:40] show what the supply and demand was and
[35:43] and how everything was working and what
[35:45] this is how God had arranged all of it
[35:47] so it's God's economy of Innocence but
[35:50] then he says then he says the first
[35:51] dispensation
[35:53] and this word dispensation in the Greek
[35:56] that's used in the Bible is the same
[35:58] word that we get economy from in our
[36:01] English so it's the same word that he's
[36:02] looking at and a dispensation
[36:06] scripturally is a distinctive
[36:08] arrangement in order to fulfill God's
[36:10] purpose
[36:11] so a dispensation is the way that God
[36:13] orders events uh to and in the world to
[36:16] accomplish his will
[36:18] so if there's a dispensation we say well
[36:20] there's a dispensation of this there's a
[36:22] dispensation of that you have to if
[36:23] you're going to understand the
[36:25] dispensation you have to ask yourself
[36:26] what is God trying to accomplish
[36:29] so when you so you have to recognize in
[36:31] the end time in the Rapture message
[36:33] brother Bram says we're changing
[36:34] dispensations then you have to
[36:36] understand God's objective is changing
[36:37] and that's why you have a change in
[36:39] dispensation Satan does not determine
[36:41] the corner that's turned Satan does not
[36:43] determine the change in dispensation
[36:45] when God when God's objective has been
[36:47] fulfilled and there's another one to
[36:48] fulfill God begins to order events and
[36:51] Affairs and allow things to happen so
[36:53] that that dispensation could come into
[36:55] effect in order for God to fulfill his
[36:57] plan so there's God's economy of
[36:59] Innocence God's economy his dispensation
[37:02] it's God's ordering of the world and
[37:04] events to accomplish his will
[37:06] a dispensation is God's plan of
[37:08] management a plan of administration a
[37:10] dispensing dispensation he's dispensing
[37:12] things he's laying things out he's
[37:13] allocating things in order to do
[37:15] something to accomplish his will
[37:18] so in Satan's Eden brother Branham says
[37:20] having faith in all his word his seeds
[37:22] brought an Eden of Holiness love and
[37:25] eternal life that's what that economy
[37:26] was
[37:27] Holiness love eternal life that's what
[37:29] God's Eden produced holiness
[37:31] and it brought an Eden of holiness
[37:34] of love understanding Perfection and
[37:36] eternal life
[37:37] this is the world that God loves
[37:40] he loves an eternal world
[37:42] he he loves holiness
[37:44] to understand the Perfection the world
[37:46] that God loved it's embodied in in the
[37:48] beginning when God creates the heavens
[37:49] and the Earth and his thoughtfulness
[37:51] begins to unfold and it's not just
[37:53] whatever comes in his mind comes out
[37:54] into creation but that which was Central
[37:56] to himself
[37:59] and and I I kept this next statement in
[38:02] there even though it deserves much more
[38:04] attention but think of having faith in
[38:06] his own word he brought forth an Eden of
[38:08] Holiness then he says that's what God is
[38:11] planting his word his seed what he is
[38:13] planting that's what his church will be
[38:16] at the end it'll be the same thing
[38:19] so do you recognize how that God is
[38:22] ordering this
[38:23] he's saying that in the beginning God's
[38:26] word brought forth the world that he
[38:28] loved
[38:29] and he says and these are those are my
[38:31] words obviously he says the church in
[38:33] the end will be the same thing
[38:35] she is going to be his garden that which
[38:38] he takes up and cares for the the
[38:40] reserving of Life the cultivating the
[38:43] raising up the causing to be fruitful
[38:45] whatever Eden represented in the end the
[38:48] bride is going to fulfill the potential
[38:50] of Eden
[38:51] [Music]
[38:52] she she becomes that restored Eden just
[38:55] as she's referred to as the restored Eve
[38:58] Amen brother Branham I thought I had the
[39:00] statement here realizing now that I
[39:01] don't have it he said they were safe in
[39:03] God's Pavilion
[39:06] in the secret of his Pavilion he'll hide
[39:08] me
[39:09] for those of you who love to do Bible
[39:10] studies God's Pavilion a pavilion is a
[39:13] large stately tint for habitation
[39:16] Glory
[39:18] he's going to hide them they were safe
[39:20] in God's Pavilion it was safe in God's
[39:22] tent the stately tent maybe like a
[39:24] cathedral someplace God is wanting to
[39:26] hide his elect he said they had perfect
[39:28] love perfect understanding the love of
[39:30] God in that place
[39:33] he says everything's in Perfect Harmony
[39:35] just speaking about the garden God in
[39:37] harmony with this creature and the
[39:38] creature in harmony with his maker this
[39:40] is the world a harmonious Arrangement a
[39:43] constitution an order a government this
[39:45] is this is what God likes Unity Harmony
[39:49] our code this this Mutual dependency
[39:52] everything in Perfect Harmony God in
[39:55] harmony with this creature creature and
[39:56] harmony with his maker in another place
[39:57] he said they were so perfect in harmony
[39:59] with God till they were one with God God
[40:01] and his family was one
[40:03] this is the world that God loved that
[40:06] Harmony that interaction a work for Adam
[40:09] to do the supply that God gave them the
[40:11] help me that God gave him and the woman
[40:12] this is God looking down and seeing all
[40:14] of his word faith in his seeds that
[40:16] bring everything forth and here he is
[40:18] the word being fulfilled the word being
[40:20] fulfilled everything's happening this is
[40:21] what God loves Harmony Arrangement Unity
[40:24] everything being related to one another
[40:26] and complimenting one another
[40:28] in that Arrangement and I I don't mind
[40:31] if you allow your thoughts to kind of
[40:32] expand on this a little bit after I say
[40:34] it but in this God wasn't looking at a
[40:36] hierarchy he was looking at everything
[40:39] in harmony
[40:40] then as long as everyone was in their
[40:42] place they're all hip to hip right
[40:43] they're all working together they're all
[40:45] seeing eye to eye standing shoulder to
[40:47] shoulder this this is a harmonious
[40:49] Arrangement there's no one in God's
[40:51] kingdom everything is working in order
[40:53] together
[40:54] brother Bram says in power of
[40:56] transformation there was Adam and Eve
[40:57] Walking In the Garden of Eden every seed
[41:00] bringing forth it never could do nothing
[41:02] else it never could do nothing else
[41:04] because God said let it be that way it
[41:06] had to be that way
[41:08] that's the world that God loves his word
[41:10] being fulfilled
[41:11] his word coming to pass that God
[41:14] planting seed the joy of planting seed
[41:16] the joy of seeing it come to fruit the
[41:18] Bible says there's nothing better for a
[41:19] man than to enjoy the fruits of his
[41:21] labor so here's God he's labored he's
[41:23] created he's rested now it's time for
[41:25] God to reap the benefits of his labor
[41:27] now what he's always been thoughtful of
[41:29] is expressed now God's thoughts can
[41:32] unfold this is this is the world that
[41:34] God loved but God planned it that it
[41:37] would be interrupted right we know that
[41:39] that when Satan worked out what was
[41:40] necessary for the plan of God In the
[41:42] Garden of Eden when Satan worked that
[41:43] out but God wants to show the picture
[41:45] real quick
[41:47] I think the young people do something
[41:49] where they take their phone and they
[41:50] show you something real quick and try to
[41:51] try to guess what it is well this is
[41:53] this is this is God almost doing that
[41:55] for us like look at this it's going to
[41:57] leave it's going to go but I want you to
[41:59] remember it
[42:00] because it's going to change
[42:02] and so brother Branham says it had to be
[42:05] that way
[42:07] let me stop he says oh how I'd like to
[42:10] stop here just a minute to say
[42:12] there is where we're facing yet the
[42:15] completion of that word
[42:17] I know we've ministered on this a number
[42:19] of times and maybe the majority of us
[42:21] weren't here when we begin to preach on
[42:22] this in the beginning when this church
[42:25] was started but he's saying where we are
[42:28] today
[42:28] go back to the beginning that's what
[42:30] we're finishing
[42:32] that's what we're finishing
[42:34] is what was started then so there's
[42:36] something to the thought that God is
[42:38] wanting to redeem back what was lost
[42:40] this condition in the Garden of Eden
[42:41] this perfect harmony the harmony between
[42:43] the father and the son is expressed in
[42:45] Christ God wants that Harmony between
[42:47] the bride and Christ
[42:50] his brother Brandon says in the sermon
[42:51] Christ is the mystery God revealed I'd
[42:52] highly recommend this sermon as being
[42:54] one to go through and listen to
[42:56] right now during this season he's
[42:58] talking about the threefold purpose of
[43:00] God's mystery is revealed
[43:02] makes sense revealed God manifest in
[43:04] Christ
[43:05] manifests in the church notice this next
[43:07] statement
[43:09] in order to redeem the Lost Eve back to
[43:13] the original condition in the Garden of
[43:15] Eden
[43:17] so this is what God is wanting to
[43:18] accomplish through this great Revelation
[43:20] is to bring us back to the world that
[43:23] God loved
[43:24] I know I'm putting that in a language
[43:26] that that serves my the the series on
[43:28] love and you say well that's kind of
[43:29] self-serving but I'm wanting you to
[43:31] recognize the nature of God's love
[43:33] because there might be parts of us that
[43:34] say well I I understand election I
[43:37] understand God's word can never fail I
[43:39] understand that God will prove his word
[43:41] and the word will never pass away we
[43:43] have all these things that we understand
[43:44] but then when it comes to God's love we
[43:46] kind of just put that in some sort of
[43:48] temporary stator in the middle and we
[43:50] we're either subject to it or we're not
[43:52] we're subject to it or not I'm wanting
[43:53] you to somehow be able to tie it all to
[43:55] get begin to tie it all together and see
[43:57] how it all harmonizes that God's love
[43:59] projected towards you is the object is
[44:02] Sovereign Grace is going to step in and
[44:04] produce what is projected
[44:06] and so in the beginning God brought
[44:08] forth an Eden of Holiness and of love
[44:09] and eternal life and God showed it and
[44:12] expressed it and manifested in Adam and
[44:14] the woman and here's this world that God
[44:16] loves and he does he does it knowing
[44:19] that it's not not going to stay in that
[44:20] state forever but knowing that what love
[44:24] is going to do since that's a world it's
[44:26] an order it's a harmonious Arrangement
[44:27] it has with it the meaning to take up
[44:30] and to care for and to tend to and
[44:33] preserve so even if that world failed
[44:35] God knew he'd pick it back up again
[44:38] and restore back the original condition
[44:41] of the Garden in Eden his brother Graham
[44:43] says in that sermon restore the kingdom
[44:45] to its rightly position
[44:47] so in Genesis 1 1 it says in the
[44:49] beginning God created
[44:51] that's that's heart driven
[44:54] thought driven
[44:56] purpose focused
[44:58] it's not just a whim
[45:00] it's not just you know God was you know
[45:03] the angels are just giving God a hard
[45:05] time says you're not spontaneous enough
[45:06] you're always planning everything he
[45:07] says watch this
[45:09] and just created something and like oh
[45:11] my goodness there's chaos going on down
[45:13] there he's like well maybe we shouldn't
[45:14] leave it like that God is purposeful
[45:18] he's thinking about he's thinking
[45:19] through it
[45:20] and then God in the beginning created
[45:23] that Bara that is to create to shape and
[45:26] deform
[45:27] it's the manifestation of God's thoughts
[45:31] his thoughtfulness
[45:33] his heart's desire
[45:35] his eternal thoughts
[45:37] and we and when I say that again I
[45:39] remind you his thoughts aren't like our
[45:41] thoughts
[45:43] they are Eternal they have substance
[45:44] they have form so it's something that
[45:46] he's thoughtful about it has something
[45:48] to do with his heart there's times when
[45:49] he says you know I was thinking about
[45:51] this and we're like you want to do this
[45:52] like no I was just thinking about it
[45:55] right because you're just expressing a
[45:58] thought this is a crazy idea and it's
[46:01] like you really want to do that
[46:02] seriously you know that's against the
[46:04] lawn like
[46:05] I just fought it it's not in my heart
[46:07] it's not who I am it's not at my core
[46:09] God's not like that his thoughts are his
[46:11] heart
[46:13] his heart says and they're Eternal and
[46:15] what was it brother random told us about
[46:16] that he says if you can see this you
[46:18] will see many things
[46:21] if you can see what God's thoughts are
[46:23] in and and how they're different than
[46:25] ours and how it's something that's at
[46:27] the core of who he is and a thought is a
[46:30] word expression say logos is the
[46:31] expression of the thoughts of God and
[46:33] what's in his heart then you realize
[46:34] that's what has been internalized is now
[46:37] externalized and that's the substance of
[46:39] who God is so his thoughts represent who
[46:42] he is because as God thinks in his heart
[46:44] so is he
[46:47] the Bible says in Jeremiah 10 12 he made
[46:50] the Earth by his power
[46:52] he established the World by his wisdom
[46:53] his thoughtfulness his thinking and
[46:55] stretched out the heavens by his
[46:56] discretion
[46:58] it's all connected to and tied to
[47:01] what's in his heart
[47:04] and so we've been kind of hinting at
[47:06] this the world that God loved
[47:09] it's reflected in the beginning
[47:12] but this world changes in Genesis
[47:14] chapter 3.
[47:16] I hope that we've been going through
[47:17] this at just in just the right measure
[47:19] so that this can form kind of a full
[47:21] thought here and the only not negative
[47:26] feedback I got on Wednesday night is
[47:28] that I need to preach longer this
[47:30] morning because Wednesday night was only
[47:31] 45 minutes
[47:33] and I know some of you are thinking of
[47:35] all the ones I miss
[47:40] it was that good
[47:42] and you know it
[47:49] the world that God loves is if I could
[47:51] say it's in seed form in Genesis 1.
[47:53] Genesis 2. but everything changes in
[47:56] Genesis 3.
[47:57] and I'm substantial again this is
[47:59] foundational so there's something that
[48:01] kind of leaves you hanging a little bit
[48:02] I trust by God's grace we'll be able to
[48:03] come and connect some things together
[48:05] but look at Genesis chapter 3 with me I
[48:06] want to read verses 14 to 16. this is
[48:10] after the fall of Man in that they've
[48:12] the ACT has been accomplished
[48:14] man has already tried to run and hide
[48:16] from God he's tried to cover himself
[48:18] the blame game has started
[48:21] uh
[48:22] Adam blames his wife and the wife's like
[48:25] I didn't know we had this game she
[48:26] blames the serpent
[48:27] and now God's going to judge and this
[48:30] everything's changing right now
[48:32] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[48:34] because thou has done this
[48:36] Thou Art cursed above all cattle
[48:39] and above every beast of the field upon
[48:41] thy belly shalt thou go
[48:43] and thus shalt thou eat all the days of
[48:45] thy life
[48:47] that's a curse upon the serpent
[48:49] now this is a very interesting statement
[48:51] right in the middle of this and I will
[48:53] put enmity between thee and the woman
[48:56] and between thy seed and her seed
[48:59] clearly clearly ties back to the sin
[49:02] between thy seed and her seed or the
[49:05] seed of the woman and it the seed of the
[49:08] woman shall bruise thy head
[49:09] and thou shalt bruise his the seated
[49:12] woman his Hill
[49:14] so that says this is he's cursing The
[49:17] Serpent and as he's cursed the serpent
[49:19] he just says something that it's it's
[49:22] mysterious
[49:24] I'll put empty hatred between thee and
[49:25] the woman I'll put hatred between thy
[49:28] seed your mix seed the mongrelizing of
[49:30] human blood and the pure seed the seed
[49:32] of the woman
[49:33] and it's going to crush your head Paul
[49:35] revisits this theme in Romans and brings
[49:37] even out greater Revelation to it he
[49:39] says but you're going to bruise his heel
[49:40] and it speaks of the death of Christ now
[49:42] he says unto the woman he said
[49:45] I will greatly multiply by sorrow and
[49:47] thy conception and Saul Thou shalt bring
[49:48] forth children and thy desire shalt be
[49:50] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[49:52] thee so now he has spoken to
[49:56] the serpent
[49:57] the woman and upon them too was the
[50:01] curse upon those that were animate could
[50:02] talk because the next curse is not upon
[50:06] Adam himself but upon the world upon the
[50:08] Earth the nature the elements of the
[50:09] Earth
[50:10] and if I could just use these terms
[50:13] maybe to create some sort of
[50:15] anticipation there's such a remarkable
[50:17] transition here
[50:19] as we read this this is there's a
[50:21] transformation that occurs and I think
[50:23] we could just easily miss the
[50:24] significance say Yep they're being cast
[50:25] out of the garden because then in a few
[50:27] more statements he he puts a uh the the
[50:30] Chairman's there with flaming swords to
[50:33] guard the way of life and the man cannot
[50:34] make it because if they find that tree
[50:36] of life and partake of it they'll eat
[50:37] and live forever so there's more to be
[50:38] unfolded and so as we see this scene and
[50:41] we kind of read it chronologically God
[50:43] says you're cursed you're cursed the
[50:44] Earth is cursed you guys get out of here
[50:46] he dresses him and Landscapes kicks him
[50:48] out of the garden and they're walking
[50:49] away and God says all right that's it
[50:52] you guys guard this
[50:53] and we see it is all over
[50:55] but something what's transpired here is
[50:58] a great shift
[50:59] and brother Branham in the sermon
[51:01] marriage and divorce says now notice
[51:03] now notice now
[51:05] after the beginning
[51:07] after the beginning After Time began
[51:11] he says back in that was eternity is
[51:13] over and I know the way it said if
[51:17] you're if you're looking at this I think
[51:18] this will make a great homeschool
[51:19] project for those of you who are doing
[51:22] whatever program still diagram sentences
[51:24] this would be a fun one to do after the
[51:27] beginning after the beginning After Time
[51:28] began back in that was eternity is over
[51:32] underline the subject Circle the verb
[51:37] now eternity so he's looking at
[51:39] something that you have the beginning
[51:41] and after the beginning eternity is over
[51:44] so while they're in the beginning
[51:45] they're still eternity you catch that so
[51:48] he says after the beginning which was
[51:51] still had an eternal quality to it once
[51:53] that's over he says
[51:55] after the fall that fall was made by Eve
[51:58] after the fall there was need to be
[52:00] another covenant made
[52:02] it makes a few more statements then he
[52:04] reads Genesis chapter 3 verses 14 to 16.
[52:06] and as soon as he's done reading verse
[52:08] 16 he's read 14 15 and 16. the curse to
[52:12] the serpent the curse to the woman he
[52:14] says two Covenants
[52:16] he says now that closes the beginning
[52:19] of what Jesus says it wasn't so at the
[52:22] beginning
[52:23] we got another Covenant now it's another
[52:25] Covenant
[52:26] now instead of maybe just chasing that
[52:29] down right now and looking at that
[52:31] notice what brother branham's
[52:32] identifying when Jesus says from the
[52:34] beginning it wasn't so in the beginning
[52:36] was eternity
[52:38] and then now after the fall after God
[52:40] has cursed those Serpent and cursed the
[52:43] woman that's the end of the beginning
[52:46] that Jesus was referring to and because
[52:48] that was the end of God's dispensation
[52:50] that's the end of God's economy it
[52:53] required a different Arrangement it
[52:55] required a different economy there quite
[52:57] a different constitutional Arrangement
[52:59] so he says it's another Covenant
[53:01] another Covenant means an agreement or
[53:03] Union it means to come together
[53:06] a covenant is a binding seal under under
[53:09] the under the law
[53:10] a marriage is a covenant
[53:14] and so you had one Covenant in the
[53:16] beginning which is which is under this
[53:18] in the world that God loved I hope this
[53:20] I hope that makes some sense I'm not
[53:22] saying you have to say Amen to agree
[53:23] with it you can say well I don't agree
[53:25] but I know exactly what you're saying
[53:26] and that'll be fine with me because I
[53:28] just want to be able to get this point
[53:30] across the world that was in the
[53:32] beginning brother says in the beginning
[53:33] he says after the beginning eternity is
[53:35] over
[53:36] when does that start it starts after
[53:38] this Covenant another Covenant is
[53:40] introduced
[53:41] and that's an agreement it's a new world
[53:43] it's a new economy it's a new order
[53:46] but this so when we what I want you to
[53:48] recognize then is that means the
[53:50] original Covenant
[53:52] is no longer in its original state
[53:56] because now it's a new government it's a
[53:58] new world it's a new set of
[53:59] circumstances God has spoke to the
[54:01] serpent he's actually changing his his
[54:03] physical makeup he's going to be
[54:04] crawling on the ground the woman she's
[54:06] going to have to bring forth children in
[54:08] sorrow not as God had originally
[54:09] contemplated Adam's not going to be able
[54:11] to just speak to anything and bring
[54:13] forth until the ground the way it was
[54:14] originally envisioned now he's gonna
[54:16] have to fight with the Earth it's a new
[54:17] set of rules it's a new covenant
[54:20] we'll get into it more later
[54:22] but God's covenant it's what is what's
[54:24] lost here
[54:26] in Psalms 25 14 The Secret of the Lord
[54:28] is with them that fear Him
[54:30] and he will show them his Covenant
[54:35] the Lord's Secret
[54:37] the Lord's heart
[54:38] was lost with the Covenant
[54:41] because it says the secret of the Lord
[54:42] is with them that fear him to use the
[54:45] term fear evokes images of a marriage
[54:47] relationship in a marriage covenant
[54:48] where there's the love and respect that
[54:50] exists between the two the secret of the
[54:52] Lord is with them that fear Him the
[54:53] secret means familiar Converse or
[54:55] intimacy
[54:56] it's that familiarity and intimacy the
[54:59] secret the intimacy of the Lord is
[55:01] within the fear and he will show he will
[55:03] show them his Covenant why because under
[55:06] that Covenant there's intimacy
[55:08] and that word there even comes from
[55:10] covenant comes from barah which comes
[55:12] back to in the beginning
[55:13] the creation
[55:15] so with the introduction of another
[55:17] Covenant
[55:18] a different Covenant now exists
[55:21] a different Arrangement or Union a
[55:23] different coming together now man to the
[55:25] woman have to be arranged a certain way
[55:26] man to Creation has to be arranged a
[55:28] certain way you realize in the beginning
[55:29] creators in harmony with the Creator the
[55:32] created in harmony with the other
[55:33] created Adam has dominion over all
[55:35] everything working in harmony everyone
[55:36] would obey Adam Adam could control
[55:38] nature The Lion and the lamb walk
[55:40] together brother man describes how
[55:42] beautiful and perfect it was that's
[55:44] that's the way it was in God's world
[55:46] there's no animosity there's no death
[55:48] there was no sorrow there was no
[55:49] bleeding there was no destruction this
[55:51] is a beautiful world and now God says
[55:54] I've got to change everything a
[55:55] different covenants being evoked and
[55:57] God's using symbolic language in a lot
[55:59] of ways here and some very literal
[56:00] language but he's trying to represent
[56:02] everything you knew about that world has
[56:04] now been turned on its head
[56:06] and you have different relationships to
[56:07] each other you have a different
[56:08] relationship to the animals I know Adam
[56:10] you're going to want to go run and talk
[56:11] to Leo you might not want to do that
[56:14] he may not see you the same way anymore
[56:16] because now you're meat to him
[56:18] the ground's not going to bring forth
[56:20] the the grain that you thought it would
[56:22] so easily you're gonna have to fight
[56:23] with it because a different order and
[56:25] Arrangement exists
[56:27] but right in the middle of all this and
[56:30] save your yawns for lunch because I'm
[56:32] almost done
[56:34] right in the middle of all this
[56:37] Genesis 3 15.
[56:39] and I'll put enmity between thee and the
[56:41] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[56:43] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[56:45] shalt Bruce his Hill between 14 and 16
[56:47] God comes right in with 15. right in the
[56:50] middle of the end of the beginning
[56:52] right right in the middle of it curse
[56:55] curse promise right in the middle
[56:59] it may seem like you curse to the
[57:00] serpent but it's actually a promise
[57:02] because the only begotten son of Genesis
[57:04] 3 16 is the Fulfillment of Genesis 3 15.
[57:07] he is the seed of the woman
[57:09] referring to her seed brother bam said
[57:11] the Christ who came by the
[57:12] instrumentality of God apart from Human
[57:14] intercourse the seed is Christ the seed
[57:16] of the woman
[57:18] and what is it that causes God In This
[57:21] Moment he's cursed in the serpent he's
[57:22] in the next moment going to curse the
[57:24] woman but before because notice this his
[57:26] first curse is to The Serpent and God's
[57:29] love required consequences for their
[57:31] disobedience
[57:33] but God's not wanting them to end
[57:35] completely in ruin
[57:36] if he's going to do that he would have
[57:38] killed Adam he would have killed that
[57:39] woman he would have started all over and
[57:41] he would start a new creation but God
[57:42] and his great plan said there's a
[57:44] consequence for what you've done love
[57:46] requires consequences love it it has it
[57:49] has to abide by certain parameters
[57:52] so there's going to be consequences
[57:54] but before he curses the woman or the
[57:56] Earth and Adam as a consequence of that
[57:58] he prophesies
[58:01] for God so loved the world
[58:03] before he even begin to breathe out the
[58:06] cursings he intervenes
[58:09] at a time of punishment as a time of
[58:11] judgment he's not going to leave them
[58:13] without a promise to look to not going
[58:16] to leave them without Redemption it's
[58:18] that seed of the woman that caused Satan
[58:20] to be watching for a son to come forth
[58:23] it was always watching for that one it's
[58:25] the one that Adam looked for it's one
[58:26] that they all look for why because God
[58:28] had promised it
[58:30] and so notice how brother Bradham
[58:32] dramatizes this and I'm just going to
[58:33] read several statements that I don't
[58:35] have in a slide for you but brother bam
[58:37] just dramatizes it so well
[58:40] and I'll just try to I'll try to pick up
[58:42] I just have some statements here when he
[58:44] he begins to kind of characterize and
[58:46] add some color to Genesis 3 15.
[58:49] but the way that brother Branham
[58:50] dramatizes what's happening
[58:52] is the first thing that he begins to
[58:54] express is that God slew the lamb or
[58:57] there was a slain of the lamb and there
[58:59] was a dressing of Adam and the woman
[59:01] in bloody lambskins
[59:04] and then he says you leave and never
[59:06] come back these are just my words
[59:08] summarizing how he's saying it he says
[59:10] and there I could see Adam put his arm
[59:12] around his sweetheart
[59:13] and talks about how much he loved her
[59:16] and she blazed his head on his shoulder
[59:18] and they begin to walk and he describes
[59:20] that slapping sound of those bloody
[59:23] skins beating against the thighs of Adam
[59:25] and as he's walking and he's and he's
[59:28] sad and they don't they're fearful they
[59:30] don't know what the future holds they're
[59:31] being chased out of this beautiful world
[59:33] everything is changed in that moment
[59:35] it's then that brother Branham says that
[59:37] something inside of God couldn't stand
[59:40] to see his lovely family walking out
[59:42] like that and even though love required
[59:45] that they leave
[59:47] because remember had Adam always stayed
[59:49] in the garden and never fell he would
[59:51] have never known God
[59:52] and if we were to come by the original
[59:55] way that we would contemplate we would
[59:57] have all come forth in the beginning we
[59:58] all would have never known God you would
[1:00:00] probably even not even know him as well
[1:00:02] as you do now
[1:00:05] but God it required in order for God to
[1:00:07] be fully known man had to take he had he
[1:00:10] a loud man on that path and man took it
[1:00:12] and his man begins to walk out the love
[1:00:14] of God said no wait
[1:00:17] the way brother Bram describes it says
[1:00:19] God he covered all space and time
[1:00:22] and he and he describes it all these
[1:00:25] other places he fills everything
[1:00:27] he says but in that moment God bottled
[1:00:29] himself up
[1:00:31] if you could if you could let your mind
[1:00:34] imagine how that brother Brown's trying
[1:00:37] to describe this this is the god without
[1:00:38] boundaries this is a God that fills all
[1:00:40] time and space and then exists in
[1:00:42] eternity there's really no parameters
[1:00:43] for him but in that moment all of a
[1:00:45] sudden God goes
[1:00:46] and he forms himself into a funnel and
[1:00:49] he says that God who covered all time in
[1:00:51] space bottled down to four little
[1:00:53] letters l o v e love
[1:00:58] he could not see a child depart from him
[1:01:00] I could hear him say wait just a minute
[1:01:03] Adam
[1:01:04] I'll put enmity between the woman's seed
[1:01:07] and the serpent seed her Hill shall
[1:01:10] bruise his head and his head shall
[1:01:12] bruise her Hill promising a savior
[1:01:17] as they're being banished it's the way
[1:01:19] brother interjection the serpents
[1:01:22] the woman are leaving the garden they're
[1:01:25] under this condemnation they're
[1:01:26] experiencing emotions they've never felt
[1:01:28] before but brother bear says he loved
[1:01:30] them so well until he couldn't see them
[1:01:32] go
[1:01:33] what moves God In This Moment what moves
[1:01:35] God to speak Genesis 3 15. what's at the
[1:01:38] heart of Genesis 3 15. John 3 16.
[1:01:42] then I could see all the great spaceless
[1:01:45] eternity come forming down like a funnel
[1:01:48] again God is describing brother Brown is
[1:01:51] describing God now for just taking
[1:01:53] himself and love bringing them into this
[1:01:56] shape in this form and he says he finals
[1:01:58] himself to four little letters l-o-v-e
[1:02:03] he loved his children so much till he
[1:02:05] couldn't turn them away then I hear him
[1:02:07] say stop I'll put enmity between thy
[1:02:10] seed and the serpent seed promising a
[1:02:13] redeemer god making preparation to
[1:02:16] redeem this world that's being lost this
[1:02:18] Eden that's being closed off to you hold
[1:02:21] on my love will redeem it he's promising
[1:02:24] a savior promise and a redeemer what
[1:02:27] what attribute of God is being expressed
[1:02:29] in this moment love
[1:02:31] he says in another place I can see all
[1:02:33] that great space begin to move together
[1:02:35] like this can you imagine this
[1:02:38] how are you saying this God that fills
[1:02:39] all time and space it's almost like a
[1:02:41] hurricane something coming together
[1:02:42] falling together he says down to a final
[1:02:45] shape like that in a move right down as
[1:02:47] he began to eye in that little couple
[1:02:48] going down through the Garden of Eden
[1:02:50] bloody skins flopping against their legs
[1:02:52] he couldn't stand it and it moved down
[1:02:55] oh it moved down to the very Heart Of
[1:02:57] God spelling o l o v e God so loved
[1:03:04] this is the connection to Genesis
[1:03:06] Genesis 3 15 to John 3 16. for God so
[1:03:09] loved the world that he promised the
[1:03:12] seed of the woman for God so loved the
[1:03:14] world that Adam and the woman were
[1:03:15] leaving that he promised the seed of the
[1:03:18] woman for God so loved the world he
[1:03:20] didn't leave him without Redemption
[1:03:23] he just couldn't see them go he called
[1:03:24] back to them I'm going to put enmity
[1:03:26] between your seed and Satan's seed
[1:03:31] so Genesis 3 15 is the prophecy of the
[1:03:34] only begotten son
[1:03:36] to redeem
[1:03:37] you say the original Eden the original
[1:03:39] Covenant the original World the original
[1:03:42] intimacy
[1:03:44] the original arrangement
[1:03:47] so God's covenant world of perfect love
[1:03:49] is redeemed through Jesus Christ
[1:03:52] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:03:53] he says but Jesus was God's love and
[1:03:55] revelation
[1:03:57] to let to let know to a predestinated
[1:03:59] seed
[1:04:00] that he had called you
[1:04:04] he says he was that great attribute of
[1:04:06] God this may be maybe in Satan's Eden he
[1:04:09] was that great attribute of God Called
[1:04:11] Love
[1:04:14] he was the heart of God
[1:04:16] he is a revelation of God's love God's
[1:04:19] love and Revelation to the predestinated
[1:04:21] seed
[1:04:23] this is what Jesus this is what's
[1:04:24] promised in Genesis 3 15. this is what's
[1:04:27] revealed in Jesus Christ then I ask you
[1:04:29] what about the revelation of Jesus
[1:04:30] Christ in the last days
[1:04:34] what is what is it what is the revealing
[1:04:37] of the son of man is it is it just
[1:04:39] distinctive theology
[1:04:42] so I'm going to say oh oh so you believe
[1:04:44] God sent a prophet
[1:04:46] well I believe that God sent a prophet
[1:04:48] revealed the son of man so that's where
[1:04:50] we're different
[1:04:51] it's that's I mean that's just that's
[1:04:54] just language at that point
[1:04:56] that that kind of understanding just
[1:04:58] becomes a quote War
[1:05:00] and it just my stack beats your stack
[1:05:02] well you did it in 14 point fun hey
[1:05:05] they're just printing out quotes he's
[1:05:06] got bigger quotes
[1:05:10] this Restoration in the last days back
[1:05:12] to the Garden of Eden condition cannot
[1:05:14] come without a revelation of Jesus
[1:05:15] Christ
[1:05:17] brother Brown says in the invisible unit
[1:05:18] of the church the bride to Christ that
[1:05:21] messenger is here now which is Jesus
[1:05:24] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:05:26] forever
[1:05:27] who is that messenger it's the messenger
[1:05:30] of the Covenant
[1:05:31] what condition does he reveal himself in
[1:05:33] Revelations 10 1 with a rainbow upon his
[1:05:35] head why because he's the angel of the
[1:05:37] covenant What covenant not the Covenant
[1:05:39] that was established in Genesis 3 16.
[1:05:43] not another covenant not the Covenant
[1:05:44] after the beginning but it's back to the
[1:05:47] original Covenant again
[1:05:48] he said now when I come back down the
[1:05:51] little book open it's what Adam lost
[1:05:54] it's not church history it's not the
[1:05:56] church ages it's it's not just tying up
[1:05:59] the loose ends of the church ages but
[1:06:01] it's a restoration back of the world
[1:06:03] that God loved and that could not come
[1:06:06] without the very Heart Of God being
[1:06:07] revealed so brother Branham takes it in
[1:06:10] Christ is a mystery in the last days
[1:06:12] when this great mystery that God had in
[1:06:14] his heart is being revealed
[1:06:17] listen it's a revelation this is the
[1:06:19] mystery that God ahead in his heart that
[1:06:21] if now we say it's the back part of
[1:06:23] God's mind that's just a figure of
[1:06:25] speech that tells us this is something
[1:06:27] hidden deep within the God but it was
[1:06:29] the revelation of the great mystery that
[1:06:31] he had in his heart heart purpose heart
[1:06:34] desire deliberate it's l-o-v-e it's love
[1:06:39] amen and I say this this isn't just for
[1:06:41] itching ears this is as practical as
[1:06:43] anything you've ever heard
[1:06:46] God did this God's done this it's
[1:06:48] emphasized over and over
[1:06:51] you listen to the sermons that lead up
[1:06:53] to Christ is the mystery that lead up to
[1:06:55] to souls in prison now that then unfold
[1:06:58] to the next two two uh so years
[1:07:02] and you realize this is God wanting to
[1:07:05] make himself known through his elect
[1:07:09] it's to bring the Fruit of the Spirit
[1:07:12] the living reality of all of God's
[1:07:14] promises in the elect
[1:07:16] that's what it's for
[1:07:19] brother Branham it says this in
[1:07:21] paragraph 102 of the church excuse me of
[1:07:23] Christ is the mystery God revealed now
[1:07:25] God's secret mystery he had before the
[1:07:27] world began
[1:07:28] back in the back part of God's mind
[1:07:31] there was something he's trying and was
[1:07:33] going to achieve
[1:07:34] and he had a motive in doing it
[1:07:37] in order to let himself be expressed
[1:07:40] and that's what
[1:07:42] he it's God being very deliberate he has
[1:07:45] a motive he has an objective he has
[1:07:47] something he wants to accomplish
[1:07:48] something he wants to achieve
[1:07:50] he hasn't fully achieved it in the
[1:07:51] beginning but the elements are there the
[1:07:53] reflection is there and he's wanting to
[1:07:56] he's wanting to bring forth something
[1:07:57] that is a love story
[1:08:00] so he says in a couple little few
[1:08:02] statements later so in his great mind he
[1:08:04] wanted these attributes to be expressed
[1:08:06] in him was love and now this is where I
[1:08:09] want you to find your part even if he
[1:08:11] doesn't say it in him was to be a father
[1:08:13] in him was to be a son in him was to be
[1:08:16] a savior in him was to be a Healer
[1:08:19] in him was to be a daughter in him was
[1:08:21] to be a sister in him was to be a wife
[1:08:24] in him was to be a Sunday school teacher
[1:08:26] an architect God forbid a lawyer in him
[1:08:29] was all these desires right
[1:08:31] in him were things that he wanted to
[1:08:33] express attributes that he wanted to
[1:08:35] express he says in all these great
[1:08:37] attributes which you are
[1:08:39] that we see already expressed they were
[1:08:42] in God
[1:08:43] so this is when we read it again it's
[1:08:46] not the denominational view of this is
[1:08:48] God's backup plan for everyone to be
[1:08:49] saved but God in his mind in his deep
[1:08:52] within his heart love had an image love
[1:08:54] had a name love had a had an arrangement
[1:08:57] and you're part of that
[1:08:59] you were what God was thinking about you
[1:09:01] or what was on his mind your your the
[1:09:03] thoughts of God it's his thinking in
[1:09:05] terms of his meditation what drives him
[1:09:08] what motivates him we say what were you
[1:09:10] thinking you were what I was thinking
[1:09:13] you were what I was thinking what does
[1:09:16] that even mean you you're what I was
[1:09:17] thinking
[1:09:19] I don't have this statement there and I
[1:09:21] don't know if I'll get to the paragraph
[1:09:23] 93 but I just felt impressed to add this
[1:09:25] one in this morning and I'd already sent
[1:09:27] the slides yesterday says notice next
[1:09:29] secondly the manifested Christ in you
[1:09:31] the hope of glory
[1:09:33] threefold purpose of Christ
[1:09:36] God fully manifested Christ have
[1:09:38] premance in the church in order to bring
[1:09:39] back Eden
[1:09:41] right and there's this expression this
[1:09:43] thing that he's wanting to bring forth
[1:09:44] and he says that great manifested God in
[1:09:47] Christ now Christ manifested in you
[1:09:52] what was once God's Great secret great
[1:09:54] mysterious Secret in his mind is now put
[1:09:57] in the hearts of the believer
[1:10:00] what was once in God's heart is now in
[1:10:03] your heart what was once his constant
[1:10:06] thought his constant thinking that's
[1:10:08] what he wants in you and that's what
[1:10:10] perfect love is when that fills up your
[1:10:14] whole heart not half of it not three
[1:10:16] quarters but when that fills up your
[1:10:18] whole heart when the mind of Christ
[1:10:20] raises up and has preeminence in you oh
[1:10:24] what he is now this mystery his heart
[1:10:26] that was in his heart that was in Christ
[1:10:28] is now in the hearts of the Believers
[1:10:30] the body of Christ what was once what
[1:10:34] was God's once great Secret in his mind
[1:10:36] before the foundation of the world is
[1:10:38] now made manifest
[1:10:41] because the bride had risen up
[1:10:48] a dispensation change
[1:10:50] it's not it's not the Pentecostal age
[1:10:52] not even allowed to seeing age
[1:10:55] right
[1:10:57] so glad I'm amongst friends today
[1:10:59] it's the bright age
[1:11:01] and in that age it's uniting time
[1:11:04] different dispensation different
[1:11:06] Administration
[1:11:07] eighth Messengers want to keep you in
[1:11:09] the seventh age
[1:11:10] right so they can be the god to you they
[1:11:13] can be the kingdom to you the king the
[1:11:15] prince the Messiah the eighth messenger
[1:11:17] but if you ever recognize the new
[1:11:19] dispensation in the new Administration
[1:11:20] you realize the son of man the son of
[1:11:23] man
[1:11:24] is the headship to the kingdom
[1:11:26] the revelation of Jesus Christ is our
[1:11:28] headship
[1:11:30] it's a sign that the Rapture is at hand
[1:11:31] it's a sign we turn to Corner
[1:11:35] and what was once in God's heart is now
[1:11:37] in our hearts
[1:11:40] it tells us
[1:11:42] that the world is changing
[1:11:45] that this world that God loves is coming
[1:11:47] back
[1:11:48] and you're a part of it
[1:11:50] do you believe that you're a part of it
[1:11:52] for God so loved the world
[1:11:55] musicians if you'd come as you're coming
[1:11:56] making your way I'll read this last
[1:11:58] statement from Christ is the mystery God
[1:12:00] revealed
[1:12:01] he's praying before he preaches and
[1:12:03] remember he's going to say that he says
[1:12:05] this he he opens by saying that this
[1:12:09] mystery that God had in his mind before
[1:12:10] the world began there was something he's
[1:12:12] trying to achieve
[1:12:14] he had attributes that he wanted to be
[1:12:15] expressed in him was love and and he
[1:12:19] visits the theme of love a few times
[1:12:20] during this service
[1:12:22] and and I don't think that we need to
[1:12:24] try to force everything into the
[1:12:25] Paradigm and the nomenclature of love
[1:12:26] and perfect love but it's Christ
[1:12:29] it's the word of God
[1:12:31] and so knowing what he has to say
[1:12:34] of how it's all in those last days when
[1:12:37] this great mystery that God had his
[1:12:38] heart has been revealed and how Jesus
[1:12:40] was God's love and Revelation to the
[1:12:42] predestinated sea that he's called you
[1:12:44] and he's coming down to the end of that
[1:12:46] sermon and and the way that he begins to
[1:12:48] be so descriptive about the devil
[1:12:52] howling and how the truth is manifested
[1:12:55] in her and he's bringing that revelation
[1:12:57] of Christ United with his bride present
[1:12:59] tense here now revealed himself
[1:13:02] the prayer he prays and I know that
[1:13:04] we've read this uh one other time here
[1:13:08] the prayer he prays to me is so perfect
[1:13:11] to contextualize what he's saying so
[1:13:13] that we're not just itching our ears
[1:13:15] when we hear it
[1:13:16] but we realize this has practical
[1:13:18] outworking in our lives
[1:13:21] this this ought to have this ought to
[1:13:23] look a certain way in our relationships
[1:13:26] this ought to look look a certain way in
[1:13:28] our dealings with one another
[1:13:30] that we realize that whenever I am to be
[1:13:33] what was in God's heart
[1:13:36] was Craig now what was in God's heart is
[1:13:39] manifesting Christ because Christ is the
[1:13:41] heart of God he's that perfect
[1:13:42] reflection
[1:13:44] of God and now that is in you
[1:13:49] if that then think of the do the the
[1:13:51] correct true spiritual math
[1:13:53] can have brother Preston do it for you
[1:13:55] if you can't if you can't figure it out
[1:13:57] but what was being God all that God was
[1:14:00] he put into Christ this is what brother
[1:14:02] Brandon uses even though it's not
[1:14:03] scripture the second part all that
[1:14:05] Christ was he poured in the church if
[1:14:07] that was divine love if that was perfect
[1:14:09] love if Christ was the heart of God
[1:14:12] then what are you now
[1:14:14] what Have We Become
[1:14:16] what are a further manifestation of that
[1:14:19] heart
[1:14:20] brother random even calls in speaking
[1:14:22] about the Covenant maybe maybe reading
[1:14:24] the statement here very soon not today
[1:14:25] relax but that he was the match piece
[1:14:29] there's two parts to that Covenant
[1:14:31] you're part of it
[1:14:33] and this is the prayer that brother
[1:14:34] Brown and prays and you listen to the
[1:14:36] Prelude too Christ is the mystery God
[1:14:37] revealed it's the word of the church
[1:14:39] stay close together love one another
[1:14:40] stick close he says keep us together
[1:14:42] father this is his prayer
[1:14:44] let the holy spirit guide us and direct
[1:14:47] us
[1:14:48] give us a long life of service for you
[1:14:51] and now Christ is the mystery God
[1:14:52] revealed this is what this is what his
[1:14:54] burden is in preaching this give us this
[1:14:56] great message this morning that we're
[1:14:58] expecting out of Thy word that it might
[1:15:00] go to each heart
[1:15:01] next slide make the lips that speak Lord
[1:15:04] speak truth
[1:15:06] make the heart the ears be fertile to
[1:15:08] receive truth and may it grow into great
[1:15:10] trees of eternal life to be shiny lights
[1:15:13] in red Epistles of all men
[1:15:16] that you know what I think the problem
[1:15:18] is we've made the message so mysterious
[1:15:20] we want to keep it mysterious to
[1:15:21] everyone else
[1:15:23] yeah I'm a message believer but you
[1:15:24] wouldn't understand that
[1:15:26] how about we just live it
[1:15:28] make people get thirsty for it and start
[1:15:30] filling up some of the empty chairs that
[1:15:32] we have let's knock down another wall
[1:15:35] and it's only going to happen if you
[1:15:37] live the life if you try to be weird and
[1:15:38] different and mysterious nobody's going
[1:15:40] to want it everybody's weird now
[1:15:42] everybody's a hipster in 2023.
[1:15:46] and this is what the this is what
[1:15:49] is what we're Desiring to do as he says
[1:15:51] Lord
[1:15:52] May It Go into great trees of eternal
[1:15:54] life to be Shining Light and red
[1:15:56] Epistles of all men that's what Christ
[1:15:58] and the Mystery of God is to be don't
[1:16:00] keep Christ a mystery reveal them
[1:16:04] don't keep them a mystery let the Hidden
[1:16:06] World of your heart be expressed let the
[1:16:09] love of God be shed abroad in your heart
[1:16:12] that it might be red of all men
[1:16:14] in other words Our Lives we've got to
[1:16:16] put the mystery of Christ in a language
[1:16:18] that humans can understand
[1:16:20] they may not agree with it but put it in
[1:16:22] a language they can understand God
[1:16:24] living through you breathing through you
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:29] to be shining lights and red Epistles of
[1:16:30] all men
[1:16:31] they might know that Jesus Christ has
[1:16:34] raised from the dead and lives Among Us
[1:16:37] make us so full of love and the fruit of
[1:16:39] the spirit until other men and women
[1:16:40] boys and girls can see the results of
[1:16:43] the Life of Christ still living in US
[1:16:46] after two thousand years from the great
[1:16:48] event
[1:16:52] could you say Granite father to honor
[1:16:55] thee
[1:16:56] could you say we ask in Jesus Christ's
[1:16:58] name amen I want us to be so full of
[1:17:02] love and the Fruit of the Spirit
[1:17:05] till it impacts others
[1:17:08] makes an influence on others for God so
[1:17:11] loved the world you're part of that
[1:17:12] world that he loved that world is an
[1:17:15] economy
[1:17:16] it's an eternal dispensation one day
[1:17:18] that'll never end because there was a
[1:17:20] pause put on eternity
[1:17:22] in Genesis 3 16.
[1:17:24] but now what happens when this Elijah
[1:17:27] comes
[1:17:28] he comes when there's a blending of time
[1:17:30] back into eternity in that moment there
[1:17:33] was a fading out of Eternity in the
[1:17:34] internet of time but now we're caught up
[1:17:36] again in that corn that Ark that
[1:17:39] Keystone of the arch here we are in that
[1:17:41] dispensation the blending of two
[1:17:43] dispensations we're going to an eternity
[1:17:45] it's here
[1:17:47] we're going in we're taking steps higher
[1:17:49] every day do you believe that
[1:17:51] it's not poetic license it's it's not
[1:17:53] just words that we sound a little bit
[1:17:55] funny to the the the the Seventh-day
[1:17:57] Adventist or the the fundamentals out
[1:17:59] there no it's just true
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:02] it's just the reality that we're living
[1:18:03] in and I don't want it to be hid I want
[1:18:06] it not just to be hit in my heart I want
[1:18:09] it to be lived
[1:18:10] just as he lived it let's stand today
[1:18:13] [Music]
