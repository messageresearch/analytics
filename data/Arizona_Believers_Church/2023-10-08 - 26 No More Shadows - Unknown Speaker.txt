TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now we're going to continue on the subject of Heaven's mystery Earth's glory and uh the kingdom and we're going to look at the subject of no more Shadows or that' be my title today is no more shadows and I think it'll um there's different ways you can go with that phrasing no more Shadows I hope that it impacts you in the way that God would desire it to let's just look back at our text and we'll start here as we get into this I um just even the way that prepared for this it's just maybe a little bit different for me and just trus in the Lord how it can come across he says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and then he's says and I in I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and so that phrase to me is very peculiar where he makes this commment as he's describing uh these things he's going to describe the Fountain of Life and uh the city and uh the pure River of Life as he continues there's just so many things he describes and he makes a comment about something that is absent something that is not there and when he says there's no more sea brother Bram in one place says the sea will dry up and another place he says this will change the whole surface of the entire Earth and so that uh fire that's going to come and burn up the Earth uh it it sounds as if maybe it's going to evaporate all the water and things are going to take place and transform and Revitalize the entire surface of the Earth and so John is witnessing as we've been reading in second Peter how there's fire the baptism of fire renovates the Earth Peter John looks at the earth now and he says there's no more sea it kind of stands out to him and we realize now maybe even more than what John perhaps would have just how vast the seas are as far as our visual images and the things that we could see but the sea covers about 71% of the earth I believe it's 97% of the Earth's water are contained in the oceans in the sea and so the absence of the sea was something remarkable to John so he remarks on it something that really stood out to him and it's something that if I could say it's not just John describing saying oh my goodness the city's coming down from heav oh that's interesting there's no water and then he kind of goes back to the big city uh coming down out of Heaven it's something that he notes because he was impressed uh uh to remark that there was no se cuz it holds significance and I hope that you can just quickly enter into the thought today because it's uh every every piece to me is important as I go forward the sea in the Bible was used as a type it's used as a type in scripture and because of its characteristics certain characteristics about the sea and then man's knowledge of it so that someone says well this is like that and if you know what that is then helps you understand what this is and that's exactly how the sea was used its characteristics uh were such that it can be used as a type to understand something because of man's knowledge of it in Isaiah CH 57:20 it says but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose Waters cast up mire in dirt so it uses the sea to speak about Restless Minds who are driven by passions uh they cast up unbelief and pride and this is what they produce in Jude verse 13 it says it speaks of the wicked these men their Raging Waves of sea foaming out their own shame this is how the sea is characterized that there it's a the Raging ways of the sea the troubless of the sea the sea Foams out its own shame it's in Revelations 13 that we see that the Beast arises from the sea James admonishes Us in chapter 1 ver 6 but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed there's something about the sea where it's subject to other forces and influences it gets tossed about and uh it's turbulent and uh maybe even mysterious and we know that as the natural types the spiritual the absence of the sea speaks about something and we could just take from these scriptures and see that when John remarks that there was no more sea we could say well there's no more foaming out of Shame there's no more casting up of M and dirt there's it speaks of this eternal Unity of seas divide the land it speaks of this eternal unity and peace as the Bible says that never less according to his promise we look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness so there there's no more seed there's no more wickedness we talk about how he's cast our sins into the sea uh there's going to be uh the fact that there's no more sea speaks to us of no more unrest no more unsettledness no more sin no more wickedness so when John says there's no more sea it meant something and I would like to look at it in this aspect and I'm kind of using this as a a foundation for some other things if the sea is gone then it must not be necessary and I know it's just a really easy statement to make that if the Sea's not going to be there it must not be necessary to God but its necessity in eternity has been diminished it doesn't need to be there therefore there is no more sea if we still needed the sea God would put the sea there Bible speaks of how that the tree of life is going to be uh ministering healing and there's going to be other elements there pure River of Life there's going to be things in heaven because they're going to serve a purpose and the Sea must not be serving a purpose so the fact that it's gone means it's fulfilled its purpose perhaps or it was it served uh its use and if I could put it this way it was a shadow of something right the Bible as we said already that the Bible speaks of the sea in a certain way and the sea is used as a type for the restlessness of man's mind it's a it was a uh it's a type of being driven just by influences and forces the sea represented something it was just a shadow in Genesis 1: 9 and 10 this is where God gives us the designation of sea and says and God said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together under one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and God called the dry land Earth and the Gathering Together the waters called he sees and God saw that it was good so there was something about this that was good God uses it in the beginning and I want if you could just kind of pick up on the fact that in the end John says there's no more sea but there was a sea in the beginning in the beginning of Creation in Genesis chapter 1 there is a sea and God says it's good but somehow in the end that sea is gone those seas are gone I think that's something to chew on a little bit and brother bradam says in power of transformation he speaks of how God took 6,000 years to make the creation and he says and we see in Genesis 1 and he says yet now we see that in this this God had an objective that he wanted to bring to pass now God uses his creation to tell his story not only in the creation itself but in the creation that has come forth through the uh unfolding of time he used every part for his purpose he's used every part for reason in his program and in doing so he is he is telling something about himself he's putting elements out there that if somebody was putting out material and laying out certain things you could surmise by what doing maybe what they're up to and what they're building and God as a Creator was expressing himself out through his creation and he had an objective that he wanted to bring to pass even in using 6 uh thousand years to create uh the Earth these six days to create the Earth and and uh as we might say 6,000 years it taking these six days to create the Earth the Bible says that six days you shall labor but on the seventh you'll rest and it uses the creation as the basis for that for in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all them that in it are in and rested the seventh day so God is using he used the even the days of creation he subsequently uses them as a type that seven as a rest because as God created through six days and on the seventh they took his rest now I'm going to uh give to you a day of rest so there was a deliberate uh purpose in creation there was a precedent being set just even in the days but also here when it comes to the sea that there was something God was wanting to represent in creation and as the Bible says and there was no more sea I want to say there was no more Shadow because God created the Seas and he had an objective in doing it something that he was wanting to express and objective he's wanting to bring to pass and so if he created the sea for an objective and then there's no more sea then its objective must have been satisfying it must have spoke of something and the something something it spoke of has now appeared or it must have represented something it was used for something it had some utility in the Earth as it would go on uh even after the fall God knew it would have some use even as the we use it to travel and it's used for different resources uh uh home to so much animal life God it there's no more see I want say there's no more Shadow there was no more reflection the sea could no longer reflect anything more to us there was no more need for it now this is a a vast subject but I want to just Define at this moment what I mean by shadow that and I'll just use maybe a more technical definition a shadow is a dark area figure created by an opaque object that blocks light from a source so let's say that shadow is when you are W looking at something and and and as you look as your from your Vantage Point uh you see light is being shown upon an object that is not transparent and so the light can't pass through it so as the light um is dispersed around it uh there's a opaque this opaque uh object creates a shadow or an image it's a figure that's created as light is blocked by that figure and so we know it's just a it's a silhouette a two-dimensional silhouette but yet it exists within three-dimensional space or maybe one way look at it it's the reverse projection of the object shape so when we see a shadow the light is shining on something and you don't see the something you see the light as it passes through it creates a silhouette and you you can see the silhouette and you see a a reverse representation in an outline of what the light is shining on I mean if you're if you're kind of into Mysteries and things like that might you might get a little excited just thinking about the way that that's being described that light shining on something and you don't see the something but you just see the reverse Pro projection of the sketch or outline but you know there's got to be something there and there's got to be light there I love how brother bam takes it says yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death the the shadow seems pretty scary doesn't it the fact that a shadow like oh my there's shadows and shadows but you know the shadow just testifies of one thing that light is shining so where there's a shadow there's got to be light Bible says in Hebrews chap 10:1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect now there's things in this that I want you to hold for the future how that the law was a shadow and the with all of its sacrifices and all of its service it can never bring Perfection though it was a shadow now think of what that shadow is and I'll come back to that it was a shadow of it and being a shadow it can never make you perfect but whatever it was the shadow of or the object it was a shadow of that's what could make you perfect is what Paul is saying so the law reflected a sketch or an outline of something the law was a shadow of good things to come so you could have the shadow which is the law but that means the light was shining on a good thing and creating this inverse image in a two-dimensional silhouette that was called a shadow and you look at the Shadow and you say oh this is a good thing you say no it's an outline or it's a prefix or foreshadows it tells me something about what the light is actually shining on and when you think about this a lot of people are dancing in the shadows and a lot of people are excited about Shadows shadows and Silhouettes but we want to be where the light is shining and daning where the light what with in the presence of what the light is shining on so the law was a shadow and I want to say that the sea itself also and I'm just using this beginning part um kind of help me get my legs under me the sea served as an image if it it spoke of something God was very intentional in his creation he had an objective he wanted to bring to pass there's different things that we could speak about the sea and we could just run a concordance search and just read you dozens and dozens of scriptures and quotes about water today and hopefully impress you as you leave but that wouldn't be good at all to do but there was something about the sea that was a a critical but yet now it's not there and I'm say it served its purpose as an image and if I've left you kind of wanting to know a little bit more about the sea maybe we'll come back to it later but I want to look at other Shadows if God could say this about something that covers almost three4 of the earth and is so uh critical to the environment that as we understand it today and I was even reading an article recently how uh even our efforts to reduce uh pollution is causing um temperature sea temperatures to rise because there's no more pollution uh holding back keeping the Sun from reflecting off the ocean and so now now what are you going to do that's interesting but the Seas serve a great purpose but I want to look at other things that God says will be no more in our future home cuz we're not just talking about no more uh sea and all the deep sea fishermen are like we got to fix this what are we going to do and I don't know if there'll be bass in the pure River of Life or not but if it's if it's running cold maybe there can at least be Smallmouth but we're looking at things that God says will be no more in our future home right and in Genesis 1: 16 it says God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also we know that these two great lights we know them as the sun and the moon yes and the sun was to Rule the Day and the moon was to rule the night and this is this is something that you've probably picked up on not hard to pick up on but in Genesis chapter 1 at the beginning it says that God said let there be light in the midst of chaos and darkness and confusion God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and this is before it says in verse 16 that he made two great lights to rule the day and rule the night so there's a lot of in the Hebrew Scholars and ones look at this and they see that maybe it was the shakina glory of God that was expressed in that time and made himself visible and made himself known and so it was the glory of God that was originally lighting the Earth the spirit of God moving upon the face of the waters things happening and transpiring as the light of God was being broadcast and shine upon the Earth in the original and that with that light coming light scatters darkness and it creates this division oh well the Earth was in darkness now now that the glory of God is shining now we know a difference between night and day we can see this in total that the sun is being placed in this position to be the great light to those of us who are here on Earth and this light sunlight's going to Rule the Day and the Moon is to rule the night in the darkness he calls night and brother brah says in the sermon turn on the light I believe it was preached right here in Phoenix the sun is a king of all the lights on this Earth in the natural lights no matter how much artificial light we can have and how many great electric Rays we can produce when that sun rises all the rest of them dim out so even in the Sun God had something that was being expressed this son was the king of all the lights on the earth a lot of other lights and man-made lights and lights in the heavens and there's the light of the Moon and all these different ones but the sunlight is the king light and this is God then in the sun is expressing something God in the stars is expressing something we know the stars were his first Bible that Heavens as we'll come to it here in a moment and we see the sun and the moon we see light and we see day and we see night but in Revelations 21: 23 it says and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof now think of that God in the beginning and and maybe the more that we could read this the more we might begin to think wait a minute he's doing all this stuff over for 6 days and then when we get to the end it's not even going to be there I hope you've heard enough in this series to know that God was putting material out there God was expressing things and showing things in seed form even as Heaven and Earth is embodied in the Garden of Eden and it begins with the garden but when you get to the end there is no Garden that's described doesn't doesn't come back and describe it as a garden or an Eden but we know that what that original Garden that original Eden represented it's now in full bloom the mystery that that was hidden in that Garden is now fully expressed and manifested in the end and so the Bible says the city this New Jerusalem had no need of the sun neither the moon to shine in it but in the beginning God created these two great lights one to rule the day and one to rule the night brother Braham says then the king is that light that will be on top of Mount Zion and His Holy Light will flood the entire city so the sunlight was the king light of all the lights of the Earth the Sun is a king of all the lights and the natural lights and all the other lights dim out in the view of the sunlight H in the natural but now once we get to the New Jerusalem if I could say this and I'm not kind of I hope I'm not stealing my own Thunder but there's no need for types anymore you you don't need the sun shining in that City to tell you that there's a great light or there's a king light you've got the king light could you imagine being in the light of the king and worshiping the son as a God the king is the light of that City so the city will have no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God will lighten it it says in Revelations chapter and I'm going a little in a little bit different order here if you're looking in your Bibles but it just seemed to uh flow this way better for me in verse 25 and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall be no night there now we see in this city there is no sun there's no moon there's no night as we read in Genesis 15 that God called the light day and the Darkness night but now they're gone why are they gone because they were Shadows they were there they were created only as an outline that's good God wanted them to be there so that we could understand some sort of Rhythm he wanted them to be there so that we could understand a certain process and even by virtue of the the sunrise and the sunet it it would tell something someone say oh well isn't that interesting I see it come up in its strength and it comes to its PE Peak and then it's it waines and it gets weaker and it sets it just even in one day it's told the story of a man's life and there's different ways that the the planets and the Sun and all they told time and and determin Seasons but we're not going to worry that's not going to be there anymore we don't need the types we don't need the Shadows we've got the real thing amen oh I I hope that if this is doing anything I hope that it washes us of some of our theological mindsets sometimes where we just love to have our ears itched by types and shadows and not glorying in the real thing that is with us and missing the substance that God has delivered to us it says there'll be no more sun no more moon and the gates of the city will never be shut you know this it's because there's going to be no night there I don't know if uh are 7-Eleven still 24/7 I guess even in it's name it doesn't make sense anymore because I believe it was originally called 711 because it was open from 7eleven and then they became known as the like the original 24/7 and so the New Jerusalem all those are just Shadows of the New Jerusalem which I guess it's not going to be 24/7 because there's not going to be sevens it's not going to be 24s it's just eternity eternity there the city is not going to be shut because there's going to be no night there's no need for Gates why did they have Gates why did they shut down the city for because Darkness fell but now there's not going to be any need anymore in the sermon Redemption by power brother said the Old Testament was a shadow of the New Testament it was the negative like the moon to the sun the sun shining on the moon reflects the light to the Earth that's kind of just showing us how God was using these elements in the sky to speak something and I just love the Old Testament it's just full of Parables like that in Genesis when God made the sun first the moon next the moon and son represents Christ and the church so God had the son in the moon to represent something just as the sun comes up in its power and glory and when it goes down it reflects its light to the moon and in the darkness to give light on the earth why the sun is gone this is just a type that brother B is using Jesus when he left he went into glory and reflected his light back on the church to give the church the light of the Gospel until he returns and they'll get married and then they'll get married now you got to fast forward to the invisible union now and think of this and then they'll get married that'll be wonderful it'll be one great light of moon and and we know it would be the sun when they marri the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun this is now not a division or a separation but what was separated as sun and moon and one reflected the other these are physical things that are used to express a greater truth or greater reality and he's saying now if we have the son and the moon and their types if in reality the two unite together we can't let the Shadows get our mind discombobulate said no no there's got to if there's it's got to be separate you can't have you've always got to have a moon you've always got to Sun have a sun that means you have to you would have to accept a paradigm where the church is never in the presence of the Sun that it would only be reflecting something and the and you are only in the reflection of the church and not Christ that's good and so the alternating brother BR says the lamb is the light thereof they need no more sun in that City it'll be the great light of Moon and Sun and when he says the lamb is the light thereof they'll need no more sun in that City that it's now this is I apologize I've just been uh struggling a lot lately with different things but there's now we can see that what the sun represented that was Christ the moon represents the Bride of the church now they're United together in the reality that God's objective was in the beginning so we don't need the moon to represent every anything the bride is there with her bridegroom we don't need the Sun for light the lamb is the light thereof because it says for the glory of God did light it and the lamb is the light thereof we will have the glory of God through the lamb to lighten us and the bride will be United one with her groom so we don't need the shadow anymore so this alter of night and day as brother bam is using it here it reflected a spiritual pattern on the earth God was using it as an image in Psalms 19 1-6 the heavens declare the glory of God in the firmament showeth his handiwork they they express something about God they tell us something about God it was his first Bible and notice how it says the heavens declar the glory of God but in the new city the glory of God will be declared itself the firmament shows his handiwork but there in this eternal City the lamb is the light thereof but yet here on Earth we see that day andto Day utth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard so the stars are speaking the planets are speaking their line has gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world this is their declaration they're there for all to see and all to hear and God has put it there during in time in the on Earth for man to see that to speak of his greatness to speak of his power it's declaring the glory of God but when we get there you don't need the Heavens to declare it I hope that's making sense maybe it's just too simple today for you their line is gone through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun now you just see a beautiful picture uh being placed that the heavens are going to declare his handiwork and how the there's the the stars are expressing something and even in their own gases allowing the reflection of light and certain things being expressed and even God's Great Beauty and creation and the just how vast these galaxies are it speaks something about God he says but in these Heavens as we hear on Earth in them he set a tabernacle for the sun the sun now is embodied in these great Heavens the heavens are to be tabernacled by the Sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of heaven and a circuit under the ends of it and there's nothing hid from the heat thereof now look at all the types that this writer this pist is being able to express in the the natural orbit of planets and the natural course of the the Earth around the Sun and the rotation of the earth he's saying this speaks something to us it speaks of God's glory and God's handiwork and God has put a tabernacle uh the the heavens as a tabernacle for the sun and the Sun is like the bridegroom uh when the it when it is the rising of the sun it is the bridegroom having come out of his chamber and now he's going to have a circuit he's going to have some sort of course and it's heat is going to have an impact upon the Earth and that heat is going to influence this and it's going to cause this to happen and it cause that to happen and he's using all these natural things and we can say my what a beautiful type and Shadow Hallelujah but we realize that these things just spoke of Christ in John 1:9 speaking of Jesus Christ that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world we have a natural light we have a greater light and a lesser light we have a sun and moon and we're all familiar with it and we can identify it we can see it but yet the this sun this great son was a type of Christ the sunlight was merely a shadow of the True Light that was to come the sun reflected in the natural to us light lifegiving resource and without light nothing can live and and we maybe have a lot of different ways we could describe it but it was there as a placeholder it was there to do things on earth and the natural it was there to sustain life it was there to be used for times and seasons and God had a purpose for that son but when we get to Revelations 21 the city has no need of the sun it has no need of the Moon because the glory of the Lord does light the city and the lamb is the light thereof because Christ is who was reflected the sun was reflecting it was a shadow of the True Light the shadow of the True Light that was to come so there is no more sea there's no more sun there's no more Moon these are things that are just Shadows now I hope that this can serve as a uh foundation for going forward in some things because this is going to give you a lot to think about in Revelations 21:22 he says and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it I want to pause just so you can think about a statement that John just said he sees he's making note he sees everything that is he is witnessing he's making note of things he doesn't see and there's different ways of looking at this especially in the Bible maybe this is a principle that could be helpful there's ways that prophets describe things because they're picturing it it it's not a photograph they're picturing it does that make sense when you picture something you say oh someone describes you go oh you know what I picture that as being like this and so there's times when a prophet is conveying even brother brandham in one place he sees an image so there's something that's pictured he's not seeing a photograph like a driver's license there's an image being projected and he says and and I may get it reversed but he says you're Mrs strong and he corrects himself say I mean Stout because he there in the image BR wasn't looking at a photograph and misread her driver's license as M as Mrs strong but there was a picture he was picturing something and if you pictured something as being Stout you might picture the same thing and say strong right and so John as he's witnessing this that maybe some could argue well he's he's just picturing what this must be like that oh there's going to be no more sea because there's no sin there's no turbulence uh there there's no uh waves and no foaming out but yet go John is describing something that he sees that is beh before him and though there's a lot of symbolism and a lot of ways that he's picturing it he is noting what he does not see or he's using either a picture you want to take it at a photograph it means something he's expressing something and say oh there's no sea oh there's no sun there's no moon the lamb is the light thereof and he says now this would have been a mouthful for a Hebrew there's no Temple there I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it in the sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride if you haven't if you haven't listened to it you should he says all of this Earth this Earth we here live in now everyone whether it be Christian or Pagan has temples if I could just kind of embellish that a little bit every country Every Nation every place you go they all have temples and he said Christian or Pagan I wasn't even I wasn't thinking of this quote but uh just as we pulled in driving up to church today uh we saw temples we see Tabernacles we see churches um all sorts of uh gathering places and in other countries you'll find temples you'll find houses of worship says everywhere you go wherever there's Humanity there's an altar there's a Temple there's a place of worship a place where the deity is represented a place where people can give service to that deity or worship that deity he said do you ever think of that churches all of them but this one doesn't have any I may be giving F to those who don't believe in going to church that just claim they're in the eighth day but he says there's there's no in this one it doesn't have any temples the the Bible says and there was no Temple there but the Lord God in the lamb is the Temple of it he he lamb is the light the lamb is light the lamb is the temple the lamb is the throne the lamb is the life he is that Temple I hope you can kind of catch the rhythm of this a little bit that there was things in the Old Testament brother said were a shadow they were a negative and then when Christ came he was the developed picture he was the substance and so when you go back and you look at the Shadow oh man the Shadow's great oh man the Shadow's beautiful oh man the Shadow the Shadow the Shadow the shadow it's like well I'm standing here the light is shining on me you're looking at my shadow here I am and then all there's so many other things that were set here on Earth as Shadows so many things that just represent something that just show us something we can have a shadow and the shadow testifies that there's light and the shadow also testifies there's something blocking that light but when you get rid of The Shadow you've get you've either come to the object itself or you removed an obstruction and look at he says the lamb is the light the lamb is the temple the lamb is the throne the lamb is the life he is that Temple all these temples have an object they're worshiping but in this city he is the object he is with his people his Spirit Light floods the pyramid City there he's describing it once again how that there will be no need for for the sun because his glory will lighten it'll flood the pyramid City to make this statement so I if I could just reset it there will be no Temple there Christ says the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it the temple is a significant structure in the word of God but from this we could see that God was only using it as a placeholder right amen he was only using it as a type the temple itself even how God arranged it and I I think I could easily just get sidetracked into these details now but he arranged it to tell the story of redemption in Earth and how that uh even that even itself and the way that it was structured was to show Earth the heavens and the holy of holies the heavens of Heavens that and even as they looked at that Veil when you passed through the veil it was as if your passing into heaven itself and so the Tabernacle in the wilderness the temple they were outlined they were arranged to to be an image yes sir to reflect something on Earth to not be a replacement and to not be the end all but to be the thing that could speak of it as he says he ha the heavens declared the glory of God and the firmament show us his hand his handiwork and the Sun is declaring the glory of Christ but the city will have no need of the Sun that means that it served its purpose it it was never to replace God's glory uh the moon was never meant to replace the invisible Union and there's something about those images that once they've served their purpose once they've kind of spoke to you the truth and you can come to the greater reality you want the greater reality so even the temple itself was arranged to tell a story it was just a shadow of heaven right in Hebrews chapter 9: 23 and 24 now if I could I'll say it this way because I I've tried to make this point through several services that now as we have this uh division of dimensions in eternity there's not going to be that division it's just going to be the one Eternal Dimension and however you might want to describe that that collapses and expands and how how let's just say that there's not going to be a trinity below there's not going to be a trinity above there's not going to be the fourth dimension of science there's not going to be di menion of souls waiting under the altar right there's not going to be hell or showel Hades or the grave the Lake of Fire is going to uh eventually just evaporate and it's all going to be gone and so there's only going to be one thing it's called eternity and in Hebrews 9 veres 23 to 24 it says it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these speaking of water but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these recognize what Paul is saying I know I'm jumping into a lot here in Hebrews but the patterns of things he's referring to is the temple the sacrifices the priesthood whether you want to call it the utensils and the clothing everything saying these things were all purified with natural things and these things there were sacrifices made to purify things there was water used to purify things there was ashes that were used in certain ways he says the these things were patterns of things in heaven and they had to be purified but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these in other words we use these elements to purify these things but these things were just a pattern of heavenly things so then he says for Christ has not entered into the holy Place made with hands he didn't have to enter into the temple he didn't have to go in behind the veil if he would have he would have been like where is it right there was no Ark of the Covenant there's no blood on The Mercy Seat because Christ didn't enter into into the type he didn't enter into the shadow he didn't enter into the pattern Christ entered into it says here which are he doesn't enter into the place made with hands which are figures of the true but he entered into heaven itself what the the Earthly Tabernacle was a shadow of the Heavenly Temple the Earthly Tabernacle was a shadow of the Heavenly realm Christ didn't have to enter into the shadow he entered into the real and there appeared in the presence of God for us and so when it says that Christ entered into heaven itself and not the holy Place made with hands or the patterns of things that are in heaven or so the patterns of the figures the figures there in the Greek is the antitype and so the antitype so you have type and antitype the type is the shadow talking about shadows and types the type is well that's a type of this and that's a type of that and that's a and whenever you have a type you don't ever start with the type you start with the truth that's where you want to start if you can is don't just start figuring out things and say well they walked around Jericho uh seven time what seven times and so I got to do seven of these and kind of come up with these different types and things that's just where you get some really interesting stuff but if there's a type or there's a Shadow you really don't know what it is until you know the truth well that's a shadow of something okay yeah it's a shadow of something but what is it and we're all just playing uh the blot game all right with the ink blot we're just looking at the roar Shack test what do you see well right and we're just all trying to tell you what we see we want to know the real and here he saying the patterns the things on earth were a pattern the holy place on Earth was a figure yes they were types but now Heaven itself is the antitype right and an antitype in the scripture brother B uses the phrase antitype but it speaks of the greater reality to which the type points catch this please the antitype is the greater reality to which the type was pointing and which in which the type is fulfilled right that's good that I if someone says I'm a type I'm a type that means you're you're only part you're only an outline you're only a sketch and it's great to have the type but the sh Shadow only means there's an object and there's a light shining on the object and I want to know whether the object is the real thing or just an obstruction from the light so when you come to the antitype you have what the shadow spoke of because there in it the it's the greater reality so you have the greater reality to which the type pointed or you have the object that the shadow was created by it so a type is a person a place an event in Scripture if we look at types there PL persons places events or things that have a historical reality we see a type it has some sort of historical reality but is also designed by God to foreshadow something or prefigure something a real person event a place or thing so the temple was a type the temple was a shadow it has historical reality out of Egypt have I called my son you say oh well that was when he called Israel out of Egypt but that was historical reality but it was a shadow and type of Christ coming out of Egypt you catch that and I realized that there was a lot of just simple fundamentals today that was either review for you or maybe just good good things to put in our toolbox a little bit to understand the word of God as we study the message of the hour as we pray and read our Bibles so I know some of this is just kind of granular fundamental things but in that now let's just take that principle that God will use a person place thing or an event as a type meaning he wants to use it though it has a historical reality in existence God's designed it or allowed it to foreshadow or prefigure something else and that is exactly what the temple represented the Bible says the Lord is in his holy Temple and the Lord's Throne is in heaven and to a Jew they would just say no it's a it's the Tabernacle on Earth it's the temple on Earth but the Lord is in his holy Temple and the Lord's Throne is in heaven brother BR said everything in the earth is just a pattern of that which is in heaven to the Hebrews the Jewish writers I going back over many different things on this subject they say the structure of the Tabernacle corresponds to the structure of Heaven and Earth so the Tabernacle was a pattern of things in Heavens the temple was a tab a pattern of things in heaven the holy of holies was a figure of the real thing when Moses was making the Tabernacle in the wilderness in Exodus 25: 8 and9 and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them the Lord is in his holy Temple the Lord's Throne is in heaven there's a place that God is and now he's saying this is this is my or this is my where I am originally but make me a place on Earth let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them so the temple was going to represent God's dwelling place on Earth amongst his people he says according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it now what was the pattern that God was going to show him the Lord is in his holy Temple the Lord's Throne is in heaven so this is where God dwelt this is the original and now he said would you make me a a sanctuary on Earth I'll show you the pattern I'll show you the blueprint I'll show you my Holy Temple in heaven I'll show you my Thro in heaven and that'll give you the design for how this is to be copied on Earth so the Earthly Tabernacle and the Earthly Temple were copy or shadow of the temple in heaven Revelations 11:19 says and the temple of God was opened in heaven and in his Temple the Ark of his Testament so we see then that what was built on Earth wasn't first it was first in heaven and we could say that the what was on Earth is a shadow it's a type it has historical reality but it doesn't necessarily mean that the exact image in heaven has to be specifically and exactly like what's here on Earth it represents something just in the absorption of light and the refle refraction and how the pattern the silhouette can hide a lot of images can hide a lot of details you can see you can see a figure or an outline in a shadow and it can tell you something but it's not going to tell you everything that you need to know I wish I had some of brother Lonnie's transparencies right now I could do a lot of Shadow stuff I need his overhead projector first right that's that's what's missing is that you can't find the bulbs anymore so it says the temple of God was opened in heaven in Revelations 15 it says the temple the Tabernacle the testimony in heaven was opened these are things in heaven right originally and I I hope you could follow this because there's things I hope you're connecting yourself in this and I have a lot of hopes this morning that if it's in heaven and now it's on Earth this is the shadow but when we come when we come to the eighth day and we come to the new Heaven and new earth there there is no more Temple that we see on Earth and there is no more other dimension of heaven where the Lord's Throne is and where the Lord is in his holy Temple that's with man now so you have to have that in mind I I so for this to really be connecting it says in Hebrews chapter 8:5 speaking again of the the priesthood and the service in the temple who serve under the example and Shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle what did God tell him to do don't make it with your ideas of what you saw in Babylon don't do with what you saw in Egypt don't do it in the pattern of what other people in the world would do or what you would in your mind like but but I'll show you an image in heaven and that's the pattern that I want you to replicate on Earth so he made a tabernacle and put people in service on Earth to serve as an example and a shadow of heavenly things because God admonished him see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount and that's just drawing from Exodus 25 it was Moses making the temple after the pattern that was in heaven now this Temple means so much on Earth it means so much even to where is a very symbol to the Jews when a tabernacle was being rebuilt and being restored and it has such significance but now in Revelations 21:22 and I saw no Temple therein think of everything that this Temple meant to a Jew when you're in distress in a foreign land just turn your face toward the temple and pray and I will hear and for a Judah said now which way would I need to face where do I need to turn where where do I need to point my eyes cuz if I will just do these things God has said that he'll hear and and it had such significance the temple they came back to Jerusalem three times a year to worship it was required to do it come back to the temple come back to the temple come back to the temple and it becomes a great dispute uh even when Jesus meets the woman at the well says well you guys say that we need to worship here or we worship in Jerusalem and we can worship in the mountains and you know what Jesus says he doesn't say you better believe it you got to come to Jerusalem he says the time is coming and now is and he doesn't say anything about going to Jerusalem he just says you're going to have to Worship in spirit and Truth The Very things that spoke of the Tabernacle spoke of the very things the temple spoke of the very witness of it he's saying you can now Worship in spirit and truth you don't have to go to Mecca you don't have to go to Jeffersonville every Easter to be in the bride you're in the presence of Christ right now amen you don't have to go to Mecca you don't have to go to the whing wall God has by the way of Jesus Christ abolished the veil and took away the geographical requirement because he says there is no Temple for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it there's no Temple because the temple was a type of Christ Israel is a type of Heaven Jerusalem was a type of of of the of the the temple and here Christ Christ is on Earth so now Heaven is on Earth he's telling the woman at the well the time is coming I when God you'll have to Worship in spirit and in truth not in the mountains not in Jerusalem but in spirit and truth and that's how you worship God that's how the true worshippers will worship him because the temple is the type of Christ in Colossians 216 and 17 says let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a holy day or of the new moon or of the Sabbath days that that puts a lot of stuff in view he says which are a shadow of things to come the the moons the festivals the holy days the Sabbath days all these elements in the law in the Tabernacle in the temple in the Levites in the priesthood and all the utensils in all the ceremony and all the service it was there as a shadow of things to come he says but the body is of Christ in other words the substance is is of Christ Christ is the substance of those things he says oh don't get don't man let men judge you in meat and drink and holy day and New Moon and Sabbath days CU those spoke of Christ Christ is the anti-type Christ is the object Christ is the light Christ is the one that those spoke of they were the Shadows Christ is the substance brother Bram said it was a shadow until the real came along these things were shadow shs now in Christ there's no more Shadow there's no more going to the temple three times a year and offering up sacrifices and Performing our worship during these feast days now in Christ he's abolished that now we've entered into our rest Christ is our Sabbath there was a Saturday that typed it but now we don't have to wait till Saturday we have them now he is our rest amen the Bible says in John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh dwelt among us this is Christ the temple this is Christ the son the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and John says and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth we beheld his glory as the light that lighted the Earth in the beginning when God said let there be light now when Christ comes the prophecy is that great light will spring up to those who are in the regions of Darkness Darkness now the True Light that lights all men had come the light had come there was the sun reflected as now the sun is here and we beheld his glory the glory of God that would have lightened the Earth but this is also the glory of God that would have filled the temple in Exodus 40 the cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle here's the glory Lord it was and it's remarkable how the scriptures speak of it and that there's the glory of the Lord fills the Tabernacle and they're not even able to perform their service cuz it's so great in First Kings chapter 8 in the dedication of the temple that the priest had come out of the Holy place and the cloud filled the house of the Lord so the priest could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord so Moses made a tabernacle where God would dwell among his people Solomon built a temple where God would dwell among his people and God declared his presence by his glory filling the house and John says we beheld the glory of God what was this testifying of the temple was Christ you don't have to go to Jerusalem that was a shadow the glory of God filled the shadow but now Christ is the body the glory of God was in Jesus Christ he was the true Temple that the old Temple pointed to and since the true sacrifice had come what the Old Testament sacrifices pointed to the moons and the feast days and the Sabbath days all these things were Shadows of heavenly things they were a pattern in heaven but now that Christ has come Christ is the body yes sir there's no need of the old Temple there's no need of that old altar but it says the Lord the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord the house of the Lord in the house of God is always referred to as the temple in the Old Testament because God I guess this speaks to how the I the picture that I see and why I've been ministering along these lines and making some of these same statements is God's in heaven we're on Earth and then there are certain things that are temporary here as types and shadows and then once they're kind of done away with we're left with you better have lived right because if you didn't you're not going to heaven you're going to hell and you'll come across it over and over and over again eternal hell Eternal Heaven The Souls of men are Eternal and you just choose which way where you want to spin eternity and that's a lie of the devil because there is no eternal hell and because it misses the concept of redemption there is no eternal hell because there's no Redemption for those in hell so there's no eternity there's no Eternal purpose in that so this is where you see God now creates a tabernacle has them build a tabernacle on Earth and it's going to reflect the Lord who is in his temple in heaven the Lord's Throne is in heaven but now he has a house and he wants it modeled in earth right he wants it built on earth Isaiah 66:1 thus sayith the Lord the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol where is the house that you'll build unto me and where is the place of my rest the way that God created in the beginning with this expanse of Dimensions with angels and Realms and kingdoms it's all it's placed within this aspect of time to tell his story to accomplish an objective and then once he's accomplished it there's going going to be a removing of things that are no longer necessary there's going to be fulfillment of Shadows and types and there's only going to be one thing that remains so he says the heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol but where is my house and in Hebrews it says when he cometh into this world he says sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me we're looking at how that now God prepared himself a body in the form of the Lord Jesus Christ and the glory of the Lord would be declared in a pillar in a cloud and then it would be expressed through through through certain ways in the temple in the Tabernacle but now now in Christ all the fullness of God dwells in Christ and this is the place of his rest he didn't find rest in the Tabernacle necessarily he didn't find in the temple it was foreshadowed but now this is whom I am pleased to dwell in for the Bible says for in him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead bodily this is Jesus Christ the house of God am the temple of God was Jesus Christen even then we could say there was no more Shadow right and what what what's expressed by that there's no more Shadow there was no longer a need for circumcision Paul is wrestling with these ideas of trying to pull people back into Shadows pull people back into shadows and Paul's defense was that was true that was legit straight up all right there was nothing wrong with that but that was speaking of this and if you have this why would you want to go back to that if you can have the real deal this testify to the real deal I said no well I mean you're just you're just like looking at a picture you can have the real thing you're trying to imagine a warm fire by looking at that painted fire this is the real thing it was a way of saying you're not wrong in what you believe you're not wrong in what you did but th that ceremony those figures all those things were just pointing and so Christ was the temple he was a sacrifice I've gone I thought I was going to be finished like 30 minutes ago so I started vamping a little bit but I I need like the head heads up whenever the food's done I'm just waiting for like the 40 door Dash trucks to pull up and bring us all of our fries chicken or whatever it is we're eating Hallelujah now this is a hard turn here but now the house of God and now the temple refers to his church right which is the body of Christ 1 Corinthians 6:19 what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you not your own now where is the temple where's the throne as we mentioned before where is the Tabernacle in you why would there be a temple there for you to go to to worship God when God is in you why would you need a temple and a tabernacle to perform service and a priesthood Minister service when the sacrifice himself is there the lamb and his bride when we have the Fulfillment of all things and that perfect Eternal Kingdom why would you need the types why would you need the Shadows it's only going to be substance there Amen brother B says Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest was man the temple the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was man the temple you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost no more Shadows when you think of that no more Shadows why is there not going to be a temple because the temple what it represented is in you in Christ God tabernacled in the lamb God tabernacled in his bride God has become this eternal uh people and God is resident in man it's not God dwelling with man in a temple not God dwelling with Man Behind Badger skins not God dwelling with man behind the the Veil in a temple or Tabernacle it's God now embodied made real in the lamb in The Bride for all eternity and the glory of the Lord through you amen and so I'll close with this the Bible says in Numbers chapter 14: 21 I have several scriptures I could use here I'm just going to use this one are we smelling anything yet already starting to set stuff up my stomach's starting to growl my lisp is getting really bad say but as I but as truly as I live this is God speaking now Hallelujah but as truly as I live all the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord I love how he says it as truly as I live God swears an oath and he swears by himself cuz he could not swear by any greater than the Earth will be filled with his glory and he doesn't just say one part of the earth he doesn't just say Arizona Believers Church it doesn't say brandom Tabernacle it doesn't say the Holy Temple the bright age seven steps to the king's chamber.com Fellowship I don't he says all the Earth will be filled oh I swear as I live all the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord amen he's saying I swear an oath though the glory of the Lord may have come down and be seen in the temple and the glory of the Lord came down upon a Mountaintop and the glory of the Lord came down in the Tabernacle and the glory of the Lord was seen Upon Jesus Christ he says all the Earth all the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord now real quick just think what God does to the Earth God does to his people if there's a pattern of redemption for the Earth then there's a pattern of redemption for me and he says that all the Earth shall be filled f with the glory of the Lord hallelujah let this Earth be filled we'll pick up on that later musicians if you'd come in Revelations 21:4 there's a few more things that aren't going to be there anymore God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death there shall be no more sorrow there shall be no more C crying neither shall there be any more pain Hallelujah there will be no more death there will be no more sorrow there will be no more crying and there will be no more pain for the former things are passed [Music] away Hallelujah verse one said the former Heaven and Earth pass away and we know that means it's transformed into an image that it foreshadowed it was embodied in it it had something contained in it it's completely renovated it's redeemed it comes back and it exist in its original how God originally wanted it to be and it says Heaven and Earth shall pass away the former Heaven and Earth pass away but now it says the former things are passed away but it's a different phrase that's used it's a stronger phrase phrase is used in verse one to speak of something even the coming or the arrival of something the way that it's structured to say that you know this Earth You you thought you always knew now here's the real me the heaven you thought you always knew now that here's the real heaven and it was always there we just didn't see it it just had to go through a process to get there just like you when you were born down inside of you was a germ of God and we never really see that until you're born again and we begin to learn the real you the one that God thought of in the beginning and so pass away of the Heaven and Earth is to be changed and changed from one state to another but when it said the former things are passed away about these things it uses a much stronger phrase because it doesn't want you to think that pain will exist in another form right doesn't want you to think that sorrow will exist in another form or that death will exist in other form it says no it is going to be gone and it means to depart to go away death mourning sorrow go away all together it will not be in any shape or form you know it's no more Shadows no more types I think it's beautiful to think that God uses pain without pain no gain right and we God uses suffering and he uses sorrow and he uses all these things uh to work on our character and to teach us things and we can see that death sorrow crying and pain all have some use and utility or some expression in Earth but it won't be worth it there it won't be used there it won't be needed there it would just be gibberish it wouldn't make sense it would have no basis it would be Insanity so it's gone forever no more Shadows no shadow of death no shadow of Sorrow no shadow of crying no shadow of pain Shadows are powerful things no doubt that maybe some of you sitting here today felt your phone vibrate and you don't even have your phone on you it's a shadow there's people that have limbs amputated they'll have their their foot cut off and they'll have their foot will itch and their toes will itch you'll be like uh you ain't got no toes like I feel it though it's like Phantom and shadows you're not going to have any of that there aren't you tired of the Shadows I amen but there's times when Shadows come back around you know what causes Shadows to go away light and that's what I want right now in my life is light I want to chase away shadows and complexes and scars I want to chase away pain I want it to chase away sorrow I want it to ultimately chase away death do you want it to happen for you you want the light to shine oh sometimes we dance and we shout and we sing and we whistle because we're walking through the graveyard at night I don't want to do that I don't want the shadow I don't want to worship the figure I want the body which is Christ why would you go back to the shadow when the reality is now brother brandham says in Shalom God who made the promise in the last days these things would happen that we see happen I love this message the the vindications of it the historical reality of it all those things let's not lose sight of it don't get distance from The Voice I tell you one sure way for you to all of a sudden get that pay of doubt and fear is to cause the voice of God to become unfamiliar to you and the the voice of the doubter or the skeptic or the world to become more familiar and then they'll say something that be has more of a familiarity to it and then when you listen to the voice it's lost its familiarity right don't get away from this message you better be listening to it studying it amen obeying it am he said if he promised a son and the sun came if he promised all these things that we see through the scripture and it did let's get into the rhythm of it I he's saying some heavy things here in Shalom if he promised the Son and the sun came let's get into the rhythm of it let's get in the rhythm of redemption get into the rhythm of the word promised in the last days these things would take place and we see it he promised that he would send Jesus Hallelujah get in the rhythm of it it is the rising of the sun there is a man here who could turn on the light it's not in the Tabernacle it's not in the temple it's Christ the word now made flesh in you he says hallelujah there will be a millennium there will be a new day there will be a day that the sun will never go down no more we'll need it no more for the lamb is the light of the city that we're going to recognize what he's saying there will be a millennium there will be a new day there will be a City without the Sun for the lamb will be the light thereof the dawning of a new day I feel it all over me now Hallelujah I feel it all over me now the light of a new day the light of a day where there is no night there is no Darkness there is no Shadows no Skies no dim Dark Skies no midnights no Graves no flowers on hillsides no funeral possessions no doctors sorry no morgs amen I can feel the Rays of his light breaking through upon my soul hallelujah what does this mean what does this mean no more Shadows I feel the Light breaking in on my soul the new day the old one is pressing away as I feel mortal blood pouring through my body I feel the surge of the Holy Ghost coming behind rise and shine why for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord shall be seen upon thee Hallelujah let there be no more Shadows yes let's feel the light of a new day pressing in upon us all my complexes all my scar s all my Shadows may they flee away let's pray together as you stand your feet
