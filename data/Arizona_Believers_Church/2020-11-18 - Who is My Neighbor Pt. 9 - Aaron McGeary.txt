TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so this is John 4 uh: 4- 26 and he must needs go through Samaria then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called sikar near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there so it's giv you kind of the context of the land and and the and the location some which are significant to the Jews but you'll find that these things are brought up later so the one writing this uh is giving us tremendous context for what happens and it says and Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus at on the well and it was about the sixth hour there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew asketh drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritan Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it was that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water the woman saith unto him sir thou Hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast said well thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou Hast five husbands and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that sest thou truly the woman saith un him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus saith unto Heroman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jew but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him I know that the that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he amen you may may be seated we're continuing on the subject that we've been ministering on uh on Wednesday nights on who is my neighbor and we're taking this subject from Luke chapter 10 where Jesus is asked of the lawyer what can I do to have eternal life and then in answering the question Jesus asked him a question what does the law say and then he says to love the Lord thy God and then to love thy neighbor as thyself and then Jesus said thou has said well do this and you shall live and then the lawyer trying to wanting to justify himself says well then who is my neighbor and then Jesus gives the parable that we're familiar with called the parable of the Good Samaritan and he uses a man who's been Fallen upon by thieves he's left half dead uh he's they have been robbed of his possessions then a priest comes by goes to the other side then a levite comes by kind of looks at him goes to the other side and then a Samaritan happens by and it's the Samaritan that reach es out and uh ministers to him and then in Luke 10:36 Jesus says which now of these three and I may seem like I'm just jumping right into this and I am he says which of these three thinkest thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and so he's asking the question a little bit differently and I want to emphasize that here in a moment and then the lawyer answers and he says he that showed Mercy on him and it's remarkable that Jesus refers to a priest he refers to a levite and then he uses the designation Samaritan now if Jesus had phrased this in such a way to it was the priest or the levite that had done well then it's no doubt that this lawyer would have said well the priest or he would have said the levite but Jesus using the Samaritan as an example it just exposes further the the Prejudice that was in the lawyer's heart of the bigotry that was there you want to call it racism bias whatever you want to call it but it exposed it still yet in his heart because instead of saying the Samaritan he says he that showed Mercy on him almost not even willing himself to phrase form the word Samaritan then said Jesus unto him go and do thou likewise so he's Jesus had made his point the lawyer is brought to that place where he acknowledges that the Samaritan is the one who showed uh who was uh neighbor to him that fell among Thieves and Jesus affirms it go and do thou likewise I what I want to begin to this evening with is pointing out that Jesus rephrases the question that the lawyer asked in verse 29 the lawyer asked and who is my neighbor so that's it's an asking uh who who Who's My Neighbor so you might expect perhaps an answer of a a person or a nomination of some sort and so the lawyer wants to know who do I owe the duty of loving as myself not necessarily what the duty entailed he he might have known enough to know that that's going to get me in trouble but maybe if I I could just split hairs at who's my neighbor then I can be a Justified because he's seeking to justify himself and that's why he makes the statement uh well who is my neighbor and so he wants to know who do I have to love as myself not what does it mean to love and so Jesus instead of just simply saying well everyone's your neighbor regardless of religion regardless of race regardless of background regardless of past uh uh everyone's your neighbor Jesus uses this Parable to amplify the truth and we've already seen how the law is what told made it incumbent upon the the Jews uh to behave a certain way towards the stranger and towards the Heathen towards the Gentile that the law didn't make a distinction and when if your neighbor's livestock got loose you should go and take it whether they be a stranger whether they be the Jew and you should return it unto them so they were already Bound by the law and we know Jesus comes and he gives the parable not just to quickly answer the question but to amplify the real meaning meaning and truth behind the law in Isaiah 42: 21 it says the Lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honorable this is a prophecy of Christ that he will he will magnify the law and make it honorable he will he will bring out the real life of it he'll bring out the truth of it he will he will really make it effective and then also make it honorable because it says in Psalms 11912 6 it is time for thee Lord to work for they have made void thy law so if you see in the Old Testament a prophecy of Christ that he'll magnify the law he'll make it honorable and now in Psalms 119 which is a Psalm which just continues to lift up the word and the law of the Lord he says it's time for you to work Lord because they have made the law void in other words they've made it without real effect they've taken the the true intent of it or the it doesn't it doesn't serve the purpose or meet the purpose that it originally was intended though it may seem like they're fulfilling the law they've stripped it of the life of it and the purpose of it so the law was made void they had made it dishonorable they had had diminished it and so Jesus comes and when he gives this Parable he's in the office of one that magnifies the law in Mark 7: 13 Jesus says this about the the Jews about the the elders and the Pharisees and he says you're making he says making the word of God of none effect you're nullifying the authority of the word through your tradition so by even by making the word a tradition you nullify the effect of it there there's nothing that we do as Christians that we ought to do traditionally and that goes for all of our Traditions feet washing and communion should not be done traditionally though we could say it's a tradition uh water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is not a tradition a coming to church is not a tradition though it may seem we do these things traditionally if you just do do it as tradition and as he says here you've made the word of God nullified without authority of no effect through your tradition which you have delivered or handed down if we're merely just handing down traditions and that's what keeps the church going then really the words not have an effect amen it's more a cultural code it's more discipline it's more getting everybody to agree and Ascent to a particular way that we ought to conduct ourselves and live and so he's saying you've made the word of God taking the authority out of it just by making things tradition or by their Traditions which deated from the word and then they're passed down he says and many such like things do ye so this is Jesus identifying that the the law had lost its full force and effect in Matthew 5:1 17 he says think not that I'm come to destroy the law or the prophets I am come not I am not come to destroy but to fulfill so he wasn't doing away with the law he's fulfilling the law he's not watering down the law even even more and saying this isn't important or that isn't important but he's come he came to accomplish the real purpose of the law he wanted to show you what it was actually he's going to bring the law to the place where it accomplishes even what it was intended or better yet what it was foreshadowing because the law without Christ could not make you perfect the blood of bulls the blood of goats and all those ceremonial sacrifices pointed to one that would come and all the law pointed to an inward Holiness that Christ would accomplish for us so it stood for something he said I'm not come to do do away with it I'm coming to magnify it to complete it and to fulfill it and so by way of example Jesus in Matthew Chapter 5 later on in that very same chapter he says I don't come to uh do away with it I come to fulfill it he uses the example he says that if you if you're angry with your brother without cause uh that's that's that's murder and so he begins to amplify that it's more there's more to what the law meant when these things were given and he uses this in verses 27 and 28 he says you have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you now he not doing away with the law but magnifying it he's amplifying the law he says but I say to you that whosoever lookth on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart now when you ponder it from this perspective this using this particular scripture that Jesus is not doing away with the law but he's there's something that's being magnified in it or being Amplified in it was the Prohibition against adultery merely there to to bind to keep one from committing the act or did it actually speak to the fact that you ought to be pure in your thoughts amen that your thought life should be pure and that this is not something you should desire something uh not that you would something you wouldn't even flirt with it's something you wouldn't even entertain it's like you wouldn't say well it's just once I get to this place then I'm guilty no it stood for something greater like this is something that you may say well the act itself is prohibited but anything that would lead to it anything that would be akin to it anything that would uh would be a sister to it you want to avoid that you want to leave it alone and you'll find that throughout history especially within the Christian church where people have flirted with that and thought that they could dilly dally in all different areas and and venture out into certain things and and make light of the Gospel in certain areas they eventually succumb to these very things because they miss the real thrust and purpose of the rule of the law to begin with amen and so when he says that if a man looks upon a woman he's really getting down to the real what the law signified this is where it begins is in the heart and so he says I'm telling you that if a man looks upon a woman and lust after her he's already committed the act in his heart so when Jesus begins to give the parable instead of just saying well everyone's your neighbor he wanted he used the parable and in using the parable he really Amplified I or magnifies the law and and identifies how the Jews had watered down the word of God to where it had no effect this had become maybe a point of a point of national pride and religious zealousness where we're Jews and we're pure and we go all the way back to Abraham and they were using that as a means to exclude ones from fellowship exclude ones um from charity and exclude ones from being treated just decently and so the spirit or the purpose of the law was missed uh through their own human ISM as Jesus said the traditionalism and even through legalism binding people to do it without an understanding and without without Grace and we could we could challenge ourselves with those very things uh without going further we could just stay right within that view and challenge ourselves do we impose things on others out of legalism not recognizing that it's the grace of God that leads one to repentance that's the grace of God in our lives that leads us Beyond repentance to the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the grace of God in us to both will and to do that it's God that's doing these things and then we have conviction the holy spirit's bringing things to pass in our lives and the the word is being brought to pass and then we can be very quick to forget the grace that's in our lives and then oppose by law some the same thing on somebody else so it really challenges us to not make the word of n effect if God has done a work of Grace in your life and it's the evidence of the Holy Ghost working through you and you've uh you've obtained victories and seen yourself delivered and the family is coming in order and God's doing something tremendous in your life whatever you do don't turn around and take that work of God that he's done by grace and you and then begin to judge others legalistically by it if there's a standard being raised in your home if there's a if there's a standard being lifted up in your life if there's victories then don't begin to look at others who haven't experienced that and look down on them judge them say oh well they just haven't walked as high as I've walked be very very careful cuz you could even lose the victory amen because you because you've taken the word of God into an area where now you're expecting them to live it either by your example or by law what you weren't able to live without God's grace and there's other ways that whether it be humanism or just making things traditional it can it can lose the real meaning of it and I'm so we could be challenged just in that part alone but I want to go further in this because the question that Jesus asked is who do you think was neighbor unto him that fell among Thieves in other words who fulfilled the duty one owes to a neighbor and it it's it continues to strike me how the question's different the lawyer says who is my neighbor Jesus asked which of the three was neighbor to the one who fell among Thieves and it's almost as if saying who was the the victim's neighbor but you realize it goes both ways I know that we we have uh times in our lives where someone says well you're my best friend you go well you're but you're not my best friend right we all laugh because that was a long time ago I hope I hope but we've had those scenarios well I'm their friend but they're not really my friend but if it's neighbor it works both ways I can't be your neighbor but you're not my neighbor right in other words you owe a duty to me but I don't owe a duty to you so really Jesus is asking which one was neighbor to him that fell among Thieves in other words who showed the kindness that would be appropriate for a neighbor who expressed the proper actions of a neighbor who fulfilled the duty if a neighbor had a duty which one if there was something that a neighbor would do to somebody of these three men which did the neighborly thing and so the parable not only identifies because he gives so much detail to it to it it not only identifies who the neighbor was but how he loved his neighbor as himself so Jesus did just didn't say uh uh everyone and he didn't just give a parable that would cause him to quickly choose among three different people but he actually identified ifed who the neighbor was and how his actions fulfilled loving his neighbor as himself and in doing this we've identified this or we've said this actually a number of times through the first several parts in this he's stripping away all the pretense of this lawyer he's taken all his hypocrisy and he's challenging this lawyer with the example of the Samaritan the lawyer would identify with the priest identify with the levite here's a Jew and he's a lawyer he's one that identifies with the law would know the law very very well and Jesus uses the parable and using the priest as an example it strips a little of that pretense away from this lawyer using the levite as an example it strips it down even further and really attacks his hypocrisy and challenges him now not with a priest who's doing better a Jew who's doing better or someone of his own Kindred in nation who's who is U bringing the law to life and doing what he ought to do but rather a Samaritan to do it and so he's really challenged this lawyer and so if you want to look look at verse 33 Luke 10:33 I'm just going to go through these different parts the Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him and it may touch a little bit on the compass compassion but I just want to walk through this Peace by peace and it says in Luke chap 10:33 I'll just read it and then come back but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him this is the one that the lawyer said had mercy on him and so Jesus says but a certain Samaritan remember Jesus is very purposeful in the language that he uses very deliberate in the in the phrasing and the situation and a Samaritan I as I Ponder this and look at it historically look at it within the text Jesus is using the Samaritan as a way to overcome any objection in other words this the Jew could not sense obligation to a neighbor because of his nationality he couldn't be feel feel he has a duty to his neighbor because of his religion and he couldn't exempt himself from a duty because of hatred or bitterness or animosity or any kind of prejudice and or or any kind of experience wherein maybe I've had a bad experience with those people and I've had a bad experience with church and I've had a bad experience with this and that and uh and and I had that happened to me one time I was sitting down it's actually a pretty funny story but I'd preached some meeting somewhere and it was June but it felt like the dead of February to me and so after the meetings were over they had a picnic and I had a touque on and I was all bundled up sitting by a little campfire they were doing this was in Canada if he had figured that out already and the coldest uh coldest winter I ever had was a a summer in Grand Prairie amen and so it uh and I was just kind of sitting there slouched in a lawn chair and had a touque on and somebody had invited a coworker uh to church or to church to the meetings well they never showed up for the meetings but they showed up for the picnic and they show up at the picnic and they're kind of they're just there and they're they're you know this worldly guy looking around like man look at all these Christians like who man who's safe here and he sees this Thug sitting there by the campfire you know with the touque on all slouched in the chair he's like oh this guy he's safe so he sits next to me and he sits next to me he's kind of like man these guys man he's like like so you know he's kind of I said so do you go to church oh Church man come on he's like there's too much hypocrisy in church and I thought oh man this is going to be fun and uh I I let him have it I really really did but what I identified was how could I said what what does that have to do with you what does that make you if the Hypocrites keep you out of church wait a minute can I can I choose my seat again you know what what's going on here well I I'm happy to report I don't think the person's missed a service since then went to the next church service got bapt AP ized married the piano player and now he's the pastor of the church this happened over several years maybe like 15 years or something like that or more but that that was just the grace of God but sometimes you've got to overcome hypocrisy and realize look just because somebody has done something just because there's been an offense just because people have acted a certain way doesn't nullify truth amen if you've been abused abused by Ministry doesn't mean Ministries all wrong if you've had bad Church experiences doesn't mean you you can stay at home and still be a Christian and so Jesus is using this example and uses it in such a way to any objection that this lawyer would have Jesus one by one has just nailed him just like he did with the the Rich Young Ruler he found the one thing in his heart Lord I've I've I've committed all I've kept all these things from my youth I've done everything you've asked me to do from my youth and he says and here I am uh having committed done all these things since my youth and Jesus says all right okay now I know where you're at and he found the one thing he couldn't let go of he found the one thing that would become problematic to him so here Jesus is doing the same thing when he brings up the example of the Samaritan this is what we've mentioned this several times that there's enity that existed between the Jews and the Samaritans right it's we shouldn't just think of like well the Pharisees or excuse me the Philistines or the Egyptians this is a very unique rivalry between the Samaritans and the Jews and their National Pride on the Jews part and even national pride on the Samaritan's part and religious Prejudice on both parts created this hostility between the two of them and they weren't and we'll just maybe amplify this more they weren't hostile to each other because of they were so different they were hostile to each other because they had many similarities and that's what really created the conflict is they had so many things in common but yet the differences is what made them hate each other and very hostile to each other but it was aggravated by the fact that seem to be so many different similarities to him as we read in John 4:9 as Jesus asked for a drink and notice he says give me to drink and then the woman says notice just how immediately she says then sayith the woman of Samar Samaria so here's a Samaritan woman how is it that thou being a Jew asketh drink of me which a is a woman which am a woman of Samaria this was not common there would have not been this kind of interaction for a Jew to ask Samaritan get me a drink now you could say that it's Prejudice you could say it's racism you could say it's because uh there's a lot of different ways or misogyny but really at the end of the day you look at it and say a Jew would have known better probably than to ask a Samaritan woman for a drink get it yourself it just would have been this there would have been no respect there would have been no Accord and she's immediately shocked by the boldness of this man to say give me a drink because she says the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans in other words we're off limits you don't talk to us and in the history of it though the Samaritans as we'll see in a moment were antagonistic towards the Jews the Jews were much more antagonistic against the Samaritans they hated them they belittled them and she's like hey the Jews don't have dealings with Samaritans they wouldn't ask a Samaritan for help they wouldn't ask a Samaritan to do something for him this is not something that's normal and actually the term Samaritan would have been a byword for a Jew in other words it would have been an insult and they Ed the phrase Samaritan for someone who was a her IC or someone who is evil you say well you're just a Samaritan in the same way that we might use an insult or a bad word or slang today to like criticize somebody or cut somebody down Samaritan was a a cut down in those days you called somebody a cut down those were fighting Samaritan those were fighting words and maybe that was the real dig at a Jew say well you're just acting like a Samaritan wait a minute what do you mean I'm acting like a Samaritan them's fighting words and so she this this word Samaritan she identified her S as a Samaritan but to a Jew a Samaritan was were were low people and the in 2 Kings 17: 24 kind of gives you the history of where these Samaritans began and the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon and from CA and from Ava and from hameth and some saffrin and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel so he took all these people from these different places Babylon and aan these different places and put them in Samaria instead of placing Jews there and placing Israel there in Samaria he brought all these other people into this place and they possessed Samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof so these people come je Gentiles and these other races of people not Jews not of Israel they come to this place called Samaria and they become a very unique group of people because here they are in this this land called Samaria and they're inhabiting it and then Through Time one of samalot sons I believe he was a priest he gets exiled from Israel uh because of the marriage and and Josephus goes through this in great detail and he goes to Samaria and there's several hundred Jews because of their wickedness that are kind of exiled from Judea and they come to this place of Samaria and so they begin to mix with the inhabitants of Samaria so Samaritans through hundreds of years became became a mixed race they weren't entirely uh Gentile they weren't entirely Jew and as being a mixed race and even if you continue to read here in 2 Kings 17 you'll find that they tried to bring them to Godly worship and they accepted the Lord in 2 Kings 17 they believed in the Lord but they retained their Idols so you'll find there's always this interesting hybrid with the Samaritans that they there's a part of them that is not Jew but there's a part of them that is there's a part of them that honors the Lord but a part of them that wouldn't and so through the passage of time eventually the Samaritans come to a place where they adopt the law of Moses so now they're kind of a hybrid they're Gentile and Jew they're kind of a mixed race uh though they're still called strangers even in the New Testament you'll find where Jesus referring to a Samaritan says only one came back except this or none of them came back except the stranger referring to the Samaritan they'll find that they said well have not we said that you're a stranger to to uh a Samaritan to Jesus and doest evil so there there is there is they still viewed them as strangers and evildoers but the Samaritans now had come to a place where they adopted the law of Moses so they kept the law and they in in keeping the law they still retained this animosity towards the Jews and they're said to have done everything in their power to annoy the Jews so we could say that the the Samaritans weren't entirely innocent they both antagonized each other but it said that the Samaritans would often do everything they could to annoy the Jews so then John 4:12 as we've been read as we read through this and Jesus is continuing to talk to the Samaritan she her her comment now if you read it if there's kind of this rivalry between the two you wonder if the woman at the well is not being a little bit snarky uh you've got nothing to draw with and the well is deep you know where are you going to get this living water from but and it maybe it's easy to attach that to it but there is some kind of back and forth here but then she says this art thou greater than our father Jacob she's a Samaritan but now when she claims Jacob as her father she's she may on one hand be including Jesus a Jew in that but she's at least saying it's her father we as Samaritans because there's already been a division between Jews and Samaritans and even the writer says he's he's coming to the city of samarra which is close to The Well of Jacob that he gave his son Joseph and so he's already identified this is part of the Jewish history this goes all the way back to Jacob this is this is part of our lore and our heritage but rather the woman says are you greater than our father my father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children his cattle so this woman of Samaria is now claiming Kindred to Abraham now imagine what this would mean to a Jew and how this would create just this would provoke a Jew this would really get their their ranker up this would really lead to a a fight and a war of words so she is claiming Kindred ship kinship to Abraham Our Father Jacob and then in verse 20 after Jesus is expounded upon you know kind of discerning uh uh her heart she says I perceive that thou art a prophet in verse 20 it says our fathers now when she says our fathers she's not talking about her Samaritan fathers she's not talking about those who were brought out from babyon and Ava hamoo and saf and all these different places to Samaria she's talking about Abraham Isaac and Jacob Jacob she's talking about the mount that was given to them where there was a temple built in Mount gism and there they worshiped and this was their Mount there in the Holy Mountain and she says our fathers worshiped in this mountain gism to them this was the Holy Mount and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship again we worship the one true God in this Mount this is where our Temple is established but you guys say we have to go to church in Jerusalem and that's the only proper way to worship and if you if you look at this you'll find these are two people who believed have this same fathers follow the same law but have different places where they worshiped different churches they went to different interpretations different different uh um ideologies as you begin to look into it deeper you know they did it they've done some DNA tests they find that in the DNA the Y chromosome that is shared between the Jews and the Samaritans show a a common ancestry as far back as or at least as early as500 years ago so they do share some common ancestry through in that wide chromosome they they were more closely related than they maybe wanted to believe at least to the Jew and now we see where they claimed the same father Jacob they claim to worship they claimed the well is there they our fathers worshiped in this mountain and they considered their own Temple now this is where the Divide begins to come their own temple in Mount gum they believed it to be uh greater than the temple in Jerusalem and even after that Temple was destroyed the Samaritans still looked to that mountain to worship and still believed that that mountain was greater and that Temple though it didn't exist anymore it was greater than the The Temple at Jerusalem they adhered to and believed that they had their own copy of the law of Moses the Antiquity of it we have one that's older we have one that's more original we have the original law that Moses gave here's some Samaritans claiming to have the original Law telling the Jews who thought they were the their direct descendants we are the Jews Our Father Abraham Isaac and Jacob we are the Israelites we are the children of Israel and then to find some other group claims to have a an earlier version of the Bible an earlier version of the law has a better translation of the message than than uh than you do oh my goodness no wonder there was a rivalry no wonder when they showed up at the same restaurant like we don't have any dealings with you we don't we don't have anything to do with you and they considered that law that they had to have greater Authority than the law that the Jews had ah you're following something that that's just not as recent or it is changed you don't have everything we have the Samaritans sacrificed at Passover they observed laws they observed ordinances but then they rejected the Jewish Canon and things and Jewish Traditions that were added to the law so you could almost look at as the Samaritans more perfectly kept the law than the Jews because the Jews added things to the law that the Samaritans said n we don't follow that part we follow the first five books of the Bible that's what we follow these books written by Moses that's what we observe so when you come to the Samaritan it's not just this dog Heathen who's some kind of reprobate but notice her language even though she wasn't Living Clean notice her language she has a language of our father Jacob our fathers worshiped in this mountain a a and you but you claim that we have to Worship in Jerusalem and now notice after Jesus says woman believe me and she begins to speak to him God is a spirit they that worship me we worship in spirit and in truth notice what her conclusion is and this is in her heart the woman saith unto him verse 25 I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things she had a better understanding of what the Messiah would do than the Jews did because here he is standing before her and she thinks about the Christ she's thinking my goodness we know now this is her as a Samaritan I know that the Messiah is coming and when he and he's going to be called the Christ he's going to be the anointed one and when he's come he will tell us all things he's going to speak like this so here's the Samaritan is identifying there's something awakened inside of her something very clean something very pure where she realizes whoa I came to this water this well to drink naturally but this man standing before me has gotten to a soul thirst got away from everything that the body may be thirsty and the spirit may be clouded with all these relationships but Mah he has identified something and her thirst for a messiah has awakened so she's just not this rank sinner who rejects everything there's something very sincere about her in her need and in her sin and in her her waywardness and as she stands there she's recognizing now a messiah and so with just that in view that part in view the Samaritan when Jesus uses the Samaritan as an example now we can draw from John chapter 4 to realize just how combative and adversarial this must have been to the Jew to the lawyer and so the Samaritan stands as an antagonist to the religious identity of the lawyer the Samaritan stands because the samarit say well we keep the law and we keep it better we believe the law we believe it more perfectly we believe the Messiah is coming and so there there' been this this uh rivalry and this competition and who had it more figured out and who was better and whose theology was more correct and who could trace their lineage back further and who was who wasn't unclean who had a worst past and and all these different things so he was an antagonist to the n the the religious identity of the lawyer and then he's also an antagonist to the national identity because they would claim hey we're of Jacob we're of the same National line it's not just doctrinal religion they weren't just viewed as as prelit one who has converted to the Jewish religion but now they're claiming to actually be the blood they're actually claiming to be the natural Nation so this would have been a um something that would have antagonized the lawyer in his national identity and his religious identity would have really really hit him pretty hard so I want to ask a question and I just let you ponder it and we can play some Jeopardy music behind it as you think about it but who are our Samaritans right think about it who are our Samaritans in other words in the context of the parable who are the ones that we've made enemies because of differences and the similarities like who is it we feel it's NE necessary to distinguish ourselves from in light of the similarities but really because of the differences who are the ones we've made enemies who is it that we can say we have no dealings with them the Samaritans who who are the Samaritans in our lives in other who are the ones that the lawyer would say I don't owe him Duty a duty I don't owe them a duty I don't owe them a duty I think it's challenging to ask ourselves who are the Samaritans and I would suggest that this is me we ought not have any amen you said brother Aaron what about what about this what about that I who do you want to hate right who is it who is it you want to just go ahead rule your life right I mean that they that they you've got that they're they they they're occupying so much space in your spirit and they live inside your head right and if you could charge them rent and who do you want that who do you want that to be if you if you want to even sit down and I can help you figure find out who who's going to be your enemy who you going to hate who you going to be bitter towards who you going to separate from uh out of anger and cast down as vile and evil who is it you're going to do that with oh we could do that with sin right but do you also do that with the sinner how far would you take it to where there's you're going to go ahead and just have your list of Usual Suspects these are the people we hate on and if you fit this Paradigm if you fit this list of people if you look like this we're going to hate on you we shouldn't have Samaritans in in in the light of how this lawyer had them let me just change it because I want to take this in a different direction are we not the Samaritan see this Jew hated the Samaritan and the use of a Samaritan in this Parable really antagonizes him really causes him to consider and it's probably really agitated him and who knows what he really wanted to say in response but this lawyer the priest and the levite represent the Jews who reject Christ they reject the truth holding to their traditions and their ideology in the letter of it and and because we descend from this and because we're the oldest and we're the first and and we're better and we're greater because of that they actually Hil to this but what do they represent in the people who couldn't see the Messiah the very ones who reject the Messiah but the Samaritan represents an I want to use it as a figure and I'm not saying that this is what Jesus intended by it but we can see this as an at least an analogy represents the Gentile Who coming after the Jew seemingly not heirs to it the promise not being to them they come after and yet still believe right at the very least I would say this is what Jesus who Jesus wants us to model our Behavior after words this is the attitude of the Samaritan the one who does know the law the one who claims Affinity with Joseph this is how they act in other words you should be a Samaritan more than you should a levite and so this in this uh with this perspective I say that the Samaritan represents the true bride who's able to overcome all Pride all bitterness by P of past experience all hurt overcome any kind of Pride or Prejudice overcome any any offense and be the ones who can serve and not hold a grudge and not hold animosity and bitterness but be in a position doesn't mean we go out and say well you know I guess in light of the fact that I'm be neighbor to everybody just go out and start handing out your credit cards and your bills and paying everybody's bill at the restaurant and breakfast is on me tomorrow and and just try to do it as in a way that you're just goingon to I I'm just going trying to be neighborly no it's not just kind of all in this loose just love everybody and hug on everybody and kiss everybody certainly not in the day of a covid-19 but it's the point is that we ought to we are the ones that put in a situation where our own past experience begins to cause us to become bitter or to withdraw ourselves and not minister to where our pride would get in the way or or whatever it might be we are the ones who could say wait a minute what does God want me to do what does the word say and get past all these instincts and these biases we've talked about and really truly serve so in this then Christ challenges us not just the lawyer not only as the lawyer us being message Believers Bible Believers Christians the most religious people or the Christian who's the the one standing there say well who is my neighbor and then using some Heathen as an example that challenges Oh by if he could be a good guy then I can be a good guy but he also challenges us as the Samaritan to be that certain Samaritan and really this is what you've been called to do as a contrast to the Jews who took the law and made a tradition took the law and left the life of it took the law and because of it crucified the Lord Of Glory and didn't recognize him we ought to have a different example and a different response to the gospel so it says but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed and this word journeyed is used in the sense to travel it comes from the word which means a traveler's way so as he journeyed it's a way it's his journey it's his path but it's also the word that's used this Greek word is also used of a course of conduct so it speaks of a way of thinking a way of feeling a way of deciding so as a but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed now instead of just taking the sense of as he traveled down this path and it was really a unique path for a Samaritan this would have represented kind of a change like wait a minute what a priest was going a levite was going a Samaritan doesn't need to do this past this route this isn't a typical route that a Samaritan would go down so Jesus isn't just wanting to use it in the natural sense but he's using this word as he journeyed to speak of course of conduct and even the Samaritan as his way of thinking was as he was feeling and as he was deciding and so the actions of the Samaritan take on a different character by the words that Jesus uses the Samaritan as he journeyed what the Samaritan does and I want this to have some real impact uh when I point this out what the Samaritan does is not just impulse in the moment well I guess I should it was not just something that was it would have not been something that was out of character that's where he's deviating from the norm he's doing something he wouldn't normally do but it reflected something in his heart the Samaritan as he journeyed it says he went to him verse 34 he went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an end and took care of him his in instinct to care his possession of these elements that he could minister with his strength to serve his unselfishness to give him of his own Beast his discipline to persevere not just in treating him on the Wayside but persevere in a manner in a way to bring him to a place where he could be cared for and a place where he could continue to be careful it expressed a manner of life in a way of living it was not just walking by H the Salvation Army bucket uh during Christmas season and throwing a $5 bill in it wasn't just giving to charity it wasn't just being charitable in that moment or that instance but it was as he journeyed this was a course of conduct it was a way he thought a way he felt there's a way he decided and these things represented his Instinct his desire his strength his unselfishness all these things represented a way of living and a way of thinking amen it was something that was in the Samaritan's heart right where as opposed to the priest or levite who would say well I'm obligated by the law to do this I got to do this because the law says to do it I got to do it because the law says to do it this was something that the Samaritan not being bound by the law did it something as a manner of life and a way of living this stands in great contrast to the lawyer who's too busy splitting hairs and arguing about the law to worry about a Samaritan who was hurt after all those reprobates claim that our father Jacob and we worship in this Mount they think they got a better copy of the message I might just had a lot of different reasons why he wouldn't want to do it I had a book recommended to me by a brother this week and I began to read a little bit of it and it's WR it's written by a Christian lawyer imagine that Paradox he's the punchline to every joke obviously I say that about a preacher and a lawyer preacher preacher and a lawyer he's the punchline to every joke but the he makes this statement how when he was in high school he met this this young man who was a Christian professed to be a Christian he tells a very moving story of how that he was going to drop out of school and just basically run away and so he stopped by his neighbor's house who was older than him he'd become a friend to him and he stopped and he said you know what I want to I I'm leaving and I just was coming by to say to say goodbye to you and thank you for being a good friend it was kind of early on a Sunday morning and and and he noticed the guy was just kind of a little bit disheveled and he said hold on I'll be right back and he told him his plans his plan was to go into the national park youim or something like that and he was going to camp out and live off the land or get a job up there he's just going to go off the radar and the guy said hold on I'll be right back and he came back and he had a backpack over his shoulder and he said I'm with you I just want you to know I'm with you and he went with him he said what do you mean you're with me I'm I'll go with you where you're going and as The Story Goes he stuck it with them for these two or three days as a as a and all Whenever there was trouble that came up he said you know what I'm I'm just I'm with you whatever you want to do and eventually the guy realized you know what I'm not going this isn't going to work he couldn't get a job anywhere he's like I'm just going to go back home and he said you know what whatever his friend said whatever you decide I just want you to know I'm with you and he and he said man no one had ever taken an interest in me like that so we get back to the guy's house when they get back they see a another car in the driveway and he said it was his he recognized it as his girlfriend's car his neighbor's girlfriend's car and they go up to the house and they go in and he walks in just kind of instinctively walks in and all of a sudden the girlfriend says oh honey you're home and jumps in his arms and says you're back and he looks around he notices there's gifts that are being open there's dishes and a microwave he's like is it his birthday a microwave would be a really weird gift to give somebody to celebrate when they came into this world he's just kind of confused by everything and then he realizes they had just gotten married and his friend recognized in that moment that Sunday morning he realized this guy needs me he's in a critical juncture he's in a place in his life where I need to be there with him I need to help him and he just had one message I'm with you I'm here with you and and he realized this guy made a sacrifice they just got back maybe from their they're obviously opening up all these new gifts they had just gotten married and he chose to minister to his friend than even to stay there with his wife and he comes back and he realizes in that moment this guy really showed me love and the the the writer makes this observation he says to that point all the Christians I had met seemed to have more opinions about what or who they were against than who they were for amen man we we we claim to be Christians right we're not going to be one of those that say well good thing I call myself a Believer right could he says they seem to be more have more opinions about what and who they're against than who they were for and all this all this person said is I'm for you I'm I'm I'm here for you I'm there for you I'm for you what do you need not not in a way to approve of something that was nefarious or to approve a bad choice of conduct but was there in such a way to where he could actually be of help and a benefit to him and I see that this this this neighbor to this this author of this book he he loved his neighbor as himself and it's a challenge to us when we begin to see this Samaritan who had a particular course of conduct that made him useful to one who is in need it ought to challenge us that this word must have preeminence in our hearts this word having preeminence in our hearts it must become first instinct where we don't resort to scars and wounds and affections and animosity and bitterness and tradition and religion and that's what we act out from like the lawyer busy splitting hair is worried more about who we're against in our opinions of things that are right and wrong but rather let the word become our first instinct let it have preeminence in our hearts not just have some adherence to certain tenants if if we're not careful we just get a list of things we do and this is what we do we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we we take communion we wash one another's feet we go to church we don't cut our hair we we wear and we're talking about sisters have a Holiness Standard Brothers have a Holiness standard and we don't cuss and we're supposed to apply the token and we've just distilled it down to a bunch of tenants and in reality we come up with message laws that as long as we kind of fit this pattern and we're doing we're look the part and we act the part and as long as we're doing that we feel that we can have whatever opinions about who we're for and who we're against and we can act how we want live how we want as long as we line with those things and listen that is not what makes a Christian that's not what makes a genuine believer it has to become a life inside your heart it has to be something quickened inside of you and not just you who are good at at discipline there's people who go their entire lives and they never eat meat at least from the point they decide not to they don't smoke they don't eat meat they run 10 miles a day they do all sorts of things out of pure discipline right therefore if you told them you know it's healthier to not have a TV in your home boom TV's gone somebody sent a a meme the other day and it said the the person who doesn't have a TV starter pack I was like what is this and it was a hipster apparently because of the handlebar mustache and the you know the Retro record player and something else I know if was comer or something but it was you know some way that you knew that this was you know this these are the people that don't have TV so anymore if you don't have a TV they just think you're a hipster right how much granola you're making these days right you know you know is this a zero waste household right that's what they're going to think about you so let's not get sidetracked by just the tenants and we adhere to tenants but the life's got to be there and it's interactions like this it's interactions with the with a Jew or it's the your interactions with the Samaritans in your life that really bring out the real truth in your heart let a little opposition come and you'll find what somebody's made of let them go on their own for a while let them get get by let them do what they want let them just be able to think go with the flow but then all of a sudden be met with a challenge and the true colors come right out so this is as he journeyed it spoke to a way of life a particular way of conducting himself again looking back at this verse as he journeyed and likewise as he journeyed came where he was we've talked we've looked at this particular aspect in contrast uh to some of these other actors and how that as a church as a Believer who goes to church our default isn't to gather in the church and just tell everybody they need to come to us there there's a reason why we're not all living in these hotel rooms and working from home where we just come to the lobby to go to church there's a reason why you guys live all over the valley there's a reason why you're dispersed into different professions the the reason why you have different family backgrounds in Dynamics there's a reason why you speak different languages a reason why that your lives are so vastly different it's so that we don't get so caught up in homogenizing everyone according to a way that you should live and act to where we're no longer effective in our families in our community our neighborhoods and and and of people we work with and live around you disperse from here and we don't just gather back into our little our little meeting here and say you better come to us come to our church that's where you're going to get healed I believe that you have healing with you I believe that you have the capacity to minister where you are and that there's things that can change in people's lives even if they never make it to one of our church services you can make a difference in someone's lives and a good one too amen not just making them feel guilty and teaching them water baptism is correct but literally improve their marriages improve their lives bring healing to somebody somebody's bowed down with diabetes and they don't like the fact they have to shoot themselves with insulin and and watch this and watch that and you feel you know what God's A Healer amen you believe that I could pray for you and that God can heal you of your diabetes and not get in our mind well if I could just get him there to church on Sunday and if brother Aaron could just teach a really good message on Malachi 4 and if they could just accept the message then they could pray and get healed listen I believe that the word of God works in the mouth of a Believer that's right and that you could pray for that one who has diabetes who confesses that they believe in healing and you can lay your hands on them and pray and you can have a person who's been bound by diabetes healed and delivered and that would be an improvement that's right but we sell ourselves short so often because we make such a put so much effort into church that we're never able to minister Beyond it because it's just everything all the emphasis is on church I said it in the beginning and I'll continue to say it we don't live to go to church we go to church to live amen and we don't our our days aren't consumed with oh if I could just get ABC if I could just get ABC if I could just get ABC no it's not all about ABC it's about being a Christian about living the life being the Bride of Jesus Christ I I'll say it at this point too if if I me brother Aaron ever say my church I'm using it in the same way that you have the right to use it I if I say my church it's not because I think this church is mine any more than it's yours this is our church and if you could do me a favor don't ever call it brother Aaron's Church any more than you would call it brother Manuel's church or brother Albert's Church brother Jeff's church it's our church the church isn't known by the name of the pastor or the name of the guy who started it or however you want to whatever you want to call me this is Arizona Believers Church it's it's bigger than the man bigger than the person well where do we go now amen he says he came where he was that the the the the phrase came where he was it Paints the picture he came down to him he came down to him expresses a humility to become a servant he didn't just look over the side and see him and go you're all right going to be okay well you look like you're going to be okay enjoy your nap whatever whatever it is you're doing he came down to where he was he was willing to become a servant in order to meet him in his need if we only if we just wait till people are ready to come to church there's a lot of people that are never going to feel like they're ready to come to church but your fellowship with them and your right attitude towards them can begin a work in them that disarms them begins a healing process in them and you know what they end up wanting they want to know where you go to church and they're willing to come to church because you've created the kind of dynamic where that's inviting in Luke chap 10:32 it says and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and so the actions of the Samaritan contrast those of the levite the Samar the levite kind of came where he was at but he just looked on him but now the Samaritan as he Journey came where he was so it means more than proximity it means more than just being being near but also means being present in their need he did the the levite could say well I I came to the place where I could look on them so he was close to him he was near him but when you're going to be a neighbor to somebody you've got to do more than just be near you've got to have a be present with them in other words you're able to affirm that you understand where they are it's not just calling into the void and hearing a voice come back but it's it's actually going to a place where you can re I see what I see what predicament they're in you could sit back and say well this person struggles with this this person struggles with that they're apparently having a huge Holiness issue and they have this problem that problem but you're just close enough to tell all the problems they have but you're not present enough to really know what the real problem is that's right and when this Samaritan came to where he was it expressed a willingness to Humble himself and we must be willing to Humble ourselves and humble ourselves to the other person in order to help them you've heard the phrase get beneath somebody if you're ever going to help somebody you've got to get beneath them you're not going to be an effective you're not going to Be an Effective Teacher if you stand over them as a know-it-all yeah who's just simply showing them how little they know amen and constantly showing how how silly they are and how you didn't know this and you didn't know that and you didn't you don't know this you're never going to do it that way by being the knowt all that stands over and that's got all the answers to the question you can't help if you're the one if you're perceived as arrogant if you come that's why the scriptures teach us how to go to somebody who's in Fault how to go to somebody who's in error you don't go to them with this arrogance you really blew it this time buddy it should never come out of your mouth I told you so just let that be a victory to yourself just hav't I Told You So Ledger secretly privately and you could just go in your closet and go ah look at all these I told you so because it really doesn't do anybody any good when you go I told you so I told you that was going to happen and then after you say that then you want to say let me show you like no sorry uh-uh no you lost me I I don't feel like we're on the right kind of footing where I'm going to open myself up to you now the antagonizer and let you be my instructor they have to know that you care not just that you know they they're wrong they have to know that you care if you just assert superiority religious superiority uh you know a better Revelation a greater way of living and that kind of approach to somebody it's not going to put them in a place where they're willing to relax willing to open themselves up and willing willing to listen to you there's people who never consider Christ never consider church because of Christians yeah and because of church and if you come to them churchy man they don't want any of that I'm not trying to be a hipster but I think it'd be great if we unchurched church and said it was not what it's become but back to what it's supposed to be in 1 Corinthians 4:12 he's asking the Corinthians who are in a pretty big mess he goes what would you prefer what will ye shall I come unto you with the rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness how would you prefer I address this situation or how would you prefer I deal with it do you want me to confront it with a rod you're going to get it buddy or would you like me to address it with love and in the spirit of meekness it's a rhetorical question in other words yes love Spirit of meekness do it with a tender heart do it tenderly we should condescend not be condescending because it says the Samaritan came where he was we ought to be willing to condescend down to where they're at but not be condescending from above we should be willing to bow down to where someone's at not stoop to their level don't think that you could become a sinner to save a sinner or become a drug addict to to recover a drug addict we're not talking about engaging in their behavior or identifying with them or becoming one with them in their sin in order to help them well I'm just doing it to save them no don't fool yourself but there's got to be a willingness through some means to humble yourself humble your spirit get meet them on their level is this not how we're instructed in the message to witness if you talk to somebody who's a fisherman talk to him about fishing brother Del he wouldn't lack for material right we could even whip up our phones like we do sometimes and we we do fish War you know and and eventually it's like well I don't like bass and I'm like well I don't fish for salmon so we we we remain champions in our own right but the the the whole point is you talk to them about something they're interested in oh quantum mechanics I love that stuff yeah you know or really what is that that's interesting and you talk to get to know him and he says once you've done that you're building a rapport it wasn't brother Brandon wasn't eliciting us to some kind of secret code where if you talk to them about what they like uh uh you've checked the box and now move on to the next well he looks like he's into racing and I'll talk about you like racing Racing's good well so how are you baptized it's a means of getting somebody to they identify with you they realize you care have you ever had maybe a family member or somebody you know they never ask you how you're doing you go on vacation you go visit family you come back they never say oh so how is your trip how's your mom doing how is this person how was that how was it was it good I know you love going how did they never ask about it and that's and what it creates this awkwardness where the person walks away go you know what this is really shallow but if you talk to somebody and you really begin to relate oh you do this you do that then they realize this person's more in this person's interested he's there for me this is I it's more than just the the the the the religion that's got to talked to so many people in a day and and if they do they get themselves out of uh they get themselves into the kingdom no this is not just checking the Box this is really having a heart so we can be a we can evangelize the word do we believe this message is great do we believe it's the truth do we believe it has power do we believe there's benefits that that that come with it that we can partake in and that others can partake in then then let's view it that way be willing to Bow ourselves Jesus said but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant if it's great if this is the greatest then you're the servants everyone else is serving themselves their agendas their political agendas their selfish agendas their religious agendas all their Church agendas you're the only one that can truly serve somebody else Jesus said in Mark chapter 10 how Gentiles exercise lordship over each other the one who has Authority the one who's the ruler he he's the one that's the greatest and you serve me and I'm the greatest so you serve me he says but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister and whosoever you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all amen for even the son of man came not to be minister unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many we are the continuation of the ministry of the son of man not to be ministered to by the son of man but feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man we go forth to serve we want to serve him we want to be his hands we want to be his feet we want to be his eyes we want to be his heart we are we are to minister we're to be servants not exercise lordship I'm going to close with this we'll leave off we'll leave off the uh some of these points here but it's from this standpoint of humility this standpoint of service that the Samaritan was able to see the need and then meet it and it's when you have a heart like this you're going to be able to recognize needs not just make quick knee-jerk reactions and judgments but actually see the need and then meet it and not with the idea that you're the you're the solution to everyone's problems but one who's willing to serve one who's willing to minister one who's willing to provide the solution and you don't even get credit your name doesn't go on the patent the invention is not named after you you're just happy that the need was met amen and it's from that standpoint says when he came where he was and when he saw him it's once you come to where he is that you can actually see him and I'll close I'll just close it there brother Michael if you can come I can hold sister Opel if you need me to hold her but if you could come I want you to ponder this I I I'm leaving off some things here that we'll just get to in the next service Jesus developed the Samaritan's character in just a short story he developed the Samaritan character to teach us how to love our neighbors this he identifies him as being one who's sensitive one who had a particular way of life his manner of life was one of humility and service one who is not bound by Prejudice towards the Jews because the Jews and the Samaritans had a rivalry not one who is bound by hate because he may have been treated poorly by a Jew in the past just as the woman at the well was like wait a minute hold on the Samaritan could have been the same same way and I believe that we will never fulfill the word we will never be brought to a place of this great climactic body change until we recognize that we are the Samaritan we identify so much with John chapter 4 how that brother bam used this so often as a symbol of his own Ministry and he would use it as an example in prayer lines time and time again here stands a woman here stands a man and I say like it was in John chapter 4 and begin to give the same sign to a woman as Jesus gave to this woman so it this story should mean so much to us to realize this role of a Samaritan the role of the Samaritans in scripture and even begin to identify there's this uniqueness to these Samaritans they're kind of this hybrid they're Jews but not Jews they believe but don't have and they have these that's what really we are when it comes to we're really not Gentiles we're the bride we're really not Jews were the bride we occupy this strange space between Jews and Gentiles and until we recognize our responsibility and I'm using this phrase just as a means to try to summarize what's embodied in this actor in this Parable we've got to recognize ourselves as Samaritans whose manner of life is one of service who's willing to Humble themselves who's willing to go meet people in their needs willing to let Pride go out of the way and pretense and politics and personality and really be sincere to think Lord how can I love my neighbor as myself and you'll find that Jesus that's exactly what he was able to do as a Jew to the Samaritan because when she said well we're not supposed to have Dillons he's like fine be that way he didn't do that he had needs to go by Samaria he had purposed in his heart he he was going to follow the Lord's will he's going to do what he should say and she says I know when the Messiah comes he's going to tell us these things and Jesus said unto her I that speak unto you thee am he and then it says in verse 28 the woman well let me read verse 27 all right I am closing just get those stretch out and upon this upon this scene came his disciples it marveled that he talked with the woman why Samaritan yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her nobody say anything why it's like this is taboo what is he doing doesn't he know better nobody inquired nobody asked no nobody said what's happening here but notice what happens in the meantime while they're busy pretending not to be racist says the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and and said to the men come and see a man which told me all things that ever I did is this not the Christ then they went out of the city and came unto him meanwhile the disciples are just all worried about eating and everything else and they're all worried about other things but then the Bible says in verse 39 and many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that I ever did so when the Samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would t with him and he Abode there two days and many more believed because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the world can we not who have benefited by the grace of God benefited by the love of Christ benefited then by the the the the the the the word which looks beyond our own Prejudice our own differences our own hypocrisy the own existence of adultery and our previous relationships and all those things as Christ did the woman of Samaria and then she was turned into not a bitter disciple but an evangelist for Christ amen not a legalist who turned around and said yeah can you believe those Samaritans to the rest of the the disciples as a div invited the bread and the spoils and began to eat and talk about that weird woman that was just talking to Jesus while they were busy murmuring about the Samaritan she was busy getting the job done amen she was busy going into the city say come see a man come see a life come see a truth come see a way a way of happiness and joy and and they got and her example got their attention and they followed and then it got to where they didn't just believe because of her testimony they believed because they heard him himself who did that a Samaritan who did Jesus want us to be when he questions ask who's my neighbor he says be a Samaritan let's stand to our feet [Music] let just bow our heads in a word of prayer you can continue to play play brother [Music] Michael he's playing a course I surrender all to you Withholding Nothing could you could you tonight just say Lord make me more like you I want to I want to live the way you'd want me to live I want to do the things that you would want me to [Music] do just brother James has passed us a prayer request for sister Sharon Collins who's going into heart surgery so we don't remember her in prayer with your hands raised and your hearts open I've been challenged by looking at this I'm challenged by preaching and if you've been challenged and your heart wants to surrender to these things say Lord I want to be a real believer amen don't for a minute mistake my emphasis as being willing to stand down on these truths of this message as a willingness to water down the truth of the the open of the word the truth that God sent a prophet the truth of Holiness the truth of water baptism the truth I'm not going to stand down on one of those things amen but I'm not going to let any of those things make me arrogant and alienate me from people I can help and serve amen let's pray and ask God to help us our gracious Heavenly Father we're surrendering our all to you tonight with hands raised having been challenged by this Parable challenged by the word challenged now Lord in your presence I ask that you would take us make us what you'd want us to be use us for your glory and Lord May there be no feeling displeasing to you may there be no Pride or or bias or bigotry or Prejudice displeasing to you Lord I don't want to hate anybody Lord even those that offend I don't want to have bitterness towards anybody Lord I I I I I want to know that I disagree I want to know what the word says I want to know when they're wrong I know I want to know when the the truth is deviated from Lord I want to be able to discern spirits that are evil I want to let my love be without dissimulation to abhor that which is evil in order to cleave to that which is good but father I don't want to be crowned with the critical spirit I don't want to be so closed off in church where I can't reach out to somebody I can't make a difference to those that I love I can't see a church grow through evangelism grow through Souls being saved Lord you have quickly brought together a body of people you've quickly identified a unit Lord equip us now as that body to be used For Your Glory that we could add to this body not swell Lord but grow let those who are born here be counted let us count those that are born Lord and so we may have may we have a heart for the lost and the scattered and the wounded I pray we could be challenged by these things I'm committing myself to you tonight I commit to you father the people they raised their hands in great sincerity that they're longing Lord for change in their heart a change in spirit some I know are being challenged it may seem like a hammer is beating against a callousness to a hardness but Lord let us speak good things of even our enemies let us speak Pleasant things of even those that have hurt us let us speak well of others if we don't have something good to say may we not say it at all so it said positive people don't put others down neither should we put ourselves down lord May our conduct please you Lord I commit the people to you tonight bless our continued worship we pray Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
