[0:00] yeah we'll go ahead and read it all the
[0:01] way to verse 11 I think I might stop a
[0:03] little short I have it till verse 11 I
[0:04] may stop a little short of that in those
[0:06] days was Hezekiah sick un death and the
[0:09] prophet Isaiah the son of Amos came to
[0:11] him and said unto him thus sayith the
[0:13] Lord set thy house in order for Thou
[0:15] shalt die and not live then he turned
[0:17] his face to the wall and prayed to the
[0:19] Lord saying I beseech thee Oh Lord
[0:21] remember now how I have walked before
[0:24] thee in truth with a perfect heart and
[0:26] have done that which is good in thy
[0:27] sight and Hezekiah wept sore and it came
[0:31] to pass before Isaiah was gone out into
[0:34] the middle court that the word of the
[0:35] Lord came to him saying turn again and
[0:38] tell Hezekiah the captain of my people
[0:41] thus sayith the Lord the god of David
[0:44] thy father I have heard thy prayer and
[0:46] I've seen thy tears behold I will heal
[0:49] thee on the third day Thou shalt go up
[0:51] unto the house of the Lord It's God
[0:53] that's going to heal him and I will add
[0:55] unto thy days 15 years and I will
[0:58] deliver thee and this city out of the
[1:00] hand of the king of Assyria and I will
[1:02] defend this city for my own sake and for
[1:04] my servant David's sake now remember God
[1:07] said he's going to heal them verse 7 and
[1:09] Isaiah said take a lump of figs and they
[1:12] took and laid it on the boil and he
[1:15] recovered we'll just stop there they
[1:18] took figs laid it on the boil and he
[1:21] recovered you can take your
[1:25] seats I think I was going to be reading
[1:27] in a few other places to tie those other
[1:30] verses in but we'll just we'll leave it
[1:32] there my title tonight is a miracle or
[1:35] medicine it's a question a miracle or
[1:37] medicine and it's a continuation brother
[1:40] Chris if you have that title slide it's
[1:42] a continuation on a matter of faith and
[1:45] uh this is I realize and now it's kind
[1:47] of eth service on this I I feel like
[1:50] there's a burden that I've been chasing
[1:52] in this subject and some things have
[1:54] just been building on this this would
[1:56] really fit under the subject of Divine
[1:58] Healing this is really going to tie in a
[2:00] lot to what we ministered on Sunday
[2:02] though we won't background anything but
[2:03] I'm asking the question tonight a
[2:05] miracle or medicine and as this title is
[2:10] posed as a question really going to
[2:12] address in some ways whether it is an
[2:14] act of unbelief or manifestation of
[2:16] unbelief to use means in healing or to
[2:20] pursue methods or to look for things to
[2:22] be healed or to be cured and we could
[2:25] maybe put it this way if I'm sick does
[2:28] faith do nothing at all
[2:30] when I find myself ailing and I find
[2:32] something's wrong does faith say NOP I
[2:34] believe God's going to heal me and does
[2:35] nothing at all or does it try and I
[2:37] think I may even mentioned this before
[2:38] does it try everything that is available
[2:40] as a as a an affirmative act to believe
[2:43] I I want to be well and I want to be
[2:45] healed and in James chapter 5: 13-6
[2:48] we've been reading this so much we don't
[2:50] have the provide the slide here but says
[2:52] if any are afflicted we've been looking
[2:54] at how that's in mind it tells them to
[2:55] pray if anyone is not happy let them
[2:58] sing Psalms and then it says is any sick
[3:00] among you let him call for the Elders of
[3:02] the church and let them pray over him
[3:04] anointing him with oil in the name of
[3:06] the Lord and the prayer of faith shall
[3:08] save the sick now this is a clear
[3:11] commandment of what we can do when we're
[3:12] sick and how that we could call for the
[3:14] Elders of the church they can anoint us
[3:16] with oil pray over us and it says the
[3:18] prayer of faith shall save the sick and
[3:21] you might think that even my question a
[3:24] miracle or medicine or even to put it in
[3:26] those terms that what what is it
[3:27] unbelief to seek out help in being
[3:30] healed that might seem odd to you but I
[3:32] use this scripture at the beginning
[3:35] because some have taken this scripture
[3:38] to mean that God expressly forbids a
[3:41] Christian from seeking any other remedy
[3:44] than to have hands laid on them to be
[3:46] healed and they'll quote this and say
[3:48] that when God is actually I'm trying to
[3:51] think of some of the verbiage that I
[3:52] have read to where they says that God
[3:54] has forever separated the Christian uh
[3:57] from Medicine by the scripture that when
[3:59] you're sick you can only call for the
[4:01] elders to anoint you with oil and pray
[4:03] for you and the prayer of faith shall
[4:04] save the sick now I don't encourage you
[4:07] to Google this but I'm going to read
[4:08] this verbatim from a a minister uh from
[4:11] long ago he said I used to be a member
[4:13] of a church where it was considered just
[4:15] an offense just as offensive to take
[4:17] medicine or go to the doctor as it was
[4:20] to go to the devil for
[4:21] health the Christian who would run to a
[4:24] doctor was on the level with the
[4:25] adulterer or the thief that is
[4:28] absolutely right that is according to
[4:30] the word of God so this is a this is a
[4:33] man preaching Divine Healing a man
[4:35] claiming to be a man of God has quite
[4:37] the uh checkered past but he still
[4:40] nonetheless was associated with Divine
[4:42] Healing and revered as a as a Healer and
[4:45] a man with the gift of healing and he's
[4:47] pointing out and he does this very
[4:48] forcefully in a number of his sermons
[4:50] from many many many years ago how that
[4:52] it would be one who would visit a doctor
[4:54] is on level with an adulterer or a thief
[4:57] and he says that's according to the word
[4:59] of God
[5:00] now so this is a position within
[5:02] christiandom within Christianity that
[5:04] takes a scripture like this and says
[5:06] that a Christian only has one choice
[5:08] when they're sick and that's to have
[5:10] hands laid on them and prayed for them
[5:11] that they may be well to do anything
[5:13] else is to lean on the Flesh of man is
[5:16] to separate yourself from God is to
[5:18] become an adulterer against the word of
[5:20] God and and it's a very that's very
[5:23] forceful now if I could say this we may
[5:26] we may not be as extreme and I'm pretty
[5:28] certain that those of us here tonight in
[5:31] this service are not that extreme but we
[5:34] may have uh some internal conflict
[5:37] that's related to that thought process
[5:40] that we may have somewhat of a struggle
[5:42] within ourselves that tells us that well
[5:44] I'm sick and I'm not feeling well and
[5:46] then maybe we go to the doctor and they
[5:47] give us a prescription we start taking
[5:48] the prescription we're not getting any
[5:50] better and all of a sudden we start
[5:50] thinking oh well did I do the wrong
[5:52] thing should have I not gone to the
[5:53] doctor and maybe there's just a question
[5:55] in our minds of where do we draw the
[5:57] line of being one who has faith faith
[5:59] and is believing God for all things and
[6:01] someone who is maybe looking to Natural
[6:04] Things or uh things that could be made
[6:07] available to us as humans uh to give us
[6:09] strength to give us health or to help us
[6:11] to cure something and I just think that
[6:14] some of us on some level even if we
[6:16] don't realize it might have some shadow
[6:18] of this theology that can kind of plag
[6:21] our thinking a little bit is is that
[6:24] would some of you maybe just agree that
[6:25] yeah that's a challenge sometimes on
[6:27] some level what faith looks like when it
[6:30] comes to believing for our healing in
[6:34] Mark chapter 16: 18 it says they shall
[6:36] take up serpents and if they drink any
[6:38] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[6:40] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[6:42] shall
[6:44] recover just as some has taken James
[6:46] chapter 5 to mean that you can only ask
[6:48] for prayer when you're sick and nothing
[6:50] else I would even ask is this scripture
[6:53] in All or Nothing in other words if you
[6:56] are the only remedy available to a
[6:58] Christian is to do nothing at all except
[7:00] have someone pray for him when we are in
[7:03] other words when we're not feeling well
[7:05] does reaching for anything other than
[7:07] the gos
[7:08] pill mean that it's
[7:10] unbelief reaching for anything other and
[7:13] I know so say we when we're we get a
[7:14] headache we reach for the medicine
[7:16] cabinet instead of reaching for Mark
[7:17] 1618 and taking a gospel and and maybe
[7:20] that makes for some kind kind of
[7:22] energetic preaching and I'm sure we may
[7:23] have all stood at some point on our feet
[7:25] and clapped when we heard that but you
[7:27] have to be careful sometimes if the
[7:28] underly
[7:30] theme behind it is that any other action
[7:32] other than asking for prayer is
[7:34] indicative unbelief just think of all
[7:36] the things that we might do that
[7:38] evidence unbelief and therefore
[7:40] compromise our true
[7:42] faith that it when I'm dehydrated I I
[7:45] drank water I shouldn't have done that I
[7:47] should have just trusted God to hydrate
[7:49] me or and and it just sews things in
[7:51] there to where you begin to doubt when
[7:53] you really need it you really need to
[7:55] have faith you start thinking well have
[7:56] I done something wrong do I not have
[7:58] faith is this evidence of unbelief and
[8:00] again as we mentioned on Sunday I really
[8:02] want the word of God to expose the devil
[8:04] so that he can stop plaguing us with all
[8:07] his little
[8:08] tactics so my my thesis tonight is how
[8:11] can we
[8:12] maintain a a foundation of Faith while
[8:17] properly availing ourselves to the means
[8:19] at our disposal to be strengthened to be
[8:22] to be c not necessarily cured but to be
[8:25] help help our health and I believe that
[8:29] we can and I want to do this in a number
[8:31] of different scriptures I'll say this
[8:34] preparation for this service was was a
[8:36] bear a grizzly bear a a mother Grizzly
[8:39] protecting her Cubs this one was a tough
[8:42] one and I want to look into the word of
[8:44] God to catch his attitude towards helps
[8:46] and means and Medicine even and there's
[8:49] a and I realized now I realized later
[8:51] this afternoon that we'll have to chop
[8:53] this up into some parts but in the
[8:55] sermon Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[8:57] today and forever this is a real key
[9:00] statement and if you want to go back and
[9:01] read the larger portion of this I was
[9:04] almost going to play a portion of this
[9:05] tape or just read about six or seven
[9:08] very lengthy statements and just say if
[9:10] this bothers you offends you I have to
[9:11] get it out I want you to see what
[9:12] brother Brown has to say about these
[9:14] things but he says now in this you see
[9:16] so much when you speak of bodily healing
[9:19] so you you when you when you talk about
[9:21] the healing of the body there's so many
[9:22] ideas there's so many statements and
[9:24] feelings and opinions he says that
[9:26] there's he says the motives and
[9:28] objectives of people seem to be so
[9:30] confused and wrong many times when it
[9:33] comes to our healing and the matter of
[9:35] believing for our healing he says
[9:38] there's so much that's said about it and
[9:39] the motives and objectives of people are
[9:42] confused and wrong many times when it
[9:45] comes to your healing when it comes to
[9:47] your body being well when it comes to
[9:49] your health when it comes to you uh uh
[9:51] using things at your disposal to make
[9:53] sure that you stay healthy or treat a
[9:55] disease he says that the motives and
[9:57] objectives are confused and and
[10:00] sometimes wrong just outright wrong and
[10:03] so when what one of the things that
[10:04] we're trying to look at is when it comes
[10:06] to bodily healing with all the things
[10:08] that are said about it we want to be
[10:10] sure that our objectives are clear and
[10:12] that our motives are not wrong that we
[10:15] could use this to understand that when
[10:16] it comes to the body and the wellness of
[10:18] the body there's a lot of uh disciplines
[10:21] there's a lot of approaches there's a
[10:22] lot of ideas and there's a lot of
[10:24] opinions but we want to we want to be
[10:26] sure that whatever whatever it is that
[10:29] we believe is going to help us is not
[10:32] ultimately something that's defiling our
[10:35] faith or that what we're doing we
[10:38] actually do believe it's going to help
[10:40] us and not be so detached from faith
[10:43] when it comes to our healing now in 2
[10:46] Chronicles chapter
[10:48] 16:12 I start here in getting into this
[10:51] subject now because this is one of the
[10:54] scriptures that's used by the if if
[10:57] you're going to teach that it's a sin to
[10:59] go to the doctor this is one of the the
[11:01] main scriptures you can use so if that's
[11:02] what you were here tonight to find out
[11:04] write this down I don't mind if you do
[11:07] uh but this is one of the main uh
[11:09] weapons in their uh Weaponry against
[11:11] doctors and against medicine is 2
[11:13] Chronicles 16:12 and it's about King ASA
[11:16] and ASA in the 30 and9th year of his
[11:18] Reign was diseased in his feet until his
[11:21] disease was exceeding great yet in his
[11:24] disease he sought not the Lord but to
[11:27] the Physicians I wonder anybody could
[11:29] ever use that against a foot
[11:31] doctor but trust me I've heard all the
[11:34] lawyer
[11:37] ones about time I start collecting some
[11:39] doctor
[11:40] ones but so he had a foot disease and
[11:43] the Bible says that in his disease he
[11:46] sought he did not seek God verse 13
[11:48] actually tells us that he dies uh and it
[11:51] doesn't necessarily say that he if I
[11:53] recall it doesn't necessarily say that
[11:54] he Des died because of his feet it just
[11:56] says he went on he slept he went to be
[11:58] with the Lord but in Anyone who reads
[11:59] this with an eye to be critical towards
[12:01] the Physicians believes that he died
[12:03] because he went to the
[12:05] doctor and if I could say this in his
[12:08] disease he says in his disease he sought
[12:11] not the Lord but went to the Physicians
[12:13] or sought the Physicians the way that
[12:15] it's written and asau did not sin by
[12:19] going to the Physicians which's the word
[12:21] physician there the root is Rafa Jehovah
[12:23] Rafa it's the same word as a matter of
[12:25] fact I'll say this it would have been
[12:27] his duty to do so
[12:29] but his in his trusting in upon
[12:33] them expecting healing from them and not
[12:37] God would have been his Heir other words
[12:40] just going to the doctor says he did he
[12:42] his dis in his disease he did not seek
[12:44] the Lord but the Physicians so if his
[12:46] expectation was that the Physicians
[12:48] alone could heal them if if in going to
[12:50] the doctor he'd completely left out the
[12:53] the resource of God and his trust in God
[12:55] and faith in God that would have been a
[12:56] sin to him but his faith ought to been
[12:59] in God and trusting in God and not the
[13:02] skill of the Physicians and not the the
[13:04] faithfulness of those in his day who
[13:07] could treat a wound he ought to have
[13:08] been believing in God and trusting in
[13:10] God and and even then at the same time
[13:13] going to the doctor but having sought
[13:15] God at the same time John Wesley wrote
[13:18] it this way about this very scripture he
[13:20] said the help of every creature must be
[13:22] used with an eye to the
[13:25] Creator so no matter what it is you're
[13:27] seeking for a remedy if it be uh if it
[13:29] be an oil if it be uh if it be some sort
[13:32] of bomb or some sort of treatment a
[13:33] medicine a prescription and go to the
[13:35] doctor a specialist or or or or or maybe
[13:38] an alternative Remedy or therapy we
[13:40] ought to it says the help of every
[13:42] creature must be used but if I I say the
[13:44] but with an eye to the Creator and in
[13:47] dependence on
[13:49] him in in dependence on him who makes
[13:54] every creature that to us which which is
[13:57] without whom the most skill ful and
[13:59] faithful faithful are Physicians of no
[14:02] value other words that with whatever we
[14:05] would seek whatever we would pursue we
[14:08] do it with an eye to God depending upon
[14:11] him that without him the most skillful
[14:15] the most faithful of doctors and the
[14:17] best of medicines are of no
[14:19] value and so as we read this scripture
[14:23] and we begin to identify asau asa's
[14:27] disease and death and his seeking out
[14:29] Physicians but not seeking God if I
[14:32] could say this his Heir was not in
[14:35] seeking the Physicians and if you think
[14:37] I'm drawing my own conclusions based
[14:39] upon that scripture I could accept that
[14:41] I'll try to do more to back up what I
[14:43] mean in this but maybe at the beginning
[14:45] I'm setting this forth as what my
[14:47] position is and I'll substantiate it by
[14:49] scripture but his sin was not in seeking
[14:51] Physicians but in not seeking God and if
[14:55] you make that a one or the other
[14:56] proposition that's not the case you
[14:58] could seek God while seeking a physician
[15:01] knowing that that physician without
[15:03] God's help and without the things that
[15:05] God has provided and that man not in
[15:07] himself but with the resources that God
[15:09] can give and even ability God can give
[15:11] him his advice or his remedy is of no
[15:14] value to me except God stand behind
[15:18] it and in Proverbs chap 17:22 let's
[15:22] begin to look to the word of God to
[15:23] catch his attitude towards medicine and
[15:25] helps and
[15:27] means says a merry heart doeth good like
[15:30] a medicine but a broken Spirit drith the
[15:33] bones that statement in itself deserves
[15:36] much
[15:37] attention tells us just how debilitating
[15:40] a broken spirit
[15:42] is but then it says a merry heart so as
[15:45] we've been talking about a good attitude
[15:47] and a good mood and and being positive
[15:49] in those things the right mental
[15:50] attitude it says it does good like a
[15:53] medicine even remember on Sunday the
[15:55] difference between the placebo effect
[15:57] and the no nobo effect
[15:59] that there's a lot of things that at the
[16:01] end of the day doctors can't explain the
[16:03] positive benefits of something because
[16:05] there was nothing in it but what was it
[16:07] it was a good attitude maybe it was a
[16:09] merry heart an expecting heart someone
[16:11] who believed that there was something
[16:13] good in that and it made a difference
[16:15] and so the Bible says a merry heart does
[16:17] good like a medicine now if you're
[16:20] reading this and if language means
[16:22] anything to us it's saying medicine does
[16:26] good right should we take a up another
[16:29] offering and go home I mean this is
[16:31] pretty this is pretty clear he says a
[16:33] merry heart doeth good like a medicine
[16:35] in other words it implies that medicine
[16:37] does good and that word medicine there
[16:39] means a cure or
[16:41] healing and so this is a I would say put
[16:44] it in the the the positive column when
[16:47] it comes to medicine this is a positive
[16:48] reference to medicine that a good a
[16:51] happy heart a good spirit a positive
[16:53] attitude does good like a medicine does
[16:55] good and now in Ezekiel 47:
[16:59] 12 says and by the this is I'm really
[17:02] leading up this lengthy scripture here
[17:04] just to the last few of the last phrase
[17:06] of it but it says and by the river upon
[17:08] the bank thereof on this side and on
[17:10] that side shall grow all trees for meat
[17:13] whose leaves shall not fade neither
[17:15] shall the fruit thereof be consumed are
[17:17] we allowed to believe that that would be
[17:18] ribey and not necessarily an
[17:21] apple what's what's the marbling like on
[17:24] that and it shall bring forth new fruit
[17:26] according to his months because their
[17:27] Waters they issued out of the sanctuary
[17:30] and the fruit thereof shall be for meat
[17:32] the fruit of the tree shall be for food
[17:34] and the leaf thereof for medicine now
[17:37] what a regardless of how that this
[17:40] scripture is what regardless of what
[17:42] time period is being described or what
[17:43] future uh blessedness of man's existence
[17:46] this is described it uses a language to
[17:48] say that there will be a tree that's not
[17:50] only good for food but there's going to
[17:52] be a leaf that is used for medicine the
[17:54] word medicine there is healing for a
[17:56] cure so it's an once again again it's a
[17:59] reference to something something that
[18:01] God has provided something that grows
[18:03] something that is available that is used
[18:06] for healing it says a merry heart doeth
[18:08] good like a medicine it refers to
[18:10] something that's used for healing
[18:11] something to allow something to be made
[18:13] whole here it says a leaf will be used
[18:15] for healing we've read this here
[18:17] recently in Jeremiah 8: 20 and 22 the
[18:21] Harvest is passed the summer is ended
[18:23] and we are not saved for the hurt of the
[18:25] daughter of my people am I hurt I am
[18:28] black astonishment had taken hold on me
[18:30] and now the cry is there no balm in
[18:34] Gilead this is that Bal the sav as a
[18:37] medicine something that would heal is
[18:39] there no healing Sav in Gilead it's
[18:42] reference to something that people say
[18:44] oh is there no balm they would think of
[18:46] some sort of ointment that would be used
[18:49] in warding off infection or healing
[18:51] disease this would have been a phrase
[18:52] that they immediately would Associated
[18:54] it with something topical that's used
[18:56] when someone had some sort of infliction
[18:58] is there no balb in Gilead is there no
[19:00] physician there physician there comes
[19:04] again from
[19:05] Rafa why then is not the health of the
[19:08] daughter of my people
[19:10] recovered is there not some kind of
[19:12] balsom some balm a Sav is there not a
[19:15] physician one who can concoct and put
[19:18] together and mix this up and then apply
[19:20] it to the wound and apply it to those
[19:22] that are sick again this is a reference
[19:24] to a bomb to a physician things that
[19:27] would be used to promote healing heing
[19:30] in Luke 10:34 when Jesus has given given
[19:33] the parable that ended with the question
[19:35] who is Thy
[19:36] Neighbor he speaks of the man who had
[19:38] been wounded and left on the Wayside
[19:41] bleeding and beaten half naked and half
[19:43] dead or naked and half dead and the Good
[19:46] Samaritan came by and begin to tend to
[19:48] him in verse 34 it says and went to him
[19:51] and bound up his wounds I remember going
[19:53] into great detail on this as a church
[19:55] pouring in oil and wine and set him on
[19:58] his own beast and brought him to an in
[20:00] and took care of him what did the wine
[20:03] do it cleansed of any infection that oil
[20:05] would be something that would ease the
[20:07] pain he was doing things he bound up the
[20:10] wounds he poured in oil and wine all
[20:12] these different elements together to
[20:14] promote healing rehab the
[20:17] wound this is something that Jesus goes
[20:20] into detail to show how one could care
[20:22] for somebody when they were physically
[20:23] beaten or physically torn bound up his
[20:26] wounds poured into the oil and wine
[20:29] in Isaiah 1: 5-6 it says why should you
[20:32] be stricken anymore ye will Revolt more
[20:36] and more the whole head is sick and the
[20:38] whole heart faint from the soul of the
[20:41] foot even unto the head there is no
[20:43] soundness in it and then and I if there
[20:46] was if you would like were liking more
[20:48] context to this I really am focusing
[20:51] intently on a language that is used to
[20:54] refer to ways that wounds or sickness or
[20:56] infection would be treated as it says
[20:59] but wounds and bruises and putrifying
[21:01] sores they have not been closed neither
[21:05] bound up neither mollified with
[21:08] ointment again it's speaking of an
[21:10] injury a wound something that's disease
[21:12] something that's infected and how that's
[21:14] in God and looking at it and trying to
[21:16] paint the image of a condition it's
[21:19] referring to a natural condition and how
[21:21] that things uh have not been closed or
[21:24] bound up and mollified with ointment
[21:26] treated so that they can heal treated in
[21:28] such a way to where the infection can
[21:30] stop the pain can be eased and healing
[21:32] and The Mending process can begin to
[21:34] take place and however even if I could
[21:36] say this God made the body that some
[21:38] agent can now begin to work with those
[21:41] with the body's ability to heal itself a
[21:44] and given strength and given resources
[21:46] could then stop something from infecting
[21:48] it ease the pain nourish the person to a
[21:51] place where their body can heal itself
[21:53] the Bible's referring to these very
[21:55] things in these several
[21:57] scriptures and in each one of these
[21:59] instances and I could have used a lot
[22:00] more there's no direct condemnation of
[22:03] medicine there's no direct condemnation
[22:05] of using something that's procured from
[22:07] a leaf nor is there any direct
[22:09] condemnation of using a bomb there's no
[22:11] direct condemnation of using medicine or
[22:13] Physicians but rather despite the
[22:15] multiple references and opportunities to
[22:18] be negative it never is
[22:34] all right I remember remember when I uh
[22:36] copied and pasted cut and paste pasted a
[22:39] whole page of notes I thought I was lost
[22:40] for a second we're going to save that
[22:42] for next Wednesday or Sunday so in in
[22:46] these references
[22:48] here these were ample opportunity for
[22:51] God for his own children's sake who are
[22:54] desirous to know and want to do what's
[22:56] right and to please him these were ample
[22:59] opportunities and I realize I've got to
[23:00] be careful how I say this because I'm
[23:02] really wanting to deal with people
[23:04] taking too much Liberty in the absence
[23:06] of things so I don't want to do the same
[23:08] thing myself but notice given an
[23:11] opportunity to bring caution or balance
[23:13] or even to speak against these things
[23:15] the Bible could have said we have no
[23:17] need of the bomb or we have no need of
[23:18] Physicians we have no need of this we
[23:20] have no need of that and there could
[23:21] have been very very forceful in a way to
[23:23] create a healthy uh uh abhorrence for
[23:26] Physicians and for medicine and bals but
[23:29] God is not afraid to use by analogy that
[23:32] things that he provides and even things
[23:34] that we should have are like good
[23:37] medicine or will be like a medicine to
[23:40] us in 2 Kings chapter
[23:44] 20 and this is uh appreciate your
[23:47] attentiveness tonight and and patience
[23:50] with a very difficult subject at least
[23:51] it is for
[23:54] me it's a a difficult subject for me
[23:57] because there's so much that you look at
[23:59] and so much you're conscious of and you
[24:02] you don't you want to just stay faithful
[24:04] to the middle of the road in the word of
[24:07] God and so in in 2 Kings chapter 20 it
[24:10] says in those days Hezekiah was sick
[24:13] unto death and Hezekiah weeps unto the
[24:16] Lord so he's been given a he knows he's
[24:19] going to die by virtue of his sickness
[24:21] and he weeps unto the Lord and even
[24:24] Isaiah tell told him get your house in
[24:25] order because you're going to die so it
[24:26] was very very uh
[24:29] severe and it says in in
[24:32] verse I'm just trying to find the exact
[24:35] place where it says that he will be
[24:37] healed yeah it says in verse five that
[24:40] the word of the Lord had come to him
[24:41] that he heard his prayers and he says
[24:43] behold I will heal thee thus sayith the
[24:46] Lord the god of David thy father I've
[24:48] heard thy prayer I've seen thy tears
[24:50] behold I will heal thee and on the third
[24:53] day Thou shalt go up under the house of
[24:55] the Lord so now he's sick unto death the
[24:57] prophet confirmed them get your house in
[24:59] order you're going to die he beseeches
[25:01] the Lord and calls upon the Lord a lot
[25:03] more to the story different principles
[25:04] we can learn from but then when he calls
[25:06] upon the Lord and asks to be healed and
[25:09] give me more time God let me help me
[25:11] this is uh uh what in his desperation in
[25:13] his pleading God says I will heal thee
[25:17] and then verse seven now notice this
[25:19] because this is where it tells us that
[25:21] he is healed it says and Isaiah said
[25:25] take a lump of figs okay this is all it
[25:28] tells us take a lump of
[25:29] figs so Isaiah's given a commandment to
[25:33] to uh to the people to his care
[25:36] caregivers and they took and laid it
[25:39] this what we read here is a lump of figs
[25:41] and laid it on the boil and he recovered
[25:45] so we can gather from the scripture that
[25:48] that uh Hezekiah was sick unto death and
[25:51] that maybe it and that it was
[25:53] manifesting itself in a boil or boils
[25:55] and that the prophet tells them that
[25:57] you're going to die he beseeches the God
[25:59] and the Lord speaks to Isaiah thus
[26:01] sayith the Lord you're going to be
[26:02] healed and this is how the Bible tells
[26:05] us he was healed a lump of figs was
[26:08] placed upon the boil and he was it says
[26:10] recovered he was
[26:14] healed and this uh lump of figs we might
[26:17] think that it's just uh a lump of just
[26:20] fresh figs or raw figs placed upon them
[26:22] but it would have been a
[26:24] paste of herbs and plant maybe some
[26:26] other substances mixed in if you the
[26:28] some of the reading I was doing or it
[26:29] would have been an actual cake of figs
[26:31] that was made of dried cake of figs and
[26:34] some of the ways that they would apply
[26:35] this they would spread it on a warm
[26:36] cloth and then it would be set upon that
[26:38] wound or that boil or that thing that
[26:41] was festering and it was to help reduce
[26:43] inflammation and promote
[26:45] healing and so here's something even a
[26:48] remedy that may have been available in
[26:49] those times something that might have
[26:51] been applied before it's not and we we
[26:54] may read this and it might seem like a
[26:56] kind of a oneoff but when you read the
[26:58] history and even um some of the things
[27:00] that are very prevalent in other
[27:02] societies at that time in that region
[27:04] they used medicin uh things that were
[27:07] available to them as medicinal resources
[27:09] to treat wounds to treat boils to treat
[27:11] infections to treat sicknesses and so
[27:14] God in saying thus sayith the Lord I
[27:16] will heal them Isaiah says take this
[27:19] cake of dry figs take this uh uh this
[27:21] paste of herbs and apply it to the boil
[27:24] and he
[27:25] recovered so I can say this God chosen a
[27:28] natural means to Grant the healing of
[27:33] Hezekiah in Isaiah CH 38: 211 it says
[27:36] for Isaiah had said this gives us more
[27:39] this is the same exact uh passage same
[27:42] exact instance for Isaiah had said let
[27:44] them take a lump of figs and lay it for
[27:47] a plaster upon the boil and he shall
[27:50] recover so now we see that there's
[27:52] taking of a natural means and applying
[27:55] it to the the wound and the Bible says
[27:58] that he recovered he was
[28:01] healed and I want to say this as we have
[28:04] posed the question tonight a miracle or
[28:07] medicine regardless of the active
[28:10] ingredient regardless of the
[28:12] biologically active component in the
[28:14] figs or the lack
[28:16] thereof God did it amen regardless
[28:21] regardless of what in in science could
[28:23] one day uh in break into God's Great
[28:26] laboratory find that that well this
[28:27] really wasn't a healing we found that a
[28:30] common illness during that time period
[28:32] was such and such and such and such and
[28:33] there's this acid in the Fig uh uh from
[28:36] that time period that when it makes
[28:38] contact with the boil especially on the
[28:40] big toe since your pores are bigger on
[28:42] the big toe and it absorbs it quicker
[28:44] that something happened to this boil
[28:47] which I don't think there's any evidence
[28:48] that you absorb oils more quickly on the
[28:49] big toe but anyways I digress that they
[28:53] they may say that there's something in
[28:55] the figs that specifically treated this
[28:57] type of illness that was common in that
[28:58] time period and they discovered the
[29:00] active ingredients so they're going to
[29:01] say well so it really wasn't a miracle
[29:04] it was the
[29:06] medicine but why can't it be
[29:09] both right God had told him he was going
[29:12] to die he was certain he was going to
[29:14] die he beseeched the Lord and the Lord
[29:15] said I'll heal you and God allowed the
[29:17] prophet to prescribe something that
[29:20] remedied the thing that was going to
[29:22] take his life and it says that he
[29:24] recovered so whether you want to say it
[29:26] was the medicine or you want to say it
[29:27] was a Miracle God did it because it was
[29:30] his
[29:32] provision this is not directly to maybe
[29:35] this kind of
[29:37] application of a medicine but in 2 Kings
[29:40] 4:
[29:42] 38-41 says an Elisha came to gilgal I'm
[29:45] just reading the whole story it says and
[29:47] there was a dir there was a famine there
[29:49] was a dir in the land and the sons of
[29:51] the prophets were sitting before him and
[29:53] he said unto his servant set on the
[29:55] great pot and see the pottage for the
[29:57] sons of the prophets and one went out
[29:59] into the field to gather herbs and found
[30:02] a wild Vine and gathered thereof wild
[30:04] gourds his lapful and came and shred
[30:07] them into the pot of pottage for they
[30:09] knew them not he gathered wild gourds
[30:11] but didn't know that they were W wild
[30:13] gourds or knew what they would do they
[30:15] have a poisonous nature so they poured
[30:17] out for the men to eat and it came to
[30:19] pass as they were eating of the pottage
[30:21] they cried out and said oh thou man of
[30:23] God there's death in the pot so taking
[30:26] something that was growing naturally
[30:28] that was now poisonous it's causing some
[30:29] sort of uh seizing up they know that
[30:32] there's something wrong there's
[30:33] something that's going to cause them to
[30:34] die there's a poison in the pot and they
[30:36] could not eat thereof and now but he
[30:37] said the prophet
[30:39] now then bring meal so they brought him
[30:43] cornmeal or some sort of meal and he
[30:44] cast it into the pot and he said pour
[30:46] out for the people and they may eat and
[30:48] there was no harm in the pot so a man
[30:52] goes and gathers something that is
[30:53] poisonous and he takes up this poison
[30:55] and this poison is put into the pot and
[30:57] we know that the promisees given to us
[30:58] you shall take drink no deadly thing you
[31:00] shall not drink these deadly things and
[31:01] it harm you this was a poisonous
[31:03] substance in the pot and now the prophet
[31:06] is told there's death in the pot he says
[31:08] bring me meal right throw it into the
[31:11] pot and in doing so then he said pour
[31:14] out for the people and by the act of
[31:17] throwing meal in the pot it says there
[31:19] was no harm in the
[31:21] pot was that medicine or
[31:25] Miracle right could we rationalize it to
[31:27] the point and say well I mean this guy
[31:29] he had just been keeping up in his
[31:30] Farmer's Almanac and he knew that with
[31:33] wild gourds that are shredded in that
[31:35] manner that the best thing for it is to
[31:37] make sure you put Masa in it or
[31:39] something else you put put it in it and
[31:41] it'll bind itself it's a great binder he
[31:43] could have been I mean this could be a
[31:45] euphemism for passing out charcoal
[31:48] right and so he put it in the pot it's
[31:51] going to act as a binder it's going to
[31:52] do this it's going to do that whatever
[31:54] it is it doesn't matter the science
[31:55] doesn't matter to me
[31:59] right there was no harm in the pot and
[32:03] we know this is a miracle that God
[32:05] performed so when it comes to our
[32:07] healing and I I'm being very
[32:08] introductory very surfac tonight in this
[32:11] subject matter when it comes to our
[32:13] healing we could try to divide things to
[32:15] say well you have a choice you either
[32:17] look for you could either look for Med
[32:19] go to medicine or you could look for a
[32:20] miracle you have your choice you need to
[32:22] go to the doctor or go to Dr Jesus you
[32:25] can either get chemotherapy or Christ
[32:27] therapy and there might a way that we
[32:28] just try to draw this line and cause
[32:30] some well I guess I've got to choose I
[32:31] got to choose between uh doing something
[32:34] that the doctor says I can do to help me
[32:36] I got a choice to do something that
[32:37] maybe I think might be able to help me
[32:39] or I just Stand My Ground and only and
[32:41] do nothing at all and believe that God
[32:42] will heal me and I just want to say this
[32:44] I do not believe the word of God forces
[32:47] us to that kind of
[32:49] choice that even in medicine there can
[32:51] be a
[32:52] miracle that even through medicine
[32:54] there's healing so whether it's medicine
[32:57] or Miracle irle what matters is the
[32:59] healing right isn't that what you want
[33:02] isn't that what you want to be well what
[33:04] Wellness is about like you're not
[33:06] looking to be able to put in a testimony
[33:08] you're not wanting to be able to stand
[33:09] before the people say oh I I had hands
[33:11] laid on me and this Gorder fell off or I
[33:13] was diagnosed with stage four cancer and
[33:15] I did nothing but this or I did nothing
[33:17] but that I did this and I did this and I
[33:18] was made well don't you just want to be
[33:20] well and regardless of how your Wellness
[33:23] comes are you not going to give God the
[33:24] glory so at the end of the day we've got
[33:27] to recognize why we want to be healed
[33:29] what our motive and objective is and if
[33:31] we're just seeking after glory to be
[33:33] Vindicated as a Believer listen I I I
[33:35] guess I just say this with a there's
[33:37] something welling up by inspiration if
[33:39] you need to be healed of a sickness in
[33:41] order to confirm your salvation you're
[33:43] probably on very Dangerous
[33:46] Grounds that if you're looking for God
[33:48] to intervene in your physical ailment to
[33:50] kind of give you some sort of confidence
[33:52] that you've got faith for the body
[33:53] change you're you're getting things a
[33:55] little bit backwards but if you're sick
[33:57] and you want to be well be desire to be
[34:00] well for the wellness sake that you can
[34:02] serve god with everything that's in you
[34:04] so that you can be a mother to your
[34:05] children you could be a husband to your
[34:07] wife whatever it might be what be
[34:09] desired to be well for the right reasons
[34:11] not so that you could stand there and
[34:13] and and Proclaim that you've got a
[34:15] greater Faith than everyone
[34:18] else what matters is the healing whether
[34:21] it be through medicine or a
[34:23] miracle because all healing is Divine
[34:25] Healing I keep saying it over over and
[34:27] over again all healing is Divine Healing
[34:29] all healing is a matter of faith God is
[34:32] the Healer so then he is at the center
[34:34] then he must be at the center of our
[34:36] faith again I say this in a way that I
[34:38] feel like I I I I I just trying to
[34:41] maintain this
[34:43] balance so that if you if you believe
[34:45] that God's going to heal you absent
[34:47] absent any kind of medical intervention
[34:49] be sure that it's faith in Christ not
[34:52] fear faith in Christ that has you
[34:54] centered upon the promise that's why we
[34:56] dealt with phobia on Sunday be sure that
[34:59] your faith is centered on Christ that
[35:01] even if you go to a doctor you know that
[35:03] you're not in the similitude of Asa that
[35:05] you're still seeking
[35:07] God doctor whatever it might be a
[35:10] nutritionist whatever it is you're go
[35:12] whoever it is you're going to you
[35:13] realize that I I am not abandoning my
[35:15] faith in God as I take this medication
[35:18] as I take this prescription as I use
[35:20] this remedy you say w you you have a
[35:22] vitamin D deficiency well I'm just going
[35:24] to lay before the Son of God right and
[35:27] get all the V vitamin uh D Deliverance I
[35:29] need okay I believe people can have
[35:31] faith enough to do that and I would want
[35:33] you to have enough Faith to do that but
[35:35] don't think that the person who goes and
[35:37] spend time in the sun to increase their
[35:38] vitamin D deficiency has any less Faith
[35:41] than
[35:42] you because they're trusted in the same
[35:44] God to give him the same results amen
[35:46] the god that created the Sun the very
[35:49] God that designed the body that vitamin
[35:50] D would even be necessary remember we
[35:53] touched on it on Sunday we'll go into it
[35:55] in Greater detail maybe this Sunday
[35:56] God's the one that made made this body
[35:58] he's the one that knows how to keep it
[36:00] healthy and Desiring to keep it healthy
[36:02] is not a bad desire so then when you do
[36:05] those things and you seek out remedies
[36:07] and you seek out treatments just be
[36:09] certain that your heart is centered upon
[36:11] God knowing from him as who your help
[36:13] comes from your expectation is from
[36:19] him and that's that's what your that's
[36:21] what you're looking
[36:22] for that whenever it happens andever you
[36:26] you you you follow some sort of protocol
[36:29] you go through some sort of treatment
[36:30] and it runs at course and they say hey
[36:32] guess what we we did a we did a scan
[36:34] there's not an ounce of cancer in you
[36:36] you're completely healed and you don't
[36:37] praise the god of science right that's
[36:40] my God I believed I was going to be
[36:42] healed I knew I was going to be well you
[36:44] can give the glory to God to whom it is
[36:47] due now I I have a number of statements
[36:50] I'd like to read in this this vein and
[36:52] I'll just I just have two maybe a third
[36:55] one to read to you tonight
[36:57] and then uh so that we're not just this
[37:00] is I think there's a lot to think about
[37:02] already that I want you to be able just
[37:04] to consider in your own time and be very
[37:06] prayerful about but I want to read some
[37:08] statements that brother Brandon made
[37:09] that tie into this particular part
[37:11] because I narrowed I zeroed in more on
[37:13] the aspect of the medicine part and left
[37:16] out a lot of things on the doctor part
[37:17] in scripture The Physician part in
[37:19] scripture and in the message but these
[37:21] are a few lengthy statements maybe just
[37:23] two that touch on this brother bam in
[37:25] the sermon a greater than Solomon is
[37:27] here
[37:28] says the next few nights we have given
[37:30] to praying for the sick and we are
[37:33] trusting that God will continue to move
[37:36] and to heal those that are sick and
[37:38] Afflicted and now before we can approach
[37:41] any subject it must come from God's
[37:44] Eternal Word now healing is an act of
[37:48] faith and Faith Can't cannot rest itself
[37:51] upon the shifting Sands of man's
[37:54] theologies but it can only rest upon the
[37:56] unmovable Rock of God's Eternal Word so
[38:00] that's what we're wanting to be centered
[38:01] on that when it comes to our healing
[38:03] comes to our happiness comes to our
[38:04] health comes to you name it our
[38:06] prosperity it's centered solely upon
[38:09] God's word therefore Faith cometh by
[38:12] hearing hearing of the word of God and
[38:14] Divine Healing is not something that's
[38:16] just oh a totem pull or a Hocus Pocus
[38:20] it's a Divine truth written in the word
[38:22] of God confirmed by the Holy Spirit and
[38:25] it's not limited to any denomination
[38:28] people Creed color it's to whosoever
[38:32] will just a Salvation is it is a product
[38:36] of a finished work that we receive by
[38:38] faith in the great vicarious suffering
[38:41] in Triumph of the resurrection of the
[38:43] Lord
[38:44] Jesus that those are some beautiful
[38:46] words about healing and so it tells us
[38:48] it's it's for those who will believe in
[38:50] it those who will receive
[38:51] it now it's this statement here that I
[38:55] think is really zeros in and you'll find
[38:58] this I found it in so many different
[39:00] places and there's so much breadth on
[39:01] this and it's wonderful to read it for
[39:03] ourselves and hear it so I encourage you
[39:05] to take time to look at these things
[39:07] yourself in the message of the hour
[39:09] notice how he's looking at a particular
[39:11] attitude as we mentioned in the
[39:12] beginning the motives and objectives are
[39:14] so confused and wrong when it comes to
[39:16] bodily healing he said so much is said
[39:18] today about healing and different ways
[39:20] that it is approached and there seems to
[39:23] be so much confusion about
[39:26] healing is this true there's so much
[39:29] confusion about healing as I tried last
[39:33] night with all my heart to make it clear
[39:35] that there's no other healing but Divine
[39:37] Healing God stands Al God God Alone
[39:42] stands in
[39:44] healing
[39:47] so I think that
[39:51] this we let's let's settle
[39:54] that that what he's referring to is any
[39:57] healing because I and I and we know this
[39:59] because in other places he talks about
[40:01] if there's a cut you can put ointment on
[40:03] it to stop an infection but it's the
[40:05] body that heals itself life is the
[40:07] Healer how he says it in one place so we
[40:09] have to realize that the way that
[40:11] brother Brandon puts it and I I I with
[40:14] my with the way that my mind works when
[40:16] I've been reading these statements and
[40:17] I'm wanting to understand it for myself
[40:19] and I'm certainly W to understand it
[40:21] with some with the inspiration before I
[40:22] share it with you that he's identifying
[40:25] that we can be certain
[40:28] that God made the body and anything that
[40:30] man identifies or finds that helps the
[40:34] body to be cured in remission delivered
[40:37] or whatever is things that God has
[40:40] already created and made available
[40:42] working even if it's synthetic man has
[40:44] used things that God has already created
[40:47] beforehand and there it's using some
[40:49] force or some Theory some principle
[40:51] something and they're applying it to the
[40:53] human body and it responds well to that
[40:56] and it results in a healing or a
[41:00] releasing or deliverance and brother
[41:02] Bam's identifying that there's no man
[41:04] that can back up and take credit for all
[41:07] of it at the end of the day there's God
[41:09] saying I did that and so how did he do
[41:12] it I made the body that way I put the
[41:14] elements in the earth I put these things
[41:16] at the disposal I let man break into my
[41:18] laboratory I let these things happen I
[41:21] think I've probably told it uh here I
[41:23] know I've told it a number of times for
[41:25] many many years the the story about
[41:27] how just a story fictional story lest
[41:30] anybody write this down and try to go
[41:31] look it up how a scientist had got to a
[41:33] place where they were so certain about
[41:35] their abilities and science that they
[41:37] finally decided that they didn't eat God
[41:39] anymore any how many heard this story
[41:41] you're probably you probably are the
[41:42] ones that told it and and I'll go ahead
[41:45] and tell it for Preston since he
[41:47] probably hasn't heard it before but they
[41:49] finally decided that they didn't need
[41:51] God anymore so they they chose a
[41:53] scientist to go to God he went to God
[41:55] kind of you know real humbly before the
[41:56] Lord says look we have made so many
[41:58] tremendous advancements in science we
[42:00] are now able to clone things and just
[42:02] about be able to take anything and
[42:03] change it and do this and do that and
[42:05] we've made such advancements in science
[42:07] and DNA that we just feel that we can
[42:10] begin to take care of ourselves when it
[42:11] comes to procreation when it comes to
[42:13] Health and Longevity of life and all
[42:15] these different things so we just
[42:17] respectfully ask that now that we've
[42:19] come to this
[42:20] place of Science and scientific
[42:22] advancement could you just back off a
[42:24] little bit and let us be and God said
[42:26] that's fair that's fine
[42:28] but before you do in order to to
[42:30] determine whether or not you're able to
[42:32] handle this we'll go ahead and have a
[42:33] man-making
[42:35] contest and I'll make man and you make
[42:38] man and then and then we will and the
[42:41] winner of that contest and before he
[42:43] even finish the son say that's fine y
[42:45] that's fine yeah let's we can do that
[42:46] we'll do it we'll make man he goes but
[42:48] you have to do it out of
[42:50] dirt and the scientist said oh that's
[42:53] fine that's fine we can do it we can do
[42:54] it out of dirt and so he says all right
[42:56] let's do it the scientists went off told
[42:58] the scientists what they need to do and
[42:59] they begin to gather their dirt together
[43:00] to make a man and God said no no no no
[43:02] wait a minute hold on get your own
[43:05] dirt right go get your own dirt in other
[43:08] words science is only working with the
[43:10] materials that God has given them and
[43:12] their greatest successes have been when
[43:14] they acknowledge that right and so when
[43:17] brother brandham talks about this along
[43:18] the lines of God being the only healer
[43:20] healing only coming by God if you say
[43:22] well I I know that's not true because I
[43:24] had this and I took this medicine and
[43:26] this worked and I did this I took that
[43:28] no it's to God be the glory because
[43:30] God's the one that made all things and
[43:32] he's the one that made the human body in
[43:34] such a way to respond to that and so no
[43:37] matter what angles you approach he says
[43:38] there's one thing God Alone stands in
[43:40] healing says now and this is where his
[43:44] mind is when he's addressing these
[43:45] things now we certainly admire all that
[43:48] science has given us but science is not
[43:51] a
[43:52] healing do we admire
[43:55] it science isn't consistent to the body
[43:59] God does the healing science can set
[44:02] your arm science can move a tooth
[44:05] science can take out an appendix or a
[44:07] tumor but never can science produce a
[44:11] recreation and that's really where you
[44:13] would place the miraculous aspect of it
[44:16] healing is a recovery but even in that
[44:18] re Recreation that's the miraculous
[44:20] aspect of healing creation is God alone
[44:24] and God has healed every person that
[44:26] ever was healed
[44:28] no matter what hospital or doctor office
[44:30] what Clinic he went to God did the
[44:33] healing God does not share his glory
[44:35] with no one he said he wouldn't and he
[44:38] said I am the Lord that heals all thy
[44:42] diseases that's where we ought to place
[44:44] it right especially as Christians that
[44:47] if if if we're looking for our healing
[44:50] and looking for our healing we seek out
[44:52] remedies or treatments or some uh uh
[44:54] professional or somebody that we think
[44:56] we can heal us don't ever forget God's
[44:58] the
[44:59] Healer don't ever don't ever get to the
[45:01] place where I went through this prayer
[45:02] line and I tried this and I believed for
[45:04] years and now I'm just going to go do
[45:05] that if you do anything along those
[45:07] lines then you have you you better stop
[45:10] right if for one minute you say well I I
[45:13] went the prayer route I went the faith
[45:14] route
[45:16] stop right you're in Dangerous Ground
[45:18] when now you've created this competition
[45:20] but what you can do is when seeking God
[45:22] for prayer and for healing you can have
[45:25] a faith that God is leading you to your
[45:27] healing through things that he makes
[45:29] available to you listen some people can
[45:31] get healed just by eating
[45:33] right right like every time the lights
[45:36] on at Crispy Cream doesn't need mean you
[45:37] got to go through I knew some people
[45:40] that when Crispy Cream is given out
[45:42] three dozen donuts to healthc care
[45:43] practitioners they took advantage of
[45:46] it right because well it's available to
[45:49] me it's free and maybe there's some
[45:51] things that you can do and God said now
[45:53] I can honor that I can bless that I can
[45:56] I recognize the detrimental impacts that
[45:58] certain things may have on me and that
[46:00] it's not just carnal it's not just human
[46:02] effort but it's a mind of Faith saying I
[46:04] want to be at my best for God I want to
[46:06] be at the best for my family I want to
[46:07] be healthy as a man of God whatever it
[46:09] might be and doing the things that you
[46:10] know are wise and prudent when it comes
[46:12] to your take taking care of your
[46:16] body but there's no that you have to be
[46:18] in that position let me come back to
[46:21] that that if it's a weakness of faith
[46:23] and a letting down of Faith pause and
[46:25] stop and reset recalibrate
[46:27] and realize that God can use means to
[46:30] heal
[46:31] us that there was nothing wrong with the
[46:33] word of God when you were prayed
[46:35] for and and and there may have it may
[46:39] have been nothing wrong with your faith
[46:40] except you hadn't quite let it anchor
[46:43] yet I know maybe that's a mouthful but I
[46:45] trust that God can use that so he says I
[46:47] am the Lord who Health all thy diseases
[46:49] so we realize that many things that have
[46:50] been done by Hospital work and by what
[46:53] the Lord has sent our doctors and
[46:55] science to do we realize that many
[46:58] things have been done by Hospital work
[47:00] and by what the Lord has sent our
[47:02] doctors and science to do and to that
[47:04] we're thankful and grateful notice how
[47:08] uh kind if we could say and considerate
[47:10] brother brandham was of healthc Care
[47:12] Professionals the whole medical industry
[47:15] medicine um you doctors the number of
[47:18] different ways he refers to them to
[47:20] acknowledge that God has sent them to do
[47:22] a work that there's things that they do
[47:24] to help and he says we're thankful and
[47:26] grateful and brother Bram is very
[47:28] careful to not create competition among
[47:31] them as a matter of fact when he says
[47:33] the motives and objectives of the people
[47:34] seem to be so confused many times he's
[47:37] identifying that very Dynamic where
[47:39] there's so much competition of the
[47:41] osteopath and the chiropractor and the
[47:43] surgeon and the medical doctor and each
[47:45] one wants there wants to get the money
[47:47] and each one wants the credit and we'll
[47:49] get into this in Greater detail later he
[47:50] says that's where the problem is and
[47:52] brother brandham knew that money would
[47:54] be the problem when it came to our
[47:56] health way back back then he knew 60
[47:59] years ago listen it's going to come down
[48:01] to where money is the problem you think
[48:02] money is just the ones that are in the
[48:04] hospitals and the pharmacies they're
[48:06] also the ones that are pedaling their
[48:07] Wares
[48:09] online we think oh well heal
[48:12] Pharmaceuticals it's a billion dollar
[48:13] industry so are all the alternate
[48:15] alternatives to Pharmaceuticals
[48:17] multi-billion dollar
[48:20] industry and if you leave here going I
[48:22] don't know what to look for anymore well
[48:24] that's great got you right where need to
[48:27] be look up Look to Him trust him for all
[48:30] things but he says I'm thankful to God
[48:32] for the hospital work and all that the
[48:34] Lord has sent our doctors and scientists
[48:36] to do and to that we're thankful and
[48:39] grateful in this time this age where
[48:42] there's so much talk and the motives and
[48:45] objectives of people are so confused and
[48:46] wrong many
[48:49] times he says in one place he says it's
[48:51] a moneymaking
[48:54] thing he says if everything is right and
[48:56] a man has got his right motive and his
[48:58] right objective to it I think that each
[49:00] of us and all know that operation does
[49:02] good medicine does good the Bible said
[49:04] so and you know a chiropract and
[49:07] osteopathic many times help people we
[49:08] know that that's a good a to help but he
[49:11] says it's the money part that's the
[49:12] problem it's the motive and objective
[49:14] that's the
[49:16] problem my final statement tonight for
[49:19] the message
[49:22] perseverance you know many people say Oh
[49:24] Glory to God I just we've read part of
[49:27] these both of these statements I think
[49:28] we've read before part of it but then
[49:30] taking this next step and seeing what
[49:32] he's dealing with to me it's so
[49:33] beautiful he says you know many people
[49:34] say Oh Glory to God brother so and so
[49:36] laid hands on me Hallelujah I got well
[49:38] that kind of looks like the brother had
[49:40] something to do with it right that kind
[49:43] of looks like the brother had something
[49:44] to do with it now if you can just
[49:47] recognize the presence of Jesus Christ
[49:49] see and let it's his hands that count
[49:52] see and just accept him then nobody laid
[49:55] hands on you but Christ you touched him
[49:58] and his hands touched you and no man
[50:00] gets praise anywhere it's all the
[50:04] praise because that's all can be done
[50:07] anyhow this is this is focusing our
[50:10] faith now that even in the act of laying
[50:13] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[50:14] that it's very easy to make an idol out
[50:16] of the hands it's very easy to put the
[50:19] emphasis on the oil and not the fact
[50:20] that the prayer of faith and The God Who
[50:22] made the promise shall save the sick and
[50:24] so he takes us IM balances a so well it
[50:26] looks like the brother had something to
[50:27] do with it but that's but God you
[50:29] touched him now he says if we take any
[50:32] praise we're robbing God from it because
[50:35] God is the one that does the
[50:37] healing and remember there is no such
[50:40] thing as any man be a doctor or Minister
[50:43] that's a
[50:44] Healer I am the Lord thy God that heals
[50:47] all thy diseases see all and he says no
[50:51] medicine
[50:52] heals there's not no doctor claims
[50:55] medicine to heal no no
[50:58] now I if you argue
[51:01] semantics I I would say
[51:06] that doctors even acknowledge that they
[51:09] only make observations most of the time
[51:11] they're making observations all right I
[51:12] got to look at the doctors and make sure
[51:13] I'm getting this right they make
[51:16] observations about what's happening and
[51:18] don't always know exactly what's
[51:20] happening sometimes they do but that
[51:23] there's times when they say we know that
[51:24] this works it's proven to work is not
[51:26] theoretical we know that 95% of the time
[51:29] if you use this agent in this particular
[51:30] situation it works and they can talk
[51:32] about this and that and they can see the
[51:34] results but sometimes they say you know
[51:35] what we're not quite sure what's
[51:36] happening behind the curtain we just
[51:38] know that it
[51:40] works he says there's there's no doctor
[51:42] claims medicine to heal he says medicine
[51:44] only keeps clean while God heals
[51:47] medicine cannot build tissue cannot mend
[51:49] a bone you might cut an appendix out but
[51:51] who's going to heal the place that came
[51:53] out of from might pull a tooth but who's
[51:55] going to heal the place it came out of
[51:58] God is the Healer he's the only
[52:04] healer the scriptures don't lie they're
[52:07] perfectly right so he is the
[52:09] Healer again now now remember what he's
[52:12] referring to in
[52:13] that it's not that science may not apply
[52:16] a balm it may not it's not that there's
[52:18] not stitches but at the end of the day
[52:20] what is science even relying upon the
[52:21] body's own
[52:23] ability to repair itself to respond
[52:26] positive ly to the treatment says I'm
[52:28] very grateful for all things that we got
[52:31] like medicines that they can think of
[52:33] that will kill
[52:35] germs nothing against that but brother
[52:38] brandham you never lived in
[52:40] 2020 nothing against that I pray
[52:44] constantly for that now if you think
[52:46] this is just a oneoff he says statements
[52:48] to this effect so often to where you
[52:50] know he's not being dish inous he really
[52:52] did pray for doctors he prayed for
[52:54] medicine he was for anything that would
[52:56] help in this vein he says I pray
[52:58] constantly for that things that'll kill
[53:00] germs he's not against anything like
[53:02] that but we get someplace we don't have
[53:04] any medicine to help the case notice how
[53:07] that there's even some there's a part of
[53:09] him that acknowledges that there's a
[53:11] place for these things to help in in the
[53:14] areas that it can definitively help in
[53:16] and it kills germs and it takes care of
[53:18] this and it's preventative and there's
[53:20] ways that we could take care of
[53:21] ourselves to keep ourselves from
[53:23] experiencing certain infections and
[53:24] certain diseases and we ought to do
[53:26] those things that we should do and
[53:28] there's things that we can do to to set
[53:30] a bone and to stitch something up he
[53:32] says but then there's some cases that
[53:34] medicine cannot
[53:36] help all right here's your chance to
[53:38] amen some of you and then another thing
[53:39] sometimes a medicine that'll help one
[53:40] will kill the other
[53:43] one so it's not always the same thing
[53:46] doesn't always work for everyone he says
[53:47] but I know a toxin that's absolutely not
[53:49] a remedy but a cure and that's the blood
[53:51] of Jesus Christ faith in that blood is
[53:55] that not something we we can all agree
[53:57] on whether you only eat cornfed beef or
[54:00] grass-fed beef don't we all agree that
[54:02] this word is the best meat there is
[54:04] right isn't there something we can agree
[54:06] on isn't there something at the end of
[54:08] the day we agree that if you get your
[54:09] healing through this and you get your
[54:11] healing through that at the end of the
[54:12] day it says we know who healed you we
[54:14] know who healed you we both know it's
[54:16] him that's the Healer whatever it is
[54:19] that God uses because of our how
[54:21] peculiar our faith is or unique
[54:22] experiences or even how God's made our
[54:24] body up there's some people who bodies
[54:27] are not the same as other people's
[54:28] bodies they will not respond to this
[54:30] there's some people who can't do that
[54:32] there's there's so many different ways
[54:33] that our body needs to be helped and
[54:35] whatever someone can do by faith to get
[54:37] help and whatever helps somebody Lord
[54:40] help us to not be the critic Lord help
[54:43] us to not say anything that would weaken
[54:45] their Faith Lord help us be a voice that
[54:48] can say praise God because healing only
[54:51] comes from
[54:54] God and encourage one another and
[54:56] support one another in these
[54:59] things so that we can have the kind of
[55:02] faith that whether it be a medicine or a
[55:06] miracle it's a matter of believing God
[55:09] and we have faith in God for these
[55:11] things and we believe it's him that
[55:13] makes the difference
