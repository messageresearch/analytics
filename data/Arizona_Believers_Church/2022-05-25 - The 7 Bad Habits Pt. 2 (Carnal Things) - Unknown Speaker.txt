TRANSCRIPT
========================================
continue on the subject of the seven seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents and we um will just take a few moments here at the outset to touch on uh I actually just want to take a couple couple moments to kind of recap that whole subject and I'll say this if you're here and you're not uh you don't have uh you don't have children or you're not married I would say these principles that we're exploring are instructive for all relationship ship not just uh parents to children but it's instructive for all relationships it's for individuals it's for uh for other relationships we might have to other people even single people can draw things from it uh maybe to use the bud word buzzword for today it's TurnKey it's scalable uh it's relatable however you want to look at it these things are not just isolated to parents and we were looking at these uh seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents and we see them here in this slide that it's overemphasizing ing carnal things uh inconsistently instructing and correcting improperly judging inappropriately using voice wrongly disciplining not being an example and withholding Grace what I've done is I've given my children a template to call me out on numbers 1 to 7 if I engage in any one of these uh bad habits but as we looked at these last time we saw that each bad habit had a correlating uh characteristic in the stature of a perfect man and it provided a contrast so you could see these things are the bad habits but there is an inverse there is a good habit uh there is a positive trait or attribute and so you could look at this and say with number seven withholding Grace is a bad habit then showing Grace is a good habit so there's a way that you could express this in the positive uh I characterized it this way because I like to make the point that I've learned from my mistakes not so much my uh god-given wisdom I've learned more from my mistakes in the ways that I fought against uh certain things or done things in my own mind or own my own ability and I could say I know what the bad habits are Lord let me learn from these to identify the good habits so tonight we're going to look at overemphasizing carnal things and that's our maybe even our title tonight could be even phrased as overemphasizing carnal things and we look when we looked at this on uh last Wednesday we were contrasting these uh these carnal things by faith that if if you're overemphasizing carnal things then then what's the contrast to that what correlates to that in a positive sense and we were saying that we ought to be families focused on the word and one thing that uh I I like to use a little bit of a play on words as we hear focus on the family you've heard that before now now this you don't need to email Dr Dobson after this but I think um that it's good to focus on the family but a family ought to be focused on the word and and so we could focus on the family to its own detriment just by pouring ourselves into family and doing things in response to family but doing it apart from the word or forsaking the word and we want our kids to be well fed we want them to sleep we want them to get a good education we want them to do all these things a a and have well-rounded hobbies and be social and these different things but if we do it at the sake of the word or risking uh forsaking the word then it's just a detriment to them so we ought to be families focused on the word now the quote I drew from in that is from the statue of a perfect man he says now you're going to build a house and and you pour the foundation and say booy I got her what's he pointing out if you have the foundation you don't quite have the house yet he says you got the foundation to build your house on now you got to build a house now there's where the big the thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about now a house this Foundation is first what is the foundation of Christianity faith in the word of God that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this foundation so the foundation of our spirit spiritual house even us as individuals the foundation of the the home that we have with our families it has to be and it must be faith in the word of God that's the foundation we build if you're going to go build a house uh in the just in the natural you're going to make sure you have a good foundation so the most important things you can do in the beginning is finding out what kind of foundation you need to build and what does the dirt look like underneath and is their good bedrock and will the foundation hold and so this is where a lot of the work goes in is in this initial stage of have laying the foundation and it applies for our lives naturally or or spiritually as individuals and it applies to our families we need to have some sort of Bedrock some sort of foundation that this is what our family is based upon this is what it's built on this is what determines uh what we do is the word of God now I've used the phrase overemphasizing carnal things I did it on purpose uh because I realized that life demands attention to carnal things that was going to be my biggest amen I thought tonight was that was that part there so I hope it just gets better from there but life demands our attention to carnal things and you don't have to be evil it's just this is what life does and we know even scripturally that we cannot disregard carnal things Bible tells us a man who provides not for his family is worse than an Infidel and it's not just talking about spiritually it's talking about even in the natural to provide the things that are necessary the Bible even tells us he that is married careth for the things of the world how he may please his wife so it's a natur thing to give attention to carnal things even from a sincere heart and even in being obedient to the word and so the emphasis is on overemphasis it's not that we would give any attention we shouldn't give any attention to carnal things but it's when we overemphasize carnal things and because life demands attention to it we must be careful not to overemphasize it and to also emphasize spiritual things and that could just be the reverse you say what what would be a good habit emphasizing spiritual things now in Colossians chap 1: 18 just going to we're going to lay some principles in to support uh this uh just to build the thought on a bad habit is overemphasizing carnal things in Colossians 1:8 speaking of Christ it says and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so Christ is the head better be the head of your life he's the head of the church and it says that he is to have preeminence that means to be first to hold the first place on Sunday when we're preaching about our family tree we wanted to spend a lot of time showing that Christ is that body Christ is that tree he is our family tree he is the the vine we are the branches and it's what all that we are part of he must have the preeminence he must have the first place he's the head of the body of the church he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things right all things he might have the preeminence not just some things but all things that means to hold the first place now we could emphasize this through scripture and we could certainly use a lot of um support showing that Christ is to have preeminence in his church and this is the pattern for his church but it also establishes the pattern for our family order establishes the pattern for our home life you could ask yourselves well the church church we have to put Christ first in the church Christ has to be the first thing at Arizona Believers Church we need to put Christ first but if none of you were doing that in your personal lives how successful do you think we would be in allowing Christ to be first here am and we could have a picture of them we could call it Christ First Church H and we could do all sorts of things to try to make Christ the center and have them let them have preeminence but if we're not letting them have preeminence in our homes and our prayer life and our natural lives and the way that we conduct ourselves um Beyond these four walls then it's Greater Life likelihood if not probably an impossibility for Christ to have preeminence in this church let and even think of in terms of the bride of Christ if we as individuals and families aren't letting him have preeminence then how can he have preeminence in all things and so it establishes a pattern for your family structure for our home life now in 1 Corinthians 11:3 he said but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God we know that this establishes an order of relation to one another an arrangement of each part to each other and among each other and it says we we kind of the head of the woman is the man and but then it says the head of every man is Christ and so if we looked into family the husband being the head of the wife or the husband the father being the head of the family uh that we can say well he's the head in the family but who's the head of the father it says here the head of every man is Christ and so in every home Christ has the headship there may be a there may be an arrangement to where the husband is considered the head between a man and a wife and within a family but then his head is Christ and Christ's head is God and that establishes establishes the proper order and arrangement of things so a man in his family say I'm the head I'm the head but you better be subject to Christ and it's through that that Christ has the preeminence in the family when we let him have headship in our lives and Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Bram said he should be the Principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the Principal theme of our life if he's the principal theme of The Bible and the Bible is in us then he should be the Principal theme of everything that we do say or think that's one of the outstanding quotes in this sermon Christ having the preeminence is in his bride it's he must be the Principal theme in everything we do say or think the principal theme of our talking thinking singing and of our walking he should be the Principal theme now if you look at Psalms chapter 16 and I'm realizing now that I forgot to make a few announcements but I don't mind making them now uh the Jenkin family is still sick we hope trust that you're uh still praying for them and then also the Rubik he mentioned I think brother Ian was not feeling well this evening I think sister Jennifer's still not feeling well they're not calling nobody's calling it co anymore but man there's a real nasty bug that's going around and inflicting people and also keep for failing to mention that brother Micah has gone on a three three-week vacation and so that's why he hasn't been playing the piano he hasn't been fired I know loyal thought he was going to be fired nobody's getting fired Mike is just on a little bit of a trip we miss him very very much so pray for him he should be coming back next week Psalm 16: 8 and9 notice what David says and I want to draw draw very deeply from these phrases he uses here because there's a tremendous principle he says I have set the lord always before me that's putting him first I've set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved why is he unmovable because he because he is set the lord always before him and he's at my right hand I shall not be moved and there's a therefore here's a causal connection therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope now look at these verses and think of how he how he says I'm putting the Lord first and because I put the Lord first I'm unmovable and being unmovable being steadfast in the right things by letting him have the preeminence and him being the principal theme and letting him be the head therefore my heart is glad here's the source of my joy my my glory rejoices this is the source of my strength he's talking about strength and fortitude a Happy Spirit a strong body in my flesh is at rest this is a tremendous uh scripture I think all of us could say that's what I want when I wake up on a Thursday morning I want a glad heart I want a strength that rejoiceth and I want my flesh to rest in hope this is a this is a a peaceful feeling right and so Ponder this as we compare think about and I just want to share my thesis with you at this point because we're comparing spiritual things with carnal things and in this there is and I'm wanting to emphasize this in such a way and I would say this is what I'm wanting to bring out tonight is that if you emphasize spiritual things it brings depth spiritual things provides a deeper connection carnal things it's really really shallow but spiritual things it brings depth as David is saying here there's a security in it I shall not be moved so there's a stability and he says my my heart is glad so there's happiness in it my glory rejoiceth there's strength in it he says my flesh shall rest in hope there's Comfort it's a comfortable peaceful uh uh feeling whenever you are emphasizing spiritual things you sow to that you're going to reap stability you're going to reap security you're going to reap death it says when the Bible says that you know if you let the Lord uh seek the Lord and put him first and there's certain things that says then no weapon formed against you shall prosper no evil shall come nigh thy dwelling why because you let him have the preeminence you've let him be your habitation you're putting him first there's Security in that there's stability in them and so with carnal things the inverse is true carnal things just feed shallowness it's always fleeting it's very it's very short uh what it does if you find that you can't feed to the Flesh and then the flesh be all right that's enough right you ever have you ever told your children go ahead you can play you can play Madden 22 uh uh for 20 minutes and is that ever enough It's never enough maybe that's going to be my biggest amen there's always got to be at least one more game one more play because the the the the flesh is never like Ah that's enough right until the flesh doesn't know what's going on right and that's why it's it's it's uh it's to be noted that whenever people do the things they do in the world on Friday and Saturday night they generally wake up in the morning say I don't ever want to do that again right and then they forget 12 hours later because they're right back at it again but I've never been drunk off the presence of God and ever said I don't want to do that again amen never been in the presence of God never been in a meeting never been in a prayer line I've never seen the power of God move never seen the gifts manifested never felt wept in his presence and rejoiced in his song Service never sat hearing the word of God and left it said well I don't ever want to do that again why because when you sew to carnal things it's fleeting it's shallow and carnal things promote fear when you feed to carnal things it promotes fear it promotes frustration and I would even challenge us as parents to use some exercise some discernment in watch that when the when our the Flesh of our children is being fed how it leads to them being fussy short-tempered a and their tension spans have to be kind of dealt with in a particular way why because spiritual things breed one things carnal things breed another and the message lifting him up out of History brother Bram says we have a home life crisis this phrase home life I think I was pting it today that maybe it would be worth it just to maybe Define it in a service but I think you could you can pretty much gather what he's meaning here we have a home life crisis it's all encompassing the our homes our relationships and what it's like even within our houses as we know it doesn't take a house to make a home that home has something to do with the feeling of it he says it seems like the home life is running out into shallow water it used to be in a home I trust you're all listening tonight I like how God just he makes up the the congregation and he makes up the audience in a particular way uh just to accomplish just to accomplish the right thing as the word Goes Forth I think it's just it's a it's a great makeup tonight of people to hear this he says it used to be in a home that father the head of the house would sit down in the morning and would speak with his family and they would all take out the old Family Bible and just read a little bit and gather around the table and have prayer he saiding that's the way that it used to be and we all said amen because that's the way that it used to be and uh we don't even know what an old family Bible is anymore it's like is that an an app you haven't updated yet uh but it's an old we take out the old Family Bible and you read it for a little bit and everybody have prayer so now he's wants to think of the way that it used to be we might say well the good old days well it was a day when Christ was still in the church he says you don't see that anymore and when they the day was done and Ma had the dishes washed they'd all gather around re Gather in and read some more the Bible and pray before going to bed so they started their day reading the Bible entered their day reading the Bible and in prayer he said this is the way the days looked like and I'm just wanting you to ponder these days versus our days or even our own lives he says juvenile delinquency certainly was a hard thing to find in them days the boys went to the fields to work and the girls help Mom with washing down at the creek but today we push a little button and the dishes are all done and M's in the car and gone to the card part a card party or out she's riding around over the streets and the work's done by a tractor and we just don't have nothing but just a bunch of lazy Idol people they you could put these in more even in modern terms in the sense that all the all the things that we've done to try to make life easier hasn't bought us more time we don't have any more time now than when you had to wash the dishes by hand or go down to the creek to get water we've lost time even with having uh infrastructure with plumbing and water inhouse and everything that we have and push a button and wash the dishes he says but people he's saying people have by The Virtue that become lazy and where where is it they've become lazy he say home life is so neglected until the Bible's laidback till they have have to hunt for an hour to find one in many homes in America now you may laugh at this but I was in the home of a minister one time who who who was being critical of the word of God and he and he was trying to refer to a scripture and I just said well what scripture are you referring to and he goes well I I don't have my Bible I'm like well brother you're a pastor of a church surely there's a Bible in your house somewhere and I guess there just wasn't one with Within Reach cuz he didn't want to go there and get scripture with me but he says till the Bible's laidback and they'd have to hunt for an hour to find one in many homes in America I wonder just how applicable that is for some homes that we might visit where's the Bible and he makes the statement just a little bit later he says home life is running out now I just want you to catch this contrast that he's identifying in these things that seem to be competing uh for time we don't we don't have have to handwash the dishes but what has that bought us time to do what what what's taking up our time and he says home life is neglected how is home life neglected to the point to where the Bible's not even able to be found he says it's it's just running out makes this statement in the sermon unwelcomed Christ he says we failed to entertain Jesus after we've invited him to our place he's drawing the parallel of how Simon had invited Christ and he was the unwelcomed Christ and he sat there with uh Dirty Feet just a Wallflower in a party that he was was invited too he says many time you're too busy at home in your home life you've got so many things to do you can't take time to pray just too busy is this is this true yes I remember when I was doing a youth uh a youth convention in South Africa and on one of the morning Services I think they had like five services in a day and their first morning service was really really early thankfully I didn't preach very many of those but um uh I remember one particular one uh brother kidan had asked all the young people and brother villy that church there in Johannesburg was the host church and brother Gideon running it and he's the pastor there now he asked all the young people uh what their typical day or how much time they spent in prayer and how much time they spent reading their Bibles and in the word of God and and he kind of got an aggregate of everybody how much they got and then he kind of went along a little bit further and he said let's map out your days and said what do you guys do what time do you wake up and you got a consensus of when they wake up then what's the next thing you do and everybody went through and as a few hundred young people charted out what would have been like the average day of of of these these young people and when it was all done they had their entire day mapped out from the time they wake up to the time they go to sleep and when they did their schedule there wasn't one place in there where they said they actually prayed or read their Bibles even though they had said well we do it 20 minutes we do it 30 minutes we're doing it for an hour but when it came down to actually filling out the schedule there really there was no place in it where they were actually doing it you just get too busy you've got so many things you have to do I've been pondering on it too maybe use it as a principle that's instructive to us but I I actually am trying to be more disciplined even in the language I use I don't even say I'm busy anymore because I'm I have time I'm the master of my own time to say I'm busy is to say well I I maybe I'm too important for you or or it even means I'm subject to whoever needs my attention and I'm bound to my schedule and I'm bound to appointments and I'm bound to all these things that demand my time I'm not too busy I'm not even busy I have things I need to do and and I'm the master of my own time and even in a way start changing the language we use about ourselves so that we say wait a minute I'm not subject to this world I'm not subject to its demands I'm not subject to its economics and I have time to make time for Jesus so you got so many things you have to do you can't take time to pray just too busy too busy in your home life in Deuteronomy chapter 6 this was our text I really like how um there many different principles in this and I think I'm just I just have time maybe to read it to you and touch on some of these things but let's uh let's look at verse well just verse six and he says and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart so the word must be in our hearts it's where it must be as parents the word must be in our heart now the word in our heart notice what he says and thou th shalt teach them diligently unto thy children now there is a a there is an inference here at least that we could at least make that the word is in our hearts as the parents and it's not they our our children having not experienced the same birth we have need to be taught the word which we've received says Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children what what the word in your heart and shalt talk them when thou sest in thy house you're like okay good we'll just we just won't sit very often in our house and when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down and when thou risest up I would say it's probably even just a figurative language to express talk about it rehearse it don't let it ever become unfamiliar I've been studied on the the the the concept of the word is NY and and how that in in that very meaning it's you're familiar with it yes you know it this isn't unfamiliar to you it's not like all of a sudden it's not riding these things on day one well we hear there's a strange guy come as a delivery while they're in Egypt no they had been around it so long it was something familiar to them and so we must teach the word to our children talk about it to them when we're walking when we're standing when we're coming when we're going it says Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be frontlets between Thine Eyes what is it trying to express this is something that has preeminence the word is something familiar the word is something that are our children know it's something we talk about it's something that we are identified with and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates there has to be constant reminders a and o opportunities to lift up the word of God write them upon the post of the house and on thy Gates talk about it to your children teach them diligently unto your children I would say this is not just an Old Testament precept but this is a present day commandment to us within our families that we the word that is in our heart we ought to teach diligently to our children talk to them about this word when we're in our homes when we walk in the way when we lay down when we rise up there's the morning there's the evening there's everything in between there's somehow that the word of God is having preeminence and he says and it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swear un thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildest not and houses full of all good things which thou fillest not Wells dig which thou diggest not not Vineyards and olive trees which thou plest not when thou shalt have eaten and be full what do you have good goodly and great cities you have houses full of good things you have wells you have Vineyards think of all the things God provides by his word and he says then beware then beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage taken out of the house of bondage the word of God provides all these things he he's saying teach them diligently under your children rehearse them to them talk about it keep it always fresh in their mind what God did for you to bring you out of the house of bondage let the supernatural always be something that is expected amongst in your family believe for the supernatural believe in the hand of God believe in healing how many parents can testify how wonderful it is when someone's sick and something's wrong and it's one of your children that says how about we just pray I remember one time there's a maybe a very uh terrific event in a terrifying way taking place in our in our lives and Elizabeth and I were just concerned about it in prayer Elliot was really really young and maybe just even four or five years old he walked in the room he said well all things work together for the good like whatever that means to a 5-year-old that's wonderful but that's the that's what you want sometimes is just that reminder hey we can always pray right Dad we can always do this and that's a way that we can it's even what's beautiful about it is if we could share the word of God to our children they're going to take it and just accept it by faith accept it in its Purity accept it for just the way that you've presented to them and they don't have all the Decades of doubting that we do well I don't know about this and I don't know about that well I had this situation one time they just take God his word and they can believe and they can actually be a mirror for you sometimes when we really need it teach them diligently and it says beware lest thou forget the Lord so I think there's a connection there even to the great and goodly cities and the house is full of all good things it's coming from these people who have the word in their heart who teach it diligently to their children and they're sure to never forget the Lord but if you do what happens you're going to go right back to a house of bondage again a home can become a house of bondage I love how brother brandham tells the story in perseverance and just the I think this is paragraph 25 in paragraph 16 he's talking about Noah now he sat down he read his Bible to family he rehearsed these things to his family then he uses David as an example he says look at David Little David no doubt raised in a lovely believing home his father Jesse a great man no doubt gathered all those boys around at night and had family prayer before they went to bed probably read the Scrolls and talked about great Jehovah that had opened up the Red Sea and a great prophet Moses had brought them out following the pillar of fire all these things that created faith when David is out there in the field tending his father's sheep where did David have the background and a resource how did he even have it in his mind to believe that he could defeat the lion he could defeat the Bear in family devotions where is it our children are going to gain the the confidence to withstand Temptation at school family devotions where are they going to have the confidence withstand pressure within family gatherings amongst unbelievers where are they going to withstand it when they're in their own private time on their computers or their phones where are they going to draw Str when we in our homes have lifted up Christ and put the put the right things before them he says faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God Little David got to thinking on that of course he was kind of the smallest one of the family so they put him out to watch the Sheep watch a few sheep and he was responsible for those sheep and one day a lion came in and got one he thought now what am I going to say to my father about this sheep being missing and he happened to remember that my father read from the Scrolls and told me that God was a great God to deliver his people and that he would bless Israel and he was with Israel and I am one of them and all that circumcise circumcised and in the Covenant God's blessing is upon them and I'm one of them I'm circumcised and God's blessings upon me I have a right one of my father's sheep is gone so I'm going after that sheep where's David drawn the strength we could say well he was ordained do it and he had the Heart Of God well God committed him to a father named Jesse who cultivated whatever God had put in him by election or by natural makeup it took this time of the father reading the Bible Gathering the sons together he says and having family prayer before they went to bed and he says very plainly that created Faith think about that that created Faith through those family gatherings those times together where we just kind Maybe be hinting at it right now but I believe one of the best ways we can as a family guard against overemphasizing carnal things is by having time around spiritual things specifically in family devotions prayer time before we go to bed reading the Bible there's so much uh access to good uh to the message of the hour and and the in the word of God and the right things that we should be taking time for that in Psalms 127 ver1 except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain is everybody heard that scripture before very very uh familiar scripture except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it it's important to note that you still have to labor because they you have to be laboring but except the Lord build with you and labor with you all your building is in vain it's important for the Watchman to continue to watch and to wake but except the Lord keep the city he's waking in vain so the labor is necessary the waking is necessary but it's all worthless unless God does it with us so unless the Lord build the house except the Lord keep the city as we read in the very beginning brother B saids now you're going to build a house you first lay the foundation you got to have a found Foundation to build your house on I believe that as men we are called to be home builders and as ladies you are called to be home makers so there's things that we we ought to be building things we ought to be doing and it relates to the home the home life the things that we're called to do as man and woman and but except the Lord build the house you're going to labor in vain even if you're building except the Lord keep the city the Watchman waketh but in vain so the Lord has to be have has to have preeminence and the sermon believest thou this brother bradam says when Jesus goes away from your home sickness and sorrow will come in just a very uh very simple formula when Jesus goes away from your home sickness and sorrow will come in you can say well this family's sick did Jesus leave their home well they may be sick but I know there's no sorrow it's the despair that comes if Jesus is in your home and you're sick then there's a different attitude and approach that you take it's not just wow people who suffer calamities have rejected Christ but it's the sorrow it's the despondency it it's the despair he's saying when Jesus goes away from your home this is the principle it's trouble that's on the way when Jesus leaves the home he says if you turn Jesus down at your home how do you turn down Jesus at your home quit having family prayer quit having Bible readings and so forth in your home look for trouble to come in I I if you are a believer I this is a simple principle that you ought to always remind yourself that if trouble's at your doorstep ask yourself are we doing the things that we know we ought to be doing as Believers because if not it's probably the explanation as to why trouble's there and you know then I better address these things to deal with the trouble and then if you're doing all these things and troubles at the door then you got you have confidence amen you have confidence you're prepared you you know how to prepare yourself you know how to face the trouble when Jesus goes away from your home you turn him down by not having family prayer not having Bible readings and so forth look for trouble to come in why if you're sewing de carnal things and you're sewing you're you're going to reap bre uh breed shallow things Hollow things empty things and there's going to be a fear frustration and Trouble on its way this one will be a fun one to try to figure out what in the world brother man's talking about here but in the message influences he says then we find other things it used to be wrong long for the Holiness people to attend bioscop or movies you know says now they got all the time now they go all the time and then Satan pulled a fast one on you and put the television right in your house and fixed it in there he says but all these things that it used to be wrong now it might be peculiar to some people you might think oh well here it goes but just give an honest look to it give an honest look even today there's a lot of scholarship there's even a lot of you'll find it even with the what's being expressed by The Poets and by the writers is all the ills of media and the influence of Hollywood and the influence of Television the influence of movies and there may be one side that tries to blame every mass shooting on video games or every time there's violence they try to blame it on on rap or something like that there's all sorts of platitudes on either side but they can all agree that there's a lot of stuff that's coming from these channels that's in influenc in the way that people think and the way that they act you can see the wisdom of having these an arms length relationship to these he says well what is it it comes in so gradual until the first thing you know it's just got you it's like a Vine growing around you now if you'll keep that vine away from you and just keep wrapped around Jesus around the word and stay with that you'll grow straight that's crooked and it pulls you off the road but these other influences the these the carnal things it's just a simple principle the all the channels and the outlets that you can that you can get carnal things through all the markets all the means whether it be the cell phones the tablets the video games whatever it is you can just think about it in your own way what conduit the carnal things comes through if you want to feed on that you can expect a particular result and said it's going to grow you crooked it's going to pull you off the road it's going to cause you to think about things and lust for things and desire to do certain things and it's going to pull you off the road he says but if you stay wrapped up in Christ you'll grow straight he says Christ pulls you up that pulls you sideways how do people get bent how do they get sideways it's by the things that you feed on the things that have preeminence right job said it in job 48 even as I have seen they that plow iniquity and so wickedness reap the same job had it right they that plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap what iniquity in wickedness you can't expect to uh um to sew to the Flesh and get spiritual things what do they say is it the definition of insanity is to continue to do the same thing and expect different results and that would be Insanity I keep I keep banging my head against the wall and I keep having headaches and he's said that there's a you got to ponder if you're Soul plowing iniquity sewing wickedness you're going to reap iniquity you're going to reap wickedness so the right the right emphasis as we're saying we do not want to overemphasize carnal things because of the the the the detrimental impact of these carnal things and yes we have to give attention to them but an overemphasis will spill us over into the wrong way pull us sideways as it says then we realize that the right emphasis will bring the right atmosphere the right atmosphere will bring the right results the right the right emphasis will bring the right atmosphere you have you have remarkable power within your homes and among your relationships with your children even your spouse you have a remarkable power to emphasize the right thing and in doing so create the right atmosphere even in conversations and when difficulties come up there's a way that things could happen immedately can just focus on the negative but there's even a way to approach very disasters and calamities and differences and and struggles and problems even with our children and waywardness whatever it may be there's a positive approach and there's a right emphasis that can bring the right atmosphere that's going to bring the right results in the message his wonders to perform I'm almost done tonight isin't that wonderful I'm glad you laughed and didn't say Amen real loud but in his in his message his wonders to perform this statement is so profound the reason we don't have the spiritual blessings all right take it off let's just think about that what's the reason we don't have spiritual blessings should we break out into some uh discussion groups right why don't we have spiritual blessings and I could imagine if we had just presented this as a a subject amongst ministers breakout session why don't we have spiritual blessings well you see brother Aon we haven't placed the seven Thunders just exactly where they need to be the reason why we don't have spiritual blessings is not everybody is speaking in tongues the reason and all these things we can come up with why we don't have spiritual blessings and I'm telling you what I'm about to read you it may be in the language of the 19 60s but put it in the language of 2022 and you'll find the principal is the same today as it has ever been go ahead and show that brother John the reason we don't have the spiritual blessings we have too much time to watch television too much time to read the newspapers those are things that they used to throw on your lawn they printed it out today it's just on websites the newspapers are listen to something that we ought not to be listening to they've just made it too easy haven't they whether it be podcast whether it be uh YouTube Spotify Apple music You Name It Whatever it might be it's just too easy these days to have at our fingertips so many things to listen to to read and to keep our thoughts and he says and we're not Redeeming the time but we are giving it to the things of the world instead of our time to the Lord Jesus and the Bible said that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God Christians live on the word amen the reason why we don't have spiritual blessings we're given too much time to the world and not enough time to the word it's that simple enough to where if someone said I I just don't believe I have any spiritual blessings the spiritual blessings have dried up just do an audit do it an AIT in your life and ask yourself how much do I give to the world how much do I give to the word and and I'd had these notes and I I kind of pushed them off thinking we could expound upon it at another service to Greater depth but I'll just make reference to here we might think in our minds well if I need to give equal time to the word or more time to the word we think that means kneeling and praying it means reading our Bibles or you know being some Franciscan monks or something like that and and fasting and just transcribing the scripture on uh paper towels or something but it it it's not it's not those kind of things alone if you want to write the Bible on a paper to that's fine but it's not those kind of religious sacrifices and reading and praying alone and I'm not making light of reading and praying because we think in the terms of I want to spe feed on spiritual things we I think I'm going to pray to Christ I'm going to read my Bible I'm going to listen to the word of God those are all part of it but you can sew to the spirit and you can do uh emphasize spiritual things by doing things for others by living for others by by by finding out what the needs might be by giving yourself to serice I I I I I want to emphasize this now because it's going to be one of the points of emphasis on the series of our family tree that this church is becoming a place is a place for you to serve it is a place for you to give it is a place for you to find things that are enriching and fulfilling and say well I want to I want to stop sewing to carnal things well there's things that you can do to sew to spiritual things and it doesn't just evolve being alone and praying and fasting but there's a way that you can be looking out on the needs of others and mindful of the things that are taking place around you and in doing so you're sewing to the right things Christians can live on the word not just by only reading the Bible and praying but that being translated into a life of service remember for sister Elizabeth and I when we we lived here in Phoenix before our neighbors were brother Robert and sister Jill McGary and one of the things that stood out to us that we loved so much is they were teaching their family to serve and it was something they did it was something they did as a family it was something that they their home was always welcoming and and still is and and their Spirits just just free in that regards and it was something that inspired us and even to this day we use uh those mcgar without an e I'm not going to say it represents Elohim or anything like that but they spell their names a little bit differently but it was it's still an inspiration to us that we want our children to be servants we want them to serve other people we want them to give and I'd say that's something that uh the mcgar were doing and and to so to spiritual things and I bet they could testify they've benefited from it and we are the recipients of it as it became a tremendous example to us in Galatians chapter 6: 7 8 and N this is my last scripture that I'm going to read tonight he says be not deceived God is Not mocked that should get our attention for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption Paul is very deliberate in the way that he phrases this he wants us to understand that if we that if we're if if we think that we can bypass this law we're deceiving ourselves because God will not be mocked you can't seow something and not reap it you reap what you sow is the phrase that we might use succinctly but it says whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap so he brings it and he's very deliberate in his language he that Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption if you go to carnal things you're going to reap corruption in carnal things because of carnal things there's going to be a detriment there's going to be a loss it's going to be carnality that you begin to experience he says but he that Seth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting this in no way places it within our power to seow seeds of eternal life that we could be saved or somehow if we sow to the spirit we're going to reap eternal life but this speaks of our spiritual condition and even the fruitfulness of Our Lives I could say now God is Not mocked as Believers filled with the Holy Ghost if the word is in your heart and you sow to the spirit you're going to reap spiritual benefits a fruitful life but if you sow to the flesh you're going to reap carnality it's going to tend to corruption it's going to be what erodes the atmosphere in our homes it's what breeds fear and causes frustration and it just seems maybe you could fellowship with me a little in this it just seems that we're always living on a Razor's Edge right right where things just seem really really awesome and things are going really really good like you know what this is the happiest day of my life this is awesome God you're so good and then one moment later it's like oh my goodness what happened right you know how it feels sometimes brother Travis where it's like everything's great next thing you know it's like hey I didn't even have to travel down the hill I just fell right off a cliff because it just seems like a Razor's Edge it's just there you're just always so close to frustration always so close to hurt always so close to pain always so close to the bad all the more we ought to be more careful and deliberate in the way that we step because we're on this precipice now where it's just not easy anymore for Christians Christians don't sin cheaply we don't doubt cheaply there's a cost there's a detriment there there maybe there was a time when it seemed like we had this great huge buffer in this great huge gap but we're living in a time where Satan has pressed himself right up to the precipice he's right there waiting to catch you and to snare you and we have to be more deliberate and on guard than we ever have in any time because it's just a Razor's Edge amen and I love verse n and let us not be weary and wello let us not be weary and well-doing what a tremendous admonition do not be weary and well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not in other words continue to sww to the right things there is a payoff I would even say this to parents if you sew do the right things with your your children don't fret there will be a payoff in our own families if you're doing the right thing and doing the right thing and things just don't seem to be rewarding things don't seem to be coming upright stick with it sew to the right things and don't be weary in sewing to the right things because there will be a harvest amen there will be a harvest say it with me there will be a harvest all right the message influences just two statements to close on I think this one will get our attention I think today our great problem of what we believe to be juvenile delinquency is parent delinquent a home delinquent I've noticed this in some of the news stories as of late or just several the last over the last many many years you'll find that there seems to be something broken in the home life behind the headlines right and you say well it's juvenile delinquency but there's it may not all the I wouldn't want to generalize not in every case but you often find the Home was broken he says I know there's sometimes the schools and things he says and and now it making the hes broken he says I know sometimes there's schools and things but notice what he says here and Sunday school about a half hour or an hour on Sunday morning so we get put the kids in Sunday school and the world has the kids the rest rest of the week and cram into them more than a teacher and many times too many times the teacher's got a little quarterly that she teaches out of while she paints her lips and fixes her hair lets the children do the best they can and then at home they get no Christian training at all now to me the two most the two most important phrases here is they come to church on Sunday morning and the world has them the rest of the week and then when at home they get no Christian training at all you you following that they come to church on Sunday morning then they go out in school and they're in school for several hours a day five days a week and then what's happening at home brother bram's not saying what happening at school is the problem it's what's not happening at home that's the problem says that the world will cram into them everything they can the rest of the week and the det real detriment is there's no at home they get no Christian training at all I if if you feel led if you do not feel led to homeschool your kids then by all means don't force yourself to homeschool I think sometimes there can be this pressure that's put on uh people you got a home school you got a homeschool you got to do what God wants you to do you got to do what you know you can do you got to do know do what you have faith to do and my mother-in-law had this Faith to send her kids to public school she knew that in doing so she could honor the Lord and I believe that if we are in a situation where we either feel led to sin s our kids or we have to send our kids there should there I understand the fear and the fretting but remember home life has the ability to inoculate them against school life because it's not so much oh don't send your kids to school he's saying just be sure they get Christian training at home just be sure they're being taught the right things at home it's the training that you do not just in Sunday school on Sunday morning but it's the training that you do throughout the week with your children by teaching them diligently talking to them and when you're walking when you're Rising when you're sitting when you're coming and you're going by binding these things about towards before them that's the kind of training that strengthens them against the rest of the week we have an obligation we have a duty to train them my final statements from The Sermon Just One More Time Lord It's just asking some questions we're closing here so we're just asking some question questions he says you fathers you mothers are you ready to establish an altar in your house and take that television out I'm I'm not asking I'm not the one asking all right ponder it are you ready to take that deck of cards off the table now just think of the equivalent right just think of the equivalent this phrase here should get our attention them comic books that your children's reading preparing their little mind for a blast that the devil's going to give them what do these things prepare our children's mind for a blast that the devil's going to give them we're either preparing our children for Spiritual things or you're going to be preparing them for carnal things you're either going to be developing an appetite for the right things or an appetite for who knows what else and even in the comic books he says it's preparing in their mind for a blast that the devil's going to give them it's laying a foundation for future temptation is that what we want to be doing in our homes laying a foundation for future Temptation I had a brother sharing with me an experience that he had just as a teenager where he was reading a a book that we might think is completely ah well it's just all fantasy you know what's the harm minut it but there was a seed sewn in that that pushed him in a direction it in in in a in in a in a bondage that was terrible very very horrible for him and and and it was something so would seem so innocent oh that's just harmless and I'm not trying to get us all suspicious well what was it brother Aaron what was it uh I I want you just to think of your own experiences because this brother gained something from that and now today he's very circumspect about influences and the things he allows his children to feed on because he realizes as just a young teenager just one little example uh opened up something to him that brought great pain and hardship to his life and we have to realize that there's things we can expose our children to now that's laying the foundation for future Temptation only making it easier for them to say yes to the devil all by the things we expose them to now brother Aon this is real legalistic preaching this is really Clos line preaching what's legalistic about it I haven't told you one thing that you should do right I'm getting you to think about it and if it's if it's making you get a little bit defensive maybe you need to lean into that a little bit and ask yourself hm why am I getting so defensive why is the devil whispering in my ear that guy's oldfashioned he doesn't know what he's talking about oh my goodness he's another stick in the mud you know no fun no good guy and you're over there going this is awful this is horrible we're living in 2022 we're free really are you on he says are you ready to establish the old family altar again or do you just want to continue on the way you are I'd like to be able to do it Brothers we have a altar that was given to us from Cornerstone Christian Tabernacle I think we have enough room to put it here there there's a shorter one I almost brought it in here tonight and I believe we ought to have that place we could pray here we may not have a lot of room but I think we got room to pray and and I want you to think about it tonight as we close are you ready to establish the old family altar again does that phrase mean anything to some of you tonight the old family altar did did you have a concept of that brother Wes the old family altar brother Manuel is our concept the old family altar you know some of us were raised in homes where we didn't pray at night as families we didn't do devotions we we we didn't have we didn't have any kind of Str structure within our families where there was some point during the day in our time together at some point even though it could have been very very small some of us don't even have that at all in our history family history to draw from and so I'm going to tell you right now that this is a tremendous principle that we can gain as families to find some way on a consistent and regular basis to have a family altar brother Aaron does that mean we have to have a big huge Bible and a place with a doily underneath it and a little table and we all get together and we kneel down and we pray doesn't have to be exactly structured that way but just find some way as a family to get around the word and talk about the things of God and you know what's so beautiful about that that creates Faith with our heads bowed tonight I ask you are you ready to establish the family altar again I'll ask it this way are you ready to emphasize spiritual things or I you just want to continue overemphasizing carnal things our heavenly father as we stand before these people tonight I'm praying for them Lord I'm praying Lord that in this dark day with so many pressures and so many uh feelings in our spirit Lord we may not say that we are but in so many ways we're the very least dependent upon technology if not just outright addicted to it we reach for it Lord and we are drawn to it it's so easy to get a hold of so easy to let it have the prees Lord but father tonight we're just stopping we're just slowing down even in this moment we're just pausing and I'm asking the people tonight if they'd like to take inventory of their lives and find some way to bring you back in our homes some way to let you have the preeminence some way to purpose in our hearts that as a family we'll gather together we'll pray we'll pray at least we'll read a scripture at least we'll we'll testify we'll talk about things we'll we we'll obey this uh command in Deuteronomy to speak about these things that you have done to tell our testimonies to lift up the great things that you've done and Lord I pray tonight that there'd not be one both here part of this church streaming that would say they just want to stay the way they are that no matter how to this point something inside of us is I want to do more I want to do more I pray that you bless these families and bless these people we commit them to you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you let's Stand Together
