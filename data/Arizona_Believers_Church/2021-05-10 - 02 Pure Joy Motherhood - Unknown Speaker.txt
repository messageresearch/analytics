TRANSCRIPT
========================================
again john chapter 16 verses 20 to 22 verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy christ is speaking about even his then his crucifixion is coming and the sorrow that they would experience a woman when she is in travail have sorrow because her hours come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world and ye thou therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you amen you may be seated continue on the subject of pure joy and i felt directed the lord just kind of directed me to the subject of motherhood and how appropriate for mother's day and it just seemed like certain subjects that who'd been i had been studying and pondered uh kind of intersect a little bit and we could use this example of motherhood so i feel very directed to do this to speak on the topic i do not think that we should just grab a subject to speak on just because it is a particular holiday or particular day nor do i think that we should avoid it just because it is that particular holiday a particular day but we desire the lord to give us leadership um to to speak on the things that he would have us to speak on and just to reset a few things about the pure joy that we're uh wanting to explore is we're kind of approaching the thought of experiencing god's full joy while surrounded by conflict and chaos and confusion and really ourselves as believers experiencing and living and having the fullness of joy regardless of what takes place in the world even as some of the songs have ministered that regardless of what's taking place in our lives there's something within us that we're tied to that's more than life itself that's more than circumstance it's more than situation and we derive a satisfaction and a fulfillment from it and so pure joy as we're pondering it is a joy with a divine origin this is not a joy that we experience when we accomplish something in the flesh this is not a joy that we can feel when we ride a ride or we go hunting and we go fishing and so it's not that type of happiness or joy that we're talking about nor is it a psychological defense or some sort of mechanism that we use to tell ourselves everything's okay and i'm sure um you've seen that meme where there's a i don't know if it's a character or whatever it is from a cartoon or something but it shows looks like a little dog sitting there with a coffee cup in the house that's burning down and i think it says i'm fine that's cognitive dissonance and he may see they might be setting forth the principle that in the midst of a fire i'm fine everything's okay but that's not the joy i'm talking about not a psychological defense mechanism that we all have that convinces ourselves that even though we didn't get the promotion or even though we had our savings account drained by through fraud and the bank's not going to give it back i'm somehow happy and okay with that we're talking about a different kind of joy that transcends emotion and so there is a joy that we can look into the scripture and find that is a strength there's a joy that is a power there's a joy that is something that is divine not just a uplifting uplifting emotion or something that we experience in a moment i i'd like for you to um as best as you can just focus on this part because it's very important to the foundation of going into the subject of motherhood and i want to if god would allow us to look into this more deeply in the scripture in the message of the hour but when we talk about joy it's important to catch this joy is connected with purpose and and and i want you to think about this and ponder it very deeply that joy is connected with purpose so it's not just the fleeting or temporal happiness not just something we experience in a moment but it's connected with purpose and to have joy and to experience joy that we're talking about a scriptural joy it's about doing what is worth doing it's about accomplishing something that's worth accomplishing so it's about having meaning and not just doing things and experiencing things that make us happy and there's so much to unpack and so much to share when it comes to understanding happiness and human emotions of happiness and our pursuit of happiness and i'd really like to look at it and explore it very deeply but there's a hedonic happiness we were actually going to talk about eating where you just eat for pleasure on wednesday night we didn't have a chance to get to it but there's a a hedonic pleasure or happiness that we experience where we're just we're just experiencing pleasure something that makes us feel good and we could say that's pleasure for the sake of feeling happier happiness for the sake of making our body feel good but joy is something where you're fulfilling a purpose or if i can put it this way living meaningfully you're having meaningful experiences you're doing something that's meaningful so we talk about happiness well that could just be hedonism where you're just oh i feel good that was great that made my body feel good but when we talk about joy we're talking about experiencing something that is fulfilling or rather living a meaningful life in john chapter 3 verse 29 john the baptist has come to him and it's just a remarkable reading how that they come to him and they say hey you know this guy that you told us was the messiah he's baptizing people and john is like okay you know that's who i i said that's the one that you should follow that was the one that was coming after me and so john is answering this question about whether or not this one is doing the right thing and he makes this comment he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice and what a beautiful picture of john the baptist who is allah is coming in as a forerunner in the spirit of elijah who has now pointed the people to the messiah and the messiah is there baptizing and people are coming to him and everybody's like oh well what about elijah what about his message and and what about john and what about him shouldn't we be following him still john says no i'm the friend of the bridegroom my whole purpose was to see that this happens i'm here here to make way for the the bridegroom and now that they're together and they're in fellowship i'm rejoicing it says he rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice and then he says this my joy therefore is fulfilled and this is where we can see that scripturally joy is connected with something that is fulfilling joy is connected with purpose because he says my joy is complete if if this had not happened i would not be fulfilled if this had not happened then my joy would be partial or maybe it would just be happiness or it'd be maybe i would be maybe he's even suggested there'd be some disappointment had this not happened she says my joy is complete and that's because joy is connected with fulfillment and so this is joy scripture it's to accomplish something that you're sent out to do john says i this my joy is complete my joy is finished because he had done what he was supposed to do and in the scripture even the word that's used for joy and there's a connection there's a tremendous connection of joy with peace we say shalom and shalom being used as a greeting i we say that it means peace but and it does mean peace and it's connected with with joy this joy that i'm talking about it but in the in the greek to the the word joy that's used actually is used in a phrase to say be well if you wish someone joy or use this phrase joy it means to thrive or to be well so joy is connected with thriving joy is connecting to being well and i can remember uh brother greg alford one time we were hosting him and showing him around to do something and i think he went in to do something he came back out and i said well did you find what you're looking for he says no joy and he used this phrase to describe when something some expectation had not been met or he hadn't fulfilled his purpose rather did you find what you're looking for no joy didn't find any joy didn't have any joy and so it's connected with fulfilling something it's connected with something that has meaning and so a life to live well is what we're talking about when we say joy pure joy is connected with the life that has lived well not just a life that has lived pursuing fleshly pleasure you say oh this feels good and that was fun we're talking about a life lived well life that is flourishing a life that is thriving now it might not have the same optics to somebody who's standing on the outside looking at it that someone who's living in pleasure would live in but when we talk about pure joy we're not talking about an ecstasy ecstasy or some kind of great feeling in your flesh but something very very deep that's connected with meaning and purpose so we're looking at a life that's lived well versus a life that's lived pursuing the pleasures of the flesh and there's so much that could be said in this vein and i know that we'll have opportunities to look at it better but they've identified through vast studies that have looked at a number of um across cross-sections of cultures and regions and people and found that people with a greater sense of purpose lived longer people who themselves individuals who had a greater sense of purpose lived longer than those who maybe had a less sense of purpose and they actually didn't just live longer they lived better so this is science taking a look at individuals who aren't necessarily christians because they've done this in japan they've done in different places that we might say are not christian cultures and they found that as long as a person had a sense of purpose and lived a meaningful life they lived longer and they didn't just live longer but they lived better and one particular book that is very fascinating on this subject is by victor franco and he he was a jew that was in a concentration camps there's a survivor of a concentration camp during world war ii and he wrote a book about the i think his man's search for meaning is the name of the book and what he kind of pulls together and this is me just maybe using some summary language but he's basically sets forth that man's deepest longing is to find meaning and that for humankind not just a man but for humankind their strongest desire is to find some meaning and he calls it their primary motivational force now just so this begins to make some sense to you and you don't feel like we kind of left a sermon and now we're kind of in a psychology class this is what explains religion this is what explains the belief that the son is a god and beliefs that the water is a deity and beliefs and mythology it's always for man to somehow ascribe meaning to their existence and how they navigate that by pleasing gods or pleasing deities or why did this happen to athenia well this god got mad and he wiped it out because this person cheated with that person and this happened and they try to explain everything and give purpose and meaning to advance why because it's one of men's primary or it's the primary motivational force to make sense of life does it have meaning does my life have meaning is it for a purpose and so he's talking about man's deepest desire strongest longing is to find meaning and he makes this statement in his book this is this is so good this is so good life is not primarily a quest for pleasure as freud believed because freud as a psychologist kind of framed everything in the sense of law desires and and if you say something uh well it reminds me of one of my greatest statements i've ever made while preaching is i made the comment i never wanted to be a lawyer and freud would say well that's you said that it was a freudian slip because i was wanting to say liar and i said i don't want to be a lawyer and i said liar lawyer just the whole meeting broke up and i think we just began to sing take the name of jesus with you acapella because there was no getting them back in at that point and i remember saying well that was a freudian slip like there's something deep lurking inside of me where i really didn't want to be a lawyer someone would say what's the difference lawyer liar uh but they said that's a freudian slip why because deep in your psychology somewhere life is about desires and if you if you dream about money it means you have a lush spirit if you dream about lust you're greedy for money and so freud framed things in the sense that man's quest was for pleasure but then he says life's not primarily a quest for power so he says life's not primarily a quest for pleasure as freud believed or a quest for power as alfred adler taught but a quest for meaning that somehow that man is going to make sense he's going to feel of some sense of accomplishment as long as he can ascribe meaning to things that take place in his life he's going to be endure certain difficulties as long as he has some sort of goal in mind and he points out viktor frankl points out that without meaning life becomes full of vice or bad habits without meaning life can become just purely hedonistic and it's full of pleasures and materialism and hatred and boredom and jealousies he says this is what comes from a lack of meaning and lack of purpose now there are some amens that start working in our spirits if you can start looking at this in the context of the ultimate purpose of creation and god's desire for humanity but viktor frankl is identifying that something that's rooted within man that if he doesn't have a purpose he tends to do things that are destructive or to live in a way that only graciates his base instincts and his desires and to feel satisfied and it's what leads to criminal behavior and fraud and drug abuse and alcohol abuse saying he's looking so people without meaning are the ones that are going to tend to do the things that only satisfy the flesh and enter into some cycle of destructive behavior and so if you if if we think about it in that context that joy relates to purpose and joy is about a life that's lived well a life that's thriving that even the word joy speaks of being well or thriving joy then is not the aim in other words we don't say well i just want to be happy and and sometimes i think we kind of say that in a way that is uh a little bit of a barb or condescending well i sure hope you're happy and uh i hope you're happy now are you happy i hope you and it's kind of used in a sense to kind of make a person feel like uh they've done something wrong but joy so our goal well why did you do this and why well i'm just trying to find happiness i'm just trying to find happiness that's not the goal pure joy is not necessarily the the object or the goal that you work for joy is not the aim but rather joy is the outcome of our pursuit of fulfilling our purpose joy is kind of the byproduct it's what comes out of our pursuit of doing what we ought to do as we've been looking at blessed is he who hungers and thirst after righteousness that's the condition as he ought to be to fulfill your purpose to be right and so if we are doing what we know we are called to do there's a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment that comes with it so we're not just do do what makes you happy and do what makes you feel good and do what's going to give you some sort of satisfaction you've got to do what you're called to do you've got to do what fulfills your purpose and in just doing what you know fulfills your calling and doing what you know fulfills your purpose believe it or not there's a joy to be had in fine doing that and i believe what the world tries to do is paint a different kind of picture where it's like well you just kind of have to find that needle in the haystack that's going to make you happy you got to find this you got to find that do this or something that's going to make you happy but really it's about me living a meaningful life and living a life well and living a life according to values and precepts and i'm talking about the word of god and that in doing that you're going to find there's your pure joy now there's many subjects that could be explored to examine this truth now that we're just not merely trying to find happiness or pursue happiness uh there's actually a book that was very good called it's been a long time since i've read it i'm always kind of maybe a little leery to recommend a title because you never know when it's like brother aaron you recommended that book do you know what's in i'm like i forgot all right just read the cliff notes or i read that in law school sorry um but it was a book that was basically the title was stumbling on happiness and the point was basically we talk about the pursuit of happiness and i still kind of i struggle with that even how it's outlined in our i believe it's our declaration of independence or the constitution of life liberty and the pursuit the pursuit of happiness well there's a dark side to that that if that's what your goal is and we just want to be happy and just do what makes yourself happy and pursue happiness they find that you really don't pursue happiness and find happiness you stumble on it when it relates to the human carnal sense of joy and satisfaction those kind of what makes you happy will find it's not always the thing that you think is going to make you happy that's because the human mind is really really really completely haywire the human mind is messed up it's it it's going to fail us time and time again so we don't just go by the human mind of human emotions so there's many subjects can be explored to find that when you get to get down to purpose and you find meaning that's where there's real joy but i want to use the subject of motherhood to identify how there's actually the a battle for joy that it's something that is available to us and yet when we frame things the wrong way or we place them in the wrong kind of context then we find ourselves wrestling and struggle and the wrestling and struggle is what kind of causes the consternation and disappointment we find ourselves despondent because we're fighting but as we've tried to lifted up this principle last week invert always invert but the michael told me he thought it was always introvert always introvert and he thought he was killing it it was like no it's invert invert always invert and in doing that we find that no if i'm fighting let's look at what's happening what's taking place and we realize no i'm not actually being attacked i'm advancing the word is advancing and we're finding the devil in a hiding spot somewhere in our lives and god said you're going to get out of here so the devil's kind of been woken up and there's a fight there's a struggle taking place because you're conquering territory so every battle doesn't mean oh woe is me i'm in a battle but oh something is being possessed something great is happening and so when we look at motherhood we could use some of these same principles of inversion to to identify how that the devil is trying to steal our joy and so i want to look at this battle for joy within the context of motherhood and it's just so remarkable how it works out that it's on mother's day now just a very simple definition of mother it simply means the female parent and and so if we kind of continue to go with it where we're going we're gonna have to lose a lot of words in our vocabulary but a mother is a female parent or the word is meaning one who has given birth and brother brown even uses this i think in the sermon he preaches mother's day he says it's one who is begotten it's one who's given birth and so a mother being the female parent of a child and we know that the mother would be the one who has given birth she's the one that knows a child has been born she knows that child is hers right i said because and so that she's connected with it and the one that she gives birth and only a woman only a woman can enter the office of motherhood that that motherhood it's mother head it's in the office of being a mother now if we just take those very basic simple points that a mother that a woman is only one who can become a mother and a mother is one that births gives birth to a child that's that's we understand to be motherhood a woman who beca who gives birth to a child becomes a mother yet in the the times that we live in now modern culture devalues this sacred virtue that a woman holds to give birth it devalues this sacred virtue that a woman holds to rear children so a woman is blessed with the capacity or the ability and now speaking in general she is granted the physical characteristics to be able to as she matures to be able to bring forth a child to give birth to a child and so this is something that a woman is made for in general she has this ability to do it and so only a woman can do it only a woman can have a child only a woman can be a mother to a child she has this charge and this this virtue to mother children and then to raise those children to be a mother to them for their lives for their entire life there's one thing about being a mother that i can't personally attest to but there's a but it's even been witnessed too and testify when i say that i'm not a mom so i i don't have personal experience about that's what it means like oh brother aaron doesn't like his mom but when it comes to being a mom if you can you can be a spouse but get divorced and you're no longer a spouse but you never stop being a parent you never stop being a mom if that child dies there's still something that does not change that instinct in that in that mother that that loss that they experience and that suffering that they feel and the children can grow up and move on so there's something extraordinary about this calling to be a mother but yet culture devalues this and in genesis chapter 2 verse 18 it says the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone now i believe this to be very very remarkable we examined it in great detail last year however when god makes this declaration here's a man in eden that was good and things were wonderful and god had placed a man on earth who was in the very image of god but now god's assessment of the man is that it's not good that he should be alone i will make him a help meet for him the takeaway i want to emphasize right now though i know this has been emphasized many many times through the the the history of the word of god we must recognize that man himself was not complete without the woman when god said it's not good he's saying the man is not fulfilled the man is not complete there's still something missing so the man himself and his life would not have been as fulfilling as it was supposed to be without the woman so we have to admit it as men when we get married they say that a man is not complete before he's married and then after that he's finished a man is not complete before he's married but then once he's married then there's there's some completion there's some coming into an office so it's not that the woman was just kind of cooked up uh to kind of help around the the garden but rather man needed the woman to be complete and so though that's something we need to recognize and then also recognize that he says i will make him a help me his work was not finished without her no matter what adam could do he could not finish it without the woman so then the woman now has a very important purpose in god's creation he has meaning to her creation his meaning behind her coming forth god's purpose for a woman now and i feel like we're all family here here and um we're uh you know we're not trying to fight the patriarchy and things like that we can just kind of relax and just preach the word of god but god's purpose for a woman was related to the man this is we believe this to be the creation of man a creation of humanity and when man comes up and then the woman is brought out of the man her she is brought into the picture in with the man in view and with the purpose of bringing forth children so you can't fully understand the woman without the man being in the picture and without the purpose of bringing forth children that this is what gives us uh gives meaning and purpose to the woman now the woman also gives purpose and meaning to the man so it's not just kind of cutting her off and look how she's nothing without the man and you know she's nobody without the man we could emphasize over and over again how the man needed the woman but looking at now the woman her life and her vision and her abilities and her powers are being framed and it's done so with this being brought to the man or that he's being brought to the woman they're being brought together and the purpose of bringing forth children now in titus chapter 2 verses 3 to 5. the aged woman likewise as paul is giving duties to the church he says the aged women they have a duty that they be in behavior as becometh holiness now pay attention to this because sometimes i there's a there's this thought that as long as you're older than somebody else you can always tell them what to do right well i'm older than you the bible says the elders are to teach the younger ones well it's very specific so the age women likewise that they be in behaviors becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children these are things that are being that the the aged women are to teach the younger and as long as their behavior becometh holiness and not false accusers not given to much wine they can be teachers of these things to love their husbands to love their children excuse me so this is saying this is if the aged women are going to teach the younger to love their husbands this is a good thing that they know if they're going to teach them to love their children this is a good thing that the age know that the young must learn and it relates to the purpose of the woman he says to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands let the word of god be not blasphemed and when he's telling them to when he's saying that you should teach them to love their children to love their husbands and to be keepers at home it means to be a guardian of the house even some of the older translations render it the workers at home this is where the woman's role and her purpose and her meaning is being is being formed scripturally now he writes this to timothy first timothy chapter 2 verse 15. just identifying that scripturally when paul was said that we must teach the younger women he teaches them to love their husbands and to love their children why that relates to the purpose of the woman you say well does that what about the man he's told to love his wife so it's not that the man is some independent king uh who can do whatever he wants first timothy chapter 2 verse 15 notwithstanding he's speaking about how the woman was deceived not adam but he says notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety so the woman is brought to a peculiar place before god and man and so with this peculiar position as paul is wrestling with the fact that it was the woman that was deceived and how that a woman does not necessarily she does not occupy an official office within the church to speak or to teach or to have authority or control he's identifying that she's not completely hopeless and she's not cast aside but he says that she is she is saved in childbearing if they continue in faith charity wholeness with sobriety and that word they're saved i know we might think oh well she's saved in childbearing that that means about here eternal salvation but the word saved means to be made whole or healed so it's more than just oh she's saved by confessing the lord jesus christ but there's something within the woman this is all i'm wanting you to take from this is there so you can be pulled into teaching so much more with these scriptures she is saved she is made whole she is actually healed in child bearing i give you permission to amen if you agree but only if you agree only if the holy spirit and you can say it go ahead and let it out it's not going to bother me at all she shall be saved in childbearing she is made whole she's made complete in having children why it's how god made the woman in first timothy chapter 5 verse 14 i will therefore that the younger women and this is even maybe conclusion a conclusion of what he has already expressed in chapter 2 i will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house here's the prophet to this age here's paul laying out these fundamental principles to timothy he's going to teach others these are things that are being established within the christian church and this is a scriptural principle with that this is the general principle that we would lift up this is what we would desire that young women would get married bear children and guide the house this is the glory of the woman this is her calling this is her duty this is what she's called to give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachably reproachally so what is the bible speaking to and identifying that god made the woman with the purpose and that a woman is going to sense fulfillment when she satisfies that purpose there's going to be a sense of accomplishment and i've done something and there's going to be meaning that is that the woman is going to feel this is going to be her glory or her enjoyment when she marries bears children and guides the house there's a benefit there's a reward in doing those things that this is god's purpose this is god's order this is god's program and when a woman does that there's a salvation that comes with it she should love her husband she should love her children be keepers at home these are things that she's called to do now i'm going to acknowledge well let me let me just say this i was had purpose in my heart that maybe it's later on i would say this but i having not necessarily written it down i want to say it now i'm lift what i'm speaking to are the things that we can clearly identify in the word and it should help you understand why when a woman is not able to have a child why it has such a deep impact why it's not it's not something they can just get over and so i do not want to lift these things up to the detriment of any daughter of god who has experienced not being able to have children and just to let this become fester be discouraging if anything it can give you some some means of attacking the devil because that's why you're letting it bother you so much because that's what i was made for because this is what god's word said about me and this is not it's not a bad thing to desire this it's not a wrong thing to have wanted this it's not it's not wrong to believe that a woman would be made this way and a woman should do this and so i'm very very sensitive to the struggle that many of our sisters have in in not being able to conceive and have children and so i don't want to be in any way dismissive of that but if we could just acknowledge it now and say this is why these things are why it is so hard and it's not just something they kind of say ah no big deal now this is the other thing i want to say before we continue this biblical truth and these things we're talking about at best by the world would be considered outdated like if they were going to be kind of nice to us like oh bless your heart your old fashion and so at best it'd be considered outdated at worst it's cast as demeaning or oppressive that to take the woman and a female and say that a woman is made to be a wife and a woman is made to be a mother and this is how god made her they say this is oppression and this is this is the patriarch patriarchy has invented the institution of marriage to subjugate women and make them subject to men and to rule over us and deprive us of all these other rights and privileges that we ought to have and there's a way that they can paint the picture it's like well that kind of makes sense with the way the men have been acting but it's a denial of how god made the woman i'm not commenting on history and i'm not talking about feudal lords in ancient england and i'm not talking about how pharaohs ruled egypt and how the greeks treated their women i'm not talking about cultures in asia i'm talking about the word of god going back to the beginning i'm talking about truth that there's a language that god uses regarding both genders there's a language that god uses about the woman about the man about how he desires them to live and to act and that is the virtuous way to live and that is the only meaningful way to live and that's the only way you're ever going to find pure joy is by finding your place as a man and finding your place as a woman and staying in your place and fulfilling your purpose in that place but the nowadays they would even they might say well that's kind of an old-fashioned way of viewing that and that's kind of an outdated way but i think it's getting more uh uh just uh visceral and angry and vicious venomous and it would be cast as demeaning to women to say that she's made to be a wife it'd be demeaning to a woman to say that she was made to be a mother this this is oppression this is bondage this is a slavery to the woman and i would like to i want you to think about how there's many things that exist in culture and many things that are taught and espoused and believed and lifted up that can be categorized as an agenda against a woman's purpose and any agenda that tries to confuse tear down muddy up or devalue a woman's purpose as an attack on a woman's joy anything that would get to the heart of the what's meaningful to a woman anything that would get to the heart of why she's made and the way that god made her is an attack on the woman's joy it's a direct assault on what's going to make that woman joyful and it's a direct attack on what's going to allow that woman to live a meaningful life in genesis chapter 3 verse 16 under the woman he said this is when the curse is being expressed to the woman i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children now we should not read this to suggest that prior to the sin she was not going to bring forth children but rather we should read it that there's going to be sorrow conjoined with it that though at one time whatever by whatever means they would have brought forth children adam and the woman by mixing themselves together would have brought forth children now she is it's going to be something that's painful a travail a great labor and a great pain to her she's going to bring it forth in sorrow then he makes the statement and thy desire shall be to thy husband but or and he shall rule over thee now it's interesting the language that's used that you're you're gonna have pain labor pains it's gonna be hard it's gonna be difficult upon the body to give birth to children and and this is a consequence of the original sin and to say your desire is gonna be to your husband telling the woman that she should only have her desires to her husband but then he is going to rule over you it's a very strange phrase but the way that it's used it can have tremendous application in different ways but it identifies something this is to me what's really remarkable as i pondered this here the woman is going to be she has the role she was suited for bringing for children but now after the fall something has been breached and broken within the harmonious relationship between the man and the woman headship has been broken through the act of redemption adam carries or carries her over into a fallen world but now something there's been a fracture within the the arrangement of the man and the woman and because of what she did something's introduced into the human race and god is identifying what's going to happen to the woman and he says you're going to desire to have what your husband has it says your desire shall be to your husband you will desire your husband's position you will desire your husband's role in god's prophecy god is prophesying of the rise of women's rights the rise of equality the rise of doing what uh foregoing her calling to bring for children looking down upon the labor and the pain and the difficulty of doing it saying i ain't want none of that let me be my own woman let me live free of that let me just accomplish and achieve and be and god is actually prophesying when he curses the woman saying you one day are going to desire to have the man's role to step into his office and to be what his is but the man has been called to be the head and it's a the bible is just identifying it in the very beginning and so some of the major goals for the independence of women or some of the major arguments for the equality of women are pushed back against the word and i'm not like all nervous saying that all of a sudden i'm going to come out and somebody's going to attack me they would agree with me those that believe in these things would say you are 100 percent what we are teaching women today and what we want them to understand is 100 percent a aggression and attack against the traditional roles that have been espoused by christianity they will not argue with that so i and i feel that i'm qualified to share this because when in my undergraduate degree i took women's political theory it's called women's political thought i took that class and i had the highest grade in the class i had an a plus and let me tell you there were some women in there that hated me and so i feel like i'm qualified to speak about some of these things but these goals are a push back against the word because i was a bible toten christian sitting in class and the teacher would say well you know in the bible it says this and everyone would go and look back at me like oh no oh no uh oh and we had some fun we had some fun in that class and i made an a she didn't like me the teacher didn't like me but she's very gracious she'd say i completely disagree with you you're very unfair to this feminist i think that you're putting her arguments in the wrong kind of light but well written well argued very good support a plus i don't know why i'm humble bragging about my a plus and women's political theory but got an a did i mention i got an a plus it was the highest grade in the class i i didn't mention that did i so i i have authority to say that even when it was taught to me feminism was taught to me it was espoused verbalized and it was explicit that this is an argument against what you're taught in the bible and some of the common goals of feminism are to define establish and achieve political economic personal and social equality of sexes so this is some of their goals or common goals to define establish and achieve freedom independence political economic personal and social equality of sexes this includes seeking an established educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those of men now don't get me wrong and not that i ever said this to my teacher to get an a but okay that seems fair that seems reasonable but there's something missing here that the whole approach that in order to achieve this for a woman to be able to achieve political economic personal and social equality and then to also have you know be able to establish it through educational professional opportunities for women that are equal to those of men if you look at the agenda the common goals and the arguments they take motherhood out of womanhood i mean this is true if you if you ponder it and you realize that one of the greatest barriers to achieving this agenda is the fact that the woman can bring four children because the man doesn't so he can father a child and guess what he can do he can work without stopping it's like nancy we've got a meeting that too just hold on i'm almost done delivering the baby i'll be there at 2 15. it doesn't work that way so in order to achieve this there has to be and my goodness it really opens up to the door to why there isn't there is a imbalance in certain things it's because the women choose on their own many times they desire to be mothers and are willing to be paid less or work less or not ascend up a corporate ladder because they themselves desire or value the role that they would feel as a mother but these arguments about the equality of sexes within a politics or economics and these different things they leave motherhood out of womenhood so the ultimate barrier to this goal is not misogyny the ultimate barrier to achieving this is biology ponder it think about it the biggest hindrance to the uh to women to the feminist agenda is a woman's essential calling that an or if she if every woman if women are ever going to achieve this she needs to stop having babies and in romans chapter 1 verses 26 to 28 for this cause gave them up unto god gave them up onto vile affections for even their women did and i realized time is like super getting away from me let me just try to go through this very quickly god as he's running through all these things that have happened to man and how perverted he's become he says even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature now i'm just wanting you to ponder this without getting into what's being um identified as evil and wrong and how the perversion crept in he's saying that the women uh changed natural use into something against nature likewise also men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly receiving in themselves the recompense of their heir which was meat and even as they did not like to now this is kind of where it all went wrong they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do things which are not convenient so convenience speaks of something that is proper right something being accomplished that it's not this does not accomplish what a woman has accomplished uh made for this does not accomplish what a man this is for and those things so they comment they enter into reprobate mind to do things that are not fulfilling that are not convenient do not accomplish the right things and it's all built upon this this failure to fulfill the natural use what is looking at what would be this natural use what was she naturally called to do now without getting into some of the arguments that are made about these scriptures a woman was made to mother a woman was made to bring forth children but in this very this picture saying man has kind of abandoned that and left that aside and he's given up the natural use of a woman and she's changed the natural use into that which is against nature and the woman what she's called to do is not regarded at all this is going to be something this is something to chew on and i i'm running out of time to really expound upon it so this is maybe one of those times when it's maybe a little fun to say something everybody's like what and they just have to think about it but the comment there's a common ground that's shared between those who degrade women and those that want to liberate women there's a common ground they have a commonality which they maybe don't look at very um maybe immediately but those that would degrade women and sexualize them and objectify them and those that want to liberate women they both have this common ground and this they disregard the disregard and respect for a woman's calling both of them are are locked arms together and operating by the same principle that they do not respect and value what a woman is for they say what a woman is for like she just has some use no god has created her for glory created her for something great and a man will just use her and objectify her and degrade her and devalue her and then on the other side well we would value women we want to liberate them and what they want to liberate her from is her ovaries and they want to liberate a woman from her calling and to be a wife and to be a mother and that's where they have their common ground but if we just leave aside a person's right over their body because i think sometimes we have to be very careful how adamant we get about certain things and something could be wrong but you have to be very careful that you're not acknowledging that you know what when it comes to law and it comes to reason and it comes to choice you have that choice so we're not going to get into the arguments about a person's right or their body or choice because we are made what free moral agents without getting into that consider what what i've just said what am i identifying what a woman's virtue is so it's not an argument about her choice it's not an argument about your choice it's not an argument about uh birth control rights and a right over a woman's body it's a it's an it's an argument that's revolving around what is a woman made for and the shifting attitude towards motherhood and the change in the attitude towards womanhood is a product of a lost connection with christ these attitudes that have changed have changed because we're no longer viewing one another through what god would want us to be we're no longer viewing marriages and families and churches we're no longer viewing them through what the word said they should be but they become something totally different that's defined socially that's defined subjectively by individuals and we kind of want everyone to have this autonomous definition of who they are and the reason why we have such polarizing differences is because we have lost our connection with the word which would give us common ground to both respect and value and liberate women the proper way and really i'd say this there's no there's no promise of joy in the world view only the pursuit of pleasure and in pursuing pleasure the outcome of disappointment because god made a woman a certain way and you may liberate her by somehow breaking the shackles of the patriarchy by somehow overthrowing misogyny by somehow putting every chauvinist six feet under and somehow you've liberated the woman and you've made her free and she no longer has to worry about man and every man has been subjugated and conquered and cast into prison and the woman is finally free and shall find that though there may be pleasure they'll never be fulfillment again i'm speaking in general about the woman and if we look at the time that we're living in now laodicea tries to smother out the glory of a woman's purpose tries to smother out the glory of a woman's true calling the word laodicea in the greek means justice of the people the city was named historically after laodicea shrewd and powerful woman who divorced her husband and accumulated much wealth through that divorce and it's in this age that's named after this woman this powerful woman it's an age that has become a woman's age the image of the woman has changed and since the image of a woman has changed the ambition of women has changed why because they pursue the image i think about this i'm not i'm not just trying to diagnose like someone we can leave today and you go to in and out this evening like look at that laodicean look at that laodicean i'm wanting you to ponder the impact it has on your mind your thinking and on your heart how there's an image out there of the woman and what she's doing and what she's accomplishing and what she's able to do and what she's able to achieve and this image of a woman and we're presented with multiple images so you can almost choose your flavor well i want to be like this instagram woman i want to follow this woman on youtube and whatever image it might be there's an image of the woman that's being presented to you and since this image is presented it influences your pursuit it influences your desire and let's just be honest the woman's role is not being defined now by a godly society it is not being influenced by biblical teachings in the world you're not going to find the model of a biblical woman being presented to you that this is what you should follow this is how you should live the world is not lifting those things up the world is not allowing an avenue for those things to be supported that's not the image you're going to be beholding but a biblical woman a woman who would desire and even say well i just want to be a housewife i just want to be a stay-at-home mom and these phrases that are used i mean you would have these women that just clutched their pearls like you would what you just want to be a i can't even say it you just want to get married and that's how they feel and and what is amazing is that a woman who gets married and has children is now telling her daughter why would you get married some kind of logical disconnect there but a woman who would desire that is made to feel less honored a woman that would desire is made to feel less valued she she feels has less fulfillment in home and in marriage because the result of the image that's being presented now i'm speaking this to our sisters now and even to us brothers and all of us as the family of god to consider this that there's enough of an image that's being presented in the world to make a woman feel less valued and less fulfilled in her role in the home outside of the difficulties that may take place in the home there's a pressure and attack that tells her she hasn't accomplished as much she's not as valued as much she's not as special as she could be if she was doing more than just married and raising her kids and so with that there's a sense of shame or even maybe this idea of broken dreams and expectations unfulfilled and man i was really good at this and i was great at that and if i hadn't gotten married and had kids and i would have had this business and i'd be making a lot of money and i would have franchised this and there's a lot of ways come on sisters get behind me now there's a lot of ways we have gifts and talents and abilities and blessings and opportunities i had a full ride scholarship for this i had an opportunity to do that and then you find yourself the lord maybe a circumstance maybe god you know intervenes in your life and you think it was a tragedy but it was god saying wait a minute stop her before she does that something changes you find yourself today you're married and you have children you're a stay-at-home mom you're homeschooling and your life is full of laundry and and matthew c and all sorts of curriculums you're trying to figure out and all these things are taking place right this is your life and there's a voice that says you know if you just stuck it out with that education and then there's a way that it gets married with this idea well if you would have done that you would have been able to afford private school and so you would and you could just work from home you could you could just put an office on the back of this as a matter of fact you would have been making so much money you would have built a better house than what your husband built like man you're right i could have had a better house could have had an office i could have done all my stuff over here could have paid a tutor to come to my children could have put them in private school and so it's like you're not wrestling with it in the sense that wow oh i would be a single woman living it up as the ceo of apple right now had i not gotten married there's a way that you're just made to feel that something's missing just because you're a wife and a mother now in psalms 113 verse 9 i was going to read the entire psalm not the book of psalm the entire psalm 113 as my text because it just lifts up a lot of beautiful things in the beginning and i felt for time i wanted to focus on john 16. but notice how it says this in verse 9 he maketh the barren woman to keep house and even the language that's used in the hebrew he make it the woman to fill the house up with children this is what makes her a keeper at home as the children that have birthed them to the home and this is the prophecy this is a promise to a woman he makes a woman who is unable to have children to become a woman who keeps house to has children and to be a joyful mother of children praise ye the lord so this is a cause for praise this is the cause for exaltation and i want you to catch this because it's important to understand that this is not being said only to the woman who was barren so it's not only that the baron would have children but it points to what makes a woman joyful that when a barren woman is able to have children she becomes a joyful mother as other women have become and this is how the bible describes motherhood it doesn't say and she becomes this chore this bondage this burden of a mother well he gave the barren woman what she asked for handcuffed her for 18 years chained a ball and chained to her ankle and she had to drag around these kids for 18 years before her and her husband finally go on that vacation to europe once they get the kids out of the house no it says that she may be a joyful mother of children though it's becoming a mother is a joy it's not a chore it's not a bondage it's not restriction it's not a cause for lamentation it was a cause of praise and exaltation not only that a woman who could not conceive would conceive but when any woman does that in its purest way having children is a joy and causes her to be a joyful mother of children the by this scripture is saying that god created the woman to cause the house to be full as leah and rachel built up israel and brought forth children it's referring how the woman is used to build up the family and to cause a house to be full he causes the woman to keep house this is god's purpose god made the woman to be not just a mom or to mother but rather to be a joyful mother of her children what is a joyful mother is a mother who's pursuing purpose it is a mother who's finding meaning and doing what she is called to do it she's a joyful mother because she realized that being a mother is part of god's plan she's a joyful mother because she realizes there's meaning in being a mom and what other greater joy could she have what other greater calling could she have not because she missed out on this opportunity not because she could do this and do that if we had more money then we could do this and we could do that no it's an idea that no matter how hard and difficult the circumstance is this is a calling of god to be a mother just in being the mom she's to be joyful the joyful mom is the one that finds that there's meaning in this there's purpose in this and this is what makes john chapter 16 stand out to me so much more verses 20 and 21 verily verily i say unto you that you shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and you shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy so jesus wanting the disciples to understand that as his as he is going to be crucified soon and he is and they're going to be very sad as a result of that he's wanting them to know that this great sorrow and this dread that they feel can be changed into joy and catch this as we continue to read jesus is using childbirth as a type to understand their impending sorrow but the imminent joy their sorrow but ultimately there's joy and and so this is what he's wanting to use your sorrow should be turned to joy and then he uses this example a woman when she is in travail have sorrow she's giving birth she has pains and it's it's hard because her hours come but as soon as she's delivered of the child she remembers no more the anguish this is in the days before epidurals and c-sections right she doesn't remember the pain she remembered no more the anguish for joy that a child that a man it doesn't speak just of a man for the joy that a man is born into the world think about that i know there's sisters here that can relate to this that how horrible and hard a pregnancy can be and a labor can be that then when that child as soon as that child is born it's almost as if those nine months ago gone and it's so remarkable that you find that a woman who just almost lost her life in delivery had the worst nine months of her life is like oh i want to have another one like do you remember what those months were like i still haven't lost the weight you want another one why for the joy that a child was born it's a joy that eclipses the pain it's a joy that eclipses the suffering it's a joy that eclipses all those things and this is in the beauty of marriage and this is connected with the beauty of a woman fulfilling her purpose this is the way that it ought to be this is the joy of childbirth this is the joy of having children in the in a marriage which is sanctified before the lord she remembered no more the anguish for joy that a man has brought in the world the pain the anguish and the suffering of labor is immediately overshadowed of the joy of the delivery now the bible says that she praise god that a mother become a woman becomes a joyful mother and jesus is using this travail and sorrow that then becomes eclipsed because the woman is still the body's still in trauma the body has still suffered there's still a recovery for this woman there's still changes that are going to take place there's still something that this woman physically is going to overcome there's still a suffering and a consequence from what has happened to the body but the fact that the child is here exceeds all that so the pain the delivery the pregnancy it's not keep getting brought up keeps getting brought up you're looking at this baby and say yeah you're cute but my goodness those nine months i don't know i don't know if it was worth it no it was all worth it once you're holding that baby it's all worth it you even take mothers who have children born prematurely and they have to be in nicu for months and months and months and they can only visit and see them through a glass and after seven or so months they finally get that baby and they're bringing that little baby home yes it was it worth it they'd say oh it's worth it worth every second worth every dollar worth every effort oh no it was worth it why because this is the principle that god put within the woman a power that he put within the woman and jesus is actually using that probably because what else could he use right to describe what it was going to be like for the disciples to see christ die but the joy that they would feel upon his resurrection the revelation of it like how else can we describe it except childbirth how else can i describe to you and and what's funny is he's telling this to men and then like hmm yeah i mean she did scream a lot if that's got to be hard yeah that's got to be hard and the women are there going are you serious this is what it's going to be like this is awesome he says she remembers nowhere the anguish christ has to use this example of the joy that a mother experiences to help the disciples begin to understand the joy they'll fear feel after the sorrow of his crucifixion but the revelation of his resurrection and this is the point where i really want to drive home to our mothers happy mother's day this is not a fleeting joy but it becomes an occasion for a woman to occupy herself in god's purpose it's not just a joy that oh a baby is born it's a newborn this is great i had a baby but now the woman steps into an office and she's given an opportunity to occupy herself from that moment that the baby takes that breath she knows that now for the rest of her life she can occupy herself in god's purpose because listen when we begin to speak about family behind this pulpit and to you as a church and some of you who have grandchildren and you're enjoying great grandchildren it's easy to say oh well brother aaron's preaching about you know raising children hey you haven't left being a parent there's still a role that you play there's still an influence you have there's still things that we can learn and benefit from and even some tremendous paths upon the back saying attaboy you did a good job when we tune into the things that are taught in the word of god concerning parenthood but this is not just something where she has oh that was great that was wonderful i'm happy and then begins to enter into this despondency this chore of raising children to maturity but now she's entered into an office motherhood as in in the office of a mother she has been given an opportunity every day even once the children are married and gone every day she can enter into that office and occupy herself as a prayerful mother for the sake of her children job offered sacrifices for his children that weren't at home and it's not just a fleeting joy because verse 22 says and ye now therefore have sorrow as a woman does when she's in labor but i will see you again upon the resurrection and your heart shall rejoice so a woman who's in travail is like how you're going to feel once i'm crucified but when you catch the revelation and see me in the resurrection you're going to be happy like a woman when she has a baby and then he says and your joy no man taketh from you and lord this is a an abiding joy this is more than a moment this is more than emotion and i want to catch this this was what there was a real force behind my inspiration is to make this point that the world tries to steal that joy from a woman because but with god has made you a mother i don't care how dark it is how hard it is what it looks like god has promised a joy that should not be stolen to mothers your joy no man taketh from you in other words jesus is saying just as a mother's joy should never be stolen your joy will never be taken away just as sir as a woman as soon as she becomes a mother she enters into relationships she's never known before she enters into emotions and feelings she's never known before she enters into a joy she becomes a joyful mother and that joy cannot be taken from her he's using that so a christian can understand what the resurrection is like and let me say this to our mothers don't let anybody steal your joy do not let the joy of motherhood be taken away from you by the perverting of the picture of what a woman should be do not let the joy of motherhood be taken away from you by the fear of missing out do not let the joy of motherhood be taken away from you by comparison and you look out and you see this you see that in the world is trying to steal the joy of motherhood away from a woman and the bible says in proverbs 31 30 which lifts up this virtuous woman and her price is far above ruby's and how has she described a woman who has busied herself with their family a woman who's busied herself with her children a woman who's busy herself with her husband and it says this favor is deceitful and beauty is vain what does that speak to the elements that try to rob a woman for over happiness beauty is deceitful or vain and favors deceitful favor applause accomplishments popularity it's deceitful beauty of same but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised the bible says who can value a virtuous woman a virtuous woman is a woman who pursues virtuous things and because she's pursuing virtuous things because she's pursuing the right things the outcome is joy she doesn't pursue joy if she pursue joy then the deceitful favor is what she would try to have if she's pursuing joy then the vanity of beauty is what she would try to have come on think about it this is exactly what the scripture we could use the scripture to make the point that if all you wanted was to be happy then try to find favor if all you want to do be is happy then try to become more view beautiful but there's vanity and deceit in those things but in pursuing virtue and purpose there's joy that comes with it favor and beauty try to lure a woman into selfishness where it's about her and about her rights and what she can do and how she looks and what she can accomplish and i've never been able to do this and i've never been able to do that and i've never been able to do this and her desire shall be to her husband you get to go on this and you get to go do that and you've been able to do this her desire shall be to her husband she begins to want to do and accomplish and feel a sense of accomplishment that that the man has when in reality the man could look at you and say just is whatever you can say about me i could say about you don't ever compare your job to her job you don't want it right he said well i have to leave every day and i'll work 12 hours and i'm doing this time to do that all you do is stay at home you don't want it you don't want it and sisters you don't want it either the 12 hour shift you don't want him you're not called to him but this deceit lures a woman into selfishness to want to achieve something for her her happiness and and her pleasure but if you read proverbs 31 a virtuous woman is defined by her service to others do you mind if i go a little bit longer do you mind okay i was i was wanting to catch just somebody's eye who's saying go ahead and that's i was only asking sister hannah and she said continue so apologize i was looking at my kids and my family hoping they'd give me a thumbs up but is that yes or no you don't want me to continue okay okay yes okay no what i already got my goal there's a book entitled don't write it down just forget it as soon as i say it the feminine mystique i think is the name of it there was a book written i think it was in 1963 and it was done and i think the study was largely based upon this woman surveying her high school uh friends they graduated in the 15th anniversary i think it was graduation in 1949 so i think that's very interesting dates so these women have graduated from high school in 1949 she had surveyed all these women now in the late 50s and as a result of this survey she wrote a book challenging the belief that a woman's fulfillment could only come as a housewife and a mother so the whole point was this feminine mystique is challenging this notion that a woman can that a woman is connect her fulfillment does not come alone from being a housewife and a mother and this let me just read this to you sister hannah let me read this to you the problem laid buried unspoken for many years in the minds of american women it was a strange stirring a sense of dissatisfaction a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the 20th century in the united states each suburban wife struggled with it alone as she made the bed shop for groceries matched slipcover material ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children chauffeured cub scouts and brownies lay beside her husband at night she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question is this all think about it it's framing the woman's existence in her life that this is the unsettledness this is the dissatisfaction this is what really this yearning deep within the women who are suffering in america is that they lay next to their husbands after living all day for their children and they want to ask the question but they're afraid to even ask their question of themselves is this life is this all is this what i was made to be is this all i'm gonna accomplish and it says we can no longer ignore this is what she writes we can no longer ignore that voice within women that says i want something more than my husband and my children in my home we can no longer ignore this is right at the time the seals are being opened this book is published we can no longer ignore the voice that says within women i want something more i want something more than a husband i want something more than children i want some more than a home we should be the pearl clutchers now what you would want something more than that and think about the condition this world is in now 60 years later to where now we that sounds reasonable that sounds plausible and if someone was to suggest well what more could you have as a woman than to be a wife and a mother and say well that's just oppression that's oppressive that's that's demeaning that that takes away the value of a woman and let me say this their argument is valid because something had become broken a value system had been broken the family in the home had lost its place it lost its purpose and how can a woman who's called to be a virtuous wife who's called to be a joyful mother of her family how could she experience that when the man and the family itself is no longer being centered around god's word she is experiencing now how it feels to be displaced and instead of her saying why do i feel so dissatisfied in examining what god's purpose would be for the woman she realizes how man is flowed into this abyss of of misogyny and power in greed and capitalism and she has a sense of missing out because she doesn't fit in with in that vision anymore my goodness i'm biting off a mouthful and she says we need a drastic reshaping of the cultural image of femininity that will permit women to reach maturity identity completeness of self without conflict with sexual fulfillment and i'm going to say amen because what had happened to the cultural image of the woman by that time it had already been broken it's not like it's little house on the prairie and now a woman's wanting to go to college no this had left that it had been torn down it had been torn down to the point where now the woman is experiencing this sense of this all this doesn't satisfy why because she wasn't just made to be at home and be a woman who's making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches she was made to be a co-laborer with the man to fill purpose to fill meaning to fulfillment you take christ out of it she's not going to have it the shift cause of this the shift away from godly principles the shift away of a man being the man that he ought to be the shift away from church being what it ought to be the change from the family the bible being in the family and christ being in the home the shift away from that the unsettledness went through the entire family where the husband had to be off doing this and off in that club and off doing that and the children had to go get their hot rods and be in this and being that and the woman was left where's my part where's my joy where's my pleasure why did that happen because christ left the home can we invert can we invert always invert if that attitude existed because christ left the home christ is in your home he's not gone so then the lack of joy the lack of enthusiasm the lack of fulfillment is within your grasp you just have to take your eyes off of the worldly principle that somehow suggests to you that you're living far below your potential or your privileges and say no that once i have the word as the my centerpiece once i've come to this i know that as a wife and a mother no matter how hard those offices may be and regardless if i'm successful in them i am doing what i'm called to do it's your purpose but this selfish kind of love the bible says in second timothy chapter 3 that in the last days perilous times will come it says men will be lovers of their own selves what happens when a woman is laying there in bed and says this is all or is this all and women are saying there must be a change in the cultural image of femininity that'll permit a woman to be live a fulfilling life i want something more than my husband my children my home why is she feeling that way because men become lovers of the own selves and whether you want to say she caused it or she's the product of it she's laying there questioning what she's doing because she loves herself she's laying there questioning what she's doing because she hasn't been loved herself the selfishness and greed feeds the weaknesses of humanity and it broke marriage and it broke parenthood amen it's exactly what happened why because joy is connected with purpose but that purpose cannot be rooted in self-gratification that purpose cannot be rooted in success of on your own terms that i'm pursuing success and i'm pursuing happiness joy is connected with purpose but that purpose is not rooted in self uh satisfaction or self success happiness gained through selfish pleasure cannot produce joy happiness gained through selfish activity happiness gained through things that are only meant for you will not produce the fulfillment and enjoy now i'm not saying that if somehow everyone else can't benefit by it you shouldn't do it but you should be aware that when your recreation brings you happiness and your recreation relaxes you and your hobbies and the things that you get to do bring you great satisfaction realize that those accomplishments will not bring joy or fulfillment because it's not connected with purpose i i know i've been long it's 5 50 and and i've been an hour and 20 minutes already and i realized that and if i'm doing myself a disservice by telling you how long you've been sitting here i apologize to myself but i have to finish this because it's just a few more just a few more moments here moments are not clearly defined how long they are but there's a few more of them and i have to share this because this is what to me was just what sealed the deal for me last week when i was looking at this how can you how do we describe the love of god as that song goes how do you explain how do you describe love that goes from east to west it runs as deep as it is and you know how you would strike start to try to describe it you'd say well it's like a mother loves her son that's where you would start you wouldn't start about a boy and his dog you wouldn't start with a man in his hobbies you wouldn't start with a horse trainer and his horses you wouldn't start about with a woman in her job a professor and his students what would you start with if you wanted to begin to understand instead of saying well it's like god so loved the world well what does that mean that god so loved you're trying to should take share with somebody the love of god you would begin with well you know how a mother cares for a child and then okay all right now imagine that and once you begin to understand that just multiply it to infinity and that's where you can begin to convey it why because a mother's love is like god's love what i was studying last week is the mystery of motherhood and how that god manifested himself in fatherhood and he get manifest himself in sonship and she had god the father god the son and god the holy ghost where is the mystery of motherhood where is it that he expresses himself in that attribute where is it that he conveys that and expresses that and you see the mystery of it come down through the entire bible and you'll have the perfection of it in this end time that we're living and let me say mothers you are called to reveal the mystery of motherhood a mother's love is like god's love strong unselfish it's fierce it's fearless that's what will cause a mother deer to stand up in the way of a hunter if she thinks her baby's in trouble so to cause a mother to run into flames of fire to rescue her child what compels a mother to do that it's the mother's love it's boundless it's brave in isaiah chapter 66 verse 13. i haven't just made this up that if you're going to begin to compare to get someone to understand the love of god you would start with the mother's love so guess what god does when he wants you to understand his commitment to you he can only point to the commitment of a mother for you to begin to understand it as one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you and you shall be comforted in jerusalem i want you to know just how much i'm going to comfort you and in order for you to understand just how much i'm going to comfort you think about how your mother comforted you and god has to use the mother as a model of his love why because the love of a mother is like god's love and this is why a mother who perverts her expression of love a mother who abandons her love to her children abandons her duty to her children a mother who forsakes this cause and care and concern over children for some other love and some other pursuit some other pride that is why it is so destructive to a child and that's why it just shocks and it's like there's this shadow that just reverberates within a child who's been rejected by their mother and it stays in there their whole life and where it does its most damage is when they want to start to love god and they're told he'll love you like your mom and they think i sure hope not think about it something is born in the woman when she gives birth to a child i think one person said at one time a woman is born again when she gives birth it releases a deep strength even in labor they've concluded that the pains that they experience and the the trauma that a woman's body goes through and then they come out of it and then you see the pictures and they're just like they're glowing and yeah it was a 72 hour labor and no medicine nothing yeah it's all natural and it's like she's glowing but it doesn't even make sense you just think that well their body goes to getting hit by a truck what is it it's their strength that's relief and released in the woman a power a strength that comes abraham lincoln says i remember my mother's prayers and they have always followed me they've clung to me all my life one of the greatest presidents this country has ever known abraham lincoln says the prayers of my mom have clung to me my entire life what was it that was there clinging to him in the days of the civil war as he formed policy what was there clinging to him when he looked to god for guidance and faith the prayers of a mother you the mothers are called the fifth gospel there's a law of the mother that the bible refers to there's running out of time just to express all these things oliver wendell holmes he was a supreme court justice he says youth fades love drops the leaves of friendships fall amen youth fades love troops the leaves of friendship fall a mother's secret hope outlives them all oh there's so much power in that that's why you pined for it that's why you longed for what you wanted to know what your mother's hope was for you that's why it caused so much pain and travail when it's not communicating when it's not received but i instead of maybe going down that path though i sense maybe you're hurt in some of your hearts without going down that path think about what you have today as a mother an opportunity to get it right an opportunity to express it as it wasn't expressed to you an opportunity to know that youth fades and love droops and the leaves of friendship fall we've seen it happen in our lives but a mother's secret hope outlives them all the hope of a mother though it may be a mystery it stays with that child forever even to where the greatest president in the united states here she would stand there and say the prayers of my dead mother still cover me today this is a love and a hope that is not an engine to pride it's not a motivation to emotion or ambition but this is a love that is a motivation to the soul of her child to her child jesus says greater love hath no man than this that he lay down his life that a man lay down his life for his friends the greatest love is the sacrificial love if the greatest love is that christ would actually give his life think about the great love that is expressed when a mother says yes there's opportunities yes i could do that yes i'm a freeman agent yes i could get an education yes i'm very good at this yes i'm very good at that but i choose this there's not a greater love so there's a greater love and then it says in 3rd john 1 2-4 beloved i wish you above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health this would be the love of a mother this would be a desire of a parent even as my soul prospereth for i rejoice greatly when the brethren came and testified to the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth and you're familiar with this statement i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth this is not a selfish kind of love this is not a love that's a point of pride you better do this and you better do that and succeed in this and do this and honor this and honor that and this all these different things but a desire there's no greater joy than to hear that your child is walking in truth if you can't rejoice that your child is walking in truth something's wrong somewhere i have no greater joy it's joined with the no greater love why because this love i'm talking about the love of a mother is not selfish because it's not selfish it's pursuing the right things and because it's pursuing the right things that's where a mother finds joy it's only when we let the devil take our eyes off that to oh what could be what could have been and we look at the wrong image the image that was broken the image that even the cultural image of the woman was so broken that even the women were complaining about it they just had the wrong solution i have four more scriptures actually six but i don't think i'm gonna use them all four more scriptures written down here let me just use this one to kind of bring it to this run home isaiah 49 15. now this is heavy can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not even have she should not have compassion on the son of her womb now it's meant to be in a sense a rhetorical question that as i desire you it's the same way that a mother desires a child and as a woman would always be mindful of her son that she uh breastfed that she would always have this compassion and love for him and she would not forget him and cast him off and and and wish ill upon him he's bringing this thought again when god wants you to understand how much he loves you he doesn't talk about daddy he talks about mom but then he says this yea they may forget yet will i not forget thee yea they may forget mothers don't forget if you have remember do not let the enemy steal your joy of motherhood do not be deceived by beauty and favor this line the illusion of the world that somehow you're missing out somehow you're being devalued somehow you're you're losing the power that you could have as a woman i say don't forget the world has devalued true womanhood the world today would try to define womanhood without motherhood but the miss just give me the signal if i need to grab a mic am i good how about the mic though okay the world has devalued womanhood they've taken motherhood right out of it now you that are sitting here today as mothers you think well i haven't really haven't really thought about it but you felt the pressure of it why because the image no longer is that a woman is called to be a wife and a mother it's a woman can be whatever she wants to be and the reason why it is devalued is because there's so much strength in it proverbs 31 25 strength and honor are her clothing don't let the world strip you of your clothing strength and armor honor are what clothe you strength and honor what keep you strength and honor or part of your clothing and being a virtuous woman as we said in the beginning i'd like to bring it back to this in closing joy is connected with purpose that we don't all sit here today and we think oh what will make me happy and then we strive to become happy we need to find meaning we need to find purpose and if it's problematic and how we're going to fulfill that purpose we can invert and ask ourselves what's going to keep me from it to narrow down our choices in life to narrow down our field to begin to understand better what's going to really produce joy as an outcome in the end and what victor frankl recognizes this strong desire within man to find meaning man's search for meaning he realized that in the concentration camps it was those who had purpose that survived and they were all enduring the same thing sharing some of the same genetic characteristics the same upbringing the same past the same families they all couldn't you couldn't differentiate you could control for all these other variables and come down to it and he sat there's a very educated and sharp man he could say listen i found in the end it was those who had a sense of purpose that could endure the concentration camp none of us are living in a concentration camp kids i don't care how bad you teenagers have it at home none of you have a concentration camp but there was something within those who had purpose that despite the deterioration of their body and the deplorable conditions and people dying just from fear and starvation and people dying from just the anxiety of a gas chamber there are those who lived and he said those who lived had purpose and had meaning and he came to this conclusion those that have a why to live can bear with almost any how hallelujah let me give brother victor and amen those who have a why to live can bear with almost anyhow listen don't worry with the about the what don't worry about the how it doesn't matter today how bad your home life is doesn't matter how bad your marriage is it doesn't matter how all those things are and stay with me it doesn't matter how if ultimately you understand the why give me a why to live and i don't even need to know why this is happening because i've got a purpose and i know that god would not offer anything that would keep me from it give me a why a why to marriage a wider raising children why why why once you know the why you can bear with almost anyhow it is in the meaning of motherhood that matters it is in the purpose of motherhood that matters not the how in other words when i say the false measures do you realize that even this i'd say this and i was pondering this yesterday and this is what brought me this is what when i read these things i came to this conclusion i thought well lord if i should share it please bring it to my my mind so often we try to measure our success in what makes a good mom what makes a good wife what makes it you can get so sidetracked by pursuing success you'll never find it that way you find it by just doing what you know you're supposed to do and regardless of the results in marriage and with your children if you've done what you're supposed to do there's fulfillment maybe someone said well i regret the way i raise my children i regret this i regret that then you you ask for forgiveness and you go forward and you know that even with our regrets god has a way of taking those and using them for his glory let's not have false measures and false metrics and what makes a successful wife what makes a successful mother but just know that if i am one then there's a purpose in it and i want to serve my purpose because that's where redemption is musicians if you'd come i'm glad in services like this that none of our musicians are mothers so that the mothers could just ponder these things as we close as i pondered that woman laying there in bed and afraid to even ask herself the silent question is this all i realize that as men we have to take our responsibility for causing the question because there there's there's enough there's enough blame right where everyone has their share in it but i believe that as husbands can take ownership of our charge and we acknowledge that as a daughter of god if there is some sense in your heart of a lack of satisfaction a lack of fulfillment that it wouldn't be a matter of us wagging our finger in your face and saying well you just don't see any purpose and meaning in marriage or purpose and meaning in raising children but we could acknowledge that that has no meaning without us and we could take ownership of the charge that god has given us to encourage to provide and to give a place for joy because i believe that's our responsibility it says in proverbs 31 verse 28 her children arise up and call her blessed which is happy joyful her husband also calls her blessed and he praiseth her this is something that we as children something that we can do as husbands we could take our responsibility and not just castigate the wife who's laying there in bed saying is this is all but realize maybe there's times when a woman feels that way because what's been provided isn't convenient for her joy and that's to be an avenue for it we can join together in this purpose of pure joy it says in proverbs 31 31 give her this virtuous woman this wife this mother give her the fruit of her hands in other words ponder this this is your reward don't take this the wrong way you want the pat on the back you want the accolades you want the recognition you want you want things to uh to be honored you want to somehow win look i won mother of the year i didn't even know if i had a contest i we want that but the bible says just let her enjoy the fruits of her labor that's your reward and this and let her own works this is beautiful let her own works praise her in the gates the man gets praised in the gates he needs to hear it in the gates he hears it from the children hears it from the family he hears it from everybody a man gets the lord and the accolades of the palace good job oh you're doing really good the man gets all the attention and the woman is just there silently at home serving and laboring and doing everything she can and the bible says she may not get all the praise and adoration and glory so let her own works be her praise therefore you can do it as unto the lord knowing from whom your reward comes if i don't need man to pat me on the back i don't need this i don't need that i don't need this i just need to do what's pleasing to the lord and know and know that i'm in his calling that in no way absolves us as men from doing our part but i say that to encourage our mothers today that your labor is your reward there's reward in your labor there's fruit in your labor and your works in your purpose will be your praise you want to know how to be happy you want to know how to find joy it will be in living a meaningful life and i say don't forget daughters of god [Music] don't forget the calling you have as a mother don't let the world steal you of your joy as a mother could you accept that today could we do this if you are a child a spouse and you're next to your mom your mom's within reach could we just bow our heads could you put your hands lay your hands on your mom or the mother there's a you need to move to a husband can do it for the wife and you could pray for them this mother [Music] why is motherhood attacked why is the woman attacked she's carrying a mystery let's bow our heads in prayer just pray now for the wife or the mother and pray an honest prayer that god would strengthen her and encourage her [Music] our heavenly father thank you for allowing us to have a mother's day service thank you for allowing us to do it in the afternoon there could be an intimacy and personal touch [Music] thank you for our wives and for our mothers of our children and we as children we thank you for our mothers lord we're in awe of how when you wanted to express to israel your love for them you used a mother's love as an example [Music] and i believe it's encouraging in the scripture that you say they may forget because i know that there's mothers here today that as a result of circumstances whether it be a broken marriage or wayward children or even just current difficulties within the home it's easy to lose the joy of motherhood and to lose the real happiness and enthusiasm and inspiration but i remember just writing down last week mothers don't lose your inspiration and how the love of that mother deer inspired a man bert called to give his heart to the lord how the prayers of abraham lincoln's mother covered him years later how a mother's secret hope outlast them all i thought lord don't let our mothers lose their inspiration don't let our wives lose their inspiration by some kind of false image a lie of the devil an illusion and lord i it struck me in such a way to realize that the word places it with such there's such beauty and power in just the office that even a woman married to an awful nasty husband can still serve you and do that which is pleasing in your sight even a woman whose children are backslid and wayward can still find that there was purpose and is purpose in being a mother still yet and that the joy the joy of a mother was not contingent upon the success of the marriage it was not contingent upon the success of the children but rather it was contingent upon whether she fulfills her duty as a mother father that's what i pray for our mothers is that you would give them strength to occupy their calling that you would give them energy and enthusiasm and ambition not to achieve success but to live a meaningful life to fulfill their purpose they are called lord to be mothers we are nothing without them and we pray tonight that you would bless them that you would strengthen them that you would encourage them for the offenses and the faults and the hurts on our part god we pray that you would heal that you would do what only you could do father and take wounds and scars and deep hurts and cover them over with the balm that would deeply heal him and lord may it not be done in such a way that we would feel justified and absolved but lord may it be done to first begin and to promote the healing to the breach that is in their emotions and their spirits that are related to the marriage into the relationship with children that lord if you could begin to heal those wounds and those scars then the relationship can begin to be repaired and healed and that's what we ask for lord not an opportunity to sweep under everything under the rug but an opportunity to begin to do things right and do things correctly and on this day this mother's day what our prayer is for our moms is pure joy we cannot promise them a life of ease we cannot promise them a lack of heartache we cannot promise them that there will be no disappointments or hardships or great loss and even broken hearts and shattered dreams lord we cannot answer what the how is but lord if they can know the why if they can have meaning lord [Music] then no matter how early monday comes that mama will get up and work with a sick body the hurt back with a headache she'll mother through pneumonia she'll mother through sickness and flu and she'll mother through coronavirus lord while everyone else is laid in bed what does that the love of god in a mom [Music] a love that is so beautiful that it's what touches your love lord [Music] and one day hands us off to you i pray lord you encourage our moms the ones that are at home bless them i pray we love you thank you for your presence with us tonight bless these moms we pray in jesus name amen
