TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as you could tell from this scripture slide that we're going to continue on the subject of the house of the Lord and I trust that there's some continuity to these different subjects that we've been covering and the way that we've approached them I was getting some feedback here recently Somebody went back and listen to kind of a subsection of services uh in this and they found just uh you know continuity and the the way that they work just in principles and themselves but I hope it's painting a picture we have some other subjects we're hoping to get to here soon but I want to wrap up what's been maybe I think it's a six parts on Liberty and in looking at Liberty been taking that scripture where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and kind of what led me there was the Simplicity that is in Christ and this Liberty is often misunderstood and so tonight we're preaching on patient Liberty and brother Scott told me he was really excited uh for the service that we're speaking on uh patient autonomy or patient Liberty and I was like I think you got the wrong patient uh and so uh but I appreciated the humor but we're preaching on patient Liberty and I felt to put this and I'm realizing now we don't have the proper fonting in our slideshow computer but I was usually I used our church logo and so that's not the right font and I feel like I should just start all over anybody got a song special I can go fix this real quick but in the uh our church logo Arizona Believers Church and then the whatever tag we want to use at the bottom it's I'm used I used a similar format to say patient Liberty because I'm hoping that that's what we can have as a church I wanted just to kind of identify this with us as a church in looking at this subject of patient Liberty I I'm going to be using a very specific theme that fits with the impatient Liberty and the imperfect Liberty that we've already examined and in uh it kind of the theme has it's related maybe to more a spiritual operation of gifts and maybe church services the way brother brandham addressed a lot of fanaticism and disorder in those ways I I want to continue in that line but I'm I'm using those things just as an example of impatience and the importance of patience and I think that we can apply these principles to everyday life especially in a time where it just seems to be it's easier to get Edge on edge where we can be a little bit edgy or uh maybe getting agitated impatient and one thing that keeps recurring to me in my mind as I've studied on these things this week is just how we can get emotionally worked up about things something happens and we become emotionally invested in and we get worked up somebody says something somebody does something and things are happening around us maybe real genuine offenses or uh boundary violations however you want to look at it and we get emotionally worked up and it's in those moments that we need to kind of tap into something very very important and that's just waiting on the Lord being at rest and trusting him in not pressing in not uh uh trying to address something and end doing it we're just confronting it and we're making it worse so I think there's just a lot lot of ways that this can apply and apply to your heart as an individual to our homes as families and to this church now I'm going to continue a little bit on impatient Liberty I want to say some things just to reset that and then as we go forward I will be covering uh some things that we administered on a couple weeks ago on impatient Liberty but I'll just weave it into tonight's subject but with this impatient Liberty I wanted to use this idea of a Restless desire for change or this Restless desire for excitement and it's kind of this Restless desire for change or excitement that leads into air leads into US acting out of order doing something that's not right with God's word we've looked at the Temptation in the garden the Temptation in the wilderness and we could look in general in our lives that when we are tempted uh Satan's Temptations are aimed at producing this restlessness this Restless longing this anxious desire that we feel that we need to act we need to do something and so it's kind of at the core of how Satan was deal with Jesus he was causing him to tempt God to act impatiently and take things sooner and out of order and even with the woman we saw that a Eve's impatience birthed an ill-tempered selfish emotional son uh and it was not the proper son saw the same thing with Sarah her impatience brought ishmail a wild man a one that caused conflict and persecution one that was very erasable but in Hebrews chap 6: 13 14 and 15 says for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiply and I'll multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise now we're we're deep into our subject tonight after he patiently endured he obtained the promise God swore by himself when he said that I Will Bless thee and I will multiply thee he could not swear swear by anyone greater so the promise was sure God swearing by it but it says after Abraham had patiently endured he obtained the promise this is if I can say this is the Simplicity in Christ just believe just rest just wait just trust him he swore by himself it's an unconditional Covenant nothing that we have to do except receive it and so Abraham as the father of our faith isn't the father of trying to make it happen and acting out of fear and and and taking the wife's Alternatives his his faith alone was to patiently endure and through that patient endurance he obtained the promise notice how at the core of Abraham receiving the promise was patience uh you may recall and I know all of you do with perfect recall the sermon we preached uh I think he was in the series on wonder lust and wonder loss on the death of patience and it made Brother Scott very fearful and I was like no it's a different kind of patient and so then the death of patience we looked at how that patient patience will lead us to the Fulfillment of the promise and how that patience is an essential attribute of God and therefore it's an essential attribute for his children but how that in the death of patients and the way things are designed in this day and age and the cycles of U the dopamine uh loops and those things we're always looking to be sensitized that we're we've been made to be constantly impatient and we're Restless to experience a thrill rest to experience and emotion and I would venture to say that many of us are unable to just sit on our couch for very long without wanting to reach for a device or reach for something to start that that that dopamine release and so we've become impatient to be impatient you're Restless under existence existing conditions like the way they are you want them to change you're not happy with just sitting there being bored and there's a uh you cannot bear any longer in your current state but what Abraham did is he patiently endured he was willing to as long as necessary remain in his believing that God made the promise no matter what that state would be he wanted just to remain in that state in order to receive the promise so this patient uh we're talking about patient Liberty tonight and and just looking again at this idea of how critical patience is in Revelations chap 13:1 I'm kind of skipping over you know burying the lead a little bit here and skipping over the real heaviness to this but it says he that leadth into captivity cap capity shall go into captivity he that kth with the sword must be killed with the sword there's a lot going on in Revelations 13 but then it says here is the patience and the faith of the Saints out looking at those two together it's saying the patience and the faith of the saints that faith is that we can say whether it be our ability to believe our capacity that gift to believe the things of God but then it's not just the faith but then the patience The Virtue to be able to endure unto it so faith is the evidence faith is a substance and we have it and the faith of the Saints is that the promise will be fulfilled and patience is what we have to see it happen so patience is very important in Hebrews chapter 6:12 he's writing that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises this patience has to do with government of our emotions uh keeping into check certain instincts and functions of the Flesh and desires and to where we want to be quick to satisfy our desire for something but he's saying we shouldn't be slothful but followers of those who faith and patience notice how that Faith must be joined with patience in order for the word to be fully expressed can have faith but it's got to be joined with patience in order for it to come to its fullness with faith can see it faith can feel it Faith Can Know It faith can be the substance and the evidence but for it to actually become materialized and the F promise fulfilled it requires patience so this idea of patience it's it's keeping in check emotions it's not just being L astray by our flesh and our excitement and our our need for certain things we're just willing to wait on the Lord Revelations 3:10 I believe we did use this a couple weeks ago because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth notice how key keeping his word of patience the word of his patience gives us power in the hour of Temptation so faith and patience will keep you in the hour of Temptation they say well I have faith to believe but if you don't have patience and there's a certain wearing down there there's a certain War of Attrition you're going to engage in and you may still have faith but your faith will only go so far there's a point at which you've got to completely anch yourself in his faith and so there's this battle in our minds this war of attrition that if we don't have faith together with patience if we don't have this virtue of patience that can come in this hour and keep the word of my patience he will keep us in the hour of Temptation if we don't have patience temptation is easier to yield to you remember temptation is at the heart of these several services on Liberty and the Temptation Of Christ and how that he was offered he was wanting him to do something extravagant and something Visual and something uh uh and Jesus even brother brand equated it to snake handling and drinking poison says Don't Tempt God so there's this temptation to tempt in the Philadelphian Church age chapter age of the church age book brother brandham writes to wait for the Fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham and this is commentary on Revelations 3:10 he endured and seing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word was finally fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people patience why why does he teach his patience if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but would become even more impatient with life anybody ever had a spoiled child or know we all know of a spoiled child I'm sure right we could just start naming off nieces and nephews and cousins uh but never our own but there's there's a what spoils them is when they get what they want immediately then they expect it immediately and if it doesn't come immediately they feel that something's wrong or you know the the the the Rhythm in life has been interrupted and things are going to be completely fall apart and God knows better than anybody the human nature and how we we're learning character and we're growing and how that he allows a certain rhythm of fulfillment of his word and even How He blesses us and then sometimes we don't feel like we're being blessed and it's all for the purpose of growing us into that mature character in love with Christ to where it's like he knows that we get him right to know him as he knows us he knows he can see in the way that we live the way that we act the way that we respond and that we are securing his love for us that we get him we know his promises we know they're true we know the how he works we understand if he's allowing something to happen we're like ah I really thought I wanted that but God must have something better right you you you realize that he's re recognizing okay this person gets it and so if we did if we go always gave us physical manifestations every time then we would never learn patience said we would become even more impatient with life that's not that we would become impatient with God said God I prayed for that you gave it to me immediately now I'm praying it's not happen he said just in life we become more impatient we' become more impatient with each other we become more impatient with things and we become just impatient uh Restless people there's the wisdom of God so it writes Paul writes in Hebrews 10:36 for ye have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise there's your patience again that enduring that persevering that sustaining and that uh to preserve something to hold on to it you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise Revelations 2:19 he says I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience in thy Work works and the last to be more than the first when God is giving this recitation of what he's seen your Works your charity your service faith and thy patience brother bandam teaches us in the church age book that faithfulness and patience go together he says in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness if you have real Faith patience is the result of it patience he says that fa patience is the outcome of faithfulness it seems sometimes that we've confused real faith for being that overt aggressive pushy demeanor right man that person who's just pushing they're the ones with real faith when the person the person with real faith is the one that's just kind of sitting back Waiting for God to do it it's kind of kind of like the guy who doesn't talk a lot he's just real quiet when things start getting built up we mentioned it before we've all experienced it where people are talking trash and they're pushing and they're yelling and there's a guy over there saying I don't want any problems he's the one trying to get away from cuz he's the one that knows he can whip everybody in the room so he doesn't have to prove anything but it's the guy over there kicking off his flipflops and ripping his shirt off who screaming and yelling that's the guy that's going to end up with a bloody nose CU he's asking for it and he can't back up what he's talking but the guy who could just sit back and wait he's not trying to cover anything up I sometimes have to go in those realms for certain people who live there for so long that's the only way that they can relate to certain things people are wondering who's he talking about well let me just but there's a a patience that we need you have faith and patience he says patience is the outcome of faithfulness he writes there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of our faith so for if if our faith isn't tried there is no patience as it says in James 1:3 knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience so faith is it's faith is the seeds or it's the foundation it's the Genesis of patience and once faith can be married with patience the the outcome is certain with no intervening detours or mistakes because you'll just wait on the Fulfillment of God's promised word adding to that Faith patience in second Peter chapter 1 verses 3 to9 I'd like to read this uh these several verses a as an effort of just getting us to consider the full stature of a perfect man and how all these things are working together especially with some statements one particular statement we read before and some other statements we'd like to read tonight Peter writes according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue there's this beautiful Cemetery with Ephesians 1 where this is to those who are in Christ this is to those who have been born again who have his Spirit we have been given divine power he's given us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue so he says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now we realize the world that is the corruption that is in the world through lust goes back to the original sin and how that Satan worked on the woman causing this impatience and she acted out of turn and out of season and engaged in an activity that brought death upon All Mankind and thrust them out of the garden now we all come into this world uh into corruption but by the new birth we've escaped corruption that is in the world through that original sin and so this all he's speaking to people who've been born again and he says and beside this giving all diligence there's some kind of persistence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness there's these things that are just working together into godliness brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound the abounding comes through the addition if you add to your faith virtue you have abounded your faith when you add to your virtue knowledge you've abounded that when these things begin to marry and join together and coal house there's there's an abounding for these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be bare nor UNR fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins there are those who are the forgetful hearers those that do not do those who uh cherry-pick or see it their own way he says those who lack these things are blind and cannot see a far off and have actually forgotten what nature they were of before brother Brenham writes in the chapter age of chapter 8 of the church age book God gives us exceeding in great precious promises exceeding great in Precious promises you see this fit in with second Peter there said he has promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we pray into the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience into our souls for only in patience do we possess life only in patience do we possess life may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of the sixth age learned patients we read the history of the lives of these great Christians and what a contrast we see between their lives and Ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all but overcome and over impatience and haste if somebody had a real reason maybe just to kind of lose it maybe they did in the sixth Church age and here we are with all of our luxuries and fineries and everything that we have and you know it's when when the air conditioner doesn't get below 72 we're over there checking it with the radar gun and like man this thing won't blow cold air and it's like well it's 67 that's not bad it used to blow 63 and and we're getting oh should we should we go out of town should we get a hotel what should we do should we call Brother David we're just all panicking and meanwhile people in other ages are losing their lives right and they're just kind of like hey if this is what God has for me 78 degrees in my living room then I'll take it whatever he has they were patient and quiet and today we're all but overcome in over impatience and haste and ain't nothing but the truth it's what we're living in it's the time we're living in brother Bram is saying that if God is going to fulfill his word it requires patience if he gave it to you sooner than he ought to it would seow seeds of impatience we would become even more impatient with life we would never lve patience we wouldn't have this critical virtue that holds things together that's part of our abounding in Christ that it's what strengthens our relationships in our relationships to one another whether it be as Pastor to congregation or congregation to Pastor husband to wife parents to children children to parents brother to sister in a church and family relationships uncles to nieces whatever it is there's two no greater attributes we could have for one another than grace and patience and where those two things are lacking it's going to be Strife it's going to be quit time it's going to be it's going to be war and so we need these if we're going to see uh promises fulfilled and potential fulfilled so we' read already in reference in James chap 1: 2 3 and 4 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into many diverse Temptations knowing this that the Trine of your faith worketh patience there's simply this patience is this product there's no other way in which to gain patience except that your faith be tried but then notice this product of patience but let patience have her perfect work there's this handoff Faith secures it and possesses it it trusts it to patience and patience says give me a moment or two or three or four hold tight but let me do my perfect work that may be perfect and entire wanting nothing anxious for nothing Restless for nothing let patience have her perfect work this to me is just at the heart and the core of the importance of patience and how the death of patience is the ruin of us all is it robs us of our trust in Christ Our Rest In Christ and really what's the point in being a Christian right like if we can't just trust God if we don't just aren't just happy with what he's done for us and we let everything else agitate us and C us to act out of his character then what's the real benefit of the Cross what what has his blood done for us what where is his love pain dividends in my personal life and in my relationship with others if I'm not letting patience have her perfect work now as we've read from second Peter chapter 1 notice what brother brandham says here in the Statue of a perfect man when he looks at this adding to your faith patience he says if you've got faith it worketh patience the Bible said so this is patience and that focus with me I have um I have a lengthy statement from where I think Pentecost failed I'd like to I'm going to try to finish on that it's a very long statement I want to read through it I just felt like I had to keep intact so we're getting very close to that now I want you just to very Focus intently on what brother bam is saying now that's the next thing is going to build this stature you know God has got real material in his building see how short we are brother sister and I read that I'm like come on brother Brown's making short jokes like I can't avoid it he says see how short we are brother sister see where we're at we have Glory have shouts and things because we've got faith but when we come down to these things here God can't build us into that stature so there's this maturing there's this growing he says we have these things because Faith but we we're trying to come into an image we're trying to grow and mature and he says he can't build this stature says he can't he can't make us up that kind of place we got all these other things we fall slide off with it we can't build his church he can't build his church patience with what what kind of patience first thing is have patience with god notice this statement how profound it is if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith worketh patience if you have real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience maybe the way some people act is not not because they have faith but because they lack faith and some people sit back as Spectators thinking I must not have faith because I'm not as demonstrative I'm not as loud I'm not as vocal I'm not as active I'm not as aggressive I'm not as showy I'm not doing all these other things maybe I don't have faith but he's saying if you have real genuine faith you'll have patience because Faith worketh patience that trying of your faith When God says anything you believe it notice what this anchors in his word that's all you got patience say well I asked him last night to heal me and I'm just as sick this morning oh my what patience God told Abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign he was still believing he was patient with God here's the secret put him always before you let him be the next Crossing thing you can't cross him so just keep him before you he said so and it's going to happen keep him before you amen that's what you do did he make the promise keep it before you don't lose sight of the promise make that keep that before you it's when we take our eyes off the promise he said it would happen and instead of just trusting him like well maybe if I did this and maybe if I did that and maybe if I did this and maybe I did that and it's not Faith anymore it's you trying to make it work that workup the statue of a perfect man it's this maturing it's this growing it's a process of character development in our text we we read from Ephesians 1: 3-6 brother benam uses this in his text and what where I think Pentecost failed if you're familiar with the sermon whether you've listened to it recently or it kind of stuck in your minds or if you'd like to go listen to it or read it uh here in the future he's preaching in some ways his teaching on adoption which I believe was very clear that your adoption is not your birth that when you're born again you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is an inside teacher to bring you to a place of maturity to place you and if there is some uh intangible aspects to that I think that remains it remains that way for each person to individually grow into who God's called them to be into your particular calling in placing so it says this in Ephesians chapter 1 starting with verse three blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ this is to the born- again believer those who have the Holy Ghost according as Heath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will this isn't so much our election to New Life this isn't the seed germ inside of us being brought to life through a quickening of the Holy Spirit but it is that life now growing and possessing this vessel and maturing it's these things being in you and abounding it's adding to Faith virtue and placing all these things to where Christ is being manifested in our flesh as we mature and grow up into him who is the head having predestined us unto adoption to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved this is a scripture that specifically uh brother vam used when preaching the hear ye hymns and blasphemous names and other things he took this concept and this idea also from Galatians of what adoption is now we've never taken it just as a subject in itself I think it's certainly worthy of a decade of teaching uh it's been worthy of you know nearly three decades of study for me but it's a very important subject and we've touched on it in different places and once again we'll just kind of throw it in there in this particular part of the sermon of what brother brandham taught on adoption what he taught on adoption is that you're born again by the Holy Ghost and then there's this growing into this place of trust to where your name on the check is just as good as your daddy's does it take anything away from a born son or a daughter of God because they have access to the same power the same Capital by The Authority that's given them as a son but this growing into maturity is when power becomes fully vested in the sun to sign the check himself and now he has power not just a policeman with the badge but now he's come to a place where I am you and you are me there's this Oneness there's this maturity it's where the father says you know whatever he says goes brother mam went to Great Links to bring this law of adoption out of the Old Testament he went to Great Links to show it in the life of Jesus Jesus Christ so it is something that I believe is important but yet the devil likes to mess with it and I'll say this messing with it will eventually cause problems in the moment it might make a lot of sense well why does he say this when this and he says this here and in the moment it it might you might feel the need to Tinker with it a little bit especially when people use it as an excuse well I cheated on my wife because I'm not adopted okay well let's just change everything brother B taught on adoption so that people don't have that as an excuse and it might make some sense at the time but mess with it and there's consequences and recognize how brother brandom is addressing this and what it leads to because if you do change the IDE if you change the word in one place trust me it's G to it's going to show up you will deviate just a little bit you you you're going to it's going to manifest in other areas and if you reject the bride age you can only become lowercase pent costal if you reject adoption you can only become you'll only return back to your uh to your vomit there's a lot of things in there that if you mess with you're left with fleshly carnal glare of another age things so in where I think Pentecost failed he says I believe in shouting speaking in tongues and we all say Amen we believe in it of course we believe in it right otherwise I'd have been wrong we believe in shouting speaking in tongues but I'm trying to play something to you says you may be mad at me now but you won't be up there I like that you may be mad at me now you may not like me now but eventually you'll see that I'm correcting an erir in your way and it'll it'll give you true Liberty you'll make it he says notice it's true now watch what happened when this father after this child had been born into the family yet he did not inherit anything until his life proved out to be the right kind of a child and the tutor which is the holy spirit in our case brought word to the father all the time how this child was progressing now do you you does that is that familiar with us what brother mam taught on the obedient son he uses the tutor as the uh the Holy Ghost as the tutor in the examples he used in ancient times of the law of adoption he referred to it in the Old Testament a son was born into the family so he has the life of the father he's a son just the same and he's given a tutor to train him in the ways of the father and there comes a certain time that when the tutor reports back and says he's a chip off the old block he's great he's just like you and he has the ceremony of adoption now where the hangup is for a lot of people when they study the message of the hour brother Bram starts talking about a disobedient son and he says how that disobedient son doesn't go to church he doesn't believe in laying hands on the sick he stays out of church to watch I love Susi he smokes he drinks he cheats he does all these things and yet he's a son and brother R said he's a son but that son can't be adopted and the Instinct knowing what we know is to say well then he never had the Holy Ghost what he really needs is the Holy Ghost right and that wouldn't be illogical we reading all the things that brother brandham said that this Disobedience son did we wouldn't attribute that to the Holy Ghost so because that son needs adoption we could say then what he needs is an actual New Birth experience and then he won't do those things anymore and if we only stop there I'm wanting to preach a decade's worth of sermons right now if we only stop there then there there's some logic to it but brother Brenham always said let's change the picture but on the other hand let's look at the other son and this other son believes in laying hands on the sick he goes to the meting and he casts out Devils he goes to church he says what the father says he believes he does everything he's told to do and the tutor keeps coming back saying that's your boy he's a chip off the old block he's just like his daddy and he says that son needs a doctor if we're if we don't follow in the conu what brother br's trying to teach and present to the church especially in the hour and the age of adoption out of a Pentecostal age into a bride age out of a church age cycle into the open of the word if we don't catch the time he's trying to bring us to he's saying there's a time when the Holy Ghost Field are going to be placed to fulfill God's ultimate purpose to bring forth a translation and a change of our bodies an adoption time and brother says that son also needs adoption so the adoption is not your birth it's your placing that son who needs adoption that son who can be placed is not one who did all those things because of his own effort and discipline naturally brother said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to believe your word that's what he says the obedient son does over and over again he says Amen to the word he says Amen to the word he has the Holy Ghost and because he's been patient because he's been faithful he comes to a place of maturity and adoption and placing and that's what brother bram's referring to here when he say says the Holy Ghost is a tutor in our case now we've tried to jump the fence we've tried to stick the cart before the horse you tried to claim things and do things before God did it and got a lot of Flesh worked up into it and that's what's the matter with the church notice where he's identifying the problem with the church has something to do with the beginning of things the holy ghost moving but not a trusting the faith not being join with patience he says I believe in these things but I'm trying to place something before you we've jumped the fence got the cart before the horse claim things do things get a lot of work up in the flesh he said that's what's the matter with the church his title is where I think Pentecost failed so I was looking at this from the stpoint this week of well how does he really Define Pentecost and he says earlier in the message there was a a group of people called themselves Pentecost saw the pillar fire received the Holy Ghost received the gifts of the Spirit speaking in tongues and so forth and away they went moved right on out and caused a Revival this is that genuine outpouring of the Holy Spirit into the leot Dean age the restoration of the gifts it is is this Mark and this characterization as Pentecost but brother R is saying they failed somewhere along the way and he's talking about being adopted he's talking about this process and having the Holy Spirit he says you don't have to talk so much about it God does his own talk talking now I'm trying to summarize an entire Sermon Just even not just where Pentecost failed but this idea of patient Liberty Faith being married together with patience producing the promise and the concept of adoption brother says we've tried to claim things do things before God did it got a lot of work up in the flesh and he and he's talking about how that we gone out we've moved out cause Revival but he says God does his own talking God testifies of his gifts but all those gifts are wonderful they are Dandy and we love them all better right you're not a better more revelated Christian if you despise the gifts if you talk bad about people who are more emotional and you make fun of churches that have a certain way of expressing themselves in worship you're you're not a better Christian than those who say that we're not a good church because we don't have those things we're just as bad so they're Dandy we love them they're wonderful God grant that every one of us would have every gift but I'd rather have the giver than all the gifts I'd rather have the giver than all the gifts Paul said though I have the gifts without the giver he says now if we have been went to if we had went to seeking the giver instead of the gifts I believe the church would have been farther up the road now if you could recognize this within the continuity of the message of the hour that brother Brandon brought the church to a place where we came up higher to see God in his program that at the open of the word from then on comes the word and the word only Look Away to Jesus we're now having our spiritual Amnesia removed we're coming to know the our mate the revealed word we're believing that we're in this cycle of a change we know we're going to meet him one day in the air but just let a little time pass and we get a little bit anxious instead of continuing to seek his face instead of staying in his presence we chased after the gifts instead of The Giver the Holy Ghost and those gifts that got poured out made away for the Holy Ghost himself but after time we get impatient and we chase after the gifts he says if we would have just sought the giver instead of the gifts we'd be further down the road he says don't you think so if we'd stayed close to God and loved him here's the Simplicity that is in Christ and just kept living for him and not trying to push things over just live for God and live a pure holy life and live and pray every day and keep yourself refreshed in his presence God will take care of the rest of it isn't that just isn't that awesome I'm not saying this is just easy that in the morning all you got to do is pop a pill and you're going to do this it's a fight to do it but man this is the way to live don't try to push things over just live for God live a holy life pray every day keep yourself in his presence God will take care of the rest what the rest of what everything else do this believe God trust him with your life stay in his presence pray read your Bible God will take care of the rest and then he says now you could get by with anything in America everybody still awake let's hear this let's listen to this he says now you can get by with anything in America I went to a service here not long ago now let's see if you can guess what service he was in I went to a service here not long ago and they were supposed to be practicing Divine Healing the fellow was jumping up and down screaming to the top of his voice and kicking the pulpit as hard as he could and said God I demand you oh mercy I thought God be merciful to my brother he doesn't understand who are we to demand God do anything he's already done it just believe him that's all had an old fellow in a sheet shaking him back and forth like this a man with heart trouble I felt sorry for him another man come up with rheumatism he shook that away and hit he hit him just as hard as he could with his hand and said I hate rheumatism said that don't take Devils out Devils don't care how much you holler he's not hard of hearing but he certainly knows where Faith lays and that's one thing that'll make him move remember how brother baram conducted his prayer because we believe in prayer lines I preached this uh not this past weekend the weekend before last time I preached on a weekend was in flag step and just I thought there were wonderful meetings there in Flagstaff and we preached on the union of the visible with the invisible and we we preaching on just the open of the word Gentile faith and those things and i' preached on Saturday night and in the office the next morning one of the pastors from Denver said brother Aaron what do you think about prayer lines and I was like who's been peeking at my notes and brother Jim Ed Dalton said we believe in prayer lines I just deferred to him he said we believe in it brother brandham did it and I believe we can do it and I say Amen to that I believe in it I absolutely believe in the laying on of hands I think it's important but my what I said is I think sometimes the context is missing where we don't have the appropriate context that we're laying hands on the sick according to the word of God and when you're healed through this Dynamic is because God made a promise and with the proper context we don't create the negative Dynamic of relying on an evangelist hands or the mechanics of the prayer line because there's times when brother brandham has said would call a prayer line or that brother Bram and his prayer lines they were done away in a particular way that was reverent and there's times when he manifested a gift in a very profound staggering way of looking into people's hearts and lives but then he would also say come through the prayer line now and he'd say Lord give her her healing Lord grant her healing now you tell me you tell me was one better than the other can both be just as effective and and there was a way that he was doing it where he wasn't trying to scare the devil he wasn't yelling and screaming he wasn't getting all worked up but it was done in such a way to where the people could take God at his word and not the Charisma the Riz of the Prophet that don't take out Devils he says continue I'm just reading this directly in all the these paragraphs in a row here he says Jesus had the greatest anointing of any man that was ever on the earth anybody want to guess when that was is that right one day he went into the temple anybody want to guess now was it when he braided the Whip and got angry and shouted and screamed and kipped over tables right that had to be it right they gave him the scroll he picked it up with his hand he sat down and he read over in Isaiah where it said the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year and so forth the Jubilee year and he took the scroll and handed it back back and set down precious words proceed from his mouth the greatest anointing that was ever in the world on the Lord Jesus Christ while he was teaching I said it that's where the greatest anointing was he says oh sometimes we methodists get noise confused with anointing didn't realize we knew so many methodists sometimes we get noise confused with anointing noise ain't an oting no no I've seen where there's a lot of noise and not enough Faith to cure a toothache you've got to come solemnly to the father you've got to to know exactly where you are standing that's right I believe it with all my heart and I think that's where the church has failed I mean he's he's he's diagnosing things he's recognizing where the church failed now there's not some failure in the gifts the gifts are real there's not failure in shouting there's not failure in speaking in tongues there's not failure in laying hands on the sick there's not failure in believing that God's a Divine healer but it's that going it's that getting worked up and flesh getting worked into it and he's I'm going to show you as we keep reading here how brother Bram is identifying that there was this I want to say it in my words it's impatience I'm not trying to put words in brother Ram's mouth but it's this impatience he says I believe it with all my heart he said uh that's right I believe with all my heart I think that's where the church failed now listen I think we failed to bring love Among Us and to bring Fellowship among the groups and things like that and we've tried to push oursel into something that God has not ordained and I believe that we could just walk back down the line to God and say God here I stand nothing at all I have to offer you but my life but God I pray that you'll let me live so that I'll find Grace in your sight now you're coming along getting pretty close to the kingdom that's right then you'll see a real healing meeting it's there it's our promise when you come up to the altar don't come glory to God I received the Holy Ghost 40 years ago praise God hallelujah that don't do no good Satan don't care how much you say that the thing of it is to walk up with a true Assurance in your heart that you know where you are standing let's stay stay focused here we're doing really really good on time continuing he says' I was amazed here long ago not long ago at a little woman came down to the platform there were two of them together and one of them come through and said how do you do sister the brother B's addressing her in the prayer line he says now remember I believe in all the spiritual demonstrations yes sir I've received the baptism Holy Ghost and I know what I speak of and I trust you believe in them too we believe in it we have the Holy Ghost we know what we're talking about we when someone speaks in tongu which has happened in this church when someone shouts and cries it happens in this church when it happens it doesn't send a chill down our spine we love it we believe in it but there is brother bam is trying to place the church recognizing where they failed and he says and they come down the line and the little lady come up to the prayer line and she started dancing around real fast and I said would you stand still just a minute so I could speak to you she couldn't do it and she just kept dancing around well I thought I'll try the next one and I got the next one to come down and I tried to take a ho of her hand and I said oh I'd like to talk to you a little bit sister and then she started dancing around I said oh I love that it's it's beautiful I know Mariam danc in the spirit I believe in it yes sir all right so is there's a correction to any kind of attitude that would look at that and try to cast that out as an unclean SP cast that as an unclean Spirit we want to be very careful with that but yet we realize that in doing that alone it's zero Vindication at all about what's down inside of somebody's heart that's why brother Brandon most often identified the physical demonstration of the spirit through gifts and he called out cut hair and ungodly living and it follows in every movement that emphasizes it even in the message he says I believe in it yes sir but there's times for all things and when you're coming up here come come soberly in the presence of God come with a perfect assured heart that God's going to keep his word and melt yourself down by the Holy Spirit don't puff yourself up melt yourself down humility yielding and this is a staggering statement and the little lady I don't know what happened and one of them I'm sure had cancer she's probably dead tonight well that escalated quickly right she didn't just miss out on a Prayer she missed out on life I'm sure he says she had cancer she's probably dead tonight why but she just wouldn't stand still what did Brother bam say it was critical to dress in the bride with the word if she just sit still long enough you couldn't get anywhere because the woman had been taught wrong a wonderful person no doubt the wrong kind of teaching the wrong kind of emphasis and I we're looking at where Pentecost failed we're talking about patient Liberty we're wrapping this up tonight he said that woman was taught wrong she felt like she had to dance and push out things and do things and get all excited he saids now that was a Pentecostal woman so he's wanting us to understand what he means by Pentecost and here stood a little woman behind me that belonged to what we call a formal denomination standing back there with a little girl and she wasn't making a move at all and she had her prayer card and she walked standing there waiting what a beautiful picture of two kinds of message Believers right the the uh the fundamental the formal you know maybe the one that or looks that way and the others that may be more charismatic I can't remember how brother kidra digs you know used the language to express it but there's that fundamental Faith but then there's the Pentecostal experience and and there's a genuine of that but what a different picture someone coming they they obviously believe they're they're in the prayer line they're just too busy doing a jig and time for the prophet to pray for them to get their healing and they' danced danced and shouted and brother B said they're dead probably dead tonight but here's one who seems to be more of a formal sort and she wasn't making a move at all after a while they give time for her to come the little lady walked out the little girl walked up there took a hold of my hand she said look at here mother began to raise her leg and her mother began crying wilted down she said brother bandam I know it would happen just knew it would happen she said I believe with all my heart I said what was wrong with the child she said she was paralyzed in both legs there it was there you are before before she even got there got up there says look here mama been it' been resolved she come the appropriate way she come fearing God God believing walking up there reverent before God believing his promise do you realize how the devil is trying to shake something in front of us and get us all excited and bring us out of that real sober God-fearing Faith he said where a real saintly little woman just m mistaught came across the plat platform I couldn't even pray for and the woman thought she was in the spirit she was in the flesh but of course she was there she should have stayed showed what was in that Spirit the fruits prove what it was when you come to God you must come soberly sanely believing asking then if God heals you sure then raise your hands and give him praise that's right that little woman walked down there and hugged that little girl the father came running out of the audience like that he said brother I've been a sinner for years my wife's a Christian can I find Jesus right now I said yes my brother just kneel right here see that's the way we want the meeting isn't that right that's something that's sane solid and is sound that's the kind of church we want that's the kind of church I want I want a church that believes God that's God-fearing godb believing that's reverent before God believes his promises where there's liberty for God to heal there's liberty for someone to come and get prayed for if they need to there's liberty for them to shout and to praise God when they're healed but not this oppressive Dynamic of making everyone feel compelled to fit a certain image and every everyone feeling like they failed because they don't fit it something's lacking something's wrong The Other Woman this Pentecostal woman was thought she was in the spirit but she was in the flesh but this mom this maybe more formal the more reserved type she just stood there believing she wasn't moved at all and before she even get before brother brandom healing had taken place she came the appropriated way God-fearing God believing those who are playing could come to their instruments in Psalms 46:10 be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the earth he will be exalted he will manifestly declare his presence he will prove himself to be the same yesterday today and forever he will move in our midst whether it be ways of Divine Healing or even a refreshing or Reviving in our physical Spirits there can be crying there can be weeping there can be dancing there can be shouting there could be people slay in the spirit but we must first be still and know that he is God resting trusting patient brother brand in the sermon experiences says now I do not wish for anyone to be in a hurry he's talking about how when Jesus's name was first mentioned it caused the baby to jump in the womb of Elizabeth he says now I do not not wish for anyone to be in a hurry you write this down this to make a great uh you can make it for the Graham do some really nice watercolor uh fating and a beautiful sunset in the background and manifesting abundance he says I do not wish for anyone to be in a hurry always be just as quiet and just as calm and cool be quiet be calm and cool this is what brother BR is saying before you come to a prayer line don't get worked up don't become fanatical just be quiet calm and cool I'm wanting to be I want to be in the center of God's perfect will and I go to Great Links uh in speaking on this to where I'm not I don't feel that I need to emphasize uh well my emphasis is trying to bring a balance away from some of the the fear factors the devil uses the Temptation he's using that enticement of our flesh the the the impatience of things need to be excitable things need to change and we're not just setting hearing the word of God we're not just uh receiving the anointing of the word and we're not growing and being more mature and and letting God do the rest there's a lot of emotional workup and things so I feel like there's maybe this need to uh uh to call to away from one side but in doing doing so I'm not I don't want to be identified with those that point the finger at the other group and make fun of and laugh and poke and ridicule I think it just eventually what it just polarizes right and both sides start drawing swords and they start taking shots and eventually it's the one in the middle that takes all the shots and and if that's so I'm just glad that there's people in the middle that are willing to call to both sides and say come back to the balance of what the prophet taught take God at his word believe all things are possible but recognize the day and age we're living in and the promise for this hour and what the emphasis needs to be in this time and how God is bringing a bride to Perfection and what her true Revival is and not try to rework message history massage the message and make things work this way so that it fits your particular Paradigm or can justify a certain way that you feel that things should be emphasized just take God at his word be still and know that I am God the power of transformation says now that's what we're here for he's talking about the word the word the word the word he said that's my message has been all along is the word of God we must hold to that regardless of what other things take place always stay with that word always check out your motives and objectives if it's according to the word of God if it isn't leave it alone but if it's with the word of God and lines up with the word of God then you hold to that patience because he says God sometimes just like our little group here this morning he lets it not happen just overnight we're the ones that get in a hurry God is never in a hurry he just says it and it's going to be for when he says anything it's got to be it's just going to be he lets it take its time it's going to happen Saints whatever he's promised is going to happen let's just be patient trust him at every turn in every moment believing Lord you made the promise no matter how dark it gets you made the promise I will see it through to the end that's the message that it's been all along it's the word of God hold to that stay with that there's a lot for you to consider in these things I trust that if you're listening to these things you go back and think about them take them all together on the subject of Liberty because this is what we want in our lives is true Liberty perfect Liberty and I started with perfect Liberty and then we dealt with imperfect Liberty and impatient Liberty and today we finish with patient Liberty there's your patience let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing Brother David if you could just get ready maybe to lead in worship after we begin worship let's just stand together
