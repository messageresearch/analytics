TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the original Covenant of perfect love and I'd like to through this service we're going to be pulling a lot from the sermon marriage and divorce and I don't say that now just to get everybody up tight but I will say that that is one of the most misunderstood sermons that brother Bradham preaches uh and perhaps maybe one where people draw out a lot of things from it and they put this emphasis on it where in my heart perhaps the wrong emphasis is put on it and brother Branham is teaching this lengthy sermon and there's just some things that we kind of zero in on and focus on and we kind of Miss I think the bigger picture that brother Branham was expressing so I'd like to at the outset um I'm going to start with Paradox paragraph 66 I have all the way to 76 here before me but I'll read this at the outset it's going to kind of put it put some pieces out there it says now if that he says we have two schools of thought on marriage and divorce and so when he says there's two schools of thought pay close attention that he's not necessarily saying there's only two schools and that one of those is right he's saying this these are the Prevailing schools of thought one of them says the man can only be married once unless his wife is dead and that's one of the questions but you go to following that you go overboard and then next says oh if the wife or husband either one has committed adultery either one of them can be put away and married again you find yourself overboard with that so it's neither Southeast or Northeast we want directly east you'd run out of scripture when you go this way and you'd run out of scripture when you go that way we want to know where scripture meets scripture and know that's the truth of it he says each takes a different way and failed to bring up the correct answer but there still must be an answer and he's and then he uses the two great schools of Doctrine in terms of Calvinism and armenianism he says one's a legalist the other one's Grace and he says that people who believe in the grace say bless God don't hurt me to smoke don't hurt me to drink I can do these things I've got eternal security then on the other side the legalist oh I'd like to ball them out I'd like to show them a piece of my mind but I'm a Christian I have to keep still so he's showing these two different sides he says you find yourself on two different roads he says and neither one of them is right now that's hard to say but it's the truth we find ourselves on two different roads one going one way one another now let's see what truth is so now again his Pursuit is truth at the outset of this and then this is the part that I really wanted to read but I felt that that kind of gives greater context to this he says now and let's see if this sounds sensible to you for instance if I got ready to go overseas I'll take my own family I'll call my wife to me and I'll say I'm going overseas dear now here's the legalist side now my wife I'm going to lay down the law to you if you flirt with any man while I'm gone when I come back you're a divorced woman and I don't want you making eyes don't want you flirting you understand that I'm your husband you do it I'm going to put you away when I come back then she reaches and gets me by the time and says my good man I want to tell you something if you make eyes at any woman or anyone or take any woman out or flirt with any woman you're going to be a divorced man when you come back now wouldn't that be a happy home that's legalist he says the other side now if I go overseas I make a mistake go over and say now look I take this woman out it's all right with my wife she don't care my wife say I'll go out with this man it's all right built with Bill he don't care if I don't care then there's something wrong with me so that's that's a really good point if I don't care there's something wrong with me I don't love that woman right and if she don't care there's something wrong with her she's my wife I don't want other men fooling with her she's my wife he says now the correct way of it is there's both of them has got a truth but not the exact truth so see the things he's kind of entered into the record he says now when I go overseas to make it right my little family gathers around we pray with one another and I commit them to God they commit me to God and when we do we go overseas I now I know she loves me I have confidence in her and I love her she's got confidence in me as long as I love her like that she don't have any worry about me taking another woman out as long as she loves me right why there's no need of me thinking about any other man going out with her because she's my wife and I believe her I believe if I would actually do something wrong make a mistake and go out with some other woman and return back and would confess it to her and tell her me to I didn't mean to do that I just got caught in a trap the woman just run right up to me and grab me and start and so and so I believe she would be understanding I believe she would forgive me for it but I wouldn't do it for nothing because I love her though she would forgive me I wouldn't do it I wouldn't hurt her for nothing though I know she would forgive me for it I don't want to hurt her that's quite quite a scenario and that's the way it is with God if Ophelia love which is human love Fellowship love can make a man feel that about his wife what about agape love the Greek word meaning the love of God how would that make me do about Jesus Christ I as long as I want to do it it's in my heart to do it I say as long as it's in my heart to do it I go do it legalism won't let me do it it's because I know it I'd get punished for doing it but the real truth of it is this is a part I think that just I want you to hold in your hearts but the real truth of it is when the love of God comes into your heart until you want to do it that's the truth of it he said there's the two schools no legalism or other or the Calvinism it's both so that's uh I'd like you to keep that in mind at the outset as we go forward he said there's got to be an exact truth and I believe what he's identifying is the exact truth is right there in perfect love in the love of God so just a few things to capture what we were on last Sunday it was on for God so loved the world we spent a few services on that and the world we're talking about is the original world that God created and in that world it was under a covenant of perfect love they were one with God and each other uh so being that having that Harmony and that Unity there's no fear there was no shame and we know that brother Branham in Christ is the mystery God revealed is pointing to this but the God's love was expressed in the unfolding of the image of that man and that woman in the beginning brother Branham says in marriage and divorce then we find out that everything in the beginning was running in perfect order and harmony with God nothing was out of cater so that's the original world that God loved everything in its place everything operating everything in harmony that's in the beginning perfect Order Perfect Harmony nothing was out of cater and this is the arrangement of man and woman and that was a union that was marriage is what's being expressed there brother Brahm in the sermon invisible union he says marriage is the oldest institution in the world marriage was performed first and instituted in the Garden of Eden we know that he characterized this Union as his first Masterpiece it was a masterpiece family so this is something that God loved as he brought forth the woman out of the man he was portraying the bride knowing that the bride was God's heart purpose and the reason why he created the world we see that the world that God loved is embodied in the heaven and the Earth the man and the woman that come forth this expression in this image Bill Graham said they had perfect love for one for the other perfect life forever they had perfect love and a perfect understanding of the love of God that was man and woman in the beginning as God had intended them to be United in perfect love under a commandment be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth and I want to call that world say that that was the original Covenant that God had the original love Covenant this perfect love one for another this perfect love for God all of them bound together under one Covenant now if you'll take a look at Genesis chapter 2 and we hope to be jumping fully into this now Genesis chapter 2 verses 23 and 24. now as the woman came out from him and they were brought together this is Adam's declaration this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh now I believe I'll probably make this point later on but notice how the Paul says that we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones and and he quote quote he's quoting these very same scriptures from Genesis 23. flesh of his flesh bone of his bones flesh of his flesh he says we are born of his bones and flesh of uh flesh of his flesh and Adam is declaring this and then therefore shall a man leave his father and mother shall cleave on his wife and they shall be one flesh Paul is quoting that specifically and he says this is the great mystery so there's a mystery in this even in the beginning and this is part of that original Covenant the man's attitude towards the woman what the woman meant to the man and this is where we drew from in Ephesians 5 29 for no man yet hated his own flesh when Adam looks at the woman bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh he is he's declaring that she is my own flesh brother Branham said she was right with man co-equal with man and so because they were co-equal and this is I maybe need to take a deep breath so I don't just pass over this she was right with man co-equalith man therefore there was only one there was only need of one Covenant because here's Adam she becomes a second self to him she is just like him so God didn't need um more than one Covenant it was for the both of them so there's only one marriage covenant in the beginning there was mutual love shared love it was the same it was Mutual honor mutual respect for each other and it's important to consider this how they what they shared and how it was equal and it was commiserate one with another and how that she being a second self the mirror image but yet complementary to him this is what is expressed in Genesis 2 she is me she she is everything that I am bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh and Brethren says she's co-equal with him now there's a lot that I want you to uh picture in a in your mind when we speak of this co-equality and this mutual love that they had for each other and brother Brahman in the sermon you must be born again said she couldn't get scared wasn't nothing about her to scare she had perfect love and love casteth out fear so there was in this condition she she couldn't get she wasn't afraid of anything she couldn't there was nothing about her that could be scared and she had perfect love and that perfect love kept fear away brother Branham says it this way an impersonation of Christianity he said an atom looked Lonesome so he made a byproduct for him and took a rib from his side and made him a sweetheart Eve and he loved Adam and he loved Eve there's God's perfect love for them and he takes them and I can see little Eve as she laid a little head against a shoulder of Adam and she was everything that a woman could ever and he she was everything that a woman could ever expect and more and as she laid against that big strong shoulder of her sweetheart Adam and they walked through the garden he was the son of God she was his sweetheart that was a love with no fear with no shame that it was a perfect with no guile and no hypocrisy and what I think is beautiful and how the brother Ram describes their shoulder to shoulder they're walking together they're moving together there's no power imbalance uh the woman isn't looking at him like oh my goodness that that man is so strong he's so much bigger than me and man if he got angry with me he could really let me have it or he could do a lot of damage to me or well he he's my way in this world and if I don't follow him I won't be able to eat and he's the God of all the world and if I don't listen to him then he's going to let me have it or he could banish me uh she wasn't over there just kind of checking every once in a while to see if he had other ribs and thinking oh well man he's got this many that just means there's more of me in there that he could bring out whenever he wants but it was that perfect headship of nurture and Harmony where that they were submitted to each other and it wasn't that one had something over the other because he says you you're myself you're my second self and so as it says in Ephesians 5 21 5 29 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church and so in this description I think that we can see that both Adam and Christ fit that Adam is saying to the woman you are my flesh that Christ says to his bride You Are My Flesh brother Brown said the bride and the groom is the same Flesh and Blood the same Ministry so as the woman was the same Flesh and Blood of Adam the bride is the same flesh and blood of Christ he says it's got to be his same flesh same bones Same Spirit same everything just exactly built up and the two of them then become one so as Adam would have looked at the woman and had this description we need to see that the bride today is the Fulfillment of what that foreshadowed the Bride In Christ today are the perfect fulfillment of what that typed and so what I what I like to do is turn that around to where we're that we are not a type of Adam in the woman but they were type of what God was going to achieve brother Brandon this says she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him so as he says no man ever yet hated his own flesh we could say that neither Adam nor Christ hated their wife so there is a very uh there this is a very specific saying and and I'll come back to some scriptures later but he says for no man ever never yet hated his own flesh I'm wanting to broaden our scope of what that looks like because we say wow that uh you love love your wife as yourself and no man has ever hated himself so then he must we must love her as I would me but he's actually bringing it back to the image of Adam who the woman would stand as a mere image to him and that would be himself so he would love her as a part of himself Christ then loves you as being an essential part of himself now brother branna makes this statement in marriage and divorce the woman not the man she broke the Covenant brother Brandon is saying excuse me the scripture saying no man ever yet hated his own flesh to make a point now he says the woman not the man she broke the Covenant she broke the Covenant because why she stepped across the borders of God's word now if she broke her Covenant with her husband she broke her Covenant with God then because she broke the Covenant with God she broke it with her husband now this is an important event this is an important characterization of what happened if man and the woman in the beginning were co-equal they existed together in Perfect Harmony now the woman broke the Covenant a single Covenant that they were under when she does that she does it to God she does it to her husband but now as we touched on last Sunday when the woman broke the marriage covenant and she comes to Adam and I think it's important to think about uh well maybe it's not important to think about it but it's important as the scripture says to know Adam did not sin Adam was not deceived so when she breaks the marriage covenant and she comes to him he intervenes is what brother Branham said he saved her by intervening says he took her to himself so the woman has broken the marriage covenant she comes to the man and when she comes to the man and shows him symbolically the fruit of the tree and they both partook so and it says now their eyes are open and they're both naked they're both ashamed when Adam acts he is not deceived in other words he's not overtaken by lust she doesn't re-preach the serpent sermon and he finds himself going whoa wow and receive it in his mind first and then the natural act taking place he's not overtaken by lust he acts immediately and intervenes and takes her to himself I'm just saying what brother Branham said and by the same token Adam was not in the transgression Adam was not deceived in the same way that the as the woman was and he acted in a figure of him that was to come which is Christ and so we know that Christ was not deceived into sin but he laid his life down and so as the woman broke the marriage covenant and Adam begins to act at the same time we realize she's the one that broke it Adam acted to save her in light of her break in the Covenant so in Genesis chapter 3 verse 16 when God is now not cursing the woman but this is the consequence of her sin under the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children I think we looked at that greater detail last week if not more in the past and then this statement here's what I'd like you to focus on and thy desire shall be to thy husband in he shall rule over thee well read the statements in here just a moment but this is where brother Branham says another covenants introduced it says in thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee this is not the original Covenant there's been a change in their relationship the woman broke her Covenant to God and she broke her Covenant to man now in light of the fact because thou has done this and this has happened there is a change in the Covenant there's a change in the relationship and he says thy desire shall be to thy husband that statement means co-equality has been lost but it's plain and simple when you read it he's saying oh thy desire shall be to your husband now now something's been changed to where they were once co-equal but now when he says thy desire shall be to your husband he's saying there's been a shift in the relationship in Genesis 4 7 if you go to read it God says says to Cain unto Cain shall be Abel's desire unto you shall be your brother's desire in other words there's going he would continue to submit himself to you and subject himself to you as the firstborn he said if thou doest well will you not also be accepted and and his desire shall be to you he's saying that there's a there would still be this reverence in this all and this acknowledgment that you being born first you're the heir you being born first uh you're you're the more preeminent one there's been some acknowledgment of that respect that the younger and the Lesser would have to give to the older so when he says thy desire shall be to thy husband in plain language whatever that quality was has now been diminished it's a very important to understand that and then he says and he shall rule over thee that word rooming have dominion and control over you it's used of the lights in the sky ruling the night and day so before this under the original Covenant these words aren't even used it's co-equality it's love it's honor it's respect it's reverence but it's not this dominion and control and so before there was Noah subjection in the sense of Adam exercise and Authority there is no submission in the sense that the woman was scared of Adam so there was I want you to think about that there was no subjection in this uh power imbalance sense or this exercising of authority by Adam where he's like woman I'm the head woman I'm the man it wasn't necessary even if we even though we would acknowledge the man was the head it didn't create opportunity privilege and power that he took advantage of in order to cause the woman to do what he wanted her to do and I'm going to read a statement you're going to go you should have just read that and saved five minutes but brother Adam reads this scripture Genesis 3 16 and I desire shall be to thy husband he shall rule over you points to the script she says now it was then man was made to rule over the woman by God's word she was no more co-equal with him if you ever if you're ever trying to figure out where I get this you better just jump more into this message listen listen listen to it read it read it read it read it it's available to us because this is my inspiration as the message of the hour she was then man it was then at that moment at the institution of this other Covenant that man was made to rule over the woman by God's word she was no longer co-equal with him brother Brown goes into great detail in the sermon marriage and divorce I believe even at the beginning he's kind of trying to say hey there's a lot of things I have to say here I don't know if I really want to say it and he's wanting to do it in order so that he can emphasize why there's been a change and why God has arranged things that he has after the fall but it's then with this uh when this happens when the women woman brings a double Covenant he's saying that's when the man is a rule over her and she's no longer co-equal so he realized that by her actions she brings a double Covenant wherein man is under a covenant and the woman is under a covenant and I think that's uh that is expressed in the message very clearly as brother Branham teaches this and if we could if we could just uh for time's sake think of it this way when we read Genesis chapter 3 and we see the curses and the consequences and he begins to arrange the man to the woman thy desire shall be to thy husband he shall rule over thee it doesn't mention love doesn't mention respect or reverence in the way that we would expect it to be mentioned because the Fallen nature needed a different Covenant to govern the Union so brother Branham and marriage and divorces two covenants now that closes the beginning so in the beginning was this original Covenant perfect love no fear she was a sweetheart the woman breaks that Covenant and then after the Covenant is broken the consequence to her is now there's no longer a covenant there's two Covenants and he says that closes the beginning so that original Covenant is now is barred off and gone there's new covenants that are introduced he says in marriage divorce after the fall there is another covenant made now she was no longer ruler with him each must have a separate Covenant and notice how important it is to understand why the man has made the ruler and why thy desire shall be to thy husband and even as brother bam goes on to say there's consequences in the fall why the woman couldn't occupy certain positions and have certain kinds of authority right that she she cannot fill in certain places she cannot exercise certain Authority remember I'm saying the reason why is because the role that she played in the fall and he's going to Great Lengths to say that so that we can understand why it's a range that it is she's no longer a ruler with him each must have a separate Covenant now if I could say this since I've already said it before the woman could not rule and reign with him under the double Covenant but will not the bride Rule and reign with him in the Millennium and forevermore think about that then what are the implications so he says there is a covenant for the product and the byproduct those are the two covenants after the fall after the fall there's a lot of ways we could describe this but now there's so many more emotions that are mixed in there before the fall they could never be afraid but now that there's fear and with fear comes doubt and suspicion and all these things or doubt comes fear and all these ways that you could begin to describe it this cascading domino effect of sin we find that there is now going to be fear mixed with filial love there's going to be doubt and suspicion and animosity and lust and all these other things mixed into their love it's not going to be a love of a higher intelligence it's not going to be a love that's United with one purpose and because it's not perfect it requires a different Covenant now brother Branham says in marriage and divorce now you see then after the beginning it was something else introduced he says now this is going to shock you and as I read over this and even in the past when I read over it I thought the shock and I don't know that this is too you all are going to think brother air and you you should be ashamed of yourself but to me I always read it in the sense of it's going to shock you because he's using the word sex and that somehow this polygamy and the things he begins to talk about is is shocking and pearl clutching but it's even more shocking to me now when I read this because it's like wow he saw this coming he says after the beginning it was something else was introduced something else is introduced now I would say something else was introduced therefore something else was introduced something else was introduced by the wicked one God then has to give a double Covenant it says after the beginning so the fall is after it's part of that after beginning God now secondarily sets a new nature Again by sex he created the first without sex do you believe that now it's another Covenant with nature he sets it in another order by sex so when God created he did not rely upon gender right Adam and the woman were not gendered though the Man was created and the woman was formed from the manner taken from the man but he says after the beginning once the beginning is over now with this new beginning he sets a new nature again something else is introduced and it's another Covenant with nature and he sets it in order by sex and now what's striking then is to recognize to me Satan's agenda against gender because the double covenants exist we see that what we know what the original sin was and so we see how that's associated with it but recognize how gender was at the core of that and so now that they that God then this is really going to make the devil mad in the beginning God was non-binary in the sense that there was one Covenant and then the devil's the one that created this binary system he's over there kicking something right now he's like my goodness it's backfiring which I do think it's kind of funny that they say they're non-binary thereby creating a binary structure but say this is it is by gender by sex and then I know that that has further maybe more important we know what brother Brown's referring to but now think about just on another level at a greater level but just another level how that it's one for the man one for the woman he sets in a different nature and a different order according to the sex and then brother Branham makes this statement but notice now it wasn't so at the beginning if I could say this it wasn't like this at the beginning there wasn't two covenants at the beginning she was ruler with him in the beginning at the beginning is when something else was introduced in the beginning God didn't there wasn't new Natures he didn't set a secondarily nature in there there wasn't another Covenant with one nature and another nature there wasn't another order there was one he says it wasn't so at the beginning but now it's after the beginning I this is one of the most important pieces of this sermon not the one I'm preaching necessarily but marriage and divorce it's one of the most important pieces because he wants us to understand why things are so mixed up he wants us to understand how people get into these messes and how people misunderstand and why the world is in the condition it's in he wants us to go back to the beginning when in the beginning ended and the fall is now fully accomplished this mess that we get into and as he does that he says it wasn't like this in the beginning he's not only doing it so that we could understand the mess we're in but as soon as he does that he's trying to say this is what it was like in the beginning he's wanting us to see how it should be so the phrase he says no it wasn't so at the beginning he's taken the very words of Jesus in Matthew 19. in Matthew 19 verses 3 to 8 if you'd like to look on the screens or turn in your Bibles or flip scroll whatever it is you do maybe if you have your your provision goggles maybe it just populates right there in virtual reality in 3D says the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying to him is it lawful for man to put away his wife for every cause and this is a question tempting him trying to trap him can a man divorce put away his divorce his wife for every cause can he for any reason he wants to put his wife away now notice Jesus's answer have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female Genesis 1. and and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife Genesis 2. and they twain shall be one flesh is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason and instead of and Jesus instead of trying to answer that question well that's a very good question let's let's kind of parse this down he goes all the way back and he's like wait a minute didn't you know that God in the beginning intended man and woman to be one one flesh you know kind of at least suggesting how could you divide that right I mean where is the division to this and he says wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh this is Genesis 2. he says what therefore God have joined together let no man put put asunder now that that really pinches it doesn't it he's saying okay you're saying how can a man divorce his wife for any reason and and separate and he goes well God made man and woman that that when they unite together they're one flesh how can they ever be separate whatever God has joined together this great phrase that we use in our marriage ceremonies what God has joined together let no man put asunder this can't be divided so when he says this this is naturally kind of provoked them to think okay so what you're saying is a man a man shouldn't put his wife away for any reason but now you're saying a man can't even put away his wife because they're one flesh and what God has joined together let no man put us under now we know all the creative ways that people try to get around that says well was it really God that married me when that man backslid you know that preacher's no longer in the message you realize that right and he's also I just went to the Justice they come up with all sorts of ideas that there was no way that God was part of that Union but we're not going off into the the sophism of that we're looking at the fact that his answer says and suggests to them no a man can't even divorce his wife now I'm not saying that's what he's saying but then that's that's the way they took it because look at their next question in verse 7. they send to him why did Moses then command to give a reading of divorcement and to put her away why would he allow us this writing a divorcement this rid of divorcement to put a wife away if when God has joined us together you can't put us put a asunder so that's the way that they take it is Jesus says well let me bring you back to the beginning where God made man and woman one and how are you gonna how can you divorce that the man and the wife for one flesh now you can't you can't put that asunder like well then why did Moses give us permission to do it are you are you tracking that you don't have to agree with me but I would at least want you to see well okay I see where you're coming from keep going let me know where you're wanting where you're going with this it says he said unto them here's his answer why did Moses let us divorce our wives Moses let you divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts this is his answer Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so we cannot miss this point he said well then why does why does the law let us to put away our wise why does the law give us permission to divorce our wives he's saying it's not because the wife it's because of you it's because of your hard hearts that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives he says but from the beginning it was not so well what what in the beginning was not so have we sufficiently established for our sakes this morning what in the beginning was and what after the beginning was in the beginning was Adam and the woman under one Covenant arranged perfectly together co-equal the woman broke that Covenant Adam did not break that Covenant after the Covenant is broken a new nature is set in New orders setting in there's things that have been defiled so now God secondarily sets in a double Covenant after the fall so when brother Branham answers this or when Jesus is answering this and he says well from the beginning it was not so he's wanting to think about Adam and the woman and how that the law has been instituted as a result of the fall and the reason why ye lets you divorce is because your Fallen nature so divorce and remarriage only become an issue after the double covenants instituted so when when Christ is facing the question of divorce and I would say the subsequent issue of remarriage we often we often focus on the remarriage aspect right in the sermon is marriage and divorce but we've all retitled it as who can remarry emits marriage and divorce and we all go away saying do you ever hear Brother bam sermon on remarriage you know it's true so it's only after marriage and divorce that even an issue of remarriage comes becomes an issue so on the question of divorce and I would say the issue of marriage and divorce Christ goes back to the beginning when he's asked he doesn't say well let's unpack this if you can grab your Scrolls and uh and let's just I say let's go through this a little bit and if you have any particular instance you're referring to and what causes are you talking about and he just said well let's just start off by establishing first the way God in his perfect will established it remember I said these those three sermons on God so love was a setup we're getting really close to pulling the Trap here so Christ goes back to the beginning the sermon marriage and divorce brother man says the question the true answer that Jesus wants us to go back to is to go back to the beginning when it comes to the two schools of thought when it comes to issues of marriage and divorce when it comes to the secondary issue that we think to be the most important who can remarry he says let's go back to the true answer let's go back to the beginning because that's what Jesus pointed us to he says that would be in Genesis because the word Genesis is the seed chapter to every question in the Bible so when Jesus says oh look God I said Can a man divorce his wife for any reason he says well haven't you read that in the beginning God made man male and female and whatsoever got a joint and they were one flesh and whatsoever God put together let no man put asunder he says that's God's original marriage was instituted by God In the Garden of Eden this is how God envisioned a marriage to work and they thought okay so you're saying we can't well if you're saying we can't then why did Moses say we can he goes oh if that's your question you want to know why you do and why you can't says because your hard hearts because your hard Hearts he lets you do it and he says but from the beginning that wasn't the way that it was so under the original Covenant there was a different Arrangement there was a different agreement there was a the Covenant had different actions that were required in certain actions that were were not allowed the woman acted in violation of that but after the fall it was necessary I know I keep saying this was necessary to Institute another Covenant well the original sin mixes our nature with evil see very quickly how quickly in Genesis 4 and then you go on to Genesis 6 and you see just how uh debased mankind became God's like well there's no way you don't even have the nature of the original Covenant you don't have the image of the original Covenant I can't impose that on you it required a new covenant so now in Deuteronomy chapter 24 . remember how in Ephesians 5 29 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh it was a very specific saying of Paul in the context of marriage that to a Jew he'd immediately knew exactly what he was referring to the same would have been in the minds of them that said Moses then commanded us a writing of divorce they knew exactly what they they knew exactly what scroll that was in it was it was actually probably just always open right like that was the one that they all knew by heart like I could find it blind there yeah they told you it's there there's just it was kind of a little divot in the parchment from where everyone pointed to it he says in Deuteronomy 24 1 when a man had taken a wife and married her and it came to pass that she find no favor in his eyes there's no Grace she's out of favor with him because he had found some uncleanness in her then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house there's so much more here we could get into that would provoke a lot of good discussion but we'll save it for ministers meetings and he says and it came to pass that the husband marries a woman and he doesn't have any favor any Furby more because he's found some uncleanness we have to be very careful in reading this that we don't try to uh extract anything from this by way of this is what we're being instructed to or this is what's right or this is wrong we can observe that this is just simply the case and he says and he let him write a bill of divorcement so this is the Bill of divorcement that Moses commanded them given a writing a divorcement that they're referring to so we said then why did God allow this bill of divorcement why was it necessary why why would God say all right you married her and and then you you found this uncleanness and now you you're no longer happy with her you know they have a favor with her then you can divorce her now to a to the Jews the breaking and I think this goes back to even do the original sin uh even though it's maybe not explicit in a lot of the the writings and their Doctrine but breaking the marriage bond to a Jew breaking of the marriage bond was a sign and symptom of breaking the Divine Covenant that this is this is portrayed over and over again in God's dealing with Israel and they viewed the marriage covenant as being something holy and something of God and that if one was to break that there was a Breaking of the Divine Covenant so that's why they actually need some sort of explicit law to give them that Liberty and so Jesus gives us the answer why divorce is permitted given that it's a symbolic of or even symptomatic of breaking the Divine Covenant so the marriage bonds that are broken now can point back to the fall of Man in the beginning Jesus is saying that the reason why God allowed Moses to give us a rid of divorcement or a loud divorce is after the beginning God permitted it because the hardness of the man's heart says the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives and so that's where the reason is behind this bill of divorcement the hardness of hearts that means harsh offensive intolerable impatient unkind ill-tempered selfish as a matter of fact if you wanted to take the words that are used in hardness of hearts and compare it to charity you'd find that it looks the opposite because the hardness of your hearts this is why he allowed it because you're impatient you're unkind you're selfish you think evil you're hard you're harsh and Deuteronomy 21 15 if a man have two wives one loved and another hated you'll find that as it leads up to Deuteronomy 24 the language that is used in the scripture is that when a man hated his wife that's what gave him he would that's why he was looking for a reason to put her away Deuteronomy 22 13 If any man take a wife and go unto her and hate her so Ephesians 5 21 29 is pointing specifically to the condition of man's heart towards his wife no man ever yet hated his own flesh and here he's saying you go back to Deuteronomy it says a man hates his wife and if he hate her and the scripture is bringing this up in the context of that marriage Union when a man is no longer favorable towards his wife it's the hatred he has towards her and Jesus is saying well a man divorces because he hates this is the condition after the fall that required a double Covenant to govern that Fallen nature there is under the double Covenant divorce and brother Branham says now this is I'm just gonna I'm gonna move quickly on Beyond this uh just maybe summarize it brother bam says he can put us away for Spiritual fornications and false Doctrine anytime he wants to why why Guinea the double Covenant and if you're if you find that you find out well let's we need to explain that a little bit more brother Aaron in the beginning there was no sin under the original Covenant no fornication no Spirits fornication no adultery in the beginning that's the original order now the woman after the fall God institutes another Covenant so it's only then he's saying he can put you any way he wants anytime he wants to if you look at the history of Israel Israel served God under the double Covenant desire and Dominion there was it was always it wasn't the respect in all the loving relationship it was a fearful relationship of the all-powerful god they as a matter of fact they've just been studying on some things uh and how that in the Old Testament God was not known as a father as as some sort of literal loving kind relationship of birth in relationship he was the almighty God who created the heavens and the Earth and they would only refer to him in some sort of role not in some sense that there was some sort of affinity and connection because they would when Jesus said he was the son of God they said you've made yourself equal with God so they served him in that inequality they served him under a double Covenant and God often raised that if you don't I'll put you away if you don't I'll cause this there was that that punishment under that double Covenant I'll say this it's a mouthful but I hope that maybe you could understand if the church I'll say the church and if she's only the church she serves God under this double Covenant that's all she is as a church she serves God under the double Covenant but from the beginning it wasn't so this to me is one of the most important aspects in parts of marriage and divorce from the beginning this wasn't so the original Covenant of perfect love was governed by divine power and a Divine Purpose and it represented something and signified something to us what we see now on the issue of marriage and divorce and remarriage and all the subsequent problems that flow from it is not how it was in the beginning it wasn't so from the beginnings what brother Madam keeps bringing us back to over and over and over again so if you look at Ephesians chapter 5 verses 32 and 33 . I like to read um I'd like to read this and hopefully we could just keep referring back to some of these parts here Paul says this is a great mystery this mystery of this uh man shall leave members of his body of his flesh and his bones and then leave his father and mother be joined to his wife they shall be one flesh this is a great mystery and as just as they would have in Matthew chapter 19 saying okay my wife is and I are one flesh where twin God has joined us together no man could put us asunder and they try to conceptualize that Oneness Paul says this is a great mystery and everybody could have been like you know like yeah I get it because I when I look at my wife I see too but then he immediately says but I speak concerning Christ in the church so then it's like oh the mystery is the Christ and the church are to be one flesh self-sane people just as Adam and the woman that's the mystery but Paul doesn't back off nevertheless even though I'm talking about Christ let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself Paul when he says this is a great mystery he could have been letting us off the hook oh when I was talking about one flesh when I was talking about Bono bone flesh and flesh and all that I wasn't about Christ and the church and everybody could have been like and and there could have been some sense of relief he says but nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love God so loved the world so loved his wife even as himself as she is himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband so when he says this is a great mystery and he says so therefore let every one of you in particular so love his wife the mystery held love and wives reverence her husband the mystery held reverence and it's this mystery of true love and true reverence how that the man ought to love his wife and how that she ought to reverence the husband this is a mystery that's acting in Adam in a mystery that's acted in Christ now I'm gonna I'm going to go just point back to this very quickly and Genesis chapter 3 verses 6 to 8. after the fall you'll find that the woman she acts independently of Adam with the serpent she then has this she has Fallen she's broke the Covenant already so as I portrayed it in prayer and I'm very careful to try to paint this picture that may be brother Branham didn't explicitly paint but if you take it together with scripture and how he describes it I I I suggested could it be that the woman came to Adam in in the awareness of what she had done and says I've made a huge mistake because now she's feeling guilt now she's feeling shame we try to say oh she just must have been so lustful and it must have been so exciting for her and she goes and runs and finds Adam but could you imagine perhaps that she finds herself overwhelmed with this this this feeling that she's never felt before and it's not like in a pleasurable way now this is afterwards where it's more like oh what have I done how did I get caught up in that and the pains and the guilt and now that the the passion is left she finds herself perhaps going to Adam said Adam I I messed up I've done something wrong I don't know what to do I don't know how to fix this this is what's happening Adam may have been able to see then but because love love has that discernment love says oh my and in that moment he takes her to himself and then they begin to act together as you read the scripture Adam and his wife hid themselves and here though the woman that the woman has just committed adultery against her husband and Adam now is standing staying by her side and you read these few verses they themselves they themselves they're always acting together in that moment whatever they do they do together even though they may be wrong they're fleeing they're dressing themselves they're doing all these different things together Adam remains there together with her so the picture that you must I believe you must see this when brother bam is telling us what Adam did and he acted in the image of Christ and he portrayed this and he took her to himself and he put his seed in her and all those things she should have been burned with the serpent all these things brother bam says when the woman sinned when the woman committed adultery Adam did not put her away in divorce Adam did not separate from her Adam didn't go sleep in another Vineyard Adam did not act in a way to say well you know what I just need some time you know you'll I'll be with the giraffes he does not leave her to be condemned what Adam did at the moment that she in the the moment that he realized she had broke her Covenant to God and had broke her Covenant to him when he's fully aware and he's feeling the weight of a broken Covenant Adam acted quickly to cleave to her and he joined himself to her to save her from certain death so when the woman had broke her Covenant to God and broke her Covenant to Adam what Adam does in that moment and I want to say he instinctively did this he didn't say I just need some time I need to figure this out I need to work through this he didn't have a bunch of questions you know where is he I'm gonna go get him in his mind he just immediately acts and he joins himself to her to save her from death if I could say this he redeemed her why did he redeem her because he's under the original Covenant under the original Covenant there's marriage no divorce under the original Covenant it was a singular Covenant that governed Adam and the woman as one unit and there was only marriage no divorce so whenever she broke the Covenant Adam acts according to the Covenant to redeem her she broke the Covenant through unfaithfulness but Adam was faithful to the Covenant in other words if Adam had divorced her he would have broke the original Covenant Hallelujah she was him so under the original marriage covenant he didn't even have the option to divorce her he didn't even have the right to put her away if he would have done it he would have broke the original Covenant himself but under the original Covenant Adam who was in the figure of Christ being faithful to the claws to the law to the life to the power of the original love redeemed her divorce was not in the God's original world it isn't something that God loves God didn't build it into the Covenant because it what what followed is permissive all right that's the that's the mystery of permissive will what God permits what God allows but it was not this wasn't so from the beginning in Malachi 2 14-16 yet you say wherefore because the Lord hath been witnessed between thee and thy wife of thy youth so there's the Divine Covenant against whom thou Hast dealt treacherously yet she is thy companion and the wife of thy Covenant Malachi is speaking to hard hearts and he says the Lord has been a witness with your wife that you're mistreating don't treacherously with wanting to go take other woman put her away take other woman he says she's your companion the wife of thy Covenant and notice and did not he make one God ordained one man then one woman even though he had power to make many this is what brother Brown said in the beginning one man one woman and he's saying this is this is what one man to one woman this is the way it was in the beginning one couple one family he ordained one male one female that he might have as a scripture saying he did not make one yet he had he the residue of the spirit and why one wherefore one that he might seek a Godly seed this is Holy offspring this is the reason why that he did it this way he's talking about that it's that manifestation the three pull threefold purpose of Christ or God in the beginning in the man and the woman so now Malachi when he's writing about men's attitudes towards their wives he goes right back to the beginning when Jesus has talked about marriage and divorce he goes right back to the beginning when Paul goes right back to the beginning you see this theme now it's going back to the original back to the original he says therefore take heed to your spirit let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth for the Lord the god of Israel saith that he hateth putting away he hates divorce God hates divorce for One Cometh violence With His Garment saith the Lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that you deal not Treach your slave because of this image in the beginning in verse 15 God hates divorce it's not in harmony with God's original Covenant like why did God let us have permit us to have a Bill of divorcement why do you let us put away our wives because the hardness of your hearts not because the hardness of his heart not because he's cruel not because he's impatient it's because of you he did it this isn't how God saw things in the beginning God desired one family in agreement in Harmony One flesh one Spirit one life that's how God envisioned it in the beginning so when we read in Ephesians 5 and we start with verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church it just gave himself for it they might sanctify it cleanse it so ought to men to love their wives as their own body and he says and he says that as the Lord the church we are members of his body his bones his flesh this caused shall a man leave his father mother shall be one flesh this is a great mystery I speak of Christ in church he says nevertheless let every one of you in so particular love his wife do you recognize what Paul has done in this instance Paul tells husbands to love their wives under the original Covenant not under the double Covenant he's not he's not looking uh when he says this when he says this he said Christ is the example husband Adam who patterned Christ in Romans 5 14 that there who is in the figure of him that is to come said that husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church the head is the savior the deliverer and the preserver the one that keeps safe and sound the one who uses Tender Care he gives himself over his wife he allows himself to be used for her he sacrifices himself or he's the sanctifier to separate from that profane things to consecrate from things that spoil and harm he is the sanctifier so if there's any profane thing if there's any hurtful thing he consecrates her from the spoil and harm he's a cleanser he sets free from wickedness he guides it from false and mistakes this my brother when Paul is telling husbands to love their wives he points to Christ and and doing so he's also pointing to Adam he says this is how Christ loves the church he's a sanctifier he's a perjury he's a cleanser he's The Giver and he said this is this is what how Christ loves the church he says this is this is how you ought to love under the original Covenant and under the original Covenant it's all it had under the original Covenant there was one condition perfect love unconditional perfect love and so Paul's marriage counseling if I could kind of uh summarize it this way it's not according to Deuteronomy 24. he's not uh turning your Bibles Deuteronomy 21 22 and let's read verse 24 20 chapter 24 he is not counseling according to Deuteronomy 24 or hate but he's actually counting counseling according to Genesis chapter one and two love he's not he's not Counseling in light of hate he's not saying well because hard Hearts I get it I know how this happens I know through time and things just happen and there's misunderstandings and eventually it just kind of breeds contempt and you're no longer happy to be together you know who wants a home like that and besides a woman and you know an angry woman and a railing woman is kind of like a dripping faucet you know better to live in a small house it started pulling from everywhere and said I get it guys come on look just you can leave her he doesn't do that he counsels from Genesis chapter one and two Paul is pointing to and drawing from the original marriage covenant when he says husbands love your wives he's drawing from and and pointing us to the original marriage covenant when he says so love your wives and this is exactly what Jesus did when the issue of divorce came up he quoted the original notice how Paul counsels in First Corinthians chapter 7 verses 10 to 15. I know these scriptures oftentimes raise more questions just in the reading of it but I think there's some things we can take away and under the Mary I command yet not I but the Lord this is the Lord's commandment let not the wife depart from her husband but if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband so it's telling you this is the Lord these are the only options he says and let not the husband put away his wife this is the Lord saying it so we could read this to the Myriad command the other night let not the wife depart from her husband he's not he doesn't want the separation but is she depart she needs to remade unmarried or she can be reconciled to her husband he says but don't let the husband divorce his wife this is not me Paul is saying this is the Lord the husband don't divorce your wife so but to the rest speak I not the Lord if any brother hath the wife that believeth not and she'd be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away don't divorce her and the woman which half a husband that believeth not and if he'd be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him and and I know that if you read that it's pretty explicit that the man is the one that divorces the woman can only leave it says and the unbelieving husband this is why he says this for the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and then believing wife is sancted by by the husband else Where Your Children unclean but now are they are clean Now They Are Holy That's The Power of marriage that's the beauty of marriage so he says but if the unbelieving depart let him depart he says in a brother sister is not under bondage and such such cases but God have called us to peace that there ought not to be any condemnation in the instance that the unbelieving would depart and it happens then you you can have peace God will not lay that to your charge you do not need to be condemned by that Paul is giving being given this great uh privilege to say you can continue as you are don't worry don't live in fear you can go on he's not saying that they're no longer bound uh by that original marriage and by their vows he just says you're not you're not condemned by this so guess what Paul what is he not selling in these verses he's not selling divorce as a solution but he's actually quoting God is saying don't divorce and brother Branham does the same thing he's doing the same thing now this is going to be maybe a an acceleration of thoughts here but if I could say this and I want to prove this statement by the the message brother Brown does the same thing that Paul does the same thing that Christ does that when the issue is raised Christ goes oh we'll go back to the beginning Malachi when he's dealing with the issue goes back to the beginning Paul when he deals with the issue goes back to the beginning brother Brandon when he deals with the issue goes back to the beginning and can I just say this before I go any further isn't it wonderful that that Ministry restores the heart turns the heart away from hardness and harshness and bitterness and selfishness and unkindness that's what this word is supposed to do but after the seals are open we're brought back to in the beginning where it was when he says from the beginning it wasn't so so he's wanting to bring us back to the beginning so whatever that was can be so we were all right I believe we already recognize and see that the original Covenant had been lost that's where the double covenants instituted different covenants exist but when the word is being restored to us the original covenant's being restored amen and the sermon thinking man's filter brother Brown says oh for the grace of God this is in August of 65 that he would give us understand of such great Mysteries and I know we're thinking the the mysteries of you know the the logistics of the mighty angel coming down and the other Mysteries you might think of he says it's Paul spoke here further down in Ephesians speaking of the husband and wife and said this is a mystery how the woman should be in respect to their husband he's identifying the relationship between the man and the woman and the love and the respect that they have for each other as a mystery and I would say oh what a great mystery that's been revealed of the true love and reverence that ought to exist in a marriage in the sermon Third Exodus he says I want to explain the real truth of marriage and divorce it's a question and this is the last hours when all the mysteries of God should be finished so he refers to the the mystery the the understanding of such great Mysteries and he refers to Ephesians 5. now he says the truth of marriage and divorce is part of the mysteries of God that should be finished then in marriage and divorce he says now on the marriage and divorce it has to be revealed until it's revealed you don't know it but he promised in this last days in this age that every hidden Mystery in the Bible would be revealed how many knows that Revelation is the 10th chapter the mystery of one flesh every mystery shall be revealed a marriage and divorce he says he's promised that he the hidden Mystery in the Bible would be revealed and he goes it's Revelation the 10th chapter so Revelations chapter 10 verses 1 through 7 as we could read it and we would see the way it symbolically represented in scripture he's saying that promises to answer the question of marriage and divorce that promise us to give us understanding of this mystery of a woman I've been in respects to her husband and I and what I want to say is I believe at the open of the word I I'm putting it in my words now I believe that at the open of the word the truth of marriage and divorce is being restored that the truth of this great mystery is being restored I believe that at the open of the word we're able to know what that double Covenant is and why it exists but then we're also able to know by Revelation that the original Covenant must be restored and so brother random uses the fridge phrase marriage covenant three times leave all of them after the seals are opened in weddings he says I shall propose to you the marriage covenant and I believe that's exactly what brother Branham was doing from 63 on to 65. I shall propose to you the marriage covenant the revelation of the son of man is a union between Christ and his bride I propose to you the marriage covenant I'm no longer going to call you Church but I'm going to call you bride so that you understand I now propose to you the marriage covenant you're not just one that's been a spouse you're not servant in the double Covenant I'm not proposing to you that you're still in this state of fear I'm trying to get you away from all the fear and scare this is the language that he's using he was a son of man revealing these son of man saying I now propose to you the marriage covenant why the marriage covenant was being confirmed at the open of the seals Christ The Mighty Angel comes down with the Rainbow on his head what is he he's the Covenant angel descending with an open book The Original Covenant that's Revelations 10 1. that's the Revelation the 10th chapter that's the Mysteries part of the Mysteries that are being fulfilled the mighty angel with the rainbow upon his head is the messenger of the unconditional Covenant he's not a messenger of Deuteronomy 24 he's not a messenger of the double Covenant he's not a message of he can she can he's a messenger of the original Covenant and he's restoring to the bride her secret Covenant Billy Brown says the Secret's been made known the seals are opened the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him and He will show them his Covenant the secret of the Lord is with his wife because the mystery is how the wife should be in reverence to her husband to fear her husband that's not the fear that the woman has in Deuteronomy 24 of her husband it's the fear and the the love that the woman would have had in the beginning that respect and that desire that was won and co-equal and he says to my wife to her that fears me I will show my Covenant brother Branham in the sermon marriage and divorce says you've got to come back to the truth to find out what it is it's always been that way that's the regular Covenant with God from the beginning first before the beginning from the beginning there was just one in one are you are you thinking about it think about the implications in this there was just one in one after the sin came in then there was one man and a bunch of women run that way in nature every animal and human beings and natural flesh is animal we're mammal we know that all of us see and it's all God's nature and continuity but now that the seals are opened the spirit of Truth directs us to the word now if we could say this now that the seals are this is the way that it's set in secondarily in nature by sex this is the way that it has been because of the fall but now that the seals are opened we see what the original Covenant was we see the double Covenant and he says the spirit of Truth directs us to the word it's directed us to the beginning it's directed us to how it was in the beginning the spirit of Truth directs us to the word and he says that explains why all the mistakes have been made Through the Ages because the seals was not opened this was not revealed it's true the reason why mistakes are made is because the seals weren't open the reason why people didn't know and didn't understand and went off and did certain things that they did is because the seals were not open this was not revealed and he's saying under the double Covenant there is divorce but under the original Covenant he he clearly tells us on the issue of marriage and divorce in the beginning God instituted marriage there was no divorce it is in the institution of the SEC the double covenants that from then on he said in the second Covenant and now there was double covenants in the fall so in the original Covenant there's no divorce just Redemption under a church covenant there's divorce but under the bright age Covenant under Church age Covenant there's divorce but under the bright age Covenant there's only Redemption [Music] you want to know why we're still here because he can't put us away and try to do something else can't do it why are we still here unconditional unconditional love there why will there not be another age to this why will there not be another cycle why will he not send another Prophet why because he's restored the original marriage covenant and just as Adam did what was necessary to redeem the woman Christ does what's necessary to save his wife in the sermon marriage and divorce he says he could put her away but she cannot put him away he's talking about the church he did it it's proved in the days of Luther Westland Pentecost when they refused to become the further part of him by having spiritual sexual Affair to become pregnant with a further part of the word I know that's a mouthful it's quite quite a statement he's saying he could put Luther Wesley and Pentecost away but upon the restoration of the original marriage covenant something changes he says and so it is with the church that refuses to become pregnant in AIDs that we live in now to bring forth children of this age he says we are not lutherans we are not Wesley's neither are we Pentecostals he puts them away those are the churches under the double Covenant but we are not Luther we are not Wesley we are not Pentecostal we're the bride he says we've got to be the children of this age for the pregnancy of the word of God to bring forth the child of this age the seed of the child do you not see what Christ is doing in the end time he's doing exactly what Adam did he's redeeming us he's keeping us this is the blessing of the original marriage covenant it's unconditional it's what he expresses in Abraham unconditional Abraham I will do this for you Adam if you made a mistake Adam this is what happens he hey he made these conditional covenants but with Abraham he wants to express something Abraham look no matter what you do even if with Hagar it doesn't matter if you doubt you do all these different things you lie you try to save your own life no matter what it doesn't matter I'll make it happen I'm just going to do it doesn't matter and so what does God do in this hour he says we're not lutherans we're not wesleys we're not Pentecostals we're not we are not them and we're not like the woman we're not like Eve why why in this age and this time what is it Christ what is this great mystery Brothers referring to that Paul refers to Christ cannot hate his own flesh he cannot deny her he cannot reject her he cannot look for another one therefore for us as the Bride of Jesus Christ this is perfect love there's no fear of divorce there's no fear of banishment when The Headstone which is Christ which is the heart of God which is the love of God which is perfect love which is Charity when The Headstone has been revealed to us it comes with shines of Grace Grace until we come into the Perfection it's Grace upon Grace until we come into Perfection that we cannot be said of Christ that when he marries you you fall out of favor with her that's why there's an invisible Union you cannot fall out of favor with him it's Grace after Grace after Grace he'll do it until perfect love comes Divine love has been projected Sovereign Grace has taken took its place and it will produce perfect love there is no fear listen you've got to get away from it I want you as individual Believers today for once and for all bury that bull unbelief bury that fear he cannot put you away she couldn't get scared that's what he says about the woman she couldn't get together there's nothing to get scared about she had perfect love and so what what about my first husband he's dead think about all the things that this message is teaching us look at the woman oh but I I made a mistake I was falling I I I've sinned okay I can redeem you that's what's reflected and if I could say this in closing I know you thought it was going to be long I just I wanted to get to Luby's before it closed this is the Covenant that our marriage should be marriages should be under I know that's a that's a mouthful this is the Covenant that our marriages should aspire to not a double Covenant we shouldn't we shouldn't have the sermon marriage and divorced all highlighted in dog-eared and everything kind of saved so that we could come come and say he can she can't what about the other message that's in that what about what about the other image that he can she can't that's because hardness of hearts he can't she can't that's under the that's under the double Covenant this this is this is under the Covenant of hate that's under the Covenant of unfaithfulness but this is the Covenant the original marriage code is the Covenant that our our marriages should aspire to is it not the original marriage covenant that we find ourselves quoting I promise to love to honor cherish and sickness or health richer or poor as long as we both shall live isn't isn't it good that the two shall let what God joined together let no man put us under is the very declaration that's set over us in our marriages ceremonies it's not under Deuteronomy it's it's under the original it's from Ephesians five it's from Genesis one and two it's from The Words of Christ it's from the things that all point us back to the beginning and and and and our marriage come in our marriage vows it's not that uh I promise to be faithful to you until I hate you and then I'm just going to leave you and that would make more sense under the Old Testament makes more sense than the double Covenant we're not even drawing it from even Corinthians where he says you know what if she wants to leave he says well I promise to always remain a Believer if my wife becomes an unbeliever and she doesn't want to live with me then let her depart that's not the vow we give at our wedding day it's all drawn from the original marriage covenant these vows of our marriages that we've all been United under draw from the Covenant in the beginning and it ought to inspire us to perfect love the opening of the seals the opening of the word should completely change our attitudes towards our marriages because I believe that as much as the third pool has this side to it that is mysterious and Rich and deep and pulls from all these different areas and you see even dates and times in numerology shadows and type that there's this whole area of of things that is that oh and I don't want to say anything to diminish it at all because when I hear it preached well I get giddy I love it just the same as you do but the third pool is for the preservation of our marriages for the sanctification of our families that's that's what the third pool is for when he's introducing to us the marriage covenant under under the sermon marriage and divorce he's saying in the beginning it was marriage without divorce the reason why we have marriage and divorce today is because of the fall but now the spirit of Truth directs us to the word now he's restored us back to an Eden condition now the messenger of the Covenant is here reaffirming his love for us he puts us in this state of comfort and no scare no fear if that's what he can do for us if that's what he can do in our own personal lives could it not give us a reservoir of Love could it not give us a reservoir of healing balm for our marriages listen I do not believe I don't care how many years you've been married I don't care how much pain how much in and out how many things have transpired I believe the power of the Redemptive word and I believe in the power of Christ that has been revealed in this end time and it is a power of restoration it is the power of healing it is the power of redemption and there is a perfect love here that can redeem that can restore that can heal and this statement to me just becomes such a an anchor in marriage and divorce he said God gave us a remedy and a way to marry our wives and live with them but God but man won't accept God's remedy won't accept his word on it what does that sound like to you God gave us a remedy and a way to marry our wives and live with them he gives us a remedy and man won't accept God's remedy won't accept God's word on it I know situations are unique I I know that in preaching this even maybe a minister could challenge me and say oh are you saying that we can no longer a wife can no longer be divorced I say the double Covenant is still in effect the double Covenant is still in effect it still exists today and I'm I am not saying that that is closed I'm not changing what brother man taught it stands just the same as it was when he preached it but I want you to recognize the other theme to this sermon God gave us a remedy how to marry our wives and live with them God gave us a remedy to those of us who sit here today who have the privilege of still being married to our wives would you not want to accept the remedy that says no matter what no matter what death will only change our dwelling no matter what I'm with you to the end no matter what I'll stick this out because God gives us a remedy and I believe that there's so much pointing there's so much misunderstanding the sermon and I'm I have not I trust by God's grace that you could you could say Amen to this I have not changed anything that brother Branham taught I have not annulled it I have not disqualified I haven't taken anything away from it I am merely pointing out more of what he taught that there's another side to this that perhaps we miss sometimes and listen to how brother Bradham says it paragraph 312. at to the end in marriage and divorce I'm just going to read this to you I hope that this could anchor in your hearts I hope that you could hear this to me it is one of the most anointed moments in brother Brown's Ministry that when you listen to it there is such a divine inspiration there is such a pulsating to the heart of God and to think that his brother Branham says there he was in Tucson below finger rock on that pill call him a fire coming up and down witnessed by people and their God is giving him this and he's seeing something and he's not just being taken and God is not the angel Lord is just not saying well over here it says this and over here it says that I believe that God did is he gave him he opened up around where he entered into the original marriage covenant and he enters into that Divine favor he enters into that love and he recognizes something that's Eternal Without End and when he senses that and feels that I know I'm just dramatized this when he sees that it brings such a stark contrast to the divorce that exists today and all the subsequent issues that come down to it and so when God gave this sermon to brother Branham it was not to attack the two schools of thought he's saying they both have some truth but they're both wrong he says we don't want to go Southeast we don't want to go northeast we want to go due east he was warning us to get the truth of it and I if I could say this not just to know why things are messed up but know how we can't or why how we'll never mess up he wants us to know how to stay out of a mess he says it wasn't so from the beginning but Moses permitted it and God recognized its righteousness Paul also had a right when he found this church in that condition now you believe this to be true and believe it to come from God and by the Vindication of his cloud and his message that's brought me this far should God upon that mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more go with your wives and live in peace for the hours late the coming of the Lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up and listen to what he says don't you dare try to do it again I'm speaking only to my congregation but if you're married God bore me witness of that on the mountain that I could say this a supernatural Revelation because of the open of the seals this is a question in God's word let them go in as they are and sin no more it wasn't so from the beginning what was it in the beginning what did Adam do in the beginning what does that tell us as his bride in the beginning what does that tell us as spouses in the beginning in the beginning it wasn't he can she can't in the beginning it wasn't just separation in the beginning it was Redemption so he says that's right it wasn't so and it'll not be at the end but under modern conditions as God's servant I won't call myself his Prophet but I believe maybe if I wouldn't be sent for that I'm laying a ground for him that when he does come and he says some things very particular to that the beginning so under the modern conditions I command you to go to your home with your wife now if you are happy with her live with her raise your children in the admonition of God but God be merciful to you if you ever do that again and he says you teach your children to never do such a thing like that bring them up in the admonition of God I believe that we ought to teach a different standard to our children that we want to raise our young men to love their wives as Christ loves the church not in the image of the Unfaithful men that have perverted the message it made it a a kajal made it a stick to beat up the church made in a stick to beat up the woman but have perfect love teach your children to never do such a thing like that bring them up in the admonition of God and now that you are as you are let us go now at the late evening hour that we're living in impressed toward the mark of the high calling in Christ where all things are possible don't you believe all things are possible I thank God for the grace that's extended in this to give a Grace and to declare righteousness on situations that are that are permitted by God that may not make that still line up under the double Covenant but I thank God that Grace teaches us the original Covenant and that we can be inspired to a higher love and a greater love than to instinctively reach for a double Covenant and as God is restoring the hearts of his children to his heart the reason for the double Covenant changing is is is going away he said in a new nature but now that the Oneness has come again it comes back to a single Covenant I know at the very least I've given you a lot to think about could we stand together today
