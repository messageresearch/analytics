[0:00] going to continue on the subject of hate
[0:02] and the question I'm asking today is our
[0:04] title is where's the trust there'll be a
[0:08] lot of similarities with the subject
[0:10] matter on Wednesday night on where's the
[0:12] confidence and I I think those two uh
[0:15] words could be used interchangeably as a
[0:17] matter of fact in the Old Testament
[0:18] sometimes it's translated to trust
[0:19] sometimes confidence but I wanted to
[0:21] take it from a little bit of a different
[0:23] uh just a little bit further angle today
[0:25] so this is a question we're posing is
[0:27] where's the Trust on this subject of
[0:29] hate been using different definitions to
[0:32] uh kind of work out what we're meaning
[0:33] when we talk about hate uh something
[0:36] that's kind of settled in my heart in
[0:37] terms of expressing it a particular way
[0:39] is it's when someone or something
[0:41] becomes an enemy we've been saying an
[0:43] intense negative emotional response to
[0:45] someone or something but it's kind of
[0:49] good to think it in terms of not just
[0:51] saying you don't like a vegetable or you
[0:53] hate something uh you know I hate to be
[0:56] long- winded this morning and that's
[0:57] kind of just a term that we use and we
[1:00] say it but we're not really uh detesting
[1:02] in it it's not real a real visceral
[1:04] reaction but when we're talking about
[1:06] hate it's very specific and The more
[1:08] I've studied it the more I've come to
[1:10] realize that this this type of hate is
[1:13] very rare and that sometimes we just use
[1:16] the phrase and we use it so often a lot
[1:17] of times it's kind of thrown out there
[1:19] though that's hate and this is hate and
[1:20] it happens so often that we really miss
[1:22] the true uh depth of just how evil hate
[1:25] is I believe it was Aristotle that
[1:27] defined it in the sense that it's an
[1:29] emot or a feeling or a desire that uh
[1:33] something or someone would cease to
[1:35] exist and you don't care how that
[1:37] happens and and so that's a very intense
[1:40] strong desire to where you would want it
[1:42] to uh cease to exist rather than just
[1:44] merely suffer and so that's a it's a
[1:47] real strong emotion and I realize that
[1:49] that when we talk about hate we might
[1:51] experience feelings and we might
[1:52] attribute it to hate and The more I've
[1:54] studied this the more I've realized that
[1:56] hate um is a very rare thing at its core
[1:59] in terms of really hating something if
[2:00] you asked me do you hate this or do you
[2:03] hate that uh and I said could ask maybe
[2:06] today do any of you hate anyone some of
[2:09] you might find it very very hard to
[2:10] think of anyone that you actually truly
[2:13] hate that you'd want them to cease to
[2:15] exist and we're not just talking about
[2:16] the starting quarterback on the fantasy
[2:18] team that you're facing this weekend
[2:20] where you wouldn't want them to play or
[2:21] be inactive we're talking about real
[2:23] true genuine I don't want them just to
[2:26] suffer I want them to cease to exist and
[2:27] it doesn't matter to me how that happens
[2:29] you'd find that hate maybe is very rare
[2:31] and you might feel like you've never
[2:32] actually truly hated your whole life but
[2:34] yet today I want to touch on some things
[2:36] in a way to realize that there's a way
[2:38] that the devil's trying to synthesize
[2:40] that there's a way the world tries to
[2:42] provoke that and use these emotions and
[2:44] it still has this effect this costic of
[2:46] impacting Us in very deep ways and we've
[2:48] seen that already uh in the scripture
[2:52] and it's important for us to take these
[2:53] things in mind uh through these first uh
[2:56] four or five Services we've looked at it
[2:58] from or four Services we looked looked
[2:59] at it in terms of hate being the
[3:02] opposite of or the enemy of love and
[3:05] peace and strength and confidence and
[3:07] that where those things are and they
[3:10] exist uh they're a buffer against hate
[3:13] and they keep hate in check and they
[3:14] keep it away and they drive away its
[3:16] negative effects but where uh these
[3:19] things no longer exist or where hate
[3:21] drives them away uh or they lose
[3:23] preeminence we find ourselves subject to
[3:25] emotions and we can find ourselves
[3:27] subject to hate when you stop loving you
[3:30] you're subject to hate when hate enters
[3:32] in peace leaves and often times we're
[3:34] hating because we're not confident and
[3:36] we don't have that kind of strength
[3:37] picking us up we could put it in terms
[3:40] of kind of being in the flesh where we
[3:41] get get angry and we get certain
[3:43] emotions start uh thriving and then we
[3:45] get hateful or being in the spirit where
[3:48] we we're channeling our energy we have
[3:50] our uh emotions subject to the word of
[3:52] God something I've learned in terms of
[3:55] uh emotions is that we're subject to
[3:58] them we're emotional beings we're emot
[3:59] creatures and there's going to be
[4:01] frustration and there's going to be
[4:02] disappointment and so it's not sinful to
[4:05] be disappointed but it would be sinful
[4:07] to allow your disappointment to have
[4:08] preeminence it's maybe not sinful to
[4:11] experience certain emotions uh but yet
[4:13] when those have the preeminence in
[4:15] you're Guided by them that's when we're
[4:17] led into air and so we want the Holy
[4:18] Spirit to have preeminence in all things
[4:21] now if you look at James chapter 5 verse
[4:24] 9 this will pick up on a lot of the
[4:25] things we're speaking about Wednesday
[4:27] night and as we go forward recognized I
[4:30] think we dealt with the origin of hate
[4:33] uh in the beginning how it's attributed
[4:34] to Satan we see it manifested in Cain
[4:37] and we're we've understood the nature of
[4:40] hate how it's corrosive it's a cancer it
[4:42] weakens us it deprives us of strength
[4:44] and life and we're looking at more and
[4:47] more how hate starts and why it begins
[4:49] to start and then also how to overcome
[4:51] it and I think you'll see those themes
[4:53] in these things today and so we're
[4:55] asking where's the Trust In James 5:9 it
[4:59] says Grudge not against another Brethren
[5:02] lest you be condemned behold the judge
[5:05] standeth before the door to Grudge is to
[5:08] find fault with it's to uh not only to
[5:11] find fault with but on the basis of that
[5:14] fault or offense or disagreement you
[5:15] wish to deprive them or you're of
[5:18] something or you're angry at them and so
[5:21] in James when he's writing this The
[5:23] Grudge comes from kind of a reasonable
[5:25] position you've been defrauded you've
[5:27] been taken advantage of you've been
[5:28] manipulated you wor and you didn't get
[5:30] paid and so he makes reference in these
[5:32] first several verses of bad things
[5:34] happening to an individual that would
[5:36] cause you to wish ill or harm or be
[5:39] angry at another and he says don't
[5:41] Grudge don't maintain these feelings of
[5:44] anger and bitterness and resentment
[5:46] towards someone for something done and I
[5:50] think it would make sense if someone
[5:51] says well whatever you do don't hate
[5:52] that person you're like I don't know him
[5:53] never met them they've never done
[5:55] anything to me that would kind of be an
[5:56] easy ask but it's when the man who who
[5:59] owned the field who promised you $1,000
[6:02] if you if you harvested the crops in
[6:04] that field and you did it you delivered
[6:06] everything and you did your job in the
[6:07] end he says well you can go ahead and
[6:08] keep a couple ears of corn uh for your
[6:10] work and you don't get paid he's saying
[6:12] don't be angry don't be resentful don't
[6:14] be grudging to Grudge in the Bible in
[6:18] the Old Testament it's to keep in mind
[6:20] and keep in memory an offense that's
[6:22] been done with the desire that you would
[6:25] seek revenge or that you would return
[6:27] the deed and the Very word kind of has
[6:29] this meaning to retain hatred that if
[6:32] you Grudge you're holding your hatred if
[6:35] you Grudge you're putting it in a safe
[6:37] place and you're going to keep it there
[6:38] until a time when you could really use
[6:40] it and so there's a lot that's
[6:42] referenced in this to say whatever you
[6:44] do don't retain hatred don't Grudge
[6:46] don't be angry or resentful and the
[6:49] resentment and bitterness and grudging
[6:51] as the Bible refers to it here we can
[6:52] even say envy and jealousy these are all
[6:55] precursors of hate to where if you begin
[6:58] to hold some of these they can work
[7:00] their way into that intense negative
[7:03] emotional response to where now it's not
[7:05] that you want to return the deed but you
[7:07] just wish they would cease to exist and
[7:09] you don't care how that happens and it
[7:11] all starts with some of these feelings
[7:13] or you could have hate and it manifests
[7:15] itself in resentment and bitterness and
[7:17] jealousy and envy he says Grudge not
[7:20] lest you be condemned that condemnation
[7:23] comes because hate causes damage hate is
[7:26] something that will uh cause uh hold uh
[7:30] will impair our judgment it'll it drain
[7:33] us of of of positive uh thoughts and and
[7:36] good emotions and so it's a cancer is
[7:39] how we referred to it so holding on to
[7:41] resentment and holding on to bitterness
[7:43] is painful it's harmful and sometimes we
[7:46] think we're hurting because of what's
[7:47] been done to us but actually what's
[7:49] hurting is the hate you're holding on to
[7:51] because of what's been done and say man
[7:53] I'm miserable and and I can't this
[7:55] happened and that happened it's because
[7:57] this happened because that happens more
[7:58] because you're you're not letting it go
[8:00] the more you hold on to offense the more
[8:02] it's kind of hurting you and the more
[8:03] that it's dragging you down and the more
[8:05] that it has power over you that's the
[8:07] beauty of forgiveness when youever you
[8:09] offend uh forgive the offender they
[8:12] they've lost their power over you people
[8:14] who try to victimize you or harm you or
[8:16] hurt you and they do things to tear you
[8:18] down and H and uh to to belittle you the
[8:22] more you hold on to that the more they
[8:23] continue to harm you the more they have
[8:25] power over you but as soon as you can
[8:27] truly forgive them in your heart they've
[8:28] lost all power over you and so by
[8:32] yielding to a spirit of anger by
[8:33] yielding to a spirit of hate you the
[8:36] Bible's saying Grudge not lest you be
[8:38] condemned you come under the
[8:39] condemnation of the
[8:42] wicked in Proverbs chap 26: 211 this
[8:45] will review a little bit from last
[8:46] Sunday I think is coals are to burning
[8:48] coals in wood to fire what is that
[8:51] fuel when you had wood toile that uh to
[8:53] fire that's a a source to consume to
[8:56] build energy so is a contentious man to
[8:59] to Kindle Strife hate is a fuel it
[9:03] incites Wicked passions it kind of
[9:05] encourages us to evil thoughts it
[9:07] motivates uh these carnal actions uh uh
[9:11] overt actions that relate to hate or
[9:13] bitterness or resent being resentful
[9:15] where if you're jealous of somebody and
[9:17] they say and they express something to
[9:19] you say well do I'm thinking about
[9:21] buying this uh this tie and if a
[9:23] Brother's jealous of that brother he
[9:25] might say oh no that's an ugly tie I
[9:27] wouldn't buy it everyone will think
[9:29] you're goofy and he's like oh thanks for
[9:31] looking out for me and then you buy it
[9:34] guys do this all the time right yeah
[9:36] don't wear that fit that's ugly and
[9:38] because you're jealous maybe it's not
[9:40] the guys maybe it's others that do stuff
[9:43] like that but it motivates us to carnal
[9:46] actions this jealousy and uh hatred it's
[9:49] it's a it's a fuel that's why the Bible
[9:52] says in Ephesians chapter 4 verses 26
[9:55] and
[9:56] 27 and and I will I was going to say
[9:58] this at the said I didn't didn't write
[10:00] it down or anything to uh Express this I
[10:04] I feel like I can really deliver my
[10:05] burden on this subject today so if you
[10:08] really pull hard and you smile why I
[10:10] preach and you get behind it maybe we
[10:12] could leave the subject of hate behind
[10:13] and go into other themes uh for the
[10:15] remainder of the year but there's just a
[10:17] lot here I feel like I'm going to be
[10:18] able to get out today and I'll be happy
[10:20] to move on from this but Ephesians
[10:22] chapter 4: 26- 27 it says be angry and
[10:26] sin not I'm wanting us to recogniz
[10:30] how the Bible is warning us against
[10:32] these intense negative emotional
[10:36] responses to someone or something be
[10:38] angry and sin not let not the sun go
[10:41] down upon your wrath neither give place
[10:44] to the devil so there's something about
[10:47] allowing anger to Fester something about
[10:49] allowing wrath to continue to exist
[10:52] that's going to give place to the devil
[10:55] and he's dealing with uh being provoked
[10:57] to anger where you're agitated and there
[10:58] something something that happens where
[10:59] there's this impulse and this instinct
[11:01] to be angry at something or be mad about
[11:04] something and it's implying to us that
[11:08] there's a difference well let me say
[11:10] this there's a difference between anger
[11:12] and hate and maybe that's a distinction
[11:14] for the philosophers but there is a dis
[11:16] a difference and it's telling us that
[11:19] you can be angry and not
[11:20] sin so there is though anger is not
[11:23] sinful there's a danger in it becoming
[11:26] sin if it's not addressed because it
[11:28] says be angry and sin not and then how
[11:31] is it say well how do I not sin don't
[11:32] give place to the devil don't let the
[11:34] sun go down upon your wrath so it's
[11:36] saying if you don't address the anger if
[11:38] you don't address the cause and it's not
[11:41] something that you're directly
[11:42] addressing then it can lead you to sin
[11:46] because anger can grow into hate once it
[11:48] grows into hate it it inflames
[11:50] vindictiveness and Vengeance and some of
[11:52] those other things that we've looked at
[11:54] so when it says be angry and sin not it
[11:57] allows for anger but it's saying don't
[11:59] allow this emotion to fester and lead
[12:02] you into sin or to miss the Mark or to
[12:05] wander away from righteousness because
[12:07] of that
[12:08] anger so we can say a again anger itself
[12:11] is not sin but it can produce hatred
[12:15] produce malice and bitterness and even
[12:17] revengeful feelings I think one
[12:21] translation rendered it this way or a
[12:23] commenter said he that will be angry and
[12:25] not sin let him be angry at nothing but
[12:27] sin I like that because that projects
[12:30] our what our hatred ought to be to is to
[12:32] evil and and if we love God then we hate
[12:35] sin and if we're going to be angry and
[12:37] not sin then be angry only at sin and
[12:41] when it says let not the sun go down on
[12:43] your wrath resist those
[12:46] irritations uh the mulling over and and
[12:49] turning things up to where it kind of
[12:51] exasperates you a little bit and that
[12:53] feeding that will turn anger into hate
[12:55] Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath
[12:58] because that just continues to fuel and
[13:00] continues to swell up these emotions and
[13:02] it can lead you to a place which is a
[13:04] deeper more resentful
[13:06] feeling neither give place to the devil
[13:10] I like to say it this way neither give
[13:11] place to
[13:13] hate because the devil wants to
[13:15] influence your mind he wants to irritate
[13:17] your spirits we really should look at
[13:18] everything the devil's doing as just a
[13:20] game he he's constantly trolling us
[13:23] right he's just wanting to trigger us
[13:24] he's just wanting us to get mad he's
[13:25] he's just trying to stir you up and by
[13:27] any means necessary doesn't really
[13:29] matter to him necessarily what you do
[13:31] and what's happening if he could just
[13:33] stir you up if he could just get you
[13:34] agitated and a lot of times we we look
[13:37] at certain things that happen in our
[13:38] lives and we can be very disappointed in
[13:40] ourselves in something that we we have
[13:42] said or done or something said or done
[13:44] to us and if you could just look at it
[13:46] and realize that's that wasn't his endg
[13:49] game that's his tactic to upset you and
[13:52] not be upset and turned aside by it then
[13:55] you kind of diffuse the devil's program
[13:57] from the beginning
[13:59] so he wants to influence us away
[14:02] influence us away from that steadiness
[14:05] that
[14:06] constancy and it's when our faith is
[14:08] disconnected from the word that we're
[14:11] provoked to act on these emotions and
[14:14] the things of the
[14:15] flesh now in Proverbs chapter 8 verse 13
[14:20] I think we've reviewed there'll still be
[14:22] a little bit from psalms 27 but I think
[14:24] there a lot of kind of new things in
[14:26] there but hopefully a lot of review so
[14:28] that are kind of all standing in the
[14:29] same spot to take steps together forward
[14:32] hate if I could Define it this way it's
[14:34] that extreme hostility and it stems from
[14:37] something it can stem from harm it stems
[14:41] from uh uh anger as we just addressed
[14:43] but then it also comes from fear and
[14:46] this is something I want to us to look
[14:49] at this lack of trust in Proverbs 88:13
[14:52] the fear of the Lord is to hate evil
[14:55] pride and arrogancy in the evil way and
[14:57] the forward mouth do I hate one of the
[15:00] often missed instigators to hate is fear
[15:04] and here it says the fear of the Lord is
[15:06] to hate evil this fear that's spoken of
[15:09] is this respect and reverence to God
[15:11] it's kind of and this respect and
[15:13] reverence of God as it's used here the
[15:15] fear of the Lord I'm in awe of God I
[15:17] reverence God I have this respect for
[15:19] God and that fear or reverence is
[15:21] demonstrated in a trust it's
[15:23] demonstrated in a confidence in God and
[15:26] this kind of fear that's spoken of here
[15:28] is a different fear from this worldly
[15:31] fear of dread or to be terrified when it
[15:34] says to fear the lord to fear the lord
[15:36] is to hate evil there is emotions of
[15:39] fear that are not like that fear as Adam
[15:42] in the garden said I heard your voice
[15:43] and I was afraid God's not like good it
[15:46] was the wrong kind of fear it's when God
[15:49] God appeared to Abraham he said fear not
[15:51] Abram so there's these disconcerting
[15:53] emotions of fear that are not good and
[15:56] it's impossible to hate evil truly hate
[15:59] evil without first loving good because
[16:02] fearing God leads to hating evil fearing
[16:05] God and reverencing God will lead when
[16:07] you have that kind of fear it leads to
[16:09] the right kind of hate where I hate
[16:11] every false way the more I fear your
[16:13] word the more I fear displeasing you the
[16:15] more I fear you God the more I hate evil
[16:18] so there's this counterpart to where
[16:20] fear this right kind of reverence is
[16:23] producing the right kind of hate now if
[16:25] we just invert that the wrong to fear
[16:29] this ter Terror or dread leads to an
[16:31] evil hate because we'll hate the thing
[16:35] that we're afraid of we'll hate what we
[16:37] don't trust when you dread something
[16:40] when God appeared to Abram he says fear
[16:42] not Abram I don't want you to be uneasy
[16:44] around me I don't want you to fear me
[16:47] because we will eventually I think it's
[16:48] even Shakespeare that writes it he says
[16:50] in time H uh in time I think it's the
[16:53] the the assistant to Cleopatra and and
[16:56] is it Cleopatra and Anthony I can't
[16:58] remember what it is where it says Hey in
[16:59] time you end up hating the thing you
[17:01] fear and when you're afraid of something
[17:03] you're afraid the way someone's going to
[17:04] act you're afraid of what someone's
[17:06] going to say you're afraid of how
[17:07] someone's going to be around you
[17:08] eventually you don't look forward to it
[17:10] and it leads to these intense feelings
[17:12] of I don't even want them to be around I
[17:14] hate this I hate that I I detest it I
[17:16] don't want to be around it and so God is
[17:18] immediately addressing that with Abram
[17:20] saying fear not Abram because the more
[17:21] you dread the quicker the more it'll
[17:24] lead you into a place of wanting
[17:26] something to cease to exist
[17:29] so the Bible as we've read already it
[17:31] says Grudge not one against another
[17:33] behold the judge standeth before the
[17:36] door it's wanting to turn our trust
[17:39] around that if we have the wrong kind of
[17:42] fear and we have the these other
[17:44] feelings and emotions that are leading
[17:46] us to this dark place or this bad place
[17:48] in our mind and our emotions and whether
[17:50] it be Melancholy or depression or just
[17:52] anxiety and fear and for boing or
[17:54] whatever these feelings emotional
[17:55] feelings might be there's a lot of
[17:57] applications in other areas he's saying
[17:59] don't Grudge the judges here so taking
[18:03] you away from The Grudge and the
[18:05] grudging he's telling behold the judge
[18:07] standeth at the door and that's not to
[18:09] remind us that there's a price to pay
[18:11] and he's going to punish you if you
[18:12] Grudge it's to remind us that there's
[18:13] one watching there's one you can trust
[18:17] and this was our emphasis Wednesday
[18:18] night is that there where's our
[18:20] confidence when bad things happen to us
[18:23] where is our confidence when we get all
[18:24] angry and agitated and we want to be
[18:26] vengeful and we want to even the score
[18:28] where's our confidence that God said
[18:30] I'll take care of it I'm watching out
[18:33] even over this to make sure that it
[18:35] works together for your good in my glory
[18:37] so there's a certain rest that we have
[18:39] in knowing that the judge is at the door
[18:42] there's one watching there's one that
[18:43] knows that we can trust and so it's the
[18:46] fear of the one who's at the door that
[18:49] is what we should trust in this is what
[18:51] David brings us to in Psalms 27 we'll
[18:54] read verses 1 to3 the Lord is my light
[18:56] and my salvation because of that Whom
[18:59] Shall I Fear no one nothing the Lord is
[19:03] the strength of my life of whom shall I
[19:05] be afraid he's identifying these
[19:08] emotions of fear and being afraid and
[19:10] saying why should I fear in light of him
[19:14] why should I allow myself to be
[19:15] distressed and and uh vanquished and
[19:19] drained of life and and forboding and
[19:22] always on edge and nervous and anxious
[19:24] of things when he's here and I mean and
[19:27] he takes it to be very descriptive
[19:29] because you're thinking yeah I mean if
[19:31] you're there in a palace and you know
[19:32] you're being taken care of and
[19:34] everyone's just waiting on you and
[19:35] whatever you want giving you what you
[19:37] need that's great but then he says when
[19:38] the wicked even my enemies my foes Came
[19:41] Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled
[19:43] and
[19:44] fell this is this is a strength and a
[19:47] comfort that he has not just when you're
[19:49] hiding behind the walls in a palace and
[19:52] you're the king and there's armies that
[19:53] will defend you but he's saying it's
[19:55] even in times when the enemy has
[19:57] compassed me
[19:58] and has the advantage on me but God who
[20:01] looked out over me he stopped their
[20:04] plans says no h should encamp against me
[20:07] my heart shall not fear so it's not a
[20:10] rest and an ease that you have because
[20:12] the situation is obviously Peaceable but
[20:14] he said even when those that hate me are
[20:17] very near me and a host should encamp
[20:19] against me my heart shall not fear the
[20:22] war should Rise Against Me hatred comes
[20:25] to my doorstep offenses and injuries are
[20:27] buffering in me constantly in this will
[20:30] I be confident what what are you
[20:31] confident in this will I feel safe in
[20:34] this will I feel secure in this will I
[20:37] be
[20:38] bold that the Lord is my light the Lord
[20:41] is my
[20:43] salvation I'll say it this way when
[20:46] we're not confident in the right thing
[20:48] it leads to the wrong kind of
[20:50] hate when we're confident in the right
[20:52] thing we hate evil when we're trus in
[20:54] the right thing we hate every Wicked way
[20:56] but when we're not trusting in the right
[20:58] thing it leads to the wrong kind of hate
[21:01] when David says now my head will be
[21:03] lifted up above my enemies it's saying
[21:05] that we ought to as David was able to
[21:07] live above the Warfare live above the
[21:09] host that's encamped itself against you
[21:11] hatred found itself at his doorstep and
[21:13] he didn't stoop to its level he said he
[21:16] set me up upon a rock to where we've got
[21:17] to learn to live above the Hate by
[21:20] trusting in the Lord amen not trusting
[21:22] in the flesh not trusting in our schemes
[21:25] and our conniving to where we could
[21:26] figure out a way to even the score and
[21:28] defend ourselves and get ahead of the
[21:30] story and get our claim out there
[21:32] telling us the Bible tell us don't trust
[21:34] in the flesh don't trust in yourself
[21:36] don't trust in your own schemes because
[21:38] when you're doing that you know deep
[21:40] down inside that you're no match for
[21:42] this on your
[21:45] own and so it doesn't produce feelings
[21:47] of fear the only way or comfort and
[21:50] Faith it only produces fear and the only
[21:52] way it doesn't produce fear is if you're
[21:54] absolutely
[21:55] deceived and that's just going to lead
[21:57] to failure
[21:59] the Bible says in Hebrews 13:5 let your
[22:01] conversation your life be without
[22:05] covetousness and be content with such
[22:07] things as you have for Heath said I will
[22:10] never leave thee nor forsake
[22:13] thee wanting to use this scripture to
[22:16] point to the judge standeth at the door
[22:18] and how David said the Lord is my light
[22:20] and my salvation the Lord is the
[22:21] strength of my life and he's and he's
[22:23] saying though War rise against me though
[22:25] host encamp itself about me I'm
[22:27] confident
[22:28] here Paul instructing the Hebrews let
[22:30] your conversation be without
[22:32] covetousness and he's talking about the
[22:33] love of money that's what the word there
[22:36] refers to and This Love of Money leads
[22:39] to that average that
[22:40] greediness and that greediness leads to
[22:43] this lack of Happiness as he says be
[22:46] content if you love money if you love if
[22:49] you value possessions if you value
[22:51] Prestige or popularity or clout it leads
[22:55] to be greedy for these things that give
[22:57] some sort of status and he says it'll
[22:58] lack it'll lead you to a place where
[23:00] there's a lack of happiness and
[23:02] ultimately to a place of covetousness in
[23:04] the sense of jealousy because you love
[23:07] money you'll be jealous of those that
[23:09] have money because you want a certain
[23:12] status you're going to be envious and
[23:14] jealous of those who have the very thing
[23:16] that you want and so there's this
[23:18] Instinct of comparing when you love
[23:20] something who has what you love who has
[23:22] the thing you desire and there's always
[23:24] this comparison there some there's this
[23:27] uh
[23:28] Instinct inside of us I I think I'm
[23:30] dealing very deeply with a lot of uh
[23:33] Humanity in the subject matter to where
[23:36] you you could be given something and it
[23:38] might repeat itself time and time again
[23:40] as families start to celebrate Christmas
[23:41] so the last two weeks and you open gifts
[23:44] and you open a gift and you're like wow
[23:46] thank you this is awesome and you're
[23:48] genuinely happy until your brother opens
[23:50] his gift it's
[23:52] like what you got him that and this is
[23:55] all I got I hate this
[23:58] hey and just the second before
[24:00] everything was cool and everything was
[24:02] great you're the best mom thank you so
[24:04] much this is exactly what I wanted this
[24:06] is the best Christmas ever I don't even
[24:07] need to open another gift wait what
[24:10] because it's just something in our heart
[24:12] sometimes that we're happy with what we
[24:13] have until we see what somebody else
[24:16] has all right so think about that while
[24:18] you're
[24:19] buying it certainly is a trap CU you got
[24:22] such a disparity in ages sometimes like
[24:24] well we're buying him a car we probably
[24:26] should buy Jack a car right
[24:28] I mean we don't want him to be
[24:30] jealous I just gave it
[24:33] away I bought I bought Elliot of
[24:37] Tesla I tried to buy it from Micah but
[24:40] he all the things I've said about
[24:42] electric vehicles haven't been
[24:43] registered so we'll keep
[24:46] trying but this
[24:49] covetousness resolves itself to say be
[24:52] content with what you
[24:53] have and then notice what the basis for
[24:56] not fearing
[24:59] the protection from this jealousy or or
[25:01] hate the the protection from
[25:03] covetousness and kind of the secret to
[25:05] contentment is his
[25:08] presence he doesn't just say well don't
[25:11] be Petty don't be jealous don't always
[25:13] be trivializing being upset and trifling
[25:15] about this and he's not just telling us
[25:17] and then kind of moving on and we're
[25:19] kind of like okay I guess I'm just not
[25:21] going to be jealous he's saying don't be
[25:23] jealous I'm with you I've got this I'll
[25:27] never leave you nor forsake you and
[25:28] listen that's not just a you should just
[25:30] be happy I'm here kind of thing he's
[25:32] saying I got this I'm with you I'm for
[25:37] you I'll take care of you I know what
[25:39] you need he's not just saying you know
[25:42] yeah you're broke but at least be happy
[25:44] you're not alone he say I'm The Giver
[25:46] here I'm the provider I'm the one that
[25:48] knows what you really need so it's not
[25:51] empty but his presence is so so full of
[25:54] so much promise like think of the wealth
[25:56] that you have in my presence think of
[25:58] the provision you have in my presence
[26:00] think about the protection and the
[26:01] pleasure that you have in my provision
[26:03] it it it's preeminent over all other
[26:07] things so the reason why we shouldn't
[26:09] covet the reason why we shouldn't fear
[26:11] is David is telling us is his presence
[26:14] The Secret of his presence he'll hide
[26:16] me as the psalmist says in Psalm 563
[26:19] what time I am afraid I will trust in
[26:22] thee when I'm afraid when I'm feeling
[26:25] this when I experience these emotions
[26:27] and I'm unsettled and I'm nervous and
[26:29] I'm worried and I'm anxious about the
[26:31] future whatever it might be if it's a
[26:32] decision if it's a diagnosis it's if a
[26:35] change of the year if it's a bonus or
[26:37] layoffs are coming whatever it might be
[26:39] in your life and whatever struggle you
[26:40] might be going through at what time I am
[26:42] am afraid this ought to be an instinct
[26:45] within us as Believers when I feel that
[26:47] emotion of fear I want to trust the
[26:50] Lord and what time I am afraid I will
[26:54] feel safe and secure in him amen isn't
[26:57] is that beautiful it's not even telling
[26:59] us at what time you're afraid you don't
[27:01] have the Lord at what time you're afraid
[27:03] the Lord's left you at what time you're
[27:04] afraid you better find God it says in
[27:07] it's that's when he pays off I think we
[27:09] were talking about in this series in
[27:11] perfect love it's it says perfect love
[27:13] cast out fear it doesn't mean that if
[27:15] you have fear you don't have perfect
[27:16] love it's that that's when perfect love
[27:18] pays off it just means your your faith
[27:21] hasn't been made perfect Your Love
[27:23] hasn't been made perfect it just means
[27:25] I'm still here doing what I'm supposed
[27:26] to do and until you come to this place
[27:28] of a perfect peace when I'm afraid I'll
[27:31] trust in thee and if we can be led away
[27:34] from trust in the Lord into fear fear of
[27:38] anything than hatreds
[27:40] nearby at what time I am afraid if
[27:42] there's an object of your fear if you
[27:45] don't trust in the Lord then in time
[27:49] they say time can deal with anger but
[27:50] not so with hate if you if you still
[27:54] hold this fear you'll end up hating the
[27:57] thing you're afraid of that fear that
[28:00] dread that Terror it breeds hatred it
[28:03] breeds
[28:04] hostility why do people have a fear of
[28:09] snakes or why do people hate snakes
[28:12] because they're fear of snakes right
[28:15] there's something you hate you know why
[28:16] do you hate that like I don't know just
[28:19] thought I'd hate it so why do you hate
[28:21] that well it bit
[28:22] me or I've been told they hurt or it'll
[28:25] kill me and so people hate things that
[28:28] they've had a negative experience with
[28:30] or that they that they are afraid of
[28:31] that's why we have this fear is because
[28:33] there's some sort of threat or some
[28:36] perceived threat I was thinking about it
[28:38] this past week you know really nobody
[28:40] really hates the
[28:42] underdog right why nobody's afraid of
[28:46] them I mean why don't you hate the team
[28:48] that's 0 and 14 why is nobody afraid of
[28:50] the Wombats and their fantasy league
[28:52] they're the underdog right nothing's
[28:54] going to happen but when there's
[28:56] somebody that's good or a Powerhouse or
[28:59] blue blood or whatever the terminology
[29:00] is use as opposed to an underdog the
[29:02] favorite people will hate the favorite
[29:04] why do you hate them they're the
[29:05] favorite why do you hate them they're
[29:08] undefeated and there's hate when there's
[29:10] a perceived threat that they can beat
[29:11] you that they can turn your season
[29:13] around or they could beat you up but the
[29:15] the little guy the underdog he's
[29:17] lovable right they go you're just so
[29:19] cute how can anybody hate you we love
[29:22] the underdog because there's no threat
[29:25] we're not subject to loss we're not
[29:26] afraid of them so I wanting you to think
[29:28] in very realistic terms of why we hate
[29:31] because there's a perceived threat or
[29:36] fear when David said in this will I be
[29:38] confident he said in this will I
[29:41] trust this is the image I was hoping to
[29:43] leave you with on Wednesday night it's
[29:45] where I want to come now as we kind of
[29:46] turn the corner a little bit in this
[29:48] will I trust I'm going to look beyond
[29:50] the offense I'm going to look beyond the
[29:53] offender and I'm going to see the
[29:56] judge I'm going to look beyond the host
[29:58] that it's encamped against me I'm going
[30:00] to see him who's with me I'm going to
[30:02] look beyond the pain and the memory and
[30:04] the scars and all these other threats
[30:06] and the Fe fear of the enemy at what
[30:08] time I'm afraid I'm going to look to
[30:09] Christ and I'm going to trust in him I'm
[30:12] acknowledging my fear I'm acknowledging
[30:15] even my insecurities and my
[30:16] vulnerabilities I'm acknowledging my
[30:18] pain I'm acknowledging my hurt but I'm
[30:19] going to trust in you CU if I don't fear
[30:22] the lord then I'll find myself fearing
[30:25] the wrong thing and it leads to hate
[30:28] am now it's the the time is 11:07 I
[30:32] didn't promise any time that I would be
[30:33] done I didn't say I'd be done this
[30:35] morning I didn't even say I'd be done
[30:36] this afternoon but I want to take uh
[30:41] some time to deal with two different
[30:42] aspects and I think this might just be
[30:44] able to close this subject on hate and
[30:46] we can uh we can leave Christmas behind
[30:49] with this subject well actually there's
[30:51] still many days left of envy and
[30:53] jealousy as to what your big brother
[30:56] gets for Christmas think about a Tesla
[30:59] think about that how awesome that would
[31:06] be
[31:08] now if you could focus with
[31:11] me this is I'll say make it as a
[31:14] statement then we'll come to the quote
[31:16] I'm drawing this
[31:18] from people often hate and I'm not
[31:20] saying it's always this way but people
[31:22] often hate because they fear things that
[31:24] are different from
[31:26] them if something's different they can
[31:28] hate it and there's a lot of reasons to
[31:31] that but if it's if there's a uh you
[31:34] when you're the fear of the unknown
[31:36] there's a fear of things that are
[31:37] different but it that fear of things
[31:40] that are different not like
[31:42] you can lead us to hate brother brandom
[31:46] said it we've quoted this already in
[31:47] discernment of spirit he came to bring
[31:49] them peace this is Christ but they
[31:51] misunderstood him and hated him without
[31:53] a cause why did they hate him because
[31:55] they misunderstood him they're afraid of
[31:57] of what he was teaching they're afraid
[31:58] of what he was doing they're afraid of
[31:59] what he was going to do and so they
[32:01] didn't stop to try to see what he was
[32:02] trying to achieve they just judged him
[32:05] because he didn't agree with them
[32:06] somebody who disagrees someone who's
[32:08] different you fear that and through that
[32:09] fear you hate
[32:11] it hate is something that is
[32:14] bred by fear of the unknown I took this
[32:16] from a book man I wish I had have
[32:19] written it down now but I was just been
[32:20] doing a lot of study on the subject and
[32:21] reading different books says that
[32:24] they're showing how that hate is bred by
[32:26] it's fed by fear of the unknown fear of
[32:29] what might happen and fear of anything
[32:31] that's different than you or Falls
[32:33] outside your definition of what's
[32:35] supposed to be
[32:36] normal we could be this about the
[32:39] pettiest of things where when it comes
[32:41] to traditions and maybe this is a good
[32:43] time to deal with it well this is the
[32:44] way one family does one thing this is
[32:46] the way another family does something
[32:47] and we could find ourselves hating the
[32:49] way somebody else does something just
[32:52] because it's different than the way we
[32:54] do it well why do you hate that is it
[32:56] really wrong to open open all the gifts
[32:58] on Christmas Eve yes because we opened
[33:00] them all on Christmas morning and so you
[33:03] hate one tradition just because you're
[33:05] tradition's different the outcome's all
[33:06] the same right disappointed siblings and
[33:08] disappointed
[33:11] children but there's a fear of the
[33:14] unknown fear of what might happen fear
[33:16] of anything that's different than you
[33:17] wow that changes things well if I a fear
[33:20] of the unknown and fear of what might
[33:21] happen that might make sense but just
[33:23] fear of something that's just different
[33:25] than what you think is normal it breeds
[33:28] hatred they have a they've they've made
[33:31] a theory out of this and not that we
[33:33] need to go out and test this or anything
[33:36] but it's an ingroup outgroup
[33:38] Theory and the basis is or the thesis is
[33:42] when we feel threatened by perceived
[33:44] Outsiders we instinctively turn toward
[33:46] our ingroup as a survival
[33:49] mechanism so at the end of the day these
[33:52] feelings of hate is our defense
[33:54] mechanism against fear because now we
[33:57] want to redefine fear and now it's hate
[34:00] it's this detest and it's a survival
[34:02] mechanism to where now we're wanting to
[34:04] protect
[34:05] ourselves and then that just leads to a
[34:07] whole bunch of robust theology to
[34:10] justify not just your fear but now your
[34:12] hate as to why you are okay in hating
[34:16] those who aren't in the
[34:17] group they call it ingroup bias it's
[34:20] tendency to give preferential treatment
[34:22] or think better of those who belong to
[34:23] the same
[34:24] group those you identify with with those
[34:27] that you know those that you agree with
[34:30] those that do things the way you do it
[34:32] those that you understand and this and
[34:35] and you when you belong to something
[34:36] that feels a void this need for an
[34:38] identity you find something you can
[34:39] identify with and we all think this way
[34:41] and we all believe this way and it puts
[34:43] you in an ingroup and then anybody who
[34:45] doesn't think and feel the same way you
[34:47] do they're on the outside so you
[34:50] perceive yourself as better a a and you
[34:52] perceive yourself as worth protecting
[34:54] and worth defending and it leads now and
[34:56] and if I could say this I hopefully it's
[34:59] here in some of these scriptures and
[35:00] things you could see this that because
[35:02] you think you're right if somebody's
[35:04] different their different idea is a
[35:07] threat to whether or not your
[35:10] right and then our response to our own
[35:13] uncertainty is to hate
[35:18] them it's this this creating an identity
[35:23] around something and whenever there's a
[35:25] perceived threat to what you identify
[35:27] yourself with it provokes when there's a
[35:29] perceived threat it provokes fear and
[35:32] that fear leads us to hate those that
[35:34] are threatening us now I think hating
[35:36] something that's threatening you would
[35:37] be a complete we could ra we could
[35:39] rationalize that right that if every day
[35:41] somebody showed up at your door and was
[35:43] pushing your ring camera and saying if
[35:45] you come out today I'm GNA beat you up
[35:48] and every day ding dong and you pulled
[35:50] up and here's that guy that neighbor
[35:51] who's just threatening you so you never
[35:52] leave the house I mean in time you're
[35:54] going to hate the guy right because of
[35:56] fear and what it does to your life and
[35:59] how you having to change everything that
[36:00] that makes sense but yet this is this is
[36:03] even just a perceived threat not an
[36:05] actual threat Philippians 2:3 it says
[36:08] let nothing be done through Strife or
[36:10] vain Glory Glory but in liness of Mind
[36:13] Let each esteem other better than
[36:16] themselves I I I I would like to spend
[36:19] more time on this estimation of others
[36:22] but it is it is an idea of
[36:24] compassion and empathy sympathy if you
[36:27] can't muster up empathy but where
[36:29] there's some idea of compassion for
[36:31] somebody else and so it's it's not that
[36:34] you abandon uh it's not that you have
[36:37] low self-esteem but it's kind of a
[36:39] changing and it's certainly not
[36:41] covetousness or jealousy like oh I just
[36:43] wish I was them why well I'm just
[36:45] wanting to do Philippians 2:3 I think
[36:48] they're better than me and that's not
[36:50] what's you're being asked to do but let
[36:52] nothing be through done through Strife
[36:54] or vain glory and it's this idea of
[36:57] separating out the word strife there is
[37:00] politicking party making so when we say
[37:03] let nothing be done through Strife it's
[37:05] where you're going to cleave things and
[37:06] divide things up and create the in group
[37:09] and leaves others out and you don't
[37:12] value how somebody else feels you don't
[37:14] value how when somebody else is
[37:15] different you don't value uh uh whatever
[37:18] the differences might be and find some
[37:19] way to harmonize and get along but it's
[37:22] a self-promotion it's Pride it's party
[37:24] making it's politics let nothing be done
[37:27] through politics to promote yourself to
[37:30] gain favor to gain support to build
[37:33] consensus at somebody else's
[37:37] expense they this is I think you'll find
[37:40] this in a lot of places we could always
[37:42] consult with our our local political
[37:44] expert Dr coffee but the fundamental
[37:46] political emotion is
[37:49] fear fundamental political uh uh emotion
[37:53] is
[37:54] fear that if you can incite the people
[37:57] the passions your your argument
[37:59] gained and typically that most important
[38:02] passion is not excited about the future
[38:05] and wow you got some great ideas about
[38:07] tax reform it's usually how you better
[38:10] be afraid of the other guy's tax policy
[38:13] and wow you've got some really good
[38:14] ideas on how to improve the economy no
[38:16] it's usually being afraid of what the
[38:18] other guy can do to the
[38:20] economy and so the most fundamental
[38:22] political emotion is fear and if you can
[38:25] Stoke fear it leads to disgust it leads
[38:27] to anger it leads to lashing out it
[38:30] leads to forming if I could use a
[38:32] message phrase it
[38:33] clicks that exclusive group a privileged
[38:37] group that others can't just readily
[38:40] join and truly it's only a click if
[38:43] you're not in it right because if you're
[38:47] in it you're like I mean this isn't a
[38:49] click this is this is where the Eagles
[38:51] have been
[38:52] gathered right but if you're on the
[38:54] outside I can't believe these politic
[38:56] and this strife and and uh I think I've
[38:59] shared the story one time where somebody
[39:01] was complaining about their church and
[39:03] they said several of his families are
[39:04] getting together talking about how no
[39:05] one ever gets together with us and how
[39:08] this church is clickish I'm
[39:10] like I didn't hear that right definitely
[39:13] didn't hear that right run this by me
[39:14] again yeah several families have been
[39:16] getting together we've been getting
[39:17] together on a regular basis just talking
[39:18] about how about nobody in this church
[39:19] gets together and it's just one big
[39:20] click I'm like run it by me again I'm
[39:24] not here I'm definitely not hearing this
[39:25] right
[39:28] why because they couldn't they didn't
[39:29] look at their group as the click it was
[39:32] all the other groups they're not a part
[39:33] of those are
[39:34] clicks but it does speak to how sides
[39:37] are formed on things a a and an issue or
[39:40] situation comes up and you've got to
[39:42] take a side and you've got to you got to
[39:44] be in the EV crowd or you got to be in
[39:45] the combustible crowd or you got to
[39:47] believe recognize this and do that and
[39:49] so when there's sides that start to be
[39:51] drawn let nothing be done through Strife
[39:53] or politicking or party making what I'm
[39:55] wanting you to see in this big picture
[39:56] Pi if it's getting lost is that if you
[39:58] can be
[40:00] grouped that can create a distrust of
[40:03] anyone not in the group that breeds fear
[40:06] which breeds
[40:08] hatred and so this is how things become
[40:10] very divisive and this is how things
[40:13] begin to stir up where you feel the need
[40:14] to defend you feel the need to protect
[40:16] you feel the need to tear
[40:18] down and if someone's not on your side
[40:20] maybe you don't have a really good
[40:21] argument so the only thing you can do is
[40:24] tear down theirs or make them look bad
[40:26] all for the means of politicking or
[40:28] protecting
[40:30] yourself as James says it in James 3:16
[40:33] for where envy and and strife is there's
[40:36] confusion in every evil work because of
[40:40] these emotions where there's been sides
[40:42] drawn where there's been clicks and
[40:43] groups separate out it's just kind of a
[40:45] natural process I'm in this group you're
[40:47] in that group oh no there's differences
[40:50] there's differences of opinions there's
[40:52] different goals there's different
[40:53] Ambitions there's different ideas on how
[40:54] things should be done I have an idea
[40:56] that next year I think all the sisters
[40:58] should throw a big cookie exchange for
[40:59] all the
[41:01] brothers if you've seen the pictures you
[41:03] know where I'm coming
[41:05] from but there's once the sides are
[41:07] drawn and there's opinions on how things
[41:09] should be done that it's natural now for
[41:12] people to feel defensive and to stir
[41:14] things up and try to bolster support and
[41:16] I know a lot of this can happen and it's
[41:18] organic and it's positive and it's good
[41:21] when there's differences and people try
[41:22] to reason together and work things out
[41:24] but we got to recognize the feeling that
[41:26] give rise to other feelings that lead to
[41:29] places dark places like confusion in
[41:31] every evil work and the sermon
[41:34] Fellowship brother BR says when your
[41:35] Soul's been washed in the blood of the
[41:37] Lamb actually the way he's saying this
[41:39] is very striking because he's saying
[41:41] where there's where there is the
[41:43] separation you don't have the Holy Ghost
[41:45] and so it should be challenging to us to
[41:47] recognize that any nature that would
[41:49] lead to that politicking is not the Holy
[41:51] Ghost we have and when your soul has
[41:53] been washed in the blood of the Lamb all
[41:55] malice hatred strife and all these
[41:57] things has died amen just believe it and
[42:00] don't resurrect it the blood makes an
[42:02] atonement that's the reason today in our
[42:04] Pentecostal fellowships in our different
[42:06] Full Gospel fellowships we have so much
[42:09] carrying on so much chasm in stuff in
[42:12] our body the differences the separation
[42:16] because our different isms remember how
[42:19] we brother Ram talked about those isms
[42:20] and how they lead to hate and things
[42:21] rather has set
[42:23] in is because that one will pull out and
[42:26] do this and one of them pull out and do
[42:28] this and one will pull out and start a
[42:30] denomination or
[42:32] organization he's he's identifying where
[42:34] there's a distinction that is not
[42:38] godly where you're not fearing the Lord
[42:40] there's not this uh let nothing be done
[42:43] through Strife or vain Glory but liness
[42:44] of Mind Let each esteem other better
[42:46] than themselves where what something is
[42:48] done to be against
[42:50] another and I think it happens so often
[42:53] that someone does something there's this
[42:54] tendency to think oh they did it again
[42:56] against another when you could be
[42:57] fearing the Lord and just obeying the
[42:59] Lord to do something and people think oh
[43:01] he must have done that against that
[43:03] person oh they're fearing the lord it's
[43:05] not a sword drawn it's not a line drawn
[43:07] in the sand this is an offense against
[43:09] anything but there's got to be a
[43:12] recognition when we're acting according
[43:14] to these isms he says starting these
[43:16] chasms and stuff in the body and it's
[43:18] set in and he says that's breeding this
[43:20] malice or I'm say I'm saying as it read
[43:23] these things it's breeding these other
[43:24] emotions cuz brother says notice how
[43:26] organization breeds
[43:29] hatred which destroys fellowships makes
[43:31] bitterness that's that anger or
[43:33] disappointment and here say they pull
[43:35] out and start an organization what's the
[43:36] organization going to do breed hatred
[43:38] against what you
[43:40] left and then what does that do the
[43:42] group that stayed or the the group that
[43:44] the organization that was left starts to
[43:46] hate the group and the group that left
[43:48] right and it breeds competitiveness and
[43:52] comparison did you stream their service
[43:54] did you count how many heads they had
[43:56] how many people were
[44:01] there so we I I want to capture it this
[44:05] way these feelings of hate that we're
[44:07] talking about can begin where there's an
[44:08] offense there's been some injury there's
[44:10] been some hurt there's been a wrong
[44:11] there's been a transgression abuse uh
[44:14] manipulation fraud there could be a
[44:17] situation happened where through some
[44:19] overt action or offense we're called
[44:21] those offenses where the hate can begin
[44:23] to
[44:24] grow but hate can also be
[44:28] manufactured and this is where to me it
[44:31] became so striking as I've been studying
[44:32] these things over the last while where
[44:35] we're experiencing deep strong feelings
[44:39] of
[44:40] hate but based upon differences not
[44:45] offenses where we've we're allowing them
[44:47] even in kind of worthless scenarios
[44:49] where there's real no reason why we
[44:51] should be feeling this way so intensely
[44:54] as we do but it could be manufactured in
[44:57] meaningless scenarios or worthless
[44:58] scenarios just based upon
[45:02] differences I don't know if any of you
[45:05] are familiar
[45:06] with it happened after Martin Luther
[45:10] King Jr was assassinated a third grade
[45:11] teacher in rville Iowa did an experiment
[45:14] with her class her name was Jane Elliott
[45:16] spelled the way Elliot spells his name
[45:18] the suggested owner of a new Tesla come
[45:23] 25th and in trying to help this her
[45:25] third grade students seven-year-olds to
[45:27] understand maybe a racial divide or
[45:30] hatred she divided her class by eye
[45:32] color and as much as I've read about it
[45:35] I didn't fully drill down into all the
[45:37] specifics and I didn't want to kind of
[45:38] get lost in the weeds but she divided my
[45:41] brown eyes and blue eyes and I'm pretty
[45:43] sure the class wasn't just evenly
[45:45] divided by that I'm sure there's maybe
[45:46] some other Spectrum there but it was
[45:48] brown eyes versus blue eyes and I think
[45:51] initially when she did she said we have
[45:52] the browney students in this group Blue
[45:54] Eyes in this group and the brown eyes
[45:56] don't have to take any tests today they
[45:58] have a longer uh playtime they get best
[46:02] food at lunch or whatever and she just
[46:03] gave them preferential treatment and
[46:05] implied and suggested as the teacher
[46:07] that they were Superior than the
[46:08] blue-eyed kids and she switched it
[46:11] around and did it I think the next day
[46:12] kind of flipped the tables a little bit
[46:14] but the word that was used is that it
[46:16] turned these seven-year-olds into hate
[46:19] mongers and they the BL brown-eyed kids
[46:22] ridiculed the blue-eyed kids they
[46:24] shunned them they wouldn't have anything
[46:25] to do with them now that you had the
[46:27] brown-eyed group that had privileges
[46:29] they didn't want to have anything to do
[46:30] with the blue-eyed kids who
[46:31] didn't and they spoke very hatefully
[46:34] they shunned and they ridiculed and they
[46:36] made fun of and just by putting kids
[46:39] into categories based upon eye color
[46:41] made these groups hate each other and
[46:45] this is what Miss Elliott had to say I
[46:47] watched what had been marvelous
[46:49] Cooperative wonderful thoughtful
[46:51] children man what kind of corn are they
[46:52] feeding those kids seven-year-olds oh
[46:55] marvelous and cooperative and wonderful
[46:57] thoughtful children turned into nasty
[47:00] vicious discriminating little third
[47:02] graders in a space of 15 minutes that's
[47:05] a phrase that's never been uttered nasty
[47:07] vicious discriminating little third
[47:09] graders in a space of 15 minutes she
[47:12] says in 15 minutes I turned
[47:14] seven-year-olds into hate mongers just
[47:15] by putting them into
[47:17] groups based nothing nothing makes a
[47:20] real difference right unless you're
[47:21] Aryan or something like that I said no
[47:23] the blue eyes they're definitely better
[47:25] blond haired blue I preferred right
[47:27] there might be some kind of History
[47:28] where that's kind of baked into your
[47:30] theology but this is just innocent third
[47:32] graders they haven't been taught to hate
[47:34] on that level yet but just by putting
[47:36] them in these arbitrary groups they now
[47:38] said well comparing themselves felt
[47:41] better than the other group now it's
[47:43] important to note that the teacher
[47:45] instigated all this they wouldn't have
[47:47] come up with this on their own and I
[47:49] identify that for you to recognize how
[47:51] that someone with the inference of
[47:53] authority clear Authority in this
[47:54] instance was able to manufacture hatred
[47:57] where it hadn't been
[47:58] before and a lot of people may look at
[48:01] these situations I'll read another one
[48:02] here I think we used when we were doing
[48:04] the who's my neighbor series a few years
[48:06] ago that we might look at say oh wow
[48:08] what a social experiment notice just how
[48:10] easy it is for people in groups to hate
[48:13] but here there was this overt pressure
[48:16] and a seeding of
[48:19] superiority in a language being used by
[48:21] someone with uh uh with with power and
[48:25] saying this to these children and that
[48:28] ultimately at the end of the day is what
[48:30] prompted them to hate they didn't they
[48:33] didn't divide themselves into these
[48:35] groups it was an influence that did
[48:38] it Paul says in 2 Corinthians chapter
[48:40] 10:12 for we dare not make ourselves of
[48:43] the number or compare ourselves with
[48:44] some that commend our themselves but
[48:47] they measuring themselves by themselves
[48:49] and comparing themselves among
[48:51] themselves are not
[48:53] wise who are themselves there's a lot of
[48:56] them we and it's kind of ironic what he
[48:59] says here in context we do not make
[49:01] ourselves of the number or compare
[49:02] ourselves with some that commend
[49:04] themselves but they measuring themselves
[49:07] by themselves through the comparisons
[49:10] they are they compare themselves among
[49:12] themselves they're not wise if I could
[49:15] say it this way it's not wise to draw
[49:16] conclusions about yourself based upon
[49:18] your comparison to somebody else good or
[49:21] bad it's not good to draw conclusions
[49:23] about ourselves based upon our
[49:24] comparison to others
[49:26] we might do that sometimes to make
[49:27] ourselves feel good when something
[49:30] happens like well at least I'm not like
[49:32] that or I've never done that and there's
[49:33] this idea sometimes we're trying to make
[49:35] ourselves feel good about ourselves
[49:36] because of how bad somebody else can be
[49:38] but then there's also this inverse that
[49:40] we compare ourselves to somebody else we
[49:42] can begin to envy and by comparison we
[49:45] find our differences and where there's
[49:47] differences it can breed this fear of a
[49:49] perceived
[49:50] threat he says it's not wise why because
[49:53] it leads to contention it leads to
[49:54] Strife it leads to division ISS it's not
[49:57] the Peaceable wisdom from
[50:00] above this was the experiment that we
[50:03] had mentioned to you before uh you know
[50:06] some of you may recall this but it's
[50:07] called the robbers cave experiment done
[50:10] at the robbers cave uh State Park in
[50:13] Oklahoma and they took 22 boys that were
[50:16] 11 years old and they brought him to a
[50:20] fake summer camp and they divided him
[50:23] into two teams you had the Eagles
[50:27] and the Rattlers serpents we're already
[50:30] choosing sides who we want to win and
[50:33] they they brought him to this fake
[50:34] summer camp and it's all for the purpose
[50:36] of examining group dynamics and the the
[50:39] the professor who was doing this had an
[50:41] agenda and he had something in in his
[50:42] mind he was trying to recreate he T
[50:44] tried two other times and it really
[50:45] didn't work or not the way that he
[50:47] wanted it to and so they have one group
[50:50] get there early and then they bring the
[50:52] other group in later and they both don't
[50:53] know about each other and so they
[50:56] separate these groups and they allowed
[50:59] them to give themselves names and they
[51:01] begin to identify and rally around one
[51:03] another but then they begin to cause
[51:05] them to compete in various
[51:07] activities and all the while the adults
[51:10] are administering this experiment on
[51:12] these kids for these three weeks without
[51:13] the parents knowing by the way it's a
[51:15] lot of ethical concerns with how this
[51:17] was done could never do it today this is
[51:19] in
[51:20] 1954 but they just by allowing these two
[51:23] groups to have these identities and then
[51:24] committ to compete with one another they
[51:26] begin to show this increasing
[51:28] hostility which ultimately escalated
[51:30] into
[51:32] violence where uh the it was probably
[51:35] the Rattlers that invaded the Eagle camp
[51:37] in the middle of the night and
[51:39] terrorized and were angry and rude and
[51:41] mean and and they began to act in these
[51:43] very aggressive ways and it became
[51:46] violent and so this is what and it was
[51:49] real genuine feeling of hatred for the
[51:52] other
[51:53] group now this was what the the the
[51:56] scientists want to conclude is just by
[51:57] putting people into
[51:59] groups they can learn to hate the other
[52:02] but when you really look at it someone
[52:04] was instigating
[52:06] it it was
[52:08] meaningless this is the part I want you
[52:09] to catch it wasn't like you put a group
[52:11] of guys in a campsite and made them
[52:14] compete against one another in different
[52:16] activities and they just started to hate
[52:19] one another you had the the
[52:21] administrators of this experiment
[52:23] provoking it in seeding it they would
[52:25] actually go into the the campground and
[52:28] steal a steal a sleeping bag and turn
[52:30] things over and pour water all over
[52:31] their beds and then say somebody must
[52:33] have done this to you it must have been
[52:35] the Eagles that's right and they're
[52:38] manufacturing
[52:39] hatred as a matter of fact in one of the
[52:41] groups where they allowed the all as a
[52:43] group to get together and they all kind
[52:44] of became friends and they had their
[52:46] friendships and they noticed who had
[52:47] kind of partnered up and who knew each
[52:48] other and so they tried to divide the
[52:50] friends and put them in this group and
[52:52] put them in that group and they tried to
[52:54] get them to hate each other but they
[52:56] couldn't and they eventually turned
[52:58] against the
[53:00] counselors why because the counselors
[53:02] were the
[53:03] antagonist and it provoked hate but what
[53:06] I want you to recognize is these the way
[53:09] things can be
[53:10] manipulated in meaningless differences
[53:12] and with these meaningless grouped
[53:14] identities become a basis for
[53:16] hate that's what I began to realize
[53:18] there's a synthetic hate that the
[53:20] devil's trying to put on us amen we we
[53:22] we there's one if I could say one pure
[53:24] hatred and that's for evil everything
[53:27] else is a manufactured hatred that the
[53:28] devil's trying to put on us where we
[53:31] have some sort of group Identity or some
[53:33] sort of differences and some perceived
[53:35] threat and allows us to be hostile and
[53:37] violent persecute hate something
[53:40] different than
[53:41] us Paul says this in Ephesians chapter
[53:46] 5 says submitting yourselves one to
[53:48] another in the fear of God to submit it
[53:52] means to range I know to to say submit
[53:56] it kind of has this idea of one's one's
[53:57] on top and one's on bottom one's higher
[53:59] one's lower but if you submit yourselves
[54:01] one to another think even that language
[54:03] suggests that if we have to submit
[54:06] ourselves to each other it has more to
[54:07] do with Arrangement as opposed to one
[54:08] being greater or better than the other
[54:11] it's to arrange together even to arrange
[54:13] under or to subject one to but notice it
[54:15] says in the fear of God so there's one
[54:18] thing that we submit to we're arranged
[54:20] under a common faith we submit to one
[54:23] another under a common trust in God a
[54:26] common belief and conviction in God
[54:28] brother Brandon when he's preaching the
[54:30] revelation of Jesus Christ Revelations
[54:31] chapter 4 part 3 he says submit yourself
[54:34] congregation submit yourself to your
[54:36] pastor Pastor submit yourself to your
[54:38] congregation if a little click Rises up
[54:41] don't be on either side submit yourself
[54:43] to the whole congregation congregation
[54:46] if you start in a click submit yourself
[54:47] to your pastor in the fear of God this
[54:50] is this is the solution as I was reading
[54:53] these things and going over this these
[54:54] things it's spoke to me how that this is
[54:56] where our trust is we trust in the Lord
[55:00] not some sort of arbitrary
[55:02] arrangement we we we're not even
[55:04] trusting in this grouping we're trusting
[55:07] in the Lord and because we can trust in
[55:08] the Lord we can submit ourselves to one
[55:10] another we're not trusting that we're
[55:12] the group that's right we're not
[55:13] trusting that we're the only group
[55:14] that's got it we're not trusting in
[55:15] ourselves to be able to pull this off
[55:17] we've submitted ourselves to the Lord
[55:19] and he says whenever there's a grouping
[55:21] that starts taking place he says if a
[55:23] little click Rises up he says don't take
[55:26] sides submit yourselves together rally
[55:28] together find your common basis find
[55:30] your common trust we may not be able to
[55:33] trust one another when it comes to these
[55:35] other differences but we can trust in
[55:37] him and it becomes this solution to fear
[55:41] and anger and perceived threat to where
[55:43] we're fearing the right thing and
[55:44] because I fear the right thing I'm not
[55:46] going to let my fear of the wrong thing
[55:48] instigate me to wrong
[55:51] things if there's a click that starts up
[55:53] submit yourself
[55:56] submit yourself to the fear of the Lord
[55:58] Proverbs 19:23 says the fear of the Lord
[56:01] tendeth to
[56:02] life and he that hath it shall abide
[56:05] satisfied he shall not be visited with
[56:08] evil the fear of the Lord tendeth to
[56:11] life the fear of the wrong thing tends
[56:13] to death when we're fearful it just
[56:17] drains us right when you're afraid of
[56:20] something that anxiety inducing emotions
[56:22] and what the physiological process that
[56:24] takes place
[56:26] it's fear is rooted even in the way that
[56:29] they uh look at the uh evolution of our
[56:33] brains and how they develop that this
[56:34] fear is so rooted in
[56:37] survival it's so rooted in in in the
[56:39] threat of life and the and being
[56:41] threatened to
[56:44] death fear of the Lord though tends to
[56:47] life he that hath shall abide satisfied
[56:50] and not be visited with
[56:52] evil brother Bram says in the sermon pal
[56:55] Locust cankerworm caterpillar he says
[56:57] notice Faith the true Faith the real
[56:59] Faith the the faith we take our churches
[57:01] today look at us look at our Pentecostal
[57:03] people look at our Baptist people our
[57:05] Presbyterian nazarin Pilgrim Holiness
[57:07] and the brandom Tabernacle all of us
[57:10] we're guilty of not earnestly contending
[57:13] for that faith and this is what he so
[57:16] earnestly contending for their faith and
[57:18] then notice what he BRS brings it to a
[57:20] little fuss can come up in the church in
[57:23] the brandom Tabernacle goes I'm at home
[57:25] I could talk about you
[57:26] now he said a little fuss can come up in
[57:29] the church and they'll form a little
[57:30] quick click and one get on one side and
[57:33] one on the
[57:34] other and and just drawing now from what
[57:36] we've identified in the scripture and
[57:38] just in Human Experience how that
[57:40] groupings insights fussing and stewing
[57:42] and disagreement and combating and
[57:45] wrestling and finagling and that's what
[57:47] becomes the hatred and the
[57:49] animosity so they'll form a little click
[57:51] and one get on one side and one on the
[57:53] other he says is that contending for the
[57:54] faith that was once delivered to the
[57:56] Saints does that sound like the
[57:57] apostolic Doctrine no sir brother noce
[58:02] how once again he's kind of hitting at
[58:03] this idea that we can have all we're
[58:05] Apostolic the restoration of the
[58:07] apostolic and there can be this veneer
[58:09] of being Apostolic but where there's
[58:11] hatred you cannot be true Apostolic you
[58:14] can have all the veneer of
[58:15] Pentecostalism but if you have hatred
[58:17] that cannot be original
[58:19] Pentecost he says is that contending for
[58:21] the faith when we're contending with one
[58:24] another
[58:25] when we're click defending and click
[58:28] building it's where where he says we've
[58:30] left we're not contending for the faith
[58:32] in other words we're not submitting to
[58:33] the faith where the fear of the Lord is
[58:35] it tends to life where there's a fear of
[58:37] other ideas and other things it tends to
[58:40] death we know there's liar in the world
[58:42] we know there's false Doctrine we know
[58:43] there's enemies of the message we know
[58:45] there's enemies of the Cross but we
[58:46] shouldn't be afraid of them we shouldn't
[58:49] allow all the differences and
[58:50] disagreements and all the saber rattling
[58:52] and all the as I call it the chip
[58:55] chipmunks that are chirping and
[58:57] everything all those things that are
[58:58] taking place and the squirrels that are
[59:00] barking trying to get our attention
[59:01] don't be afraid of them
[59:03] amen but abide
[59:06] satisfied why because you fear the
[59:08] lord because I trust in the Lord I'm
[59:11] free from
[59:12] Fear because I trust in the Lord I'm
[59:14] free from bitterness doesn't mean
[59:16] there's not evil trying to provoke me
[59:19] doesn't mean there's not things out
[59:20] there taking place that are causing me
[59:21] to try to hate but trus in the Lord
[59:23] keeps the evil away I will abide
[59:26] satisfied and I won't be visited with
[59:28] that evil
[59:29] hate because I fear the lord I'm not
[59:33] going to allow so now we'll just kind of
[59:36] close that thought a little bit I'm not
[59:37] going to allow the fear of others who
[59:40] are different from me or the fear of
[59:41] other groups the fear of other ideas
[59:43] provoke me to hate those that are
[59:45] different or have other ideas I won't do
[59:47] it I'll fear the
[59:49] lord that's what I that's who I will
[59:52] trust is the Lord amen
[59:55] but now me close the service with
[59:58] this and close it just it's like you can
[1:00:00] close a series with like four Services
[1:00:02] right so let me close with this this is
[1:00:05] my final thought on this today hate is
[1:00:08] sometimes born not just from things that
[1:00:12] we fear that are different to
[1:00:14] us but we hate because we fear what may
[1:00:17] be true about
[1:00:21] ourselves kind it's a as we mentioned
[1:00:23] earlier it's a survival
[1:00:25] mechanism that we're not willing to
[1:00:27] admit what may be true about
[1:00:29] ourselves we don't really want to face
[1:00:31] the of what might be right about
[1:00:33] ourselves so it's kind of
[1:00:35] self-defense and and I'm wanting to
[1:00:37] address this and again I've been told
[1:00:39] that this is heavy I kind of like the
[1:00:40] way one brother put it it's
[1:00:42] challenging and I know this is
[1:00:44] challenging but if God can speak to our
[1:00:46] hearts to this it's liberating that
[1:00:48] sometimes we cling to hatred we can
[1:00:51] cling to bitterness and resentment all
[1:00:52] these things we cling to it because
[1:00:54] without it we'll be we'll be forced to
[1:00:57] deal with our own
[1:00:59] weaknesses the as long as I'm
[1:01:01] preoccupied with this hate as long as
[1:01:03] I'm holding this offense as long as I'm
[1:01:05] grudging then it becomes a buffer
[1:01:07] becomes some sort of distance and I can
[1:01:09] hold on to that and it's
[1:01:10] distracting but if I ever let go of my
[1:01:13] hate I'll have to address what's in me
[1:01:15] I'll have to address my own faults I'll
[1:01:17] have to address my own pain and
[1:01:20] sometimes we don't want to address the
[1:01:21] pain so we just we keep addressing the
[1:01:23] offense because we want to address the
[1:01:25] damage we keep addressing the offender
[1:01:27] because we don't want to address the
[1:01:29] pain this may seem to be a little bit of
[1:01:31] a unique scripture to use in light of
[1:01:33] that but in Matthew 7: 1 to5 it says
[1:01:36] judge not that ye be not judged this is
[1:01:38] that giving of an opinion uh expressing
[1:01:41] something for with what judgment you
[1:01:43] judge ye shall be judged and with what
[1:01:45] what measure you meet it shall be
[1:01:47] measured to you
[1:01:48] again and so it's a caution against the
[1:01:51] opinions that we offer and how quick we
[1:01:52] are to judge others and say what
[1:01:54] whatever judgment you have to somebody
[1:01:55] else you're going to be judged by it so
[1:01:57] maybe that's why we just keep
[1:01:59] judging so that there's never an
[1:02:01] opportunity to be
[1:02:03] judged I don't know if this is similar
[1:02:06] but it's it's in the sense that as long
[1:02:07] as I keep judging I I won't give you a
[1:02:10] chance to judge me I won't give a chance
[1:02:11] for judgment to come back on me it's
[1:02:13] kind of that game where it's like you
[1:02:15] let's see who can hit the person the
[1:02:17] softest right and so you let the other
[1:02:19] guy go first and they're just kind of
[1:02:20] like and then you just go you win right
[1:02:25] or if I if I hit you with if I if I
[1:02:27] could crack two eggs on your head I'll
[1:02:29] give you 20 bucks right and like okay
[1:02:33] sure I can clean up right two eggs so
[1:02:35] then you just crack one and walk
[1:02:37] away it's like there's a way that we
[1:02:39] we're engaged in this game where as long
[1:02:41] as I'm in control of the rules it's
[1:02:44] never going to come back on
[1:02:47] me and then it says why beholdest thou
[1:02:50] the moat that is in thy brother's eye
[1:02:53] the the sliver the Splinter but consider
[1:02:57] it's not the beam that is in thine own
[1:02:59] eye it I this is Jesus this is what I
[1:03:02] use to justify my being
[1:03:04] dramatic uh whenever there's a
[1:03:07] disagreement but he's he's this
[1:03:12] exaggeration like your friend has a
[1:03:14] sliver it's not even really
[1:03:16] discernible and you're beholding it and
[1:03:18] you're fixated on it and you're running
[1:03:20] them down and you're critical but yet
[1:03:23] you've got a worse problem
[1:03:25] right or how Willl thou say to thy
[1:03:27] brother let me pull out the moat out of
[1:03:29] thine eye and behold a beam is in thine
[1:03:31] own eye there's a lot we can amplify in
[1:03:34] this but he says Thou hypocrite First
[1:03:36] cast out the beam out of thine own eye
[1:03:38] and then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast
[1:03:40] out the moat out of thy brother's
[1:03:42] eye now it is remarkable that Jesus is
[1:03:45] saying you know the sliver in his eye is
[1:03:47] not being is not
[1:03:49] permissible it should be addressed but
[1:03:52] he's identifying the hypocrisy and how
[1:03:53] we can we could be so fixated and
[1:03:56] stirred up by something that's really
[1:03:58] trivial or small in someone else's life
[1:04:00] but it's a means of distracting us from
[1:04:02] addressing the big things in our own
[1:04:04] lives said another way a Critic usually
[1:04:06] and rarely sees in himself what he so
[1:04:08] readily sees in somebody
[1:04:12] else many times we'll identify in others
[1:04:15] things that we're unwilling to identify
[1:04:16] in ourselves recently I think we used
[1:04:19] the scripture and said it's the pot
[1:04:20] calling the kettle
[1:04:22] black what is the pot doing it's
[1:04:25] projecting now catch this part we're
[1:04:27] going to we're ending on this thought of
[1:04:29] this
[1:04:29] projecting the the pot is black and it
[1:04:32] projects its own Blackness onto the
[1:04:35] kettle and judges the kettle not because
[1:04:38] it is in fact black but it's projected
[1:04:41] its
[1:04:43] characteristics onto something
[1:04:45] else and therefore criticizes and
[1:04:48] belittles and says things that are not
[1:04:51] true about the kettle but true of itself
[1:04:53] cuz the pot calling the kettle black the
[1:04:55] kettle polished reflective and the pot
[1:04:58] is seen itself in the kettle not even a
[1:05:01] true representation of the kettle it's
[1:05:04] called projection it's the process of
[1:05:06] displacing your own feelings onto
[1:05:09] someone or something
[1:05:10] else what projection is we tend to
[1:05:13] attack in others what we find ugly or
[1:05:15] unacceptable in
[1:05:18] ourselves I'm glad to get a little bit
[1:05:20] of a right and some amens there it
[1:05:22] wasn't completely dead silent one of the
[1:05:24] kids said
[1:05:25] H we tend to lash out at
[1:05:29] detest things that we find ugly not
[1:05:32] about somebody else but in
[1:05:34] ourselves and it's done in order to
[1:05:36] defend ourselves to distract ourselves
[1:05:38] from our own weaknesses by focusing on
[1:05:39] the weaknesses of others it's kind of
[1:05:42] the this idea of saying I'm not a bad
[1:05:44] person you
[1:05:45] are I'm not selfish you are I'm not
[1:05:48] buying a Tesla you
[1:05:50] are there's these ideas and these
[1:05:52] Notions where we don't want to put these
[1:05:54] feelings in our in our hearts we we
[1:05:56] don't want to be we don't want to admit
[1:05:58] this is how it is and it's the roots of
[1:05:59] the fear of rejection the fear of being
[1:06:02] alone so we're constantly having to
[1:06:03] build ourselves up we're constantly
[1:06:05] trying to make ourselves feel good and
[1:06:06] so we we hate and we have these feelings
[1:06:09] of hatred because we're afraid that
[1:06:11] we're wrong we're afraid of being alone
[1:06:14] we're afraid of being
[1:06:17] rejected and so there's a tendency to
[1:06:20] hate and we could say may be reject or
[1:06:22] despised if you want to use some softer
[1:06:23] word words to hate what we don't like
[1:06:27] about
[1:06:28] ourselves and that's why Jesus says
[1:06:30] you're a
[1:06:32] hypocrite in reality you hate the beam
[1:06:35] in your eye and that's why their moat
[1:06:38] bothers you so
[1:06:39] much in job 36:13 you say what does this
[1:06:42] have to do with hate but the Hypocrites
[1:06:43] in heart Heap up
[1:06:45] wrath they cry not when he binded them
[1:06:49] there's a lot that's being said here in
[1:06:51] this particular portion In this passage
[1:06:54] and how that the Hypocrites in heart
[1:06:55] will Heap up the Wrath of the
[1:06:57] Lord they cry not when he bindeth them
[1:06:59] there's this there's certainly this
[1:07:01] picture that's being drawn of how the
[1:07:02] hypocrite is only reserving himself for
[1:07:04] judgment and judgment is going to be
[1:07:06] visited on him but a hypocrite is one
[1:07:08] who pretends to have something he does
[1:07:10] not have or pretends to be something
[1:07:12] that he is not and he says the hypocrite
[1:07:15] in heart is heaping up
[1:07:18] wrath and what a hypocrite heart will do
[1:07:20] when one is a hypocrite they condemn
[1:07:23] themselves and it leads to a hatred even
[1:07:25] a hatred or detesting of themselves as
[1:07:28] they say there's not no such thing as a
[1:07:29] conscious hypocrite why they sear
[1:07:31] themselves ultimately in the hate which
[1:07:33] they once had for themselves they
[1:07:34] project upon other people and hatred
[1:07:37] just this hypocrisy will Heap up
[1:07:40] wrath why because they're unwilling to
[1:07:43] address their own
[1:07:44] weaknesses and they're projecting it on
[1:07:47] other people and they're placing blame
[1:07:48] on other people and they're saying that
[1:07:50] other people are wrong and other people
[1:07:52] the reason why things are this way and
[1:07:53] other other people are this the other
[1:07:54] people are that and because they want to
[1:07:56] find someone else to blame for their
[1:07:58] situation it leads them to hate the
[1:08:00] people they've LED themselves to
[1:08:02] blame because it says they cry not when
[1:08:04] he bindeth them in other words they're
[1:08:05] not willing to admit that their
[1:08:07] afflictions are their cause they're not
[1:08:10] willing to admit that they have brought
[1:08:11] it upon themselves they do not cry when
[1:08:13] he bindeth them they're this isn't my
[1:08:16] fault I'm not going to say forgive me
[1:08:18] I'm not going to own
[1:08:20] it I'm going to push it off on somebody
[1:08:22] else and say it's your fault yeah you
[1:08:24] did
[1:08:27] this we mentioned before DC Stevenson
[1:08:30] and how he was the builder of the clan
[1:08:33] in
[1:08:34] Indiana the Grand Dragon and he actually
[1:08:36] built it to be the largest and most
[1:08:38] influential and this is all in the time
[1:08:40] where brother brandham is a child is
[1:08:43] coming into his ministry the influence
[1:08:45] the clan bought church after church
[1:08:47] after church influen Pulpit after Pulpit
[1:08:50] after pulpit in order to spread their
[1:08:52] propaganda they did a lot of deeds in
[1:08:54] the community that's why even the clan
[1:08:56] had paid for brother bram's medical
[1:08:57] bills I believe and things like that
[1:08:59] because they were seeking to buy
[1:09:01] influence and he said I did not sell the
[1:09:04] clan in Indiana on hatreds I've shared
[1:09:06] this with you already he didn't sell it
[1:09:07] on hatreds he didn't go and say you
[1:09:10] should hate this person you should hate
[1:09:12] this person he sold it on americanism so
[1:09:16] they told a story and they spun a yarn
[1:09:20] and us that as a means to provoke
[1:09:24] you just walk up to somebody say I want
[1:09:26] you to hate him it's probably not going
[1:09:27] to be effective but if I could tell you
[1:09:29] a story of what him did to you can tell
[1:09:32] you a story about what's happening and
[1:09:34] what their plans are and what they're
[1:09:35] going to do and how they're going to
[1:09:36] scheme I can lead you to hate by selling
[1:09:39] you on an ism without telling you to
[1:09:41] hate and this is what one of the writers
[1:09:44] about him kind of biographical account
[1:09:46] of him said he understood people's
[1:09:49] fears and their need to blame others for
[1:09:52] their
[1:09:52] failures this is what leads to hate is
[1:09:55] our fear and not just our fear of those
[1:09:58] that are different but our need to blame
[1:10:00] others for our own mistakes he
[1:10:02] discovered that if he said something
[1:10:03] often enough no matter how untrue people
[1:10:06] would believe it we're not talking about
[1:10:08] Trump we're talking about DC Stevenson
[1:10:10] now no matter how untrue people would
[1:10:12] believe it small lies were for the timid
[1:10:14] the key to telling a big lie was to do
[1:10:16] it with
[1:10:18] conviction and it wasn't hate them it
[1:10:21] was a untruth it was a lie all for the
[1:10:24] purpose of stoking some sort of love for
[1:10:27] something but Inspire in order to
[1:10:28] inspire hate for something else and what
[1:10:30] made the Clans hate so great what made
[1:10:33] it so diabolical and evil is because
[1:10:37] they knew what people were afraid of and
[1:10:40] their need to blame others for their
[1:10:42] fears the fear of something different
[1:10:45] and even the fear of what was in
[1:10:46] ourselves and how quickly we could
[1:10:48] project onto something else musicians if
[1:10:51] you'd
[1:10:52] come and what time I am
[1:10:55] afraid I will trust in
[1:10:58] thee faith is a deliberate trust it's a
[1:11:00] deliberate
[1:11:02] confidence in this will I be confident
[1:11:04] that word confident there could have
[1:11:05] been translated in this will I
[1:11:10] trust when I'm afraid of my
[1:11:13] enemy when I'm afraid of
[1:11:16] myself I will not abandon my trust in
[1:11:20] him because I don't want to
[1:11:22] hate
[1:11:24] there's no value in
[1:11:26] hatred it's costic it's a
[1:11:29] poison there's no value in
[1:11:32] fear there's no value in worry that's
[1:11:35] why I ask the question where's the
[1:11:37] trust there's a trust they even if they
[1:11:41] take a distinction in our English usage
[1:11:44] that confidence would be something that
[1:11:46] would be
[1:11:47] internal whether or not you have
[1:11:49] confidence in yourself and that trust
[1:11:51] would be something maybe that you would
[1:11:52] have towards somebody else or in
[1:11:53] somebody else so confidence is Maybe by
[1:11:56] internal means and trust is external
[1:11:58] where someone has earned your trust and
[1:12:01] maybe we could even go through that
[1:12:02] route in the semantics of that just to
[1:12:04] show that there's ways that we could put
[1:12:07] confidence in the flesh and that's a bad
[1:12:10] thing but then there's a point to where
[1:12:12] we have so much fear so much worry so
[1:12:14] much negativity and so much low
[1:12:16] self-esteem that we're not even willing
[1:12:18] to accept the grace that says you're
[1:12:20] more than a match for the devil in
[1:12:21] Christ that through Christ I can do all
[1:12:23] things and that I that he is my
[1:12:27] sufficiency so if our confidence is in
[1:12:29] the
[1:12:30] flesh and you're trusting in yourself at
[1:12:32] what time you're afraid I'm going to
[1:12:34] trust in myself to gut through this at
[1:12:36] what time I'm afraid I'm going to trust
[1:12:38] in myself to get over this at what time
[1:12:39] my enemy encamps itself against me I'm
[1:12:41] going to trust in my Superior intellect
[1:12:44] in order to thwart his ad uh his
[1:12:47] advances you're going to end up hating
[1:12:50] you know why cuz you fail because you
[1:12:52] lose and you hate yourself you hate your
[1:12:55] enemy you hate those who rallied against
[1:12:56] you all because you trust in the wrong
[1:13:00] thing so we read earlier in Hebrews
[1:13:02] chapter 13 let your conversation be
[1:13:05] without covetousness and be content with
[1:13:07] such things as you have for he hath said
[1:13:10] I will never leave thee nor forsake thee
[1:13:12] that's where we put the
[1:13:14] trust so that we may boldly say this is
[1:13:17] what we might boldly say the Lord is my
[1:13:20] helper and I will not fear what man
[1:13:23] shall do unto me it notice what he's
[1:13:26] saying man can do things to you but I'm
[1:13:29] not going to fear it he doesn't say the
[1:13:32] Lord is my helper and man won't do
[1:13:34] anything to me he just says I won't fear
[1:13:37] what man will do to me because the Lord
[1:13:39] is my helper I I'm crying this out to
[1:13:42] you in light of this subject of hate
[1:13:45] that we ought to trust in him when it's
[1:13:48] when the world is coming against us and
[1:13:50] ideas are thrown at us and family
[1:13:52] members uh persecute us whatever it
[1:13:54] might be trust in him don't cast off
[1:13:57] your faith don't try to get into a
[1:13:59] battle of wits or intellect or try to
[1:14:00] prove this or prove that in the presence
[1:14:02] of hate I'll Trust in his presence in
[1:14:05] the presence of my adversary I'll run to
[1:14:07] my Advocate I'm going to trust in him
[1:14:10] because that's where my peace is that's
[1:14:12] where my strength is that's where my
[1:14:13] love is that's my shelter against the
[1:14:16] hate and if I can stay there trusting I
[1:14:18] won't be hating
[1:14:21] myself I'll be able to have the right
[1:14:23] kind of response in the face of hate
[1:14:25] that actually turns the aggressor says
[1:14:28] wait a minute you're not going to return
[1:14:29] it wait a minute you're not going to
[1:14:30] treat me bad wait a minute you're not
[1:14:32] going to cuss at me like I just cussed
[1:14:34] at you wait a minute you're not doing
[1:14:36] what you used to do when I did that to
[1:14:37] you I used to be able to do this to you
[1:14:40] because I'd get a rise out of you and it
[1:14:41] it turn into something get big and I'd
[1:14:43] always feel better about myself being
[1:14:45] backslid because you would act unlike a
[1:14:47] Christian whenever I provoked you wait
[1:14:49] why aren't you doing it now you're
[1:14:51] taking away my justification yes because
[1:14:52] you trust in the
[1:14:54] Lord trust in him whether there be
[1:14:58] offenses real or imagined yes made up
[1:15:04] untruths or
[1:15:06] differences that are
[1:15:08] real or maybe just
[1:15:12] worthless maybe it's just
[1:15:15] synthetic maybe it's the devil that went
[1:15:17] in there and rearranged your bed and
[1:15:19] told you your sister did
[1:15:20] it all just to see whether how easily it
[1:15:23] would be for you to
[1:15:24] hate now I'm not saying that literally
[1:15:27] could happen I'm
[1:15:28] just but the things that happen in our
[1:15:31] lives where it's synthetic hate you
[1:15:32] don't hate that person why because
[1:15:35] there's no cause it's not just your
[1:15:38] hatred is reserved for sin your hatred
[1:15:40] reserved for evil and the devil's
[1:15:42] allowed you to project this onto
[1:15:44] something else you said no I'm taking it
[1:15:46] off them I'm taking it off them I'm
[1:15:48] taking it off myself I'm not going to
[1:15:50] even hate
[1:15:51] myself I'm going to love him I'm going
[1:15:53] to trust him I'm going to have
[1:15:54] confidence in
[1:15:56] [Music]
[1:15:57] him because our worth your value your
[1:16:02] security is in
[1:16:04] himen there's Worth to us there's value
[1:16:07] in US there's value in you there's a
[1:16:10] reason to have positive good
[1:16:13] self-esteem there's a lie of the devil
[1:16:15] that wants to turn us into these
[1:16:16] Catholics that are just always beating
[1:16:18] ourselves up and oh wo is me and trying
[1:16:21] to do penants enough of that
[1:16:24] enough of the
[1:16:25] self-hate enough of projecting hate on
[1:16:27] other people because what we hate on
[1:16:29] ourselves enough of hating those that we
[1:16:31] fear and perceive there's enough hate
[1:16:33] because of injury and offenses I'm going
[1:16:35] to trust in
[1:16:37] him this quote just kept coming back up
[1:16:39] to me and surfacing when I was studying
[1:16:41] on this series maybe today we're just
[1:16:43] wrapping this up this
[1:16:45] morning on the subject of hate and where
[1:16:48] is the peace and where's the love
[1:16:49] where's the strength where's the
[1:16:50] confidence Now where's the trust
[1:16:53] I know this might seem to be a little
[1:16:54] bit of a different angle because it's
[1:16:56] not so much looking at hate but it's
[1:16:57] looking at a real proposition says if I
[1:17:00] was going to die in the morning if I was
[1:17:01] sentenced to death if they were building
[1:17:03] The Gallows if they were getting the
[1:17:04] needle ready if they were dusting off
[1:17:06] the chair whatever it might be that's
[1:17:08] going to die in the morning what good
[1:17:09] would it do for me to get all stewed up
[1:17:11] about
[1:17:12] it what value what benefit would it be
[1:17:16] for me to fuss and toew and fret get on
[1:17:19] nervous and worried what if I was going
[1:17:22] to be electrocuted in the morning and my
[1:17:24] life had to end tomorrow what good would
[1:17:26] that do to to work to me what good would
[1:17:30] that do me to worry about
[1:17:33] it there's no value in
[1:17:35] worry it just brings us
[1:17:38] down it it melts us away it's costic
[1:17:41] it's corrosive I can say the same thing
[1:17:43] that's what our fear does right what
[1:17:46] does it lead to
[1:17:48] hate he says well you say what good
[1:17:50] would it do to have faith faith can sign
[1:17:53] my
[1:17:54] pardon what good what good would it do
[1:17:57] he says sure there is value in faith
[1:18:00] don't be weary don't be scared don't be
[1:18:03] upset just have faith and believe that's
[1:18:07] what I'm expressing to you in light of
[1:18:08] this subject that's challenging or heavy
[1:18:11] however you want to look at it don't be
[1:18:12] fearful don't be scared don't be upset
[1:18:16] at what time you're afraid trust in him
[1:18:18] there's no value in your fear there's no
[1:18:20] value in your hatred there's no value in
[1:18:22] your resentment there's no value in your
[1:18:23] word there's no value in
[1:18:30] fretting brother Alfonso I notice sister
[1:18:33] M Soul isn't with us today I see you
[1:18:36] there with your children utum and
[1:18:38] ulyses and there's a promise that your
[1:18:40] wife's going to be sitting next to you
[1:18:42] whatever the reason is she's not here
[1:18:44] there's no fear no fear no worry why
[1:18:48] there's no value in it there's no
[1:18:51] benefit doesn't matter what things could
[1:18:52] be added up and what things could be
[1:18:55] presented it it there's no value I'm not
[1:18:57] going to trust in that I'm not going to
[1:19:00] trust in this I'm not going to trust in
[1:19:01] that I'm not going to trust in the
[1:19:03] forecast I'm not going to trust in the
[1:19:04] symptoms I'm not going to trust in the
[1:19:06] arguments I'm not going to trust in the
[1:19:07] threats if Satan is threatening you
[1:19:09] don't trust in his ability to carry out
[1:19:11] the threat just trust in God's ability
[1:19:13] to see you through it you say well Satan
[1:19:16] I believe you're more than able to do
[1:19:17] exactly what you said you're going to do
[1:19:19] but I trust in my God more to bring me
[1:19:22] through it even to the point where Paul
[1:19:24] felt as if the threats were going to
[1:19:26] take his life and he trusted not in
[1:19:29] himself and he didn't trust in any else
[1:19:31] to save him he didn't even trust that
[1:19:33] God would save him from Death he said I
[1:19:35] trusted in a God that would raise the
[1:19:38] dead Hallelujah Checkmate game over in
[1:19:42] the end my God is able to help me the
[1:19:45] Lord is my
[1:19:48] strength the Lord is my
[1:19:51] helper I will not
[1:19:53] fear trust in him with all that is in
[1:19:56] you and let's be conscious and aware of
[1:19:59] all these little things that happen to
[1:20:00] try to inspire hate and hopefully it's
[1:20:03] give us some some language scriptural
[1:20:05] language and some message materials in
[1:20:08] our heart to hold on to to annihilate
[1:20:13] hate that tries to come around Merry
[1:20:16] Christmas stand with me
