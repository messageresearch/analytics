[0:00] title today is for God so loved just
[0:02] taking it there from John 3:16 and using
[0:06] uh that kind of even with the lips to
[0:08] suggest that there's more that we're
[0:10] looking at or more that's mentioned here
[0:12] but it's for God so loved I think even
[0:15] that phrasing so loved is going to be a
[0:17] little bit important in how I'd like to
[0:18] emphasize this and not wanting to spend
[0:21] much time in review but each one of
[0:23] these are all building together on the
[0:24] subject of perfect love and as we've
[0:28] looked at our relationship to God and
[0:29] his relationship to us or the perfect
[0:31] love that exists from the father to his
[0:33] children, the heavenly father and the
[0:36] children of God. Uh we've looked at that
[0:37] as maybe a horizontal relationship and
[0:40] how that he has a perfect love for us
[0:41] and we're wanting our love to be made
[0:43] perfect for him or have a perfect love
[0:45] towards him. That's the horizontal. But
[0:48] then also the scripture commands us that
[0:50] we must love one another and that the
[0:52] love of God is shed abroad in our
[0:53] hearts. So there's a perfect love in the
[0:55] vertical one to another and from brother
[0:57] to sister and even to mankind. And so
[1:00] we're looking at that and wanting to
[1:02] understand better his love for us uh
[1:05] free our love for him and have a a more
[1:07] perfect love for him and then also have
[1:10] that perfect love one for the other. And
[1:12] I will say this today that this is a
[1:15] setup. And so if you want to get a
[1:17] little bit uh suspicious, I guess I
[1:19] don't mind that. But this is there's a
[1:20] lot in here that's being set up. But I
[1:22] would say it's at least a very critical
[1:24] foundation for where what we're tracking
[1:26] and where we're wanting to go. And I
[1:28] hope that you could just stay real close
[1:29] uh to what we're saying today because I
[1:31] believe it's going to be so simple that
[1:33] you you may just let your thoughts
[1:35] wander a little bit, but really really
[1:37] kind of engage me and really focus and
[1:39] stay with me because I believe the Lord
[1:41] has something tremendous for us. Now in
[1:44] chapter four of the church age book as
[1:45] we've been reading this particular
[1:47] statement in both relationship to the
[1:50] church uh the the church that suffered
[1:52] in martyrdom and through tribulation of
[1:54] the church ages and even the Jews and
[1:56] how they suffered uh at the hand of
[1:58] judgment or even if you want to look at
[1:59] the holocaust uh the question was people
[2:02] say how could God be a loving God if he
[2:04] lets his people suffer. So he says they
[2:06] could not figure out God's love. They
[2:09] thought that love meant no suffering.
[2:11] They thought that love meant a baby with
[2:14] parental care. And so it's almost as if
[2:16] it always stays in that stage where the
[2:18] type of love that a mother has for her
[2:20] newborn or the type of love that parents
[2:22] have for a a baby, an infant, that
[2:25] that's the love that God always has and
[2:27] that's the way that God would treat us.
[2:29] But he says, but he's kind of refuting
[2:31] that notion and he makes this statement
[2:33] that is just so significant. mess might
[2:36] be just uh elective love could have very
[2:38] well been a title that we could have
[2:40] used today but it says God said that his
[2:42] love was elective love and to use that
[2:45] term elective he's drawing from a
[2:48] scriptural principle even using a
[2:49] scriptural word and to say elective we
[2:52] have to think of it this way it was
[2:53] voluntary
[2:54] that it wasn't that God was compelled
[2:56] and forced to love us but it was
[2:58] voluntary because to elect or to be
[3:01] elective it's to choose or to pick out
[3:03] so if I could say this way It's an
[3:05] elective love or it's a selective love.
[3:08] It's a love of discretion.
[3:10] It's a love that's not just, oh well,
[3:12] whatever it is, it doesn't matter. And
[3:14] it's just kind of a I just love
[3:16] everybody, want to put my arms around
[3:17] everybody and an undiscerning uh uh
[3:20] love. There's some people that love
[3:21] food, meaning they'll eat anything,
[3:24] right? And that's not an elective love.
[3:26] That's not a discerning love. That
[3:27] doesn't mean they have a distinguished
[3:29] pallet. They just love to eat, so
[3:30] they'll eat anything. But there's other
[3:32] people who love food and will hardly eat
[3:34] anything because they're discerning in
[3:36] their in their taste and they're they
[3:38] distinguish among things and they love
[3:39] things a particular way. And so that
[3:42] just maybe as an example we can all
[3:43] relate to and everybody's like, "Yeah, I
[3:44] can talk about food all day long,
[3:46] Brother Aaron." So now that we've got
[3:47] everybody's attention, God's love is
[3:50] that way. It is an elective love. So
[3:52] it's a love that has discretion. It's a
[3:54] love that's choosy and it picks. And so
[3:57] when brother Brandham uses the phrase
[3:59] elective love, we we recognize
[4:01] scripturally that God of his own free
[4:04] will before there was creation, he d
[4:07] decreed his love towards specific
[4:10] individuals. And I trust that we're all,
[4:12] you know, believers of the Bible and we
[4:14] can relax when it comes to election and
[4:16] predestination. But God by his own will,
[4:19] free will before any creation, uh,
[4:23] decreed his love for specific people and
[4:25] that is the elect. And that's what God
[4:28] did. God decreed his love towards a
[4:29] specific group of people. And I would
[4:32] say that we could probably all agree
[4:33] that really this love is mysterious.
[4:36] In other words, there's really no
[4:38] explanation that can completely satisfy
[4:40] the question of why.
[4:42] We said that God chose you. And we might
[4:45] all say why. And no matter how much we
[4:48] give, no matter how many explanations we
[4:49] come up with, we probably there's a part
[4:51] of us that then says there's still
[4:53] there's still a mystery to this. I mean,
[4:55] we could use this scripture. We can use
[4:57] this principle, we can use that
[4:58] principle, but there's just something
[4:59] about it that remains almost untouchable
[5:02] because we can't explain it. And brother
[5:05] Brandham in the sermon kinsman redeemer
[5:08] and it's in this sermon he's dealing
[5:09] with Ruth and says there's a hidden
[5:11] revelation in it. It'll draw you closer
[5:13] to God. So it's a love affair. It's a
[5:15] love story. And and he's talking about
[5:17] how that uh he and his wife or I guess
[5:19] they said the kids were uh they were
[5:21] laying in bed a little bit longer. the
[5:22] kids didn't have to go to school and
[5:23] they were talking about answer the
[5:25] question what was hatred and he said
[5:28] hatred had a beginning this was his
[5:30] answer hatred had a beginning now think
[5:32] of that and hold that in your mind
[5:33] hatred had a beginning so it has to have
[5:35] an end
[5:37] now he contrast that love had no
[5:39] beginning so it has no end is forever
[5:42] love is eternal these are important
[5:44] principles as we go forward hatred
[5:46] begins and hatred will end never did
[5:48] begin and it'll never end it's eternal
[5:51] and when a man loves loves a woman and
[5:53] marries her because she's pretty.
[5:55] There'll be an end to that. Now, what is
[5:57] he what is he looking at? Not the love
[5:59] he's talking about. Because you can love
[6:01] somebody because of the way they look or
[6:03] certain characteristics and
[6:04] personalities and say, "Well, why do you
[6:06] love her?" Well, she loves the same food
[6:07] I love and she she does this and she
[6:10] does that. Maybe there's a way that
[6:11] someone can explain it. And he said th
[6:13] that kind of human love is he said that
[6:17] can change. It's temporal. It's
[6:18] conditional. And and there can be an end
[6:20] to that. Even to the extent that the
[6:23] things you love about a person could
[6:24] change or the person that you love for
[6:26] all these reasons they could die. And he
[6:27] said there's an end to that love. He
[6:29] says when a man loves a woman and
[6:30] marries her because she's pretty
[6:31] there'll be an end to that. But when a
[6:32] man finds a woman that he loves he says
[6:34] he don't know why but he loves her.
[6:38] And I believe what he's touching on is
[6:40] maybe hate can be strong and and
[6:42] rational like why do you hate that?
[6:44] Because of this why do you hate them
[6:46] because of that? And he says that love
[6:47] sometimes can be explained. He's he's
[6:49] looking at a human love, but this love
[6:51] that he's talking about is eternal is
[6:53] something that defies explanation
[6:55] ultimately. He says you he don't know
[6:57] why, but he loves her. He says, "And she
[6:59] finds a man that she loves no matter
[7:01] what he looks like." And all all of us
[7:03] said, "Thank God for that."
[7:06] And I think maybe it's even more
[7:08] appropriate saying, you know, she loves
[7:09] him, but even if she doesn't know why,
[7:11] she just does. He says she finds a man
[7:14] that he loves. No matter what he looks
[7:15] like, he loves her, she loves him. He
[7:17] said that's an eternal mate and glory.
[7:19] I believe what he's doing is he's taking
[7:22] a love which is a perfect love and he's
[7:24] and he's taking that and saying that
[7:26] this this union that we see between a
[7:28] man and a woman that love each other
[7:29] that that's a a reflection of a perfect
[7:31] love that's not just tied to human
[7:34] feeling. It's not just explainable by
[7:36] attraction says well he really loves his
[7:38] wife. You're like have you do you know
[7:40] her? She's rich. Of course he loves her.
[7:43] Right? there's maybe not an explanation
[7:45] for it. And so there's a it's a human
[7:48] feeling, human attraction is not the
[7:50] basis for this kind of love. And it's
[7:52] something that he's saying you can't
[7:54] fully explain because he doesn't know
[7:56] why. It's not that he's good-looking.
[7:57] It's not that he's this or she's that,
[7:59] but it's something that is just uh that
[8:02] that is special. It's a special kind of
[8:04] love. And so when John says in 1 John
[8:07] 4:16, "And we have known and believed
[8:10] the love that God hath to us. God is
[8:13] love and he that dwelleth in love
[8:14] dwelleth in God and God in him. When he
[8:17] says we have known and believed, I I I
[8:20] think that we could all say amen to
[8:22] that. But then also recognize that there
[8:24] is more to know, more to believe. And I
[8:26] would say that we must know it to trust
[8:29] it.
[8:30] Doesn't say we just believe God's love.
[8:31] We have to know his love to trust. As
[8:34] brother Bam says, you have to have love
[8:35] fa first to have faith. We must know his
[8:38] love in order to trust it. And we must
[8:40] know it more and trust it more.
[8:43] If if we say that we have a perfect
[8:45] understanding of the love of God, then I
[8:48] would say there would be definitive
[8:49] characteristics of it in our lives
[8:51] because it's that it's that powerful.
[8:54] And so this elective love, as I would
[8:56] even call it, a perfect love is
[8:57] deliberate. I think that's what we were
[8:59] talking about uh uh Wednesday night. It
[9:02] is deliberate. It is intentional. And
[9:04] there there's purpose behind it. And
[9:06] that this love works within God's
[9:08] character. So, it can't act out of
[9:10] character and it it's very protective of
[9:13] God's will and it manifests. So, God
[9:15] loves and therefore it works and it
[9:17] manifests to accomplish his perfect
[9:19] will.
[9:21] Now, as we look at John 3:1 16, I'll
[9:24] read verses 16 and 17 and come to verse
[9:26] 18 here in a moment. Now, we're just
[9:29] going to dive head first into this. It
[9:31] says, "For God so loved." And just by
[9:34] using that to say so loved, doesn't say,
[9:36] "For God loved the world." But it's like
[9:38] for God's so love. We almost can't even
[9:39] say it without saying so because it's so
[9:41] imprinted in our memory. And that's a
[9:43] special love that he gave his only
[9:46] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[9:49] him should not perish but have
[9:51] everlasting life. For God sent not his
[9:54] son into the world to condemn the world
[9:57] but that the world through him might be
[9:59] saved.
[10:00] Amen. Now, this is where it's going to
[10:02] be simple, but stay close with me
[10:03] because I'm not making a distinction
[10:06] that's just to to tickle our ears. But
[10:08] there's something to this, but what's
[10:10] being said here that we have to separate
[10:12] from our traditional understanding or
[10:14] maybe our typical conclusions when we
[10:16] read read that and recognize that
[10:18] there's a layer that God's speaking to
[10:20] that is speaking of a special love.
[10:23] And it's and maybe I'll come back to
[10:25] this in a future service. If if not, I I
[10:28] think this is maybe just enough for you
[10:30] to get to think about thinking about a
[10:31] little bit. But you have his audience is
[10:33] Nicodemus, a Jewish rabbi. And what
[10:37] Jesus is doing is refuting the belief
[10:39] that the Messiah's blessing was only to
[10:41] the Jews.
[10:41] Right?
[10:42] So when I say that, I I'm wanting to
[10:44] kind of point to or just kind of hint at
[10:46] the fact there's a mystery here
[10:48] that Nicodemus doesn't know. And Jesus
[10:50] saying, "Ah, I could talk to you about
[10:51] natural things, you won't even receive
[10:52] that. How can I talk to you about
[10:53] heavenly things?" In other words,
[10:55] there's a tremendous mystery that I'm
[10:56] unfolding or that remains to be seen.
[10:59] And you believe in your mind that the
[11:01] Messiah is only going to be a blessing
[11:03] to the Jews by their bloodline back to
[11:05] Abraham. But he's saying there's a
[11:07] there's a greater mystery there. And
[11:08] this mystery is summed up in this
[11:10] phrase, for God so loved the world. And
[11:13] then in verse 17, that he sent his son
[11:16] into the world. Now, when we read that,
[11:19] we think, oh, that he descended out of
[11:21] heaven and he came into the world. And
[11:23] we're thinking of the cosmos, the
[11:24] mankind, all of humanity, the earth, and
[11:27] there he is in Palestine with a physical
[11:29] presence in a in a geographical location
[11:31] among a physical people. But what that
[11:33] word there is translated to in many
[11:35] other areas is he sent his son to the
[11:38] world or among the world or towards the
[11:41] world, unto the world or also for the
[11:45] world. So it's not just into in the
[11:48] sense that you walk into a room a and
[11:51] and it denotes kind of the space you
[11:53] occupy but it speaks of the purpose that
[11:57] what what he's what he's trying to
[11:59] accomplish. I believe even in the Greek
[12:00] lexicon it kind of has a funny
[12:02] definition where it says um the word for
[12:04] there you have to think about Jesse
[12:06] James is wanted for murder and you think
[12:08] oh in other words he's wanted to conduct
[12:11] a crime like I need Jesse James to kill
[12:13] somebody because he's wanted for murder
[12:16] wanted but it means to it means more to
[12:18] purpose or or a prior event or something
[12:21] that was before why he was wanted. It
[12:23] speaks as to why he was wanted, that
[12:25] he's a wanted man because he's committed
[12:27] murder. When God says he sent his son
[12:29] for the world, it speaks to a greater
[12:31] purpose.
[12:33] And so this is if you if you take notes,
[12:36] this is a moment to write this down and
[12:38] and just keep looking back to this. If
[12:40] at any point it in my preaching I begin
[12:42] to fail, I think if you come back to
[12:44] this and try to think of it in terms of
[12:46] this that this is what we're trying to
[12:47] understand, it'll help. So he says, God
[12:49] so loved the world. God is the lover.
[12:52] The world is the loved.
[12:55] So God so loved. So there is love as
[12:57] I've been studying it that this love
[12:59] we're talking about has to have an
[13:00] object. So God is the love of the world
[13:01] is the love. And this love is expressed
[13:04] it expresses it's expressed in a
[13:06] mysterious paradox because for God so
[13:08] loved the world that he sent his own
[13:10] that he gave his only begotten son. And
[13:12] in Romans chapter 8:32 it's it's not
[13:15] maybe as uh sterile as oh he gave his
[13:19] son like he he loaned him or he he he
[13:21] handed him out. He sent him into the
[13:22] world to be a help. It says he spared
[13:24] not his own son. In other words, he sent
[13:26] his son to as a sacrifice but delivered
[13:28] him up. Notice for us all. So he that
[13:32] spared not his own son but delivered him
[13:33] up for us all. How shall he not with him
[13:36] also freely give us all things?
[13:39] Now the question I want to ask is in
[13:41] Romans 8:32 and then also in John 3:16
[13:44] and 17. Who are the us?
[13:47] Who's the us all? What what is this
[13:50] world?
[13:52] And I think that's the question that's
[13:53] at the heart of the question today. For
[13:55] God so loved and it says he so loved the
[13:57] world. What is this world that God
[13:59] loved?
[14:00] And we're wanting to consider the
[14:02] dynamics between the lover and the
[14:03] loved. God is the lover. The that's God
[14:07] the world that he loved. That's the
[14:09] loved. And now these are these are the
[14:12] these are the statements that I'm
[14:14] wanting to build on. The love of God has
[14:17] an elected elective object.
[14:20] Brother Bam said his love is elective.
[14:23] And so it's a love that he has for us.
[14:24] So the love of God has this perfect love
[14:27] has an elective object, an elected
[14:29] object. That would be the subject of
[14:31] God's love. So God is the lover and the
[14:34] world is the love. That means his love
[14:36] is to someone.
[14:37] It is for someone. And then not only
[14:40] does it have an elective object, but it
[14:43] is it has a predestinated objective.
[14:47] So it's not just love for someone, but
[14:49] it also has an objective for that
[14:52] object. It is an elective object and a
[14:54] predestinated objective. And so as we
[14:56] read here that he that believeth on him
[14:58] should not perish but have everlasting
[15:00] life. The love of God then uh faith in
[15:03] Christ and eternal life are the benefits
[15:06] for the subjects of God's elective love
[15:09] as we read this for God so loved the
[15:11] world and he gives his only begotten son
[15:13] and this God who is the lover has this
[15:15] love for the world and the benefits are
[15:17] faith in Jesus Christ and eternal life
[15:20] [snorts]
[15:20] and as it says that he he sent his son
[15:22] into the world not to condemn the world
[15:24] but that the world through him might be
[15:26] saved his love God so loved as the lover
[15:30] having love having love for the object.
[15:32] So the lover to the loved with that love
[15:34] dynamic. His love cannot condemn the
[15:37] object.
[15:39] Just draw I'm just drawing all these
[15:41] very simple principles out of this verse
[15:42] before we continue. His love cannot
[15:44] condemn the object. This love in being
[15:48] unable to condemn the object can only
[15:50] redeem the object. Amen.
[15:52] For God so loved the world and as he
[15:56] loves as the lover and the loved the
[15:58] dynamics of that relationship are such
[16:00] that no matter what condition listen
[16:02] we've got to understand this absolute.
[16:05] No matter what condition the world found
[16:07] it itself in that world that he's
[16:09] talking about GOD COULD NOT REJECT it
[16:12] because he could not condemn it.
[16:14] HIS LOVE REQUIRED REDEMPTION of it.
[16:16] Amen.
[16:17] This is what is meant in this verse that
[16:20] God so loved he had such a love for this
[16:23] world that even in its deplorable state
[16:25] he had to send a sacrifice to redeem it
[16:28] because the lover for the love required
[16:31] it.
[16:33] And therefore
[16:35] this is where maybe it starts to get a
[16:37] little deep at least a notch. The object
[16:39] of perfect love is therefore eternal
[16:43] because it says that he should never
[16:44] perish. He that believeth in him should
[16:46] not perish. This is this is what's
[16:48] happening when you look at this
[16:49] scripture. The object for God so loved
[16:51] the world. So he that believeth the
[16:54] object of this perfect love is therefore
[16:56] eternal because it can never be ruined.
[16:58] It can never be destroyed.
[17:00] Can never be rejected. That's what
[17:02] perish means. It's it's ruined. It's
[17:03] it's past use.
[17:06] Now then this once we've come to that
[17:08] place that God so loved and so the lover
[17:11] to the loved begins to raise in this
[17:14] scripture alone begins to identify
[17:15] certain principles about perfect love.
[17:17] As brother Bradom said hatred had a
[17:19] beginning and so hatred has an end and
[17:21] love has no beginning so love has no
[17:24] end. Hatred is temporal.
[17:27] Why? Because the object of hate is not
[17:30] eternal.
[17:31] Amen.
[17:32] that whatever whatever there's hatred
[17:34] towards it's going to end. It's temporal
[17:37] because the object of hate is temporal
[17:39] as well. I think that's I think it's a
[17:41] notch deeper
[17:43] and that could just be me because my
[17:45] understanding is growing. But hate is
[17:47] temporal because the object of hate is
[17:49] not eternal. But this sole love, this
[17:51] special love is an eternal love because
[17:54] the object of that love is also eternal.
[17:56] Amen.
[17:58] And so we know that imperfect love or
[18:00] perverted love as brother Brandon calls
[18:01] it, human love will have an end. And so
[18:04] these other things, hatred is is
[18:06] temporary because the object of hatred
[18:09] will have an end. Therefore, hate is not
[18:12] eternal. So God so loved the world, he
[18:15] gives his son. He spares not his son. He
[18:17] gives him as a sacrifice. That he that
[18:19] believeth on him should not perish but
[18:20] have everlasting life. He sent his son
[18:23] for the world, not to condemn the world,
[18:26] but that the world would be saved.
[18:29] So the lover,
[18:31] his love to the loved
[18:34] requires salvation and redemption.
[18:37] But now verse 18 interrupts that. He
[18:41] that believeth on him is not condemned,
[18:47] but he that believeth not is condemned
[18:49] already because he hath not believed. in
[18:51] the name of the only begotten son of
[18:53] God. I think this scripture alone after
[18:56] saying that God so loved the world and
[18:59] so it speaks of this God who just loves
[19:01] the loves the world then all of a sudden
[19:03] someone in that world doesn't believe me
[19:04] he's like oh fine if you're not going to
[19:05] believe in me I'm just going to kill you
[19:08] and that's maybe how we start
[19:09] interpreting in our minds that this that
[19:11] all of a sudden God if his love is
[19:13] rebuff rebuffed he gets angry and he
[19:15] gets vindictive
[19:17] he that believeth on him is not
[19:19] condemned
[19:20] but he that believeth not is condemned
[19:22] already
[19:23] wow
[19:24] They that believe are part of the
[19:26] mystery of the world that God loves.
[19:28] Amen.
[19:29] Amen.
[19:30] They that believe are part of the
[19:31] mystery of the world that God loves. The
[19:33] unbelievers condemned because he's not
[19:35] an object of that love.
[19:38] This is I I know I'm going to say this
[19:39] is the plain English.
[19:41] But some of you might say, I've I've
[19:42] read every translation there is where
[19:43] there and I I've been reading the
[19:44] message. I've been getting into the
[19:45] message Bible so I can get more into the
[19:47] message and listen to the message on
[19:48] SiriusXM and I've never seen it this
[19:50] way. But listen, this is what the
[19:52] scriptur is saying. That he that is
[19:55] condemned, he that believeth not is
[19:56] condemned already. Why? Because he's NOT
[19:58] THE OBJECT OF GOD'S REDEEMING LOVE.
[20:01] THAT'S WHY HE'S CONDEMNED. But they that
[20:04] believe are part of the mystery of the
[20:06] world that God loves.
[20:08] So this is what it leads leads us to.
[20:10] There's two different worlds.
[20:13] The one you think I'm living on and the
[20:15] one you think you're living on.
[20:17] No, the two different worlds. There's a
[20:19] world of love that speaks of redemption.
[20:22] But then there's a world of hate that
[20:24] speaks of condemnation. A world of faith
[20:26] is another way to describe that world.
[20:28] Uh which is the world of love. And a
[20:30] world of unbelief, which is the world
[20:32] that's condemned. So there so the the
[20:35] term world could be used in many
[20:36] different ways. And this is where the
[20:39] translators who translate it are doing
[20:40] their best to kind of catch what God is
[20:44] intending or what the writer intends by
[20:45] it.
[20:47] And I have a complete confidence in the
[20:49] Holy Spirit who wrote the Bible
[20:51] that preserved it
[20:52] to quicken to me the truth and the
[20:54] meaning of it. Not that I need to change
[20:56] any meaning at all. Can it can stay
[20:58] right here in the King James format. I
[20:59] can read in another language. And I just
[21:01] know that God will reveal his truth to
[21:03] his own.
[21:04] Amen.
[21:04] And this term world, we could use it to
[21:06] refer to the earth itself natural, all
[21:08] of humanity and mankind. We could start
[21:10] to think of ways that it might be
[21:11] referring to. But you can use the term
[21:13] world as its use in the scripture to
[21:16] refer to a specific group of people.
[21:19] It's a way of referring to something
[21:20] collectively. And so there's two
[21:23] different worlds that begin to emerge as
[21:25] we look at this. For God so loved the
[21:26] world. This is the world that God loved.
[21:28] But then there's those that are
[21:29] condemned that are part of this
[21:31] condemnation. And the Bible says in 1
[21:34] John 2:15, just so this could kind of be
[21:37] the first uh uh push to this idea that
[21:41] this world that God loves is a special
[21:43] love for a special world. The Bible
[21:46] tells us, "Love not the world,
[21:48] neither the things that are in the
[21:50] world." If any man love the world, the
[21:52] love of the father is not in him.
[21:55] Believe it's in James 4:4 that says,
[21:57] "Friendship of the world is enmity with
[21:59] God. Therefore, whoever is a friend of
[22:01] the world is an enemy of God.
[22:03] So, it puts this affinity and connection
[22:06] with the world as hatred between God and
[22:09] you. And it says, "Love not the world,
[22:12] neither the things of the world that are
[22:14] in the world. And if any man love the
[22:17] world, the love of the father is not in
[22:18] him." Now, this to me becomes one of
[22:20] these things where it says, "Wait a
[22:21] minute. John 3:16 says, "FOR GOD WHO IS
[22:24] THE FATHER, SO LOVED THE WORLD."
[22:27] AND NOW I'M TOLD THAT I CAN'T LOVE THE
[22:29] world because if I do, THE LOVE OF THE
[22:31] FATHER IS NOT IN ME. When the very red
[22:33] LETTER I READ TELLS ME THAT THE FATHER
[22:35] LOVED THE WORLD AND THAT'S WHY HE SENT
[22:37] HIS SON.
[22:38] THEREFORE, and that represents there
[22:40] there's a contradiction, right? There's
[22:42] a that's a like A BLACK AND WHITE
[22:44] contradiction or red and black. I don't
[22:46] know. I'm getting my my my colors
[22:48] confused. But there's a direct
[22:49] CONTRADICTION TO THE LETTERS ON THIS
[22:51] PAPER. FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, BUT
[22:53] IF YOU LOVE the world, you don't have
[22:54] the love of God in you. say, "Well, I I
[22:57] need some help here."
[22:58] It's because it's a different world.
[23:01] The world that God loves must be
[23:03] different than the world that we should
[23:04] not love.
[23:05] The world that God loves must be a that
[23:07] must be a SPECIAL KIND OF LOVE. A and
[23:10] and a special kind of world than the
[23:12] world that we ought not to be friends
[23:13] with, than the world that is an enemy to
[23:14] God. A world that that um it produces
[23:17] that hatred between God and itself.
[23:21] Notice how Jesus uh prays in John
[23:23] chapter 17 6 to10. I have manifested thy
[23:27] name unto the men which thou gavest me
[23:31] out of the world.
[23:33] Thine they were and thou gavest them me
[23:36] and they have kept thy word. So there's
[23:38] love uh is the is operative in choosing
[23:43] the love seized upon them. They keep the
[23:45] word that is the love of God. Now they
[23:47] have known that all things whatsoever
[23:49] thou hast given me are of thee. For I
[23:51] have given unto them the words which
[23:53] thou gavest me, and they received them.
[23:55] Now notice how this kind of marries with
[23:57] John 3:16. For God so loved the world
[23:59] that he that believeth should not
[24:00] perish. The word word has come to them.
[24:03] They've received it and and they have
[24:05] received them and they have known surely
[24:07] that I came out from thee and they have
[24:09] believed that thou did ascend me. I pray
[24:12] for them.
[24:14] I pray not for the world, but for them
[24:17] which thou hast given me. For they are
[24:19] thine, and all mine are thine, and thine
[24:22] are mine, and I am glorified in them.
[24:25] So Jesus did not pray for the whole
[24:27] world.
[24:29] So what it says, for God so loved the
[24:30] world, THAT'S A A DIFFERENT world than
[24:32] the one that Jesus says, I PRAY NOT FOR
[24:35] THE WORLD. HE DID NOT PRAY FOR ALL OF
[24:37] MANKIND or all of humanity. He did not
[24:39] pray for the whole earth or this cosmos,
[24:42] but he prayed for the loved
[24:44] for God so loved the world. There's a
[24:46] mystery of to what that world is. THAT'S
[24:49] THE WORLD THAT GOD LOVED. THAT'S THE
[24:51] WORLD THAT JESUS WAS PRAYING FOR. AND
[24:53] HERE HE SAYS, I PRAY FOR THEM THAT THOU
[24:55] HAS GIVEN ME OUT OF THIS OTHER WORLD.
[24:58] This world of hatred, this world of
[25:00] temporal love, this world of a perverted
[25:02] love.
[25:03] I pray for them. I don't pray FOR THE
[25:05] WORLD. I DON'T PRAY FOR EVERYONE. AND I
[25:06] PRAY specifically for those that thou
[25:08] hast given me.
[25:10] Amen.
[25:11] In 2 Corinthians chapter 5 18 and 19, it
[25:14] says, "And all things are of God,
[25:16] who hath reconciled us to himself by
[25:19] Jesus Christ,
[25:22] and hath given to us the ministry of
[25:24] reconciliation,
[25:25] to it that God was in Christ,
[25:28] reconciling the world unto himself, not
[25:32] imputing their trespasses unto them, and
[25:35] hath committed unto us the word of
[25:38] reconciliation."
[25:39] Now, I'm using this scripture again to
[25:41] emphasize reconciling the world unto
[25:43] himself. We might think, "Oh, that's all
[25:45] of humanity." And did you know there's
[25:48] branches of theology within Christianity
[25:50] that believe that everyone is going to
[25:52] be saved?
[25:53] That all of humanity, all of mankind,
[25:55] everyone's going to be redeemed,
[25:56] everyone's going to be restored, and
[25:57] everybody's going to live in the love of
[25:59] God and the presence of God. And it's
[26:00] because they take these verses and they
[26:02] say, "Well, the blood of Jesus Christ is
[26:04] efficacious and the blood of Jesus
[26:05] Christ is powerful and he purged all he
[26:07] bought everyone's sins and he paid the
[26:09] price for everyone's sins and therefore
[26:10] having loved the world and reconciled
[26:12] the world to himself. Hey, listen buddy,
[26:14] whether you like it or not, you're just
[26:16] going to be a beautiful eternal
[26:17] Christian over there, right? And they
[26:19] just look at it that way."
[26:21] And and that's that that's the idea um
[26:24] that they have in their minds is that
[26:26] you know all the John Wayne Gasey's and
[26:28] uh Jeffrey Dmers and all those that no
[26:30] matter what they believed and what they
[26:32] did in life and the lack of repentance,
[26:33] they're all just going to be over there
[26:34] saying, "Yeah, didn't expect to be
[26:36] here." Yeah. I don't know. This is good
[26:39] love. THIS IS GREAT. I'M ENJOYING IT.
[26:41] SEEN AN AXE LATELY? [laughter]
[26:45] That's right.
[26:47] But he's talking about the world. I want
[26:50] you to think of the world that he's
[26:51] reconciling.
[26:53] He's reconciling the world unto himself.
[26:55] What world is this? And it's all within
[26:57] this through the ministry of Jesus
[27:00] Christ. HATH RECONCILED US TO HIMSELF BY
[27:02] JESUS CHRIST.
[27:04] NOW, this is love. This is the elective
[27:06] love. And when you see Jesus Christ, I
[27:09] want you to be thinking about THE LOVE
[27:10] OF GOD because brother says Jesus Christ
[27:12] is the love of God.
[27:13] He says Jesus Christ is God's heart. In
[27:17] the first seal, he says that and he says
[27:18] this in different places, a number of
[27:19] different ways. I used to think years
[27:20] ago that maybe God was angry with me,
[27:23] but Christ loved me, right? He says that
[27:25] in a number of places. I thought God was
[27:26] angry with me. And Christ is kind of
[27:27] over THERE SAYING, "WAIT, HOLD ON.
[27:29] STOP." NO, NO, BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE.
[27:31] CUZ IT'S NOT AN ANGRY GOD WHO'S JUST MAD
[27:33] AT ALL OF US AND mad of all humanity.
[27:35] And Jesus said, "Look, if I die, will
[27:37] that settled it? Will you be happy if I
[27:38] JUST OFF MYSELF?" THAT'S NOT THE THAT'S
[27:41] NOT THE PARADIGM. NO. GOD SO LOVED THAT
[27:43] HE SENT THAT SON. AMEN.
[27:44] And he says, "I used to think God was
[27:46] angry AT ME AND CHRIST LOVED ME." HE
[27:47] SAYS, "BUT CHRIST IS THE VERY HEART OF
[27:50] GOD."
[27:52] So where there where there's a
[27:54] REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST, THAT'S A
[27:56] REVELATION OF CHARITY. That's the
[27:57] revelation of the heart of God.
[27:59] What's at the very center of God? Now
[28:01] ponder that implication.
[28:04] And so he says that he hath reconciled
[28:06] us to HIMSELF BY JESUS CHRIST, BY HIS
[28:09] LOVE, BY HIS HEART. He has reconciled
[28:12] the world. and think of the two
[28:13] different worlds and we're talking about
[28:14] that world that he loves reconciled the
[28:17] world to himself.
[28:18] Reconciliation means atonement.
[28:20] Something's been atoned for.
[28:22] For there to be reconciliation, it's the
[28:24] restoration of favor.
[28:26] The word speaks of the adjustment of a
[28:29] difference.
[28:30] So where there's been a difference and
[28:32] there's reconciliation, the difference
[28:34] has been accounted for.
[28:36] Like when you which I know we all do, we
[28:38] get out our check ledger, right?
[28:40] We you're doing that, right? You get out
[28:41] your physical check ledger and you write
[28:43] and you're you're going to check the
[28:44] ledger and reconcile everything and
[28:46] reconcile what everything you've done.
[28:48] And when you reconcile, you oh well, I'm
[28:50] off by 40 bucks. No, you find out where
[28:53] the difference is.
[28:54] You find out why. What makes the
[28:56] difference? HOW CAN I RECONCILE THIS
[28:58] expectation from this reality? Where is
[29:00] it wrong? And so, it's the adjustment of
[29:02] the difference to make things line up.
[29:04] So, now this is a this is important as I
[29:07] look at this word reconciliation. For
[29:09] God so loved and this is the very heart
[29:12] of God. The very love of God is Jesus
[29:14] Christ. And so Jesus Christ is the
[29:16] reconciliation or the adjustment of the
[29:18] difference. Perfect love. This is THE
[29:20] NATURE OF PERFECT LOVE. IT WILL ALWAYS
[29:23] REMOVE the barrier
[29:25] between the lover and the loved. AMEN.
[29:27] AMEN.
[29:28] GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT WHEN HE
[29:30] FOUND THE WORLD IN DEFICIT, THIS ONE
[29:32] THAT HE LOVED, HE DIDN'T JUST START OVER
[29:34] WITH A NEW WORLD, BUT HE SAID, "LOVE
[29:37] DOESN'T JUST MOVE ON. Love looks AT THE
[29:40] SITUATIONS. I'VE GOT TO ADJUST THE
[29:42] DIFFERENCE.
[29:43] I'VE GOT TO REMOVE the barrier. I'M THE
[29:46] LOVER. THEY'RE THE LOVE. SOMETHING IS
[29:48] BETWEEN US." AND WHAT MY LOVE WILL DO IS
[29:50] IT WILL NOT GET IMPATIENT. IT WILL NOT
[29:52] GIVE UP. IT WON'T SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
[29:54] BUT IT'LL FIND THE THING THAT'S CAUSING
[29:56] THE ENMITY IN THE DISAGREEMENT. AND
[29:59] PERFECT LOVE REMOVES THE BARRIER BETWEEN
[30:01] THE LOVER AND THE LOVE.
[30:05] Wherever there's disagreement, wherever
[30:06] there's hate, wherever there's
[30:07] animosity, wherever there's
[30:08] misunderstanding, perfect love says,
[30:10] "I'm not going to give up until we've
[30:11] adjusted the difference."
[30:15] I know there may be times in our lives
[30:17] where we say, "Well, if this is the way
[30:18] that it is, I'll just live with it."
[30:22] But I believe perfect love desires to
[30:24] see the adjustment,
[30:26] the reconciliation,
[30:29] it says in Romans chapter 5:es 8 to10,
[30:33] it says, "For God commendeth his love
[30:35] towards us, he proved it to us in that
[30:38] while we were yet sinners." Now that's
[30:40] at the heart of this. And you think,
[30:42] well, why why why was the writers
[30:45] constantly trying to point us to the
[30:48] prior to the before?
[30:51] So that if I could just maybe interject
[30:53] this
[30:55] that if
[30:57] if it wasn't I think if the scripture
[30:58] wasn't so direct, I'm pretty certain
[31:01] that some of us if at the very least not
[31:04] just at least the neighbors in the
[31:06] apartment next door would think that
[31:08] they had something to do with it,
[31:10] right? Oh yeah, I know why he loves me
[31:12] because I bought into this. I bought
[31:15] into this. I believed it. I accepted it.
[31:17] And that's why he loves me.
[31:18] But he says while we were yet sinners,
[31:20] Christ died for us.
[31:21] So his act of sending Christ was not uh
[31:26] there was it was not conditioned upon
[31:28] the fact that now something has happened
[31:32] a and therefore now oh now I'll do it.
[31:35] Like I I had uh I I don't know why I'm
[31:37] sharing this story. I don't know if I've
[31:38] ever shared this publicly, but there was
[31:40] a church that was looking for a pastor
[31:43] and and so they called me and said,
[31:46] "Now,
[31:48] if we were interested in you, would you
[31:50] be interested in us?" I was like, "Are
[31:51] we 17 years old?
[31:54] I mean, are are we passing notes to each
[31:56] other in class?"
[31:58] Cuz I mean, if you liked me, I might
[32:00] like you.
[32:02] I'm like, that's juvenile.
[32:03] That's childish. HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS GROW
[32:05] UP, RIGHT? find a little bit of
[32:08] direction in your life and give me a
[32:09] call
[32:10] when you figure something out. Cuz it
[32:12] was almost as if cuz if you would be
[32:14] interested, I think we might be
[32:15] interested. Ain't ain't the way God did
[32:17] it.
[32:18] God said, "You know what? I love them."
[32:20] And and someone's like them. He's like,
[32:21] "Yeah, them." Like, you do know. Yeah. I
[32:23] DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I DO. I LOVE HIM.
[32:26] AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FOR HIM IS
[32:27] I'M GOING TO DIE FOR HIM.
[32:29] THAT'S THAT'S WHAT IT WAS that he he had
[32:31] this great love. WHILE WE WERE YET
[32:33] SINNERS, CHRIST DIED FOR US. NOW MUCH
[32:35] MORE THAN being now justified by his
[32:37] blood. We shall be saved from wrath
[32:38] through him. It's at the very beginning
[32:40] of this chapter. He talks about that we
[32:42] have peace with God.
[32:44] And and even this peace as Paul talks
[32:46] about in Ephesians, IT'S BROKEN DOWN THE
[32:48] MIDDLE wall partition BETWEEN THOSE WHO
[32:50] ONCE HATED EACH OTHER BETWEEN JEW AND
[32:51] GENTILE THAT THE WRATH OF GOD BEING
[32:54] PLACATED of the wrath that was directed
[32:55] TOWARDS US WHO WERE IN SIN THAT'S BEEN
[32:57] ABOLISHED. HE SAYS NOW THERE'S NO MORE
[32:59] HATRED IN THE BODY OF CHRIST BETWEEN JEW
[33:01] AND GENTILE. AMEN.
[33:03] He says, "WHILE WE SINNERS, HE DIED to
[33:05] save us and then that through THAT
[33:06] JUSTIFYING BLOOD, WE'RE SAVED FROM
[33:08] WRATH."
[33:08] AMEN.
[33:10] For while for if when we were sinners,
[33:13] we were reconciled to God by the death
[33:14] of his son. Much more being reconciled,
[33:16] we shall be saved by his life.
[33:18] So much more there I'd like to amplify,
[33:20] but let me just say this. The immity is
[33:21] gone.
[33:23] That whatever whatever was there between
[33:25] God, the lover, and the loved, it's now
[33:27] gone. And we have peace with God.
[33:28] Amen. that there was there was something
[33:30] maybe THAT REQUIRED JUDGMENT. THERE
[33:32] MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT SAID,
[33:34] "WELL, THERE'S THERE has to be
[33:35] condemnation. THIS IS WHAT THE WORD SAYS
[33:37] and this is the circumstance, THIS
[33:38] SITUATION." AND GOD SO LOVED THAT HE
[33:41] SAID, "WELL, I HAVE A LOVE AND IT MUST
[33:43] ADJUST THE DIFFERENCE."
[33:47] This is this is the world that God
[33:49] loved. This is the world that's being
[33:51] reconciled unto himself. This is the
[33:53] world
[33:55] that is not condemned. Remember how in
[33:58] John chapter 1 vers 29 that says the
[34:00] next day John seeth Jesus coming and say
[34:02] behold the lamb of God that takes away
[34:04] the sins of the world.
[34:05] What world was he talking about?
[34:09] Says in John 6:33, for the bread of God
[34:11] is he which cometh down from heaven and
[34:12] giveth life unto the world,
[34:15] but not all receive life.
[34:18] It's the world that God loves. It's not
[34:20] all men that are sinless or become
[34:23] sinless. It's not all men that are given
[34:25] life. Would we agree?
[34:29] It's a different world.
[34:31] 2 Thessalonians chapter 2,
[34:33] I'd like I'll start with verse 10. I
[34:36] might stop short, but it says in verse
[34:38] 10, "And with all so talking about the
[34:41] Antichrist spirit at the end time that's
[34:43] deceiving." And notice how his where his
[34:45] power of deception works. And with all
[34:47] deceivleness of unrighteousness in them
[34:50] that perish. Now, we could take John
[34:52] 3:16 and know that for God so loved the
[34:55] world that to them that believe, they're
[34:56] part of the mystery of the world that
[34:57] God loved, they do not perish. And so,
[35:00] there's a group that does perish.
[35:02] All right?
[35:03] And we're doing spiritual math here.
[35:06] Then they're not part of that elective
[35:08] love
[35:09] because they receive not the love of the
[35:11] truth that they might be saved.
[35:13] So those that perish were not the
[35:15] beneficiaries of the love of the truth
[35:17] that they might be saved. And for this
[35:19] cause, God shall send them strong
[35:20] delusion that they should believe a lie.
[35:23] What's the protection from uh the
[35:25] deception? THE LOVE OF THE TRUTH.
[35:28] Being loved by the truth, BEING LOVERS
[35:30] OF the truth, your protection, your
[35:31] inoculation IS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR
[35:34] THE ELECT TO BE DECEIVED. And that's
[35:36] because the lover's love for the loved.
[35:38] Amen.
[35:39] Amen.
[35:40] The dynamics of his love. He says that
[35:42] THEY SHOULD ALL ALL MIGHT BE DAMNED WHO
[35:45] BELIEVED not the TRUTH BUT HAD PLEASURE
[35:47] IN UNRIGHTEOUSNESS.
[35:50] That's a that's a specific group of
[35:51] people
[35:52] that that refers to groups of people
[35:54] that are going to perish who will be
[35:55] damned and even in the last days be GOD
[35:58] WILL SEND CONFOUND their delusion even
[36:00] more because they don't love truth. Yes.
[36:03] But in verse 13, Paul says, "But we are
[36:06] bound to give thanks always to God for
[36:10] you, brethren, beloved of the Lord."
[36:13] Amen.
[36:15] BECAUSE GOD HATH FROM THE BEGINNING
[36:18] chosen you to salvation through
[36:21] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[36:23] of the truth.
[36:24] Do you realize what Paul has done? He
[36:26] said, "There is a group of people who
[36:28] believe not
[36:29] and that those people will perish.
[36:32] because they don't have a love for the
[36:33] truth. They didn't receive it that they
[36:34] might be saved. Says, "And there and
[36:36] then not only are those that believe not
[36:38] the truth, they're going to be damned.
[36:39] But this delusion is going to come on
[36:41] them because they had pleasure in
[36:42] righteousness." And he's describing to
[36:44] people that are ordained to
[36:45] condemnation, that are going to perish,
[36:46] that don't love the truth, that they
[36:48] don't love God, and then before anybody
[36:50] can make any judgments as to why they're
[36:52] any different, HE SAYS, "BUT GOD CHOSE
[36:54] YOU TO NOT BE THAT WAY."
[36:57] That they're going to perish, AND THEY
[36:59] DON'T LOVE THE TRUTH, HE SAYS, "BUT GOD
[37:01] CHOSE YOU FROM THE BEGINNING TO RECEIVE
[37:03] A LOVE OF THE TRUTH THAT YOU MIGHT BE
[37:05] SAVED." BUT BRETHREN, YOU ARE DIFFERENT
[37:07] BECAUSE FROM THE BEGINNING, GOD CHOSE
[37:09] YOU TO SALVATION. HOW? BECAUSE HE CHOSE
[37:11] YOU TO BE SANCTIFIED BY THE SPIRIT
[37:13] THROUGH THE BELIEVING of the truth.
[37:15] Amen.
[37:16] What is it that brother teaches us? The
[37:18] predestinated are the only ones that's
[37:20] in considered in redemption.
[37:23] Redemption is a special thing.
[37:25] Now, when I say redemption, we're not
[37:26] even talking about living eternally, but
[37:28] we're talking about bringing back
[37:29] something.
[37:30] Amen.
[37:31] Predestinate the predestined the only
[37:32] ones considered in redemption.
[37:36] John 12:es 47 to 48. I hope this is
[37:39] things are are kind of lining up
[37:41] together in how that there's these two
[37:44] different worlds. The one that God loves
[37:46] and the one that he doesn't.
[37:49] John 12:es 47 and 48 says, "And if any
[37:52] man hear my words and believe not, I
[37:54] judge him not. For I came not to judge
[37:58] the world, but to save the world.
[38:01] He that rejectth me and receiveth not my
[38:03] words hath one that judgeth him. The
[38:06] word that I have spoken, the same shall
[38:08] judge him in the last day. That's why
[38:10] they're going to be judged by Jesus
[38:12] Christ. The word.
[38:13] Amen.
[38:14] So there is a judgment for those who are
[38:16] not the object
[38:18] of elective love.
[38:20] Says, "I come not to judge the world."
[38:22] Now, I think there's almost
[38:25] uh
[38:26] a double meaning in that
[38:28] because his coming does not condemn the
[38:31] world that he loves. Right?
[38:35] But his coming condemns those who reject
[38:37] him.
[38:39] Because he says, "If you reject me,
[38:41] you've got one that'll judge. And it's
[38:42] the words that I spoke. It's my father
[38:44] uh uh who will judge you. It's Jesus. He
[38:45] He'll judge all men by Jesus Christ." So
[38:47] there's a world that is judged, a world
[38:49] that is condemned. This is not the world
[38:50] that God loves. 1 Peter chapter 2:es 4
[38:53] and 5, just so we could see this uh
[38:55] dichotomy between these worlds. For God
[38:57] spared not the angels that sinned, but
[38:59] cast them down to hell and delivered
[39:01] them into chains of darkness to be
[39:02] reserved unto judgment. So there's those
[39:04] that are reserved under judgment.
[39:06] As Jude says, for ordained for ordained
[39:08] to condemnation, and spare not the old
[39:10] world that saved Noah, the eighth
[39:12] person, a preacher, the eighth person, a
[39:14] preacher of righteousness, bringing in
[39:16] the flood upon the world of the ungodly.
[39:20] There's an ungodly world. There's an
[39:21] unbelieving world. There's an unelected
[39:23] world. THERE'S A WORLD THAT IT DOES not
[39:25] is not the beneficiaries of this
[39:27] elective love or this specific love
[39:29] where it SAYS FOR GOD SO LOVED THE
[39:32] WORLD. WHAT WORLD WAS he talking about?
[39:34] Not the world of the ungodly. Not the
[39:35] world of the unbeliever. Not the WORLD
[39:37] THAT REJECTS IT. BUT IF I COULD JUST SAY
[39:39] IN PART BECAUSE THERE'S MORE TO IT THAT
[39:41] THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS THAT MADE UP THAT
[39:43] WORLD.
[39:44] INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PART OF THE MYSTERY
[39:46] OF THAT WORLD. AND THAT'S WHAT GOD
[39:48] LOVED.
[39:49] AMEN.
[39:51] as he said, I come not to judge the
[39:53] world, but to save the world.
[39:56] And there's those that are rever
[39:57] reserved under judgment. And there is a
[39:58] word that will judge them.
[40:01] Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11:32,
[40:04] but when we are judged,
[40:07] we are chasened of the Lord.
[40:09] That we should not be condemned with the
[40:13] world.
[40:14] Two different worlds.
[40:16] A redeemed world and a condemned world.
[40:19] The redeemed world is not beyond
[40:20] chastisement. It is not beyond being
[40:22] judged. But he's saying when we are
[40:24] judged, we are chasened.
[40:27] But when the world is judged, it's
[40:29] condemned.
[40:30] When the WORLD THAT GOD LOVES IS JUDGED,
[40:33] it's corrected.
[40:34] When the world that hates God is judged,
[40:37] it's condemned.
[40:39] WHY? BECAUSE THE LOVER AND THE LOVED,
[40:41] PERFECT LOVE REQUIRES THE REMOVAL OF ANY
[40:45] BARRIER BETWEEN THE LOVER AND THE LOVED.
[40:47] AND SO WHEN GOD CORRECTS, IT'S TO REMOVE
[40:50] BARRIERS. WHEN GOD JUDGES, IT'S TO
[40:52] PROMOTE HARMONY and union AND
[40:54] RESTORATION. THAT GOD'S LOVE FOR THE
[40:57] LOVED REQUIRES REDEMPTION. IT CANNOT
[41:01] CONDEMN.
[41:02] IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S NO WAY, IF YOU
[41:03] COULD JUST CATCH THE ABSOLUTE OF THIS,
[41:05] THERE'S NO WAY THAT IN GOD LOVING YOU,
[41:07] HE COULD EVER LOVE YOU IN SUCH A WAY TO
[41:09] REJECT YOU. THERE'S NO WAY THAT GOD CAN
[41:12] EVER MANIFEST HIS LOVE TOWARDS YOU THAT
[41:14] WOULD CONDEMN YOU, PUSH YOU AWAY, SEND
[41:16] YOU TO HELL, BANISH YOU FOREVER. THAT'S
[41:18] NOT WHAT PERFECT LOVE CAN DO.
[41:22] It's impossible.
[41:24] When we are judged, it's a function of
[41:27] God's love that is restorative.
[41:30] When we ARE JUDGED, NOW NOTICE I'm I'm
[41:32] clearly making a difference here. And
[41:34] for those who would reject election,
[41:36] reject predestination, uh this sermon
[41:39] hasn't been working well for them from
[41:40] the beginning.
[41:42] But when God's perfect love, when he
[41:45] corrects, WHEN HE JUDGES, when we are
[41:47] judged, HIS JUDGMENT IS A FUNCTION OF
[41:50] PERFECT LOVE THAT IS RESTORATIVE.
[41:54] BUT THEN THE SAME GOD WILL JUDGE THE
[41:56] UNBELIEVER AND IT'S CONDEMNING.
[41:59] BUT WHEN GOD JUDGES ONE HE LOVES, IT'S
[42:01] REMEDIAL. BUT WHEN GOD JUDGES SOMEONE
[42:04] WHO HATES HIM, IT'S PUNISHMENT.
[42:07] It's retribution.
[42:10] Proverbs 3:12, for whom the Lord loveth,
[42:12] he correcteth. Even as a father the son
[42:14] in whom he delightth, the correction is
[42:17] the proof of God's love. As a father
[42:20] punishes a son he loves, so does God.
[42:22] And why? As a father, this is the
[42:23] meaning behind the proverb. As a son
[42:25] would punish a father would punish a son
[42:26] to make him better.
[42:28] Amen.
[42:28] To see that he doesn't make mistakes. To
[42:30] see that he goes the right way. THERE'S
[42:32] JUST A SO much behind that thought that
[42:34] he's expressing that a father who loves
[42:36] his son will correct him.
[42:38] That's what the Bible teaches us. If you
[42:39] love him, you'll correct him. I
[42:41] if there's no correction, there's no
[42:43] discipline. If there's no hard
[42:44] decisions, IF THERE'S NO EFFORT TO TRY
[42:46] TO TRAIN THEM UP IN THE WAY THEY GO,
[42:47] THEN YOU don't really love them. Said,
[42:48] "No, I love them." No, you got the wrong
[42:50] kind of love.
[42:51] You don't really love them. You've got a
[42:52] you've got a a false love. You've got a
[42:54] tainted love. You've got a perverted
[42:56] love.
[42:57] Human love could be very protective of a
[42:59] child, but if you ever join it with the
[43:00] word of God, and you yield to the
[43:02] perfect love, it says, "No, this child
[43:04] needs it."
[43:07] So the Lord loveth whom he correctth.
[43:10] Hebrews 12:6, for whom the Lord loveth,
[43:12] he chastineth, and scourgeth every son
[43:14] whom he receiveth. So failure to
[43:17] correct, failure to discipline, we can
[43:18] just do that as a takeaway, is a failure
[43:20] of love. It's a failed love. It's the
[43:22] wrong love.
[43:23] So God so loved the world, that world is
[43:26] judged. And when it's judged, it's
[43:28] restored.
[43:30] When it's judged, it's chasened. It's
[43:32] corrected.
[43:33] And so, Revelations 3:19, and we're
[43:35] making such good time. You all are
[43:36] pulling so hard. I'm just breezing
[43:38] through this. You'll be able to make it
[43:40] to the buffet before the line gets long.
[43:46] In Revelations 3:19
[43:49] says, "As many as I love, I rebuke and
[43:52] chasten. Be zealous, therefore, and
[43:54] repent." Remember how we looked at how
[43:56] the affirmation of love comes before the
[43:59] correction
[44:00] that he affirms his love before he
[44:02] chastens. As many as I love, I rebuke
[44:04] and chasten because there's no
[44:06] condemnation in his love. There's no
[44:08] condemnation. There's no rejection in
[44:09] the s. It's in that moment when the I
[44:11] know I did wrong. I know there's a
[44:13] consequence coming that God wants you to
[44:14] say, "But I love you, so don't worry
[44:16] about it."
[44:18] There's a lesson to be learned here.
[44:19] It's okay. Everything's going to be all
[44:21] right.
[44:23] It only speaks of an opportunity for
[44:24] restoration.
[44:26] He won't leave you as you are. As we
[44:28] read from uh the church age book in
[44:30] church age, to rebuke is to reprove. To
[44:32] reprove is to expose with the view to
[44:34] correction.
[44:35] It's brother Bam drawing from this
[44:36] scripture. Chason does not mean to
[44:38] punish.
[44:40] When the world he loves is chasened,
[44:42] it's for correction. When the world that
[44:44] he does not love is chasened, it's
[44:46] punishment. He says it means to
[44:47] discipline because the subject's
[44:49] amendment is m in mind.
[44:52] Is in mind. So now when you say the
[44:54] subject, the subject of the pun, the
[44:56] discipline, his betterment, his
[44:58] improvement is in mind. But he's ALSO A
[45:01] SUBJECT OF GOD'S LOVE. And that's what
[45:02] gives a basis for the improvement.
[45:05] Because perfect love is going to remove
[45:06] ANY BARRIER BETWEEN THE LOVER AND THE
[45:08] LOVED.
[45:09] It's like, I don't like this
[45:10] disagreement. I don't like this this
[45:12] DIFFERENCE. I DON'T LIKE THESE THINGS
[45:13] THAT ARE IN THE WAY. SO, HE'S GOT TO
[45:15] REMOVE the barriers.
[45:17] With your betterment in mind. That's the
[45:20] purpose of training and correcting,
[45:22] corrective guidance. It's deliberate.
[45:25] It's intentional. As many as I love, I
[45:27] rebuke and chasen.
[45:29] And so, CHASTISEMENT IS NOT
[45:30] CONDEMNATION,
[45:31] RIGHT?
[45:33] But it's correction for your
[45:34] improvement, for your betterment. What
[45:36] is that? A function of the love of God.
[45:38] He's like, I I don't like it that we
[45:40] disagree. I don't like it that things
[45:41] are going this way. I don't I we need to
[45:43] restore this. And so, Brother Brandham
[45:45] in the Smyrnian church a says, and we're
[45:48] bringing back up the quote we've already
[45:49] read maybe a couple times already, but
[45:50] God said that his love was elective
[45:52] love.
[45:54] The proof of his love is election. And
[45:57] notice the phrase he uses that no matter
[45:59] what happened.
[46:02] And he doesn't doesn't go do anything to
[46:04] qualify it to say that no matter what
[46:07] happened prior to 1963.
[46:10] He says that no matter what happened,
[46:12] his love was proven truly by the fact
[46:15] that they were chosen unto salvation.
[46:18] As second Thessalonians put it, that
[46:20] there's those that are going TO PERISH
[46:21] THAT GOD'S going to send a delusion
[46:23] upon. And here's a group of they
[46:24] received not a love of the truth that
[46:26] they can't be saved. They're going to
[46:27] receive a delusion that they're going to
[46:28] be damned. And this is a whole group OF
[46:29] PEOPLE. AND WHAT WE COULD SAY IS, BUT
[46:31] THERE'S ANOTHER group of people that God
[46:32] loves. And so he sends upon them
[46:34] revelation
[46:36] and he manifests his love to him and he
[46:37] quickens them. There's this whole other
[46:39] group of people. He says his love was
[46:41] proven truly by the fact that they were
[46:43] chosen into salvation. RIGHT?
[46:45] THAT NO MATTER WHAT
[46:48] THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED, IN OTHER
[46:51] WORDS, there's nothing TO FEAR IN GOD'S
[46:53] CHOOSING.
[46:55] There's nothing TO FEAR IN GOD'S LOVE.
[46:58] REMEMBER, it's an elected. You're an
[47:00] elected object.
[47:03] I know maybe you don't like to be
[47:04] objectified, but in these terms, maybe
[47:06] it's okay. But you're an elective object
[47:08] with a predestinated objective. Amen.
[47:11] His love love is elective. A and it has
[47:14] a predestinated objective. It's a has an
[47:17] object AND AN OBJECTIVE.
[47:19] THAT'S WHAT GOD HAS FOR YOU. AND
[47:21] NOTHING'S going to determ
[47:24] that. NO, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED, HE
[47:25] CHOSE YOU. NOW, I KNOW THAT THIS this is
[47:30] we we we even those of you who are
[47:32] tremendous Christians and don't make
[47:34] very many mistakes, if any at all, and
[47:36] and and it's and you still realize THAT
[47:38] IT'S VERY HARD TO MAYBE recognize this
[47:42] this impermeable love that it's just
[47:44] it's an absolute
[47:46] because we find that our tastes change,
[47:48] right?
[47:49] There's times when things just aren't
[47:51] the same as they used to be and our
[47:53] likes and dislikes and what we what we
[47:55] desire and we realize, man, things can
[47:56] happen that can change things overnight
[47:58] and this can happen and man this is
[47:59] different and and there's a lot of
[48:00] things that can happen. But brother, no
[48:02] matter what happens
[48:04] and and the fear-mongerers out there and
[48:06] the and manipulators like I wouldn't say
[48:08] it that way, brother Aaron, you could
[48:09] have a mess on your hand like it's not
[48:10] my mess,
[48:13] right?
[48:14] This is what God's wanting to say to
[48:16] you.
[48:16] Amen.
[48:18] that no matter what happened,
[48:21] this is an elective love.
[48:23] As many as I love,
[48:26] as many as I love, stands for the truth
[48:29] that he loves only the many.
[48:32] Amen.
[48:34] Because he says, "As many as I love, I
[48:35] rebuke and chasen. But not all are
[48:38] chasened.
[48:39] Not all are rebuked.
[48:48] Brother Brandham says this when he
[48:50] writes about this verse
[48:52] and remember that when he says as many
[48:54] as I love it it stands for the truth
[48:56] that he loves only the many.
[49:00] That means there's a specific group that
[49:02] this love is to. Says let us examine the
[49:04] first phrase as many as I love. In the
[49:07] Greek the emphasis is upon the personal
[49:09] pronoun I. He does not say as many would
[49:12] feel. He should say as many as love me,
[49:16] right? Because think of all the songs
[49:18] that are being written. I find almost
[49:19] anymore I can almost hardly listen to
[49:21] contemporary Christian music anymore. It
[49:23] almost just turns my stomach because I'm
[49:24] like that is so shallow, right?
[49:27] Uh good thing it has a good baseline to
[49:28] it, right? But there's just things IT'S
[49:30] JUST LIKE AH I DON'T KNOW. I don't know.
[49:32] There's just it it almost turns your
[49:34] stomach because you realize they they're
[49:36] not even using the right language
[49:37] anymore.
[49:39] And so he says as many as love me.
[49:42] That's the way they want it to be. Oh,
[49:44] do you love him? Do you love him? Do you
[49:45] love him? That's not what it says.
[49:46] Belove says we must never try to make
[49:49] Jesus the object of human love in this
[49:52] verse.
[49:53] Really good.
[49:54] So Jesus is not the object.
[49:57] So who is the object? Who's the lover
[50:00] and who's the loved? We must try to
[50:02] NEVER MAKE JESUS THE OBJECT OF HUMAN
[50:03] LOVE IN THIS VERSE. NO, IT IS THE many
[50:06] that are the loved ones of God. Yes,
[50:09] it is his love in question, NOT OURS. HE
[50:12] IS THE LOVER. WE ARE THE LOVE. CAN YOU
[50:14] JUST ACCEPT THAT?
[50:16] HE IS THE LOVER. I AM THE LOVED. SO ONCE
[50:18] AGAIN, WE FIND OURSELVES GLORIFYING IN
[50:21] HIS SALVATION, HIS PURPOSE, AND HIS
[50:24] PLAN. And we are confirmed even more
[50:26] strongly in the truth of THE DOCTRINE OF
[50:28] THE SOVEREIGNTY of God.
[50:30] IT IS THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD'S LOVE THAT
[50:32] HE LOVES ME. I AM THE LOVED. HE
[50:35] [screaming] IS THE LOVER. IT IS NOT THAT
[50:36] I LOVED HIM, BUT IT IS THAT HE IS THE
[50:38] LOVER AND I AM THE LOVE. I AM THE OBJECT
[50:41] OF GOD'S LOVE.
[50:42] AMEN.
[50:43] And being the object of an elective
[50:45] love, that means I am eternal because
[50:46] that love can never perish.
[50:49] I am not the object of HIS WRATH. AND
[50:51] WRATH HAVING an end means THAT I WILL
[50:53] HAVE I CANNOT END BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT
[50:56] HATE ME.
[50:57] AMEN.
[50:58] He's an elective lover
[51:01] of an elective love. Amen. Amen.
[51:03] For an elective objective.
[51:07] It's not indiscriminate. I think it just
[51:09] kind of attacks the heart of the the
[51:12] human tendency to take perfect love and
[51:13] make it something it's not.
[51:16] Because we think, "Oh, well, God's so
[51:18] love. God's so love and just love and
[51:19] just love and just love." And what
[51:21] happens is we could we could deviate
[51:23] from the principle of it's not human
[51:26] love. It's God.
[51:29] It's intentional.
[51:31] It will have an object and an objective.
[51:36] And I there's Brother Brandon brings out
[51:38] a great truth in this.
[51:42] And if if you want to go read it, I'll
[51:43] just I'll just kind of summarize it this
[51:45] way, but it's in this church this part
[51:46] of the church age book.
[51:49] We are the loved ones of God.
[51:52] So he is not the object. It is not those
[51:54] that loved him. So this is the way
[51:57] brother Brand brings this out. And
[51:58] you'll just have to go back and read it.
[51:59] And I like just maybe throwing that out
[52:00] there to you all so you'll be like I got
[52:02] to go find this. Where is this? What's
[52:03] the church age book anyhow? Um he says
[52:07] he says that since we are not it's not
[52:10] our love for him.
[52:12] He makes some statements to to tell us
[52:14] that God is not pining
[52:17] for the love of those that don't love
[52:18] him.
[52:20] Other words not as God just God is not
[52:22] just sitting there going,
[52:24] "Man, I just wish the unbelievers would
[52:26] just love me for real." And he's not
[52:29] just looking at the unbelievers and a
[52:30] man I just wish they WOULD LOVE ME. GOD
[52:32] is not waiting complacently kind of
[52:35] sitting over there and a I'm just
[52:36] waiting for those that don't love me to
[52:38] love me.
[52:40] GOD, THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD IS DOING.
[52:42] SO GOD IS NOT THE OBJECT of love. SO
[52:44] HE'S JUST WAITING to be loved. HE'S JUST
[52:45] WAITING to be loved and waiting to be
[52:47] loved. No, he's a lover.
[52:49] And there's a loved
[52:51] whether they love him or not or whether
[52:53] they know it or not. He's a lover.
[52:55] They're the love. THEY'RE HIS OBJECTIVE.
[52:58] THEY'RE ON HIS RADAR,
[53:00] RIGHT? He He's the ONE THAT'S BEEN
[53:02] STALKING YOU,
[53:03] RIGHT? HE'S THE ONE THAT'S BEEN
[53:04] FOLLOWING YOU. HE'S THE ONE THAT'S BEEN
[53:06] YEAH, I KNOW EXACTLY WHO THEY ARE. HE
[53:08] HE'S FOLLOWING YOU, RIGHT? He's paying
[53:11] attention to you.
[53:13] AND HERE HE IS WITH AN ELECTIVE LOVE FOR
[53:15] YOU. IT'S NOT YOUR LOVE FOR HIM. SO, IT
[53:18] TELLS US THAT GOD IS NOT SITTING BACK
[53:20] WAITING TO BE LOVED.
[53:22] HE'S NOT WAITING FOR THOSE WHO DON'T
[53:24] BELIEVE HIM TO BELIEVE IN HIM. HE'S A
[53:26] LOVER WITH A LOVE THAT HAS AN OBJECTIVE.
[53:28] AMEN.
[53:29] And he says in Ephesians 1:es 4-6,
[53:31] according to as he hath chosen us in him
[53:35] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, THAT
[53:36] WE SHOULD BE holy and without blame
[53:38] before him. In love,
[53:41] WHAT DOES ISAIAH SAY? IN LOVE FOR MY
[53:43] SOUL, HE CAST ALL THY SINS BEHIND MY
[53:45] BACK. IN LOVE, HAVING PREDESTINED us
[53:48] under the adoption of children by Jesus
[53:49] Christ himself, according to the good
[53:52] pleasure of his will. Yes.
[53:54] Amen.
[53:56] To the praise of the glory of his grace
[53:57] wherein he hath made us accepted in
[54:00] there it is again the beloved.
[54:03] We are chosen in the beloved one.
[54:06] Beloved means worthy of love, highly
[54:08] favored.
[54:10] But he says that has made us accepted
[54:13] which means to be pursued.
[54:17] I know I know when you read it it kind
[54:18] of it makes it seem that
[54:21] that we're accepted, right? Right? So,
[54:24] we kind of present ourselves and we're
[54:25] we're sliding into his DMs and saying,
[54:27] "Hey, I I I have you noticed me,
[54:31] but that's not that's not how it works,
[54:33] right? The the the what's happening is
[54:37] that we are the pursued."
[54:39] Was it Brother said you never sought
[54:41] God,
[54:42] right? He pursued us. It's not it's his
[54:45] love for us. It's his passion for us.
[54:47] And so, IT SAYS WE'VE BEEN CHOSEN. It
[54:50] means we've been pursued with grace. He
[54:52] has made US ACCEPTED. IN OTHER WORDS,
[54:55] HE'S MADE US WORTHY.
[54:57] LISTEN, his love for us has MADE US AN
[55:00] OBJECT OF HIS PURSUIT.
[55:03] [applause]
[55:04] I MAYBE I'M JUST BORROWING A LOT OF
[55:05] PHRASES SO THE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GET IT,
[55:07] BUT HE'S INFATUATED WITH YOU.
[55:10] That this IS AN THIS IS SOMETHING I MUST
[55:12] HAVE. THIS IS SOMETHING I KNOW I WANT.
[55:15] THIS IS A PERFECT LOVE. AND I'M NOT JUST
[55:16] GOING TO FORCE HIM TO LOVE ME. I'M NOT
[55:18] JUST GOING TO MANIPULATE IT. BUT HE HAS
[55:20] AN UNRELENTING STUBBORN GRACE AND A LOVE
[55:23] FOR YOU. AND YOU SAY, "WELL, EXPLAIN IT,
[55:25] GOD. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I LOVE HIM."
[55:27] AMEN.
[55:28] AND HE'S MADE US ACCEPTED. HE'S PURSUED
[55:30] US WITH GRACE. HIS LOVE. HE IS A LOVER
[55:33] OF A LOVED AND HE'S PURSUED US WITH THAT
[55:36] LOVE.
[55:36] AMEN.
[55:37] And that's who he pursues.
[55:39] He's not out knocking on the doors of
[55:40] all those that don't love him.
[55:42] He's not out there knocking on the doors
[55:44] of the unbelievers, but there's an
[55:45] elected out there that he's pursuing.
[55:47] Amen.
[55:48] This is what brother Bradam uses to to
[55:50] support that principle that God's not
[55:51] just sitting back waiting for those who
[55:53] don't love him.
[55:54] Amen.
[55:55] But he says in Romans 9, he quotes from
[55:57] this Romans chapter 9 11-13 and speaking
[56:00] of the seed of Abraham in God's
[56:02] sovereign election. So this is the
[56:04] sovereignty of God. We're confirmed even
[56:06] more strong in the truth of the doctrine
[56:07] of the sovereignty of God's love. I
[56:10] added there the sovereignty of God's
[56:12] love part says for the children being
[56:14] not yet born
[56:16] neither having done any good or evil
[56:19] that the purpose of God according to
[56:21] election might stand not of works but of
[56:23] him that calleth
[56:27] and he he he says this before he
[56:29] mentions it was said unto her the elder
[56:32] shall serve the younger as it is written
[56:36] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[56:42] This is this is God's words.
[56:45] It said in Malachi,
[56:47] Paul brings it forward here that Jacob I
[56:50] love. I love Jacob. I hate Esau.
[56:54] Brother Baron says this is elective
[56:57] love. The church book this is elective
[57:00] love. It is his love for his elect. So
[57:04] Jacob was chosen.
[57:05] Esau wasn't. Right?
[57:07] Jacob was accepted. Esau wasn't.
[57:10] Jacob was pursued. Esau wasn't.
[57:14] Jacob was chosen for a calling. Esau
[57:16] wasn't.
[57:18] And even if you look at the story,
[57:20] there's one. You'd think, well, we know
[57:21] who Isaac loves, and we know he's the
[57:24] this is his the one he loves, and the
[57:26] mother loves the other one. It's like,
[57:27] well, you got mama's boy, you got
[57:28] daddy's boy. I mean, let's just look at
[57:29] the the way that this should work out.
[57:31] But yet, it was God's choosing.
[57:34] He says, "This is elective love. It is
[57:36] love for his elect and his love for them
[57:38] is apart from human merit.
[57:43] It's apart from human merit. Doesn't say
[57:44] anything about divine merit but apart
[57:45] from human merit. For it says that the
[57:48] purpose of God stands in election WHICH
[57:50] IS EXACTLY OPPOSITE to works or anything
[57:52] man has in himself.
[57:55] This is elective love apart from human
[57:57] merit.
[57:59] That God says I love Jacob. I hate Esau.
[58:03] Jacob was a deceiver.
[58:05] the hill grabber before he was a prince.
[58:09] He was a mama's boy. Got the birthright
[58:12] through deception because he knew how to
[58:13] cook.
[58:15] Right? Obviously, Esau didn't love food
[58:17] in the way that some of us love food,
[58:19] but loved it in ways that others do.
[58:22] He was a shyer.
[58:24] So, if you look at the if you look at
[58:26] the kind of the pedigree,
[58:30] firstborn, man's man, right? daddy's
[58:34] boy. And you start looking at all the
[58:36] laws of the first board. You start
[58:37] looking at everything. It says, "Esau,
[58:40] it's got to be Esau."
[58:43] Yet, God loved Jacob,
[58:45] the mama's boy, the shyer, the
[58:47] scaredy-cat. You name it over and over
[58:50] and over again. And if you had time to
[58:53] look at Esau's life from a natural
[58:55] perspective, he was more blessed than
[58:56] Jacob.
[58:59] you just look at look at from a natural
[59:01] perspective say that despite the wording
[59:03] of the scripture but as as we looked at
[59:05] it from A HUMAN PERSPECTIVE SAY WELL IT
[59:07] SURE LOOKS LIKE Esau's the one that's
[59:08] been firmly planted he's the one that's
[59:10] got wealth and resources he's the one
[59:12] that's got strength even to the point
[59:14] where Jacob is afraid of him and and
[59:16] here's Esau living his best life and
[59:18] Jacob's hated now come on you start to
[59:21] really think about this well well Jacob
[59:23] I've loved and Esau I've hated him like
[59:24] yeah I bet Esau really got it didn't he
[59:26] RIGHT BUT LOOK AT JACOB AND HIS LIFE. HE
[59:28] HAD MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS.
[59:30] He battled MORE WITH FEAR. HE DEALT MORE
[59:33] WITH GRIEF AND LOSS AND CALAMITIES AND
[59:35] DECEPTION. JACOB HAD A MUCH MORE
[59:37] DIFFICULT TIME AS WE READ IT IN THE
[59:38] SCRIPTURE.
[59:40] SO WHEN WE READ THAT JACOB I'VE LOVED
[59:42] AND ESAU I'VE HATED, GOD'S LOVE FOR
[59:44] JACOB IS MANIFESTED IN ACCEPTING JACOB
[59:46] FOR A HIGHER CALLING.
[59:48] IT IT'S MANIFESTED IN CHOOSING JACOB for
[59:51] a greater position.
[59:52] And and it DIDN'T ALL HAVE TO MATCH UP
[59:54] NATURALLY. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO ALL LINE UP
[59:56] WITH CERTAIN UH MILESTONES AND WEALTH
[59:58] AND RICHES AND AND AND BEING ABLE TO GET
[1:00:00] THE GIRL YOU LOVE WHEN YOU FIRST MEET
[1:00:01] HER. IT WASN'T ALWAYS WORKING OUT THE
[1:00:03] WAY THAT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD. AND SO
[1:00:05] GOD'S LOVE FOR JACOB WAS MANIFESTED IN
[1:00:07] THAT HE CHOSE HIM TO BE THE PATRIARCH.
[1:00:10] IT'S MANIFESTED FOR JACOB THAT HE CHOSE
[1:00:12] TO REVEAL HIMSELF TO him
[1:00:15] so that he could say, "Jacob, I know
[1:00:17] your tribulation. I know your poverty. I
[1:00:19] know your difficulties, but you are
[1:00:22] rich.
[1:00:23] Amen.
[1:00:25] And how is God's hatred expressed to
[1:00:28] Esau?
[1:00:29] Not in depriving him of all the wealth
[1:00:31] and comforts that life could afford, but
[1:00:33] by rejecting him.
[1:00:35] That's how hatred was manifested. We
[1:00:37] think for sure that hatred means, "Yep,
[1:00:39] it's going to blow up. Yep, going to be
[1:00:40] scandal. It's going to end in ruin. Yep,
[1:00:42] it's going to come to find out Esau is
[1:00:44] this." And no, he can continue on and be
[1:00:46] blessed.
[1:00:49] But the hatred is manifest in rejecting,
[1:00:51] finding him unfit for God's purpose
[1:00:54] to have a patriarch.
[1:00:56] And that's why brother Brandham says,
[1:00:58] "The cloudy skies and storms of life are
[1:01:00] no signs of God's disapproval."
[1:01:05] Because Jacob is over there
[1:01:08] fighting in the storms of life. And he
[1:01:10] says, "Neither are the bright skies and
[1:01:11] still waters the signs of his love and
[1:01:13] approval." Because there's Esau and
[1:01:15] joining the bright skies and the still
[1:01:16] waters. He says his approval of any of
[1:01:18] us is only in the beloved.
[1:01:22] His love is elective which he had for us
[1:01:26] before the foundation of the world.
[1:01:31] For before he even formed the world, he
[1:01:33] loved the world.
[1:01:35] And you're part of that mystery.
[1:01:38] For God so loved.
[1:01:39] Please stand with me today. Thank you
[1:01:41] for your attention.
[1:01:46] musicians you come please.
[1:01:55] My prayer is that you understand better
[1:02:00] to know and trust the love that God has
[1:02:04] for us. It says, "For God so loved the
[1:02:07] world, the world that he loved is a
[1:02:08] special world.
[1:02:10] It's a world that he never stops loving.
[1:02:12] It's a world that he does not condemn,
[1:02:15] but it's a world that his elective love
[1:02:18] restores.
[1:02:20] You're a part of that world.
[1:02:23] We have known and believed. So, let's
[1:02:25] just trust. So, we bow [music] our heads
[1:02:27] today, grateful for the visitors that we
[1:02:30] have amongst us.
[1:02:34] So thankful that we could be together
[1:02:35] today. [music] If you have a need, just
[1:02:37] lift it up before him.
[1:02:41] Say, "Lord, here's my need.
[1:02:44] Here's my prayer."
[1:02:47] Let's bow [music] our heads together.
[1:02:56] Gracious heavenly father,
[1:03:00] I think each one of us could say that we
[1:03:02] never tire
[1:03:04] of talking about your love. [music]
[1:03:08] There's aspects, Lord, I think that are
[1:03:10] challenging.
[1:03:13] There's pictures that sometimes we
[1:03:15] [music] can't always fully understand.
[1:03:19] There's paths we've taken in life and
[1:03:21] hurts and rejections that we've suffered
[1:03:23] and heartaches,
[1:03:27] disappointments.
[1:03:29] Lord, we're even right now facing things
[1:03:31] that defy
[1:03:32] explanation.
[1:03:36] We as even the prophet alluded to say
[1:03:38] how can I be a subject of God's love and
[1:03:42] go through this
[1:03:45] and Lord maybe there is [music]
[1:03:48] no explanation that we could come up
[1:03:50] with that would satisfy it
[1:03:54] but just as brother Brandham was able to
[1:03:56] one day [music] say I know now I didn't
[1:03:58] know then but I know now
[1:04:01] perhaps Lord one day we'll understand it
[1:04:03] better by and Right.
[1:04:05] But in the meantime,
[1:04:07] I've seen enough to know that I can
[1:04:09] trust you.
[1:04:12] I've experienced enough to know that I
[1:04:14] can trust you.
[1:04:16] And Lord, I recognize that many of the
[1:04:18] hurts and rejections and [music] the
[1:04:19] separations and estrangements and the
[1:04:21] loss that I've suffered in this life, it
[1:04:23] has been because of the Jacob in me.
[1:04:28] It's been by my own hands, by my own
[1:04:30] works.
[1:04:33] by my own rebellion and stubbornness.
[1:04:36] In that way, Lord, it's been my own
[1:04:38] perverted love that's brought me pain.
[1:04:41] Lord, I realize there's times in my life
[1:04:43] where perhaps I'm not the main actor
[1:04:46] and I'm not the one who's to a greater
[1:04:49] proportion responsible, but I have been
[1:04:51] hurt. I have been offended. I have been
[1:04:52] rejected. I have experienced loss,
[1:04:54] severe pain, and tribulation
[1:04:58] at the hands of those who loved
[1:05:01] imperfectly.
[1:05:03] And perhaps we could say, "It's been a
[1:05:05] perverted love.
[1:05:07] But through it all, your perfect love
[1:05:09] has walked out over me."
[1:05:12] And said, "I know you, Aaron, and I'll
[1:05:15] never let you be ruined.
[1:05:18] Never let you be destroyed.
[1:05:22] Though you may bow at times under the
[1:05:24] weight of scars and complexes, and
[1:05:26] though you may hurt at times with the
[1:05:29] pain that is overwhelming,
[1:05:31] my love knows when to say enough is
[1:05:33] enough.
[1:05:36] And I'll use every tear. I'll use every
[1:05:38] knot. [music] I'll use every shadow. And
[1:05:40] I'll use every scar for my glory.
[1:05:44] And you will come to know my love in a
[1:05:46] perfect way. and you'll come to trust me
[1:05:50] and know that I am not abusive and
[1:05:52] manipulative
[1:05:55] and know that all along I even believed
[1:05:57] in you. So I would let you wonder. I'd
[1:06:00] let you stray [music]
[1:06:03] knowing that in the end love would win.
[1:06:08] And Lord, when I see how much you love
[1:06:10] me,
[1:06:13] [music]
[1:06:14] I realize that the most significant
[1:06:17] thing in my life is to be an object of
[1:06:20] your love.
[1:06:24] You are the lover and I'm the loved and
[1:06:25] I accept it.
[1:06:28] And I know it seems so insufficient to
[1:06:31] say, "I love you back." But Jesus, I
[1:06:34] love you. I love you.
[1:06:36] I love you, Lord. I do.
[1:06:41] And Lord, I sense that that pleases you.
[1:06:46] And it's [music] what you want to hear.
[1:06:50] Father, may the heavens rejoice today as
[1:06:54] your lost ones come home.
[1:06:57] May your heart rejoice today when the
[1:06:59] objects of your love turn their face
[1:07:01] [music] towards you. LORD, YOU'RE NOT
[1:07:03] PINING for the attention from a world.
[1:07:06] You're not longing for the affection of
[1:07:08] a world, but you ARE LOOKING TO US, THE
[1:07:11] WORLD THAT YOU love
[1:07:14] to turn our hearts to you.
[1:07:17] And in their two omnipotent meet,
[1:07:22] bless us today. I believe you're healing
[1:07:24] hearts right now.
[1:07:26] I believe you're giving hope for
[1:07:28] restoration,
[1:07:32] Lord. And I believe that there'll even
[1:07:34] be those who might after the fact listen
[1:07:37] to a prayer that was prayed
[1:07:40] in the past
[1:07:42] and it'll speak to their heart that God
[1:07:45] is restoring
[1:07:48] because that's what [music] perfect love
[1:07:50] does.
[1:07:52] That no matter what's happened, decades,
[1:07:54] years, [music]
[1:07:55] comingings and goings,
[1:07:58] say, "Here I am, Lord.
[1:08:01] I'm I'm here
[1:08:04] not not for you to receive me, but you
[1:08:08] already made me worthy of pursuit
[1:08:11] and I'm done running from you, [music]
[1:08:13] Lord.
[1:08:14] You chased me down with the jealous love
[1:08:18] and I'm done running.
[1:08:21] Lord, I'm thinking about Jacob.
[1:08:25] Whole time he was wrestling with you,
[1:08:28] your heart was beating. Don't let me go.
[1:08:32] Don't let me go,
[1:08:34] FATHER. I GRAB BACK AND I HOLD ON to you
[1:08:36] with all that is in me. And I say,
[1:08:38] Jesus, I love you.
[1:08:40] AND I WANT TO STAY FAITHFUL to you,
[1:08:42] Lord. I WANT TO SERVE YOU WITH ALL THAT
[1:08:44] IS IN ME. No matter what comes and what
[1:08:47] goes, no matter what tomorrow holds,
[1:08:49] Lord, I I want to I want all I want all
[1:08:53] my heart to love you. Not just a part of
[1:08:56] it is enough. I want all my heart to
[1:08:57] love you. And Lord, in turn, I want this
[1:09:00] for my children. I want it for my
[1:09:02] beautiful wife. I want it for [music]
[1:09:03] the brothers and sisters of this church.
[1:09:05] I want it for my neighbor. I want to be
[1:09:07] so secure in your love that I don't love
[1:09:09] with the perverted love anymore.
[1:09:11] Amen.
[1:09:12] Help us, Father. I pray I commit the
[1:09:14] people to you.
[1:09:18] In the name of Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:09:19] pray.
[1:09:21] Amen.
[1:09:23] Amen. Such a sweet [music] presence
[1:09:25] amongst us.
