[0:00] My title today is defamation of
[0:03] character. I know many of you know that
[0:05] my day job is as a lawyer. I'm not uh
[0:08] meaning to preach on defamation of
[0:10] character, but using kind of that phrase
[0:12] a little bit, defamation of character,
[0:14] the deforming of one's character. And I
[0:17] want to come back to this reading here
[0:19] in just a little bit. But to kind of tie
[0:22] in Wednesday night's service when we
[0:23] were speaking on uh praying on ignorance
[0:26] in 2 Corinthians chapter 2 11 Paul in
[0:30] speaking about having forgiveness and
[0:32] forgiving one another and showing and
[0:36] showing forgiveness in our hearts. He's
[0:39] saying that we ought to forgive because
[0:40] if we hold unforgiveness in our hearts
[0:42] that's something that the devil will
[0:44] take advantage of. And so he says, "Lest
[0:46] Satan should get an advantage of us for
[0:49] we are not ignorant of his devices." You
[0:51] can take that to mean that Paul is
[0:53] saying we know this and because we know
[0:55] this, Satan can't capitalize on it. And
[0:58] Satan, as I put on this slide, he prays
[1:01] on ignorance. And he takes things that
[1:04] we don't know or that we don't fully
[1:06] understand and he tries to twist them
[1:08] and distort them so that we can be taken
[1:11] advantage of. And Satan not only prays
[1:14] on ignorance, but there's one thing I've
[1:16] noticed, especially as of late, that he
[1:18] will actually call your faith ignorance.
[1:20] That when we believe in God and we
[1:22] believe things on the basis of faith,
[1:24] he'll say, "Well, he will belittle that
[1:26] and say, "Oh, well, what about this and
[1:28] what about that?" And he tries to make
[1:29] people feel ignorant or stupid. That
[1:31] might seem to be a harsh word, but
[1:33] that's the way that he'll try to make
[1:34] people feel for believing something.
[1:37] He'll try to make you feel foolish. And
[1:38] so, Satan prays on ignorance. If you
[1:42] don't know something, Satan will try to
[1:44] take advantage of that. That's what Paul
[1:45] is saying here, that we're not ignorant
[1:47] of his devices. In other words, since we
[1:49] know, we can't, we won't let Satan take
[1:52] advantage of us. And we mentioned
[1:55] Wednesday night that we're wanting to
[1:56] address these weaknesses or
[1:58] vulnerabilities that the world, the
[2:00] flesh, and the devil will capitalize on
[2:03] to try to weaken our faith or hinder
[2:05] faith from taking hold. You take certain
[2:08] things that we are not doing or certain
[2:10] things that we do not have and he'll
[2:11] he'll capitalize on that to either take
[2:14] uh weaken your faith so that you don't
[2:16] believe or it keeps faith from taking
[2:18] hold. So he prevents faith. Wednesday
[2:21] night we're talking about the necessity
[2:22] of prayer and how it's necessary to have
[2:26] uh prayer or in order to have a
[2:27] Christian life and maintain a Christian
[2:29] life, you should be a prayer, one that
[2:32] goes before the Lord and prays. We see
[2:34] it exemplified in Christ. And it's
[2:36] taught in the Bible that we ought to
[2:38] pray. Took the opposite of prayer is
[2:41] ignoring. And so if you pray, uh, you
[2:45] pray to God. If you don't pray, you're
[2:46] ignoring God. And so the opposite would
[2:49] be ignorance. And ignoring God by not
[2:50] praying makes us vulnerable to doubt. It
[2:53] makes us vulnerable to temptation. And
[2:55] it's what causes weakness. So today on
[2:58] the subject of defformation of
[3:01] character, I want to use uh how I want
[3:04] to use that phrase uh in speaking on the
[3:06] subject how that reading our Bibles, our
[3:08] spiritual growth depends on scripture.
[3:12] And so we must pray and read our Bibles.
[3:14] Brother Brandon was asked how to be
[3:16] spiritual and how to maintain a
[3:17] Christian life. There was two things he
[3:18] said we ought to do. Pray and read our
[3:21] Bible. I know there's probably a lot of
[3:23] other things that we thought would be
[3:24] good is maybe go to a hospital and
[3:26] challenge everybody who believes to come
[3:28] out of their beds, but that's not how he
[3:30] said we could be more spiritual. He
[3:32] said, "Pray and read your Bible." And
[3:35] so, I believe that growth, spiritual
[3:37] growth depends on scripture. We must
[3:39] pray and read our Bibles if we're going
[3:41] to grow properly. So, the subject today
[3:44] is on reading the Bible, reading
[3:45] scripture. And so, we'll use scripture
[3:47] to support that. If that seems to be a
[3:49] little bit circular, I could understand
[3:51] the argument if one would make that. But
[3:52] in 2 Timothy chapter 3 verses 15, 16 and
[3:57] 17, Paul writing to Timothy says, "And
[3:59] that from a child thou hast known the
[4:01] holy scriptures, which are able to make
[4:04] thee wise unto salvation through faith
[4:06] which is in Christ Jesus." All scriptur
[4:10] is given by inspiration of God and is
[4:13] profitable, beneficial. It adds, it it
[4:16] it provides, it's profitable for
[4:17] doctrine, for reprove, for correction,
[4:21] for instruction and righteousness, that
[4:23] the man of God may be perfect, threw
[4:26] furnished unto all good works. Now, pay
[4:30] careful attention to these qualities of
[4:32] the scripture, the holy scriptures. That
[4:34] would have been their parchments, their
[4:36] books, their scrolls. And the Bible is
[4:39] saying as Paul is saying the holy
[4:40] scriptures give wisdom which leads to
[4:42] faith in Jesus Christ. And not just a
[4:45] faith but a perfecting faith says it's
[4:48] profitable for teaching for testing for
[4:50] correcting and training in God's perfect
[4:53] will. As it says reproof and correction
[4:55] instruction and doctrine all those
[4:57] things speak of God's uh perfect will in
[5:02] righteousness.
[5:04] If this this is the one thing I want you
[5:06] to catch from the scripture today is
[5:08] this is the perfecting nature of God's
[5:10] word that it doesn't just inform us. We
[5:13] don't just read it and we know what it
[5:14] was like in this century. We know what
[5:16] it was like before Christ. But it's the
[5:18] perfecting nature of scriptures. There's
[5:20] transforming power to change a person's
[5:23] character in the Bible. I hope you
[5:26] believe that. I hope our children can
[5:28] understand that. that even though it may
[5:30] just be this I Indian paper and and ink
[5:33] on these pages and all these different
[5:35] translations there might be and
[5:37] different ways and type sets it could be
[5:39] put in. God has blessed and anointed
[5:42] this scripture to be able to change a
[5:45] person's character.
[5:47] Says that the man of God may be perfect.
[5:50] That's a the perfecting nature of this
[5:52] scripture truly furnished means to
[5:54] complete to finish to furnish perfectly.
[5:57] So, it's not just the the the finishing,
[6:00] but the furnishing.
[6:02] You know that when uh and you may have
[6:04] experienced this, and when a house is
[6:06] ready to move into, you rent a house or
[6:07] buy a house and it's ready, it's made
[6:09] ready to move in and you go, "Ah, we we
[6:11] bought it. It's ours, but it's empty."
[6:13] Then you furnish that. You build a
[6:15] house, it's all ready to move in, but
[6:17] then it needs to be furnished. That
[6:18] means it fills it up. It puts the
[6:20] certain amenities in it. So, it's to
[6:22] furnish, to equip perfectly.
[6:25] So the Bible has the power to build the
[6:28] stature of a perfect man or the stature
[6:30] of perfection. The scriptures have this
[6:32] perfecting quality, has a perfecting
[6:34] power. That's in the Bibles that you
[6:37] have. And I know that we're partial to
[6:39] the King James version, but not all
[6:42] languages have a King James version and
[6:44] not all translations are the same in
[6:46] different languages. And I don't think
[6:49] that we need to get on uh some of the
[6:51] political platforms that we can have
[6:53] sometimes where we we're all about the
[6:55] King James version Bible and that's the
[6:57] only way to be saved. We believe that
[6:59] God is in the word. And if somebody's
[7:02] reading NIV,
[7:05] God can still speak to them.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; God can still use that though it's been
[7:09] translated and printed and maybe
[7:10] sometimes things have been changed. It's
[7:12] God's way of using things that are
[7:15] imperfect
[7:16] &gt;&gt; to express perfection.
[7:20] Now, so with that in mind, and that's
[7:22] kind of my you kind of understand what
[7:23] my thesis is, the Bible has power to
[7:25] change. In Genesis chapter 30, we read
[7:28] about how that Jacob begins to bargain
[7:30] with Laban and he's he comes amongst
[7:32] them and first he gets cheated out of
[7:34] the first wife and so he marries two
[7:36] wives. He begins to have children and
[7:38] Laban realizes he's just supremely
[7:40] blessed with Jacob's presence. And so
[7:43] Jacob says, "I want to go back to my
[7:45] country. I want to have my own family. I
[7:46] want to have my own goods." So he they
[7:47] strike this bargain where Jacob is going
[7:50] to be able to keep all the cattle that
[7:52] have spots or stripes or specks that
[7:54] aren't um uh that are not just whole one
[7:59] color. And so as soon as Laban finds out
[8:02] that's what Jacob wants and that's all
[8:04] he wants, he removes all the spotted and
[8:06] speckled and ringstroke cattle from his
[8:08] herds and says, "Okay, Jacob, good luck
[8:10] getting anything when your time is
[8:12] done." So in verse 37, and I know this
[8:15] fits with this idea of Jacob being a
[8:18] deceiver, but notice Laban deceived him
[8:20] first. He was treacherous and dishonest
[8:22] first. Jacob took him rods of green
[8:25] popppler and of the hazel and chestnut
[8:28] tree. So these rods come from trees and
[8:31] it's going to describe what he does. So
[8:33] these rods are branches or trees or
[8:35] parts of trees. He takes these trees
[8:37] with their bark and he peels back the
[8:39] bark to expose this white pulp
[8:42] underneath. Says, "And he peeled white
[8:44] strakes in them and made the white
[8:46] appear which was in the rods. And he set
[8:48] the rods, these are branches, the parts
[8:51] of these trees. He set the rods which he
[8:53] had peeled before the flocks in the
[8:55] gutters in the watering troughs. when
[8:58] the flocks came to drink that they
[9:00] should conceive when they came to drink
[9:03] and the flocks conceived before the rods
[9:05] and brought forth cattle ring stra
[9:07] speckled and spotted.
[9:09] Now, this may seem to be odd, but we're
[9:13] just looking at what happens here. And
[9:16] the cause and effect might be difficult
[9:17] to understand that how could drinking in
[9:20] front of these things actually transform
[9:24] uh uh dictate what is conceived and then
[9:26] ultimately produced. But if we look at
[9:28] it this way, I want to use this as a
[9:31] type of the scripture with the power to
[9:33] influence and produce permanent change
[9:38] that as they came and they they they
[9:41] drank before this that it dictated the
[9:44] conception in what was brought forth.
[9:47] These rods are placed in a particular
[9:49] way in a particular setting and through
[9:51] the drinking and the conceiving it
[9:53] produced cattle that were ring straight
[9:54] speckled and spotted. In Psalms 23:4, it
[9:58] says, "Yay, though I walk through the
[9:59] valley of the shadow of death, I will
[10:01] fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy
[10:04] rod and thy staff, they comfort me."
[10:08] What was uh the rod and thy staff, he
[10:10] says, "Thou art with me." It's that law
[10:12] of God. The law was the present word. Uh
[10:16] the psalmist went to the Bible, the
[10:18] scriptures that they had and the law of
[10:20] God and what Moses had written and
[10:22] that's how God was present with them.
[10:25] And the rod and staff were used as a
[10:28] shepherd for means of protection but
[10:30] also for correction and guidance. A rod
[10:34] that we when you read here it says then
[10:35] the rods of green popppler and hazel and
[10:38] chestnut tree. It's a different word but
[10:39] it speaks of the same thing. A staff was
[10:41] a branch. It was a stick. It was a part
[10:43] of those trees. And so rod and staff
[10:46] were are are were used for correction,
[10:48] for guidance, and for and even for the
[10:52] the direction of the sheep
[10:56] just like the scriptures are
[10:59] in Romans chapter 15:es 1 to7. Today I'm
[11:02] going to do the same as I did on
[11:04] Wednesday night where we take a little
[11:05] bit of um of the uh the scripture that
[11:09] we're focusing on and we're expanding it
[11:11] so you can see it within the context. It
[11:13] was remarkable just to see from a little
[11:16] bit higher view where where prayer fit
[11:18] in with these very substantial and
[11:21] weighty subjects. And here we'll see the
[11:23] same with the scripture. We then that
[11:25] are strong ought to bear the infirmities
[11:27] of the weak and not to please ourselves.
[11:29] Let every one of us please his neighbor
[11:31] for his good to edification. For even
[11:33] Christ pleased not himself. But as it is
[11:36] written, the reproaches of them that
[11:37] reproach thee fell on me. For whatsoever
[11:40] things were written before time were
[11:42] written for our learning. Paul is using
[11:44] this to substantiate what he's saying is
[11:46] about we that are strong should bear the
[11:48] infirmities of the weak and let us
[11:50] please our neighbor for his good not
[11:51] just for ourselves. Don't be selfish
[11:54] because Christ did the same. And then he
[11:56] says as it is written and he quotes this
[11:59] scripture about the Messiah. And then he
[12:01] uses this to enforce and to back up his
[12:04] teaching. For what sort of things were
[12:05] written before time were written for our
[12:08] learning?
[12:10] Their books, their parchments, their
[12:12] scrolls. The law was written so that
[12:14] they would learn that we through
[12:16] patience and comfort of the scriptures
[12:18] might have hope.
[12:21] Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[12:23] What is it? It's the word of God. It's
[12:25] even the scrolls, the parchments, the
[12:27] books, the scriptures that we through
[12:28] the patience and comfort of the
[12:30] scriptures might have hope. So when the
[12:33] psalmist said, "Thy rod comforts me,"
[12:35] it's the scriptures that bring comfort.
[12:38] Now the God of patience and consolation
[12:40] grant you to be like-minded one toward
[12:41] another according to Christ Jesus, that
[12:44] you may be with one mind and one mouth,
[12:46] one mind and one mouth glorify God, even
[12:50] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[12:52] Wherefore receive you one another as
[12:54] Christ also receive us to the glory of
[12:56] God.
[12:58] Now, bringing it back to the story of
[13:00] Jacob, I just wanted to I kind of took
[13:02] things from out of order as I originally
[13:03] had it last week and just rearranged it
[13:05] this way because I'm wanting to use this
[13:08] type and it might seem to be uh
[13:10] difficult at first that the rods that
[13:13] Jacob placed before the cattle, we can
[13:15] use this as a type of the word of God
[13:18] that it placed before us has the power
[13:21] to transform or to cause us to conceive
[13:25] and bring forth
[13:27] And though there was deceit in Jacob's
[13:30] actions, and he did this as a means of
[13:33] getting from Laban uh what he had asked
[13:35] for, we know it was in response to
[13:37] Laban's own treachery, and that this
[13:39] sorely displeased God. But it also
[13:42] reflects God's word and God's inspired
[13:45] word and the power of it. Genesis 31:es
[13:49] 9-13, we'll see that God actually
[13:52] blesses this.
[13:54] When Jacob is uh uh God is telling Jacob
[13:58] to return and Jacob calls for Rachel and
[14:01] Leah, he's say telling to them, "God
[14:03] have taken away the cattle of your
[14:04] father and given them to me." Who did
[14:07] it? He says, "God did it. And it came to
[14:09] pass at the time that the cattle
[14:11] conceived that I lifted up mine eyes and
[14:13] saw in a dream, and behold, the rams
[14:15] which leaped upon the cattle were ring
[14:17] straight, speckled, and gristled. And
[14:19] the angel of God spake unto me in a
[14:21] dream, saying, Jacob. And I said, Here
[14:23] am I. And he said, Lift up now thine
[14:25] eyes, and see all the rams which leap
[14:27] upon the cattle, are ring straight,
[14:29] speckled, and gristled, for I have seen
[14:31] all that Laban doeth unto thee.
[14:35] I hope you can just begin to use your
[14:36] own mindset to think, okay, this is how
[14:40] God works. We mentioned this Wednesday
[14:41] night that if if I'm going on a trip and
[14:44] I say, "Pray for me that God would God
[14:46] will be with me on my trip." You say,
[14:48] "Well, why do we need to pray? Can't God
[14:49] just be with brother Aaron when he's on
[14:51] a trip and I don't have anything?" Well,
[14:53] I like said, "I don't have anything
[14:54] planned, but I I am going to be
[14:55] preaching in Mexico next weekend. So,
[14:57] pray for me." You say, "Well, if you're
[14:58] going to preach, shouldn't God be with
[15:00] you? Should you be praying for you? Why
[15:01] do we need to pray for you?" Well, this
[15:03] is how God ask us to work, pray for one
[15:05] another. And so when Laban does this uh
[15:09] to Jacob, we can say, "Why didn't God
[15:11] just stop Laban?
[15:13] Why did God let Laban do this?" Well,
[15:16] God allows Laban to do it. Say, "Well,
[15:18] then why doesn't God just supernaturally
[15:20] allow the cattle that Laban has left
[15:22] that are not spotted, restrained, or
[15:25] speckled? Why doesn't he just allow them
[15:27] to produce spotted, restrained, and
[15:29] speckled um cattle?" That's not how it
[15:32] worked. He had Jacob do something. And
[15:35] it's according to this dream, I believe
[15:37] that he's telling him that this cattle
[15:38] that come, they're going to be ringing
[15:40] straight, speckled, and gristled because
[15:42] I've seen what Laban does. I am the God
[15:45] of Bethl, where thou anointest the
[15:47] pillar, and where thou vowest a vow to
[15:48] me. Now arise and get thee out from this
[15:50] land and return in the land of thy
[15:51] kindred. So he sees that God through
[15:53] some means had inspired Jacob to do
[15:56] this. And he uses this image if it not
[16:00] the the the effect, the cause and effect
[16:04] of taking these trees and these rods and
[16:06] placing him there to bring forth this
[16:08] cattle that would bless Jacob.
[16:11] And just as this might seem to be just
[16:17] uh remnants of a tree,
[16:21] manipulated and processed
[16:24] in place before one that's drinking,
[16:27] cause them to conceive a particular type
[16:29] of cattle and bring it forth. Isn't that
[16:31] what our Bibles are?
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Made from pulp.
[16:36] That the pages we read the processed
[16:39] whether it be parchment which is which
[16:41] would be leather or the scrolls, the
[16:42] papyrus and the things that we read from
[16:44] plants. Is that not represent the very
[16:47] word of God? We're just using it as a
[16:49] type. I'm not saying thus sayith the
[16:51] Lord. That's what it meant. I'm just
[16:52] saying in in an image in type we can see
[16:55] that though this might not seem like
[16:57] much that as we read these things my
[17:00] cheat sheet just fell as we read these
[17:02] things that it has the ability to
[17:05] transform us. God's word has quickening
[17:08] power to change our character.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; It can renew our minds. It can wash our
[17:14] spirits. Can dermatize eternal plantings
[17:18] inside of us.
[17:20] And God has inspired and designed his
[17:23] word in a particular way to produce
[17:26] specific fruits if kept and unmixed.
[17:31] Now, we can't take this and and and mix
[17:35] it.
[17:37] We can't take it and try to do it
[17:38] ourselves a and add theology to it and
[17:41] add tradition to it and take uh and take
[17:44] our own ideas and say, "Well, I'm going
[17:46] to make it say this. I'm going to make
[17:47] it do that." No, we can't mix it. It's
[17:49] got to remain unmixed and it's got to be
[17:51] kept. It's got to be believed.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; So, it's got to be in the right kind of
[17:54] ground. It's got to have the right kind
[17:56] of nurture. But God has written it as a
[17:58] seed. He's designed it to where there's
[17:59] power in it to change us.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 55 6-11,
[18:06] seek ye the Lord while he may be found,
[18:08] and call ye upon him while he is near.
[18:11] Let the wicked forsake his way and the
[18:13] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[18:16] return unto the Lord and I will have
[18:18] mercy upon him and to our God for he
[18:21] will abundantly pardon. We read in the
[18:23] scripture how that in order to obtain
[18:25] mercy we have to sow in righteousness.
[18:28] In order to have mercy man must forsake
[18:30] his way and sow to righteousness. Come
[18:33] unto the Lord and he'll have mercy. Then
[18:35] he says for my thoughts are not your
[18:37] thoughts.
[18:38] Amen. God's thoughts are real. They are
[18:41] eternal. They already have substance and
[18:44] form. God's thoughts are are the eternal
[18:47] attributes. For my thoughts are not your
[18:49] thoughts. Neither are your ways my ways,
[18:51] sayeth the Lord. For as the heavens are
[18:53] higher than the earth, so are my ways
[18:54] higher than yours. And my thoughts than
[18:56] your thoughts. Now, catch this
[18:57] principle. says the uh Isaiah is drawing
[19:00] from and God is going to draw from the
[19:04] principles of sewing uh uh seed that's
[19:07] planted, germatized, and then growing
[19:10] through this process, this nurturing
[19:11] process. For as the rain cometh down,
[19:13] and the snow from heaven, and returneth
[19:15] not thither, but waterth the earth, and
[19:17] maketh it bring forth in bud, that it
[19:19] may give seed to the sewer and bread to
[19:20] the eater. There's the entire process.
[19:23] Seed is in the earth, the rain comes
[19:25] down, it grows, it's harvested, it's
[19:26] made into bread. and it benefits the
[19:30] swer, the eater. So shall my word be
[19:33] that goeth forth out of my mouth. This
[19:36] natural agricultural process ultimately
[19:39] yields something that's beneficial to
[19:42] the natural man. But he says, "My word
[19:44] that goes from my mouth is going to be
[19:46] the same way. It shall not return to me
[19:48] void.
[19:50] Just as there is rain that comes down
[19:52] from the earth and waters the ground,
[19:54] the word out of my mouth is not going to
[19:57] just return back to heaven, it's going
[19:59] to have an impact upon that which it
[20:01] waters. It's going to have an impact
[20:03] upon the seed upon that which it
[20:05] watered. And he says, "But it shall
[20:06] accomplish that which I please, and it
[20:08] shall prosper in the thing wherein to I
[20:11] sent it. It will be effective. It will
[20:14] be fruitful." The word is a seed.
[20:18] This Bible is God. We can say in word
[20:22] form or seed form. It contains the power
[20:24] and potential of God's word. It will not
[20:27] return void. All scriptur is given by
[20:29] inspiration of God. It is the word from
[20:32] his mouth. And the word from his mouth,
[20:34] he says, is like rain that falls down on
[20:37] the earth. And it doesn't just go back
[20:39] up without having first brought forth
[20:42] that which was planted and gives seed to
[20:45] the sewer and bread to the eater. his
[20:48] word will not return void.
[20:52] Now let if we examine that as an
[20:55] absolute truth that God's word is a seed
[20:57] with power to produce after its kind
[21:01] then
[21:04] if we can accept that notice what man
[21:07] can do to this seed in second Peter
[21:10] chapter 3 14 to 18
[21:18] I was going to make a joke that it's
[21:20] just going so easily this morning that
[21:21] I'm probably going to be done pretty
[21:22] quick. And it's like a let's keep track
[21:24] of who's here and who's not here.
[21:27] And but then I thought, well, that might
[21:29] be taken the wrong way. I was just going
[21:30] to joke around a little bit. But second
[21:33] Peter chapter 3 14 to18.
[21:36] Wherefore, beloved, seeing that you look
[21:39] for such things, you could go and read
[21:40] in here just how much these uh these
[21:44] things he's talking about. This glory,
[21:47] salvation, revelation of Jesus Christ.
[21:49] He says, "Be diligent that you may be
[21:52] found of him in peace without spot and
[21:54] blameless."
[21:56] What an interesting scripture to read
[21:58] after using the scriptures as a type of
[22:00] something that brings forth something
[22:01] spotted and gristled. It's a paradox.
[22:06] But yet we see here that uh we must be
[22:08] found without spot and blameless and
[22:10] account that the long suffen our Lord is
[22:12] salvation.
[22:14] and and really focus on this. Even as
[22:16] our beloved brother Paul also according
[22:18] to the wisdom which giveth unto him hath
[22:20] written unto you. Paul is now being
[22:24] acknowledged by Peter
[22:27] as being beloved and he has received
[22:30] wisdom.
[22:31] He's deferring even to the wisdom of
[22:33] Paul that's given unto him and he's
[22:36] written unto you as also in all his
[22:39] epistles.
[22:40] So now even the writings and the letters
[22:42] of Paul are being pointed to. Paul said
[22:45] Paul said Paul said speaking in them of
[22:48] these things in which are some things
[22:50] hard to be understood. So even
[22:52] acknowledging that everything Paul said
[22:54] wasn't easy to understand and yet
[22:56] acknowledging there's wisdom in it.
[22:58] There's wisdom in what brother Paul
[23:00] wrote. So there's listen it's scriptural
[23:03] to say brother Brandham said
[23:06] it's scriptural to call him brother
[23:07] Brandham.
[23:09] Uh maybe as he said, brother Paul here.
[23:11] Maybe we could say brother William, but
[23:13] yet it's it's just it's nothing weird or
[23:15] odd. I know there's some cults out there
[23:17] that use brother as kind of like a a
[23:19] formal title, but we just show it as a
[23:20] sense in a showing respect. And it says
[23:24] that Paul in his writings and his
[23:26] epistles says these things which are
[23:28] wise.
[23:30] Remember how Paul writing said the
[23:32] scriptur is able to make one wise. Now
[23:34] Peter, not Paul is saying this, but
[23:35] Peter is saying this about Paul's
[23:37] writing that his writings contain
[23:39] wisdom. And it says which they that are
[23:41] unlearned and unstable rest.
[23:46] The unlearned and unstable, the
[23:48] ignorant, the unwise, those that don't
[23:51] have the foundation of faith rest. That
[23:54] means they twist. They turn around. They
[23:56] torture it. The word actually means put
[23:59] to the rack.
[24:02] And they're they take it and they try to
[24:03] torture it, pick at it, twist it, find
[24:07] fault, make it pained. They pervert the
[24:11] meaning of brother Paul's writings. They
[24:15] pervert the meaning of brother Paul's
[24:17] teachings.
[24:19] And then Peter makes this extraordinary
[24:22] statement as they do also the other
[24:25] scriptures.
[24:26] So now Peter places Paul's letters and
[24:29] teachings on par with scripture.
[24:33] They they were accepted as God sent as
[24:36] being from God.
[24:38] It says that they twist these unto their
[24:41] own destruction. I'll come back to that.
[24:43] Let's finish reading these next two
[24:44] verses. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing
[24:46] you know these things before, you are
[24:48] not ignorant.
[24:50] Say that do not let Satan pray on your
[24:52] ignorance. Knowing these things before,
[24:54] beware lest ye also being led away with
[24:57] the heir of the wicked. What would it
[24:59] be? To pray on ignorance, to twist, to
[25:01] distort, fall from your own
[25:03] steadfastness,
[25:05] but grow in grace. There's that image
[25:07] again of growing, that seed being
[25:08] properly watered and growing in grace
[25:10] and in the knowledge of our Lord and
[25:11] Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory
[25:13] both now and forever. Amen.
[25:16] But he says that these unstable and
[25:18] unlearned men twist, distort, and
[25:20] pervert the meaning of Paul's sermons or
[25:23] writings or his epistles. And in doing
[25:26] so it perverts them because it says to
[25:29] their own destruction between waste or
[25:31] perishing or ruining
[25:33] perverting the scripture deforms the
[25:37] person.
[25:39] They twisted scripture. So they were
[25:41] trying trying to make Paul a twisted
[25:43] brother and all they did to themselves
[25:45] is they twisted themselves.
[25:48] Perverting the scripture deforms the
[25:51] person
[25:53] because it says they do it to their own
[25:54] destruction. Seeds have life with power
[25:57] to reproduce the original.
[26:00] Mixing life
[26:02] perverts that power.
[26:05] Whenever you hybrid, you make less.
[26:08] It veers into another territory. Now,
[26:10] now there's other things in there. It's
[26:12] not the original. We're not making an
[26:14] argument in terms of genetics of what's
[26:15] better. But if you take something that
[26:18] is pure and you mix it with something
[26:20] else in in in your eyes to make
[26:22] something better, more powerful, more
[26:24] resistant, you can't come back to the
[26:26] original
[26:28] because now it's something else.
[26:32] And Peter is saying that Paul has
[26:33] written things that we view as scripture
[26:37] and that these unlearned and unstable
[26:40] people, they twist it and pervert it and
[26:42] in doing so it causes their own
[26:43] destruction. And he warns, "Lest we be
[26:47] led astray of the error of the wicked
[26:49] would likewise be deformed by twisted
[26:52] scripture."
[26:54] I'm using this to emphasize the
[26:56] importance of the Bible. And as Peter
[26:59] plays Paul's letters and teachings on
[27:01] par with scripture, this is even more
[27:03] important considering what he said in
[27:05] chapter 1. For we have not followed
[27:08] cunningly devised fables. Second Peter
[27:10] chapter 1 16 to 21. when we made known
[27:13] unto you the power and coming of our
[27:15] Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses
[27:17] of his majesty. For he received from God
[27:20] the Father, honor and glory, when there
[27:22] came such a voice to him from the
[27:24] excellent glory. This is my beloved son
[27:26] in whom I'm well pleased. This is the
[27:28] mount transfiguration experience. And
[27:30] this voice which came from heaven, we
[27:32] heard when we were with him in the holy
[27:34] mount.
[27:35] We have also a more sure word of
[27:37] prophecy. The Bible contains the very
[27:40] breath of God. Prophecy.
[27:43] Prophecy in it being declaring things
[27:46] before time. Prophecy in that it
[27:49] declares an oracle of God. The thoughts
[27:51] of God. We have a more sure word of
[27:54] prophecy is vindicated.
[27:57] God backs it up. Where unto you, where
[27:59] unto ye do well that you take heed. Take
[28:02] heed to the word of prophecy and take
[28:05] heed to the vindicated prophecy as unto
[28:09] a light that shineth in a dark place
[28:10] until the day dawn and the day star
[28:12] arise in your hearts. Knowing this
[28:14] first. So there's these different places
[28:17] where knowing this first that there's a
[28:20] knowing. We read it Wednesday night.
[28:22] We're knowing this. These are things
[28:23] that we know beforehand. Knowing that
[28:26] these things are accomplished in our
[28:27] brethren elsewhere. Knowing uh that this
[28:30] is how Satan works. Knowing these things
[28:32] helps us and protects us. So knowing
[28:34] this verse that no prophecy of the
[28:36] scripture
[28:37] is of any private interpretation
[28:40] whether it be prophecy that declares the
[28:42] mind of God or prophecy that foretells
[28:44] the future. It is not interpreted
[28:46] individually
[28:48] but private carnal interpretation. For
[28:50] the prophecy came not in old time by the
[28:53] will of man but by holy men of God. They
[28:57] spake as they were moved by the Holy
[28:58] Ghost.
[29:00] The prophecy came not in old time by
[29:02] man's uncction or emphasis or his own
[29:04] thoughts, but holy men spake as God
[29:07] moved them to speak.
[29:10] That's what wrote our Bible.
[29:13] He says, "So know this that this
[29:15] prophecy which we read is from God."
[29:18] So when he comes back later in chapter 3
[29:20] and he says what Paul is writing in
[29:22] these epistles, he places them on par
[29:24] with this prophecy of old time. And he
[29:26] says we shouldn't twist that either. We
[29:29] shouldn't deform that because the word
[29:32] of God, the Bible, the scripture has
[29:34] power to change. And if you deform it,
[29:39] it changes its power.
[29:43] Jesus in John 5:es 30 to 40.
[29:48] He says, "I can of my own self do
[29:50] nothing. As I hear, I judge."
[29:54] Could show you in places where Jesus
[29:55] read where it was written of himself.
[29:58] It's an exercise I I undertook one time
[30:00] just looking at the word and said,
[30:02] "Well, did God always just speak to
[30:04] Jesus or did Jesus read in the Old
[30:06] Testament?" And we're reading it gets
[30:07] the revelation said, "That's me."
[30:10] And you know, Jesus would read in the
[30:12] Bible what pertained to him and he would
[30:15] get re it would be revealed to him
[30:16] that's me. You can do the same thing.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; You can read in the mirror of God's word
[30:21] and say that's me. That's me in this
[30:25] word. That's the power of this word. We
[30:28] can look into it and see ourselves. So
[30:30] Jesus says, "As I hear, I judge, and my
[30:32] judgments is just." My judgment is just
[30:34] because I seek not my own will, but the
[30:36] will of the father which hath sent me.
[30:39] If I bear witness of myself, my witness
[30:41] is not true.
[30:44] And and I'm and I'm I'm not going to
[30:47] take the time to read in the places
[30:48] where Jesus is reading in the word of
[30:51] God. I knew that it had been written of
[30:52] him. in those few places we can see it
[30:55] very clearly but he is talking about
[30:59] what testifies of him so he's saying
[31:01] that I don't testify of myself I'm not
[31:03] just saying hey I'm the Messiah he's
[31:05] saying that there's a witness to my
[31:07] messiahship there's something that has
[31:09] testified
[31:10] there is another that beareth witness of
[31:12] me verse 32 and I know that the witness
[31:16] which he witnessed of me is true you
[31:18] sent unto John and he beare witness
[31:20] under the truth but I receive not
[31:23] testimony for man. So he's not
[31:24] belittling John, but he says, "You sent
[31:26] unto John, and John witnessed of me.
[31:28] John testified of me. But these things I
[31:30] say that you might be saved." He was a
[31:32] burning and shining light, and ye were
[31:34] willing for a season to rejoice in his
[31:36] light. But I have greater witness than
[31:38] that of John. And what could be greater?
[31:42] What could be greater than this Elijah
[31:44] anointing? For the works which the
[31:46] father hath given me to finish the same
[31:48] works that I do bear witness of me that
[31:51] the father hath sent me. So it's his
[31:53] works
[31:55] testifying but continue to read this and
[31:57] you'll see that the works aren't the
[32:00] works that he does cannot in of
[32:02] themselves testify of him because that
[32:05] would be him testifying of himself. The
[32:06] works have they're witnessing of
[32:08] something else or witnessed by something
[32:10] else. Says and the father which have
[32:12] sent me have borne witness of me. You've
[32:14] neither heard his voice at any time, nor
[32:17] seen his shape. And ye have not his word
[32:19] abiding in you, for whom he hath sent
[32:21] him you believe not. So now he comes to
[32:24] the witness. Search the scriptures,
[32:27] for in them you think you have eternal
[32:29] life, and they are they which testify of
[32:34] me.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; When he said, I have a greater witness
[32:37] than John, and he begins to talk about
[32:38] his works, he wasn't saying, well, John
[32:40] was Elijah. He was anointed. He he
[32:43] introduced me and he was a great
[32:44] witness. But I have a greater witness.
[32:46] It's my vindicated works that I do. He's
[32:48] not even leaving it in that alone. He's
[32:50] saying that the scriptures testified
[32:53] that this would be
[32:56] the Bible that God wrote, their scrolls,
[32:58] their parchment, their books, the
[33:01] papyrus, however it is that they read
[33:03] it, their tablets.
[33:05] He says, "Search the scriptures." And
[33:07] even these very ones he's talking to,
[33:09] they believed that they would have
[33:10] eternal life, that there'd be this
[33:12] eternal unending reign of the Messiah.
[33:14] In them, you believe in a resurrection
[33:16] and eternal reign and power. In them,
[33:18] you believe you have eternal life. But
[33:19] it's the word which was written
[33:21] beforehand that testifies of me. And
[33:23] he's saying the word is a greater
[33:24] witness.
[33:26] This is how Jesus put more emphasis on
[33:28] the word than his works. Because even
[33:31] when he testifies of his works, he
[33:33] doesn't do it without saying the word
[33:34] testified of the works.
[33:37] He says, "And you will not come to me
[33:39] that you might have life."
[33:42] You will not come to me that you might
[33:44] have life. Do you realize that failing
[33:47] to search scripture is a failure to seek
[33:48] truth?
[33:51] That we can make these claims that I
[33:54] just want to know. I want to know God
[33:55] better and I want to find his heart and
[33:57] I want to know his mind and not read the
[33:59] Bible.
[34:01] Not search the scripture, but not do it
[34:03] with that heart of a critic or a skeptic
[34:06] to twist and distort. Not take the
[34:07] scriptures to rest with and twist them
[34:10] to fit your own image like this is what
[34:12] I want to be and this is what I want to
[34:13] do. Do you realize there's people that
[34:14] take this Bible and comb through it to
[34:17] justify homosexuality?
[34:20] To justify their lust and their
[34:23] perversions? They paint a picture of the
[34:25] gospel as just being welcoming and
[34:27] loving and kind. And what are they
[34:28] doing? They're taking the word of God
[34:30] and they're twisting it to fit their
[34:33] image. And what does it produce? It
[34:35] produces exactly that, a twisted image.
[34:41] But failing to search the scriptures,
[34:42] Jesus said,
[34:44] is a failure to seek for truth.
[34:48] And therefore, since the scriptures are
[34:49] they which testify of Christ, to change
[34:52] the scripture is to make it a false
[34:54] witness.
[34:56] Change the scripture. You change the
[34:58] nature and the character of the
[34:59] scripture. It's no longer the scripture,
[35:01] but it's a false witness. And what
[35:04] happens when the Bible says this is what
[35:06] the Messiah will do. This is what the
[35:07] Messiah will do. In the Bible, we
[35:08] believe the scripture, the scrolls, the
[35:10] Old Testament, they testify to the
[35:12] Messiah. What happens if you go and you
[35:14] change the Old Testament prophecies?
[35:16] It doesn't testify of the Messiah
[35:18] anymore. It testifies of something else.
[35:22] And Paul says there's not another Jesus.
[35:24] They're false messiahs. They're false
[35:26] Christ. They produced their own golden
[35:28] calf. They produced their own gods. They
[35:30] produced their own messiahs. And it's no
[35:32] longer the original witness.
[35:35] Satan's tactic has always been to
[35:36] pervert the original seed.
[35:39] He didn't have to write his own Bible.
[35:42] All he had to do is pervert the one God
[35:43] wrote. And it is in his nature to deform
[35:47] the character of the word. You deform
[35:50] the character of the word, you deform
[35:51] what it produces.
[35:54] Mark 12
[35:59] verses 18 to 27
[36:02] Jesus said, "Search the scripture
[36:04] d make a diligent inquiry."
[36:09] anymore. I think we we we live in a
[36:11] dangerous time where we can have
[36:14] uh brother GPT or more casually chat
[36:18] uh
[36:20] digest things itself and then spit out a
[36:22] product.
[36:24] I say here it is.
[36:27] Even this morning, Brother Jonathan
[36:29] Yerigga from Croatia sent me a a a quote
[36:33] and a question. And uh I like to think
[36:35] myself as a subject matter expert when
[36:37] it comes to the message of the hour, but
[36:39] I have a lot of friends around the world
[36:40] that ask me for help in translating
[36:42] because like we have no idea what this
[36:44] American phrase means and you with your
[36:46] pop culture dictionary certainly can
[36:48] figure this out for us. And the question
[36:50] today had to do with what brother Bannon
[36:52] was saying in a particular sermon
[36:53] because it had been transcribed to this
[36:56] is not a feeling up there but a
[36:59] believing up there. But then you go and
[37:02] you listen to it and it's very clear
[37:03] he's saying this is not a feeling affair
[37:06] this is a believing affair.
[37:10] And I and I use that just as an example
[37:12] of how that sometimes if we just want to
[37:14] know what brother Brandham said about
[37:16] emotions. We can just put that into the
[37:17] table and look up emotions.
[37:20] And I don't use the table to search. I
[37:22] use another application to search
[37:24] because I don't want voice of God
[37:26] knowing what I'm looking up.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; I'm just kidding. There's I use another
[37:31] another app that's very very useful for
[37:33] me in the way I like to study that has
[37:34] the message in it. And when I looked it
[37:36] up in there, it actually says believing
[37:38] affair. But we can just go to these
[37:40] things and ask for it to spit out what
[37:42] was said. Let's just look up in the
[37:44] Bible seed and it just produces it. And
[37:46] what we failed to do is take things in
[37:48] their full context.
[37:50] And by isolating scripture and isolating
[37:53] certain things, we can make it to say
[37:55] things that it's not actually trying to
[37:56] say. And people say, "Well, did you know
[37:58] the Bible said this?" I'm like, "Oh, I
[38:00] had no idea it said that." Wow, that's
[38:03] that I Yeah, I don't even know why. I
[38:05] don't even know why I believe that. And
[38:06] that you could be made to actually
[38:08] believe things that aren't real because
[38:10] people take it out of context. And it's
[38:12] just this sound bite, just sound bite.
[38:16] And I think it would be it's good when
[38:18] we search the scripture to not just
[38:20] keyword search,
[38:22] but use that key of faith to go into the
[38:26] scripture, read, and let it unlock
[38:27] something to us. In Mark 12 18 to 27,
[38:32] then cometh unto him the Sadducees which
[38:35] say there is no resurrection. That's why
[38:36] they were sad. You see, and they asked
[38:39] him, saying, I got that from brother
[38:40] George Martin from South Africa. Master
[38:44] Moses wrote unto us if a man's brother
[38:47] die and leave his wife behind him and
[38:50] leave no children that his brother
[38:51] should take his wife and raise up seed
[38:53] unto his brother. Okay, that is quoting
[38:58] scripture, right? Moses wrote this.
[39:02] Now, verse 20 comes this exercise.
[39:06] And notice just how this Moses wrote it.
[39:10] They believed this was the word of God.
[39:12] It had some meaning to it. But now let's
[39:15] make it interesting and let's come up
[39:17] with a hypothetical
[39:19] that and and then and then ask a
[39:21] question that causes to really wrestle
[39:23] with what this even means. Says now
[39:26] there were seven brethren and the first
[39:29] took a wife and dying left no seed and
[39:32] the second took her and died which the
[39:34] second takes her according to the law of
[39:35] Moses neither left he any seed and the
[39:39] third likewise.
[39:41] and the seven had her and left no seed.
[39:44] Last of all, the woman died also.
[39:46] In the resurrection, therefore, when
[39:48] they shall arise, whose wife shall be
[39:51] shall she be of them? For the seven had
[39:54] her to wife. Now,
[39:59] Jesus answers this so perfectly and so
[40:02] beautifully.
[40:04] And one of the first things that I'm
[40:06] sure that he catches right away, and
[40:09] that's why the writer wrote it this way.
[40:11] The Sadducees who didn't believe in a
[40:13] resurrection
[40:15] came and asked him what it meant.
[40:20] It's just like someone not even
[40:21] believing the Bible, but they want you
[40:22] to tell you what the Bible mean. What
[40:24] does the Bible mean when it says this?
[40:25] Do you even believe it? Well, no.
[40:29] Okay. What does it matter what it means?
[40:33] What does the Bible mean when it says
[40:34] this? Like, well, do you believe the
[40:36] Bible's true? No. Well, then I'll tell
[40:38] you what it means.
[40:42] Do you get it now? Do you understand it?
[40:44] What did you say?
[40:48] Because what? They don't even believe
[40:50] it.
[40:52] And here are those that don't even
[40:53] believe in the resurrection have
[40:54] concocted this contrived question and
[40:57] inquiry of Jesus.
[41:00] Glad there was no camera over there
[41:01] because I'm sure that's going to make
[41:03] somebody's tick tocker real.
[41:06] And they contrive it in such a painful
[41:09] way that a man marries a woman and has
[41:13] six brothers and they all marry the same
[41:15] woman and they all die with no seed.
[41:18] And I I mean if someone asked me that, I
[41:21] might have just say, "Good question." Or
[41:22] go ask your pastor. And if I'm your
[41:24] pastor, then I might say, "Well, who
[41:27] who's to say they're going to be in
[41:28] heaven?" You know, hell might be the
[41:30] place where one woman has seven
[41:32] husbands.
[41:34] But he says and answers in verse 24, "Do
[41:37] you not therefore heir?" Why? Because
[41:40] you know not the scriptures, neither the
[41:43] power of God.
[41:45] So he's already hitting him where they
[41:48] don't believe in a resurrection. Why do
[41:50] they not believe in a resurrection? They
[41:51] don't know the scripture.
[41:53] And because they don't know the
[41:54] scripture, they don't know the power of
[41:55] God.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; The power of God was in the prophecy was
[41:58] in the word, the mind of God that seeds.
[42:00] He says, "You heir, you are an heir
[42:02] because you do not know the scripture.
[42:04] And not knowing the scripture, you do
[42:06] not know the power of God. For when they
[42:07] shall rise from the dead, they neither
[42:09] marry nor give it in marriage, but are
[42:11] as the angels which are in heaven. and
[42:14] as touching the dead that they rise.
[42:16] Have you not read in the bo the book of
[42:18] Moses how in the bush God spake unto
[42:20] them saying, I am the God of Abraham and
[42:21] the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
[42:24] And then this beautiful answer, he is
[42:25] not the God of the dead, but the God of
[42:28] the living.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Ye therefore do greatly heir. Such
[42:31] wisdom.
[42:33] Such wisdom in the way that he answers
[42:35] this question. And why do they greatly
[42:38] heir? They greatly heir not knowing the
[42:40] scripture. And he takes this answer that
[42:42] in reading it, we might just have go
[42:44] ahead and have a whole semester on
[42:46] debating what what this means and the
[42:48] brothers taking a wife and what these
[42:50] implications might be. But he takes it
[42:52] and he turns it from the scripture. He
[42:54] says the Bible said he's the God of the
[42:56] living
[42:57] &gt;&gt; and you're worried about the dead.
[43:00] If I could use this scripture to make a
[43:02] point. Ignorance of the scripture allows
[43:04] the Bible to be misinterpreted.
[43:06] Ignorance of the scripture allows the
[43:08] Bible to be misplaced. Ignorance of the
[43:11] scripture allows these things to be
[43:14] questioned.
[43:16] Missing the point makes a way for the
[43:18] Bible to be questioned dishonestly.
[43:20] Clearly, the Sadducees, not believing
[43:22] it, questioned it dishonestly because
[43:24] they missed the point of Moses's
[43:26] prophecy
[43:28] or his guidance.
[43:30] We can misuse the word. We can ignore
[43:32] the word. Both will be to our
[43:34] destruction.
[43:36] The deformation of God's character leads
[43:38] to the deformation of our character.
[43:40] This word is his character. It's his
[43:42] attributes. It's his nature. It's a love
[43:43] letter to us. We change it, it changes
[43:45] the message of love to us. We change it,
[43:48] it changes God's character. We change
[43:51] God's character to be wishy-washy and
[43:54] and a and we change it into something
[43:56] that's not rooted in justice, then it
[43:57] produces the image of anything goes.
[44:02] In Mark 7:es 1-13,
[44:06] I know this is just very simple, very
[44:09] straightforward and direct.
[44:12] But the defformation of character begins
[44:14] with the deforming of God's word.
[44:17] We can allow it to be misinterpreted or
[44:19] twisted
[44:21] or deformed.
[44:23] It won't have the effect that it ought
[44:25] to have on us. In Mark 7:es 1-13, then
[44:29] came together unto him the Pharisees and
[44:32] certain of the scribes. These scribes
[44:34] are they which would for a living
[44:39] copied the scrolls.
[44:42] They knew the word because they were
[44:44] constantly writing it. That's who these
[44:46] scribes were. So the Pharisees who tried
[44:49] to live it and enforce it, the scribes
[44:50] who wrote it, which came from Jerusalem.
[44:52] And when they saw some of his disciples
[44:54] eat bread with with defiled, that is to
[44:56] say, with unwashing hands. So they ate
[44:58] bread with defiled hands. They didn't
[45:00] wash them. They found fault. That is
[45:03] just exactly what a pherocetical uh
[45:05] spirit will do is they'll find fault.
[45:10] For the Pharisees and all the Jews,
[45:12] except they wash their hands often
[45:17] the tradition of the fathers. And when
[45:19] they came from the market, except they
[45:21] wash, they eat not. I appreciate Mark
[45:23] giving us some of these backgrounds. And
[45:25] many other things there be, which they
[45:27] have received to hold. So this is
[45:30] they've been given to keep as the
[45:33] washing of cups and pots, brazen
[45:34] vessels, and of tables. Then the
[45:37] Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why
[45:39] walk thou? Why walk not thy disciples
[45:43] according to the tradition of the
[45:45] elders, but eat bread with unwashing
[45:48] hands?
[45:50] And he answered and said unto them, and
[45:52] notice where he goes, goes right to
[45:54] scripture. Well, hath Isaiah prophesied
[45:57] of you hypocrites, as it is written,
[46:00] this people honor me with their lips,
[46:01] but their heart is far from me. How be
[46:03] it in vain do they worship me, teaching
[46:05] for doctrines the commandments of men?
[46:08] For laying aside the command of God, you
[46:10] hold the tradition of men, as the
[46:11] washing of pots and cups, as many other
[46:14] such things like such like things ye do.
[46:17] So he takes the word and how that they
[46:20] lay aside God's commandments and God's
[46:22] clear spoken prophesied written rule and
[46:26] they elevate their own interpretation
[46:28] and traditions.
[46:30] And he said unto them, "Full well ye
[46:34] reject the commandment of God, that you
[46:35] may keep your own tradition." So there's
[46:38] the word condemning them beforehand. For
[46:40] Moses said, "Honor thy father and thy
[46:42] mother, and who so cursseeth thy father
[46:44] or mother, let him die the death. But ye
[46:47] say, if a man shall say to his father or
[46:50] mother, it is Corbin, that is to say, a
[46:52] gift by what whatsoever thou mightest be
[46:54] profited by me, he shall be free."
[46:58] This is the twisting perverting of
[47:00] scripture. And you suffer him no more to
[47:02] do ought for his father or his mother
[47:05] making and I'm not I guess there's much
[47:08] more we maybe we could get into on the
[47:10] logistics of that the application of
[47:11] those things and what Jesus is calling
[47:13] out. But if we could say God gave a
[47:16] word, man built all these other things
[47:18] around it
[47:19] and and and called it tradition. And
[47:22] they judge Christ and his disciples by
[47:25] the tradition, not by the word. Because
[47:28] that's what that's what they want to do
[47:29] is they they'll judge you by the
[47:30] traditions that people have made of it.
[47:32] They do they do it about even the
[47:33] message of the hour. They judge brother
[47:35] Brandon by the traditions we made out of
[47:37] it and not by what he actually taught.
[47:42] But he says, "Making the word of God of
[47:45] none effect through your tradition,
[47:48] which ye have delivered, and many such
[47:50] like things do ye."
[47:53] When the word was given and asked to be
[47:55] kept, when you change it, you make it no
[48:00] longer effective.
[48:03] It's no longer able to produce what God
[48:05] sent it to produce. God's word is a
[48:07] seed. And if planted in the right kind
[48:10] of ground and nurtured, it'll produce
[48:12] exactly after its kind. It will produce
[48:15] godliness. It'll produce the fruits of
[48:17] the spirit. God's word will produce
[48:19] godliness.
[48:20] God's word will produce the word every
[48:23] time in flesh. But change it ever so
[48:26] much. It changes the expression. It's
[48:28] just like taking a corn of wheat or a
[48:31] corn of corn and plant it into the
[48:33] ground and it begins to grow and then
[48:34] allow another stock to fall over that.
[48:37] And the stock until can grow up, but as
[48:40] it grows, it grows deformed.
[48:42] It grows slanted, bent just a certain
[48:45] way. There's a grace in this analogy
[48:47] because some of us have genuine word
[48:49] growing inside of us, but we've allowed
[48:51] things to influence us and cause us to
[48:53] bend a certain way that's not according
[48:56] to the word of God, but according to
[48:58] tradition.
[49:01] We make the word of God of none effect
[49:02] through tradition. What does that speak
[49:04] to? We deform the nature of the word.
[49:07] Therefore, it deforms the character that
[49:09] it produces.
[49:13] Just have a few scriptures before we
[49:14] close. This is my main one in closing.
[49:17] This is my
[49:19] uh my main point here at the end. Psalms
[49:22] chapter 1, the whole chapter verses 1-6.
[49:24] Blessed is the man.
[49:27] It's a beautiful way to open the Psalms
[49:30] says blessed is the man that walketh
[49:32] not.
[49:34] So it it it's going to begin with what
[49:36] he is not what he does not do and it be
[49:38] it begins to describe the state and the
[49:41] progression of one who leaves the word
[49:44] of God who walks not in the counsel of
[49:46] the ungodly. So there is one who begins
[49:49] to walk according to the interpretation
[49:53] twisting perverting teachings of the
[49:55] ungodly
[49:57] nor standeth in the way of sinners. that
[49:59] once we have allowed our our ears to be
[50:01] had by the ungodly, we will now go from
[50:05] walking to standing in the way of
[50:08] sinners. To not just believe something
[50:10] wrong, but now to do something wrong.
[50:13] Nor siteth in the seat of the scornful.
[50:15] Now it has run its course. Now it's
[50:18] enthroned and we sit down as a scorner,
[50:21] as a skeptic, as a scoffer, as a critic,
[50:23] as one who finds fault.
[50:26] Blessed is the man that is not walking
[50:28] in the counsel of the ungodly, for he
[50:30] will not stand in the way of sinners,
[50:31] nor will he ultimately sit in the seat
[50:33] of the scornful. Remember, the scorner
[50:35] is unable to have wisdom and find truth.
[50:38] If you search the scripture, if you
[50:40] search the word of God trying to find
[50:42] fault, you will find fault, but you will
[50:44] not find truth. You may find facts that
[50:47] you can use to substantiate fault, but
[50:50] you will not find truth with those
[50:52] facts.
[50:54] Blessed is the man who walketh not.
[50:59] Verse two, but his delight is in the law
[51:02] of the Lord, the scriptures.
[51:06] And in his law he meditate day and
[51:08] night. We found in the scripture where
[51:10] Jesus prayed in the morning, he prayed
[51:11] in the evening. Now he meditates in the
[51:14] word day and night. And he shall be like
[51:17] a tree planted by the rivers of waters.
[51:20] I see the image of the rod planted there
[51:23] before the watering troughs that
[51:25] bringeth forth his fruit in his season.
[51:28] His leaf also shall not wither, and
[51:30] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. This
[51:32] is the power of delighting in the word
[51:35] of God. This is the power of scripture.
[51:37] The ungodly are not so, but are like the
[51:39] chaff which a wind driveth away.
[51:42] Therefore, the ungodly shall not stand
[51:45] in the judgment, nor sinners in the
[51:47] congregation of the righteous. For the
[51:50] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous,
[51:52] but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
[51:57] That image of those that twist and
[51:59] distort the law of the Lord to their own
[52:02] perishing.
[52:04] Blessed is the man whose delight is in
[52:06] the word of God. Whose delight and
[52:07] pleasure who takes time to read the
[52:09] Bible to pray
[52:12] in reading the word of God. His delight
[52:14] to this is what the Bible said. Blessed
[52:15] is the man who delights in the word of
[52:17] God. And he will be like a tree planted
[52:20] by rivers of waters who are going to
[52:22] receive strength, who are going to bring
[52:25] forth fruit, whose leaves will not
[52:28] wither,
[52:30] and whatever he does will prosper.
[52:33] You need the Bible to be fruitful.
[52:37] You need scripture to be fruitful. The
[52:41] Bible is God's word and the Bible is the
[52:44] believer's ultimate.
[52:48] The Sadducees who do not even believe
[52:51] in the New Testament will ask you which
[52:54] would you rather have
[52:57] a message book or the Bible
[53:01] and you say well God is not a God of the
[53:03] libraries
[53:05] he's a God of revelation maybe we'd
[53:07] answer completely but they come up with
[53:08] these hypotheticals where you try to
[53:10] take what are you going to believe more
[53:13] what are you going to believe more which
[53:15] one is more important
[53:19] Let the sophist debate it because the
[53:21] next question is God great enough to
[53:23] create a rock so heavy that even he
[53:25] can't lift it.
[53:29] Turtles all the way down is what it is
[53:31] for those people.
[53:35] But
[53:37] brother Benham said to me and to those
[53:39] that I hope I'm leading if I'm saying
[53:40] that correctly the Bible is our
[53:42] absolute.
[53:44] So if you don't make the Bible your
[53:46] absolute, then very clearly, very
[53:49] clearly, Brother Brand's nowhere close
[53:50] to being an ultimate or a voice or an
[53:52] absolute
[53:54] because he said to me, to those I'm
[53:56] leading,
[53:58] right? If you're a disciple, if you're
[54:00] being taught, the Bible says you shall
[54:01] become as the one who's teaching you. So
[54:05] if that's the aspiration and that's the
[54:06] goal, then ultimately truly a sincere
[54:08] heart will flip to where they do not
[54:10] make him a god, but they make him an
[54:13] example and a teacher who told us that
[54:16] this Bible was our absolute.
[54:19] That's what brother Brandham taught.
[54:23] And if you're ignorant of what he
[54:24] taught, then it can be twisted.
[54:27] It can make him make him it can make him
[54:30] to be something in your mind that he's
[54:31] not.
[54:37] Brother Brandon said he preached the
[54:38] same gospel Paul preached.
[54:40] Second Timothy chapter 4 verse 13 as
[54:42] he's writing. He says, "The cloak that I
[54:44] left at Troest with carpass when thou
[54:46] comest bring with thee." This is one of
[54:50] the things that people criticize. Man,
[54:52] he only had one coat. You know, did did
[54:55] Amazon Prime same day delivery now? I
[54:57] mean, he could get a good
[54:59] Amazon branded puffer jacket, you know,
[55:02] for like 15 bucks on Prime Day and get
[55:04] it same day and return it the next when
[55:07] winter's over.
[55:11] But he says, "And the books,
[55:15] but especially the parchments."
[55:19] Especially the parchments. You know what
[55:21] that was? The word
[55:24] especially.
[55:26] Bring my coat, bring the books, but
[55:29] especially
[55:31] especially bring the word,
[55:33] especially bring those scriptures
[55:37] because through patience and the comfort
[55:40] of the scripture, I made strong. I went
[55:44] and I consulted the scriptures and it's
[55:46] in those scriptures I saw Jesus Christ.
[55:48] It's in those scriptures that I saw that
[55:50] Jesus Christ was indeed the Messiah.
[55:54] He valued those parchments.
[55:58] Remember brother Earl Williams telling
[55:59] the story? Brother Philip, we were
[56:01] testifying about what a precious brother
[56:03] he was and he told the testimony of
[56:07] picking up brother Brandham. They were
[56:08] going to be going here in Arizona
[56:10] somewhere going on to meet with some
[56:11] ministers who wanted to debate and talk
[56:13] about the Bible. And um and if I'm
[56:15] remembering the story correctly, I
[56:17] believe it was brother Earl telling it.
[56:18] Um, and I don't believe it was brother
[56:19] Billy Paul that was the one that but
[56:21] brother Earl went to go pick up brother
[56:23] Brandham and come back to the room uh to
[56:26] pick up brother Brandham in the room and
[56:27] go back to the restaurant. So he had
[56:28] seen these pastors there and they all
[56:30] had their Bibles. And so brother Earl
[56:31] went to pick up brother Bram and he said
[56:33] and he saw that brother Bram was leaving
[56:34] the hotel without his Bible. He said,
[56:37] "Brother Bram, don't you think you need
[56:39] to bring your Bible for this debate?"
[56:41] And he goes, "Their Bible reads just
[56:42] like mine.
[56:46] That Bible is precious to us. I love how
[56:49] it the message teaches us to respect it.
[56:52] One thing I especially love and I can
[56:55] say this about my my son Elliot. Don't
[56:58] put something on top of a Bible. He'll
[57:00] correct you real quick.
[57:02] What are you doing? What are you doing?
[57:05] Sorry. Sorry.
[57:08] Something that we should have that kind
[57:09] of respect for.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, is it is this itself an
[57:14] idol?
[57:16] But does God come from this? Can it be
[57:19] made an idol? Can it be twisted? Can it
[57:20] be deformed? Could we rip the pages out
[57:22] of it and tear it up and burn it? We
[57:24] haven't burnt up God. But in this,
[57:26] there's something supernatural. And Paul
[57:27] as a prophet said, "Specially, bring me
[57:30] those parchments."
[57:33] And as he read those parchments and even
[57:35] those books clothed in that cloak, he
[57:38] said in 2 Corinthians 4:5, "For we
[57:40] preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus
[57:42] the Lord."
[57:45] What was happening? The Bible came from
[57:46] his message. It wasn't Paul that came
[57:48] from the message. And it wasn't his
[57:51] message coming from the Bible, but it
[57:53] was the Bible coming from the message.
[57:56] My admonishment to you in identifying
[57:58] the things that the devil exploits to
[58:02] prevent faith or hinder faith is a lack
[58:04] of a prayer life and an unfamiliarity
[58:09] with the Bible.
[58:12] Ignoring God and being ignorant of
[58:14] scripture are two ways that someone can
[58:17] go from believing in God to not
[58:20] believing at all
[58:22] like that.
[58:25] because you never knew it for yourself.
[58:28] And I would say that, Lord willing, on
[58:31] Wednesday night, we'll
[58:33] continue on this subject, but I would
[58:35] say that as a as a dad, these are things
[58:38] I want my children to hear. As a pastor,
[58:41] I think these things are very important
[58:42] for our church as families because our
[58:44] instructions are to the individuals and
[58:46] to families that we ought to have these
[58:49] things in our hearts. Brother Joel, I
[58:51] was thinking about you Wednesday night,
[58:53] a young man living on his own, working
[58:56] hard,
[58:57] uh, making a living, enjoying hobbies
[59:01] and those things that even for him in
[59:04] his life, prayer is important. Reading
[59:06] the Bible is important. Said, well, he
[59:07] doesn't he's not married, he didn't have
[59:09] kids. Doesn't matter. Praying, reading
[59:12] our Bibles is what's going to make us
[59:13] strong Christians. And if you don't do
[59:15] either of those, you may be become a
[59:18] brandite through and through hardcore,
[59:21] right? Waiting for a tent revival,
[59:24] dying, still believing in it, but never
[59:26] know God.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Never know God because you didn't pray
[59:30] and you didn't read your Bibles to meet
[59:31] the God of the message.
[59:34] Let us not be ignorant of scripture.
[59:38] Let it not let us not have our character
[59:40] deformed.
[59:42] Let us read the Bible and pray for
[59:44] revelation that God would quicken it to
[59:46] us and it will make a difference in your
[59:49] lives. You want to be spiritual, read
[59:51] your Bible and pray that stand today.
[59:54] Musicians
[59:56] coming to your instruments.
[1:00:05] We could bow our heads in a word of
[1:00:07] prayer. I'd like to pray for you.
[1:00:12] And I'm not
[1:00:14] I'm
[1:00:17] I tell you I am not using artificial
[1:00:19] intelligence for this.
[1:00:21] This is real world
[1:00:24] experience and wrestling things out with
[1:00:26] the Lord. And
[1:00:28] even the attacks of the enemy against
[1:00:31] our family, against myself, the all the
[1:00:34] darkness that seems to press in has
[1:00:36] highlighted this to me. prayer.
[1:00:40] Don't ignore God. Read. Get to know God.
[1:00:44] Our gracious heavenly father, today, as
[1:00:46] we bow our heads and our hearts, we're
[1:00:49] especially needy because we recognize
[1:00:50] the lateness of the time.
[1:00:54] And Lord, there's so much that seems to
[1:00:56] press upon us
[1:00:59] fellowshipping. And as a family this
[1:01:00] morning on the way to church, we were
[1:01:01] just talking about how people aren't
[1:01:04] quick to render aid anymore and they
[1:01:06] just assume that somebody's already
[1:01:08] called or somebody has help on the way
[1:01:10] because of all our devices and our
[1:01:12] connectivity.
[1:01:14] And Lord, I believe all these uh
[1:01:17] connections
[1:01:19] have just
[1:01:21] cause that switchboard to be so full
[1:01:23] that we don't open up that channel to
[1:01:25] heaven like we ought to.
[1:01:27] And so Lord, I pray that there would be
[1:01:29] a greater spirit of prayer amongst us as
[1:01:30] individuals and as families. May we find
[1:01:32] time to pray and read together.
[1:01:35] Lord, even if that devotion just
[1:01:37] consists of reading scripture than
[1:01:38] praying, those are two things that we
[1:01:41] know are your will for us.
[1:01:44] And Lord, we don't have to be the prayer
[1:01:47] warriors of old that pray all night or
[1:01:51] we draw ourselves to a secret place and
[1:01:53] we pray and we pray and we pray with
[1:01:54] such a tremendous anointing. Lord, we're
[1:01:56] not all called to that.
[1:01:59] In the same way that some men are so
[1:02:01] called to preach this word of God with
[1:02:02] such tremendous anointing, Lord, that
[1:02:04] even myself, I just am so in awe of
[1:02:07] those gifts. I recognize that's not my
[1:02:10] gift.
[1:02:12] The same way there's those that aren't
[1:02:13] even called to preach, but have these
[1:02:14] tremendous gifts of prayer,
[1:02:17] but yet I'm still called to pray. Still
[1:02:20] called to preach.
[1:02:22] Now Lord, if we are able to read, then I
[1:02:24] believe we should be reading the
[1:02:25] scripture.
[1:02:27] Lord, if we lack for things to read,
[1:02:29] then that would be my prayer. Inspire
[1:02:31] me, Lord.
[1:02:32] Direct me. Give me a plan.
[1:02:36] And Lord, the world would say, "It takes
[1:02:38] so many days to establish a habit."
[1:02:41] And we certainly would not want want it
[1:02:43] to become tradition. But I don't think
[1:02:45] it would be anything wrong with us
[1:02:46] praying right now. Lord, give me the
[1:02:49] habit and the discipline of praying and
[1:02:50] reading my Bible. Help me, Lord, to
[1:02:52] establish some rhythm, some
[1:02:54] faithfulness, so that I can return to it
[1:02:57] in the time that I need it the most.
[1:02:59] Bless these people that were here today.
[1:03:02] So many gone,
[1:03:04] but yet so much more here. And this is
[1:03:08] worth every effort. And I pray that
[1:03:10] you'd bless it, Lord. I ask all this in
[1:03:12] the name of Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:03:14] Amen.
