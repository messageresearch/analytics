[0:00] Matthew 1:es 18 to 23. Now the birth of
[0:04] Jesus Christ was on this wise when as
[0:06] his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph
[0:09] before they came together she was found
[0:11] with child of the Holy Ghost. It settles
[0:14] the question of who's the father. Joseph
[0:18] then Joseph her husband being a just man
[0:20] and not willing to make her a public
[0:22] example was minded to put her away
[0:24] privy. So we see that she's with child.
[0:26] He knows this is not his. He doesn't
[0:29] understand the context. So then it says,
[0:31] "But while he thought on these things,
[0:33] behold, the angel Lord appeared unto him
[0:35] in a dream, saying St. Joseph, thou son
[0:37] of David, fear not to take unto thee
[0:40] Mary thy wife, for that which is
[0:42] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost,
[0:45] and she shall bring forth a son, and
[0:47] thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he
[0:48] shall save his people from their sins."
[0:51] Now all this was done that it might be
[0:52] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[0:54] by the prophet, saying, "Behold, a
[0:56] virgin shall be with child, and shall
[0:58] bring forth a son, and they shall call
[1:00] his name Emmanuel, which being
[1:02] interpreted is God with us." Amen. You
[1:06] can be seated.
[1:09] I have did feel directed towards a a
[1:12] Christmas thought. There's a lot of
[1:13] things I'd been looking at uh in the
[1:15] latter part of the year where it seemed
[1:16] like it kept coming up um in certain
[1:18] context. And so, uh, it is a Christmas
[1:21] message. And my title is a little
[1:24] catchy, but it's the second Noel. And
[1:27] using that phrase, you're probably
[1:29] thinking of the first Noel. And it is a
[1:32] uh a very popular uh Christmas song. It
[1:35] was originally a a poem, I believe in
[1:37] German or maybe French. And then there's
[1:39] an English translation, not a
[1:40] translation, but an English version of
[1:42] the first Noel. And in that it says in
[1:44] the first Noel, the angels did say uh
[1:47] the angels said to the shepherds, "Born
[1:49] is the king of Israel." That was the
[1:51] pronouncement, the first Noel. And Noel
[1:53] essentially means Christmas. Um and
[1:55] that's the the meaning. It could have
[1:57] been called the second Christmas, but I
[1:58] just felt um the second Noel might might
[2:01] not be as uh clickbaity as the second
[2:05] Christmas, but this uh this is my
[2:07] thought in drawing from even that that
[2:09] song, Born is the King of Israel. That
[2:11] was the first Christmas was that birth
[2:13] of the king. And I like to explore it
[2:16] from this standpoint even as you see in
[2:18] this side the slide. This is
[2:19] Michelangelo's beta which is uh a
[2:23] sculpture of Mary holding Jesus not at
[2:26] his birth but after his death. And so
[2:28] I'm wanting to bring those two images
[2:30] together and the connection between uh
[2:33] conception and the cross or birth and
[2:36] the and death are uh reflected in art.
[2:38] As a matter of fact, when it comes to
[2:40] the birth of Jesus Christ, this is kind
[2:42] of where I begin to see this theme as
[2:44] it's represented in art a number of
[2:45] times there's an infant Christ who's
[2:48] portrayed carrying a cross. Um, in one
[2:51] particular piece of artwork, it's called
[2:52] the Annunciation. It's part of a much
[2:54] larger uh um altar piece, but you see, I
[2:57] don't know if you could see it here. I
[2:58] magnified it to the left side, but you
[3:00] see this infant being sent down from the
[3:02] father carrying a cross. And there's the
[3:04] angel giving this enunciation to Mary
[3:06] that she would receive a child. And so
[3:09] this image of the conception of Christ
[3:11] or the birth of Christ to the cross um
[3:14] is connected quite a bit in in imagery
[3:16] and in art and storytelling. And
[3:18] actually the early church uh celebrated
[3:21] Jesus's conception and death on the same
[3:23] day. And they believe that this is the
[3:25] day he was conceived. This is the day
[3:26] that he died. And so nine months later
[3:28] is how they begin to establish and fix a
[3:30] date for for Christmas. And so this idea
[3:34] of conception and birth and being bound
[3:37] together with even redemption which is
[3:39] what the cross represents uh is even
[3:42] part of the the Jewish tradition.
[3:44] Believe we've read this before. One of
[3:46] the rabbis in the earliest early century
[3:48] said in Nissan the world was created. In
[3:50] Nissan the patriarchs were born on
[3:53] Passover Isaac was born. And in Nissan
[3:56] our ancestors will re be redeemed in the
[3:59] time to come. And so some of the
[4:01] different rabbis and the oral tradition
[4:03] and the Talmud and and and the different
[4:06] storytellings of the rabbis, there might
[4:08] be different dates they affixed to it,
[4:09] but they put the birth and the death.
[4:11] They begin to put all those things on
[4:13] the same time at the same date because
[4:15] they they saw birth and life being
[4:18] associated with this redemption. In some
[4:20] modern art, we see it reflected where
[4:22] this particular piece here and there's a
[4:24] number of other ones where this is
[4:26] called the manger and the cross where we
[4:27] see this nativity scene but on a hill
[4:30] far away there in the background
[4:32] foreshadowing not just his birth but his
[4:34] death. uh it's it's represented in that
[4:37] image and in that picture. And art gives
[4:40] us an opportunity to do that. Or if
[4:41] you're you're telling a story, if you
[4:43] you can foreshadow, you can use this
[4:45] kind of imagery to portray that yes,
[4:47] this is a time of life coming forth, but
[4:50] at in the in the future, there's a cross
[4:53] to hang on. And and this is I almost
[4:56] thought about calling this um Christmas
[4:58] cliche because I think it is a very
[5:00] common theme to look at those two things
[5:02] together. So I don't think for a moment
[5:04] that I I feel like I'm breaking new
[5:05] ground here, but I do want to cover this
[5:08] very elementary principle uh about the
[5:10] the birth of Christ and the death of
[5:13] Christ being seen in the same image. And
[5:16] this isn't an odd notion as there's a
[5:19] significant symmetry between Christ's
[5:21] birth and his death. In Matthew 1 21 it
[5:25] says, "And she shall bring forth a son."
[5:27] This is what the angel says to Joseph in
[5:30] his dream. And we know we could read in
[5:32] other places where at the enunciation
[5:34] the angel is turn telling Mary that the
[5:36] Holy Ghost shall overshadow you and
[5:37] you're going to conceive and bring forth
[5:39] a son. And so it says she shall bring
[5:41] forth a son. That's birth. That's life.
[5:45] And thou shalt call his name Jesus. And
[5:47] so this uh Jehovah's Savior for he shall
[5:50] save his people from their sins. If you
[5:53] think about what this means, she a birth
[5:56] and salvation. It actually takes the
[5:58] manger and Mount Calvary and puts them
[6:00] in the same sentence. Puts them together
[6:02] in the same announcement to Joseph. She
[6:05] shall give birth and we know that's
[6:07] going to be uh there's going to place
[6:08] him in a manger. But then also he shall
[6:11] save. This is going to be through
[6:12] through his death. So birth and death
[6:14] are in this announcement to Joseph. And
[6:17] we know as we even have mentioned
[6:19] recently in these portraits of humanity
[6:21] and divinity that Jesus shared um the
[6:23] same kind of beginning of man being born
[6:25] of a woman and the same end of humanity
[6:29] uh uh by dying that that's the book ends
[6:31] to life. You're born and you die. In
[6:35] John Job 14:es 1 and two it says man
[6:38] that is born of a woman is of a few days
[6:40] and full of trouble. In some Bibles I
[6:42] think the heading says death comes to us
[6:44] all soon or eventually. He cometh forth
[6:46] like a flower and is cut down. He fleth
[6:48] also as a shadow and continueeth not.
[6:51] This is all men that man is born uh and
[6:55] it's a man born of a woman. If you if
[6:57] you're born of flesh and blood, then you
[6:59] don't live forever. You just have a
[7:01] definite time on earth and it's the
[7:03] number of days that we have and it's
[7:05] full of trouble. And we could all say
[7:06] amen to that. Uh but then he's but then
[7:09] he comes to the grave. Hebrews chapter 9
[7:12] 27 says, "As it is appointed unto men,
[7:14] once to die, but after this judgment."
[7:17] We know that it's been said that there's
[7:19] two things that are certain, death and
[7:21] taxes.
[7:22] And some of you have figured out the
[7:24] other part. Uh but yet the death part
[7:26] you can't figure out. Like that's the
[7:28] part these things are certain. And I
[7:30] knew I was forgetting something, but
[7:31] even brother Steven and sister Becky
[7:34] Sees, they are here for the winter.
[7:36] They're snowbirds, but they've just been
[7:37] faithful. They've jumped in. They've
[7:39] supported. And I had it even written
[7:40] down and everything. And I forgot to
[7:42] mention, can we start over?
[7:46] I'm going to have to cut that out of the
[7:48] post edits and keep me under an hour.
[7:51] Brother Eleazer is preaching in
[7:52] Flagstaff this weekend, I believe. So,
[7:54] remember him in prayer. Uh, there's a
[7:56] lot of things I mean, can we start over?
[7:57] I mean, no. I feel like I've [laughter]
[7:59] just forgotten a lot of stuff. But as it
[8:01] is appointed unto men once to die, and
[8:03] after this judgment, death is certain.
[8:05] It comes to us all. Henry Wodsworth
[8:08] Longfellow writes in the Psalm of Life,
[8:09] "Art is long and time is fleeting, and
[8:11] our hearts, though stout and brave,
[8:14] still like muffled drums, are beating
[8:17] funeral marches to the grave." This is
[8:20] this is what mankind is from birth.
[8:23] There there's there's an end. When
[8:25] you're born, I know that we don't uh see
[8:27] our children come into the world and we
[8:29] begin to think about when they're going
[8:30] to die and their death. That's not
[8:32] what's in our mind. But the Bible's
[8:33] telling us that a man who's born has a
[8:36] certain end. There's a there's a time
[8:38] coming when life will expire.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; And so on the night that Christ was
[8:44] born,
[8:45] we could say that for all mankind, a man
[8:48] born of a woman, that there's this end
[8:50] in sight. There is a death on the
[8:52] horizon. But even on the night that
[8:54] Christ was born, there was a connection
[8:55] to the day of his death. There was a
[8:57] foreshadowing. In Luke 2:7, she brought
[9:00] forth her firstborn son and wrapped him
[9:03] in swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[9:05] manger because there was no room for
[9:07] them in the end. He is born naked at
[9:10] birth. What was he at his death? Naked,
[9:11] hanging upon the cross. He was born in a
[9:14] manger. That manger, they believe
[9:16] historically is heun out of the sight of
[9:18] a cave. He was born in the sight of a
[9:20] cave. Where was he buried? Buried in a
[9:22] cave.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham states in the sermon,
[9:25] who is Jesus? He said, "He came the most
[9:27] humblest birth that could ever be born
[9:29] of a peasant mother. Not even a place to
[9:31] lay to down to give birth to this baby.
[9:34] And his swaddling cloth, we're told, was
[9:36] off the yolk of an ox. They wrapped him
[9:37] in in the manger in a stinking stable
[9:40] over the wastegate in the stable. And
[9:41] the stable's not even a correct stable,
[9:43] a little cave in the side of the hill."
[9:46] So, here he is at his at his birth. He's
[9:49] in a huned out uh cave on a hill which
[9:53] they believe the place that Christ was
[9:55] buried was on that hill of Mount
[9:57] Calvary. Buried at a cave in the same
[9:58] place in Mark chapter 15 verses 45 and
[10:02] 46. And when he knew it and when he knew
[10:04] it of the centurion he gave the body of
[10:06] Joseph and we see um we're jumping in
[10:08] here. Joseph of Arythea wants to bury
[10:10] Jesus. And he bought fine linen and took
[10:13] him down and wrapped him in the linen
[10:15] and laid him in a sepllic which was
[10:17] heuned out of a rock and rolled a stone
[10:19] unto the door of the suppler.
[10:21] This is at his birth he comes forth
[10:24] naked and he's wrapped and placed in a
[10:26] manger born there in a a cave in the
[10:28] side of a hill. At his death he's taken
[10:30] down from the cross. He's wrapped up and
[10:32] he's put into a cave a hollowedout grave
[10:34] in the side of a hill. And in that image
[10:37] that we shared a moment ago,
[10:40] you see Christ at his birth, Mary holds
[10:42] him at the foot of a cradle,
[10:45] at his birth. But then here it's
[10:47] represented again held by Mary at the
[10:49] foot of the cross.
[10:51] And that image that we say, well, this
[10:52] is this imagery uh we put we put these
[10:55] things together when we begin to look at
[10:57] his life. We're not even telling the
[10:58] story of the in between. He's born and
[11:00] you see all this foreshadowing of his
[11:03] death. his birth was marching to death.
[11:08] And I know that we could say this of any
[11:10] human being that they're born and maybe
[11:11] when they're born they're swaddled and
[11:13] then when they're died when they die
[11:15] maybe there was a certain preparation
[11:16] that all men went through at that time
[11:18] and say well these these similarities
[11:19] this is what this is what they did to
[11:21] man this isn't distinguishing. So I'd
[11:23] say despite these similarities in the
[11:26] life, the birth and death of Christ,
[11:28] Christ's birth was in fact heavenly.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; That his birth was unlike any other
[11:33] birth, it was a very royal birth. Even
[11:35] though it was in a manger in a in a
[11:37] wastegate and a hewed out cave and you
[11:40] think, well, maybe this should have been
[11:42] in heaven or should have been in a
[11:43] palace and should have been a much
[11:44] better setting, his birth was still
[11:47] different than any other birth before.
[11:49] In Luke 2:8 versus to 14 and there were
[11:53] in the same country shepherds abiding in
[11:55] the field keeping watch over the flock
[11:57] by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord
[12:00] came upon them and the glory of the Lord
[12:02] shone round about them. This would have
[12:04] been a very supernatural happening.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; The shepherds just aren't watching their
[12:10] sheep and someone says, you know, I'm
[12:11] just getting this little inkling. I'm
[12:13] I'm getting it from the ether or this
[12:15] this lamb is talking to me. Tell them we
[12:17] should go down into Bethlehem. There's
[12:19] something very supernatural with this
[12:21] light is shining around. This glory
[12:23] fills their where they are. And the
[12:24] angel said unto them, "Fear not, for
[12:27] behold, I bring you good tidings of
[12:29] great joy."
[12:31] &gt;&gt; This these good tidings of great joy to
[12:34] the shepherds. Now, I'm not sure if many
[12:37] of you can relate to this. Uh we
[12:39] recently had some friends of ours uh let
[12:41] us know that they were expecting a baby,
[12:43] and I was super excited and and really
[12:46] really happy. And some of our kids got
[12:47] really, really excited about it. And I
[12:49] could remember when I was like them, how
[12:52] excited I was when I heard my friends
[12:54] were having babies. And I'd be like,
[12:56] "Congratulations. It's so awesome. I'm
[12:58] so excited for you." And then when I had
[13:00] a baby, I felt like I had to kind of go
[13:02] back and tell all my friends. I didn't
[13:03] even know what I was saying. I'd like to
[13:05] say congratulations all over again with
[13:07] some real feeling and knowing what it
[13:10] means. And so there was this uh when he
[13:13] says these great tidings of great joy.
[13:15] It's not this announcement of a birth
[13:17] where we just know well that must be a
[13:19] nice thing. Congrat Well, good for them,
[13:21] right? Whoever it is that's having this
[13:23] baby. But it's good tidings of great joy
[13:25] to them. The shepherds could identify in
[13:27] this something that they could believe
[13:28] WHICH SHALL BE TO ALL PEOPLE. For unto
[13:31] you is born this day. Now catch this
[13:34] image in the city of David. What does
[13:37] this do? It it connects you with the
[13:39] throne,
[13:40] a savior which is Christ the Lord. So
[13:42] now you have uh the the Messiah
[13:46] coming forth in the city of David, a
[13:48] savior, and this shall be a sign unto
[13:50] you. You shall find a babe wrapped in
[13:52] swaddling clothes lying in a manger. And
[13:54] when at this announcement and suddenly
[13:56] there was with the angel a multitude of
[13:59] the heavenly host praising God.
[14:02] This there's a Christmas song I really
[14:04] like. It says, "And the angels filled
[14:06] the sky." And we think, "Hark the herald
[14:09] angel sings, glory to the newborn king."
[14:12] And you just imagine that all of heaven
[14:14] was illuminated.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; That this would have been this brilliant
[14:18] radiating event. The multitude of the
[14:20] heavenly host praising God, SAYING,
[14:21] "GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND ON
[14:23] earth peace, goodwill toward men." This
[14:27] is a heavenly birth.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; This is this is moving. This is
[14:32] remarkable. This is different. Now I
[14:34] know you might have some stories about
[14:35] your birth a and everyone might have
[14:38] been impressed. You might have got a
[14:40] perfect apgar whatever that is and you
[14:42] might have just you might have weighed
[14:43] seven pounds and 77 ounces or.77. It
[14:47] just everything might have been perfect.
[14:48] You're born at I was going to say 7773
[14:52] on the third day of the third month in
[14:54] the third year and everything may just
[14:56] be numerically perfect. I'm telling you
[14:58] I'm I'm I'm the a perfect child. But
[15:02] never has there been a birth
[15:04] &gt;&gt; from heaven like this.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus, the Bible tells us, is born of
[15:09] the seed of David, the house of David.
[15:12] He's a Messiah, king
[15:14] &gt;&gt; to the house of Israel.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; Revelations 22:1 16. I, Jesus, has sent
[15:19] mine angel to testify unto you these
[15:21] things in the churches. I am the root
[15:24] and the offspring of David and the
[15:26] bright and morning star. Amen.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; Notice how it's this illumination, this
[15:31] brightness, this shining forth. I am the
[15:33] root and offspring of David. When he
[15:34] says that, key in on this, that makes it
[15:37] very narrow, very particular. He's the
[15:39] root and the offspring of David.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 15 24, but he answered and
[15:45] said, "I am not sent but under the lost
[15:48] sheep of the house of Israel." That that
[15:50] uh uh Greek woman that uh or the the
[15:53] [clears throat] gentile woman who's
[15:54] coming for healing. And he says, "Oh,
[15:57] uh, you know, this is I'm not sent to
[16:00] you."
[16:03] He was sent to the lost sheep of the
[16:06] house of Israel. He was of the root and
[16:07] offspring of David. Behold, in the city
[16:09] of David is born the Messiah.
[16:12] So, the first the first Christmas is
[16:15] connected with heaven and this royal
[16:18] throne even on earth. And at the
[16:21] announcement of his birth, the the the
[16:23] night sky was illuminated. The Bible is
[16:25] expressing this. This is the image I
[16:27] see. This bright morning star would have
[16:29] been announced with a heavenly host
[16:32] and even the timing of his birth.
[16:34] There's this connection with his his
[16:36] coming forth as a light in darkness.
[16:40] As we sing and as it was sung Wednesday
[16:42] night by the Randos, it was oh night
[16:44] divine. It's that night time when he
[16:47] Christ was born. The shepherds were out
[16:48] by night watching their sheep. These
[16:50] angels appear and the heavens are
[16:52] illuminated. There's this stark contrast
[16:55] to the nighttime, to this rising of a
[16:57] sun, the birth of a sun.
[17:00] Oh, night divine.
[17:03] When the light of the world was laid in
[17:04] a stable.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; When the announcement was, "Behold your
[17:08] king. Where is he? IS HE RIDING ON A
[17:10] WHITE HORSE? IS HE IN THE PALACE
[17:11] SOMEWHERE?" NO, HE'S LAYING IN A MANGER.
[17:14] BEHOLD YOUR MESSIAH. WHERE IS HE? HE'S
[17:16] WRAPPED IN swaddling clothes.
[17:18] That his birth though he shares that in
[17:21] common with men. This is a royal birth.
[17:23] This is a heavenly birth. This is a He's
[17:25] on a mission to the house of Israel.
[17:28] And where I'd like to cause you to begin
[17:31] to be more reflective about Christmas is
[17:33] the birth of Christmas points to
[17:35] Calvary.
[17:37] A death that would give salvation, that
[17:40] would bring redemption. As the Bible
[17:41] says, she shall bring forth a son.
[17:42] That's birth. And he shall save his
[17:44] people. That's death.
[17:47] John 1 29. The next day John seeth Jesus
[17:51] coming unto him and saith, Behold the
[17:53] lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
[17:55] the world.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; He was born in a stable just as the
[17:59] lambs would be. He was visited by
[18:02] shepherds at his birth. You see the
[18:04] image? There's a reason why these things
[18:06] happen and you say, "Oh, well this is
[18:07] just poetry. This is just an allegory."
[18:09] No, these are real events. I believe my
[18:12] Bible's the truth. Amen.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; And anymore the more you believe in the
[18:16] in the truth of the Bible, the more rare
[18:18] of a Christian you become because most
[18:20] theology now Christian theology is,
[18:22] well, we we must just look at it as an
[18:24] allegory of living. And well, you can't
[18:27] take all this for fact because this was
[18:29] added in here and this was added in
[18:30] there. And really, it becomes a clever
[18:32] way to be able to tell you what you need
[18:34] to believe.
[18:35] But I believe it's not wrong to tell you
[18:37] as a Christian that God has a way of
[18:38] preserving a word in your language in
[18:40] whatever language it may be preserved in
[18:42] a letter that can reveal to you Jesus
[18:44] Christ.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; And he said that behold the lamb of God
[18:49] who takes away the sins of the world.
[18:51] You see that that's the very image that
[18:53] was portrayed at his birth. And as a
[18:55] lamb that takes away sins by John's own
[18:58] confession,
[19:00] he's pointing to a sacrifice.
[19:03] When Jesus stood before Pilate in John
[19:05] 18:37,
[19:07] he's asked, "Art thou a king?" Then
[19:11] well, we know he was he came as a king.
[19:15] As the sisters saying, "How many kings
[19:18] would lay down their throne, lay down
[19:20] their royal garments?" He came as a
[19:22] king. Jesus answered, "Thou sayest that
[19:24] I am a king." He says, "To this end was
[19:26] I born." Now, I know as he begins to
[19:28] describe this, we can see that it points
[19:31] to what he says next. But if you look at
[19:33] this image as as he is facing death and
[19:36] he's being arrested and he's being tried
[19:38] and and he knows death is certain, he's
[19:40] saying to this end was I born. The the
[19:43] song sung today, ring the bells. Born to
[19:46] die that man might live. Born to die on
[19:49] Calvary. What does that tell us? He was
[19:51] born for the purpose of dying. Right?
[19:54] &gt;&gt; WE COULD SAY THAT EVERY MAN is appointed
[19:56] to death and and every man who's born of
[19:58] a woman eventually is going to die. But
[20:00] you're not born to die.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; You're not born for the express purpose
[20:04] of finding a grave.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; You're not. You're born with another
[20:08] purpose. BUT JESUS IS THE ONLY one we
[20:11] can SAY WAS BORN TO DIE.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; That that was he says to this end was I
[20:17] born and for this cause came I into the
[20:19] world that I should bear witness under
[20:20] the truth. Everyone that is of the truth
[20:22] heareth my voice. He was born with this
[20:27] mission with this commission with this
[20:29] purpose. A baby born to die. How how
[20:33] remarkable that is.
[20:36] So as Jesus was born on that day he was
[20:39] born the the heavens were illuminated.
[20:40] But now notice his death in Luke chapter
[20:42] 23:es
[20:44] 44 to 46. said it was about the sixth
[20:46] hour and there was a darkness over all
[20:49] the earth until the 9th hour and the sun
[20:52] was darkened.
[20:54] Says in the veil of the temple was rent
[20:56] in the midst
[20:59] and Jesus had cried with a loud voice.
[21:01] He said father into thy hands I commend
[21:03] my spirit and having said thus he gave
[21:06] up the ghost. You read it in other
[21:08] places in terms of the darkness covering
[21:11] the earth. Darkness over all the earth
[21:14] until the ninth hour. And it says the
[21:16] sun was darkened.
[21:18] Think of this contrast.
[21:20] On the night of his birth, the heavens
[21:22] are illuminated.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; On the night of his birth, uh uh there's
[21:26] a you could say it's day that the the
[21:28] sun is being born
[21:31] a
[21:31] &gt;&gt; and the and the the IMAGE IS WELL, IT'S
[21:33] NIGHT TIME. and the sun is down, BUT NOW
[21:35] THE SUN IS COMING FORTH, BORN OF A
[21:36] WOMAN, and the heavens are illuminated.
[21:38] The light of the world has come. Maybe
[21:40] there's there maybe there is a star
[21:41] SHINING IN THE SKY THAT OTHERS CAN'T
[21:43] DISCERN AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IT stands
[21:45] for. BUT NOW WHEN HE DIES, THE OPPOSITE
[21:47] HAPPENS. It's midnight in the middle of
[21:49] the day.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; The whole earth is covered in darkness.
[21:52] AS THE AS THE SON OF GOD GIVES UP THE
[21:54] GHOST, THE LIGHT REFUS THE SUN REFUSES
[21:56] TO shine
[21:58] &gt;&gt; kind of as this antithesis to his birth.
[22:00] But why? Because as he was born at night
[22:02] and the light shone, now when he dies in
[22:05] the day, the sun refuses to shine.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to express it this way. The
[22:11] first Christmas led to his death.
[22:15] WITHOUT WITHOUT his death, there would
[22:17] be no Christmas. There would be no glory
[22:19] in Christmas.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; You realize without this death upon the
[22:23] cross, we wouldn't be celebrating his
[22:25] birth. Right?
[22:27] &gt;&gt; It would would not even be a day on the
[22:28] calendar because Christmas is crowned
[22:31] with the glory of the cross.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; One uh old writer wrote one time, he
[22:36] said uh Christmas has a a glory. It has
[22:39] an honor, but it's borrowed from the
[22:41] cross.
[22:43] Brother Bradom makes this statement and
[22:45] serves as we would see Jesus. And I'm
[22:47] going to have to uh I accidentally just
[22:49] put this in low power mode. We're not
[22:51] charging this thing enough. But I'm
[22:53] going to skip to to this here. And sir,
[22:56] as we would see Jesus, he says, "We take
[22:58] the word Christmas."
[23:00] He says, "It's very seldom you ever hear
[23:02] Christ's name mentioned. You don't hear
[23:04] it mentioned. The lights and the tinsils
[23:07] all on Santa Claus, not on Christ.
[23:09] People hardly know what Christmas is
[23:11] really for. They've just paganized it
[23:13] and paganized it till it's become pagan.
[23:15] It's a great commercial day of
[23:17] celebration." So the celebration of
[23:20] Christ became paganized.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; We find the early church um that that
[23:25] there was some begin to they begin to
[23:27] honor and recognize that day but then it
[23:30] be paganiz and paganiz and mixed with
[23:31] these other traditions. He said I seen a
[23:34] sign not long ago SAID PUT CHRIST BACK
[23:35] in Christmas. Now they bring you to a
[23:38] church. You learn a creed. Then you then
[23:42] they bring you to a Christmas and what
[23:44] do they do? You see a Santa Claus. They
[23:47] bring you to a church, you see an
[23:49] organization, but Christ, I WANT YOU TO
[23:51] CATCH THIS. Christ brought them to the
[23:53] cross. And when you get a real disciple
[23:56] that'll point you to Christ, Christ will
[23:58] bring you to the cross where you are
[23:59] crucified with him
[24:01] &gt;&gt; and his eternal life and your life meet
[24:03] together and your life dies and you take
[24:04] on his eternal life and then you're a
[24:06] son of God. What a difference from a
[24:08] disciple of old and the disciples of
[24:09] today.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; On Christmas day, maybe they've TAKEN
[24:13] CHRIST OUT OF IT. And and I it it is
[24:16] interesting when some people say, "Well,
[24:18] I just say happy holidays." Well, that's
[24:20] a a holy day. It's all the same, right?
[24:24] We don't find Christ mass in in the
[24:26] scripture. And so, whatever it might be,
[24:29] at one time, MAYBE WE HAD CHRIST WAS THE
[24:31] FOCAL point of Christmas, then it
[24:33] becomes Exmas, and then it just becomes
[24:35] happy holidays, and it's further
[24:36] removed. BUT NOTICE HOW THAT if there's
[24:38] AN ATTEMPT TO PUT CHRIST BACK INTO
[24:40] CHRISTMAS, THEY PUT HIM IN A MANGER.
[24:43] And so they point you to these the
[24:45] images of his birth. But he says that
[24:48] Christ points you to the cross.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; And so we honor Christmas day because
[24:54] it's a prelude to that day on Calvary.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; It's a special day to us because it's
[25:01] connected with it's a special night, the
[25:03] night of his birth. It's a special night
[25:05] because it points to that day he died.
[25:09] If I could say this, the c the cradle
[25:12] points to the cross.
[25:15] That cave that he was born in points to
[25:17] that grave.
[25:19] And I'd like to take it a step further
[25:24] because there is a a second Noel.
[25:27] There's another Christmas day, if I
[25:29] could phrase it that way. Not one
[25:31] leading to an inevitable death, but to
[25:34] eternal life. Because Christ doesn't
[25:36] point you to the the uh the the cradle.
[25:40] He points you to the cross.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; And that cross purchases redemption.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; So the cross is not an ending point.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; It pays the price.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE POINTS YOU TO THE CROSS, NOW
[25:52] IF HE POINTED YOU TO a a a crib, then
[25:55] you know death is certain. But he
[25:57] doesn't point YOU TO THE CRIB. HE POINTS
[25:59] YOU TO THE CROSS KNOWING THAT DEATH HAS
[26:01] BEEN DEALT WITH.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[26:05] In Romans 1:es 1:5 and Paul A SERVANT OF
[26:09] JESUS CHRIST CALLED TO BE AN APOSTLE
[26:11] SEPARATE UNDER the gospel of God which
[26:13] he had promised to be for by his
[26:15] prophets in the holy scriptures
[26:17] concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord
[26:20] &gt;&gt; which was made of the seed of David
[26:22] according to the flesh
[26:24] &gt;&gt; and declared to be the son of God with
[26:26] power according to the spirit of
[26:28] holiness by the resurrection from the
[26:30] dead.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Now catch these two different facets
[26:33] here. the seed of David after the flesh.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; That's the first Christmas.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE FIRST NOEL BORN IS the king
[26:40] of Israel.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; But now he says then declared to be the
[26:44] son of God BY THE RESURRECTION FROM THE
[26:47] DEAD.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; YES.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; He was the seed of DAVID BY HIS FIRST
[26:50] BIRTH BY BEING BORN. BUT NOW HE SAYS BY
[26:53] THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD. HE'S
[26:54] DECLARED TO BE THIS ROYAL SON OF GOD.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; A seed of David after the flesh. That's
[26:59] the first Christmas. but declared to be
[27:01] the son of God by his resurrection from
[27:03] the dead. This is another rising of the
[27:05] sun
[27:07] &gt;&gt; in Acts 13 32-37.
[27:11] Notice this. And we declare unto you
[27:12] glad tidings. This is the gospel being
[27:14] preached. They brought good tidings of
[27:17] great joy at his first birth. Now
[27:19] there's a glad tidings. How that the
[27:21] promise which was made unto the fathers,
[27:23] God hath fulfilled the same unto us
[27:25] their children in that he raised up
[27:28] Jesus again. Notice the the glad tidings
[27:32] are not the birth but the resurrection.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; As it is also written in the second
[27:36] psalm, thou art my son. This day I have
[27:39] begotten thee. Now notice this.
[27:43] He raised up Jesus again as it is
[27:46] written in the second psalm. Thou art my
[27:48] son. This day have I begotten thee.
[27:51] Isn't that an interesting connection?
[27:53] It's the raising up of Jesus. Again,
[27:56] there's this declaration. This day have
[27:58] I brought you forth. And as concerning
[28:00] that he raised him up from the dead.
[28:01] Notice that's the theme he's on. He's
[28:03] not talking about the birth. He's
[28:05] talking about the resurrection. He
[28:06] raised him up from the dead. Now, no
[28:09] more to return to corruption. All right.
[28:11] Now, things are getting different.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; We can look to the resurrections of the
[28:15] Old Testament that men were raised from
[28:17] the dead, but not to incorruption.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; They would eventually have to die again.
[28:22] But now, this is different. Right. Amen.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; He said on this wise, I will give you
[28:27] the sure mercies of David. Wherefore he
[28:29] saith also in another psalm, thou shalt
[28:31] not suffer thine holy one to see
[28:32] corruption. For David after he served
[28:34] his own generation by the will of God,
[28:36] fell on sleep.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; I like that. It kind of has a on sleep.
[28:40] He fell on sleep and was laid unto his
[28:43] fathers and saw corruption. But he whom
[28:46] God raised again saw no corruption.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; This isn't a resurrection TO ULTIMATE
[28:53] DEATH AGAIN. THIS is a different one. I
[28:55] bring you glad tidings that Jesus has
[28:57] been raised AGAIN AS IT WAS PROPHESIED.
[28:59] THIS DAY HAVE I BEGOTTEN THEE. I'VE
[29:01] RAISED HIM UP FROM THE DEAD to no more
[29:03] see corruption. He was made the seed of
[29:06] David ACCORDING TO THE FLESH. HE DIED
[29:08] THE DEATH of even that David had died in
[29:10] the flesh, BUT HE'S DECLARED TO BE THE
[29:12] SON OF GOD ACCORDING TO THE RESURRECTION
[29:14] from the dead.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; To never die again or see corruption.
[29:22] Recognize these scriptures. I know
[29:23] you're probably already piecing them
[29:24] together. Revelations 1:5 and from Jesus
[29:27] Christ who's the faithful witness and
[29:29] the first begotten of the dead.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; This is a different this is a different
[29:36] connection. And the prince of the kings
[29:37] of the earth. This is a different kind
[29:40] of language. Unto him that loved us and
[29:41] washed us from our sins in his own
[29:43] blood. This is a another rising.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; You have one that comes from David
[29:50] from this. Oh, thank you. I can preach
[29:52] all day now.
[30:00] One from the house of David. He was
[30:03] begotten of the house of David. Born in
[30:05] Bethlehem. But now catch this. Now he's
[30:08] born. Says here, the first begotten of
[30:11] the dead.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; One from the house of David. This one
[30:15] from death.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; I know maybe you got your thinking caps
[30:20] on. You're chewing on it. As we used to
[30:22] say in the beginning, ponder that. And
[30:25] then I found out the young people were
[30:26] counting it and I ruined it for them.
[30:29] And you said ponder five times today.
[30:31] Then I stopped saying it,
[30:34] but it kept them awake for a while.
[30:38] They uh they fell on sleep eventually
[30:43] in Colossians chapter 1 18. And he is
[30:45] the head of the body, the church, which
[30:47] is the beginning, the first born from
[30:49] the dead. Amen.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; That in all things he might have the
[30:52] preeminence.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; So he's the first begotten of the dead.
[30:56] He is declared to be the son of God
[30:58] being raised from the dead. Thou art my
[31:01] son. This day have BEGOTTEN YOU WHEN HE
[31:03] RAISED UP Jesus again. He This is the
[31:06] language now being used of Christ, the
[31:08] firstborn from the dead.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 15 20. BUT NOW IS
[31:14] CHRIST RISEN FROM THE DEAD and become
[31:18] the first fruits of them that slept.
[31:21] This is this is to me this IS BEAUTIFUL.
[31:24] HE'S BORN OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL. So
[31:27] therefore THERE'S THIS CONNECTION THAT
[31:29] ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WOULD HAVE TO
[31:31] THE MESSIAH THAT WHEN ABRAHAM WAS
[31:33] PROMISED A SON AND THIS WAS THE SON FROM
[31:36] THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THAT ALL JEWS HAD
[31:38] AWAITED FOR. IF YOU WERE OF THE HOUSE OF
[31:40] DAVID, IF YOU WERE OF THE SEED OF
[31:42] ISRAEL, THIS WAS THE LONG- AWAITED
[31:43] PROMISED SON.
[31:46] But now, when he's born from the dead,
[31:49] he comes from the house of all living.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; CUZ NOT EVERYBODY WAS A JEW.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT GENTILE WOMAN CAME TO HIM, HE
[31:58] SAYS, "I'M ONLY SENT TO THE LOST SHEEP
[31:59] OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL." THAT'S IN HIS
[32:01] FIRST CHRISTMAS. BUT NOW WHEN HE'S BORN
[32:04] AGAIN FROM THE DEAD,
[32:06] &gt;&gt; ALL HUMANITY DID NOT HAVE PLACE IN THE
[32:08] HOUSE OF DAVID. ALL HUMANITY DID NOT
[32:10] HAVE A PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL, BUT
[32:12] ALL HAVE AN APPOINTMENT IN THE HOUSE OF
[32:14] DEATH.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; And in Romans 5:12,
[32:24] wherefore as by one man sin entered into
[32:26] the world, and death by sin, and so
[32:28] death passed upon all men, for that all
[32:31] have sinned.
[32:33] That's why we all have sinned and
[32:35] therefore death is certain because of
[32:37] sin
[32:39] &gt;&gt; and Jesus sealed his death when he took
[32:41] upon himself our sins. Yes.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; So in that way we could say that HE
[32:46] PORTRAYED THIS SIDE OF HUMANITY. HE BORE
[32:48] OUR SINS. THOUGH HAVING NOT committed
[32:50] sin, HE BECAME SINFUL.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; HE BECAME SIN.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; And in becoming sin, he he died in
[32:59] ourstead.
[33:00] But this death that passed upon all men
[33:02] comes because we've sinned.
[33:05] The first Noel was from Bethlehem.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; The second Noel is from the grave.
[33:13] The first Christmas connects him with
[33:15] Israel.
[33:16] The second Christmas, if I could use
[33:18] that language and just bear with me in
[33:20] that, the second Christmas connects him
[33:22] to you.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; In Mark 16:6
[33:29] when he on his resurrection day,
[33:34] the angel is there at his tomb.
[33:38] remember in his in his when he's born in
[33:40] that cave on the side of the hill
[33:42] there's an an angel of the Lord that
[33:44] says go to that place and there you'll
[33:46] find him wrapped in swaddling clothes
[33:50] but now on this day says be not afraid
[33:53] ye seek Jesus of Nazareth came early in
[33:55] the morning which was crucified he is
[33:57] risen he's not here
[34:00] &gt;&gt; little bit of a twist YOU'RE NOT GOING
[34:01] TO FIND HIM WRAPPED IN in linens not
[34:03] going to find him wrapped in GRAVE GRAVE
[34:05] CLOTHES THE SHEPHERDS FOUND HIM A
[34:07] HELPLESS LESS BABY IN THE SIDE OF A HILL
[34:09] LAYING IN A MANGER. BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING
[34:11] TO FIND THE MESSIAH IN A IN A GRAVE
[34:13] WRAPPED IN GRAVE CLOTHES. Behold the
[34:16] place where they laid him. IT'S NOW NOT
[34:18] JUST AN EMPTY CRADLE, BUT AN EMPTY
[34:20] GRAVE.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; And there is the second Noel. Risen is
[34:26] the king.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8 29. Why does this
[34:30] happen? for whom he did forno, he also
[34:32] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[34:34] image of his son that he might be the
[34:36] firstborn among many brethren.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; There is an affinity
[34:43] that we all have as human beings being
[34:45] born of a woman. Despite all sorts of
[34:48] technological advancements in science a
[34:50] and crisper and gene editing and all
[34:53] sorts of ways that we can conceive and
[34:55] become more fertile, you're still born
[34:56] through the same process
[34:58] of a male and female part. the parts be
[35:01] combined, the germ and the seed be
[35:02] combined in some sort of incubation
[35:04] period and then a birth coming forth
[35:06] from a woman's womb
[35:09] &gt;&gt; and then that man born of a woman.
[35:11] Science hasn't figured out how to make
[35:12] you live forever.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; There still is a death that comes to all
[35:16] men
[35:18] &gt;&gt; and he shares that.
[35:21] But we cannot share naturally with the
[35:26] way that he was born first,
[35:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[35:29] &gt;&gt; By conception. supernatural.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; The woman is not even a part of it.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, a lot of in the
[35:36] church, some of the the Catholic church
[35:38] begin to object to the the portrayal of
[35:41] the Christ coming from heaven uh uh and
[35:44] the images and art because it didn't
[35:46] depict Mary as being virgin born and it
[35:49] didn't it didn't depict her as being the
[35:51] actual mother of Jesus. That the
[35:53] humanity of Jesus came from Mary and
[35:55] that's a Catholic doctrine. Right?
[35:57] &gt;&gt; And so they actually begin to try to
[35:59] scrub that out of the the art books and
[36:01] art history and the portrayals because
[36:02] they wanted the woman to have SOME PART
[36:04] IN THAT. BUT LISTEN, CHRIST WAS BORN OF
[36:06] GOD. The blood that was in him was
[36:08] divine. It was deity.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; IF HE WAS ALL MAN, IT WAS BY GOD'S
[36:12] CREATION. THE FIRST THE the beginning of
[36:15] THE CREATION OF GOD, THE WORD MADE
[36:17] FLESH.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; He shares that with us or he does not we
[36:23] do not share that with him. BUT WE CAN
[36:25] say through the new birth our soul does.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Through the new birth THAT THAT'S OUR
[36:30] THAT'S OUR BIRTHING FORTH TO LIFE. BUT
[36:32] THEN NOTICE HOW HE'S RAISED from death.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; This is this IS WHAT MAN MAN MUST FACE
[36:39] THIS DEATH. AND WHEN HE'S RAISED FROM
[36:41] THE DEAD, HE BECOMES THE FIRSTBORN AMONG
[36:43] MANY BRETHREN.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; NOT THAT IT'LL COME FORTH FROM A WOMAN
[36:46] UH VIRGIN BORN, BUT THAT THERE WOULD BE
[36:48] NOT ONLY JUST EVEN A NEW LIFE INSIDE OF
[36:50] YOU, BUT DEATH IS DEAD. AMEN.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; In first Corinthian, excuse me, 1 Peter
[36:56] chapter 1:3,
[36:58] blessed be the God and father of our
[37:00] Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
[37:02] HIS ABUNDANT MERCY HATH BEGOTTEN US
[37:04] AGAIN
[37:05] &gt;&gt; unto a lively hope by the resurrection
[37:07] of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; How beautiful this is that even our new
[37:12] birth gives us a living hope by the
[37:15] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[37:18] dead.
[37:20] Not the birth of Jesus in a manger and
[37:22] not even his death upon the cross, which
[37:25] is integral. It's part of it. I'm not
[37:27] trying to separate it out. But that day
[37:30] it became midnight in the middle of the
[37:32] day. The sun refused to shine.
[37:36] Refused to shine.
[37:39] And we could say perhaps that Friday and
[37:42] that Saturday were the darkest days ever
[37:43] on earth.
[37:46] But on that resurrection morning when
[37:48] that son rose, the tomb was empty
[37:50] &gt;&gt; and he became the first begotten from
[37:53] the dead.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; The first fruits of them that slept.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; If if if he was born of a virgin, we we
[38:02] can't even aspire to that.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; If he died a HORRIFIC DEATH UPON THE
[38:07] CROSS, we could mimic that.
[38:10] BUT NOW THAT HE'S raised again from the
[38:13] grave, we have something to look to as
[38:16] OUR MODEL.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE SOMETHING to celebrate this
[38:20] resurrection. HE'S BEGOTTEN US AGAIN BY
[38:22] THE NEW BIRTH. HAD HE NOT RESURRECTED,
[38:24] THEN HE COULD NOT WE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
[38:26] BORN AGAIN.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; So if I could say we do not share in the
[38:30] first Christmas by our natural birth,
[38:33] again, not of the house of Israel. We're
[38:35] not sinless. We're not born of a virgin.
[38:38] But we do have an identification in the
[38:40] second Noel.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; We do have a representation in the
[38:44] second Christmas
[38:46] as it is said in Johnap 11:es 25- 26.
[38:50] This is at a time of the resurrection of
[38:52] Lazarus.
[38:54] His sisters were weeping and crying and
[38:56] one said, "Oh Lord, had you been here,
[38:58] he would not have died." He says, "Do
[39:00] you believe he can live again?" She
[39:01] says, "I know one day in the
[39:03] resurrection, he'll live again." But
[39:05] then he wanted her to look at him
[39:06] differently.
[39:08] He said, "I am the resurrection and the
[39:10] life."
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Quite a statement because here he here
[39:16] he stands living having never died.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[39:20] &gt;&gt; But he says, "I am the resurrection and
[39:22] the life."
[39:23] &gt;&gt; And and he doesn't say the life and the
[39:25] resurrection.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; It's I I'm living now. It's appointed
[39:29] all men once to die, but I'm a baby born
[39:30] to die. I'm a man that's destined to
[39:32] die. To this end came I into the world.
[39:34] Behold the lamb of God who's going to
[39:35] shed his blood for the sinner. BUT SO
[39:37] BUT I'M THAT'S NOT JUST WHAT DEFINES ME.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; One of the most outstanding
[39:42] characteristics I believe of Jesus
[39:44] CHRIST THAT REALLY STUMBLES people today
[39:46] because well we just want Jesus. We just
[39:48] want Jesus. And really what they want to
[39:49] do is they just want to sit at the foot
[39:51] of the cross and worship a Jesus who's
[39:52] still crucified
[39:54] &gt;&gt; or they want to sit at the foot of a
[39:55] major and worship a Jesus that's still
[39:56] wrapped in swaddling clothes. They want
[39:58] the red letter of the gospels. They want
[40:00] Jesus. But Jesus Christ
[40:02] &gt;&gt; is the word the living word of God that
[40:05] makes God present.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; See a little Christmas tie in there. He
[40:09] makes God present.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; It's God's presence. That's what
[40:13] Christmas means. That's what it
[40:15] represents. That if there's if there's
[40:17] going to BE ANOTHER CHRISTMAS, IT'S
[40:19] DECLARING THE PRESENCE OF GOD.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; AT THE SECOND NOEL, IT'S NOT WELL, HE'S
[40:23] DEAD AND HE'S NOT HERE AND HIS SOUL IS
[40:24] IN HELL OR HIS SPIRIT'S BACK IN HEAVEN,
[40:26] BUT HE'S ALIVE. HE LIVETH EVER MORE.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And Jesus Christ, he said, "Before
[40:35] Abraham was, I am."
[40:38] &gt;&gt; And who was it he met? It wasn't that
[40:39] Jesus of Nazareth. Paul said, "Have I
[40:42] not met Jesus Christ, our Lord?" That
[40:44] that's not the one that's not the one
[40:46] that was in the grave or the one that
[40:48] walked the the earth. Paul wasn't there
[40:49] to meet him. This is after his
[40:50] resurrection. He says, "I'm the
[40:52] resurrection and the life." This is
[40:54] something new.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "He that believeth in me,
[40:57] though he were dead,
[40:59] &gt;&gt; yet shall he live." Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; There's that uh uh the new birth and you
[41:06] he says you've passed from death unto
[41:08] life.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; And then this statement becomes the door
[41:12] into which we see Paul teaching we shall
[41:15] not all fall on sleep.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; We shall be changed. He said whosoever
[41:19] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[41:21] die.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; He says believeth thou this?
[41:26] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[41:29] modern Christian uh Christmas
[41:31] celebrations have
[41:34] largely abandoned honoring Christ's
[41:36] birth just in the modern sense and maybe
[41:38] it's more inclusive they want to include
[41:40] everyone in on it and so there's all
[41:43] sorts of different ideas of Christ
[41:44] figures or messiahs or celebrations but
[41:47] if we could say in a in a worldly sense
[41:49] it's a secular holiday
[41:51] everyone's celebrating Christmas
[41:54] uh and it's gone so far now to where
[41:56] Christmas being secular and pagan and
[41:59] commercialized. Now it's artificial
[42:01] polar bears and Coca-Cola trucks, right?
[42:05] And these are the images.
[42:07] The Norman Rockwell Christmas,
[42:10] the the the the man who invented
[42:12] Christmas as it's been said about
[42:14] Charles Dickens has created this this
[42:15] image. Even a lot of our modern
[42:17] Christian Christmas celebrations are
[42:19] exactly that modern. They've h they've
[42:20] transpired in the last 150 years.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; And [clears throat] and they are
[42:24] somewhat detached from
[42:28] Christ.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; The Christmas tree originally was used
[42:31] to honor Christ. It represented the tree
[42:33] of life.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Uh it wasn't used in a pagan sense, but
[42:37] now a Christian Christmas tree in a home
[42:39] is just a it's a Christmas tree in a
[42:40] home. That's all it is. Don't try to
[42:42] make it into anything more than that.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; And I'm not necessarily saying yes or no
[42:46] on that. And I think each person says
[42:47] celebrate Christmas as they feel led to.
[42:50] And but yet there's now that symbol at
[42:52] one time might have meant something to a
[42:54] Christian. Now it's completely stripped
[42:55] of any meaning in symbolism.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; And I would even say that most modern
[43:00] Christian Christmas celebrations when
[43:03] they try to bring Christ back into
[43:04] Christmas they point to a cradle.
[43:08] So is there something wrong with that?
[43:09] No. No. There's nothing wrong with that.
[43:12] Nothing wrong with pointing to a cradle.
[43:14] But if when you look at that cradle, it
[43:16] doesn't lead you to a cross.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; We've sanitized
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; We've made him less controversial. We've
[43:26] made him uh less repulsive. We we can
[43:30] embrace this innocent baby lying in a
[43:32] manger. We love the story. It carries
[43:34] some of the traditional narratives that
[43:35] make storytelling so compelling. Here he
[43:37] is. Uh this this move this government
[43:40] taxation or census has caused this young
[43:43] woman with child to travel over this
[43:45] land and terrain. It's at night. They
[43:47] can't find a place to stay. All the
[43:49] tension is building. There he is.
[43:51] They're in a stable and this baby COMES
[43:53] BEING BORN AND and the stillness that
[43:55] WOULD SEEM TO CATCH THAT MOMENT AND THE
[43:57] CRY OF THE BABY. OH, THAT THAT'S A
[43:59] THAT'S A CHRISTMAS MOVIE WE CAN WATCH.
[44:03] But if what that SCENE LEADS US TO IS
[44:06] this horrific DEATH UPON A CROSS, A
[44:08] LET'S JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE.
[44:11] LET'S JUST CELEBRATE CHRIST the baby.
[44:15] Let's not celebrate his uh uh his
[44:18] symbolic AND NECESSARY WASHING IN the
[44:21] Jordan. Let's not watch his life as HE
[44:23] BEGIN TO BE IDENTIFIED AND PREACH THE
[44:25] GOSPEL AND PREACH THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
[44:27] IS AT HAND. LET US NOT WATCH THIS GREAT
[44:29] LIGHT THAT BEGIN TO SPRING UP TO ALL
[44:31] THOSE that set in the regions of the
[44:32] lost and in darkness AND LO. LET'S NOT
[44:34] LOOK AT HIM AS HE STANDS BEFORE PILATE.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Let's not look at him as he's scourged
[44:39] and beaten.
[44:42] Let's not look at him as he hangs there
[44:43] upon the cross.
[44:46] But that's what the that's what the
[44:47] cradle points to.
[44:50] Brother Brandham in that same sermon
[44:52] paragraph 28 says GGreeks wanted to know
[44:54] it and serves as we would see Jesus and
[44:55] he gave them a way to know him to know
[44:57] him not to know his creed not to know
[45:00] his word not to know his miracles don't
[45:02] mean to step on toes but to know him
[45:06] and the only way you'll find that is at
[45:08] the cross not at the cradle
[45:11] &gt;&gt; it's the cross
[45:13] &gt;&gt; he pointed them to a cross not a creed
[45:16] not a manger or manner of denominations
[45:18] but to the crossmen
[45:20] Not one time did he in did did he point
[45:23] any person to any creed, any
[45:24] denomination or to his birth or even to
[45:28] Christmas. Not one time did he ever do
[45:31] it.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; What was he leading it to? He was
[45:34] leading it to a cross.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; We honor Christmas because the cross.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Wait, it it means something to us
[45:42] because of what it represents.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; The savior of the world. How did he
[45:47] become a savior? Not by being born, but
[45:48] by dying. Yes.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; How how did he be how did he redeem US
[45:53] FROM OUR SINS? NOT by being innocent but
[45:54] becoming guilty.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S REFLECTED IN THAT BORN IN A
[45:58] STABLE AS A LAMB VISITED BY SHEPHERDS as
[46:00] lamb. A newborn lamb would be he's
[46:02] speaking to us not so much OF THIS
[46:04] INNOCENCE OF BIRTH BUT A BABY BORN to
[46:06] die THAT HE MIGHT BE A CHILD GIVEN to
[46:09] redeem man from his sins. SHE SHALL
[46:12] BRING FORTH A son and he shall save his
[46:16] people from their sins.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me emphasize it this way.
[46:22] That's the end of the first Christmas.
[46:25] We're at another Christmas again.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; This is another Christmas.
[46:31] World groping in darkness. Christ bound
[46:34] by creeds and denominations and man's
[46:36] interpretation. THE WHOLE WORLD GOING
[46:38] INSANE. THIS WORLD IS FALLING APART.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S HARD TO FIND A A A VOICE
[46:43] ANYMORE THAT WOULD LIFT UP THE PURITY OF
[46:46] THE GOSPEL WITHOUT PRETENSE. AND
[46:48] POLITICS,
[46:49] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[46:50] &gt;&gt; And just AS CHRIST CAME ON THAT DARK
[46:52] NIGHT AS THE INNOCENT lamb of God to
[46:55] take away the SINS OF THE WORLD, WE'RE
[46:57] AT ANOTHER CHRISTMAS AGAIN. WHAT IS THAT
[46:58] CHRISTMAS? CHRIST is alive. DECLARED
[47:01] HIMSELF TO BE REAL.
[47:05] [clears throat]
[47:06] &gt;&gt; The Christmas isn't his death. It's the
[47:09] second Noel. His presence is amongst us.
[47:12] He's confirming his word. So the lost
[47:14] are being saved. THE SICK ARE BEING
[47:16] HEALED. THE WORD is being opened UP TO
[47:18] US. THAT'S THE PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST
[47:20] UNRECOGNIZED TODAY.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; If our musicians would come to their
[47:24] instruments
[47:26] this last statement from that sermon,
[47:28] sir, we would see Jesus beautiful
[47:30] Christmas message. He says, "My
[47:32] Christmas message is let me point you
[47:36] tonight to the cross." Now, now I
[47:38] realize that the Christmas message is
[47:40] pointing to a cross. And and you say,
[47:42] "Well, brother Aaron, you're saying
[47:43] there's a second Christmas." That's what
[47:45] the cross made a way for.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Without death, there cannot be life.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm the resurrection and the
[47:53] life." What does that speak to? NOT THE
[47:55] LIFE AND THE RESURRECTION,
[47:57] but the life that I now live. I live by
[47:59] the faith of the SON OF GOD WHO GAVE HIS
[48:01] LIFE FOR ME. So this is, as Paul said,
[48:04] newness of life, new creatures in Christ
[48:06] Jesus. So he is the first begotten of
[48:08] the dead, the first fruits of them that
[48:10] slept. That there is life EVEN AFTER
[48:12] DEATH, SPIRITUAL DEATH.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. you hath he quickened. We are
[48:16] raised UP SEATED WITH HIM IN HEAVENLY
[48:17] PLACES. THIS IS ANOTHER CHRISTMAS.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; So when we point you to the cross,
[48:25] THAT'S THE PLACE YOU HAVE to come in the
[48:27] first Christmas in order to enjoy
[48:29] another Christmas.
[48:32] And you, the corn of wheat, fall into
[48:34] Christ there and die. There's my death.
[48:39] You were born to die.
[48:43] You were born to die
[48:46] to sin to self.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; You were born for a grave but a watery
[48:51] one to be baptized in the name of the
[48:53] Lord Jesus Christ.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; That you were born in sin. THEREFORE,
[48:57] YOU THAT SIN HAS TO be uh reckoned with.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; You fall into Christ and there die. And
[49:04] he says and there you'll find his life
[49:07] in his word being the same yesterday,
[49:09] today, and forever. So it's not just
[49:12] death. It's not just cross but the
[49:13] resurrection. Let that be my Christmas
[49:15] message to you. I'm not pointing you to
[49:18] a manger, to a cradle, to a church, to a
[49:20] damination. But sir, as we would see
[49:21] Jesus,
[49:23] &gt;&gt; where do you want to see him? In an
[49:24] empty stable in in Bethlehem, an empty
[49:28] tomb in Jerusalem. He says, I'LL POINT
[49:29] YOU TO HIM. He points you to his death.
[49:33] I'm not I'M NOT POINTING YOU TO A CROSS.
[49:34] I'M POINTING YOU TO HIM. AND WHAT DOES
[49:36] HE EXPRESS TO YOU? REMEMBER THE
[49:37] SCRIPTURE WE READ ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT? HE
[49:39] STILL HAD THOSE NAIL SCARS.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; HE STILL WANTS HIS DEATH BEING SIGNIFIED
[49:44] TO YOU.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; He points YOU TO HIS DEATH, BURIAL, AND
[49:48] RESURRECTION. And you let your own corn
[49:50] of wheat fall in there and let his word
[49:53] become real in you. And you'll see that
[49:55] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[49:57] forever.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; It becomes a Bethlehem in your heart.
[50:00] Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; But not a Bethlehem that leads to a
[50:03] cross. Not a Bethlehem that leads to a
[50:05] grave as it did for him. But a Bethlehem
[50:07] that was a that's a resurrection from
[50:09] the all that live.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE BETHLEHEM IDENTIFIES HIM
[50:13] WITH ISRAEL IDENTIFIES HIM MORE NARROWLY
[50:15] WITH THE HOUSE OF DAVID. BUT WHEN HE
[50:17] ROSE FROM THE GRAVE, YOU CAN IDENTIFY
[50:19] WITH THAT.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; HE came from THE HOUSE OF ALL LIVING.
[50:22] THAT WE WHO ARE SINFUL, WE THAT ARE
[50:24] ALIVE, CAN COME TO HIM AND RECEIVE HIM
[50:27] AND DIE TO DEATH AND BY FAITH BELIEVE
[50:29] THAT WE CAN BE born again to new life
[50:32] &gt;&gt; and he can become real in you. His word
[50:35] being born in your heart.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; I think it's wonderful that that night
[50:38] that Christ was born
[50:41] seemingly innocuous, not a lot going on,
[50:43] but yet here a royal birth.
[50:46] And that's how the new birth is today.
[50:49] [music]
[50:53] And there's much less fanfare on the day
[50:55] that he rose from the grave.
[50:58] And if anything, your resurrection from
[50:59] sinful death. There I was dead. He said
[51:02] dead. Paul said dead in sins and
[51:04] trespasses. But now we've been
[51:06] quickened.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Resurrected from the dead as it were.
[51:09] [music] That's why he that believeth in
[51:10] me, he says that u shall pass. We've
[51:12] passed from death unto life.
[51:16] I no great announcement,
[51:19] no angels fill in the sky.
[51:23] [music]
[51:25] Let his word become real in you and
[51:27] you'll see he's the same yesterday,
[51:28] today, and forever. He is [music] the
[51:30] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[51:36] That's my my Christmas message to you is
[51:39] the second Noel as we ponder the birth
[51:41] of Jesus Christ. Is that two? As we
[51:44] ponder the birth of Jesus Christ, let us
[51:47] think about what that cradle meant,
[51:51] that cave and the grave,
[51:54] THAT THAT HILLSIDE in Mount Calvary,
[51:58] that cradle and that cross, all all
[52:00] these images, a ba a man who is destined
[52:02] to give his life, a lamb that came into
[52:04] the world. But with and that's the first
[52:06] Noel,
[52:07] behold your king UPON THE CROSS, KING OF
[52:09] THE JEWS.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; There he hangs.
[52:14] And to the Jews, their king was
[52:15] crucified. To the Jews, their Messiah
[52:18] was crucified. But when he rose up on
[52:20] Easter morning, this is the perfect
[52:22] Easter message. I've gotten it out of
[52:23] the way for 2026 already.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Marty studied up.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; HERE HE IS. HE RISES FROM THE GRAVE.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST FOR THE HOUSE of Israel. NOT
[52:32] JUST FOR THE HOUSE OF DAVID, BUT FOR
[52:34] YOU.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; YOU WHO SIT UNDER THE IN THE CHAINS OF
[52:37] DEATH, THE CHAINS OF SIN. HE BROKE THOSE
[52:39] CHAINS.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; HE PURCHASED YOUR DELIVERANCE. HE
[52:42] PURCHASED YOUR SALVATION AND HE RAISES
[52:45] FROM THE GRAVE. I SAY THE SECOND NOEL.
[52:48] HALLELUJAH. THE SECOND CHRISTMAS IS MY
[52:51] THE GREATEST gift
[52:54] &gt;&gt; because it's that culmination of that
[52:56] first gift.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Ring the bells.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; RING THE BELLS. THE SECOND NOEL. CHRIST
[53:03] IS alive
[53:04] &gt;&gt; and he reigns forever more. Let's stand
[53:06] to our feet. Let's rejoice in him. Let's
[53:09] give him praise for what he has done for
[53:12] us.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Let's pray. Our
[53:15] gracious heavenly father,
[53:17] Lord, on this Sunday before Christmas,
[53:21] we think of that day that you sent your
[53:23] son into this world.
[53:26] Lord, at your annunciation of his birth
[53:28] from the angel to Mary, the Holy Ghost
[53:31] shall overshadow you.
[53:33] And the child which shall be conceived
[53:35] in you shall be the Messiah.
[53:38] His name shall be Jesus.
[53:41] To Joseph, he was
[53:45] the son of God that would save this
[53:47] Israel from their sins.
[53:53] Lord, I thought about this quite a bit
[53:54] over the last month or so.
[54:00] After that day,
[54:06] no birth from that point
[54:10] was ever like it was before that day.
[54:15] Mankind before that day had no hope.
[54:18] It was all future
[54:21] bound up even for Israel because Paul
[54:22] taught that in that seed which is
[54:24] Christ, it redeemed those that were
[54:26] past. They had a future hope.
[54:29] But now, Lord, even though we would be
[54:31] pagan born, Gentiles, sinners,
[54:34] what hope there was
[54:37] because you [music] sent your son into
[54:38] the world.
[54:40] And Lord, as much as we are celebrating
[54:42] his birth and we're thinking about it
[54:44] and we want to give some honor to it
[54:46] this week,
[54:49] that birth led to a cross. [music] It
[54:51] led to a death.
[54:54] And that death is not the end of the
[54:55] story. For there was a second Noel
[54:59] raised [music]
[54:59] from the dead,
[55:02] born from the grave. [music]
[55:05] Lord, it doesn't create double types and
[55:08] triple types and to be born again from
[55:11] the dead and it was another new birth.
[55:12] But Lord, it just represents and
[55:14] symbolizes
[55:16] this kinsman redeemer
[55:19] has purchased our salvation fully and
[55:22] completely.
[55:24] He was raised up from the grave and then
[55:26] ascended into heaven and presented
[55:28] himself before the father as a bloody
[55:30] lamb. The high priest himself, the lamb
[55:34] itself, the blood shed
[55:37] appears before the father as all the
[55:39] types and shadows of the old testament
[55:40] sacrifices showed. And he came, he
[55:42] purchased our redemption. Those gates
[55:44] opened up and he came in. And now Lord,
[55:47] we have the privilege
[55:49] &gt;&gt; of being identified with that sacrifice
[55:52] by his resurrection.
[55:56] And Lord, may there be a second Noel in
[55:58] our hearts.
[56:00] May we recognize that it's Christmas
[56:01] again in more ways than than one.
[56:06] Religious world, the political world,
[56:07] the economic world, all in darkness,
[56:09] getting darker every day. But it was at
[56:11] the darkest of the night and the darkest
[56:13] time you sent your son on that Christmas
[56:15] night. Today I say it is the rising of
[56:18] the sun. It is another Christmas. We've
[56:21] come to Christmas again. The world
[56:22] groping in darkness but your light is
[56:23] shining. May we see you in your word,
[56:26] Lord. May its radiant beam shine into
[56:28] our souls. And may we be identified with
[56:31] this Noel.
[56:33] We love you. We commit these people to
[56:35] you now in the name of Lord Jesus
[56:36] Christ.
[56:38] Amen.
