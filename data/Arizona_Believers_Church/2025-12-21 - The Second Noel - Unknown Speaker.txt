TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Matthew 1:es 18 to 23. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. It settles the question of who's the father. Joseph then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privy. So we see that she's with child. He knows this is not his. He doesn't understand the context. So then it says, "But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying St. Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins." Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, "Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us." Amen. You can be seated. I have did feel directed towards a a Christmas thought. There's a lot of things I'd been looking at uh in the latter part of the year where it seemed like it kept coming up um in certain context. And so, uh, it is a Christmas message. And my title is a little catchy, but it's the second Noel. And using that phrase, you're probably thinking of the first Noel. And it is a uh a very popular uh Christmas song. It was originally a a poem, I believe in German or maybe French. And then there's an English translation, not a translation, but an English version of the first Noel. And in that it says in the first Noel, the angels did say uh the angels said to the shepherds, "Born is the king of Israel." That was the pronouncement, the first Noel. And Noel essentially means Christmas. Um and that's the the meaning. It could have been called the second Christmas, but I just felt um the second Noel might might not be as uh clickbaity as the second Christmas, but this uh this is my thought in drawing from even that that song, Born is the King of Israel. That was the first Christmas was that birth of the king. And I like to explore it from this standpoint even as you see in this side the slide. This is Michelangelo's beta which is uh a sculpture of Mary holding Jesus not at his birth but after his death. And so I'm wanting to bring those two images together and the connection between uh conception and the cross or birth and the and death are uh reflected in art. As a matter of fact, when it comes to the birth of Jesus Christ, this is kind of where I begin to see this theme as it's represented in art a number of times there's an infant Christ who's portrayed carrying a cross. Um, in one particular piece of artwork, it's called the Annunciation. It's part of a much larger uh um altar piece, but you see, I don't know if you could see it here. I magnified it to the left side, but you see this infant being sent down from the father carrying a cross. And there's the angel giving this enunciation to Mary that she would receive a child. And so this image of the conception of Christ or the birth of Christ to the cross um is connected quite a bit in in imagery and in art and storytelling. And actually the early church uh celebrated Jesus's conception and death on the same day. And they believe that this is the day he was conceived. This is the day that he died. And so nine months later is how they begin to establish and fix a date for for Christmas. And so this idea of conception and birth and being bound together with even redemption which is what the cross represents uh is even part of the the Jewish tradition. Believe we've read this before. One of the rabbis in the earliest early century said in Nissan the world was created. In Nissan the patriarchs were born on Passover Isaac was born. And in Nissan our ancestors will re be redeemed in the time to come. And so some of the different rabbis and the oral tradition and the Talmud and and and the different storytellings of the rabbis, there might be different dates they affixed to it, but they put the birth and the death. They begin to put all those things on the same time at the same date because they they saw birth and life being associated with this redemption. In some modern art, we see it reflected where this particular piece here and there's a number of other ones where this is called the manger and the cross where we see this nativity scene but on a hill far away there in the background foreshadowing not just his birth but his death. uh it's it's represented in that image and in that picture. And art gives us an opportunity to do that. Or if you're you're telling a story, if you you can foreshadow, you can use this kind of imagery to portray that yes, this is a time of life coming forth, but at in the in the future, there's a cross to hang on. And and this is I almost thought about calling this um Christmas cliche because I think it is a very common theme to look at those two things together. So I don't think for a moment that I I feel like I'm breaking new ground here, but I do want to cover this very elementary principle uh about the the birth of Christ and the death of Christ being seen in the same image. And this isn't an odd notion as there's a significant symmetry between Christ's birth and his death. In Matthew 1 21 it says, "And she shall bring forth a son." This is what the angel says to Joseph in his dream. And we know we could read in other places where at the enunciation the angel is turn telling Mary that the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you and you're going to conceive and bring forth a son. And so it says she shall bring forth a son. That's birth. That's life. And thou shalt call his name Jesus. And so this uh Jehovah's Savior for he shall save his people from their sins. If you think about what this means, she a birth and salvation. It actually takes the manger and Mount Calvary and puts them in the same sentence. Puts them together in the same announcement to Joseph. She shall give birth and we know that's going to be uh there's going to place him in a manger. But then also he shall save. This is going to be through through his death. So birth and death are in this announcement to Joseph. And we know as we even have mentioned recently in these portraits of humanity and divinity that Jesus shared um the same kind of beginning of man being born of a woman and the same end of humanity uh uh by dying that that's the book ends to life. You're born and you die. In John Job 14:es 1 and two it says man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble. In some Bibles I think the heading says death comes to us all soon or eventually. He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down. He fleth also as a shadow and continueeth not. This is all men that man is born uh and it's a man born of a woman. If you if you're born of flesh and blood, then you don't live forever. You just have a definite time on earth and it's the number of days that we have and it's full of trouble. And we could all say amen to that. Uh but then he's but then he comes to the grave. Hebrews chapter 9 27 says, "As it is appointed unto men, once to die, but after this judgment." We know that it's been said that there's two things that are certain, death and taxes. And some of you have figured out the other part. Uh but yet the death part you can't figure out. Like that's the part these things are certain. And I knew I was forgetting something, but even brother Steven and sister Becky Sees, they are here for the winter. They're snowbirds, but they've just been faithful. They've jumped in. They've supported. And I had it even written down and everything. And I forgot to mention, can we start over? I'm going to have to cut that out of the post edits and keep me under an hour. Brother Eleazer is preaching in Flagstaff this weekend, I believe. So, remember him in prayer. Uh, there's a lot of things I mean, can we start over? I mean, no. I feel like I've [laughter] just forgotten a lot of stuff. But as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this judgment, death is certain. It comes to us all. Henry Wodsworth Longfellow writes in the Psalm of Life, "Art is long and time is fleeting, and our hearts, though stout and brave, still like muffled drums, are beating funeral marches to the grave." This is this is what mankind is from birth. There there's there's an end. When you're born, I know that we don't uh see our children come into the world and we begin to think about when they're going to die and their death. That's not what's in our mind. But the Bible's telling us that a man who's born has a certain end. There's a there's a time coming when life will expire. &gt;&gt; And so on the night that Christ was born, we could say that for all mankind, a man born of a woman, that there's this end in sight. There is a death on the horizon. But even on the night that Christ was born, there was a connection to the day of his death. There was a foreshadowing. In Luke 2:7, she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end. He is born naked at birth. What was he at his death? Naked, hanging upon the cross. He was born in a manger. That manger, they believe historically is heun out of the sight of a cave. He was born in the sight of a cave. Where was he buried? Buried in a cave. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham states in the sermon, who is Jesus? He said, "He came the most humblest birth that could ever be born of a peasant mother. Not even a place to lay to down to give birth to this baby. And his swaddling cloth, we're told, was off the yolk of an ox. They wrapped him in in the manger in a stinking stable over the wastegate in the stable. And the stable's not even a correct stable, a little cave in the side of the hill." So, here he is at his at his birth. He's in a huned out uh cave on a hill which they believe the place that Christ was buried was on that hill of Mount Calvary. Buried at a cave in the same place in Mark chapter 15 verses 45 and 46. And when he knew it and when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body of Joseph and we see um we're jumping in here. Joseph of Arythea wants to bury Jesus. And he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a sepllic which was heuned out of a rock and rolled a stone unto the door of the suppler. This is at his birth he comes forth naked and he's wrapped and placed in a manger born there in a a cave in the side of a hill. At his death he's taken down from the cross. He's wrapped up and he's put into a cave a hollowedout grave in the side of a hill. And in that image that we shared a moment ago, you see Christ at his birth, Mary holds him at the foot of a cradle, at his birth. But then here it's represented again held by Mary at the foot of the cross. And that image that we say, well, this is this imagery uh we put we put these things together when we begin to look at his life. We're not even telling the story of the in between. He's born and you see all this foreshadowing of his death. his birth was marching to death. And I know that we could say this of any human being that they're born and maybe when they're born they're swaddled and then when they're died when they die maybe there was a certain preparation that all men went through at that time and say well these these similarities this is what this is what they did to man this isn't distinguishing. So I'd say despite these similarities in the life, the birth and death of Christ, Christ's birth was in fact heavenly. &gt;&gt; That his birth was unlike any other birth, it was a very royal birth. Even though it was in a manger in a in a wastegate and a hewed out cave and you think, well, maybe this should have been in heaven or should have been in a palace and should have been a much better setting, his birth was still different than any other birth before. In Luke 2:8 versus to 14 and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over the flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them. This would have been a very supernatural happening. &gt;&gt; The shepherds just aren't watching their sheep and someone says, you know, I'm just getting this little inkling. I'm I'm getting it from the ether or this this lamb is talking to me. Tell them we should go down into Bethlehem. There's something very supernatural with this light is shining around. This glory fills their where they are. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy." &gt;&gt; This these good tidings of great joy to the shepherds. Now, I'm not sure if many of you can relate to this. Uh we recently had some friends of ours uh let us know that they were expecting a baby, and I was super excited and and really really happy. And some of our kids got really, really excited about it. And I could remember when I was like them, how excited I was when I heard my friends were having babies. And I'd be like, "Congratulations. It's so awesome. I'm so excited for you." And then when I had a baby, I felt like I had to kind of go back and tell all my friends. I didn't even know what I was saying. I'd like to say congratulations all over again with some real feeling and knowing what it means. And so there was this uh when he says these great tidings of great joy. It's not this announcement of a birth where we just know well that must be a nice thing. Congrat Well, good for them, right? Whoever it is that's having this baby. But it's good tidings of great joy to them. The shepherds could identify in this something that they could believe WHICH SHALL BE TO ALL PEOPLE. For unto you is born this day. Now catch this image in the city of David. What does this do? It it connects you with the throne, a savior which is Christ the Lord. So now you have uh the the Messiah coming forth in the city of David, a savior, and this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger. And when at this announcement and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God. This there's a Christmas song I really like. It says, "And the angels filled the sky." And we think, "Hark the herald angel sings, glory to the newborn king." And you just imagine that all of heaven was illuminated. &gt;&gt; That this would have been this brilliant radiating event. The multitude of the heavenly host praising God, SAYING, "GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND ON earth peace, goodwill toward men." This is a heavenly birth. &gt;&gt; This is this is moving. This is remarkable. This is different. Now I know you might have some stories about your birth a and everyone might have been impressed. You might have got a perfect apgar whatever that is and you might have just you might have weighed seven pounds and 77 ounces or.77. It just everything might have been perfect. You're born at I was going to say 7773 on the third day of the third month in the third year and everything may just be numerically perfect. I'm telling you I'm I'm I'm the a perfect child. But never has there been a birth &gt;&gt; from heaven like this. &gt;&gt; Jesus, the Bible tells us, is born of the seed of David, the house of David. He's a Messiah, king &gt;&gt; to the house of Israel. &gt;&gt; Revelations 22:1 16. I, Jesus, has sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright and morning star. Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice how it's this illumination, this brightness, this shining forth. I am the root and offspring of David. When he says that, key in on this, that makes it very narrow, very particular. He's the root and the offspring of David. &gt;&gt; In Matthew 15 24, but he answered and said, "I am not sent but under the lost sheep of the house of Israel." That that uh uh Greek woman that uh or the the [clears throat] gentile woman who's coming for healing. And he says, "Oh, uh, you know, this is I'm not sent to you." He was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. He was of the root and offspring of David. Behold, in the city of David is born the Messiah. So, the first the first Christmas is connected with heaven and this royal throne even on earth. And at the announcement of his birth, the the the night sky was illuminated. The Bible is expressing this. This is the image I see. This bright morning star would have been announced with a heavenly host and even the timing of his birth. There's this connection with his his coming forth as a light in darkness. As we sing and as it was sung Wednesday night by the Randos, it was oh night divine. It's that night time when he Christ was born. The shepherds were out by night watching their sheep. These angels appear and the heavens are illuminated. There's this stark contrast to the nighttime, to this rising of a sun, the birth of a sun. Oh, night divine. When the light of the world was laid in a stable. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When the announcement was, "Behold your king. Where is he? IS HE RIDING ON A WHITE HORSE? IS HE IN THE PALACE SOMEWHERE?" NO, HE'S LAYING IN A MANGER. BEHOLD YOUR MESSIAH. WHERE IS HE? HE'S WRAPPED IN swaddling clothes. That his birth though he shares that in common with men. This is a royal birth. This is a heavenly birth. This is a He's on a mission to the house of Israel. And where I'd like to cause you to begin to be more reflective about Christmas is the birth of Christmas points to Calvary. A death that would give salvation, that would bring redemption. As the Bible says, she shall bring forth a son. That's birth. And he shall save his people. That's death. John 1 29. The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith, Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world. &gt;&gt; He was born in a stable just as the lambs would be. He was visited by shepherds at his birth. You see the image? There's a reason why these things happen and you say, "Oh, well this is just poetry. This is just an allegory." No, these are real events. I believe my Bible's the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And anymore the more you believe in the in the truth of the Bible, the more rare of a Christian you become because most theology now Christian theology is, well, we we must just look at it as an allegory of living. And well, you can't take all this for fact because this was added in here and this was added in there. And really, it becomes a clever way to be able to tell you what you need to believe. But I believe it's not wrong to tell you as a Christian that God has a way of preserving a word in your language in whatever language it may be preserved in a letter that can reveal to you Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And he said that behold the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. You see that that's the very image that was portrayed at his birth. And as a lamb that takes away sins by John's own confession, he's pointing to a sacrifice. When Jesus stood before Pilate in John 18:37, he's asked, "Art thou a king?" Then well, we know he was he came as a king. As the sisters saying, "How many kings would lay down their throne, lay down their royal garments?" He came as a king. Jesus answered, "Thou sayest that I am a king." He says, "To this end was I born." Now, I know as he begins to describe this, we can see that it points to what he says next. But if you look at this image as as he is facing death and he's being arrested and he's being tried and and he knows death is certain, he's saying to this end was I born. The the song sung today, ring the bells. Born to die that man might live. Born to die on Calvary. What does that tell us? He was born for the purpose of dying. Right? &gt;&gt; WE COULD SAY THAT EVERY MAN is appointed to death and and every man who's born of a woman eventually is going to die. But you're not born to die. &gt;&gt; You're not born for the express purpose of finding a grave. &gt;&gt; You're not. You're born with another purpose. BUT JESUS IS THE ONLY one we can SAY WAS BORN TO DIE. &gt;&gt; That that was he says to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness under the truth. Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice. He was born with this mission with this commission with this purpose. A baby born to die. How how remarkable that is. So as Jesus was born on that day he was born the the heavens were illuminated. But now notice his death in Luke chapter 23:es 44 to 46. said it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness over all the earth until the 9th hour and the sun was darkened. Says in the veil of the temple was rent in the midst and Jesus had cried with a loud voice. He said father into thy hands I commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost. You read it in other places in terms of the darkness covering the earth. Darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And it says the sun was darkened. Think of this contrast. On the night of his birth, the heavens are illuminated. &gt;&gt; On the night of his birth, uh uh there's a you could say it's day that the the sun is being born a &gt;&gt; and the and the the IMAGE IS WELL, IT'S NIGHT TIME. and the sun is down, BUT NOW THE SUN IS COMING FORTH, BORN OF A WOMAN, and the heavens are illuminated. The light of the world has come. Maybe there's there maybe there is a star SHINING IN THE SKY THAT OTHERS CAN'T DISCERN AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IT stands for. BUT NOW WHEN HE DIES, THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS. It's midnight in the middle of the day. &gt;&gt; The whole earth is covered in darkness. AS THE AS THE SON OF GOD GIVES UP THE GHOST, THE LIGHT REFUS THE SUN REFUSES TO shine &gt;&gt; kind of as this antithesis to his birth. But why? Because as he was born at night and the light shone, now when he dies in the day, the sun refuses to shine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to express it this way. The first Christmas led to his death. WITHOUT WITHOUT his death, there would be no Christmas. There would be no glory in Christmas. &gt;&gt; You realize without this death upon the cross, we wouldn't be celebrating his birth. Right? &gt;&gt; It would would not even be a day on the calendar because Christmas is crowned with the glory of the cross. &gt;&gt; One uh old writer wrote one time, he said uh Christmas has a a glory. It has an honor, but it's borrowed from the cross. Brother Bradom makes this statement and serves as we would see Jesus. And I'm going to have to uh I accidentally just put this in low power mode. We're not charging this thing enough. But I'm going to skip to to this here. And sir, as we would see Jesus, he says, "We take the word Christmas." He says, "It's very seldom you ever hear Christ's name mentioned. You don't hear it mentioned. The lights and the tinsils all on Santa Claus, not on Christ. People hardly know what Christmas is really for. They've just paganized it and paganized it till it's become pagan. It's a great commercial day of celebration." So the celebration of Christ became paganized. &gt;&gt; We find the early church um that that there was some begin to they begin to honor and recognize that day but then it be paganiz and paganiz and mixed with these other traditions. He said I seen a sign not long ago SAID PUT CHRIST BACK in Christmas. Now they bring you to a church. You learn a creed. Then you then they bring you to a Christmas and what do they do? You see a Santa Claus. They bring you to a church, you see an organization, but Christ, I WANT YOU TO CATCH THIS. Christ brought them to the cross. And when you get a real disciple that'll point you to Christ, Christ will bring you to the cross where you are crucified with him &gt;&gt; and his eternal life and your life meet together and your life dies and you take on his eternal life and then you're a son of God. What a difference from a disciple of old and the disciples of today. &gt;&gt; On Christmas day, maybe they've TAKEN CHRIST OUT OF IT. And and I it it is interesting when some people say, "Well, I just say happy holidays." Well, that's a a holy day. It's all the same, right? We don't find Christ mass in in the scripture. And so, whatever it might be, at one time, MAYBE WE HAD CHRIST WAS THE FOCAL point of Christmas, then it becomes Exmas, and then it just becomes happy holidays, and it's further removed. BUT NOTICE HOW THAT if there's AN ATTEMPT TO PUT CHRIST BACK INTO CHRISTMAS, THEY PUT HIM IN A MANGER. And so they point you to these the images of his birth. But he says that Christ points you to the cross. &gt;&gt; And so we honor Christmas day because it's a prelude to that day on Calvary. &gt;&gt; It's a special day to us because it's connected with it's a special night, the night of his birth. It's a special night because it points to that day he died. If I could say this, the c the cradle points to the cross. That cave that he was born in points to that grave. And I'd like to take it a step further because there is a a second Noel. There's another Christmas day, if I could phrase it that way. Not one leading to an inevitable death, but to eternal life. Because Christ doesn't point you to the the uh the the cradle. He points you to the cross. &gt;&gt; And that cross purchases redemption. &gt;&gt; So the cross is not an ending point. &gt;&gt; It pays the price. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE POINTS YOU TO THE CROSS, NOW IF HE POINTED YOU TO a a a crib, then you know death is certain. But he doesn't point YOU TO THE CRIB. HE POINTS YOU TO THE CROSS KNOWING THAT DEATH HAS BEEN DEALT WITH. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. In Romans 1:es 1:5 and Paul A SERVANT OF JESUS CHRIST CALLED TO BE AN APOSTLE SEPARATE UNDER the gospel of God which he had promised to be for by his prophets in the holy scriptures concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord &gt;&gt; which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh &gt;&gt; and declared to be the son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead. &gt;&gt; Now catch these two different facets here. the seed of David after the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's the first Christmas. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE FIRST NOEL BORN IS the king of Israel. &gt;&gt; But now he says then declared to be the son of God BY THE RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; He was the seed of DAVID BY HIS FIRST BIRTH BY BEING BORN. BUT NOW HE SAYS BY THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD. HE'S DECLARED TO BE THIS ROYAL SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; A seed of David after the flesh. That's the first Christmas. but declared to be the son of God by his resurrection from the dead. This is another rising of the sun &gt;&gt; in Acts 13 32-37. Notice this. And we declare unto you glad tidings. This is the gospel being preached. They brought good tidings of great joy at his first birth. Now there's a glad tidings. How that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he raised up Jesus again. Notice the the glad tidings are not the birth but the resurrection. &gt;&gt; As it is also written in the second psalm, thou art my son. This day I have begotten thee. Now notice this. He raised up Jesus again as it is written in the second psalm. Thou art my son. This day have I begotten thee. Isn't that an interesting connection? It's the raising up of Jesus. Again, there's this declaration. This day have I brought you forth. And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead. Notice that's the theme he's on. He's not talking about the birth. He's talking about the resurrection. He raised him up from the dead. Now, no more to return to corruption. All right. Now, things are getting different. &gt;&gt; We can look to the resurrections of the Old Testament that men were raised from the dead, but not to incorruption. &gt;&gt; They would eventually have to die again. But now, this is different. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption. For David after he served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep. &gt;&gt; I like that. It kind of has a on sleep. He fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption. But he whom God raised again saw no corruption. &gt;&gt; This isn't a resurrection TO ULTIMATE DEATH AGAIN. THIS is a different one. I bring you glad tidings that Jesus has been raised AGAIN AS IT WAS PROPHESIED. THIS DAY HAVE I BEGOTTEN THEE. I'VE RAISED HIM UP FROM THE DEAD to no more see corruption. He was made the seed of David ACCORDING TO THE FLESH. HE DIED THE DEATH of even that David had died in the flesh, BUT HE'S DECLARED TO BE THE SON OF GOD ACCORDING TO THE RESURRECTION from the dead. &gt;&gt; To never die again or see corruption. Recognize these scriptures. I know you're probably already piecing them together. Revelations 1:5 and from Jesus Christ who's the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead. &gt;&gt; This is a different this is a different connection. And the prince of the kings of the earth. This is a different kind of language. Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. This is a another rising. &gt;&gt; You have one that comes from David from this. Oh, thank you. I can preach all day now. One from the house of David. He was begotten of the house of David. Born in Bethlehem. But now catch this. Now he's born. Says here, the first begotten of the dead. &gt;&gt; One from the house of David. This one from death. &gt;&gt; I know maybe you got your thinking caps on. You're chewing on it. As we used to say in the beginning, ponder that. And then I found out the young people were counting it and I ruined it for them. And you said ponder five times today. Then I stopped saying it, but it kept them awake for a while. They uh they fell on sleep eventually in Colossians chapter 1 18. And he is the head of the body, the church, which is the beginning, the first born from the dead. Amen. &gt;&gt; That in all things he might have the preeminence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's the first begotten of the dead. He is declared to be the son of God being raised from the dead. Thou art my son. This day have BEGOTTEN YOU WHEN HE RAISED UP Jesus again. He This is the language now being used of Christ, the firstborn from the dead. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 15 20. BUT NOW IS CHRIST RISEN FROM THE DEAD and become the first fruits of them that slept. This is this is to me this IS BEAUTIFUL. HE'S BORN OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL. So therefore THERE'S THIS CONNECTION THAT ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WOULD HAVE TO THE MESSIAH THAT WHEN ABRAHAM WAS PROMISED A SON AND THIS WAS THE SON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THAT ALL JEWS HAD AWAITED FOR. IF YOU WERE OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID, IF YOU WERE OF THE SEED OF ISRAEL, THIS WAS THE LONG- AWAITED PROMISED SON. But now, when he's born from the dead, he comes from the house of all living. &gt;&gt; CUZ NOT EVERYBODY WAS A JEW. &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT GENTILE WOMAN CAME TO HIM, HE SAYS, "I'M ONLY SENT TO THE LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL." THAT'S IN HIS FIRST CHRISTMAS. BUT NOW WHEN HE'S BORN AGAIN FROM THE DEAD, &gt;&gt; ALL HUMANITY DID NOT HAVE PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF DAVID. ALL HUMANITY DID NOT HAVE A PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL, BUT ALL HAVE AN APPOINTMENT IN THE HOUSE OF DEATH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And in Romans 5:12, wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. That's why we all have sinned and therefore death is certain because of sin &gt;&gt; and Jesus sealed his death when he took upon himself our sins. Yes. &gt;&gt; So in that way we could say that HE PORTRAYED THIS SIDE OF HUMANITY. HE BORE OUR SINS. THOUGH HAVING NOT committed sin, HE BECAME SINFUL. &gt;&gt; HE BECAME SIN. &gt;&gt; And in becoming sin, he he died in ourstead. But this death that passed upon all men comes because we've sinned. The first Noel was from Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; The second Noel is from the grave. The first Christmas connects him with Israel. The second Christmas, if I could use that language and just bear with me in that, the second Christmas connects him to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Mark 16:6 when he on his resurrection day, the angel is there at his tomb. remember in his in his when he's born in that cave on the side of the hill there's an an angel of the Lord that says go to that place and there you'll find him wrapped in swaddling clothes but now on this day says be not afraid ye seek Jesus of Nazareth came early in the morning which was crucified he is risen he's not here &gt;&gt; little bit of a twist YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND HIM WRAPPED IN in linens not going to find him wrapped in GRAVE GRAVE CLOTHES THE SHEPHERDS FOUND HIM A HELPLESS LESS BABY IN THE SIDE OF A HILL LAYING IN A MANGER. BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND THE MESSIAH IN A IN A GRAVE WRAPPED IN GRAVE CLOTHES. Behold the place where they laid him. IT'S NOW NOT JUST AN EMPTY CRADLE, BUT AN EMPTY GRAVE. &gt;&gt; And there is the second Noel. Risen is the king. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8 29. Why does this happen? for whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is an affinity that we all have as human beings being born of a woman. Despite all sorts of technological advancements in science a and crisper and gene editing and all sorts of ways that we can conceive and become more fertile, you're still born through the same process of a male and female part. the parts be combined, the germ and the seed be combined in some sort of incubation period and then a birth coming forth from a woman's womb &gt;&gt; and then that man born of a woman. Science hasn't figured out how to make you live forever. &gt;&gt; There still is a death that comes to all men &gt;&gt; and he shares that. But we cannot share naturally with the way that he was born first, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; By conception. supernatural. &gt;&gt; The woman is not even a part of it. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, a lot of in the church, some of the the Catholic church begin to object to the the portrayal of the Christ coming from heaven uh uh and the images and art because it didn't depict Mary as being virgin born and it didn't it didn't depict her as being the actual mother of Jesus. That the humanity of Jesus came from Mary and that's a Catholic doctrine. Right? &gt;&gt; And so they actually begin to try to scrub that out of the the art books and art history and the portrayals because they wanted the woman to have SOME PART IN THAT. BUT LISTEN, CHRIST WAS BORN OF GOD. The blood that was in him was divine. It was deity. &gt;&gt; IF HE WAS ALL MAN, IT WAS BY GOD'S CREATION. THE FIRST THE the beginning of THE CREATION OF GOD, THE WORD MADE FLESH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He shares that with us or he does not we do not share that with him. BUT WE CAN say through the new birth our soul does. &gt;&gt; Through the new birth THAT THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR BIRTHING FORTH TO LIFE. BUT THEN NOTICE HOW HE'S RAISED from death. &gt;&gt; This is this IS WHAT MAN MAN MUST FACE THIS DEATH. AND WHEN HE'S RAISED FROM THE DEAD, HE BECOMES THE FIRSTBORN AMONG MANY BRETHREN. &gt;&gt; NOT THAT IT'LL COME FORTH FROM A WOMAN UH VIRGIN BORN, BUT THAT THERE WOULD BE NOT ONLY JUST EVEN A NEW LIFE INSIDE OF YOU, BUT DEATH IS DEAD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; In first Corinthian, excuse me, 1 Peter chapter 1:3, blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to HIS ABUNDANT MERCY HATH BEGOTTEN US AGAIN &gt;&gt; unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. &gt;&gt; How beautiful this is that even our new birth gives us a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Not the birth of Jesus in a manger and not even his death upon the cross, which is integral. It's part of it. I'm not trying to separate it out. But that day it became midnight in the middle of the day. The sun refused to shine. Refused to shine. And we could say perhaps that Friday and that Saturday were the darkest days ever on earth. But on that resurrection morning when that son rose, the tomb was empty &gt;&gt; and he became the first begotten from the dead. &gt;&gt; The first fruits of them that slept. &gt;&gt; If if if he was born of a virgin, we we can't even aspire to that. &gt;&gt; If he died a HORRIFIC DEATH UPON THE CROSS, we could mimic that. BUT NOW THAT HE'S raised again from the grave, we have something to look to as OUR MODEL. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE SOMETHING to celebrate this resurrection. HE'S BEGOTTEN US AGAIN BY THE NEW BIRTH. HAD HE NOT RESURRECTED, THEN HE COULD NOT WE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So if I could say we do not share in the first Christmas by our natural birth, again, not of the house of Israel. We're not sinless. We're not born of a virgin. But we do have an identification in the second Noel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We do have a representation in the second Christmas as it is said in Johnap 11:es 25- 26. This is at a time of the resurrection of Lazarus. His sisters were weeping and crying and one said, "Oh Lord, had you been here, he would not have died." He says, "Do you believe he can live again?" She says, "I know one day in the resurrection, he'll live again." But then he wanted her to look at him differently. He said, "I am the resurrection and the life." &gt;&gt; Quite a statement because here he here he stands living having never died. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But he says, "I am the resurrection and the life." &gt;&gt; And and he doesn't say the life and the resurrection. &gt;&gt; It's I I'm living now. It's appointed all men once to die, but I'm a baby born to die. I'm a man that's destined to die. To this end came I into the world. Behold the lamb of God who's going to shed his blood for the sinner. BUT SO BUT I'M THAT'S NOT JUST WHAT DEFINES ME. &gt;&gt; One of the most outstanding characteristics I believe of Jesus CHRIST THAT REALLY STUMBLES people today because well we just want Jesus. We just want Jesus. And really what they want to do is they just want to sit at the foot of the cross and worship a Jesus who's still crucified &gt;&gt; or they want to sit at the foot of a major and worship a Jesus that's still wrapped in swaddling clothes. They want the red letter of the gospels. They want Jesus. But Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is the word the living word of God that makes God present. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; See a little Christmas tie in there. He makes God present. &gt;&gt; It's God's presence. That's what Christmas means. That's what it represents. That if there's if there's going to BE ANOTHER CHRISTMAS, IT'S DECLARING THE PRESENCE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AT THE SECOND NOEL, IT'S NOT WELL, HE'S DEAD AND HE'S NOT HERE AND HIS SOUL IS IN HELL OR HIS SPIRIT'S BACK IN HEAVEN, BUT HE'S ALIVE. HE LIVETH EVER MORE. &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And Jesus Christ, he said, "Before Abraham was, I am." &gt;&gt; And who was it he met? It wasn't that Jesus of Nazareth. Paul said, "Have I not met Jesus Christ, our Lord?" That that's not the one that's not the one that was in the grave or the one that walked the the earth. Paul wasn't there to meet him. This is after his resurrection. He says, "I'm the resurrection and the life." This is something new. &gt;&gt; Then he says, "He that believeth in me, though he were dead, &gt;&gt; yet shall he live." Amen. &gt;&gt; There's that uh uh the new birth and you he says you've passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; And then this statement becomes the door into which we see Paul teaching we shall not all fall on sleep. &gt;&gt; We shall be changed. He said whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. &gt;&gt; He says believeth thou this? &gt;&gt; I believe that. modern Christian uh Christmas celebrations have largely abandoned honoring Christ's birth just in the modern sense and maybe it's more inclusive they want to include everyone in on it and so there's all sorts of different ideas of Christ figures or messiahs or celebrations but if we could say in a in a worldly sense it's a secular holiday everyone's celebrating Christmas uh and it's gone so far now to where Christmas being secular and pagan and commercialized. Now it's artificial polar bears and Coca-Cola trucks, right? And these are the images. The Norman Rockwell Christmas, the the the the man who invented Christmas as it's been said about Charles Dickens has created this this image. Even a lot of our modern Christian Christmas celebrations are exactly that modern. They've h they've transpired in the last 150 years. &gt;&gt; And [clears throat] and they are somewhat detached from Christ. &gt;&gt; The Christmas tree originally was used to honor Christ. It represented the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Uh it wasn't used in a pagan sense, but now a Christian Christmas tree in a home is just a it's a Christmas tree in a home. That's all it is. Don't try to make it into anything more than that. &gt;&gt; And I'm not necessarily saying yes or no on that. And I think each person says celebrate Christmas as they feel led to. And but yet there's now that symbol at one time might have meant something to a Christian. Now it's completely stripped of any meaning in symbolism. &gt;&gt; And I would even say that most modern Christian Christmas celebrations when they try to bring Christ back into Christmas they point to a cradle. So is there something wrong with that? No. No. There's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with pointing to a cradle. But if when you look at that cradle, it doesn't lead you to a cross. &gt;&gt; We've sanitized &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; We've made him less controversial. We've made him uh less repulsive. We we can embrace this innocent baby lying in a manger. We love the story. It carries some of the traditional narratives that make storytelling so compelling. Here he is. Uh this this move this government taxation or census has caused this young woman with child to travel over this land and terrain. It's at night. They can't find a place to stay. All the tension is building. There he is. They're in a stable and this baby COMES BEING BORN AND and the stillness that WOULD SEEM TO CATCH THAT MOMENT AND THE CRY OF THE BABY. OH, THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A CHRISTMAS MOVIE WE CAN WATCH. But if what that SCENE LEADS US TO IS this horrific DEATH UPON A CROSS, A LET'S JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE. LET'S JUST CELEBRATE CHRIST the baby. Let's not celebrate his uh uh his symbolic AND NECESSARY WASHING IN the Jordan. Let's not watch his life as HE BEGIN TO BE IDENTIFIED AND PREACH THE GOSPEL AND PREACH THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND. LET US NOT WATCH THIS GREAT LIGHT THAT BEGIN TO SPRING UP TO ALL THOSE that set in the regions of the lost and in darkness AND LO. LET'S NOT LOOK AT HIM AS HE STANDS BEFORE PILATE. &gt;&gt; Let's not look at him as he's scourged and beaten. Let's not look at him as he hangs there upon the cross. But that's what the that's what the cradle points to. Brother Brandham in that same sermon paragraph 28 says GGreeks wanted to know it and serves as we would see Jesus and he gave them a way to know him to know him not to know his creed not to know his word not to know his miracles don't mean to step on toes but to know him and the only way you'll find that is at the cross not at the cradle &gt;&gt; it's the cross &gt;&gt; he pointed them to a cross not a creed not a manger or manner of denominations but to the crossmen Not one time did he in did did he point any person to any creed, any denomination or to his birth or even to Christmas. Not one time did he ever do it. &gt;&gt; What was he leading it to? He was leading it to a cross. &gt;&gt; We honor Christmas because the cross. &gt;&gt; Wait, it it means something to us because of what it represents. &gt;&gt; The savior of the world. How did he become a savior? Not by being born, but by dying. Yes. &gt;&gt; How how did he be how did he redeem US FROM OUR SINS? NOT by being innocent but becoming guilty. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S REFLECTED IN THAT BORN IN A STABLE AS A LAMB VISITED BY SHEPHERDS as lamb. A newborn lamb would be he's speaking to us not so much OF THIS INNOCENCE OF BIRTH BUT A BABY BORN to die THAT HE MIGHT BE A CHILD GIVEN to redeem man from his sins. SHE SHALL BRING FORTH A son and he shall save his people from their sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me emphasize it this way. That's the end of the first Christmas. We're at another Christmas again. &gt;&gt; This is another Christmas. World groping in darkness. Christ bound by creeds and denominations and man's interpretation. THE WHOLE WORLD GOING INSANE. THIS WORLD IS FALLING APART. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S HARD TO FIND A A A VOICE ANYMORE THAT WOULD LIFT UP THE PURITY OF THE GOSPEL WITHOUT PRETENSE. AND POLITICS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; And just AS CHRIST CAME ON THAT DARK NIGHT AS THE INNOCENT lamb of God to take away the SINS OF THE WORLD, WE'RE AT ANOTHER CHRISTMAS AGAIN. WHAT IS THAT CHRISTMAS? CHRIST is alive. DECLARED HIMSELF TO BE REAL. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; The Christmas isn't his death. It's the second Noel. His presence is amongst us. He's confirming his word. So the lost are being saved. THE SICK ARE BEING HEALED. THE WORD is being opened UP TO US. THAT'S THE PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST UNRECOGNIZED TODAY. &gt;&gt; If our musicians would come to their instruments this last statement from that sermon, sir, we would see Jesus beautiful Christmas message. He says, "My Christmas message is let me point you tonight to the cross." Now, now I realize that the Christmas message is pointing to a cross. And and you say, "Well, brother Aaron, you're saying there's a second Christmas." That's what the cross made a way for. &gt;&gt; Without death, there cannot be life. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm the resurrection and the life." What does that speak to? NOT THE LIFE AND THE RESURRECTION, but the life that I now live. I live by the faith of the SON OF GOD WHO GAVE HIS LIFE FOR ME. So this is, as Paul said, newness of life, new creatures in Christ Jesus. So he is the first begotten of the dead, the first fruits of them that slept. That there is life EVEN AFTER DEATH, SPIRITUAL DEATH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. you hath he quickened. We are raised UP SEATED WITH HIM IN HEAVENLY PLACES. THIS IS ANOTHER CHRISTMAS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So when we point you to the cross, THAT'S THE PLACE YOU HAVE to come in the first Christmas in order to enjoy another Christmas. And you, the corn of wheat, fall into Christ there and die. There's my death. You were born to die. You were born to die to sin to self. &gt;&gt; You were born for a grave but a watery one to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That you were born in sin. THEREFORE, YOU THAT SIN HAS TO be uh reckoned with. &gt;&gt; You fall into Christ and there die. And he says and there you'll find his life in his word being the same yesterday, today, and forever. So it's not just death. It's not just cross but the resurrection. Let that be my Christmas message to you. I'm not pointing you to a manger, to a cradle, to a church, to a damination. But sir, as we would see Jesus, &gt;&gt; where do you want to see him? In an empty stable in in Bethlehem, an empty tomb in Jerusalem. He says, I'LL POINT YOU TO HIM. He points you to his death. I'm not I'M NOT POINTING YOU TO A CROSS. I'M POINTING YOU TO HIM. AND WHAT DOES HE EXPRESS TO YOU? REMEMBER THE SCRIPTURE WE READ ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT? HE STILL HAD THOSE NAIL SCARS. &gt;&gt; HE STILL WANTS HIS DEATH BEING SIGNIFIED TO YOU. &gt;&gt; He points YOU TO HIS DEATH, BURIAL, AND RESURRECTION. And you let your own corn of wheat fall in there and let his word become real in you. And you'll see that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; It becomes a Bethlehem in your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; But not a Bethlehem that leads to a cross. Not a Bethlehem that leads to a grave as it did for him. But a Bethlehem that was a that's a resurrection from the all that live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE BETHLEHEM IDENTIFIES HIM WITH ISRAEL IDENTIFIES HIM MORE NARROWLY WITH THE HOUSE OF DAVID. BUT WHEN HE ROSE FROM THE GRAVE, YOU CAN IDENTIFY WITH THAT. &gt;&gt; HE came from THE HOUSE OF ALL LIVING. THAT WE WHO ARE SINFUL, WE THAT ARE ALIVE, CAN COME TO HIM AND RECEIVE HIM AND DIE TO DEATH AND BY FAITH BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BE born again to new life &gt;&gt; and he can become real in you. His word being born in your heart. &gt;&gt; I think it's wonderful that that night that Christ was born seemingly innocuous, not a lot going on, but yet here a royal birth. And that's how the new birth is today. [music] And there's much less fanfare on the day that he rose from the grave. And if anything, your resurrection from sinful death. There I was dead. He said dead. Paul said dead in sins and trespasses. But now we've been quickened. &gt;&gt; Resurrected from the dead as it were. [music] That's why he that believeth in me, he says that u shall pass. We've passed from death unto life. I no great announcement, no angels fill in the sky. [music] Let his word become real in you and you'll see he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He is [music] the same yesterday, today, and forever. That's my my Christmas message to you is the second Noel as we ponder the birth of Jesus Christ. Is that two? As we ponder the birth of Jesus Christ, let us think about what that cradle meant, that cave and the grave, THAT THAT HILLSIDE in Mount Calvary, that cradle and that cross, all all these images, a ba a man who is destined to give his life, a lamb that came into the world. But with and that's the first Noel, behold your king UPON THE CROSS, KING OF THE JEWS. &gt;&gt; There he hangs. And to the Jews, their king was crucified. To the Jews, their Messiah was crucified. But when he rose up on Easter morning, this is the perfect Easter message. I've gotten it out of the way for 2026 already. &gt;&gt; Marty studied up. &gt;&gt; HERE HE IS. HE RISES FROM THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST FOR THE HOUSE of Israel. NOT JUST FOR THE HOUSE OF DAVID, BUT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU WHO SIT UNDER THE IN THE CHAINS OF DEATH, THE CHAINS OF SIN. HE BROKE THOSE CHAINS. &gt;&gt; HE PURCHASED YOUR DELIVERANCE. HE PURCHASED YOUR SALVATION AND HE RAISES FROM THE GRAVE. I SAY THE SECOND NOEL. HALLELUJAH. THE SECOND CHRISTMAS IS MY THE GREATEST gift &gt;&gt; because it's that culmination of that first gift. &gt;&gt; Ring the bells. &gt;&gt; RING THE BELLS. THE SECOND NOEL. CHRIST IS alive &gt;&gt; and he reigns forever more. Let's stand to our feet. Let's rejoice in him. Let's give him praise for what he has done for us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Let's pray. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, on this Sunday before Christmas, we think of that day that you sent your son into this world. Lord, at your annunciation of his birth from the angel to Mary, the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you. And the child which shall be conceived in you shall be the Messiah. His name shall be Jesus. To Joseph, he was the son of God that would save this Israel from their sins. Lord, I thought about this quite a bit over the last month or so. After that day, no birth from that point was ever like it was before that day. Mankind before that day had no hope. It was all future bound up even for Israel because Paul taught that in that seed which is Christ, it redeemed those that were past. They had a future hope. But now, Lord, even though we would be pagan born, Gentiles, sinners, what hope there was because you [music] sent your son into the world. And Lord, as much as we are celebrating his birth and we're thinking about it and we want to give some honor to it this week, that birth led to a cross. [music] It led to a death. And that death is not the end of the story. For there was a second Noel raised [music] from the dead, born from the grave. [music] Lord, it doesn't create double types and triple types and to be born again from the dead and it was another new birth. But Lord, it just represents and symbolizes this kinsman redeemer has purchased our salvation fully and completely. He was raised up from the grave and then ascended into heaven and presented himself before the father as a bloody lamb. The high priest himself, the lamb itself, the blood shed appears before the father as all the types and shadows of the old testament sacrifices showed. And he came, he purchased our redemption. Those gates opened up and he came in. And now Lord, we have the privilege &gt;&gt; of being identified with that sacrifice by his resurrection. And Lord, may there be a second Noel in our hearts. May we recognize that it's Christmas again in more ways than than one. Religious world, the political world, the economic world, all in darkness, getting darker every day. But it was at the darkest of the night and the darkest time you sent your son on that Christmas night. Today I say it is the rising of the sun. It is another Christmas. We've come to Christmas again. The world groping in darkness but your light is shining. May we see you in your word, Lord. May its radiant beam shine into our souls. And may we be identified with this Noel. We love you. We commit these people to you now in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
