TRANSCRIPT
========================================
today by the grace of God we want to speak on something I I believe that is very important in this hour and and you know there's a whole lot going on and if you ask the question in the religious ranks or in in a political rinks or whatever in the world how do we judge it you know and and the prophet kind of made it clear you know when you when you look at something or you judge something it's two things you can judge it by you you can judge it by the motive and objective what a man is trying to achieve and you can also judge it by its character and today that's kind of what we want to deal with the ingredients of character you know if you if you look at yourself and and you can't really say uh where we say this a lot you know when certain things happen you say well that's just not my character you know and normally when people say that it's they're standing against something that they pretty much don't want to do you know but the character of a thing it speaks on its own you don't have to say well that's just not my character your expression in the works that you do will tell me what your character is but if we look at character just wanted some definitions of character just to kind of lay out you know kind of where we're going character can be defined as a collective personality traits within our behavior that shows who we are amen so the behavior of a thing it can kind of identify the character of it amen if you take a lion Hallelujah a lion he doesn't bounce around on two feet no that's that's not his behavior you know a a a a lion there's something about it the strength of a lion that it just it just bears that it just oozes out it just comes out you know the way a lion hunt is different from the way a giraffe goes and eats his food why because the characteristics he's made up with and you know that's something that doesn't have to be taught as it grows and grows the characteristics of that lion it just comes out even when it's in a little kitten form the characteristics of his nature is already inside of it when it's a little kitten but as it grows and grows and that it eats and feeds and goes around it begins to develop the characteristics Hollywood where the characteristics of that lion begins to come out and you know if we look at the world today and we got churches all over the place we got preachers all over the place but what are we looking for we're looking for the true identity of God we're looking for the true characteristics of God but I kind of want to bring out the ingredients of this thing so we don't uh fall fall short look at that false prophets and false teachers and false christs because the prophet of God said when you said false Christ that means a false anointing amen for there to be a false anointing there has to be a true anointing but the two can be so close it can deceive Hallelujah not the very elect Hallelujah but it can deceive those who are so close looking at it they'll think it's real but what we want church we want to be able to identify something by the characteristics that is oozing that's coming out of it now what makes us different from denominational churches they have healing in their churches they pay tithes they have nice buildings all these things so what are we looking for there has to be some ingredients within our within us that separates us from them hey man the ingredients of our character amen and you know the uh the prophet of God he will say that character is a victory hallelujah it's not a gift so we look at the the the coming out of character something has to mold you into the place where I can see Christ in you amen if we look in the Bible we can see that there are some ingredients Hallelujah that shows a man's character and you know I kind of want to take two Prophets two prophets in the bible both were were considered to be true prophets amen but one was lacking some ingredients and the other one had all the things that God hallelujah were made up of the first one I want to use is a man named Balaam Hallelujah and Balaam we know that the Bible says that he was a man he was a he was a prophet of God even our Prophet said he was a true prophet he had contact with God he could go to God and pray and God will respond to him my church there are people hallelujah all over the Earth who will pray and God will answer their prayers but does that mean their bride material um we hear it all the time I'm here because God led me I did just because God spoke to me I heard the voice of the Lord so here I am what makes us different and keep in mind I'm not pointing a finger at anybody Hallelujah but I want us I want us to catch I want us to catch our true characteristics of God you know your character there's things about you that'll just speak out whether you want it or not and I can tell certain characteristics hey young man what's your name say it again villain rolling okay all right roll it I want you to catch this ball with one hand all right only one you can't use two only one all right let me throw it back I need two now I'm gonna step back a little farther you can only use one hand oh that's pretty good throw it back all right you can only use one hand all right you ready here we go everybody watching rolling did I say it right you ready to roll it oh all right did y'all see that now can we all tell they're rolling am I saying it right rolling is what right-handed why because the characteristics of him using his one hand he never switched hands but every time I throw the ball he used one hand and before he even got ready he took his left hand and buried it to show me what the characteristics of a right-hand young man see I didn't have to guess at it he showed it to me the more I threw that ball the more that right hand come up and the higher I threw it he used the same hand right what was it it's the characteristics of a person who's right-handed amen and you know something to cast the richness of your behavior it'll just come out in whatever you're doing if you're a Christian the characteristics of a Christian will come out if you got faith Hallelujah the character reasons of faith will come out when you're in tight situations if you a Believer hallelujah amen you will search the scriptures Hallelujah to find things Hallelujah that can identify with you a lot of characteristics has come out now if I take this same ball and I give it and I'll tell one of the girls over here and I say you can only use one hand I ain't gonna put y'all on the spot Hallelujah but if I take it and I throw it back there to Eli you're not hold the baby so I ain't gonna do it but if I take it and I throw it back to somebody or one of the brothers or sisters you're going to use the hand that you're most comfortable with why because you're showing me your characteristics amen and when it comes to God Amen the characteristics of Christ in tight situations amen it'll just come out there's nothing special you have to do amen if you are a lover of the things of God Amen when somebody's persecuting you what comes out the characteristics of love amen those things are already we say God please give me more perfect love you know how you're going to get it when you receive perfect hatred that's how you yo yo that's why your character is a victory amen because amen character has elements in it Hallelujah that's molded and build it into you in situations that you can't explain it just comes out Hallelujah so we're going to look at Balaam and we're going to look at the character of Balaam even though he was a true Vindicated prophet sure balak came to him he said hey I want you to curse these people so he said I can only do what God tell me to do he goes and what he goes to have confidence with God am I in the book am I in numbers Hallelujah you know when he from from the south we say numbers you know some of you guys might say numbers real proper so I hope you understand what I'm saying and I can speak a little fast sometimes so I'll try to slow it down but you know I'm an evangelist those are my characteristics I'm not a teacher so I'm not going to stand back here too long this bothers me Hallelujah but as an evangelist there's certain characteristics about my person I'm loud I'm radical I'm wild and I can't be still why those are the characteristics of an evangelist s go away and then let me tell you this just in case you didn't know there's not another one like me [Applause] some men have the same characteristics as me Hallelujah but they don't have my person amen and there are churches who have some of the same characteristics but they don't have the person and the person is Christ if I'm gonna get back to Balaam you pulling real good and I got some things coming to me but there are people who look good look better than you but they don't have the person inside pushing hey man if you take Esau and Jacob Hallelujah the prophet of God said character-wise Esau was a better boy to his daddy shh oh Cain was just as a Believer as Abel was so there has to be some more ingredients that brings out the true character of God oh my and it has to be more than just hunting and fishing because Esau had that right you can't be just identified by hunting and fishing he so had that you can't just be identified by having a nice beautiful Game Room Esau had that if you know what I'm talking about Hallelujah but let's get back to Baylor that's the thing about an evangelist Hallelujah his subject is all over the place but we're looking for the true ingredients you know let's just say baking a cake most sisters when you bake a cake uh some of you may use box cakes and that's all right You Can Box Duncan Duncan Hines that's all right but you're a real cake baker you got your own ingredients you may get your your flower to rise and your eggs and your milk you know and add some more stuff in there and different stuff especially if you got Grandma's recipe there are certain ingredients in there Hallelujah that's been coming down from generation to generation and you don't add nothing to that why because you want the same product you want the same thing you grew up tasting and if it was good you definitely ain't going to change anything about it but you know sometimes people will add something to an ad something and what does it do it takes away from the original taste Hallelujah and then once you taste it you'll be like this ain't like Grandmama's own and if a person is a sister she getting her feeling she get mad well I just um and you're like you can say whatever you want that don't taste like Grandma's own but I got the same recipe I just add some paprika [Laughter] paprika and cake that doesn't go together it will never bring out Hallelujah the taste that we're looking for and a lot of times as Christians people try to add in things that will change the whole Taste of life we want the original life we want the original ingredients we don't want to add nothing to it why because we want to come out with what Christ we want Christ in Christ alone Hallelujah but if you go if you look at Balaam Balaam he says you know balak come to him and he says hey what I want you to do I want you to go curse these people he says okay all right let me go to God and see what God say first thing God said God said who you with first thing he was with the wrong people and first thing God did God like who these people you who you with he's like Lord I just want to know can I come guys they know you can't curse nobody you can't curse what's blessed so babe goes back to Bailey he says look I can't curse them better yet only thing I can do is bless them straight her straight from God Hallelujah a prophet what does the prophet do they normally hear from God and and when you judge those characteristics of Balaam he was a prophet but then after a while they like eat offers him something and he says you know whatever the scripture says money different things you know he offers him this and now his true nature is gonna come out even though he had straight contact with God his nature of who he really is is sent to override I just heard from God oh my God you can't hide it who you really are it's going to come out there's nothing you can do to stop it the nature of a thing will come out you know Hallelujah I was in I was in South Africa and I went to the lion Park and you know uh I'm from Carolina and we have a zoo foreign to South Africa going to the lion Park seeing those nine foot lions and comparing that to my Riverbank Zoo Lion my South Carolina I'm convinced after seeing what I saw in the characteristics of a lion in his habitat that my lion in Carolina is on dope beautiful I'm just being honest because I saw some lions and they habitat and they were just fiverring and moving and like if y'all get off this bus I'll eat y'all alive it was just the way they looked at us hallelujah they looked at us like we were praying they looked at us like y'all don't belong out here but back home in the zoo ain't even paying us no attention because they all shot up and dope up and tranquilized so they don't be who they really are Hallelujah go ahead cause a lion's not meant to be caged up it's meant to be out in a while it's called the king of the jungle because when it runs amen everything hushes his mouth I've seen that in person when that thing begins to roll and then let's lose it's like the crackling you're like okay I was on one bus one time and the lady holds me a couple years ago but I just went recently but this was a couple years ago the lions got to plan with each other they saw it was playing and they were growling and slapping and everything and and the two guys say oh it's time to go because even the plan with the Lions and different things they can hit you and you'll be messed up she said one hit her just playing Hallelujah and cut her open she had to get 150 stitches what was it it's the power of the Lion the characteristics the power is already there even when it's in play mode Hallelujah and I want to tell the Church of the Living God the power is in you and some of you are playing with it foreign who he is it begins to come out and he's he says okay well I know God said you can't curse what's blessed but but let me go back and make sure that don't even sound right think about it if you heard from God if you heard the voice of God and you knew it was God would you be going back saying Lord are you sure that's the sign of what an unbeliever so even though this man had contact with God he wasn't really a believer oh my and there are people who in position there are people who are anointed in position but they're not really who we think they are and again I ain't personally talking about nobody what I want us to do is examine ourselves because church amen I stay on my knees and I don't just want to be an evangelist of gifts Hallelujah but I want it to be a life Hallelujah I don't want it to be how do you come to church and your gift is who are in the people and then when you see me out in the streets I don't reflect a Christian Hallelujah that means Hallelujah I'm projecting a different kind of characteristic than I am when I'm in the Pulpit Hallelujah hey church I want to be real with God Amen I want to be real with God's people amen yeah we got false we got ups and downs and all these things but what do you do when you fall the real you will tell holy the Bible says a righteous man follows what seven times what makes him righteous he gets back up then his sins are not imputed to him why because he didn't mean to do what he did holy that's what the scripture says David says will not impart it to him imputed him why because it wasn't in his heart to do he was caught up in the moment Hallelujah the characteristics of a man after God's very own heart he could repent he could say God I'm sorry look at the ingredients church he was a man being used by God a mighty warrior but when he failed the characteristics of forgiveness hardly and sorrow Hallelujah and repentance came out do you see all of Christ in you that's what we want we want all of Christ we don't want just a show like Baylor man Balaam had the show he could get in contact with God but there were things he were missing foreign no damn goes back and he says hey Lord um are you sure are you sure you want to encourage these people I believe he he came back was a 2003 times one or two three comes back and God is tired of him why because God doesn't change so if God is giving you direct instructions don't keep going back to God saying Lord are you sure are you sure God are you Lord is that what you want me to be is that what you are you sure basically what you're saying to God is when you do that Lord you ain't lying to me is you you go to God and ask God all you're lying to me that ain't even one of God's attributes God don't know how to lie God don't know how to play with your feelings oh so whatever God could tell me it has to be for my good so I shouldn't question God I should say Okay Lord that's what Balaam should have did but Balaam wanted that money so bad the characteristics of greed and money Hallelujah overall the voice of God oh my the characteristics of a thing it cannot it will come out no matter how you see God sure where does that come from that came from his father because the devil was in God's presence the devil was God's right hand man but what was in his heart the characteristics of want to be lifted up the characteristics wanted to be worshiped everything that he saw look at his ingredients there was no humility in Lucifer that's one of the key ingredients of character humility being able to have the power but don't want it how many people do we know like that got the power but don't want it and I'm gonna say this I know y'all gonna laugh but when I think about this got the power and don't want it I know a person who got the power won't power won't the problem and my guy Trump when you make a statement when you go over to Korea and you watch how this man leads the people have the people bowing down and everything and you make a comment and say I wish the Americans respected leaders like this you can see what his characteristics really are he wants the Lord over the people his best interest is not in for the people the best interest is for himself all right now get out of the politics I ain't talking about politics I'm talking about the nature of a man Hallelujah think about it you put all the power of the world in his hand and the real him comes out he says okay rocket man I'm gonna blow you up see the real nature of a man comes out when that power's in him that's why the prophet of God will say hallelujah character is a victory Hallelujah he said without character Hallelujah you're not even fit to rule without character is what satanic and we see it all the time when men get in position Hallelujah and they get certain power hallelujah what it does it overrides it comes out in such a way to it makes people feel so big that's not the courage of God 's character is to lift you up Hallelujah and I know brother Aaron practiced this Hallelujah as a pastor his whole job is hallelujah to heal your wounds and lift you up me my character is to blow you away because I'm an evangelist whatever I see a Spirit Boom Boom Boom whenever I see a devil why because that's my nature see I'm not connected to your feelings here I don't care that's the characteristics of a pastor he can see things going on in the church and won't touch it not me I'm built to touch it I'm building to slice it hammer it shoot it drill it however just to get to that spirit Hallelujah that's the nature of an evangelist but don't get it twisted the pastor sees the same thing I see but his makeup is different he'll bear with you not me I don't have that nature thank God I'm not I'll be going crazy dealing with the issues in the church why don't you just listen to me think about it church I want to lift your pastor for a second I want you to see his characteristics for a second now Aaron ain't telling me to preach on this but I want you to see his character missions for a second hold you he can give you earlier Godly instructions Hallelujah and you'll come back and ask him the same thing again and he'll bear with you me on the other hand I'm like didn't because some of you might twist or something like I ain't gonna be a Christian and he talk about hitting people [Laughter] hey if there's no fight in the Christian you got to take David out of the Bible Hallelujah you got to have some Godly fight inside of you for what's right amen not to hurt not to destroy but for what is right that's why David fought because there was a greater cause hallelujah what was the cause the cause was the things of God so even when you fight it has to be the right characteristics it can't be so you can sow I'm God's champion no and what I love about real Godly leadership amen we're gonna get back to the past defense but what I love about real Godly leadership Hallelujah you look at David amen David was a man he wasn't like his son Solomon Solomon believed in peace treaties Hallelujah he believed in peace treaties and and making agreements and and this and that no we're not going to do that we're not going to do this not David David was like if you don't do it my God's way you gonna die am I in the book Hallelujah remember label label day day because of David Neighbors whole country was protected David never asked anything David decides to come down there and says hey hey give me my man some eating drink and neighbors like who is David oh my God he didn't know he didn't know who's protecting him he didn't know that the wrath of David could come upon you and this man he he began to operate neighbor began to operate in the characteristics of his name his name meant what fool and now he said David who wouldn't get man we ain't giving nobody nothing and his wife Abigail heard about it and Abigail was like oh my God what is he doing does he not know who David is and Abigail goes into action look at the characteristics of a good woman she's protecting her fool y'all see all the sisters wanted to say Amen brother don't get mad Brothers they just agree with the word hallelujah hallelujah he wasn't a good man Hallelujah but her characteristics were to protect what was hers even though she was living in misery even though she didn't really really love the man but her vow made her a protector and now she's protecting her full husband neighbor from the Giant Killer David are you seeing the true ingredients the characteristics she didn't have to do that she could have said oh man this is my way out kill him David kill him I'm gonna go free kill him I can marry again kill him oh but no her characteristics were what mercy first Grace first isn't that God's way he will always give us grace and mercy before judgment I love that kind of God because if he give us judgment first none of us will be here because we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies but God gave us what grace and mercy hey look at Abigail Abigail goes to work her characteristics comes out the ingredients of who she is it begins to come out Hallelujah and now Church she she takes her hands maze she fixes us some food and she sends it that way and she's not even there yet she sends the food before her man that's a Godly woman right there before you even get home you smell the smell of food outside ain't none of y'all brother said amen foreign Hallelujah hallelu she's entering into his world before he even gets into the door it's true one way to get to a man is what the ingredients of food it's true we love to eat Hallelujah got to be a good cook or try to be put some effort into it but your every moment is ah let's go Chipotle uh let's go to pfj ah let's go to channels y'all hear me name all the restaurants I like but her whole goal is to satisfy that man make that man happy those are her characteristics Hallelujah she becomes one of the one of the key ingredients of characters becoming what selfless Hallelujah and being able to Hallelujah look at self and see what self is and forget about self and do for others Hallelujah because what is what is the ingredient of Christianity living for what oh sh and you can see in church Abigail she was thinking about her full husband at home and she goes and she says the food and all these things we know the story amen she says the food and all these things and David the fool gets to David what he asked for gets to him now and David's looking at all this this it was a feast David looks at it and now he's he's he's he's caught between her wrath and Grace she's like man what I asked for them came before me but he got me he got boy he got me hot once I get stirred up it's hard to stir me down but now earlier there was an anointing behind what Abigail did she gives the food and sends a message hallelu your hands made they come down then Abigail comes behind on her horse and she jumps off a horse and she bows down to David and begins to please her cases my Lord this and that don't she probably said my old dumb husband didn't know he didn't know who you are but King David we know we know who we are you know he's he's a Fool by Nature and David's like okay I'll have mercy ate that food up Abigail goes back home neighbor's drunk see his characteristics was I don't even care I didn't say something crazy to King David the Giant Killer of Nations the nation killer Hallelujah I didn't say something crazy to him and I ain't even thinking about it don't that sound like a fool coma and Abigail comes and save him save everything around Hallelujah and then she begins to tell them what happened he has a heart attack oh my when he came he came from his low miles about to die yes you were how often amen our own nature gets in the way of the nature of God church and when you think about the thing the characteristics of Balaam and how God told him say look why are you with these people I said no and now you're coming back then God said okay go ahead go ahead go ahead thus comes forth the message does God change his mind no he didn't change his mind he just got tired of Bala asking him to say more stuff so God said go ahead and in the midst of him giving Balaam his desire was what death because God was going to kill him for being disobedient be careful church that your characteristics Hallelujah who you are as a person is not leading you to your own death well brother that's just not my nature I just ain't ready to serve God well if you ain't serving God who you serving well I'm a good person are you but I ain't bothering nobody are you she's easy for us to say something about ourselves but your life will project Who You Are amen remember that right hand it just came up automatically if I threw it over there right that left hand and move one time because the characteristics of a thing it speaks to itself Hallelujah a robin a robin bird can never be an eagle they got some of the same characteristics though they fly or they have wings they have a beak they have claws Hallelujah but all the things I just named on an eagle it's a whole other level the height of his flying is a whole other level the strength of his calls is a whole another level the strength of his beak is a whole other level so though Robin has some of the same thing the eagle has it does not have the same characteristics amen it doesn't make up the same Hallelujah ingredients Church imma just throw this out there for you that's the strongest Eagle is called an African Crown eagle not these Gold Eagles not these bald eagles these things we see around here no it's called an African Crown eagle because the feathers on his head it looked like a crown and it's so strong whatever it grabs in its talents it has three thousand pounds worth of pressure wow and I've seen the videos on YouTube it go hunt baby monkeys and it grab the monkey by the skull crush it and fly on Earth it got a little stroke to crush a skull well that's heavy ain't it a robin I'll never be able to do that on its strongest day it'll never be it'll never be able to just get no way close to it Hallelujah Church in the true identity of a Christian Hallelujah the world will never be able to get there because there's things about Christ that just oozes out of that person amen back to Balaam you see church he denied the very thing God was giving him Grace with even though he had contact with God heard from God on us church we see it in the Bible all the time people hear from God looking directly at God but who they are on the inside denies him think about this church that spirit is so strong Cain was sitting there talking to God oh hearing from God having fellowship with God but when it's true character Richard started to come out none of that meant anything he lying God's face I don't know what you're talking about then he got arrogant we got am I My Brother's Keeper his ingredients start to come out and what I'm saying Church to you Hallelujah whoever you are you can say I'm bride I'm bride material but your ingredients will tell Who You Are you know uh you know there's a lot going on with what we call the message of the hour and people trying to prove this wrong and prove that wrong brother Brandon made this mistake in that mistake let me say it like this this might shock y'all I don't care my life is not resting on what kind of socks brother Brandon had on my life is not resting on whether there was a there was a a bridge or not my life is not arrested on whether he got a bear or not who cares my life is resting on whether this message Hallelujah introduces me to Christ oh my that's where we are to Rejoice because if the message brings you to Christ to live a better life without error when it comes to the word then you're walking in truth Hallelujah because that's what the message I'm supposed to do bring us back the truth and if the prophet Hollywood introduces the message to you brought you back the truth where the end of discussion I don't testify witness this message with what God did in the prophet no I witnessed it Hallelujah I witnessed this message but how I was changed thank God for the prophet thank God for his life because the things that make up the ingredients of real character one Vindication our Prophet had that Hallelujah to position he was positionally placed as a prophet in our day earlier free Hallelujah operating in the word for your age Hallelujah do we have the right ingredients for a message amen and if you can see yourself living with true Vindication Hallelujah operating in the right position Hallelujah staying with the word for your day which is the Holy Ghost because there's a lot of people speaking in tongues there's a lot of people dancing and shouting but can they stay with the word for their day the Vindicated word for that day that's the true characteristics of your hour Hallelujah that's the ingredients we are to live by amen not just amen because you could have you could have Vindication and be out of position Balaam oh my and you get Hallelujah you can be in position and not crave the promise for your day Esau cause he was a position to receive the blessing but he didn't care about the promise of the Holy Ghost he didn't care about the promise Hallelujah of that Birthright so you got to have all of it Church and again he was a better person than Jacob but what did Jacob do Jacob put himself in position Hallelujah he wasn't even the one that was supposed to get the blessing but he put himself in a position to be blessed out of here then God came what God came and Vindicated it ugly and then Jacob Hallelujah stay with the promise for his day that your seed Hallelujah will be like the stars of the Sun that came through Jacob with the 12 tribes of Israel I feel my helper coming on Hallelujah ain't God good I can't understand why people don't want to serve him God is good especially when he reveals himself that's the greatest thing we can have when God comes to you personally and reveals yourself amen when when the word of God is talking to you and to make you smile like you do in Hallelujah you know that's the spirit of God having communion with you oh you can call me crazy all you want but I like being like this see I know what God has done for me y'all know Holly Heal Me from casting my brain just to put me in position first of all that was a Vindication Hallelujah the Vindication that God Is A Healer heal me with no medication no treatment all I had was Isaiah 53 the word for my day Hallelujah the ingredients will bring out the right vindication or should I say the right characteristics oh my but before I close on y'all know I'm about to close if y'all if some of y'all don't know I might say that five more times but just remember I'm about you I'm not lying I'm about to I didn't say I was I said I'm about to but if you take Balaam and you switch it over to Moses who was in his day Moses not only did he have the Vindication he had to position also but what made them different was Moses could obey the word that God gave him Hallelujah with all his shortcomings God said Moses come back to God and he says Lord but I can't talk God said shut up Moses who made your mouth Moses say that's it for me zip you heard him complain about that no more he said let Aaron be your Prophet oh my church oh my God knows who we are so it's up to God's job Hallelujah to give us confidence did you hear me it's up to the Lord to give you confidence he has to show himself true to you is up to him to show that he's a deliverer I don't have to do that it's up to him to show that he's a savior I don't have to do that hallelujah it's up to him that shows he's a Lord amen I don't have to do that all I have to do is believe and look what he does to Moses he comes to Moses Moses shut up stop complaining let Aaron be your prophet and then he elevates Moses his whole speaking his whole characteristic he said you be God to the people and Hallelujah man you talking about getting elevated earlier Hallelujah he tell Moses shut up now I want you to be God oh my I want what you really are to come out any last element and I'm gonna move on from this but you look at how God Vindicated Moses Holly in all of his shortcomings all his crying and mistakes Moses kept coming back see to do between him and him and him and Balaam Moses kept coming back and say Lord these people you gave me what we're gonna do babe kept coming back I want this money let's kill him and God come and say Moses you're doing too much now I'm gonna put your spirit on the people on 70 men so y'all can share the burden Moses was so much like God hallelujah how he felt about the people God could take that anointing on him and put it on some other men that could help him run the church Hallelujah I hope some of you brothers are sharing brother Aaron's burden make it a little easier for him cause you know what the true sign of a real Church the characteristics of a real Church it can run just as smooth when the pastor's here and it'll run even smoother when he's not here that's the sign of a true church because it shows that the people have the spirit of God in them and they share the same burden so the pastor will have to be did you do this man go enjoy yourself and leave us alone Hallelujah I speak by experience I mean how many miles a young guy Hallelujah me and me and me and another brother in our church both of us were young ministers coming up our pastor will just leave he's just leaving call us while you're away say hey I'm gonna be out of town a couple days y'all just take care of the service like huh who does that you're the leader and you want us to just so what we would do because you know both of us were ministers both of us could do the song service you know and run to church but in that in those moments he didn't tell us what to do so who we were it was just gonna come out and what if one of us wanted to beat a great preacher you were like you do this I'm preaching tonight and what if one of us was a song we had a voice like an angel man you can't sing and let me sing I can sing see the real you gonna come out in those positions of power those times of power Hallelujah the real you gonna come out but you know we were I was more comfortable leading the song service so I was like and he was more comfortable preaching so it wasn't hard for us I was like I seen you preaching he was like you sing I preached it was over no argument Hallelujah and whenever the pastor left we didn't change that we were like oh it's my turn to preach now you preached last week no it was all about making sure Christ was on display making sure the right anointing was in the worship and the right anointing was in the preaching holy in church what I what I look back on we didn't even realize that at that time we were just doing what we were comfortable with Hallelujah yeah I could preach but I wasn't comfortable preaching so I like I can see let me see I love the scene amen let me get up there and do my job let me lead the people into some worship Hallelujah cause I love to worship God anybody like that about about 10 of you the rest of y'all better get ready cause ain't gonna be no preaching in heaven it ain't gonna be enough but hours and hours and days and days and years and years of worship ain't no man gonna come over there I got a new inspiration I got a text nope ain't gonna happen we're gonna be with the Eternal Word forever the word is going to be fully revealed ain't gonna be no more need for sermons so if you ain't worshiping now you better get on track cause I promise you if you're not a worshiper down here you won't be a worshiper up there and if you're not a worshiper up there How You Gonna Stand in his presence because God is an object of what it blows me away y'all just y'all just bear with me it blows me away doing a song service people sitting in church they'd be like we singing speaking to my heart oh my God that song my sins are gone you asked me why I'm happy is the reason why because my sins are gone how can you not sing that and I how can you sing that and not rejoice but I've seen that song be singing and people like they must don't realize their sins are gone they must don't realize the price has been paid Hallelujah you know the problem is church down here we got too much mannequin worship that's Wednesday Sunday change clothes same position and you think you're gonna be in God's presence like that oh no I ain't trying to make you jump and Shout I'm trying to prepare you Hallelujah because some of us gonna be up there I'm just saying me I'm gonna be up there acting the food so I will be out there going crazy I've made it no more problems no more trouble no more Agony No More Pain I'm In His presence forever [Applause] but think about it you can experience that down here Hallelujah because if Christ is the head of your life your problems belong to him your sickness belong to him your depression belongs to him Hallelujah it's just who he is remember the scripture says every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess in that day so that means everybody that sees him is going to worship now if you think you see him and you're gonna be able to keep your compulsion trust me if you think that I uh hello I just hate to I just hate to tell you this but if you think you're gonna be able to keep your composure in heaven you won't be there foreign Hallelujah oh my church just think about it the characteristics of this age and all that we go through all that we come through and I get that you know I see I'm already envisioning myself there you know and when I get there and I meet Paul y not just by the scriptures but now face to face because we're gonna know each other you'll be like hey D's come here Deeds you made it I'm like yeah but I made it what's going on you know we're gonna have our own handshakes and all that you know we're gonna do our thing Hallelujah no hey young people don't miss out it's gonna be a ball Hallelujah it's gonna be better than any football game any basketball game where we at Arizona he's gonna be better than the Cardinals game and everybody everybody they're gonna be taller than your quarterback that's little brothers that was a little Jab but think about it Church it's going to be something that we've been living for all this time Hallelujah and I can just see myself hardly having fellowship with Paul I'm gonna just be dancing Messiah is the king of King Messiah is a lot of laws and don't worry about it I know uh we we black we white we Latinos everything but when we get up there everybody gonna have rhythm [Applause] Hallelujah go away everybody gonna be in sync Hallelujah ain't gonna be no two four no one three we're gonna be one sounding Army it's gonna be a celebration ain't nobody gonna look odd ain't nobody gonna be off key Hallelujah we all gonna have the voices of angels [Applause] oh my God I see some of you smiling you believe that hallelujah it's gonna be a timing God let's think about it Paul because hey D you come out of you come out of ladder to see it you my angel come on up I was like yeah man we came to let it see hey Peter James John Philip Martin Timothy y'all come here hey come here you see this man right here he came out of the age when the devil was at his full strength whoa Hallelujah that's the characteristics of this Church Holy amen we're able to withstand anything the devil this house why because of the Devils at its full stream God is at his full strength in his bride Hallelujah oh my I I I got to come down to close man rolling I'm having too much of a good time Hallelujah but this is our church is supposed to be we're supposed to come and be refreshed they say oh my God it's so good but know that he's good in you it ain't just brother Diggs amen this anointing that's here you create that come up to God say what good is it for the man the preacher to be anointed and the people not to be anointed and I'm sure by now you can tell I could preach to myself but it's that much more refreshing when I got people who feel like I feel Hallelujah and if I'm saying something easy you just don't quite see yourself there yet keep coming keep believing let God work on it's his job to clean you up it's his job to give you understanding Hallelujah the bad the Bible say the battle is not yours but it's the laws see Moses Moses could just do what God tell him to do even when he didn't understand he did Moses go to God cries like Oh Lord You're a pharaoh on our back you told me to we was going to be delivered this and that he tell Moses again Moses shut up stop crying why cry to me speak see God kept reminding Moses that he was a god oh my that's what our trials are all about God's trying to remind us who we are the key element to the victory of character is what suffering oh my let me read you a quote I'm gonna get out of here oh my God let me find it oh my I sent this to you bro John I hope you got it I might have did it a little late but you know hope you got it this is in uh Sumerian Church age listen to this oh my God why does he stand by the reason he's talking about trials and stuff he said the reason is in Romans 8 17-18 if ye and if children then ask Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US think about the church the glory of God is now being revealed in US I thought God no share his glory with nobody you're right we must be the same as he is in order for God to share it it has to be with himself [Applause] that's why you can say when you see me you see the father Hallelujah that's why we'll be able to say he said make us one like make them one like We Are One oh if you abiding me and I buy to you Hallelujah she's constantly telling us church we should have the same characteristics we should have the same ingredients Oh my he said well I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him anybody suffering oh my you suffer to reign suffering is one of the key ingredients how do we get here we got here because of the cross God's suffering nobody suffered like he did but that suffering did what gave mankind the greatest Victory ever the death burial of Jesus Christ that suffering Hallelujah gave us the greatest Victory ever Hallelujah he said unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason is the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering so if you're suffering what is God doing he's perfecting your character you say everybody I ain't got no answer that's the best part that means God has to do it character is what a victory Hallelujah not a gift oh my see I could come and give you a gift but if you earn it that means something different victory not a gift a man without character cannot Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule power without character is satanic and I ain't gonna call no name but we had a man say hey we're gonna build a wall and we're going to separate the children from the from the parents love power that's satanic Hallelujah bring the people under this point government make all of them suffer Hallelujah do y'all realize Russia is almost about to a place where they got refugee camps because of this war they're going through I know this is going to be on video but Putin I don't think it's all up there because he got the same massive mannerisms of who the same character regions of who Hitler same characteristics he's so wired he keeps changing the laws that he can never be voted out he basically said I'm gonna die in office I'm sure you guys have heard about it does uh uh uh basketball player Brittany um Ghana she got nine years in jail for having I think a little tube of uh CBD oil nine years yeah and you got murderers doing the same time she ain't took no life she had she took her life but you think about it what is it all about it's all about him showing y'all can't tell me what to do I run this country and she got caught with it and she gonna do some timing the only thing that'll get her away is what the grace of God the only thing that can give up peace in that jail think about it she's locked up in a place can't even speak the language think about it the only thing can help her is the grace of God but when you got satanic leadership power without character is not fit to rule the man say 18 to 35 you automatically got to join this war did y'all know that in the Russian music um but I'm out of here I'm gone they start packing up without leaving the country this is where we are Church all the ingredients are upon the Earth now ask yourself what are you manifesting are you in manifesting the ingredients of Godly character Hallelujah are you in manifesting the ingredients of something that could be false because false don't mean that you look at it and you'll be like ah no that can't be God no it looked just like the real thing so close they didn't see the very elected if possible you look at what's going on now all these all these big these big um televangelism the ones who the big mega churches and got all these people money now they turn around and say no you ain't got to pay tithes is they got millions and now they're saying you ain't got to pay taxes you gotta get no money because they're under pressure but I'm like hey if you believe that give back all the millions YouTube line your church up give everybody back all the money you didn't talk over the years if you really believe that if it ain't just a show right Church what we believe we're gonna stand for it ain't just gonna be coming out of our mouth it's gonna have to be a life Hallelujah Moses represented the life amen not just amen opposition or just a Vindication no it was the word everything amen Jacob Hallelujah it wasn't just a Vindication amen or just a a position no amen he sought after the promises of God and I said we should become a musician I'm closing that should be our life looking for the true ingredients of character because character never fails real character because the real character of God will produce the love of God Hallelujah and the real love of God Amen amen you don't have to come you don't have to stand back here and say I got perfect love no all you will be able to feel it if you hear somebody always tell me I got perfect love I'm in a day I got perfect love [Music] how often and I read the scripture did Jesus toot his own horn he said if y'all don't believe the words that's coming out of my mouth look at the believe me for the works I do Judge Me by that he could have eaten say I'm God everybody Bow Down we didn't do that why because he wanted the people to love him the characteristics of Love real love that'll pushed through trials that are pushed through tribulations you know Church you look at how he did the church you just take you just take my Guy Peter for a second God had had to develop that character out of him because at first he was just a good churchgoer we don't want to be just good church good church we want all the ingredients of God amen let's pray [Music] Lord Jesus father we love you we thank you for your grace Lord and just being such a good God and Lord at times we can't even explain Lord different sufferings and the trials we go through Lord but we know that there's there's a purpose in everything we go through as Believers Lord if I would just pray your hand stays Upon Us Lord continue to mold and shape us Lord into the image of your mind Lord and we'll be careful to give you all the honor glory and praise in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray we pray let yours amen [Music]
