[0:00] but my title tonight is it's summertime
[0:03] it's summertime and i want to
[0:05] i just have something burdened on my
[0:07] heart it was interesting how god's dealt
[0:08] with me i had been pondering maybe
[0:10] starting a new segment on divine healing
[0:12] i'd been studying on our family tree
[0:14] studying on the seven bad habits and
[0:17] there's just a lot of things to minister
[0:18] on a lot of things to bring into our
[0:20] view but
[0:22] god just dealt with my heart in a little
[0:24] bit different way this week to where i
[0:26] was feeling that something else was in
[0:28] store and this was just the subject that
[0:30] he put on my heart it's going to be very
[0:32] very unique and so i trust that i say
[0:34] that and afterwards yeah that was just
[0:36] about as vanilla as it could be
[0:38] but for me it seems to be unique and so
[0:41] it's it's it's summertime
[0:43] and so let's just join in on this
[0:45] particular subject matter
[0:47] and i know that you probably want me to
[0:48] give you a little bit of a
[0:50] preview of what it means but i don't
[0:51] know what else to say other than it's
[0:53] summertime and i want to talk about it's
[0:55] summertime some of you may know that
[0:57] yesterday was the first day of summer i
[0:59] know that doesn't make sense to a lot of
[1:00] us who've already been in 112 degrees
[1:02] weather uh earlier this year but we it
[1:05] was the first day of summer officially
[1:06] at 5 14 a.m on june 21st
[1:10] that was the june solstice and that's
[1:12] when the sun reaches its highest
[1:15] northernmost point in the sky so called
[1:18] the summer solstice or june solstice and
[1:21] it marks the official beginning of
[1:23] summer it's called summer solstice
[1:25] because at this particular moment when
[1:27] the sun gets to that highest point in
[1:29] the northernmost point in the sky for us
[1:32] in the northern hemisphere the people in
[1:33] south africa right now saying blasphemy
[1:36] this is not true but uh it reaches its
[1:39] northernmost point in the sky it almost
[1:41] seems as if it stops so summer solstice
[1:43] it means to to to stand still is even
[1:46] the language that's used and maybe even
[1:48] seems to kind of for a moment just its
[1:50] momentum stops and it holds there
[1:52] and because of that it's the longest
[1:54] period of sunlight
[1:56] on that particular day june 21st at 5 14
[1:58] is the summer solstice it's the longest
[2:00] period of sunlight and it's the shortest
[2:02] night so if you wanted to celebrate it
[2:04] too late it's already happened it took
[2:06] place yesterday but it's the longest day
[2:08] they say and it's also the shortest
[2:10] night and i wouldn't mind if you did uh
[2:13] let your minds wonder just a tiny little
[2:15] bit not so much that it leaves the room
[2:18] but consider what summertime means to
[2:20] you
[2:21] i know that i look back and i think
[2:22] about summertime and it always had
[2:25] it was
[2:26] kind of romantic in your mind as a kid
[2:28] because you're in school and you look
[2:30] forward to that time and when you have a
[2:31] half day of class and summer starts it
[2:33] has a completely different feeling than
[2:35] any other day before even though it's
[2:37] the same weather the day before the week
[2:39] once you enter the summer it just has
[2:41] very different feelings and i know it
[2:43] have means a lot of different things to
[2:44] different people
[2:46] it depends upon your age because at
[2:47] certain ages summer means nothing it's
[2:49] no different than the spring or the fall
[2:51] it's different in different cultures
[2:53] even based upon your location summer
[2:55] means one thing for some people it means
[2:57] another for others and even occupations
[2:59] think about the different brothers in
[3:00] the church based upon their occupation
[3:02] they have busy seasons they have slow
[3:04] seasons brother albert once it starts
[3:07] getting this hot his days get earlier
[3:08] but in some ways they get shorter
[3:10] because he's got to start working when
[3:11] it's
[3:12] only 102 outside instead of 110
[3:15] and so sometimes the summer is a time
[3:17] when people slow down
[3:19] and but for others it may be the time
[3:20] when they really got to make hay and
[3:22] make their money
[3:23] now this is one way this might just be a
[3:26] really cheap way of trying to get you
[3:27] all on the same page or get a real low
[3:28] hanging amen
[3:30] but in the old english summer meant the
[3:32] hot season of the year
[3:35] and we sometimes feel like in phoenix we
[3:37] have two seasons hot and hotter
[3:39] but summer is the hot season of the year
[3:41] the warmer half of the year is how it's
[3:43] defined so kind of thinking of that
[3:44] there's a cold half or a less warm half
[3:48] and a warmer half is how it's actually
[3:50] divided we know what the four seasons
[3:52] are we won't get into all of them but
[3:54] we're looking at this one summer it says
[3:56] in psalm 74 17 speaking of god thou has
[4:00] set all the borders of the earth we use
[4:02] this in this series on borders
[4:05] barriers and boundaries thou has said
[4:06] all the boundaries the borders of the
[4:08] earth and it says of god thou hast made
[4:11] summer and winter so summer and winter
[4:14] god's divisions we could say that wow
[4:16] when the earth tilted on its axis and
[4:19] the way it was in the beginning we could
[4:20] maybe say well they would have been
[4:22] different and these are different times
[4:23] and seasons but god
[4:25] brought these divisions so it's part of
[4:26] his wisdom to have a winter to have a to
[4:29] have a spring to have a summer to have a
[4:31] fall as part of god's plan it's part of
[4:33] god's wisdom to manifest himself the
[4:36] very beginning in genesis chapter 1
[4:38] verses 14 and 15 he says and god said
[4:41] let there be lights in the firmament of
[4:44] the heaven too so he's going to put
[4:46] lights there but what is it there for to
[4:48] divide the day from the night and to let
[4:51] them be for signs and for seasons and
[4:54] for days and years that's what the the
[4:56] moon is for that's what the sun is for
[4:58] that's what the stars are for is to
[5:00] divide day from night and for signs and
[5:02] for seasons days and years and the word
[5:05] their season means appointed time it's
[5:07] actually the same word that's used in
[5:09] tent of meetings so it's a fixed place
[5:11] for a specific purpose and a specific
[5:13] reason it's a fixed time that's what
[5:15] seasons are
[5:16] in psalms 104 verse 19 it says he
[5:19] appointed the moon for seasons the sun
[5:22] knoweth his going down so he's appointed
[5:25] the moon here the word is speaking of
[5:26] the lunar cycle it's the means of
[5:28] measuring months it's a lunar calendar
[5:30] that the hebrews used we'll go into that
[5:32] here in a little bit but he says he
[5:33] appointed the moon for seasons that
[5:35] based upon the cycle of the moon and
[5:37] from the full moon to waxing and waning
[5:40] and all the different words they use in
[5:41] the country for moons if you read your
[5:43] almanac it's to tell us what time it is
[5:45] and what season it is and it's appointed
[5:48] the moon for seasons it's all a part of
[5:50] god's expressing himself and his
[5:52] character
[5:54] in the message the super sign he says i
[5:55] want you to notice the unchanging
[5:57] continuity of god's word and his works
[6:00] see he never changes his program he
[6:03] never changes his ways just as perfectly
[6:05] the scripture is in perfect continuity
[6:08] everything that god does is in
[6:09] continuity with what he's done
[6:12] and what he did first he'll do it the
[6:14] second time the same way
[6:15] so he's talking about god's unchanging
[6:17] nature his infallibility the way he does
[6:19] thing at one time he can do he does it
[6:22] that way again and he says just to prove
[6:24] it to you he's made laws in the earth so
[6:27] the laws of nature what they call mother
[6:29] nature is the nature of god what they
[6:30] call about the law of gravity and all
[6:32] these things these are laws of god that
[6:34] he's built into his creation for purpose
[6:36] and it's part of his unchanging ways
[6:39] he says to prove it to you he's made
[6:41] laws in the earth and so he starts to
[6:43] amplify these laws of nature and he has
[6:46] always given his people a sign before
[6:48] the event happens now he's always done
[6:50] it and he will always do it because he
[6:52] is the unchangeable god i am god he said
[6:55] i changed not
[6:56] the way he sets his program at the
[6:58] beginning that's the way it is in each
[7:00] age he never changes it now notice the
[7:03] example he gives here when he put the
[7:05] world to turn on a 24-hour basis we
[7:07] might have daylight savings times and
[7:09] all kinds of times but it never changes
[7:12] the turning of the world
[7:14] so man could try to divide the days
[7:15] divide the years say well there's so
[7:17] many days in a year and there's so many
[7:18] days in a month and and there's a
[7:20] different ways of trying to calculate
[7:22] and give measurements i think one of the
[7:24] the um funnest ones is when a woman says
[7:27] that she's pregnant for 40 weeks
[7:29] therefore pregnancy is actually 10
[7:31] months not nine have you ever heard that
[7:33] argument before
[7:34] you'll find that some people it's almost
[7:35] as if they have an epiphany that wait a
[7:37] minute it's full term is 40 weeks
[7:39] there's four weeks in a month i'm
[7:40] actually pregnant for 10 months it's
[7:42] like no no matter how you slice it or
[7:43] dice it
[7:44] there's more than four weeks in a month
[7:46] except for the month of february so it
[7:48] doesn't quite work out that way it still
[7:50] works out to
[7:51] nine months i hope nobody was
[7:53] subscribing to the 10 month
[7:56] cycle but it's no matter how you define
[7:59] it or how you slice it
[8:00] god has a way of he put it in place the
[8:03] 24-hour day or that cycle of day and
[8:05] night is the institute in genesis 1.
[8:08] so he says that
[8:10] she makes her complete cycle every 24
[8:12] hours turns around
[8:14] never changes the seasons god has spring
[8:17] summer winter just exactly like it
[8:19] always was man can't change that though
[8:21] he's trying really really hard god has
[8:23] seasons and it's just it's built into
[8:25] the way that the sun uh turns uh uh
[8:28] turns a full cycle it's built in the way
[8:30] that it rotates around the sun and it's
[8:32] uh orbiting the sun there's all these
[8:34] different ways that god in his wisdom
[8:36] has built this so that's the way he done
[8:38] it first that's the way he does it every
[8:39] time
[8:40] the continuity of his laws and of his
[8:42] word and of his works how it just all
[8:45] perfectly blends together
[8:47] therefore if we could look at what was
[8:49] we can know what is and what will be you
[8:51] can base your thoughts upon that for the
[8:53] scripture says he's the same yesterday
[8:54] today and forever just so many good
[8:56] teaching points in this
[8:58] he says we notice before springtime
[9:00] comes watch some of his laws
[9:02] when you see the trees putting forth
[9:05] buds you know that summer is nigh so
[9:08] jesus refers to here when the fig tree
[9:10] puts forth this bud then you know these
[9:11] things are nice we read it here that
[9:13] when they now shoot forth you see and
[9:16] know of your own selves that summer is
[9:17] now nigh at hand when this blooming is
[9:20] taking place you know that summer is
[9:22] coming
[9:23] and he's using this scripture to talk
[9:24] about the laws of god the continuity of
[9:27] god in that is expressed in nature he
[9:29] says springtime
[9:31] is a sign of the introduction of summer
[9:34] coming on he's placing it in here to
[9:38] recognize that spring has a specific
[9:40] purpose and time
[9:42] and then in that it's signaling what is
[9:44] next it's telling you what's next if you
[9:46] know what season you're in and what the
[9:47] signs are then it's signifying not only
[9:50] is it springtime but it's also
[9:51] signifying that another season is coming
[9:54] so it's the introduction of summer
[9:56] coming on he says that's a law it always
[9:59] happens that way
[10:00] you don't have summer then about the
[10:02] time it gets winter then the leaves come
[10:04] on no you have the leaves first because
[10:07] it's an introduction of his laws of
[10:09] nature that springtime is coming it
[10:12] never fails when you see the trees begin
[10:14] to get tender around on the bark and
[10:15] little buds begin to swell you know that
[10:17] it's a sign that springtime is here it's
[10:20] coming in
[10:21] and it continues for the next several
[10:22] paragraphs to amplify different
[10:24] attributes of springtime even begins to
[10:26] use the example of migration that
[10:28] whenever
[10:29] that summertime comes on then the the
[10:32] the
[10:32] those birds that have migrated to the
[10:34] south during the winter know it's time
[10:36] to head north and begin to migrate north
[10:38] in different places he uses examples in
[10:40] florida and other areas where that time
[10:43] comes and it's a signal in nature for
[10:45] migration for change for something to
[10:47] come forth
[10:48] and then in paragraph 37 as i read this
[10:50] it says then the spring when it's nice
[10:52] and warm down here through the winter
[10:54] he'll go right straight back again
[10:55] talking about those ducks and those
[10:57] geese he says why it's nature displaying
[11:00] itself it's the laws of god
[11:02] so it is nature mother nature being
[11:04] expressed and things being made known
[11:07] but it's actually laws of god that are
[11:09] on display something about the nature of
[11:11] god and the character of god
[11:13] and ecclesiastes chapter 3 verses 1 to 2
[11:17] it says to everything there is a season
[11:19] and a time to every purpose under the
[11:21] heaven
[11:22] time to be born and a time to die a time
[11:24] to plant and a time to pluck up that
[11:27] which is planted when i read that it's
[11:29] kind of like the the hidden season is if
[11:31] you plant it and then you pluck it
[11:32] there's a season in which it grows
[11:35] but it's saying that there's a time to
[11:37] everything there is a season we know
[11:38] there's many other things he talks about
[11:40] here time to so it says a time to die
[11:42] time to be born a time to die a time to
[11:44] cry time to rejoice but there's a season
[11:46] for everything and there's a purpose a
[11:50] time to every purpose under the heaven
[11:54] and i believe that there is a season and
[11:56] a purpose as it even relates to the
[11:58] seasons as he says here a time to plant
[12:00] and a time to pluck up that which is
[12:02] planted there is a purpose to these
[12:04] things
[12:05] and this is uh it's a subject you could
[12:08] just kind of get into and you begin to
[12:09] talk about in a very logical scientific
[12:11] way and i think you could make a lot of
[12:13] applicable points and a lot of things
[12:14] that we could refresh to our minds and
[12:16] fellowship around
[12:17] but if you don't know which season has
[12:19] come you don't know what season you're
[12:20] in then you're not going to make
[12:22] it take advantage of the season
[12:25] one thing that's remarkable to me is
[12:26] there's all sorts of times you think all
[12:28] springtime that's the time to plant but
[12:30] you know there's some plants you don't
[12:31] plant in the springtime
[12:33] and there's some things that you would
[12:34] never oh you can't do this then and you
[12:36] can't do that then you got to wait for
[12:37] this you got to wait for that and so you
[12:39] got to know what you're planting and you
[12:41] need to know the season in which it
[12:42] needs to be planted and if you don't
[12:44] know the season you're in you won't take
[12:46] advantage of that season and the worst
[12:48] part is each season leads into the next
[12:51] so if you don't take advantage of a
[12:53] planting time then you can't take
[12:55] advantage of the growing time and you'll
[12:57] never make it to the plucking time or
[12:59] the harvesting time so you've got to
[13:01] know the season you're in to take
[13:03] advantage of the season you're in and if
[13:05] you take advantage of the season you're
[13:07] in it prepares you for the next
[13:09] springtime planting and putting in the
[13:11] hard work and plowing and sowing and
[13:13] spring cleaning and all the things we
[13:15] can think about in terms of the spring
[13:17] ensures that you can do take advantage
[13:19] of the summer time when things are
[13:21] growing
[13:22] i could even say this for kids in school
[13:24] that if you do your schoolwork in the
[13:26] spring you do your schoolwork in that
[13:27] second semester and you get it all done
[13:30] then you can take time in the summer to
[13:31] enjoy enjoy summer vacation
[13:34] and my when i was in school if you
[13:36] failed you'd have to go to summer school
[13:38] and by god's grace i never had to go to
[13:39] summer school
[13:41] but there's some that do that they don't
[13:42] take care of what they need to during
[13:44] the school year and they're left going
[13:46] taking classes in the summer why they
[13:48] didn't take advantage of the season that
[13:50] they had to apply themselves and these
[13:52] are the things that are part of god's
[13:54] plan part of the laws that are in the
[13:55] earth and things that are reflective for
[13:58] us
[13:59] many different places where these times
[14:00] and seasons are mentioned one that stood
[14:02] out to me today when i was reading this
[14:04] is in daniel chapter 2
[14:07] verses 20 to 22. daniel answered and
[14:09] said blessed be the name of god forever
[14:11] and ever for wisdom and might are his
[14:14] and he changeth the times and the
[14:17] seasons this is what brother branham is
[14:19] saying it never changes the seasons god
[14:20] has spring summer winter just exactly
[14:22] like it always was man could change the
[14:24] names man could bury his head in the
[14:26] sand and pretend it don't exist but god
[14:28] is the one that changes the times he's
[14:31] the one that changes the seasons he
[14:33] removeth kings and setteth up kings he
[14:35] giveth wisdom unto the wise and
[14:37] knowledge to them that no understanding
[14:38] he revealeth the deep and secret things
[14:41] he knoweth what is in the darkness and
[14:43] light dwelleth with him
[14:46] i want you to connect the uh the lane
[14:49] out of seasons whether it be winter
[14:50] spring summer fall or however order
[14:52] you'd want to place it in in terms of
[14:54] where you begin but the seasons are part
[14:56] of god's wisdom it is part of his
[14:59] character
[15:00] because it's even in the seasons it's
[15:02] telling the story of redemption
[15:04] from the from the spring to the summer
[15:07] to a winter or to the harvest again to
[15:10] go into the ground again in the fall
[15:12] brother the winter brother says it's
[15:13] telling the story of redemption he even
[15:15] just takes the cycle of a day and says
[15:17] it's the story of redemption
[15:19] in the 24-hour day then he takes the
[15:21] seasons and it's testifying of what
[15:23] death burial and resurrection so even in
[15:26] nature these laws of nature they're
[15:28] signifying part of god's mind and his
[15:30] plan
[15:31] and his nature testifying of redemption
[15:33] he put it there in the sign in the
[15:34] heavens to divide the day for night and
[15:36] for seasons for days and years and for
[15:38] signs telling the story of death burial
[15:41] and resurrection
[15:43] that's what's embodied in these seasons
[15:46] and we know these seasons have different
[15:47] characteristics and having different
[15:49] characteristics we need to
[15:51] capitalize on maybe that springtime to
[15:54] plant the seed where it can germinate at
[15:56] just the right temperature
[15:57] and i'm always amazed at just uh
[15:59] all the wisdom of god that's in the seed
[16:02] and in the ground and in the way that
[16:03] god has created the earth such that it's
[16:06] just the right temperature for that seed
[16:08] to go in the ground and germinate
[16:10] that's why some plants aren't indigenous
[16:12] or can't grow in these regions like they
[16:14] could in others because it's a
[16:15] characteristic of the seed it's a
[16:17] characteristic of the ground it's the
[16:18] characteristic of the environment
[16:20] and it just reaches that right spot
[16:22] where things can germinate and begin to
[16:24] bloom and begin to grow so seasons have
[16:26] different and and sometimes very vastly
[16:29] different and distinct characteristics
[16:30] for a reason
[16:32] there's a reason for the season and
[16:34] we're not preaching christmas either
[16:36] there are reasons for the seasons
[16:39] and brother graham says and things that
[16:40] are to be and and this is where i think
[16:43] this is maybe where the unique part
[16:44] comes from me
[16:46] because i just felt impressed to
[16:48] to just talk about the heat here in
[16:49] phoenix for a while
[16:51] but the message things are to be brother
[16:52] branham says i believe that god is a god
[16:54] of variety the world proves that he's
[16:57] got big mountains and little mountains
[16:59] he's got planes he's got deserts amen
[17:02] he's got different things because that
[17:03] was my amen he's got different things
[17:05] because he made it the way he wanted it
[17:08] and he made the season summer winter
[17:10] spring autumn he made the seasons
[17:14] it shows he's a god of variety so this
[17:16] is god part of god's character he's a
[17:18] god of variety he makes mountains how
[17:19] many here like mountains
[17:21] i mean here like little mountains
[17:23] like big mountains and he says he's got
[17:24] planes anybody here like the plains and
[17:26] preferred over the mountains
[17:27] and then he says he's got deserts who
[17:29] here prefers the desert over the plains
[17:31] and over the mountains but he says he's
[17:33] got different ones and he even made the
[17:35] seasons for the deserts for the
[17:36] mountains and for the plains summer
[17:38] winter spring
[17:39] and fall and those of us maybe if you
[17:42] were born here raised here and lived
[17:43] here there are differences among winter
[17:46] and spring and autumn
[17:48] and summer in other parts of this great
[17:51] country and the world
[17:52] but these things are varied because it's
[17:54] part of god's nature he said he made you
[17:57] in a variety i really like this
[17:59] statement he says some men are real
[18:00] blusterous
[18:02] and some are real dogmatic and others
[18:04] are fine
[18:05] i don't know what he means by that the
[18:07] blesterous and dogmatic are not fine i
[18:09] don't know if he's talking about looks i
[18:10] think he's talking about people who are
[18:11] just they're good people he says others
[18:13] are kind
[18:15] and he says and you just find all
[18:17] different kinds of people and in his
[18:19] kingdom
[18:20] i i take it that maybe is he referring
[18:22] to the blusterous and dogmatic that are
[18:24] in god's kingdom he says god makes them
[18:26] all this way they're just
[18:28] dogmatic others are fine others are kind
[18:30] i'd want to be of the fine and kind
[18:32] believe it was brother obed was wearing
[18:34] the shirt the other night they said it's
[18:35] cool to be kind and it had my approval
[18:38] it's cool to be kind
[18:40] i'd say it's probably cool to be fine
[18:42] too because it's just f you find all
[18:44] different kinds of people and they're in
[18:46] his kingdom
[18:47] so as much as we might want to lament
[18:49] the summer time like this is just of the
[18:51] devil and the mountains are where god
[18:53] dwells and the planes are real the real
[18:54] beauty of god can be same he made all of
[18:57] it
[18:58] and he made it for a reason
[19:00] now i'd like to come to a subject that
[19:01] is very precious to all of us here
[19:04] and we're all living in it by experience
[19:06] and so this is where again we could just
[19:07] really enter in
[19:09] and be of one mind and one of corbett i
[19:11] want to talk about summertime in phoenix
[19:14] and for those of us those of you who are
[19:15] here from tucson and flagstaff you just
[19:18] carry with us a little bit and think
[19:19] about summertime in phoenix it's a hot
[19:22] time
[19:23] really hot time even so much so to where
[19:25] because of the air conditioning systems
[19:27] here i'm thinking that maybe we can't
[19:28] have evening services during the summer
[19:30] as much i'd like to have them because
[19:32] the ac unit just can't keep up with it
[19:34] it's a hot time and guess what some love
[19:37] it
[19:38] see it wasn't completely quiet at that
[19:40] point nobody laid out on me nobody said
[19:43] i don't think so brother aaron some
[19:44] people love it others hate it
[19:48] and i think the biggest part of our
[19:50] summers is what i call the war of
[19:51] attrition
[19:52] because the sister elizabeth even took
[19:54] time here recently to study the
[19:55] temperatures and i think even they
[19:56] report this that historically the
[19:58] hottest temperatures of the year on
[20:01] average are usually the last week of
[20:02] june and so you've pretty much hit your
[20:05] peak here as far as high temperatures
[20:07] average temperatures at the at the end
[20:09] of june and we all think praise the lord
[20:10] isn't that awesome well it just means it
[20:12] doesn't really on average get hotter
[20:15] but it doesn't necessarily mean that
[20:16] temperatures are dropping back down in
[20:18] the 50s anytime soon and so what it
[20:20] becomes is a war of attrition
[20:22] in other words the earlier it gets hot
[20:24] you're like hey 105 that ain't bad and i
[20:26] think 105 ain't that bad
[20:28] even 110 in the shade you wouldn't even
[20:30] really know it
[20:32] but it's after 110 days of 110
[20:37] or 100 something straight days with no
[20:39] relief never breaking out of three-digit
[20:41] temperature it kind of becomes a war of
[20:43] attrition to where after a while even if
[20:45] you can hack it you're like i want
[20:46] something different
[20:49] and so this is kind of what we usually
[20:51] set ourselves up for in the summer
[20:53] and so when i said at summer time nobody
[20:55] here was kind of saying yes all right
[20:58] yeah we love this
[20:59] and brother branham may even validate
[21:01] this or maybe giving some people some
[21:02] really good ammunition but in the hidden
[21:04] life with christ brother bram says i'd
[21:05] rather have it cold than hot though
[21:08] thank you for not getting too riled up
[21:10] and
[21:11] breaking into dance he says i can't
[21:13] stand hot weather never did like hot
[21:15] weather and so this is someone his
[21:17] preference some may say that's thus
[21:19] saith the lord and it's god speaking but
[21:21] he said i'd rather have it cold than hot
[21:23] though i can't stand hot weather never
[21:25] did like hot weather
[21:27] that's his
[21:28] that's his preference god has a variety
[21:31] he's got deserts he's got planes he's
[21:32] got mountains big mountains
[21:34] even when it comes to fishing i love to
[21:36] bass fish but to a fly fisherman
[21:39] trout i am the lowest of all lows
[21:42] as a bass fisherman because god's got a
[21:44] variety even in hobbies and things that
[21:45] people like but it says i'd rather have
[21:47] it cold than hot
[21:48] and then in the message and thy seed
[21:50] shall possess the gate of his enemies
[21:51] he's speaking about phoenix he says they
[21:53] hear that somebody tells me and this is
[21:55] a quote when it rains in phoenix
[21:57] everybody just stays in bed
[22:00] and he says such a change you know that
[22:02] the same they had back then in 62 even
[22:04] then if it rains in phoenix everyone
[22:06] stays in bed he says one of these days
[22:08] i'm gonna going to get a free meal
[22:11] they tell me you can have a free meal
[22:13] every day the sun don't shine i'm going
[22:15] to watch it today make them pay off for
[22:17] that
[22:18] and so that's true phoenix has one of
[22:20] the highest the greatest number of days
[22:23] of sunshine in the earth second only to
[22:25] yuma and so arizona has the most days of
[22:28] sunlight
[22:29] of any state in the union uh and he's
[22:32] saying hey if it does the sun doesn't
[22:34] show itself today then you get a free
[22:35] meal and the other kind of the other
[22:37] saying is when it rains in phoenix
[22:38] everybody just stays in bed because
[22:40] that's the gloom the doom i guess and
[22:41] it's i think what you really want to do
[22:43] is open up the windows and smell that
[22:44] creosote and that desert come alive and
[22:46] just enjoy it because you don't get any
[22:48] snow days here
[22:49] so if you get a rain day they cancel the
[22:51] buses
[22:52] i remember my grandma she was born and
[22:54] raised in the u.p she's a hooper there
[22:56] in uh escanaba gladstone michigan
[23:00] all year long the the residents there in
[23:02] the u.p look forward to summer
[23:04] and it's something that they all do you
[23:06] go through those hard winters in spring
[23:08] it's still cold the ice is not breaking
[23:10] up till june on the lakes and they say
[23:11] that they look forward to sun to
[23:14] summer all year and if it falls on a
[23:16] sunday they'll hold a picnic
[23:20] i mean it only lasts one day
[23:24] all right moving on
[23:26] in the message why brother braham says
[23:28] we live in tucson why no he he's not
[23:31] asking the question about that he says
[23:33] we live in tucson arizona now and he
[23:35] says it's been awfully hot out there
[23:38] and i read this one this one i picked
[23:39] for a reason it's awfully hot out there
[23:41] in tucson he says but
[23:43] we find that it's a little bit hotter
[23:45] here at home than it was out there
[23:47] see
[23:48] it may be hot here but it's hotter there
[23:51] may be hot here in phoenix but it's
[23:52] hotter back east it's hotter in
[23:54] jeffersonville hotter in hot springs he
[23:56] says because of the tremendous humidity
[23:59] can we get an amen to that
[24:01] maybe hot in phoenix but i'd rather have
[24:03] 104 in phoenix than 86 in newton north
[24:05] carolina
[24:08] why because of the tremendous humidity
[24:11] it's a little bit hotter out in the east
[24:12] he says and it kind of puts us down he's
[24:14] talking about himself how they kind of
[24:15] acclimated to the tucson weather kind of
[24:17] puts us down after getting kind of used
[24:19] to the air out there why because it's a
[24:21] dry heat
[24:23] i we were talking about uh well uh
[24:26] housewarming gifts and welcoming gifts
[24:28] to people who moved from the east here
[24:29] and we thought a humidifier
[24:31] would be in order the bloody noses that
[24:33] seem to pop themselves up to somebody
[24:35] moving here for the first time
[24:37] so there's a pro tip for anybody
[24:38] listening humidifiers
[24:40] when you come
[24:42] now he makes a statement
[24:44] and this is a little bit on a different
[24:45] line
[24:47] i was studying the weather but i was
[24:48] doing it in the message
[24:50] and the great coming revival and
[24:52] outpouring of the holy spirit that's the
[24:53] title he says you talk about this hot
[24:55] weather
[24:56] this is hot
[24:58] he says he predicts that there'd be a
[24:59] time in the bible where men will even
[25:01] dig holes in the ground trying to get
[25:04] into it to hide themselves from the heat
[25:06] she would think this is bad stick around
[25:08] for the tribulation
[25:09] says people are trying to be digging
[25:11] holes in the ground to try to escape the
[25:12] heat and then he transitions to this he
[25:14] says standing not long ago in phoenix
[25:15] arizona when the chief of police there
[25:18] we'd been out on a little hog hunt out
[25:19] in the wilderness for a couple days of
[25:20] rest
[25:21] stand there he said brother branham i
[25:23] don't understand when i was just a boy
[25:25] phoenix would be green along in march it
[25:28] don't get green all year now unless it's
[25:30] where it's there's irrigation you have
[25:32] to go plumb onto flagstaff somewhere
[25:35] to get green in march
[25:37] they talk about water shortages brother
[25:39] around in these different places i read
[25:40] we're talking about rivers drying up
[25:42] lakes drying up and even then
[25:44] they were they had great consternation
[25:46] about the water supply
[25:48] where they're going to get water from
[25:49] and things drying up and the drought
[25:51] even the bible talks about the drought
[25:53] of summer
[25:54] and you think this is hot there's a
[25:55] hotter time coming
[25:57] there's a hotter day coming and he says
[25:59] even in 1954 how the chief of police is
[26:02] recognizing that it doesn't even get as
[26:04] green as it used to unless they're
[26:06] bringing in water from somewhere else
[26:07] and bringing in irrigation he says you
[26:09] have to go further out some other place
[26:11] to find the areas where it's green
[26:14] that's the summer time for us
[26:16] that's the time that we're living and
[26:18] now that everybody's just as pleased as
[26:20] punch and happy tonight to think about
[26:22] where we live
[26:23] let's think about summer in a little bit
[26:24] different light
[26:26] in exodus chapter 12 verses 1 to 2
[26:30] it says the lord spake unto moses and
[26:32] aaron in the land of egypt saying i know
[26:34] you all recognize this chapter of the
[26:36] bible it's when the exodus is on
[26:40] exodus chapter 12 they're going to be
[26:41] given the instructions on the passover
[26:43] there's going to be an exodus of the
[26:45] children of israel is this month shall
[26:47] be unto you
[26:49] the beginning of months it shall be the
[26:51] first month
[26:53] of the year to you god was throwing away
[26:55] the old calendar
[26:56] and giving him a new one and on this new
[26:59] moon at the exact time when this new
[27:00] moon would be expressing itself
[27:02] it started a new calendar a new way of
[27:04] keeping time a new way of keeping
[27:06] seasons
[27:07] and under in their bondage and i guess
[27:09] you could even say that just kind of
[27:11] according to the tradition of the world
[27:12] and how man would keep time instead of
[27:14] using the solar tradition of the god of
[27:16] ra the god of the egyptians that would
[27:18] be done away with and now they would
[27:20] actually adopt the moon in order to
[27:22] calculate months i'm not going to do it
[27:24] the egyptian way anymore raw the sun god
[27:26] we're not going to do it that way
[27:27] anymore but now there's going to be a
[27:28] beginning of months the jews and the
[27:30] children of israel are going to look to
[27:31] a different sign to regulate their days
[27:33] to regulate their seasons and to
[27:34] regulate their months
[27:36] and so the hebrew calendar is different
[27:38] from the gregorian or even what the
[27:39] julian was uh different from a solar
[27:42] calendar and actually this is really
[27:44] helpful when you begin to look at feast
[27:45] days or things in the bible and even the
[27:47] times of the crucifixion they talk about
[27:49] the evening time
[27:50] a day begins with the sun going down
[27:54] that's what how a day begins to a hebrew
[27:56] so the moon and its phases
[27:58] clock
[27:59] for the months and for the seasons and
[28:01] for the appointed time or for the feast
[28:03] they're all timed around
[28:05] the moon
[28:07] and even the days that they have been
[28:09] given the days that are given or the
[28:11] names that are given to the calendar
[28:12] jewish calendar were instituted in the
[28:14] time of ezra but this jewish year is a
[28:17] cycle with holidays and festivals and
[28:19] different seasons
[28:21] to a jew to the hebrew their spring
[28:24] contains different months what they
[28:26] would call their springtime it's march
[28:28] april and part of may
[28:30] for them and then their summer is may
[28:33] june july august and sometime part of
[28:36] september
[28:37] and they have spring feast and they have
[28:39] fall feasts and they have one feast that
[28:41] kind of comes just right at the
[28:43] beginning of the summer there's ways
[28:44] that they divide them up to where
[28:45] there's ones that are just spring and
[28:46] ones that are in fall spring and harvest
[28:49] but there's one that kind of marks
[28:51] itself at the beginning of summer for
[28:53] israel and it's called the feast of
[28:55] weeks
[28:56] shavuot
[28:57] is the is the word the feast of which
[28:59] what meaning seven weeks
[29:01] in leviticus chapter 23 15 to 16 it says
[29:04] you shall come you shall count unto you
[29:06] from the morrow after the sabbath
[29:08] from the day that ye brought the sheaf
[29:11] of the wave offering
[29:12] seven sabbath shall be complete so there
[29:14] was the sheaf of a wave offering
[29:17] in that that festival and then there's
[29:19] seven sabbaths that are going to be
[29:21] complete even unto the moral after the
[29:23] seventh sabbath so not after seven weeks
[29:25] and 49 days but on the 50th day shall
[29:27] you
[29:28] show you a number on the mark the 7th
[29:31] sabbath shall you number 50 days and you
[29:33] shall offer a new meal meat offering
[29:36] a meal offering meat offering unto the
[29:39] lord so this scripture is where they
[29:41] count the seventh sabbath and the day
[29:43] following the 50 days it's celebrated
[29:45] seven weeks in a day after the passover
[29:48] and it's called the feast of weeks
[29:51] shavuot or the feast of pentecost that
[29:55] would be the greek or the latin because
[29:56] it means 50. and that's where we get
[29:58] pentecost from is this feast of weeks
[30:01] and this feast of weeks i just want to
[30:03] settle on it for just a little bit it's
[30:04] just after eight o'clock i don't plan on
[30:06] being very long we've already passed the
[30:08] longest day of the year and so things
[30:10] are just getting shorter already
[30:11] but it's it marks the culmination
[30:15] to it to the israelite to the hebrews
[30:17] this summer feast this feast that comes
[30:19] at this transition time this summer time
[30:21] it marks the culmination of israel's
[30:23] exodus from egypt which begins at the
[30:25] feast of the passover and that if you
[30:28] count the seven weeks and the day it's
[30:30] at a time of the giving of the law at
[30:32] mount sinai that's an incredible event
[30:34] for to hebrew
[30:36] to an israelite is what begins in the
[30:38] feast of the passover then 50 days later
[30:40] is climax and cometing at the base of
[30:42] this mountain moses up on a mountaintop
[30:44] god giving the law
[30:46] and this is what's significant about
[30:48] this early this late spring or this
[30:50] early summer feast
[30:52] and this is i just want to mention this
[30:54] that to the hebrews as i studied this
[30:57] they actually called this season a
[30:58] season of liberation
[31:00] because it's their exodus from egypt
[31:03] it's their release from bondage and to
[31:05] them it commemorates
[31:06] season of liberation
[31:08] and one of the things i've been
[31:09] pondering quite frequently lately with
[31:11] the series on our family tree
[31:13] originally the it was going to be a free
[31:15] family was the thought that i had
[31:17] because i it means more to me today my
[31:20] liberty in christ continues to me more
[31:22] to me today than it ever has before
[31:25] and the things that god liberates his
[31:27] children from you can be free from sin
[31:28] free from death but you can still have
[31:30] hooks of of legalism you can have hooks
[31:32] of politics and hooks of personality and
[31:35] a lot of things that we just learn along
[31:37] the way that really don't have anything
[31:38] to do with the message it's just some
[31:40] sort of
[31:41] bent or slant that kind of attaches
[31:43] itself onto it but it's so beautiful to
[31:45] be free
[31:46] from judgments and thought processes and
[31:48] condemnations and always trying to
[31:50] compare yourself or always trying to
[31:51] make yourself feel right and how do i
[31:53] fit in it's so beautiful to be free
[31:57] that's what this summer time can mean
[31:59] for maybe a lot of the young people is
[32:01] once it's summer you're free from school
[32:03] and school's out this is wonderful and
[32:04] free i'm free and that's exactly what
[32:07] summertime would mean to a hebrew is
[32:09] liberty and freedom
[32:11] it's also the opening of the harvest
[32:13] season for israel summertime
[32:15] is the opening of a harvest season
[32:18] in exodus chapter 34 versus verse 22 and
[32:21] thou shalt observe the feast of weeks
[32:24] shavuot that's the feast of weeks the
[32:26] feast of pentecost of the first fruits
[32:28] of wheat offering and those things are
[32:30] combined together so they're kind of
[32:31] added to it
[32:32] and it is a
[32:34] it's different from
[32:36] the wave sheath of that first barley
[32:38] grain so this is a different one the
[32:40] feast of weeks joined with the first
[32:42] fruits of the wheat harvest not barley
[32:44] but the wheat that may mean something to
[32:46] a few who recognize those distinctions
[32:48] in the wave offerings and it says and
[32:50] the feast of inn gathering at the year's
[32:52] end which is the feast of tabernacles
[32:54] and so they're told you're to observe
[32:56] these things observe the feast of weeks
[32:58] and the first fruits of the week
[32:59] together observe them why because it
[33:02] memorializes something that god had done
[33:05] to them this summertime feast was an
[33:08] opportunity to reflect in these moments
[33:10] and in these feast days on what god had
[33:12] done for them they even looked at it in
[33:13] terms of god sinning and delivered the
[33:15] paces of the plagues the the passover
[33:18] night the leaving and crossing the red
[33:20] sea and ultimately finding themselves at
[33:22] the base of mount sinai and god
[33:24] thundering out and speaking from this
[33:25] mountain and giving the law to moses
[33:28] they look at this that's the culmination
[33:29] of redemption to them
[33:31] and we could say certainly that would be
[33:33] the climax of the coming out of but
[33:35] there was also a coming in too but it
[33:38] spoke to redemption this season
[33:40] the azereth pasek
[33:42] means that to them it's the gathering
[33:44] rally of passover that's what this
[33:46] summertime feast would mean this atsuret
[33:48] tasak is the gathering rally of the
[33:51] passover so you have the feast of
[33:53] passover you're all with me tonight
[33:56] i'm glad to be preaching to real jews
[33:58] but they have the the feast of the
[34:00] passover but then they called this
[34:02] evil if you want to look at it and type
[34:04] the gathering at mount sinai but this
[34:05] coming together at the feast of
[34:06] pentecost or the feast of weeks this is
[34:08] something that all males were required
[34:10] healthy meals were required to gather
[34:11] together in jerusalem for and this when
[34:14] they came together just as they would
[34:15] have been at the base of mount sinai
[34:17] later on in the evolution of the temple
[34:19] they would all come together and they'd
[34:20] gather together they'd call it the
[34:21] gathering rally the passover in other
[34:23] words it's what the passover was leading
[34:25] to
[34:27] they had the passover but it wasn't just
[34:29] in itself just a passover but this is
[34:31] what it led to so many consider the
[34:33] shavuot on mount sinai as the birth of
[34:36] judaism
[34:37] it was at that moment at that time at
[34:40] that mountain when god gave the law when
[34:42] god gave the law and they received the
[34:44] law from moses they said this is when we
[34:46] were born as a nation this is when we
[34:48] were born not not so much as a nation
[34:50] but a nation under god this is when we
[34:53] became his cherished people whom he had
[34:55] redeemed out of the land of egypt
[34:57] because now all those sons of abraham
[34:59] have materialized the seed of abraham
[35:01] the prophecies to abraham how his people
[35:03] would soldier in a strange land now
[35:04] they're carrying the very bones of
[35:06] joseph's bones they're coming out of out
[35:08] of egypt and they're bringing him to the
[35:10] base of mount sinai and god
[35:12] sees the law it's in that moment that
[35:14] they believe that they have been birthed
[35:17] as jews as judaism their religion when
[35:19] the law came forth
[35:21] that's when they were born
[35:24] that was at the feast of weeks
[35:26] but it's also called the feast of
[35:28] pentecost
[35:30] so christ we know is crucified at the
[35:31] time of the passover
[35:33] and then it is a time of a planting of a
[35:36] seed there's even a resurrection and
[35:37] life begins to come forth but then you
[35:39] count the seven days and then you come
[35:41] to the 50th day and it says in acts
[35:43] chapter 2 verses 1 to 4 and when the day
[35:45] of pentecost was fully come
[35:48] the day of shavuot the day of the feast
[35:50] of weeks was fully come now the
[35:52] disciples are in that place where christ
[35:54] called them to told them to tarry until
[35:56] they be endued with power from on high
[35:57] they were all with one accord in one
[35:59] place and suddenly there came a sound
[36:01] from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and
[36:03] it filled all the house where they were
[36:05] sitting and there appeared unto them
[36:07] cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat
[36:09] upon each of them and they were all
[36:11] filled with the holy ghost and began to
[36:13] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[36:15] gave them utterance
[36:17] we noted here recently how they went out
[36:18] speaking and every man heard them in
[36:20] their own language
[36:22] this was on the day of pentecost
[36:25] this is when all these males of a
[36:26] certain age who are healthy could come
[36:28] and gather for the feast of weeks the
[36:30] gathering rally of the passover required
[36:32] to come back to the temple and at the
[36:34] very moment when the jews are
[36:36] celebrating their liberation and they're
[36:38] remarking this observing of the feast of
[36:40] weeks and the first fruits of the wheat
[36:41] harvest and it's a season of liberation
[36:44] it references the to them it's the
[36:46] culmination of redemption it's the
[36:48] gathering of the passover where jude
[36:51] at that very same moment god back the
[36:53] holy spirit to do what the birth of
[36:55] christianity
[36:58] it's the birth of the body of christ
[36:59] which is the church at the very same the
[37:01] the symmetry that god chooses in that
[37:03] moment at this feast at this time it's a
[37:05] remembrance of not just redemption of
[37:08] coming out of but now is the birth of
[37:10] the church coming out of spiritual
[37:12] bondage
[37:14] into the body of christ and christianity
[37:17] that's what summertime means
[37:19] might be a hot time might be a miserable
[37:21] time might be a war of attrition might
[37:23] last a lot longer than we think it does
[37:25] there was a saying we lived here before
[37:27] we had the saying and i think it's just
[37:28] that cognitive dissonance you try to
[37:30] make everybody else feel jealous
[37:32] i but they say well it's hot three
[37:35] months out of the year but beautiful
[37:36] nine months out of the year
[37:38] and that's what phoenicians say right
[37:39] when we live here
[37:41] and we want to impress other people
[37:43] but when we're honest with each other
[37:47] it's not nine months out of the year
[37:48] right
[37:49] and three months out of the year
[37:51] it's nice
[37:53] and i promise i thought i read a quote
[37:55] that said exactly that and i spent a
[37:57] great portion this week trying to find
[37:58] it haven't found it yet but when i do
[38:00] we'll nail it to that front door
[38:03] because i am certain i heard brother
[38:05] brown say one time almost exactly the
[38:07] office how it's nice three months out
[38:08] here in hot the rest of the year so now
[38:11] go for it stay up on trying to google
[38:13] that
[38:14] i could i haven't been able to find it
[38:15] and i spent a fair amount of time on it
[38:17] but that's but summertime can mean
[38:19] something different to us
[38:21] in a spiritual sense obviously and what
[38:22] it means to the jews
[38:25] and for them in summer time it marked a
[38:27] fruitful time this is what i found
[38:29] interesting when i began to study these
[38:30] phrases this week is how often
[38:32] summertime was associated with the
[38:33] harvest
[38:36] fruits and gathering and harvesting
[38:38] summer you're thinking no that has to be
[38:39] fall that has to be fall but the blooms
[38:41] of spring
[38:43] are already turning into fruit in the
[38:45] summer for certain plants
[38:48] there's a there's a cycle there's even
[38:49] summer fruit there's fruit that's
[38:50] planted in the spring and you can
[38:51] harvest within the same year sometimes
[38:53] even with the summer and so summertime
[38:55] marks a fruitful time
[38:57] think about this for us personally as we
[38:59] enter to this hot time of year and this
[39:01] this season where it's kind of the war
[39:02] of attrition and nobody wants to be here
[39:04] and and we start to get a little bit
[39:06] weary and maybe we start to lose a
[39:07] little bit of our dylan
[39:08] uh we don't want to go outside we don't
[39:10] want to start the car we don't want to
[39:11] go to church we're afraid it's going to
[39:12] be hot these are some other things to
[39:14] think about season of liberation season
[39:16] to celebrate the things that god has
[39:17] done there's a lot of things we could
[39:19] ponder and it marks a fruitful time the
[39:21] feast of weeks the shavuot was a
[39:23] festival of thanking god for the
[39:25] blessing of the harvest
[39:26] because they would already begin to
[39:28] bring in summer fruits
[39:30] i found this phrase a few different
[39:31] places in scripture
[39:33] in second samuel 16 1 and when david was
[39:35] a little past the top of the hill behold
[39:36] ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him
[39:39] with a couple of asses saddled and upon
[39:41] them 200 loaves of bread
[39:43] and a hundred bunches of raisins and a
[39:46] hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of
[39:48] wine
[39:49] these summer fruits were fruits that
[39:51] would have been gathered and harvested
[39:53] already in the summertime
[39:55] not not fruits are waiting to come in
[39:57] the fall
[39:58] but fruits that were naturally being
[39:59] produced in that time and in that season
[40:02] for all the grocery shoppers here we
[40:03] know there's times a year that things
[40:05] naturally are harvested i even know some
[40:08] people who refuse to eat an avocado at
[40:10] certain times a year because they don't
[40:11] believe there's any way that that
[40:13] naturally could have been grown at that
[40:14] time of year there's other fruits that
[40:16] you eat when you know that's the season
[40:18] for tomatoes that's the season for
[40:20] oranges that's the season for
[40:21] watermelons that's when we believe
[40:22] they're at their best and healthy
[40:24] because they're the fruits that grow and
[40:26] come in that summer time right we're all
[40:28] familiar with that right there's things
[40:30] that come to fruit and we crab and eat
[40:33] during the summer season they're called
[40:34] summer fruits
[40:36] god even speaking to israel in
[40:38] deuteronomy chapter 8 talks about wheat
[40:40] and barley and vines and figs and
[40:42] pomegranates and olive oil and honey
[40:45] it's the biquarium which is the the
[40:47] summer fruits the seven species of plant
[40:50] that's gonna wheat's going to come forth
[40:51] barley's going to come forth grapes and
[40:53] figs and pomegranates olives and dates
[40:55] they're called the fruits of summer
[40:58] it was originally going to be my title
[40:59] for the sermon fruits of summer it might
[41:00] have probably been a little bit more
[41:02] spiritual for those who perused the
[41:03] titles
[41:04] besides it's summertime
[41:06] not a reference to a song or anything
[41:09] but fruits of summer is what these
[41:11] things are
[41:13] and this is where maybe i pondered these
[41:15] things and just thought i knew it was
[41:16] the lord press it on my heart to share
[41:18] it i knew it was a little bit different
[41:19] maybe uncomfortable for me to do it
[41:21] but i thought this is this is where it
[41:24] really began to mean something to me
[41:25] today when i pondered it is
[41:27] summer should be a fruitful time
[41:30] but it seems to be so easy to lose some
[41:32] momentum
[41:33] in the summertime
[41:35] it could be for us in phoenix just
[41:36] because of the the heat it could be for
[41:38] some because the interruption of the
[41:39] schedule there's things that parents
[41:41] have to deal with that when the kids are
[41:42] in school they can maintain a certain
[41:44] schedule then you just think about it if
[41:46] you have your kids in school and they're
[41:48] in school all day long from monday to
[41:50] friday during the school year but then
[41:52] all of a sudden they're no longer at
[41:53] school anymore and you're at work monday
[41:55] through friday you got to start making
[41:56] some changes
[41:57] there's things you have to take in
[41:58] consideration there's a lot of different
[42:00] changes that take place and i want to
[42:01] encourage all of us even to some of our
[42:03] young men and our young ladies to our
[42:05] young people that we want to be fruitful
[42:07] this summer
[42:08] because it's a season of fruitfulness
[42:11] very easy i noticed this amongst young
[42:12] people i can remember in my time
[42:15] as as as a teenager that when the summer
[42:18] came you just slept in
[42:20] i mean that's like what summer was for
[42:22] is not getting out of your pajamas ever
[42:24] at all sometimes
[42:26] because you didn't need to you stayed up
[42:28] all night your parents your dad had to
[42:30] go to work and your mom had things to do
[42:31] so they were always in bed but you would
[42:33] just stay up all night doing all
[42:34] whatever you wanted to do and the next
[42:36] day you just slept all day long
[42:38] and those are the things you could do in
[42:39] summertime
[42:41] and summertime can be full of a lot of
[42:42] idleness and a lot of wastefulness
[42:44] but
[42:45] but i'm saying this summer
[42:49] saying it to everyone i'm saying to all
[42:50] of you let's not be idle this summer
[42:53] let's not give give in to laziness let's
[42:55] not give in maybe to the doldrums and
[42:57] the and the weariness and the
[42:58] wastefulness but this is a time to be
[43:00] active
[43:02] the bible says in proverbs 10 5 he that
[43:04] gathereth in summer is a wise son
[43:08] he that gathereth in summer is a wise
[43:10] son we say oh no no no no we gotta wait
[43:12] until the harvest but he that sleepeth
[43:13] and harvest is the sun that causes shame
[43:16] it's not just in the fall months that we
[43:18] can be gathering fruits we can be doing
[43:19] it right now
[43:21] he that gathers in summer it's a time to
[43:23] be active a time to be up and doing it's
[43:25] a fruitful time there's so much that we
[43:26] can take advantage of just think of the
[43:29] opportunities that might be afforded to
[43:30] us now in this season that aren't
[43:32] afforded to us in other seasons
[43:35] that's one reason why we take family
[43:36] vacations we get away we do certain
[43:38] things because the time constraints the
[43:40] demands of school the demands of the
[43:41] other season give us opportunity to do
[43:43] that
[43:44] seven says in proverbs 6 8
[43:47] about the ant speaking about the answers
[43:48] provideth her meat in the summer and
[43:50] gathereth her food in the harvest that's
[43:54] what the ant does it provided her meat
[43:56] in the summer and gathered her food in
[43:58] the harvest
[43:59] i don't know if you knew this but did
[44:01] you know that the bible calls ants
[44:03] people
[44:05] isn't that amazing if you really want to
[44:07] lock somebody up i had somebody say how
[44:08] can you believe the message i was like
[44:09] well
[44:10] i believe a book of dragons and unicorns
[44:13] man all right
[44:14] the things i believe in the bible
[44:17] are even crazier than the vindication of
[44:19] it in the message of the hour
[44:21] and and then they don't really know
[44:22] where to go with that i think they start
[44:24] googling unicorns
[44:26] but the bible says the answer people
[44:29] says the ants are a people not strong i
[44:31] don't know what the hebrew is but it
[44:32] sure reads funny that the ants are a
[44:34] people not strong and though they're not
[44:36] strong yet they prepare their meat in
[44:38] the summer
[44:40] so if we're people bigger than ants and
[44:42] we not being ants but we are a people
[44:44] even though we might consider ourselves
[44:45] to be weak we're instructed by the
[44:46] scripture to prepare our meat in the
[44:49] summer
[44:51] otherwise we'll find ourselves lamenting
[44:52] as they do in jeremiah chapter 8 verse
[44:54] 20 the harvest has passed the summer is
[44:56] ended and we are not saved
[45:00] the harvest is past the summer is in it
[45:02] these are the times when you would
[45:03] gather in things and you would store up
[45:05] for the later seasons you'd store it for
[45:06] the winter and because we did not
[45:08] prepare our meat in the summer we
[45:10] weren't up and doing we weren't
[45:12] gathering in we weren't taking advantage
[45:14] of that season to build up and to take
[45:16] these things in and store these things
[45:18] he says we are not saved
[45:20] and i think summer's a time when we
[45:22] ought not to give into idleness or
[45:24] laziness and not given to excessive
[45:27] spending
[45:29] but continue to to honor the lord and
[45:31] please the lord with all the things that
[45:32] we do
[45:34] because summertime not only does it mark
[45:36] a fruitful time this is kind of my last
[45:37] thought on the subject of summer time
[45:40] taking it from the scripture or from the
[45:42] principle and the seasons of the word of
[45:43] god summertime's a time of growing it's
[45:46] a time of maturing
[45:48] found one definition i believe it's in
[45:49] the merry and western dictionary it's
[45:50] actually comes up in a lot of other
[45:52] dictionaries that the definition of
[45:53] summer is the period of maturing powers
[45:57] that's what summer is it's a period of
[45:59] maturing powers i guess we're all going
[46:00] to find out how mature we are based upon
[46:02] how we respond to 100 consecutive days
[46:05] of over 100 degree temperatures but it
[46:07] is a period of maturing powers it is the
[46:09] time when the sun is at a particular
[46:12] intensity where it is in the in in the
[46:14] sky and how it works upon the plant and
[46:16] the nature within the plant to actually
[46:18] mature seeds to their harvest form
[46:21] that's the season of the summer maybe we
[46:24] can let it lean into the fruitful time
[46:26] lean into this this time of maturing
[46:28] power lord i want to i don't want to
[46:30] slack off i don't want to get lazy i
[46:32] don't want to use this as an excuse to
[46:33] find myself dilly dallying and not being
[46:35] diligent with the things of god but let
[46:36] it be a time when i can take advantage
[46:38] of the season to let the word of god
[46:41] continue to mature me
[46:44] brother branham uses this in the church
[46:46] age book and read it from chapter eight
[46:48] first he says remember please that the
[46:50] sardisian age started the reformation
[46:52] that must still go on until the grain
[46:54] that was planted at pentecost
[46:56] goes through the full cycle of planting
[46:58] watering nourishing
[47:00] until it comes right back to the
[47:01] original seed
[47:03] so he's looking at that cycle planting
[47:05] water and nourishing back to original
[47:06] seed time for harvest while this is
[47:08] going on the tears that were sown will
[47:10] have to go through their cycle and
[47:12] be harvested harvested also that is
[47:14] exactly what we see happening
[47:16] if you the plant that you see and this
[47:19] is the part i want you to focus on
[47:21] growing in full strength in the summer
[47:23] that's what summer is the time of
[47:25] growing the growing of in full strength
[47:27] in the summer suddenly appears to be
[47:29] going to seed
[47:30] summertime is the time of growing to
[47:32] full strength
[47:34] full intensity and then he says suddenly
[47:36] it appears to be going to seed he says
[47:37] you can't tell exactly when summer
[47:39] become autumn it just faded into it
[47:42] so if you're thinking oh this layout to
[47:44] see and age and and these things you say
[47:45] well that is how the ages are especially
[47:47] these last two it just blends in from
[47:50] full strength to harvest time
[47:52] blending from full strength into to
[47:54] rapturing power
[47:56] brother man comes back to it the resume
[47:58] of the age is in chapter 10 of the
[48:00] church age book he says the lutheran age
[48:02] was the springtime the wesleyan age was
[48:05] the summer of growth
[48:07] the layout of scene age is the harvest
[48:08] time of gathering the tares for binding
[48:10] and burning and garnering the wheat for
[48:12] the lord
[48:14] this is applicable on a church age level
[48:16] has application to us in our individual
[48:18] walk and experience with god there's an
[48:21] age which is the summer of growth
[48:24] jesus talks about the seasons and he
[48:26] says that when the fruit is mature
[48:28] immediately the sickle is thrust
[48:31] because it no longer time on the it's
[48:33] not going to get any more mature than
[48:34] mature
[48:36] once it's that point of maturity that
[48:37] the longer it stays on the vine it's
[48:39] going to rot
[48:40] so you have to you have to harvest at a
[48:41] peak point and peak time and it can
[48:44] become tricky for those
[48:45] in horticulture and those who are
[48:46] growing plants got to know the right
[48:48] time to engage in the harvest that you
[48:50] can get the maximum ripeness and some
[48:52] need to be harvested just a little bit
[48:54] before because they're going to be
[48:55] transported and not enjoying to be
[48:56] enjoyed immediately and i'm not
[48:58] pretending to be a farmer so i'm not
[48:59] going to try to get into all that but
[49:01] it's the principle that there's a tea
[49:02] time and a season of growing a summer of
[49:06] growth growing in full strength in the
[49:08] summer
[49:10] that's what summertime is it's a time to
[49:12] grow a time to mature not a time to
[49:13] wither
[49:15] if you think it's hot here it's a little
[49:16] bit hotter out there
[49:18] because of the tremendous humidity
[49:22] summer time fruitful time
[49:24] time of growing and maturing
[49:27] and as i close i had a quote that i was
[49:29] wanting to use wasn't sure just where to
[49:30] use it i thought i'll just use it at the
[49:32] end
[49:33] and i'll express this to you as a church
[49:36] that
[49:37] because it is summertime and our
[49:38] children are some of them are not in
[49:40] school i think some do year round school
[49:42] some are taking college courses during
[49:44] the summer others some of us will have
[49:46] jobs that the summer gives no regard to
[49:49] but whatever could be afforded us during
[49:52] this time
[49:53] it's a time to enjoy the fruits of your
[49:54] labor
[49:56] it's a time to enjoy fruits and to be
[49:59] fruitful and it's a time to grow and
[50:00] mature it's a time to thank god for what
[50:02] he's done in his deliverance and his
[50:04] liberation i i would encourage you in
[50:07] the summertime if there's more time uh
[50:09] to be had there's these paradoxes of of
[50:12] being busy where it seems like you're
[50:14] busy so you don't want to be busy so
[50:15] either you're either busy or you're lazy
[50:17] because you're just it's that tussle and
[50:19] the struggle one against the other let's
[50:21] not fall into idleness it's not succumb
[50:23] to uh to laziness but let's use this
[50:26] time to enjoy
[50:28] the things of god
[50:30] and i know that it's during this time
[50:32] that it gets hot here and maybe it might
[50:34] be more so in this place in phoenix than
[50:37] it is in any other place where people
[50:39] want to leave town as soon as it gets
[50:40] hot
[50:42] and brother man makes this statement and
[50:44] knoweth it not he says when we were here
[50:46] the other time everybody got sick it's
[50:48] august 15th
[50:49] and he says the change from that real
[50:51] hot climate down to this cool climate
[50:54] you got here so he's talking about the
[50:55] hot hot climate to cool climb he says i
[50:58] know you think this is not cool and it's
[51:00] because he came from arizona
[51:02] uh to a cooler climb he says you i know
[51:04] you think this is not cool but you come
[51:06] out to arizona once
[51:10] it was 109 in the shade when i left the
[51:12] other morning
[51:13] and then at around midnight in the night
[51:16] when the cool air come off down off the
[51:18] mountain it was still 96.
[51:21] that's at midnight when the cool air was
[51:23] coming down
[51:25] can i get a witness
[51:27] right is that not true
[51:28] you look at the temperatures they're
[51:30] just hovering there they don't they
[51:32] don't get low enough at night even when
[51:33] that cool air comes around just all the
[51:35] the concrete jungle and all that radiant
[51:37] heat it just builds and builds and
[51:38] builds he said that's at midnight
[51:41] he said the place is all right in the
[51:43] winter time
[51:44] you listening
[51:45] liz i'll tell you i'm probably giving
[51:46] ammunition to somebody but i'm not
[51:48] afraid to read from the message he says
[51:50] it's all right in the wintertime but
[51:52] it's for scorpions and lizards in the
[51:54] summertime
[51:56] not human beings
[51:58] all right it's easy there
[52:01] for scorpions and lizards in the
[52:02] summertime not human beings he says even
[52:05] all the animals take off for the
[52:07] mountains they just can't stand it
[52:10] kobandaba
[52:12] shah three times seven that's what you
[52:14] were looking for right
[52:15] is a quote to justify leaving phoenix
[52:18] and going to the mountains why he says
[52:19] they just can't stand it
[52:22] and so i want to add my voice to that
[52:25] and say if you could take a vacation
[52:27] this summer take it
[52:29] take advantage of it because brother
[52:30] bram says the lizards and scorpions do
[52:33] it
[52:34] and you ants are a people not strong
[52:38] you might as well do it too right
[52:41] and i say it in this sense it may seem
[52:42] to be a little bit of a jest and i say
[52:44] it jokingly but i
[52:47] i want i for myself and for my family
[52:49] we're at every service
[52:51] right i never wake up on a sunday
[52:52] morning and ask my wife should we go
[52:54] today
[52:55] we come right we're just we're not going
[52:57] to miss and it's easy when you're when
[52:59] we're in that mode as the pastor and the
[53:01] pastor's family it's easy for us to
[53:03] always notice when others aren't here
[53:06] you would notice maybe if i didn't show
[53:08] up on wednesday night brother michael
[53:09] just keeps singing and finally at 8 30
[53:11] he's like well
[53:12] i guess we're just gonna dismiss brother
[53:14] aaron didn't show up you'd all notice if
[53:15] i didn't show up one time well in the
[53:17] same way as a family we notice when
[53:20] people don't show up
[53:21] that maybe you don't notice but it just
[53:23] seems we have this heightened
[53:24] sensitivity
[53:25] and i want you as the as the people and
[53:27] the members of this church the sheep
[53:28] that are here fellowshipping just to
[53:30] know that there's no law that binds you
[53:33] to be at every service and if you're not
[53:36] here you're somehow
[53:37] going to break some
[53:39] written or unwritten rule
[53:40] if it's the summer time when all the
[53:42] lizards and scorpions are headed out to
[53:44] the mountains because they can't stand
[53:46] the heat if this is your time and your
[53:48] opportunity to take a vacation take
[53:50] advantage of it
[53:52] the only thing i guess i would say is
[53:53] try not to leave when i'm gone because
[53:55] i'd love i'd rather everyone be here for
[53:56] visiting ministry than everyone be here
[53:58] when i'm here because you always have a
[54:00] chance to hear me but i wanted to share
[54:01] that to say if you have an opportunity
[54:04] take the opportunity
[54:05] very important to our our sanity i know
[54:07] it is as a minister as a family that's
[54:09] committed itself to serving the body of
[54:11] christ that it's important for us to
[54:12] take our breaks
[54:14] it's important to have our time away to
[54:15] regroup as a family to be refreshed and
[54:17] revived and believe it or not you may
[54:19] not feel like it some of you say well i
[54:20] never take vacations we never go away we
[54:22] never have time away you need it
[54:25] and you say well no i want to be at
[54:26] every service i want to be there every
[54:28] time the church doors are open
[54:29] that's wonderful and that's great but
[54:31] time away with your family is also
[54:33] wonderful put in the right things first
[54:35] if you want to follow the grateful dead
[54:36] i don't know if they still do that if
[54:38] they're still dead heads you want to go
[54:39] to some music festival or burning man i
[54:40] probably wouldn't advise that
[54:42] but getting away as a family spending
[54:44] time with extended families seeing
[54:45] places and doing things you otherwise
[54:47] wouldn't have an opportunity to do
[54:48] summertime's the time to do it
[54:51] and i know many of you take advantage of
[54:52] it
[54:53] and i wanted just to add that that we
[54:55] understand we know what this the season
[54:57] is like
[54:58] and so i said summer time take advantage
[55:00] of it
[55:01] whatever that might mean to you however
[55:03] you might be able to put that in
[55:04] application it's a unique time it's a
[55:06] hot time but it's a time to take
[55:08] advantage of it god bless you let's
[55:10] stand this evening
