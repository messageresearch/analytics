TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Ephesians 28 very um I I believe it's a very profound scripture especially for one that is seeking salvation one that is um entering into the body of Jesus Christ to understand how that there is no Hoops to it that there's it's not something where there's a bunch of rules to get into the body of Christ or to be saved but it's a very simple concept that has been laid out for us it says for by grace are ye saved through faith and not that not that of yourselves it is a gift of God let us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord It's just such a privilege to be here and to Worship You Lord Jesus and fill your Holy Spirit Lord I ask as your word goes forth that you just take control of this service as you already have been father that whatever you need for us father that it may be sewed into our hearts this morning Lord Jesus that if we need more of you father if we need more strength if we need a deeper relationship whatever it might be father whether it's in the body father or whether it's something spiritual Lord I just ask that it may be imparted this morning Father God I ask that you just take away everything that is contrary to you father and Lord just allow your Holy Spirit to come and flow through the word Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen you may be seated one one of uh the scriptures that helped me as a young man and I'm sure it's helped many people to understand um the the beautiful simpleness of how God brings his children into the fold um my message today is Grace through faith very simple one and I want to um really go into the thought of faith and it's something that brother Branham and we've heard many ministers talk about for years and ages how important faith is and um I'm sure we all know that there's a natural concept of faith in the world which which we all have in some degree and it's not something bad it's something that we use every single day but it's this natural Faith or belief it's it's considered important to people because it provides like a sense of purpose um whether it's it's in a higher power or whether it's in a self-belief or it's a set of principles it's something so that it gives us purpose it gives us hope it gives us strength in life it helps us navigate through challenges by offering comfort and guidance most of the time uh we we look at something else for a faith or belief but there's we know that it we can also look within ourselves and believe within ourselves now we're just talking about a a um overall belief system or overall faith that people have that a person can believe in themselves and this belief in oneself has it it's actually this is the age that this kind of belief in oneself it's it's dominant in this culture now to to where it it's it it this belief in oursel it gives us a personal development it it it helps us with our mental health it helps us with success so you you have to believe in yourself to be successful right uh there's a focus on on our self-esteem our self-love our self-realization especially with a r rise of these uh Wellness Industries and motivational speaking and personal coaching we have this faith or we have this belief that helps us out and um I'm going to out myself because I I don't want to out anybody else but I don't know who's ever listened to a motivational speech but man they're good yeah you know um I used to work in sales I needed that every single day because I wasn't in the sales where where you're you're calling somebody or somebody's going into a place to where they already want the product you just want to up the price a little bit no you're I was walking into businesses is to where there's a great big neon sign that says no soliciting yeah and somehow you have to forget about it and be like I'm going to walk in and I'm going to try to convince this person that doesn't want me there that they really need the product so you really need Faith then you really need a self-belief because I I've seen many grown men and women sitting in the car while I I was there coaching them and and supervising them and and they just could not get themselves to walk into a place because they didn't have the confidence in the product yeah not only that but they didn't have confidence in themselves so whenever they walked in they were already defeated it was almost the person the the CEO or the the the decision maker we had to talk to they were convincing them why the product wasn't good it's um something where everybody needs and and a lot of times you need those things motivational speaking to help a person out just so that you can go over there and act like you've known the CEO for 20 years and say hey is Bill there I want to talk to him and never seen me in my in in his life ever but it's it's this selfconfidence that everybody is looking for this self-belief that everybody is striving for it's something that is good and even though this faith is good it's it it's a natural faith even though it's needed it's natural in Ephesians if you'd like to turn with me in um chapter 4 verse 4 and to 6 we're going to be reading a lot of scriptures if you don't mind Ephesians 4 4- 6 it says now there is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all so this this broad thought of Faith it's a natural inherent faith that we all have but this one that Paul is speaking to the people he's saying this is one Faith yeah this is not the faith that we just believe in ourselves but this is a faith the faith it's separate from any any other belief any other thing that makes us confident anything else but it is a faith in Jesus Christ and it's one yes it's called the faith brother Bram he says this in in Blasphemous names and here he explains the statue of a perfect man really well and he he's explaining how in uh paragraph 142 he says patience and so forth there's a mockery of it it's a a pretending to be a nature given Faith so the faith that we inherit or the faith that's already in us or we build up in our character even though it's good it's still compared to the faith of God it's a mockery and it's a pretending to be right so that there is there is a genuine faith and then there is a mockery or a pretending to be a nature-- giving Faith a nature virtue there's a nature given temp Temperance all these are nature given so it's not something it's it's already natural in us it's nature given but compared to this faith it is a mockery or pretending to be he says the biggest part of our faith is a mental Faith so this this pretending or this mockery it's still a big part of our faith and he says by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of a God right so so it's good it'll take us to the door it'll make us realize yes there is a God above right but it's still a natural Faith but he says but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there is a Godly spiritual Faith then what does it do the faith that recognizes the word no matter what anything else says it only recognizes the word because in the the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word is still God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation so we have a mental Faith it's good we we can uh help ourselves out with it but this faith that is given or is is from God it's from above and it's not something that we can conjure up but it is given from God it it's it's a faith that where we step right at the door then the word pours into our faith his word and his faith a spiritual faith that will believe in things that we can never see things that the world can never see so God God is not only the a giver of this Faith because he gives this faith we we do not conjure it up we cannot work ourselves from with this Faith it's a god-given faith just like the Bible says that we um where we read it says we are saved by grace through faith it is a gift of God so so this is all a gift this is all something that has been blessed upon us this Revelation is a gift to us so he's not only The Giver of the faith but he is also the author and the originator of our faith Hebrews 12:2 looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God so he is the originator of our faith which means the inaugurator the the leader the Pioneer or the Forerunner of our faith Jesus not only said that but he it's he is also the perfector yes he's also the perfector the one to complete it and we'll hit this a little later if God willing but it means that there's a beginning and a completion to our faith that it's not only just um something that you just believe in or something that you just receive and now you have it but you receive something from God and and now there there is almost a Capstone to it yeah there there there is a growth there's a growing in this Faith so so just to recap the this Faith isn't our self-esteem it's not our self-realization our self-love but it is salvation yes why do we need this Faith it's for our salvation of our souls the Redemption back to our original state that's why we need this Faith see all these other faith we can we can have faith in our ourselves faith in our family faith in this faith in that but this faith is in Christ Jesus very good this is the faith that believes in the word and nothing but the word amen this is that faith it was that faith that believed in the word that word that was made flesh and died for us Romans Romans 5 verses 1-2 it says and Paul really lays this out this is very um you you just start listening to Paul and this is him just shouting this out this whole time and and I believe it's because of the um the situation that he was put in and the situation he came out of that he had to really preach this and show them that Faith this this is it this is your salvation this is the way he says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ now I I really enjoyed the the message hidden in profanity because brother Aaron was showing how God was separated from the people he was too Divine so he he came and became common he be became that and and this this faith that we believe in this man that became Prof profanity to us became common to us we were able to receive receive him and now through that faith we have peace with God the Untouchable the the one that we could not see the one that we could not even get close to now there's there's a connection made he says with God through our Lord Jesus Christ and he says by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of glory of God so brother brandham he says a beautiful uh thing here and he he says it all over in a lot of his messages but here in Statue of a perfect man he says and the key is Faith the faith holds the key and the key is the scripture and Christ is the door see Faith takes the little hinges of the scripture and unlocks the glories and the good of God out to his people see so Faith holds the key and it unlocks Christ to the people unlocks it reveals it amen so through faith we can look upon his word and we begin to have access to the glories of God everything you need whether it's your salvation whether it's healing whether it's something from God now we have our faith to unlock the hinges of the scripture and now we have acces so so this salvation that God gave us many people say well Jesus Di died on the cross yet their faith is not accepting what they did what he did by the life that they live right so so in order to receive this Universal salvation that is given to all and not to a particular people he said for God so loved the world so he gave it to all but now it takes one of us it takes somebody with faith to accept the word and open up the glories of God to accept your salvation Amen to accept every promise that God has given you it's through the faith so we have access now to God now when we were once enemies with God now we have peace with them what a beautiful thing that that makes me happy because you know a lot of times we feel like oh God Jesus Loves Me Jesus and and we'll see that but the life isn't there it's it's not so much if I'd like to say this this way it's not so much the sacrifice that sets you free but it is the faith that is able to accept it right like brother brandham says a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received so it can be there at our doorstep for years and years and years and say oh I believe God thank you Lord and never receive it never just like brother brandham when he was talking about the token where you he he kind of gave this concept or this um this Narrative of a priest saying oh I believe God I I you know I'm the best of the best and I believe this but he never applied the token yeah and because he didn't apply the token he wasn't under the blood it's the same thing you know we want it but we have to receive it through faith amen so he he is the key or the faith is the key that opens up the scriptures or or faith is the hand that opens that is the key we see clearly that the source of faith is not found with us it's not within us faith is something that is given to us by God now um here in in Titus he says that if You' like to turn with me in first Titus in chapter I mean uh Titus 1 and 4 and then we're going to go to Jude 1 and 3 here here is this A peculiar situation going with with Titus and Jude where where they they explain faith and salvation as common and it's really helped me out really helped me study because the word profanity isn't in that word common which is I I believe a a Coos well so he says um to Titus my own son after the common Faith grace and mercy and peace from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior so this faith that is not found within us it's not something that we can just receive or conjure up it's something particularly given to us by God but yet in in a sense it is a common faith and and it's not so much where it is profane or it it's it's something where it's dragged up on the in the ground or something that people can conjure up but it means that it's readily available right that it's something that is universal that it's not given to a certain type of race or a certain type of people but it's given to the whole entire world yes it is a common faith and in Jude it says beloved I when I have given all diligence to write unto the common salvation it was needed for me to write unto you and exort that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once uh delivered unto the Saints brother brandham he says now also he promised that there would be a restoring of the faith not a faith we read over in Jude that he said in Jude earnestly contend for the faith that was once Del delivered to the Saints now we are promised in Malaki 4 by the same system he always had always did that we would be restored back to the original Faith right oh oh my back to the original seed back to the original seed like it in the be um began on the day of Pentecost back to the same Doctrine by word by word Power by power Spirit by Spirit the same thing so there was going to be a restoration of the gift and he said the common salvation and I and you know if anybody heard the message uh hidden in profanity there we see that God this Divine God that is separate from all of us he became common for us and and when I see this salvation and this faith it means that it has become this Divine thing that has been given from God from a place of Holiness from a place of separatism or or separateness a a place of that that we'll never see he comes and he stoop down to give us a Salvation that is readily available to each and every person that wants it and he gives us this thing called faith that anybody can have so we can receive this Faith this faith that is given by God so even though it's given by God he doesn't divide it and say you can't have it or you can have it but it's to whosoever will whoever wants this can receive it and believe in this salvation and be saved am so it it throughout the Bible this faith is presented as something that people are capable of having regardless of their background or race or status in the New Testament for example Jesus often emphasizes the need for faith in God in passages like in Matthew 17:20 he tells his disciples that e even if they have the faith as small as a mustard seed they can move mountains this suggests that the faith in some form is universally available and is fundamental part of a human experience that it's it's something that even though Lord I Have A Little Bit of Faith well that Faith you're able to move mountains with that Faith you can move forward with that Faith you can receive your salvation the faith that he gives you but this ability to believe in God or to trust in Salvation it's not something that we build up ourselves or something that we we conjure up in our minds so it's readily available but it's something that God himself is the author of this Faith amen this is where the distinction lies while Faith it's available it and it's required for salvation its source is an origin it's in a Divine place came from a Divine being faith comes from God as a result of his grace and without him people are unable to have a genuine faith that leads to Salvation so without this faith without this believing see we we can have a mental conception we can stand at the door and say yeah yeah he he's good he's right but without this faith that is readily available it's not something that we can separate from it's given to us without that we cannot have that genuine faith we can't have that genuine experience of Salvation until we receive that so this dual aspect of faith it it's it's ready availableness and the divine origin It reflects a a tension between God's sovereignty and the human responsibility there there's there's this tension where God he's given it to us yet we have a responsibility to receive it and and I I believe this is It's essential that's why you know I I'm sure everybody's heard when when I believe um Joel Olstein goes and talks to Oprah and he says well every everybody can be saved what about the gays or what about this or what about what about the Muslim well no everybody can be he he just he just messed up the formula because this faith is only in the word right this faith is only in Christ Jesus you can't have a form of Faith you can't have a form of of some kind of belief system that you think you'll be able to be saved without Jesus Christ right there's only one Faith right one God one Lord and that is in Christ Jesus so there's there it is the Gateway for our Salvation we are justified by faith not by works and even though this Faith might look like you're doing something it's a gift right it this even though it's a Gateway and you're it's needed it it gives us a responsibility that we need to believe it's not a work that you do it's a gift from God it's whenever we step up and we start having that desire we step up and say Lord I believe in you whatever mental conception we have God will see it and pour His word into us and give us that Faith so that's how we receive it says Romans 10:17 it says so then Faith cometh by hearing we can hear a lot of things we can hear a lot of people but Faith don't come by those things Faith cometh by the hearing of the word of God so we can receive Faith by motivational speaking but that's going to get us as as far as the open door to a CEO's office yeah that'll get us as close as a successful life to to uh if we need to work out or we need to do that it'll give us motivation to do that but this will take us all the way to Salvation only one Faith the faith in Jesus Christ and it's by the hearing of his word that we receive this whenever we go and we open our hearts that that's why I I believe these Services every service that where somebody can sit with an open heart and the word can be po poured out there's something happening even though maybe you don't see it physically somebody has opened their heart to the word and and there's going to be a spiritual transformation that nothing nothing else can give that is by the word now the most com well it's one of the most the scriptures that I talk about the most is John 1:1 in the beginning was the word in the word the word was with God and the Word was God verse two and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made verse four he says in him was life yes and the life was the light of men now the scripture in 2 Corinthians 4:6 it says that for whom God commanded the light to shine in darkness hath shined in our hearts and give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so the light this life is the the light of men and the Bible says it's the knowledge amen of the glory the lord Jesus Christ right so this this light or this life it's light to us so when this word comes which is the knowledge and we receive it it it lights up our life and what do we have we when the lights turn on now we have a visual understanding or discernment to see things far away and see things that are happening yes when at first we couldn't because just like in in uh I believe it's in 2 Corinthians it says that that the Gentiles or it's in Ephesians where their understanding was darkened through on through and they because their understanding is darkened they being alienated from God right so they they're alienated from God and now their their understanding is darkened right so the light is the knowledge the light is the life right the darkness is the ignorance and and and here Paul is talking about a willful ignorance and it's because they're alienated from that light alienated from God so that's what that is receiving and and why I'm I'm trying to um paint this picture is because what we receive we begin to be transformed by this and when we receive the word of God we receive the light and we receive the life and the life is your eternal life it's your original state it's what you were there back then in the beginning and whenever you receive it you receive the light which is the life and it reminds me of John 3 316 where it says for God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth so God he could give his son to the world he did and it wasn't for a specific people he said for God so loved the world that whosoever believeth that's the caveat whoever believes in him whoever trust and believes in this Jesus Christ that was slain those are the ones that are SA saved 17 it says for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God so this Faith it's powerful your faith it's necessary for your salvation the belief in Jesus Christ the belief in the word that's what gives you your salvation not anything else we can pile up rules we can pile up things we can pile up a bunch of Hoops that you have to go through but when you go down to the essence of it it's through your faith in Christ Jesus in the begotten son and not only in the son that was slain there but the S the one that was tooken off the cross put into Hell Rose up the third day went up to the right hand of the father came down on Pentecost all the way down to the ages and is here now that's the son that we're believing in not in a history not not in a thought but in a son that is actively a gift that is active a gift that you know I don't know if you've ever received received a gift but where it's like man I really like that gift but it's probably all messed up already or the the chocolates that g they gave you in your birthday well you like well that was a nice gift I appreciate it but it's it was way back when that's not the gift of Jesus Christ we we don't have to look back then and say oh praise God for that but it's the Jesus Christ now today that keeps on working that that sacrifice is still working today yes he says he that believeth or or here on 19 it says and this is the condemnation now he explains what the condemnation is right so he first he says he that believeth not is condemned already right now he says this is the condemnation let me explain it to you he says the light is come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil so the light the knowledge the truth the word came into the world and Men loved the darkness what they love to be alienated from God they love the ignorance they don't want anything with the gospel they don't want anything with the word and because of that there is condemnation the reason I'm saying that is because when we believe when we don't want anything to do with the the willful ignorance we step into the light which is our salvation John 8:32 he says and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so this light is the knowledge the truth the word it'll make you free and the amount of Truth is the amount of Freedom the the the amount of life is the amount of light that we have in our life that's why we can see throughout the ages there was an amount of light there was portions of light but now we've had a prophet that said good morning good morning why the fullness of the light what does that mean the fullness of the truth and the more light you have the more freedom the more truth that you know the more freedom that you have it's not the truth shall make you free but knowing the truth having a knowledge of the truth that's what makes us free we are in the most tremendous age because we have that yes where we're not living in in in in a shadow we're not living in in a light that is reflecting we're living in the fullness of the word the fullness of the truth to where it'll not only just get us in a Justified State not only get us in another state but it will take us all the way back to the original condition that's what this truth does and when we believe it we step into the light yes whosoever beli believeth they shall not be condemned whosoever trusts in God this one Faith Romans 1:16 to18 he says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power unto salvation there's not a period there to everyone that believeth so there's a power to Salvation if you have the key if you have that access if you have that right away to that salvation when you have that Faith you have that power of Salvation he says to the Jew first and also the Greek for there is the righteousness that is revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith 18 He says for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness unto man who hold the truth in unrighteousness here in the Cambridge commentary they say explains revealed from Faith to Faith he says it is unfolding and displays faith and only Faith as its Secret at each disclosure the initial step the entrance to just Faith to Faith the faith is also the life of a Justified of the Justified is maintained by the faith so faith is the starting point and the course yes that's why he is the author and the finisher there is a growth there's a faith to Faith to Faith where he is the author there is a start your initial Faith starts there in justification and then as you move on into your life as you grow into the light maybe you've received a little light maybe you've received a little truth and as you receive more and more the light gets more and more until you are perfected in faith amen I believe that the bride is stepped into the dawn yes but but individuals individuals are still receiving that light some are still stepping out of Lady oia some are still getting out of of a a stage of bondage through doctr through all these things and stepping into the light how through the word of God Amen Faith through faith through faith through faith so righteous righteousness where when you see you're justified by faith it's righteousness you have been made righteous so righteousness is deemed through faith man that that puts a lot of burdens off of our shoulders try trying to live something that we can never live something that we try to expectation that we make in ourselves we we take it out we believe and because we believe it's been imputed unto you righteousness then the fruits of the spirit come then then the fruits of the spirit just as Paul was talking to the Galatians he said there there's it's not a work of the flesh but it's a fruit yes amen it's something that just comes after you believe in Christ Jesus yes am so there's that righteousness is deemed through faith but here in verse 18 He says unrighteousness or sin is deemed through unbelief brother Bram Mo says sin is unbelief he says that the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness to those who are um of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness holding the truth let's not think of unrighteousness of of some kind of act but brother brandham says is unbelief we're Justified righteous by faith and we are condemned by unbelief and we we can hold this in unrighteousness it says the revelation of righteousness is while the the Apostle writes being made the person of Christ and salvation offered by him and the revelation of Wrath is to be inferred as an actual condition a degradation by doubly being degraded when we don't believe are just like the fruits of the spirit through faith we begin to walk into the spirit we begin to change why because we believe you're not going to do something that you don't believe in right and nobody has to force you into something that you 100% when no questions asked you believe in it why does somebody have to force me into it I'm stepping into it cuz I believe and when we hold it with unbelief there there's a degradation trying to hold on to it yet our life crumbles and crumbles and crumbles here here um there's a plain example of of what unbelief does here in Matthew where Matthew Matthew 13:57 to 58 he says and they were offended in him because Jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor save in his own country and in his own house and he did not many works there because of their unbelief right because of unbelief we we almost stop the glory of God through unbelief we we stop God so my my uh title was going to be the the wrong belief but I realized that there's only one Faith so if if we we believe wrong or we're believing in the wrong thing it means we're not believing and we we don't have the the faith we might have a faith but we don't have the faith so so whenever we don't believe there's almost a chain there's a cut off from God's glory there's a cut off from God's Miracles brother brandham he says in the ministry explain he says somebody says how does Divine Healing is it does it last all the time brother brandham says it lasts as long as your faith lasts and salvation lasts the same way just as long as your faith lasts when you feel that you're not saved anymore you're not saved for by Grace you are saved through Grace is that right now I know this is a very you can go either way and there can be condemning there but but this Satan he loves what he loves to do is attack the mind of the people and try to make us not believe and make us feel somehow what is that word Gaslight us into not believing into feeling like like we don't we don't really believe yeah yet we're here every Sunday we're we're we're standing on the word we believe in the Lord we we trust in him and every but somehow we don't believe because he said so I I I don't think I think the devil is attacking us because we do believe I think the devil attacks us because we are standing where we're supposed to stand the Bible in Hebrews 11:6 it says without faith it's impossible to please him so so why does is it impossible because we alienate ourselves from that light we we flee from the one that is is trying to help us right so um I I preached this I think a few Wednesdays ago of how um brother Brandon was talking to Sister Bruce and she was just all in a distraught State how she thought she did didn't believe and he says you do believe you are a Christian right and it's just how the devil will get a Christian a son and a daughter of God into a bind and feel like oh Lord I I don't believe I don't believe I don't believe when you do believe it's just the devil wants to amen make us feel like we don't believe if he can take the belief out of the word out of Salvation then he's got us but I I believe it's more subtle than that that th this this uh not believing and not being saved I I believe the devil wants to just like in the Garden of Eden present another thought present another concept it's not so much a struggling within yourself of you've been standing on the word and and you're struggling on can I believe or not but it's presenting another thought that is almost more enjoyable or more enticing than the thought of the word that's what the devil did he didn't go over there and beat up Eve and she I don't know if I believe or not she she he just gave her better ideas yeah hm I never thought of that I never thought that way I never seen it this way to the point where where she brother brandham says it's a beautiful scripture and conflict or a beautiful quote conflict between God and saying he says but you have to ignore before in order to believe the devil's lie you have to ignore and deny God's truth first first before you have to believe the devil's lie you ever you ever think of that you have to deny the truth first before you could believe a lie right you have to deny it so first there has to be a better concept A Better thought a better Doctrine a better way of seeing the word trying to take Christ out of the church and when we can do that then what we do is is we handle the truth in unrighteousness and unbelief twisting the word because of the devil and not being able to receive salvation brother brandham I I mean uh Paul he has a struggle with the Galatians what a beautiful scripture I was um reading it while I or listening to it while I was at work and just just relising to it and man the struggle that he had with these these beautiful group of people where where he even said oh you foolish Galatians he he wasn't playing around yeah I I thought he was bad on the Corinthians but you go to the Galatians and he's over there you foolish Galatians yeah yeah who who be witched you who Put a Spell on You yeah how by their words he says oh foolish Galatians in gal uh Galatians 3:1 to 3:1 he says oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ had Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you now this is an amazing it reminds me of the the messages we've been hearing because if if we go to the New Living Translation this is how he says it oh foolish Galatians who has cast a spell on you for the meaning of Christ death was made clear to you as if you had seen a picture of his death on the cross he laid out such a picture by his words and by his preaching that they could clearly see the death of Jesus Christ on the cross he painted it with the words of the Lord and He he said how how how are you now denying this picture yeah how are you denying this portrait of Jesus Christ who has Bewitched you what what happened was these people that were free they were called to be free from the law free from sin free from all these things somebody came with at that time was the word of the Lord at one point it was God's word came in and said well we're Jews and you need to be circumcised you need to be you need to follow the law you need to follow the traditions of of what we've we' have done for years and years just like in the law of Moses and these people weren't Pharisees that didn't give their heart to the Lord they were saved by the same Grace the ones that were given it to them and they were living like Gentiles yet they wanted to in in uh impart and and press these people in circumcising themselves and putting all these Traditions onto themselves and somehow they were Bewitched in doing those things he says he says in in three uh chapter 3 in verse 2 and 3 he says for this only I would learn of you now he's asking a question he's I want to ask you this receive the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of the faith he's asking how did you receive the Holy Ghost he's not talking to newborns he's not talking to to somebody that just came in he's talking to those that have received the spirit and he saying how did you receive it through faith through the law he says oh ye are so foolish having begun in the spirit how how through faith are now perfected by or you are made perfect by the flesh so so what what happened is they received the word they received what they needed but they they begin to adopt different different thoughts right different doctrines to where it's like now you have to do this in order to be saved you have to do this in order to be accepted you you have to do these certain things and and Paul says you are making Christ void you are denying the faith in Galatians 5:1 he says Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty praise God Amen that's where we're at yes amen you are free you're free from condemnation you're free from all those things and and now he's telling these people you uh Stand Fast in the Liberty where with Christ had made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage behold I Paul say unto you that if you be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing so the danger in believing in something else outside of the word voids Christ from our life when we when we don't receive the word because that is the light what we do is we dim the light and now the knowledge cuz you shall know the truth and it shall make you free now now you're going back into bondage because you're rejecting the the knowledge you're rejecting the freedom amen he says Christ will profit you nothing for I testify again to every man that is circumcised he is a debtor to the whole law Christ is become of no effect unto you and me I I started to think how a shift in belief it's not not struggling to struggling even though you believe but it's a shift in belief yes switching even though the the freedom can be preached throughout these years in this Pulpit if there's a shift in belief we can throw ourselves back into the same thing we came out of he says Christ is become of no effect to you whosoever of you are justified by the law we are fallen from Grace what a powerful thing just because we change the belief we we want works we we want to justify ourselves by works we fall from grace and we hold the truth in unrighteousness for we through the spirit wait in Hope of righteousness by faith for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love now just like he says healing as is as long as your faith lasts salvation is the same thing here he says that circumcision it aileth nothing there there's it's all it's it has no value when you are standing in faith but here he's also saying that if you're circumcised you're making Christ void the uh Christ shall not profit you nothing if if you circumcise and you justify Yourself by the law and here you can clearly see in in 1 Timothy here in closing 1 Timothy 4:1 he says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times they shall depart depart from the faith so there's a departing from the faith how giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils so that's the only way we can depart from Faith it's not the struggle that you have every single day believing in the word standing in the word the devil will try to make you disbelieve but it's when we turn into a a doctrine of a devil seducing Spirits seducing thoughts seducing things that not make us make us think oh well I never thought of that I never seen it that way and it's away from the light of God away from Christ Jesus now it's it's an amazing thing how Paul is telling all these people but in in Acts there was one time where uh Paul and Timothy were going to the Jews and he tells Timothy hey you need to be circumcised even though he's telling all these people don't be circumcised it's it's going to it's going to void Christ in your life but it's because the belief behind the ACT they they believed and they did the act and it voided Christ in their life but here Paul as he said to the Jew I have become a Jew right to the Gentiles I become a gentile to those that are weak I become weak and they knew they were going into a Jewish community and and uh Timothy his father was a Greek his mother was a a Jew and I believe with the mother if you have a mother that's a Jew then you are part of the the culture you're part of you are a Jew so they knew if they walked in there without him being circumcised that it would offend them that it would hurt them so they said you have to be circumcised so that we can become like them so that we can take them out of the mud that they're in right right then there's another situation where Titus didn't want to get circumcised even he was not compelled to be circumcised when he was talking to the Galatians because he was full Greek and he would have offended the Gentiles and hardened their hearts so so it's not the ACT it's not well you you have you have to have a a tie while you're up here right well you you have to do certain things and we create certain structures certain things and and that almost determines your salvation with certain doctrines that don't even it availeth nothing you can do it you can't you don't have to do it but there's people that will do it and because of their belief they turn away from Christ and they are condemned there's another instance in Romans where he's talking about the man that the the people that are weak in faith he calls them he says when you go to those people because you have the freedom you know that you can eat anything you want and these people are subject to herbs and all of that because of their Traditions don't go over there and eating a big old steak and saying oh look at my freedom but understand that these people are in bondage in bondage by some kind of thought some kind of uh belief system which e even though they still believe in Christ they still believe in Christ for salvation there's certain things that if they stop doing it they will be condemned in their eyes he even says in in Romans 14:22 he says hast thou Faith have it um have it to thyself before God he's telling the man that that is full of Faith he's like do it for God don't flaunt yourself and hurt other people he said happy is he that condemneth not himself in the thing that which he alloweth he that douth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith whato ever is not of faith is sin right so this person that that is indoctrinated with certain things if we try to present something and it condemns them or they feel like they're condemned they are condemned because they leave the faith and they believe that they are not saved anymore right it it's it's where we have to stand in Liberty become a Jew to the Jews become a gentile to the Gentile become weak to the weak and bring those in and not being Tangled by any of these seducing spirits that try to void the Jesus Christ in his word if You' like to stand with me I just um I added this quote it felt just so needed but if the musicians would like to come he says it's God manifest in flesh now in the flesh of his bride so now it's not we're not talking about a historical Jesus he's now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the self same flesh these two are one and the church is becoming the bride and all all the time by believing the word so she she's she's stepping into the bride she's stepping into the light by believing right not by anything else the the word could be presented to us but it's whenever we begin to believe and take it in we begin to step into our position Faith after Faith after Faith after Faith until Christ will come and perfect our faith until he will come and say Well done Son Well Done daughter and it's by believing the Simplicity of the word cuz he's hi hidden in this even though just as brother Aaron's been saying he is the complex God that we'll never be able to understand he gives it to us in such a way we can receive it anyone Amen Let Us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful for this faith that you have given us Lord that's only been been departed by you even Jesus when he was in his flesh he says flesh and blood has not re revealed this to you but my father that is in heaven not even Jesus himself in the flesh but it was a spiritual Revelation from God and Lord we know we have that father we just ask that we hold this truth and we we stand on this truth that not only ourselves can be transformed into the very image into into your likeness but father our families and those around us can see that light and receive it also father Yes Lord you are that light you are the life you are the knowledge and you've given it to your people father so they become the light of the world yes they're the ones that impart that knowledge they're the ones that show the light show the truth everywhere they go father Lord I ask that you just bless each and every person the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen hallelujah yeah brother
