[0:00] Genesis 11, we'll start with verse 5.
[0:02] And the Lord came down to see the city
[0:04] and the tower which the children of men
[0:07] build it. And the Lord said, "Behold,
[0:09] the people is one, and they have all one
[0:12] language, and this they begin to do. And
[0:15] now nothing will be restrained from them
[0:17] which they have imagined to do. Go to,
[0:20] let us go down, and there confound their
[0:23] language, that they may not understand
[0:25] one another's speech." So the Lord
[0:27] scattered them abroad from then upon the
[0:29] face of all the earth, and they left off
[0:32] to build the city. Therefore is the name
[0:35] of it called Babel, because the Lord did
[0:37] there confound the language of all the
[0:39] earth, and from thence did the Lord
[0:41] scatter them abroad upon the face of all
[0:44] the earth. Quite a story, a lot there
[0:47] just in the reading. Is very simplistic,
[0:49] very straightforward, but you can just
[0:51] imagine how much more was involved in
[0:52] these few verses. You could take your
[0:54] seats tonight.
[0:58] My my title is music's momentum on
[1:01] Sunday. Uh not recalling my title off
[1:05] hand, but we were talking about the
[1:06] world of music. That was what it was,
[1:08] the full and extensive and completely
[1:10] exhaustive study on the history of
[1:12] music. And we ministered on the world of
[1:14] music. And we're drawing a lot of things
[1:16] out of the scripture just to see kind of
[1:18] where music began and how it's come to
[1:20] be uh developed in human society and
[1:22] just what it means to God. We'll touch
[1:24] on a few of those scriptures very
[1:26] quickly here in a moment. But here I'm
[1:27] wanting to use this phrase music's
[1:29] momentum. I'm looking at u certain
[1:32] aspects of music um especially in light
[1:34] of how we're taught in the message of
[1:35] the hour to the time that we're living
[1:38] in. And we saw scripturally that music
[1:40] is ordained by God. It's not just a
[1:42] creation of human ingenuity or human
[1:45] ambition or tradition, but it's
[1:47] something that was ordained by God. We
[1:49] could say that God created music and God
[1:52] created instruments when he formed
[1:54] Lucifer. And even God is when he
[1:57] redeems. It says, "When I build you
[1:58] back, I'll build you with your tablets
[2:00] so that you can sing." In Psalms 149, it
[2:03] says, "God takes pleasure in our singing
[2:06] and praise." In Psalm 22 says, "He
[2:08] dwells in our singing and musical
[2:10] worship." In Zephaniah 3, we saw how
[2:12] that God will sing over us with joy. So
[2:15] God is singing. Says in Revelations 15,
[2:18] they have the harps of God and they're
[2:21] harping. In Hebrews chapter 2, which is
[2:23] a prophecy in Psalm 22, it speaks of
[2:25] Christ standing in the midst of the
[2:27] church, in the midst of the congregation
[2:29] singing. So there is great significance
[2:32] to singing and to music as God has his
[2:35] instruments and God sings and Christ
[2:37] sings on earth and God uh habit inhabits
[2:41] the praises and the singing of his
[2:43] people. We even saw and I'll read it
[2:46] maybe here in a moment how that for
[2:48] Israel their music was a point of
[2:50] national pride even in uh ancient
[2:54] history and throughout time the the the
[2:57] tradition Hebrew tradition of music was
[2:58] right up there with Greek music and
[3:00] their contributions to music. So too to
[3:03] the Hebrews to the Jews, they music was
[3:05] very important to them. And the
[3:07] statement that we ended on from birth
[3:09] pains on Sunday was how the in the
[3:12] preview of the bride, brother Benham
[3:14] gives that uh preview, that vision that
[3:16] he has several times there, uh we see
[3:19] that the bride was introduced by music
[3:21] and he identifies as a a sweet music,
[3:23] sweetest he'd ever heard. But then on
[3:25] the other side in contrast to that the
[3:28] uh the the church where the nominal
[3:31] world the worldly churches are
[3:33] introduced and each one is identified by
[3:37] music.
[3:38] So one was dancing to the beat he said
[3:40] of rock and roll the other one was
[3:42] marching in steps. So there's maybe a
[3:44] different style, a different emphasis, a
[3:46] different sound and that motivates and
[3:48] moved the false church. But then you
[3:50] hear this sweet music coming and this
[3:52] onward Christian soldiers and then there
[3:54] was a they're all lined up perfectly
[3:56] walking in harmony in step with the
[3:58] word. So I think that's the the vision I
[4:00] have before me as we look in these
[4:02] things. But just to add a little bit
[4:04] more to what we read on Sunday from this
[4:08] uh this fictional account which was a
[4:11] defense of Judaism and how this king had
[4:13] asked you know about these contributions
[4:16] of uh Judaism to the sciences and to
[4:19] knowledge and one in particular was
[4:20] music. And this rabbi says, "Music was
[4:23] the pride of a nation which distributed
[4:25] their songs in such a way that they fell
[4:27] to the lot of the aristocracy of the
[4:29] people, the Levites, who made practical
[4:32] use of them in the holy houses and in
[4:34] the holy season." And then this is the
[4:36] part that uh continue with for their
[4:38] maintenance. They were satisfied with
[4:40] the tithes as they had no occupation and
[4:42] this is but music. We saw how in the
[4:45] scripture prophecy was associated with
[4:47] music. The Levitical office of
[4:49] prophesying uh was associated with some
[4:51] talents and gifts in music. He says as
[4:53] an art it is highly esteemed among
[4:56] mankind. And I want you to catch this.
[4:58] As long it is as it is not abused and
[5:01] degraded and as long as the people
[5:04] preserves its original nobleness and
[5:06] purity. It says David and Samuel were
[5:08] its great masters. So here in the Hebrew
[5:11] tradition and as it's summed up here
[5:13] just in this account that we've been
[5:15] using and reading or that we've used
[5:16] once and now using again and reading to
[5:18] you that as an art music was highly
[5:20] esteemed as long as it's not degraded or
[5:23] perverted that it needed to be kept in a
[5:25] certain nobility or purity and says that
[5:28] Samuel and David were great masters of
[5:31] music and that art of music. So this is
[5:34] the the Jewish idea and attitude towards
[5:37] music. And we see that uh from the Bible
[5:39] that God appreciates and values music
[5:42] according to Acts chapter 13 verse 10 as
[5:45] Paul said, "Oh full of all subtlety and
[5:47] all mischief, thou child of the devil,
[5:49] thou enemy of all righteousness." Here's
[5:51] this principle that is true in any
[5:54] context. The attribute of Satan is wilt
[5:57] thou not cease to pervert the right ways
[5:59] of the Lord?
[6:01] ask a rheto rhetorical question which
[6:03] stands for the proposition that Satan
[6:05] will never stop perverting God's right
[6:08] ways. He'll never stop doing it. So then
[6:11] we could see that music can be degraded
[6:13] or abused. It can be manipulated. It can
[6:15] be misused. It can otherwise be
[6:18] perverted from God's pure and original
[6:21] or represented in a way that God didn't
[6:23] originally represent it. We say, "Well,
[6:24] music's of God. Therefore, any music is
[6:26] godly." We can't make that mistake.
[6:29] Yeah,
[6:29] but we know God dwells in, rejoices in,
[6:31] and loves music. And that's this all for
[6:35] all the same reasons that Satan wants to
[6:37] pervert it.
[6:39] So there's something um there's
[6:40] something about that mechanism or that
[6:43] art. So with music's momentum, I'm using
[6:46] momentum as defined as some a moving
[6:49] power, an impulse or an impelling force.
[6:52] That would be my idea of momentum. So
[6:55] there's power or strength or energy.
[6:57] Music's energy. It's its power or its
[7:00] strength. It's impelling force. So
[7:02] there's a force behind music and it's
[7:05] one reason why God loves it. But it's
[7:07] also the reason why Satan wants to
[7:09] manipulate it and use it for himself.
[7:12] So music's momentum, its energy can
[7:14] produce an effect in a person or on a
[7:17] person or on an atmosphere. In 2
[7:20] Chronicles 5:es 12, 13, and 14, this
[7:24] kind of um joins well with a lot of the
[7:27] scriptures from Sunday, also the
[7:28] Levites, which were the singers, all of
[7:30] them of Asaf and of Hean and of
[7:32] Jedithan, with their sons and their
[7:34] brethren, being arrayed in white linen,
[7:36] having symbols in sultre and harps,
[7:38] stood at the east, entered the altar,
[7:40] and with them 120 priests sounding with
[7:43] trumpets. So notice this Levitical band,
[7:45] this Levitical choir as they have their
[7:47] instruments, they have their chorus,
[7:49] they have their trumpets, they're all
[7:50] singing here, this moment of great uh
[7:54] glory in the temple. And it came even to
[7:57] pass as the trumpeters, notice this uh
[8:00] uh this characteristic. I think this is
[8:02] important. The trumpeters and singers
[8:04] were as one
[8:06] to make one sound. So it was there was a
[8:10] combining of we can read here of at
[8:12] least four different types of sounds
[8:14] sulturies, symbols, harps, trumpets and
[8:17] then amongst those they could be playing
[8:19] different uh parts. Uh they could be
[8:22] playing on in a in a different tone but
[8:26] yet they all work together to make one
[8:29] voice or one sound. They were as one to
[8:33] make one sound to be heard in praising
[8:35] and thanking the Lord. And then it says,
[8:36] "And when they lifted up their voice
[8:39] with the trumpets and symbols and
[8:41] instruments of music and praised the
[8:43] Lord, saying, for he is good and his
[8:46] mercy endureth forever." So now we have
[8:48] this great chorus singing and playing.
[8:53] The voice is identified as the singers,
[8:57] the trumpet, the symbols, the
[8:59] instruments, the music are all kind of
[9:01] combined in that thought of a voice. And
[9:04] they're singing this. It says that then
[9:06] the house was filled with the cloud,
[9:08] even the house of the Lord, so that the
[9:10] priest could not stand to minister by
[9:12] reason of the cloud, for the glory of
[9:14] the Lord had filled the house of God. As
[9:17] we read this, there's only there's
[9:19] there's one outstanding event that takes
[9:21] place right before the glory of God
[9:23] fills the house of the Lord. And it's
[9:25] these Levites in their position
[9:28] exercising their gifts. each one in
[9:31] particular staying in his lane and
[9:33] playing his part that causes the glory
[9:35] of God to come so much that it's as a
[9:38] cloud filled the temple.
[9:40] The glory of the Lord filled the house
[9:42] of the Lord when they lifted up their
[9:44] voice and played their instruments. And
[9:47] it wasn't just the uh the sound of any
[9:50] uh it wasn't just any message, but they
[9:52] praised the Lord saying, "He's good and
[9:53] his mercy endureth forever." Right?
[9:55] So now that's uh that's one component I
[9:58] want you to hold very close to you that
[10:00] you see these people and their position
[10:02] in this order and arrangement of music
[10:03] brought the power of God or the presence
[10:05] of God.
[10:06] In 1st Samuel chapter 10 5 and 6 you
[10:10] find as we read in the ordination of the
[10:13] Levites and their musical offices. It
[10:15] said that they prophesied by their music
[10:16] and their instruments. And here we see a
[10:19] very similar wording and this is about
[10:21] Saul uh being anointed to be king and
[10:24] about his coming to the throne and God
[10:26] speaking to the him being told what he
[10:29] shall expect to come to pass after that
[10:31] shall come to the hill of God where is
[10:34] the garrison of the Philistines. And it
[10:35] shall come to pass when thou art come
[10:38] thither to the city that thou shalt meet
[10:40] a company of prophets coming down from
[10:43] the high place with a sultry and a tabet
[10:46] and a pipe and a harp before them and
[10:48] they shall prophesy. So here's a company
[10:51] of prophets who are coming down and they
[10:53] all are carrying with them instruments.
[10:56] They're carrying with them musical
[10:57] instruments. And it says, "And the
[10:59] spirit of the Lord will come upon thee,
[11:01] and thou shalt prophesy with them and
[11:03] shalt be turned into another man."
[11:07] These instruments, I believe, are
[11:09] mentioned because it was part of their
[11:10] ministry. It was part of even their
[11:12] prophesying in some way that they were
[11:14] able to use it and God was able to
[11:16] anoint it in this particular instance
[11:17] with Saul that with them playing their
[11:20] instruments together they prophesied and
[11:22] the spirit of the Lord comes upon Saul
[11:25] and it changes him into another man. And
[11:29] what's what's unique about this is that
[11:31] when the spirit of the Lord or the
[11:32] anointing came upon David, God didn't
[11:34] have to change him into another man
[11:36] because he had a heart that could be
[11:37] changed. So he didn't have to give him
[11:39] another spirit as he does Saul there. So
[11:41] there's the problem with Saul is through
[11:43] this prophesying and even this music an
[11:46] anointing come can come on him to make
[11:48] him another man to give him another
[11:51] spirit another disposition.
[11:53] Now remember that as we'll come back to
[11:55] the book of Samuel. Now in 2 Kings 3
[11:58] 12-16 this may be one of the more
[12:01] familiar ones uh that you all are very
[12:03] familiar with. says, "And Jehoshaphat
[12:05] said, the word of the Lord is with him."
[12:07] So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat
[12:10] and the king of Edom went down to him.
[12:11] So now they're coming to the prophet.
[12:13] And Elisha said unto the king of Israel,
[12:15] "What have I to do with thee? Get thee
[12:18] to the prophets of thy father and to the
[12:20] prophets of thy mother." And the king of
[12:22] Israel said unto him, "Nay, for the Lord
[12:24] hath called these three kings together
[12:26] to deliver them into the hand of Moab."
[12:28] And Elisha said, "As the Lord of hosts
[12:31] liveth before whom I stand, surely were
[12:34] it not that I regard the presence of
[12:36] Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, I would
[12:39] not look toward thee, nor see thee." So
[12:42] now he's there's something that's
[12:44] disturbing him about the wickedness of
[12:46] Jehome. And and so there's he's
[12:49] disturbed by it. If it wasn't for the
[12:51] presence of Jehoshaphat, I I wouldn't
[12:54] even look at you. And as they're
[12:56] requiring something from him, as they're
[12:58] looking to him, he's he'll have a word
[12:59] of the Lord. He can prophesy for us.
[13:01] Notice in verse 15, he says, "Bring, but
[13:04] now bring me a minstrel.
[13:07] Bring me one who is gifted, who is able
[13:09] to sing and to play a musical
[13:12] instrument. My mind is disturbed. I I
[13:15] need my spirit to be settled." And so he
[13:17] asked for one who could play music and
[13:19] sing. And it came to pass when the
[13:21] minstrel played, maybe harping on his
[13:24] harp, maybe his voice, whatever
[13:25] instrumentation he might have had, that
[13:27] as he's playing, it says the hand of the
[13:29] Lord came upon him. And this is not the
[13:32] minstrel, but rather Elisha, and he
[13:34] said, "Thus saith the Lord, make this
[13:37] valley full of ditches." That's right.
[13:39] Notice how Jehovah's power, the handle
[13:41] of Jehovah's power comes on Elisha after
[13:44] he requested a minstrel, a man who could
[13:46] sing and play to play music to be
[13:49] played.
[13:50] And as that music is playing, the the
[13:53] power of God comes upon Elij Elisha and
[13:57] he begins to prophesy, thus sayeth the
[13:59] Lord. Now, as we saw uh salt tries and
[14:02] tabs and pipes and harps with the
[14:04] prophets who prophesy over Saul, we see
[14:07] them even being played in Chronicles as
[14:09] the power of God comes into the
[14:11] tabernacle. Here we see a prophet asking
[14:14] for someone to come and play music
[14:16] before he can have the word of the Lord.
[14:18] Right?
[14:19] it. Yet, it's important for us to take
[14:22] away from this that the the prophecy,
[14:24] the the the gift of prophecy is a
[14:26] divinely ordained gift.
[14:29] And that gift of prophecy wasn't subject
[14:31] to human music.
[14:33] He he didn't need the music to be
[14:35] inspired. He didn't need the music uh
[14:37] necessarily for the gift in him to be
[14:40] anointed or of God, but the music was
[14:42] used to set his human spirit right.
[14:46] It was used to kind of get his mind off
[14:49] of the wickedness that was grieving his
[14:50] heart. And this is his attitude. You
[14:52] know what? If it wasn't for King
[14:53] Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even look at
[14:56] you.
[14:57] I wouldn't even think about you.
[14:59] So, somebody play me a good song. I need
[15:02] to hear some good music right now
[15:03] because I'm not in a good mood. And if
[15:06] you want to hear from God, something's
[15:07] going to have to change,
[15:09] right? I'm not too happy right now. And
[15:12] so, he calls for music. God is obviously
[15:14] I I I say obviously and and maybe I
[15:16] could tread a little bit lightly here,
[15:17] but it appears as if God is pleased when
[15:20] his spirit is made right and then the
[15:22] gift can speak.
[15:24] The music composed his spirit,
[15:26] changed the atmosphere around him.
[15:30] It didn't anoint the gift as it were,
[15:32] but it helped make way for it.
[15:35] Brother Bamin, the sermon leadership
[15:37] says, "I like good singing. I just love
[15:40] real good singing." So there's your your
[15:42] your spectrum. You're maybe tedious to
[15:44] some, but it's I like good singing, but
[15:47] I love real good singing.
[15:50] So there's your there's the things he
[15:52] likes good and he loves real good. He
[15:54] says, I've always said when I get to
[15:55] heaven, I want to go where they're
[15:57] singing and listen.
[15:59] I never could get my feel of singing.
[16:03] You know, he says this is he says, you
[16:06] know, singing gives courage. Amen.
[16:09] The soldiers when they're going to
[16:11] battle, you know what they do? They play
[16:12] music and sing. And that things to give
[16:15] them courage. And when we're going to
[16:18] battle, we sing. And it gives us courage
[16:21] to go on.
[16:22] Here's brother Random identifying not
[16:24] only his love for music and how it
[16:26] seemingly cannot exhaust his passion for
[16:29] it or his attention uh for it, but he
[16:31] says that singing actually gives
[16:35] encouragement. that through song one can
[16:38] be lifted up. They can be uh uh uh
[16:40] caused to be happy. We play music, he
[16:43] says, and when going out to war, and it
[16:46] makes us courageous. And he says, we as
[16:48] Christians when going to battle, we
[16:49] sing. Now, we're not whistling through a
[16:52] graveyard and it's not timid and and
[16:54] it's not I sure hope we make it back.
[16:56] Hope we survive. No, it's it is a chorus
[17:01] and a song of confidence and praise that
[17:04] lifts up our spirits.
[17:05] Amen.
[17:06] Now we read a moment ago how Saul had to
[17:08] be given another spirit and he beakes he
[17:11] becomes a different man and as he as he
[17:14] is changed into another man through the
[17:16] music and the spirit of prophecy. It
[17:19] says here in 1st Samuel chapter 16 14 15
[17:23] 16 and 17 and this is the result of his
[17:27] own disobedience and sin. It says but
[17:29] the spirit of the Lord departed from
[17:30] Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord
[17:33] troubled him. I remember this question
[17:36] in particular as I began to serve the
[17:38] Lord and was listening to the message. I
[17:40] came across this. I just remember
[17:41] writing it down. What in the world does
[17:42] this mean? And he he repeats it again
[17:45] later that there's an evil spirit from
[17:47] the Lord. And I remember saying, I sure
[17:48] wish I could know the answer to this.
[17:50] And within a very short time, Brother
[17:51] Brams asked the very specific question
[17:53] and he answers it. And so it was greatly
[17:55] encouraging to me that I know that God
[17:57] has these answers. So says, "The spirit
[17:59] of the Lord departed from Saul and an
[18:01] evil spirit from the Lord troubled And
[18:03] you might be saying, "Well, what's the
[18:04] answer?" Well, you just keep listening.
[18:05] You'll hear it. I mean, not to me.
[18:06] Listen to Brother Brandham. You'll hear
[18:08] it. And Saul's servant said unto him,
[18:10] "Behold now, an evil spirit from God
[18:13] troubleth thee. Let our Lord now command
[18:16] thy servants which are before thee to
[18:18] seek out a man who is a cunning player
[18:21] on a harp." This is their attitude. Let
[18:24] us find someone skilled, someone who
[18:26] knows how to play beautifully. They know
[18:29] the metabolism of the of music. He says,
[18:31] "And it shall come to pass," this is
[18:33] just an affirmative absolute statement.
[18:35] "It shall come to pass when the evil
[18:37] spirit from God is upon thee, that he
[18:40] shall play with his hand, and thou shalt
[18:41] be well."
[18:42] It's quite a statement as they are
[18:44] acknowledging that the trouble has been
[18:46] allowed by God, or God has allowed this
[18:48] evil spirit to come upon Saul. But they
[18:50] are, if if you want to say, conjecturing
[18:52] or believing that one who could play
[18:54] music will actually cause that spirit to
[18:57] dissipate. And so Saul said to his
[18:59] servants, "Provide me now a man that can
[19:01] play well and bring him to me."
[19:03] Remember, Brother Brandham liked good
[19:04] singing and really loved real good
[19:06] singing
[19:07] or just loves really good singing. So
[19:09] now he wants a man that can play well.
[19:12] And if I could say this, music's effect
[19:15] upon the body and the mind is is
[19:18] documented without uh with throughout
[19:20] history.
[19:21] It's been observed throughout time
[19:24] in this time in particular. And I I to
[19:28] maybe to some extent it's still maybe a
[19:30] commonly held belief but widely believed
[19:32] that music had this mysterious influence
[19:35] on healing mental disorders.
[19:38] In 1650 a Jesuit published this book in
[19:42] the classic Latin. You'll see it on this
[19:44] t this slide here. It's called the
[19:46] universal
[19:48] musical art or the great art of
[19:50] consonants and dissonance. If I'm not
[19:52] mistaken, one time I was in an an
[19:55] antique store that specialized in old
[19:56] books and I believe I came across a copy
[19:58] of this and I really wish I would have
[20:00] sprung for it because in retrospect I
[20:02] don't know that it was too expensive.
[20:03] Right, brother Micah? You can't pay too
[20:05] much for a really good first edition
[20:06] book. These things are done very
[20:08] beautifully. But this is in the 1600s,
[20:11] 1650. It's kind of a compendium of
[20:13] ancient and contemporary thinking about
[20:15] music. There's a lot even in the Hebrew,
[20:17] a lot in the Greek. And it's it was
[20:19] bringing together just so much from
[20:21] nature in the mathematics. It's broke up
[20:24] in I think maybe 11 or 12 chapters. And
[20:26] it was looking at the production of
[20:28] music and the effects of music upon a
[20:30] person. It connected the mathematical
[20:32] properties of music. Hence the
[20:34] consonants and the dissonance or the
[20:35] harmony and dissonance together. And it
[20:38] was looking at these mathematical
[20:40] properties and its effect on health and
[20:43] rhetoric, the mind, the intellect.
[20:46] And so in this and I could read to you
[20:48] just a litany of examples that are
[20:50] elicited in this and then subsequently
[20:52] documented in other places that music
[20:54] was believed to be the cure for diseases
[20:57] because it was music that precipitated
[21:00] uh the the healing or the cure. They saw
[21:03] this with those who were bit by had were
[21:05] inflicted with the venom from snakes or
[21:07] bit by spiders or even and this is maybe
[21:09] some people want to write this down.
[21:10] They even found where music eased the
[21:12] sciatica
[21:14] or sciatic pain and everyone's like I'm
[21:17] going to get my sciatica playlist
[21:18] together
[21:21] and so it this this particular really
[21:25] indepth overview of music and this was
[21:29] this uh this was a Jesuit he's actually
[21:31] would be titled with father he's a
[21:33] Christian he believed in these Christian
[21:34] principles and he looked at this and it
[21:37] was showing and portraying Music is not
[21:40] just entertainment but as a literal
[21:43] healing force
[21:45] capable of purging physical poison or
[21:48] restoring one's mental balance.
[21:51] And I know you're thinking,
[21:54] but remember uh the article in 1964
[21:59] where and now I'm forgetting the
[22:01] publication where they were the the
[22:04] publicist for the Beatles was saying
[22:06] people were throwing away their crutches
[22:08] and the crippled were running to the car
[22:11] in Paris at Gaul. And he said the only
[22:14] thing left for the Beatles to do now is
[22:16] to go on a healing tour.
[22:19] And so there is p we see the power in
[22:22] that. So then we could see we say well
[22:24] that's a that's a devil that heals. He
[22:25] cast out be elab. Well no let's not make
[22:28] that mistake.
[22:29] But this is one particular instance and
[22:32] just stay close. I I know uh maybe you
[22:35] know I I' I've accepted this a long time
[22:37] ago. My my the manner in which I preach
[22:39] isn't for everybody. And everybody here
[22:40] may be like that's me. And yet you're
[22:43] just good Christians and you're obeying
[22:44] the Lord and this is the best you can
[22:46] get. Some of you might call this
[22:48] halfloaf tabernacle. I don't know. Uh uh
[22:51] but
[22:53] there's uh I want you to really focus on
[22:56] this and listen because I this is I'm
[22:58] going to back this up through the word
[23:00] of God, but this is an observation. It's
[23:02] ancient. It's an old observation. I say
[23:04] ancient. Uh but here from this one this
[23:08] writer, he says, "In one village, we
[23:10] found a young man in a frenzy. They're
[23:12] traveling to another country struck down
[23:14] by madness.
[23:16] He seized a drum and struck it with
[23:19] uncanny skill. His hands and feet moving
[23:22] as though the rhythm itself soothed his
[23:24] tormented spirit.
[23:28] Bit by bit, his ears yielded to the
[23:30] beat.
[23:32] Soon his head, hands, and feet quivered.
[23:35] Then he sprang into a full dance. Just
[23:38] try to get the visual image. This is one
[23:40] who is mentally ill. Maybe crazy
[23:42] talking. A and he's one that they
[23:44] recognize as being stricken with some
[23:47] sort of madness. And he grabs a drum and
[23:49] he begins to play it with skill. And as
[23:51] he begins to play it with this rhythm,
[23:54] his body begins to come and get into the
[23:57] rhythm of it. And he's in full dance.
[23:59] When the display grew almost comical,
[24:01] the drummer abruptly ceased.
[24:04] The youth, stunned and beereft of sense,
[24:08] collapsed into stuper.
[24:11] Yet the moment the familiar rhythms
[24:13] resumed, he revived, leapt to his feet,
[24:16] and danced again with renewed frenzy.
[24:20] Now this is the power of music. This is
[24:22] the momentum in music. People believe
[24:25] and experience confirms that the venom
[24:27] once spread through the body is drawn
[24:29] out and exhausted by the power of
[24:31] harmony and collective singing.
[24:34] And he says, "A remnant of poison clings
[24:37] until new sound of music seizes them
[24:40] again, convulsing mind and body until
[24:44] the final trace of venom is expelled."
[24:47] Now, could you just kind of apply that
[24:49] spiritually
[24:51] to how that music
[24:54] that was originated even the tabs and
[24:57] the design and the idea of worship and
[24:59] music as it was inherent in Lucifer.
[25:03] now spreads through humanity through
[25:05] Cain and his seed. What what what is
[25:08] injected into it? A serpent's venom,
[25:11] right? And now it is in this particular
[25:14] experience they see that and this is way
[25:16] they're surmising that here is somebody
[25:18] who's been bit by a snake or has this
[25:20] venom from a tarantula and they and by
[25:22] playing music through this certain
[25:24] rhythm a and response to it that
[25:27] eventually the the the prison or the the
[25:29] effects of the poison or the venom
[25:31] subsides and they're well. and they're
[25:34] just conjecturing, well, perhaps it's
[25:36] that there's some expulsion of the venom
[25:41] as they exercise themselves according to
[25:43] music.
[25:45] And as this young person possessed with
[25:47] madness begin to play the drums and
[25:49] begin to dance, he says right before it
[25:51] gets comical, they're just slain. They
[25:53] stop playing. But then as soon as the
[25:55] music starts again, they get right back
[25:57] into a dancing and this renewed frenzy.
[26:01] But once the poison wears off, notice
[26:03] it's a poison. It's a venom. It's not a
[26:07] it's not a blessing or a benefit. Once
[26:08] it wears off, there's no longer there's
[26:11] there's no movement to that music. Now,
[26:14] I think this requires your your own
[26:17] thinking and your own uh asking the Lord
[26:20] to open this up to you. Now, let's let's
[26:23] apply it this way. And the sermon this
[26:25] day this scripture is fulfilled. Brother
[26:28] Bam said the Pentecostal church is in a
[26:29] Leodysian condition. As a matter of
[26:31] fact, brother Banham says Leodysia is
[26:34] Pentecost.
[26:36] It is 100%. So if we're not being
[26:39] restored to that Pentecost,
[26:41] but that is certainly the Pentecost
[26:43] we're going beyond,
[26:44] right?
[26:44] And so there is a Pentecostal idea of
[26:47] the message that is just absolutely
[26:49] less. Still blind,
[26:51] still naked,
[26:53] still convulsing to rock and roll. So
[26:55] the Pentecostal church is in a led to
[26:57] seeing condition. Oh, they still jump
[26:59] and holler and carry on. When the music
[27:01] is beating, when the music stops beating
[27:05] or the beatnick's music music some of
[27:07] them play and calling it Christianity
[27:10] and whenever that stops, all the glory
[27:12] is gone.
[27:14] Just like this one who's been inflicted
[27:16] with this venom. Just like the one who
[27:18] has a spirit of madness upon him. As
[27:20] long as the drum is beating, there's
[27:21] some animation. There's some excitement.
[27:23] There's some response to the musical
[27:25] stimulus. But as soon as the music
[27:27] stops, just a stuper,
[27:31] there's no longer there's no longer the
[27:33] same enthusiasm.
[27:38] And where I just say this, I don't often
[27:41] maybe pull back the curtain, but for
[27:43] maybe for the sake of some people that
[27:44] struggle in these things,
[27:47] where I learned of this book from the
[27:51] 1650s was by reading a commentary that
[27:54] brother Brandham read and had in his
[27:55] library. That's very likely brother
[27:58] Brham
[28:00] used even this example. I'm I'm just I'm
[28:02] just speculating, but I just follow his
[28:05] fingerprints. Just follow his footsteps.
[28:08] Get I want him to get into the rhythm of
[28:11] the message of God in the rhythm and the
[28:13] harmony. Not the optics of it, not the
[28:15] lip service to it, but get in the
[28:17] harmony and the beat of it, the rhythm
[28:19] of it.
[28:20] Says if it's a real praise of God, then
[28:22] there isn't enough whistles and enough
[28:24] power in the world to stop it. When it
[28:26] really comes from God, it don't take
[28:28] music to beat up.
[28:30] It takes the spirit of God to come down
[28:31] on it. That's what does it. Amen.
[28:34] So we can see that as humans are
[28:37] concerned based upon their observation
[28:39] and I would say speculation that an
[28:41] individual who is either has a mental
[28:43] disorder or some sort of physical malady
[28:45] whether it be a venom or some sort of
[28:47] poison that music had a healing effect
[28:50] on them that possessed with madness or
[28:54] having some sort of mental or physical
[28:56] illness, music could purge it from them
[28:58] and drive it away from them. And now and
[29:01] they observe dancing and frenzy and
[29:02] association to it. Brother Brandham
[29:04] saying look at the power of music to
[29:05] make someone dance and the power of
[29:07] music to make someone shout and dance
[29:09] around with the the beaten nick music as
[29:11] they say. They call it Christianity. He
[29:12] says but as soon as the music stops he
[29:14] says the gloryy's gone
[29:16] because it's part of their formula.
[29:19] It's part of their emphasis. It's their
[29:22] major.
[29:24] They want to major on the minor things.
[29:26] They want to major on the music. They
[29:28] want to major on the healing. They want
[29:29] to major on the mood.
[29:32] And so when those things aren't working
[29:34] just right, then they're just in a
[29:35] stouper or a malaise.
[29:39] So with the power of music,
[29:44] as it's said here in 1st Samuel 16, you
[29:46] can say, "Well, that was a that was a
[29:48] lot of uh history there and a a good
[29:50] statement from Brother Brandon." But
[29:51] really, we could just take 1st Samuel 16
[29:53] and see that the king's servants at
[29:55] least thought that someone who knew how
[29:56] to play a harp could drive away an evil
[29:59] spirit that God had allowed to come. But
[30:02] remember, Saul, who received a good
[30:04] spirit from the playing of music and
[30:07] prophesying. Now, through his own
[30:09] disobedience, has lost that
[30:12] and is being tormented by an evil
[30:13] spirit.
[30:14] So, there's some history in Saul's life
[30:16] that he is susceptible to in a good and
[30:19] bad way. You could say even to music is
[30:22] a tendency. Many people are different.
[30:24] There's some who could walk into a a
[30:26] restaurant and hear music playing and
[30:28] they don't even know what it is. Doesn't
[30:30] even bother them. They don't care. And
[30:31] somebody else hears it and they start
[30:32] going,
[30:35] right? They go, "Oh, listen to that
[30:36] song. Woo." And they start dancing and
[30:37] they, "Oh, excuse me. Sorry." Because
[30:39] there just some people may have that
[30:41] tendency.
[30:43] So in 1st Samuel chapter 16 22 and 23 we
[30:46] kind of begin to see the conclusion or
[30:49] the unfolding of this incident with Saul
[30:52] and Saul sent to Jesse because they say
[30:53] hey there's one who plays who's got
[30:55] quite the testimony and gift David let
[30:57] David I pray thee stand before me for
[30:59] heath found favor in my sight and
[31:01] there's a lot going on here there God is
[31:05] raising up David and he's you
[31:08] causing things to happen in his life to
[31:10] get him very near Saul and gaining
[31:13] confidence with the court and those
[31:14] around Saul because God has a purpose
[31:17] for it. God has a purpose for David. I
[31:19] think it's good to remember that these
[31:21] things are just like, "Oh, what a wild
[31:22] coincidence." It's not a wild
[31:24] coincidence. God had ordained this
[31:26] little kid
[31:27] to be king.
[31:28] And that's how he can orchestrate
[31:30] events. So, he's showing up here. He's
[31:31] showing up there and he's showing up
[31:32] here
[31:33] because God was going to raise him to
[31:34] the throne. So it came to pass when the
[31:37] evil spirit from God was upon Saul,
[31:41] God allows this evil spirit that David
[31:43] took a harp and played with his hand. So
[31:46] Saul was refreshed and was well and the
[31:49] evil spirit departed from him. Josephus,
[31:52] that great uh Jewish historian said that
[31:55] uh David would sang hymns and psalms. So
[31:58] he made use of both his vocalization and
[32:01] instrumental music.
[32:03] And Saul, as David played, think of
[32:05] this, the the the actual
[32:09] chain of events as described by the
[32:11] scripture, God let Saul be tormented by
[32:14] an evil spirit.
[32:16] Saul asked for David to come and play
[32:19] music. And David playing music causes
[32:22] this evil spirit that God allowed to go
[32:25] away.
[32:28] And Saul becomes cheerful. His gloomy
[32:30] depression is relieved. is he's cured of
[32:32] his melancholy as it were.
[32:35] And so therefore, we could see that
[32:37] David's music
[32:39] is is more than just natural
[32:43] that God was ending it with a blessing.
[32:45] God was blessing it. He was giving it
[32:46] power
[32:50] and it healed and relieved
[32:53] Saul. And the sermon looked, Brother
[32:55] Bram said, there's nothing like music.
[32:57] That's quite a statement. There's
[32:59] nothing like music.
[33:02] God heals by music. He says, "Do you
[33:04] know that
[33:05] God heals by music?
[33:09] God does. God is the only healer."
[33:12] There's ways that God God heals by
[33:14] medicine.
[33:15] How is it that a doctor can set a bone,
[33:18] but God heals it? because something
[33:20] inherent in the body
[33:22] that God has put there that works
[33:24] according to the character and nature of
[33:25] God where God heals by music. In other
[33:30] words, music is a medium that God uses
[33:33] just as he could use medicine
[33:36] and God having made man the way that he
[33:38] made him. God himself has harps. God
[33:41] himself loves to sing. God himself uh
[33:43] dwells in music. And so man made
[33:46] originally in the image of God has a has
[33:49] natural channels that are inherently
[33:52] influenced by music.
[33:55] It's one reason why God uses it, but
[33:57] it's also the reason why the devil wants
[33:59] to use it.
[34:01] There was even one who testified on
[34:03] Sunday after we brought up this subject
[34:06] and their testimony to my wife was uh
[34:08] and this is the this is even the power
[34:09] of preaching. After they preached the
[34:11] sermon on wasteland, they left feeling
[34:13] like nothing but a waste. It's power of
[34:16] words, right? And so feeling a little
[34:18] bit discouraged and down, but in the
[34:19] course of their week, they listened.
[34:21] They heard the song, I am redeemed,
[34:24] bought with a price, and immediately
[34:26] that that wasteful feeling was gone.
[34:29] What was God doing? Testifying even
[34:30] beforehand
[34:32] before we even get into this and even
[34:33] before I got to the subject uh uh
[34:35] Wednesday night on the power of music
[34:39] to set our minds right and our emotions
[34:43] right. The song didn't make this person
[34:46] redeemed,
[34:47] right?
[34:48] The song didn't save them.
[34:50] But it was able to restore in their
[34:52] their spirit back to that right position
[34:54] that I am divinely ordained.
[34:58] Just as Elisha had the gift to prophesy
[35:00] and his spirit wasn't right. The music
[35:02] didn't restore the gift of prophecy. It
[35:05] cleared out the clouds that would that
[35:06] would hinder it.
[35:10] Music can heal. Music has great power.
[35:16] For those who are wondering how I would
[35:18] use whatever kind of mental and
[35:20] spiritual gymnastics I would use to work
[35:22] in Genesis 11, we've arrived.
[35:26] In Genesis 11:1,
[35:29] it says, "And the whole earth was of one
[35:31] language and of one speech."
[35:40] If you take this and you look at it from
[35:44] the standpoint of how the Levites
[35:47] and and I'm kind of already adding in
[35:49] some things that you know based upon
[35:51] what we'll read here in a moment how
[35:53] that they were as one to make one sound
[36:00] and here the whole earth and when it
[36:01] says the whole earth is speaking of
[36:03] humanity Gentiles mankind nations was of
[36:06] one language and one speech
[36:09] And it kind of paints an image of a
[36:11] unified voice where you could have this
[36:14] harmonious choir or chorus where
[36:18] everyone's perfectly tuned. They know
[36:19] their part. They know what one another's
[36:21] saying. It's this choir with perfect
[36:22] harmony. It's like an orchestra
[36:24] performing in unison. This is a this is
[36:26] a musical picture that's painted even in
[36:28] these words that are used it. But here
[36:31] it intimates an evil symphony, a
[36:34] symphony of evils that that of mankind
[36:38] rebelling against God. So even though
[36:41] there's one language in one speech, we
[36:43] say, "Oh, they're harmonizing it. I it
[36:46] it it's everything's working together.
[36:48] There's one one course, one body, but
[36:51] it's to perform wickedness through their
[36:53] rebellion against God."
[36:55] So in verse six it says and the Lord
[36:57] said behold the people is one and they
[37:00] have all one language
[37:03] and this they begin to do. This is in
[37:05] the building of the tower and now
[37:07] nothing will be restrained from them
[37:09] which they have imagined to do.
[37:12] So, under the influence of this
[37:16] evil harmony, this illtimed, this
[37:19] inharmonious, though it has its own
[37:20] harmony, this this anti-God arrangement,
[37:24] the Bible tells us, if you read more of
[37:26] this, that those who are tuned to this
[37:30] this wicked symphony are moved, it says,
[37:34] from the east. So, we know this is
[37:35] man-made religion.
[37:38] We know this is a religious move. We
[37:40] know then that there's a we could we
[37:42] could just say it that there's there's a
[37:44] there's a beat to it.
[37:47] Just as rock and roll is animating the
[37:49] Leodysian church here in the in the
[37:51] genesis of Babylon and Babylonian
[37:54] worship. And we see music featured
[37:56] prominently in Babylonian worship
[37:58] according to scripture. We see that they
[38:00] were of one language and one speech.
[38:04] Perhaps they were singing as they worked
[38:07] and they all had their own chorus. They
[38:10] had their own song and as they as they
[38:12] sung it, they worked on this tower. So
[38:15] under the influence of this, those who
[38:17] were har in harmony with it are moved.
[38:21] A and they're not moved out of order and
[38:23] chaotically, but there was a certain
[38:26] harmony of each individual. Each
[38:28] individual is not disjunctive. They're
[38:30] each one have there's a harmony and
[38:32] connection with the entire body of
[38:34] humanity because it says the whole earth
[38:35] was of one language and one speech
[38:37] and they were moved they were influenced
[38:39] they went in this movement to build this
[38:42] tower.
[38:45] I read this statement in a commentary on
[38:47] these scriptures of
[38:50] uh in early
[38:52] uh early AD said, "Folly is to the
[38:56] wicked man the beginning of his energy
[38:58] and the works which are contrary to
[39:00] nature."
[39:02] Won't fit on a bumper sticker really,
[39:04] but I like that. Folly is to a wicked
[39:07] man the beginning of his energy. What
[39:10] was this music? It was foolish.
[39:12] What was this tune? It was foolish. What
[39:13] were they undertaking? foolishness, but
[39:15] it's the the beginning of his energy and
[39:17] works that are contrary to what is
[39:19] right.
[39:23] So, Genesis 11:5 and they said, this is
[39:26] their this is what God is interrupting
[39:29] in verse 6. He says, "And they said, go
[39:30] to let us build us a city and a tower."
[39:35] A tower is a platform, a stage.
[39:37] Right?
[39:38] They wanted a city, but now they wanted
[39:40] a platform.
[39:41] Yeah.
[39:41] They wanted a gathering. They wanted a
[39:43] collection, but now they want a
[39:44] platform. They want to raise it. Whose
[39:46] top may reach unto heaven, and let us
[39:49] make us a name.
[39:52] And almost as it were, they knew what
[39:54] they were doing, lest we be scattered
[39:56] abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
[40:00] This building upwards, it's an
[40:02] elevation. This is the original
[40:03] elevation worship.
[40:06] It's building upwards. And this building
[40:09] upwards is a false worship. Yeah.
[40:12] And it what because even in if you look
[40:13] at it they're going to build a a ga
[40:15] there's a gathering and now there's a
[40:16] stage and now it's going to ascend and
[40:19] it parallel par parallels this
[40:20] worshipful ascent as praises ascend as
[40:23] prayers ascend as incense ascends. The
[40:26] raising up of this is a prideful ascent.
[40:30] It's not giving honor to God. It's
[40:31] rebelling against God.
[40:33] So in in building the tower of babel is
[40:36] an image of all false worship. It's an
[40:39] image of all of the wrong kind of praise
[40:41] and incense and and energy and
[40:44] excitement
[40:45] that people want to claim to give to
[40:48] God.
[40:52] Genesis 11:9.
[40:56] It says, "Therefore is the name of it
[40:58] called Babel." Because God said the
[41:01] people are one. There's nothing. I guess
[41:02] I forgot to emphasize this in that
[41:04] harmonious arrangement
[41:07] arranged against God. God acknowledges
[41:09] there's nothing they can't do.
[41:11] There's the power of harmony.
[41:13] There's the power of the mathematical uh
[41:15] relationship between harmony and
[41:18] discordance.
[41:20] There's the way that you can use music
[41:21] that might have certain tones, but when
[41:23] combined to another one, those things
[41:25] that may seem to be discordant only give
[41:27] more energy.
[41:29] And the way that the chorus and the
[41:30] composition can build, it's what I call
[41:33] a rock trick. In other words, there's
[41:36] ways that songs can be written that you
[41:38] just can build the human just kind of
[41:40] gets in the flow of it.
[41:41] A and the next thing you know, they're
[41:43] over there going, "Wow,
[41:45] glory to God,
[41:47] right?"
[41:48] Because of the bridge
[41:51] and the draw down and the octave change
[41:55] and somebody gets all excited and they
[41:57] say, "Man, I'm telling you what, Jehovah
[41:58] came today, didn't he?" Like, no, no,
[42:00] that's Shane and Shane.
[42:04] They know how to get They know how to
[42:05] get a hook in there.
[42:08] It's an understanding. They say, "Well,
[42:10] does that mean it's all bad?" No, it's
[42:11] just there. It's natural.
[42:12] It's part of the way you're wired.
[42:15] The the way that you're wired as a human
[42:16] is one of the reasons why you can just
[42:18] sit here and listen to me speak.
[42:21] It's part of the way God made us.
[42:24] Though it may be natural, there's a way
[42:25] that God can supernaturally use it.
[42:28] So therefore, the name of it is called
[42:30] Babel because the Lord did there
[42:33] confound the language of all the earth.
[42:36] I want you to see how there's something
[42:38] at least a parallel symbolism of music
[42:40] in this. And from then did the Lord
[42:42] scatter them abroad upon the face of all
[42:44] the earth. God's divisions of languages
[42:48] inserts this this complete discordance
[42:51] in what was a unified chorus
[42:55] and what was a one language and one
[42:57] speech, one voice, one sound. Now God,
[43:00] when he inserts this uh uh this division
[43:04] of languages, they could they couldn't
[43:06] find their harmony,
[43:07] right?
[43:08] They couldn't figure out a way to fit. I
[43:10] don't know what you're playing. I don't
[43:11] know what you're saying. I don't know
[43:12] where you're going. I don't know what
[43:13] key this is in.
[43:15] And they all found themselves, as maybe
[43:16] a musician would say, in the cracks. I
[43:19] can't find what key he's singing in.
[43:22] God had interrupted their music, their
[43:25] unified chorus.
[43:28] And Babel itself means mingled,
[43:30] confused, or confounded. It means a
[43:32] confused medley of sounds.
[43:35] Because if you don't know what someone
[43:37] is saying, it may could to you just
[43:39] sound like a a medley of sounds arranged
[43:43] together.
[43:46] Back in the 60s, I believe it was when
[43:48] American
[43:50] uh certain style of American music was
[43:53] extremely popular. It was sweeping all
[43:54] over Europe. There was an Italian who
[43:57] recorded a song that became, I think,
[43:58] number one on the Italian charts. I
[44:00] wasn't there. I don't didn't just
[44:02] reading this from history. who composed
[44:04] a lengthy disco song or whatever in
[44:06] nothing but babble.
[44:08] There was no English words at all, but
[44:10] he made it sound like English. And the
[44:12] Italians loved it,
[44:15] thinking it was English, but it was
[44:16] nothing but a bunch of intelligible
[44:18] sounds and a medley of sounds put to
[44:21] music and people bought it.
[44:25] This is the the image of a false use of
[44:29] music,
[44:31] but it shows the momentum and the power
[44:33] of music. God heals by music,
[44:36] but there's a
[44:38] there's a rhythm. There's a momentum
[44:42] that works against God's word. John 4:es
[44:46] 20 to 24. Try to wrap this up for us
[44:48] here. Our fathers and this woman at the
[44:51] well is Samaritan as he is she is
[44:55] responding our fathers the Samaritans we
[44:57] worshiped in this mountain and ye say
[44:58] that in Jerusalem is the place where men
[45:00] ought to worship so here's this division
[45:03] there's this disharmony
[45:05] there's this inongruence and there's
[45:07] such a kind of a unique position of the
[45:10] Samaritans versus the Jews and they have
[45:13] their way of worship and even to what
[45:15] they believe the true God but the Jews n
[45:17] we don't have anything to do with you
[45:18] you guys aren't like us. Uh we have our
[45:21] place of worship and we do it in
[45:22] Jerusalem, but the Samaritans worshiped
[45:24] in this mountain. Jesus said,"Woman,
[45:26] believe me, the hour cometh when you
[45:28] shall neither worship in this mountain
[45:30] nor yet at Jerusalem.
[45:32] You that you shall neither in this
[45:34] mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship
[45:35] the father." Then he makes this very
[45:39] profound statement. You worship what you
[45:42] don't know.
[45:44] We know what we worship. Yeah.
[45:46] So there's his response to her. You
[45:48] worship in a mountain to a god you don't
[45:50] know.
[45:51] Hasn't made himself known to you. You're
[45:53] you don't fully can't fully follow him
[45:54] because he hasn't fully revealed
[45:55] himself. He says, "But we know what we
[45:57] worship
[45:58] for salvation is of the Jews. But the
[46:01] hour cometh and now is." Love it. When
[46:05] the true worshipper shall worship the
[46:07] father in spirit and in truth. For this
[46:11] father seeketh such to worship him. God
[46:14] is a spirit
[46:16] and they that worship him must worship
[46:20] him in spirit and in truth.
[46:25] In other words, if we could just look at
[46:26] it from the standpoint of the Samaritan,
[46:28] he says, "You worship
[46:30] and you may be able to worship a and be
[46:33] animated and you may be able to worship
[46:34] and be fervent and you may have spirit."
[46:36] And I'm just going to even use C a
[46:38] lowercase spirit. But you could worship,
[46:41] but you don't know what you worship.
[46:44] And he says, "Now a man, we must come.
[46:46] And now is the time when you worship
[46:48] him, not just in your sincerity and your
[46:50] ferveny and your dedication and all your
[46:52] animation and all your effort, but it
[46:54] has to be in truth.
[46:56] There has to be knowledge of what you're
[46:57] doing.
[46:58] It can't just be a wholly giving
[47:00] yourself over to emotion. It can't be
[47:02] wholly giving yourself over to
[47:03] intellectualism, which is the other side
[47:05] of emotionalism. It's the same evil
[47:08] twin.
[47:09] Emotionalism and intellectualism are the
[47:11] same thing.
[47:13] And so, it's not just giving yourself
[47:14] over to one or the other. And it's not
[47:16] just this uh spirit of enthusiasm, this
[47:18] frenzy or this energy, but it must be in
[47:21] spirit and truth.
[47:23] The Samaritans worship without truth or
[47:25] knowledge. What we know is that God's
[47:29] word is truth.
[47:31] And that true worship must be according
[47:33] to God's composition. It must be in its
[47:35] season. It must be in its time.
[47:38] Must be according to God's timing. It
[47:39] must be according to God's rhythm. It
[47:41] can't be human.
[47:43] It was human in Genesis 11. It was human
[47:45] with the Samaritans.
[47:49] It's human.
[47:51] It was human in Babylon
[47:54] with the Hebrew children being forced to
[47:56] bow down and worship the image of a
[47:58] prophet. What were they going to use to
[47:59] accomplish it? music.
[48:03] That's how many of the false moves today
[48:07] are initiated and started.
[48:09] It's got music.
[48:12] And the emphasis and the polishing
[48:16] is in the music,
[48:18] not the word.
[48:21] I'll close with this statement. Our
[48:23] musicians can come to their their places
[48:27] skillfully. Please play.
[48:30] drive away any hindering spirits
[48:34] in God's chosen place of worship.
[48:36] Brother Bam said there's only one place
[48:37] that spiritual death cannot strike.
[48:40] That's the word. I I have mentioned
[48:43] through the last few services at least
[48:45] uh to listen to shalom. Uh there's a
[48:48] couple of them and some other sermons.
[48:49] And so I trust that at least somebody
[48:51] has because you'll see even though I
[48:54] haven't quoted from it, this statement
[48:55] here fits perfectly with what he's
[48:58] preaching there.
[48:59] which if you listen to shalom's a lot of
[49:01] emphasis on the day we're living in what
[49:03] God is doing you know the the the
[49:06] revelation of Jesus Christ today
[49:08] while the church is in gross darkness
[49:11] Christ has risen in the midst of the
[49:12] church
[49:13] he is now it is the rising of the sun
[49:15] it's the unveiling of God it is the
[49:17] revealing of the son of man so many
[49:19] things that could be said about it and
[49:21] then it's at the end that he begins to
[49:23] break into the concept of the symphony
[49:28] and Brother Brandham, just I'll just
[49:30] open the floor. Can anyone tell me which
[49:32] musical composition Brother Brandham
[49:34] uses as his example?
[49:36] Peter and the Wolf.
[49:39] And there's something about that
[49:40] composition
[49:42] that is an that speaks specifically to
[49:45] the time we're living in now
[49:48] because there's a ways that there's a
[49:49] way that music can be arranged. There's
[49:52] a way that music can be moved or used to
[49:55] cause movement. It's got a compelling
[49:57] force. But brother Brandham picked one.
[50:00] I'll try to bring this out Sunday
[50:01] morning. He picked one that pushes aside
[50:04] all movements
[50:06] and identifies the momentum of God's
[50:08] word. And so what he says here in God's
[50:11] chosen place of worship, there's only
[50:12] one place spiritual death cannot strike.
[50:14] That's the word. Death can't strike the
[50:16] word because it's the living word of
[50:17] God. But when you put creeds with it,
[50:20] the word moves out to itself.
[50:23] It'll separate like water from oil. You
[50:27] cannot mix it together. This calls to
[50:30] mind the time I say this as a warning to
[50:33] to young people to all of us that there
[50:35] could be a really good Christian song
[50:38] and then somebody by the name of eight
[50:42] dollar sign checkum checkum
[50:45] does a hip-hop mix to it and you're
[50:47] thinking, "Oh, neat. Shane and Shane
[50:49] released a new song and yet it's been
[50:51] remixed
[50:53] and they add a house beat to it or they
[50:56] do a autotune. So now it's Shane Shane
[50:59] and Sheny and it's something totally
[51:02] different.
[51:04] And so there's a there's a a mixing a
[51:08] hybrid. And he says once you put Creeds
[51:10] into it and you mix it up, that's a
[51:12] remix.
[51:13] That's not the original.
[51:16] That's just a cover. Yeah,
[51:18] brother Michael and I are collecting a
[51:20] list of good cover uh cover band names
[51:23] and every once in a while I drop him in
[51:24] a service and he's the only one that
[51:26] knows he just mentioned a cover band.
[51:29] And that's what a lot of churches can
[51:30] become. That's not the message. That's a
[51:33] message cover band.
[51:35] That's that's not that's not the
[51:37] original arrangement. That's not with
[51:39] one voice. That's their own sound to it.
[51:43] He says it'll separate like water from
[51:44] oil. cannot mix it together. So it
[51:46] remains pure. So if you have something
[51:48] mixed, it's no longer original.
[51:50] Therefore, you see when the creed comes
[51:51] into a denomination, they all go after
[51:53] the creed and the word dies out and it
[51:57] goes on with somebody else and increases
[52:00] it more. It's a denomination that dies
[52:02] out. The word moves on. He says picks up
[52:05] the momentum
[52:07] as it goes from justification,
[52:09] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[52:11] Ghost, and on into the grain. What is
[52:14] that? Jesus Christ himself.
[52:16] The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[52:18] It picks up momentum.
[52:20] Notice it's momentum, not movement.
[52:24] It's momentum. He says, "Do you see the
[52:28] path God has trod?
[52:31] Can you find his step? Can you find his
[52:35] rhythm, his beat?" He says, "Do you see
[52:37] the path God has tried?" The word picks
[52:39] up momentum as it goes. Do you see the
[52:41] path he's trod bringing his name all the
[52:44] time right down the same way? Because he
[52:45] is the word, it can't die. The word of
[52:48] life can't die.
[52:51] We preach to you about music and we give
[52:53] you some maybe uh some technical history
[52:57] about music or certain aspects about
[52:58] music. It's only done to show you in the
[53:01] type of what music can be in the
[53:02] natural. God's word is his composition
[53:07] which he has arranged for a specific
[53:09] purpose. And you have a part to play in
[53:13] God's arrangement. And he is directing
[53:16] you.
[53:18] And he's wanting to direct you so that
[53:19] you can fit into this great chorus of
[53:21] the bride who sings in this end time
[53:23] with one voice and one sound.
[53:26] For she knows the sheep music. She has
[53:28] the mind of Christ.
[53:30] And that's why there's times when she
[53:32] keeps still.
[53:34] That's why there's times when she's sh
[53:36] silent because she knows it's not my
[53:38] moment to sing just yet.
[53:42] She's not playing out of tune. She's not
[53:45] playing from some other part. Though we
[53:47] may individually do that at times, our
[53:49] desire is to get in line.
[53:51] Get back in step. And that's why we have
[53:54] brother Bam uses that analogy of a
[53:55] director. Get back in step.
[53:58] Let's stand to our feet.
[54:00] Let's pray together this evening. Our
[54:02] gracious heavenly father, Lord, as this
[54:04] service comes to its close, as we've
[54:07] covered yet again a lot of a lot of
[54:09] ground in this subject,
[54:12] and Lord, I know that all year we've
[54:14] been very perseverant to labor
[54:17] in a subject matter that's unique.
[54:22] But Lord, I believe that you can take
[54:25] uniqueness
[54:28] and you can use it to reach into hearts.
[54:33] And I trust that we can tonight just
[54:35] give great consideration to in the sense
[54:38] of what music holds and what it can do.
[54:41] The sense of what
[54:44] music can how it can move and impel us
[54:48] in ways that are not righteous or holy.
[54:50] ways that it can affect our moods.
[54:53] Ways that music can plant seeds or draw
[54:55] lead us astray.
[54:58] Ways in which music can become prideful.
[55:00] It lifts up man. It lifts up talent. It
[55:02] lifts up gifts. It lifts up debauchery
[55:05] and perversion and all sorts of filth.
[55:08] And it becomes nothing more than another
[55:10] tower of babel.
[55:12] Lord, we must realize also in a way that
[55:15] Christian Christian music, Christianity
[55:17] has can
[55:19] grab a hold of music and use it in a way
[55:21] that's not originally pure. I believe
[55:24] there needs to be a sensitivity to that.
[55:28] And though music can be used as
[55:30] entertainment,
[55:32] it should be treated as all
[55:34] entertainment.
[55:35] We must be careful with it,
[55:38] must be discerning with it.
[55:41] And just as one might
[55:44] enjoy listening to the old
[55:48] orchestras or marches composed of ages
[55:51] ago and it relaxes them and they enjoy
[55:54] it recreationally
[55:56] and there there could be a maybe just a
[55:59] natural harmonizing through those
[56:01] things. We need to be so careful what we
[56:03] tune our spirits to.
[56:07] And Lord, yes, there's so much that I
[56:09] intend and just feel burdened to share
[56:11] on the subject of music as it relates to
[56:13] our spiritual walk with you and the
[56:15] sanctification of our hearts and minds.
[56:18] But Lord, maybe the the best way to
[56:21] address that is for us to become so
[56:25] uh become more diligent in your music,
[56:28] the music of your word.
[56:30] Not that we would try to hunt down, you
[56:32] know, vinyls of the the believers and
[56:35] the Cochman family and the aunts
[56:38] brothers and just try to build a
[56:39] database of, you know, real sanctified
[56:42] Holy Ghost message written music, but
[56:44] get into the message.
[56:46] Get into the word.
[56:48] Find that heartbeat of the composer. Get
[56:50] to know his mind.
[56:53] Find that rhythm and that beat of the
[56:54] word of God. And surely Lord, if we take
[56:57] heed to your to your word, it'll cleanse
[56:59] our ways.
[57:01] It'll measure us where we become a
[57:02] little bit too excessive. It'll moderate
[57:05] us in areas where we've become too
[57:07] slack. Lord, it'll actually add to and
[57:10] embellish areas where we become very
[57:11] weak. I play pray Lord that you would
[57:14] help us in these things. I trust that
[57:16] this this subject matter is not lost on
[57:19] anyone's ears or in anyone's hearts. And
[57:21] father, I just believe it has to be you
[57:22] that does that.
[57:25] As the enemy would fight this with
[57:26] everything that's in him, may we even
[57:28] more fervently fight
[57:32] back to hold on to every word of God to
[57:34] believe it. Take into our bosom and say
[57:38] amen to it. We love you. We ask these
[57:41] things tonight as we pray a blessing
[57:42] upon your people in Jesus name. Amen.
