[0:00] So 1st Samuel 28 6 to verse 20. And when
[0:05] Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord
[0:06] answered him not, neither by dreams, nor
[0:09] by yim, nor by prophets. Then said Saul
[0:12] unto his servant, seek me a woman that
[0:14] hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to
[0:16] her and inquire of her. And his servant
[0:19] said to him, Behold, there is a woman
[0:21] that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.
[0:23] And Saul disguised himself and put on
[0:25] other raignment. And he went and two men
[0:27] with him. And they came to the woman by
[0:29] night. And he said, I pray thee divine
[0:31] unto me by the familiar spirit. Bring
[0:33] him up whom I shall name unto thee. And
[0:36] the woman said unto him, Behold, thou
[0:38] knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath
[0:40] cut off those that have familiar
[0:41] spirits, and the wizards out of the
[0:43] land. Wherefore then layst thou a snare
[0:45] for my life to cause me to die? And Saul
[0:48] swear to her by the Lord, saying, As the
[0:50] Lord liveth, there shall be no
[0:51] punishment happen to thee for this
[0:53] thing. Then said the woman, "Whom shall
[0:55] I bring unto thee?" And he said, "Bring
[0:57] me up Samuel." And when the woman saw
[1:00] Samuel, she cried with a loud voice, and
[1:02] the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why
[1:04] hast thou deceived me, for thou art
[1:06] Saul? The king said unto her, Be not
[1:08] afraid, for what sawest thou? And the
[1:10] woman said unto Saul, I saw gods
[1:12] ascending out of the earth. And he said
[1:14] unto her, What form is he of? And she
[1:16] said, An old man cometh up, and he co is
[1:19] covered with a mantle. And Saul
[1:20] perceived that it was Samuel. And he
[1:22] stooped with his face to the ground and
[1:24] bowed himself. This this is such a
[1:26] remarkable circumstance, especially this
[1:29] part. And Samuel said to Saul, "Why hast
[1:31] thou disqued me to bring me up?" And
[1:34] Saul answered, "I am sore distressed,
[1:36] for the Philistines make war against me,
[1:38] and God is departed from me, and
[1:40] answereth me no more, neither by
[1:42] prophets, nor by dreams. Therefore I
[1:44] have called thee, that thou mayest make
[1:46] known unto me what I shall do." Then
[1:48] said Samuel, Wherefore then dust thou
[1:50] ask of me, seeing the Lord has departed
[1:52] from thee, and has become thine enemy?
[1:54] And the Lord hath done to him, as he
[1:56] spake by me, the Lord hath rent the
[1:58] kingdom out of thine hand, and given it
[2:00] to thy neighbor, even to David, because
[2:02] thou obeyest not the voice of the Lord,
[2:04] nor executed his fierce wrath upon him,
[2:06] Amalecch. Therefore hath the Lord done
[2:08] this thing unto thee this day. Moreover,
[2:11] the Lord will also deliver Israel with
[2:12] thee into the hand of the Philistines.
[2:14] Tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with
[2:16] me. The Lord shall deliver the host of
[2:18] Israel into the hand
[2:21] uh into the hand of the Philistines.
[2:23] Then Saul fell straightway all along the
[2:26] earth and was sore afraid because of the
[2:28] words of Samuel and there was no
[2:30] strength in him for he had eaten no
[2:32] bread all the day nor all the night.
[2:35] Amen. You can be seated.
[2:38] I know that is probably a familiar story
[2:40] to many of you in terms of Saul going to
[2:42] consult with the witch of Indor. as the
[2:44] Bible says, one with familiar spirits.
[2:47] And you'll probably already make the
[2:49] connection right away, but my title this
[2:51] evening is modern mediums.
[2:53] And I'm using this in a way that's
[2:55] hopefully thoughtprovoking uh modern
[2:58] mediums. We've just uh preached three
[3:00] services in a row ourselves on praying
[3:03] on ignorance, which emphasized the
[3:04] importance of prayer, and then we spoke
[3:06] on the deformation of character uh which
[3:09] emphasized the necessity to read our
[3:11] Bibles. And then we dealt with poison
[3:14] and how that the devil would want to
[3:15] poison us even against the message of
[3:17] the hour. And there's a way that he
[3:19] tries to keep us from strengthening
[3:21] ourselves by the word of God. So Satan
[3:24] is definitely looking for an exploitable
[3:27] disadvantage. It's a disadvantage to us,
[3:29] but it's an advantage that he takes. And
[3:32] so on this subject of modern mediums, I
[3:34] believe this to be another important
[3:36] subject. It's capturing on a lot of the
[3:38] momentum that we've been expressing in
[3:40] terms of seeds being sewn and what it
[3:42] produces. And it is a subject that's
[3:44] very relevant to modern conditions.
[3:46] God's been dealing with my heart uh for
[3:49] quite a while on certain things. And
[3:51] you'll find find maybe towards the end
[3:52] you'll see that I kind of was setting
[3:54] some things up even in the last sermon
[3:56] on poison. So modern mediums is our
[3:59] title. I want to give a definition of a
[4:02] medium. A medium in general, I'd like
[4:04] you to think of it this way. It's a
[4:06] method or way of expressing something.
[4:08] So, a medium is a way things are
[4:10] expressed. A method away or way of
[4:13] expression in art. Uh, a medium could be
[4:16] the physical material that is used to
[4:18] create a work. Paint would be a medium.
[4:20] And clay or or marble, some way that
[4:23] something is made that would be
[4:24] considered uh a medium or it can just be
[4:27] the type of art itself. And you have
[4:29] different arts as far as painting,
[4:31] sculptures, uh even those things we
[4:33] mentioned there, print making. So it's
[4:35] that form used by an artist, a composer
[4:38] or a writer. Those are all terms that we
[4:39] would use for mediums. And I want you to
[4:41] think of those particular constructs or
[4:43] use of that word because it's relevant
[4:46] to the overall subject. When we think of
[4:48] in terms of art and art itself being a
[4:51] medium, it conveys information. Uh it
[4:54] conveys meaning. It's used to express
[4:56] something. And art therefore is a source
[4:59] of inspiration and even influence. You
[5:02] look at art, it's a form of expression.
[5:04] Brother Bam teaches us that behind
[5:06] everything there's a spirit motive and
[5:07] objective. And it may seem to be odd to
[5:10] think, well, behind everything and yes,
[5:12] behind everything there's a spirit
[5:13] motive and objective. And so mediums are
[5:17] even just outside of that form of art.
[5:19] If you're saying a method or way of
[5:21] expressing something, it's a they're an
[5:23] agency or means of doing something. You
[5:26] got the a medium of radio or television,
[5:28] some sort of broadcasting or print.
[5:30] Those are mediums. And then a medium is
[5:33] the intervening substance through which
[5:35] impressions are conveyed to the senses.
[5:37] So that's what a medium can we use it in
[5:39] those sense. So it's through that
[5:41] channel through that way that something
[5:43] has been conveyed to me. Something's
[5:45] been impressed upon my senses. Now if
[5:48] you look at 1st Samuel chapter 28, we
[5:50] look at the witch of indoor. This is
[5:52] another way that we could use this term.
[5:54] One with a familiar spirit could be
[5:56] called a medium. And that's one that
[5:59] communicates between the living and
[6:01] dead. And so if this sounds very
[6:03] appropriate for Halloween, I think it
[6:05] does because we could say this would be
[6:08] the witch of indoor. And she is uh she
[6:11] is one that communicates to the living
[6:14] uh between the living and the dead. So
[6:16] she's a medium uh because she's going to
[6:19] be the source through which something is
[6:22] conveyed and impressed upon the living.
[6:24] Now if we look at verse six, we'll just
[6:26] start in verse six. Maybe we'll read a
[6:28] little bit more before this as we have
[6:30] it here before us again familiar subject
[6:33] but very uh very feel very heavy to
[6:36] impress some things upon us tonight. And
[6:38] when Saul inquired of the Lord the Lord
[6:40] answered him not so he's needing
[6:42] something from the Lord and he doesn't
[6:44] speak to him in a dream nor through the
[6:46] urthuman or by the prophets. Then said
[6:48] Saul unto his servant seek me a woman
[6:50] that hath a familiar spirit. I it's
[6:53] interesting that he says seek give me a
[6:55] woman that hath a familiar spirit. You
[6:57] find even brother Brandham points out
[6:58] that women are more susceptible to these
[7:00] types of spirits. And so that puts a a a
[7:05] female a woman in this category of being
[7:07] more sensitive or or subject to these
[7:11] types of influences. Says that I may go
[7:13] to her and inquire of her. And his
[7:15] servant said to him, "Behold, there is a
[7:17] woman that hath a familiar spirited
[7:18] indoor." And Saul disguised himself and
[7:20] put on other raignment. And he went and
[7:22] two men with him. And they came to the
[7:23] woman by night. He said, "I pray thee
[7:25] divine unto me by the familiar spirit,
[7:27] and bring me him up whom I shall name
[7:30] unto thee." And the woman is very quick
[7:32] to say, "We've been banned. We've been
[7:34] outlawed to do this." And he's uh Saul
[7:37] has cut off all familiar spirits and the
[7:39] wizards out of the land. So now we have
[7:41] witches and wizards. What a service.
[7:44] And and he says, she says, "You're
[7:46] trying to cause me to die." But in verse
[7:48] 10, Saul swears by the Lord that as the
[7:50] Lord liveth, there'll be no punishment
[7:51] happen to you. So she says, "Who do you
[7:53] want me to bring up? Who is this that
[7:55] you want me to conjure up?" And she he
[7:58] says, "Uh, he says," Samuel. But when
[8:00] she sees Samuel, she's horrified because
[8:03] she says, "I see gods coming from the
[8:06] earth." And he says, "Describe to me who
[8:07] it is that you see." But he says, "Why?"
[8:10] She says, when she sees Samuel, she
[8:12] says, "Why have you deceived me? For
[8:14] thou art Saul." So there has been in
[8:18] this instance and to me it just shows
[8:20] there's so this remarkable truth because
[8:22] we say oh well there's no such thing as
[8:23] a soussayer there's no such thing as a
[8:25] wizard there's no such thing as a medium
[8:27] well if you believe your Bible
[8:29] &gt;&gt; right if you believe your Bible there's
[8:31] some uh concept of one who can uh
[8:34] communicate between here the living and
[8:37] the dead or communicate from the dead to
[8:39] the living
[8:41] and and able to find these spirits in a
[8:44] realm that's unseen and be this channel
[8:47] through which information can be
[8:49] conveyed to those who can see, those who
[8:51] can hear, those who are breathing, those
[8:52] who were eating. And that's what Samuel
[8:55] Saul was trying to do. And notice if you
[8:58] look at verse three, the reason why Saul
[9:00] was doing this, it says, "And Samuel was
[9:02] dead and all Israel had lamented him and
[9:04] buried him in Rama, even in his own
[9:06] city. And Saul had put away those that
[9:08] had familiar spirits and the wizards out
[9:10] of the land." So the wizards are
[9:12] banished, the witches are banished, but
[9:15] yet notice he comes later and he wants
[9:17] to uh seek one. And the timing, I
[9:21] believe the scripture just mentions it.
[9:23] The timing here is very interesting.
[9:24] This is in chapter 28 and it's telling
[9:26] us that he's banished these. And it
[9:28] speaks again to Saul's character, how uh
[9:30] he has banished them, but now he wants
[9:32] to take advantage of him of them. But in
[9:35] chapter 15, when he is disobedient, what
[9:38] is it that Samuel said to him? He said
[9:40] Saul rebellion is as the sin of
[9:42] witchcraft. Showing in Saul's character
[9:45] that he was easy to condemn others for
[9:47] what they would do but not hard on
[9:49] himself when he would sin. And he says
[9:51] your rebellion against God is as the
[9:52] very things that he had outlawed. And in
[9:56] doing that, think of that that rebellion
[9:58] is as the sin of witchcraft that there's
[10:01] there there's some relationship between
[10:03] sorcery and witchcraft and these wizards
[10:06] and rebellion.
[10:09] And so this is him who has banned them
[10:11] out of the land. It's kind of called out
[10:13] for as well your rebellion is just as
[10:16] bad as these other things. But then it
[10:18] says in verse four, "And the Philistines
[10:19] gathered themselves together and came
[10:21] and pitched in Shunim. And Saul gathered
[10:23] all Israel together and they pitched in
[10:25] Gilboa. And when Saul saw the host of
[10:27] the Philistines, he was afraid and his
[10:29] heart greatly trembled." This is a time
[10:32] of crisis.
[10:34] In this time of crisis, he seeks God.
[10:36] God won't answer him. He seeks the pro.
[10:39] There's no prophets. He seeks the yarn
[10:40] thumin. He's trying to find an answer.
[10:43] And when he couldn't get an answer, I
[10:45] want you to think about this and I don't
[10:47] necessarily have an explanation for it
[10:49] because we can say, "Well, God's not
[10:50] answering him. What do you want him to
[10:51] do?" When he couldn't get an answer from
[10:53] those channels that we know God works
[10:55] through, he actually consulted the dark
[10:57] arts
[10:58] &gt;&gt; to try to hear from God.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; He instead of just saying, "Lord, you
[11:02] won't speak to me. Lord, I repent."
[11:04] instead of maybe being honest and
[11:06] saying, "Well, the reason why uh he
[11:07] hasn't spoke to me is because I I I have
[11:10] sinned and it through his humility could
[11:12] say," Lord, I know you've left me and
[11:14] you've banished me and the kingdom is
[11:16] going to be rent for me, but Lord, for
[11:17] the people's sake, for those that would
[11:20] fight, those that would lose their lives
[11:22] for for MY SON'S SAKE, LORD, what should
[11:24] I do in this particular instance?" But
[11:26] once again, Samuel just can't or Saul
[11:28] cannot just cannot humble himself.
[11:32] So he consults what the Bible says here
[11:35] is a woman with a familiar spirit
[11:38] and this is contrary to God's
[11:40] commandment. If you look at Deuteronomy
[11:41] chapter 18, we'll read verses 9 to4.
[11:44] Then we'll pick up and read all the way
[11:46] to verse 22. When thou art come into the
[11:48] land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,
[11:50] thou shalt not learn to do after the
[11:52] abominations of those nations. So there
[11:55] was culture and habit and things that
[11:58] these other nations did that God uh
[12:02] disdained or hated. Not things that was
[12:04] just different than Israel culturally
[12:06] but things that were an abomination to
[12:09] God. And because of the it says for all
[12:11] the that do these things are an
[12:13] abomination unto the Lord. Notice where
[12:16] this abomination rest and who it is to
[12:19] it is the Lord. and be and so he says
[12:22] there verse 10 there shall not be found
[12:25] among you anyone that maketh his son or
[12:27] his daughter to pass through the fire.
[12:29] This is a very direct reference to maybe
[12:31] a tradition a ritual that these heathen
[12:33] nations would do or that useth
[12:35] divination or an observer of times or an
[12:39] enchanter or a witch.
[12:41] You think about these uh these
[12:43] definitions, these headers or a charmer
[12:46] or a consulter with familiar spirits or
[12:48] a wizard or a necromancer.
[12:51] There's a list of things that God is
[12:53] saying you're going to find these in
[12:54] these cultures. You're going to find
[12:55] them in their religions. You're going to
[12:57] find them common amongst people. But he
[12:59] says that they shall not be found among
[13:01] you. Nor should we use these things. For
[13:04] all, verse 12, that do these things are
[13:06] an abomination of the Lord. And because
[13:08] of these abominations, the Lord thy God
[13:10] doth drive them out from before thee.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; God is going to drive out anyone who
[13:17] practices these things, these other uh
[13:19] uh other gods, these other sources of in
[13:22] uh influence. And then verse 13, thou
[13:24] shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.
[13:28] That kind of raises the stakes, but why
[13:29] is God wanting to draw them out? Because
[13:31] he wants the people to walk before him
[13:33] perfectly. Wants them to trust in him.
[13:35] wants them to hear from him and know his
[13:37] voice. For these nations, verse 14, for
[13:40] these nations which thou shalt possess,
[13:42] hearken unto observers of times and unto
[13:44] divers. But as for thee, the Lord thy
[13:46] God hath not suffered thee so to do.
[13:48] Notice even in how God expresses this,
[13:50] it said, "These people did not have a
[13:53] relationship to God. They did not have
[13:55] profits when they should have known me
[13:56] and should have sought after me and
[13:58] should have seen me in nature." No,
[13:59] they've sought after their own
[14:00] inventions and they formed themselves
[14:02] their own idols. and they've come to
[14:04] believe that these lifeless things speak
[14:06] to them. He says, "These work in these
[14:09] realms and hearken unto observers of
[14:12] times and under divers, but you you're
[14:14] not like that. God speaks to you. I have
[14:18] not suffered ye to use these things."
[14:21] And so the Lord is warning them, if I
[14:23] could just use this phrase collectively
[14:25] of the observers of times and the
[14:27] enchanters and the witch and the charmer
[14:29] consult with familiar spirits and the
[14:30] wizard or necromancer, just call them
[14:32] mediums. He has warned them about these
[14:35] mediums of these other religions and
[14:38] societies.
[14:39] And this verse says that God hath not
[14:41] suffered thee so to do. I'm warning you
[14:44] about the observance of times and divers
[14:46] and all these mediums. Verse 15, the
[14:48] Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a
[14:50] prophet from the midst of thee of thy
[14:51] brethren like unto me. Unto him shall ye
[14:54] hearken.
[14:56] Now notice just it's such a an
[14:58] interesting thing. All these divers and
[15:01] mediums and enchanters. He says, "But
[15:03] that's not the way that you're to get
[15:04] your information or inspiration.
[15:07] But I will give you a prophet according
[15:09] to all that thou desireest to the Lord
[15:11] thy God and Horeb in the day of the
[15:12] assembly, saying, Let me not hear again
[15:14] the voice of the Lord my God, neither
[15:15] let me see this great fire anymore that
[15:18] I die not." And so God said, the Lord
[15:20] said unto me, they have sp well spoken
[15:22] that which they have spoken. I will
[15:24] verse 18, raise them up a prophet from
[15:26] among the brethren, like unto me, and I
[15:28] will put words in his mouth, and he
[15:30] shall speak unto them all that I shall
[15:31] command him. And it shall come to pass
[15:33] that whosoever will not hearken to my
[15:35] words which shall he shall speak in my
[15:36] name, I will require it of him.
[15:41] It's telling us that God according to
[15:43] Israel's own desire will use prophets
[15:46] like Moses. And if you look into the
[15:48] Bible and the history, Samuel's the one
[15:50] first one that God raises up after
[15:52] Deuteronomy 18. God raises him up as a
[15:55] prophet who he's going to put words in
[15:57] his mouth and he let nothing that he
[15:58] said fall to the ground. So, in this one
[16:01] reading in Deuteronomy chapter 18, it's
[16:03] very interesting uh uh and to put these
[16:06] together and read them side by side, the
[16:08] devil uses mediums, God uses prophets.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; That there's people that will seek for
[16:14] information through these particular
[16:15] channels to hear from God, to know what
[16:18] to do, to find truth, all these
[16:19] different ways. And God is saying that
[16:21] it ought not to be that way for you
[16:23] because I have given you an order and a
[16:26] way to know truth.
[16:29] And I I think there's more that we could
[16:31] say on that. Uh but let's let's just
[16:33] leave it there as a component of what
[16:35] we're trying to build to tonight. So God
[16:37] was very deliberate or p purposeful in
[16:40] establishing this protective boundary
[16:42] for Israel. You're going to go in,
[16:44] there's going to be these other nations
[16:45] and they have different practices in
[16:46] different ways. And you may see that
[16:48] they can actually get information
[16:49] correctly. You may see that they have
[16:51] certain things that they do that can be
[16:53] very wowing or or very useful. But he's
[16:56] SAYING THAT'S NOT HOW I want to deal
[16:57] with you. So he's warning them in
[17:00] Leviticus 19:es 30 and 31. Ye shall keep
[17:03] my Sabbath Sabbaths and reverence my
[17:05] sanctuary. I am the Lord. He says,
[17:07] "Regard not them that have familiar
[17:09] spirits, neither seek after wizards to
[17:11] be defiled by them. I am the Lord your
[17:13] God." So we should not regard them. Have
[17:16] respect or fear them that have familiar
[17:18] spirits. Though they may be able to
[17:20] operate in what? In certain realms or
[17:22] ways, don't have fear or regard for
[17:24] them. Neither seek after wizards. I know
[17:27] you're all going to want me to preach a
[17:28] sermon on wizards or wizardry, but he's
[17:31] saying that you should not seek after
[17:33] them, to desire them, to inquire of
[17:34] them, uh to be defiled by them. Now,
[17:38] that's the PART WHERE IT'S LIKE, OKAY,
[17:40] all right. Thanks for peeling back the
[17:42] curtain. Defiled means to be made
[17:44] unclean,
[17:46] that you lose your purity, that you are
[17:49] a sanctified person. You've been set
[17:51] aside. You you are the temple of the
[17:53] Holy Ghost. and and God's wanting to
[17:55] motivate you and move you and cause you
[17:57] to to live a particular way. And he's
[17:58] saying there's things that you can seek
[18:00] after. God had called Israel by name.
[18:02] He's leading them. He's feeding them.
[18:04] He's guiding them. He's given them all
[18:05] these rules and regulations in the Old
[18:07] Testament to keep their minds and their
[18:08] bodies clean. He's wanting to lead them
[18:10] to the promised land. HE SAYS, "DON'T
[18:12] HAVE FEAR OR RESPECT FOR those who have
[18:14] familiar spirits. Don't seek after
[18:15] wizards because they will make you
[18:17] unclean."
[18:19] So, it is the nature of these mediums to
[18:22] be a corrupting influence.
[18:25] They are, and I hope you can catch this
[18:27] part. We're making great time. We're not
[18:28] going to be very lengthy tonight.
[18:29] Actually, matter of fact, not are we not
[18:31] going to be very lengthy, we probably
[18:32] won't be lengthy at all. Famous last
[18:34] words.
[18:36] But there are sources of darkness that
[18:38] defile our minds,
[18:40] &gt;&gt; that are going to burden our hearts or
[18:43] or muddy up our our spirits.
[18:47] God is not just SAYING, "WELL, I DON'T
[18:48] LIKE the competition." And he wants a
[18:50] monopoly on telling the uh telling the
[18:52] future. He's saying, "No, these defile
[18:55] your conscience."
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Levitic Leviticus 20:6, "And the soul
[19:00] that turneth after such have as have
[19:02] familiar spirits, and after wizards to
[19:04] go a after them, I will even set
[19:06] my face against that soul, and will cut
[19:08] him off from among his people."
[19:10] What is he pointing to? this
[19:12] intermediary agency
[19:14] that's going to speak to the living.
[19:17] It's these channels of communication,
[19:19] these familiar spirits and these wizards
[19:21] where they go to whoring after HIM. WHY?
[19:23] BECAUSE IT HAS SOME not just influence
[19:26] but a means of captivating you
[19:31] &gt;&gt; where people now if I could say this
[19:35] and and I say this maybe as a warning
[19:36] I'm amazed at how much people use uh
[19:40] these large language learning models
[19:44] to get information now
[19:48] it's it's shocking I used to answer all
[19:50] the questions in my family
[19:53] Dad. Dad. Dad. Now, now I I think they
[19:56] say, "Dad, they just said Chad." Right.
[19:59] I'm like, "My name's not Chad." Chad,
[20:01] what? Oh, you're asking somebody else.
[20:04] There's so much consulting to those
[20:06] things. And it gives you information. It
[20:08] might sound very good, but do you
[20:10] realize I'm I'm actually getting way
[20:12] ahead of myself where I was going to go
[20:13] on some of these things, but do you
[20:14] realize those things are wrong?
[20:18] And they're actually just as susceptible
[20:20] to brain rot
[20:23] as you.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; And that the more they've learned from
[20:27] all of us and all you the dumber they're
[20:29] getting
[20:31] &gt;&gt; and the more they're misleading us. Can
[20:33] I get an expert amen somewhere?
[20:35] &gt;&gt; It's happening.
[20:37] Because they're people just prompting it
[20:39] and it's LEARNING FROM WHAT WE'RE
[20:40] SAYING.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; IT'S LEARNING FROM WHAT WE'RE WRITING.
[20:42] DO YOU REALIZE IF THE BOTS ARE LEARNING
[20:45] from us,
[20:48] RIGHT? SHOULDN'T WE BE WORRIED?
[20:51] AND SO THAT WASN'T WHERE I WAS GOING.
[20:53] NOW YOU'VE KIND OF GOT THE forward taste
[20:55] to maybe some other places we're going
[20:56] to be going here soon. But these are
[20:58] means of consulting for information and
[21:01] getting things uh uh to act upon.
[21:05] It
[21:06] &gt;&gt; says in verse 27 of the same chapter, "A
[21:08] man also or woman that hath a familiar
[21:10] spirit or that is a wizard shall surely
[21:12] be put to death." So the stakes are
[21:13] pretty high.
[21:15] They shall stone them with stones. Their
[21:17] blood shall be upon them.
[21:19] Why is God putting them in this
[21:22] category?
[21:24] Because they're not as innocent as we
[21:26] might think they are, these particular
[21:28] ones. And I know I'm I I realize that I
[21:31] am using scriptures that are speaking
[21:33] about literal people that have familiar
[21:36] spirits. I'm not talking about a ma
[21:38] magic eightball on your desk where it's
[21:39] like, "Should I go to Ritos today?" And
[21:41] you've hacked it to where it always says
[21:43] yes. Um but you know, and you shake it
[21:45] and it gives you an answer. We're not
[21:46] just talking about rolling dice and just
[21:47] using it to fleece or something. Talking
[21:49] about actual spirits and wizards and
[21:52] these necromancers and these charmers.
[21:54] These are conduits or channels by which
[21:56] darkness can press on one spirit. And
[21:59] God is giving them grace by saying,
[22:01] "Don't get used to them."
[22:05] &gt;&gt; And they're not just bad influences, but
[22:08] they're influences that come with great
[22:11] and severe consequence to the point to
[22:13] where God said, "Put them out from among
[22:14] you, and even those who are guilty of
[22:16] it, let them be put to death."
[22:19] Galatians chapter 9 19- 21 he says now
[22:22] the works of the flesh are manifest
[22:24] which are these this very interesting
[22:27] list of the works of the flesh adultery
[22:28] and we all go yeah fornication okay
[22:32] uncleanness and we might think oh what
[22:34] does that even mean right lasciviousness
[22:36] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[22:39] emulations wrath strife seditions
[22:41] heresies envians murders drunkenness
[22:43] revelings and such like I'm so glad when
[22:46] the scripture gives us that
[22:47] all-encompassing such like.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; BUT NOTICE JUST HOW WITCHCRAFT has its
[22:53] place amongst all these other things.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Whether it be emulation or wrath or
[22:58] seditions and heresies and adultery and
[23:01] idolatry, witchcraft is listed. So, it's
[23:03] not just something we'd say, "Well,
[23:05] brother Aaron, THAT WAS JUST GOD IN THE
[23:08] EXODUS giving them rules like don't wash
[23:10] your pots with your pans and don't drink
[23:12] water with your left hand and make sure
[23:14] your beard isn't round and make sure
[23:16] that you curl your ringlets with
[23:18] lavender oil while curling your big
[23:19] toes." It's it there's not it's none of
[23:21] those things. God's saying there's evil
[23:23] out there
[23:26] &gt;&gt; and these THINGS OUGHT NOT TO BE MESSED
[23:28] WITH.
[23:29] And so it lists the works of the flesh
[23:31] and all these things that we look at. We
[23:33] could get into each one and realize they
[23:35] they arrive through some means of
[23:38] motivating and moving a person to act.
[23:43] Each one of these we could just tie them
[23:45] from the murderings to the revelings.
[23:46] And so witchcraft is an influence.
[23:51] Now to use this phrase modern mediums,
[23:56] it's very obvious. I think um the the
[23:59] the the way I'm phrasing it there with
[24:01] the use of the scriptures what a medium
[24:02] is. But now mediums is plural of medium,
[24:07] right? We all got that. When I shop, I
[24:10] buy mediums.
[24:12] Oh, that people laughed. Well, I'm
[24:14] trying to get there. So the the So
[24:17] mediums is plural of medium. But what's
[24:19] the other word for plural of medium?
[24:21] Media.
[24:23] Media is also a plural form of medium. A
[24:26] single channel like television is a
[24:28] medium. But media collectively refers to
[24:30] all such channels.
[24:33] You have television, radio, print,
[24:35] internet. They're all mediums. But what
[24:36] what what do we usually call them? Mass
[24:38] media.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Mass media, mass murder. They're all
[24:41] related. But here you have a mass media
[24:46] would be all these different mediums
[24:48] collectively. And we don't use the
[24:50] phrase media very often. We are mediums.
[24:52] We use media. But I want you to think of
[24:55] this modern medium
[24:58] that fuses human social interaction and
[25:01] digital communication technologies. And
[25:03] we call it social media.
[25:06] But I'm being very deliberate by using
[25:08] the phrase mediums because I want to
[25:11] cause you just to be a little bit like
[25:14] when you think about social media and
[25:16] when you think about mass media. I want
[25:18] you to think about the witch of indoor.
[25:22] I want you to think about necromancers
[25:24] and wizards. And you might say, "I
[25:26] already do that, brother Aaron. I follow
[25:27] all the best necromancers on Twitter,
[25:30] right? I got all the cards for Dungeons
[25:33] and Dragons on Wizards or whatever it
[25:36] is."
[25:39] And social media, I have a definition
[25:42] that I kind of crafted here. These
[25:45] technologies that enable people to
[25:47] create, share, and exchange what we
[25:49] might call content. And that could be
[25:51] text and images, video, different things
[25:53] of that nature, messages. And it's done
[25:56] this idea of social media or social
[25:59] mediums. Media being the plural of
[26:02] medium. That this media is this it's
[26:06] done within virtual communities,
[26:08] communities that exist only by virtue of
[26:12] uh uh uh this medium and these networks.
[26:16] And this phrase social comes from the
[26:19] Latin uh uh which means a companion or
[26:22] ally. So that you have this to
[26:25] socialize. It emphasizes human
[26:27] interaction and community. That's the
[26:29] idea behind something is social. And
[26:32] then media from that Latin medium which
[26:34] means a channel. So it's referring to
[26:36] these communication tools and we use
[26:38] that phrase channels is a very often one
[26:40] I keep coming across. So social media
[26:43] itself is a medium of expression
[26:47] and not just a medium of expression
[26:49] because you could see that in radio and
[26:51] television and painting and these and
[26:53] and print work and different works of an
[26:55] artist but it's also a network of
[26:57] relationships
[26:59] when years ago and Walter Konite would
[27:02] get on ABC whatever it is and he would
[27:05] get up there and he would tell you what
[27:07] happened that day. There's no GIVE AND
[27:09] TAKE. YOU JUST HAD to take it from Paul
[27:11] Harvey and now you know the rest of the
[27:13] story, right? There's no I just got a
[27:16] text right now from a listener west of
[27:18] the Rockies. No, you didn't get those
[27:19] kinds of things. It's just that one way
[27:22] uh a medium of this information that's
[27:25] being spread. But now it becomes a
[27:27] network of relationships
[27:31] &gt;&gt; and it differs for differs from mass
[27:33] media because of the participation, the
[27:35] interactivity and just the fact that
[27:36] anybody can create content.
[27:40] And there's two critical components at
[27:41] work. I had been studying on a
[27:44] particular subject for next year just as
[27:46] that I feel like the Lord has led me
[27:47] very directly and I just don't know when
[27:49] the end is sight on these themes that
[27:50] we've been on this year. But I've been
[27:52] thinking possibly in the new year we'd
[27:53] begin to look at the idea and concept of
[27:55] community and it's just kind of fallen
[27:57] in my lap to begin to at least explore
[27:59] this now. that there's two critical
[28:01] components and I would even say
[28:03] necessary components that are at work
[28:05] with social media and that's community
[28:07] and communication.
[28:10] And I could take time tonight, won't do
[28:12] it, could take time soon, probably won't
[28:13] do it to show you just how important it
[28:16] is to a human to have community and
[28:18] communication
[28:20] base needs. Very very important. And so
[28:24] social media includes these these these
[28:28] uh or maybe I could say necessities OR
[28:31] THESE BASE DESIRES that we might have to
[28:33] satisfy community and communication.
[28:38] But there is a warning that comes
[28:42] when it come with these mediums in 1
[28:45] Corinthians 5:es 9-13. I I don't want to
[28:49] get too involved in what Paul is
[28:51] teaching here, but maybe we could just
[28:53] read it and at least accept that he is
[28:56] setting forth the necessity of
[28:59] boundaries.
[29:01] He says, "I wrote unto you in an epistle
[29:02] to not keep company with fornicators."
[29:06] Oh, let's just say he wrote a letter
[29:08] that we hadn't read uh that this is the
[29:12] first Corinthians that we read here, but
[29:13] he said, "I've written you a letter
[29:14] already." He said, "Don't have
[29:18] communion, fellowship, and company,
[29:20] companionship. Uh, hang out with
[29:22] fornicators."
[29:24] And he says, "Yet not altogether with
[29:26] the fornicators of this world, or with
[29:28] the covetous or extortioners or with
[29:29] idolattors,
[29:31] for then must ye needs go out of the
[29:34] world." So Paul said to them that
[29:37] they're not to keep company with
[29:38] fornicators, but then he qualifies it.
[29:41] He says, "Not not that there's this
[29:43] absolute abstinence from all these
[29:45] things and have nothing to do with them
[29:47] and you kind of you you you you call up,
[29:49] you know, fries and you're like, how
[29:53] many people are in there tonight?" Like
[29:54] even when you do this to kids these
[29:56] days, like what is that? I realize all
[29:58] the I've been doing this for, you know,
[30:00] 17 years with my kids. I'm on the phone
[30:02] and they're like, "Hang loose. What you
[30:04] want a banana? What?" Right? And I'm
[30:06] over here. I'm on the phone. Right?
[30:09] Right? It's like I don't know how to
[30:10] convey that. But there's you want to
[30:12] call up Friday and say, "Is the store
[30:14] empty?" Right? So, I'm just going to do
[30:16] door dash hoping that somebody
[30:19] sanctified delivers my goods. Right?
[30:21] Because well, if we just if it was this
[30:25] uh unrealistic prohibition on anyone who
[30:28] doesn't believe like you, he says, "You
[30:30] just need to get out of the world."
[30:33] So then he draws it down narrow more
[30:35] narrowly saying this is more obtainable.
[30:38] And this part to me strikes me because
[30:40] he says but now I've written unto you
[30:42] not to keep company if any man that is
[30:44] called a brother be a fornicator.
[30:48] So I can hang out with rando fornicator.
[30:51] Right. But if he's a brother no
[30:54] that's not actually what he's saying.
[30:56] But he's saying that it's it's more the
[30:58] closer someone is to you
[31:01] if you don't keep company fornicators.
[31:03] But he said don't you can't just become
[31:04] a hermit and not have fellowship with
[31:05] anyone or not interact with anyone
[31:07] because he says not altogether abstain
[31:09] from these things because you must needs
[31:11] be in this world. But let me be more
[31:13] particular. Don't keep company with the
[31:14] man who's called a brother as a
[31:15] fornicator or covetous or an idolattor
[31:18] or a or a drunkard or an
[31:20] extortioner.
[31:23] There's your six red flags.
[31:26] with such a one know not to eat.
[31:30] For what have I do to judge them
[31:34] also that are without? Do not ye judge
[31:36] them that are within? But them that are
[31:38] without, God, God judges. Therefore, put
[31:40] away from among yourselves that wicked
[31:43] person.
[31:44] It may not seem to be obvious on its
[31:46] face, but I want you just to try a
[31:48] little bit, and I'm certainly not going
[31:49] to try to force it. Uh, but if you could
[31:51] see this, he's highlighting the power of
[31:53] community. He's kind of emphasizing the
[31:57] he's underscoring the necessity of it,
[31:58] but just HOW THAT IF YOU FELLOWSHIP with
[32:00] someone, you keep company with someone,
[32:02] someone that your brother, and there you
[32:04] build this sense of community with
[32:05] someone who's a drunker, a an
[32:07] extortioner, who's covetous and a
[32:08] fornicator, that there's power from
[32:10] those influences.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Speaks to the power of communication. He
[32:14] says not to sit down to eat, that
[32:16] there's some uh some affinity, some
[32:20] communication.
[32:22] And each one of these characteristics
[32:24] uh noted here are conduct that's
[32:27] offensive not only to God but offensive
[32:29] to the individual.
[32:31] That these are THINGS THAT WOULD CAUSE
[32:32] HARM, things that would cause influence.
[32:35] And so he's rebuking this behavior
[32:39] of even though the few because it can
[32:42] always influence others.
[32:46] He's not saying, "Well, I'm so glad that
[32:48] 20 of you are so strong. You could put
[32:49] up with that railing false accuser who's
[32:51] covetous and always blackmailing and
[32:53] scamming you guys and just put up with
[32:55] it. Just just put up with it. You guys
[32:57] will It's fine. Just let them do their
[32:58] thing." He says, "No." At a certain
[32:59] point, you have to say, "You know what?
[33:00] Just because I'm a Christian doesn't
[33:02] mean I have to be taken advantage of
[33:04] constantly by somebody who's being
[33:06] disobedient."
[33:09] But the just recognize Paul is saying,
[33:11] "I told you not to keep company." That's
[33:13] this idea of communication, fellowship,
[33:15] community. And then Proverbs 22:es 24
[33:18] and 25, he says, "Make no friendship
[33:20] with an angry man. With a furious man,
[33:23] thou shalt not go,
[33:26] lest thou learn his ways and get a snare
[33:29] to thy soul."
[33:31] Notice it. There's an influence or an
[33:34] impact.
[33:37] You'll either learn those ways or
[33:39] they'll trap your mind. They become
[33:40] wounds or scars. It imprisons your
[33:43] heart. Lest thou learn his ways and get
[33:45] a snare to thy soul. Make no friendship
[33:47] with an angry man. This is the
[33:49] disposition of one who's prone to anger.
[33:51] Somebody who cannot control their
[33:52] temper. With a furious man, DON'T DON'T
[33:54] FOLLOW HIM.
[33:56] These are really good instructions.
[33:59] But it's identifying,
[34:03] if I could say this, the power of
[34:07] community, having something in common
[34:08] and and and fellowship around those
[34:10] things and the individuals that comprise
[34:12] that as we're talking about these uh the
[34:15] human interaction and community and and
[34:17] getting to know one another. Social
[34:19] media has this uh uh this exchange of
[34:23] ideas.
[34:26] there's a some expression but then it's
[34:28] this there's a relationship with the
[34:30] individuals that are expressing these
[34:32] things. So you have this community and
[34:34] communication and now we're looking at
[34:35] these scriptures says you shouldn't be
[34:36] friends with someone who's angry now
[34:39] who's an angry man. Now how quickly
[34:41] would some of our Facebook follows
[34:44] do you follow on Facebook? Is that what
[34:46] you do? I don't know. You don't follow
[34:47] on Well, I'm I don't mean you
[34:49] personally, but does one is that what it
[34:51] is as followers? I'm still on Google
[34:54] friends or whatever. Google one. I just
[34:56] circle people. Circle me back. There's
[34:59] um there's a way that you indicate that
[35:02] there's a connection here, right?
[35:05] LinkedIn, I'm going to follow you. And
[35:07] if we couldn't follow an angry person,
[35:08] just how small would our following list
[35:10] get, right? Like I noticed this guy
[35:12] here. He has zero followers. Trump has
[35:15] zero followers on his own truth social
[35:18] according to Proverbs 22.
[35:22] But it's to recognize this. Where there
[35:25] is
[35:26] an evil spirit or a corrupting powerful
[35:29] influence, I want to say this. You'll
[35:32] either become it
[35:35] where you'll assimilate and you'll begin
[35:36] to engage in in uh in the expected
[35:40] behavior where if YOU IF YOU FOLLOW an
[35:43] angry man, he says you're going to get
[35:44] it become an angry man.
[35:47] And and I want to say this, but if you
[35:49] don't become angry, you'll become
[35:51] oppressed.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; AND YOU BECOME THE SUBJECT OF ANGER OR
[35:56] GOVERNED and ruled by the atmosphere
[35:58] created by that influence.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; So you say, "Well, I I I'LL NEVER BECOME
[36:03] LIKE THAT AND AND I WON'T BECOME LIKE
[36:05] THEM AND THAT'LL THAT'LL NEVER PHASE ME
[36:06] AND THAT THAT'LL NEVER WORK." BUT THE
[36:08] WAY THAT IT HAPPENS IS IT doesn't mean
[36:10] YOU HAVE TO BECOME THAT, but you become
[36:13] in bondage to it. You become oppressed
[36:16] by it. The Bible says in 1 Corinthians
[36:18] chapter 15:33, "Be not deceived."
[36:21] Remember, be not deceived. God is not
[36:23] mocked. That you whatever you plant,
[36:26] you're going to harvest. Evil
[36:28] communications corrupt good manners. We
[36:31] covered this quite a bit in our prophet
[36:33] and the playrights and those different
[36:34] things we examined earlier this year.
[36:36] But when he says evil communications
[36:37] corrupt good manners, it means that
[36:39] ethos or ethos, your state or moral
[36:42] character, evil communications will
[36:45] corrupt your character.
[36:48] Bad company, and I'm not referring to a
[36:50] classic rock band, bad company, though
[36:52] that would certainly fit, will ruin your
[36:54] sentiments. It'll ruin your nature.
[36:58] It changes who you are.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Be not deceived. Evil communications,
[37:03] you say, "Well, I have a filter on my
[37:04] phone. and I will not receive any curse
[37:06] words. This fellowshipping and just here
[37:08] recently in terms of social media and
[37:10] how people could just add one letter in
[37:12] the middle of a prohibited word and you
[37:14] got to change the algorithm to recognize
[37:16] the V now
[37:18] and the misspellings because people JUST
[37:20] GET RIGHT AROUND it and you know what's
[37:23] being said, right? I mean, Vid Angel
[37:27] could bleep it out, but you're like,
[37:30] "THAT WAS BLEEPING BAD. OH MY GOODNESS.
[37:32] Why would they do that?" I don't know if
[37:33] they bleep it on Vid Angel. may just be
[37:35] silent but the point is there's a
[37:37] certain level where there's a communi
[37:39] you say it's not just this not hearing
[37:41] that the evil communication is the care
[37:44] the the company
[37:46] &gt;&gt; the friendship the relationship
[37:48] &gt;&gt; will change who you are evil
[37:50] conversations absolutely those things
[37:52] that we talk about and read and those
[37:53] things will water and and nourish the
[37:55] ground and the soil uh that's pouring
[37:58] out from those things but then also
[38:00] these evil friendships
[38:02] is meant here it can be a bad influence
[38:04] on your lives and upon your habits.
[38:11] Apologies if you came tonight needing a
[38:12] pickme up. You can just imagine say,
[38:15] "Well, I'm going to church tonight cuz
[38:17] I'm going to leave happy."
[38:22] Verse 1 Corinthians chapter 5:E 6, he
[38:26] says, "Your gloring is not good. Know
[38:27] you not that a little leaven leavenventh
[38:29] the whole lump."
[38:31] It it has this way. Okay, I want to use
[38:33] that scripture said just as this leaven
[38:36] being small once added to the loaf
[38:40] pervades the whole thing to where now
[38:42] it's leavened.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; You can't just say cut me off a
[38:47] unleavened piece.
[38:49] You can't do it.
[38:51] You you can't you can't ask. It's not
[38:53] like ordering brisket
[38:56] like you do you want a you want a fatty
[38:58] part or do you want a dry part? You know
[39:00] you want the point or the flat. What
[39:01] what is it you want? It's like you say,
[39:03] "Well, I want uh I don't want to have
[39:05] any beef.
[39:08] I don't want any smoke."
[39:12] Said that where there's a little levan,
[39:14] it just has a way of producing itself
[39:16] everywhere.
[39:18] And the scripture teaches us as it says,
[39:20] "An angry man produces friends of an
[39:22] angry man become angry."
[39:25] A and and followers of a furious man
[39:29] become furious because you learn his
[39:31] ways. Temper will breed temper.
[39:34] Disrespect will breed disrespect.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; The doubtful
[39:40] will make you doubtful.
[39:42] The fearful will make you fearful.
[39:44] There's a lot of people that are afraid
[39:46] of a lot of nonsense, a lot of stuff,
[39:47] and you're doing just fine. And they go
[39:48] up to you and says, "Do you know the
[39:51] chemical they put in your steering
[39:52] wheels
[39:54] &gt;&gt; is causing people to be sterile." And
[39:56] now all of a sudden, you're like, "I
[39:57] need not only do I need a driverless
[39:59] car, I need no polyurethane anywhere
[40:01] around me because the microplastics are
[40:03] going to kill me." And all of a sudden,
[40:05] your life is completely turned upside
[40:07] down because people obsess and are
[40:10] fearful. And what does it do? It breeds
[40:12] fear.
[40:14] I'm not trying to start a rumor on
[40:15] steering wheels. I just made that up.
[40:18] And if it's if it's right,
[40:21] you heard it here first.
[40:25] I think this is applicable in 2 Timothy
[40:27] chapter 2 16 and 17. These are
[40:29] scriptures that are often used in this
[40:31] particular subject. But shun and profane
[40:33] but shun profane in vain babblings. The
[40:36] internet is dead now. Boom. Over. Gone.
[40:42] Right. Comic se uh comment sections
[40:45] TURNED OFF. X IS GONE. THEY'RE ALL SHUT
[40:49] DOWN.
[40:51] Profane and vain babblings for they will
[40:53] increase unto more ungodliness.
[40:56] He says, "And their word will eat as
[40:58] doth a canker." I use these scriptures
[41:00] in support of what I'm trying to assert
[41:03] tonight that there is a
[41:06] a corrupting influence through certain
[41:09] channels.
[41:11] that there's a way that we can
[41:12] communicate with one another that that
[41:14] might be kind of fun at first, but then
[41:16] it can get a little bit out of control.
[41:18] THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD
[41:20] JUST CHALK OFF AS, WELL, THAT'S JUST
[41:22] human behavior. That's just kids. BUT IF
[41:24] ALLOWED TO KIND OF govern itself and
[41:26] form its own course, IT COULD BECOME
[41:29] SOMETHING WORSE than what you thought it
[41:31] was. OH, THOSE DON'T WORRY. THOSE TWO,
[41:34] they just they've always been like that.
[41:37] You know, they're just they're a little
[41:38] bit more affectionate.
[41:40] And we make excuses for certain conduct
[41:43] because of their age. But as they GET
[41:44] OLDER, YOU WANT TO ASK YOURSELF, IS
[41:47] THERE something that's trending in
[41:49] influences that are causing a certain
[41:51] behavior?
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Because there's ways of talking and ways
[41:55] of thinking and ways of listening and
[41:56] ways of reading and ways of ingesting
[41:59] mediums,
[42:01] the information provided by mediums that
[42:03] will increase to more ungodliness. that
[42:05] eats like a canker, that will leaven the
[42:08] whole lump,
[42:10] that will corrupt a person's character,
[42:13] that'll be a snare to your soul because
[42:16] you will learn the ways being channeled
[42:18] by the mediums.
[42:21] I want to close with some excerpts from
[42:24] a book. How many here have read The
[42:26] Anxious Generation by Jonathan
[42:29] Hate? Have anybody read that? Nobody.
[42:31] The Anxious Generation. Wow. I'm kind of
[42:33] surprised there. I'm not necessar it's
[42:34] not in my book club for those of you who
[42:37] are in it but he speaks in this
[42:40] particular book and um there's there's
[42:43] some other he had written some other
[42:45] books before this and what's interesting
[42:47] is he had made some very stark
[42:49] observations on the coddling of America
[42:52] and re and pointed out like these three
[42:54] uh anybody read that book the coddling
[42:56] of America okay all right join the book
[42:59] club and in this book he talked about
[43:01] these these untruths that that are being
[43:04] taught on college campuses that were
[43:05] giving rise to what he identified as
[43:08] depression and mental illness. And it
[43:11] was these three different untruths. But
[43:13] then the more that he studied this, the
[43:15] more he researched it, uh his follow-up
[43:17] book to me didn't necessarily change
[43:19] what he had um written on before, but it
[43:22] gave him more insight into the
[43:23] influences that were pushing the these
[43:25] narratives.
[43:27] And he he comes up with this phrase in
[43:29] this particular time period that he
[43:30] called the great rewiring of childhood.
[43:33] and he explores how uh uh changes in
[43:35] daily life have caused what he calls an
[43:37] epidemic of mental illness and and and
[43:41] he takes uh he goes to great lengths to
[43:43] do this. He compares the emergence
[43:46] uh and the household adoption of mediums
[43:50] and and he looked at the this these
[43:52] waves of technology where the onset of
[43:55] radio, television and then also these
[43:59] paired technologies. Then he looked at
[44:01] these waves of paired technology such as
[44:03] a personal computer and then the
[44:05] internet. I can remember being not even
[44:07] a teenager and being online. My grandpa
[44:10] had Prodigy and I remember being able to
[44:12] sit there and stare at a computer screen
[44:15] in 8bit black and white using Prodigy
[44:19] internet painfully for hours watching
[44:22] the Padres's Red Score update. I was in
[44:25] San Diego. You probably weren't too far
[44:27] away from me at the time. And it was
[44:29] just mesmerizing. I I can't believe I
[44:32] can't If I put my kids in front of that
[44:34] today, they would beat their brains out
[44:38] bored to death on the mechanical
[44:40] keyboard and it would be loud as could
[44:42] be.
[44:46] But there's these but as the personal
[44:48] computers came on and those became
[44:50] ubiquitous and households adopted it, it
[44:51] looked at these kind of this paired
[44:53] technology of the internet
[44:55] and these are just what the data is
[44:57] telling them and they make their
[44:58] conclusions based upon it. But they
[45:00] discovered that there was no increase no
[45:02] perceptible increase in mental health
[45:04] related illnesses for teenagers through
[45:06] the rise of the personal computer in the
[45:08] home and then the paired technology of
[45:11] the internet.
[45:13] But it was this second wave of a paired
[45:15] technology that has produced maybe the
[45:18] coddling of America, but then also this
[45:20] epidemic of mental illness. And I and I
[45:23] want to say this is just what these
[45:24] these scientists have uncovered, but I
[45:27] want you to think about it for yourself
[45:28] to process it yourself uh what what
[45:31] these things would do. But it's the
[45:33] second wave that paired the smartphone
[45:35] in social media.
[45:38] And we might say it's a correlation, but
[45:40] it looks to me to be way beyond just a
[45:43] coraliz coralization, but a direct
[45:46] impact on mental health.
[45:49] And they observed that once you had
[45:51] these this adoption of smartphones and
[45:55] social media that girls mental health
[45:57] began to collapse.
[45:59] They say for boys mental health, it
[46:01] changed in so many diffuse ways that
[46:03] it's it's hard just to put a label on
[46:05] it.
[46:06] But the the data is very striking. When
[46:09] you had the internet, you had laptops,
[46:11] you had games, uh uh they they THEY DID
[46:14] NOT HAVE uh they did not have even
[46:17] social media did not HAVE ITSELF THIS
[46:20] BROAD IMPACT UPON mental health.
[46:23] When there was Facebook and there was a
[46:25] personal computer, maybe there was more
[46:27] time spent, there was more interaction,
[46:29] there was more engagement. Yes, there's
[46:30] influences. There's things that one had
[46:32] to watch out for. But there was a direct
[46:36] connection. There was no there was there
[46:39] was no a way to take to correlate the
[46:41] emergence of these technologies to
[46:43] mental health. But then all of a sudden
[46:44] once the smartphone and social media
[46:47] fused together and that began to be more
[46:49] adopted more in households, there's a
[46:51] spike. The adoption of a smartphone was
[46:53] faster than any other technology, any
[46:56] other medium.
[46:59] And in this book, it writes, "The daily
[47:00] life, consciousness, and social
[47:02] relationships of a 13-year-old with
[47:04] iPhones in 2013, those were b who were
[47:07] born in the year 2000, WERE PROFOUNDLY
[47:10] DIFFERENT FROM those 13-year-olds with
[47:12] flip phones in 2007, who were born in
[47:15] 1994. Anybody here born in 1994?
[47:17] Anybody? 1994. Anybody? 1994. Okay. No
[47:20] toes yet. Anybody here born in 2000?"
[47:23] 2000. Got to be 2000. Nobody. Oh, one.
[47:25] Okay. If you compared a 13-year-old born
[47:28] in 1994 to a 13-year-old born in 2000,
[47:31] their lives were drastically different.
[47:35] Well beyond the life of a 13-year-old
[47:37] born in 1975 versus a 13-year-old born
[47:39] in 1990. Though the difference between
[47:42] those two, you'd like, "Oh my goodness,
[47:43] you're talking about the difference
[47:44] between uh Cool and the Gang and Michael
[47:47] Jackson Solo." BUT THERE'S YEAH THERE'S
[47:49] A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE DIFFERENT BUT
[47:50] IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU COULD EXPECT IN
[47:53] PERSON'S LIFE AND AND THEIR MENTAL
[47:55] HEALTH AND THEIR DAILY LIFE AND THEIR
[47:56] CHALLENGES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WERE
[47:59] NOT AS DIFFERENT AS IT IS NOW THAT THE
[48:01] SMARTPHONE comes into being. Those who
[48:04] are raised with iPhones and what it does
[48:05] is it exposes how the social media
[48:08] ecosystem is powerfully enticing through
[48:11] the smartphone.
[48:15] This writer writes, "With so many new
[48:17] and exciting virtual activities, many
[48:19] adolescents and adults lost the ability
[48:22] to be fully present with the people
[48:23] around them, which change social life
[48:27] for everyone,
[48:29] even for the small minority that did not
[48:31] use these platforms." It's true. It's
[48:33] changed everything.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[48:37] Can I get a witness?
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Anybody willing to just be a little bit
[48:41] vulnerable and say, "Yeah, this is
[48:43] real." And not not for the neighbor in
[48:45] the apartment next door. You you might
[48:48] not have known this, but he is totally
[48:49] analog now.
[48:53] Says, "While girls social lives," and
[48:55] I'm just kind of skipping around. While
[48:56] girls social lives moved into onto
[48:58] social media platforms,
[49:00] and remember, women are more susceptible
[49:04] to the mediums.
[49:06] AND THOSE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE
[49:07] BECOME INCREASINGLY ENTICING through the
[49:10] tools that are now available to
[49:12] fabricate a reality. So that NO MATTER
[49:16] HOW TRY HARD YOU TRY TO CRAFT A REALITY
[49:19] OR FIT, YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME
[49:21] REPRESENTATION THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO
[49:22] chase and attain to. It fits with what
[49:25] brother Eleaser was saying about those
[49:27] who are kind of faking things and the
[49:29] put on and how people are more uh
[49:33] concerned about the appearance than the
[49:35] actual intimacy and the connection.
[49:38] That's what religion has become and the
[49:39] cosmetic Christianity. It's just a
[49:42] reflection of how shallow all of our
[49:43] interactions are. WHEN THE BIBLE SAYS UH
[49:47] HE THAT WANTS TO HAVE FRIENDS must show
[49:48] up himself friendly, there's a principle
[49:50] there that we could teach in terms of if
[49:52] you want to have friends, you you you
[49:53] might not want to be a prickly pair
[49:55] cactus. But it means a man who wants to
[49:58] have a lot of friends and a LOT OF
[49:59] FOLLOWERS AND BE POPULAR HAS TO BE VERY
[50:01] VERY very shallow
[50:04] and can't risk real connections.
[50:09] And so while girls lives moved onto
[50:11] social media platforms, boys burrowed
[50:13] deeper into the virtual world as they
[50:15] engaged in a variety of digital
[50:17] activities, particularly immersive
[50:19] online multiplayer video games, YouTube,
[50:23] Reddit, and hardcore pornography. All of
[50:25] which became available anytime, anywhere
[50:27] for free right on their smartphones.
[50:32] These things are not I'm not breaking
[50:34] ground with you tonight, but I am saying
[50:37] it out loud. Those
[50:40] things are dangerous.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; A smartphone in itself is going to give
[50:45] you access to a lot of things. But now
[50:47] you combine this aspect, this social
[50:49] media aspect and now it becomes
[50:51] community and communication.
[50:55] Now there's ways that want they want to
[50:57] promote community and engagement.
[51:00] You get a name, you get an avatar, and
[51:02] you get reasons to keep coming back.
[51:05] And there's and there's ways to
[51:07] communicate beyond just even uh the
[51:10] gooey more than just beyond what the the
[51:12] device or product or the game. It's not
[51:15] like some of the games we that we played
[51:17] on a flip phone.
[51:19] You just you just tried to beat it. That
[51:21] was it.
[51:23] A and and it was painful. There was only
[51:26] one that I ever had on a phone and it
[51:28] was one where you it was just balls that
[51:30] moved around in a circle or something
[51:31] like I can't even remember. and I was
[51:32] introduced to it by my brother and it
[51:35] was just it's like you could just get
[51:37] sucked into it. What's the objective?
[51:38] You just want to keep the thing going.
[51:41] But now if that game exists, there's
[51:44] probably other users
[51:47] who are competing at the same time and
[51:48] it draws you into community and they
[51:50] expand it to where there's now
[51:52] communication and there's there's a
[51:53] reward SYSTEM BUILT INTO IT socially
[51:58] &gt;&gt; and then it just becomes everywhere all
[52:00] the time through the smartphone.
[52:09] Could we uh in in the post, could we
[52:11] edit in some crowd noise?
[52:16] I maybe just begin with just kind of a a
[52:18] light roar and you know, maybe just some
[52:22] like just a little like an enthusiasm
[52:23] and then just kind of as I go like it's
[52:26] just now it's just at this feverish
[52:27] pitch, right? And
[52:30] &gt;&gt; the new mixer will do that. Okay, good.
[52:32] Maybe we could just use some algor chat
[52:34] GPT and some AI and we can put just put
[52:37] in people at the altars and cell phones
[52:40] just bouncing off the back of the church
[52:42] and tablets being broken
[52:46] just as Moses broke the tablets. Glory.
[52:53] When I used this phrase modern mediums,
[52:57] I used it because I wanted to kind of
[52:59] call out social mediums.
[53:03] Social media and it's a call to be
[53:07] discerning and vigilant about
[53:09] communication and community.
[53:14] If where do we where do we feel that we
[53:18] fit as individuals and believers
[53:20] such that if we need help or we have
[53:22] questions where are we going to go with
[53:23] those questions and for help?
[53:26] Is there are there is there an openness
[53:28] in communication even within our
[53:29] families? And is there some sort of
[53:30] community with other like-minded people
[53:32] that if we have difficulty or a problem
[53:34] or if we begin to see something that
[53:36] doesn't seem to be right or doesn't fit
[53:38] or something that bothers us, do we go
[53:40] beyond our community?
[53:43] uh do we go beyond um the word of God
[53:46] and do we begin to use mediums
[53:49] to get our information and tell us how
[53:50] to behave, how to act, how to respond
[53:53] and tell us what truth is.
[53:57] So there's this component of
[53:58] communication and community.
[54:01] And if I could say this to the parents,
[54:03] we exist in vastly
[54:08] a a vastly different social and
[54:09] technological landscape. Our children
[54:12] do. We we exist in now. What we exist in
[54:14] now, it's unlike any other time before.
[54:18] And I would say that we have technology
[54:20] experts, we have social media experts
[54:22] right right here in our midst. And they
[54:24] could probably tell you in greater
[54:26] detail
[54:28] just how powerful they are. I think this
[54:32] may go without saying. I can't remember
[54:33] the book and the the book that um it's
[54:36] been several years now and it opened
[54:38] with all the great uh uh
[54:44] I don't want to say inventors but uh
[54:47] those who advanced technology innovators
[54:50] of social media and technology and the
[54:52] iPhone and all these things that pervade
[54:54] our lives in Google they wouldn't allow
[54:55] their children to be on the very
[54:57] platforms they're creating
[54:59] &gt;&gt; they wouldn't allow them TO OWN THE
[55:00] DEVICES THAT THEY'RE MARKETING
[55:03] DO YOU REALIZE THEY HAVE MORE IN COMMON
[55:05] WITH DRUG DEALERS?
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Who won't use the drugs they're selling
[55:11] than they do some uh social conscious
[55:14] entrepreneur who's concerned about your
[55:16] well-being?
[55:18] We live as a as parents and adults. I
[55:20] say it just to kind of get our
[55:21] attention. The landscape is different.
[55:23] This is where my eyes were opened. I
[55:25] grew up in an age of Nintendo and Sega
[55:27] Genesis. A and we and I had a I REMEMBER
[55:30] HAVING AN ATARI PERSONAL COMPUTER IN MY
[55:32] ROOM AS AN eight-year-old
[55:34] playing 8-bit baseball
[55:37] and I could say, "WELL, I PLAYED THAT
[55:39] HOURS AT A TIME AND I PLAYED THE SEGA
[55:40] GENESIS ALL DAY LONG AND I PLAYED THE
[55:42] NINTENDO and kind of turned out okay. I
[55:45] mean, I'm still a work in progress, BUT
[55:47] YOU KNOW, I I'M NOT SELLING DRUGS. I'M
[55:50] NOT BEATING MY WIFE, RIGHT? THERE'S A
[55:53] LOT OF THINGS. YEAH, I'M DOING GOOD."
[55:55] AND I REALIZED I CAN'T GO BY WHAT IT WAS
[55:57] for me
[55:58] &gt;&gt; and think that I CAN JUST DO ALL THE
[56:01] SAME THINGS AND IT'S JUST GOING TO TURN
[56:02] OUT THE SAME way
[56:03] &gt;&gt; because we live in a different age.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; These modern mediums are forms of
[56:08] expression and influence that are
[56:09] shaping and impacting our minds. And it
[56:13] goes for our kids and us as adults.
[56:16] It's mood altering.
[56:19] You don't need to pop pills.
[56:23] the the digital entertainment can
[56:25] trigger and fire off the very same
[56:27] things that drugs can do in a person.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; It kills ambition.
[56:32] I remember when I there was the onset of
[56:36] these things and the way that it began I
[56:38] can this is a personal testimony. I
[56:40] remember a friend of mine in high school
[56:42] uh he graduated a year or two before me
[56:45] and uh he went to
[56:48] uh University of Texas and uh when he
[56:52] was in school he really struggled
[56:55] because he got addicted to online gaming
[57:00] Unreal Tournament and he wasted hundreds
[57:03] of thousands of dollars was on the
[57:05] 10-year program and didn't even finish
[57:06] that. And it was all because he got
[57:09] addicted to the gaming and the the
[57:12] community that it and the way that it
[57:14] hooked into him. I know another brother
[57:15] is one of the most the smartest people
[57:16] I've ever known in my life. Brilliant
[57:18] and could have been a multi multi
[57:20] multi-millionaire many times over.
[57:22] Addictions to video games completely
[57:24] derailed his life.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; And so you say, "Well, that's just for
[57:29] those with really addictive
[57:31] personalities perhaps." And maybe those
[57:33] are antiquated examples because they
[57:35] arose from a time in the '9s. But let me
[57:37] just say this. They've gotten smarter.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; It's it's not niche anymore that gets
[57:45] somebody. Social media and the
[57:48] smartphone now being combined will warp
[57:50] the ways that we view the world.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; And worse, the word.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; The things that are possible today would
[57:59] not have been possible in a day gone by
[58:02] because of social media.
[58:06] And so my last statement, musicians, if
[58:09] you'd like to come to your instruments
[58:11] ever so soberly. And
[58:18] cue the crowd noise.
[58:21] Says, "Of course, teens had cell phones
[58:22] since the late 90s, but they were basic
[58:25] phones with no internet access. Often
[58:26] known at the time as flip phones because
[58:28] the most popular design could be flipped
[58:30] open with the flick of the wrist. Basic
[58:32] phones were mostly useful for
[58:33] communicating directly with friends and
[58:35] family. one on-one. You could call
[58:37] people and you could text them using
[58:38] cumbersome thumb presses on a numeric
[58:40] keypad. What is it? T9 or what it was
[58:42] that you had to do it several times and
[58:43] if you missed it, you had to go back.
[58:47] So, smartphones are very different.
[58:50] They connect you to the to you to the
[58:52] internet 24/7.
[58:54] They can run millions of apps and they
[58:56] quickly become the home of social media
[58:58] platforms [music]
[58:59] which can ping you continually
[59:01] throughout the day.
[59:03] I I I went to buy something uh in and in
[59:07] doing so was like if if you give me your
[59:08] social security number, your credit card
[59:10] number, your email address, your phone
[59:12] number, you can get 2% off. And I'm
[59:13] like, I'm in.
[59:15] And in doing so, I signed up to be
[59:17] emailed three times a day for like a buy
[59:21] it for life product. [music]
[59:23] Like every day it's it's just reminding
[59:25] me, you know, buy another bucket, buy
[59:27] another bucket, buy another bucket. I I
[59:29] have too many buckets now. I'm done. I'm
[59:30] out of the bucket business.
[59:33] But they ping you constantly, non-stop.
[59:35] And I found with some people, they're
[59:37] always running [music] 25% off. Last
[59:41] chance for 25% off. And I realized, oh,
[59:44] LAST CHANCE TODAY CUZ I'M GOING TO HAVE
[59:45] ANOTHER ONE TOMORROW.
[59:48] They ping you continually throughout the
[59:50] day, urging you to check out what
[59:51] everyone is saying and doing. Now that's
[59:53] out of the marketing realm, but now it's
[59:55] into that community [music] and
[59:56] communication.
[59:58] This kind of connectivity offers few of
[1:00:00] the benefits of talking directly with
[1:00:02] friends.
[1:00:04] Cue the last slide, brother John. In
[1:00:06] fact, for many young people,
[1:00:10] it's poisonous
[1:00:14] for many young people. [music] It's
[1:00:16] poisonous
[1:00:18] that at what might have been okay. And
[1:00:21] even in terms of the differences in
[1:00:23] ages, myself being 50, there may be
[1:00:24] parents who are in their 30s, you know,
[1:00:26] it's different now. Even with what you
[1:00:28] went through and what you survived and
[1:00:30] what you experienced, it's different
[1:00:32] because now I'm learning as a parent
[1:00:34] that the things that I enjoyed at one
[1:00:36] time have another component to it that
[1:00:39] has drastically increased the stakes
[1:00:42] to where now there's a lot more at risk
[1:00:44] in their involvement
[1:00:46] than just game over
[1:00:49] you lose a life or you got to start all
[1:00:52] over again. [music] They've constructed
[1:00:54] these things in such a way to where
[1:00:55] there's a constant need for attention.
[1:00:58] There's a constant need for affirmation.
[1:01:00] There's a constant drive to be
[1:01:01] competitive, to succeed. And it's able
[1:01:04] to really get its hooks in us through
[1:01:06] the use or misuse of community and
[1:01:09] communication.
[1:01:11] And what science is observing and even
[1:01:13] non-Christians, this [music] person who
[1:01:15] wrote this book, I believe, is a
[1:01:16] non-practicing Jew. He says it's
[1:01:18] poisonous.
[1:01:20] It's poisoning minds.
[1:01:23] and [music] causing tremendous social
[1:01:24] anxiety,
[1:01:26] fear and depression and all sorts
[1:01:28] [music] of problems. And I share it with
[1:01:30] you tonight that there's modern mediums
[1:01:32] that you need to be more aware of. And
[1:01:35] if you're not, you need to be more
[1:01:36] prayerful about
[1:01:39] so that we can protect our minds and our
[1:01:41] hearts and especially our young
[1:01:42] children. If we could stand tonight
[1:01:44] together
[1:01:46] just asking the Lord to give us a grace
[1:01:47] and to help us to navigate these things.
[1:01:50] I'm grateful for brothers who have been
[1:01:52] extremely successful in their particular
[1:01:54] lines of work. Brother Lucas is a rock
[1:01:57] star in his industry
[1:01:59] figuratively.
[1:02:01] And [music] brother Martin himself,
[1:02:04] social media uh uh guru. And so there's
[1:02:09] as [music] Paul said, I I wrote you
[1:02:11] before to not keep company with a web
[1:02:13] developer and and a social media
[1:02:16] engineer. I says, but you know what I
[1:02:18] realized?
[1:02:20] that they can't just make it this
[1:02:22] prohibition on a certain class of
[1:02:24] people. Absolutely. So he he did strip
[1:02:27] away to be on guard about influences and
[1:02:29] negativity. But he said the real problem
[1:02:33] is when we allow ourselves to be subject
[1:02:35] to [music] the wrong influences
[1:02:38] by building community around the wrong
[1:02:40] things and communicating [music] about
[1:02:41] the wrong things.
[1:02:43] And so the world is rich with tools that
[1:02:45] we can utilize to our advantage. There's
[1:02:48] actually necessary tools that we have to
[1:02:51] have. I would suggest that there's a
[1:02:54] number of professions that it's
[1:02:55] absolutely impossible to be employed and
[1:02:58] to make a living without a cell phone,
[1:03:00] without internet access. And there's
[1:03:02] some businesses that absolutely have to
[1:03:04] have social media. It's a means of
[1:03:07] marketing. It's a means of communicating
[1:03:08] with [music] your customers. So, I'm not
[1:03:10] saying that that's all fruit of the
[1:03:12] poisonous vine that if you if you if you
[1:03:15] just use it, you're all a sudden
[1:03:17] inflicted,
[1:03:19] but it's something that we could [music]
[1:03:20] look at as parents and ask ourselves,
[1:03:22] well, modern mediums are a lot different
[1:03:25] than [music] they were before.
[1:03:28] And whereas I might have needed to at
[1:03:30] one time disguise myself and travel to
[1:03:33] indoor [music] and inquire of the witch
[1:03:36] to communicate with the dead, now the
[1:03:38] influences are just everywhere.
[1:03:41] I don't know why I whispered,
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; but it's all over the place influencing
[1:03:45] us, plaguing our minds, and in many ways
[1:03:49] it is a channel that has communicated
[1:03:53] darkness into our spirits.
[1:03:55] And I want to be more aware than I've
[1:03:57] ever been before about where the
[1:03:59] darkness is coming from.
[1:04:02] That's a secret to happiness. [music]
[1:04:05] There you go. I turned it back around to
[1:04:06] happiness. You want to be happy? Find
[1:04:09] all those things that are just sucking
[1:04:10] it right out of you. And it's those
[1:04:13] necromancers. It's those mediums. It's
[1:04:15] those wizards and [music] witches
[1:04:17] that'll take your joy right out of you.
[1:04:19] Heavenly Father, tonight as we close
[1:04:21] this service, we need your grace.
[1:04:24] Lord, I appreciate just uh how you were
[1:04:28] able to deal with my heart to express a
[1:04:31] very difficult [music] subject.
[1:04:34] And Lord, I don't want to be one that's
[1:04:36] just uh up here bashing technology or
[1:04:39] social media or just calling out
[1:04:41] smartphones as being of the devil, but
[1:04:45] it's it's more nuanced than that,
[1:04:47] [music]
[1:04:50] Lord. It's just recognizing how there's
[1:04:52] this fusion and this this mixture of
[1:04:55] things that have now changed the
[1:04:57] technology.
[1:05:00] We could all have cell phones [music]
[1:05:02] and we could just establish certain
[1:05:03] parameters around those
[1:05:06] such that we're not [music] texting late
[1:05:07] at night or we're not calling the wrong
[1:05:10] people.
[1:05:12] But once that cell phone quote unquote
[1:05:15] gets smart and now we have access
[1:05:19] and it becomes a medium for so many
[1:05:21] different [music] influences.
[1:05:24] Lord, it the stakes are so much higher
[1:05:26] now.
[1:05:29] The risk to our teenagers by allowing
[1:05:31] them to adopt these technologies at a
[1:05:33] young age is much greater.
[1:05:36] And Lord, if the world recognizes that
[1:05:42] teenagers of a certain age shouldn't
[1:05:43] have a cell phone, and now even mental
[1:05:45] health professionals are saying, "We
[1:05:46] recognize there's a huge problem and
[1:05:48] this is what's caused it." And don't
[1:05:49] even let a 2-year-old have a screen and
[1:05:51] there's so many so much panic in the
[1:05:52] world. Lord, certainly we could be a
[1:05:54] little bit more prudent about this.
[1:05:59] And recognize
[1:06:01] once again, Lord, maybe not worrying
[1:06:03] about so much of all the poison that's
[1:06:05] out there, but recognize we have a
[1:06:08] source of truth.
[1:06:10] We have one that we can go to
[1:06:14] and that if we can increase the
[1:06:16] frequency of the latter part of
[1:06:17] Deuteronomy 18, it will help us with the
[1:06:19] former part.
[1:06:23] Lord, all the mediums that exist in the
[1:06:24] world today are so blended in and so
[1:06:28] subtle, hide behind so many things
[1:06:30] [music] that are attractive and even
[1:06:32] often very useful.
[1:06:35] So Lord, may we hold so much more
[1:06:36] closely to your oldfashioned [music]
[1:06:40] neverfailing way of feeding our faith
[1:06:43] and that's [music] your word.
[1:06:46] And may it may it equip us as adults who
[1:06:48] have to handle cell phones and just how
[1:06:51] easily it is for us to get sucked into
[1:06:53] things. May it help [music] us as
[1:06:55] parents who need to demonstrate a a
[1:06:59] a faithfulness [music] in these things.
[1:07:02] Teach our children just the dangers of
[1:07:04] it. Lord, I want to be able to teach my
[1:07:07] children and appropriately watch out for
[1:07:08] them so that when they do come of age
[1:07:10] and of necessity, they now have their
[1:07:12] own cell phone, their own act [music]
[1:07:14] data plans and all the filters are off
[1:07:16] and they're able to make their own
[1:07:17] decisions that all of a sudden it isn't
[1:07:19] just a free-for-all.
[1:07:21] And they don't get to go on their, you
[1:07:23] know, mission out into the world to
[1:07:24] drink and to [music] smoke and do
[1:07:26] whatever they want and just fill up with
[1:07:27] all the things that are now available to
[1:07:29] them. But they'll have had their
[1:07:30] character forged, their eyes open to
[1:07:34] understand now [music] to exercise this
[1:07:36] wisdom that's being cultivated
[1:07:39] to see what it can cause through terms
[1:07:40] of anxiety and depression and rejection
[1:07:43] and wickedness and regret and say,
[1:07:46] "Lord, as for me in my heart, I I want
[1:07:48] to keep my spirit [music] clean. I want
[1:07:51] to be used by you, Lord. I want to be an
[1:07:54] effective husband and father, Lord, as I
[1:07:56] grow up. I I want to be a good friend."
[1:07:58] and we recognize all these things that
[1:08:00] [music] would just weaken us. Father,
[1:08:03] bless your people tonight. I pray a
[1:08:05] special prayer for the parents, for
[1:08:06] [music] our young people, Lord, being
[1:08:08] intentional, Lord, with the prior sermon
[1:08:11] of poison and even tonight to call out
[1:08:13] social media.
[1:08:15] Maybe we could be a little bit more
[1:08:16] savvy [music] as parents to inquire
[1:08:19] about what's what's going on with this
[1:08:22] game, what's going on with this
[1:08:23] platform, what's going on on Discord,
[1:08:24] what's going on on this, so that we
[1:08:27] could understand better what our
[1:08:28] children are going through and how to
[1:08:30] better help them. Bless us tonight, I
[1:08:32] pray in the name of [music] Lord Jesus
[1:08:34] Christ. Amen.
