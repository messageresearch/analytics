TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm G I want to try to finish our thought on the big three today and today we're going to be focusing specifically on the pride of life and popularity the pride of life is that coveting after honor or Applause uh the pride of life and popularity is kind of being hungry for um or needy for acceptance and we're taking that phrase The Big Three from John where it says all that is in the world the lust of the eye the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life is of the world it's not of the father but is of the world and when it comes to the big three those thingss we're kind of running them um in line with money women and popularity lust of the flesh is money the lust of the eye um corresponds to women pride of life to popularity and we've been looking at the running greedily after the ER of balum for reward which is the money the lust of the Flesh and the way of Cain which we see in the lust of the eye in women and then we'll be looking at the gain saying of Kora that relates to the popularity and the pride of life so I know there's a lot of layers to this cake but I hope you enjoy it while you eat it and we made a point Wednesday night that in when it comes to those things and we use the big three just to be able to refer to it um collectively very quickly the only thing that gives you absolute power over them is faith in the word of God if you don't have faith in the word of God then you're absolutely subject to the big three but by faith in the word of God you can have absolute power over these things I'd like to uh since we're wrapping up the subject of the big three Lord will and I'd like just to give a quick review of the first two the lust of the flesh we could see that scripturally it relates to the things related to the body see taste feel smell and hear uh to run greedily after reward uh that was the heir of balum who denied the word of God for money and he was very subtle in the way that he did it the way that he approached it he seems to be maybe a sympathetic character or appeared to be someone who's very honorable but his he um he was fostering these certain affections in his heart and he was satisfied he satisfied his covetousness he satisfied his longing uh for money at any expense even if that meant he caused Israel to stumble even if that meant he contradicted the word of the Lord and so baalam was acting solely to please his flesh to please the blood and his flesh and blood and solely for financial gain with the lust of the eyes that relates to the mind it's that emotional and intellectual part of the human being It's associated with the way of Cain wherein he had this rebellion and refusal to submit to the word of God and he was using the Optics to satisfy himself and using pretense as a way of uh thinking that he was right in other words in looking at we could say that he silence the voice of the word uh because he was satisfied with the outward display he was concerned uh about the outward display and it was related to beauty and we saw that in the Temptation in the garden where the woman saw that the tree was good for food and then she saw it Pleasant to the eyes and we see it with Christ turn the stones made to bread and also see these kingdoms Bow Down and Worship me so we see those things running together now in the pride of life I'd like to point out this part that as I studied this as I saw things related to the body and then to the Spirit uh there's this connection C of the pride of life to the soul write down where the man really is what he is as a person and when we are given to the pride of life we are driven by pride and that pride is fed by doubt it's not fed by faith it's not fed by the word but it's fed by doubt insecurity things that relate to Pride and in the gainsaying of cores we'll look in Greater detail today they rejected the prophet they rejected the word uh because they wanted a part or they wanted a role they wanted to be equal with the prophet so the pride of life is that Desiring recognition that coveting after praise we use the Pharisees as an example showing off uh for the sake of acceptance or to be perceived as right that's that Pharisee Spirit Satan tempted Jesus to this when he said jump God will save you what would that be doing showing off God said if I jump off a building or God said if I he wouldn't allow me to be harm so I'll just jump off this building right sometimes we say I know this is what God wants me to do so nothing's going to stop me nothing's going to keep me from it and so there's this uh maybe there's this fine line between uh faith and showing off where if your heart's not right your motive is not right you're not approaching it the right way then you're just trying to self fulfill the word of God and show off that he's going to back you up and become sort of showman or or or display something for the purpose of pretense and to the woman when she saw that the tree was to be desired to make one wise to become Godlike she wanted to become like God but not the god of the scripture or the true God but this perverted characterization of God so the soul or we could say it's the heart body spirit and heart or the soul of man that's the source of Pride we know according to the message of the hour that in the soul there exist um a dove nature or a serpent nature when you're born again the serpent nature is uh is done away with it's cast out it dies and so there's these two senses that govern someone who's not born again it's this believing or doubt and so faith and doubt you have the sense of Faith or doubt and I would say pride is the weakness for everyone who does not have the Holy Ghost pride is the weakness for anyone without a new birth because it's fed by doubt pride is fed by doubt and so where that pride is um it it has this ability to kind of lift up the Flesh in ways that we don't quite uh maybe think of being lifted up but I believe a lot of times things that appear to be humility are false humility because of Pride there's people who don't want you to do something for oh please don't do that for me no I don't want it don't do this don't do that and they refuse to have anything done for them and you think wow they're they're pretty humble they just don't ever want anyone to do something for them well look at that from a different perspective it could be Pride they're not willing to Humble themselves and just let somebody else do something for them and it's not necessarily rooted in an arrogance but it's rooted in a complex it's rooted in some sort of self-perception or fear of how they're going to be perceived by others and in Psalm 244 it says he that hath Clean Hands these are the ones that will not be on that Holy Mountain or um who will be there he says he that hath Clean Hands and a pure heart who ha not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully I know there's a lot captured there but a pure heart in one who has not lifted up his soul pridefully he's not lifted it up in vanity so it's from that soul for where a what a man really is uh and who he is his character and what he is deep down in his heart when he has lifted up his soul in Pride and with vanity or showing off somebody who doesn't do that would be an heir to this mountain to be the kingdom in habac 2:4 and I apologize if I'm going kind of fast this morning I'm wanting just to show how pride is related to that that heart of a man behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith so the soul that is lifted up is not pleasing to the Lord a soul that is prideful a soul that is arrogant a soul that is showing off is not upright in him that is not pure in heart he says but the just shall live by faith and to me that that begins to form this different characterization of one's heart or one's Soul the one that is lifted up by Pride still has the fuel of Doubt but when the just live by faith and and notice the connection there that the soul that is uh lifted up is looking maybe to himself and looking to what he does and he's justified by his works and his uh his efforts and everything he's do his showing off he feels justifies them but then the word says but the just shall live by his faith so we're justified by faith apart from the law that our justification isn't in how good we can be and how clean we can live and how how people receive Us and how much we're accepted if there's going to be people that will take justification by faith and take believe only and turn it into lasciviousness it's just in their nature to do it and what I wouldn't want to do is Rob the believer who is Born Again by the word of God robbed from them the ability to live by faith and find their Acceptance in the Beloved by faith and faith alone I wouldn't want to take that away from them just because there's a bunch of people who don't know how to handle Grace so I I feel that there's no danger in preaching the word of God in such a way to where the elect every time they hear the word of God are connected deep more deeply with Christ by faith and have a greater appreciation for the word just to believe it and accept it and and not be wor worried about those that just walk away and say well I believe I'm fine Galatians 3:1 it says but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God so God is not looking to your showing off he's not looking as to whether or not you can fulfill everything and so this man who is Justified who feels he's justified by the law Paul's saying you're not in the sight of God he says it is evident for the just shall live by faith there are no works that justify us now we could look it from John's standpoint and excuse me James standpoint he begins to look at it from the standpoint of God uh Paul looks at from the standpoint of God that he justifies you by your faith we're anchored there we believe it we accept it that's where we're we're rooted in and then we know that a life that has been changed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost a life that has the grace of God upon it then will live a life that is in continuity with the spirit of the word of God and therefore your Works justify that you've been born again in that sense that James is looking at it but here there are no works that justify you in the sight of God there's no amount of showing off that's going to save you or vindicate you so in Psalm 34:2 it says my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad The Unborn again Soul has this weakness of doubt that chokes out faith in the word of God The Unborn again Soul has this weakness of doubt that hinders the growth of the word so when we can allow our souls to just be make her boast in the Lord to be justified by faith that's a soul that has cast down Pride this the heart of the man is closely connected with this pride of life and we see the example in Saul and popularity so as s brother brandom teaches that Saul represented this danger of popularity he says Saul fell by Pride popularity is it means to uh be to be beloved by people or to enjoy being liked enjoy being admired and supported and so this diff popularity is to be admired and liked and enjoyed by a lot of people and the D danger the temptation of popularity is to really really like it to be influenced by it Luke chapter 6: 26 this is a little bit of review from Wednesday it warns when beware when and woe when all men speak well of you because there's this danger within our human nature that we want to please others and so we'll say to things to people that we think they want to hear so that they like us or so that we don't alienate ourselves from them and Jesus is saying look what you did to the prophets if they spoke good to you they were your Prophet if they didn't you rejected them so be Leery and beware when all speak well of you because there in lies the the the sin of the pride of life or the danger of popularity in John 12:43 it says that many didn't believe and then it said some did but they were afraid to follow follow or they're afraid to say that they believed because they would get kicked out of their church and so it says for they love the praise of men more than the praise of God when you love the praise of men when you want to be justified in the sight of men more than you want to be justified in the sight of God when you're more worried about how your Works can declare to others whether or not you're a good person than you are that your faith declares to God that you believe then that's the danger for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God maybe we could argue it's not wrong to love the praise of men we could try that out on anybody here and we could prove that human as human beings we we like it when we're praised we're like it when we're told good things and we receive those affirmations that uh encourage Us in things that we're doing but when we love that and look to that more than the praise of God that's when it becomes a stumbling block to ourselves Wednesday night we looked at how Saul is the example of this weakness of the pride of life and popularity when the children of Israel rejected God they asked for a king and so God when he chose the first king he wanted to kind of embody the attitude of the people in that King and he got one that was Head and Shoulders above everybody handsome a goodly and he was somebody that well like if we ever thought of a king this is the king but when Samuel comes to Saul he says is not the all of the desire of Israel upon you in 1st Samuel 9 verse 21 Saul's response is well I'm from the smallest tribe in the least of all the families of the smallest tribe and he seems to be demonstrating humility but really what's behind all of it is an insecurity he's kind of fixated on the fact that his tribe is the smallest one he's kind of fixated on the fact that uh his family is the least of those and he's worried about reputation and the size of things and and I do believe that if there were some humility here he did see himself as part of the smallest tribe and he did see him self as being part of the smallest of the families and so it's maybe there's some humility in the fact that he's willing to acknowledge that he's willing to accept that but he was insecure because of that and these insecurities and the complexes that Saul had they are the products of Pride and I think it's good for us all to consider that when we begin to think well my complexes are solely the result of how I was treated when I was growing up and my insecurities are solely the result of how this person did this and that person did that then there's this way that we kind of absolve ourselves from the way that we Act and the way that we've been nurtured uh and turned into the person that we are and we're not willing to take responsibility but if we begin to recognize that Pride at some point has grabbed a hold of those things and is using it as this excuse that can never be killed just keeps getting back up no uh-uh not my fault not my fault but if we realize that pride is the one that uses it so fre frequently then it gives us it begins to allow the word of God to work in our lives to heal us of those complexes guide us where these insecurities exist and if anything submit him completely and totally to God so he can use them Saul we'll see later Saul in his insecurities wasn't disqualified from being King but when not surrendered to God when not subject to the spirit they became his worst enemy so these insecurities and complexes arise through Pride wherein we lack trust in God when we have had something happen to us or we make a mistake and we are insecure because our pride then we're not trusting God that he'll use all things we're not trusting God that he knoweth all things and and that there's a plan that he has for us in 1st Samuel chapter 10 we see that when Saul is going to be coronated his King before the people they looked around and they couldn't find him and the Lord said behold he hath hid himself among the stuff and um this was not again an act of humility though I I don't want to completely take that away from Saul but when we look at his life story you can kind of look back like we did with balum you could kind of look back and go ah I think I see what's happening here Saul was afraid of being rejected Saul was insecure about whether or not the people would really want him to be king and so this maybe there's some humility there but lurking behind that is this insecurity that drove him to hide and if I could put it this way Saul had this desperate need for acceptance and it was always driving him to do what he was doing he craved to be accepted he desired to be validated he wanted to be approved he he wanted people to think that he was kingly he wanted people to think that he made the right decisions he wanted to uh be accepted and approved and this is what led to his downfall we saw it in 1st Samuel 13 when he offered sacrifice untimely instead of waiting for Sam he said I saw that the people were scattered from me when he did not fulfill the Commandment of the Lord and destroying all the amalekites he said I feared the people and obeyed their voice if you look at these very deeply as I hope to do a little bit better today at the at the heart of what Saul is doing his pride and I'll say this for all of us it leads us to think that our success is dependent upon what we do and not what God does that it leads us to think that well it this is contingent upon my abilities and my effort and my acting and my thinking and not God's and the pride of life will drive us to determine our value by what other people think of us instead of what God thinks about us this is at the heart of Saul's discontent the the heart of Saul's Madness ultimately is he's always looking to his own abilities instead of what God Said and in essence that's what Samuel is talking to him about initially saying well what does it matter if you're the smallest if God chooses you why would you run and hide when you're being coronated King a a and anointed to be king God chose you and you notice there's a difference in Saul to David David this young young kid he's not kingly uh uh like Saul and Saul is hiding and Saul is insecure but when David's called he just Embraces it and he accepts it it's such a stark contrast to these complexes of Saul so our pride and popular pride of life will cause us to rest more on our abilities than resting on God's truth to trust in ourself than to trust in God and this desire to be accepted this PR popularity will cause us to determine our self-worth by what other people think other people's opinions other than what God said about us in Jude 11 verse 11 as it speaks of the way of Cain and running greedily after the heir of balam it says and perished in the gain saying of Kora this is harmonious to the pride of life popularity Saul you'll see the Same Spirit working as it worked even in Cain as it worked in the garden as it tried to work on Christ wherein Saul was motivated by jealousy and personal gain Kora is the same way in the gain saing of core we see the pride of life and the Lust For popularity this desire for status as we read in numbers 16 starting with verse two it says and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel so what I've transitioned to now is to examine the gain saing of Kora to understand better this pride of life in this temptation of popularity as it worked on Saul certain men rose up before Moses with certain Children of the uh certain of the children of Israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown you no what they're kind of going for here consensus popularity uh those that are famous certain children princes famous renowned this is a popularity contest this is showing off this is trying to see who has the biggest campaign rally and and so here was let's get as many uh name brands as possible let's get as many recognizable people uh if there was a front Court they wanted to have all the celebrities sitting on the front row like these are the people that attend attend this kind of rally and it says and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron I wonder if you were handed a flyer and it said certain of the children of Israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men are renowned the premium Ministry are going to be preaching next weekend and we would we would just we would run there you mean the elite Aid is preaching that convention I got to be there right you'd want to be there and then only to find out that they were gathering themselves against the message of the hour and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them you take too much upon you now notice just how much this argument would appeal to the people seeing all the congregation Are Holy and all the congregation go yeah sounds good to me and every one of them and the Lord is among them say on Kora this is sounding really good then why do you lift yourself up above the congregation of Lord and people are sitting there going yeah do you ever think about that we can be we're holy God is amongst us I I we ate the Mana we ate the quail God Vindicated his presence with all of us who do these guys think they are so it is a it's an argument that I think kind of couches itself a little bit in this humility pleading on behalf of the underserved a a and giving voice to the voiceless and the victims and the people the masses they are holy you put too much on yourself you're taking too much control and I'd like to skip to verse n because I think we got enough at least to understand the setting and how that Moses is going to say all right God will prove God will show who he's with not that he's not with Israel but he's going to prove he's not with this movement not with these guys no matter how many celebrities they could get to attend no matter how this would appeal to the Flesh of the people make them feel like they're doing something they're a part of something God is going to Moses said God's going to vindicate it but then this is Moses's rebuke in verse 9 seeth that it but a small thing under you what is it is it Beneath You Now is it too little for you just to be a help in the house of the Lord is it too little for you just to be close enough and to be put in this office and to be put in this position and do what you God's asked you to do are you now when it says do it seem a small thing you're looking down on it you want this isn't popular enough this isn't prestigious enough this isn't going to get me enough clout seeth it but a small thing un you that God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the Tabernacle of the Lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them now he's saying this is not this isn't a small thing this is a great honor and a privilege but what does the pride of life do you begin to belittle great things things that are great in the eyes of God when you begin to look through the lens of popularity you begin to think well I want attention I want my name on the Marquee I want to be recognized I want to I want to do more I want to live more I want to be accepted more he says and Heath brought thee near to him and all thy Brethren the sons of Levi with thee and seeky the priesthood also what's driving it it's this it's behind it is this pride of life behind is the pride to say well I don't want to just be the guy washing the utensils I don't want to be the guy that's just leading the chorus I don't want to be the guy that's handling dead animals and all these things I want to be the main man I want to be the priest I want to be the prophet and he says for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the Lord because of this attitude you're gathered against God he says what is Aaron that you murmur against him I should I should make this my my avatar what is Aaron that you murmur against him I want to get a bumper sticker number 1611b will be my my license plate what is Aaron and I like how I what what is Aaron that you murmur against him many times when people say so and so got engaged I always say to what what is Aaron that you murmur against you say now why you picking on Aaron wh why why is it why do you have such an attitude if I could say it this way they were presuming above their calling and brother bam touches a lot on presuming and what it is Dev Venture without Authority uses it quite a bit and there's this idea that they wanted it's it's to act without justif proper justification but you have it in your mind presumptively so it's a justification that the man finds within himself within his own soul to cause him to presume to venture without proper authority to act without permission and this is exactly what they're doing they're Gathering against the Lord and and their their campaign slogan is uh we the people all men are created equal we are all holy we are all one we are we all deserve a part but disregarding the clear Vindication of God and even what the overall message was to them it wasn't just to lift up Moses but God was was using what they asked for to lead them into the promised land the word of God had never failed and so they were presuming above what God had called them to and as we continue reading in numbers 16 it's really interesting they had formed their own Camp the language that God uses is so remarkable they had kind of their own movement their own denomination was being formed right underneath in this Exodus and they had kind of formed their own uh Fellowship as an equal to Moses as this kind of counterculture to Moses and I say that to make this point not so much rejecting it as much but as much trying to exist alongside of it they didn't go to Moses and say hey Moses you're dead to us we've got our own leader now we're we're we're going to take this guy and we're going to take this guy and they're going to lead us now it's kind of like Hey we're with you God's with you but they wanted to be identified with it and be equal with it so in verses 23 and 24 and also 26 the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about the Tabernacle of Kora Dayan and Abraham notice he calls it the Tabernacle it's not just referred to as you'll see later a collection of tents but now and even if you go back and I was studying what the rabbis how they interpreted it and but the the traditional oral history would would have been back there in the Old Testament that there was some joining together of these of these families underneath one tent and that they begin to Fellowship together and God recognizes it as a tabernacle of Kora so he tells them in verse 26 and he spake Moses says spake under the congregation saying catch this this really want this to hit hard depart I pray you from the tth of these wicked men in touch nothing of theirs L you be consumed in all their sins God exposes this religious demonstration this religious rattling cry as just pure selfish ambition these were tents of wicked men the Tabernacle of Kora had been set up right alongside the the the message of th right alongside the the Tabernacle of witness facing the very same thing not leaving it but in the in the midst of it setting up their own Camp what was it competition that's what pride of life will lead to is competition what does po it lead us to comparison this is not rejecting it but this is maybe unknowns to themselves competing with it and what they tried to do God God sends judgment against these Rebels and he threatens to destroy all Israel God affirms Moses and he gives the punishment and then once the punishment's given he's saying only the seed of Aaron can offer incense in verse 39 and elezar the priest took the Brazen sensors wherein they they that were burnt had offered and they were made broad plates for covering of the altar notice to be a memorial under the children of Israel that no stranger which is not the seed of Aaron come near to offer incense before the Lord that he be not as Kora and as his company as the Lord said to him by the hand of Moses don't be like Cor be not as Kora and as his company who presumed to be able to take the place or to be equal to or to exist right right within the framework of it but all the while ignoring and denying the clear will of God and this was set to be a memorial under the children of Israel that no one other than the priesthood could offer incense and maybe in your mind you've already gone right to this place in scripture but in 2 Chronicles 26 Uzziah does that very thing and as you study the life of Uzziah this is the only blemish on his record he was upright and did a lot of great things and he otherwise would have been a perfect King but it says in verse 16 but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction when he was blessed when he succeeded when he was strong his heart got lifted up he was no longer resting in something Beyond himself but begin to think look what I've done he got lifted up in his soul he got the pride of life he got kind of eased into this popularity this thirsty to be accepted and be perceived as great and he got lifted up to his Destruction for he transgressed against the Lord his God and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense to do so he would have had to ignore the memorial to do so he would have ignored the reminder he would have ignored everything that signified and said you've never done this a day in your life there's only certain people who do this you cannot intrude on upon this office but yet he steps Beyond his own calling and he presumes Beyond it even if I could say maybe not above your calling but out of your calling into somebody else's and then immediately Azariah the priest went in after him and with four score Priests of the Lord that were Valiant men and they with stod Uzziah the king and said him it pertaineth not under the Uzziah to burn incense unto the Lord but to the priest of the sons of Aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou has trespassed neither shall it be for thine honor from the Lord God that's powerful the grace that was being extended to King Uzziah In This Moment was you're not allowed to do this stop it's not going to honor the lord it's not going to bring to you what you think it can bring you this isn't right don't do it and he's been confronted by all these priests and Azariah and it says in verse 19 then Uzziah was wroth wow it's it's akin to those that whenever they're confronted with truth in the reality instead of just being like oh I am so sorry they get angry and before you start trying to identify all the canes and all theas and all the souls in your life it's you it's human nature I'm sorry it's me and you're all like okay yeah all right that's better we were trying to figure out who it was it's you all right what about Aaron what is Aaron Uzziah was wroth and had a sensor in his hand to burn incense and while he was wroth with the priest other words when it says the Sens was still say he didn't stop what he was doing he was going to keep doing it the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priest in the house of the Lord and beside the incense altar leprosy is a type of sin remember Gesa in Second Kings I think chapter 5 when he uh Elisha that non got was washed and he was made clean he wanted to present a bunch of gifts to Elisha and what did Elisha do say I don't need it lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life man that's the big three everything you're offering me he he in in that whole story he's denying all of it but Gesa is sitting there kind of going really all right okay non leaves him what does Gesa do he runs after him and says um he changed his mind he wants all of it non's Happ happy to give it and what happened to G Gesa leprosy it's a it's leprosy is a type of sin as brother bam says quite often it happens when one acts for the wrong motive and the wrong objective deceitfully the gain saying of core is typified in this stepping outside of a calling this religious movement this religious demonstration but yet there's selfish ambition it's for popularity it's for pride it's for politicking it's showing off and well as we'll go further you see that there's this pattern of changing God's word for personal benefit changing the if we change the word of God for our benefit it's rooted in the pride of life has some connection with popularity when we ignore water down modify or make an excuse to indulge or cater to the pride of life or cater to The Big Three that's that's that that's uh the pride of life that's popularity anytime we say wellow I'm going to make an excuse for it I'm GNA I I'm going to change this or I want to indulge I want to cater to to any one of these things it's generally going to be this pride of life I want to come out looking right in the end and again it isn't a rejection of the word the label to be a word rejector is for those that are familiar with the message of the hour no one would say well I'm a Christian but I reject the Bible is it safe to say I'm a Christian but I reject Christ as being the Christ it just I believe Jesus died for my sins but I don't believe Jesus was the Messiah so there's you can have this there's just this in there's this logic that people come to ultimately to realize that well I can't reject the word and be right that's right and I can't openly reject the word so what you want to do is you want to change the word that you're receiving or ignore the word that does isn't uh convenient as we've already seen a lot of this in the series on Liberty but so it's not necessarily rejecting the word but it's ignoring the full word and this Spirit we can see in Exodus 32:1 Moses was up on the Mountaintop he's getting Commandments from the Lord God is speaking to him and it says when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him up make us Gods which shall go before us for as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we what not what has become of him they know that Moses is the one that God used to lead them out they don't say that it was any anybody else they're not alleging anything to cast aspersion on his testimony so I would say they're not rejecting Moses but they're dishonoring his message because of impatience if they had been listening to what he had been teaching all those years if they'd been picking up what he was laying down they would have been able just to wait and say look God's been with us this far Moses is up on that mountain just be patient the promise is we won't die in the wilderness the promise is we're going to a land filled with milk and honey this is what God has promised us to stay the course I know there's a lot uh transpiring in these things things that you could pick out of and give more context to it but they were dishonoring the message and as you're familiar with this story this is wherein they worship the golden calf and so the people see that Moses hadn't come they don't know what's happened to him what are we going to do they're not rejecting him but they're saying in his absence what do we do we've been waiting nothing's happened nothing's changed what do we do and so Aid commands the people to get all their gold together and he Fashions and he makes according to the narrative in the bib Bible as we read it he fashion a golden calf and it says in verse 6 and they rose up early on the tomorrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and Rose up to play it's a it's a feast it's a shouting it's a dancing rose up the play they're making marry it's it's this exuberance it's demonstrative and the Lord said unto Moses go get thee down for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them notice just how he's saying that as he said before these wicked men a and they're they're departing from the truth and you're trespassing against the Lord and youve Rose up against the Lord in this act they've turned aside out of the way which he had commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshiped it and have sacrificed there un to and said these be thy Gods oh go Israel which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt it's human nature to want to make a God out of something you can see something you can touch and make yourself think that it speaks to you or that it moves and so this is the worst of humanity to take something and substitute it for God you could take just even the Brazen serpent that that is used in the wilderness to stay the the the poison and the plague of serpents they turned around and turn that into an artifact to worship it's human nature to want to take take things make Idols out of them whether it be the gifts or whether it be uh physical locations it's human nature to turn them into gods and make them have the preeminence at the expense of God himself and now notice how Joshua who's waiting down the mountain for Moses Moses comes down says when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto Moses there is a noise of war in the Camp W Lor right who'll stand draw your swords greatest battle ever fought let's take let's take Richmond right there a shadow war in the camp there's a new testament bride rising up she's going to go to war well here's a noise of war in the camp and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for Mastery because they have conquered some something neither is the voice of them that cry for being overcome as one that would lament being conquered but the noise of them that sing do I hear this word sing here I want you to really uh meditate on this a little bit it's the same word that is used of Mariam in Exodus 15 when she answered them and began to sing and dance and so if we just took Exodus 32 and said oh well wherever you hear the noise of war and wherever you hear singing and wherever you see dancing it's a wicked spirit and it's evil and it's not right but then we remember that Mariam answered that means she sang She Dem she demonstrates her joy and her enthusiasm in this time that they begin to cross over the Red Sea and their enemy is destroyed brother B said if I've ever seen a Holy Roller that is it if there ever was a Pentecostal meeting that was it right and maybe they had that image in mind when they did what they did in Exodus 32 it's the same thing let me say this noise isn't always the sound of Liberty noise isn't always the sound of Freedom where you have noise where you have shouting and where you have dancing it does not always mean that there is freedom and so if we cannot take this scripture to say that singing and shouting and dancing is evil then we cannot take Exodus 15 to say that every time it happens it's exactly right or it vindicates anything amen it just is what it is we're human beings I imagine if we were all pigs and the presence of the Lord came down we would just all squeal and grunt right if we were all goats we might faint right run to the highest spot we could I mean that's that's what we would do but we're humans so we have ways of expressing ourselves we have ways of when you fill the spirit move we have ways of being enthused and being excited the noise of them that sing do I hear and it came to pass as soon he came nigh under the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and Moses's anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and break them beneath the mount quite a scene it's not a rejection of the word but right there at the base of the mountain right there as the prophets descending with the Ten Commandments they Aaron has made this decision to create and form another Idol that you'll find later comes up again where they form these two two golden calves later in the Kingdom in in Israel and it causes the people to commit idolatry and brother bam connects Kora to the spirit behind the golden calf brother benam is making them uh synonymous he says it in spoken words The Original Seed I believe it's with the pick up your pen and write so he says it it's written in the pergam Church age this way now the people back there after they had heard the true word and were well acquainted with the fact that a true Prophet was Vindicated of God I say those people fell for Kora and his gain sayings now when we think of the gain SS of Kora we might be in numbers uh 16 and we're thinking about this but now brother bram's going to bring it to Exodus 32 as well cor was not a scriptural Prophet but the people in great numbers with their leaders went him how like the Evangelist today with their golden calf schemes like Kor they look good to the people as cor look good then this is that Spirit popularity and this acceptance and and to be perceived a certain way they look good to the people as Kora looked good then they have blood on their foreheads oil on their hands and balls of fire on the platform that's what they have they have a show right gets a crowd gets a following so after they've heard the true word and they're acquainted with the fact that a true Prophet was Vindicated of God so it happens after the message has been established it happens after it's been accepted it's happened after they know well enough to stay with the word of God Kor evangelists come along with their golden calf schemes that catch the eye of the people and they want to be a part of it they don't want to be left out it's a spirit of Kora the gains of Kora and it's associated with this golden calf in this Worship in Exodus 32 what happens just as core was not rejecting the prophet but trying to exist alongside of it in Exodus chapter 32 there's this religious outpouring this religious fervor and what is it a lack of faith and trust in the word of God changing it to change the narrative oh this is what is our Revival not the word of God but these these this is the god that brought us out of Egypt you can have your golden C and eat it too you can have it you can create it you can make it but what leads us what's leading Us in this Third Exodus isn't another man isn't some golden calf isn't it's the word of God and the word only I bring it to this point here and I realize I'm going to be taking a little bit longer on this than maybe we have with some of these other services but but the people with Aaron they show the pride of life they're acting because of the pride of life they're influenced by this desire to be accepted popularity pride of life and this is the same desire that ultimately leads them to want a king and I say this to you in just this brief brief interval here before we go into more about Saul or in this part about uh the golden calf but I say it so you can realize that popularity isn't always the problem for the one that's up front popularity isn't necessarily for the one that's leading you don't look at the king say well his problem is popularity do you realize if your name is never even mentioned and you never seen that popularity can be your problem it can be your Achilles Hill it could be your biggest weakness so popularity isn't just for the person out front but it's also a temptation to those that are following because often we'll follow because the pride of life we'll follow because of popularity we want to be accepted we we want to be in we don't want to be left out whatever the fomo might be we want to be sure that we're there we're a part of it and you may not be the one leading it you may not be the one getting credit your name may not be in the credits or the Marquee but you want to be a part of it and the very thing that's leading the leader is the very thing that's leading you the very thing that is a temptation to the king is the very thing that's a temptation to all the subjects because it wasn't just Kora and Dayan and Abraham that went before him but they able to get men of renown and people had status and able to cause the people why the Same Spirit works on the followers that works on the leaders in Exodus 3221 and 22 and Moses said unto Aaron what did this people do unto you what did this people unto thee that thou has brought so great a sin upon them what did what did you how did you let the people do this to you Moses no doubt was familiar with Aaron he knew that Aaron was familiar with what God required and he's like how did you do this and Aaron said let not the anger of my Lord Wax Hot he's speaking to Moses thou knowest the people that they are set on Mischief that's my other bumper sticker you know what is Aaron well thou knowest the people and that they're set on Mischief it's pride pride of the people perverts the desire for popularity because we could say well being famous in itself isn't wrong being popular isn't wrong I mean if if that was so if we really really hated somebody in the church let's just make them the most popular person do you know brother Joel Kawai do you know him have you ever met him and we just make him like we just make not that I hate you brother Joel but there's you just make them popular but just because everybody knows your name doesn't mean know make you evil so it's how Pride works on the fame the acceptance it begins to trust in the fact that wow there's 250 other princes these are men of renown it's Pride that perverts popularity and if you continue Aaron blames the people you know the people they're set on Mischief they're set on evil that that's just the nature of the people and Moses is probably going yeah well yeah I've seen it but Aaron was influenced by the people and you know what Aaron does he doesn't own it what does he say well a gold the golden calf just supernaturally came out it was Miracle it just happened we didn't we didn't beat this out of the people and we didn't drum it up and we didn't manufacture this this just happened it was super it was spontaneous the spontaneous calf came out of it and he lies and brother brandham says in the church age book he said they say never mind what God's word says I'm reading this because I really want to nail down the point how that this pride of life will change the word of God for personal benefit it Waters it down it modifies it at the very least least what it does is it just ignores the full word Les you become in your own mind unpopular never mind what the God's word says you can't understand it we have to interpret it for you furthermore the Bible's not finished it has to change with the times and we'll tell you what the changes are how contrary that is to the word of God that emphatically States let God be true but every man a liar whenever there's a conflict with the truth remember this whereever whenever there's a conflict with the truth you go with the word of God Heaven and Earth will pass away but not one word of God will fail I would even go so I I I feel that this deserves to be said if I ever say something that in your Revelation perception or inspiration however whether I implied or you infer it if I say something that conflicts with the truth conflicts with what God Said you take what God said right I would love it if you could give me the benefit of the doubt said maybe his tongue just slipped maybe I maybe that I didn't quite understand it that way but you take what God says don't ever let anyone stand up here and say well I know brother brandham said this but I'm going to tell you what he means or I know the Bible says this but now it's changed or it's different you've got to go with what God gave you if you want to be a revisionist historian if you want to start changing things to update the context of the time that we're living in you might as well just get rid of the Bible you might as well just get rid of the message of the hour and be your own God and worship your own golden calf there's only one measuring stick there's only one Plum line it's the word of God away with the experience as the plum line away with Miracles and signs and wonders that people try to propagate to vindicate their conflicting truth we love Miracles we love signs and wonders we love the gifts but you've got to stay with the word and when someone uses some Showmanship to lead you from the word wake up you must reject it right Heaven and Earth will pass away but not one a word of God will fail notice this last statement so the people are led by people who presume to be what they're not to presume to assume without with to it means to assume with confidence when you presume you're not just going no it's like this is it right to suppose to be true without proof to go beyond what is proper and right brother M says over and over he says to Adventure without official Authority Venture without official Authority Venture without Authority presuming people are led by people who presume to be what they're not so people are led by people presuming and what do you have to do to follow you presume to they use popularity and pride as an excuse to ignore or disobey or change God's word bringing it back to Samuel I think I can go through this pretty quick and finish today I hope I can finish today but 1st Samuel 13 verses 8 to 14 if you read in there uh Saul Waits until the seventh day just as Samu had appointed and you'll notice this that Samuel said wait wait seven days but even before the seventh day is over Saul calls for peace and burnt offerings so Saul didn't even wait the full time but when he felt like he had waited long enough in his seventh day he was just going to go ahead and declare the Revival himself and in verse 10 and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of of offering the burnt offerings behold Samuel came the day is not over yet so Samuel wasn't late he just wasn't there when Saul wanted him there and Saul went out to meet him and that he might salute him and Samuel said what has thou done and Saul said because I saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed and that the Philistines gathered themselves together mishmash therefore said I the Philistines will come now down now upon me to gilgal and I have not made supplication under the Lord I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering of course he's the victim of course he sacrificed I I didn't want to but you were late and we waited and waited and you didn't come at the right time he says I forced myself to offer these burnt offerings and what's his reasons the people are scattered from me and I was afraid to lose a battle I I was afraid to get beat I'm King and everyone's looking to me and this my first test and this I I've got to perform I got to get this right and I was afraid but Saul's Folly is exposed despite his re religious protestation despite his care for the people his folly is exposed just like Judas was like wow it's a lot of money we're wasting here a we could have sold that and really provided for the poor and everybody's like whoa we didn't even think about that and he's over there going right am I am I right I'm right right like we could feed the Homeless and we could do this and why right I'm right and everybody's like well that sounds like God's over there going uh he's just wants the money he doesn't really care for the poor he's not in it for the people he's in it for himself and Saul was so he was so desperate for approval he wanted to be perceived as great he wanted to come across as confident if I could say this it was only important that he was right and I find this Spirit to be very subtle that people often times they'll argue to no end because in their minds they want to be correct they want to be right and so even when you've convinced them that they're wrong they want to explain to you that they were right for being wrong yeah I know I made a huge mistake but this is the reason why and this so that you're like so I was right right right I'm right right it's like well no you're wrong but it's that Pride you're only worried about being correct you're only worried another way to say you're only worried about being justified in acting was okay fine I sinned but this is why so am I not justified I was doing it for this reason and I saw this need and this was happening and yeah I may be wrong and my cure may be worse than the poison and this may be this way and that may be that way and I might have a lot of lot of reasons why and you want that to justify your error and God saying sorry pal it's air but Saul demonstrates this prideful countenance in this Spirit where he doesn't want to appear foolish doesn't want to look foolish in front of the people and because he didn't want to look bad in front of the people he failed to trust God brother Bram said if I prayed for a thousand I'm kind of butcher it but I think the thought is essentially if I prayed for a thousand people and none of them lived I'd still pray for a thousand and one why because you're trusting God not the not the stats you're you're not running the metrics and say well what what the does anybody know what the odds are when you flip a coin 5050 well what if you flipped the coin a 100 times and it came up heads every time what's the probability on the 101st doesn't change but this is human mindset like uh I'm going to say the odds are U it's changed no it hasn't God has God's word doesn't change you made a promise it's his promise faith in the word of God re the results and those things that's not justification to to maneuver outside the word of God you've got to stay with the word and so the prophet says in verse 13 thou Hast done foolishly thou Hast not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever now I want to say he punishes them where it hurts and he he finds where the pride was this is what was causing your problems as you took too much ownership of the throne you took too much ownership of the crown and now you'll do anything to keep the crown he says but now thy kingdom shall not continue the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord hath commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou Hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee do you realize these words would have stung so deep your kingdom will not continue the Lord's going to find somebody with a better heart he's going to give it to somebody else to be a captain over his people and you haven't come each one was a dagger to a soul that's lifted up with pride why did he do it pride what was his justification the people religion worship 1st Samuel 14 Saul forbids I I want to use this very quickly he forbids in Psalm 14 1st Samuel 14 he forbids any man eat he's really desperate to win this battle he wants to get Victory so he says nobody's to eat until evening that I may be Avenged go read the story that I may be Avenged so he wanted the people to be motivated and so through Pride popularity since that's the subject today he becomes tyrannical he begins to impose upon people something that wasn't reasonable it was irrational he's trying to use fear to Mo motivate them but for whose gain his own I want you guys to be motivated to fight don't eat until the evening till our foe has been vanquished and he acts as a God to the people and says that they may not eat and he threatens death he says curse and as we read later you'll find that essentially we're saying a death penalty to anybody who disobeys so the men slay the Philistines but after they slay them they're famished and they begin to eat the animals raw eat it with the blood and as they slay the livestock and eat them with the blood because they're starving and and we we know why they're doing this right because Saul said don't eat and his irrational in his Fe wanting to be in control and wanting to to avenge himself he opposes something on the people that only causes them to when they finally win to do something that transgresses and in 1st Samuel 14:33 Saul said behold the people sin against the Lord in that they eat with the blood and he said you have transgressed roll a great Stone unto me this day man what a drama King right like this is probably where the term originally came up and they just changed it in time he's so dramatic hey pal you're the one that made him do this nobody eat even his own son is like wow why did he say after he found out like hey why did he say that because we could have eaten this honey in these woods and had so much strength for the battle like what was he thinking it was irrational and instead of him in this moment realizing what have I done I required of the people to these men to not eat and as a result of their faithfulness to my command it thrust them into this position where they were more easily overcome with this hunger to eat this meat raw with the blood and he said and and sin against the Lord and he's like to me the way I read it like oh just kill me look what they've done they've ruined my great Victory he doesn't own it and there's a series of lots cast I'll just skip to verse 43 and after the Lots stay children of Israel the Army they're all absolved but the lots are cast it's just Samuel and Jonathan and Saul says' Jonathan what have you done and Jonathan said I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand and lo I must die Jonathan was an upright man John was willing to accept the punishment of the king's irrational demand he had to be a good man for his heart to be so joined together with David's all I did was taste a little bit honey my eyes were opened I was enthused I had Vigor and Saul answers in verse 444 God do so so and more also for Thou shalt surely die Jonathan here is a dad looking at his son a king looking at his best warrior who says you made the command I have to die because I broke it I I I set forth to you that Saul was irrational because of his pride that if he had not had these inner mechanisms of pretense and pride and being accepted and people thinking he's great and being a warrior that's why he offered up uh the the sacrifices because of the people and then here the very next chapter he's worried that he's not going to win this battle so he puts This Record you got to win you got to avenge me let's fight don't eat don't eat I can't lose this battle as king I can't lose this battle and what does he do he trusts more in his ability to guide the people than to say as David did Lord the battle's yours not mine this battle belongs to you Lord I it looks like the sun's going to go down and we're not going to win and this might look really bad for as me as a king Lord what can you do for me this today it's because of his pride that he makes this IR rational vow or demand upon the people and I just asked the question is it this moment where Saul wakes up even if you didn't know the story you would know at this point probably not his own son has submitted to be uh killed for Disobedience and surely In This Moment Saul would be like oh what have I done what have I done me instead yeah let a stone Roll On Me Not because I've Done Right and and we've and I this is but I because I'm wrong and notice in verse 45 and the people said unto Saul shall Jonathan die who's wrought this great Victory this great salvation in Israel God forbid as the Lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath rot with God this day so the people rescued Jonathan that he died not is it any surprise that the people saved Jonathan and not Saul is it any surprise that Saul goes back on his own command because of the pressure of the people Saul was always desperately trying to prove himself he's always trying to gain approval he always wanted to be accepted he he was always looking outside of himself am I good am I right is this okay is this do you like this is this all right am I doing good am I a good King is everything okay he wasn't resting in who he was and what God said about him the very next chapter 15 God demands he says this utterly destroy all all they have and spare them not about the malachit if you read the story 1st Samuel 15 he spares AAG and it says the best of sheep the best of oxen best of fatlings best of lambs in all that was good and destroyed everything that was vile and refused I'd like to call this presumptive religion that here Saul is able to concoct a church Charter that Embraces Christ and salvation constructs a fellowship and a tabernacle that lifts up up the message of the hour and all that is good and destroys everything that is evil but at the end of the day is nothing but self-justification kept all that was good and refused all that was vile and that was prohibited under the law kept everything that they could use according to the law but in verse 13 Samuel came to Saul and said unto him this is s Saul says this is Saul blessed be thou of the Lord I have performed form formed the Commandment of the Lord I haven't rejected the word I haven't rejected the message I'm a message believer I'm this I'm that I have performed the Commandment of the Lord I wasn't going to put these both on one slide so you could compare but just let that be uh ingrained like just seared into your mind I have performed the Commandment of the Lord verse three let's just look at the Commandment of the Lord utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass in other words you could not spare the king or the best of the sheep or the best of The Oxen or the best of the fatlings of the Lambs and all that's good and just destroy all that's vile and refused and still be able to claim I've commit I've kept the word and Saul then says well they brought them the people spared as I close this service I want you to realize that Paul's Saul's pride of life blinded him to the word of God he becomes so obstinate when corrected that here he says I commanded the word of the Lord there's no humility it's always arrogance he gets angry because he's driven to be proven right he cannot be humbled he cannot repent and because of it he's prone to jealousy when others do even when Saul recognizes in David he says David you're a better man than me did this did the switch flip permanently then no it never changed he could have moments where everything's good but he's ultimately overcome by these things because the failure he has the wrong heart the you to Humble or repent he says I have kept the Commandment of the Lord the Commandment of the Lord was to spare nothing destroy them all verse 17 and when thou was little in thy own sight Samuel now is rebuking Saul follow this I'm going to read all the way to verse 30 ver 31 and when thou was little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord anointed Thee the king of over Israel when you thought less of yourself even in your complex and insecurities when when that you were that's when I made you this so there something about I made you when you were that way and I knew you were that way I made you King why couldn't you just keep trusting me and the Lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the Sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed why did you then not obey the voice of the Lord but did fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the Lord and Saul said unto Samuel yay I have obeyed the voice of the Lord the only way I can relate to this is being if I was like maybe a math tutor or something like like you're not serious are you it it's so obvious but yet Saul and is Saul just trolling the prophet at this point well I obeyed right no he he's in his mind he's like I have obeyed he can't humble himself he can't repent I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and somehow in his mind he can interpret it where there's a conflict his interpretation is going to govern and a brought aan the king of amalec and have utterly destroyed the amalekites see what I did There I destroyed the amalekites and I only kept the king of AMC AMC see right I've have obeyed but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in gilgal and and this religious justification presumptive religion this presuming he's the king should have rested with him and then Samuel says in verse 22 hath the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to B is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry Lord will when I get back I want to start on when young ones don't grow up and and not growing up it's rooted in rebellion and stubbornness because thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord Heath also rejected thee from being King Saul would never admit to be a word rejector if anything he would have claimed to have kept it perfectly despite the apparent contradictions and conflict and Saul said unto Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord in thy words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice now we feel like we're getting somewhere I have sinned this is good for Saul right I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord Saul is now owning it and thy words like so he's the big three he's repented of all three I've sinned transgressed and thy words I I've done the Commandment th words like I want to be sure I'm making this right and then all of a sudden the justification kicks in the I'm not really wrong I was wrong but this is why I was wrong and once you know why I was wrong he's like I'm guilty of homicide but it's justifiable homicide right I I have a good reason because I feared the Lord and obeyed their voice again right back to the people it's been I've been well over an hour now I acknowledge the length of this and then verse 25 you have to catch this part otherwise you're going to miss it that seems to be good but now he starts judging immediately he says now therefore I pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord immediately forgive me come with me and offer sacrifice with me immediately now therefore I pray thee pardon my sin you'll notice how God deals with David later and he allows with with basba and how that just kind of lets nine months go by and he lets this thing just drag on and drag on you realize this is how God wants to deal with a man's heart and this is the attitude of someone it's like okay fine all right on that remind you of a teenager I don't know where I got it okay fine okay I don't want to know why I was wrong I don't want to live under this punishment anymore let's just move on okay change the subject adults do it quite a bit too what is Aaron well you know the kids are given to Mischief turn with me in worship and then Samuel said unto Saul I will not return with thee for thou has rejected the word of the Lord and the Lord hath rejected thee from being King over Israel again you are rejecting the word you have rejected the word wherein did Saul reject the word I I would like for you to think of it this way pray about this was it not because he transgressed the Commandment but because of his willful obstinance to not just humble himself and repent was the transgression in the spirit of it in the willfulness of it and the his willful blindness and it being rooted in Pride he's rejected thee and as Samuel turned about to go away Saul fell on his face and be to rent his garments and say God I'm a sinner I'm worthless I'm horrible Lord don't take the throne away from Jonathan he deserves it he's a better man than me no M sorry I don't know what Bible you're reading he laid a hold upon the skirt of Samuel's mantle and rips it I don't have time to get into what a a front and a disrespect to the messenger this was and Samuel said unto him the king the Lord hath rent the Kingdom of Israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than thou that's the that's that that gift that's what that is that is that is the worst thing could have said to him you I've given it to your neighbor that's better than you the kingdom is going to get ripped out of your hands and given to a man that's better than you you're you're not as good as this guy you're not as good as your neighbor and also the strength of Israel will not lie nor repent there it is for he is not a man that he should repent God will not lie God does not need to repent he is the strength of Israel but Samuel or Saul this is what you should have been doing you shouldn't have been lying you should have been repenting now that that had to get Saul right immediately that punches Saul deeply in his soul his attitude's going to change right right right we know it he's going to do it now he's going to do it sack cloth and Ashes GNA humble himself then he said I have sinned yet honor me now Look at look at this pride of life this pop look at in front of all the people you have to catch this in this I've sinned yet honor me now I pray thee before the Elders of my people and before Israel don't walk away from me Samuel don't let the people know I've rejected the Lord can we just continue on for pretense sake I'm going to lose the kingdom everything's going to change I get it but he's not willing to repent there's the inability in this moment to recognize yes how hard how his heart had become so lifted up he says okay I've sin honor me now and stand by my side before the people before all Israel and turn again with me go with me that I may Worship the Lord thy God and you Saul Samuel turned again after Saul and Saul worshiped the Lord because at the end of the day he wasn't really wor worried about truly worshiping the Lord in spirit and in truth he just wanted the prophet the message to be close to him he he wanted to look like we're in this we're message we're in this together I know maybe coming across is a little hard about this but you got to realize just how subtle these Kingdom Builders are where they can even I'll just be so blunt as to say they can even have the same name as brother brandom but it's become an idol to get people out of the perfect will of God I've sin put honor me now let all the elders see in that I'm still with the prophet let all the Israel see that you're going with me to Worship the Lord so that in their eyes I'm not rejected so that in their eyes I'm still right so that in their eyes I'm not wrong and Samuel still goes with them and they Worship the Lord Saul is never healed of his eye disease Saul is never healed did I say Samuel Saul is never healed of his eye disease his heart is never changed to just trust God his heart was never changed just to abandon himself to the consequence and say I've sinned take it away from me now whoever this neighbor is let him have the kingdom you'll find that there's people that will sin against God sin against the people men that'll that'll that'll transgress the word of God and still cling to privilege and cling to rights never trying to atone never trying to make anything right and it's this pride of life we'll invite the musicians to come or just the couple that are playing since Rebecca and whoever's playing the pride of life and this Lust For popularity it drives Saul ultimately we see that it's it promotes this jealousy in this murder but John don't show this scripture just yet but I just want to read this this scripture it says this is later in the story of um the story of Saul and Saul was very wroth no surprise and the samean displeased him it's a few chapters later something's making Saul angry again he's mad what could it be what saying could make Saul so angry and so upset it says in 1st Samuel 18:8 Saul was very angry very wroth and the same displeased him brother John if you want to put it up there if I gave it and he said they have ascribed unto David 10 thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands maybe if he was still little in his own eyes and he just kind of embraced the calling and trust in the Lord he would have said I got my thousand nope and then his conclusion in what can he have more but the king om notice how quickly he begins to think about oh everyone's happy with what David did everyone's enjoying David Everyone likes David David's slain his 10 thousands Saul his thousands and what's next but him to want to take my job what's next but for him to want to take the kingdom and it says and Saul eyed David from that day forward he eyem competition comparison jealousy jealousy is an inability to rejoice when others are blessed so you might think well I'm not jealous but you'll refrain praise or you won't give a compliment you won't acknowledge it somebody shows you their nice engagement ring you're like nice setting right did you hear I was engaged to what right I'm not jealous but you're going to get congratulations from me you can't rejoice when other people are used by God becomes a competition it's the gains of Kora it is the pride of life it's the sin of popularity I think enough has been said on this subject but let me just close it by saying the big three will use sin the World the Flesh the devil to dilute us to deceive us to distract us and ultimately it's trying to destroy us say Lord I want my eyes to be open opened to how these work on me as an individual how they work within our families and how they become problems in the church how they can become problematic within the the larger community of the message of the hour if you see somebody that you feel or some something you see you recognize certain things going on out there in the world today or amongst certain people whether it be false prophecies or false movements whatever it might be then you know where it's coming from I said God have mercy on these people God have mercy on that Minister God uh uh keep me uh put me in a place Lord where I I can stay clean put I let the blood cover me in these things as brother bam said and Lord help those that may be getting distracted pulled aside by these things because it's a it's in these three things all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life money women and popularity it's in everything that would deceive us distract us or try to destroy us may God give us Grace and his blood cover us and keep us covered up so that we can be Victorious and our hearts not be lifted up unto our destruction if you could stand with me
