TRANSCRIPT
========================================
John chapter 6 verse 30- 42. I um I realize this may be a little lengthy and I'm was wanting to cover a lot more in this particular um John chapter 6 30-42. Let me get out of John chapter 10. It's like wait this isn't even adding up. John chapter 6 verse 30 it says and they said therefore unto him what sign showest thou then that we may see and believe thee what dost thou work our fathers did eat mana in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, that ye also have seen me, and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that everyone which seeth the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day." The Jews then murmured at him because he said, "I am the bread which came came down from heaven." And they said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that he saith,"I am come down from heaven?" Amen. You can be seated. My title may strike you as a little bit odd, especially if you've never heard this phrase before, but I'm calling it the magnum opus. As we've been on the subject of art lately on music, as of late all year, we've been kind of using that uh analogy of art, God being the ultimate artist. over the last several services been using music uh as a template for examining certain truths in the Bible. And so this may be a familiar phrase to some of you. The magnum opus. I'm calling it the magnum opus. Wednesday night we ministered on the key. I just want to take a few moments to go back over some of these subjects on the key. Christ is the key. Never forget that. Christ is the key. He is the way out of darkness. He is the truth exposing error. He is the life that overcomes death. That's the key, the way, the truth, the life. And Christ uh is the only there's only one key. &gt;&gt; So what's the key? How can we figure this out? What's the key? Jesus Christ. And we should never forget that in everything that we experience and everything that we go through, Jesus Christ is the only key. Maybe a lot of things that we appreciate, a lot of things we love, we say, "Well, church is the key. Church is the key." Well, it's important. It's part of it. But what would church be without Jesus Christ? What would church become if we focused on something other than Jesus Christ? And a lot of you can imagine what that's like because you've experienced it, but you Jesus Christ is the key, but you can only grasp him by faith. And so we looked at it from the standpoint that faith is the hand holding the key. You can all acknowledge the key. There's the key. There's the book. It's sealed. It can't read it. And how can we read it? And what can we do? And we can all acknowledge truth even by reading factual things. But what does it take to really grasp it and to have it and to hold it? It takes faith to do that. So faith is the hand to hold the key. It's the only hand that can hold Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Uh it cannot be historical record. It can't be, you know, transcripts found in in uh clay pots in in Syria. It's got to be something real that you find by faith and believe. And a key, as we could just kind of surface it this way, key is something that's crucially important. And so if that's the it's the key to this. It's crucially important. And that way we could say church is but Christ is the key. And we could say a key is something that's important. Musically it's that tone or note. So you could say in music a key is a tone or a note. And then just combining those things together, the keyynote. You've heard that phrase before, the keynote. It's that leading idea, that central principle. And Jesus Christ is that leading idea, that central principle or the principal theme in the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; That's what it that's what the Old Testament is prophesying of. That's what the New Testament is foreshadowing is Jesus Christ in you, the hope of glory. And so if Christ is the principal theme of the Bible, he should be the key to our lives. He should be the keynote. He should be that principle in our life. and faith says we're going to look be looking really specifically at faith. I felt led after Wednesday night just to continue along this pathway. The sermon today I believe would have fit perfectly maybe on that last service of the year when you have been preaching on art all year long then it's the magnum opus right you reach that great climactic ending I just feel that now's the moment but faith is the keynote to scripture uh because without it you cannot you cannot know Jesus Christ or God because the Bible teaches us he's known by faith and that's very easy to say but if anyone here has ever wrestled with faith it can be the the the inverse So that is scary &gt;&gt; cuz you're like, "Well, I thought I knew what maybe I don't know." And there can be a lot of external things in our flesh, the mind and body war, and they fight because it's like, "Well, what is faith?" Because you're so used to seeing things and touching things and and you want to be able to go by something very very real and and uh uh tangible, but yet this faith is elusive. Because what faith itself is a sense, and we try to figure out, we try to contact that faith through these other senses. We want to at least. Wouldn't it be great if you could just strangle faith and just be like, I got my hands around its neck and I see it and I'm going to look it in its eye and say, "You're mine." &gt;&gt; But we're not able to do that. &gt;&gt; But yet, it's still this keynote. In Ephesians 2:8, it says, "For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves." And we could say, "The grace isn't of yourself, nor is the faith. It is the gift of God." Amen. &gt;&gt; So the salvation of grace is received by faith. This is the faith of Christ. Not just in Christ. This is faith in Christ. But then also the faith of Christ. By grace. You are saved through faith. So you can say how were you saved? By grace. How were you a recipient? How did you grasp that salvation? By grace. Through faith. &gt;&gt; Galatians chapter 3:22. The scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by the faith of Jesus Christ. So then all are under sin that it is not of ourselves that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ. How is the promise apprehended? How do we receive it? By the faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. &gt;&gt; So there's this other element. It's by the faith of Jesus Christ and it's given to them not them that are ambivalent. Sometimes this is where we begin to wrestle well if it's election if it's faith if it's of God then what part do I play except perhaps just going numb and and mindblank and then something happening but I believe there is a conscious even an intellectual component where you have to accept Christ and make a decision even if it's in your mind against everything else that's fighting and waring you well how do you know how do you know that in your mind you just say I I'm making my choice I'm making my decision So there's faith of Jesus Christ that allows us to partake in these promises. So it's a faith that's only by Jesus Christ. In Philippians chapter 3:9, he says, "And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness." This is where we see that we're all under sin and it's not of ourselves. So it's not our own righteousness which is of the law which believe it or not a lot of us have produced by being really good church kids raised in a good home raised believe in the Bible believe in the message and we do as best as we can but that would be our own righteousness but the righteousness that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith. So this faith is the faith that Jesus Christ has given the believer again not just in him but of him the faith of Christ so that it produces the righteousness which is of God and again the writer saying by faith so there's a there's this uh undergirling this theme fa faith faith faith that's what that's the keyynote to the key that's the that's the the the uh in the Bible I think it's Paul that may say it or James it says the holding In fact, the mystery of the faith in a clean conscience. Maybe it's James. So, there's this mystery to the faith. What's the mystery to the faith? You can't see it, taste it, smell it, hear it. You can't imagine it. &gt;&gt; You can't just love it. &gt;&gt; You can't There there's a there's a certain thing to where faith itself is evidence. Fa faith is something that's just there. It's a theme. &gt;&gt; And so, with that in mind, I'd like to turn to John, if we could together, turn to John chapter 6. I'm going to be reading, Lord willing, verses 22 to 71. So I would like to cover this chapter in somewhat detail. Um there's maybe a lot of different ways we could have walked through this particular principle of the magnum opus and we could have done it uh different ways but God just inspired it to me this way. So it's going to feel like a a teaching through these particular verses. So stay with me. Uh it's going to be a lot of Bible reading. The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea, the day following the miracles of the loaves and fishes, saw that there was none other boat there, save that one wherein to his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone. Could you imagine, you know, if you're saying like you had this, it reads almost as if John had a word limit that he was trying to get to, right? He's just telling us everything. What was the atmospheric pressure that day? you know, and it's like, but this these things are all necessary because he's saying there was no other boat there, but the ones that the disciples took and they knew that Jesus wasn't with the disciples in the boat. And then the next verse kind of tells us, how be it there came other boats from Tiberius n under the place. And so they're saying that there were other boats there, but they knew these boats had come after the fact. So there was all these boats that the disciples leave in. That was the way across the sea, and Jesus didn't go across the sea with them. And now they see these other boats back and Jesus is so they're still there. So Jesus couldn't have left with those and he's deliberate in saying where they did eat bread. This is the miracle after that the Lord had given thanks. So it's wanting you to set the scene. When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there neither his disciples, they also took shipping. This is the earliest uh reference to logistics and UPS and Amazon. They also took shipping and came to Capernaum seeking for Jesus. Now that sounds really good. Sets the scene. He has just performed these miracles. This eye detention sign something that gets your attention. And whatever the reason that they're seeking, as we get into this later, they were at least seeking. They're looking. They're wanting to find Christ. This is a worthy endeavor. Something's provoking them. let us go out and search for this Christ who we believe to be the truth which we know now to be the way and the life. So they're seeking what would be the right thing even if they don't know what it is yet. Deuteronomy 4 29 it says but if it if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. A similar principle is expressed in the book of Jeremiah where if you seek me with your whole heart, you'll find me. So this is a very beautiful principle that those that seek God, he will be found. And the qualifier is if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul. I believe I think that we could read this to say that if you truly have sought God with all your heart and all your soul, you will find him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So then if you are seeking God and you don't find him, the the the the onus doesn't switch to Jesus or God, it's still on you as to whether or not you've sought with all your heart and all your soul. Says in Matthew 7 7 to8, "Ask and it shall be given you. Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you. For everyone that askketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knockketh it shall be opened. These are, this is a promise of Jesus Christ. Let's just take it very literal. If you just heard a man say, "Ask and it shall be given you." And if you wanted to test him whether or not his words are right, you would just ask. &gt;&gt; And if you don't get it, then that man's a liar. &gt;&gt; Because he just said, "Ask. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be open. and everyone that askketh receive it. But here we can see this principle. Then he that seeks will find. He that seeketh findeth. He that knockketh the door is open. This is a promise of Jesus Christ. So as they leave here in John 6 24 uh when they took shipping they're seeking for Jesus. In verse 25 it says, "And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?" In other words, they were astonished that he made it when he did because as the scripture has already told us and John in great detail has said, "Well, these boats left already with the disciples." They knew that Jesus was not on that boat. They knew all the boats that had returned were people coming from the other direction. And so, the only way that Jesus could have got to where he was in their minds, the only way is if he traveled by land all the way around and they're saying, "Whoa, hold on. It's way too early for you to be here. if you traveled by land. So immediately they're just they're questioning how he did it. How did you get here? There's some maybe uh if we could say some uh kind of like when someone says you told me you left at 10:00 and you're here at 10:30. I live an hour away. And there's this implication you were speeding, right? Pred premeditated murder. And that's the way it's going to take an hour for your angel to catch up. Right? There's this questioning of how it happened just because of logistics and then you say, "Oh, didn't you know they opened up that new bypass?" You're like, "Oh, a tiki dobeck, right? Didn't mean to falsely accuse you." But there is some kind of how did you get here? This astonishment and amazement as to how he was able to get there. Now, could have you imagine if he said, "Oh, I walked on water. That's it." Right? You're out of here. That would have been the end. Even though they would have seen the walking on water, but you can see where their attitude is. That would have been probably enough for them. Verse 26, Jesus answered them and said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, you seek me." True. Not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled. We could say that there was a It wasn't the whole heart. &gt;&gt; Was it the whole soul that they were seeking after or was it just the whole tummy? &gt;&gt; Was it their gut? Was it their stomach? I I put have Jesus expose their search history, right? He he he had he had their Google history to know I know what you've been searching. How can I monetize unlimited bread? &gt;&gt; There was something more to the dynamics taking place such that he was saying what is it that you're seeking? What were you coming for? And so very shallow, very surfacy. Didn't get very deep with them. the miracles did not have a a deeper resonance than the fleshly appetites and maybe the things that they were perceiving. He says, "You sought me because of the miracles." And that's true. But if I could say it this way, they sought him only for the miracles. &gt;&gt; In other words, there's maybe not a deeper inquiry there. It's, well, let's just prove if he can keep doing this. Let's see if we can find how he did it. Let's see. I I I this is something in here that if I could come if I could be satisfied with this realm, you know, and this is true, then I I don't mind revisiting this over and over and over again. But the reality was they didn't seek him because of the miracles or he says you saw the miracles, but you sought me only for the miracles because miracles and signs and even these things that demonstrated a supernatural power didn't resonate any further than what it could do for your mind and body. So the main concern and this is very important for you to to think about their main concern was worldly advantage. This and I'm not I'm not wanting us to become experts on the attitude of the Jews back in that in that time period. I want you to recognize right now, even in your own human instinct, there's a way that you wrestle things out with God, with the word, and even with Christ to where there's some part of you that's seeking worldly advantage or is reluctant to let go of what you perceive to be an advantage in the world to follow Christ, &gt;&gt; whether it be the way you look or the things you can do, all sorts of things that are going to be waring within your spirit. And so they sought him or their concern was worldly advantage whether it was social or economic or some political benefit. Could you imagine if at church every time you came to church and I'm not saying it's not true but every time you came to church and you came the right way that there was just all of a sudden $100,000 uh deposited into your Bitcoin wallet. And some of you know right now we know who's been searching with their whole heart. my whole mind. No. If that was true, you wouldn't miss a service &gt;&gt; because you'd immediately recognize this worldly advantage to doing it. &gt;&gt; Where do you live? I live in Chicago. Where do you go to church? Arizona believers church. I get on a plane every Saturday night and I fly p my private jet. I'm there on Sunday mornings because I get one bitcoin every time I'm there. Right? &gt;&gt; And why would you do it? World advantage. Right. &gt;&gt; So, there's something at play here when they begin to look into this and they're seeking it and they're pursuing it and there's there's this journey across the sea likewise to find Jesus and they're seeking Jesus. And immediately Jesus exposes something. So, he says in verse 27, labor not for the meat which perisheth, that would be that bread, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life. We read this without mere without even a stumble or wait what? We don't even go back. But he's saying, "Labor not for the food, the bread, the meat, the sustenance that feeds the flesh, but labor for the meat which endureth and perseveres eternally and causes you to live forever." And when we hear that Pon Deleon or whoever it was uh uh you know sailed to Flida and and tried to find the fountain of youth, we find out when he gets there and there we're thinking that guy's insane. There is no such thing as a fountain of youth. But Jesus prophesies of one. And he says, "Which the son of man shall give unto you." Now, there's only one source, the son of man. Talk about a hard pill to swallow. For him hath God the father sealed. And this has something to do with God identifying himself. I believe in John 3 that identifying God seals him. So the real challenge is to their motives. You say, "Well, that's a good thing, but what's your motive and what's your objective?" It's kind of digging into probing what their state of mind was when they were seeking. What were they trying to find? Were they just trying to find food? Were they trying to find uh uh you know vindication? Were what were they what were they looking for? I I I'm just maybe trying to think of it in a broader way so you can begin to think of how Jesus challenged it. Don't labor for natural things and carnal things and things that are just facts or things that are just fiction or things that'll just perish or come and go. What are you truly seeking? And so in verse 28, then said they unto him, and this to me is such a um I I'm reading it differently than I ever have before. I'll say that this is on me. Then said they unto him, "What shall we do that we might work the works of God?" Now, it's not till late as of late that I and when I say as of late, I don't mean this morning, but last week that this scripture finally clicked that when they said, "What what shall we do that we might work?" That it is in some ways responsive, if not directly responsive to him saying, "Labor, &gt;&gt; labor for meat from heaven. Labor for the meat that the son of man will give you." So they ask what shall we do that we might work the works of God that erosomi let what may we work which is to do to perform to cause to exist to produce what shall we work to uh produce the arggon to work the works the arrog to the arggon those are just the uh the Greek words and that's anything accomplished by hand or art or industry or mind what can we do to work the works Or if we could say what can we do to to to to produce that product of God and it does it seem to me it seems responsive to Christ's instruction to labor for meat but even in this question there's something missing because they are overtly seeking approval of God. What can we do to work the works of God? Notice how quickly it's almost as if they bypass the son of man. And this is how clever the devil is. You could say, "Well, uh, this is the truth. This is the truth." And then they just want to slip right past the truth and say, "Well, I just want to know God in a personal way." As if to say that truth doesn't matter anymore. So, this is just how slick the devil is. He almost bypasses Christ, the son of man. And so, they're not truly seeking the son of man to receive what he gives. They're putting themselves on the same level as the son of man because they've seen these wonderful works that Christ has done. And now they say, "Well, what can we do to work the works of God? Cuz I I if you're laboring for the Father, let me equally and likewise labor for the Father and let me do the works that pleases him since you claim you're doing the pleasing." And there's no submission to the Son of Man that had the bread that they that he says they should be fighting for. Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Verse 29. Jesus answered and said unto them, "This is the work of God." If you're taking notes, now's the time to do it. If you're not taking notes, probably now is not a good time to start. But it's a good practice. This is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent. This is the arggon. Anything accomplished by God's hand, by God's art or industry or God's mind, this is the product of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let me say this is the work that pleases God. &gt;&gt; To believe on him that God sends. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we could say ultimately primarily most importantly Christ. &gt;&gt; So in Hebrews 11:6, but without faith it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is. So here's that seeking the searching. Faith is necessary to please God. And in this searching, he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. There's the qualification of the seeking. There's the qualification. You know whenever you you all every single one of you uh use this chat GPT there's a maybe drop down menu and you can choose quick answer all of you use the quick right you want it fast I want to be on engine five I want to get it fast I want to know the answer right away none of you are using the deeper or whatever else it is you use maybe if you're using co-pilot which is all what the cool people use and you're not saying I'll wait 30 minutes to find out an answer right because none of us want to really be that diligent But he's saying that diligently seek him. It takes faith to do this. It takes that diligent searching in your heart. Now, I want to emphasize this. I'm not changing meaning. I'm not trying to turn this around, but let's read it exactly the way he said it. This is the work of God. The work of God is you believe on the one he sends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is God's product &gt;&gt; when you believe &gt;&gt; on Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you catch that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not saying it in the sense that you what can we do to work the works of Christ? And so now I'm going to work something for Christ and that's going to be a work that pleases God. but rather the work of God is if you want to see the work of God in your life is when you believe on him that he has sent. &gt;&gt; That's God working in your life. &gt;&gt; I know we want to see it in a lot of other ways, but so help me. I I want to see God working to where I can I can invest a early on the early stages in a a meme coin right at the outset and I become one of the future wells. That's going to be that's God working in my life is when I get ahead of the system and I make the right call on Tesla stock that's going to be the real miracle. No, the miracle of God is not the house and not the all these other things. The miracle of God is when I can just simply believe &gt;&gt; his word. &gt;&gt; This is the magnum opus. &gt;&gt; A magnum opus in art is a great or important work. The magnum opus is the greatest achievement of an artist. Some could argue this with respect to different ones. Say, well, Beethoven's ninth, that's his magnum opus. And some say, well, Van Go uh Van Go's starry night, that's the that's his magnum opus. And we identify it with something that is their greatest accomplishment, something that would be that single most identifiable work that they have produced. And I'm saying to you today, the work of God is when you believe. &gt;&gt; And that's the magnum opus. Now, when he says the work of God is that you believe on him who he has sent, I would think that on some level they have thought, okay, you've come from the father. You want us to believe in you. And so they said unto him, therefore, what sign showest thou then? This is verse verse 30. What sign showest thou then? that we may see and believe thee. So now, who who is the the who's the onus being put back on? Once again, it's on Christ. &gt;&gt; You prove to me. You show me. Do do something more to convince me to believe. And he says, and then our fathers did eat mana in the desert. As it is written, he gave them bread from heaven to eat. So, they're still wanting something now in the moment, visible, provable, carnal, tangible, however you want to look at it, but they're wanting something more. And think of this. Why were they there? Why did they travel across the ocean or excuse me, not the ocean? Surprise. They were in Pasadena. No, they um Why did they travel across the sea to see this to see him? To seek him the miracles. &gt;&gt; That's why they were around to begin with. They had already seen signs and miracles, but now what are they doing in retrospect? They're making light of them cuz now they're saying, "Well, what's a bunch of loaves and fishes, right? Moses gave us bread from heaven." And no doubt they could have said, "And he gave us quail." And I've never been much of a pescatarian anyways. I preferred the quail. So, there's already going back and trying to qualify and making light of what Jesus said because it's like, well, what more can you do? Because now that we're looking at it and we're going back and combing through these things and you're kind of starting to challenge us a little bit. We're getting uncomfortable. So, now we kind of want to downplay why we're here to begin with is what more can you do than Moses? In Matthew 12:es 38-39, then certain of the scribes and the Pharisees answered saying, "Master, we would see a sign from thee." It's in our family. We've been discussing as of late the uh certain um strategies and arguments and fallacies and and one that is come up quite a bit is well, you can't prove me wrong. And it's like, well, game over, I guess. Uh but here they're saying, you know, show us a sign from thee. But he answered and said unto them, an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign. &gt;&gt; An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign. Now that's that's hard language, especially when he's saying he's he's using them as this litmus test for the whole generation. Evil and adulterous, faithless, &gt;&gt; unfaithful, &gt;&gt; evil and adulterous generation, they seeketh after a sign. So let's go back to the idea of seeking. They were seeking after Jesus. No, they weren't seeking after Jesus. They were seeking for something ancillary. They were seeking something beyond Jesus because they find him. And now they start having all these qualifications. They have all these other things that start coming into the picture to cloud their view. And so he's saying, "No, you seek after a sign. You're not truly seeking the heart of God, the mind of God and truth, or to get to the bottom of the truth of what's being said. You want a sign. And he says, and he gives them the sign. There shall be no sign given to thee, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. We could say then they're not actually seeking God, but some proof or verification. That something is of God. &gt;&gt; Seeking with their mind, not the heart. Maybe seeking on some level. and they're kind of hung up in the si sign part aspect of it. &gt;&gt; Our fathers ate. Show us a sign just like those Pharisees and scribes. So verse 32, then Jesus said unto them, verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven. Stop. Wait a minute. Hold on. Did he or did he not? Sounds like Jesus is now saying that Moses was wrong or that they're that they're lying and that maybe it wasn't bread from heaven. But we know the Bible said bread from heaven, but Jesus saying, "No, he gave you not that bread from heaven." He's wanting them to focus now. Yeah, I may have multiplied bread in an act of creation or multiplication. And this was supernatural. And yes, Moses gave you bread from heaven, but I'm not talking about that bread. &gt;&gt; It's kind of what he chided the his disciples for. Beware of the leavenven of the scribes and Pharisees. And all of a sudden, they looked at the Roman meal loaf, right? &gt;&gt; Like the leavenven of Herod. You bought the wrong bread. You're supposed to buy Davey's Crazy Bread or whatever it's called, right? I need at least 12 seeds in this. I'm not going to eat that stuff. Do you not do you not know that gluten's of the devil? Right? You know, I didn't know. Was it grass-fed corn? I don't know. So, there's a but he's chiding them once again for how shallow their understanding was. He says, "But my father giveth you the true bread from heaven." What did he already tell us? The son of man will give it to you. But now he's saying it's the father that gives it. But still, there's only one way to receive it, through the Son of Man. But my father giveth you the true bread from heaven, the true bread, not just bread from heaven. For the bread of God, which he is, he which cometh down from heaven, &gt;&gt; and giveth life unto the world. Why does he make it so hard? Jesus Christ, why do you make it so hard? Why do you have to say it this way? Why don't you just take more time and kind of explain this? Give him the full story and the background. Why does it have to seem so in your face? Then said they unto him,"Lord, evermore, give us this bread." This is their response. And in the trajectory of things, if we didn't know better, we might be thinking, well, this seems to be unfolding well. These back and forth, the questionings, the answers, the seeking, it's all unfolding good. And so now there's this moment where it's like, that's what I want. I want this bread. I'm sincere. It's this moment where I'm wanting it and I'm willing. My heart is open. Give me this bread. But there is still an element missing in John chapter 4 when we see the woman at the well and Jesus begins to talk to her and contact her spirit and tell her things about her that other people didn't know or that he or he wasn't supposed to know. So almost like he's a diver or something. He's reading her mind and he's going to be sharing these things with her. But before he gets there and her heart turns and she says, "I perceive you're a prophet." And she runs into the city saying, "Come see a man who's told me everything I was." Before that, in verse 14, Jesus says, "But whatso whosoever drinkkeeth of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst." So now he has a water that's not the natural water. &gt;&gt; You came to draw from a natural well to get natural water from natural things. I have a water which is not natural. It's supernatural. &gt;&gt; So she knows in that way. She should know. But the water that I shall give you shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Notice the symmetry to the bread which tends to everlasting life. And now the water which tends to everlasting life. and the symmetry of her response. The woman saith to him, "Sir, give me this water that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw." But yet we know according to scripture, her perspective was still carnal. Just as those in John chapter 6, yes, give me this water. I want that water. I want that bread. Well, do you know what you're asking for? I &gt;&gt; mean, how many times have we had that happen? You know, how hot do you want that? Well, what's the scale? 1 to 10. Well, I'll take a 12 then. Do you know what you're asking for? Yeah, I've had a hot pepper before. Right. And and it's like there's a there's a certain measure of are you really serious about this? &gt;&gt; So, they were either serious about literal bread or maybe derisive because they didn't believe that kind of bread existed. Even the woman at the well, it says, "Well, give me this water that I never thirst again." Is it this, you know, give us, Lord, give us this bread? Either they believed it in a literal sense or they're kind of like, yeah, give it, give us this bread from heaven, rabbi. And whatever the reason, it was born from ignorance of what he said. They're not understanding what he said. Would you agree? &gt;&gt; They're not understanding what he said. And there was some sensuality for what he was providing, some taste, some appetite for what he could give them naturally or maybe even vain desire, that vanity, the pride, whatever it is that's motivating them. We could come back and we're maybe backing into this, but it's not whole heart. It's not whole mind. It's not sincere seeking Jesus Christ. There's a lot of other things that are coming into the picture. Oh, give us this bread. And it's it has a a tone of they don't understand or they're asking for other reasons or that still that idea of worldly advantage. So Jesus says in verse 35, I am the bread of life. How come they don't say, "Lord, you are that bread?" How come they're not saying that we believe you or that? How come they're not resonating back and echoing what he said? Remember that they still profess that they want it, but they're not even able to tell him what it is they want. &gt;&gt; They're not even able to mirror what he's offering. &gt;&gt; It's almost as if he's saying, "I give you bread." And they're saying, "Lord, give us the stone. &gt;&gt; It's not that what they're responding with isn't matching." So he says, "I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall never hunger." &gt;&gt; What does the Bible tell us? They didn't want to go to him. &gt;&gt; They wanted the bread. They wanted they they they were seeking something, but they don't want to go through God's provided way to get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, they can still be on they can still be on the lookout for it, right? I'm going to visit a new restaurant that's supposed to have really good hamburgers because I'm looking for the best burger in the valley. And you don't take my word for it where it is. You're curious now, aren't you? So, there's a way though where you just don't want to take it from the experts. You don't want to just take it from the source. You don't want to take it for the one that's telling you about the bread. You don't You want to bypass it. Uh, I'll save that for later. He that cometh to me shall never hunger. He that believeth on me shall never thirst. &gt;&gt; This is this is the truth. &gt;&gt; If you want to have that bread, you got to believe on him. If you want to have that water, you got to believe on him. Verse 36, but I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not. &gt;&gt; They had already seen it. &gt;&gt; The thing that they're asking for, they had already seen. &gt;&gt; The thing that they're desiring was already made manifest. Sir, give me this water. Lord, evermore, give me this bread. Show us the sign. And he's saying, you've already seen me, but you do not believe. They had heard with their ears. They had seen with their eyes the key, the masterpiece, the perfect son of God. &gt;&gt; But the magnum opus was not rotten them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They had seen the key and the masterpiece, but there was not they it did not echo back with a master stroke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's the key, but nothing was resonating back to say that fits the hole in my heart. that unlocks my desire, that satisfies what's missing. He says, you you see, but you don't believe. In Proverbsap 14:6, a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not. Really, really, really lean in on this. Think about this. The scorner seeks wisdom, seeks truth, seek seeks God, seeks after Christ, but never finds it. But knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth. You know what the scorner is in the scripture? It's a critic. &gt;&gt; The one that's characterized by mockery. They're flawinders. We're looking at the flaw paradox. They're the ones that are fixating on on um uh things that don't make sense. They're they're they're not truly seeking. That's a real litmus test for anything that you're feeding on. What's this nature behind it? Skepticism. fear, hatred, bitterness, animosity. I maybe I should take my own advice. When I'm searching for something and looking for a product to buy, I only read the one-star reviews. Maybe I'm learning something today cuz I kind of want to know what does everybody hate about it, you know, what's the problem, you know, cuz all the five star reviews are in Chinese. So, I I want to find out, you know, what are the one stars having to say about it? And and that way I could find if I read a bunch of fivestar reviews and they're just ranting about the fact that they closed five minutes before closing time, then I know they probably have good food. This guy's just upset because he picked the wrong place to eat, right? Or this guy just kind of always has a bone to pick. You know, something along those lines. I don't know. I'm just saying that's not relevant. Read the reviews. You see a Yelp restaurant that's got 40,000 reviews and all 40,000 are five stars. It might be because of the draft beer in the porch, right? and you show up and it's nothing but a honky tonk asking for your ID when you walk in. A lot of times there's reasons why it is that way and it's not always what the reviews you think they are. So, I digress. I'm back to what I was saying that when you find somebody that's a scorner, they don't know truth because they can never find it and they can't be your source for it. &gt;&gt; They can only be your source for scorn, mockery, negativity, derision, &gt;&gt; animosity, bitterness. They can only point you out to the things that hurt, but never to the things that heal &gt;&gt; because they're a scorner. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 15:14, "The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge." Think of just how rich this is. But the mouth of fools feedth on foolishness. There's a much richer character you can gather than from the scripture here in even John 6. Because what were they doing? the mouth of fools were feeding on foolishness. &gt;&gt; It's foolish questions. There's dishonesty. There's deceit. There's fraud. The rudiments of this world. Someone who has a heart of him that understands actually seeks knowledge. The one here in the scripture actually understand what Christ was saying would begin to seek the son of man would begin to seek that bread and seek that truth. But the mouths of the fool still had a lot of questions. But they were foolish because what appetite did they have? for foolishness, for dishonesty, for lies, deceits, and frauds. A scorner seeks wisdom and cannot find it. The foolish feed on foolishness. So he says, "You did not believe me." So he says in verse 37 now, because you have all these people who witnessed the same miracle the day before and now you have the majority of them do not believe. So he says, "All that the father giveth me shall come to me. And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast him out." He says, "He that cometh to me, the bread of life, shall never thirst or hunger. He that believeth shall never thirst or hunger." So now he's saying, "All that the father hath given me will come. For I am come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the father's will which hath sent me, that all of which he hath given me, I should lose nothing." So he won't lose any that are his &gt;&gt; but should raise it up again at the last day. &gt;&gt; No doubt there's, you know, some layers there to the ones he's speaking to. And this is the will of him that sent me. Remember, this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent. This is the will of the father. This is the will of God that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day. This is the will of God. This is the purpose of God that you see the son and believe and become heir to everlasting life and heir to a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Seeing Christ in believing on him, this is God's will. &gt;&gt; The magnum opus we see in John chapter 6 is this is the masterpiece of God. This is his master stroke. This is the keynote. This is the work of God. When you believe on the one that he sent, he sends his son. You see the sun and what do you do? You radiate back in faith. You believe. You resonate in the same intensity and the same wavelength. You wave. You You radiate back. &gt;&gt; But Frankie, I'm wishing I could remember that that measurement right now. That's mega. That's it. I'm resonating back to him. &gt;&gt; That's the magnumopus of God. &gt;&gt; When we see and believe, &gt;&gt; this is the will of God. In 2 Corinthians chapter 5:7, for we walk by faith, not by sight. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says before whatsoever is not of faith is sin. &gt;&gt; We are occupied, directed by, guided by faith. That assurance, that belief, that persuasion. It is a different sense. We walk by faith, not by sight. What is sight here? It's not the physical vision, but rather the superficial appearance of present things. In other words, how we perceive things, what seems apparent. On its face, it looks as if Jesus is belittling the works of Moses. On its face, it seems as if Jesus is doing this. On its face, he said, "We don't go by sight." God's faith is God's faith is greater &gt;&gt; than this reality based solely on human perception. Would not someone being sick, being anointed with oil, being prayed for, believing for their healing, would not them being sick on its face testify that God's a liar when he says, "Lay hands on the sick and they shall recover." You've never thought of that before. Did I just make a mistake? Everyone runs for the door at the same time. You all get stuck like at a cartoon, right? And the last person's just behind you trying to push you all out. This is this is this is the reality of the scripture. &gt;&gt; But we don't base our belief on what seems apparent. &gt;&gt; This faith we don't this faith is different from the subjective and objective uh reality of the world. And I say subjective, it's not what we believe according to our own subjective reality. So say well faith is not what we see what seems apparent to us subjectively. I want to go so far as to say it's not based upon this reality. Uh that's based upon this acceptance or acknowledgement of objective reality. &gt;&gt; You believe God's good and I believe God's good and yo you believe God's good. Okay then that we will accept that God's good. You're going to believe in the goodness of God apart from even your own subjective experience and objective experience. &gt;&gt; That's why some of you believe in what you believe in natural things. Contrary to how many five-star reviews there are, contrary how much brother Aaron touts some hamburger joint or whatever it is, you you just say, "No, my experience tells me otherwise." &gt;&gt; But this faith is not based upon that subjective experience or just this acceptance of an objective reality. Faith is based upon a reality beyond the range of any normal human experiences. &gt;&gt; It's beyond the range of merely physical human experience. I think there's it's two there's two sides to this. There's a dark side and there's a a bright side. That's because it's like faith. Well, faith it's elusive. But that's what faith is. Remember, in order for something to be faith, there has to be something against it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Has to be. That's why here we live by faith. &gt;&gt; In eternity, it's going to be full perfect realization &gt;&gt; of everything we believed. &gt;&gt; So until we get there, when we believe by faith that there's eternal life, death testifies against it. &gt;&gt; If we were all 800,000 years old right now, we could all have a lot of evidence to believe that, hey, you know what? Looking a lot like there's eternal life, right? I've been here for 800,000 years and I'm still single. I have no hopes to get married. But hey, you know what? At least I know that there is eternal life. And it's object. It's subjective experience. But faith believes in something beyond. And what the reason why you still have faith despite everything that's against it is because that's what faith is. &gt;&gt; And in Galatians 3 26, it says, "For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are God's children by faith in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; So I want to I want to share it this way and hopefully I can sprint through what's what's remaining here. That's your magnumopus. &gt;&gt; That that's your magnumopus. What's the greatest thing you could do? Believe. &gt;&gt; What's the only thing he asked you to do? Believe. &gt;&gt; So what's the greatest thing you have? Your faith. Right. &gt;&gt; What's the greatest work in your life? Faith. &gt;&gt; You Well, I I kind of think I'd like to think that Jesus Christ is Brother Aaron. Okay. Can I take away your faith and he still be the greatest gift? I'm not trying to play semantics with what Brother Brandham taught. I'm trying not to try to play semantics with the scripture. This is the work of God that you believe in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you can't even separate J- E Su from F AI T. &gt;&gt; G R A C. You can't do it. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's your magnum opus. &gt;&gt; Listen, whether you believe him or not, Christ is the key. &gt;&gt; Whether you accept him or not, he's the one truth by which everyone will be judged. &gt;&gt; And so when he becomes a part of you by faith, that's your magnum opus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 2:5 says that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men. Men produce their own magnumopus through wisdom, through industry, through art, of the mind. They want to search it out. They want to arrive. They want to discuss. They want to discover. This is man's insatiable desire to be inventors and entrepreneurs. There's something that drives men to accomplish tangible things. They can say, "I'm standing on my own intelligence. I'm standing on my own ability." And it's pride that drives them to attain to things instead of just coming naked to Christ. I got nothing. Here I am. &gt;&gt; You alone have the bread of life. But the Jews refused to do it through pride and arrogance. &gt;&gt; Because they wanted their faith to stand in the wisdom of men. But Paul said, "It's done such that you fa you your faith stands in the power of God." &gt;&gt; Not on the foolishness of carnal things, &gt;&gt; realize just how temporary it is to try to base everything on temporary things, &gt;&gt; carnal things. And then in verse 41 the Jews murmured at him because he said I am the bread which come down from came down from heaven and all that that implies right it's not that they looked at him says if you know if any anybody doesn't look like a loaf of bread it's this guy. So it was everything that he implied by that. So, it's not just that part. There's more to the story. I'm saying that now because I want to come to something to where it's like, yeah, they nitpick on one thing because that that was too hard to accept. But really, you got to take it all in context. And now notice what they immediately say. They weren't asking this question when they sailed across the ocean, were they? And they said, "Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know? How is it that he saith, I came down from heaven?" Oh, now they've got a problem. Now, now they're just a little bit ago, they knew every they knew who his father and mother were. They knew exactly who he was. But yet, they told themselves, "There's something to this. It's worth pursuing. Let's go seek." But then their search history gets exposed. They get uncovered. And now all of a sudden, it's like, "I'm visiting my aunt here. You were in my way. I'm going over here. They rejected faith in Jesus Christ because of their own lusts, &gt;&gt; their own carnality. Now, sure, they'll be intellectually dishonest about it. And they were being dishonest here. John 10 22 to 42. Notice this in a similar vein. It says, "And it was at Jerusalem, the feast of the dedication, and it was winter, and Jesus walked into the temple of Solomon's porch. Then came the Jews round about him and said to him, "How long does thou make us to doubt?" So now it's his fault they doubt, right? Jesus Christ is the swer of doubt. You know, he he did more damage to the Old Testament than he did good. How long does thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. That's how we want it, right? We want God to come down and wake us up in the middle of the night and say, "Aaron, Aaron, take the job. Take the job." Right? We want we want that. But if he did it, you would completely panic and be like, "Oh my goodness, the devil wants me to take the job." And God's like, "Oh, thought that's what you asked for. Never mind. I'll go back to the still small voice." Right? And all a sudden, you just get this still small voice. Take the job. Thank you. Can't believe the devil did that. There's that faith, that still small voice. Tell us plainly. And Jesus answered them, said, "I told you." Right? He's always beating around the bush. He just said, "I told you." And you believed not. &gt;&gt; The works that I do in my father's name, they bear witness of me. But you believe not because you are not of my sheep. &gt;&gt; How that that fails on our DEI qualities here. I mean the initiatives that we have put in place to qualify for inclusion and diversity and there needs to be equity. You cannot have a rigorous admission standard that would keep people out who are goats. That's not fair to the Bradies of this world. You've got to have a standard that just lets us all join. &gt;&gt; He says in verse 27, "My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me." &gt;&gt; Amen. And he begins to talk more about I'll give them eternal life. They'll never perish. No man can pluck them out of my hand. The father is greater than them all. And verse 30, I and my father are one. And then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. &gt;&gt; Notice just how mad it makes them. This is not even rational behavior. At that moment, they decided that their sole purpose in existing and their sole public ministry was to discredit him, to destroy him, and kill him. &gt;&gt; That's the works of Satan. &gt;&gt; When immediately, that's what their purpose is in life. &gt;&gt; Then the Jews took up stones to stone him. Jesus answered, "Many good works have I showed you from my father. For which of those works do you stone me?" &gt;&gt; Wow, what an answer. &gt;&gt; And you don't think the devil's clever? They answered, "For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, because that thou being a man maketh thyself God." Notice the the hypocrisy in that cuz remember how before when they said, "You said that your father was God. How could you do that?" And he turns right around and says, "You're born of fornication." They go, "No, God's our father." And somebody's over there going, "Wait, what? Hold on. It's wrong when he says it. It's right when you say it. &gt;&gt; That doesn't make sense. &gt;&gt; You're a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; That's what they are. It's a hypocrisy of them in this the religious-minded in this instance where they said their God was their father was God, but it's not okay for someone else to say it." especially Christ when he's destroying their religious system and they say, "Well, it's not because the good things you did, but it's because these things you said." So that's their way of disregarding all the good, &gt;&gt; not even having to wrestle with it anymore. &gt;&gt; I don't even need to wrestle with the supernatural in your life because I've been able to find what I think to be blasphemy. &gt;&gt; And that way I can walk away with all my cognitive dissonance and say, "The man deserves to die." and they're being dishonest. &gt;&gt; So he says in verse 59, I'm just going to skip now because we're running out of time. Verse 59, these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum. Now this is of these Jews that murmured. So now we're kind of closing the chapter on the Jews. So now all the Jews that had come around are like, "Dude, this guy is wacko. We're going to take up stones to stone him. We're mad at this guy. We know who this guy is. We know his father and mother. We've we've bird dogged this. We've talked to everybody. We know exactly who he is. Let's leave. Verse 60. Many therefore of his disciples when they had heard him heard this said, "This is a hard saying. Who can bear it? Not everything Jesus says is just easy peasy." &gt;&gt; Again, like I said before, God hasn't made it. I was fellowshipping with a brother here recently and I said, "Do you realize if you were perfect without flaws, you wouldn't need God?" self- sovereign, self-sufficient, &gt;&gt; all powerful, all knowing. &gt;&gt; There'd be no fitting in with God. &gt;&gt; And so, here's the hard saying, if it was all Tell us plainly, and really, how shortsighted would anybody be to think that if he said it plainly, they would believe? &gt;&gt; I got a lot of doubt. You're causing a lot of doubt, buddy, because of these things you said. Now, go ahead and just own up here. Just tell us the truth whether or not you be the Messiah, and we'll believe you. &gt;&gt; Right? It's like, "Oh, I'm the Messiah. Stall him." Right? That there's just a level of dishonesty in the scripture here. But now notice it's not the Jews. It's his disciples saying, "Yeah, this is a hard saying." To this point, they hadn't really expressed much. But now that this the Jews who murmured and now they feel maybe the weight of this conspiracy and maybe as the crowd was dwindling there in Capernaum like this is a hard saying and which is Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it. Hm. Is that mind reading? Sure sounds like divination that would be a Deuteronomy 18 violation. And he said unto them, do this offend you? What? And if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before? This is again an example where Jesus in the moment recognizes his own disciples are uncertain and now they're murmuring themselves. The Jews have murmured. Now his disciples are murmuring. And Jesus says, "You know what? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said it that way. I I that I said that to the Jews just to kind of get some people to fall away. So let me just let me just temper it here. Let me just say God loves goodness and just be good, right? You know, I'm an example of goodness. I'm kind of an allegory for life. just embrace me as an allegory. Follow me, you know, let's not get caught up in all these weird things, but just you get what I'm saying? You feel me? And like they're all like, "Okay, good for a minute there. We thought you were actually kind of trying to say you were the bread of life and you were the only way to eternal life and now you made it a little bit easier. This is more palatable. Could could we not preach this to others because that seems like it'd be more people would be able to embrace it that way." Jesus doesn't do that. He says, "Oh, does that offend you? Oh, you think that was bad? Let me just go ahead and begin to break the mystery open to you. You stuck around this long. Let me go ahead and uh uh let me go ahead and preach the seven seals. &gt;&gt; It is the spirit that quickenth. What What is it to you if you see the son of man ascended up where he was before? It is the spirit that quickenth. The flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life. &gt;&gt; But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him &gt;&gt; to be like Jesus. Right? And he said, "Therefore I said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father, &gt;&gt; the magnumopus." &gt;&gt; From that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him. when he failed to clarify the record. When he failed to back off, when he didn't give in to the need for the carnal and natural things, when it was more let's just stick with signs and wonders and miracles. It's been said that when he went to the word and the word only and he comes back to the spirit which quickens and then called out the fact that just merely following him is an evidence of election and he brought it down to a choice and a decision. From that time, many of his disciples went back and walked nor with him. If I can say this, the miracles were not the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; The faith that was quickened was the magnum opus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bread was not the masterpiece. The teachings were not the masterpiece. The words were not the masterpiece. It was the spirit quickened by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; It was when those words somehow begin to resonate with them and they're kind of like, "Oh my goodness, that's a hard saying, but hey, you know what? Life's hard and oh my goodness, I can't make sense of that. But you know what? This is this is very interesting. Something in my heart is stirring. &gt;&gt; I have an atheistic coworker who's got some really strong arguments scientifically about how horribly wrong this Bible gets a lot of stuff. And there's something in here that's kind of like, yeah, you know what? Why do we even follow the Bible? Oh, isn't it interesting that you're 98% more likely to be a Pentecostal if you're born in this backwood city in Kentucky and just the same if you're born in this little state in India to be a Muslim. And you're like, "Wow, isn't this really interesting that it's all geographical and this seems to be more about genetics and cultural upbringing and social norms than it has to do with God." And you're like, "Maybe I'll move to India." But then something in your heart says, "No, &gt;&gt; I feel like I won the lottery." &gt;&gt; Being born to the family I was born in. I feel like I feel like for me, what a grace because I see a brother Simon who's had to fight through hell, &gt;&gt; to find truth &gt;&gt; and to stand for it. &gt;&gt; And so if that's your explanation, you can't explain that. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; The faith quickened in Ephesians chapter 2:5. When you were dead in sins, hath you hath he quickened, right? hath quickened us together with Christ. And again, by grace you're saved. &gt;&gt; Psalms 119:50, this is my comfort in my affliction. Write it down. This is your comfort in your affliction. What is your comfort in your affliction? For thy word hath quickened me. There's nothing like the word to comfort you when you're going through a hard time. &gt;&gt; I know we might want to numb ourselves with entertainment and it's like, oh my goodness, we're going through difficult times. Let's go to Disneyland or let's go ahead and binge The Sopranos or whatever it might be. And if Vid Angel has it, obviously. And you know what? If it's Vid Angel, it's probably just like 2 minutes. You could binge the whole thing in two minutes. Mafia, bad over. New Jersey, no good. Like, man, we could get through a lot of series with this. And there is a Oh, could you just imagine if there was such a thing that could weed out all the politics and pretense and the posturing and the false doctrine in sermons? Like, every guy's sermon on his website is two seconds. It's like you can you can have your seats. Turn off the filters. It's three hours long. But here's your comfort and your affliction. His word. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like his word to comfort you. That's why the very first thing the devil begins to try to cause separation in is the word. &gt;&gt; He wants to get distance from the word. One of the worst things that can happen to our young people is when the voice of the prophet becomes foreign to them. &gt;&gt; Because that's going to be the one of the first things the devil tries to make strange &gt;&gt; is the voice of God. And I'm not just talking about the tone of brother Brandham, but the message, the Bible, spiritual, scriptural things that are competing with the entertainments and the podcast and all the things that the world has to offer. And all of a sudden, old English and a physical book, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I don't know, man. You want me to read? Therefore, they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with fragments of the five barley loaves of which remained over and above them that had been eaten. And you're like, what in the world are barley loaves? If it's not a a Minecraft loaf, right? If it can't be 8bit, I I don't want to have anything to do with it. It's almost like you have to reframe things in a way that they understand this life is bigger. &gt;&gt; So, it's the word. I really want the word quickens you. It's the word that does it. He's quickened us together with Christ. How? By grace you're saved. It's the word. The word is the spirit that quickenth. Romans 10:17 18. So then faith cometh by hearing &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; This is how the word is meant to bring forth and produce. The word preached is a spirit that quickens and makes a masterpiece in you. Your magnumopus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was the masterpiece in your life? Not that you got healed. Not that you got a job. Not that he fix your marriage. No. The fact that you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then in verse 18 it says, "But have they not heard?" &gt;&gt; Yes, verily their sound went in out all the world, all the earth, and their words under the ends of the world. So have they not heard? Yeah, but they didn't believe the report is what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; They heard, but faith didn't come. That's where you see Hebrews, it didn't profit them because it wasn't mixed with faith. I believe Hebrews 4:2, by grace you're saved. Think of this quickening of faith in Matthew 7 21-23. Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; You remember what the will of God is. This is the will of him that sent me that everyone seeth the son and believeth on him. &gt;&gt; This is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent. &gt;&gt; So it's not everyone that says Lord, Lord, will enter, but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. I think it's important perhaps to consider that he's not just saying that you have only in your life done God's perfect will because wouldn't you think that all of us are out maybe even the birthday girl has she always been able to do God's God's will every day the perfect will of God you can say Lord Lord all you want but what would be the will of God to believe &gt;&gt; to believe on Christ &gt;&gt; but then this is their answer many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in their name, in thy name, but they don't testify that they saw him and believed him, and in thy name cast out devils, but they do not say they saw him and believed him. And in thy name done many wonderful works, but they do not say they saw him and believed him. So, they had a lot of many, they had many works. They did big things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But none of them were seeing and believing, &gt;&gt; then I will profess unto them, I never knew you. you depart from me ye that work iniquity. &gt;&gt; They had a work, but it wasn't the work of God. We say, "Oh, these are the mighty works of God. What can we do to work the works of God?" Lord, Lord, I have this. I have this. I have this. I have this. And it's kind of like, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on. The magnumopus is to believe. &gt;&gt; That's all you needed. You didn't need to go out and try to do all these other things to prove to yourself that you were a Christian, that you believed in God. All you had to do was believe. He says, "Depart from me." because you didn't have the work of God, the will of God, the magnum opus. Titus 1:6, they profess that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable, that's not snowmen, abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. They profess to know God, but all they produce is denial and rebellion. They profess that they know God or that they're seeking Jesus. There could be a lot of ways to phrase this in the context of John chapter 6. But what they do ultimately is they deny him the way, the truth, the life, the one they have already seen, the one that they've already heard, &gt;&gt; abominable and disobedient, and every good work reprobate. What good work can you do but believe? &gt;&gt; Because whatsoever is not of faith is sin. So we say, "Well, brother, there's a lot in this Bible." As a matter of fact, the majority of the New Testament deals with the external things as opposed to the internal things. The waiter things are the internal things. But if you do all the external without the faith, what does all this amounted to? It's &gt;&gt; to be burned. &gt;&gt; Because all this is going to be judged. And if it can't come down to faith, all this was of no value. &gt;&gt; So when Jesus sees that many of his own disciples walk away, he turns to the 12. You talk about this isn't even a church split at this point. This is a this is a um what is it they call it? This is a mandate against his ministry. His critics have spoken and now his most ardent followers have spoken. The ones that he had sent out, the very ones that you thought were with them. And now as they leave and he's left with 12 the day before, you remember the day before? Thousands. But now it's narrowed down to 12. And he turns to the 12 and says, "Will you also go away?" Now he's asking the questions. And Simon Peter answered and said, "Do you do you even need to read it?" You know what he said, don't you? &gt;&gt; You know what he said, "Lord, to whom shall we go?" &gt;&gt; Thou hast the words of eternal life. &gt;&gt; And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the son of the living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's Peter's magnumopus. I know his sermon on the day of Pentecost was pretty amazing, but that was for the church. This is Peter's great moment. &gt;&gt; This is this is like when he said Peter says, "Oh, thou at the Christ, the son of the flesh and blood hath not revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven hath revealed this to you. Thou upon this rock, this work, &gt;&gt; this your magnumopus, Peter, never let it leave you even in your darkest moment. return to this cuz it's going to be the secret to your new birth that I am the Christ, the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; This was his magnumopus, his greatest moment, his crowning achievement. And Jesus answered, and don't get hung up on even those words necessarily in this moment in scripture, but this is what we know about Peter. This is this great moment. To whom should we go? Who else has the words of eternal life? And Jesus answered them and said, "Have I not chosen you? 12 and one of you is a a devil. What a Debbie Downer. Like this is a moment when Peter's saying, "Hey, where are we going to go?" Right guys, who else are we going to go to? Everybody's like, "Yeah, you're right. Who could we go to? Thou alone have It's like what a beautiful moment." He's like, "And one of you is the devil." It's like, but why did he say that? He knew. He spake of Judas a Scariot, the son of Simon, for he it was that should betray him, being one of the 12. That's tough. &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 28:5 says, "Evil men understand not judgment, but they that seek the Lord understandeth all things." A carnal search will never find what is right. But they that truly seek the Lord will understand all things. There'll be a greater unfolding of the word of God, a greater depth and love for Jesus Christ, more of the nature of Christ that begins to express and be exhibited in a person's life. That's what we want to see in one another, right? That's what we want to see in us. That's what should alarm us when we don't see it in someone else. In Philippians chapter 1 6 to11, being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Your magnum opus is his. &gt;&gt; And he'll perform it. &gt;&gt; He'll keep performing it. &gt;&gt; You'll never tire of this refrain. You never tire of this melody. You'll never it'll never grow old. He that has begun this magnum opus will continue to work it until the day of Jesus Christ. Even as it meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, in so much as both in my bonds and in my offense and confirmation of the gospel, you're all partakers of my grace. For God is my record how greatly I long after you in all the bowels of Jesus Christ. And this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in all in knowledge and in all judgment. That ye may approve things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Jesus Christ. That's the nature of Christ, the approval of things that are excellent. We can leave today and become experts in our disapproval of things that are not excellent, right? Bogus. And we just go out and we're just completely fed up and disapproving of everything that's not excellent. But he wants us to grow in his knowledge that we can approve excellent things that we've been sincere and without offense, being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; under the glory and praise of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Said this way in Hebrews 12:2, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our magnumopus. &gt;&gt; He started it, he'll finish it. &gt;&gt; He that was begun this good work in you. Paul says in Galatians 2:20, I'm crucified with Christ, nevertheless, I live yet not I. Trying to build the momentum on how we approach the scripture here recently, but Christ liveth in me. &gt;&gt; The key, the key note, the masterpiece is alive in me. We have this treasure in earth and vessels. The excellency is not of myself but of God. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the son of God &gt;&gt; who loved me and gave himself for me. &gt;&gt; I'm living by faith. &gt;&gt; Musicians, you could come. I guess that means brother Elliott and Sister Rebecca, you could come to your instruments. Your magnum opus. What is it? What what's the context I'm putting it in today? Your faith. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you are. That's your masterpiece. &gt;&gt; By grace, you are saved through faith. What is it that I have? What is this work? The author and finisher of our faith. And this great work must pass through the hall of critics. &gt;&gt; That's your lifeline. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in your time of great trouble and affliction, what's going to comfort you is the word of God. So, what is the what is the devil going to try to make uncomfortable? God's word. If your lifeline in the life you now live, you live by the faith of the son of God. What is it that Satan's going to attack above all? Ultimately, he wants to get to the lifeline of faith. First John 5:es 4 and 5, for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Whosoever is born of God, it is by faith that we are the children of God. So faith is the victory. Who is it that overcometh the world? But he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God. Therein lies the secret to your overcoming. If you're not overcoming, if you've gotten weak, it's somewhere in the faith connection that you can get out of it. I'm telling you right now, there's no addiction. There's no battle. There's nothing you're facing that seems to be so overwhelming that if you could just get back in tune with that chord of faith, &gt;&gt; because that's what the devil's trying to get you out of tune to. &gt;&gt; By faith, we believe all things are possible. &gt;&gt; By faith, I believe. &gt;&gt; And so, the very thing that the devil wants to completely take away is faith. &gt;&gt; Don't let him do it. The Bible says Hebrews 10:23, "Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that promised." Let us hold fast the profession. In other words, it's what we confess to be ours. Let us hold fast our magnum opus. Let us hold fast to it. Why hold fast? Why would we be told to hold fast? because it's that very thing that'll be challenged. I do believe on some level we can describe it this way that you have by faith taken a hold of the key which is Christ and then Satan will hit you and hit you and hit you to get you to loosen your grip and get you to loosen your grip. And then when you let go and you begin to say, "I don't know. I don't know." And you begin to feel as if you're losing your mind and and everything gets in turmoil. Satan's got you where he where he wants you because now the hand of faith is going to try to reach and find something. And he's going to begin to tell you that hand never touched anything. You never felt anything. You never got anywhere to begin with. It's all a mirage. Look at all these other people in India that are Muslims because where they grew up or whatever, Hindu, whatever it might be. And you, what is it? It's just all coincidence for you. And you just need to rethink this. You need to go through this. And all of a sudden, that hand begins to think, "What have I done? What have I done?" Just reach out for Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's who it was you fell in love with. Amen. &gt;&gt; I could promise you none of you fell in love with me except for one of you. But you know what I mean. &gt;&gt; Right? I'm not holding your hand. &gt;&gt; Think of all the paths you took here. &gt;&gt; Who's leading you? Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I say this with all my heart. Don't let go of him. &gt;&gt; Just take your hand and reach back up &gt;&gt; and take Jesus Christ to say, "I believe you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Deliberately right now, I'm believing you. Let's stand. My gracious heavenly father, it's a dark day. It's an evil day. It's a horrible day, but I thank you for the light. Lord, we're challenged on every side, but you are yet still with us. The enemy draws close upon us, but we feel your love. And Lord, our heart aches in moments of great trial and loss of strength and even the question of our faith. But truly any truly we can say we've seen you. We've seen you. We've seen you and we believe [Music] Satan, you are defeated. You've lost your sting. The only power you have old hold of me is when I take the hand of faith and I pick up my doubt. So Lord, I empty my hands of doubt. I empty my hands of negativity. I empty my hands and I reach out to you and I take a hold of the key and I ask, Lord, give me understanding. Give me this bread, this spiritual bread of the Son of Man. Give me the truth, Lord, that I may know you, be at peace, delivered, free. I pray this for the young people. I pray this for all of us. Father, send the angel with the softest hands in this difficult moment. Minister to your bride. I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
