TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 1 verses 1 to 4. God who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophet so it's kind of a way of describing God who in times past in different ways spake to Israel through prophets and brother Ram takes this scripture and says it's not by but even in it says hath in these last days spoken on us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds could be in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and that's what I'm wanting to concentrate on today the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high what an introduction and may God bless you you can be seated as you can see we're continuing on the subject of the Kingdom I do hope those phrases Heaven's mystery and Earth's Glory are still resonating with you and have some a significance in placing as we look at this there's a lot of things we've been studying to minister on that we just haven't quite gotten to and in that uh I don't think I owe anyone apology for that but if it seems that we're not zeroing in on some of these elements I believe that the touch points are there and the connections are there I wanted to say this morning happy anniversary and you might not uh somebody may have an anniversary today and I don't realize it I just nailed it and you're thinking thank you brother and for remembering but it was three years ago today that our family arrived in Phoenix moving here permanently and it was the first Sunday of September 2020 that we held our first service permanently and since then we've never stopped and I really appreciate the grace of God and I say happy anniversary to the church and to you those of you who are part of this it's just been a real blessing I could say even in being on vacation uh that there's a there's a moment in the vacation where there's a Tipping Point where you know it's going to come to an end and you start to get anxious and you start to dread coming home and I could testify that I didn't have that Tipping Point and it's refreshing I was so excited to come back to Phoenix to be back in the service to the Lord to be with the people of God and it's wonderful to be on vacation and look forward to that and to look forward to coming home and that was our experience and I recognize that's a compliment to you and all glory and praise goes to the Lord and it was September 6th I believe on a Sunday that we held our first service so why don't we have service Wednesday night and have an anniversary service on Wednesday night you're all welcome back for that service I also wanted to express just how much I enjoyed the ministering of the word uh while we are away and I find myself thinking you know maybe next time I need to fake go on vacation and stick around to hear all the services because from Brother Manuel all the way to brother Chris they were just amazing just awesome services for me personally I just benefited so much from it I regretted that my family couldn't have been here for all the Coke and soda pop and all the calories that were consumed in the high fructose corn syrup on Wednesday night but just all the subject matter the local brothers who ministered brother Manuel brother Reggie brother Chris just fantastic brother elieza did a tremendous job I really enjoyed that and for me personally I just want to testify especially even as a pastor there's a lot of things you pray about and you you're just wrestling out and you feel in Your Heart Lord should I address something and should I say something and how should I approach this subject and it was just wonderful to sit back and watch the Lord use the men of God to take things that are pertinent that are necessary that are relevant and just put it bring it forth in such a way that if you were listening and you wanted to hear from God I believe you did and I believe that there was things shared that were a great blessing and benefit to you and I've heard great feedback from the few that have reached out and gave feedback and I just wanted to compliment you all as a church and everyone the minister in the world was just fantastic while we were gone and so I'm nervous this morning that I'll be like this buzz kill and step into this wonderful atmosphere and the trajectory of the word and ruin it so I've been really nervous over the last 24 hours in preparation my title uh kind of the subtitle today is character expression I think let's spend maybe a couple services on this aspect building uh these terms of character and expression a little bit we are starting to zero in more on the order of the kingdom and how that heaven is to be expressed in flesh is to be expressed on Earth we see this image of it in the eternity in Revelations 21 we see these expressions in Eternal things but there is a character of the Kingdom that's to be expressed noun you'll find that brother Brandon when he talks about the kingdom he often says that we're Children of the Kingdom act like it so there's a certain character that comes with it and God's kingdom is a has a domain so it has an order it has structure there's things that relate to it and above everything if I could put it this way it really is because I'm wanting it to be present tense right now where we're living today and an issue of manifesting the life and and not that we would see something and say oh that's what it looks like uh let me mimic it but rather have it so that it's doing its thing uh through us because there's this there's a difference between demonstrating something and impersonating something uh there's some there's those who can impersonate and they can do uh vocal impersonations they can impersonate someone's Voice or someone's mannerisms and like oh man that's just like so and so that that sounds just like them or you're acting just like them and and it can be a semblance of it but that's just an impersonation that's zeroing in on certain outward manifestations or characteristics and kind of catching a hold of those and then mimicking them and then there's a there's a way when you say well that was the impersonation but the person whom you're imitating they don't impersonate themselves they demonstrate themselves they demonstrate who they are and that's the thought and character expression and I was uh and while we were away studying and praying about different things and it was just remarkable how the Lord led me in a particular direction and I've been pondering how what does the Kingdom look like in the world today and a brother sent me an article from a publication and it was about a movement that's taking place in the world today the religious world today and the more I read it the more I thought you know this is this is amazing uh what they're thinking and what they're expressing what they're manifesting and they have a language that sounds scriptural but a representation that is Antichrist and it relates to things that we would believe in and we would love and and languages that we'd be using from the scripture and even things that we could even take from the message but it's not the expression of what the Kingdom looks like today and we could ask the question what does it look like today how is it being expressed and we've read from different places where brother Brown says the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life so the question could be what does that look like what does the what does it look like to bring the promise of today past to pass in our lives even go so far as to say what is the purpose and the goal this article that was sent to me this woman was felt that it was her mission in life to buy property to be used for this Kingdom movement in order to overthrow governments and put Christian senators in office and get the Christian governors in office and and realize it's just a wrong expression of the kingdom of God now I I feel uh Brother David Cleveland use a perfect word in the office with me before service I felt very vulnerable today because I have everything in front of me but I just don't feel I just feel that I've got to just follow the leadership of the Lord wherever he may take me today so if there was something you were wanting me to do for three years now is your chance good thing we don't have pews for me to run if you look in your Bibles Hebrews chapter 1 and we'll read verses one to four and what if what you were wanting me to do is to not have a PowerPoint we're going to be over in like three slides and so we even got that for you Hebrews chapter 1 verse one if we could look at this and I want you to think about expression that's what we're focusing on today is expression it says God now it's going to pick up in verse 2 God hath in these last days but now this phrase who's going to describe something God who we know is the word it says who at sundry times in a diverse manner spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets now for us what we could do is we could look at the Old Testament and say this is a great summation of the Old Testament Moses being a prophet right in the the first five books of the Bible expressing things about God and creation bringing them up into the promised land establishing all these uh principles that God then uses with Israel to deal with them he's saying that God spake uh in the prophet so God would come to the prophets reveal himself to the prophets and then when they spoke they would speak on behalf of God and it would be the word in them being expressed and we recognize scripture after scripture says the word of the Lord came to the prophet the word of the Lord came to the prophet and that's how he was made known the word came to the prophet he spoke it to Israel and brother Brandon makes this statement in Christ is the mystery of God revealed I would even give you maybe a steady point you could go and just look at the terminology of expression expressed expressing and look at it in Christ The Mystery of God revealed and you'll find it it's over and over and over again this is the threefold purpose of God to express himself he says the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible what a summation saying that the Bible expresses one goal one purpose that he wanted to achieve and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible have been in type now think of that in type Shadow and expressing what God's Great goal is I think that's a mouthful I think he says it says a lot in that statement that this entire Bible is expressing one goal and one purpose that he wanted to achieve and then he say the acts of the Believers in the Bible you could say the apostles and you could go to the prophets as this scripture saying it that it was in type expressing God's heart purpose or what he wanted to achieve brother I'm saying that thing that he had in the back part of his mind he says and now and this to me I guess is the real the real part to chew on he says now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it now this is this is narrowing God who feels all time in space and who is uh we cannot fathom him he's saying he's narrowed it all down to say that this great goal that God had this thought that he had in the back part of his mind this central theme they had in his heart is revealed and he's shown it in the last days now that's quite a statement it's a statement that we should often remind ourselves of when we're combing through the message to understand what is being taught when we're listening to the the messages and we're studying them we should always be reminding ourselves that God had one goal and one purpose and that he has expressed it in the last days and he is showing it in the last days and as he says that he was shown in types in the Bible and that God was expressing these things in the Bible there is something that repeats again and I think that's I want to just take that from that statement that he says there and now in the last days he's revealed it and shows it this is a repeat of something because in verse 2 verse 1 said God half verse 2 in these last days spoken to us unto us by his son now as Paul would write this we know that Paul was not one of the disciples but yet he had met Jesus Christ Our Lord and Christ had made himself known to him and that Paul's gospel I believe he touched on this uh uh maybe before we left how that we'd have to look at Paul's faith and his conversion as not a as a turning away from the Jewish religion or turning away from his faith but a fulfillment of his faith and it says hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son so now Paul orienting them the Hebrews to the fact that God used prophets but now he raised up one liken unto Moses this was the Messiah and he has spoken by his son now not the word coming to a prophet who spoke on behalf of God but now God has spoken by his son and brother Branham says that in the last days he's revealed it and showed it so there so now he's saying Paul says in the last days he spoke by his son now brother Branham saying in the last days he's doing something and speaking of the son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds that's a that's heavy lifting that statement who being the brightness of his glory so Christ is in the brightness of the glory of God he is the light of God this is he's manifesting God's uh something about God and the express image of his person and I so I I'll just stop on that verse there and that portion of this verse here he is the express image of his person Christ is so God hath spoken by the son who is the express image just take that phrase Express image and hold it in your heart now brother Bradham writes this in the church age book he says down through the centuries we could go and I think that kind of ties back into the entire Bible as the expression of one goal that God had and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible were in types it's down through the century as we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah John the Baptist and each one of these were God's Eternal thought expressed in its season that phrasing there is even good to study sometimes in its season the word in its season and you'll find that there are certain things that are the word but it's appropriate in its season it must be an appropriate season and therefore if something has a season then God's word in that season had a particular purpose God's word in that season had a particular manifestation the expression of God in Moses was one who was sent to take the Israelites out of slavery in bondage and but Jeremiah his ministry isn't exactly the same to go down into Egypt and to bring them out John the Baptist isn't exactly the same they manifest it's the word manifested in its season to meet the need that is presented to that age and he says each one where God's Eternal thought expressed in its season and I'm some some of the foundation the undergirding to this that we're not necessarily going to read all the statements from the message and all the scriptures these are things that are in God's heart or mind uh with him in the beginning part of his thought and his heart that are being expressed now continue and he says then we come to Jesus the logos there's a the word manifest in it sees in word manifest in its season then it comes to Jesus the logos and he says he was the perfect and complete thought expressed now glimpses in Moses in Jeremiah John the Baptist and you see shadows and types and you could even say with Joseph that he represented Perfection but he wasn't the Perfection there was just something portrayed in him that pointed to the perfect one that was coming David a man after God's Own Heart from which the the root and stem and the branch is going to come but yet he's not it when God brings forth the Messiah he doesn't resurrect David from the grave and say he was hit amongst you all this time he says then he comes and Jesus the logos is the perfect and complete perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that's each one of these statements is significant he was the perfect and complete thought expressed we could all have we could have thoughts in our minds that we think about and and they and they might even characterize us in a certain way I'm always thinking about this I'm thinking about this but then the thought is Vindicated or proven uh when we Act and and I think this may be the most commonly uttered phrase by parents is what were you thinking right and the most commonly uttered answer is nothing but there had to be some thought process that instigated the action and so brother Adam's just not saying thought but it's expressed and that thought Express became known as the word he says that is what he is and forever will be this is Christ the son in the expressed image of his person the perfect and complete thought expressed the Bible says God hath by his son spoken we know that in John chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God there's this one and the same this Oneness there with God The God Who is invisible then the God who becomes expressed and the invisible God not expressed in the logos the son and pre-figure before anything else exists and then to verse 14 John chapter 1 verse 14. and brother John are we done with the slideshow take out your pen and paper you can take notes now it says John chapter 1 verse 14 and the Word was made flesh this is God who hath spoken by his son God who was the word in the beginning was made flesh and dwelt among us and this characterization and we beheld to his glory this is the glory of the son but he says the Glorious of the only begotten of the father as a son then he he's not an uh uh he's not somebody who has just taken off the streets and say well I want to make you my son and my son died and I just want to adopt you and make you my son the son is the builder of the family name he is he is an expression of the attributes and the genes of the father just as our children Express mom and dad there this is the same for Christ he is the he is the son the only begotten of the father so when he says he's the only child at this point he's saying this is the one that expresses what was in God we haven't seen it anywhere else Moses may have manifested God in its season and he may have been a God to the people and Jeremiah may have been an expression of God and David a man after God's Own Heart expressed certain characteristics of God and in Joseph we can see the type of the Messiah ascending to the throne through suffering but yet we have never seen God expressed this way until the word was made flesh in Jesus Christ the Son of God and says full of grace and truth [Music] this is something that was uh part of God's nature God wanted to express who he was I if we could put it in the words of Coach green uh he he is who we thought he was right the he he is who he is but he's not happy being who he is he wants to express who he is something made manifest so Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and I was going back through yesterday and all the times that we've ministered on these scriptures and and how frequently we've uh ministered on these things and I just felt this release to revisit some of it because I'm wanting to give a little bit of a different emphasis on the expressing part God in the beginning created the heavens and the Earth he is expressing himself in his creation and then John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now we see Genesis 1 1 John 1 1 are united together in John 1 14. the word was made flesh in the beginning was the word and the word created and the word manifested in the word created all the things that are therein as the Bible's saying and and he brought all these things forth God bringing these things forth but now that word is made flesh in Jesus Christ God wanting to express himself happy just to let himself out piece by piece Through the Ages and through the Old Testament but it was just building and maybe this seems anticlimactic but it was built into the climax of Jesus Christ born of a woman born in a stable the life of Jesus Christ was the climax this is the the head of it so brother Branham said then Jesus came the logos in John 1 1 in the beginning was the word that word there is logos the Greek word logos and we're all very familiar with that that phrasing and brother man brings this out in the church age book and this is where I'm drawing this from the logos is that which isn't spoken and it being spoken it embodies a concept or an idea oh if we say a word is a thought expressed then there has to be some idea some kind of concept with the word if I just said and you say well yeah too and you want to go habitat later do you want habata for lunch and say well I mean it's a sound maybe there's some enunciation there and maybe I'm speaking a language that I don't understand and yet it's there's no what what's what's the meaning of it what's what's behind it what does that phrase mean and that can be the the the trial of trying to learn English right reported we use phrases like man that's bad you're like oh yeah bad no no no good no that's good and if any of your kids say man that is sick and you say well we'll pray for it no no no no no that's good and so sometimes we're using a language that the word on it on the surface wouldn't necessarily convey what we're trying to mean but there's a thought and intent behind it and that's where to me I still feel like the logo sometimes maybe it's more in theological circles they get into the ream of oh wait wait the logos is one thing we want the Rima but the logos itself is everything the logos is spoken it is the word and what it does is it carries a concept or some idea some principle if I can say characteristic and brother Brown makes this statement the concept of God was expressed in Jesus nobody's going to shout at that one the concept of God was expressed in Jesus he says God became expressed in the person of Jesus Christ God the invisible is expressed the the person of Jesus Christ expressed God and when he uses the phrase the concept of God and he's bringing it from this Greek word logos which is not just a thought but it deals with speech so it's an articulation of something it's the expression of something God as a concept I maybe we don't even think about the concept of God but Elohim the logos embodied something and this concept of who God is and what he is is expressed in Jesus and then he makes this statement and I I want to amplify this for the remainder of our time today and into tomorrow morning Jesus Christ was I haven't preached for a week now I did preach Sunday and Wednesday we were gone then I didn't preach on a Sunday and Wednesday it's fabulous he says Jesus Christ was God expressing himself in man two men Jesus Christ was God expressing himself and you're having to kind of use your mind and think a little bit that there is Jesus Christ the word made flesh not born between a man and a woman but born of a woman and the Very the blood cells that made him up were the spoken word of God so he's bypassed a sinful birth but yet he comes through the woman and here of this one Jesus the man Christ Jesus it says God is expressing himself in Jesus Christ and two men so God is in Jesus expressing himself to humanity Jesus Christ was God expressing himself in Jesus Christ to man so give some deep thought to this Jesus Christ was God expressing himself to express something is to represent uh visually as an artist would render something and that's that's an expression of some creative thought so to express is to represent visually or to put into words where and we could say uh you know I can say well I'm angry and that's an expression of some feeling that I'm having or some emotion that I'm experiencing or it could just merely be vented out through some sort of display that uh that is speaking of the fact oh well he must be upset or maybe when you yawn or you fall asleep that's an expression that you're tired and there's a way that you're showing what's on the inside is coming out and one of the things that I find myself as a parent uh dealing with my children is not so much what they're feeling because those are things that maybe we can't control you have to be very careful as parents says don't you cry you know and I mean they're just made up of emotions you're the most cryinst person we've ever met of course your kids are going to cry and so there's a there's a certain thing that they're just they're gonna do it and and so there's a point in which it's okay if you're frustrated I understand that you're upset I realize uh that you're bored or you're experiencing certain emotions but the ability to to mediate those emotions and to control those emotions and to not always express them that way that's the mark of maturity and that's the mark of recognizing wow I'm really angry right now and I want to punch the wall but punching the wall wouldn't be the right way to deal with my anger because there's a there's a the expressing you could do something visually or an action or to put it into words and this phrase to express means to speak one's mind and this is what God was doing when it says that Jesus Christ was God expressing himself it was God ex speaking his mind and to express something that means to press it or to squeeze it out if you're going to express you represent something it's to describe it to portray it to imitate it or to translate it so God is being represented God is being portrayed in Jesus Christ and to express means to literally it means to press out and just to wake everybody up it means espresso anybody want another shot how many do you need today an espresso that's where we get this Latin phrase it means to press out this expression to press it comes to the Latin Premiere means to press so here's Jesus Christ and God is pressing himself uh in Christ and he's pressing himself into this this manifestation if God who is invisible God the law Gods who in times past would reveal himself to a prophet and and that would be the word in the prophet being spoken but they're just glimpses and shadows and types and they're imperfect and and they fail and they made mistakes but now there came one who was the logos and it's God pressed God pressed into man but now that God has spoken by his son and pressed into man but now he wants to press chill man to this Latin word means as clay Under Pressure takes the form of an image so if God has expressed that means God who has some sort of representation he's pressed and it forms this image this Mark if I could put this this identification John chapter 14 verse 7 to 12. just read this with me I'm only going to be picking up on uh one particular part here are just a few things that we want to carry forward just recognize this as we read this if you had known me you should have known the father also now that's that's what the sun is to do to express this invisible God that cannot be touched cannot be handled cannot be felt uh that that the children of Israel said don't even speak to us have somebody else speak to us said if you knew me you would know God also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him now I believe that Philip was tapping into it and he's kind of on the edge of his seat and he's kind of he's recognizing wait a minute I get it now that what I'm looking at is the as the son of God is to show me who the father is and and as this excitement Wells up with them he says Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us and I think this is spoken from a place of longing in a place of Faith as the Jews with this God who could not be seen he could not be touched and could not be handled if something is stirring up inside well just then just show us the fathers you've seen him let us see him and Jesus says have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me Philip and then I guess if we could put it in these these words I've been with you this long in this time that I've been with you you still haven't figured it out that that he that hath seen me hath seen the father and then why do you say how I say thou men show us the father when you see me you see God and Phillips thinking yeah but as a human that's not Computing to me if there's one Beyond you then that's the one I want to see and Jesus is bringing out something a mystery of heaven and he's saying no when you've seen me you've seen the father that in beholding me and me making myself known and seeing me this is how God has made known I've been with you this long and yet you still don't know me if I could just uh use some conjecture here and I'm not saying it is this way but in the short time that he had been with them is is Jesus even acknowledging that the more they became familiar with Christ in a certain way the less they were being coming in tune with the supernatural that was in them that if if I wanted to see God and then I saw Jesus Christ he says that and he and he's speaking of things that he's doing he's doing the things that he's doing then after a while I can begin to identify with Christ in such a way to where say well he's got hands like me got feet like me got hair like me this is and I start to look at him in such a way and Jesus have I been with you so long that you become familiar with certain things about me that that is opticating the view that you can't actually see the father being expressed because you identified too much with the humanity I hope you could really give thought to Jesus Christ was God expressing himself in man and to men he says when you've seen me you've seen the father believeth thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of them of myself catch this phrasing but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works therefore what I do he's saying is God doing it in me the father dwelleth in me he does the works therefore the works that I'm doing are the manifestation of him whom you cannot see this is the manifestation of him who was before all things and though someone in the Old Testament could have done one thing and that expressed an attribute of God Moses standing in the Gap Kings making certain proclamations say glimpses and and little scenes we say now God is in me he does the works he says believe me that I am in the father and the father and me or else believe me for the very work's sake so this is the proposition of verse 10. the father God is manifested in the son and he says believe me that I'm in the father and the father and me now he's saying take me out my word and this is the hardest thing that brother Branham said that we have to do is to get one mortal man to believe another and and I the the reason of that is as because you know when someone makes a promise we just kind of poke them a little bit and check their pulse we're like yeah you have a heartbeat just like me you were born just like me you breathed just like me and I know what how humans are and I know what they're like and I know what they're prone to and there's certain things about the human characteristics but he's saying that now don't just if you can he's asking us to take him at his word believe me because I tell you that the father is in me and he's doing the works he says but if you won't take me at my word my very works my very works are now going to back up what I'm saying and it's not a matter of him saying you know God's left-handed did you know that all right and he's gonna you're gonna sign his name with his left hand everybody oh right look he's God God's left-handed he's writing with his left hand it's not some sort of arbitrary physical act by saying you believe me for my work's sake verily verily I say unto you now this is where it gets heavy verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also he's saying believe me that I am in the father and the father in me believe me and he that believes him and takes him out his word The Works that I do shall he do also I think that's quite a statement The Works that he did the believer will do also and then he just takes it a step further and Greater Works than these shall he do who the believer because I go unto my father and this is no small thing and we read right past it and and yet we could spend the rest of our time together here on Earth just taking the Greater Works the Greater Works than thee shall he do because I go into my father and these these we can look at greater than these the v's of Christ we could spend eternity expressing the things written in this Bible we could just go over and over and over because it was gone expressing himself in man to me so there's some concept of God that's being portrayed to me and these works that are recorded here and these things that pertain to Christ they're expressing God and then I could take it a step further say Greater Works than these the Believers going to do wow we can amplify that Without End he says because I go to my father and there's something that can be Amplified Without End now if I could express it this way there's somebody counting how many times I say Express are the derivatives thereof this is when he says this the father that dweth in me he doeth the works and it comes back to it believe me for the very work's sake if you believe the works that I do shall you do also Greater Works than these because I go to my father what he is referring to is a special expression it's a unique quality there's some unique quality to his works that sets him apart there's there's something about these works that would make make him different than all the prophets something different about the works that he's saying believe me I I'm just overwhelmed with it and so I'm I'm doing my best to to drink out of a fire hydrant and tell you what it tastes like there's there's God expressed in Christ I says the father that dwelleth in me he's doing the works and he's confident enough to say The Works that I do will declare to you God will declare to you the father and and bring inciting bring of faith to do the Greater Works if I could even go so far as to say that and these works are so special and unique and I know you're just you're wanting me to tell you what they are I'm just saying they are so special and unique that Christ could say that you can believe me for those work's sake wow some unique quality that declared God John chapter 1 verse 18 says no man have seen God at any time the only begotten son is we're coming back to the very phrasings of verse 14. no man has seen him physically with his eyes you say well Moses saw the backside of God that was a way that God chose to express himself uh and it but it was it's with measure it's limited I there's things and I'm wanting you to think as I told you in the very beginning or towards the beginning let's give deep thought to how he says that God Christ was expressed God expressing himself in man to man and there's things where God moved and there was a wind there was an earthquake there's a fire and these are things that are the effects God causing them so there are in some way a manifestation or expression of God's presence but you couldn't find God in it he wasn't in the wind he wasn't in the fire he's not in the earthquake in other words God's concept or his idea and what he's trying to convey yes that's him but don't you want to those are things that he's caused or some sort of stirring but don't you want to know him but that that's one thing that he can cause that it's one thing that he can be seen in that but those are just kind of partial glimpses we see God in creation we see him in the glory of the sunrise and the sunset we see his fingerprints in nature and there's a lot of ways that are declaring to us God's design and God's purpose but yet I'm not happy seeing him in the beauty of his creation I'm not I though I'm happy to see him and you but I want to know him in a way that's Transcendent beyond the human things I want to know him in a way that he can only be known by Hallelujah there's something about this this expression of Christ that no man has seen God at any time and then the pausing of John the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him that is to say that up to this moment no man can say that they have seen God but now we can say we have seen God in Jesus's own words he says have I been I've been with you if you've seen me you've seen God and the Very phrase in the bosom of God we might think in the sense of well one who's nestled there at the Chester one that might be very near to him but it means the one who is the same as God who is in the bosom of the father who is at the heart of who he is who is Central to his person Christ the son of God the only begotten son who is in the bosom who is the same as God he hath declared him He has expressed him Christ who is in the image of man God has pressed himself into this person and has it has portrayed and has translated himself to man we could have never seen him unless God chose a means which was Slash to say who he was because Jesus Christ was God expressing himself in man two men but the Branham takes this in the church age book The Perkins age chapter five the language is so close to Hebrews one God who on occasions would manifest his presence by the cloud or pillar fire that struck fear in the hearts of men this is God's expression in the Old Testament sundry times in diverse manners God could manifest in a pillar fire god could be expressed in a cloud God could manifest himself in Supernatural signs and wonders I said God as he wants to God can do whatever he wants this God whose hard characteristics were made known only by revelation of words through the prophets so these things God's will God's desire he would speak him to His prophets prophets would make it known this is track in Hebrews chapter 1. now became Emmanuel God who manifested in certain ways pillar fire cloud Who certain characteristics should be known by the revelation of words says now became Emmanuel God With Us declaring himself this is John 1 18 declaring himself he takes this word in John 1 18 the word declare is taken from the Greek root which we often interpret as exegesis and maybe that gets some of you excited but we're not going to get into the exegesis on it but he says it's interpreted which means to thoroughly explain and make clear the exegesis is the proper interpretation the correct interpretation he's saying that Jesus God made himself known through revelation of words God made himself known through certain signs and wonders but now he has become flesh now he has declaring himself and this declaration means to thoroughly explain and make clear Jesus Christ thoroughly explains it makes clear this God who gave glimpses of heart characteristics and would temporarily manifest himself through different means now in Jesus Christ he has thoroughly explained and made clear now I'm easy to say right but then go ahead and read read the red letter read the history and you'll find that he still is only known by revelation bet the clarity's there the image is there the express image the only begotten son who is the same as God hath declared has thoroughly explained and made clear who God is he says this is what the Living Word Jesus did he brought God to us for he was God Birmingham even uses the phrase that he revealed God in perfect clarity or with perfect clarity Jesus Christ this one who is born of Mary who lived a life of 33 years his story his teachings his actions his journeys revealed god with perfect clarity are you pondering what I'm pondering how how what made him the perfect revelation of God what are the characteristics it's not even the name because the name pre-existed to him it's not the fact that he was a a male who circumcised at a certain age because there was ones before him the clothes that he wore were commonly worn the food that he ate was commonly eaten there's a lot of things about Jesus Christ that we could say well uh these are all things that we could say are human therefore that begs the question what is divine can I ask that question of you today what is deity what is the logos who is this Elohim what is essential to him and what makes him who he is and how is it that I can know him through Jesus Christ what is it about this man Christ Jesus the the son of Joseph and Mary who lived a life on and in Galilee this Jesus and Nazareth how is it that he shows me with perfect clarity who God is how is he the perfect revelation of God so much so to her John could write in first John verses one and two that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands had handled now John could say this in every single one of these he could say literally by means of physical sins I've heard I've seen I've looked upon I've gaze that I've processed and my hands have handled if you came to John said oh there was no Jesus of Nazareth he said I touched them I've held us I've leaned into his chest I've seen him I've heard them that which was from the beginning he says the word of life the word of life oh what a what a phrase the word of life as it's expressed The Word of Life what a phrase we've heard we've seen we've looked upon we've handled and so he explained he explained he's talking about Jesus Christ so he explains and it's kind of put in parentheses for the life was manifested the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shown to you that eternal life this is First John chapter one verses one and two that which was from the beginning the word of life has been manifested and that's what we're showing to you eternal life he says which was with the father and was manifested unto us this is God himself who is the word the word Zoe life there's only one form of eternal life this is God expressed this is Jesus Christ who is the Living Word that makes God present he is now he was manifested unto us this is why brother Brandon could say the concept of God was expressed in Jesus Jesus Christ was God expressing himself in men to men he became that perfect expression of God his brother Branham says in the church age book here it is most evidently set forth that and I believe this is his commentary in first John 1. here it is most evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of God in the son was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works here it is most evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of God so the perfect manifestation of God and here's your formula the indwelling of the spirit there can be no perfect manifestation of God unless the spirit indwells unless the life so when John says that we have looked upon and handled the word of life manifested it's not that we have touched someone who who'd felt the wind we're not we're not hearing from somebody whose house was destroyed by an earthquake when God spoke we're not talking to somebody who found a pyramid-shaped rock in Sabina Canyon this is one who had the life and the life which was the light of men is now living through a person and it's this life that has lived the indwelling of the spirit in the man Christ Jesus is the perfect expression of God or manifestation of God because it's the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works I could spend a lot of time just on that phrasing in word and works and and my my lead up to this has been that there is a uh the devil would want to the devil's tactic is division and for those of you who hate math right that's the devil's tactic is division and if he can't get you to divide he'll just say get you to add [Music] come on school children all right this is Matthew C this is Rebecca this is by the white Christian Academy whatever brand you are there is a he wants to divide that's just that's his tactic so there is an expression of God and what he would want to do is chop it up think of this Jesus Christ was God expressing himself in man to man brother Adam says the indwelling spirit manifested in word and works so the work these works whatever they were these Works were the word manifested the spirit manifesting Inward and works there are if I could just refer to this for a moment and I'll I'll find a place to stop just hopefully maybe very near here I feel that I'm conveying what's in my heart enough to stop very shortly there are works as we've said already that manifest God's presence but this is a different emphasis the word of life he says the life was manifested are you catching that the life was manifested now Paul says that we understand the things of Man by the spirit of man that is in us and so if I can by the spirit of man understand the nature and the things of man it's because the human Spirit identifies with the human spirit and he goes so far as to express that the things of God the human mind cannot comprehend because that's a different mind it's a different thought it's a different life and in the same way that you ought to be very worried about yourself if you really get your dog right he's like man I get it I know why he rolls around in that stuff I know exactly what he's thinking right I mean there's there's something to be said about you you might be a dog right and that word has all sorts of meanings these days there's something about the nature being expressed that someone else who has this like right on I get it I feel you because it's the life he says the life was manifested so there has to be we have to have a deeper thought to think well how is it a man doing things a man can do is going to express in any way who God is should I just stop there because that's enough to think about but how is it that any one of us we are limited to the mannerisms of men we're limited to the the laws of nature in ways that we find ourselves inclined that if if God had a thought and I was going to express it I would have to use the same means now in terms of God speaking to my heart and I'd say thus saith the Lord the Lord said to do this I would be using the same mouth they eat Cerritos right and the same one that has said so much about how much I like it to people who've had it and didn't like it believe it or not right because you ordered it wrong and as this idea says wow these are these are human sounds and these are human words and these are human expressions and these are things that human does then and then somehow God's trying to convey himself in that if I'm if I'm getting anything across I hope that I'm just kind of putting in words that maybe you haven't been able to that this is something Supernatural to see God it's something it's something oh Hallelujah if he's if you've seen him you should be happy if he's made himself known you that that's the most Supernatural thing that could happen is to get beyond the surface and see him see him standing in his word the same yesterday today and forever and not having been so long with us that all we see anymore is the human part and therefore do the math in our mind and say well then if he's here then the human part must be him then what have we done we've done this and that looks creepy therefore these works that he's referring to cannot be separated from word but this is a different emphasis and the emphasis is from the the in feigning is the is the the Latin to be in to show so God is in something showing means to shine and when you emphasize something if we're going to be doing it in a typography we might use bold we might use a different color we might use all caps and what we're trying to convey is some emphasis that that we're portraying this this extra stress that's given Force that's given to a word or utterance and the emphasis can change the meaning right you know let's eat Grandma you can say well a comma is going to change everything it's just so let's eat Grandma right the emphasis let's eat grandma right the emphasis changes the meaning what what's for lunch because the emphasis gives clarity I I hope that you're picking up when I'm laying down that it's the it's in the emphasis now we are to speak where God speaks and stay silent where God is silent and oh God help us to emphasize what he has emphasized the emphasis the extra stress given to a word that and that that's you're going to emphasize it a little bit and the emphasis is a is a clue that implies there's something more to the surface it's the signification it signifies something it says it has sign it has meaning and brother Adam says this and I'm sharing this just too I guess I'm kind of piecing this out a little bit and I'm running out of time and I'll just skip it so then let's think this way an emphasis in the stress of the word he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also what works became the perfect expression of God in his life where was the emphasis that I could pick up on and say there's my CL there's my clue there's the true nature of God Jesus sits down Republicans and Sinners and we say oh there's the nature of God then where are we all going today right we want to fight well that's why we're here but there's a there's an idea in our minds say well am I going to is that what the emphasis is is that where it's at and this is what man has labored to do is to find the formula and say oh well God is where there's this so they come up with this and they want to sell you the Emperor's New Clothes because they want to keep spinning the yarn and building something and it gets enough traction if they can't do it with kind words they'll just bully you into it to make you feel like well isn't this beautiful isn't this great isn't this the word isn't this God this is it right this this is it and at first you're like and they're like you're a believer you're a message believer and you don't see this and so you start to say yeah yeah I I I I I see it you see it right I see it don't we all see it you see it right this this is God right and with and and with enough to emphasis in us being sincere After all you've got that right this is it then you say this is taking something that maybe God uses taking something that could be the characteristic of God that's revealed through through a manifestation but this is something different where is the true nature of God oh I'll say it this way is this something different it's taking me an hour to get to the express image now hopefully this will give us something to move from Jesus Christ was the expressed the express image of his person the phrase that's used there that is written it's not past tense the express image and it makes reference to a person that is an exact copy is it the ship of our thesis brother Michael in philosophy oh you're not the philosopher who's the philosopher there is it the ship of alphysus am I getting it right brother Luke am I getting am I saying it wrong I'm pronouncing it wrong that's maybe what I'm doing Alfred the ship of Alfred the the philosophical argument is if you took a ship and piece by piece replaced a part of the ship to where eventually the entire ship has been replaced is it still the same ship all right let's go would it even be the same how could it be the same how could it be an exact ly so the express image is a concept of the tool or person that is the Engraving or that is that it that is engraving the exact copy because it's the mark so there's an instrument that has the mark and so that's the that's the image and it's that which is used the express image presses and when it presses it leaves a mark and so by the mark you can tell what the original was so it's the instrument used for Engraving or carving actually comes from the word to sharpen to a point so the idea of imprinting something or scratching something right leave a mark when he says the express image then of his person he was the exact expression or image of God he was that marked likeness or the precise reproduction in every detail the express image therefore is whatever God was that could not be seen has been pressed into Christ so that when you've seen him there's no guesswork when you whatever you can make out in him is a part of God whatever you can see in him you can be sure this is God this was God and the word express image in the Greek is character that's what was being pressed into Christ was the character of God that if you take a in typography or print setting and you have a typeset you'd create the letter and it would be a carved out and then with the ink you put that on paper and that's what an old-fashioned typewriter would do is it'd take that and replicate it on paper and you would know what the other image was well that was an l and that was an e and that was a t and that was a t that was an e that was an R because it was pressed into the paper using ink and this is what God was who was the word is pressed into Jesus Christ and that that letter that God was that logos that was God was that word is pressed into Christ he's the character he is that character of God and now if we take that in what's been meant by he's the express image therefore he is the defining he has in him the defining quality or feature as brother Eliza was ministering on however this this thing here is just mostly space and how molecules and the way he was even using the the math and science and I apologize if I felt Vindicated that guys came in here the ministers who preached were more heady than I have been I was like well thank you for making me sound more more normal uh with the the science that they're able to get into I said well yeah that's what this is but it this what's the state of this solid and it's it's presenting in certain characteristics and this is what a characteristic is a feature of H2O H2O can present in different ways right it could be I just need a drink it could be a liquid it could be solid it could be vapor and therefore the it's it's in the quality a character is a defining quality or feature you could not just say well this is this is a solid then it must be it must be H2O it wouldn't be just because water can be solved doesn't mean everything that's solid is water the defining quality or of a feature character is the sum of qualities that define a person and distinguish it from another Jesus Christ was the express image of God we could put it this way we could read Hebrews 1 verse 3 to say he was the character of God that in him is the mystery and the secret to who God is in him was a distinguishing feature that made him different from all other men was the fact that he rose from the dead is that what made him God other men had risen from the dead we could even say if we take the scripture and you would accept the scripture how it's written and how brother Brown taught it that Enoch did not taste death that Elijah even go in a chair to fire that he these are ones that bypassed even the physical death that Jesus Christ partook of there was a defining characteristic a distinctive trait there's a distinctive trait in the express image to say it's the sum there's the math again but now this is when it's the total the complete the very essence the highest the utmost if Jesus Christ was God expressing himself in man to man if in him was the spirit manifested in word and works and he was the perfect manifestation that he declared unto us God and that he was the perfect and complete thought expressed the concept of God expressed then what was the defining quality of God what is an expression that becomes this distinctive trait I I'm wanting to merely get you thinking I'm wanting you to uh wrestle with that Russell what is it that makes God who he is and if there's if there's all if there's all sorts of noise how can I filter through it to find him what's the next what's distinctive about him musicians if you'd come I'll just end here or well this will help me end God in the sermon identification and I'd recommend this one from 1964. I have some other quotes here from 63. you know I don't know if brother Phillip if that was at the Mesa Church there in January of 63 or in Phoenix but he says in the sermon identification God came down and the character of God was Christ now I'm saying a whole lot without without saying anything right God came down and the character the express image the character of God is expressed in Christ he was the reflection he was God made visible notice God made visible and he gives us John 1 1 in the beginning was God he wasn't even God then no God is an object of worship only thing he was was eternal and in him now we're going all the way back before the beginning in him we're attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed to words and words were made manifest from thought to word to flesh thought to word the flesh to expression it's all God becoming tangible Glimpse Glimpse glimpse of the Old Testament but then John says the word of life became tangible it was always elusive was no other word was no other word he had the word but then he fell was Moses the word was mostly he had the word but then he failed was David the word was that he had the word but and then you find yourself where it's elusive it just keeps slipping through our hands just when we think we found the one we just we found the evidence we found the sure thing it just slips right through our hands but Christ does God becoming tangible and you he says it's all God becoming tangible and you are a part of God and Jesus come to redeem those who were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem if you could those of you who've been reading uh the future home sermon this thought of being expressed is just in that repeat in there repeatedly so I was going to take it from there I chose a different direction but go there and you'll find Eternal attribute expressed is at the heart of the future home the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride they're all Eternal attributes expressed it was God's thoughts and that's when he come to redeem and them as soon as it's it strikes to them they see it because it's the light the life is in there but a life isn't there then what can they do they don't see it they'll never see it says and the whole thing is Jesus said at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father and me I and you and you and me when the Revelation is made known yes he says the whole thing is God becoming material like a husband and wife becoming one together God and his church becoming one this is the whole thing becoming material the whole thing is God becoming material the flesh is becoming word the word was made flesh now he says invisibility the word is becoming the flesh is becoming word in Romans chapter 8 verse 29 says for whom he did for no there's the Eternal thought existing before he also did predestinate to be conformed now we if you can accept it today you are an attribute of God Eternal in his heart and now you've been predestined to be conformed to the image of his son the language has been repeated through the verses that we've read the begotten of the Father the only begotten of the father but now the language has changed that there were other attributes in him and thoughts in him that were predestined to be conformed to the image the same image of the son that he might be not the only begotten but the firstborn at one time he's the only begotten but now he becomes the firstborn among many others who are likewise stamped [Music] predestined to be conformed means we are ordained to replicate his likeness that we are ordained for him to be pressed into us and to be pressed out of us that he wants to imprint us the same way he did Jesus Christ and that God who is an image was pressed into Christ he has ordained us to be impressed to be another Express image brother Branham says the Eternal thoughts of God he says let me ask you something are the thoughts of God Eternal eternal are they are the thoughts of God Eternal he says if you can see this you'll see many things and that's quite a statement if you can see that the thoughts of God are Eternal he said then you can see many things he says God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior in both character nature character in word and and action in word and works there's things that are essential to God and are unchanging the essence is that which something that gives you that particular character what makes something salty salty what's the fact that it's salty that's what gives it its Essence its character and it's the thoughts of God expressed God is unchangeable in his Essence and behavior therefore there is a character of God that is the manifestation of God there are other things there's other ways that God can be expressed right but then there's a way that is the character that belongs to him alone [Music] brother Branham said God is featured in character [Music] God is featured in character it's that symbol or imprint on one's soul it's a quality and a likeness that is him [Music] and that's character character of God pressed there's a life that's his and his alone that's the one we want stand with me today
