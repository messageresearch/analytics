TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'd like to continue on the subject of a Place full of Mercy this is coming on uh the heels of is there room for mercy and asking the question of is there room for mercy and taking some very outstanding scriptures uh that are being fulfilled in the time that we're living in right now things that brother brandham identified with his own Ministry Revelations chap 10 and Luke 17:30 and so we see certain events unfolding and things taking place and so it challenges us as we see those things in scripture and then we also recognize that it challenged brother Brandon because then he preaches a sermon souls in prison now and he's asking the question and speculating could it be in light of these things that have been fulfilled that we've entered this time of Ministry of Jesus Christ where no one can be saved and the door of Mercy shut and he's saying I sure hope not I hope I'm wrong I hope not and I believe the purpose of that sermon was so that we or one of the things that I gather from from that as you recognize the significance of the things that have been fulfilled what brother Brandon may have previously thought would happen now since it's not happening he's wondering is there this time even in this last day where there's this third pole Ministry which is only to the lost or which is to the Lost who can't be saved kind of this witness um in hell to those who are stuck and going to remain in Tribulation and as You Follow the uh the message and you continue to go forward in the message you'll find that he said that the third pull is to to the totally lost to the bride and to the church and so he sees this uh he sees as time goes on how God is fulfilling his word and interpreting his word by bringing it to pass and we're looking at when we say A Place full of Mercy we're looking at even ourselves being Merc full in a time of judgment that if we're looking at a time when the word has been made plain and we see the plainness of the word of God and we see the standard of the word of God and we see that God hasn't watered down Holiness and we see that he hasn't watered down the message and a lot of different ways then we ought to be merciful in this time of judgment because it is a a terrible day it is a very dark day and then also not that we would just be merciful but that even we ourselves and those that need it can find Mercy in this time that we're living in now and it's so good to know that Ephesians chapter 2:4 tells us but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us he's Rich that means he's abounding in Mercy that means kindness and good will and so he abundantly supplies Mercy if you ever ask is is is Mercy over just remember God's rich in Mercy and he abundantly supplies mercy and one of the things I've been thinking about is just all the scriptures his mercy endureth forever so if there is a mercy that's over it's not that there's no more Mercy whatsoever at all because God is rich in Mercy but it's understanding that God at one time who may have addressed something a certain way as the age changes he gives a message that holds us account accountable and so God rich in Mercy his mercies are renewed every morning this is something about the nature of God and his Mercy where where he is rich in it and he abundantly supplies this Mercy brother Brandon when he preaches God rich in Mercy right here in Phoenix it was in January of 1965 I'd encourage you to go listen to that he says if he was just rich in money if he was just rich in materials which he is but yet the greatest thing is being rich in Mercy that's wonderful I guess from our standpoint and our Vantage Point uh if he's rich in money if he's rich in materials that's wonderful that's great and he owns a cattle on a thousand hills but what's most important to us and the greatest thing is that he's rich in Mercy it's by his Mercy that we'll be able to participate in those things that he owns in verse five even when we were dead in sin so God was rich in Mercy and even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace he are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Paul says we were dead in sins and that should alert us to the consequence for sin and Justice required death for sin and us being dead in sins that means we're sentenced to death uh we Face Eternal damnation but being merciful god offered a substitute for us find in a different places where brother Adam uses this scripture in Ephesians Chap 2:4 and he says but God rich in Mercy when we were dead in sins and he's creating this image of uh of being sentenced and being punished and death hanging over us he said he offered a substitute for us and he it goes through how in the Old Testament there was the offering of BL the blood of bulls and goats and that was a substitute for that time but then he says Jesus Christ was our substitute he is the Bible says our perpetuation which is Mercy Seat he is our atonement he is our substitute uh the word God requires death for sin and since there had to be the payment of death for sin we sh ought to die for our sins eternally the second death we ought to be vanquished because of our sins forever but Christ becomes the substitute the substitute death for these sins now do you get the Paradox God rich in Mercy and he's going to demonstrate his Mercy by saying my son my only begotten son why don't you die and and we're over here saying oh what mercy and and the sacrifice is saying Mercy but it's a paradox how that Mercy was shown in judging his own son sin was judged in his own son and sin being judged right there on the mercy seat right there in Christ that perpetuation it was Mercy to us and so there is this Paradox when it comes to the Penalty and the judgment and the mercy and the justice but yet we know that though we were dead in sins Christ becomes that substitute and it demonstrates his Mercy to us so that verse 7 that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus recognize how there is this forward movement this trajectory where we are saved and as he's talking to the believer here who has been baptized by one Spirit into the body of Christ so this isn't a question of Salvation in verse se s he's saying that we who are sealed into the body of Christ we who have been saved as we have been and those of us who have experienced this Rich Mercy he has done this that he wouldn't just be done with us but he would show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness through Christ Jesus so there is a Salvation and then there's a continued uh Grace there's a continued kindness that can be shown to us through Christ Jesus to show it's he showed mercy so that he can continually Supply Grace and kindness abundantly so his Mercy opens up to us this relationship where he can continually Supply Grace in his kindness so it's God who is rich in Mercy and this this dis uh God is a God of Justice and Justice required death and so God in his Mercy brought a substitute and we are beneficiaries of that I want you to see that this is Jesus Christ who then becomes the Judgment he he he represents the Judgment in Acts 17: 30 and 31 a very important scripture to be uh looking at in light of the end times he says in the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent and I'm not so much focusing on what he's referencing here because obviously he at the time of this ignorance so he's looking at something past but now there is a Commandment that all men everywhere must repent why because verse 31 he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained who is that man he's going to judge the World by Jesus Christ because he says whereof he hath given Assurance un all men in that Heath raised him from the dead so God is going to judge the world not by denomination not by your opinion not by your experience but we are all going to be judged he judges the World by the word which is Jesus Christ he has appointed a day in which he's going to judge the world in righteousness by Christ Jesus so Christ is uh there's these different uh as ects to Christ these different attributes of the word of God expressed in Christ and he's going to judge by Jesus Christ in Psalms 85:10 you'll recognize some of these scriptures as review from Wednesday night but it speaks of Jesus Christ This Is A Prophecy of the Messiah mercy and Truth are met together and peace have kissed righteousness and peace have kissed each other remember how brother Brandon begins to talk about heaven and earth kissing and embracing at the baptism of Christ at the Jordan River mercy and Truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other and then this beautiful expression truth shall spring out of the earth truth is going to rise up out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven and there's this meaning of righteousness and Truth this mercy and Truth uniting righteousness and peace kissing each other this is Christ the pritu The Mercy Seat the atonement the substitute in Christ is Judgment in Christ there's Justice in Christ uh there's Mercy because in Christ there is truth am in Psalms 98:9 and then continuing into the next chapter verse one before the Lord for he cometh to judge the Earth which with righteousness shall he judge the world and the people with Equity this is what God is this is the only way he could do it you say well God's going to judge with with righteousness and with Equity he can do it no other way other words God can't judge with unrighteousness he can't judge with inequity God judges you just have to accept it that God being the God of All is fair in his judgments true and right and just he is and and then chapter 99 verse1 the Lord reth let the people tremble he sth between the cherubims let the Earth be moved now he's judging and it says here where is he judging from where where is this judgment going forth where is it that he's going to judge the world and the people with equity he gives this image of where he sits where he dwells as it says in Exodus 25: 21 and 22 Thou shalt put the mercy seed above upon the ark and the Ark in the ark Thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee and there I will meet with thee this is the meeting place this is where he sits this where he dwells and I will commune with thee from Above The Mercy Seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the Ark of the testimony of all things which I will give thee in Comm commment unto the children of Israel there's all these elements of the wood and the gold and the the ark which it is comprised of that and then the mer uh the tablets the law that's put inside there and all these different elements are speaking something about the totality of this place of dwelling this house of the Lord this Tabernacle and so in the scripture when it speaks of a tabernacle though there's different elements there's times when it's speaking very specifically about his Tabernacle where he dwells not an outer court or an inner court but in there in that I didn't even I didn't notice Asher was sitting there too I only called out Avio but Asher's on the front row too so God bless these young men so attentive and I apologize for the slight there to don't take it out on me later don't leave me a bad review on Google and and so he's saying that this this is where when he refers to time it's a specific place at times where God is dwelling there between the two cherubs where is this it's The Mercy Seat I come to judge the Earth and with righteous n and with equity and it says he sits between the cherubs where is he he's there above the ark above upon the mercy seat this is where he dwells this is where his Justice is going to go forth this is where his judgment's going to go forth but yet it's still a mercy seat and Psalms 89:14 it says justice and judgment are the habitation of thy Throne mercy and Truth Shall go before thy face the preparation the foundation of his throne of his reign of his rule of his power is Justice the foundation of his power is Judgment the justice and habitation are the Habit Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy Throne mercy and Truth Shall go before thy face this place of judgment must be just must be just must be TR right it must be true it cannot be Wicked but from this place of judgment it says mercy and truth will go forth What Goes Forth will not be unjust what goes un forth will not be unmerciful we need to catch that God cannot be unmerciful cuz he's full of mercy and and I know maybe again this is the Paradox that when God judges it's still there's still Mercy that's has been expressed so this Justice and judge are the habitation of his throne and maybe what we would expect to come forth is Judgment alone but it's mercy and truth that goes for forth from this place I read where it was said that God's principal characteristic or his principal glory is in Justice in equity mercy truthfulness and and faithfulness this is God's principal Glory it's this is what makes him who he is his truthfulness his faithfulness is justice as we read Wednesday night Proverbs 21:3 to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice we can just start making a list scripturally of what God accepts above sacrifice offerings and sacrifices I don't want that but but a body thou Hast prepared for me and a and to obey is better than sacrifice and here to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice this is something that is part of God's principal glory and one of the things that we labored to express on Wednesday night is that truth is associated with Justice and Truth is associated with Mercy in Isaiah 59:14 and judgment is turned away backward and Justice standeth a far off why is there no judgment why is there no justice for truth is Fallen truth has fallen in the street and Equity cannot enter where there is no truth there cannot be fairness and since fairness cannot enter there's no judgment or Justice right no justice no peace is what the the Mantra is but without truth there cannot be Justice unless you lift up truth and acknowledge truth and and and identify by truth you cannot have equity and without Equity there cannot be proper judgment without Equity there cannot be proper justice justice is as we read before or we said before truth in action and there is no virtue so truly great and Godlike as justice so this Justice this judgment is Christ it's going to judge the World by Jesus Christ and judgment and justice but mercy and Truth are met together in Christ in Christ if we could just use these as uh the two different ways that we want to express this judgment which we might think well judgment that's the the final sentence that's the punishment that's the repayment the reward for doing Wicked and then there's Mercy wherein there is some exemption from the Judgment but they both have to come from the same place we're not going to find Mercy outside of Jesus Christ you're not going to find judgment outside the word which is Christ but whether it be Mercy or whether it be judgment both are Equitable both are just both are right now as we've been looking at Luke 17:30 or Luke chapter 17 as it was in the days of lot and the days of Noah and Wednesday night we were looking specifically at Genesis Chapter 18 I want to jump right into this and hopefully go a little bit further in the days of lot we could recognize also in the days of Noah that it was a time of judgment and in the judging of Sodom and Gomorrah in in Genesis Chapter 18 there's judgment to Sodom but at the same time there's truth to Abraham at the very same time that God is with Abraham and communing with him and making himself known to him and even lingering back with Abraham there's judgment that's been investigated and judgment coming to Sodom so the Lord is revealing himself to Abraham in sending judgment to the valley not this one but to the Sodom and Gomorrah and as God is sending these angels down into Sodom to see whether or not the wickedness is so and what if they are doing wickedly and it the language is used to express that God is going to punish them for their wickedness but if it's not if it doesn't remain Wicked or it's not as it seems if they're not as they seem they appear to be just wholly Wicked but if they turn out to be righteous God wouldn't judge them so God tells Abraham that thing which he's going to do and Abraham expresses Mercy himself in the time of judgment it's not that God was going to be unmerciful but the reality of the time and the day and the moment brought something out of Abraham and in verse 23 of chapter 18 and Abraham Drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked so in what God had disclosed to him he understands and he's been taught he recognizes what's transpiring so he says per Adventure what if there's 50 righteous within the city will you destroy the whole city will you kill kill everyone and not spare the whole place for 50 righteous that are therein say if there's 50 could you just spare it all that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the Wicked This didn't offend God God didn't get all well since you say that take back my promise he's he likes the fact that there's something in Abraham that reflects this God who's rich in mercy God who is rich in Mercy says Abraham I'm going to destroy the valley and he's looking for something in Abraham and ab If Abraham said I knew it I knew I chose correct lot you got to come to you baby then that would have completely changed the whole picture but Abraham is instinctively saying no Lord this isn't like you to slay the righteous with the wicked and be the righteous and that the righteous should be as the wicked that that's far from thee and he says shall not the judge of all the Earth Do Right will not the judge of all the Earth do justice isn't his isn't his judgment and Justice based upon truth and because there's truth fairness and Equity can enter and because there that's the only way that you can have Justice and judgment he calls God to one of his uh essential characteristics he he's taking God at his word and holding God to his word and he is actually Abraham I want to use this very deliberately I want to use this phrase Abraham is interceding not that he can be the one that could pay the price oh I'll die for them not that he could be the one that could absolve them and make them righteous but he intercedes for those facing just judgment and in doing so he there's this element that he knew that Justice required warning that God's justice required truth first and that it would be the truth that could identify those whose Hearts were right that truth would be that which would call out the righteous and and something that is important to recognize with Abraham is that Abraham had received mercy and Abraham having received Mercy he gives Mercy Abraham perhaps was very aware of the fact that he was just one day lounging around in Babylon and God spoke to him he's like I was no different than all of my other Kinsmen I wasn't a better worshipper of God I didn't this wasn't something where I sought him and I was out looking for him because I knew there was a being greater than all these caldan deities no God just comes to him and he recognizes that was God being merciful to him and throughout his whole life and trajectory to this point in Genesis 18 we can say that Abraham recognizes even the prior events tell us that when he was able to go after these Kings and rescue his nephew God's always been gracious to him God has been merciful to him God has expanded his household so Abraham having received Mercy he gives mercy and brother brandham even uses the phrase in relation to in so much as you've given done unto the least of mine the least of these my own children uh you did it unto me and brother brandham said Mercy will be shown when mercy is given so when even when those who would not be elect extend a Mercy Mercy will be shown this response by Abraham is I I'll use this phrase was predicted by God in verse 19 and he says shall I hide this thing that I'm going to do from Abraham and he says for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which Heath spoken of him God had made a promise and he knew that Abraham would guide his household correctly he would command not just his children but those in his household to keep the way of the Lord and to keep the way of the Lord it was necessary to do justice and judgment these are part of God's ways these are attributes of God Justice and judgment so he knew that Abraham would teach this this nature of God that he would command his children to do justice and judgment and it was God who revealed these things to Abraham and if I can say taught Abraham showed him these things Abraham in response would teach his children and in this very image as this patriarch in this fatherly figure the first thing we see him do is interceding for those who may be ignorant or those that don't know that judgment is coming now I want you I want to read these next two passages in Psalms and in the book of James chapter 3 to highlight this aspect of God's mercy he says the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way so there's certain character and disposition that God is going to guide in judgment he's going to instruct them and help them in Discerning in deciding the meek will he teach his way so there's this meekness that's required uh to be taught and to be trained and to understand and to be led in judgment all the paths of the Lord are mer mercy and truth so this is the path of the Lord all his paths are mercy and Truth unto such as keep his Covenant and his testimonies where you see a lack of mercy and where you see a lie or you see untruthfulness that is not a path of the Lord and that is not the evidence of one who's keeping God's covenant in testimony now we could say that he that keeps God's covenant in testimonies will be uh lavishly uh it'll be poured out upon them abundantly this mercy and truth and that's true that if if you are keeping his word if you're obedient if you're humbling himself to his word and you keep his Covenant testimonies then all his ways for you are mercy and Truth mercy and truth and then as Mercy is given Mercy is shown for thy name's sake oh Lord now here's kind of the response for thy name's sake oh Lord pardon my iniquity for it is great what man is he that fearth the Lord the one that fears the Lord him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose God's going to teach you he's going to instruct you the meek will he guide in judgment he will teach him his way the one that fears the Lord will be taught the ways of the Lord his soul shall dwell at ease this is this peaceful Peaceable habitation here's this quiet rest that God will give the believer and his seed shall inherit the earth Jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth here's the seed of the meek that he guides and judgment the meek will he teach his way and the meek being taught the way will do as Abraham did he will command his children so his seed shall inherit the earth the secret I love this scripture just meditate on chew on it a little bit more because I'm just glossing the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him to those that fear the lord he will teach his way the secret Mysteries of the Lord the hidden things of God are with them that fear Him and He will show them his Covenant he's going to reveal the Deep things yay the hidden things he's going to open up the Mysteries the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him and He will show them his Covenant it is expressed even of that as a wife who reverences his husband there is a covenant the bride has a covenant with God that is a secret there are things that she knows she experiences and blessings that are poured upon on her that cannot be poured out upon anybody else because the wisdom of God is to her and to her alone because the secret of the Lord is to them that fear him and he shows her his Covenant and all the paths of the Lord are mercy and Truth unto to her and so there's a teaching there's an instructing in this way of judgment and mercy in James chapter 3: 13 to1 18 I'm reading a a larger portion of this to get the full context of what he saying who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works so there should be a life that is lived by one who claims to have wisdom and be endued with knowledge one of those things I think we could all uh admit that when it comes to accepting advice uh that we want to see that the person's kind of doing it themselves right could you imagine somebody's pedaling to you uh listen guys I I've never mentioned this before but I know an absolute sure cure for male P pattern boldness trust me on this right and you you when you plan on taking it right you go ahead first and then we'll and then we'll know whether or not This Thing Really Works and so there's something about a man's life his testimony his wife his children and I know that we we show grace even in those things that we're all growing and we're all learning but there's something to where you want to see a man who claims to have wisdom who claims to have knowledge you want to see his life demonstrate meekness of wisdom notice there is a meekness of wisdom there is and if I could even put it this way as we'll come to it one of the things that I've been studying in the scripture just myself is to find it is there's this thought that there is a there is a mercy that comes with wisdom and that wisdom necessarily carries with it some this element of wi of of Mercy wisdom must carry this element of mercy so that it it is in fact a wisdom and it says that let the man who says and claims to be a wise man endued with knowledge demonstrate a life that has the meekness of wisdom and he immediately begins to call out these characteristics that ought to be red flags but if you have bitter envy and and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth there's your coming back to Mercy and truth if you have nothing but lies you're incapable of Mercy I if if you if you're not seeking truth if you're not Discerning truth if you're not a lover of truth you're incapable of this kind of mercy and you're certainly incapable of Justice right this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish what a remarkable expression and that these things Rise Up from the earth and and it does not come from above but it's Earthly sensual and devilish and these very things that seem to be so closely related to human nature well what is Earthly sensual and devilish humans humans are and so this is the carnal nature and carnal wisdom and carnal thinking but the Bible said that there's going to be truth spring up out of the earth there's got to be vessels from which truth is going to spring up and it says that this wisdom descends not from above it's Earthly verse 16 for where envy and strife is there's confusion in every evil work as I've been studying in a sermon God rich in Mercy I believe it's in that place where he talks a lot about the chaos the chaos and confusion of things and the mercy of God where there's envy and in Strife it's chaos it's confusion in every evil work verse 17 but the wisdom which is from above this is Godly wisdom the wisdom that a man who's saying I'm wise and and I'm endued with knowledge from above he's going to demonstrate a life that has the meekness of this wisdom because the wisdom that is from above is first now we could read all these things and say well the wisdom from the above is gentle right so so that if there's ever wisdom that seems a little a little bit harsh and maybe punitive and corrective and it wants to um it wants to apply correction and maybe even if it would be you tell your children you're grounded or you spank a little one or something like that and say well that's clearly clearly not from above because that certainly wasn't gentle well it says it's first what is what is it what's the thing that ought to be now I'm just stepping on everyone's toes including my own what's the first instinct that should rise up in a moment of judgment what's the first instinct that would want to have in a time when you see something's incorrect or you're trying to make a decision our first instinct should be cut off the head right if if we were granted our first decision we'd be the only ones driving to work tomorrow morning like ah don't have to worry about traffic don't have to worry about anybody and you'd show up you'd have no job why because you cursed your boss right you have no co-workers at all why because you said I hope they meet an untimely end right your first instinct but he said that this wisdom is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy there there's your Justice there's your Equity there's when we were reading how uh Joseph Addison said Justice is blind because it cannot favor Kindred it cannot favor uh Associates it's got to be blind it goes by truth alone it's first pure and I'd like to say that part of this initial first fruits is that it's full of mercy and good fruits and the fruit of righteousness this Justice is sown in peace of them that make peace if we just took the word righteousness which uh I I hope we can see later that righteousness is connected with Mercy just this it's it's a it's a part of righteousness that's just inherent in it but the fruit of righteousness if we change that word righteousness to Justice the fruit of Justice correctness the just fruit of righteousness and Justice is sown in peace maybe it is no justice no peace fruit of righteous is swn in peace of them that make peace this is what Abraham was demonstrating this wisdom which was from Above This wisdom which was first uh seeking peace first seeking some exemption from judgment and it wasn't that the right the the wicked were being exempt but for the sake of the righteous so it wasn't that Abraham and I'll try to get into this maybe a little bit more on Wednesday or next Sunday on how righteous judgment and showing Mercy is not false discernment showing Mercy isn't like say looking at someone who is indeed guilty of adultery and saying well that's not really adultery is it right that that's not Mercy that's not truthful that that's not fair that's that's inequitable there's something wrong in that process and so showing Mercy isn't calling things wrong right you follow me we can't we can't uh get this wrong idea and concept of what Mercy is and so when Abraham interceded and when he stood up to to to call for God's uh to call for God's mercy or his Justice he said this isn't like you to destroy everybody he wasn't saying that the wicked didn't deserve it but he's saying certainly the righteous don't and he was saying why not spare the wicked for the sake of the the the righteous and exempt the wicked for the sake of the righteous because it wouldn't be fair that they would die and now let me transition to and I'm grateful that I have the time to get through this hopefully the time that we're living in right now Abraham was living in a time when the son of man was revealing himself to him judgment was going to come and fall upon those in Sodom and Gomorrah and we are living in the day when the son of man is being revealed and in this day judgment comes and mercy it's the part I want you to recognize that this this Mercy is I I think there is an aspect that's worth looking at to understand that if Mercy's over what does that mean so if I'm expressing and emphasizing the fact that I believe that there's still Mercy it's not done to try to correct in any way what brother bam said about Mercy being over but it's to understand according to the message of the hour what that meant I mean what what what was it that he's looking at so plainly for him to think could everybody be lost now in the sermon the Third Exodus and I think the dates of these that when he preaches this sermon is quite remarkable just to look at the progression of things that were happening in that that summer of 1963 in June 30th in the morning uh he's preaching the Third Exodus I'm realizing now there was uh a statement that I had from the sermon that he preached that evening uh that I took out of my notes but there's just this emphasis he has on that day he says we are in an exodus and leaving and turning the tapes off in a moment oh my friends my brothers both present and that will hear the tapes let me as your brother and a citizen of the kingdom of God now I know my me expressing this takes away a little bit of the the weight and the emphasis so I trust that you're listening to these things and reading these things yourself but it it might take away the sound and the urgency in brother Brandon's voice he says come out in this Exodus for all that's left behind will bear The Mark of the Beast come out of Babylon come out of this confusion come out of these systems and serve the Living God this great Ang Angel of the Covenant Jesus Christ in the form of God thought it not robbery but became equal with God now he's a pillar of fire in the same form that he was back there bringing that first Exodus bringing the second Exodus and here he is with the Third Exodus remember this important third here he is with us in the Third Exodus and he said come out of these systems come out of Babylon now let's pause for a moment and let's just say well these systems these denominations why is he calling them out of them now whether maybe just as a I wonder whether I should POS it as a question so I'll just say it as a statement there have been Believers in all ages in denominations right and there's believers who died in their Church their organized Church who believed the word for their day who accepted the gospel as it was preached to them but now there comes this really harsh message and this really Stern warning you've got to come out of it you've got to come out of these systems the first Exodus what did he do he brought them out of a natural land to a natural land the second Exodus he brought them out of a spiritual condition into a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost now he is bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost right back into the Eternal land of the Millennium and the great Hereafter this is where we're this is what we're headed to next same Pillar of Fire by the same anointed system the same God doing the same things and the same word declared the first one declared the second one the same word declared the second one has declared the third one and here we see it Among Us The Exodus come out oh come out of this chaos this is a very clear delineation from things that have been to where now you've got to come out of this because now there's an exodus at one time that that Israel was serving God in the temple and worshiping and praising the Lord and and and there was a they had been in their Exodus they were in their promised land and all of a sudden it's like well we're here we're fine right it's like no now I want to take you a step higher now I want to take you out of the spiritual condition of being sinful into the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost and that was a time of Exodus the one who had baptized him with fire was there among them brother B said the same ones happening same things happening now come out oh come out of this chaos come to the Living God come to the word the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and now he's in our flesh dwell Among Us come out and serve the Living God I would say that there is none on Earth that can say it quite the way that he was saying it with the intensity and the urgency because he was anointed scripturally as a voice to call us out of Babylon Revelations 18:4 to6 says and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues this is a this is this is The Exodus that there's going to be plagues there's going to be judgments there's going to be curses and he said you've got to come out of her that you not receive that which she's going to be rewarded with for her sins have reached unto heaven and God ha remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you Mercy given Mercy shown he's going to remember her iniquities well where's the justice and where's the righteousness and where's the loving God full of compassion reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled to her double God standing there in the Third Exodus saying that there's nothing left for judgment in these systems get out of them there's no life he told us there's no life in denominations that's a very harsh statement but that's that's the sum of what he's saying about denominations there's no life in there they cannot bring forth they only bring forth stebo children they only bring forth a a hybrid nature so he says come out of her my people the plagues are going to fall her sins are abounding come out brother B says we're in an exodus and the same God that declared the first declared the second he's declaring it now in that first Exodus let I check my scripture here for a second in Exodus 34: 5 to9 says and the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed now this is God showing himself to Moses and in Exodus chapter 3 it says the Lord himself had descended and appeared to Moses said I am come down to deliver this is the god in The Exodus he comes down to deliver to take them forth says the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with them there and proclaimed the name of the Lord the Lord passed by before him proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and Truth keeping Mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin when God describes himself he's first merciful gracious longsuffering abundant in goodness which can be Mercy in places and Truth keeping Mercy for thousands forgiven iniquity and transgression and sin this is God even being merciful to them in the Exodus God coming down he's first gracious and merciful to Israel he's going to make himself known he's sending them a prophet he's give tell giving them a confirmation he's going to come out there's going to be plagues there's going to be things that are taking place but it's all for the purpose of bringing them out of Egypt and into the promised land and then God in this mid sentences says and that will by no means clear the guilty amen visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the children's children to the third and to the fourth generation God is first merciful but he says that my Mercy is not without Justice am if there's maybe I could say it this way have you ever driven by a dry cleaner that says 20% off and it's like written on the window and you're like 20% off of what it's always 20% off so in other words the price is the price and they're just telling you it's 20% off and you go and say how much it's like $1.99 he's like well do I get the 20% off it's like that is the 20% off I've been coming here for 30 years you know right it's like I've never never seen a deduction of 20% it's only gone up and so if there's not and so there's is there 20% off if that's just what the price is and so is there Mercy if there's no punishment it's like well the soul that sinth enter into the joy of the Lord and they say enter in the J oh you're so merciful well no there's no punishment for it no consequence so God is saying I'm first merciful gracious loving I have this long suffering abundant in goodness and truth I keep Mercy for thousands I forgive iniquity and transgressions and sins he says but that will no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity so I can forgive the iniquity and the transgressions but there's not a clearing of this guilt and I will visit iniquity there's something to say that my Justice requires Mercy but it also requires judgment amen it says and Moses made haste and bowed his head toward the Earth and worshiped so Moses was picking up what he was laying down he said if now I have found Grace in thy sight oh Lord let my Lord I pray thee go Among Us for it is a stiff necked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance possess us for yourself separate us out amen Mark us out from everyone else Lord be merciful unto us be gracious and it begins with this acknowledgement that we have sinned and that we are full of iniquity and we're stiff necked and rebellious he said I this is what his response is to this God he descended in the cloud and this meeting with Moses he said I am come down to deliver you to take you out of this land in that Exodus there was a leaving of Egypt through signs and wonders and plagues upon the unbelieving and he's bringing them out and Moses saying Lord pardon us have mercy on us take us for your possession separate us out very important characteristic of the taking and the and the calling forward and the separating out of the redeemed and how that he is gathering gather your possession to yourself now brother Brandon preached the Third Exodus there on June 30th 1963 and then on July 7th he preaches the indictment and at the beginning he uses the third basis or excuse me he uses the Third Exodus I played third Bas that was the reason for that slip uh he uses the Third Exodus as the basis for Christ them being indicted for uh rejecting Christ today the very beginning of the sermon in this Third Exodus and because we're in this Third Exodus because God is Among Us now calling us out of chaos he's using that as the basis for an indictment for rejecting Christ today and I would encourage you I I've been putting it together I may share it with you but I would encourage you to go watch the the sermon titles after the seals are open and I may have quickly referenced this before but you find that brother Bram doing a lot of warning inditing preaches the trial right there's things that he's doing and it's almost as if there's this sequential order through the litigation process of bringing us to a place to where now the judge is here and he's giving warning then he's given the indictment for rejecting and there's going to be a trial and so that's the time we're living in right now these are the things that's unfolding in the word of God I would say it's these things is one of the reasons why I believe it is so wonderful that God preserved for us the message of the hour amen and that we can go into it for ourselves and we can read it and it's not just one tape that's saved and it's not just one little quote in a golden nuggets book over here but we can take it and study it out for ourselves and see the totality of what the voice of God is declaring to us and brother brandham says in the indictment they did it because they didn't know who he was They Crucified him in his first coming because they didn't know who he was they didn't know that the Vindication of God's word was standing up in that day now it was it one day and that was right now we understand that in this sermon he's saying that they were worshiping under the law and it was right up until a critical moment absolutely right Jerusalem was in effect the law the ordinances the Commandments were all right and you could be absolutely Justified before God by keeping those Commandments until the time came that Christ is crucified and the the the temple and the Tabernacles exposed as not having the presence of God in there anymore there's no mercy seat but there's Christ hanging on the cross outside of the gates as the perpetuation as The Mercy Seat in plain view so he's saying at one time that was right it was it one day just keep them laws and things but the same laws that was they were keeping pointed them to a time that he would come and be this man that he was supposed to be notice how these things are even forward looking pointing to a day they had this part but did take the other part and that's the same thing they're doing now they got a church and they believe in Jesus Christ and say they do in things but deny the hour we're living in still brings the old proverb back again man always praising God for what he has done looking forward what he do and will do and ignoring what he's doing and being condemned by it so God's doing something there he is you're what you're doing before was okay and God was showing Mercy to you in that but now this pointed to this time and this day and here's where you'll find his Mercy but if you don't move you're condemned they think God is wonderful how great he is what he's doing going to do he's going to come and be a Rapture someday and go home and and denying the very signs and wonders right there at the time that the scripture says that he will be doing it Miss the whole thing denying the word denying the day denying the time there's a unfolding in these sermons as brother braham's preaching them you see this this message of the Third Exodus come out come out come out Christ is calling us out of these things and then he brings this indictment what's the indictment for not coming out in Malachi 4: 1-6 I think it's important that we recognize these aspects of this chapter for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of host that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch there's going to be a burning of those that are gathered together this bundling together denominations and all these harlots they're going to be burned and at the very same time it presents this picture but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts now this is quite a a representation this is quite an image that's being put before us the son of righteousness shall rise with healing in his wings there's going to be a day when there's going to be a burning and the wicked are going to be burned to stubble and they're going to be completely burned up but the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings for those that fear Him to those that fear me will I show them my secret Covenant to those that fear me will I teach them in judgment to those that fear me will I guide them it's the son of Justice the son of righteousness the Su n of righteousness is the s n of Justice he brings truth he brings healing you'll find over and over and over again where there's healing there's Mercy in order to have healing there must be mercy so he brings healing and what it happens at this time that truth comes it results in judgment J ment and burning to some but healing or Mercy to others it you'll find that this righteousness is connected with Mercy it's tied to Mercy Proverbs 21:21 he that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life righteousness and honor he that follows after righteousness and mercy finds life amen we can't just try to follow after Justice and judgment well it's in the word isn't it Jesus even says you've left off you've you've left off the weigh your matters of the law of justice and mercy he says you you ought to do both yeah do all these things and and the details that's great that's wonderful the minutia of things that's wonderful but if you leave off the nature and character of these other things that's not the right thing and in this time of judgment the day that comes that will burn the reason why he says but unto you that fear my name there's going to be a burning come and unto you that fear my name the Sun will arise it is the rising of the sun it's going to come in Revelations 10:1 the mighty Angel his face was as it were the sun Revelations 10:1 the mighty Angel descends to Earth the Lord descending to Earth this Mighty Angel even according to Mark chapter 9 Matthew 17 this is the Lord Brother Bram said the seventh angel is on Earth at the time of this coming the seventh angel of Revelations 10:7 brother brandham says in the church age book Mo very very explicitly is the same Elijah in Malachi 4:5 so the son of righteousness arises with healing in his wings where's that healing it's in that word it's in that open book and so it says remember ye verse four brother John you may need to go back remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in horb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He Shall shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of lot when judgment is impending and there's going to be a burning up I will send the son of righteousness with healing in his wings but I'm not just going to send the son of righteousness there will be an Elijah that will forun there will be an angel Messenger on Earth and he will be the one that's going to point us to Christ am amen it's a time of judgment but it's a time of Mercy I I'm not sure what your experience may be I do know that there's some that actually uh hold somewhat closely to the teachings of the message would even identify themselves as message Believers and message ministers that very adamant that there is no more Mercy that the door of Salvation has been shut and even in doing so they're condemning their own loved ones but it's what they see in in the message and the very adamant very strong and harsh about it a very matter of fact about it and I could say that in some way to me I think that we ought not to water down the Judgment aspect of the time we're living in Brother The Razor's Edge we've been brought to the the the truth the line that has been drawn and this is the truth and come out of her and this is the word and you stay with what's been preached and I just think that we can't not get be guilty of watering down the urgency of the time in the hour that we're living in come on but I believe that if we can fully appreciate what's transpired in the day and age that we're living in and we can see that God is here in in his word in the bride and and he's calling us out he says that he's he's he he's here amongst us and and we're being called out of Babylon we're being called out of denominations I just feel there's so much I'd like to express about the message of the hour that's bundling denominations and he's calling judgment upon and even see judgment is striking during the time of brother br's Ministry and there's this urgency and it shakes us to our people even though my my own my parents and their friends and even a lot of people that we would know to this day and and Flagstaff and everyone were there in California listening to choosing of a bride and what they do they left they absolutely left California why they believed in the urgency of the message of the hour fellowship with Brother Joseph and he's going to be driving to Virginia in the next week or so and I said man you've got to go to the Pacific Ocean so you can go all the way and visit the Atlantic Ocean you could do it all in the same month and La was suggested as a possibility there's some good burgers there and good food and everything he's like would we really want to go to the place that's going to sink in the bottom of the ocean I say you know what there's some appreciation of the fact that it's very real what the prophet taught that there's consequences for not being sensitive to the word of God and so I would not want to in any way water down judgment and justice Justice and truth but listen to brother Brandon when he preaches the God of this evil age now there is a sermon to really burn hide right just let them and when it gets down to the end brother bradam say fire fall burn them all and here he is praying at the end dear Jesus don't let one of them be lost as your servant that stands between the living and the dead poting them with the finger to the word of God this no notice what he's doing preaches the God of this evil age he's identifying hell is on Earth it's going that the judgments have they've already been marked for judgment he's already felt the urgency of the Fulfillment of the word of God in this last day of Revelations 55 Revelations 10:1 Luke 17:30 the coming of the son of man the revealing of the son of man these things are have so shaken him that he's very he's very deliberate in what he's saying he's also very careful not to say too much and he recognizes the time that we're living in he's overwhelmed with this as your servant that stands between the living and dead pointing them with the finger to the word of the Lord he's saying Lord don't let them be lost I cannot save them Lord but they want to be saved and father as I have said many times the sun rises in the morning and it comes up across the Earth it's sent by God to ripen the grain to make natural food for natural living but oh God you said to them that fear his name shall the son of righteousness rise with heal in his wings let the son of righteousness the word of God rise in the hearts of the people and the healing rise of faith in that word cure every disobedient to the word and bring them to the fullness of the Sons and Daughters of God and you shall go forth amen and and and and grow as calves in the stone you shall grow up you go forth and grow up in the son of rightous let it now rise in the hearts of the people with healing raise this is the day this is the time that we're living in there's brother brandham standing there even as an Abraham saying oh Lord don't condemn them all don't Lord don't let any one of them be lost Psalms 9: 7 and9 but the Lord shall endure forever his Mercy shall endure Forever The Truth Shall endure forever these things that his righteousness will endure forever why because the Lord will endure forever he hath prepared preped his throne for judgment and the judgy said yeah and he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall Minister judgment to the people in uprightness it's kind of a it's a real some heavy tones there but I think we know enough already to know that he's prepared his throne for judgment because it's the preparation of it the foundation of his Justice it is Judgment he's going to judge the world in righteousness he's not going to judge us in unrighteousness he's going to minister judgment to the People In fairness and uprightness and Equity this is what God must do and as a part of that verse 9 the Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed and a refuge in times of trouble what Mercy what glorious Grace that's being expressed a refuge that's a secure high place inaccessibly high is the word that it's being rooted in that's uh he's going to give him a refuge it's inaccessibly high it's a stronghold for the broken God having pity having Mercy on the broken and we who are broken we've sinned our Brokenness is as a result of sin it's been our own stiff neck Rebellion there's things that we've done but yet the Lord will be a refuge for the oppressed he will be a hiding place for those who find themselves in trouble in this time of judgment and it's very fiery round about the Lord he's revealing himself as a wigged one as a lion he'll still be a refuge for the broken in Isaiah 2 1:2 we were reading these about the book being open and the eyes of the blind being open the tongue of the stammer being loose to speak plainly a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert from The Tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land amen remember we ministered on these very same principles in the very beginning on a place by him there's this place that we can have I can't remember exactly maybe even what the title was but it was spec specifying this place he's going to be a covert a secret place of protection the one provided place of Mercy at a time of reigning and righteousness a time of ruling in judgment a man is going to be a hiding place a covert the shadow of a great rock in a weary land brother brandham uses this scripture Psalms 27 when he preaches the Rapture his text is Psalms 27 1:5 and what does he say I'm not going to go down Main Avenue I know a lot of people are thinking Main Street but I'm going to go to a prophecy of it and he says for in the time of trouble he reads this verse 5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion the Lord will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up Upon a rck now I would love to go into a little bit more detail on this but I want you to ponder the image that David is just painted enemies surround him they threaten him even if the walls were being sieged and all of Jerusalem is being compassed what David is saying is if I have to retreat pass the outer Court past the inner Court he will take me into the very secret of his t Tabernacle and hide me the secret of his presence where was his presence between the cherubs he's not just saying in the temple you know looking out the door out in the outer Court you everybody fist bumping there said I think we're going to be safe no he said I want to go all the way in He Shall Set me upon a rock what is it that they believed maybe they knew and experienced then is that in the temple the very Ark was set upon the rock of Creation The Creation Stone the foundation stone David's not just talking about going to church David is not just talking about the glory of the Lord filling all the temple and the outer court and the inner Court David is talking about God bringing him all the way into the holiest of holies and allowing him his protection if all else fails I know that the Lord will hide me between the cherubims he'll hide me upon the mercy seat in a time of trouble in Exodus God said to Moses just in the chapter before he said that he had descended said I'm keeping Mercy for thousands and he expressed these things to Moses he said there's a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and this was in response to Moses saying Show Me Your Glory and God said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I'll be gracious and will show Mercy on whom I will show Mercy where does he where does he where does does he show it in the place by him in that place upon a rock I believe there's room for mercy in this hour as a matter of fact I believe there's a place full of it not just not just room like well can we fit anything else in there well I think we can just shove a little Mercy in there no there's a place full of it a place that it's very characteristic is called The Mercy Seat the throne room the presence of God where he dwells brother BR preaches a sermon God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him I'm going to close on this lengthy quote I've provided it for you in the slides July 24th 1963 think of this he's preached the indictment he's going to preach the trial and he's saying I'm not going to judge without first warning these things are all coming down you know you familiar with criminal law enough to know I mean hopefully from an educational standpoint right I'm asking for a friend but in criminal law an indictment precedes trial and an indictment is like the formal charges there could be investigations but when you when you see this indictment that means you're being charged you're going to have to face uh uh you're going to have to face these charges that you're going to go through a process of of litigation and maybe stand trial so brother brandham even in the way that he's preaching this it makes a lot of sense in terms of uh of how we're living in this time and in this hour so he's saiding God doesn't call him into judgment without first warning him this is the very characteristic that brother that Abraham identified like what if there's ignorant people down there in Sodom who don't know better and would and would receive your word and would receive your truth that would make them righteous and then God listen brother says I'm just jumping right in the middle of it because it's this image of Genesis 18 I was going to use on Wednesday I believe he says but then God confirms that message that Billy G Graham preaches God heals the Sick by Oral Robert's prayers and God produces the things that proves that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and it's calling those things that it's messages of the hour and one of those messages is calling repent or perish that's right repent or perish there's no hopes it's all gone world's warned of his coming each one of the messages speaks and warns of the coming to Lord Jesus both to the church denominal remember God's always in threes like Father Son and Holy Ghost and justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and so forth he's in threes now God is that message of repentance to the church nominal God's in the message of Divine Healing to the church Pentecostal God's in the message to the bride so we find out that all of them calling one to this this to that that to that God calling to the church out of the world calling the church in the denom in the denomination Church into Pentecost and calling the bride out of Pentecost like Luther Wesley and now it's just all perfectly typed up and there's no mistake about it I've hit all around the ends of it in sides of it and inside and outside and shows it by scripture the chronology of it till we know that it's absolutely the truth there's no mistakes Sunday I hope that God Sunday I hope that God sinks it in so deep that you'll never be able to get away from it now notice he says Sunday not Sunday Sunday guess what he preaches the next Sunday yeah it it worked Christ is a mystery God revealed now you now you see what he's looking at he starts talking about in Christ's mystery of God revealed what he's saying what is this headship vindicating what is it showing what's taking place what is this Union what what's what's transpiring that we're living in so he says I hope next Sunday it'll sink in so deep you'll never get away from it thank you Lord breaking into things that the the the brother Ram says when he preaches the seventh seal he said these things this happened this happened he said the third was unknown he said he not revealed he said but it's moving into that cycle that silence is being lifted now as brother B goes forward in preaching the word of God taking Christ as the mystery of God revealed what is he preaching to us the seventh seal which is Christ he says in the very next statement he says so I I hope you get you go so deep you'll never get away from it and then he says now god- giving warning prepare for a judgment the atomic bombs are in the hangers everything's set and ready and God before he can let this happen this thing happen he makes a call down through like he did in Sodom come out of it get ready there's something going to happen like in the days of Noah before God sent the waters to destroy the world in the great anti livian world that had come off into sin as Jesus clearly said that it was in that day just like this as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man and how that the women on the Rampage and marrying and giving and marriage and the great scientific achievements and the smart educated going into the intellectual side and the little humble flock sitting off to one side waiting the pending judgment and the escape and before God sent that judgment he sent a prophet just like he did to Hezekiah he said get ready for the judgments are ready to fall and he made the people ready for the time Noah made the people ready and it was a call of Mercy before judgment amen I'll read the statement maybe in the next couple services but I encourage you to go listen to it we're going to have an anniversary of it 60 years next uh in January preached it right here IA was doing time looking at The Westward Ho Hotel where he spoke it at and in one stretch Richard Nixon pre uh preached well maybe he did Richard Nixon spoke I think Kennedy spoke then brother brandham spoke and then after that Ronald Reagan spoke for all the Republicans and it all these things happen and it's actually there in the wiked edia paid God bless whoever edited it to include brother brandham in that list of speakers but it's there he preaches God rich in Mercy and he says oh if God would just raise up a prophet and what he's expressing he says before God would send judgment he sent a Prophet this is what God does before he sends judgment he sents the prophet and the prophet is the one that gives a call for Mercy he's the one that says it's a call of Mercy before judgment and I believe if the bride under her messenger is going to be the final voice to the final age we're not going to be rageing Maniacs with fist clinch and teeth grit saying judge them all God just judge them all all these and homosexuals burn them up there's going to be a call for Mercy before judgment oh God help us let's bow our heads in a word of prayer musicians come feel free to stand with me let's pray
