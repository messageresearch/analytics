[0:04] Romans 43 and4 reads like this for what
[0:08] saith the scripture Abraham believed
[0:11] God and it was counted unto him for
[0:15] righteousness now to him that worketh is
[0:18] the reward not reckoned of Grace but of
[0:24] debt amen this evening we want to speak
[0:27] about good success
[0:31] and you think where where would this tie
[0:34] in but I pray that you'll you'll see
[0:36] that here shortly good success and I
[0:40] wonder if we could just bow our heads
[0:42] for a word of prayer precious Heavenly
[0:45] Father Lord we uh deem it a great honor
[0:49] Lord to be able to address Your Blood
[0:53] Washed bride and Lord to uh be able to
[0:58] just count ourselves one of them and a
[1:01] child of God lord
[1:04] it's I'm humbled and I'm honored Lord
[1:08] Lord we just pray that as your presence
[1:11] is already
[1:12] here that Lord you'll begin to minister
[1:15] to our needs that as we each by faith
[1:19] hold our needs before your Great and
[1:21] Mighty presence that Lord as the word of
[1:24] God is now ministered and the truth
[1:28] to this great Eternal Word that's been
[1:31] pinned down Lord we pray that your
[1:34] spirit would have preeminence and
[1:36] freedom Lord to move about the aisles
[1:39] and Lord minister to each of the needs
[1:41] in every individual heart and I pray
[1:44] that Lord God you would do the
[1:46] supernatural that thing that which only
[1:49] you can do and that would be to answer
[1:52] those needs that would not be known to a
[1:55] man but only before you God and I pray
[1:59] that Lord as the the word of God sets us
[2:01] free as Lord we have sung these songs of
[2:04] Zion and as your presence comes near
[2:07] Lord we would be uh set free to receive
[2:11] Lord your promises and Lord to Worship
[2:14] You freely for it we ask that you would
[2:18] uh just have your way tonight in our
[2:21] hearts and our lives for we ask it in
[2:23] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[2:27] you you can be seated
[2:38] in Romans chapter 5 and brothers I've
[2:40] got a little bit of a a ringing up here
[2:42] I don't okay you can hear that good
[2:45] Romans chapter 5 and verse
[2:48] 17 it says for If by one man's offense
[2:53] death reigned by one much more they
[2:57] which receive abundance of Grace Grace
[3:01] and of the gift of
[3:03] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[3:07] Jesus
[3:10] Christ we have
[3:12] a uh an employee Bible study that I that
[3:16] I we have in my home every week
[3:20] and we've been going through we last
[3:22] year went through the book of Hebrews
[3:24] and this year we're going through the
[3:25] book of Romans and We Came Upon This
[3:28] this scripture and I I I as often do I
[3:31] read right over it this Romans chapter 5
[3:36] verse 17 and somebody just pointed it
[3:38] out and said that's an interesting
[3:40] statement the gift of
[3:44] righteousness and I thought why is that
[3:47] such a strange
[3:48] statement and as we got
[3:51] into uh discussing the just
[3:55] righteousness in itself it it opened up
[3:59] uh a
[4:00] a great
[4:02] discussion and as we began to look at
[4:04] righteousness and as we took this
[4:08] scripture in
[4:10] Romans 4 and: 3 and 4 we notice
[4:15] that where it says for what sayith the
[4:18] scripture he Abraham believed God and it
[4:20] was counted unto him for
[4:24] righteousness now to him that worketh is
[4:27] the reward not reckoned of Grace but of
[4:30] debt and this counted and reckoned are
[4:33] the same
[4:34] word and when you uh go through your
[4:38] your your Bible and you read your your
[4:40] your margins and you you look at the
[4:41] footnotes this word reckoned and and
[4:44] counted is the same as imputed and so
[4:48] when you begin tying these words
[4:49] together and you start picking up all
[4:52] these other scriptures that talk about
[4:54] how that sin was not imputed unto this
[4:57] one and how that that that righteousness
[4:59] wasn't imputed to him for believing and
[5:02] we we we we see this that that as
[5:05] Abraham simply believed God it was
[5:08] reckoned unto him for
[5:12] righteousness
[5:14] and we thought this is this is really
[5:17] interesting this this idea of of
[5:19] righteousness where is this Reckoning
[5:23] this word Reckoning where does this come
[5:25] from this imputation or this Reckoning
[5:28] and it takes you back into the Book of
[5:31] Leviticus chapter
[5:34] 25 and I want to read a portion of this
[5:37] for you it says after that he is sold
[5:40] now what this is discussing is that a
[5:44] man an
[5:45] Israelite there was a law that was given
[5:48] throughout the land and and and this law
[5:52] was that if a man that was given a
[5:56] portion of land the Promised Land if he
[6:00] was to fall on hard times if he was to
[6:03] uh uh his life was to go a direction he
[6:06] wouldn't desire it to
[6:08] go he could begin to sell his
[6:11] possessions in order to have h a means
[6:15] of living well if it got so bad he
[6:19] wouldn't just sell off his possessions
[6:21] his animals and the things he owned he
[6:23] would begin selling off his
[6:26] land and then if it got in even worse he
[6:30] could sell himself into
[6:33] bondage but with all of the things that
[6:35] he sold whether it be his stuff his land
[6:38] or himself there was a law that was put
[6:41] into place that that that that he he it
[6:46] was always his it was always his and
[6:51] that after a jubilee year which was
[6:55] every 50 years right whether he was to
[6:58] have the money to purchase it back
[7:00] before then or not when that Jubilee
[7:03] trumpet sounded he was set free and all
[7:06] of his possessions had to be returned to
[7:08] him right and if he had sold himself
[7:12] into bondage then he was free he was a
[7:16] free man and and it was wonderful
[7:18] because that Jubilee year it was a whole
[7:20] year of of freedom and no work and we
[7:24] all like that and we're wondering when
[7:26] is they when are they going to
[7:27] reintroduce the Jubilee year tired of
[7:30] you know just student debt being written
[7:33] off we want a whole year written off
[7:36] and but what's so beautiful about this
[7:39] now this Reckoning is this and and and
[7:43] and many of the commentators they they
[7:47] recognize it and even scoffield will put
[7:49] it in his notes and and many many of
[7:52] these men have have caught it and put it
[7:54] in their
[7:55] notes the Reckoning part is this
[8:01] imagine it was you or or a family
[8:06] member that had sold their land we'll
[8:09] just we'll we won't even look at they
[8:11] sold thems but they sold their
[8:14] land and if you in your mind are going
[8:17] no no no I want it I want it in my mind
[8:19] I want them to have sold themselves
[8:20] that's fine so your your cousin your
[8:23] uncle your your close brother sold
[8:26] themselves into bondage
[8:30] the way the price was
[8:32] figured of how much that person would be
[8:35] sold for was always reckoned to the Year
[8:40] of Jubilee so had they Fallen had they
[8:43] fallen on Hard Times in year 40 they
[8:46] only had the price that was to be paid
[8:48] was only for the rest of the 10 years
[8:51] that was all the person was going to pay
[8:53] cuz they said if they were buying the
[8:54] land they said look I'm only going to
[8:56] get 10 years worth of harvest off this
[8:59] land I'll pay this much for it
[9:03] now the beautiful thing is is if a
[9:05] person sold themselves into bondage you
[9:07] could pay your way out you could pay
[9:09] your own way out if you like if you
[9:11] desired but if you didn't have the means
[9:14] to do it the person that the only person
[9:17] that could do it was a Kinsman right A
[9:20] near Kinsman right so somebody out that
[9:25] doesn't follow the laws of your land
[9:27] somebody in a foreign country could not
[9:29] come and say hey I'd like to pay the
[9:30] price they say no no no no no unless
[9:32] you're playing by these rules you don't
[9:34] get to
[9:36] play they had to be able to recognize
[9:39] the year Year of Jubilee and how that
[9:42] the pricing was uh was figured in all of
[9:46] this
[9:48] now if a near Kinsman saw their near
[9:53] Kinsman in bondage and said I can't know
[9:56] I can't see it I don't want it I won't
[9:58] allow it
[10:01] and he said I'm going to go pay I want
[10:03] to go pay the the the price to set my K
[10:07] my near Kinsman
[10:09] free when they would pay that price
[10:12] whatever it is and whatever that was
[10:14] whether it would be the land or the
[10:15] person or the stuff if it' be the person
[10:18] let's imagine it was the person and they
[10:21] paid the price that person was free
[10:26] right then and there not to serve their
[10:31] near Kinsmen they were free amen that
[10:35] the Kinsmen that paid the price paid it
[10:38] not so that they could get the credit
[10:40] not so that they could own that person
[10:43] but they set them free totally free for
[10:46] their
[10:48] sake for
[10:52] them and what's
[10:55] even what what what's better is that
[10:58] perhaps that person who was in bondage
[11:01] let's say they had 10 years left worth
[11:04] of until the Jubilee and every day was a
[11:08] grind and every month was a grind every
[11:12] year was a grind but but they were
[11:15] always looking how many 10 years 10
[11:18] years to Jubilee till
[11:21] Jubilee but if a ker Kinsman came and
[11:25] paid that price
[11:29] those people had their Jubilee right
[11:31] then and there they didn't have to wait
[11:34] 10 years to be set free they didn't have
[11:37] to wait till the end of the 10 years to
[11:40] tell their relative oh now I'm free no
[11:44] as soon as that price was paid that was
[11:46] a jubilee to them they were
[11:52] free now the Reckoning is this the
[11:57] Reckoning is for the person who's who is
[12:00] the near
[12:01] Kinsman what he is doing is he's paying
[12:04] the price and that price of freedom is
[12:09] reckoned unto the man in
[12:12] bondage that freedom is is reckoned to
[12:16] them like the Year of Jubilee is right
[12:19] now it's reckoned as though this is that
[12:22] year right now
[12:35] and I I I'm going back brother John I'm
[12:37] I'm I'm just going back to this Romans
[12:40] chap 4 and veres 3 and 4 when it says
[12:43] that what sayith the scripture Abraham
[12:47] believed
[12:49] God and it was counted or reckoned unto
[12:54] him for
[12:57] righteousness now to him that
[13:00] worketh to him that would pay his own
[13:03] debt would work work hard enough to pay
[13:06] off his own debt the reward is not
[13:10] reckoned of Grace but of
[13:14] debt but if the near Kinsman came and
[13:18] paid that
[13:20] price it's just by
[13:24] Grace that's just
[13:27] Grace what's so
[13:30] beautiful and and this is where we begin
[13:33] rejoicing in in the thought of this uh
[13:37] kinsman
[13:39] redeemer is that we are
[13:42] looking for this
[13:44] restoration this this returning back to
[13:48] the state of
[13:49] Eden going back to this and the idea the
[13:53] reason that we're looking for that is
[13:55] because what was lost in the
[14:00] garden was what was was given to man was
[14:05] was given in the very beginning by God
[14:08] to man to have
[14:11] dominion but man lost that Dominion man
[14:15] fell and lost that
[14:17] dominion and we're Desiring to have that
[14:20] Dominion back now this is what that what
[14:25] really got me excited was so many times
[14:28] we feel that the the Kinsmen redeeming
[14:31] part the part that we love so much and
[14:34] is when we look at the story of Boaz and
[14:36] Ruth it's it's the clearest picture we
[14:38] have probably in the Bible of a kinsman
[14:43] redeemer and the the the thought is so
[14:46] beautiful to think that that Boaz loved
[14:49] Ruth so much that he paid uh for
[14:54] Naomi and and the and and by paying uh
[14:58] for what the the restoration for all of
[15:01] Naomi's Goods since she had left that
[15:04] land he got Ruth as part of the deal and
[15:08] we love that and and we and and the
[15:10] imagery is so beautiful to think that
[15:13] Christ who died upon the cross though he
[15:16] was it was his own children the the the
[15:19] children of Israel crying for his blood
[15:21] and how that Christ said father forgive
[15:24] them these are my children forgive them
[15:27] and in dying and shedding blood for for
[15:30] those children of Israel he got himself
[15:33] a gentile bride with it and we love that
[15:36] that's so beautiful but but but that
[15:39] that idea is with a thought of that the
[15:42] Kinsman is paying a price so that he
[15:45] gets
[15:47] something but the idea of this paying
[15:50] this Reckoning price is not so that he
[15:54] gets something he owns it
[15:56] all he owns this whole world he owns the
[16:00] universe he owns you and me he owns all
[16:02] of it anyway so what the price he's
[16:06] paying for is giving you back what
[16:09] belongs to you what belongs to me and
[16:14] that is what is so wonderful is when we
[16:17] begin then thinking about the Holy Ghost
[16:20] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a
[16:22] down payment for an Earnest and how that
[16:25] brother brandham says you've received
[16:27] now an arcade now go and explore it
[16:31] climb the ladders and look in every nook
[16:33] and cranny and see what belongs to you
[16:36] and when you begin to think of those
[16:38] children of Israel who crossed over
[16:40] Jordan and and crossed over that kanes
[16:42] barnea and finally were given that
[16:45] promised land and when Joshua and the
[16:47] children of Israel took that land and
[16:50] drove out the enemies and then finally
[16:52] when it was all said and done Joshua
[16:55] began dividing up the land by divine
[16:58] inspiration and saying Reuben this land
[17:01] is yours then Reuben could could from
[17:04] that time on take as long as they wanted
[17:08] to go and and walk every inch of that
[17:11] land and say this is all Reuben's right
[17:14] yes that's all Reuben I'd like to see
[17:17] what all Reuben owns I'd like to see
[17:20] every bit of it I'd like to plunge a
[17:22] shovel into it and see what color the
[17:25] soil is and is it Rocky is it fertile is
[17:28] it clay what is it and and the others uh
[17:32] uh Ephraim and Dan and man and all these
[17:35] ones that are exploring their land and
[17:37] taking what's theirs and and and taking
[17:40] the time to say well let's today take a
[17:43] stroll and see what's down by the
[17:46] beach some of us love beaches and
[17:50] somebody told me once now Christians do
[17:52] not go to the beach they visit the
[17:56] ocean I said fair enough but some love
[18:00] mountains and some love
[18:02] deserts and some love
[18:05] jungles and some love ice and snow and
[18:08] rain and everything
[18:12] else but
[18:17] now brother
[18:19] Erin touched on this in the message a
[18:23] matter of faith in Revelations 3 and:
[18:27] 7 and to the Angel of the church in
[18:29] Philadelphia right these things saith he
[18:32] that is Holy he that is
[18:35] true he that hath the Key of David he
[18:39] that openeth and no man shutteth and
[18:40] shutteth and no man openeth now brother
[18:43] brandom in the church age book takes a a
[18:46] just a a a a a portion and he's he's
[18:49] pulling each of these phrases apart and
[18:52] he takes this portion of he that is true
[18:56] and brother Aaron read these things and
[18:58] I thought oh so tremendous I've I I I
[19:00] want to I want to look at that I want to
[19:03] study that and brother BR says these
[19:05] things saith he that is true now this
[19:07] word true is a very wonderful word and
[19:10] my when brother Matt was speaking who
[19:12] you know what is truth and I thought oh
[19:15] this is beautiful it does not mean true
[19:18] in just the sense that it is opposite to
[19:20] false it expresses the perfect
[19:23] realization of an idea as contrasted
[19:27] with its partial IAL realization for
[19:30] example we recall that Jesus said in
[19:33] John 6:32 Moses gave you not that bread
[19:37] from heaven but my father giveth you the
[19:40] true bread from Heaven John 15:1 I am
[19:44] the True Vine Hebrews 9:24 for Christ is
[19:48] not entered into the holy places made
[19:51] with hands which are the figures of the
[19:53] true but into heaven
[19:56] itself now to appear in the presence of
[19:59] God for US 1 John 2:8 because the
[20:03] darkness is PED and the True Light now
[20:09] shineth since this word indeed expresses
[20:13] perfect realization as against the idea
[20:16] of partial realization as Illustrated in
[20:19] these verses we can Now understand as
[20:23] never before antitype contrasted with
[20:28] type typ and substance with
[20:32] Shadow take the example now of Mana from
[20:35] Heaven God sent down Angel bread from
[20:38] heaven for Israel but that bread did not
[20:42] satisfy it was only good for a day those
[20:46] who ate it were hungry again the next
[20:49] day if it was left around it became
[20:52] contaminated but Jesus is the true bread
[20:57] from heaven whereof Mana was just a
[21:01] type and if any man eats from Heaven
[21:05] whereof Mana was just a t If any man
[21:08] eats of that bread that came from Heaven
[21:11] he will never hunger again he does not
[21:14] need to come back and eat again am the
[21:17] moment he partook he had eternal life
[21:22] here indeed was reality Jesus Christ was
[21:26] here he was reality
[21:29] no need any longer for a shadow no need
[21:32] for a partial salvation here is the
[21:35] whole of it just like Jesus isn't a part
[21:39] of God he is
[21:46] God that's what so excited me when I
[21:49] when we got into this idea of
[21:53] righteousness if you go and you read
[21:55] Romans and you just just read through
[21:57] and you start that let that word just
[21:59] begin to pop out to you it's it is
[22:03] replete through the book of Romans
[22:06] righteousness righteousness
[22:07] righteousness righteousness and it's all
[22:10] it's because of this sticky human nature
[22:13] that wants to be able to do something to
[22:18] achieve
[22:19] righteousness to be justified to be
[22:22] right with God I don't want to be wrong
[22:24] I want to be right with God and when
[22:27] this this
[22:29] antitype of of of uh that the the
[22:34] Jubilee and selling yourself into
[22:36] bondage is merely a shadow on a wall
[22:40] it's it's simply though it really did
[22:43] happen and men were really selling
[22:45] themselves into bondage we begin to
[22:47] realize that the real bondage is not our
[22:51] physical what we're doing physically on
[22:54] a daily basis but that we as as mankind
[22:58] have been caught up in
[23:00] bondage and that bondage isn't
[23:03] necessarily uh to just to the World
[23:06] perhaps our bondage has been to
[23:09] religion perhaps our bondage has been to
[23:12] a church our bondage has been to an
[23:15] idea and and it was what we could do
[23:18] what we could do but when the real when
[23:20] we begin to recognize that righteousness
[23:23] is Jesus Christ that he fulfilled the
[23:27] righteousness that he was the
[23:29] Fulfillment of Jubilee that he was the
[23:32] Fulfillment of the atonement day when we
[23:36] begin to realize wait why are we still
[23:39] looking at the the the shadows and why
[23:41] are we still looking at the types the
[23:43] price has already been paid for
[23:46] righteousness the righteousness has been
[23:48] given and I'm free to take it I'm free
[23:52] to have
[23:54] it oh my then then then you you're
[23:57] you're you're mine and your soul begins
[23:59] to Bubble
[24:02] up my mind then begins to go now to this
[24:06] idea of
[24:08] success and I've
[24:11] always uh I've always I guess
[24:15] admired
[24:17] um I I don't know I guess great great
[24:20] achievements great great feats of
[24:27] men uh um I used to be real heavily
[24:30] involved when I was a young man my boy's
[24:33] age in in athletics and and and and so
[24:37] then you learn you know that
[24:38] competitiveness and grew up you know
[24:42] rooting for a team you know it was as a
[24:45] boy the San Francisco 49ers they were
[24:47] winning all the all the super bowls with
[24:50] Joe Montana and Jerry Rice and Ronnie
[24:52] lot and I you know it was like hey just
[24:55] Nobody Greater you know Joe Montana's
[24:57] the greatest quarterback there ever was
[24:58] and and Jerry Rice the greatest receiver
[25:01] there ever was and and they just stacked
[25:03] this team was just stacked with just
[25:05] such great then they got Steve Young and
[25:08] he just kept going but it was always oh
[25:10] you know Joel
[25:12] Montana and and then I grew up and in
[25:15] high school I'm running track and track
[25:16] and field and you know Michael Johnson
[25:19] who ran the fastest 400 meter and
[25:22] perhaps the 200 meter and now his
[25:24] records have all I think been broken and
[25:26] so forth but it was that idea of of
[25:28] somebody who's who's the greatest at
[25:31] whatever it is that they do they were
[25:33] the they were they were the the the the
[25:36] image of success in what they
[25:40] did and I I I always thought it was
[25:43] merely with with Athletics but as I got
[25:48] older I
[25:50] realized even in the workforce even in
[25:53] in my job uh that that idea of success
[25:57] can just be
[25:58] transferred you know from one thing to
[26:01] another and I found myself as I looked
[26:04] back over my life I was chasing success
[26:07] I was looking for
[26:09] Success this idea of
[26:15] success and you know there's only one
[26:18] scripture in the Bible that even
[26:19] mentions the word
[26:21] success one
[26:24] scripture Joshua chapter 1 verse 8 but
[26:29] I'm going to read verses 5-8 Joshua 1
[26:33] veres
[26:34] 5-8 there shall not any man be able to
[26:38] stand before thee all the days of thy
[26:42] life as I was with
[26:44] Moses so I will be with
[26:48] thee I will not fail thee nor forsake
[26:52] thee be strong and of a good courage For
[26:55] unto this people shalt thou divide
[26:58] provide for an inheritance the land
[27:00] which I swear unto their fathers to give
[27:02] them only be thou strong and very
[27:05] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[27:07] do according to all the law which Moses
[27:10] my servant commanded thee turn not from
[27:13] it to the right hand or to the left that
[27:15] thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou
[27:18] goest this book of the law shall not
[27:21] depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt
[27:23] meditate therein day and night that thou
[27:26] mayest observe to do Accord according to
[27:28] all that is written therein for then
[27:32] Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and
[27:34] then Thou shalt have good
[27:42] success it's the only
[27:46] scripture
[27:48] brother Aaron read this scripture again
[27:52] in a matter of Faith Revelations 3:
[27:56] 17-18 because thou th sayest I am rich
[28:01] and increased with goods and have need
[28:03] of
[28:04] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[28:08] wretched and miserable and poor and
[28:11] blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of
[28:15] me gold dried in the
[28:18] fire that thou mayest be rich and white
[28:22] rment that thou mayest be clothed and
[28:25] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[28:27] appear and anoint thine eyes with isav
[28:31] that thou mayest
[28:33] see this
[28:36] idea of a people who imagine they're
[28:42] successful and as brother Aaron was
[28:46] discussing it's a matter of
[28:48] perspective in their
[28:51] perspective they're rich they have no
[28:54] what they don't have any need of
[28:56] anything but in God's perspective Ive
[28:59] they're poor they're miserable they're
[29:02] naked and they don't know
[29:10] it so there's this idea of I want to be
[29:13] successful and I I would want to say
[29:17] tonight
[29:19] I I titled it good success but I I I
[29:23] wanted to say I want
[29:26] success I want suc
[29:29] success I want I would want you to be
[29:33] successful I would want everybody in
[29:36] this room to be successful I would want
[29:37] these children to be successful and all
[29:40] that they would put their minds to I'd
[29:42] want them to be
[29:44] successful so now the question is what
[29:47] then would that mean to be
[29:51] successful well we if we were saying
[29:53] well we we we financially successful of
[29:56] course we would want that I would want
[29:58] that for each and
[30:01] everyone Health healthwise you'd want to
[30:05] be successfully healthy in life of
[30:08] course of course of course of
[30:18] course but I look at just like
[30:22] righteousness this fight that we have in
[30:26] this sticky flesh I want to be right I
[30:28] want to be right I want to be right what
[30:30] can I do what can I do what can I do and
[30:35] then when it becomes
[30:37] clear you
[30:40] can't or you can
[30:42] try all you'd like but success has
[30:46] already been
[30:55] purchased brother brandom says but we
[30:57] find here that
[30:58] God in spite of all the
[31:02] failure that Moses had done he still had
[31:05] his hand on him and he called him to go
[31:07] do his service called him to his
[31:11] commission and what a consolation that
[31:14] must have been to Joshua when he heard
[31:16] God say as I was with Moses so will I be
[31:21] with
[31:24] you although if I'm trying and I fail
[31:29] God won't leave
[31:31] me I love that I had to highlight those
[31:35] because I that's how I feel oh
[31:39] God it would be such a consolation to
[31:43] hear those words through Revelation
[31:46] through audibly however that would be as
[31:49] I was with Moses ah so will I be with
[31:54] you what a consolation but to then to
[31:57] know
[31:58] if I fail if I'm trying and I fail God
[32:03] won't leave
[32:04] me I never have much confidence in
[32:07] anybody that's too afraid to do anything
[32:10] I would rather be found a failure than
[32:13] too lazy to
[32:15] try one time it was said that the
[32:19] Ballard and Ballard Flower Company hired
[32:22] a man and he was going to sign his name
[32:24] and the man had no eraser on the end of
[32:26] his pencil and Mr Ballard said said to
[32:28] him said why haven't you got an eraser
[32:32] he said I don't make
[32:34] mistakes he said then I can't use you
[32:37] because if you don't make mistakes you
[32:41] won't do nothing that's true God don't
[32:45] hold you responsible for your mistakes
[32:48] he holds you responsible for your
[32:51] willful sin he that sins wul after he
[32:54] has received the knowledge of the truth
[32:57] but a man that's going to do something
[32:59] is going to
[33:01] blunder he's going to fall he's going to
[33:05] make mistakes but if he's really
[33:08] divinely called and God is in his heart
[33:12] he'll rise again it's a promise he'll
[33:15] rise again he'll rise again he'll rise
[33:21] again
[33:28] now brother brandom says a little bit
[33:30] down in the same message as I was with
[33:32] Moses so I'll be with with thee that's
[33:35] my desire Brethren to see my church
[33:38] cross over into another land a desire to
[33:43] move over to the other side if there's
[33:45] something in you here first calling
[33:48] there will be something to respond to
[33:50] that
[33:51] call just sitting down to sheep raising
[33:54] ain't enough for you go into some sort
[33:57] of of a business is not enough for
[34:00] you join the church and put your name on
[34:03] the book is not enough for
[34:05] you because there's something called on
[34:09] across the ridge Yonder across the next
[34:11] Ridge and all across Jordan until you
[34:14] fall into the arms of God Yonder a deep
[34:18] calling unto a
[34:20] deep
[34:25] good these are just my feelings this is
[34:28] just how I feel when I hear this it
[34:30] speaks true to my heart and I believe
[34:33] every believer has got this feeling in
[34:35] their heart that just raising sheep
[34:38] that's not good enough just to get a
[34:40] good job that's not enough for me
[34:43] right just to join a church just to just
[34:46] to go just to be a part of a church it's
[34:49] not enough there's something more
[34:52] there's something more for me there's
[34:54] something more I want some would say
[34:57] well that but that's a good life that's
[34:59] every successful man I know that's what
[35:02] they do but I want more than that that's
[35:04] not the success I'm looking for there's
[35:07] something
[35:11] more I told this story to the youth
[35:15] and I'm doing good on time praise the
[35:21] Lord I told this story to the youth
[35:24] and I'll tell it to you I had the priv
[35:28] of listening to a a a man and I'll give
[35:32] you a little bit of his
[35:37] backstory
[35:39] he
[35:43] um was a young
[35:45] man was uh had grown up uh his father
[35:48] was a sports writer he was very uh
[35:52] athletic had good genes and um as he
[35:57] grew up he played uh he was playing
[36:00] Athletics this young man but his real
[36:02] love he found was football and he became
[36:06] real successful in football did really
[36:09] well so well
[36:11] that he got a scholarship full ride
[36:15] scholarship um for athletics to a a a
[36:20] university as a
[36:22] quarterback
[36:25] and he uh
[36:29] he said I put all my chips you know I
[36:31] put all my eggs in that one basket was
[36:34] Athletics everything was in on
[36:37] that but he got
[36:39] injured and he fell out and that was
[36:44] that so then
[36:47] he because of I think maybe some help
[36:51] around him and and and the people that
[36:53] he knew his father and so forth he was
[36:55] able to get um some really nice
[36:59] jobs as he gotten out of out of college
[37:03] he gotten some very nice jobs and he had
[37:04] worked with uh in in Washington DC with
[37:08] some campaigns and and then after these
[37:11] campaigns he uh got a job as a Trader
[37:15] and uh was was doing very well with the
[37:19] trading but he through
[37:22] throughout from the time he was in high
[37:24] school and on he had gotten caught up
[37:29] into using
[37:31] drugs and by the time he was had this
[37:36] great job and this well-paying job he
[37:38] was he was an addict he was a real
[37:43] addict and he was introduced to uh to re
[37:49] worse and worse drugs as he went along
[37:52] and he became such an addict that all
[37:55] the money begins to pour into that and
[37:56] all your energy begins to pour into
[38:00] that and to pay for his habit he began
[38:04] burglarizing and and doing a lot of
[38:07] burglarizing and and very indepth
[38:11] and high-end
[38:14] burglarizing and finally when he got
[38:18] caught and he did get
[38:20] caught um he was in jail and and they
[38:25] were sentencing him and he didn't he he
[38:27] thought burglarizing you can't you know
[38:29] what are you going to get for
[38:30] burglarizing
[38:31] but he ended up his sentencing gave him
[38:34] a life sentence in in fact life sentence
[38:37] I think was 60 years and he got 65 years
[38:40] in
[38:41] prison and his mother and father who
[38:45] were professed
[38:47] Christians had said now there's there
[38:51] some stipulations when you go to prison
[38:53] that you owe us as your parents one is
[38:55] you'll never join a gang in prison and
[38:58] the other is you'll never you'll never
[39:01] tattoo your
[39:02] body and he promised his mother he made
[39:05] that promise I'll do none of those
[39:07] things well as he was awaiting uh all
[39:11] the processing to get shipped off to
[39:13] prison he's asking all the people that
[39:14] had gone to prison how do I survive how
[39:17] am I going to survive in prison and all
[39:20] these real hardened CRI criminals told
[39:23] him the same answer every time you've
[39:26] got to join a game
[39:27] it's the only way to survive well he
[39:30] promised his mother he wouldn't so he
[39:32] finally ran into this older
[39:35] gentleman who had given him some advice
[39:40] he said are you done listening to all
[39:42] these
[39:43] other people who don't aren't giving you
[39:46] good good answers he said yeah if you he
[39:49] said you want to really know how to
[39:52] survive I'll tell you
[39:55] how and he and he gave him a a list and
[39:59] I don't want to go through all of that
[40:00] but in the end this man never joined a
[40:03] gang never tattooed his
[40:06] body and the man
[40:10] because he G he surrendered his life to
[40:13] God while he was in
[40:16] prison and he eventually has now got a
[40:21] lifetime parole and he's out in this I I
[40:26] I know in the United States I don't know
[40:27] if he's going around the world he could
[40:29] be he's certainly gone to most of the
[40:31] major university and stalked to most of
[40:33] the mo of the collegate teams um and
[40:38] told them his story and so he's he's
[40:41] written books and he's and he's his life
[40:44] has absolutely been
[40:47] transformed but this there was a a piece
[40:50] of advi the the piece of advice that was
[40:53] given to him in
[40:55] prison I believe this advice could be
[40:59] not only said about prison life but life
[41:02] in
[41:03] general
[41:08] and and I don't just mean this will
[41:11] apply to somebody out there this is good
[41:14] for children in high schools and good
[41:16] for motivational speaking to to people
[41:20] of the
[41:21] world this can apply to a church
[41:25] life this can apply
[41:28] to a believer's
[41:32] life and this man his name was Mr Jack
[41:35] and he told him this he said prison and
[41:39] I would say I'll just change the words
[41:41] so that I'm telling you the story now
[41:45] life is like a pot of boiling
[41:52] water
[41:54] and there's three things that you're
[41:57] going to put into this water this
[42:00] boiling water in
[42:02] life and the first thing is a
[42:05] carrot when you put a carrot into a pot
[42:09] of boiling water what
[42:13] happens it gets
[42:15] soft it gets soft the
[42:19] carrot loses its rigidity and it becomes
[42:23] soft and mushy and it can't hold
[42:29] and the trials of
[42:32] Life can can absolutely wipe a person
[42:38] out can make him and I don't mean soft
[42:41] as in a contrite spirit and a and a
[42:46] broken that's not what I'm talking about
[42:48] I'm talking about not being able to to
[42:51] to make a stand in life not even able to
[42:54] make a stand for God and make a stand
[42:56] for your convictions it can break your
[42:59] very
[43:00] will trying to think it was brother
[43:03] Aaron I I really appreciated here a few
[43:06] weeks ago he he had quoted from Proverbs
[43:09] that if a man uh his body is broken his
[43:13] a spirit within him will but if a man's
[43:16] Spirit be broken he's no good I thought
[43:19] that's so good that's so true and and
[43:22] and and God that is such a truth and
[43:25] thank you for putting that in your word
[43:27] because God has given us a spirit that
[43:31] when we are broken as human beings when
[43:33] we're broken through trials of Life the
[43:36] spirit of Christ within us can re revive
[43:39] us
[43:40] again it can it can bear us up and it
[43:43] can give us give us Supernatural
[43:46] strength and fortitude to to to press to
[43:50] press the
[43:53] battle and so Trials of this life can
[43:56] make you like that carrot they can make
[43:57] you soft where that you you you you've
[43:59] got no stand you you've lost all that
[44:02] the second thing that can go into this
[44:05] pot of boiling water is an egg and what
[44:08] happens if you put an egg in a pot of
[44:10] boiling water it gets
[44:13] hard the soft insides those parts that
[44:16] are inside that are meant to be soft
[44:18] those parts that should should have that
[44:21] that yoke that life that that that
[44:23] movement that protection of the Yoke it
[44:26] gets hard and and and and and not uh not
[44:30] hard as in what we just said able to
[44:33] stand up against but hard against
[44:36] everybody else as brother brandham said
[44:37] you like a sticker you punch as brother
[44:41] uh Aaron's meme is punching you you
[44:44] punch at everything you become hard you
[44:46] become
[44:47] bitter and that's what happens to the
[44:49] egg he said but there's a third thing
[44:52] that you can put in that boiling water
[44:54] and that is a coffee bean
[44:58] and I know brother Chris likes that he's
[45:01] my coffee supplier with Winker
[45:05] Beans but that third thing is a coffee
[45:07] bean and what happens when you put a
[45:09] coffee bean in boiling water it makes
[45:14] coffee doesn't change the bean doesn't
[45:18] make it softer it doesn't make it harder
[45:20] it it makes what's in that bean come out
[45:24] and and the story is that what what is
[45:27] in that
[45:29] being that with the other two things it
[45:32] was those that that element that boiling
[45:35] water affected the that that element you
[45:38] put into the water but when with the
[45:40] Coffee Bean you affect the very thing
[45:44] that is that was affecting the other
[45:46] things you transform the atmosphere with
[45:49] that coffee bean life and this was told
[45:52] to this man in prison and it stuck with
[45:54] him so much that it transformed his life
[45:57] and he in his heart said I've got to
[45:59] become that coffee being and and and and
[46:03] in in in my prayer when I when I hear
[46:06] this story and I tell this story to
[46:08] young men when I tell this story to
[46:11] young men that are that are that are are
[46:13] are are of working age or or are trying
[46:15] to get through school and they're trying
[46:17] to find their way in life they're trying
[46:19] to find the direction that they're going
[46:22] and with all their heart they want to
[46:24] live for God they want to serve God and
[46:26] they want to live in this world that
[46:29] that that is that would love to affect
[46:31] them or infect them and and they're
[46:34] wanting to know what am I as a Believer
[46:37] which direction am I supposed to go what
[46:39] am I supposed to do how am I supposed to
[46:41] withstand the elements of this life and
[46:44] the idea is that oh God when I begin to
[46:47] think of success and and and I think you
[46:50] know what do I need for this to be
[46:53] successful what are the elements that
[46:54] are outside that can affect my sucess
[46:56] uccess my my prayer and my heart says
[47:00] God let the not the the the thing of
[47:04] success but the who the person of
[47:07] success that's inside that when the
[47:10] pressures of life that when the when
[47:12] everybody wants to see you stand or fall
[47:15] one or the other as as John Wesley uh I
[47:18] I believe put it that set a man on fire
[47:21] and people will come from all over to
[47:23] watch him burn well you think well that
[47:25] could be a real good thing or that could
[47:27] be a real bad thing some people want to
[47:30] watch a man burn but others want to
[47:32] watch a man burn they want to watch the
[47:34] fire that that lights that man on fire
[47:37] and gets him excited about the things of
[47:39] God and I say let that righteousness
[47:43] that that that person of righteousness
[47:45] that when the Trials come the
[47:47] righteousness begins to come out it's
[47:50] not my righteousness that comes out it's
[47:52] not my success that would come out it
[47:55] wasn't Joshua who who who had to produce
[47:59] success in order to get the children of
[48:01] Israel but God said as I was with Moses
[48:05] I will be with you Joshua and my heart
[48:08] begins to burn and I begin to get
[48:11] excited because I know that if he made
[48:13] the promise he can
[48:15] [Music]
[48:17] deliver that this good success is not
[48:20] what I can do it's not what I have to do
[48:23] but my kinsman redeemer paid the price
[48:26] and it's been reckoned to me and I can I
[48:29] can receive my Jubilee I don't have to
[48:32] wait for some certain year for some
[48:35] certain message to be preached but I can
[48:37] have a jubilee in my vehicle on the ride
[48:40] to work I can have a jubilee in my
[48:42] prayer closet I can have a jubilee as
[48:45] soon as I recognize that that
[48:48] righteousness has been purchased for me
[48:51] to have access to that I'm right with
[48:54] God that I'm Justified with God that I
[48:57] don't have to work it up I don't have to
[49:00] in the morning say okay now okay where
[49:03] do I start the day how do I get this
[49:06] righteous man to be successful in my
[49:08] life he's in there he's in there let the
[49:12] elements take place let the
[49:15] circumstances take place in life that
[49:17] that righteous man can begin to come out
[49:21] that that success of a
[49:24] believer of a Joshua of a
[49:27] Caleb that can follow the word of God
[49:30] and the spirit of God and and in your
[49:33] heart you say God you know my heart you
[49:36] can open up your heart before him and
[49:38] say God though I
[49:41] failed though I've
[49:44] fallen though I've made
[49:46] mistakes God you know my
[49:49] heart is open before you my desire my
[49:52] very desire My heart's desire though it

[50:04] deep down inside is that seed that God
[50:09] you have
[50:12] quickened that that success that I'm

[50:19] righteousness that righteousness of
[50:24] God brother brandom make makes this

[50:59] Foundation that it's not just a one-time
[51:01] instance but brother bam says this not

[51:08] meeting I went home with an old Rancher
[51:11] for dinner oh and some of his people had
[51:14] been healed he' give me a check there
[51:17] that would have bought me 45 of these

[51:29] the
[51:29] check I said I don't want his money let
[51:32] me live day by day not money I'm
[51:35] after I'm one to serve the Lord Jesus he
[51:38] stood there when that woman was healed
[51:41] out yonder the the mikans in California
[51:44] you seen it here in the Louisville paper
[51:47] when they come here two of those agents
[51:49] and brought a million
[51:51] $500,000 and offered it to me when I
[51:53] lived in this two room Shack I said I
[51:57] don't even want to look at it no sir no
[51:59] sir the love of money is the root of all
[52:02] evil keep away from that stuff this
[52:04] Rancher walked out of there he said
[52:06] Reverend brandom I said yes
[52:09] sir he said you see the mountains out
[52:12] yonder I said yes sir how far you think

[52:25] my grazing ground
[52:27] I said my that's
[52:29] wonderful he said I he said see down in
[52:32] there that see that City he said I own
[52:35] the bank in that City I own all that
[52:37] ground down around all there and I own
[52:41] this way oh he all he owned stopped in
[52:44] his little station wagon I looked at him
[52:47] very nice man I laid my hand on his
[52:49] shoulder I said brother I want to ask
[52:51] you a question he said all right I said
[52:54] look right up this way
[52:57] how much do you own up that way
[53:00] see he said brother brandom I'm afraid I
[53:03] don't own
[53:05] anything I said there's where my
[53:08] treasures are laying now I don't have
[53:11] nothing down here whether I own tent or
[53:13] a cottage why should I care they're
[53:16] building a palace for me over there of
[53:19] rubies and diamonds and silver and gold
[53:21] his coffers are full he has riches I'm
[53:24] told yes sir that's where the riches
[53:26] lays up there and where your Treasures
[53:30] is your heart is also
[53:39] am this is from a court trial and I'll
[53:44] I'll close on
[53:51] this and the other day I stood and
[53:54] looked at his building and he's speaking
[53:56] of talk Tommy Osborne and oh my a
[53:59] million and5 dollars or something in it
[54:02] in it and I looked over there oral was
[54:04] standing there I was waiting I'd been up
[54:07] oral was so nice and all of them showing
[54:10] me around real nice brothers and I stood
[54:12] there and I thought think I was on the
[54:15] field before they started they each one
[54:18] tell you that they caught the
[54:20] inspiration from that and I thought I'd
[54:24] hate for them to come to my office
[54:26] huh I got one little typewriter sitting
[54:29] in the end of a trailer uhhuh see I'd
[54:32] hate for them to see
[54:34] it and I thought Lord look at here look
[54:38] at this big building worth $3 million
[54:41] they say and I thought I looked down the
[54:44] road and I went it said the future home
[54:47] of soand so future
[54:50] home and I
[54:52] thought but I don't say this in
[54:55] disregarding these brothers
[54:57] but just what was said to me I thought
[55:00] where is my future home something said
[55:04] look up so that's good enough for me as
[55:08] long as I'll look for mine up there so I
[55:11] don't say now I want us to catch this
[55:13] part of it so I don't say that they
[55:16] won't be there too you see but that was
[55:20] just to encourage me you
[55:23] see I like that I like like that because
[55:27] again we're not saying oh you
[55:30] know y'all everybody should have a
[55:32] trailer with one typewriter in the end
[55:34] of it that's and that's we're not going
[55:37] there that we're not going there and
[55:39] brother M's not trying to go there
[55:40] either he's not saying it's about the
[55:44] the the price of the building but there
[55:46] was something that was to encourage him
[55:49] and this is what I'm wanting to say with
[55:53] all of this that I have when I
[55:56] discovered this about righteousness and
[55:58] when I saw this with the Coffee Bean it
[56:00] was to encourage me it was to encourage
[56:04] me because there's just these times
[56:06] where you just you just wonder what am I
[56:09] doing Lord what am I doing what where's
[56:12] my place where what's what's my position
[56:16] and and have I done enough and as a
[56:18] Believer Lord you know you know my
[56:21] heart I got to do my part for my family
[56:24] and I want to do my part for my friends
[56:26] and I want to do my part for my for for
[56:29] this one and that one but God
[56:32] ultimately Lord there's nothing I can
[56:37] do but it's what I want to
[56:42] be he says I wouldn't have sense enough
[56:45] to know how to handle money like that
[56:48] God knows that
[56:49] too and then what if I had great big
[56:52] obligations like that do you think I
[56:54] could come here to this place place you
[56:57] think I could hold a three days meeting
[56:59] here like brother Roberts when brother
[57:01] Roberts has to have around 10,000 every
[57:03] day why I'd go wild the first day to
[57:06] meet that see why I can hold a me I can
[57:10] hold a meeting where there's five people
[57:13] or two people or one person or go
[57:15] wherever he sends
[57:17] me I have no need of anything but more
[57:22] of
[57:25] him so that's what I want you to pray
[57:30] that I'll have more of him to know him
[57:35] the Lord bless
[57:38] you church that's my
[57:41] prayer I I pray that if each one of us
[57:44] had our time to come up here we would
[57:48] say church I want more of him would you
[57:52] pray if you've got any prayer for your
[57:55] brother
[57:57] would you pray that I'll have more of
[58:04] him I'd invite the musicians to
[58:25] come when we read our Bibles
[58:29] and in our own private
[58:36] time when we find ourselves in a moment
[58:39] just hungering for
[58:42] God just praying God would you speak to
[58:50] me I got to tell you church that when
[58:54] I'm sitting down with my young
[58:57] employees and we we we're just mining
[59:01] we're just mining in the
[59:03] Bible just hoping to hit some we you
[59:06] know we don't know what we're about to
[59:07] find but let's mine together and we hit
[59:11] a gold
[59:12] vein like we did with this idea of
[59:15] righteousness not this idea but this
[59:17] reality of
[59:21] righteousness I I pray you get those
[59:26] [Music]
[59:28] I pray you have those
[59:30] times sister Grace most of the time is
[59:33] the one in the mornings that's sitting
[59:36] down with the children and having the
[59:38] devotions and many times I'm in the
[59:40] office and I'm already I've been up
[59:43] already for hours and I've already had
[59:45] my devotions and I'm in the office and
[59:47] but I'm hearing them having their
[59:49] devotions
[59:52] and the work of a mother is it's it's
[59:56] never
[59:59] ending it's not just a work she's not
[1:00:01] just mothering the children she's used
[1:00:03] most of the time mothering their
[1:00:05] husband you know and all of his needs
[1:00:09] it's it's it's it's
[1:00:13] Relentless but I pray that you can take
[1:00:15] those
[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:18] times where you're hungry and you you're
[1:00:21] you're mining you're wanting to you're
[1:00:23] wanting to hit a vein you're wanting to
[1:00:26] you want to hit something you don't know
[1:00:28] what it's going to be is it oil or is it
[1:00:29] gold or silver or
[1:00:31] nickel I pray though that when you have
[1:00:35] that when you hit it when you hit
[1:00:38] it that it'll spark your
[1:00:41] life and I'll stir up that coffee
[1:00:45] bean and you'll begin to you'll begin to
[1:00:50] affect the atmosphere in your
[1:00:53] home your marriage
[1:00:59] you you'll be able to impact your
[1:01:01] children in their schooling in their
[1:01:04] [Music]
[1:01:07] raising and I once in a while I I get
[1:01:10] the privilege to come into those
[1:01:12] devotions with the my wife and children
[1:01:16] working from home and I get to sit down
[1:01:18] and say oh now let's talk about that was
[1:01:20] a good scripture let's talk about this
[1:01:22] and being the preacher that I am they're
[1:01:24] probably just rolling in their eyes and
[1:01:26] going oh here we go with that again but
[1:01:29] to hear my children talking about the
[1:01:33] things of
[1:01:34] God oh there's just what greater success
[1:01:37] does a dad
[1:01:40] want there's no there's just nothing
[1:01:44] that compares to
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:48] that when when just see the the the love
[1:01:53] of God pouring out of not only your
[1:01:56] family but then you go you go meet with
[1:01:59] Believers and you sit and you start
[1:02:01] talking about the things of God just
[1:02:03] good things and just that coffee begins
[1:02:07] percolating in the
[1:02:10] room and you just think that is so clean
[1:02:14] it feels so
[1:02:19] good I pray church that that we we get
[1:02:23] those moments and that each time we get
[1:02:25] to to see each other from service to
[1:02:28] service from event to event from day to
[1:02:31] day whatever meeting to meeting lunch to
[1:02:34] lunch coffee to Coffee whatever it
[1:02:37] is
[1:02:39] we I think we're all like we're in a
[1:02:42] closing time we're in a closing time we
[1:02:44] keep saying it to each other but I pray
[1:02:46] that that that that's not what's driving
[1:02:48] us together is that we're in the closing
[1:02:50] time but it's getting better and
[1:02:53] better it's just getting clearer and
[1:02:55] clearer
[1:02:58] that's my
[1:02:59] prayer for for each of us I I tell you I
[1:03:04] as I've gotten to know each and every
[1:03:06] one a little bit more and a little bit
[1:03:08] more find out what you do and and and
[1:03:11] and the things you're good at it excites
[1:03:14] me it excites me to know each one and
[1:03:18] and then to hear the testimony of how
[1:03:21] we've come together here it's tremendous
[1:03:27] but it's all for the love of
[1:03:30] God I mean in the end it's just the love
[1:03:33] of
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:38] God I'd just like to pray with you if
[1:03:40] we'd Stand Together
