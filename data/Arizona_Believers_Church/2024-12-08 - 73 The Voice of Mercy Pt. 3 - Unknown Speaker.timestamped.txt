[0:00] this is a remarkable uh scripture
[0:02] reading it's one that uh is of great
[0:04] substance and weight to Believers to
[0:06] Christians it's one that uh I think has
[0:08] been the subject of a lot of inquiry and
[0:10] even uh opinions and establishments as
[0:13] the Catholic Church would take this and
[0:16] Empower priest with the ability to
[0:18] forgive sins and place it all in the
[0:20] church uh the Catholic church and their
[0:22] system and different ways of looking at
[0:25] this in the in the word and uh drawing
[0:28] things from it but I believe there's
[0:29] something really profound in what Jesus
[0:31] says here and I hope that it can become
[0:33] uh a little bit more clear to us
[0:34] according to the word of God and how
[0:37] this is a a way to Mercy and how God is
[0:40] speaking about uh sins being remitted
[0:43] which is the image of what the
[0:45] sacrifices were to do and what that Hol
[0:48] Most Holy place was to represent in
[0:50] those stripes of blood so those are uh
[0:52] the tie-ins to this particular scripture
[0:55] and as we've been looking at the house
[0:56] of the Lord and the voice of Mercy uh we
[0:59] know that the house of the Lord uh the
[1:02] the most holy place was that Mercy Seat
[1:05] that place that held the mercy seat and
[1:07] in there was God's throne and The Mercy
[1:11] Seat and that's that the most important
[1:13] part of the house of the Lord people
[1:15] trying to decipher my my slide as you
[1:19] provide me art that's inspired by my
[1:21] sermons I will use them in a slideshow
[1:23] so I want to encourage everybody to
[1:26] participate and on Calvary now we're
[1:28] going to fast forward to Pastor the
[1:30] bearded snake uh with the hat uh that
[1:33] then it said that God dwells on The
[1:35] Mercy Seat is what that caption said
[1:37] above that but on Calvary there's Jesus
[1:40] Christ and what was he brother Brandon
[1:41] clearly identifying this that was The
[1:43] Mercy Seat um The Throne of mercy and a
[1:46] throne of judgment in plain view as
[1:49] Christ is hanging there on the cross and
[1:51] so Luke
[1:53] 23:34 as Jesus is hanging there on the
[1:55] cross father forgive them for they know
[1:57] not what they do what is that that him
[2:00] interceding over the ignorance of the
[2:02] very ones who are crucifying him and so
[2:04] there's this season where they're
[2:06] crucifying the word they're crucifying
[2:08] the word made flesh they're crucifying
[2:10] Jesus Christ and there's this season
[2:11] where he's saying oh Father forgive them
[2:14] because they're ignorant and what was it
[2:16] that Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[2:18] he said repent as he preached that
[2:20] sermon he says you've crucified the Lord
[2:22] Of Glory and he interceded for your
[2:24] ignorance but now men are being
[2:26] commanded to repent and then in verse 43
[2:30] as he's hanging there on the cross it
[2:32] says uh he's speaking to the thief who
[2:35] said Lord remember me he said verily I
[2:37] say unto thee today shalt thou be with
[2:39] me in Paradise what is this
[2:42] reconciliation what is this act of The
[2:44] Mercy Seat it was imparting eternal life
[2:47] by what Authority by by what power CU
[2:49] you could even say the atonement hadn't
[2:51] fully been accomplished he hadn't
[2:53] presented himself into heaven yet as the
[2:55] sacrifice of fulfilling all shadows and
[2:57] types he hasn't resurrected yet but yet
[3:00] this is the word with authority with
[3:02] power and he says today shalt thou be
[3:05] with me in Paradise affirming the
[3:08] Covenant with h the Seed of Abraham and
[3:10] with these Old Testament Saints and we
[3:13] see that Christ is pleading for Mercy
[3:16] for those who are ignorant but then also
[3:19] granting life to those who see him and
[3:21] recognize him as he is and we saw how
[3:24] this was patterned in Acts how that Paul
[3:26] says himself that I obtained Mercy in my
[3:29] ignorance but then there is a Paul is
[3:34] recognizing his ignorance and realizes
[3:36] though he was a blasphemer and injurious
[3:38] he obtained mercy and yet we see Peter
[3:41] demanding repentance so there's a point
[3:44] at which it just kind of flips where
[3:45] there's Mercy for the ignorant but then
[3:47] there's this Tipping Point where you
[3:48] have to
[3:49] repent and you can't you can't kind of
[3:52] slide back into ignorance again I mean
[3:54] there's really a lot that uh sometimes
[3:57] we just wish we didn't know don't tell
[3:59] me I don't want to know cuz we realize
[4:01] that once you know you're accountable
[4:04] and and that was something I really
[4:06] appreciated at uh brother Mike
[4:08] Patterson's Memorial where he shared
[4:10] something it was shared that he said
[4:12] that whenever you inform somebody this
[4:13] was something he taught whenever you
[4:15] tell somebody the truth they're
[4:17] accountable for it and so there's a
[4:19] season where you are in ignorance and
[4:21] there's a mercy there because you do do
[4:23] so ignorantly but then there's a Tipping
[4:25] Point that once you know the only the
[4:27] only Escape is to repent or to accept
[4:30] and to acknowledge and so the Bible says
[4:32] in Acts 17:30 in the times of this
[4:35] ignorance God winked at there was a time
[4:37] when he wasn't uh he wasn't punishing
[4:40] there wasn't a line that was crossed but
[4:41] now commandeth all men everywhere to
[4:44] repent both Jew and Gentile Gentiles
[4:47] could always CLA well we have no idea
[4:48] what you're talking about but now God
[4:50] was revealed himself to them and so Paul
[4:52] had to repent as the gospels preach to
[4:54] Gentiles they were being held
[4:55] accountable they said well we didn't
[4:57] have a god appear to us on the mountain
[4:58] we didn't it was now they had to accept
[5:01] Christ and brother Bram says in the
[5:03] unveiling of God brother sister that's
[5:05] what the Jews did when the veil was rent
[5:07] and brought God into Plain View hanging
[5:08] on the cross he was in plain view but
[5:10] they couldn't see it could it be
[5:13] possible that the Gentiles have done the
[5:16] same
[5:16] thing in this hour in this day in this
[5:19] time he said it was Jesus Christ hanging
[5:22] on the cross The Mercy Seat and what was
[5:24] it the people were too blind to see it
[5:27] now it's repeated again
[5:30] their Traditions so there's the he says
[5:33] could it be possible that they've done
[5:34] the same thing and he's saying that's
[5:36] exactly what they've done and so we see
[5:38] those things even more pronounced in the
[5:41] sermon the indictment how they are
[5:42] crucifying Jesus Christ again and
[5:45] they're guilty right so he says the
[5:47] whole Mercy Seat is setting in plain
[5:48] view anybody can see it the veil is rent
[5:51] glory to God the whole Mercy Seat comes
[5:52] into Plain View he's not speaking
[5:54] historically he's speaking presently how
[5:57] could God have mercy on foul Sinners as
[5:58] us when he he hid himself was a mystery
[6:02] and now it's in plain view or in full
[6:05] view revealed by his word it is always
[6:10] it it's always the word constantly that
[6:12] is God it's the word that opens it up we
[6:15] know that Jesus Christ is the Living
[6:18] Word that brings God present and so as
[6:20] God was above them in the Old Testament
[6:23] and blessing them in the Old Testament
[6:24] and he was there uh declared himself
[6:27] with them but now we recognize that he
[6:30] was God in flesh God dwelling among them
[6:32] Jesus Christ The Living Word making God
[6:35] present among them and so here he's
[6:38] saying in our day it's the revealed word
[6:40] it's Jesus Christ The Living Word making
[6:42] God present and then in his presence
[6:45] there's where our Mercy is in receiving
[6:47] that and accepting that that's where
[6:49] Mercy is but to reject that is Judgment
[6:52] the world isn't going to look at God and
[6:53] say you're a phony you're a fake and if
[6:55] you're real you're just a narcissist and
[6:57] you're evil and you're the epitome of
[6:58] evil and we don't want you and God still
[7:00] like you come here you cute little
[7:02] grumpy guy now God's going to say that
[7:04] was your chance right you're rejecting
[7:06] truth you're rejecting the word you're
[7:08] rejecting Christ and that's judgment and
[7:11] so brother Brandon when he's preaching
[7:12] this the unveiling of God and he says
[7:14] the word is in plain view it's opened up
[7:16] he says it was tore open for a purpose
[7:19] now that's the that's the key there it's
[7:21] not so much okay yeah it's happened but
[7:23] why why is it made plain today so today
[7:28] The Mercy Seat Christ is here here being
[7:31] revealed and the only hope is to
[7:33] repent is it to repent and call the name
[7:36] of William brandom nope that would
[7:38] that's just as wrong as anything else
[7:40] but it's Christ the word take the full
[7:43] word of God into your heart just take it
[7:44] into your heart as it opens up hold fast
[7:47] to it become it that's what we to do is
[7:49] hold fast to this word that opens up to
[7:51] us and say Lord uh this is I'm going to
[7:54] not let go of this this is the
[7:57] truth now in Revelations chap 3 : 19 and
[8:01] 20 this is a scripture uh of the L Dean
[8:05] age and so his brother B says the mercy
[8:06] seats in plain view it's fully opened up
[8:09] and it's repeated again how there's
[8:11] blindness a and there's holding to
[8:13] traditions and through those traditions
[8:15] and the exercise of ceremony and all
[8:17] these outward things people take great
[8:19] comfort in that and in being behind
[8:22] those things they could be well we're
[8:24] fine as long as it looks good as long as
[8:26] we get results and it's their Traditions
[8:28] that they're blinded by but yet they're
[8:30] naked miserable poor so there's counsel
[8:32] given and here is this uh final call to
[8:36] the church as many as I love I rebuke
[8:38] and chasen be zealous therefore and
[8:41] repent and I'm wanting you to recognize
[8:43] this in the hour and the time that God
[8:46] is revealing himself to the Gentiles and
[8:50] here's this climax of the church ages
[8:52] the climax of The Gentile dispensation
[8:54] and once again The Mercy Seat is in
[8:56] plain view by the revealed word he's
[8:58] making himself known own and this this
[9:00] is a scripture that exist in that time
[9:04] that's relevant and given at that time
[9:06] be zealous therefore and repent see the
[9:08] parallels to uh that day on Calvary and
[9:12] that season of the church coming into
[9:13] its uh into into existence behold I
[9:16] stand at the door and knock If any man
[9:19] hear my voice and open the door I will
[9:22] come into to him and will suck with him
[9:25] and he with me Christ is now on the
[9:28] outside of the church
[9:29] he's been kicked out of the church he's
[9:31] no longer in the church he's no longer
[9:33] in the midst of all these uh uh the
[9:35] season of uh uh tearing down and
[9:37] building up and Reformation this is a
[9:39] different season uh he's interceded
[9:41] through the church ages but now he's
[9:43] knocking and what is he doing he's this
[9:46] reconciliation this final climactic
[9:48] piece of Redemption full
[9:50] Redemption and there's rebuke and
[9:52] chastening and we've already covered
[9:54] these uh two principles quite a bit this
[9:56] year on these things so he says be
[9:58] zealous therefore and
[10:00] repent and to be zealous is to desire
[10:02] earnestly to strive after busy oneself
[10:05] with and so it's to repent of this L toy
[10:08] and condition repent of your ignorance
[10:11] you're blind miserable poor naked
[10:13] wretched and so he's saying these are
[10:14] the things that you should do I counsel
[10:15] you to do these things and so you've got
[10:17] to repent of your error amen repent of
[10:20] your ways if a blind man thought he
[10:22] could see he's probably not going to say
[10:24] forgive me for being blind he's still in
[10:26] his ignorance so there's got to be he
[10:28] says uh I I've rebuked you I've
[10:30] chastened you you've heard my word
[10:31] you've heard my voice you can either
[10:33] choose to stay in ignorance and
[10:35] ignorance isn't going to be any appeal
[10:37] before the Judgment throne but now
[10:40] especially since you've been told you've
[10:41] been rebuked you've been chasen and now
[10:44] he says be zealous and
[10:47] repent and as it says in verse 20 to me
[10:50] the Zeal now is projected towards this
[10:53] uh seek and find him who's outside of
[10:55] the
[10:56] church who's calling you to receive him
[11:00] I've rebuked you I've chasen you be
[11:01] zealous therefore and repent CU behold
[11:03] I'm knocking on the door of your heart
[11:05] I'm speaking these things to you to
[11:07] reveal these things to disclose these
[11:09] things so I stand at the door and knock
[11:11] If any man hear my voice I will come
[11:14] into
[11:15] him now isn't that an interesting phrase
[11:18] I know that we read it I will come in to
[11:21] him but the phrase the word that is used
[11:24] is I will come and it's not uh in the
[11:28] original
[11:30] it gives this image of not just arriving
[11:33] uh in a place where someone is but it's
[11:35] actually this entrance into a condition
[11:37] or a state to come the word to come is
[11:40] to arise or to be to come into
[11:43] existence I will come in him it it
[11:47] speaks of to come into life when you say
[11:50] you come the word that would be used is
[11:51] to come before the public and then it's
[11:54] also used of thoughts that would come
[11:55] into the mind so this word come is very
[11:58] important uh it has different meanings
[12:00] but I want you to recognize it this way
[12:02] I will come and not so much be present
[12:05] with him but I'm going to come to life
[12:07] in him I'm going to appear to him I'm
[12:10] going to make myself known and I'm going
[12:13] to be the one that's present with him
[12:15] bringing things to mind animating him
[12:17] and moving him I will come in to him it
[12:21] speaks of a union and he says and I will
[12:24] Su with
[12:25] him we uh how many people here say
[12:28] dinner for lunch
[12:29] amen yeah there's different in supper
[12:32] and we get those confused and so I just
[12:33] like to eat dunch don't want any
[12:36] confusion here but there it's a supp it
[12:39] speaks of a supper Feast it is the meal
[12:41] it's a formal
[12:43] meal that is held at the evening
[12:47] time to Su this Feast this word this
[12:49] evening time Feast it's used of the
[12:51] messiah's feast this is an evening time
[12:54] Feast with the bride I I I like to point
[12:57] this out when I look at this scripture
[12:58] it's not a
[13:00] snack not a snack but this is a feast as
[13:04] brother Barry would say they'd be
[13:05] putting on the
[13:07] dog and so in the seed is not air with
[13:10] the shuck and I've been studying these
[13:12] things for the uh just have a few
[13:15] Services maybe for the end of the year
[13:17] might kind of revolve around a holiday
[13:19] theme in the Christmas time and so I've
[13:21] been looking at this idea of of this
[13:24] supping with him eating with him in the
[13:26] evening time and he says neither will a
[13:29] Christian eat on the dead caran from old
[13:32] denominational doctrines and things so
[13:33] the difference between a vulture a crow
[13:36] and a dove they eat on or even an eagle
[13:39] it's not going to eat on the dead things
[13:41] a Christian will not eat on the dead
[13:42] things they want the word of God fresh
[13:46] the promise of the hour he says God
[13:48] promised rabbits in the day of Lu Luther
[13:50] he promised other things in the days of
[13:52] others but now the promised us he
[13:55] promised us a full Square meal the full
[13:59] seven course menu for all the seals are
[14:03] opened and everything is ready for the
[14:06] word of God to those who can
[14:09] receive now there's those who have not
[14:12] yet received there's those that still
[14:14] would even wrestle with this particular
[14:15] statement that all seven seals are
[14:18] opened and everything is ready to those
[14:20] who can receive it and what is it opened
[14:21] up to us a full seven course menu It's
[14:25] the evening time Feast of the bride with
[14:27] the word even for shadowing that wedding
[14:30] supper in the sky because there's going
[14:32] to be a change in a translation and the
[14:35] wedding supper is after the union I will
[14:38] come into him I'm going to unite myself
[14:40] with my Gentile bride I will be present
[14:42] with them in this uniting time and
[14:45] there's going to be the spiritual
[14:48] Feast so Christ has revealed himself to
[14:50] the elect to Feast to commune and this
[14:53] sub this communion it's also to empower
[14:56] to command amen we see an image of this
[15:00] in Revelations 10: 8 and9 and the voice
[15:03] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[15:04] again saying go and take the little book
[15:06] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[15:08] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[15:10] Earth little did John know that he was
[15:12] going for a feast he says and I went
[15:15] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[15:17] the little book and he said unto me take
[15:19] it and eat it up so there is this
[15:23] progressive revelation of the book being
[15:26] opened go take the book it symbolizing
[15:30] some connection or ownership to it
[15:32] asking for it and saying being told you
[15:35] take it and I don't want you just to
[15:37] take it this is a further revelation of
[15:39] this audience with Jesus Christ there a
[15:40] further command take it and eat it up
[15:43] amen there's a a a taking of the book
[15:45] there's a feasting in this end time that
[15:47] the believer undergoes that the believer
[15:49] does and it's feasting in his
[15:52] presence now I I've tried to break
[15:56] down these scriptures be zealous there
[15:59] and repent behold I stand at the door
[16:00] and knock if you hear my voice let me
[16:02] come into you open up open up your heart
[16:04] let me come into you for this uniting
[16:05] time for this feasting time for this
[16:07] Fellowship this commandment and
[16:10] communion and I want to draw from his
[16:12] first coming and his resurrection to see
[16:15] a type or a shadow and we know those
[16:17] things literally happened but God is
[16:19] known by his characteristics and there's
[16:21] ways that we see these scriptures now
[16:23] and and these symbols being used and we
[16:25] can go back and see a literal happening
[16:28] in the in his first coming and his
[16:30] crucifixion and Resurrection uh because
[16:32] he's it's happened again today what
[16:34] happened then is repeated today and so
[16:37] in John chapter 20 I'm to be reading
[16:39] verses 19 to 23 but we'll I've got a um
[16:43] a scripture reading kind of in the
[16:44] middle so if you're taking notes I will
[16:46] be getting to verse 23 uh but uh we'll
[16:49] be reading from Luke 24 the similar
[16:51] happening in Luke 24 just to get the
[16:53] full picture so then the same day at
[16:55] evening being the first day of the week
[16:57] this is the day of the Resurrection
[16:59] it was a time of a crucifixion a time of
[17:01] death a time of fear a time of Darkness
[17:03] but joy came in the morning his mercies
[17:05] are renewed in the morning and here is a
[17:07] Resurrection on Resurrection morning so
[17:09] to the world there is a setting sun it's
[17:11] death it's Darkness but to the bride
[17:13] Shalom good morning it is the rising of
[17:17] the Sun so there is a the doors were
[17:21] shut I just think this is such a
[17:22] beautiful picture behold I stand at the
[17:25] door and knock and so it's to give this
[17:27] idea of one design iring entrance so
[17:29] here uh the disciples the doors were
[17:32] shut and the disciples were assembled
[17:34] for fear of the Jews doors are shut
[17:37] they're in this private place they're in
[17:38] this secret place they're shut out from
[17:40] the outside and the doors being shut
[17:43] came Jesus and stood in the midst and
[17:46] saith unto them and I I read in a
[17:48] commentary one time where it said the
[17:50] the way the scriptures phrased is to
[17:52] convey that Jesus didn't enter by
[17:54] ordinary means in other words the doors
[17:57] were shut and they didn't open open he
[17:59] didn't climb through a window he didn't
[18:02] descend down through the roof he didn't
[18:03] all of a sudden like throw up the the
[18:05] covers on the bed and say surprise but
[18:08] he appeared he came through the wall so
[18:10] to speak he appeared so he came in a way
[18:12] that was uh not normal or ordinary and
[18:16] he stood in the midst of them and saith
[18:18] unto them peace be unto you and there
[18:22] maybe not an immediate recognition right
[18:25] even when Jesus came walking on the
[18:26] water and they're like oh he said come
[18:28] to me it's a ghost and what is this
[18:30] there's this fear and when he had said
[18:32] so he showed unto them his hands and his
[18:35] side then were the disciples glad when
[18:39] they saw the
[18:42] Lord and we realize as we've already
[18:44] referenced from the unveiling of God if
[18:46] we could get the full picture of what
[18:47] had transpired uh from that prior week
[18:50] to the first day of the week the uh
[18:52] death burial now the Resurrection The
[18:54] Mercy Seat had been hanging in plain
[18:57] view their tradition s had ceased they
[19:00] had been exposed as bloodless there was
[19:01] no presence of God behind the veil in
[19:04] the temple The Mercy Seat had been
[19:05] hanging in plain view what was that the
[19:07] rejected Christ the word but now he's
[19:11] risen and the disciples so in the season
[19:14] of the word coming and being revealed
[19:16] rejected crucified but resurrected and
[19:19] present so it's not a dead Christ it's
[19:22] not a dead word the disciples those that
[19:25] followed him those that believed him
[19:26] were assembled Behind These closed doors
[19:29] they're they're separated from the word
[19:31] rejecting world they're separated from
[19:34] all the accusers and the crucifiers and
[19:36] they're gathered together and here
[19:38] they're gathered in fear and it's in in
[19:42] this time that Christ comes and makes
[19:44] himself known to them now and I'm
[19:47] wanting you
[19:49] to uh and I just ask God to help me
[19:51] today I want you to see this image as
[19:55] what we're facing yet today Christ
[19:57] wanted to make self known been veiled by
[20:00] so many Traditions a a and so many
[20:02] falsities and uh and so much of handling
[20:06] the word of God and unrighteousness and
[20:08] when I say this don't just think
[20:10] Catholic or Lutheran or Protestant you
[20:12] should think of all of them that name
[20:14] the name of Christ even those who've
[20:15] been associated with the message of the
[20:17] hour now I'm not going to say they're
[20:19] guilty we're all guilty of not
[20:21] accurately portraying the truth and so
[20:23] we ask God constantly for mercy and
[20:24] Grace in these things to be faithful to
[20:27] Christ and and and one thing I've been
[20:31] been really uh wrestling with lately is
[20:33] to fully understand because I think
[20:35] maybe it comes from this standpoint I'm
[20:37] maybe backing up and sharing uh
[20:39] something that is in my uh the process
[20:41] of laboring to find the mind of the Lord
[20:43] there's a lot of things I keep repeating
[20:45] there's a lot of things we keep looking
[20:46] at and I realized it's because I feel
[20:48] that there's a premise that we need to
[20:50] understand for all things that we don't
[20:53] always have to keep revisiting it but
[20:55] once we understand the premise then it's
[20:58] to give everything else to make sense
[20:59] like well why does this happen why does
[21:01] that happen why ises this why because
[21:02] there's this premise and if I could say
[21:03] it this way denominationalism had so
[21:07] covered up the word of God and it so
[21:10] chopped up the Bible in Christ into so
[21:12] many different pieces that the premise
[21:14] of the message of the hour is to bring
[21:16] us back to the truth of Christ in the
[21:18] word of
[21:19] God and and and in that then there
[21:22] becomes a wholeness to the truth that
[21:25] that's where you've got to be but if you
[21:27] try to hold in your denominations in
[21:28] organizations God's left that you've got
[21:31] to come back to the full word you got to
[21:33] come back to the truth he said okay well
[21:35] so I'm so glad I'm in the message well
[21:36] that's just that's not it it's you've
[21:38] got to come back to the Christ revealed
[21:41] and we're pointed back to by this
[21:44] message and so I believe if that's that
[21:47] being the truth it's a scary thing to be
[21:50] outside of this outside of the truth
[21:53] this Christ and so as the Believers are
[21:57] separated the disciples were separated
[21:59] it's a type of this end time when Christ
[22:01] has been crucified aresh The Mercy Seat
[22:05] is in plain view again and and this is
[22:08] this what happened there on that first
[22:09] day of the Resurrection I want us to
[22:11] draw a parallel of what happens in our
[22:13] hour in our day not in a literal
[22:15] physical sense but in the spiritual
[22:17] sense Luke chap 24:
[22:20] 25 well I have that wrong to verse 43 I
[22:23] think I might only have it to 27 here
[22:25] but it says this
[22:28] and this is on the road to emus when the
[22:31] disciples are discouraged they're down
[22:32] and Jesus draws near and they don't know
[22:34] who he is and they're like well he's
[22:36] like why are you so sad and they're like
[22:38] you haven't heard what happened there
[22:39] was this man that we beli to be the
[22:42] Messiah and uh and he's been you know
[22:46] they killed him and he uh and you know
[22:49] what besides today was the third day and
[22:51] this was the day that they said that
[22:52] he'd be that he would come back and you
[22:54] know what his tomb's empty and they
[22:55] don't know what happened to the body and
[22:56] it's kind of like
[22:59] are you putting this together you know
[23:01] they weren't quite picking it up and he
[23:03] says then he said to them oh fools and
[23:04] slow of heart to believe all that the
[23:07] prophets have spoken ought not Christ to
[23:10] have suffered these things and to enter
[23:11] into his glory now what kind of shock
[23:15] would have that been to believers who
[23:17] now feel as if maybe they're talking to
[23:19] someone who holds to the Old Testament
[23:20] prophets and this Christ and this
[23:22] Messiah and he's now saying something
[23:25] that kind of connecting with these PR
[23:27] modern events it says and at the
[23:29] beginning and beginning at Moses and all
[23:31] the prophets he expounded unto them in
[23:33] all the scriptures the things concerning
[23:36] himself amen what a time what what a
[23:40] moment in this Resurrection season a
[23:43] season of discouragement and fear and
[23:45] wondering what's happening and Promises
[23:47] being fulfilled and these could it
[23:49] bees and then they drew nigh into the
[23:51] village whether they went and he made as
[23:54] though he would have gone further now
[23:57] this is this parallel I see this
[23:58] parallel to Revelations chap 3 he he's
[24:01] not uh this isn't where he's headed this
[24:05] isn't his destination and so he made as
[24:08] if he was going to go further and it
[24:10] says and they constrained him saying
[24:12] abide with us notice this Zeal of of
[24:16] wanting to don't go don't carry or don't
[24:19] continue on uh don't pass Us by but come
[24:23] in to where we are in F and Su with us
[24:27] Fellowship Feast abide with us for it is
[24:29] toward evening here in this evening time
[24:32] as he would maybe continue on his way
[24:33] they constrain him in the day is far
[24:35] spent and he went into Terry with them
[24:39] so he's been invited it it's maybe not
[24:41] in the same sense of behold I stand at
[24:43] the door and knock and had he just
[24:44] showed up in the neighborhood and a
[24:45] knocked that night maybe we'd see a
[24:46] clear image but we do see that coming up
[24:50] where he makes himself known in behind
[24:51] closed doors and so here they're saying
[24:53] stay with us this is a a pattern of
[24:56] Christ in this T kind of season and he
[24:58] sat at meat with them he took bread and
[25:01] as it came to pass as he sat at meat
[25:03] with them he took bread and blessed it
[25:05] and break and gave to them what is he
[25:07] doing he's supping in the evening time
[25:11] takes meat and bread and notice what he
[25:14] does he breaks it and gives it to them
[25:17] did anybody get invited over to
[25:18] somebody's house for
[25:20] Thanksgiving wow this is nobody got
[25:24] invited about to say
[25:26] man this no nobody got invited somewhere
[25:29] for Thanksgiving well I didn't raise my
[25:31] hand uh but when you go into somebody's
[25:35] house what happens you kind of look to
[25:36] the head of the house what time it's
[25:38] you're going to eat right how many of
[25:40] you just went right in there and started
[25:41] carving the turkey right serving food
[25:44] Everybody by your heads we're going to
[25:45] pray I know we kind of feel that way
[25:46] sometimes we want to get the show on the
[25:47] road but the head of the house does that
[25:51] and so what he's doing here may seem to
[25:52] be very presumptuous but that's what
[25:54] caused them to see who is there is when
[25:57] the Master did what a master would do he
[26:00] had was made known to them in the
[26:02] breaking of bread in the in the blessing
[26:04] because it says and their eyes were
[26:06] opened and they knew him and he vanished
[26:09] out of their sight cuz he was he was the
[26:12] master he was the Master of the House of
[26:14] the Lord he was the Master of the House
[26:16] and here he's taking
[26:18] Authority he's the one blessing it he's
[26:21] the one breaking
[26:23] it and they said one to another now they
[26:26] realize did not our heart burn within
[26:28] us well he talked with us by the way
[26:31] while he opened to us the
[26:33] scriptures I believe there's a
[26:35] tremendous parallel to those of us who
[26:37] found ourselves just wondering in dark
[26:39] denominationalism and then something
[26:41] just kind of pulled up by our side and
[26:43] begin to fellowship with us and talk to
[26:44] us and open up the scriptures we begin
[26:46] to think wow this is amazing this is
[26:49] this is real I believe this who is this
[26:51] William brandom yeah this is true about
[26:52] the word of God and the more you believe
[26:54] it and the more you kind of find
[26:55] yourself enjoying the word of God there
[26:57] comes a time when you you realize wait a
[26:59] minute it it's been Christ this whole
[27:02] time revealing himself to me kind of
[27:05] like Ruth when she had that Epiphany
[27:07] when she went to Naomi and said man this
[27:08] has been feeding me in the evening time
[27:10] I've been gleaning and denominations are
[27:12] wrong and this is false and we're living
[27:14] this end time and these things are being
[27:15] restored and then finally the Revelation
[27:17] comes from the word ruth this isn't just
[27:21] something better this isn't just a
[27:23] correction to denominationalism this is
[27:25] Boaz this is your near Kinsman this is
[27:28] your
[27:30] Redeemer they realize this is the Christ
[27:34] verse 33 and they rose up the same hour
[27:36] cuz now things have changed what a
[27:39] changing once their eyes are opened and
[27:40] they they rose up the same hour and
[27:42] returned to Jerusalem and found the 11
[27:45] gathered and them that were with them
[27:49] saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath
[27:50] appeared to Simon there's a lot of Clues
[27:52] and things pieced together here and they
[27:55] told what things were done in the way
[27:57] and how he was known of them in Breaking
[28:01] of
[28:01] bread there something particular about
[28:04] that function to them that stood out to
[28:08] them the breaking of bread the the book
[28:12] in the hands the breaking of it and the
[28:15] feeding of it something about this
[28:17] process that really stood out to them
[28:20] and he said this is how he was made
[28:21] known and it stood out enough for them
[28:23] to to for or it was meaningful enough to
[28:26] happen that way for them to remember
[28:28] remember it that way for them to tell it
[28:29] that way for it to be memorialized in
[28:30] the scripture that
[28:32] way and as they thus spake verse 36 now
[28:35] this parallels John 20 notice this Jesus
[28:37] himself stood in the midst of them the
[28:39] doors are shut Jesus is there and said
[28:42] to them peace be unto you now when we
[28:44] read at John nine it says peace be unto
[28:46] you and he showed his hands and his side
[28:48] and then the disciples were glad when
[28:50] they saw the Lord this kind of gives us
[28:52] a little bit more context you could
[28:53] thank Luke The Physician for being a
[28:55] little bit more detailed but he says uh
[28:58] that he stood in the midst of them and
[28:59] said Peace verse 37 but they were
[29:01] terrified and affrighted we should use
[29:03] that word more often affrighted and
[29:05] supposed that they had seen a
[29:07] spirit not not sure what what this is
[29:10] and not sure could you imagine I at this
[29:13] point real devout Stout believers who
[29:15] believed in the Messiah believed in
[29:17] Christ believed he was the master he's
[29:18] crucified and then someone comes telling
[29:20] ghost stories you know he's alive he's
[29:22] doing this and he's doing that and we've
[29:24] seen him and he's appeared and then all
[29:26] of a sudden this it uh it's making
[29:28] itself known to you and you're kind of
[29:29] at first like I don't know about this
[29:31] this seems a little crazy this seems a
[29:33] little bit odd but he he he presses the
[29:36] issue and says in verse 38 why are you
[29:41] troubled why do thoughts arise in your
[29:44] hearts let's put ourselves in their
[29:47] shoes think about where where we can be
[29:50] at times in our own minds and our own
[29:51] difficulties and our own
[29:53] struggles he says behold my hands and my
[29:55] feet that it is I myself handle me and
[30:01] see this is what God wants us to do when
[30:05] we begin to fear when we begin to doubt
[30:07] when we hear feel the the pressing of
[30:08] the fear from the outside and the
[30:10] worldliness and all the things that seem
[30:12] to surround us this is what he says
[30:15] handle me and
[30:17] see for a spirit hath not Flesh and
[30:20] Bones as you see me
[30:22] have this is a process of Christ
[30:25] becoming more
[30:26] real not just a figment of their
[30:28] imagination not
[30:30] a this is some I want you to handle me I
[30:32] want you to know I'm
[30:34] real and he says and when he had thus
[30:36] spoken he showed them his hands and his
[30:38] feet now you see this parallel directly
[30:39] with John and while they yet believed
[30:43] not for joy and wondered he said unto
[30:46] them have you here any
[30:50] meat and they gave him a piece of
[30:52] broiled fish and of a honeycomb and he
[30:55] took it and did eat before them
[30:58] them this this this is the communion
[31:01] this is the supping this is the
[31:02] fellowship wanting to become more real
[31:04] to him now there's things that are
[31:06] transpiring in in these da this what
[31:08] would be seemingly be a normal evening
[31:10] activity Christ is there making himself
[31:13] known and this is where let's just read
[31:15] it again in John chapter 20 verse 21
[31:18] then said Jesus to them again peace be
[31:20] unto you as my father hath sent me even
[31:23] so I send you so this is part of this
[31:27] the this disc discourse and this this
[31:30] communing there that evening as we're
[31:31] reading about Luke 24 and when he had
[31:33] said this he breathed on them and said
[31:35] unto them receive ye the Holy
[31:37] Ghost now as we had read it in verses 19
[31:41] and 20 when he said Peace be unto you
[31:44] and he showed him his hands and his side
[31:47] the disciples are glad when they saw the
[31:49] Lord and now Luke 24 gives us a little
[31:52] bit more of a background that maybe at
[31:54] first they're afraid and so he said
[31:56] Peace be unto you they're afraid he says
[31:58] why are you troubled do you know do you
[32:00] know who I am uh I am not a spirit and
[32:03] he goes to this and he says see me
[32:05] handle me let's eat together and they
[32:07] begin to eat together and this is
[32:09] something that he is saying to them why
[32:11] they're supping why they're communing
[32:14] peace be unto you as my father hath sent
[32:16] me even so I send you he's opened
[32:20] himself up revealing himself for a
[32:21] purpose he's not just coming to say if
[32:24] you ever doubted I was alive you can't
[32:26] now and then leave but is going to
[32:28] command as I was sent by the father I am
[32:31] now sending you that phrase in itself is
[32:35] heavy and when he had said this he
[32:38] breathed on them and sa to him receive
[32:39] ye the Holy
[32:41] Ghost this is this symbolism this
[32:44] imagery he's going to come to it in Luke
[32:45] 24 we'll see it in more detail receive
[32:47] you the Holy Ghost whosoever sins ye
[32:49] remit they are remitted unto them these
[32:52] are covered reconciled and whosoever
[32:55] sins ye retain they are retained
[32:58] binding and loosing so to speak and this
[33:01] is the Great Commission and this is a
[33:03] very profound and weighty commission as
[33:05] we mentioned at the very outset of this
[33:07] how that this is one to wrestle with and
[33:08] really try to get your eyes around but
[33:10] Christ and your heart around Christ is
[33:12] sending them out in his place yes amen
[33:17] and whosoever sends you remit they are
[33:19] remitted whosoever are retained they are
[33:22] retained in Luke chapter 24 let's pick
[33:25] it back up uh in Verses 4
[33:28] 4 to 49 and he said to them these are
[33:32] the words which I spake unto you so as
[33:34] he took the word and he's as he's taken
[33:35] and he's eating he's eating broiled fish
[33:37] and honeycomb and he says said to him
[33:39] these are the words which I spake unto
[33:40] you while I was yet with you that all
[33:42] things must be fulfilled which were
[33:44] written in the law of Moses and in the
[33:45] prophets in the Psalms concerning me
[33:48] then opened he their understanding that
[33:50] they might understand the scriptures
[33:53] doesn't necessarily happen at the
[33:54] beginning or in the end but at a
[33:56] particular time he realizes it's opened
[33:58] up their understanding just as he had to
[34:00] them the scriptures and how he's made
[34:02] known like their hearts were burning
[34:03] when he opened up the scriptures then
[34:05] he's made known in the breaking of bread
[34:06] now he's doing the same thing breaking
[34:08] bread eating uh supping with him and
[34:10] opens up their understanding to
[34:12] understand the scriptures and now as
[34:14] this understanding is coming he said
[34:17] unto them all right before I read this
[34:19] next part let's just kind of review
[34:21] where we're at and I know this is
[34:23] combining a lot of stuff that we've been
[34:26] been looking at but we're living in a
[34:28] time when the mercy seat is in plain
[34:30] view Again by the revealed word where
[34:33] Christ has been crucified aresh The
[34:35] Mercy Seat is in plain view and it's now
[34:39] oh God be merciful is the door of Mercy
[34:41] shutting is a Salvation opportunity for
[34:44] salvation's waning so here he is Christ
[34:46] is crucified the word a fresh crucified
[34:49] but yet it is the rising of the sun it's
[34:51] a dark day it's a terrible day but it's
[34:53] the greatest day and there's all these
[34:55] things that we could see that's coming
[34:57] together now we're looking at a similar
[34:58] time in scripture when brother baham
[35:00] said could it be that it's repeating
[35:01] again for the Gentiles they by their
[35:04] Traditions crucified but yet this
[35:06] revealed word which has been crucified
[35:08] exposes that their system is wrong so
[35:11] this is the this is something this is
[35:13] what's happening in that time here in
[35:15] the scripture and it's a parallel we're
[35:17] we're wanting to glean something from it
[35:19] to understand Revelations chapter 3 and
[35:21] these other scriptures for the time that
[35:23] we're living in now even Revelations 10
[35:27] and he says in verse
[35:30] 47 if I said maybe so and he said to
[35:32] them thus it is written and thus it
[35:34] behooved Christ to suffer and to rise
[35:36] from the dead the third day in that
[35:40] repentance and remission of sins should
[35:42] be preached in his name among all
[35:44] nations beginning at
[35:46] Jerusalem so Christ has come he's played
[35:49] done the first part of redemption he's
[35:51] purchased Redemption he's paid the price
[35:54] he's descended to Hell he's unloosed
[35:56] Paradise he ascended up into heaven with
[35:59] those from Paradise presenting himself
[36:01] as the bleeding lamb behind the veil
[36:03] Before the Throne of God be upon the
[36:05] mercy seat and he's declaring that there
[36:08] has been an atonement for sin and
[36:10] because that has happened repentance and
[36:13] remission should be preached you
[36:16] recognize that the very Act of Christ
[36:19] going into heaven and entering Beyond
[36:22] the Veil as it were into the presence of
[36:24] God to present himself as the bleeding
[36:26] lamb which is the atonement for sins
[36:29] that in doing that mankind on Earth
[36:32] didn't all magically become
[36:35] sinless but that repentance and
[36:38] remission should be preached in his name
[36:40] among all nations beginning at Jerusalem
[36:43] and ye are witnesses of these things so
[36:47] now the witness the one who to whom it
[36:49] has become enlightened who seen it as
[36:52] Witnesses he says behold I send the
[36:54] promise of my father upon you but T ye
[36:57] in the city of Jerusalem until you be
[36:59] endued with power from on high right you
[37:04] are
[37:05] witnesses you are the ones who know
[37:08] these things to be true and so now at
[37:10] this critical juncture he says I want
[37:12] you to go back to Jerusalem as he said
[37:14] breathe them said receive you the Holy
[37:16] Ghost you are to receive the holy ghost
[37:18] at Jerusalem and you're going to be
[37:20] endued with power on high and that's
[37:22] going to make you a authoritative
[37:26] Witness amen a witness of the sacrifice
[37:30] of Christ that you can preach repentance
[37:32] and remission among all
[37:35] nations now think of the events of
[37:37] Revelations chapter 3 verses 19 and 20
[37:41] Christ is kicked out of the
[37:42] church but behold I call to you and you
[37:46] hear my voice and you open up and then I
[37:48] begin to Su with you and I begin to make
[37:50] myself known to you what's going to
[37:51] happen as you feed on this word of God
[37:54] he's going to go say I send you right
[37:57] I'm commanding you you have got to go
[38:01] and you have got to say the master is
[38:03] come and call it for thee you've got to
[38:05] point people back to Christ you've got
[38:06] to show them that Christ is real and
[38:10] what happens in Revelations chapter 4
[38:12] the scene opens up and what do we see in
[38:13] that throne room what happens in that
[38:16] Throne Room John's caught up to it what
[38:17] is he witnessing the book becoming
[38:19] open the book in Revelations 10 there's
[38:23] this these parallels taking place to
[38:27] Christ now commanding and commissioning
[38:30] his disciples whosoever sins you remit
[38:33] they are remitted whosoever sins you
[38:34] retain they are retained this is what
[38:36] John says but in Luke he's saying go to
[38:38] Jerusalem you'll be endued with power
[38:40] from on high that repentance and
[38:41] remission of sins should be preached in
[38:43] his name among all nations beginning at
[38:45] Jerusalem this is on that day where he's
[38:48] telling them this is what you're uh to
[38:50] do this is what you're called to do and
[38:52] so Christ is going to remain with them
[38:54] convincing them and assuring them of
[38:56] this promise so as we could read in
[38:58] other places in Matthew and Mark and
[39:00] then in Matthew chapter
[39:02] 16 I want to just bring these scriptures
[39:05] in here and I'm I'm oh I'm running out
[39:08] of time maybe I'll just refer to these
[39:10] very quickly when Christ says uh who do
[39:13] men say that I am well some say you're
[39:14] this some say you're that and Peter says
[39:15] th the Christ the son of living God and
[39:18] Jesus says Flesh and Blood hath not
[39:19] revealed this to you but my Father which
[39:21] is in heaven hath revealed this this is
[39:23] Matthew 16 and he says Upon This Rock
[39:25] the revelation of myself I will build my
[39:28] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[39:30] Prevail against it and I will give unto
[39:32] thee yes
[39:35] Peter uh the Keys of the Kingdom of
[39:38] Heaven now this is just not to Peter
[39:41] alone but it's according to this
[39:42] Revelation but we do find that it's
[39:44] Peter on the day of Pentecost who's
[39:45] preaching this inaugural sermon I'm
[39:46] going to give the key to you the Keys of
[39:48] the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever
[39:50] Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound
[39:52] in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt
[39:53] loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven
[39:56] now there's there's a direct connection
[39:58] to what Jesus is saying in John chapter
[39:59] 20 in Luke chapter 24 to what he's
[40:02] telling Peter you're going to be given
[40:04] the Keys of the Kingdom and there's
[40:07] going to be power of this key to bind
[40:10] and to loose and brother brandham says
[40:12] in the church book it's a very
[40:13] remarkable statement this is just
[40:15] finding maybe how it might fit in and
[40:18] and and so I'm not going to read the
[40:19] whole thing but he says you know the
[40:20] church has gotten to a place where all
[40:21] they have is the power of
[40:23] loosing and so there can be a loosing
[40:25] there can be a Deliverance but the power
[40:27] finding is
[40:28] gone so we can exercise in part A
[40:31] Certain Optics to the message and to the
[40:33] word of God but the fullness of this key
[40:36] is both to bind and to loose and the
[40:39] power binding being loosed he says here
[40:40] Thou shalt bind on Earth it will be
[40:43] bound in heaven whatsoever is loosed on
[40:45] Earth is loosed in heaven because that's
[40:46] the Keys of the Kingdom gives you power
[40:48] to bind and loose on Earth and it's
[40:50] reflected in heaven he repeats it again
[40:53] in Matthew 18:18 verily I say unto you
[40:54] whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall
[40:56] be bound in heaven and whatsoever you
[40:57] shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in
[40:59] heaven what happens on the day of
[41:01] Pentecost Christ comes into his church
[41:03] Christ is now the house of God Christ is
[41:06] now or the church is now the house of
[41:09] God the dwelling place of God and they
[41:10] are
[41:11] witnesses and as he had been sent by the
[41:13] father Christ is now sending the church
[41:15] with a commission so look at the
[41:17] commission I'm just going to revisit
[41:18] again peace John 20: 21 and 23 peace be
[41:22] unto you as my father hath sent me even
[41:24] so I send you and when he said this he
[41:26] breathed on them and say and say to them
[41:29] receive ye the Holy Ghost this is what
[41:31] they receive in Acts chap in the book of
[41:33] Acts the spirit descends upon him this
[41:36] is the Keys of the Kingdom this is
[41:38] Christ himself this is the promise of
[41:40] the father all these things come he says
[41:42] whosoever sins you remit they are
[41:44] remitted unto them and whosoever sins
[41:46] you retain they are
[41:49] retained that sounds a whole lot like
[41:51] Mercy to
[41:54] me now I'm just going to read you three
[41:56] statements there's a
[41:57] over a dozen probably where brother bam
[41:59] deals with this but in the sermon whyatt
[42:00] had to be Shepherd but let's watch how
[42:03] he did it because the conversation was
[42:05] with a Catholic priest and says well the
[42:07] Bible says you can it's powers given to
[42:09] remit sins and retain them and so if I
[42:12] could maybe put this in context of some
[42:14] of the controversies if you begin to
[42:16] talk about well the day of Mercy is over
[42:18] because there's this has happened and
[42:19] people think well there's no more Mercy
[42:21] because there's no more blood well you
[42:23] have to understand dispensations and
[42:25] Seasons you say when God God is no
[42:27] longer above us yep God's no longer
[42:30] above you no he was with you amen God's
[42:33] still with them and even down to the
[42:35] church ages is God in us and the Son of
[42:37] God revealed himself and then he say oh
[42:39] well we've entered the dispensation of
[42:40] the son of man he's no longer in the
[42:42] church and so oh well then he's not
[42:43] above us he's not in us he's like no he
[42:45] is us right there there's a point where
[42:48] we're coming to this climactic finishing
[42:50] so it's a it's a matter of understanding
[42:53] uh the promise for your day the promise
[42:54] of your hour and someone say wow then
[42:57] the mercy is in the bride the bride is
[42:58] The Mercy Seat and then we take it to
[43:00] mean the bride is actually Christ who
[43:02] shed her blood and it's her bleeding
[43:04] it's her bleeding a and you got to come
[43:07] to the bride to get salvation and
[43:09] believe in the bride and lay your hands
[43:10] on the bride and you just start to make
[43:12] a mess of things trying to figure it all
[43:15] out and so it is true but watch how this
[43:19] Mercy Works how do we become this Mercy
[43:22] in the end time he said but so the
[43:24] Catholic priest says well the priest
[43:25] remit sins and brother Ram said well
[43:27] that's the the scripture is true but
[43:29] let's watch how they remitted sins but
[43:33] let's watch how he did it how the
[43:35] apostles followed out this order not
[43:37] according to the way that the priests do
[43:38] it today but what did the first priest
[43:41] if you want to call him that Peter that
[43:43] had the Keys of the Kingdom how did he
[43:45] do it how did he remit
[43:47] sins Jesus said repentance remission of
[43:50] sins should be
[43:51] preached in the name of Jesus Christ and
[43:55] in John it says whosoever s you remit
[43:57] they shall be remitted and whosoever you
[43:59] retain they shall be retained there is a
[44:03] these stains are essentially the same
[44:06] thing preach repentance and
[44:09] remission and brother Bram says he said
[44:11] repent every one of you be baptized in
[44:13] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[44:14] remission of sins and you shall receive
[44:15] the gift of the Holy Ghost see see how
[44:17] these scriptures start to dovetail so
[44:19] when Peter came and preached on the day
[44:21] of Pentecost he could go right back to
[44:23] this personal audience with Christ he
[44:25] could go right back to the community
[44:27] table he could go right back to the
[44:29] feasting and know I've got to re preach
[44:32] repentance for the remission of sins I
[44:35] I've got to I've got I've been commanded
[44:37] for this because now power is in my hand
[44:40] to bind and to loose and there's power
[44:43] in this word and this commission to
[44:45] retain or to
[44:46] remit
[44:51] amen so you shall receive the gift of
[44:53] the Holy Ghost for the promises to you
[44:54] and to your children to them that are
[44:55] far off even as many as the Lord Our God
[44:57] should call and if God is still calling
[44:59] the same experiences for you if you'll
[45:01] follow the same PR prescription if this
[45:03] congregation believes that with your
[45:05] heads bowed say Amen he's just
[45:07] transition he says then anything short
[45:09] of that is contrary to the word and not
[45:12] according to the
[45:13] shepherd anything short of that do you
[45:16] realize now why there is such a
[45:18] tremendous controversy over the
[45:21] godhead and that God is
[45:24] one and he was revealed in his son Jesus
[45:27] Christ and that the the name that were
[45:30] to be baptized is not titles of Father
[45:32] Son and Holy Ghost but in the name of
[45:34] Jesus Christ and you do you want to know
[45:36] what it used to be explicit this way in
[45:39] like the book of Cults the metric you
[45:41] would follow to determine whether or not
[45:42] someone was in a cult is first do they
[45:44] baptize in the name of the father Son
[45:46] and Holy Ghost do they deny the Trinity
[45:48] and if yes
[45:49] cult and then you get to degrees of
[45:51] Cults I guess but the very fact that you
[45:54] don't hold to the the the the trinity
[45:57] Aran Dogma or Creed put you outside of
[46:00] that denominational
[46:03] fellowship and so brother Brown said if
[46:06] you this is a narrowing down of things
[46:08] this is a you got to come back to this
[46:11] and I would say according to the
[46:12] scripture that if you are baptizing in
[46:15] the name of the father and the Son and
[46:16] the Holy Ghost you are in air according
[46:19] to the word of
[46:21] God contrary to the word brother
[46:25] brandham says it in the sign of his
[46:27] coming Philip was sent to the unic
[46:29] certainly Lord he was sent there by an
[46:31] Angel but it took Philip's
[46:33] hands we realize a vision come to Paul
[46:35] on his road to Damascus but it took
[46:37] anas's hands you listen to this we've
[46:40] gone through Paul's experience in some
[46:42] detail the church the called out the
[46:43] elected one Peter was sent by Vision up
[46:45] to Cornelius but it took the
[46:48] Apostle listen not the vision not the
[46:54] angel recognize that there were players
[46:57] in that day when the vision had come the
[47:01] angel had come but there had to be ones
[47:03] on earth now could you imagine if we
[47:06] said in that day that after Christ had
[47:08] appeared to Peter and the rest of them
[47:10] on the uh through that season and then
[47:11] on the day of Pentecost gives them the
[47:13] Seal of the Holy Ghost say stop the tape
[47:16] at that moment the only ones who are
[47:18] saved who have the Holy Ghost are those
[47:20] who were there in that little room
[47:22] that's it only ones historically
[47:25] accurate
[47:28] the only ones that could preach
[47:30] it right like where else were you going
[47:32] to get it even a paulus is preaching a
[47:35] lot of things on John the Baptist but he
[47:38] doesn't know the he can't preach the
[47:40] full truth he can't preach the revealed
[47:41] word and what did it take Believers to
[47:45] expound on him a more excellent
[47:48] way he said it took the Apostle not the
[47:50] vision not the Angel God I pray tonight
[47:52] that you'll wake people up and let them
[47:55] see the promises here amen it was given
[47:58] to that church whosoever sends you remit
[48:00] to them they they are remitted Lord we
[48:03] know there's many of them claim it but
[48:05] they're unauthorized Apostles because
[48:08] they are
[48:10] unscriptural you cannot you can't just
[48:12] take the scripture say well this is what
[48:13] I'm going to do you have to be
[48:17] authorized it took Philip's hands an
[48:21] anas's hands took Peter to Cornelius
[48:25] there's a vision there's an angel but it
[48:26] had it took the people to wake
[48:29] up and then it in the sermon it is the
[48:31] rising of the
[48:33] sun that's that divine revelation of the
[48:36] word was made flesh it was if it was
[48:39] flesh in that day by the son the
[48:42] groom it's the flesh today by the
[48:46] bride right you can start building a lot
[48:48] of things in from that sermon into this
[48:50] very point if it was flesh
[48:53] then in that day by the son the
[48:56] bridegroom
[48:58] the divine revelation of the word made
[48:59] flesh it's these are my the Divine word
[49:03] the divine revelation of the word made
[49:05] flesh by the bride yeah and the very
[49:09] next scripture he
[49:11] reads John 20 whosoever sins you remit
[49:14] to them they are remitted whosoever sins
[49:16] you retain to them they are
[49:18] retained
[49:21] H now the Catholic Church pick that up
[49:24] and takes it to their priest but that's
[49:25] carnal right watch it was the spiritual
[49:28] revealed word that did it that's the
[49:31] reason he told them to go baptize in the
[49:33] name of the father Son and Holy Ghost he
[49:35] knew they knew who he
[49:37] was he knew they knew who he was there
[49:41] takes a revelation of who he was and
[49:43] those who are eyewitnesses those to whom
[49:46] he reveals himself too they are under a
[49:48] commandment they have a burden to what
[49:51] to tell who he
[49:55] is it's a spiritual re revealed word
[49:58] that did it to not only make himself
[49:59] known to you behold I stand at the door
[50:01] and knock that's you Lord come in Su
[50:03] with me come into me enlighten me become
[50:06] part of me rise to life inside of me and
[50:09] the Revelation is you are now the bear
[50:11] of my presence you are now dressed in
[50:13] the bleeding bloody word you are an
[50:16] Avenue and a channel to Mercy because
[50:19] you are and you have the voice of truth
[50:22] if you don't live this accurately people
[50:24] won't see the lamb if you don't speak
[50:26] this accurately people won't see the
[50:28] lamb that's why we got to come back to
[50:30] Holiness that's why the Bible teaches
[50:32] things about the way the men act and the
[50:34] women
[50:36] dress what even happened to Paul after
[50:39] he was Christ revealed himself to him
[50:41] after Christ revealed himself and he
[50:43] knew his life was changing who are you
[50:45] Lord and he said I am
[50:48] Jesus and it's at that moment that Paul
[50:51] is like oh no I have made a huge mistake
[50:55] whom thou persecutest
[50:58] and Paul realizes man I've been ignorant
[50:59] I've been a murderer and I there could
[51:01] have been such fear coming on him in
[51:02] that moment he can't see anymore he's
[51:04] like I'm a dead man think of the zealots
[51:07] and just how they would have felt how
[51:08] they followed after these things and
[51:10] murdered people and killed people Zeal
[51:12] the house is eating me up I'm in the
[51:14] order of Pinos I'm going to murder I'm
[51:16] going to kill in the name of the Lord
[51:17] I'm going to stay the plague and then
[51:18] God say you're sticking the javelin
[51:20] right through me you're murdering me and
[51:25] Paul thought man the those under the law
[51:27] they're stoned they were killed I'm
[51:29] guilty eye for an eye a tooth for a
[51:31] tooth I took this man's life I'm guilty
[51:34] of life I I'm going to die and what
[51:35] happened God says go to Damascus I'm
[51:37] going to send somebody I'm G to speak to
[51:39] you and Paul's there praying God gives
[51:40] him a vision ananas comes it's ananas
[51:42] hands Paul repents then God says in Acts
[51:45] 26:16 God speaking to Paul but arise and
[51:48] stand upon thy feet for I have appeared
[51:50] unto thee for this purpose what's the
[51:52] purpose of the opening what's the
[51:54] purpose of the revealing to make thee a
[51:55] minister and a wit
[51:57] both of these things which thou has seen
[51:58] and those things in the which I will
[52:00] appear unto
[52:02] thee a minister sure certainly a
[52:04] five-fold gift is implied here and to
[52:07] anyone who AIDS another in a work a help
[52:11] meat a witness one that's bearing record
[52:14] he was a witness of God's glory of
[52:17] things revealed to be revealed he says
[52:20] those things what you have seen and
[52:21] those things I will reveal to you this
[52:23] is a pattern of what happens today when
[52:25] Christ becomes real to you you become a
[52:28] minister and a
[52:29] witness you are a witness of these
[52:32] things so we are to testify of these
[52:52] things in second
[52:54] Peter 1: 16 and
[52:57] 18 Peter one of these eyewitnesses says
[53:00] we have not followed cly devised fables
[53:02] we made known unto you the power and
[53:04] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we
[53:07] were eyewitnesses of his
[53:10] majesty for we received from God the
[53:12] Father honor and
[53:15] Glory I apologize for he received from
[53:18] God the Father honor and Glory now it's
[53:20] Mount Transfiguration what was this a
[53:22] rehearsal a
[53:23] preview significant uh pattern in
[53:26] symbolism here in this event when there
[53:29] came such a voice to him from the
[53:30] excellent Glory this is my beloved Son
[53:32] in whom I'm well pleased and this voice
[53:35] which came from heaven we heard when we
[53:37] were with him in the Holy
[53:40] Mount now what is the attraction on the
[53:43] mountain now who is this
[53:46] smdc just as the disciples were
[53:48] eyewitnesses of his majesty and of the
[53:50] voice of Mercy we have a voice
[53:53] today just as they were uh following in
[53:56] Christ and being taught by Christ they
[53:58] come to this uh I want to just say
[54:00] climactic season just so much activity
[54:02] happening in a short period of time
[54:04] where their Lord and Master is crucified
[54:06] and he's buried and they're scared and
[54:08] they're frightful and they don't know
[54:09] what's going to happen but he appears to
[54:11] them on that Resurrection morning and he
[54:13] begins to make himself known to them and
[54:15] the breaking of bread begins to commune
[54:17] with them and fellowship in the
[54:18] resurrection in the and the after math
[54:21] of a crucifixion there is a resurrection
[54:24] and there is a divine presence of the
[54:26] son with his Believers and with his
[54:28] children and there he's communing with
[54:30] them behind closed doors there he's
[54:32] making himself known and supping and
[54:34] it's an image that behold I stand at the
[54:36] door and knock I have been pushed out of
[54:38] the church I've been crucified aresh but
[54:41] I am here it is the rising of the sun
[54:43] I'm here to come into you to rise to
[54:46] life and to being and the bride and
[54:48] there will be a feast and there will be
[54:49] a communion and the breaking of bread
[54:51] and what has he whispered to us what is
[54:53] he telling us take eat Take and Eat and
[54:56] as we're eating cuz notice he's there
[54:58] eating broiled fish and honeycomb and as
[55:00] he's eating he's saiding as the father
[55:01] sent me so I send you and we're thinking
[55:04] oh man I I thought this was it I thought
[55:05] it was going to be over now he's like no
[55:07] no no you got a job to
[55:08] do and and and I'm I'm going to send the
[55:11] promise of the father you're going to be
[55:12] a dude with power from on high and
[55:14] you're going to be Witnesses and you are
[55:16] going to be the one that preaches
[55:17] repentance and
[55:20] remission what does the Bible say in
[55:22] Revelations 10:1 I'm just drawing on the
[55:25] fact that I know I'm speaking to
[55:26] well-taught Believers today take the
[55:29] book and eat it and he said unto me thou
[55:31] must prophesy again before many peoples
[55:33] and Nations and tongues and
[55:36] Kings whenever there's a meal whenever
[55:38] there's a feast whenever there's a
[55:39] partaking you become what you eat is one
[55:41] way that we say it and there's this
[55:43] speaking out there's this commission
[55:45] this commanding you must go preach
[55:48] brother B took it in the rising of the
[55:50] Sun and said the bride today who is him
[55:52] is to be those who have this power of
[55:55] REM sins and the remission of sins and
[55:58] how was it it's the spiritual revelation
[56:00] of the word that gives you that power
[56:02] and it's not you that has the power is
[56:04] the revealed word that you hold that is
[56:07] the power that's how you have it he said
[56:09] watch how they do it he says it in
[56:11] several
[56:12] places the ministers who are here that
[56:14] have studied these things out can point
[56:16] you right in the message of the hour the
[56:17] other places where brother M using this
[56:19] scripture saying look this power to
[56:21] remit was in the church by the preaching
[56:23] of the word not halfth truth
[56:26] right but the full
[56:29] word brother said she is flesh of his
[56:32] flesh bone of his
[56:34] bone and you think flesh and blood bone
[56:37] bone Flesh Blood bone You' think all
[56:38] these things but he doesn't say blood he
[56:40] says life of his life power of his power
[56:44] where is the life it's in the blood amen
[56:48] so it's the life life of his life we
[56:50] embod that element which the blood was
[56:53] symbolic of life
[56:57] I've been an hour right at this point or
[56:59] maybe 59 minutes but I I'm instead of
[57:02] asking for permission or apologizing I'm
[57:04] just informing us all that I've got just
[57:07] a one more long scripture couple
[57:09] scripture readings to read and then
[57:10] we'll be
[57:12] done notice this in Revelation excuse me
[57:15] Romans chapter 9: 22- 26 then we'll skip
[57:17] to chapter 11 just want to read through
[57:19] this and recognize how that we now as
[57:23] Christ life and power have become
[57:28] this
[57:29] voice of repentance and
[57:33] remission that if the word preached is
[57:36] rejected those sins are
[57:38] retained the word received and believed
[57:40] those sins are remitted now we're not
[57:42] the ones doing the to remit right we're
[57:45] not burning candles and those different
[57:47] things but there's a a word preached
[57:50] repentance and remission has to be
[57:51] preached among all nations and they had
[57:53] to be sent out to preach it so what do
[57:54] they become this is the way
[57:57] the truth the life being
[57:59] preached now is a a perfect parallel or
[58:02] just laying on top of these things that
[58:04] we've already ministered so far you
[58:05] could see such an incredible uh overlap
[58:09] now because the Jews having rejected him
[58:11] and the Gentiles be brought in uh raises
[58:13] a lot of questions it says what if God
[58:15] willing to show his wrath and to make
[58:16] his power known endured with much
[58:19] longsuffering the vessels of Wrath
[58:20] fitted to
[58:22] destruction quite a supposition and that
[58:25] he might make known The Riches of his
[58:27] glory on the vessels of Mercy vessels of
[58:30] Wrath vessels of Mercy which he had a
[58:33] prepared unto
[58:35] Glory even us whom he hath called not of
[58:37] the Jews only but also of the Gentiles I
[58:40] know there's a lot lot there that he's
[58:42] saying as he said also in Hosea I will
[58:45] call them my people which were not my
[58:47] people and her beloved which was not
[58:49] beloved
[58:51] Gentiles and it shall come to pass that
[58:53] in that the place where it was said unto
[58:55] them ye are not not my
[58:57] people there shall they be called the
[59:00] children of the Living
[59:03] God this is the Gentile bride the
[59:07] Gentile church this is Believers that
[59:09] are chosen and elected by God and
[59:11] they're are vessels of Wrath which are
[59:13] subject to destruction but then he says
[59:16] that God will make known The Riches of
[59:18] his glory on vessels of Mercy a vessel
[59:22] is a chosen
[59:23] instrument a a a vessel is a one that is
[59:27] an assistant or one that helps assist in
[59:30] accomplishing something now I want you
[59:33] to think about these vessels of Mercy as
[59:35] being more than ones upon which his
[59:38] Mercy is shed but rather he says that
[59:41] they upon which he'll pour out the
[59:43] riches of his glory on vessels of Merc
[59:46] Mercy which he prepared unto Glory but
[59:48] what you contain and what you hold and
[59:51] what you become a bear of and what you
[59:53] become an instrument of is an instrument
[59:56] instument of
[59:59] Mercy that's why ananas could lay his
[1:00:02] hands on him that's why Cornelius could
[1:00:05] that's why that's why you could find
[1:00:06] Peter going why because they were
[1:00:08] vessels of
[1:00:11] Mercy life of his life the life is in
[1:00:14] the blood the bride has the
[1:00:19] token and in Romans chapter
[1:00:22] 11 Brothers you can get you can just get
[1:00:24] ready on your instruments Romans 11:
[1:00:27] 25-33 for I would not Brethren that you
[1:00:29] should be ignorant of this mystery lest
[1:00:32] you should be wise in your own conceits
[1:00:34] that the blindness in part is happened
[1:00:35] to Israel and the fullness of the
[1:00:37] Gentiles become come in and so all
[1:00:40] Israel shall be saved as it written
[1:00:41] there shall come out of Zion the
[1:00:43] deliverer and shall turn away
[1:00:45] ungodliness from Jacob for this is my
[1:00:47] Covenant unto them when I shall take
[1:00:50] away their sins as concerning the gospel
[1:00:53] they are enemies for your sakes but as
[1:00:55] touching the election they are beloved
[1:00:57] for the father's sakes there's again
[1:00:59] this is this this division now that is
[1:01:02] transpired where the Jews having
[1:01:04] rejected
[1:01:05] Christ and the Gentiles which are
[1:01:08] receiving Christ and and to the to the
[1:01:11] Jews It's Kind like who invited you to
[1:01:12] our party you know now you're claiming
[1:01:15] to be the one and you know there's a
[1:01:17] it's kind of remarkable as one brother
[1:01:19] said to me recently he said that you
[1:01:21] know the Jews are Antichrist I was like
[1:01:22] well qu quite literally right they
[1:01:25] crucified it but you got to be careful
[1:01:28] because there's this sometimes a
[1:01:29] demonization there's anti-semites in the
[1:01:32] message what they've done is they've
[1:01:34] latched onto a lot of right-wing
[1:01:36] rhetoric and and their Holocaust
[1:01:39] apologizers and
[1:01:41] deniers be careful the things you're
[1:01:42] feeding on seeps in very very subtly and
[1:01:46] it's it's completely perverting Romans
[1:01:48] 11 because Paul just say they're all
[1:01:51] Antichrist right and saying you know
[1:01:53] what we should do we should just we
[1:01:55] should kill them all that's probably a
[1:01:56] good idea you know cuz after all we kind
[1:01:58] of compete with them
[1:02:00] economically but Paul says no no no no
[1:02:02] no no no and he says verse 29 for gifts
[1:02:06] and callings of God are without
[1:02:08] repentance you don't have to say sorry
[1:02:09] for being gifted you don't have to
[1:02:11] repent or apologize for a calling and
[1:02:14] notice he says
[1:02:16] this and and I'm just saying that in
[1:02:18] there is the the levels of
[1:02:19] interpretation on that are very rich but
[1:02:21] he says verse 30 for as ye in times past
[1:02:24] have not believed God
[1:02:26] yet have now obtained Mercy through
[1:02:28] their
[1:02:29] unbelief you
[1:02:31] listening even so have these also now
[1:02:34] not
[1:02:35] believed that through your
[1:02:37] mercy they also May obtain
[1:02:42] Mercy put yourself in the place of the
[1:02:45] scripture
[1:02:46] today that those who have not
[1:02:49] believed that we might find it very easy
[1:02:52] to rail against Revelation 317 is naked
[1:02:54] blind reject blasphemers and all sorts
[1:02:57] of things that we might say Kill Them
[1:02:59] All to recognize that in times past we
[1:03:02] did not
[1:03:03] believe but yet obtained Mercy ignorant
[1:03:07] blasphemers injurious should have known
[1:03:10] better even so these also now that do
[1:03:13] not believe through your mercy through
[1:03:16] vessels of Mercy May obtain Mercy for
[1:03:19] God ha concluded that all in unbelief
[1:03:21] concluded them all in unbelief that he
[1:03:23] might have mercy upon all oh the depth
[1:03:27] of the riches of the wisdom and
[1:03:29] knowledge of God how unsearchable are
[1:03:31] his judgments and his ways pass finding
[1:03:34] now oh hallelujah what I want to be is
[1:03:37] one that walks in the depth of these
[1:03:39] Riches of the wisdom of the knowledge of
[1:03:41] God how unsearchable are his judgments
[1:03:43] and his ways pass finding now not that I
[1:03:46] would condemn not that I would banish to
[1:03:48] hell but that I could be a vessel of
[1:03:50] mercy so That Others May obtain
[1:03:53] Mercy in their ignorance in their
[1:03:55] unbelief yes especially
[1:03:59] so brother random says in the unveiling
[1:04:01] of God you're templ in Christ that's
[1:04:03] behind the
[1:04:04] veil the veil again in human flesh hides
[1:04:07] God the word from the
[1:04:09] unbeliever okay all right it hides the
[1:04:13] word of God from the unbeliever the veil
[1:04:16] does there's the house of the
[1:04:18] Lord in behind the veil is the shikina
[1:04:21] of Glory in behind the veil is the
[1:04:23] presence of God he's saying you are
[1:04:24] templ in Christ you have become that
[1:04:27] Dwelling Place The Throne of God is in
[1:04:29] the heart of man and he's hidden from
[1:04:32] the
[1:04:34] unbeliever he's hidden in the Simplicity
[1:04:37] of The Believer from the
[1:04:40] unbeliever and if he's hid in the
[1:04:42] Simplicity of the
[1:04:44] believer to those to whom he is hidden
[1:04:47] how is he going to reveal
[1:04:50] himself God reveals himself in the
[1:04:53] same in the simplicity
[1:04:56] of the
[1:04:58] believer he Veil brother man said he
[1:05:00] veils himself today in earn vessels with
[1:05:03] the
[1:05:04] shakina the outside looks like a bunch
[1:05:07] of Holy Rollers old Badger skins but the
[1:05:09] inside hides the shikina
[1:05:13] glory
[1:05:16] we we better wrestle out what this looks
[1:05:22] like because the Bible says in
[1:05:23] Revelations 22:7 and the spirit and the
[1:05:27] bride say come that's a voice of Mercy
[1:05:32] amen let him that
[1:05:35] hear say come am you notice what's
[1:05:39] happening the spirit and the bride speak
[1:05:42] and then one whose ear hears the voice
[1:05:44] he's speaking the same thing and let him
[1:05:46] that a thirst come and whosoever will
[1:05:47] let him take the Water of Life
[1:05:51] freely God give us the grace to
[1:05:53] recognize our place in this hour is a
[1:05:55] voice of
[1:05:57] Mercy these scriptures are very
[1:06:00] beautiful Ro Romans 9 and Romans 11 but
[1:06:04] I want to connect them together now as
[1:06:05] we close that you are vessels of
[1:06:08] Mercy that through Mercy they may obtain
[1:06:13] Mercy you realize the Bible teaches and
[1:06:15] we kind of had left some of these things
[1:06:17] out as we're just maybe wrapping up this
[1:06:18] portion on Mercy Wednesday night we have
[1:06:20] a little bit more to finish on the voice
[1:06:21] of Mercy Lord willing but how the Bible
[1:06:24] says that if you you do not show Mercy
[1:06:27] you won't obtain it you won't receive
[1:06:31] it and that it be something just to dig
[1:06:35] into on causation and correlation and
[1:06:38] someone who doesn't show Mercy will not
[1:06:41] receive
[1:06:41] Mercy now if we just kind of inverted or
[1:06:44] we kind of took it apart to figure out
[1:06:46] how it works could it be that those who
[1:06:48] don't show it have never obtained it
[1:06:51] anyways they've never received it
[1:06:53] they've never accepted it and that's why
[1:06:55] they so hard for them to give it and it
[1:06:57] raises the question of the parable and
[1:06:59] why it's there that the one who's
[1:07:01] forgiven and oh I've made a Mist I I
[1:07:03] can't pay and the the judge the J judge
[1:07:05] says the master says I forgive you and
[1:07:07] the Very one who is Forgiven turns right
[1:07:10] around and is very harsh and punishing
[1:07:13] and won't show mercy and so what does
[1:07:14] the the master do say whoa wait a minute
[1:07:18] hold
[1:07:19] on you've missed it you've perverted my
[1:07:23] Justice you've perverted my Mercy
[1:07:26] let us not be those that have received
[1:07:28] such a great grace in this hour and a
[1:07:29] great Mercy let us not be guilty of not
[1:07:32] showing Mercy how quickly we cut people
[1:07:35] off how quickly we can become so
[1:07:37] stubborn and OBS how quickly we can
[1:07:40] judge and maybe sometimes it's not from
[1:07:43] that place of judgment and harshness
[1:07:45] maybe sometimes it's a place of great
[1:07:46] hurt and
[1:07:48] discouragement but let us not lose
[1:07:52] hope that we are
[1:07:56] as
[1:07:57] Christians his beloved his elect his
[1:07:59] Dwelling Place his voice on
[1:08:01] Earth Christians are the dwelling place
[1:08:04] of
[1:08:07] God and maybe I could just share this
[1:08:09] now I was sharing this with brother El
[1:08:11] eer when we're fellowshipping Wednesday
[1:08:12] night I believe that's when it was and
[1:08:14] how that the very fact that the holy the
[1:08:17] glory of God this is kind of go the
[1:08:19] presence of God is the Holy Ghost just
[1:08:22] swiftly departing it's leaving
[1:08:25] it's almost as if it's withdrawn itself
[1:08:27] from the the Earth and when the the the
[1:08:30] bride I say bride but when the believer
[1:08:33] when those who have been sealed with the
[1:08:34] Holy Ghost are resurrected and the and
[1:08:37] those that are alive and remain are
[1:08:38] changed in a moment at twink ey we call
[1:08:40] that the Rapture when that happens and
[1:08:42] we meet the Lord in the air those that
[1:08:44] are left behind cannot be
[1:08:47] saved there's no more salvation
[1:08:50] right so when the bride's gone there's
[1:08:54] no more salvation yeah when the bride's
[1:08:56] gone there's no more Voice of Truth when
[1:08:58] the bride's gone there's no more voice
[1:09:00] of Mercy that do I mean you say well
[1:09:02] brother and there correlation okay all
[1:09:05] right let's
[1:09:06] correlate when you're gone there can't
[1:09:09] be
[1:09:10] anymore and all they could do is pretend
[1:09:12] to worship and fully on worshiping Satan
[1:09:15] and it's at that time that those who
[1:09:17] have confessed him those who have
[1:09:18] believed in him who had not received the
[1:09:20] the guarantee of the Resurrection they
[1:09:22] better hold fast because they'll have to
[1:09:24] seal their Testament their own blood
[1:09:26] to be saved at White Throne so as long
[1:09:29] as we're here let's believe let's
[1:09:31] believe there can be Soul saved I was
[1:09:34] reading how brother bradam said oh God
[1:09:35] be merciful to us and as we see our
[1:09:38] churches and our full gospel groups
[1:09:39] begin to cool down it seems like there's
[1:09:41] no great crying for Life lost souls
[1:09:44] there's no more that sincere all night
[1:09:45] prayer meditation in the word and it
[1:09:47] seems like that we've just drifted Lord
[1:09:50] forgive us oh God let us renew ourselves
[1:09:53] tonight a fresh in the Holy Spirit
[1:09:56] I I I feel that Satan attacks these
[1:09:59] truths so
[1:10:01] tremendously and he says and tonight it
[1:10:03] seems like we can dress nice and sit
[1:10:05] down and
[1:10:06] listen and go home
[1:10:09] unconcerned and as we're listening we're
[1:10:11] like I'm glad he said
[1:10:15] tonight he says oh Lord stir our hearts
[1:10:18] tonight I'm going to change it and today
[1:10:21] it seems like we can dress nice and sit
[1:10:23] down and listen and go home UNC
[1:10:24] unconcerned oh Lord stir our stir our
[1:10:26] hearts today put a Zeal in us for lost
[1:10:32] souls May ministers and the Ley every
[1:10:34] person becomeing a part of the kingdom
[1:10:36] and with a burning desire that we that
[1:10:38] we'd canvas cities and everywhere and
[1:10:40] pull the Lost out of the gutters and get
[1:10:42] them as fire brands for the
[1:10:47] lord it's not a bunch of bingo swimming
[1:10:49] contest and bunch of
[1:10:53] nonsense we can't be guilty
[1:10:55] uh of of what some Protestants
[1:10:59] trinitarians just get them to say a
[1:11:02] say and have a mantra we're just trying
[1:11:04] to get him to Christ we're just trying
[1:11:06] to get him to Christ well you won't be
[1:11:07] able to do that by watering down the
[1:11:10] word you know by saying well do you
[1:11:13] believe in
[1:11:15] God and do you believe in Jesus and will
[1:11:19] you accept Jesus as your personal Savior
[1:11:22] and they go yes
[1:11:25] you're saved I've LED you to
[1:11:29] Christ get God
[1:11:31] happy and it's kind of like you walk
[1:11:33] away thinking what was
[1:11:36] that let's be real with it let's wrestle
[1:11:38] it out let's figure it out let's find a
[1:11:42] way as we we read before like God help
[1:11:44] me to figure out how I wish I could
[1:11:46] remember just exactly how brother BR
[1:11:47] said it like how can we accurately
[1:11:49] portray this gospel tell me Lord how to
[1:11:51] reach these lost souls tell me how to to
[1:11:53] be a witness in this hour amen and and I
[1:11:57] realize there's a lot of things that
[1:11:58] brother bam says in the scripture that
[1:11:59] certainly uh challenges the church
[1:12:01] because it talks about churches no
[1:12:02] longer having all night prayer meetings
[1:12:05] well how many have we had in the last
[1:12:06] four
[1:12:08] years
[1:12:10] none right here we haven't had an all
[1:12:12] night prayer meeting and you say well is
[1:12:14] that what it takes okay fine we could do
[1:12:16] that
[1:12:17] but what are we praying for what's our
[1:12:20] premise what's our what's our goal what
[1:12:21] are we trying to accomplish you want to
[1:12:23] invite a sinner to an all night prayer
[1:12:24] meeting they're going to take a
[1:12:26] nap you got to find a way God help us
[1:12:30] help us Lord to be accurate Reflections
[1:12:32] I'm not saying that we shouldn't have an
[1:12:33] all night prayer meeting I'm not saying
[1:12:34] that a Believer couldn't get saved there
[1:12:36] but we've got to find the channel that
[1:12:38] God can work in to Canvas to reach out
[1:12:41] to
[1:12:43] shine God help us today you are the
[1:12:45] Temple of
[1:12:47] Christ I believe that you are the ones
[1:12:49] that can be merciful just take it into
[1:12:51] our own personal relationships with
[1:12:52] other people that I am a throne I am the
[1:12:55] Throne of judgment and the Throne of
[1:12:57] Mercy what Avenue do you want to choose
[1:13:00] you want to choose to look at your uh
[1:13:02] your children or your other believers
[1:13:03] you want to look at them Through The
[1:13:04] Eyes of judgment or Through The Eyes of
[1:13:06] grace and mercy as the Bible said that
[1:13:09] God was
[1:13:10] longsuffering God waited even those with
[1:13:12] the unbelievers and it's actually
[1:13:14] through that longsuffering that others
[1:13:15] were brought into the precious promise
[1:13:17] and Grace then I want to be
[1:13:19] longsuffering and God help us to be
[1:13:22] better better voices amen amen and I I
[1:13:27] say this from my heart I believe Satan
[1:13:31] is fighting this this truth with
[1:13:33] everything that's in
[1:13:35] him and if I can say as I've experienced
[1:13:38] the the fight and the devil fighting
[1:13:40] against this over the last while that
[1:13:43] maybe the notion is move on just just
[1:13:46] make your life a little bit easier but I
[1:13:48] I want to be a I want to be faithful to
[1:13:50] say that God has called us to a special
[1:13:53] place in this hour in don't
[1:13:56] faint don't withdraw no matter what
[1:13:58] happens no matter what comes no matter
[1:14:00] what's said and what's done stay
[1:14:03] faithful because you are the bearers of
[1:14:05] God's presence it's not one it's not a
[1:14:07] oneman Ministry it's not a church name
[1:14:09] it's not it's not in the fivefold and
[1:14:11] and we just reverence all the all the
[1:14:13] Levites that are carrying the ark across
[1:14:15] the Jordan and and we and we just put
[1:14:17] all the honor in the men of God you have
[1:14:18] been made a minister and a
[1:14:21] witness and our job as ministers is to
[1:14:23] support you The Voice
[1:14:26] we have an audience here but if anything
[1:14:28] this is the communion right this is the
[1:14:29] breaking of bread this is the fellowship
[1:14:31] this is in behind closed doors and it
[1:14:32] says go go out into the places of
[1:14:36] fellowship and the different people you
