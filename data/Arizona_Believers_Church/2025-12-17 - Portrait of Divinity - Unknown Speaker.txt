TRANSCRIPT
========================================
My title this evening is portrait of divinity. And uh this the picture I chose to use as our title slide here is a face of Christ painted by Rembrandt. The Rembrandt and uh this is one of several that are attributed to him but the only one that they have determined to be for sure from him and not just from his school or someone else trained by him. Uh but it does convey um as I've calling it a portrait of divinity. When you look at this, it just looks like a man. But I'm wanting to kind of bring that contrast to that paradox on the portrait of divinity. We've been looking at the picture of Christ, a portrait of Christ. We preached on a portrait of a perfect man. And that portrait of a perfect man is a portrait of humanity and tonight a portrait of divinity. And we've been looking at it from the standpoint that as the gospels tell the story of Jesus Christ, they're also painting a picture of God. We read in the gospels what Jesus Christ did and his acts and the things that he said and that he taught and we have to view that as he told his disciples when you've seen me you've seen the father and so Christ though he was in the form of man or in the form of a man uh the the painting of Christ in in that way the painting of Christ or this image of Christ we see it in scripture is a picture of a man we see that humanity in him so that portrait of humanity is the image of humanity as painted by the life of Jesus Christ. I I I appreciated the way that brother Ellie Ezer summed it up. In some ways, I felt like he summed it up better than I could have. So, I'm glad I had a chance to hear what he preached Sunday before I preached tonight because I could summarize what I preached the Wednesday night before. Maybe in a way that helped a lot of us who were confused. I had some people asking me questions, "What do you mean a portrait of humanity, walking on water, raising the dead?" Because we know it's God that did that. But we were just looking at it from a different angle to make you think about it. We should look at that as a portrait of humanity because Jesus came to manifest what as brother Eleazar put it what true humanity should be &gt;&gt; and and also what it can be &gt;&gt; uh through the grace of Jesus Christ. And so we this portion of humanity uh that he expressed had this supernatural side to it as it says in Acts chapter 22. Ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God. So it uses this language, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs. So he's a man that God vindicated himself through and proved through miracles, signs and wonders which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know. So this man Christ Jesus was approved of God as God did these miracles by him and the miracles and the supernatural expressed God. But my emphasis was that God, it expressed God's original design for man. &gt;&gt; Not the hybrid man or the fallen man, but man as he originally was. And so as Jesus expressed these things, he expressed what God could do in man. And that's why the disciples did the same works that Christ did. &gt;&gt; And the question we had asked last week is that if miracles expressed uh what humanity is capable of, then what is the divine portrait? What is the portrait of divinity? In Philippians chapter 2 verse 5, read verses five and six as we uh lean into this with all our might. This to me I'm excited about the subject matter tonight just as we were last week but it's very simple very straightforward. He says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. So let this mind be in you. Allow it. Let it come to preeminence. And it's a mind that Christ had. Now remember Christ uh uh think of everything that Christ is uh and everything we think about Christ and he's saying we need to have that mind in us who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God. &gt;&gt; I love how brother Brandham interprets the scripture that he he looked at it as not something banned or barred or illegal or unlawful but that it was something that he uh was given the privilege to enjoy this equality. A and and the kind of the the double meaning to it is it wasn't the then something just easily grasped that it wasn't just uh being uh equal with God is not something you just attained to on a whim. It was something that he himself submitted to and yielded to. And we know that Jesus Christ reveals the mystery of God or the full mystery of God. Jesus Christ Christ is the mystery of God revealed and there's this uh there's a revelation of God and his mystery in Christ. And so his manifestation, what he did was a full expression of God. And I and I'm I'm drawing from many scriptures that we've been reading recently how that he was this image of God and the likeness of God, the fullness of the Godhead bodily was in him. And so believing that and knowing the scriptures and the things that Jesus accomplished and this prophecy surrounding his life, it's easy to highlight how Jesus Christ was different than man. &gt;&gt; And we can look at it and say, "Well, he knew no sin and this and that." We could talk about the ways that he was different uh and we could see the image of God, the likeness of God, the the the word, the deity in flesh. And so we we know he's the son of God. We know that uh he was uh uh he was sinless. So there's a lot of things and he walked on water and did all the things. So we see him as being very different. So it's easy to identify how he was different than man. In Matthew 1:18, it says, "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise." And and it's said this way because the birth of Jesus was this way. In other words, this is a departure from how every everybody else has come so far. When as his mother was Mary was a spouse to Joseph before they came together, before there was the union, before there was the mixing of themselves together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If you think about Jesus, his conception and his resurrection are unlike any any man's. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that he was conceived uh differently than any man had been before. I I'm including this uh painting by the Korean Christian artist and he this is the enunciation uh to Mary that the child will be conceived of you will be of the Holy Ghost and and I'm just going to use these representations so he could think more humanity uh and more common than maybe we do sometimes. But his conception was different than any other conception &gt;&gt; different than Mary's. Mary wasn't immaculately conceived. that that's just a Catholic fiction. But we know that Christ was conceived in Mary of no part of Joseph or Mary. It was a a conception by God alone unlike any other man's. And his resurrection was different. &gt;&gt; Others had been raised from the dead. But Christ, God gave him power to raise himself back up again. This commandment he received from his father to never die again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he was born unlike or conceived by unlike any other man. But then in his birth, he was born just like you or I. &gt;&gt; Born of a woman and maybe born in a more uncommon way because now he's born out of a cave, out of the side of a hill. He's born in a manger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a very common maybe even a uncommon poor birth, but just like any other man. &gt;&gt; It says in verse seven, and I and again I think we were able to look at well this virgin birth and he lived sinless and he rose from the grave. There's a lot of things about him we know are different than man. But it says he made himself of no reputation. Verse 7, and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men. &gt;&gt; So we see that Jesus Christ now represents he was in the form of God and he was equal with God. But now we see this equality with man. This likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. To me, it's just the language is so profound and so poetic that he was in the form of God. And being in the form of God, he thought it not robbery to be equal with God. And so, in this godly godly form, he made himself of no reputation. Took upon himself the form of a servant. So, kind of begin to notice how he how this is expressed. Being in the likeness of man, he he humbled himself, became obedient unto death. And so, there is things that Jesus Christ did that we do. Here we see a portrayal and I tried to enlarge the image so you could see it. So it might have lost uh some of its crispness in and the way that it's being enlarged here for you to see. But he was baptized in water just like you or I are baptized in water. Went to the water as a man to be baptized. We see him here in the wilderness being tempted of the devil a as a man. He's being tempted. He hungered. He was tired. He was worn. And he's being tempted. We are tempted in the same way that he is tempt was tempted. Then we see him when they say, "Suffer the little children to come unto me." A and children were were drawn to him. And others were drawn to him. The the unfortunate, the the the weak, uh the poor, they were drawn to him. He had a personality maybe that drew some to him. He was approachable. &gt;&gt; And so in each one of these things, we could see a portrayal of Christ. Even as it says, he was obedient unto death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the death of the cross. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He died. He died like a man would die. &gt;&gt; He was crucified and died. It says even the death of a cross maybe was an uncommon death but it was that that horrible death of a criminal. &gt;&gt; These are all things that man man uh could have great personalities. Man could be baptized. Uh man is born of a woman. Man could die. He could be hung on a cross. And so there's all these different ways that Christ is like man. &gt;&gt; And I mentioned it before. One of the deep mysteries of Jesus Christ is what he had in common with man, not what made him different. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like that to me is where the depths of the revelation of Jesus Christ reside. Because when Paul says he took upon himself a a form of a servant, he emphasizes humility, submission, and obedience and death as the mind of Christ to have. &gt;&gt; Let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus. this mind where though he was equal with God and though he was in the form of God, he we're challenged to take upon ourselves this humility, this obedience and even to have this submission to death as Christ did. &gt;&gt; Amen. I would say that the uh loneliness of mind and the uh no reputation, the form of a servant, the humility, the obedience, even the obedience to death, these are certain characteristics that we might attribute to being human &gt;&gt; or weakness, but yet they're divine. &gt;&gt; In 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse one, and I know you're saying, "Oh, here he goes again. He's He's calling it divinity now. And I'm starting to feel a little different because when he walked on water, that was divine. But when he wept, that was human. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not saying it wasn't. &gt;&gt; I'm just wanting you to look at it a little bit differently because there's things that we look at and say, "Oh, that's divine. That's divine." But I think if we looked at as that's way that's what you're supposed to be in flesh, &gt;&gt; that that's the that's the the restoration of the uh uh that's the new race. That's new creatures in Christ Jesus. that we're not going to delay and put this off until until the millennium or in the eighth day, but we're going to say, "No, this is Jesus Christ proved. This is what humanity can do." &gt;&gt; And then we look at this the human part and because we say, "Well, that was a man that wept." Then we don't value it like we should, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, he was humble like a man and he was a servant as a man. And we're think, no, we want to be godlike, not humanlike. But I'm wanting to turn it around and say, "No, this is divinity." &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 10:1. Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presence among you but being absent and bold toward you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ. He's beseeching them by a disposition a character or an image or quality of Christ. And he says it's meekness and gentleness this clemency this mildness fairness. Actually, the word is in and the and the gentleness is sweet reasonleness. And I know that's different than the the John Wayne Jesus we really want, but it's this sweet reasonleness of Christ &gt;&gt; that he it evokes these ideas of moderation and patience and sincerity and this equity where he wasn't overbearing. &gt;&gt; He wasn't rude and obtuse. He had this sweet reasonleness about him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's not saying the gentleness of of a man who was dimmutive in stature and that people picked on and he developed a complex. But this is a character of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the opposite of selfishness. &gt;&gt; Opposite of being self-interested, the opposite of self-entitlement. That's exactly what Paul is emphasizing. Let this mind be in you. That though he was equal with God, he didn't think he was self-entitled to anything. He he made himself of no reputation. Took the form of a servant, humbled himself, became obedient unto death. There was no preoccupation with self. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham even taught us that he didn't use his power. He wasn't using his power for himself. He wasn't even using power. He was using the word of God. &gt;&gt; And so these are attributes that are not quickly or I would say at least not easily associated with God. Yet Christ is displaying them. So they have to be of God. &gt;&gt; This portrait of divinity is in humility, gentleness, meekness. &gt;&gt; It is God hiding himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; That we would with carnal eyes look at this and say that just looks like any other man. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is said that uh Rembrandt when he painted this he used a neighbor of his uh that was a a Jew and Rembrandt himself living in the Jewish community that they believe this is a picture used of a a Jewish uh individual his neighbor and he would HAVE LOOKED JUST LIKE A COMMON MAN ORDINARY MAN. But it's in this in what we might say is common in that SIMPLICITY THAT'S WHERE GOD HIDES HIMSELF. God hides himself in simplicity and we say oh the walking on water THAT'S GOD. WELL, GOD WAS NOT hid in that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He was hid in the meekness. &gt;&gt; He was hid in the gentleness. He's hid in the sweet reasonleness. He's hid in that in the patience, &gt;&gt; and that moderation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was, as you look at this picture, he was a man of sorrows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he was acquainted with grief. He humbled himself. He was abased. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It describes a side of God that we often overlook. that Christ being a man of sorrows, if he expressed that when you've seen me, you've seen the father. If he perfectly expressed God, HE'S NOT SHOWING US SOMETHING, OH, THAT'S NOT GOD. THIS IS SOMEHOW GOD ALLOWING A PART OF HIMSELF that we would never consider before to be expressed perfectly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's that side that maybe we recoil from that God's wanting us to be drawn to &gt;&gt; that we would see a portrait like this and say, "Lord, make me like that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I it's easy for me to say, "Lord, I want to multiply bread. I WANT TO MULTIPLY FISH. I WANT TO WALK ON WATER. I want to raise the dead. I want to curse Christmas trees. ALL THESE THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO. SAID, "NO, IT'S NOT IN THAT. THAT'S HUMANITY." BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO HAVE THIS NATURE of Christ, &gt;&gt; this humility, this meekness. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Just there's a tremendous uh atmosphere here tonight. Just it's the dynamics are just incredible. And so please just focus on on how I want to say this that we know a person by their actions. So we see somebody and they do something and we could even say well because this person does this if they if they cut up meat we say they're a butcher. If they paint walls we say they're a painter. So persons known by their actions. What we say and what we do uh kind of says something about who we are. But in order to really know the person, you you you need to the full picture requires a consideration of motive and objective. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That there's more to the picture than just the actions. As the Bible says, he made known his ways unto Moses and his acts to the children of Israel. In other words, Moses had a deeper understanding of what God was doing. Whereas Israel saw what he had done. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; God did many miracles by Jesus. That's God's power. &gt;&gt; That's the divine. But he expressed himself in other ways. &gt;&gt; I'm going to use some examples in the scripture. Hopefully, this does cause you to think uh spiritually and deeply. In Exodus 15:3, the Lord is a man of war. The Lord is his name. And all the warriors said, "Amen." Right? The Lord is a man of war. &gt;&gt; The Bible describes what a man of war will do in Isaiah 42:13. The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man. He shall stir up jealousy like a man of war. &gt;&gt; Amen. He shall cry y warar he roar. He shall prevail against his enemies. So God is described as a man of war. We can say that God acts and does things that appear very warlike. We say his going forth is as a mighty man. So he goes forth and the consequences ARE HE'S LIKE A WARRIOR. HE STIRS UP JEALOUSY. HE CRIES. He roars. He prevails against his enemies. And we see his actions AND WE SAY GOD IS A MAN OF WAR. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IS it that God is expressing through his warfare? In other words, not just waring and fighting, but what was his objective? &gt;&gt; What's his motive to that? &gt;&gt; When God is acting, WHAT WHAT DRIVES HIM TO ACT? IS HE A man of war? That means he's impatient and impetuous and always flying off the handle and and bloodthirsty. No. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in 1 John 4:8 and verse 16, "He that loveth not God," or excuse me, he that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is a man of war &gt;&gt; and God is love &gt;&gt; and those two are not incompatible. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, I'll say now in case we don't express it this way later, it's his love that causes them to war. &gt;&gt; See, some people war because they're impatient. &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE FIGHT BECAUSE OF PRIDE. &gt;&gt; Some do it for all sorts of means and different gains. But he's a man of war. Why? You cannot disassociate his act OF WARFARE FROM THIS attribute of love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 16 says, "And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love." So it's not just something that he accidentally said. He comes back and says, "God is love. And he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we may know a person by their actions. God's actions made him known as a man of war. But in in him in his essential characteristics, God is love. Think of how this love is made known in Isaiah 38:17. Behold, for peace I had great bitterness, but thou, he's speaking of the Lord, thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption, for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. &gt;&gt; What caused God to do that? God hates sin. &gt;&gt; He hates iniquity. The Bible says he he does. These are things that God detests, God despises, and God hates. SO THEN WHAT WOULD CAUSE HIM TO DELIVER US? His love did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His love FOR OUR SOULS CAUSED him to deliver us. It caused him TO REDEEM US, TO JUSTIFY US. GOD IN LOVE did that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS IN LOVE HAVING PREDESTINATED us into adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's this attribute of love that caused God to act. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 15 12 to 14. This is my commandment that ye love one another &gt;&gt; as I have loved you. &gt;&gt; So this is not uh this is not a a filio love. This is not a love of human emotion. This is a love of a higher intelligence. This is a love with purpose. So love one another as Christ has loved. If Christ loved, it was a god-like love. It was a love of the divine. Now he's asking us as humans to love. &gt;&gt; And that love is to be a portrait not of humanity but of divinity. &gt;&gt; He says, "Greater love hath no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends." &gt;&gt; What was this UH SACRIFICE THAT JESUS MADE? WELL, it was a greater love. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a human love. It wasn't an irrational love. It wasn't a love of jealousy. It wasn't a love, well, IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU, I JUST WANT TO DIE. THIS WAS A LOVE of intelligence. &gt;&gt; Greater love hath no man than this, that he laid down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you. &gt;&gt; And what did he command us to do? To love like he did. &gt;&gt; He's calling us to a self-sacrificing love. Not that we would have to shed our blood for the forgiveness of sins or for for redemption's sake, but we ought to have this kind of mind that was in Christ Jesus who humbled himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Became obedient. This meekness and gentleness of Christ. This lack of selfishness and self-entitlement. We think, well, GOD OWNS A CATTLE ON A THOUSAND HILLS AND GOD SHOULD BE WORSHIPED ALONE AND GOD IS MIGHTY AND GOD DEMANDS JUSTICE AND GOD DEMANDS HOLINESS AND GOD DEMANDS CONSTANT WORSHIP. YEAH, THAT'S THAT'S THIS IMAGE OF GOD that is true and accurate. But there's this other side of God &gt;&gt; that that we have to have as well. &gt;&gt; In John 17, he said, "And for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He did this in love for your soul. &gt;&gt; He did this for your sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is this is him as a man. He had certain rights, &gt;&gt; right? As a man, he had certain abilities. As a man, he could have enjoyed. HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN. YOU SAY, "WELL, HE WAS WITHOUT SIN. GOD MADE IT TO WHERE HE COULDN'T SIN." JESUS was tempted in every point manner like as we were on on the basis that if he wanted to, HE COULD HAVE CHOSE TO DO CERTAIN THINGS. BUT HE SANCTIFIED HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; For other's sake. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he had a right to a wife. He had a right to a home. He had a right to the pleasures of life like we have the comforts of life at least. But he was sanctifying himself because he was training 12 men that would stir the world with the gospel. &gt;&gt; There's this. You say, "Well, that was the man Christ Jesus. That was God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is This is a portrait of divinity. &gt;&gt; I sanctify myself. &gt;&gt; Greater love hath no man than this than he laid down a life for his friends. &gt;&gt; This is the this attribute of God, this love of God. You say, "Well, he's a man of war. That's his actions." But what's his motive? What's being expressed? I could say Jesus displayed and and emphasized certain attributes not to be more human or more relatable, but actually to show he's truly divine. &gt;&gt; And some of the parables that he used in the parable of the good Samaritan, that story is told not so that we begin to relate more to humanity, but to see a side of God that we wouldn't consider. I I want you to I I'm wanting to challenge you a little bit. We say, "Who is your neighbor?" And we begin to think, "Oh, well, there's a Samaritan, there's Jews, and there's priests, and this is human relationships, and this is politics." But he's wanting you to see a picture of God in this. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he tells the story of a prodical son, it's not a story to begin to connect more with humanity and a dad and a son and a good son and a bad son and the son that backslides, but he's wanting to draw a picture and emphasize certain attributes so we could truly see a better picture of the divine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Matthew 5:es 2 to2, this sermon, it's from the sermon on the mount. These things that we're beginning to read are the biatitudes. And uh a lot of us have B attitudes. That means it's not quite an A, right? But that's what we're talking about. B attitudes, blessedness. And maybe you're happy with a B, but we want A+ attitudes, right? &gt;&gt; It says, "And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying, he says, if you love me, you'll keep my commandments. You're my friends if you do what I command." So here's his commandments. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Think of this. Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Think of these characteristics. Poor in spirit mourn. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they which are blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. &gt;&gt; As I just noted here, these biatitudes portray the divine heart. We read this, we're immediately drawn to poor in spirit, meek, mourning, persecuted. And we think of these people. We begin to get in our minds peacemakers and and and merciful. And we have a picture of a kind of a a human a stripped of power and a human that is humble and a human that's this and a human that's poor and a human IN RAGS. BUT HE'S ACTUALLY portraying something divine. As the Korean artist uh represented here, here's him on the sermon of the mount teaching these biatitudes. And this teaching, what he's teaching here, I hope that I can somehow convey this to you. He's teaching this not to make us human, &gt;&gt; but to cultivate divine attributes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are not the virtues of human intelligence. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS OF A DIVINED MIND OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT. BLESSED ARE THEY THAT MOURN. BLESSED ARE THE MEEK. BLESSED are the merciful. Blessed are the PURE IN HEART. BLESSED are the peacemakers. Blessed are those that are persecuted FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS. BLESSED ARE THOSE THAT HUNGER AND thirst for righteousness. WHAT IS IT THAT GOD LONGS FOR? WHAT IS IT GOD WANTS? RIGHTEOUSNESS. &gt;&gt; In each one of these things, we see a picture of the divine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the This is uh he's emphasizing things that we might attribute to humanity and oh, a good person and a humble person, a meek person, but this is the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. as he's teaching this sermon and and I I'm wanting you to think about these these biatitudes. Blessed are the poor in spirit and those that mourn. Some religions and even I'd say Christian Christian religions or denominations teach to perform acts of service and acts of humility and emphasize these attributes. A and they suppose that the blessedness of the being poor in spirit is to be born of the world. We're human. We're flesh. And therefore, therefore, we ought to carry ourselves in as human beings. This is the way we conduct ourselves. But Jesus is actually teaching the opposite. &gt;&gt; He said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." The blessedness is not that they're born from the world, but they're born from above. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice how he's connecting this divine side to this human, what we might think to BE A HUMAN EXPRESSION. HE'S NOT SAYING, "OH, BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONES that are truly human." He's saying you are the ones that are truly divine. Yours is the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; Some teach that the taking of the cross is the acceptance of misery a as the state of being human. That we have to take up this cross and we have to bear this cross. And and there's this idea that as humans we we have to bear this suffering. We have to bear this reproach. But Jesus is opposing the notion because in ACCEPTING THE CROSS, HE'S ACTUALLY PROTESTING HUMANITY. that he's NOT DOING IT TO EXPRESS HIS HUMANITY. HE'S DOING IT TO EXPRESS THAT HE'S CONQUERED THE BASENESS of humanity. &gt;&gt; Humanity doesn't run to the cross. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HUMANITY DOESN'T EMBRACE THE CROSS. THERE'S SOME THAT PREACH THE CROSS AND WE EMBRACE IT THEN THROUGH THIS DEBASEMENT. WE DEBASE IT AS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WOULD HAVE YOU TO DO TO WALK ON YOUR KNEES UNTIL THEY'RE BLOODY TO BEAR THESE THINGS. AND IT'S ALL THIS OUTWARD EXPRESSION. BUT REMEMBER, SOMEONE COULD BE KNOWN BY THEIR ACTS. BUT THE FULL PICTURE IS ONLY UNDERSTOOD BY WHAT WAS BEING EXPRESSED THROUGH THOSE ACTS. &gt;&gt; Remember that revelation comes from within, not without. &gt;&gt; This was a this was the opposition to humanity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice how it says in Hebrews 12:es 1:3, "Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, &gt;&gt; and the sin which doth so easily beset us, &gt;&gt; and let us run with patience the race that is set before us." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross. This is the cross isn't h well I got to go to the in-laws for Christmas. The cross is death. &gt;&gt; Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. FOR CONSIDER HIM THAT ENDURED SUCH CONTRADICTION of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds. This is a call to divinity, not humanity. &gt;&gt; We might think, well, a human can die, a human could take the cross, a human could do these things. But Jesus uh was was not merely submitting to pain. He was resisting pain. &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T JUST ACCEPTING IT. SOMETIMES WE JUST HAVE THIS ATTITUDE. Bad things are going to happen. Just accept it. &gt;&gt; You just have to get through it. You just have to WEATHER IT. YOU JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT IT. JESUS WAS NOT ACCEPTING IT. He was resisting it. &gt;&gt; These things are called to divinity, not humanity. He didn't just merely I I wrote here Jesus did not me merely submit to death. He pursued joy. &gt;&gt; Notice he didn't say he became obedient to death and he died. It said because of what was before him &gt;&gt; he endured. &gt;&gt; That changes everything. &gt;&gt; That [laughter] that that has a different feeling to it. We should be willing to bear the cross as we could read in verses 11 and 12. Blessed are you who are uh reviled against and persecuted and they say all manner of evil against YOU AND BUT REJOICE FOR GREAT IS YOUR REWARD in heaven. &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus is saying. Jesus who for the joy which was set before him, we're willing to bear the present cross for the future reward and liberty that's coming. &gt;&gt; So when we are asked TO BEAR PAIN AND TO BEAR IT PATIENTLY AND TO SUFFER, IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT JUST SUBMITTING TO PAIN, BUT WE'RE AND WE'RE NOT JUST ACCEPTING LOSS AND SUB ACCEPTING HUMILIATION and pain. Humans do that. &gt;&gt; But it's the pursuit of joy that's divine. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF HUMANS THAT SUFFER PERSECUTION. THERE'S A LOT OF HUMANS THAT SUFFER PHYSICAL AFFLICTION AND SICKNESS AND LOSS. AND THAT'S WHAT HUMANS CAN DO. BUT IT'S ONLY THE CHRISTIAN WHO FOR THE JOY WHICH IS SET BEFORE HIM &gt;&gt; CAN HAVE THIS MIND LIKE CHRIST, THAT'S THE DIVINE MIND. &gt;&gt; I I think of it this way too. It it kept coming to me over and over again and I don't know if I'll minister on it on Sunday, BUT WHEN JESUS CHRIST DIED and gave up the ghost, the proclamation of the soldier nearby was truly this was the son of God. &gt;&gt; And what would have been the final seal of truly this man was not the son OF GOD. THROUGH THAT act of dying, divinity was expressed. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE PROCLAMATION BY THIS ONE WHO WASN'T SOLELY BY DOCTRINE, SOLELY BY SUSPICION AND TRADITION AND WASN'T THE ONE WHO SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH, BUT HE'S A HE'S A MAYBE AN UNBIASED WITNESS. I know maybe I'm adding a lot to this and feel free to fill up my inbox with all your COMMENTS LATER, BUT HE'S SAYING SAID, "SURELY THIS WAS THE SON OF GOD." IN OTHER WORDS, GOD SHOWED HIMSELF THROUGH WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE FINAL SEAL of apostasy. &gt;&gt; Amen. The manner in which he died proves to me that he could not have been who he said he was. &gt;&gt; And yet when that image struck the eye of the Roman soldier said truly this was &gt;&gt; divine. &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm hoping that you can really grab a hold of this to realize there's a lot of things that are human. Pain, suffering, mourning, loss, and all those things that humans endure and humans do. But we're not just merely going through these human things. There's another side of it. &gt;&gt; We live in a world that's waring. We say God is a man of war, but amid warfare, he says, "Blessed are the peacemakers." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those who have a spirit of peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, a spirit, a waring spirit doesn't make you fit for war. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO FIGHT. WE GOT A NEW BATTLE. AND SOMETIMES, I THINK THAT'S JUST EXACTLY HOW WE project it. SOMEBODY'S GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME. WE JUST YOU JUST NEED TO TAKE THE SWORD OF GOD'S WORD AND GO TO WHACKING THE DEVIL'S HEAD OFF. AND WE'RE KIND OF LIKE, YEAH, GIVE ME THE SWORD. WHERE'S HIS HEAD? And we and it's just we're beating the air. IT'S THIS IMAGINARY WORK UP. GOT TO GET EXCITED AND WE'RE GOING TO BEAT THE DEVIL UP, RIGHT? I THINK I'VE SAID IT BEFORE. WE COULD GET SO AMPED UP. WE wish we could just MEET HIM IN THE PARKING LOT. But what is it going to take to overcome him? Faith. &gt;&gt; And what does faith do? &gt;&gt; Just it's burly. Knows where it stands. Doesn't have to scout. Shout. Scout too. Doesn't have to scout either. Doesn't have to shout or scream or for the sake of brevity. Scout. Scout. What is it? So what? So, there's a way that you can hold yourself strong with faith. &gt;&gt; I know I've used this example before. The guy who's talking a lot of trash and kicks his slippers off and takes his shirt off and SAYS, "COME ON, COME AT ME. I'M A MAN." You know, take a shot. He's probably not going to swing. Probably going to run, right? Going to call the cops. I'm not I'm not telling you to take a shot. I'm just saying hypothetically. It's the guy who's like, "Hey, man. Sorry." Wants to move on. You know, doesn't want to have a problem. And And why is he doing that? He knows he can hold his own. Doesn't need a posture. &gt;&gt; Doesn't need to talk trash. So, listen. There's a way then that he says, "Blessed are the peacemakers." Why? Because you're going to have to have a spirit of peace to war properly. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit of faith and rest. That's the divine. The human part is to get amped up and ready for war. But the battle readiness is peace of mind. Religion promises peace at the end of the war. Jesus promises peace before you fight. &gt;&gt; He teaches peace of mind. He promotes this peacefulness and promises peace before the fighting even begins &gt;&gt; because he says, "Blessed are the peacemakers. I'm sending you forth into war. I I I know it's going to be hard. You're going to have to battle. YOU'RE GOING TO BE PERSECUTED, BUT BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS." &gt;&gt; AGAIN, it shows this other side where it's not just all the human part that we emphasize, but it's divinity. &gt;&gt; Divinity does not come by holding back emotion or suppressing emotion. But this divinity is is manifested by the expression of a more excellent emotion. I I found this to be fascinating as you you study these things out and you start trying to wrestle out humanity humanity and divinity as I've been trying to look at this and certain CHARACTERISTICS THAT WELL OH THAT LOOKS VERY CHRISTIAN or that looks Christlike or or that's one way to do it. But did you know that uh let's maybe even if it's just fear I will say it this way some emotions could be overcome two different ways either by diminishing one's interest or the increase of of interest. In other words I could be really really afraid of something and uh and then I become less afraid or I'm less interested in something therefore I'm not afraid of it anymore. Kind of with the idea of pain there's a way that maybe you may cease to feel pain you become numb. So therefore, there's no fear of pain. &gt;&gt; But then you may be willing to endure that pain for some other gain. &gt;&gt; And so you've OVERCOME PAIN OR OVERCOME THE FEAR of pain. You overcome fear two different ways. One, you can just lose interest. That doesn't scare me anymore. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, that that uh that's powerful. That's a miracle." But on the other hand, what if you could say, "It scares me to death. I'm scared, but I have a greater there's a greater feeling that begins TO SWELL UP INSIDE OF ME THAT'S greater than that. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES THE DEVIL TRIES TO USE IT WHERE WE SAY, "WELL, I I I'm afraid I'M GOING TO GET SICK OR I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO DIE BECAUSE OF CANCER." SO, WELL, you know, that's human. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A NATURAL RESPONSE. &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T TRY TO MAKE YOURSELF ANY LESS CHRISTIAN BECAUSE YOU FEEL THAT WAY. YOU GOT TO REALIZE THERE'S TWO WAYS THAT YOU CAN NO LONGER UH UH LET THAT govern you. One, you could DON'T CARE IF YOU DIE ANYMORE. I don't care anymore. And you say, "Well, that's is that really faith?" &gt;&gt; Or could there BE SOMETHING ELSE INSIDE OF YOU WHERE I WANT TO LIVE FOR GOD? I I I I'M NOT A I KNOW GOD. I HAVE A GREATER FAITH IN THE FACT THAT GOD'S A HEALER AND THERE'S SOME OTHER SENSE THAT BEGINS TO RISE ABOVE THAT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; One is it's a difference of having no feeling versus having a greater feeling. I I was HAD THIS THOUGHT THIS PAST week and I've had this thought some other times and stick with me. Bear with me. Paul said, "Bear with me in my folly." Certainly, you could do the same for a low-level guy like me, but um I I can be quite the when it comes to getting into cold water in a swimming pool, right? You know, I just sense I don't care about swimming. But really, I can't stand how that can feel when you get into a pool and it's really, really cold, right? Anybody any amens here? And so anyways, um, and I there's different ways you can overcome that. And, uh, this isn't therapy session or anything. I'm not trying to work anything through here, but it's like taking a cold plunge. I You could ask me to jump in a swimming pool and uh, and I can I may not be able to psych myself into it. I I don't want to get cold. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. You know, the the taking a cold shower, it's like, oh, no, no, I don't want to. I don't want to do it. I don't want to. It's just this way that you're adverse to it. Well, some could do it because they overcome that feeling of danger [snorts] and they kind of embrace the pain. You say, "Well, that's that's pretty that's pretty good. That that's that's someone who's overcome." But this is the way that I thought about it. See, I hadn't even got to what I was thinking about recently. I know that as much as I don't want to jump into cold water, I know if I had to do it for my family member, I wouldn't hesitate. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things I DON'T WANT, &gt;&gt; PAINS I DON'T WANT TO FEEL, THINGS I DON'T WANT TO EXPERIENCE, THINGS THAT I'M AFRAID OF. BUT I KNOW THAT IF THERE WAS A GREATER feeling or greater need, &gt;&gt; that I could overcome that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that in doing that, IT WAS A A GREATER A SENSE OF A GREATER LOSS. &gt;&gt; OH, I I could I COULD JUMP IN A POOL AND GET FREEZING COLD AND I DID IT. I TOOK THE COLD PLUNGE. I'M IN THE POLAR CLUB. AND PEOPLE LIKE, CONGRATULATIONS, you're in the polar club. BUT WHAT ABOUT ENDURING PAIN FOR THE SAKE OF SOMEBODY ELSE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE COULD ALL SANCTIFY OURSELVES AND QUIT THIS AND QUIT THAT SO WE COULD BE BETTER ATHLETES AND SO WE COULD WE COULD SAY THAT WE'RE ON THIS STREAK. BUT WHAT ABOUT DOING SOMETHING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'S SAKE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE SAME ACT OF JUMPING INTO COLD WATER BECAUSE YOU WANT TO OVERCOME PAIN IS MAYBE IN THAT IT'S A CONSTRICTION of heart. It's a DEBASING YOURSELF. IT'S LIKE TAKING something and limiting your feeling. But then the other to JUMP IN TO SAVE SOMEBODY else is an enlargement of heart. Right. &gt;&gt; It's an expansion. &gt;&gt; Think of the miracles of Jesus. Jesus didn't walk on water because he wanted to show off. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He walked on water because those that he loved were threatened by the storm. &gt;&gt; He didn't do it because to him the waves weren't big. He didn't do it because they weren't life-threatening and they weren't something that he should be afraid of. He he did IT BECAUSE HE LOVED THOSE THAT WERE IN DANGER and it was love that drove them into the storm. He did it for their sakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there are many different acts that WE CAN PERFORM THAT HUMANS PERFORM. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; But the portrait of divinity has a deeper expression. &gt;&gt; I'm not just restraining from doing this. And I I'm not just doing I'm not just cancelelling out fear. I'm not just going through pain. I'm doing it for the joy which is set before me. &gt;&gt; I I think I probably made a pretty big mess of that. So we might just have to do a whole series on this next year. This is our 77th sermon on art, the subject of arts. Next year we might just have to say you remember that sermon on a Wednesday night before Christmas part 80 in the biatitudes what he's saying is blessed are these but this blessedness is because of God &gt;&gt; the divinity not the human side we can't try to portray the biatitudes through human intelligence &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 13:es 4-7 we'll skip to verse Think of this. Charity suffereth long and is kind. &gt;&gt; When we read this, we try to think of wow a good person. But this is divinity. This is divine. Charity suffereth long and is kind. Charity envithth not. Charity veneth not itself. Is not puffed up. Doth not behave itself unseemly. Seketh not her own. Is not easily provoked. Thinkketh no evil. These are godly attributes. God is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God suffers long. He's kind. He doesn't envy. Say, "Well, he's a jealous God, but he doesn't envy of this sort. He vaunted not himself, IS NOT PUFFED UP, DOESN'T BEHAVE ITSELF UNSEEMLY, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinkketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeeth all things, endureth all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are divine attributes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S A PORTRAIT OF DEITY. VERSE 13, AND NOW ABIDETH FAITH, HOPE, CHARITY, THESE THREE, but the greatest of these is charity. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's is how I guess you could say to Paul when he says, "Well, though I do all these things and have not charity, I'm nothing." &gt;&gt; Because we could do all these acts aside from a a an expression of the divine, and it's just a human doing human things. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just waiting for them to do this. I'm just being patient. I'm just being kind. I'm just not going to believe evil. What's your motive and objective? What are you expressing? &gt;&gt; Amen. He ends chapter 12 with this verse. 1 Corinthians 12:31. But covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way. &gt;&gt; Charity is not the perfection of humanity. &gt;&gt; This capstone is not kind of like the crowning of human achievement. It's not the perfection of human virtue, but it's an expression of divinity. &gt;&gt; This is a divine characteristic. Nehemiah chapter 9:17. Thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness. &gt;&gt; This is the DIVINE PORTRAIT. &gt;&gt; SUFFERETH LONG AND IS KIND, not easily provoked, endureth all things, beareth all things. GOD IS READY TO PARDON. GOD IS GRACIOUS and merciful, SLOW TO ANGER, OF GREAT KINDNESS. THIS IS DIVINITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE MIGHT THINK THAT WHEN WE DO THESE THINGS, WE'RE TRYING TO BE BETTER HUMANS, TRY TO BE MORE LIKE THE MAN CHRIST JESUS. BUT ACTUALLY, HE'S INVITING US TO BE MORE DIVINE THROUGH THESE CHARACTERISTICS THAT WE MIGHT THINK, "OH, WELL, THAT'S JUST HUMAN. THAT'S JUST A A WEAK-MINDED PERSON." WELL, there's just certain people that are called to be more human and they're more sensitive and they're more sweet and they're more kind and they're more forgiving and they're just a little bit more in touch with their humanity and I'm just called to be a brute WARRIOR AND I'M GOING TO TEAR PEOPLE UP and I'm GOING TO SCOLD YOU. I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU UP AND I'M GOING TO BE THE I'M GOING to do this and I'm going to do that cuz I'm the warrior. They say, "Well, I mean, where's where's Christ in this?" &gt;&gt; And they're playing they're doing cosplay of Christ who braided the whip in the temple, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they want to be the people that throw over the money tables and they want to braid the whip and they want to do all that, but there's no other there's no other view. You You want to zoom out? They don't have anything else. &gt;&gt; It's all they are. There's just a snapshot of Jesus in the temple with the braided rope. You say, "Well, was that brother brother Ram said Jesus didn't have the fruits of the spirit in that instance." &gt;&gt; But was that sin? Was that not godlike? God prophesied, "The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up." &gt;&gt; That's an expression of divinity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're thinking, "Ah, yes, good." But without the rest of the picture, &gt;&gt; it just becomes anything else. becomes an act without that deeper thought. &gt;&gt; In John chapter 8 10-11 I this is just an example of how of the divine when Jesus lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto heroman where are thine accusers hath no man condemned thee? This is the woman caught in adultery. Strange that they brought just the woman in order to properly accuse her. the man would have had to been brought himself. But they begin to write. He begins to write in the sand. And one by one, each man dropped his stone and began to walk away. And Jesus says, "Where where where are your accusers?" She says, "No man, Lord." One place she says, "Only you." But Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." &gt;&gt; When this is Jesus in not condemning the adulterous woman, this was not uh the sympathy of a mortal. We know for sure this is not the empathy of someone WHO'S BEEN CAUGHT IN SIN BEFORE. &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHEN JESUS SAID, "LET HE WHO IS WITHOUT SIN CAST THE FIRST STONE," IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE WANTED TO GET TO the front of the line. Because he's the only ONE THAT COULD HAVE DONE IT. &gt;&gt; He's going, "Let he WHO IS WITHOUT SIN CAST THE FIRST STONE." &gt;&gt; HELLO. RIGHT. Come here, WOMAN. AND LINES UP HIS SHOT. BUT THE VERY ONE WHO HAD A RIGHT to condemn &gt;&gt; says, "NEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE. THIS WAS NOT THE EMPATHY OF A MAN WHO SINNED. THIS IS NOT THE SYMPATHY OF A MORTAL. BUT THIS IS THE VERY HEART OF THE DIVINE. A God who is ready to pardon. &gt;&gt; This is a God who's gracious and merciful. When all her accusers stood there ready to to beat her in what? Divine vengeance &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE LAW THAT GOD GAVE US. WE'RE GOING TO HONOR GOD BY SHEDDING HER BLOOD. AND YET GOD IS EXPRESSED in saying, "Neither do I condemn thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. In John 20:es 19 to23, then the same day at evening be the first day of the week when the doors were shut. This is after his resurrection where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and said unto them, peace be unto you. &gt;&gt; And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side. Now he wasn't saying, you remember those scars I had gone gone. He was showing him scars, &gt;&gt; that human side. &gt;&gt; Does God scar? Does divinity scar? But he showed them this human side, &gt;&gt; these markings. Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, peace be unto you. As my father hath sent me, even so send I you. So now here's this commission. And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said unto them, receive ye the Holy Ghost and make listen to these words. I'm just reading this. Whosoever sins ye remit, &gt;&gt; they are remitted unto them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whose sins whosoever sins you retain, they are retained. &gt;&gt; Now, we we wouldn't want to twist this like the Catholic Church does. &gt;&gt; But these are the words of Christ, and they have some application, some expression. And just as Christ looked at the woman in adultery and said, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." He's saying, "Now, as the father has sent me, I send you. And you have power to remit sins." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That you have power through the gospel to call people to repentance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And to whosoever would retain their sins and not repent, they are retained. &gt;&gt; But yet, he's calling us to the same place, this portrait of divinity. We see God AS A GOD OF JUSTICE and a God of a righteousness and a God of wrath. But here's this other side of divinity that there would be an opportunity for salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to forget to say welcome brother David Fritz, but he's visited so often that he just feels like part of the family. So didn't mean to not acknowledge you earlier, but I'm doing it now in a very awkward time. So maybe that makes you feel more called out or special. I don't know. Right. On the subject of remitting sins, it wasn't intentional. You don't feel uncomfortable, do you? Good. Oh, he does. Sorry. Forgive me. remit my sins, please. This attitude, this heart for lost souls, those weak or those marginalized, those that are hurting. You think about Jonah as some people often say the the whale of a baal that he's he's travels runs away from God and comes back finally yields to this calling to go to Nineveh and curse them and he's pretty excited about this. He's finally come around on it. You know what? If anything, they're going to be cursed. And he preaches judgment and then they repent &gt;&gt; and then God spares them and he's disappointed. And why should have he not been disappointed? Because he really liked that side of God that would judge the Nvites. &gt;&gt; The he he he he liked that side of God. So he was happy to do that part. But then when God when they repented then now he's disappointed &gt;&gt; because he couldn't embrace that side of the divine &gt;&gt; as easily as he could the other. Let this mind be in you. &gt;&gt; So in Philippians chapter 4:8, we we'll invite the musicians to come. In Philippians 4:8, he says, "Finally, brethren," here's his summarizing this these great thoughts in Philippians. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, &gt;&gt; whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure. When you think about this, those things ring of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the way, the truth, the life. God is true. There's no darkness in him whatsoever. He's just. He's pure. And it's we're to have a blessed are those that are pure in spirit. Blessed are those that hunger and thirst for justness or righteousness. There's a lot of these this symmetry with these characteristics. True, honest, just, pure. But then it says, whatsoever things are lovely. And that word there just carries with it, I think a word that uh one writer uses winsomeness. It's this agreeableness that you have this honesty, this truth, this justness, this purity, but then lovely. Whatsoever things are of good report. If there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things. notes, put your mind on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what I how I want to just maybe say this in a way that can try to collapse it down and summarize it. What he says, think on these things, he's not drawing your mind away from Christ to something else. &gt;&gt; He's not saying, "WELL, KEEP YOUR MIND STAYED ON GOD, AND IF YOU'D keep your mind stayed on him, he'll keep you in perfect peace and a and focus on the things of God." But if you're not able to do that, just think about things that are true and honest and just and pure and lovely and of good report. These are godlike. These are traits and characteristics that are divine. &gt;&gt; This is this is the portrait of divinity we're called to express. Whatsoever things are lovely, of good report, think on these things. These are this this is a portrait of God. God is lovely. Doesn't he say he'd be called wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Though a man of sorrow is acquainted with grief and we see this side of him that seems so uh uh uh low. Well, that was the human part. It's part of the picture. Yeah. We want to aspire to the greatness in these great things. But God God wants us to be portraits of Christ a and not just in the great signs and wonders, but in the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Many will come to him at that DAY AND SAY WE DID ALL THESE WONDERFUL WORKS and he's going to say but yet it never expressed me because morality may know be known by a person's acts but but the expression THE EXPRESSION WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING EXPRESSED COMES deeper &gt;&gt; the motive and objective and so God wants us to be pictures and portraits of Christ. We're written epistles and he's given us a measure of grace to be Christlike. Ephesians 4:7, "But out of every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ." And it's in that verse chapter where he says, "The measure of the stature of a perfect man." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what Christ was, every Christian should desire to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is our example of mighty works. He's our example of of holiness and the supernatural and sinlessness, but he's also the example of loveliness and agreeableness. Amen. And as you look at the picture of Christ, we see a portrait of humanity. He wept. He hungered. We can see these different things. But the other side of that humanity is he walked on water. He multiplied bread. He multiplied fish. We can say, well, he was also divine. He did this and he did that. But then also part of this divine is the gentleness, the meekness, the humility. And so God has given us grace to express [music] this full picture of Christ. And in these things that I was trying to emphasize tonight, the obedience, the humility, even the death on the cross, surely this was the son of God. Neither do I condemn thee. This meekness, the forgiveness, this way of carrying himself. The language, the the action may seem to be of earth, but the accent is from heaven. &gt;&gt; The the actions may seem to be human, &gt;&gt; but the expression is truly divine. Amen. &gt;&gt; As a song was sung in the service, his law is love and his gospel is peace. [music] That there's there's a there's a side to the divine that we've got to embrace as divine. And I present it to you that way so that you'll want it. If we say that humility is a result of seeing less of ourselves and that meekness is is is it comes through seeing how small we are and that and and to have this gentleness we have to really see how debased and debotched we are as sinful creatures then we won't lean into that. Then we'll try to find some other way to replicate that. Remember the cold plunge, right? That there's a way that I can overcome this fear and that's the way we'll do it. But that's not the way he wants us to overdo it. HE TO OVERCOME. HE WANTS us to recognize this is divine to do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I can't. Jesus faced DEATH AS A MAN. BUT WHAT DID HE EXPRESS? THE HEART OF GOD, &gt;&gt; THE WILL OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD couldn't die. &gt;&gt; It's impossible for him to die. &gt;&gt; But he wanted to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wanted to die. If he could, he would have. But he sent his son as a man. So that when he died, it was almost this ultimate expression of God that even God himself &gt;&gt; could have only done through his son. &gt;&gt; And that was not the portrait of an ultimately broken man. &gt;&gt; But almost the perfect picture of God, &gt;&gt; that is that a is that a divine you could hunger for? just turn it around and realize that these difficult things that God asked us to do isn't because to make us more human and make us feel more low and small, but it's to make you hunger for the divine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope these things could be on your heart as you ponder the birth of Christ over the next week. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And this beautiful picture that's painted in the scripture of the perfect man that he's called [music] you to be. &gt;&gt; This duality, as brother Eleazar put it, thought it was beautiful. This duality of humanity and divinity perfectly expressed to where hopefully at the by looking at this, you finally just say, you know what, I can't really separate it. &gt;&gt; I don't know what to call human. I don't know what to call divine. I just know it's God. &gt;&gt; It's God in flesh. And that way, we can embrace it for ourselves. Lord, I want to be Christlike. Let's stand today. Thank you so much this evening. Thank you so much for your attentiveness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Perhaps your prayer is Lord, I want to be more like you. &gt;&gt; I want to express the divine, Lord. Yes, we want to I I want to speak a world into existence. I I I want to lay my hands on the sick and they recover. I want to speak to the storm and it obeys me. I I I want to cast out devils. I I want to do many wonderful works uh uh in his name. These are things I believe that are for us in the atonement. But then what about these other parts? Well, I want these two. I want to take on I want to make myself of no reputation. I want to be a servant. I want to be humble. [music] I want to become obedient. I want to have meekness and gentleness. I want to be poor in spirit. I want to mourn. I want to be meek. &gt;&gt; I want to hunger and thirst for righteousness, not act as if I have it all and have need of nothing. I want to be merciful. I want to be pure in heart. I want to be persecuted for righteousness sake, not for my selfishness. &gt;&gt; I want to know that I'm blessed when men revile me and persecute me and say all manner against me falsely for Christ's sake. I want to be able to rejoice and be exceeding glad. Not because I'm enduring it and it does it matter to me. And sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me, but for great is my reward in heaven. [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, my language and my actions may be of earth. They may be human. Lord, let the accent and the expression [music] be from above. Let's pray. Gracious heavenly father, today as we close this service, I I know it's straightforward and I do know that there it's a very simple maybe linear thought, but Lord, I do understand just how hard it can be to grasp this because for so long, Lord, when we looked into the Bible, I can only speak for myself, there's a almost this quick categorization of the things that are divine, the things that are deity, the things that are supernatural. And then there's this other side and it's like, well, when he was a man, he did this. when he was God, he did that. And we just have this separation for no Lord, it was certainly a struggle at times for the disciples to know when you were truly speaking and it was God speaking and when it was a man. And maybe there's always this wrestling of well, what's this and what's that? But Lord, as the pictures painted in the Gospels and as Paul continued to paint the portrait through his letters and the New Testament is written, it's showing us a beautiful expression of who you are. And Lord, I don't want to go through it and just separate things out and say, "Well, this is what we really want. We want signs and wonders and miracles because that's the God part." We want that part because that's what we were called to be. These signs shall follow them that believe. But Lord, we realize there's another side to it that we could be known by all these different acts and that expresses something about us. But the full picture is only understood by the by what the motive and objective is. That's that's the real expression of you. To be expressions of Christ, we cannot just modulate something external. We've got to have the divine on the inside. that the one who created the hand could make himself of no reputation. [music] &gt;&gt; The one who unfolded the world from [snorts] his fingertips could be gentle and meek. To think, Lord, that it was the act of death that caused a Roman to say, "Truly, this was divine." Lord, I know my [music] words in in my approach and my manner and maybe the way I pieced it together falls woefully short of the picture that of of divinity that I believe you're wanting to convey through this structure. So, I ask, Father, reveal it in them. Show them, Lord. May May they hunger and thirst for divinity like they've never have before. &gt;&gt; Not to be powerhouses [music] uh through mighty acts, but through humility. The way up is down. &gt;&gt; The only way that we can become a powerhouse is if we had that cap, that true capstone of charity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when the expression is accurate. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Lord, we have many things that we could do as Christians, but as we continue to grow, as we continue to mature, may we become more seasoned, &gt;&gt; peacemakers, &gt;&gt; pardoners, forgivers, [music] &gt;&gt; longsufferers, &gt;&gt; help us in this dark time, even this holiday season, to be true portraits of [music] Christ. &gt;&gt; We ask it in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
