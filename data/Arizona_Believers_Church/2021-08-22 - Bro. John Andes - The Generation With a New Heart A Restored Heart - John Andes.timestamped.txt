[0:00] amen Ezekiel 37 as the Lord is now just
[0:03] going to speak to you
[0:06] personally verse 1 the hand of the Lord
[0:10] was upon me and carried me
[0:12] out in the spirit of the Lord and set me
[0:16] down in the midst of the Phoenix
[0:23] Valley why not I mean do y'all want me
[0:26] to preach way up in the clouds or you
[0:28] want to come right down where we're
[0:29] living amen
[0:30] so now Ezekiel was carried away by the
[0:33] spirit and looked down into the midst of
[0:35] the valley which was full of
[0:38] Bones and caused me to pass by them
[0:42] round about and behold there were very
[0:45] many in the open Valley of Phoenix the
[0:50] Phoenix
[0:52] Valley and lo they were very
[0:55] dry don't worry I'm not adding to the
[0:58] word I'm just bringing you into
[1:00] and he said unto me son of man can these
[1:03] bones live because bones speak of life
[1:08] or a person that used to be walking and
[1:10] living and vibrant but now I just see a
[1:12] bunch of
[1:13] Bones and from the youngest to the
[1:15] oldest that's kind of scary to see a
[1:17] bunch of
[1:18] bones but the answer was can these bones
[1:22] live that was the question and I
[1:24] answered oh Lord God thou knowest again
[1:27] he said unto me unto Ezekiel prophesy
[1:31] upon these bones and say unto them oh ye
[1:34] Dry Bones hear the word of the
[1:38] Lord thus sayeth the Lord God unto these
[1:41] bones behold I will cause breath to
[1:45] enter into you and ye shall
[1:50] live hello Valley of Phoenix Hallelujah
[1:53] hello to you Believers that might have
[1:55] had a life of dry bones the spirit of
[1:58] the Lord is here today the Lord is here
[2:00] in this room right now to Speak Life to
[2:03] you and there might be a question can
[2:06] you live again I'm here to answer back
[2:08] you can live again you say but I'm just
[2:11] a bunch of Bones no you're not I see you
[2:13] walking I see you living I see you
[2:16] restored I see you recovered I see you
[2:19] coming out of the
[2:21] bed what a
[2:23] vision and he spoke to the bones and
[2:25] said ye shall live and verse six I will
[2:28] lay Senus upon you and will bring up
[2:30] flesh upon
[2:32] you this is God speaking and cover you
[2:35] with
[2:37] skin and put breath in you and ye shall
[2:44] live and ye shall know that I am the
[2:48] Lord so it's not the
[2:50] preacher it's not the Deacon it's not
[2:52] somebody else it's the Lord speaking
[2:55] these things so I prophesied Ezekiel
[2:59] said as I was
[3:01] commanded and as I prophesied or as I
[3:05] spoke the word over the bones there was
[3:08] a noise and behold a shaking and the
[3:12] bones came together bone to his bone
[3:16] Hallelujah and when I beheld lo the
[3:19] Senus and the flesh came up upon them
[3:23] and the skin covered them
[3:26] above and there but there was no breath
[3:28] in them
[3:30] it's kind of like um a person you'd go
[3:33] visit in the hospital or a person that
[3:35] would be laying there in distress they
[3:37] have skin they have flesh they they're
[3:40] not just bones but there was no breath
[3:42] or life or spirit in them then said he
[3:46] unto me aren't you glad God didn't stop
[3:48] there he said prophesy unto the wind
[3:51] prophesy son of man and say to the wind
[3:54] thus sayeth the Lord God come from the
[3:56] Four Winds oh breath and breathe upon
[3:59] the SL that they may live so I
[4:03] prophesied as he commanded me and the
[4:05] breath came into them Hallelujah and
[4:09] they lived and stood up upon their feet
[4:12] an exceeding great Army praise
[4:17] God now verse 11 and he said unto me son
[4:21] of man these bones he's explaining now
[4:24] the vision these bones are the whole
[4:27] house of Israel
[4:30] behold they say our bones are
[4:32] dried and our hope is
[4:35] lost we are cut off for our parts
[4:39] therefore prophesy and say unto them
[4:42] thus sayeth the Lord God behold all my
[4:45] oh my people I will open your Graves and
[4:49] cause you to come up out of your Graves
[4:51] and bring you into the land of Israel
[4:54] and ye shall know that I am the Lord
[4:57] hallelujah when I have open opened your
[5:00] Graves oh my people and brought you up
[5:03] out of your
[5:04] Graves last verse verse 14 and shall put
[5:09] my spirit let's all say my spirit my
[5:12] come up out of that graveyard come up
[5:14] out of that dead church that dead
[5:17] situation that dead Health God is not
[5:19] going to leave you comfortless by the
[5:21] road just wounded he's going to pour in
[5:24] oil he's going to pour in wine he's
[5:26] speaking I am the Lord and I've opened
[5:29] your Graves verse 14 and I will put my
[5:32] spirit in you and ye shall live and I
[5:35] shall place you in your own land then
[5:39] shall you know that I the Lord have
[5:41] spoken it and performed it saith the
[5:45] Lord Hallelujah Lord fulfill that today
[5:48] this day the scripture is fulfilled I'm
[5:51] standing in a room not of dry bones but
[5:53] of people of the Believers of this
[5:56] message that are having a Revival you
[6:00] are being restored you say what are you
[6:02] doing here in Phoenix I'm being restored
[6:06] I'm coming up out of my bed God bless
[6:09] you you can have your seats if you're
[6:11] able Hallelujah isn't it great to be
[6:13] part of a message that's
[6:15] alive I don't believe I'm speaking to a
[6:17] valley of dry bones I believe I'm
[6:19] speaking to men and women that just are
[6:22] wanting to see God move in our midst and
[6:24] I'm not brother Aaron McGary I'm brother
[6:27] John Andy so forgive me I'm just the
[6:29] spare tire but you know when you need
[6:32] the spare tire you don't want to go open
[6:34] up the back of your trunk and it's all
[6:37] flat is that right nothing big been
[6:41] being way out near Lake Pleasant or way
[6:43] up in Wickenberg somewhere and and you
[6:46] and you have a flat tire and you open up
[6:48] your trunk and the tire the spare tire
[6:50] is flat it's like God don't give us a
[6:52] flat service amen we we've come on a
[6:54] Sunday morning we're looking forward to
[6:56] it we're under expectation I I believe
[7:00] God's doing something here in this
[7:01] assembly of Arizona Believers Fellowship
[7:04] and you're part of it and I'm part of it
[7:08] Hallelujah so don't let me down amen
[7:10] we're we've come here to be part of a
[7:12] Believers that are going on with God and
[7:14] so I salute you this morning in the name
[7:17] of Jesus Christ now in our next slide as
[7:20] we look at this thought I have some
[7:21] slides to show you today I hope that's
[7:25] okay in the restored heart brother
[7:28] brandham was speaking this was actually
[7:31] um s sister Nicole the next day after
[7:34] spoken word is the Original Seed we were
[7:37] talking about this yesterday on our hike
[7:39] and brother brandham spoke spoken word
[7:41] is the Original Seed and then the very
[7:44] next day he spoke in time sign seed and
[7:48] he said when we see God heal a man here
[7:51] a few days ago in our church they
[7:53] brought a little girl in there on a
[7:55] stretcher and they called me in the
[7:58] nighttime on the road and said said the
[7:59] girl cannot live the cancer was so bad
[8:03] about 17 years old she can't even get
[8:06] there she's going to die before she uh
[8:08] gets there it was a pitiful case a
[8:11] lovely little girl of 17 years old but
[8:15] he said to prove something to my church
[8:18] I never touched the girl the child at
[8:20] all I never as much as touched her I
[8:24] walked in she was laying on a stretcher
[8:27] of course there was other sick people
[8:29] but I was concerned about the child to
[8:32] catch her spirit when I spoke to her and
[8:35] it seemed like a very fine little girl I
[8:38] see no reason why that child should fill
[8:41] a premature grave and that has to be the
[8:44] devil trying to take her life now can we
[8:47] all agree that Satan's trying to take
[8:49] our lives today and the Holy Spirit
[8:51] walks in the great physician walks in
[8:54] and but he's just watching and looking
[8:56] at your spirit he's trying to catch our
[8:58] spirit and this this young lady she was
[9:00] a fine person and it was the devil
[9:03] trying to take her life so I never
[9:05] touched the child at all I went right to
[9:07] the pulpit with the word and stayed
[9:09] right with the word and the word healed
[9:13] her so instantly until she got up and
[9:17] walked away is all right now let living
[9:21] like anybody
[9:24] else just let brother uh Alderson take
[9:27] care of the stretcher don't worry about
[9:29] the stretcher she's healed she's out
[9:32] there giving testimony and
[9:34] fellowshipping brother Emanuel take care
[9:36] of the the stretcher bed all right you
[9:38] just focus on the healing you focus on
[9:41] letting the tumor drop down in the chair
[9:44] next to you and let it just wither up
[9:46] and dry that old spirit that has haunted
[9:49] you the Lord Jesus said it's over now
[9:52] speak to this valley of dry bones and
[9:54] breathe life breathe strength back into
[9:57] them breathe hope back in into the
[10:01] situation and so now we find a young
[10:03] lady that is walking and right and
[10:06] living like nobody else and can't find a
[10:08] trace of it but brother brandham if you
[10:10] notice he said I was trying to prove
[10:13] something to my
[10:14] church that it's just not all physical
[10:16] and laying hands he said I never even
[10:18] touched her next slide see the word went
[10:22] forth and she believed the word and the
[10:25] word is God's life and power and the
[10:28] word is what does it the word heals the
[10:31] sick when you say well Jesus healed the
[10:34] sick he is the word he is the word when
[10:38] you receive the word you receive Jesus
[10:41] for he is the word the word was made
[10:44] flesh and dwelt among us we believe that
[10:46] don't we we believe that Christ is God's
[10:49] word made manifest and we believe that
[10:51] his bride must be the same thing we
[10:54] believe that she must believe every bit
[10:57] of the word and have that word
[10:59] in her because she is part of the body
[11:03] she is the body where he is the
[11:07] head now the body of Jesus Christ is not
[11:10] the sickest body on the face of the
[11:13] Earth this morning I believe we're
[11:16] getting ready for a Rapture I believe
[11:18] brother brandham made those statements
[11:20] in the 60s but God has restored and
[11:23] brought a a generation we're standing up
[11:25] on our feet today we might be a little
[11:28] bit wobbly we might have to hold one
[11:30] another up we might have to be dragging
[11:32] people across the finish line by love
[11:34] but we're going to make it speak to this
[11:37] valley of dry bones and don't talk about
[11:40] the bones or the dryness or the politics
[11:43] or the covid just preach the word just
[11:47] breathe life and and and we want to see
[11:50] breath and life back into the church
[11:53] that's what we're looking for not a form
[11:55] of godliness with your dress or your
[11:57] long hair we not our goal isn't to get
[12:00] all our children sitting nice and not
[12:02] saying a word it's but to have breath
[12:05] it's to have life it's to have strength
[12:08] back into them and that's what we are
[12:10] believing for today with all of our
[12:12] hearts now in the next slide and I know
[12:14] this is going to be difficult for maybe
[12:17] some in the back to read uh in the next
[12:19] slide this is out of the church age book
[12:21] when brother brandham is quoting
[12:23] Revelations 10 and then Matthew and then
[12:26] Malachi chter 4 I I quoted this on
[12:29] Wednesday night Malachi 4:5 behold I
[12:32] will send you Elijah the prophet before
[12:35] the coming of the great and Dreadful day
[12:37] of the Lord and he shall turn the heart
[12:39] of the fathers to the children and the
[12:42] Heart of the children to the fathers
[12:45] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[12:48] curse today we're speaking on the
[12:50] restored heart so we were taking out of
[12:54] Malachi 4 and the next paragraph brother
[12:56] brandham talked about how in Malachi
[13:00] 46 how that uh he will turn the hearts
[13:03] of the children to their fathers and
[13:05] then he began to speak about the hearts
[13:07] of the fathers to the children and he
[13:11] says when Elijah's Ministry was here in
[13:13] John the Baptist he was pointing to that
[13:16] Prophet that was to turn the hearts of
[13:18] the fathers to the children but now he's
[13:22] quoting Luke 17 can y'all see that okay
[13:25] and then verse the last paragraph is
[13:27] what I wanted to bring to you this
[13:29] morning again we know that because Jesus
[13:32] said so he just said John in the
[13:34] ministry of John the hearts of the
[13:36] fathers were turned to the children we
[13:39] know that because Jesus said so but it
[13:42] does not say that the hearts of the
[13:43] children were turned to the fathers that
[13:46] is yet to take place the hearts of the
[13:49] last day children will be turned back to
[13:53] the Pentecostal fathers John got the
[13:56] fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the
[14:00] children into the fold now this Prophet
[14:03] upon whom the spirit of Elijah Falls
[14:06] will prepare the children to welcome
[14:09] back Jesus and I'm looking into your
[14:12] faces today I'm seeing the prophecy
[14:15] being fulfilled you are the children
[14:18] whose hearts are being turned back I
[14:20] mean it's not just him welcoming us home
[14:23] it's you running to him saying I'm
[14:25] coming home I'm coming out of this
[14:28] Valley
[14:29] I'm coming out of this life that I've
[14:31] been living or I'm coming out of this
[14:33] sin of the world I'm arising you're the
[14:36] lazarous that is laying in the Tomb and
[14:39] you hearing your name being
[14:41] called and it's not John or Mary or Sue
[14:45] or Esther Danielle but it's the voice of
[14:47] the word and when you hear that
[14:49] something happens inside of you it's
[14:52] like an energy it's like a force it's
[14:54] like
[14:56] breathe and you receive that breath and
[14:59] it gives you strength to rise in the
[15:02] name of the Lord now in our next
[15:05] slide last year my my son-in-law we have
[15:08] three children and three grandchildren
[15:11] and my son-in-law lives in Canada he
[15:13] married my daughter my youngest daughter
[15:15] and he went into a doctor's office and
[15:19] can you believe it uh this is probably
[15:21] the Canadian healthc care system but
[15:24] posted right on the cabinet brother

[15:28] letter please limit each office visit to
[15:32] one or two issues

[15:41] bone your headbone your knee bone and
[15:44] what's going on your back and your
[15:45] cousin and your uncle and then and then
[15:47] and they they wanted to focus in on only
[15:50] one or two that was their time of the
[15:51] day that's their strength that's their
[15:54] answers aren't you glad we're in another
[15:56] office today where he says bring all of

[16:21] all your needs bring all your issues and
[16:24] we got them all in importance and this
[16:26] is the main thing and God might just you
[16:28] know you know good deal with number five
[16:30] and you say you know why is he do he
[16:32] might be talking to another person in
[16:35] the body and they're going and they're
[16:37] moving and you're like nothing's
[16:38] happening nothing's happening just wait
[16:40] till the end of the
[16:42] service Hallelujah don't fall asleep
[16:45] today so I'm glad we're not part of this
[16:48] Health Care System the great Physician's
[16:50] in the room and he's like whatever you
[16:52] have need of I'm here to talk to you
[16:54] about it so as we look in the next slide
[16:57] I wanted to bring you back a little bit
[16:59] to Wednesday night when we were speaking
[17:02] out of Ezekiel and about how I will give
[17:05] you a new heart and I will give you a
[17:08] new spirit and I will put my spirit
[17:12] within
[17:13] you which is you you all know that I
[17:16] think brother Aaron's taught you very
[17:18] well Ezekiel and I will give you a new
[17:21] heart I'm going to give you a new spirit
[17:23] and I'm going to give you my spirit that
[17:25] is the holy spirit that is God's spirit
[17:27] coming inside but if you can look on the
[17:29] screen and I don't want don't want
[17:32] anybody fainting on us today I I showed
[17:34] a picture like this in South Carolina
[17:36] and somebody ran ran right out I think
[17:38] they were probably like me they don't
[17:40] like to see
[17:42] blood we're speaking on the heart
[17:45] though and when you have open heart
[17:49] surgery I I just showed you this photo
[17:51] for a reason especially these surgeons
[17:54] that are performing this coronary uh
[17:57] artery bypass surgery when they open up
[17:59] your heart but I want you to notice how
[18:02] they put in those steel
[18:04] retractors because they want to open up
[18:07] the area so that the physician can be
[18:11] focused in and if you notice what's in
[18:14] their hands can you see that doctor they
[18:17] don't have a big sword they don't have a
[18:19] big wide thing but they have a little
[18:22] scalpel can you see that because we're
[18:25] getting down into delicate areas and
[18:27] little fine nerves and blood vessels and
[18:30] parts of a person's life or heart it's
[18:33] not a time to bring in the
[18:35] sludgehammer or the
[18:38] Jackhammer
[18:40] hello like we're in the operating room
[18:42] and and we're talking about things that
[18:44] are maybe and if you just look at these
[18:46] people they're trained and they're
[18:48] focused in on the
[18:50] heart you might not see a foot
[18:53] specialist you might not see your
[18:55] favorite ear specialist at this type of
[18:57] surgery but the heart doctors in and
[19:01] he's been trained he's been there to
[19:03] know how to go in because we the heart
[19:06] is in trouble there's heart trouble here
[19:09] and we need to have the heart of the
[19:11] matter dealt with and not just the
[19:13] little surface you know skin scratch you
[19:16] got from the doggy this morning or you
[19:18] know when you tripped at the at the pool
[19:20] or at the grocery store we're not
[19:22] talking about your just the outside
[19:24] realm we're going into the heart of the
[19:25] matter and sometimes you have to take
[19:27] out the heart and deal with the heart of
[19:29] the matter God knows how to take care of
[19:32] everything in our
[19:33] lives so the restored heart has to do
[19:36] with now opening up the insides and we
[19:39] see in the next slide a prophecy in Joel
[19:42] 2 of I will restore to you the years
[19:46] that the Locust hath eaten you've heard
[19:48] this verse before right I will restore
[19:51] to you the years that the Locust hath
[19:55] eaten the canker worm and the
[19:57] caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great
[19:59] Army which I sent among you this is a
[20:02] promise of God coming to you and saying
[20:05] I am here to restore
[20:08] you from all the things that's happened
[20:11] over the years it could be a long time
[20:14] it could be a measure of time or a
[20:16] certain time of the age of your life
[20:19] where something happened or it could be
[20:21] your whole lifetime it could be like God
[20:24] coming to an individual and saying I'm
[20:26] going to bring back I'm going to restore
[20:28] to you all the
[20:31] years so we're not going to talk about
[20:34] the valley of dry bones and how they got
[20:36] to be dry we're in the operating room
[20:40] and we're going to have the great
[20:41] physician speak to us about how we can
[20:44] get restored or I restore to you the
[20:47] years we'll go to the next slide as I
[20:49] wanted to show you out of two other
[20:51] versions I think some of you are
[20:53] interested sometimes in the King James
[20:55] version here's the new international
[20:58] version of Joel 2 God saying I will
[21:01] restore I will repay you I'm sorry I
[21:04] will repay you for the years that the
[21:08] Locust has
[21:10] eaten the great Locust and the young
[21:13] Locust and the other
[21:16] Locust whatever Locust whatever Spirit
[21:19] has tried to eat away at your fruit or
[21:22] at your fellowship or at your peace or
[21:25] at your joy or at your marriage or at
[21:28] your
[21:29] Faith even in the message or in the
[21:31] messenger or in God here's a promise
[21:34] saying I'm going to repay you for all
[21:36] the years and all the damage that those
[21:39] locusts tried to eat away at you God is
[21:43] saying I am here to pay you
[21:47] back in another version on the bottom
[21:49] you can see then I will make up to you
[21:53] I'm going to make it up to you you say
[21:56] I've bet had a hard hand or I've had
[21:59] a a certain thing going on and I just
[22:00] feel like I'm on the wrong side of
[22:02] everything I'm on the negative side of
[22:04] everything this is the word saying I
[22:06] will make up to you for the years that
[22:10] the swarming Locust has eaten the
[22:13] creeping Locust the stripping Locust and
[22:17] the gnawing Locust my we could take a
[22:20] whole weekend on those things couldn't
[22:21] we oh these creepy and crawly things
[22:24] that try to eat away at your life like a
[22:27] snake they try to eat you you they try
[22:29] to creep on you they're creepers they
[22:32] try to strip you of your they try to
[22:34] strip you of your skin they try to strip
[22:37] you and in the valley of dry bones they
[22:39] had no skin they had no sen you and they
[22:42] had totally been gone to the place where
[22:45] the gnawing Locust had just ate away
[22:48] everything and God spoke to them and
[22:50] said I will
[22:55] restore praise God that should have been
[22:58] a great shout from us saying praise God
[23:02] I am the word that's being restored I am
[23:06] restored in the next slide I wanted you
[23:08] to just eat on on some of this just a
[23:10] little bit these promises because if
[23:12] we're going to get your heart restored
[23:15] it's going to come from the spoken word
[23:17] and brother John isn't here just to lay
[23:19] hands on every person as a minister
[23:21] shake hands with the minister we already
[23:23] heard that at the beginning it's hearing
[23:25] the word he sent his word and
[23:29] I don't know you or what's going on in
[23:30] your life but the Holy Spirit
[23:33] does and when you're in the open heart
[23:36] surgery like I showed you
[23:38] earlier you don't care about the
[23:40] doctor's glasses about his you know coat
[23:43] about whether he's you know whether he's
[23:45] divorced married this I know as a
[23:47] minister we should but I'm I'm talking
[23:49] about a doctor in a natural case where
[23:51] he went to University or I don't like
[23:53] that University where whether you ate
[23:55] you know breakfast this morning or what
[23:57] would you eat for supper last night
[23:59] you're not interested in that you have a
[24:01] heart
[24:02] problem so when we're in the house of
[24:05] God it's looking beyond the Flesh and
[24:07] the secretary and the nurse that took
[24:09] your blood and took your blood pressure
[24:12] you say well I got you know I got
[24:14] muscles here why you taking my M no it's
[24:16] a blood pressure thing oh oh and and
[24:19] then we get all nervous and
[24:20] things about things that as we come into
[24:23] this Hospital place this church building
[24:27] Arizona believer's church is like a
[24:30] hospital
[24:34] room and we like to look all dressed and
[24:37] niced up and ironed and all good for
[24:40] Sunday morning and God says I'm looking
[24:43] at a surgery room I'm looking at a
[24:45] hospital room I'm looking at you walking
[24:47] in troubled and walking out healed and
[24:49] praising God and being restored hearing
[24:53] something that can give you faith and
[24:55] strength and energy I'm breathing life
[24:58] in to you saying you can
[25:03] live so here's God saying uh um I will
[25:07] restore means I'm going to give you a
[25:09] covenant at peace I'm going to be at
[25:12] peace with you it's I'm not going to let
[25:14] you go to bed at night worried that if
[25:16] you don't wake up you're going to be in
[25:18] hell I'm not dangling you over hell this
[25:21] morning by a little chain and God's
[25:25] angry at you or he's upset at you that
[25:28] that might have been how some of you
[25:29] were raised but that's not really the
[25:31] gospel the gospel is good news it is it
[25:35] is God coming to you and saying I have
[25:37] good news for
[25:39] you are we all together it's not one or
[25:42] two issues it's like Lord I'm a mess I'm
[25:45] in trouble and he's like but I got the
[25:48] answer I've got everything you have need
[25:51] of I'm going to bring peace to this
[25:53] situation it means to make you complete
[25:56] and to give you a sound mind I'm going
[25:58] to make you sound say but I see
[26:00] confusion I see pieces all over the
[26:03] place like brother Mitch would
[26:05] understand this you know the computer
[26:06] everything is just all you know
[26:08] fragmented and I just I'm scattered well
[26:11] God just brings that all together and
[26:14] just a few minutes God can do a miracle
[26:16] in just a moment do we believe that in
[26:19] this room some of you are living
[26:21] Miracles i' I've heard your testimonies
[26:24] and and when you hear the word it's not
[26:26] just for you it could be for someone
[26:27] else you say God gave me a new heart God
[26:30] gave me a new spirit God gave me another
[26:33] chance to serve him I'm a second chance
[26:36] and I'm living I'm
[26:38] breathing so I'm going to sing to the
[26:40] top of my lungs or I'm going to shout
[26:43] hallelujah I'm in a room full of
[26:45] Believers that are going in the
[26:47] Rapture God's restoring our sound mind
[26:51] and how we ought to be thinking and it
[26:53] means to be finished or to be ended and
[26:56] to be uninjured
[26:59] that's how God sees you he sees you
[27:03] finished I'm not saying you're finished
[27:05] I so he sees you like completed and he
[27:08] steps back and says wow that's a good
[27:11] work you say but look at the knee it's
[27:13] got a it's got like Michelangelo when
[27:16] they when they Struck it and said you
[27:18] know speak or live there's a flaw we all
[27:21] have flaws stop looking at the flaw you
[27:25] know brother John he has a something on
[27:27] the me that I had to look at every day
[27:30] at his house and you know what that sign
[27:32] says you are perfect to
[27:35] me I thought praise God I need to get
[27:38] that for my wife amen I I should have
[27:40] took that and put it in my suitcase but
[27:43] that would have been stealing but what
[27:45] wouldn't you like to wake up every day
[27:46] and say God sees you
[27:49] perfect God sees you whole I see you
[27:54] restored Hallelujah I will restore
[27:57] sayith the Lord that'd be a wonderful
[27:59] message to wake up to a lot better than
[28:01] the Phoenix news or the national news or
[28:04] what's happening in Afghanistan it'd be
[28:06] a lot better to wake up and say I see
[28:09] you
[28:11] perfect do you agree with that we see
[28:15] that God is making you safe I'm going to
[28:17] make you whole and good again and
[28:19] restoration I will restore means I'm
[28:22] going to give you
[28:24] compensation you were born a loser but
[28:27] I'm I'm going to make you a winner
[28:30] you're born in sin shaped in iniquity
[28:32] and I'm going to come to you at some
[28:35] time in your life and let you know that
[28:37] I died on the cross for your sin and
[28:40] friends we need to tell our children
[28:42] that every day God loves them he's here
[28:45] to save them it's not all their bad
[28:48] habits and all the bad things it's we
[28:50] need to speak the word into our
[28:53] families that's what brings separation
[28:56] in in marriages is a of love that's one
[28:59] of my last quotes but brother Bram said
[29:01] that brings separation in churches is a
[29:03] lack of love God put love back in my
[29:06] heart you know maybe we need a heart
[29:08] surgery and God just say I'm going to
[29:10] put love back into that
[29:12] heart you're Stony you're callous I see
[29:16] your hurt but it's time to come out of
[29:19] that hurt I'm going to take that hurt
[29:20] and I'm going to put some Spirit of oil
[29:23] down in that thing I'm going to put a
[29:25] little balm do youall know what balm me

[30:06] we're years down the road now your case
[30:09] isn't all unique and special and I don't
[30:11] know if I'm going to come out of this
[30:12] Hospital you ought to have a totally
[30:14] opposite attitude it's like wow many of
[30:17] God's sons and daughters have come into
[30:19] this hospital and come out and they're
[30:22] serving
[30:23] God so it doesn't matter about all the
[30:26] things it's I'm going to have a restored
[30:28] heart out of this
[30:30] right God's going to make it good and
[30:33] pay back all that you lost I want every

[31:26] message to somebody

[32:06] ashamed Jesus Christ is restoring our
[32:10] hearts and bringing us back to our ought
[32:12] to be conditioned now this next slide we
[32:16] have shown literally in the last year
[32:19] sister Danielle you've seen this
[32:22] before but this is like a bride tree you
[32:26] you've been likened to the bride tree
[32:28] and you cut a tree and it shows by the
[32:32] Rings in the tree how many years old it
[32:36] is but it also shows the event of what's
[32:40] happened in that tree or in that
[32:43] person's
[32:44] life and you can see here a scar from a
[32:47] forest
[32:49] fire that happened in a certain year or
[32:52] a certain time of this believer's life
[32:54] you can see the first year when it was
[32:57] born you can can see the Rainy Seasons
[33:00] that uh the tree grew more it was it's
[33:03] wider then in the dry seasons it it was
[33:06] much closer together that year was
[33:08] wasn't as fruitful it wasn't as
[33:10] rainy say this happened last year this
[33:13] happened the year before five years this
[33:16] happened in my life brother John or in
[33:18] our family or this certain church or on
[33:20] my job and you can so describe to where
[33:23] it becomes like a forest fire it's
[33:26] amazing you can see the scar of this
[33:29] tree what it's been through when you cut
[33:31] it like this isn't that amazing in the
[33:34] next slide I wanted to show you this 24
[33:37] year old tree and how the Rings and then
[33:40] the things that happen in its life but
[33:43] there was a certain year but it looks to
[33:46] me like around after the 10th year of
[33:48] this person's life that something
[33:51] happened to cause a
[33:53] knot can you see that some issue came up
[33:56] it just looked like things are going
[33:58] along fine and things were good you have
[34:00] dry years you have wet years you feel
[34:03] close to God sometimes then there's
[34:05] times you don't feel as close but we're
[34:07] talking about matters of the heart we're
[34:09] talking about a person's life and you
[34:13] can see at some time in their
[34:16] life something happened and it lasted
[34:19] for 5 years it was a knot it was an
[34:23] issue it was a situation it was
[34:25] something happened but but did they make
[34:28] it
[34:29] through did they make it through can you
[34:32] see that for years after I I trust we're
[34:35] doing okay brother Ryan for years later
[34:39] whenever it came around to that certain
[34:41] you know September the 17th or came
[34:44] around to March the 24th it oh it's like
[34:48] an anniversary it's like something you'd
[34:51] like to put it behind you but it caused
[34:53] such a knot and a thing in your life
[34:55] your health your family for 5 years this
[35:00] person or maybe it's a church went
[35:01] through a situation but they came out of
[35:05] it and even though this tree was cut
[35:09] down and you can see the years now
[35:11] they're 24 years old
[35:13] 24 this morning the Holy Spirit laid it
[35:17] upon brother John's heart to say you got
[35:19] to get over the
[35:21] knot you can't live the rest of your
[35:24] life all knotted up and describing and
[35:27] talking about this and somebody done
[35:30] somebody wrong song and you sing that as
[35:32] a you know that's your testimony and no
[35:34] matter how great of meetings you go to
[35:36] who's preaching it's like you always
[35:39] default back on Monday and Tuesday back
[35:41] to the not in your life you know this
[35:44] happened and I want to tell you about it
[35:46] and and friends we got to go further
[35:49] than that amen I I'm speaking I'm taking
[35:51] the Liberty cuz brother Aaron gave me
[35:54] liberty but to speak to Arizona
[35:56] Believers Church and you're now almost a
[35:58] year old here that it's time for us that
[36:02] have come here and will come here that
[36:04] are wounded and been hurt to stop
[36:07] talking about the thing that happened a
[36:10] year ago two years ago three years and
[36:13] you keep going around and around and
[36:15] around it's time for us to be restored
[36:18] and let our hearts be
[36:21] recovered you got to learn to breathe
[36:23] again you got to learn to let go of the
[36:26] past and say I'm not going to let my
[36:28] future be defined by my past I'm going
[36:32] on I'm pressing on I I'm not I don't
[36:34] understand why it happen I'm not here to
[36:36] say this that or the other but I am
[36:39] going on and today is the day when God
[36:42] is saying it's time for you to come out
[36:44] of this
[36:47] knot your past does not define you that
[36:51] hurt does not define you Satan thought
[36:53] he was going to let you lay in the
[36:55] valley and in the desert and you're just
[36:57] going to be dry until the Rapture and
[37:00] probably miss the Rapture and God is
[37:02] saying no I'm sending a voice I'm
[37:04] sending a message this desert's going to
[37:07] bloom again and I'm going to breathe
[37:09] life into that Valley and somebody's
[37:12] going to stand up and say Here I Am
[37:16] Lord in the next slide I trust this is
[37:19] okay you can see that for 20 years of
[37:23] this person's life it was very very uh
[37:28] small let's just say brother loyal they
[37:30] didn't know the Lord that their
[37:32] spiritual Li everything was really small
[37:34] you can see for 20
[37:36] years that's how it
[37:39] was what's that or 50 for Brother John I
[37:44] mean really brother
[37:46] John your heart's been restored can you
[37:49] stand up brother John not just natur
[37:52] you're not going to
[37:54] stand brother John doesn't know a lot of
[37:57] you because he sits way up here but this
[37:59] is brother just turn around and look at
[38:01] this wonderful this is Brother John faum
[38:04] I mean brother he didn't even know
[38:06] brother Wes niggard very good and we
[38:08] come to the same church so I'm
[38:10] introducing
[38:12] you not only has brother John had a
[38:15] spiritual change he's actually had a
[38:17] natural change in his heart he he could
[38:20] talk more about a heart that has been
[38:22] hurt and in
[38:24] trouble than any of us probably could
[38:26] and God came and literally he has the
[38:29] documentation said that his heart is
[38:32] fine it it's clicking well he don't need
[38:35] to always go back and have him check it
[38:37] and have him check it and have him check
[38:39] it but his heart has been restored he
[38:41] could he when brother John says a
[38:43] restored heart he can says I know
[38:45] exactly what you're talking about but
[38:47] he's here as a witness to all of us that
[38:49] when that would happen to anyone in this
[38:51] church you can say but what God did for
[38:54] him he can do for me and it happens to
[38:57] your wife wife thank you brother John
[38:58] when it happens to your wife you can say
[39:00] but honey God did this for that sister
[39:03] God Did It for that brother well look at
[39:05] we know that family and it always hasn't
[39:08] been easy for them and yet when we see
[39:10] them they're bubbly I mean look at like
[39:12] sister Caden I mean you shake her hand
[39:14] and she smiles and she's like she loves
[39:17] you she's no matter what's happened in
[39:20] her life she loves the Lord

[39:43] service till I get it like this from
[39:44] that little boy and you know what I
[39:46] finally got
[39:49] it I was in another meeting in Dallas a
[39:52] few weeks ago and this brother sitting
[39:54] right over here just sat like this the
[39:56] whole service wouldn't smile
[39:58] kind of looking at brother joh I said

[40:08] to serve the Lord for 20 years this
[40:12] person had it really tight didn't have a
[40:15] lot of water but something happened you

[40:25] biosolids but it increases their growth
[40:29] rate it begins to the fertile soil

[41:20] heart because I believe with all my
[41:22] heart that if some of you today would
[41:24] give your heart to the Lord he knows how
[41:27] to take care of
[41:29] issues guard your heart for out of it
[41:32] are the issues of life and we see when a
[41:35] person gives their life to Christ it
[41:38] doesn't mean that bad things won't
[41:40] happen to
[41:41] you it means now that throughout this
[41:45] scar brother Ryan's getting his exercise
[41:48] this morning throughout this
[41:50] scar it affected years of this person's
[41:54] life and even when they came out of the
[41:56] fire for years to follow you can see
[41:59] that little halting they're
[42:02] halting they're
[42:05] halting but I'm here to tell you today
[42:08] that person made it through that fire
[42:11] scar I mean there's years that we don't
[42:14] grow as much there's years that we grow
[42:16] more but thanks be to God as the bride
[42:19] tree the next slide tells us all about
[42:22] it in Psalms 107:20 he sent his word and
[42:25] healed them and delivered them from
[42:28] their
[42:30] destructions God has sent his word to
[42:33] you how many are thankful for the
[42:35] message of the hour here's Harvest Time
[42:38] preached right in Phoenix Arizona
[42:40] speaking about a phoenix or someone that
[42:41] would rise from the
[42:43] ruins some of you ought to say that's me
[42:46] brother John say when I'm going to
[42:48] Phoenix it's going to be dry miserable
[42:50] and a bunch of cactus and there ought to
[42:52] be nope I'm going to see some flowers
[42:54] and some Sons and Daughters of God that
[42:57] they're vibrant they're like lies
[42:59] they're like
[43:03] yes God has sent his word and healed you
[43:08] that means he's making you healthy God
[43:10] is he is your healer he's your physician
[43:14] praise God he he's the Healer of my
[43:16] hurts of all the nations involving a
[43:19] restored favor of individual distresses
[43:21] God is in control of the matter it's
[43:23] like we can be in the middle of a dark
[43:25] time and God walks into the the room and
[43:27] says I'm the light for this
[43:30] situation to be healed means literally
[43:33] of persons or of national hurts or of
[43:35] individual defects he sent his word and
[43:38] healed them that means
[43:45] literally would he come up
[43:47] here can you come up here brother can
[43:50] you come up and see brother John now
[43:52] this young man invited me to church
[43:53] today Hallelujah he invited me to church
[43:58] not last Wednesday but the Wednesday
[44:00] before I kind of came walking through
[44:01] the hallway and he stepped out and he
[44:03] saidou welcome come on in chch I said
[44:05] can I come in there says yeah we're
[44:07] having church he said you can come
[44:09] tonight and you can come to every
[44:12] service I have come to every service
[44:15] since he invited me
[44:19] Hallelujah so I I came to church today
[44:21] brother are you happy about that but
[44:23] yesterday we were sitting at the
[44:26] table e eating this uh good tasty soup
[44:29] and things and then he comes walking in
[44:32] and we start talking about baptism and
[44:33] things he's 8 years old but we started
[44:36] talking about baptism and things like
[44:38] that and how do you know and different
[44:42] times you talk to your parents you might
[44:43] talk to brother Aaron God starts working
[44:46] on your heart and brother John's been
[44:48] down the road enough to know that you
[44:50] know as a young person so it's good for
[44:53] them to know what they're
[44:55] doing that just being being baptized
[44:57] when they're too young because there's
[45:00] many teenagers that grow up and they say
[45:03] I was baptized when I was a young girl a
[45:05] young boy but I really didn't know what
[45:07] I was doing and they want to be
[45:09] re-baptized they want to say I've given
[45:11] my heart back to Jesus so it's very
[45:13] important when they're younger to know
[45:16] that when they're baptized it's for the
[45:18] rest of their life but we were talking
[45:20] about this yesterday and he looked
[45:23] across the the table and you said this
[45:25] word that I just said on the on that
[45:28] screen
[45:30] literally is that an
[45:33] animation do you need to
[45:36] press I don't oh no go back please go
[45:39] back it's right there in the middle
[45:42] literally and he looked at me and said
[45:44] literally and I said you're exactly
[45:46] right it's
[45:47] literally how many's thankful for the
[45:50] Lord that he's literal today isn't that
[45:52] some dream God bless you brother thank
[45:54] you for inviting me to church amen thank
[45:57] you
[45:58] brother maybe he'll invite in some lady
[46:02] one day and say come on in we're having
[46:04] church and it's going to be the last one
[46:06] wouldn't that be fantastic and you all
[46:08] said oh that brother John that's so cute
[46:10] no he might invite in the last man like
[46:13] JD walked in here a few minutes ago and
[46:16] and brother alderson's talking and we're
[46:18] talking to him he says yeah I just gave
[46:20] my heart to the Lord a few days ago and
[46:23] we said praise God that is wonderful
[46:27] and he said I just had to tell somebody
[46:29] I said thank you very much I said all of
[46:30] these people the Lord has changed our
[46:33] heart to praise God I mean people that's
[46:36] not even Believers you say well they
[46:38] don't believe the prophet of Malachi 4
[46:40] but friends you got to invite them you
[46:42] got to be salty you got to love people
[46:45] they want what you got I mean
[46:48] literally let's all say
[46:50] literally
[46:52] Hallelujah are are we preaching enough
[46:54] of the word are y'all doing okay
[46:57] in the next slide I wanted to introduce
[46:59] you to this place Danielle you're
[47:01] familiar with
[47:03] this last year in
[47:06] June uh my father and mother that I
[47:08] think streaming right now it was their
[47:10] wedding
[47:12] anniversary and so I took them to Olive
[47:15] Garden and it's just across the street
[47:17] from this Care Medical
[47:21] Center and in the next slide you can see
[47:25] I I remember parking my car with my wife
[47:28] and we were meeting my parents there and
[47:31] when I looked across the parking lot I
[47:33] saw that it was the wound healing
[47:37] Center and something this is June my my
[47:40] daughter's birthday is June the 15th I
[47:42] think the 16th is my parents anniversary
[47:45] so here I was in a parking lot look
[47:47] across and I saw the wound healing
[47:50] Center and I thought wow here's a
[47:53] place that the world says if you have a
[47:56] wound you can come into this wound
[47:58] healing Center and we've got what you
[48:00] need to heal that wound I thought why
[48:03] can't there be a wound healing Center
[48:06] for God's people I know a lot of wounded
[48:09] people I know people in the message they
[48:11] been through churches and families and
[48:13] issues and they're wounded I said Lord
[48:16] if you can do that for the natural you
[48:18] can do it for the spiritual and from
[48:20] that time we begin to minister and labor
[48:23] and I think this church actually started
[48:25] after that June but if you go to the
[48:27] next slide this is it was a part of the
[48:29] St Joseph Medical Group and it was
[48:31] called the wound healing Center you go
[48:34] to the next slide and and we talked
[48:36] about the wounds and we spoke some
[48:38] messages for young people and uh even
[48:41] locally globally it's gone about the
[48:43] wound healing Center and how that if you
[48:46] had a wounded heart or you have a
[48:47] wounded situation that God can help you
[48:50] the great physician now is near he sent
[48:53] his word and it healed the people you
[48:56] know just to know that you know it's not
[48:59] the end it's not all over God there is a
[49:01] there's a rescue for this the search and
[49:04] rescue is after you and they're going to
[49:07] find
[49:08] you and so we've spoke about that but
[49:11] now in the next slide and I'm coming
[49:13] down to this morning's message which I
[49:16] really want everyone to get because in
[49:19] this wound healing Center that's what
[49:21] they deal with is
[49:23] bruises wounds
[49:27] next
[49:28] slide whether it's on your leg or on
[49:31] your shoulder on your hand an abrasion
[49:34] or on your foot you can see how this
[49:36] person on your right hand side to try to
[49:39] you say but I want to run I come on
[49:42] brother Mitch let's go run today or
[49:43] let's go ride a bike this person would
[49:45] say I'm
[49:47] wounded I would love to It's No Lack of
[49:50] Desire but this certain thing happened
[49:53] and I just can't do that I I know I need
[49:56] exercise I know I'd like to be with
[49:57] brother Mitch and I know I'd like to get
[49:59] out there but look at my foot and you
[50:02] say oh I
[50:05] understand or we see people in the
[50:07] church and they come walking in and they
[50:10] have their families but really you can
[50:12] see that there's a wound there's a
[50:15] scar you say I would love to praise I
[50:18] would love to be a strong believer I
[50:20] would love to just be dynamic but
[50:22] brother John when that happens in church
[50:25] or when I see it just there's just
[50:26] something in me like a heaviness like a
[50:28] Brokenness and I can't rise up out of
[50:31] that that's what a wound healing Center
[50:33] is for it's for you to come in wounded
[50:36] and to be
[50:39] helped next
[50:41] slide you can see the different stages
[50:44] of of a wound and how it can be very
[50:46] very raw and very much immediate and
[50:48] very much like this is
[50:51] real and then as time goes on it has a
[50:54] way of healing it has a way of bringing
[50:58] you
[50:59] back but there will be a scar there
[51:02] there's like a something that happened
[51:05] on the next slide you can see a scar
[51:08] that this happened and you know you does
[51:10] any of you have it on your hand or on
[51:12] your arm where or on your leg you say
[51:14] that's a scar I remember that was that
[51:16] happened I remember this happened I
[51:18] remember a
[51:19] fox you know I was in a field and a fox
[51:23] and then brother Donnie rean talks about
[51:25] scars and and he a fox that bit him on
[51:27] his hand some of you might have been a
[51:29] dog and you might have fell down and
[51:31] it's like there's always that tenderness
[51:34] at this certain part of the situation
[51:38] and it's caused a
[51:39] scar next slide but what I wanted to
[51:42] Bringing to you today when you look at
[51:45] that scar a scar is evidence that
[51:49] healing is taking
[51:52] place you need to stop digging at the
[51:55] scar
[51:57] you need to stop always talking about
[52:00] the scar you need this happened and you
[52:02] go around you know the next slide is
[52:05] again you can see it's like it's
[52:06] something visual something that happened
[52:08] in your past an injury but it didn't
[52:11] lead you to death some of you ought to
[52:14] be shouting by the time you leave today
[52:16] saying thank you Jesus or at least under
[52:18] your breath or in your heart you ought
[52:19] to be saying praise God lord what Satan
[52:22] thought for evil God's turned this
[52:24] around and you know what but he put a
[52:27] scar on me so that I'll always remember
[52:30] how great is our God not how bad is that
[52:33] incident or I can never trust men
[52:35] brother John or I can never have
[52:37] confidence in it no no no that's that's
[52:39] not the reason for that God allowed that
[52:41] to happen but it did not end in death
[52:46] am a scar is evidence that something
[52:50] happen in your past but it didn't take
[52:53] your
[52:54] life and you ought to be thankful today
[52:56] if you even have a desire for God you
[52:59] ought to be thankful I mean I was
[53:01] speaking to brother Michael Jenkins
[53:03] about his life and his testimony and he
[53:06] he doesn't well he knew it this morning
[53:08] because I told him but there was a
[53:10] brother from Africa a senior pastor from
[53:13] Uganda that that saw his photo that I
[53:16] had put on my status I was with the
[53:18] Jenkin family and the Torres family and
[53:21] they said is this you know Michael
[53:22] Jenkins yes you know and and I told them
[53:25] about brother and he and he just said
[53:27] praise God it just like made his day
[53:30] that you could have a Michael Jenkins go
[53:33] through what he's gone through in his
[53:35] life family and past and be serving God
[53:39] and be a song leader at Arizona
[53:41] Believers
[53:43] Church I mean that brother in Africa was
[53:46] just so elated brother Michael and I had
[53:48] to tell brother Michael we're not even
[53:50] aware sometimes that we are positively
[53:53] being a testimony for others that God
[53:56] God is alive God is restoring my heart I
[54:00] I'm a work in progress say where' that
[54:03] scar come from your face why is that

[54:20] God I have a scar across my face but I
[54:23] have my nose and I have my face pray
[54:26] praise be to
[54:29] God a lot of people complain about their
[54:32] feet and their shoes until they meet
[54:34] somebody that don't have feet and they
[54:36] don't have shoes then they
[54:38] realize God's blessed
[54:41] me so you can see here in the next slide
[54:44] I'm I'm not going to stay on it long
[54:46] because it's a little
[54:48] bit open here but on the left you can
[54:51] see this burn that happened on
[54:54] someone's body
[54:56] and after 120 days after four months you
[55:00] can see on the right hand side the same
[55:03] arm same leg same situation but there's
[55:06] a

[58:30] forward I am turning my face toward the
[58:37] sun I am being
[58:40] healed it's okay brother John God's got
[58:43] it all in control say but do you know
[58:46] everything about tomorrow no I
[58:48] don't but I've got it all it's in his
[58:51] hands let's turn to Psalms 103 please
[58:56] as we come now to the end of the service
[58:58] and the
[59:07] day how many's ever read in the Book of
[59:10] Psalms and
[59:12] seen for the psalm for the sons of Kora
[59:15] for the sons of Kora for the sons of
[59:17] Kora have y'all ever seen that I I don't
[59:20] think this is one of those but this is a
[59:22] Psalm of David but there's many Psalms
[59:24] written in Psalms it says for the sons
[59:27] of Kora and some of you might remember
[59:30] what Kora did when they he stood against
[59:33] Moses and stood against the message and
[59:35] tried to say we're going to do this that
[59:37] and the other and God swallowed them up
[59:40] with the Earth yall remember that but do
[59:43] you know in the Bible it says the sons
[59:46] of Kora died
[59:48] not and that is a whole another service
[59:51] it's just a oneliner in fact I I don't
[59:54] know if it's in numbers or what chapter
[59:55] it says says but the sons of Kor died
[59:58] not and in the other place where the
[1:00:00] Joshua Judges that says the ground
[1:00:02] opened up and them their wives and
[1:00:04] children all got swallowed up it makes
[1:00:07] it look like everybody that was
[1:00:09] connected to them died but there's one
[1:00:12] verse in the Bible that says the sons of
[1:00:14] Kor died not in other words that he had
[1:00:17] some family members that said we're not
[1:00:19] going to be part of that we're not going
[1:00:21] to be part of that bad mouth in and
[1:00:23] what's going on we believe the message
[1:00:25] We Believe what a prophet said we're
[1:00:27] going on to the promised land and some
[1:00:30] of you know you can read it in chonicles
[1:00:32] and other places the the kites became a
[1:00:35] whole family in the message that they
[1:00:37] were helpers around the church and they
[1:00:39] were they helped and they sang and you
[1:00:41] can read that it was the family of Kora
[1:00:44] that died not they kept being a
[1:00:46] testimony and where others you say well
[1:00:49] what about Judas or what about Kora oh
[1:00:52] bad thing bad bad bad family but there
[1:00:54] were some in that family that said we're
[1:00:57] not going to let what happened to that
[1:00:59] Dad of ours or that Uncle or that
[1:01:01] Grandpa we're going on with
[1:01:03] God read the Psalms and where it says
[1:01:06] the sons of Kora read where it talks
[1:01:08] about the kites they were a family in
[1:01:10] the church that kept on serving God I

[1:05:28] mean that you get crabby nasty opposite
[1:05:32] and
[1:05:33] negative just because you've been down a

[1:05:59] that so that our new youth is renewed
[1:06:04] like the
[1:06:05] eagles y'all ever think you're really
[1:06:07] old yall to go hiking with brother Dale
[1:06:09] back there he he took me hiking the
[1:06:11] other day and he's going up and down the
[1:06:13] mountains and down the trails I'm like
[1:06:15] praise God if I in half like this when
[1:06:17] I'm 80 something years old God renew our
[1:06:21] youth it energizes you when you see
[1:06:24] someone in the church serving in and
[1:06:26] doing and going when you know in their
[1:06:28] private life there's issues or there's
[1:06:31] things they're not using it for a crutch
[1:06:34] they're doing something for God and when
[1:06:37] job prayed for his friends that's when
[1:06:40] God answered his
[1:06:41] prayers so go to the last book of Job
[1:06:44] and read that again when job prayed for
[1:06:47] his friends that's when God gave him a
[1:06:50] double portion maybe you need to pray
[1:06:52] for others just do it for others do
[1:06:54] something for
[1:06:56] somebody else and watch God do something
[1:06:58] for you he'll restore your heart he'll
[1:07:01] restore your life he he he wants to
[1:07:04] bring you don't forget about all his
[1:07:06] benefits and what he's trying to do in
[1:07:08] your life and bring it all
[1:07:11] back our last quote here brother John's
[1:07:14] going to move it along here as brother
[1:07:16] brandham closed out the church age book
[1:07:19] he said not for one moment do I bring a
[1:07:21] message to the people that they may
[1:07:24] follow me or join my my church or start
[1:07:26] some fellowship and organization I have
[1:07:29] never done that and will not do that now
[1:07:31] I have no interest in those things but I
[1:07:33] do have an interest in the things of God
[1:07:36] and people and if I can accomplish just
[1:07:39] one thing I will be satisfied that one
[1:07:42] thing is to see established a true
[1:07:44] spiritual relationship between God and
[1:07:47] Men wherein men become new creatures in
[1:07:50] God filled with his spirit and live
[1:07:52] according to his word I would invite and
[1:07:54] plead and warn and all to hear his voice
[1:07:57] at this time and yield your lives
[1:07:59] completely to him even as I trust in my
[1:08:01] heart that I have given my all to him
[1:08:04] God bless you and may his coming Rejoice
[1:08:08] your heart how many you would just say
[1:08:10] Lord I don't want to draw things to
[1:08:12] myself I want to draw them to you
[1:08:14] Lord and I want to see a spiritual
[1:08:17] relationship between myself and you Lord
[1:08:21] so that I would be able to draw others
[1:08:23] to you Lord
[1:08:26] to see this established a true spiritual
[1:08:29] relationship between God and
[1:08:33] Men you and I have an obligation if God
[1:08:37] restores your heart for you to help
[1:08:40] someone else's heart to be
[1:08:46] restored we've been in the wound center
[1:08:48] we've been healed now it's some of you
[1:08:50] have heard messages and you're so
[1:08:52] grateful brother Aaron McGary moved to
[1:08:54] this area
[1:08:57] and you're so happy and and I see it
[1:08:59] I've been with you even yesterday I felt
[1:09:01] the energy of this
[1:09:05] congregation I think it's good for all
[1:09:07] of us to say you know
[1:09:09] what the past is the past we're going
[1:09:12] forward in the name of the Lord and
[1:09:14] we're not going to fellowship and talk
[1:09:16] even with one another about all the bad
[1:09:19] things and start listing them all down
[1:09:21] we're going to it might be a valley and
[1:09:23] it still might be a valley of dry bones
[1:09:26] in some of your situations and I trust
[1:09:29] that no one misunderstood brother John
[1:09:31] today there might still be a valley in
[1:09:33] your life there might still be dry bones
[1:09:36] there might be somebody walking here
[1:09:37] next Sunday that's really really
[1:09:41] broken and they need some time that's
[1:09:45] not the time to say get out of the wound
[1:09:47] healing Center get out of here we're all
[1:09:49] liberated no you need to bring that
[1:09:51] person in like you were healed that God
[1:09:54] had time for you like someone looked
[1:09:56] beyond your fault and saw the need and
[1:09:59] ministered to you and poured in oil and
[1:10:01] poured in wine but you can't live at the
[1:10:04] end

[1:11:20] me over an hour but God bless you let's
[1:11:23] leave the wound healing Center and say
[1:11:25] you know what I'm going to live the rest
[1:11:27] of my life so that someone else can be
[1:11:29] healed heavenly
[1:11:31] father I spoke what you laid on my heart
[1:11:34] about a restored heart
[1:11:36] today I've heard the testimonies of many
[1:11:39] in this
[1:11:41] church we've been around them for a few
[1:11:43] days we've been in their homes Lord I
[1:11:46] could have took the last week and just
[1:11:48] stayed in my little room and listen to
[1:11:51] tapes I could could have prayed the
[1:11:53] whole time and we we still would have
[1:11:55] had a wonderful service today but for
[1:11:58] the last few days we've went out of our
[1:12:01] comfort zone we've went into homes we've
[1:12:03] went into coffee shops we've went down
[1:12:05] Trails we wanted to know the people we
[1:12:08] wanted to get to know them personally we
[1:12:11] wanted to know their lives and what
[1:12:13] they'd gone through Lord we're not
[1:12:16] avoiding the past we're it's not like we
[1:12:19] can't talk about it but we're asking
[1:12:22] today for healing and strength oil and
[1:12:26] wine and for Spiritual
[1:12:29] courage that if there's any of your
[1:12:31] people that are here that have been into
[1:12:35] that spiritual wound healing
[1:12:37] Center and there's always that human
[1:12:40] feeling and way that I wish I could live
[1:12:43] here I I wish it was like this all the
[1:12:46] attention and all
[1:12:48] the WoW you can see I can sleep here
[1:12:52] and but you got to leave that place
[1:12:56] you got to go out the front door and you
[1:12:58] got to go back to your life in
[1:13:01] Christ Lord Jesus that's where we need
[1:13:04] strength that's where we need
[1:13:06] Faith that's where we need to take what
[1:13:09] we've heard and put it into
[1:13:11] practice don't let us be Sunday morning
[1:13:15] Christians don't let us just be people
[1:13:18] that when the preachers preaching we yes
[1:13:20] but then we got to go back to our sorrow
[1:13:23] and back to our confusion and back our
[1:13:26] Darkness Lord we've heard a whole
[1:13:27] message today on a restored heart that
[1:13:31] our hearts are being restored our
[1:13:33] attitudes are being restored our our
[1:13:36] spirit is being
[1:13:37] renewed we're receiving the heart of God
[1:13:40] this message has the power and the
[1:13:44] anointing behind it to heal the
[1:13:47] brokenhearted those that are
[1:13:49] bruised oh there have been those that
[1:13:51] have been
[1:13:53] troubled those that even have death on
[1:13:56] them those that are stinky those that
[1:13:59] are wrapped in grave
[1:14:03] clothes maybe somebody was trying to
[1:14:05] make their
[1:14:07] Tombstone and a little feeble broken
[1:14:11] humble man after 4 days come up to the
[1:14:15] tomb and begin to weep and he opened up
[1:14:18] his mouth and he said
[1:14:21] Lazarus come
[1:14:23] forth and there was so much power of the
[1:14:26] Resurrection in those words that a man
[1:14:29] that had been dead and stinking and
[1:14:31] Grave clothed came walking out of
[1:14:34] there Satan thought he had our Tombstone
[1:14:37] all being made up that we were going to
[1:14:40] be another one of his
[1:14:41] statistics just another man just another
[1:14:44] woman just another young person just
[1:14:47] another family just another church it's
[1:14:50] just another startup group that's just
[1:14:52] going to go along and along
[1:14:55] Lord but today we've heard a
[1:14:58] message that puts some strength into us
[1:15:01] like vitamins it's an encouragement it's
[1:15:04] someone from the outside coming to visit
[1:15:07] us to give us a word of
[1:15:11] encouragement I bless them today Lord I
[1:15:15] bless this little gathering of people I
[1:15:18] pray for the future that you'd provide a
[1:15:20] place for them of worship and
[1:15:22] Gathering oh as our brother spoke
[1:15:25] yesterday of the past history even of
[1:15:28] this own City and how you came after a
[1:15:31] certain time and provided a place I
[1:15:34] believe there's a place
[1:15:36] provided I believe there's a
[1:15:40] sanctuary I believe there's an
[1:15:43] altar I believe there's a closing Lord
[1:15:46] and an atmosphere for these people that
[1:15:49] they can be healed they can walk out say
[1:15:53] thank you thank you thank you Jesus they
[1:15:58] nod at the nurse they thank the
[1:16:00] secretary they wave to the doctor and
[1:16:03] they say thank you thank you thank
[1:16:07] you thank you Jesus is there anybody
[1:16:10] here like that that with all our heads
[1:16:12] bowed would just slip up your hand and
[1:16:14] say thank you Jesus thank you Lord
