[0:00] but um today we're wanting to continue
[0:03] on the subject of our family tree my
[0:05] subtitle is God's Grove and I trust that
[0:08] this would mean something to you as we
[0:09] continue the first service we took on
[0:11] this we called a vision of home and we
[0:14] took Drew a lot from uh certain elements
[0:17] in the scripture of in the book of uh
[0:20] Genesis and also kind of forward looking
[0:22] to the Book of Revelation just a lot of
[0:23] things that were kind of coming together
[0:25] and piecing together to see where we
[0:27] began and where the tree of life was and
[0:29] where it's going to be and we did it to
[0:31] kind of um rearticulate the vision that
[0:34] we have for our church and what I
[0:35] believe God desires to accomplish in a
[0:38] local church which kind of fed into last
[0:40] week's service on this church serves the
[0:44] true church kind of making sure that we
[0:46] recognize that as much pride that we may
[0:48] take in church and as much as we feel
[0:50] this is an important place of God and we
[0:53] have rules and we have certain
[0:55] responsibilities and obligations and we
[0:57] recognize that even a church is
[0:59] sovereign the local church is not
[1:01] sovereign or Master over the true church
[1:04] but the local church serves the true
[1:06] church and so today just want to take
[1:09] the subject of God's Grove and I felt
[1:13] that the Lord had Del just put it in my
[1:15] heart so strictly and so so particularly
[1:18] that I've uh taken a been very
[1:21] purposeful and made a deliberate effort
[1:23] to try to take a step higher myself
[1:25] personally and then desire to see the
[1:27] church take a step higher in the vision
[1:29] that God has has for us that we ought to
[1:31] be Visionary we ought to be thinking
[1:32] about what God wants us to do and we've
[1:34] been using the image of the tree as
[1:37] representative of Christ Christ is the
[1:39] tree of life and so you have Christ as
[1:42] the tree Christ is our family tree he is
[1:44] the vine we are the branches and then we
[1:46] even see that uh that tree then is
[1:49] represented of us as his body or the
[1:51] bride tree and then from that we can uh
[1:54] bring it to the tree is representative
[1:56] of our families and how we have our
[1:58] family identity and family respons
[1:59] responsibilities and then kind of taking
[2:01] that and looking at it in terms of this
[2:04] church and as you look at Genesis chap
[2:07] 21 verse 33 this is I'm just going to do
[2:10] a a deep dive into the scripture today
[2:13] and just um buckle up and follow with me
[2:17] on in this journey if this is a road
[2:18] trip you put your seat belts on if we're
[2:21] walking just keep Pace with me we're
[2:22] going to go on a journey in this
[2:24] scripture and we know that God
[2:26] deliberately uses symbols and certain
[2:28] actions in the Bible or certain actions
[2:29] in the Bible as symbols even uh to hold
[2:32] a mystery of his will like he acts he
[2:34] does something and when he does it he's
[2:37] kind of foreshadowing or he's expressing
[2:39] something about his character and so we
[2:41] just we don't just take any Scripture
[2:43] lightly and think oh well that's just
[2:44] filler or or that's just put in there to
[2:46] give us some backstory all of it has
[2:48] meaning and it stands for something and
[2:50] here in verse 33 it says and Abraham
[2:52] planted a Grove in berseba and called
[2:56] there on the name of the Lord the
[2:59] Everlasting ing God I'd like to take
[3:01] time in just going through almost every
[3:03] single element of this verse and we
[3:05] don't need to spend much time on Abraham
[3:07] and who he is but when he plants this
[3:10] Grove in berseba and calls there in the
[3:12] name of the Lord uh this is a symbol of
[3:15] our family tree it's a symbol of Christ
[3:18] it's a symbol of the body of Christ it's
[3:20] a it's even symbolic of our local church
[3:22] so there's a lot that we can gain by
[3:24] looking at this and this first action
[3:27] that I want to look at it says Abraham
[3:29] we know who Abra is it says he planted
[3:31] Nat in the Hebrew it's the act of fixing
[3:34] something or establishing something and
[3:36] so it's used of sewing seed and planting
[3:38] something you're fixing the seed in the
[3:40] ground and it's going to establish its
[3:42] root system and grow up so Abraham is I
[3:45] want you to catch kind of this thought
[3:47] that Abraham when he plants he's
[3:49] establishing something and in Genesis CH
[3:52] 2:8 it says and the Lord God planted a
[3:55] garden Eastward in Eden so when Abraham
[3:58] plants a Grove he's performing an act
[4:01] that is was previously associated with
[4:03] God and the first time we see an act of
[4:06] planting it's God that's establishing a
[4:08] garden first service in a vision of home
[4:10] we took a lot of time to look at how
[4:12] that that was a paradise this was God's
[4:14] paradise and in Genesis 2:8 if this is
[4:17] God's Eden and as God it being his
[4:21] possession it was his right it was his
[4:24] power to establish whatever he wanted in
[4:26] that Garden so he planted a garden as
[4:29] the only owner of that garden and then
[4:32] the next time that we see this act of
[4:34] planting It's associated with Noah in
[4:36] Genesis chapter 9 verses 18 to 20 and I
[4:39] want you to kind of catch who's there
[4:41] who's acting and who all is in the Earth
[4:43] and it says and the sons of Noah that
[4:45] went forth of the Ark were sham and ham
[4:47] and japeth and ham is the father of
[4:49] Canaan these are the three sons of Noah
[4:52] and of them was the whole earth
[4:54] overspread so when they come off the ark
[4:56] these are the owners of the earth these
[4:58] are the only inhabitant of the earth and
[5:00] it says and Noah began to be a
[5:02] husbandman which is speaking of
[5:04] cultivating fields and Vines and it says
[5:07] and he planted a Vineyard so now even
[5:10] Noah as the as the head of the earth
[5:12] under a promise even in Genesis chapter
[5:14] 9 uh uh God 91 God has telling to be
[5:17] fruitful multiply replenish the Earth so
[5:20] he's there H as one who's been given uh
[5:22] Dominion he's been given to power in a
[5:24] sense he's the owner of the earth and so
[5:26] now he plants just as God planted
[5:29] Genesis 2 God plants a garden now Noah
[5:32] coming as the owner of the earth he's
[5:34] he's planting just as God did and so
[5:37] when Abraham plants it's in the image of
[5:40] God when Abraham's planting again here
[5:43] he's planting in the same image of Noah
[5:45] Noah under a covenant Noah under a
[5:48] promise Noah acting according to God's
[5:50] will Abraham's doing the same thing so
[5:52] i' want you to recognize even this that
[5:54] Abraham's Act was uh moved by Revelation
[5:58] there was something behind behind what
[6:00] he was doing and it was an act of
[6:02] ownership just as God planted a garden
[6:05] in Eden and that was an act of ownership
[6:07] Noah planting a garden uh planting this
[6:09] Vineyard is an act of ownership this is
[6:11] Abraham planting this this Grove and
[6:14] it's an act of ownership taking
[6:16] ownership of the land that God had
[6:18] promised to
[6:19] him says in Romans 4:13 for the promise
[6:24] that he should be the heir of the world
[6:26] was not to Abraham or to his seed
[6:27] through the law so it was to Abraham and
[6:30] it was to his seed that he would be the
[6:32] heir of the world but it was not through
[6:34] the law but through the righteousness of
[6:36] Faith so Abraham is an heir of the world
[6:40] this he's doing something again that
[6:41] previously in scripture now we could
[6:43] always assume that people seed seeds and
[6:46] and planted things but the Bible is only
[6:48] referring to God is planting Noah is
[6:50] planting and now Abraham who's the heir
[6:52] of the world who plants a Grove as one
[6:56] who is heir of the world this is an act
[6:58] of one who owns the world though he may
[7:00] not possess it presently and though he
[7:03] may be as a stranger in this land it's
[7:05] an act of ownership to to plant this
[7:07] seed knowing that this has been given to
[7:09] me and my seed after me and so I'm
[7:13] really wanting you to C catch just in
[7:15] this I'm the reason why I'm going to
[7:16] these lengths uh and starting at this
[7:19] point is I really want you to catch the
[7:20] significance of Abraham's Act of
[7:23] planting and what he does there because
[7:25] it's connected with God's promise to
[7:29] it's it's God's promise to Abraham and
[7:32] the seed of God to come through
[7:34] Abraham in doing so in planting we we
[7:37] even mentioned this last time it's
[7:38] something that hearkens back to uh the
[7:41] Garden of Eden but then also forward
[7:43] looking to Christ he plants a tree this
[7:46] tree is going to point back to the Tree
[7:48] of Life in the beginning it's going to
[7:49] point back to the Garden of God the
[7:51] paradise of God but it's also pointing
[7:53] to the tree of life that's going to be
[7:54] in the new heavens and new earth it's
[7:56] pointing forward to Christ that one that
[7:58] would hang on a tree
[8:00] as it says in Galatians 3:16 now to
[8:03] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[8:07] made he saith not and to seeds as of
[8:10] many but as of one and to thy seed which
[8:14] is Christ now that had to have
[8:16] aggravated a lot of the Jews I'm sure
[8:19] because they believe themselves to be
[8:21] you know Isaac is the seed and then them
[8:23] coming from the seed but yet the
[8:25] prophecy of God was to his seed singular
[8:28] Paul catches this Revelation that that
[8:31] seed that was to come was Christ and
[8:33] then through him retroactively families
[8:36] of the Earth would be blessed and then
[8:37] going forward families of the Earth
[8:39] would be blessed and that seed was
[8:42] Christ so when even when Abraham is
[8:44] planting this Grove there's even an
[8:47] image of Christ being the seed that swn
[8:50] into the ground because that Grove could
[8:52] only come by seed or by
[8:54] cutting taking taking taking a cutting
[8:57] or Branch off of a tree and planting it
[9:00] in the soil and so we know that the
[9:02] Bible calls Christ the seed and he's
[9:04] also the branch brother say he's the
[9:07] branch that was cut down he's the seed
[9:09] that had to go into the ground so
[9:10] Abraham is acting in such a way towards
[9:13] expressing the very nature of Christ as
[9:15] the seed that's sewed into the ground
[9:17] that's got to come forth as a brid tree
[9:20] it's the cutting of the Lord the branch
[9:22] that's cut down but is going to Blossom
[9:24] and Bloom
[9:25] again I appreciate you you all being
[9:28] very uh attentive this morning so it
[9:31] says Abraham planted a Grove in the
[9:34] Hebrew it's a shell this word is found
[9:36] two other times in the Bible it's
[9:38] translated to tree uh the most of
[9:41] Scholars agree and it's most often
[9:42] associated with a particular tree called
[9:44] the tamask tree and it is a this is a
[9:48] great symbol this tree is a great symbol
[9:50] so I want to begin to look at this AEL
[9:52] and the meaning of this word is it says
[9:54] he planted a Grove when the Hebrew Old
[9:57] Testament was translated into the Greek
[9:58] and the sep agent it says Abraham plowed
[10:01] fields and planted so it says Abraham
[10:05] planted a Grove in berseba the Hebrew
[10:07] into the Greek it gives this image of
[10:08] Abraham planting planting but plowing
[10:11] Fields And even says a shell is a field
[10:13] under
[10:14] tillage now this act of Abraham now
[10:17] being tilling the ground and cultivating
[10:20] things it brings us to Genesis 2:5 when
[10:22] God looks upon the Earth and said there
[10:24] was not a man to till the ground so when
[10:27] he made man in verse 15 and he's going
[10:29] to put him in the earth into the garden
[10:31] it says and the Lord God took the man
[10:33] and put him into the Garden of Eden this
[10:35] paradise it says to dress it and to keep
[10:38] it that means to till it so Abraham
[10:41] again here he is Abraham the one who's
[10:43] going to bring forth the seed of Genesis
[10:45] 3:15 through his lineage is acting in
[10:48] the image of what God envisioned for the
[10:50] man in the beginning to till the ground
[10:53] so now he's not only in the image of God
[10:54] in planting in the image of Noah in
[10:56] planting he's in the image of Adam who
[10:59] Adam was placed there in the Garden of
[11:01] Eden to dress and to keep the vineyard
[11:03] to keep the garden for the benefit of
[11:05] future generations for the benefit of
[11:07] those seeds that would come forth for
[11:09] the benefit of creation and his wife so
[11:11] he placed God placed them in the garden
[11:13] with the ministry for the benefit of
[11:15] others and so this is shell in different
[11:18] translations a number of different
[11:19] translations it's translated as Grove
[11:21] and some places it's translated as a
[11:23] plantation or an orchard or Abraham
[11:26] cultivated a field even in some places
[11:28] they render an
[11:30] oak but in all these different ways of
[11:32] looking at it and taking that AEL and
[11:34] translating that word Abraham is
[11:35] creating a
[11:37] paradise Abraham is creating a garden
[11:40] it's a pleasure ground as it's referred
[11:42] to in the paradise of God it's a even a
[11:45] park is how some people view it it is a
[11:48] Grove the Bible says Abraham planted a
[11:51] Grove and it was God's
[11:53] Grove and Abraham's planting had meaning
[11:56] and purpose uh Beyond himself self when
[12:00] he planted this it was it was not just
[12:03] for his reputation it was not just an
[12:05] expression of his personality uh this
[12:08] was not a flex by Abraham where he said
[12:11] well I'm going to show these Philistines
[12:13] I'm going to plant a tree in their
[12:14] backyard and that's enough there on
[12:16] Genesis 2 uh 15 there's when he did this
[12:21] it was not uh it was not an act of
[12:23] rebellion it was not an act to send up
[12:26] signals it was not it was not just for
[12:28] pretense it was not for popularity I
[12:30] think even you could say that if you
[12:32] plant a tree you wouldn't do it in your
[12:33] neighbor's yard right if you're going to
[12:35] plant something you do it in something
[12:36] that was yours something that was uh
[12:38] that was uh had some meaning to it but
[12:41] it we shouldn't look at it as Abraham
[12:43] doing something to cause attention and
[12:44] bring it to himself but a Grove and I
[12:47] want to take time to do this a Grove is
[12:49] synonymous with worship and
[12:51] sacrifice and in this act as you would
[12:54] see that um God in the beginning would
[12:59] plant a garden and then Place Adam in it
[13:03] to till it and to dress it and to
[13:05] cultivate it and now Abraham in this
[13:08] Fallen Earth and even in the same
[13:11] general area perhaps that Adam would
[13:13] have been is now planting and
[13:15] cultivating a Vineyard or planting a
[13:17] Grove it evokes and it brings up the
[13:20] true image of worshiping the true God
[13:24] this image of offering of planting a
[13:27] Grove and it says in there called
[13:29] calling on the name of the Lord the
[13:30] Everlasting God we ought to recognize
[13:32] this Grove was a symbol of worshiping
[13:35] God in spirit and in truth it's not
[13:38] foreign for Abraham to build an altar
[13:40] and to Worship in Genesis 12:8 and it
[13:43] said he removed from th unto a mountain
[13:45] on the east of bethl and pitched his
[13:47] tent having bethl on the west and ha on
[13:50] the East and there he builded an altar
[13:53] unto the Lord and called upon the name
[13:56] of the Lord this was something that
[13:58] Abraham did by practice this something
[14:01] he was not ashamed to do and we might
[14:04] have different images of what an altar
[14:05] would look like there's a lot of uh
[14:08] historians that suggest that Abraham
[14:10] even in his root out of Heron and coming
[14:13] down into uh into the promised land
[14:16] would have seen these oblisk and these
[14:19] spires and these places of worship and
[14:21] these tall altars to false gods but an
[14:24] altar could have been just a simple
[14:25] single Stone didn't have to be something
[14:28] great or didn't have to be something
[14:30] High it didn't have to be something
[14:31] beautiful it could have been a
[14:32] collection of several Stones uh that's
[14:34] all it took for an altar even just a
[14:36] flat ground it was a place that was
[14:38] consecrated to offer worship to God so
[14:41] it wasn't a cathedral didn't have to be
[14:44] a temple it even was open air it was not
[14:46] something that would have a sign and a
[14:48] parking lot it was a place where to
[14:51] magnify God and in Abraham's case he's
[14:54] the only one who has a revelation of the
[14:56] true God so he's the only one that's wor
[14:59] worshiping in this manner so he wouldn't
[15:01] need a big house he wouldn't necessarily
[15:03] need a lot of chairs he wouldn't need a
[15:05] parking lot he wouldn't need a big
[15:06] Temple he could just have a place where
[15:08] he could begin to worship but as the as
[15:10] the as it evolved and the worshippers
[15:12] increased as the Revelation would
[15:14] increase that altar would change and
[15:16] evolve with it but when Abraham plants a
[15:20] Grove he's establishing a place as the
[15:22] Bible says to call on called there on
[15:25] the name of the Lord it means to invoke
[15:27] the name of the Lord it was a place to
[15:29] worship God to declare his name
[15:31] something is being lifted up so it was a
[15:33] place of prayer it's a place of
[15:34] meditation it was a place of exaltation
[15:37] and it was open air it was visible it
[15:39] was a place of public worship and I want
[15:42] to catch this because this is the theme
[15:43] I want to come to in the end it was a
[15:45] place of
[15:46] service not just church service but a
[15:48] place of ministry and service and
[15:51] through time though when we say Grove
[15:53] now a lot of us associate a Grove with a
[15:56] place of false worship or idolatry
[15:59] because in this image Abraham planted a
[16:01] Grove others may have been planting
[16:03] Groves and worshiping false gods but in
[16:05] this case it was something to the true
[16:07] God there's no idolatry in Abraham's act
[16:09] but in time even this act of Abraham is
[16:12] co-opted by his seed and done in the
[16:15] worship of false deities in Exodus 34:13
[16:20] it says but ye shall destroy their
[16:22] altars break their images and cut down
[16:25] their
[16:26] Groves now it's important to make this
[16:28] connection ction The Grove that Abraham
[16:30] planted is that aell it's it's a tree
[16:32] it's translated to tree but here Grove
[16:35] is actually a translation of aser the
[16:37] Babylonian goddess not even the same
[16:39] word not even really that close there's
[16:42] some that try to make some connection
[16:43] with aelle and Asher but this whenever
[16:47] God is using in this context and this
[16:49] word Grove is a translation of Asher
[16:52] it's it's a Prohibition against idol
[16:55] worship this Grove was not it's not a
[16:58] Prohibition against worship it's not a
[16:59] Prohibition against altars it's a
[17:01] Prohibition against idol worship it's
[17:03] not a Prohibition against
[17:05] trees all the arborist are condemned
[17:08] and but this is a Prohibition to
[17:10] worshiping false gods in Deuteronomy
[17:13] 16:21 Thou shalt not plant thee a Grove
[17:16] of any trees that word Grove there is a
[17:18] translation of Ashera Babylonian goddess
[17:21] not PL plant a Grove of any trees near
[17:23] unto the altar the Lord thy God which
[17:25] Thou shalt make thee it's not saying
[17:27] that it's wrong to plant trees but it
[17:29] was a worship don't plant a a a a place
[17:32] of worship to a false god near the altar
[17:35] of the Lord don't combine them don't
[17:37] join them together in Isaiah 1:29 it
[17:40] says for they shall be ashamed of the
[17:42] Oaks which you have desired now why
[17:44] would it say they to be ashamed of just
[17:45] an oak tree and you shall be confounded
[17:48] for the gardens that you have chosen
[17:50] what is it referencing false worship
[17:53] right a tree a a a the trees that
[17:56] establish the The Grove to a false deity
[17:59] the the things that they fashion and
[18:01] form to be some sort of offering and
[18:03] worship to a false god The Oaks and the
[18:05] gardens that they've desired and chosen
[18:07] these are all expressive of false
[18:10] worship but the Grove that Abraham
[18:12] planted though perverted by others in
[18:15] its true form was an offering was a a
[18:18] worship to the one true God
[18:21] am Bible says he planted a Grove it was
[18:24] a tree that he planted as I mentioned
[18:28] before it's believed to be the tamarisk
[18:29] tree this word is used in two other
[18:32] places in 1st Samuel
[18:35] 22:6 when Saul heard that David was
[18:38] discovered and the men that were with
[18:39] him now Saul Abode in giba under a tree
[18:43] in Rama having a spear in his hand and
[18:46] all his servants were standing about him
[18:48] this word when it says he he Abode and
[18:50] giya under a tree that's the same word
[18:53] when it says Abraham planted a Grove saw
[18:57] abat and give you under a Grove is what
[18:59] one could say but it's actually
[19:00] referring to a tree Abraham planted a
[19:03] tree a tamus tree and and aell is what
[19:05] he planted now I want you just to kind
[19:07] of catch the scene here Saul is the king
[19:10] of
[19:11] Israel he's abiding in giba and where is
[19:14] he he's under this tree it's a place
[19:16] where King held Court this is where he
[19:18] was with his advisers this is where he's
[19:20] finding rest and respite this is where
[19:22] he's finding tree uh shade so it's a
[19:25] noble tree it's a place where King could
[19:27] come and sit under and then advise his
[19:29] counselors and and take leave from the
[19:32] elements the harsh elements of the of
[19:34] the day so this is the only the second
[19:37] time this word is mentioned and it's a
[19:39] king abiding under in the shade then in
[19:42] chapter 31 of the same book it says all
[19:44] the men valent Ro men Rose and went all
[19:47] night and took the body of Saul and the
[19:49] bodies of his sons from the wall of
[19:51] bethan and came to jabish and burnt them
[19:54] there and they took their bones and
[19:57] buried them under AE tree at jabes and
[20:00] fasted seven days this is only the third
[20:03] time and the last time that this word
[20:05] aelle and this particular word that's
[20:07] used for Abraham planted a tree this is
[20:10] the third third time it's used and it's
[20:12] a tree under which King Saul is buried
[20:16] it's a place of resting it's a a place
[20:18] of
[20:18] Memorial it's the same tree the same
[20:21] word in Genesis
[20:23] 21 now the tree that many think it is is
[20:26] the Tams Aila this is a picture of that
[20:29] tree a a a rendering of it this is the
[20:33] tree that they believe it would be I I
[20:34] chose this picture cuz I like the fact
[20:36] that it just seems to be thriving in a
[20:38] Barren desert nothing else around it no
[20:42] grass underneath it no other vegetation
[20:44] and what a what a welcome relief that
[20:46] would be if you were in that sun we'll
[20:49] we'll experience it later on today when
[20:50] we all go stand under this tree over
[20:52] here uh uh which will be our family tree
[20:55] probably a place to get out of the out
[20:57] of the Sun but the I want to ponder what
[21:01] this tree represents and even in its
[21:03] natural form and natural purpose uh
[21:07] because its purpose speaks of the
[21:08] reality and symbolism of Abraham's act
[21:11] when Abraham planted this tree it had
[21:13] meaning behind it it held a mystery of
[21:15] God and on this tree you can't see it
[21:18] here but it has small needles not really
[21:20] leaves but small needles like pine
[21:22] needles on small branches so it kind of
[21:24] has like a pine like look and the tree
[21:26] itself is adapted for desert conditions
[21:29] and those of us in Phoenix say
[21:31] amen and one particular aspect about
[21:34] this tree is I think it's called the
[21:35] salt Cedar and and ethline in Australia
[21:38] it's it's considered an evasive species
[21:41] and everywhere else uh even in Arizona
[21:43] and Australia but yet this tree uh has
[21:46] very unique characteristics there's a
[21:48] lot maybe 90 different U species of a
[21:50] Tams but this particular one the saila
[21:53] one is the one I'm talking about and it
[21:55] has this characteristic that during hot
[21:57] days it it uh secrete
[22:00] salt and and you are the salt of the
[22:03] earth and as the salt dries it secret
[22:06] salt which dries but then during the
[22:08] night that salt actually absorbs water
[22:10] from the air wow and then the next day
[22:14] as the the heat begins to come on that
[22:16] water begins to evaporate cooling the
[22:19] air under the
[22:21] tree and so it actually has these
[22:23] natural elements to where it's suitable
[22:25] for shade to provide shade from the Sun
[22:27] almost natural air conditioning just
[22:30] through the way that it secretes salt
[22:32] and then absorbs moisture from the air
[22:33] and then as that heat comes on it it
[22:35] begins to uh evaporate that's what
[22:37] sweating does that that evaporation is
[22:39] to cool the body off and so it was it's
[22:41] a source of shade a source of cooling a
[22:44] source of rest and it's even planted
[22:46] very often it was in the in many
[22:48] different places as a break from the
[22:50] wind because of its leaves and its
[22:52] fullness it would be a shield from the
[22:54] wind this type of tree is long lived
[22:58] I found one one particular place that
[23:00] suggested that it could grow for 400
[23:03] years it's a hardwood tree can grow very
[23:06] tall up to 50 feet and it's considered
[23:09] an
[23:10] evergreen and it this particular tree is
[23:13] resistant to Drought it can thrive in a
[23:15] desert it's resistance to heat it can
[23:19] actually uh be even resistant to
[23:23] Fire and this one tree
[23:26] Grove that Abraham plants it says
[23:28] Abraham planted a Grove in the
[23:30] translation strict translation Abraham
[23:32] planted a Tamaris
[23:34] tree it's significant considering the
[23:36] events that transpired in this chapter I
[23:39] believe God arranges these things and
[23:40] this story unfolds in a particular way
[23:42] just to give indication of the
[23:44] significance of this event Genesis chter
[23:47] 17:5 he says neither shall thy name
[23:50] anymore be called Abram but thy name
[23:53] shall be Abraham for a father of many
[23:56] nations have I made thee it says in chap
[23:59] verse 6 and and you will be exceedingly
[24:01] fruitful Abram was exalted
[24:04] father but now it is Abraham which means
[24:07] a father of a multitude so Abraham is
[24:10] not just acting as the father of one
[24:13] Ishmael or even just a father of one
[24:15] Isaac later but he's acting as a father
[24:17] of many to come a father of many nations
[24:20] a father of a multitude so when he
[24:22] plants this tree this may be the kind of
[24:25] the what really inspired this whole
[24:27] thought to me on or this is where it
[24:29] began just to unfold to me that when
[24:30] Abraham plants this this isn't a tree
[24:32] for himself this isn't even a necessary
[24:35] tree just for his enjoyment but this was
[24:37] a tree for
[24:39] Generations this was a tree for his seed
[24:41] it was a family
[24:43] tree especially considering the events
[24:46] that take place at the beginning of this
[24:47] chapter in verse one it says and the
[24:50] Lord this is Yahweh Jehovah visited
[24:52] Sarah as he had said and the Lord did
[24:55] unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah
[24:57] CED conceived and bear Abraham a son in
[25:00] his old age at the set time of which God
[25:03] had spoken to him and Abraham called the
[25:06] name of his son that was born unto him
[25:08] whom Sarah buried to him Isaac this very
[25:12] chapter begins with Jehovah visiting
[25:14] Sarah and Sarah conceiving in bringing
[25:17] forth the promised son so this chapter
[25:20] really opens up and God finally
[25:21] fulfilling his promise to Abraham that
[25:24] he would have a son not after the Bond
[25:26] woman but he would have a son after
[25:27] Sarah in verse eight and the child grew
[25:29] and was weaned and Abraham made a great
[25:32] feast the same day that Isaac was weaned
[25:34] they believe they'd be around two years
[25:35] old probably no later than three that he
[25:38] had he had made it through maybe this uh
[25:40] careful time and he' made it out of no
[25:42] longer a toddler now coming into this
[25:44] young childhood and say he survived this
[25:46] treacherous time he's growing up he's
[25:48] healthy so they have a big celebration
[25:51] but then notice what happens what what
[25:53] comes into view at this time and Sarah
[25:55] saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which
[25:57] she had had born unto Abraham mocking so
[26:00] ishmail is mocking why because he's
[26:02] still the first
[26:03] born wherefore she said unto Abraham now
[26:06] this is Sarah about this other son cast
[26:09] out this Bond woman Hagar and ishmail
[26:11] cast out this Bond woman and her son for
[26:13] the son of this Bond woman shall not be
[26:16] air with my son even with Isaac now it
[26:19] may sound as if there's just a little
[26:20] bit of jealousy Sarah regretting her
[26:23] suggestion that Abraham have a son by
[26:26] her her servant and now she's saying get
[26:28] rid of the woman won't even call him by
[26:30] name get rid of his son won't even call
[26:32] him by name and it says this thing was
[26:33] very
[26:34] Grievous in Abraham's sight because of
[26:36] his son so Abraham has his wife pressing
[26:38] him on one side and now he's trying what
[26:41] what should I do now notice What God
[26:43] Says verse 12 and God said unto Abraham
[26:45] let it not be Grievous in thy sight
[26:47] because of the lad and because of thy
[26:49] Bond woman don't let it grieve you don't
[26:51] be troubled in all that Sarah hath said
[26:53] unto thee hearken unto her voice for in
[26:56] Isaac shall thy seed be called in other
[26:58] words it just wasn't merely Sarah's
[27:00] wishes but it was actually God's will
[27:03] when she said get rid of the Bond woman
[27:04] and get rid of his son and God says do
[27:07] as she said and also of the son of the
[27:09] Bond woman will I make a nation because
[27:11] he is thy seed so God still has a
[27:12] promise and a blessing and a benefit to
[27:14] ishmail and then Abraham acts and
[27:16] Abraham rose up early in the morning and
[27:18] took bread and a bottle of water and
[27:21] gave it unto Hagar putting it on her
[27:22] shoulder and the child and sent her away
[27:25] and she departed and wandered Into the
[27:27] Wilderness of Sheba and the water was
[27:30] spent in the bottle and she cast the
[27:32] child under one of the
[27:34] shrubs it's a striking
[27:37] contrast as ishmail this son of bondage
[27:39] the son of the Bond woman sits under a
[27:41] shrub under a
[27:42] bush and you have this image of the one
[27:44] who is not Heir under a shrub but the
[27:47] one who is going to be the
[27:50] heir is left with his mom and dad
[27:53] separate and and separated out
[27:58] it's even unique that it would bring
[27:59] this image of a child under a shrub
[28:01] before Abraham plants this
[28:03] tree now notice how Paul touches on this
[28:06] in Galatians chapter
[28:08] 4 in verses 22 to 23 for it is written
[28:12] that Abraham had two
[28:14] sons the one by a
[28:16] bondmaid the other by a free
[28:20] woman but he who is of the Bond woman
[28:23] was born after the flesh but he of the
[28:26] free woman was by promise
[28:28] am so here in Genesis chap
[28:31] 21 you have the family coming to be
[28:34] Abraham and his wife have no children
[28:36] but God has made a promise to them and
[28:39] then Abraham at Sarah's suggestion has a
[28:41] child by her servant and God tells them
[28:43] no he's not going to be there oh let
[28:45] ishmail live before you let him be the
[28:47] heir and he says no it's not going to be
[28:49] through Hagar but your wife Sarah that
[28:52] visitation of Elohim there H before his
[28:55] tent door your wife Sarah is going to
[28:57] conceive it next year according to the
[28:59] time of life I will visit Sarah and she
[29:01] will conceive and she will bring forth a
[29:03] son and he will be the one who is the
[29:06] heir he will be the one who is the seed
[29:08] that I promised you and now the very
[29:10] language of the word of God is that
[29:12] ishmail is that child of the Bond woman
[29:15] Isaac is the child of the free
[29:18] woman he who is of the Bond woman is
[29:20] after the flesh but he of the free woman
[29:22] is After the Promise after God so now
[29:25] these two sons though they have the same
[29:27] father
[29:28] in in the scripture they have two
[29:30] different promises two different
[29:31] inheritances and they have two different
[29:34] designations CU you can say well Abraham
[29:36] and his two sons but God doesn't want
[29:38] the picture to look like
[29:40] that so in verse 28 it says and now we
[29:44] Brethren as Isaac was are the children
[29:46] of Promise so now you see how beautiful
[29:49] this is for us we are the children of
[29:50] promise just as Isaac was the child of
[29:53] promise but as then he that was born
[29:55] after the flesh persecuted him that was
[29:56] born after the spirit even so it is now
[30:00] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[30:03] cast out the Bond woman and her son this
[30:06] is the Commandment of God this is what
[30:08] the Bible says this is what God wanted
[30:10] cast out the Bond woman her son for the
[30:12] son of the Bond woman shall not be air
[30:15] with the son of the free woman so then
[30:18] brethren we are not children of the Bond
[30:20] woman but of the
[30:22] free what is being expressed here when
[30:25] it says and Abraham planted a tree it
[30:28] was a family tree he plants a tree
[30:31] Jehovah visits Sarah at the beginning of
[30:32] this chapter it ends with uh Abraham
[30:35] calling on the name of the Lord having
[30:36] planted a tree there in berseba and
[30:39] begin to call upon the name of the Lord
[30:40] he plants a tree and it's symbolic of
[30:43] this family tree that is now put forth
[30:45] another
[30:46] Chute Abraham and Sarah now the fruit of
[30:49] this tree the fruit of this Union a
[30:51] branch has shot off that vine this is
[30:54] the seed of this of this Union this is
[30:56] the one through whom the promises going
[30:58] to come but at the same time another
[31:00] shute's been pruned
[31:02] off so this family tree comes into view
[31:05] it's not through Ishmael it's not
[31:06] through all these other seeds but the
[31:08] True Vine is
[31:09] identified when Abraham plants this tree
[31:12] in berseba it's the image of a family
[31:14] tree in its physical manifestation and
[31:16] what it would have meant literally to
[31:17] them but also in its practical
[31:19] application and its symbolism Abraham
[31:21] planted a family
[31:24] tree and notice what it says in verse 34
[31:27] Genesis 21 1: 34 3
[31:29] 34 and Abraham sojourned in the
[31:32] Philistines land many
[31:37] days this
[31:40] tree became a place that Abraham
[31:43] worshiped
[31:44] God in the presence of the
[31:52] Philistines if I gave you the impression
[31:54] that I was going to be lengthy this
[31:55] morning I don't think I'm going to be
[31:56] lengthy
[31:58] I'll leave that up to you but I I I say
[32:01] this because I feel that I'm I'm going
[32:03] to be able to uh wrap this up even maybe
[32:06] very soon because it's just a very
[32:08] simple thought I'm trying to convey and
[32:10] I'm I've arrived at it if you followed
[32:11] me this far in this that this planting
[32:15] of a
[32:15] tree the way that Abraham's acting what
[32:18] it's connected to what it stands for it
[32:21] represent something to us
[32:23] today this was not a selfish act when he
[32:26] planted this tree right as I mentioned
[32:29] before it was for the fut it was for
[32:30] future
[32:32] Generations his son now being born and
[32:36] celebrating his weaning he sees now that
[32:38] his seed is going to continue after him
[32:40] he sees the Bond woman cast out he sees
[32:42] uh ishmail go and they're going to be
[32:45] blessed God says I'm going to take care
[32:46] of them even God speaking to Hagar says
[32:48] he's going to grow he'll be fine and now
[32:50] Abraham realizes here's him and his wife
[32:52] and his son and so when he plants this
[32:55] tree he's actually planting it for his
[32:57] family
[33:00] because when you plant a
[33:02] tree you don't plant for immediate
[33:05] fulfillment any anybody ever said you
[33:08] you want to build a house you want to
[33:09] plant a tree and you just have this idea
[33:10] of a tree you can build a tree housee in
[33:13] a and you can get oranges and everything
[33:15] and so you go you go by the tree and
[33:16] you're like
[33:18] uh how long till I can get oranges off
[33:20] of this like well if it even does it
[33:23] we're talking years right and it takes
[33:26] years and years for these things to be
[33:28] able to fruit and it takes years and
[33:29] years for them to be able to grow so
[33:31] when Abraham planted a tree he didn't it
[33:33] just wasn't like one of these magic
[33:35] sponges you know it just it's this small
[33:37] and then you throw it put it in the
[33:38] ground and the next morning like wow
[33:39] what a beautiful
[33:41] Oak it wasn't a Jack in the
[33:44] beanstock it's not something for
[33:46] temporary fulfillment when you plant a
[33:49] tree you're not looking to get something
[33:50] out of it the next day you're not
[33:51] looking to get something even out of it
[33:53] that year it's something when you plant
[33:54] you're forward looking when you plant a
[33:57] tree you Planet knowing I'm putting a
[33:59] lot of work into this ground and I'm
[34:01] sewing seed and I've got expenses and
[34:02] I'm doing a lot of stuff uh in this
[34:05] moment and I'm not I may not even be
[34:06] able to enjoy it for a very very long
[34:08] time but if I care for it I plant it
[34:10] right I care for it I water it I keep it
[34:12] protected and and the life in that seed
[34:15] does its job one day others will be able
[34:18] to benefit even if it's not myself
[34:20] others will be able to benefit from it
[34:23] so it was proactive he planted this tree
[34:27] with a vision of a future shade you
[34:28] plant a tree with the vision of future
[34:30] fruit not something in the morning or
[34:31] even the next year you plant it as
[34:33] protection you plant it as a place of
[34:35] enjoyment but it's always for the
[34:37] benefit of others who come after
[34:41] you Genesis CH 1: 29 it says and God
[34:44] said behold I've given you every herb
[34:46] bearing seed which is upon the face of
[34:49] all the Earth and every tree in the
[34:52] which is the fruit of a tree yielding
[34:55] seed to you it shall be for me me why
[34:58] did God plant
[35:00] trees it wasn't a
[35:02] mistake he wasn't trying to make a man
[35:04] and actually made accidentally made a
[35:06] tree it wasn't just like what I what my
[35:09] artwork was always when I was growing up
[35:11] was just you know just do something and
[35:13] try to make sense of it God planted them
[35:16] deliberately and
[35:18] purposefully he planted trees he planted
[35:20] a paradise for his family to enjoy
[35:24] it isn't that what brother bam talked
[35:26] about when he when he preaches on future
[35:27] your home and things that are to be and
[35:29] he talks about God creating and doing
[35:31] things he said God knew you'd like this
[35:33] and God knew you'd like that and he did
[35:35] certain things with you in mind and with
[35:37] certain things in View and none of it
[35:38] was by chance and none of it was a
[35:40] mistake but God was very deliberate and
[35:42] purposeful and he created a paradise
[35:44] that was our emphasis in a vision of
[35:46] home is this is God's paradise and as an
[35:48] extreme parent he created a paradise and
[35:51] he thought of all the amenities and all
[35:53] the opportunities and everything he put
[35:54] in it he was thinking how can my son and
[35:57] his family my son and my daughter enjoy
[36:00] this Eden enjoy this Garden I'll put
[36:03] trees in there for shade I'll put them
[36:04] in there for fruit and I'll let them
[36:06] have these trees so that they can
[36:09] enjoy and in this tamask the roots go
[36:14] deep and the desert the water table the
[36:17] water stores aren't shallow they've got
[36:19] to go very very deep right and because
[36:22] they have to go very very deep to get
[36:24] the water they can grow really really
[36:26] tall they grow equally as high providing
[36:32] shade this tree is so can be so large
[36:35] that it produces beams and wood that are
[36:38] suitable for
[36:39] carpentry I thought about that just
[36:42] imagine if perhaps Abraham in his
[36:44] journeys had taken a cutting of a
[36:47] Tamarisk and planted it there in Hein
[36:49] planted it there in berseba and it gets
[36:52] propagated throughout the land and years
[36:54] later it's the tamis tree that Christ
[36:57] is a carpenter with these beams are
[36:59] suitable for construction suitable for
[37:01] building a house and this picture I have
[37:04] for you is the one on the right is the
[37:06] rendering of a Tamarisk in Israel but
[37:09] the one on the left does anybody
[37:10] recognize the one on the
[37:13] left it's in Gilbert Arizona does that
[37:16] help is there a clue
[37:18] there it's at Joe's Farm Grill I'm not
[37:21] getting paid for this I'm not guti I'm
[37:25] just telling you this is there's it at
[37:27] Joe's Farm Grill excuse me my clip is
[37:30] clipping here back here but there's two
[37:33] tamas trees two large tamas trees they
[37:35] say they're over a hundred years old and
[37:38] this is a picture go back to the other
[37:39] one if you could John the one there on
[37:41] the left that's how tall this tree can
[37:43] be look how how much shade it would be
[37:46] in the beams in the next picture this is
[37:48] not you could sit under this and eat it
[37:49] it kind of maybe were features of the of
[37:52] the Landscaping there there's even a
[37:55] Road in Gilbert called Tamers uh Avenue
[37:57] a road this is a tree that's suitable
[38:00] for the desert this is a tree that when
[38:02] it grows it looks like
[38:04] this it's a tree that could provide wood
[38:07] it could provide shelter provide
[38:10] shade and now moving on in Genesis
[38:13] chapter 21 veres 30 and
[38:16] 31 Abraham planted this tree in a place
[38:19] he called he named
[38:21] berseba now this is coming
[38:25] to I I I just love how the the the
[38:28] rhythm of this is going I just feel like
[38:30] it's moving well this is identifying
[38:33] when we come to this this place be Sheba
[38:35] we're identifying the purpose of our
[38:37] family
[38:38] tree says in Genesis 21: 30 and 31 and
[38:41] he said for these seven you Lambs shalt
[38:43] thou take of my hand that they may be a
[38:46] witness unto me that I have dig this
[38:48] well it's a conflict between Abraham
[38:51] after he'd been given back Sarah by AMC
[38:54] the conflict between Abraham and
[38:58] AMC's people where there was a fight
[39:00] over the well and they claimed that
[39:02] there was AMC's servants claimed it was
[39:04] their well Abraham said it was his so he
[39:06] gives these seven UL Lambs uh to be a
[39:09] witness that this was Abraham's well and
[39:11] they had this treaty they had this
[39:13] agreement and they lived in peace he
[39:15] says wherefore he called that place so
[39:17] it's Abraham that calls the place
[39:20] berseba even to where when it says that
[39:22] Hagar went out it's kind of using what
[39:24] would future future be named berse B
[39:27] went out into the same Wilderness
[39:28] Abraham called this place berseba
[39:31] because there they swear both of them
[39:34] there was an oath there was a Tre there
[39:36] was peace that came berse is The Well of
[39:39] seven or The Well of the oath it's at
[39:41] root it has a root of seven and even the
[39:43] root to swear they have the same letters
[39:45] the bees siba and it means The Well of
[39:49] seven or The Well of a Sevenfold oath
[39:51] and in other places it's The Well of the
[39:54] lion it's remarkable because here's
[39:56] Abraham's standing there and he gives
[39:58] this oath The Well of The Lion The Well
[39:59] of the Sevenfold oath and it marked the
[40:02] southernmost border of the promised land
[40:04] which then later belong to the tribe of
[40:06] Judah the lion nine times in the Old
[40:10] Testament you'll find the phrase from
[40:12] Dan to
[40:13] berseba and it's used to describe the
[40:15] entire promised land that went nine
[40:18] times from Dan to berseba from Dan to
[40:21] bers why indicating that when Abraham
[40:23] planted this it was it be in the
[40:25] southernmost border it's almost as if it
[40:27] this was the beginning a locking point a
[40:29] stopping point that now from here in the
[40:31] sense that this is where I've
[40:32] established and fixed a border and it's
[40:35] going to fill up and the rest is going
[40:37] to be the promised land and thean and
[40:39] this is a a significant Place Beba this
[40:42] land of oath The Well of the lion this
[40:44] is where Abraham planted a tree it held
[40:47] meaning it held significance he planted
[40:50] a Grove it was to be a Grove of worship
[40:53] because there he called on the name of
[40:54] the Lord
[40:57] so we find it coming up in other places
[40:59] in the story of Israel even in the next
[41:02] chapter after Abraham offers Isaac upon
[41:04] the Altar and God sees that he will not
[41:07] spare his son his only son it says in
[41:10] Genesis 22: 18 and 19 and in thy seed
[41:13] shall all the nations of the earth be
[41:15] blessed because thou Hast obeyed my
[41:18] voice so now this is Abraham on the top
[41:21] of that mountain at this climax of this
[41:24] mountain he takes this he takes Isaac
[41:26] and he's going to sacrific him upon an
[41:28] altar God stays his hand and remember he
[41:31] carried wood up that
[41:33] hill he took the wood up that hill to
[41:36] offer the offering the one thing they
[41:37] lacked was the lamb or the ram God
[41:39] provided the ram Abraham bore the wood I
[41:42] wonder where he got the wood took it
[41:45] from trees he took it planted he cut
[41:46] these things down he he had he had wood
[41:49] that he gathered from where he began and
[41:50] it says in verse 19 so Abraham returned
[41:53] unto his young men and they rose up and
[41:55] went together to berseba and Abraham
[41:58] dwelt at beers Sheba the Bible says he
[42:00] sojourned in the Philistines land many
[42:02] days he dwelt this was not just a
[42:04] temporary Gathering he was not just
[42:06] there for just a few days but he dwelt
[42:08] there a long time many days and after
[42:10] even going Upon This Mountain he comes
[42:12] back to
[42:14] berseba in Genesis chapter 26 it's the
[42:17] place that Isaac comes back to and he
[42:19] went up then to berseba and the Lord
[42:22] appeared unto him the same night and
[42:24] said I am the god of Abraham thy father
[42:26] fear not for I am with thee and will
[42:29] bless thee and multiply thy seed for my
[42:32] servant Abraham's sake and he builded an
[42:35] altar there and called upon the name of
[42:38] the Lord and pitched his tent there and
[42:40] there Isaac's servants digged a well
[42:43] it's the place that Isaac returns to
[42:44] right there in berseba the same place
[42:46] where Abraham built an altar he had dug
[42:48] a well he he planted a Grove and Worship
[42:51] the Lord now his own son coming back to
[42:53] the same place it says and the Lord
[42:54] appeared unto him so it's the place that
[42:56] God appeared it's a place that he builds
[42:58] an altar it's a place that he
[43:00] worships Genesis chter 46 Jacob now
[43:03] comes right back to Israel he says and
[43:05] Israel took his journey with all that he
[43:07] had and came to berseba and offered
[43:10] sacrifices unto the god of his father
[43:12] Isaac noce it was a place that they
[43:14] would return it was a particular place
[43:16] that had meaning had significance it was
[43:18] the place where Abraham the only place
[43:20] in Scripture that Abraham plants
[43:22] anything he plants a Grove he plants a
[43:24] tree he returns to worship there he
[43:27] stays there and lives Isaac comes and
[43:29] worships there God Appears to him and
[43:31] speaks to him there and then Israel
[43:34] comes back to that very place and offer
[43:36] sacrifices unto
[43:38] God in all the different places we could
[43:40] speak of berseba there's many but one in
[43:43] particular that we've been studying the
[43:44] Lord will and we'll touch on it here in
[43:46] the future but in First Kings chapter 19
[43:48] after the conflict with Jezebel it's in
[43:51] berseba where Elijah flees and sits
[43:53] under a juniper
[43:55] tree and it's there under the that
[43:57] juniper tree that he begins to rest and
[43:59] in his weariness he says it is enough
[44:00] and what does God do he begins to touch
[44:03] him he begins to feed him begins to
[44:05] minister to
[44:07] him in these places in these instances
[44:10] we've just mentioned it's a place where
[44:11] they
[44:12] worshiped was a place where God appeared
[44:14] to them it was a place where they were
[44:15] rest they rested it's where they were
[44:17] fed it's a place God
[44:19] spoke this is what's significant about
[44:22] planting a tree in beers
[44:24] Sheba and with my closing thoughts I'd
[44:27] like to just read the verse again
[44:29] Genesis
[44:31] 21:33 and Abraham planted a Grove in
[44:35] Bersa and called there on the name of
[44:39] the Lord the Everlasting
[44:42] God this is God's
[44:45] Grove this Grove I think just in these
[44:47] few simple things I wanted to share with
[44:49] you this
[44:50] morning it holds a beautiful
[44:52] mystery Abraham planting in the image of
[44:55] God the image of an own owner Abraham
[44:59] tilling in the image of
[45:00] Adam Abraham in this Grove becoming a
[45:04] place of
[45:05] worship planting a tree which was a a
[45:08] sign of nobility a place of shade a
[45:10] place of
[45:12] rest a tree that he plants after his son
[45:15] after Sarah is born it's a family tree
[45:18] it's a tree that he plants for future
[45:21] Generations a tree that he plants once
[45:23] he's made peace with the bimc it's a
[45:25] tree that he plants in in in recognition
[45:27] that his son has been weaned it's a tree
[45:29] that he plants with a forward-looking
[45:30] vision as he sojourns in the land of the
[45:33] Philistines many
[45:35] days something proactive something to be
[45:37] done to set forth to hold a beautiful
[45:42] mystery as I mentioned this before I
[45:44] want to close on this thought it was not
[45:47] a shrine to
[45:49] Abraham this was not a legacy to his
[45:51] personality this was not a boast of his
[45:53] wealth or the his particular skill as a
[45:55] husbandman but it was a place to declare
[45:58] God it was a place to worship
[46:02] God and Abraham planted a Grove in
[46:05] berseba and called there on the name of
[46:07] the Lord in the Grove in that place
[46:08] where he planted this tree in this place
[46:10] where he tilled the ground in this place
[46:12] that he uh provided this paradise this
[46:14] Grove this park there he called on the
[46:16] name of the Lord the Everlasting God as
[46:19] I mentioned before Abraham planted a
[46:21] Grove of the Hebrews a shell and in the
[46:24] Hebrew uh studies and the Hebrew
[46:26] academic and the talud and all the rabic
[46:28] literature all interpretations agree
[46:31] that the intention of this tree this is
[46:33] what it means to a Hebrew so I want to
[46:35] emphasize this this is what it meant to
[46:37] a Hebrew all interpretations agree that
[46:40] it was int the intention was
[46:44] Hospitality he didn't plant the tree for
[46:46] himself and it wasn't that's my tree and
[46:48] you can't touch it and this is mine and
[46:50] this is I put my swing in it I put this
[46:52] is my shade this is my air
[46:55] conditioning different interpretations
[46:57] that say he planted a Grove and they
[46:59] interpret it as an orchard for food and
[47:00] that food would provide the fruit of
[47:02] that tree would provide food to
[47:04] Travelers who had passed
[47:07] by in the rinic uh
[47:10] tradition the very letters that form a
[47:14] shell or an acronym and the ALF and the
[47:17] and the words that are used it's feeding
[47:19] drinking and
[47:21] accompaniment even lodin is the other
[47:23] one that some use there it's an acronym
[47:26] to feed to drink and to
[47:29] supply said that in this a shell in this
[47:32] planting a Grove in this word what it
[47:34] means to them and what was intended and
[47:36] what Abraham did it was to provide
[47:38] Hospitality not for himself but for
[47:41] others and that in feeding and drinking
[47:44] and providing lodging or accompaniment
[47:46] or amenities and supplies it's all the
[47:48] proper elements to be a good
[47:52] host that your guest would arrive safely
[47:55] and depart safely that they would arrive
[47:58] though needy they would leave taken care
[48:00] of and they would have everything that
[48:01] they
[48:03] need and and please just if you focus
[48:06] here I know maybe H H uh uh you're
[48:08] bracing for a long day we're going to
[48:09] have a second service and it's all the
[48:11] weather's starting to get hot and we've
[48:12] just come out of a long week and a
[48:14] holiday weekend uh but I think some of
[48:16] the kids are already out so it's it's
[48:17] it's summertime B stay with me for a few
[48:20] more moments but this the Hebrew
[48:22] teaching say this blessed me so much
[48:24] this is what they teach that Abraham's
[48:27] in invoking so it's just not it says and
[48:29] Abraham called there on the name of Lord
[48:31] it wasn't going lord lord lord lord
[48:33] that's not what he was doing just wasn't
[48:35] barking out a name but he was invoking
[48:38] something that his that they say that
[48:40] Abraham's invoking of
[48:42] Elam comes by the means of
[48:46] Asel in other words he didn't just say
[48:49] Lord Lord Lord Jesus Jesus Jesus but the
[48:52] asell is how he invoked the name he
[48:56] planted this Grove this Orchard this
[48:58] place of lot drinking feeding
[49:00] accompaniment this place of Hosting he
[49:03] he planted it and it was from that that
[49:06] he invoked the name of Jehovah he
[49:09] invoked the name of
[49:11] Elam in other words by the means of his
[49:14] Hospitality to all whom he would
[49:16] encounter it would be through that that
[49:18] the Everlasting God was
[49:21] exalted and the so in the tal listen to
[49:25] what they write I just want to read read
[49:26] it to you because you you'd know I
[49:28] couldn't come up with this says Our
[49:31] Father Abraham caused the name of the
[49:33] Blessed Holy One to be uttered by the
[49:36] mouth of every pass every passer by how
[49:39] was this because now I want you to think
[49:41] of our family tree amen I want you to
[49:43] think of what this church represents how
[49:45] how how we're supposed to what the
[49:47] vision would be for this family tree for
[49:49] this church what the vision should be
[49:51] for our families how we view ourselves
[49:53] and our calling and our service to one
[49:55] another we don't re a big beautiful
[49:57] building so that everybody Drives By and
[49:59] laughs at the Marquee they're not
[50:01] looking at wealth they're not looking at
[50:02] amenities they're not looking at all the
[50:03] things that we might have but notice
[50:05] what it says that it his name would be
[50:07] uttered the name of the Blessed Holy One
[50:10] would be uttered by the mouth of every
[50:11] passer by how was
[50:14] this after Travelers had eaten and drank
[50:18] they stood up to bless
[50:20] Abraham but he said to them did you eat
[50:22] of
[50:23] mine you ate of that which belongs to
[50:26] the god of the the universe instead you
[50:28] should thank praise and bless the one
[50:31] who spoke and the world came into
[50:34] being
[50:36] Hallelujah think of that he provided an
[50:38] opportunity for those who could come and
[50:41] partake in the hand of God's creation
[50:44] and the the things that God has provided
[50:46] the benefits and blessings that the
[50:48] exalted father can could bring God
[50:50] himself and they would be blessed by it
[50:52] and they would hear it and they would
[50:53] feed on it and they'd be enriched by it
[50:54] and then if they went to thank Abraham
[50:56] he said says you didn't receive it from
[50:58] me this came from God and that you
[51:01] should bless the one who spoke and the
[51:03] world came into
[51:06] existence this is how Abraham invoked
[51:09] Elam how he invoked the name of the
[51:11] Everlasting father it came by the means
[51:14] of the tree it came by the means of the
[51:16] Grove it came by the means of the place
[51:18] that he provided that he would not just
[51:20] serve himself but he would serve
[51:23] others John Wesley even concluded that
[51:26] the same and he says and called there on
[51:29] the name of the
[51:30] Lord probably in the Grove he planted
[51:33] which was his oratory or House of Prayer
[51:36] he kept up for public worship to which
[51:39] probably his neighbors resorted and
[51:41] joined with him so Wesley says men
[51:44] should not only retain their goodness
[51:46] wherever they go but do all they can to
[51:48] propagate it and make others
[51:52] good that's the image of the Grove
[51:55] that's the image of God's Grove there
[51:58] wasn't a selfish
[52:00] Vision a plantet unto a Hebrew Abraham
[52:04] planted a Grove it was a place of
[52:07] hospitality it was a place of service
[52:09] and God would be known through the
[52:12] service God would be known through the
[52:14] labor God would be known through the
[52:16] giving God would be known through what
[52:18] Abraham was doing to the
[52:22] stranger do not thank me but instead you
[52:25] should thank and praise and bless as the
[52:26] one who spoke and the world came into
[52:31] being in berseba Abraham planted a Grove
[52:35] to
[52:36] declare the Everlasting
[52:38] God it was God's Grove amen it was a
[52:42] planting it was a tree to honor
[52:45] God and it says and it was to the
[52:47] Everlasting
[52:49] God says call they call on the name of
[52:51] the Lord in Genesis 12 it said he called
[52:52] on the name of the Lord but now for the
[52:54] first time this attribute of the
[52:56] everlasting God has introduced not yet
[52:59] mentioned not yet written and even
[53:01] though Abraham would not have known him
[53:03] in his fullness as Everlasting God it's
[53:05] in this moment something in this
[53:07] planting something in this labor in this
[53:09] service in this image the Bible God
[53:12] wants Moses to write that there he
[53:14] called on the name of the Lord and it's
[53:15] invoked the Everlasting God the strong
[53:17] one the self-existing one
[53:21] amen it was God's
[53:24] Grove and there's still treat Tre today
[53:27] that exist in the same area that Abraham
[53:29] planted this
[53:32] tree and there's trees in that area that
[53:34] exist and they see these outcroppings
[53:36] and they see these areas of these tamis
[53:38] trees and they know that this indicated
[53:40] past Dwelling Places that somebody lived
[53:43] here before to think that all those
[53:46] years ago around 2000 BC here is a
[53:49] planting of a tree and thousands of
[53:52] years later those trees still exist
[53:54] today right who would have
[53:58] thought they would be lasting till today
[54:03] Abraham because he called upon the god
[54:05] of him who would be his God forever
[54:07] forever the Everlasting
[54:10] God there's a legend that says that it
[54:12] takes 400 years for a tamas tree to grow
[54:16] fully and
[54:18] completely and interesting enough I say
[54:20] it's a legend because I I wasn't able to
[54:22] confirm it because some of these can
[54:23] actually grow quite rapidly and they do
[54:25] last they live over 100 years and
[54:27] they're easily propagated so really no
[54:30] matter how you look at it this this
[54:31] thought when I saw that it could take
[54:33] 400 years to grow in this one Legend
[54:35] it's remarkable when you do the math
[54:37] about 400 years later his seed would be
[54:39] returning out of bondage in Egypt and
[54:42] come into a promised land that would
[54:43] have shade
[54:45] trees the very seeds that Abraham
[54:48] planted one day his seed would return to
[54:51] who knew they would still be there
[54:52] Abraham did who knew they would be
[54:55] needed Abraham did amen so it was an act
[54:57] of
[54:58] Revelation it was an act of service and
[55:03] sacrifice Abraham planted a
[55:06] tree this is a type of our family
[55:09] tree should be a type of Our Family
[55:12] Vision should be a type of our church
[55:20] Vision I thought a lot about of course
[55:22] it's easy when talking about trees you
[55:24] could just
[55:25] start just just thinking about trees and
[55:27] trees and trees and you'll feel super
[55:29] spiritual as you drive around because
[55:30] everywhere you see
[55:33] trees but what's been standing out to me
[55:35] as we mentioned in Prior Services is
[55:38] here the tree of
[55:41] life and the tree of knowledge of Good
[55:43] and
[55:44] Evil and it's from The Taking of the
[55:46] wrong tree that caused
[55:48] death but Christ is the tree and The
[55:50] Taking of the wrong tree was a mixing
[55:53] mixing of trees mixing of seed
[55:56] and it's Christ the Tree of Life That's
[55:58] hung on another
[56:00] tree and it's through his death hanging
[56:03] there on Calvary the carpenter the Tree
[56:06] of Life hanging on a tree that that the
[56:10] blood is shed forever consecrated in a
[56:13] way that we could be the
[56:16] vines the branches of that
[56:20] vine and in my my closing quote here at
[56:23] least that I have for the slide and
[56:25] brother Bram writes in the church age
[56:27] book chapter
[56:28] 3 says for here was one who lived by it
[56:31] is
[56:32] written and that Masterpiece of God
[56:35] overcame by reflecting God's
[56:38] word are we not also the Masterpiece
[56:41] again amen and we overcome by reflecting
[56:44] God's word he says then was this
[56:46] manifested perfect one given to the
[56:49] Cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the
[56:52] perfect
[56:53] sacrifice and on the tree he received
[56:57] the wounds unto death that we by him and
[57:01] because of him might eat of the tree of
[57:04] life and then that life freely given
[57:07] would enable us to overcome and express
[57:10] the word of God and now to these sons of
[57:12] God who by him overcome are given the
[57:14] privilege of the paradise of God and the
[57:17] constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ
[57:20] that's what this church ought to
[57:21] represent Sons and Daughters of God who
[57:24] have eaten of the tree of life it's
[57:25] freely been given and it's enabled us to
[57:28] overcome and now
[57:30] reflect the God's word partaking of this
[57:33] tree of life and that we then now being
[57:36] given the privilege of the paradise of
[57:38] God we then want others to come as
[57:40] Abraham planted a tree that others could
[57:43] come to know the Everlasting God that is
[57:46] our vision that is our mission it's part
[57:48] of our Christian experience that this is
[57:50] not just for me alone but this blessed
[57:53] peace that I have I'm a partaker of this
[57:56] Paradise of God oh that others would
[57:58] come to know him as I have known
[58:02] him I went through and was just reading
[58:04] I've been studying so much in this
[58:06] subject matter it astounded me that in
[58:10] every single service that brother
[58:12] brandham preached on the Seven Seals All
[58:15] Seven Seals he's saying I love
[58:19] him and purchase my
[58:21] salvation on calvary's
[58:24] tree every single service
[58:26] I love him for he purchased my salvation
[58:30] he first loved me and purchased my
[58:33] salvation on calvary's tree calvary's
[58:36] tree on calvary's
[58:40] tree that we might partake of the tree
[58:42] of life and we're given the
[58:46] privilege of the paradise of
[58:51] God can invite the musicians to come
[58:59] in the message Christ is the mystery of
[59:01] God
[59:06] revealed there is
[59:09] uh I I I I this just kind of a side
[59:12] comment you know when anybody ever ask
[59:14] you says you need to read a word to the
[59:16] church church you know something's going
[59:17] on
[59:18] right but I'm not going to read the word
[59:20] of the church just after he gives that
[59:23] word to the church we here you bind
[59:24] closer together and the things that he
[59:26] expresses in that but I want to read
[59:28] where he begins to pray before he
[59:30] preaches Christ as the mystery of God
[59:31] revealed I'm closing with this I don't
[59:33] have the slides I just want you to
[59:35] ponder this it's prayerful so if you
[59:36] could just open your hearts to hear what
[59:39] he has to say he says Lord Jesus
[59:40] speaking to this body of church the
[59:43] church that they should hold together
[59:45] with God's unchanging hand their
[59:47] absolute the word warning them as Paul
[59:50] warned his flock that there would be
[59:52] wolves entered in he's praying now
[59:55] you're the same God God today as you
[59:56] were then and the enemies the same may
[59:59] this fellowship and bonds of love always
[1:00:02] exist amongst the people these people in
[1:00:04] Christ Jesus help this morning Lord as
[1:00:06] we read the word May the Holy Spirit
[1:00:09] reveal it to us that the church might be
[1:00:10] fully established in the faith that was
[1:00:12] once delivered to the Saints to hold
[1:00:15] them and may as you gave the vision some
[1:00:18] two years ago to store up food fine
[1:00:21] healthy looking vegetables that I saw in
[1:00:22] the vision being stored up here in this
[1:00:24] Tabernacle may we today receive a whole
[1:00:26] bar barrel full of that that beautiful
[1:00:30] what an image of even what brother bam
[1:00:31] was doing storing up these things on T

[1:00:34] having a vision there'd be future
[1:00:36] Generations we're here feeding on
[1:00:39] this benefiting from this he says or a
[1:00:41] tap
[1:00:43] load that it might reveal Jesus Christ
[1:00:46] to us in the hour that we
[1:00:49] live he wasn't just planting it for
[1:00:53] 63 it was for 2022 amen that it might
[1:00:57] reveal Jesus Christ to us in the hour
