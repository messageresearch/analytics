[0:00] of the year
[0:03] psalms 143 verse 4 if we've missed
[0:05] anybody visiting just we want to welcome
[0:07] you and god bless you we're so glad that
[0:08] you're
[0:09] with us this evening psalms 143
[0:12] verse 4 it says therefore is my spirit
[0:16] overwhelmed
[0:17] within me my heart within me
[0:20] is desolate what a uh for what a
[0:24] dark scripture we could say in a way or
[0:26] foreboding and heavy
[0:28] therefore is my spirit overwhelmed
[0:30] within me
[0:32] my heart within me is desolate
[0:35] amen you may be seated
[0:40] i'm speaking continue on the subject of
[0:42] pure joy but i'm taking
[0:43] the um the title of numb this evening
[0:47] and i want to take just a few moments
[0:48] here at the outset and talking about
[0:50] being numb
[0:51] just so that you can know where i'm
[0:52] going as we just read in here in psalms
[0:55] 143 verse 4
[0:57] when he says my spirit is overwhelmed
[0:59] within me i think we can all kind of
[1:00] relate to that
[1:02] uh and my heart is within me is desolate
[1:05] um i was reading different translations
[1:07] of this and pondering the meaning of
[1:08] this scripture and one of them said my
[1:10] heart my spirit
[1:11] is wrapped in darkness and my heart
[1:14] grows numb
[1:15] within me my spirit is enshrouded it's
[1:18] covered up it's
[1:19] maybe even confusing even maybe aloof to
[1:22] me or i'm unable to even figure it out
[1:24] or it's distant from me my spirit is
[1:26] wrapped in darkness and my heart
[1:28] grows numb within me i
[1:31] am tonight by god's grace addressing the
[1:33] condition of being emotionally numb
[1:36] or spiritually numb and it's a condition
[1:39] where we are
[1:40] unaffected or maybe unmoved we could use
[1:43] the term maybe stoic or even
[1:45] unresponsive to certain stimulus
[1:47] and i would like to address it even in
[1:50] our emotional
[1:51] condition as human beings but then also
[1:54] our spiritual condition as believers and
[1:56] there's just a parallel there
[1:57] that i think it could speak to you and
[1:59] challenge you
[2:00] and i'm just making these statements at
[2:02] the outset i feel very very directed
[2:04] even very very heavy
[2:06] and i trust that you could um just help
[2:08] me and encourage me this evening as we
[2:09] minister
[2:11] i understand that in speaking along this
[2:13] it may not apply to many who are here
[2:16] uh but it may apply many ways among many
[2:19] different people
[2:20] and so if you yourself can't relate uh
[2:22] to certain feelings or certain
[2:24] circumstances or situations
[2:25] uh perhaps there's a way that you can
[2:27] enter into it in such a way
[2:28] to be sympathetic for somebody else or
[2:30] begin to even understand somebody else
[2:33] they say i was fellowshipping with
[2:35] brother bill ivy and we were talking
[2:36] about something and
[2:38] how that you know many people can't
[2:39] relate to certain people and situations
[2:41] he said i use this example all the time
[2:43] we say well oh we think we can
[2:44] understand this person we can understand
[2:46] that person or we read
[2:47] the bible we listen to brother branham
[2:48] and we say well we understand the
[2:50] prophet but none of us are prophets
[2:52] so it's very hard for us to say that we
[2:54] can fully empathize or
[2:56] understand one's thought process and
[2:58] what they're going through so i realize
[3:00] for some it may even seem to be a
[3:02] foreign subject to you but i hope that
[3:03] we can still all participate
[3:05] as family in this and again just trying
[3:09] to find some words to say at the outset
[3:11] so you can understand where we're
[3:13] the direction that we're wanting to go
[3:14] with this and we can become numb to
[3:17] certain
[3:18] uh causes of emotional pain so there's
[3:21] things that may cause us pain
[3:22] and through life we may experience them
[3:25] with such frequency or at certain times
[3:27] to where
[3:27] we uh we become numb to that stimulus we
[3:30] become numb to that thing that was
[3:32] was hurting us or causing us problems
[3:34] and this could be in the natural and in
[3:36] the spiritual
[3:37] where there's ways that we could be
[3:39] treated or things that we could go
[3:40] through things that we can experience
[3:41] that relate to our spiritual condition
[3:43] and maybe we feel this prick or we feel
[3:45] something or even we're mistreated
[3:47] and after a while we just kind of put
[3:48] our defenses up and we're able to guard
[3:50] against it and we're no longer affected
[3:51] by it
[3:52] we kind of get over it or we move on and
[3:55] this could be through a series of events
[3:57] or even just some a single interaction
[3:59] or instance that leaves deep marks
[4:00] within our emotions
[4:02] and in that process we become calloused
[4:04] or closed off
[4:05] or numb as i'm putting it and so these
[4:08] things can lead us to shut down or to
[4:11] become detached or removed from certain
[4:14] things and over time
[4:15] even that can begin to develop a little
[4:16] bit of a callous causing us as i'm
[4:18] pointing out
[4:18] to become numb to things does that make
[4:20] sense to some of you
[4:22] just even as we we prefaced this in the
[4:23] beginning with these statements
[4:25] and it is a it's a difficult subject to
[4:28] approach so i ask that you would
[4:29] uh please each one of you just be very
[4:31] focused as we speak on this
[4:34] as we poured ourselves in the message of
[4:36] the hour we looked
[4:37] we found these things in the scripture
[4:39] and we feel very directed and
[4:42] certain things that we speak about may
[4:43] seem to be very laser focused or even
[4:45] very specific they may
[4:47] hear it and say wow that seems to be
[4:48] very specific to a particular situation
[4:51] and we might need to be careful as to
[4:53] how broadly we would want to apply that
[4:55] because there's some things that
[4:56] apply to a very specific situation we
[4:58] don't necessarily just take that as a
[5:00] template and try to apply it to every
[5:01] situation
[5:02] and i'm just trusting that god could
[5:03] take the word tonight and place it
[5:05] within your heart where it needs to be
[5:07] and help you to do that so as we've been
[5:10] speaking on the subject of pure joy
[5:12] our identifying how that in nehemiah it
[5:14] says the joy of the lord is your
[5:16] strength
[5:17] and so there is a joy which is a
[5:18] strength there is a joy that is from
[5:21] above and it's not just an emotional
[5:22] happiness
[5:24] there is a hedonic happiness or hedonism
[5:27] or just something that's just uh
[5:29] visceral or in the flesh or something
[5:30] part of our emotions
[5:32] where we just experience temporal
[5:33] pleasure that's not the joy that i'm
[5:35] talking about not talking about the
[5:37] thrill of the flesh or kind of the
[5:38] excitement that we get when we ride a
[5:39] roller coaster
[5:40] or we do something that gets our
[5:42] adrenaline going it's kind of an
[5:43] adrenaline rush
[5:44] we're not talking about that kind of
[5:45] happiness we're talking about a joy
[5:47] which is found in fulfilling your
[5:49] purpose
[5:50] some of the joy that's connected with a
[5:51] life full of meaning to be joyful
[5:53] we to be living a life that is full of
[5:55] meaning and so we're talking about a
[5:57] life
[5:58] lived well a life that is flourishing
[6:00] that is thriving those may be some of
[6:02] the terms that we've used
[6:03] as of late and so a life that is
[6:06] uh that has purpose and meaning versus a
[6:09] life that is just
[6:10] one that is pursuing fleshly pleasure
[6:12] wow or just wanting to be happy just
[6:14] want to experience
[6:15] excitement and i i want to have this and
[6:16] i want to have that that's not the
[6:18] joy we're talking about the happiness
[6:20] we're talking about we're talking about
[6:21] something that is real and something
[6:22] that is deep
[6:24] even in the scripture joy is associated
[6:26] with shalom or peace and joy
[6:28] speaks of meaning to live well or to
[6:30] thrive that's the joy that we're talking
[6:31] about
[6:32] a life lived well in john chapter 15
[6:35] verses 10 to 11. we used a different
[6:38] side of this last time to make this
[6:40] point and i want to use these scriptures
[6:42] this time
[6:42] it says if you keep my commandments you
[6:44] shall abide in my love
[6:46] even as i had kept my father's
[6:47] commandment and abide in his love
[6:49] these things have i spoken unto you that
[6:52] my joy
[6:53] my joy might remain in you so he has
[6:55] spoken the word of god so that through
[6:58] the dynamic of the word being imparted
[7:00] they could receive his joy and his joy
[7:03] to remain in him
[7:04] and then he says and that your joy might
[7:06] be full
[7:08] so complete joy is found in the word of
[7:10] god complete joy is found in
[7:12] fulfilling your purpose and doing what
[7:14] you're called to do
[7:15] so in that when we talk about pure joy
[7:18] or having joy
[7:19] we're not making happiness our goal he
[7:22] said
[7:23] well what do you want to do in life i
[7:24] just want to be happy you don't you
[7:25] don't make happiness your goal
[7:26] we're not pursuing happiness we're not
[7:28] even pursuing joy but we're pursuing a
[7:30] meaningful goal
[7:32] in achie and in achieving those goals it
[7:34] brings us
[7:35] it brings a joy you don't pursue
[7:37] happiness as an end you don't pursue joy
[7:39] as an end
[7:39] but you pursue the will of god and you
[7:41] seek his word and the outcome of seeking
[7:43] his word
[7:44] the byproduct of fulfilling a purpose is
[7:47] the joy that you get in doing it
[7:49] in matthew chapter 2 verse 10
[7:52] it says when they saw the star speaking
[7:54] of these sages and
[7:56] we call them the wise men who came
[7:58] following the star
[8:00] uh to find the child uh their uh
[8:03] jesus christ when he was a child when
[8:04] they saw the star so now that they'd
[8:06] come into jerusalem
[8:08] and the star has disappeared for them
[8:09] but as they come back out
[8:11] and they're seeking the star they need
[8:13] direction they need guidance it says
[8:14] when they saw the star
[8:15] they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
[8:18] and why was their joy why was a joy
[8:21] connected in seeing a star
[8:22] there was a purpose behind the star
[8:24] there was a purpose in their journey
[8:26] they were
[8:26] wanting to be led we know to the messiah
[8:29] they believed that they were following
[8:30] prophecy and the stars signified
[8:32] something
[8:33] so the joy the stars signified uh
[8:36] leading them to the fulfillment of this
[8:38] prophecy and when they saw the star
[8:40] it brought them exceeding great joy why
[8:42] they were seeking and following the word
[8:45] it's not the sign that gave them joy it
[8:46] wasn't just the sign in the sky
[8:48] they gave them joy but it was the
[8:49] overall purpose and the objective of
[8:51] what they were pursuing
[8:52] that gave them this exceeding great joy
[8:54] to know we're going a step further in
[8:56] god's purpose
[8:57] we know that the bible speaks to the
[9:00] fruit of the spirit and how it's joy and
[9:01] peace and it speaks to these different
[9:03] different attributes and characteristics
[9:05] of the fruit of the spirit
[9:08] and joy being a fruit of the spirit it
[9:10] is a product
[9:11] or result of the spirit taking root
[9:14] so it's not the aim it's a product joy
[9:17] is a product joy is the product of the
[9:18] spirit taking root
[9:20] it's a product of the holy spirit
[9:21] abiding in our hearts and us growing and
[9:23] what do we do we sprout
[9:24] this fruit or this characteristic of joy
[9:28] now we're i want to just take a moment
[9:31] to kind of
[9:31] divide this a little bit further how
[9:33] we're contrasting we talk about pure joy
[9:35] i even use that phrase pure joy
[9:37] that we might in our hearts begin to
[9:39] think about a joy that's connected with
[9:40] the pure word of god
[9:42] and and it's something that's pure and
[9:44] it's clean and it's it's righteous
[9:46] we want to contrast that from human
[9:48] happiness
[9:49] and human happiness it's just this
[9:50] cognitive state of mind a cognitive
[9:52] comfort
[9:53] in our minds we feel good we feel at
[9:55] ease but that could be manufactured
[9:57] through
[9:57] thought or through experience
[10:00] and that's where the human mind is a
[10:02] very robust
[10:04] uh machine and a very healthy machine in
[10:07] many different aspects
[10:08] and a social psychologist places it this
[10:12] way
[10:12] he says natural happiness is what we get
[10:15] when we get what we wanted
[10:17] so if you want something and you get it
[10:19] you can have a natural happiness
[10:21] he says synthetic happiness is what we
[10:23] make when we don't get what we wanted
[10:26] this is really in a sense let's just
[10:28] take our take a step outside the realm
[10:30] of god's perfect will
[10:32] this really works out well for humans
[10:35] that you experience
[10:35] natural happiness when you get what you
[10:37] want but you create
[10:39] synthetic happiness when you don't get
[10:41] what you want
[10:43] now that being true about all human
[10:45] beings what we're not trying to pursue
[10:47] is happiness
[10:49] because you're going to be happy if you
[10:50] get what you want and you have the
[10:51] ability of tricking yourself into being
[10:54] happy
[10:54] when you don't get what you want and
[10:57] there's a lot more that i'd like to
[10:58] share in that vein
[10:59] but let me just say it this way our
[11:01] minds can create happiness
[11:03] despite an unfavorable outcome or even
[11:05] despite
[11:06] great disappointments the mind has the
[11:08] ability to process what's happening
[11:11] and say everything's great isn't that
[11:12] wonderful i'm happy
[11:15] despite missing out on that promotion
[11:17] that would have given you a billion
[11:18] dollar bonus despite
[11:20] being uh not being chosen as the drummer
[11:22] of the beatles despite
[11:23] getting in an accident and causing you
[11:25] to be a paraplegic despite being having
[11:27] an opportunity at a mcdonald's franchise
[11:29] and say no i don't think it's going to
[11:30] go anywhere
[11:31] people later on just say hey it worked
[11:32] out for the best i'm happy everything's
[11:34] good
[11:34] i don't for there's not one part of me
[11:36] that wishes anything would have been
[11:37] different
[11:37] a person can manufacture happiness
[11:40] regardless of the
[11:41] uh the ingredients that are being
[11:42] presented to them
[11:44] and so it's an unconscious they call it
[11:46] an unconscious cognitive
[11:48] process an unconscious a process of
[11:50] thinking way of thinking
[11:52] that helps us see the world differently
[11:54] so that we can feel better about our
[11:55] lives
[11:57] now i hope i'm getting your attention
[12:01] because if we can do that as human
[12:03] beings then you know whatever that is
[12:05] isn't what god wants you to have if
[12:07] that's something that we can do as
[12:09] humans is take a difficult situation and
[12:10] put a spin on it
[12:11] see it differently and achieve a
[12:13] synthetic happiness that is not what god
[12:15] wants us to have when we look at a
[12:17] situation
[12:18] to use carnal mechanisms to process
[12:20] things and have a synthetic happiness
[12:22] or even just get a natural happiness
[12:24] from getting the things we want
[12:25] or process synthetic happiness by uh
[12:28] reevaluating things and creating
[12:30] something when we don't get what we want
[12:32] god wants us to have pure joy and it's
[12:35] remarkable we've all we've all
[12:37] experienced this either individually
[12:39] personally we've experienced this or
[12:41] we've seen others who do this and we can
[12:43] as humans we can experience the feelings
[12:45] of
[12:46] liberty and happiness and excitement and
[12:49] and relief and joy and enthusiasm
[12:52] in rejecting the word of god in doing
[12:55] and committing a sin and doing something
[12:57] we know we shouldn't do
[12:58] you look at people and it's like well
[12:59] how could you enjoy that man this is fun
[13:01] this is great i'm enjoying this well
[13:02] leave me alone i'm happy how many have
[13:04] heard that before somebody's in sin
[13:07] doing something they shouldn't do and
[13:08] they say leave me alone i'm happy and we
[13:10] we could say oh you're not really happy
[13:12] well they don't even know what we're
[13:13] talking about to them they're happy but
[13:16] if you've experienced a joy that is far
[13:18] different than what they're experiencing
[13:20] it's easy for us to say well
[13:22] you're really not happy because we know
[13:23] another level of happy
[13:25] but they're either getting what they
[13:26] want or they're synthesizing happiness
[13:29] through all their difficulties and their
[13:31] struggles and their trials because
[13:32] that's how
[13:33] the mind can work in jeremiah chapter 12
[13:36] verse 1 the scriptures tell us this
[13:37] righteous art thou
[13:38] lord when i plead with thee yet let me
[13:41] talk with thee of thy judgments
[13:42] and then there's a question this person
[13:44] the prophet wants to ask
[13:45] wherefore doth the way of the wicked
[13:47] prosper david asked the question many
[13:49] times
[13:49] why do the wicked prosper wherefore are
[13:52] all they happy that deal very
[13:55] treacherously
[13:57] why is it it seems that the wicked
[13:59] farewell and they enjoy
[14:00] things and they have a lot of things to
[14:02] make them happy why are they that deal
[14:04] treacherously that do
[14:05] wrong why are they happy
[14:09] so let's ponder this and know that the
[14:10] scriptures identified that even the
[14:12] wicked the unrighteous the unruly
[14:14] those that would pervert the word of god
[14:16] those that would live in sin have the
[14:18] ability to be happy
[14:19] and to express sentiments of joy and
[14:23] happiness and all these different things
[14:25] but yet they're dealing treacherously or
[14:27] they're living wickedly
[14:29] so i say don't be fooled by synthetic
[14:32] happiness
[14:33] don't use what one human the human
[14:36] ability to be happy
[14:37] as some sort of marker that you found
[14:39] the right stride you're doing the right
[14:41] thing you're in the will of god
[14:42] we can't be fooled by the mental biases
[14:44] that we hold within our minds
[14:46] or the even the mechanism of cognitive
[14:48] dissonance which will convince you know
[14:49] you made the right decision despite this
[14:51] feeling of i don't know if i did
[14:56] the bible says in first timothy 5 6 but
[14:58] she that liveth in pleasure
[14:59] is dead while she liveth we often focus
[15:02] on the fact that she's dead while she
[15:04] liveth but that's just an assessment and
[15:05] a judgment
[15:06] that the word gives and a discernment
[15:08] that we can have about someone living in
[15:10] sin
[15:11] but the person who's living in sin is
[15:12] living in pleasure
[15:15] they can enjoy sin they can enjoy it for
[15:17] a season they can experience
[15:19] great happiness and great liberty and
[15:22] feel very fulfilled while living in sin
[15:24] and express those sentiments that i feel
[15:26] great i feel wonderful i feel happy
[15:28] but yet we can know or an individual can
[15:30] know by the word of god
[15:32] that they are living in sin and
[15:34] therefore they're dead
[15:35] even though they're saying they're happy
[15:37] so we can't be fooled by human emotion
[15:39] and synthetic happiness
[15:41] when i'm talking about pure joy i'm not
[15:42] just trying to figure out a way so we
[15:44] can just get thrilled throughout the
[15:45] days
[15:46] and get a little rush of happiness
[15:48] somehow i'm talking about the difference
[15:50] between
[15:50] pure joy and even human joy or human
[15:53] happiness which can be manufactured by
[15:55] humans
[15:56] a joy that comes for the lord and
[15:57] another one which is synthetic you can
[15:59] make it
[15:59] i'm not talking about synthetic
[16:01] happiness i want to make three quick
[16:03] points about pure joy
[16:04] they're here on a slide for you just so
[16:06] you can kind of catch these uh very
[16:08] quickly when we go through these
[16:10] but pure joy it's personal
[16:14] it's rooted in truth and pure joy is not
[16:17] the absence of sorrow or pain
[16:18] or or or sadness
[16:22] pure joy is not well everything's going
[16:24] great therefore i'm happy
[16:26] so joy is personal and the scripture
[16:29] jesus says
[16:30] i've spoken these things that your joy
[16:32] might be full john 16 he tells the
[16:34] disciples
[16:34] and your joy no man taketh from you so
[16:37] this is how joy is personal
[16:38] he says that your joy we read it already
[16:40] your your joy might be full
[16:42] so not only is it that his joy would
[16:44] remain in you but then your joy by
[16:46] experiencing his joy
[16:48] your joy this is personal your joy may
[16:50] be full or complete that your joy no man
[16:53] take it from you
[16:54] even paul wrote that he wants to be a
[16:55] helper of your joy
[16:58] so joy is something personal when we
[17:00] talk about pure joy i'm talking about
[17:01] your hap your joy
[17:02] your happiness in the lord your
[17:04] contentment we can rejoice when others
[17:06] are joyful and i think that kind of
[17:08] gentleness and that kind of nature is
[17:09] wonderful
[17:10] but your joy can only be found in doing
[17:12] his will for your life
[17:14] so it's personal i can see somebody else
[17:16] being blessed and i ought to derive a
[17:18] pleasure from that and
[17:19] and i should be able to rejoice in that
[17:20] but many times we're unable to rejoice
[17:23] in
[17:23] others joy not because uh we're not
[17:26] genuinely happy for them
[17:27] but we haven't experienced our own joy
[17:30] and it makes it harder for us to rejoice
[17:32] so your joy can only be found in doing
[17:34] his will and it's personal
[17:36] then pure joy is related to truth it's
[17:39] rooted and grounded in truth
[17:41] and i want you to ponder this and it
[17:43] it's going to mean something i believe
[17:44] later but i just didn't feel directed
[17:46] kind of
[17:47] to amplify this and bring it out of the
[17:48] word of the lord but the opposite of joy
[17:51] if joy is rooted in truth
[17:54] the opposite of joy is not sadness but
[17:57] the opposite of joy is found in unbelief
[17:59] and sin
[18:01] it's very important to catch this and i
[18:02] see this in the in the word of god how
[18:05] the opposite of joy
[18:06] is not to be sad but the opposite of joy
[18:09] is unbelief in sin
[18:10] so pure joy is personal it's rooted in
[18:12] truth and it is not the absence of pain
[18:16] it is not the absence of sadness it is
[18:18] not the absence
[18:19] of sorrow or grief
[18:23] it's not the absence of suffering often
[18:26] times
[18:27] there's things that are very difficult
[18:29] but they produce the greatest joys
[18:31] as we read in the scripture last time in
[18:33] john 16 verse 21 that the woman
[18:35] when she is in travail and she's giving
[18:37] birth she has sorrow
[18:39] because as that hour is coming and she's
[18:41] in great tribulation and great
[18:43] difficulty great labor pains
[18:44] but as soon as that child is delivered
[18:46] she doesn't remember the anguish for the
[18:48] joy that the man has brought into the
[18:50] world
[18:51] she wouldn't experience that joy had she
[18:53] not experienced the pain of delivery
[18:56] and so the joy is not that she had the
[18:58] absence of pain and no pain
[19:00] but it's something that followed and we
[19:03] may even
[19:04] we may fear pain there's different ones
[19:07] who have
[19:08] high pain tolerance there's some that in
[19:09] some ways not do they not only do they
[19:11] have a high pain tolerance it seems like
[19:12] they have an appetite for it
[19:15] i never really got the concept between
[19:16] behind a haunted house
[19:19] i mean i just don't have that gene like
[19:20] okay yeah i want to go through this and
[19:22] get scared to death
[19:23] no uh uh nope
[19:26] that's just not in me and then there's
[19:27] things where i say hey grab this pull
[19:29] this it's gonna shock you i'm like nope
[19:31] can't do it can't bring myself to do it
[19:33] oh it's not gonna hurt watch your little
[19:34] six-year-old will do it
[19:36] it's like you do it i'm like no i don't
[19:37] want to i don't want to feel pain
[19:41] i don't have that someone taste
[19:43] something oh this is nasty try it i'm
[19:44] like no
[19:46] i trust you 100 confidence right now i
[19:49] believe you i don't doubt you at all
[19:52] and so we may fear pain and i know that
[19:54] we all fear discomfort
[19:57] but pain and discomfort are an important
[19:58] part of learning healthy behavior
[20:02] pain and discomfort are part of learning
[20:03] correct behavior you have to experience
[20:06] pain and experience discomfort to learn
[20:08] and to grow
[20:09] the bible says in eve in hebrews chapter
[20:11] 12 verse 11
[20:12] no now no chastening for the present
[20:15] seemeth to be joyous amen
[20:17] correction and chastening seems to be
[20:19] happier joyce but it's actually grievous
[20:21] it's burdensome
[20:22] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[20:24] peaceable fruit of righteousness
[20:26] unto them which are exercised thereby so
[20:28] if you're exercised by correction
[20:30] it produces a joy it produces a relief
[20:33] it produces the
[20:34] peaceable fruit of righteousness but
[20:35] that only comes through
[20:37] the chastening or the rebuking
[20:40] and so we see that there's a connection
[20:42] between our joy some
[20:44] many times and the things that we've
[20:45] endured and it provides the contrast
[20:48] and then i will take a step further and
[20:50] express this
[20:51] that there's times when we are we have
[20:53] we know that within our hearts
[20:54] we have a pure joy but yet we are
[20:56] sorrowing
[20:58] yet we are grieving yet we are hurt and
[21:00] so pure joy
[21:02] is not the absence of any emotion or
[21:04] sentiment contrary
[21:05] to the fruits of the spirit or any
[21:07] sentiment that would be contrary to joy
[21:09] in the lord
[21:10] but the joy of the lord is something
[21:11] that is independent of those
[21:19] it thunders when i preach now isn't that
[21:21] neat
[21:24] please be seated
[21:31] now we the first service we took on this
[21:35] subject to pure joy we used this
[21:37] the title invert always invert
[21:40] and in looking at this invert always
[21:44] invert
[21:47] what we what we were looking at in that
[21:49] was how that certain objectives can be
[21:52] attained to your goals can be achieved
[21:54] by approaching
[21:56] how you're going to get there backwards
[21:58] or as you can say well we need to do
[22:00] this i i want to make a million dollars
[22:02] well not how is it going to how am i
[22:05] going to make it but what would keep me
[22:07] from making it
[22:09] a lot of times we think well how can i
[22:10] get rich how can i get rich you ought to
[22:12] be asking yourself what's making you
[22:13] poor
[22:14] right and so that's not it's it's kind
[22:17] of inverting it's looking at it
[22:19] backwards it's saying
[22:20] if i want to achieve something what's
[22:22] going to keep me from achieving it
[22:24] so let me put it in the context again of
[22:25] pure joy
[22:27] if we can say my joy is found in
[22:29] fulfilling the lord's will in my life
[22:32] that that it's not the goal it's a
[22:34] byproduct
[22:35] of living a purposeful life and a
[22:37] meaningful life my life my joy is found
[22:40] in fulfilling the lord's will in my life
[22:42] so then if you're going to invert that
[22:44] instead of asking yourself well what's
[22:46] going to bring me joy
[22:48] well joy is going to be found in doing
[22:49] the lord's will and it says
[22:51] well what's god's will what's god's will
[22:52] we can ask ourselves what is keeping me
[22:54] what's going to keep me from fully
[22:56] following
[22:56] in the lord's leadership in my life this
[22:59] is how we invert because sometimes
[23:01] what's god's will what's god's will what
[23:02] what is god's will we can ask
[23:04] what's keeping me from god's will even
[23:07] if i don't know what he wants me to do
[23:08] tomorrow i may be able to sit down and
[23:10] figure out all the things that i know he
[23:12] doesn't want me to do
[23:13] or the things that may hinder me from
[23:15] doing what he wants me to do when i know
[23:17] what he wants me to do
[23:18] in other words put myself in the
[23:20] position to act when he tells me what to
[23:22] do
[23:23] instead of just kind of languishing the
[23:24] language of well i don't know which way
[23:26] he wants me to go and i don't know what
[23:27] to do
[23:29] and you kind of become real stagnant and
[23:31] stale and you and you're not
[23:33] you're not ready so that when you call
[23:34] you're like oh oh you want me to do
[23:36] something well
[23:36] i got to get ready i got to do this i
[23:38] got to do that i got to do this i got to
[23:39] do that
[23:40] though this is something we begin to ask
[23:41] ourselves i'm going to invert
[23:43] if i know that joy comes from fully
[23:45] following the lord
[23:46] then i can ask myself what keeps me from
[23:49] fully following the lord
[23:53] now this is where i want to come to the
[23:55] subject of numb
[23:57] in galatians chapter 6 verse 9 it says
[24:01] and let us not be
[24:02] weary in well-doing for in due season we
[24:06] shall reap
[24:07] we should the very fact that paul has to
[24:11] express
[24:12] that we not be weary in well-doing ought
[24:14] to be a signal to us
[24:17] that we can become weary even in doing
[24:19] well
[24:21] that even when you're doing things right
[24:23] there can be a weariness to it so the
[24:24] word of god kind of comes against that
[24:26] and hits this thing that may be in our
[24:28] hearts that even when we know we're
[24:29] doing what's right
[24:30] and just this war of attrition we're
[24:32] doing it over and over again we're doing
[24:33] what we know is right that there can be
[24:35] such a warfare and such a struggle in
[24:36] doing it
[24:37] he says don't be weary and while doing
[24:38] because you keep doing it you keep doing
[24:40] it you keep doing it and maybe you don't
[24:41] see results he says don't worry if
[24:43] you're doing right good's gonna come
[24:45] eventually
[24:46] you're going to reap eventually and he
[24:47] says if we faint not
[24:50] and so he has now taken this thought of
[24:53] being weary
[24:54] and how weariness can increase and he
[24:56] says don't be weary because if you stay
[24:58] to it
[24:58] then eventually you're going to reap but
[25:00] he says but the reaping is only going to
[25:02] come if you don't faint
[25:04] and the fainting it means to grow weak
[25:06] or to lose strength is to tire out
[25:10] it means even to become despondent so
[25:12] this is how the scripture
[25:13] is putting this together how that in
[25:15] doing things we can grow weary but now
[25:17] the weariness can lead to a feeling of
[25:20] discouragement
[25:21] and the weariness can lead to a feeling
[25:22] of hopelessness and this hopelessness
[25:24] then leads to a loss of courage and it
[25:26] causes you to quit
[25:28] you're doing well but in doing well
[25:30] there's certain circumstances that cause
[25:33] you to kind of wear down
[25:34] and then wearing down you lose sight of
[25:36] the goal and the fact that there's going
[25:38] to be a reaping one day
[25:39] and then you kind of give out you become
[25:41] despondent you tire out you lose your
[25:43] strength
[25:44] and you come to a place where you just
[25:45] quit
[25:47] let us not be weary and in in well doing
[25:50] keeping our eyes on the goal because if
[25:52] you lose sight of the heart the harvest
[25:54] then it's easy not for you the weariness
[25:56] to bow you down to the point where you
[25:57] just
[25:58] give up hebrews chapter 12 verse 3 it
[26:01] says for consider him we're looking to
[26:03] christ now
[26:04] the author and finisher of our faith and
[26:06] he himself who for the joy which was set
[26:07] before him
[26:08] says consider him that endured such
[26:10] contradiction of sinners against himself
[26:13] he was buffeted he was rebuked and he
[26:15] was reviled and he was misunderstood
[26:18] he says we ought to consider his example
[26:20] lest
[26:21] ye be wearied and faint in your minds
[26:26] again the scripture is actually
[26:27] cautioning us and i think it would be
[26:29] important for us to take a step back and
[26:30] ask ourselves
[26:31] was paul writing to the weak-minded
[26:33] make-believer
[26:37] or was he writing to the believer he's
[26:40] writing to the christian
[26:41] he's writing to those that would say i
[26:43] believe i've had a born-again experience
[26:45] in other words i believe i have the holy
[26:46] ghost and the word of god is encouraging
[26:49] them and admonishing them and wanting to
[26:50] strengthen them
[26:51] and not saying oh you're getting tired
[26:53] well you just need to get the holy ghost
[26:56] it speaks to you in such a way to
[26:58] acknowledge that yes born-again
[26:59] christians
[27:00] could fight and war and have things
[27:03] happen to them that wear them down
[27:05] the bible saying don't give up daughter
[27:07] don't give up brother
[27:08] keep pressing keep fighting it's worth
[27:10] it in the end
[27:11] we're going to god's going to do
[27:12] something great through you there's
[27:14] greater things coming
[27:15] stick with it persevere don't let go
[27:20] it gives us the example of christ and we
[27:21] say well look what he went through so we
[27:23] have to use these examples that would
[27:25] encourage us he says
[27:26] look to christ as a source of
[27:28] encouragement lest you get weary
[27:31] and faint it's saying that there's a
[27:35] mental weariness that leads you to
[27:37] giving up look to christ consider him
[27:41] understand what he went through lest you
[27:43] allow a mental awareness to bring into a
[27:45] state of i don't want to do this anymore
[27:47] i give up i can't do this
[27:53] as i mentioned a moment ago about
[27:54] synthetic happiness
[27:56] there's certain mechanisms that are
[27:58] associated with it i would actually want
[27:59] to put these in a separate category
[28:01] but it's the same type of ability within
[28:03] our minds but we have human
[28:05] humans have mental defenses
[28:08] and we use these to survive feelings of
[28:11] hopelessness
[28:13] we use these mental defenses to to help
[28:16] us survive
[28:17] the uncomfortable feelings and without
[28:20] these defenses
[28:22] uh the things that we experience could
[28:24] have a greater impact upon us or even
[28:26] more damage in effect so it's actually
[28:28] maybe in a sense
[28:28] a healthy part of our thought process
[28:30] that tries to protect us
[28:33] and one of these mechanisms i want to
[28:35] say is numbness
[28:37] we don't like feeling uncomfortable we
[28:39] may like a a haunted house so we might
[28:41] like to do something that gives us a
[28:43] thrill or the
[28:44] a a sense of an adrenaline rush but we
[28:46] wouldn't want to
[28:47] live that way necessarily so we use
[28:50] psychological mechanisms to protect our
[28:52] feelings
[28:53] this is this is something the mind does
[28:55] a human does all humans this isn't
[28:57] what a christian ought to do but this is
[28:59] just what humans do
[29:00] and so we can we have these abilities to
[29:03] repress certain emotions
[29:05] and repress certain feelings and certain
[29:07] thoughts processes as coping mechanisms
[29:10] in order to achieve a sense of cognitive
[29:13] comfort
[29:14] in order to be at peace in order to not
[29:16] to wrestle with this and
[29:17] be overwhelmed with that we have these
[29:19] ways of kind of tune that out
[29:20] cut that off get distance from that and
[29:22] leave it out
[29:24] and what i'm talking about is being numb
[29:28] and to be numb it means to be deprived
[29:30] of the power of sensation
[29:32] or to be deprived of the power of
[29:34] movement
[29:36] to be not means to be deprived of
[29:38] feeling to be deprived of responsiveness
[29:40] whereas
[29:41] there ought to be a response to that
[29:42] there ought to be a reaction but when
[29:44] you're numb you don't have the same
[29:45] reaction
[29:46] that well you ought to have been like no
[29:48] don't do that or you ought to have
[29:50] responded a certain way but the stimulus
[29:52] doesn't hit you you the even the
[29:53] emotional stimulus
[29:54] doesn't hit that person like well man
[29:56] why didn't they say anything well
[29:58] they're pretty callous or they're just
[29:59] used to that
[30:00] or or somebody may do something and
[30:03] people are like oh
[30:04] oh my goodness and everybody else is
[30:06] like you're new here
[30:08] aren't you they've just become numb to
[30:10] it it doesn't it doesn't move them or
[30:12] stimulate them
[30:13] the same way that it would somebody else
[30:15] and to be numb it means you're powerless
[30:16] to feel
[30:17] powerless to move powerless to act
[30:21] if i could say it this way fight or
[30:22] flight has an unknown triplet
[30:25] right a a a a another another cousin or
[30:28] another relative we say well
[30:30] there's it's wired deeply wired within
[30:32] the mankind
[30:33] this fight or flight and we see that as
[30:35] protection mechanisms and there's
[30:37] one thing caused us to run why did we
[30:39] learn to run as humans well to save
[30:41] ourselves
[30:41] why do we learn to fight to save others
[30:43] there was things mechanisms that were
[30:45] within us
[30:45] that would take place in happiness but
[30:47] there's another part of that there's
[30:48] fight
[30:49] there's flight but then there's even
[30:50] freeze
[30:52] i find this happens over and over again
[30:54] that some people the situation happens
[30:55] and they're there and they're ready to
[30:56] fight another one people run
[30:57] but there's some people ju they freeze
[31:00] up
[31:01] i don't know what happened i just froze
[31:06] it's an emotional paralysis
[31:09] that when something happens all of a
[31:12] sudden something triggers
[31:13] something takes place in their emotions
[31:15] and otherwise healthy
[31:17] able to do these different things able
[31:19] to perform able to take care of this
[31:20] able to take care of that
[31:21] something happens all of a sudden
[31:22] they're completely unable they freeze
[31:25] they lock up in the bible in ephesians
[31:29] chapter 4 verse 19
[31:32] and i hope that you can take this
[31:33] principle out of
[31:37] although paul is talking about those
[31:39] that are committing sin
[31:41] he's talking about a mental state or
[31:43] condition who being past
[31:45] feeling have given themselves over into
[31:47] lasciviousness
[31:48] to work all uncleanness with greediness
[31:52] to be passed feeling it means they cease
[31:53] to feel
[31:56] to be past feeling they become callous
[31:59] where
[32:00] if we were to look at this as some sort
[32:02] of trajectory or process
[32:04] an evolution of sin in someone's life he
[32:06] says their past feeling
[32:07] at one time maybe they did feel but when
[32:09] they first did it and they were able to
[32:10] rationalize then they do it again and
[32:12] they're able to make excuses and then
[32:13] they do it again
[32:14] and that voice that conviction that
[32:16] feeling that guilt gets further and
[32:17] further away to the point to where they
[32:19] become
[32:19] callous and they become numb to the fact
[32:22] that what they're doing is contrary to
[32:24] the word
[32:26] being past feeling means unmoved the
[32:29] word even speaks about being apathetic
[32:33] so who cares what does it matter
[32:36] and as paul says this being past feeling
[32:39] leads to lasciviousness
[32:40] and to work all uncleanness with
[32:42] greediness that's a very
[32:44] terrible state of mind this is the
[32:45] outcome and the product of one working
[32:47] their way past feeling
[32:49] and it manifests itself in this
[32:50] ungodliness these coping mechanisms even
[32:53] in
[32:53] and people who we wouldn't categorize as
[32:55] doing these things some of the downside
[32:57] of these coping mechanisms is it can
[32:59] lead us to making
[33:00] unhealthy choices it can lead to even a
[33:04] pattern of self-destruction and the
[33:06] failure of relationships and the
[33:07] inability of do
[33:08] just doing normal everyday things that
[33:10] we're not to do
[33:13] and so in this repressing uncomfortable
[33:17] emotions
[33:18] in order to get distance from them oh
[33:20] that that that hurts
[33:22] that bothers me i i don't like that
[33:23] that's that that makes me feel
[33:25] uncomfortable so you try to get distance
[33:27] from it
[33:27] it actually can lead to a thought
[33:29] process which is negative and unhealthy
[33:32] now i realize in one sense that this
[33:34] idea we say well fight or flight that
[33:36] these are the things that are within
[33:38] within human beings we realize that in
[33:40] both of those instances there's this
[33:41] negative side which like
[33:43] this is part of man's psychological
[33:45] evolution which isn't good
[33:47] and the the fallout of mankind falling
[33:49] like there's a better way to be rational
[33:51] there's a better way to live there's a
[33:53] better way to address
[33:54] issues there's a better way to avoid
[33:55] harm than just this human instinct to
[33:57] fight or flight we really need the mind
[33:59] of christ
[34:00] to properly navigate these challenges
[34:02] and these difficulties
[34:03] and these difficult things that are
[34:04] coming and so this idea that well i
[34:06] don't want to feel that way who wants to
[34:08] feel that way get distance get distance
[34:10] it can actually cascade and cause
[34:12] unhealthy thinking and unhealthy mind
[34:16] and we're even reading these thoughts
[34:18] that would come up within somebody
[34:20] in psalms 143 verse 4
[34:23] therefore is my spirit overwhelmed
[34:26] within me
[34:27] because of these things my spirit is
[34:29] enshrouded and covered up in darkness
[34:31] my spirit is overwhelmed with any and my
[34:33] heart within me
[34:35] is desolate i'm numb i'm becoming numb
[34:39] i'm experiencing so much difficulty i'm
[34:42] experiencing so much pain
[34:43] so much rejection so much so many
[34:45] comments so much abuse
[34:48] over and over i'm overwhelmed so often
[34:50] with these feelings that i finally get
[34:51] to the point to where now
[34:53] i'm getting numb from the pain
[34:57] and becoming numb is a defense against
[34:59] feeling overwhelmed with certain
[35:00] emotions
[35:02] who wants to feel fear who wants to
[35:05] feel anxiety who wants to wake up every
[35:07] day and and be unable to do this and who
[35:09] wants to be in a situation where you're
[35:10] constantly being bombarded with that
[35:12] and they find a way to actually numb
[35:14] themselves to the hurt to numb
[35:16] themselves to the pain
[35:17] in order to make it through
[35:21] are you staying with me so far i know
[35:24] you're listening very intently and i
[35:25] appreciate that
[35:26] and uh you'll say well brother aaron you
[35:28] told us to be really focused thank you
[35:30] you're doing you're doing tremendous and
[35:32] i realize this is maybe just a little
[35:33] bit of a different service
[35:35] but it is it is nothing
[35:38] short of the the word being a discerner
[35:42] it's exactly what's happening the word
[35:45] is discerning
[35:47] now now just to i want to quickly come
[35:50] you say too late for quickly all right
[35:51] then i want to now at this point
[35:53] come to not all emotions are bad
[36:00] the message teaches us that your
[36:01] emotions are what you are
[36:04] we see time and time again how the word
[36:05] of god and the message of the hour was
[36:06] addressing
[36:07] emotional stimulus and things that were
[36:09] happening to people in their past and
[36:11] feelings that they're experiencing so
[36:12] for us to kind of take this attitude
[36:14] well you just need the holy ghost and as
[36:15] long you've got the holy ghost on the
[36:17] inside then none of these
[36:18] none of these things matter we've
[36:19] somehow ourselves become detached from
[36:21] reality if that's what we're thinking
[36:23] and it's like you become numb
[36:26] and you're you may be the one i'm
[36:28] speaking to we've lost feeling we lose
[36:30] feeling for people if we think
[36:31] oh they just need the holies well they
[36:32] just need this they just said there's
[36:34] got to be a sense of feeling and
[36:35] understanding relating to what someone
[36:37] is going through
[36:38] before we just think we can just slap
[36:39] the band-aid of the message on it and
[36:41] say well this is going to solve your
[36:42] problem that's going to solve your
[36:43] problems no
[36:43] you've got to get down to what the
[36:45] problem is
[36:47] i think too often we're just trying to
[36:48] treat symptoms and let instead of
[36:50] letting the word of god really
[36:51] just say let's just just tell me the
[36:53] truth let's just be honest what's my
[36:54] problem
[36:56] and getting to the heart of it instead
[36:58] of just the generic
[37:00] you just need god
[37:04] not all emotions are bad
[37:08] there are negative emotions or
[37:11] uncomfortable feelings that are for our
[37:13] good
[37:15] god uses uncomfortable feelings to get
[37:17] our attention
[37:19] can i get an amen where's our organ when
[37:22] i need it
[37:24] god will use our emotions to let us know
[37:26] something's missing
[37:28] something's wrong all of a sudden how
[37:31] many of you experienced it you can throw
[37:32] a hand up near if you happen
[37:33] you're just going about your day and you
[37:35] do something also and you get this
[37:36] feeling like oh whoa something's wrong
[37:38] stop
[37:38] hold on wait a minute and you realize
[37:40] wow
[37:41] something's i missed that i didn't see
[37:43] that this was i that happened
[37:44] and what is it it's your senses your
[37:46] feelings your emotions god
[37:48] using an emotion to get your attention
[37:50] something's not right i felt uneasy
[37:51] something's wrong
[37:53] and we don't experience that i can even
[37:56] remember
[37:57] in the last couple of years the
[37:58] situation for weeks and weeks and weeks
[38:00] something would overwhelm me and grip me
[38:02] whenever i saw something
[38:04] and it was almost a torment so i got
[38:05] with the person spent time with them
[38:07] trying to figure out what was wrong
[38:08] figure out what's wrong
[38:09] and it took me weeks to where finally
[38:10] after a couple hours on the phone i was
[38:12] like nah something's wrong somewhere
[38:13] something's wrong i don't know what's
[38:14] going on
[38:15] and you kept kept pushing that push that
[38:16] foot and finally it came out
[38:19] and i would have never it wasn't like i
[38:20] had some sort of discernment like well
[38:22] the lord showed me what you're doing
[38:23] there and you need to give all that
[38:24] money back no it was a situation where i
[38:26] just didn't feel right
[38:28] something wasn't right in my spirit god
[38:30] will use feelings
[38:33] even our feelings of guilt or regret
[38:36] uneasiness can signal to us that
[38:38] something is not right
[38:41] paul says in second corinthians chapter
[38:42] 7 verse 10 for godly sorrow
[38:45] worketh repentance to salvation not to
[38:47] be repented of so someone who is
[38:49] not yet saved experiences godly sorrow
[38:52] in order to repent and be saved so you
[38:55] can't say that the godly sorrow was the
[38:57] product of the holy spirit abiding with
[38:59] the heart of a child of god
[39:01] it's a sinner experiencing a sorrow that
[39:04] was
[39:04] imparted to them or caused by god and
[39:08] the godly sorrow leads them to
[39:09] repentance that they
[39:10] they don't need to apologize or repent
[39:12] of but the sorrow of the world
[39:14] worketh death
[39:17] there's an emotion of the world that's
[39:18] just going to lead you to death but
[39:19] there's actually a sorrow and emotion
[39:21] that god provokes or pricks within your
[39:23] heart that can lead to life
[39:26] so there's certain emotions that can be
[39:27] warning signs to us
[39:31] emotion of impatience agitation or
[39:34] frustration or anger
[39:36] find yourself constantly being angry
[39:38] overwhelmed with anxiety
[39:40] a a sense of dissatisfaction or being
[39:43] unhappy and things not ever being able
[39:44] to be right
[39:45] there's things that become red flags and
[39:46] warning signs to us and it's a way that
[39:49] our
[39:49] god is trying to get our attention to
[39:51] take inventory and ask ourselves
[39:53] what must be causing this because that's
[39:57] not a fruit of the spirit
[40:00] in acts chapter 2 verse 37 after peter
[40:02] has
[40:03] thoroughly convicted them and pronounced
[40:05] them guilty of crucifying jesus christ
[40:08] it says now when they heard this they
[40:10] had heard you're guilty you've got blood
[40:11] on your hands
[40:12] you've done things that are wrong when
[40:13] they heard that they were pricked
[40:16] that means they had this it means to
[40:18] pain the mind sharply to agitate it
[40:21] vehemently it's it's used of the emotion
[40:24] of sorrow
[40:24] the preaching of the word pricked them
[40:26] in their heart in their response to the
[40:29] prick was
[40:29] well what shall we do
[40:32] what caused that the word preached prick
[40:35] them in their emotions
[40:37] and based upon this feeling that they
[40:39] had in their hearts and being agitated
[40:41] in their hearts and having a sense of
[40:43] something's wrong we're guilty what they
[40:45] call them to ask what we must do
[40:46] and it gives us the the prescription
[40:49] repent and be baptized
[40:51] how do we even have the prescription
[40:53] because the word preached provoked an
[40:55] emotion and caused
[40:56] discomfort and caused these people to be
[40:59] agitated and uncomfortable and they said
[41:01] well what should we do
[41:02] peter and it was the answer to their
[41:04] agitation it was the answer to their
[41:06] discomfort to repent and be baptized in
[41:08] the name of jesus christ
[41:11] it was all these emotions i say all
[41:14] these emotions there's emotions that
[41:16] will signify that god wants to use
[41:21] does do you understand that in john
[41:24] chapter 8 there's a woman that is caught
[41:26] as the bible says in the very act of
[41:28] adultery so there should be no question
[41:29] as to her guilt
[41:31] and they bring her to jesus in order to
[41:33] use her as a pawn to try to trap jesus
[41:35] and to trip him up
[41:37] and the bible says that jesus as they
[41:39] come to him he looks down and
[41:41] and the scripture says that he's kind of
[41:43] ignoring he's not even responding to
[41:44] what they're saying and he's writing in
[41:46] the sand
[41:48] and they and they asked again in john
[41:51] chapter 8 verses 7 and 9. so when they
[41:52] continued asking him
[41:54] he lifted up himself and said unto them
[41:56] he that is without sin among you
[41:58] let him cast a stone at her
[42:01] and again he stooped down and wrote on
[42:03] the ground and they which heard it
[42:05] being convicted by their own conscience
[42:10] what happened what jesus said
[42:14] and even there there's even there's this
[42:17] thought that maybe what he was writing
[42:20] caused a feeling within these men
[42:23] and as they began to hear it they begot
[42:25] got convicted by their own conscience
[42:27] and went out one by one beginning at the
[42:29] eldest
[42:31] perhaps suggesting that the ones who had
[42:33] the most sins to look back upon in their
[42:35] lives
[42:35] carried the most guilt and thought well
[42:37] i'm out of here
[42:39] even to the youngest who'd be the most
[42:41] zealous and uh
[42:42] and the youthful enthusiasm without much
[42:44] wisdom and maybe not having as much
[42:46] breath of sin
[42:47] it says even to the youngest even unto
[42:50] the last and jesus was left alone and
[42:53] the woman's
[42:53] woman standing in the midst here jesus
[42:58] kind of confronts their ungodliness and
[42:59] their their unrighteous
[43:01] vindictiveness he that is without sin
[43:03] let them cast the first stone
[43:05] it's a very interesting discourse how
[43:06] that jesus used that
[43:08] to prey upon their emotions and they let
[43:11] they dropped the stones
[43:12] and they walked away but in walking away
[43:14] none of them repented
[43:17] not one of them said i'm sorry ma'am
[43:21] not one of them were none of them were
[43:23] moved to humility to say lord
[43:26] you're right here we are with such
[43:29] ambition to trap you that we take this
[43:31] woman caught in adultery we violate our
[43:33] law we don't even bring that man
[43:35] who was also caught in the act and and
[43:37] none of them fully owned up to what was
[43:39] taking place
[43:40] when they began to experience the guilt
[43:42] they just dropped the stones and got out
[43:44] of there real quick
[43:47] holding stones getting ready to murder a
[43:49] woman
[43:50] and use the word to as justification and
[43:53] then when they get called out upon
[43:54] they get pricked but what do they do
[43:56] they just drop the stone and they walk
[43:57] off
[44:00] the feeling of discomfort caused them to
[44:02] drop their stones
[44:05] but it says nothing of them reconciling
[44:07] their hypocrisy
[44:10] says nothing about them reconciling
[44:12] their or resolving their wrong
[44:14] inclinations and say we're sorry we were
[44:15] wrong we shouldn't have done that
[44:23] if we sort of using take it back to this
[44:26] inversion
[44:28] if we suppress feelings instead of
[44:29] addressing them
[44:32] if we just drop the stones and run away
[44:34] if we just try to repress it and
[44:36] quiet that feeling or whatever they
[44:39] could actually be keeping ourselves from
[44:40] experiencing pure joy
[44:42] and remember i said this may have just
[44:44] very specific application
[44:46] this may not apply to most of us it may
[44:48] not even apply to
[44:49] it may only apply to very few but it's
[44:52] worth it
[44:54] we can bury something some emotion some
[44:58] experience i would even say even a sin
[45:00] there could be something that we can say
[45:02] or do something we've experienced
[45:04] that's been said or done to us that was
[45:06] very hurtful very harmful
[45:07] we could take that emotion and we can
[45:09] bury it but it's still there
[45:12] what you buried it there it's still
[45:15] there
[45:16] and though you may not be actively
[45:18] thinking about it the subconscious
[45:19] somehow still knows it's there
[45:22] it's subconscious but in the
[45:23] subconscious that's where you buried it
[45:25] it's like
[45:26] in your mind you got something you're
[45:27] wrestling with and you knock on the door
[45:28] and subconscious says can i help you
[45:30] i need to bury something and your
[45:33] subconscious is in there going oh my
[45:35] what do we do with this and you leave
[45:38] the room you lock it you clock the door
[45:40] you
[45:40] brick over it and everything and and you
[45:42] build another wall in front of it and
[45:43] you
[45:43] you throw away the key and you move on
[45:45] and you've gone on with your life and
[45:47] hey isn't that great your subconscious
[45:48] is in there
[45:49] get me out of here what is this thing
[45:52] it's in there somewhere
[45:57] our bodies keep score even if our minds
[46:00] aren't thinking about it
[46:06] our bodies keep score our subconscious
[46:08] can get weighed down even if we're not
[46:09] aware of its direct
[46:10] impact and i i just want to say this
[46:15] and maybe not give many examples i just
[46:17] want to say it in a very direct way
[46:20] feelings that are repressed can lead to
[46:22] emotional meltdowns
[46:25] feelings that are covered up things that
[46:27] are buried things that are just not
[46:28] addressed things that just
[46:30] are buried and buried and buried it can
[46:31] actually lead to an outburst that's
[46:32] unexplained
[46:33] where did this come from why is this
[46:36] happening
[46:37] it could even lead and very and and this
[46:41] this very very real to even disorders
[46:44] disassociation disorders and different
[46:46] mental disorders that are a direct
[46:47] result of someone repeatedly and
[46:49] constantly
[46:50] trying to cover something and bury
[46:54] something
[46:59] and it's even in these repressed
[47:02] emotions that can actually cause
[47:06] health issues i
[47:09] i could share the i could share the
[47:11] science with you
[47:17] i could share a number of quotations
[47:18] with you from the message of the hour
[47:22] that identifies how certain emotions and
[47:23] certain feelings and harboring certain
[47:25] things and things being there in your
[47:26] spirit
[47:27] actually cause sicknesses
[47:33] we can become numb to the hurts that
[47:35] we've received
[47:38] we could become numb to even the
[47:39] offenses that we've caused
[47:42] and listen i i there's no rebuke in that
[47:45] it's not like
[47:46] it's there's no chastisement in that
[47:48] it's it's an
[47:49] observation it's the truth and we do it
[47:52] to protect ourselves from pain
[47:56] one may do it to avoid a bad memory
[47:59] anomaly another may be doing it to avoid
[48:01] a new hurt
[48:02] i'm just not gonna let that bother me
[48:04] i'm just not gonna let that bother me
[48:05] i'm just not gonna let that bother me
[48:07] but this is where i i'm hopefully
[48:11] turning the corner and we see the end in
[48:12] view
[48:14] not only may it be keeping you from pain
[48:17] it may be doing a very good job of
[48:18] keeping you from a new hurt
[48:20] it may be doing a very good job of
[48:21] keeping you from thinking about an
[48:22] uncomfortable memory but it'll also hold
[48:24] you back from joy
[48:26] not only will that thought process
[48:28] protect you from that uncomfortable
[48:30] thought
[48:30] not only will it protect you from a new
[48:32] offense and them being able to hurt you
[48:34] again they may never change so what you
[48:35] do is you come up with all these ways
[48:38] of changing the effect that their
[48:40] behavior has on you
[48:41] they may never change and you change all
[48:43] you do all these things to change the
[48:45] way it
[48:45] impacts you well i hate feeling that way
[48:47] i hate experiencing that
[48:48] i hate having this attitude and listen
[48:50] i'll say this just very very pointedly
[48:52] a lot of times as believers we're so
[48:54] sincere when it comes to the preaching
[48:56] of the word
[48:56] in the gift of god that we're not being
[48:58] nourished we're not being fed we're
[48:59] actually being torn down
[49:00] and we use a lot of defense mechanisms
[49:03] to protect the preacher and not
[49:04] ourselves
[49:05] because our needs aren't being met in
[49:06] the word of god
[49:09] and you know what that does it makes you
[49:11] less
[49:12] able to actually experience the word
[49:17] and it have a positive impact on you
[49:20] because you've been spending
[49:21] service after service and decade after
[49:23] decade trying to figure out a way to
[49:25] keep that from hurting you
[49:33] i took this statement from
[49:36] a book it says while emotional numbing
[49:38] blocks or shuts down negative feelings
[49:40] and experiences
[49:42] it also shuts down the ability to
[49:44] experience pleasure
[49:45] engage in positive interactions and
[49:47] social activities and interferes with
[49:49] openness for intimacy social interest
[49:52] and problem-solving skills this is the
[49:55] dark side of it
[49:56] on one hand this is healthy and it's
[49:58] keeping me sane and it's keeping me
[49:59] going it's keeping me alive
[50:01] but now it's saying that this this
[50:02] ability to become emotionally numb
[50:04] it may block out bad things but it also
[50:07] begins to shut out good things
[50:09] it may protect you on one hand but now
[50:11] it's beginning to hurt you on the other
[50:12] because now you become immune to
[50:14] stimulus you become immune
[50:16] to things that could prod you things
[50:17] that could provoke you things that can
[50:19] help you
[50:19] you're so busy trying not to be hurt
[50:22] you're unable to be helped
[50:26] because of the experiences of our past
[50:28] we can get have this certain fear of
[50:29] certain dynamics and certain powers and
[50:31] certain positions
[50:32] and certain people and things where i
[50:33] don't know if i could ever trust again i
[50:35] don't know if i could ever do this i
[50:36] don't want to do that
[50:37] and eventually what begins to happen is
[50:38] you're suspicious of god
[50:42] when we become numb this is where it
[50:44] gets
[50:45] i'm numb my spirit is not my heart david
[50:48] says my heart is numb within me when you
[50:49] become numb
[50:50] you don't feel anything you experience
[50:54] neither pain nor
[50:56] joy you're numb
[50:59] i became numb to protect myself from
[51:01] pain but now
[51:02] i don't feel anything
[51:06] is it too close to home remember we can
[51:09] always say amen about our neighbors in
[51:10] the apartment next door right
[51:14] yep that perfectly fits them
[51:18] we can't i did this to protect myself
[51:21] i did it because i was tired and weary
[51:25] and i did this to to keep from getting
[51:28] frustrated and upset and i did all this
[51:30] but now i can't feel anything anymore
[51:34] my title was originally going to be
[51:36] uncomfortably numb
[51:39] because my whole goal in ministering on
[51:40] this was to make us uncomfortable with
[51:42] our numbness
[51:44] if it seemed to be a paradox maybe it's
[51:45] true but we're numb we're numb we're
[51:47] numb but then
[51:48] let the word of god immediately finally
[51:50] begin to provoke
[51:51] stimulate in some way to where now we
[51:53] realize i'm uncomfortable
[51:55] being numb i don't want to be numb
[51:58] anymore i don't want to be unmoved
[52:02] i don't want to be unaffected i don't
[52:04] want to no longer be responding to
[52:06] stimulus i don't want to be the one
[52:08] who's constantly warring and wrestling i
[52:09] want to experience the joy of the lord i
[52:11] want to feel liberty in my spirit
[52:12] i want to have enthusiasm again for the
[52:14] things of god i'm tired of being numb
[52:16] and realize that i am uncomfortably numb
[52:19] oh god
[52:20] do something to give me feeling again
[52:26] even if it means i have to begin to
[52:28] experience pain
[52:29] can we get desperate enough for joy that
[52:32] we're willing to fill again
[52:33] and face pain in order to experience
[52:35] what god has for us
[52:38] because god needs to make us
[52:39] uncomfortable before he can give us pure
[52:41] joy
[52:43] job chapter 36 verse 15 he delivereth
[52:45] the poor and his affliction
[52:46] and openeth their ears and oppression i
[52:49] studied this scripture last week wanting
[52:51] to fully understand it and understand
[52:53] its meaning behind it and elohim as he
[52:55] was speaking
[52:57] there's such force and such weight
[52:58] behind what he says
[53:00] and it stands for the proposition that
[53:02] when someone is going through an
[53:04] affliction the poor going through
[53:05] something
[53:06] then god is there to whisper to them
[53:07] than to help them and he opened up their
[53:09] ears and oppression
[53:11] it actually speaks in a way to say that
[53:13] he gets their attention by pressing on
[53:15] them
[53:17] the god will actually he wants to
[53:18] comfort you in your affliction
[53:20] but many times he's allowed the
[53:22] affliction so you could turn to him as
[53:24] the comforter
[53:27] he actually uses our feelings to shake
[53:30] us
[53:32] listen becoming numb does not produce
[53:34] healing
[53:37] as a matter of fact becoming numb
[53:38] produces more damage
[53:44] to heal we must feel
[53:47] some of us are so afraid of feeling pain
[53:51] that will never be able to be healed
[53:54] in order to be healed you're going to
[53:56] have to feel
[54:00] in deuteronomy chapter 32 verse 11 it
[54:02] says as an eagle stirth up her nest
[54:04] fluttereth over her young spreadeth
[54:06] abroad her wings
[54:08] taketh and beareth them on her wings the
[54:10] love of a mother eagle
[54:12] is so profound that god likens his love
[54:14] and his care
[54:15] to that of a mother who looks out over
[54:18] her eagle it's
[54:18] so the lord alone did lead him and there
[54:20] was no strange god with him
[54:23] this is the compassion of god dealing
[54:25] with us as those
[54:27] as the compassions and the actions of a
[54:29] mother eagle this is what the scripture
[54:31] is pointing out
[54:33] but the visual in the image of this is
[54:34] so amazing the as an eagle stirreth her
[54:37] and fluttereth over her young to stir it
[54:39] means to rouse
[54:40] oneself to awake to awaken or to incite
[54:45] says to stir if it means it comes from
[54:46] the word to be exposed to be beared to
[54:49] lay bare
[54:50] so here are these eaglets resting
[54:52] comfortably in the nest
[54:53] but now comes a season and a time to fly
[54:56] and now the mother
[54:57] is going to get their attention and she
[54:59] stirs them and she flutters over them
[55:02] and her activity of beating the wings
[55:03] and stirring things up and quicken
[55:05] something and it lays things
[55:07] bare and she's stirring them but listen
[55:10] not for the purpose of just causing a
[55:12] disturbance but she's doing it for them
[55:14] to take the next step
[55:15] she's stirring things up they're exposed
[55:17] and they're laid bare they're awakened
[55:19] they're roused up from their sleep and
[55:20] their comfort
[55:21] and she's doing it because it's time for
[55:23] maturity and now it's time for them to
[55:25] fly and so she has to stir things up a
[55:27] little bit
[55:30] if we're ever going to learn how to fly
[55:34] we need to get uncomfortable and face
[55:35] certain fears
[55:40] in john chapter 4.
[55:50] in john chapter 4 we've been reading
[55:53] this scripture quite a bit over the last
[55:55] few months several months maybe and so
[55:58] it's the story of the woman at the well
[56:00] jesus was tired and he was weary and he
[56:01] came to the well to get water while the
[56:03] disciples went to go get food
[56:05] and he's having a conversation with this
[56:07] woman and he's a little combative at
[56:09] first what do you you know
[56:10] you being a jew what do you have to do
[56:12] with me a samaritan and so he's
[56:14] telling her that i have water that if
[56:16] you drink of this water you'll never
[56:17] thirst
[56:18] and if i give this to you a well of
[56:20] water shall be springing up out of you
[56:22] under everlasting life and he's saying
[56:24] things to her that he later on will say
[56:27] at the time of the feast of tabernacles
[56:30] says the woman saith unto him sir give
[56:32] me this water that i thirst not neither
[56:33] come hither to draw
[56:35] and we see how despite her attitude of
[56:38] defiance and disbelief
[56:40] she's still not really fully
[56:41] understanding what water he was offering
[56:43] so he said just give me this water so i
[56:45] don't have to thirst again
[56:46] or have to come here to draw it in jesus
[56:48] saying the hurt now notice all of a
[56:50] sudden how this conversation goes
[56:51] this is what we would we would
[56:52] immediately post uh that escalated
[56:55] quickly meme
[56:56] right hey i got water and if you drink
[56:59] this water you're going to be happy all
[57:00] the time give it to me i want to have it
[57:02] we'll go get your husband and tell him
[57:04] to come here
[57:06] anybody that knew her like that
[57:07] escalated quickly
[57:09] that didn't take him long think about it
[57:12] the woman answered and said
[57:14] i have no husband. and jesus said unto
[57:17] her
[57:17] thou hast said well i well said i have
[57:20] no husband.
[57:21] for thou has had five husbands and he
[57:24] whom thou now housed
[57:26] is not thy husband in that settest thou
[57:29] truly
[57:32] yeah burn
[57:35] somebody get the melo gel for her
[57:39] she's gonna need a little lavender on
[57:40] her big toe after that burn
[57:43] think about it why did jesus have to go
[57:46] there
[57:47] let's just be real raw about this let's
[57:49] just think about we hear the story and
[57:50] we think oh this is jesus this is jesus
[57:52] here's a woman a young woman here's a
[57:54] woman that comes to a well she's here at
[57:55] this well
[57:56] she's just there minding her business
[57:58] she's going to get some water she's just
[57:59] wanting to get water and this guy says
[58:01] hey draw some water for me she kind of
[58:02] smarts off a little bit how are you
[58:04] going to get water you got nothing to
[58:05] draw with you're jew what do you have
[58:06] anything to do with me and samantha he
[58:07] starts talking about a different kind of
[58:08] water and different kind of well and
[58:10] everything
[58:10] and she says well let me have it and
[58:12] then he says well go get your husband
[58:15] and and innocently if she only had one
[58:17] husband she's like well
[58:18] yeah i can get him what do you need him
[58:20] for but no he was on to something
[58:22] we know it but think about how raw this
[58:24] conversation was why did he go here
[58:28] why didn't he mind his own business
[58:31] right why do you have to go talking
[58:33] about not just the man she's with now
[58:36] but the five other guys that she was
[58:38] married to
[58:39] why because the word had to address her
[58:41] pain
[58:43] she was in a cycle that would continue
[58:45] to perpetuate
[58:47] every day of her life because of some
[58:48] pain something inside of her
[58:51] because even if she wasn't conscious of
[58:54] guilt
[58:55] in her mind it mattered
[58:59] even if she was there at that time
[59:00] drawing water and wasn't quite thinking
[59:03] about the implications and thinking
[59:04] about her life and thinking about what
[59:06] she was going through
[59:07] christ knew by discernment that what she
[59:09] had been through
[59:10] and who she was with and these five
[59:12] husbands was something that covered up
[59:14] her spirit in darkness
[59:16] it was to a place where now she had
[59:17] become numb she had five husbands and
[59:20] the man she's now with she's not even
[59:22] married to anymore
[59:23] why she had become numb to it
[59:27] there was a wound deep within her spirit
[59:33] i i i'll accept you say well brother
[59:34] aaron you're
[59:36] you're really taking some liberty with
[59:38] it i'll accept that
[59:41] but you're talking about a young woman
[59:42] that brother branham said had been
[59:43] turned out by her parents as a young
[59:45] teenage girl
[59:46] turnout in the streets was coming to the
[59:48] well and a lot of the commentators
[59:50] uh referred to this that she may have
[59:51] been a prostitute the time of day that
[59:53] she was going when others weren't there
[59:55] there's a lot that would take that line
[59:56] of thinking that here was a woman
[59:58] who had lived so filthy and so foul and
[1:00:00] had been turned out on the streets and
[1:00:02] married this man and taken advantage of
[1:00:03] married that one and all these different
[1:00:04] things happening
[1:00:05] that even if she had she has all these
[1:00:08] things in her young past
[1:00:09] she has everything there even if she had
[1:00:11] suppressed it she'd never changed unless
[1:00:13] it came
[1:00:14] out somehow she couldn't just leave from
[1:00:17] there she couldn't just go on with her
[1:00:18] life
[1:00:19] and then pretend that that life never
[1:00:21] happened it would always be there unless
[1:00:23] somehow
[1:00:24] the word of god could bring it up and
[1:00:26] could resolve it
[1:00:28] if i could say it this way god had to
[1:00:30] bring it up to wash it away
[1:00:32] god has to identify the stain in order
[1:00:34] for the blood to be covered upon it god
[1:00:36] has to find the wound that's hurting
[1:00:38] in the place that's hurting in order to
[1:00:40] apply the balm it can't just be some
[1:00:42] kind of simple seance that we think is
[1:00:43] going to solve everything
[1:00:45] but god had to cause it to come up in
[1:00:47] order to heal it
[1:00:50] if he was ever going to deal with it it
[1:00:51] had to come up
[1:00:53] and that's exactly what jesus did he
[1:00:56] actually probably went to the soros
[1:00:58] spot in her life the one thing that
[1:01:01] everybody else that might have known her
[1:01:02] is like don't say
[1:01:03] anything about who she's living with
[1:01:07] just leave it alone right sensitive
[1:01:10] subject
[1:01:11] we call it a bear trap when you ask
[1:01:14] somebody
[1:01:15] so how many months pregnant are you and
[1:01:16] everybody's like
[1:01:19] she's not pregnant what are you doing
[1:01:20] it's a bear trap right you're gonna get
[1:01:22] it
[1:01:23] how do you get yourself out of that you
[1:01:24] don't know how to get out of it
[1:01:31] now think very soberly about this
[1:01:33] despite my joke
[1:01:35] we can have a this i'm drawn from the
[1:01:38] scripture
[1:01:39] jesus was not afraid to ask
[1:01:44] jesus wasn't afraid to bring it up why
[1:01:47] because he's not afraid of the solution
[1:01:49] he has
[1:01:51] he's not afraid of the answer he's not
[1:01:53] afraid that he can say well how are you
[1:01:55] doing all says well to be honest with
[1:01:56] you i'm possessed with the devil
[1:01:58] you really do have problems call the
[1:02:00] authorities
[1:02:02] not afraid i've got the we've got the
[1:02:04] answer listen but brother and sister
[1:02:06] we ought to believe that we have the
[1:02:08] answer
[1:02:09] for whatever the person in this world is
[1:02:11] hurting with whatever a believer is
[1:02:13] alien with
[1:02:13] this word is the answer i'm not afraid
[1:02:16] that we'll get frustrated and not know
[1:02:17] what to do
[1:02:18] we know a god that's got the answer
[1:02:22] christ demonstrated this in a situation
[1:02:24] where no there's no message pastor that
[1:02:26] would want to counsel that situation
[1:02:28] there's no man of god that would want to
[1:02:29] roll up his sleeves and get dirty with
[1:02:31] that
[1:02:31] but what did jesus do he went right to
[1:02:33] it
[1:02:36] he said where's your husband well i
[1:02:37] don't have one you're right you said the
[1:02:39] truth because you're with the man right
[1:02:40] now and he's not your husband
[1:02:42] but in reality you've had five husbands
[1:02:45] he went straight to it
[1:02:48] it wasn't an off-limits topic
[1:02:53] let me say this i'm being very real
[1:02:56] we have a lot of taboos
[1:03:02] we have a lot of
[1:03:06] well let me say this way let me maybe
[1:03:09] provide a little bit more grace we can
[1:03:10] have taboos
[1:03:12] and we can create hostile atmospheres
[1:03:17] that do not promote healing
[1:03:22] we can make something so taboo that if
[1:03:24] someone is struggling with it they're
[1:03:25] never going to get the deliverance they
[1:03:27] need
[1:03:27] because that's taboo
[1:03:30] we can have emotional pains and past and
[1:03:32] things that people experience and things
[1:03:34] people go through
[1:03:34] and everyone else is seemingly living
[1:03:36] such a perfect life that someone's
[1:03:38] afraid to say my life isn't perfect i'm
[1:03:41] struggling
[1:03:41] everyone else gets to go out to eat
[1:03:43] after service and i gotta go home and
[1:03:44] wonder if i'm gonna have enough gas
[1:03:46] money to make it to church
[1:03:47] because we stigmatize uh blessings and
[1:03:50] surplus and doing this and doing that
[1:03:52] and you have somebody who's hurting and
[1:03:53] broken
[1:03:54] and can't figure a way out and we create
[1:03:56] an atmosphere to where that person
[1:03:58] can never feel safe enough to say i need
[1:04:00] help can someone help me
[1:04:02] why through our taboos and our hostile
[1:04:04] environments where there's never any
[1:04:06] healing there's never any settling
[1:04:08] there's never any peace that someone
[1:04:09] comes to in mark chapter 9 verse 24
[1:04:13] this is how christ could still address a
[1:04:16] weakness or an area
[1:04:17] he calls to a woman and says bring me
[1:04:19] your husband and he begins to have a
[1:04:20] conversation with her probably the
[1:04:22] darkest part of her spirit
[1:04:23] and another man has a child who is sick
[1:04:25] and he says if you'll just believe
[1:04:26] she'll be made way
[1:04:27] made well and straightway the father
[1:04:29] child cried out and said with tears
[1:04:31] this is how comfortable this man was in
[1:04:33] the presence of christ
[1:04:35] lord i believe if i can say but help
[1:04:38] thou my unbelief
[1:04:41] would we even allow someone in our
[1:04:44] families or in our churches enough
[1:04:46] liberty to say yes
[1:04:47] i believe but my belief needs healing
[1:04:51] that's exactly what he says when he says
[1:04:52] help down my unbelief heal the defect in
[1:04:55] my faith
[1:04:55] my faith isn't complete my faith isn't
[1:04:58] whole
[1:04:58] lord i do believe you're a healer but
[1:05:00] right now i'm feeling very vulnerable
[1:05:02] right now it's my own child i've never
[1:05:04] felt like this before i've never felt
[1:05:06] hopeless i've never felt pressed
[1:05:08] i'm worried that maybe my sins have
[1:05:10] caused this i'm worried that my bad
[1:05:11] decisions have brought this upon my
[1:05:13] family
[1:05:13] i'm feeling very anxious i feel like i'm
[1:05:16] gonna have a nervous breakdown
[1:05:17] oh god help me help me heal my faith
[1:05:23] or we say well that guy just needs the
[1:05:25] holy ghost
[1:05:34] buried unresolved pain
[1:05:40] unresolved doubts questions issues can
[1:05:43] become so buried
[1:05:45] that it just becomes a ticking time bomb
[1:05:50] and the only one that knows it is our
[1:05:51] subconscious
[1:05:53] because it's in that room with the
[1:05:54] ticking time bomb you've thrown in there
[1:05:57] and it knows it's banging on the door
[1:06:00] it's gonna happen i can't stop this i
[1:06:03] can't contain it
[1:06:05] and let me say this in grace just to
[1:06:09] move a step further for god to heal it
[1:06:14] he needs to expose it
[1:06:19] do you understand if he was going to
[1:06:22] ever heal the woman at the well of her
[1:06:24] the scar the pain that caused her to
[1:06:27] live that kind of lifestyle
[1:06:29] he had to call it out first
[1:06:32] he's showing i'm willing to take you as
[1:06:34] you are
[1:06:36] i don't have to pretend that you're some
[1:06:37] righteous pure white lily that came to
[1:06:40] the well a little bit late this
[1:06:41] afternoon
[1:06:41] and you can accept the messiah i can
[1:06:44] take you as you are with your doubts
[1:06:45] with your pains with your fears with
[1:06:47] your worries
[1:06:47] with your past i can take you as you are
[1:06:49] because i'm a problem solver
[1:06:53] i can fix this is what christ is saying
[1:07:02] i just need to move quickly here but
[1:07:05] just to use it as an example so you
[1:07:06] understand
[1:07:07] god needs to expose it to heal it we
[1:07:09] have to become conscious of our sins in
[1:07:11] order to repent of it
[1:07:13] david would have never repented of his
[1:07:15] sins of adultery and murder had nathan
[1:07:17] not come and provoked him
[1:07:18] to feel the full weight and guilt of it
[1:07:21] through the story of the man who took
[1:07:22] another man's sheep
[1:07:24] it probably pricked him it provoked him
[1:07:26] what it what had david been able to do
[1:07:27] for
[1:07:27] months he'd been able to bury it right
[1:07:31] minutely move back move on with his life
[1:07:33] and pretend
[1:07:34] to have everything in order but the word
[1:07:36] of god pricked him
[1:07:38] and there's barriers to our joy that can
[1:07:40] reside in a
[1:07:41] reside in our spirits but the spirit
[1:07:44] needs to bring it up
[1:07:46] and i want to say it this way in order
[1:07:47] to put it in order
[1:07:50] there's things about our past that can't
[1:07:54] god can't change he can't change the
[1:07:56] past
[1:07:57] i know i'm walking in a very delicate
[1:07:59] place here but i want you to understand
[1:08:00] this
[1:08:01] we know what's happened
[1:08:06] and we can't we can't get into a little
[1:08:08] time machine and go back
[1:08:10] and change what's happened
[1:08:15] but we can change how the past has
[1:08:18] changed us
[1:08:21] we can he could take these things that
[1:08:23] are in our past and he can put him in
[1:08:25] order
[1:08:26] so that the good he promised can come of
[1:08:28] it
[1:08:33] because there's things that god can use
[1:08:38] but he's got to bring it to ser the
[1:08:39] surface in order to utilize it
[1:08:45] is everyone out are the kids out of
[1:08:46] school now someone told me the other day
[1:08:48] that college is over how many kids how
[1:08:49] many kids are still in school
[1:08:52] just well okay school's still on all
[1:08:54] right well
[1:08:55] i was hoping maybe it wasn't a school
[1:08:56] night and those of us who have work can
[1:08:58] call in late
[1:08:59] because it's getting late second
[1:09:02] corinthians chapter 12 verses 7 to 10 i
[1:09:04] just feel that i must
[1:09:05] press through with this because god has
[1:09:08] to surface things so he can use it
[1:09:10] now this this instance is just going to
[1:09:13] give us a principle that we can use
[1:09:15] paul says in second corinthians chapter
[1:09:17] 12 verses 7 to 10 lest i should be
[1:09:18] exalted above measure
[1:09:20] through the abundance of the revelations
[1:09:22] there was given to me
[1:09:23] a thorn in the flesh so now he he he's
[1:09:26] using a language is very positive this
[1:09:27] is something maybe a prophet can do
[1:09:29] he's so sure he's had such supernatural
[1:09:31] things happen and he actually equates
[1:09:33] the thorn to
[1:09:34] the his abundance of revelation so he
[1:09:35] may not be able to fully relate but he's
[1:09:37] acknowledging that there's some sort of
[1:09:38] thorn that's in his flesh
[1:09:40] let me say this for time's sake that
[1:09:43] whenever the body has
[1:09:44] a foreign object enters the body there's
[1:09:46] a way that the body responds to a thorn
[1:09:49] to a splinter
[1:09:50] something that gets inside the body and
[1:09:52] the body immediately begins to address
[1:09:54] it in order to protect the rest of the
[1:09:55] body
[1:09:56] and the the sensitivity you feel and
[1:09:58] even the infection the things that
[1:09:59] begins to set in
[1:10:00] is the body's way of saying this doesn't
[1:10:02] belong here build a bubble around it
[1:10:04] keep it where it's at don't let it go
[1:10:05] any further and it'll actually fester
[1:10:07] and it can become very covered up and
[1:10:09] there can be something nodule things
[1:10:10] grow over it and cover it up but in
[1:10:13] order the body sometimes will actually
[1:10:14] try to eject that
[1:10:16] and push it out on its own but sometimes
[1:10:18] the body's covered it up and it becomes
[1:10:19] infected
[1:10:20] and it's covered over and you've got to
[1:10:21] go in and cut it out to remove it
[1:10:23] because the body's identified this as
[1:10:25] something that's not supposed to be
[1:10:26] there
[1:10:27] and there's people that live with
[1:10:28] foreign objects in the body
[1:10:30] and it's painful and it gets infected
[1:10:31] but as it continues eventually
[1:10:33] the body has neutralized it and the
[1:10:35] person can become numb to the presence
[1:10:37] of a thorn and they just live with it
[1:10:41] work through the pain and then just get
[1:10:44] numb to it
[1:10:44] after a while and doctors can say how in
[1:10:47] the world did you live with that
[1:10:51] people with bullets and their in their
[1:10:54] head and people with things and their
[1:10:55] sinuses
[1:10:56] i remember when i was a kid i lost the
[1:10:57] the cap to the pen and i couldn't find
[1:10:59] it
[1:10:59] and it's way up in their sinus cavity
[1:11:01] and they thought they just had sinus
[1:11:02] problems and they always had allergies
[1:11:04] and
[1:11:04] and they'll live the doctors like how in
[1:11:06] the world did you do this i just got
[1:11:07] used to it
[1:11:09] it just became a way of life now paul is
[1:11:12] identifying a thorn in the flesh this
[1:11:13] would be a discomfort he says a
[1:11:15] messenger of satan that buffets him
[1:11:16] lest i should be exalted above measure
[1:11:18] then in verse 8 for this thing i
[1:11:20] besought the lord three times
[1:11:22] that it might depart from me lord this
[1:11:24] pain this buffeting this problem
[1:11:26] let it depart from me and christ
[1:11:28] answered listen his answer is not no i'm
[1:11:30] not going to let it depart from you
[1:11:32] his answer is not even saying that no
[1:11:34] i'm going to let it remain his answer
[1:11:36] was to point him to something greater
[1:11:38] than the thorn recognize that jesus
[1:11:41] doesn't say
[1:11:42] no i won't deliver you recognize he
[1:11:44] doesn't say no you're gonna have to live
[1:11:45] with it for the rest of your life
[1:11:47] he says my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:11:49] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:11:52] weakness
[1:11:54] can we all agree his strength is perfect
[1:11:57] and that his strength is perfect and he
[1:11:59] does not need our weaknesses added to it
[1:12:01] to make it perfect
[1:12:04] think about it think about what the
[1:12:05] scripture is saying it's not that jesus
[1:12:07] is strong and you've got to add your
[1:12:09] weakness to it to make him perfectly
[1:12:11] strong
[1:12:11] his strength is perfect without your
[1:12:13] weakness so when jesus says my grace is
[1:12:15] sufficient for thee
[1:12:16] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:12:18] weakness he means in weakness is where
[1:12:20] my strength shines
[1:12:24] it's in your weakness that you really
[1:12:26] benefit from my strength
[1:12:27] hallelujah isn't that wonderful he says
[1:12:30] oh i've got this messenger of satan to
[1:12:32] buff at me
[1:12:32] he's saying paul i want you to learn a
[1:12:34] lesson i want you to teach it to my
[1:12:36] believers that in times like that that's
[1:12:38] when my strength becomes perfect
[1:12:40] it's in times like that that's when my
[1:12:42] strength really shines
[1:12:43] it's when you're going through a hard
[1:12:45] time it's when satan's buffing in you
[1:12:47] it's when it's hurt
[1:12:48] it's when it's painful that's when my
[1:12:50] strength reaches its full
[1:12:52] and supreme expression for you
[1:12:55] it was teaching them a lesson don't even
[1:12:58] ask for the pain to go away
[1:13:00] just ask for me to become more real
[1:13:02] don't even ask for it god get the thorn
[1:13:04] for me don't get the thorn from he says
[1:13:05] no
[1:13:06] the thorn is there so you can realize
[1:13:07] just how much more i love you
[1:13:09] then you realize just how much more of a
[1:13:10] healer i am just how much more of a
[1:13:12] deliver i was
[1:13:13] i thank god that this way hasn't been
[1:13:15] easy because the harder it goes the
[1:13:17] greater his love for me feels
[1:13:24] he says then he turns his attitude most
[1:13:27] gladly therefore will i rather glory
[1:13:29] in my infirmities instead of desiring
[1:13:33] that they depart
[1:13:34] think of it this way i will boast or
[1:13:36] i'll rejoice against them because of
[1:13:38] christ
[1:13:40] i will it's not that your glory he was
[1:13:42] going to glory and worship the thorn
[1:13:44] in glory that he had the thorn but he
[1:13:46] would boast against the thorn
[1:13:48] saying every prick his strength shines
[1:13:51] every
[1:13:51] heart his strength shines every buffet
[1:13:54] every enemy
[1:13:55] every attack his strength signs shines
[1:13:58] and i will boast against the
[1:14:00] pain about the glory of christ
[1:14:06] and then he continues that the power of
[1:14:09] christ may rest upon me
[1:14:12] and this is where when brother michael
[1:14:13] was singing peace of god cover me
[1:14:15] i was coming to the pulpit because this
[1:14:18] very phrase it means that the power of
[1:14:20] christ may cover me
[1:14:22] that the power of christ may tap the
[1:14:23] word is actual phrases tabernacle upon
[1:14:26] me
[1:14:28] not not take the thorn away but cover my
[1:14:32] infirmity cover it completely over
[1:14:35] as with the tent and abide on me
[1:14:38] continually
[1:14:41] he's going to cover you therefore i take
[1:14:45] pleasure in i will act well i will
[1:14:47] prosper
[1:14:48] i will this is the language i will
[1:14:50] conduct myself with joy
[1:14:52] in the presence of the thorn and he says
[1:14:55] in
[1:14:56] infirmities in reproaches in necessities
[1:14:58] in persecutions in distresses for
[1:15:00] christ's sake
[1:15:01] for when i am weak then am i strong
[1:15:06] then i am upheld by divine arm he's
[1:15:08] drawing from the phrase let the weak say
[1:15:10] that i am strong
[1:15:11] the paul is saying the joy of the lord
[1:15:13] is my strength
[1:15:16] in the presence of the thorn in the
[1:15:18] presence of the buffet in the presence
[1:15:20] of the opposition and the presence of
[1:15:21] the fighting
[1:15:22] i can see that his strength means more
[1:15:24] to me in times like this
[1:15:27] than ever before the thorn could not
[1:15:30] torment paul
[1:15:33] even though it might hurt it couldn't
[1:15:36] torment
[1:15:38] i say it this way paul didn't need to
[1:15:39] become numb
[1:15:43] paul didn't need to become numb to the
[1:15:44] thorn
[1:15:46] he needed to always properly regard the
[1:15:49] thorn
[1:15:50] as an opportunity to boast
[1:15:53] he boasted against it he viewed it as an
[1:15:56] opportunity
[1:15:57] for strength to be made manifest
[1:15:59] perfectly to him
[1:16:00] to experience christ in a different
[1:16:04] level
[1:16:07] i'm going to be personal just for a
[1:16:08] moment
[1:16:12] with the path that i've taken in my life
[1:16:15] i have absolutely zero doubt that god is
[1:16:19] real
[1:16:21] that i'm a son of god and that his word
[1:16:23] is true not a doubt at all
[1:16:29] but then there's things that you go
[1:16:30] through and things you experience
[1:16:34] and you're not sure if you're you're
[1:16:36] you're going through them the right way
[1:16:39] and i came to a place in my life several
[1:16:41] years ago where
[1:16:43] and i remember it was when i was
[1:16:44] counseling with a young man who's going
[1:16:45] through very difficult
[1:16:46] problems and things in his life are just
[1:16:48] falling apart and i could really sense
[1:16:51] where he was at emotionally and
[1:16:55] and i i articulated this phrase to him
[1:16:57] and i'd never used it before publicly
[1:16:59] but it was the way i was feeling and i
[1:17:00] said i understand what you're going
[1:17:02] through
[1:17:03] i said i don't know if this is faith
[1:17:07] or if i've just become numb
[1:17:11] can you relate to that
[1:17:15] like this doesn't bother me anymore i'm
[1:17:17] not moved by this i'm not moved by that
[1:17:20] but you realize i'm not even feeling
[1:17:22] anymore
[1:17:25] is this is this faith or if i'm just
[1:17:28] becoming numb
[1:17:30] and i think for some of us we've
[1:17:31] probably tried to convince ourself that
[1:17:33] our numbness was faith
[1:17:36] but really what we've become is numb
[1:17:40] we've said it was faith well that just
[1:17:41] doesn't move me and i've gotten over
[1:17:42] this and i've gotten over that but know
[1:17:43] what you've really become
[1:17:45] is numb
[1:17:48] faith is a sense in itself faith is not
[1:17:52] a feeling like our
[1:17:53] traditional feelings of the mind and the
[1:17:55] body
[1:17:56] but faith is a sense in itself
[1:18:00] so give me some just let me use the
[1:18:02] saying that
[1:18:03] faith itself is a sense it's a sensation
[1:18:06] faith itself feels
[1:18:09] faith is not the absence of all other
[1:18:11] senses
[1:18:13] faith can feel when when and when
[1:18:16] imagination is very robust
[1:18:18] faith can feel even when your touch can
[1:18:21] is sensing things faith can have the
[1:18:23] ability you can see
[1:18:24] that you've got problems but faith can
[1:18:26] tell you there's a solution to that
[1:18:28] problem
[1:18:29] it's not when all the other senses no
[1:18:31] longer see taste feel smell or hear
[1:18:33] or all the other senses are dumbed down
[1:18:34] that somehow you're able to have faith
[1:18:36] faith is not the absence or the numbing
[1:18:38] of all of the senses faith is a sense in
[1:18:40] itself
[1:18:42] and there's a diagnosable condition that
[1:18:44] very few people experience but a
[1:18:45] cognitive insensitivity to pain
[1:18:48] is not faith
[1:18:51] in other words there's people who
[1:18:52] actually have a defect in their bodies
[1:18:54] where they cannot
[1:18:56] experience pain that doesn't mean
[1:18:57] they're like a superhero or they don't
[1:18:59] burn they just don't feel it when
[1:19:00] they're burning
[1:19:01] it doesn't mean they don't have bones
[1:19:03] that don't break or if they break they
[1:19:04] automatically heal
[1:19:05] they don't feel that it breaks so
[1:19:07] they're willing to jump off the stairs
[1:19:09] and they're willing to do very reckless
[1:19:10] things
[1:19:11] because they don't they haven't had a
[1:19:12] sense of pain
[1:19:14] but bones still break burns still happen
[1:19:17] i'm not talking about
[1:19:18] a superhero i'm talking about people who
[1:19:20] are in the natural are
[1:19:21] cognitively in their minds they're
[1:19:23] insensitive to pain
[1:19:24] but spiritual insensitivity to pain and
[1:19:27] to hurt is not
[1:19:28] faith to just become numb to offenses to
[1:19:31] become numb
[1:19:32] to things to become numb to this and to
[1:19:34] become numb to that that is not
[1:19:36] faith but listen what faith is it's
[1:19:38] faith that has courage
[1:19:40] to face that kind of pain
[1:19:43] faith is brave and it gives you courage
[1:19:45] to stand in the face of those things
[1:19:47] and call them what they are and allow
[1:19:49] god to deal with them and process them
[1:19:51] and get victorious over them it
[1:19:54] overwhelmed me and overwhelmed me so
[1:19:55] tremendously
[1:19:57] and i'll just say that
[1:20:00] and if god will help me and i think
[1:20:02] there's just different ways that you can
[1:20:04] say it
[1:20:06] that sometimes god brings us to a
[1:20:08] mountain
[1:20:10] and and we we come right up against
[1:20:12] another problem like i
[1:20:14] fought over that mountain i scaled that
[1:20:17] mountain
[1:20:18] i had to go to this before and we find
[1:20:20] ourselves standing right back at that
[1:20:22] mountain
[1:20:22] and god wants you at the base of that
[1:20:24] mountain not because you're gonna have
[1:20:26] to climb it again
[1:20:27] because he wants you to realize that now
[1:20:28] you've got faith to move it
[1:20:32] wanting you to realize i put you right
[1:20:33] back at the base of this mountain again
[1:20:36] not because i'm going to make you go
[1:20:37] through it again but because he wants
[1:20:39] you to dig
[1:20:39] down deep face the pain face the
[1:20:42] discouragement
[1:20:43] face the fear and this time by faith
[1:20:45] move it
[1:20:48] where there's no hopelessness and
[1:20:50] despondence if i got to climb this
[1:20:51] mountain again
[1:20:52] if i got to do this again i'm just going
[1:20:54] to quit i can't go through this again i
[1:20:55] don't want to have to do this i'm so
[1:20:57] weary i can't do it
[1:20:58] he's wanting you to face it
[1:21:01] because this time he wants to bring you
[1:21:02] through it by faith
[1:21:05] on a greater level
[1:21:10] i've got an end to the my notes there's
[1:21:13] there's an end to this i'm coming to it
[1:21:19] i want you to think about this scripture
[1:21:20] i didn't even put it on a slide because
[1:21:21] i wanted you to
[1:21:22] i wanted you to listen to it hebrews
[1:21:24] chapter 4 verse 15.
[1:21:26] are you with me this far i know i'm
[1:21:28] taking advantage of you and i apologize
[1:21:31] but listen to this scripture in a
[1:21:32] different light for we have not a high
[1:21:34] priest which cannot be touched
[1:21:37] with the feeling of our infirmities
[1:21:40] but was in all points tempted like as we
[1:21:42] are yet without sin
[1:21:44] you catch that
[1:21:48] in other words he can be touched
[1:21:51] with the feeling of our infirmities
[1:21:56] it's not that he's moved by the
[1:21:59] expression by you expressing your
[1:22:01] infirmities he's not moved by the
[1:22:03] knowledge of your infirmities he's not
[1:22:04] moved because
[1:22:05] oh god i'm sick and i'm hurting goes oh
[1:22:07] oh let me look at yes sick and hurting
[1:22:08] that's not good let me heal it
[1:22:10] he can be touched by the feeling
[1:22:14] catch that the feeling of your
[1:22:16] infirmities he's not he doesn't just
[1:22:18] hear you say i'm lonely
[1:22:19] he goes oh loneliness doesn't sound good
[1:22:21] he doesn't just hear you say i'm hurting
[1:22:23] i'm anxious i'm fearful
[1:22:24] this happens and that happens and he
[1:22:25] goes that doesn't sound good he can be
[1:22:27] touched
[1:22:27] listen he can be touched by the feeling
[1:22:30] of it
[1:22:32] in other words it's saying that christ
[1:22:34] knows how you
[1:22:36] feel
[1:22:38] his compassion is connected with his
[1:22:40] ability to empathize with your pain
[1:22:44] his compassion is connected with his
[1:22:47] ability
[1:22:47] not just to sympathize but to actually
[1:22:50] empathize
[1:22:51] with what you're feeling his compassion
[1:22:53] is connected to what you are feeling
[1:22:55] do you realize then just how much it
[1:22:57] hinders us if we become numb to our
[1:22:59] feeling
[1:23:00] and in our numbness we do not pour out
[1:23:01] to god and call out to god
[1:23:03] but then when we begin to feel it and we
[1:23:04] communicate it to god
[1:23:06] without fear of judgment without fear
[1:23:08] being stigmatized that god can say that
[1:23:10] moves me
[1:23:12] i know how you feel i don't look down
[1:23:15] upon you i don't think less of you as a
[1:23:16] daughter of god i don't think less of
[1:23:18] you as a son of god if that's what
[1:23:19] you're going
[1:23:20] through if that's how you feel i heal
[1:23:22] you too
[1:23:26] and i say this and i mean it with all my
[1:23:28] heart
[1:23:29] by faith we don't have to hide anymore
[1:23:36] by faith we don't need to become
[1:23:38] emotionally detached
[1:23:42] there's a lot of things we do when we do
[1:23:44] it for our own sanity
[1:23:46] and i i encourage people to do things to
[1:23:48] where if there's a trigger if there's
[1:23:49] something that gets
[1:23:50] it moves them there's something that
[1:23:51] happens that really hurts them and i say
[1:23:53] avoid it don't don't
[1:23:54] don't don't put yourself in that
[1:23:55] position but listen i believe that god
[1:23:57] wants to heal us so deeply
[1:23:59] that we can take every trigger and
[1:24:00] destroy it
[1:24:03] every trigger destroy it because we're
[1:24:06] not going to be a bride that's just
[1:24:07] huddled up in the corner completely
[1:24:09] ostracized and fearful and worried about
[1:24:10] all the layout to seeing triggers
[1:24:12] but we're going to be able to take all
[1:24:13] those and put them down put them down
[1:24:15] put them down put them down
[1:24:19] john chapter 4 again
[1:24:26] i i just want to i'm just going to skip
[1:24:30] through
[1:24:30] i don't even remember how much i put on
[1:24:32] that slide
[1:24:35] but she says when he begins to call out
[1:24:37] her husbands
[1:24:39] her perception is that he's a prophet
[1:24:42] and she starts talking about worshiping
[1:24:44] the true god
[1:24:45] and as he speaks she says i know that
[1:24:47] the messiah is coming
[1:24:50] in the what he says in verse 26 do i not
[1:24:53] have that in there bill john
[1:24:55] okay verse 26 what he says here i want
[1:24:57] you to realize
[1:24:58] i that speak unto thee am he
[1:25:02] he has said to her what he has not said
[1:25:04] to anyone else
[1:25:06] you realize that he just told the woman
[1:25:09] at the well that he was the christ
[1:25:11] and he was the messiah now go throughout
[1:25:13] his ministry and find how many other
[1:25:14] times he was boldly proclaiming this
[1:25:16] and telling this to people and speaking
[1:25:18] that plainly but now he says to her
[1:25:21] remember the one that had five husbands
[1:25:22] that was living with another guy that
[1:25:23] wasn't her husband
[1:25:25] the one he had this kind of sarcastic
[1:25:26] back and forth with this is the one to
[1:25:28] whom he said
[1:25:29] i am he
[1:25:38] and
[1:25:40] it says that she left her water pot in
[1:25:44] verse 28
[1:25:47] and her testimony
[1:25:51] come see a man
[1:25:54] not who said he was the messiah
[1:25:58] but come see a man who told me what i
[1:26:01] was
[1:26:03] come see a man that told me all the
[1:26:05] things
[1:26:06] that i ever did are you hearing what she
[1:26:10] said
[1:26:11] was she identified with christ had gone
[1:26:14] into her spirit
[1:26:15] christ had identified something that had
[1:26:18] even had been identifying her
[1:26:20] holding her back it was her bondage it
[1:26:22] was her greatest fear
[1:26:23] it was her greatest pain and she says
[1:26:25] running into the city
[1:26:26] come see a man who wasn't afraid to find
[1:26:29] my biggest fear
[1:26:31] come see a man that could get inside my
[1:26:33] subconscious
[1:26:34] and bring out what was really hurting me
[1:26:36] come see a man
[1:26:37] that can heal my deepest hurt this must
[1:26:40] be the messiah
[1:26:42] her testimony that he was the messiah
[1:26:44] was not based upon the fact that he
[1:26:45] always had a clever response to their
[1:26:47] banter about the well it was not based
[1:26:50] upon the fact that he said
[1:26:51] i am in the messiah she said this man is
[1:26:54] the messiah
[1:26:54] because he touched a spot deep within my
[1:26:57] heart that only the messiah could touch
[1:27:01] hallelujah come see a man
[1:27:04] who told me all things that ever i did
[1:27:10] in other words these were the things
[1:27:11] that had built the largest
[1:27:14] cannon in her mind and what she was
[1:27:17] identified with and who she was
[1:27:19] but something was so thoroughly broken
[1:27:21] that in that moment
[1:27:23] that she could face everybody that knew
[1:27:25] what she was
[1:27:27] and say come see a man who took care of
[1:27:30] it
[1:27:31] come see a man who wasn't afraid to talk
[1:27:33] about it all of you looked at me and you
[1:27:35] glared at me and you avoided me and i
[1:27:37] had to use the well at a time of day
[1:27:39] because i was stigmatized
[1:27:40] i was reproached and all of you cast me
[1:27:42] out but come see a man who wasn't afraid
[1:27:44] to talk about the things that mattered
[1:27:45] the most to me
[1:27:48] and in doing so set me free
[1:27:54] there's no hurt that he doesn't want to
[1:27:55] cover over
[1:28:01] there's no past that he wants you to
[1:28:03] still be haunted by
[1:28:04] are you listening to me
[1:28:09] he isn't afraid of your past
[1:28:13] god's not one of these he's not in a job
[1:28:15] interview and saying oh so
[1:28:16] i saw on your resume here that you know
[1:28:18] there's like five years here where you
[1:28:19] don't have anything you were doing
[1:28:20] oh i was in prison for carjacking uh
[1:28:24] we don't want you sorry yeah i know why
[1:28:26] you put that blank space there pro
[1:28:28] tip next time you interview just say you
[1:28:30] you know became a monk
[1:28:32] there's nothing in the resume that
[1:28:34] there's a blank spot where he he's going
[1:28:35] to hear your your
[1:28:36] your story and he's like well we need to
[1:28:38] think about this don't call us we'll
[1:28:39] call you
[1:28:40] he's not afraid of your past he
[1:28:43] permitted it
[1:28:46] right he allowed it to happen
[1:28:51] he's not afraid of your doubts
[1:28:55] he wants to so overwhelm you with his
[1:28:57] love that you could come to a place to
[1:28:58] say lord i believe but help heal my
[1:29:00] unbelief
[1:29:04] let me say this it may get really
[1:29:06] uncomfortable when god begins to wash
[1:29:08] away our numbness
[1:29:11] it may get real uncomfortable when god
[1:29:13] begins to open our eyes and we begin to
[1:29:14] experience and feel things that we
[1:29:16] hadn't felt in a while
[1:29:19] but he does it with tender hands
[1:29:24] and he does it because he wants us to
[1:29:25] experience him
[1:29:28] and if you've got a hard part in your
[1:29:30] heart it's a part he can't dwell in
[1:29:34] you've got a callous if you've got a
[1:29:35] wound it's a place if you become numb
[1:29:37] then you can't feel him there and you
[1:29:38] know what god wants
[1:29:39] he wants to fill every fiber of your
[1:29:41] being
[1:29:43] and he'll do it
[1:29:47] he just begins to uncover and expose
[1:29:51] and he does it so that not only can we
[1:29:52] experience him but we can experience
[1:29:54] pure joy
[1:29:58] if the musicians would come whether
[1:30:04] micah or brother loyal they could come
[1:30:10] have you ever felt i don't know if this
[1:30:11] is faith or or if i'm just numb
[1:30:19] god doesn't want us to be numb
[1:30:29] in psalm 51 verse 12 after david had
[1:30:32] sinned
[1:30:36] it's a statement that's very familiar to
[1:30:37] us
[1:30:40] i think it'll be a good turning point to
[1:30:43] continue
[1:30:44] and just to seal off these things
[1:30:46] tonight
[1:30:48] he's crying out as he's asked god
[1:30:54] change his heart and
[1:30:58] touch him and to heal him he says
[1:31:00] restore unto me
[1:31:02] the joy of thy salvation
[1:31:06] he says uphold me with thy free spirit
[1:31:08] let a willing spirit uphold me renew
[1:31:10] a right spirit in me he's saying let it
[1:31:13] not be bound anymore
[1:31:16] he's saying let me feel again
[1:31:20] let me feel again lord
[1:31:25] i remember when i was this is i'm just
[1:31:27] articulating as a david now
[1:31:30] in my youth i experienced a lot of pain
[1:31:33] i experienced a lot of suffering but my
[1:31:36] highs were so much higher lord
[1:31:38] [Music]
[1:31:40] all the joys i experienced
[1:31:42] counterbalanced all the sufferings and
[1:31:43] the pains and the persecutions and the
[1:31:45] disappointments
[1:31:48] the lord somehow along the way i i got
[1:31:51] discouraged in a way to protect myself
[1:31:53] against all the pain i
[1:31:54] began to experience your joy much less
[1:31:56] and now i find myself
[1:31:58] just numb to it all and lord i don't
[1:32:02] even feel
[1:32:04] anymore and he's asking god to help him
[1:32:08] feel again
[1:32:10] is there anyone here tonight that says
[1:32:12] lord
[1:32:14] i just want to feel again
[1:32:17] i want it i want it to have feeling in
[1:32:19] it you remember how brother branham told
[1:32:21] the story about the man
[1:32:22] and the wife who had that little tiff
[1:32:23] and they argued gave her a kiss and he
[1:32:26] began to leave and he was walking down
[1:32:28] the way
[1:32:29] all of a sudden what was it emotion
[1:32:31] pricked him
[1:32:32] and he said i could never live with
[1:32:34] myself if i don't get this
[1:32:35] if i never saw her again and that's how
[1:32:37] things ended so he rushed back in and he
[1:32:39] didn't do anything different than what
[1:32:41] he had done before
[1:32:43] he kissed her and left didn't say
[1:32:45] anything he kissed her
[1:32:47] and left but everything changed
[1:32:50] you remember why it changed that time
[1:32:54] it had feeling in it
[1:32:58] and we're doing the right things
[1:32:59] believers
[1:33:01] you're doing the right things but maybe
[1:33:04] just what it's lacking is feeling
[1:33:08] he said lord this time next time
[1:33:11] for the rest of the times i want the
[1:33:14] feeling back
[1:33:17] he said restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:33:20] salvation
[1:33:22] his joy had been taken by sin his joy
[1:33:25] had been taken by guilt
[1:33:28] david if we cannot relate to the sins of
[1:33:30] murder and adulterer if he cannot relate
[1:33:32] even as a
[1:33:33] we're not backslidden in this condition
[1:33:35] we could say that we could relate and
[1:33:36] that david had lost his peace of mind
[1:33:39] and he said lord heal my joy and give it
[1:33:42] back to me
[1:33:44] i believe tonight you can have it
[1:33:47] i believe it's yours but to heal
[1:33:52] you're going to have to feel
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:55] are you willing to face it
[1:33:57] [Music]
[1:33:58] courageously because i know i'm coming
[1:34:02] before one who can be touched
[1:34:04] not by the fact that i have infirmities
[1:34:07] but by the feeling
[1:34:08] of my infirmities i invite you to stand
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:14] restore unto me the joy
[1:34:18] of thy salvation
[1:34:22] this isn't a synthetic happiness
[1:34:24] [Music]
[1:34:25] this isn't a cognitive dissonance
[1:34:30] this is a son or daughter of god that
[1:34:32] knows
[1:34:34] that at one time i was happy one time i
[1:34:36] was free
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:38] one time everything felt so right but
[1:34:40] now
[1:34:42] i'm numb with heads bowed
[1:34:47] tonight you'd say lord i just want to
[1:34:49] feel your presence
[1:34:53] and maybe this is where the honesty
[1:34:55] comes in
[1:34:57] you say lord even if it means i've got
[1:34:59] to face pain
[1:35:01] even if it means i have to begin to
[1:35:03] experience
[1:35:04] discomfort i'm so hungry for your
[1:35:07] presence lord i'm so hungry for real joy
[1:35:11] that i'm now willing to feel again
[1:35:15] hands are raised all over
[1:35:18] in order to heal you're going to have to
[1:35:20] feel
[1:35:22] and i'm not asking us to lean into a
[1:35:24] difficult situation i'm not asking us to
[1:35:26] go and embrace our accusers or to
[1:35:29] restore relationships with our abusers
[1:35:31] but i'm talking about
[1:35:32] facing the pain tonight but this time
[1:35:36] with christ
[1:35:38] but this time as a woman at the well
[1:35:42] and he's the one that brings it up
[1:35:45] and he does it because he loves you not
[1:35:47] because he wants to shame you or hurt
[1:35:48] you he does it because he wants to heal
[1:35:50] you and say lord here i am in your
[1:35:51] presence
[1:35:53] heal my unbelief lord i want to feel
[1:35:56] again i've become so
[1:35:58] numb i'm unmoved i'm not sympathetic
[1:36:01] towards anyone lord i'm i'm insensitive
[1:36:04] to the
[1:36:04] feeling of others lord i'm not even
[1:36:06] moved in service i don't get the thrill
[1:36:08] out of church the word doesn't have the
[1:36:10] effect upon me as i get used to lord i
[1:36:12] remember a time when it seemed like i
[1:36:14] had so much zeal and so much passion and
[1:36:16] so much joy and
[1:36:18] life and year after year and wave after
[1:36:21] wave seems to beat upon the shore of my
[1:36:23] joy and now it seems
[1:36:24] stripped bare and the waves don't even
[1:36:28] come anymore and things are just
[1:36:29] placid and still and stagnant
[1:36:33] you say lord if you bring the joy i'm
[1:36:36] willing to stand the waves
[1:36:37] [Music]
[1:36:39] i just want to feel again lord
[1:36:42] and you're willing to admit tonight that
[1:36:44] you've been numb i believe god can come
[1:36:46] and touch you and heal you
[1:36:49] let's pray for one another our gracious
[1:36:50] heavenly father
[1:36:52] lord i believe that tonight many have
[1:36:56] become
[1:36:56] uncomfortably numb
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:37:00] in other words lord you by the preaching
[1:37:02] of the word have made them conscious to
[1:37:04] a spiritual numbness that has plagued
[1:37:06] them
[1:37:08] and while we have tried to use
[1:37:12] your word like google or webmd and
[1:37:14] diagnosed and diagnosed and try to
[1:37:16] figure out things are wrong tonight
[1:37:18] you've come to the heart of the matter
[1:37:21] and said before i can deal with you
[1:37:23] you're going to have to start feeling
[1:37:24] again
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:28] and lord i pray that we could trust
[1:37:31] ourselves to the tender hand of jehovah
[1:37:35] we can trust ourselves into your care
[1:37:38] lord i do not i have not father in my
[1:37:40] heart i trusted
[1:37:42] if the people know i have not chastised
[1:37:46] them i have not corrected them i have
[1:37:48] not in my heart
[1:37:49] in any way intended a negative
[1:37:53] pronouncement or judgment but lord i
[1:37:55] spoke as one who's
[1:37:57] paid the price for this sermon
[1:38:00] that they might know there's a place of
[1:38:02] rest
[1:38:04] and there's a safe place in you
[1:38:07] and that it's not a pastor it's not a
[1:38:10] man it's not a teacher it's not a
[1:38:11] prophet that stands over them
[1:38:13] telling them where they must flee or
[1:38:15] what they must do or how they must live
[1:38:17] or how they must act but you christ
[1:38:18] stand before them they
[1:38:20] the woman at the well you revealing
[1:38:22] yourself as christ
[1:38:23] them being exposed lord and laid bare
[1:38:26] you
[1:38:26] as the mother eagle
[1:38:31] fluttering over them stirring their nest
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:36] you is the one who in pressure
[1:38:38] impressing them tonight you as in the
[1:38:40] one
[1:38:41] who tonight have caused people to feel
[1:38:44] who haven't
[1:38:44] felt in so long
[1:38:48] lord i know that we can gather in
[1:38:50] meetings and
[1:38:51] shout and dance and we can weep and we
[1:38:54] can cry
[1:38:55] but tonight there are those who have
[1:38:58] felt
[1:38:58] tonight in ways they have not felt in a
[1:39:01] long time
[1:39:03] and lord it must be you that would
[1:39:05] ordain
[1:39:06] 6 30 on may 16 2021
[1:39:10] to place people in your presence tonight
[1:39:12] together
[1:39:13] who otherwise would have never even met
[1:39:16] but tonight
[1:39:17] you have intended for them to be at this
[1:39:19] well at this time
[1:39:21] to touch their greatest fears and their
[1:39:23] greatest hurts
[1:39:24] to bring it up to expose it to cut into
[1:39:28] that flesh
[1:39:28] to identify the thorn and say i can use
[1:39:31] this
[1:39:34] i pray that you would heal
[1:39:39] heal tonight
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:45] may your sons and may your daughters
[1:39:50] right now in the divine presence of the
[1:39:52] lord jesus christ
[1:39:55] take you at your word and receive you
[1:39:58] for what they have need of
[1:40:00] and may we even be able to be honest to
[1:40:03] the point to where if it be with tears
[1:40:05] that we cry out lord i believe
[1:40:08] heal my unbelief may it be done in the
[1:40:12] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:40:15] set your people free help them to feel
[1:40:18] again i pray lord
[1:40:20] not a synthetic feeling not an emotion
[1:40:22] not a built up worked up thing but
[1:40:24] something from you
[1:40:28] that we might be healed lord i ask it in
[1:40:31] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:40:34] amen amen
