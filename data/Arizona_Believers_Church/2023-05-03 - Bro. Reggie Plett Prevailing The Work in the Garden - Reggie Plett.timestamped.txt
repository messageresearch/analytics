[0:01] bottles. I uh I've been so enjoying um
[0:06] the services about perfect faith and
[0:10] perfect love and how that brother Aaron
[0:13] has been um structuring them with the
[0:16] thought of a perfecting faith and
[0:19] perfecting love.
[0:21] And
[0:23] this I feel like this subject goes goes
[0:26] right along with it.
[0:29] And I I uh
[0:34] when brother Brandham makes the
[0:36] statement about we as believers have
[0:39] inherited
[0:41] an arcade and how that we we should have
[0:44] the freedom then to go through that
[0:46] arcade to climb up on the ladder and
[0:48] look through every shelf and see what
[0:52] we've inherited. Right. Amen.
[0:55] I I I I I feel like that's what we're
[0:58] doing when we're looking at this love
[1:00] that's perfecting us, that this faith
[1:02] that's perfecting us. We're beginning to
[1:05] look behind nooks and crannies and see
[1:09] uh God uh perfecting us in so many
[1:13] different ways in so many areas of our
[1:15] lives. And I I just feel like why why
[1:19] haven't we explored this before? But at
[1:22] the same time that that question may
[1:25] sound negative. Why haven't we explored
[1:27] this before? But the good news is is
[1:30] that there's so much of God to explore.
[1:33] And that when we begin to realize how
[1:35] much we've inherited, then we can we we
[1:38] get excited about, oh God, there's more
[1:42] of you for me.
[1:45] There's more perfecting for me.
[1:48] And
[1:50] and I just I I feel like that's what
[1:53] tonight as believers,
[1:56] those that have that know that that what
[1:59] it is to to receive that baptism of the
[2:02] Holy Spirit, that we're not questioning
[2:04] uh our salvation. Uh we we we say, "Man,
[2:08] I'm I'm secure. I know where I'm at with
[2:10] my salvation. I'd like to know where can
[2:13] I go
[2:15] in the word?"
[2:16] Yes, sir. Good.
[2:18] Uh I feel like we have such a liberty,
[2:21] we have such a freedom then to explore
[2:23] the word of God to explore this message
[2:26] of the hour of this hour to see uh not
[2:31] so much what what we've come from or
[2:33] what what's ahead of us but but what
[2:36] what's what does God have for us right
[2:39] now. Amen.
[2:41] So tonight uh I'd like uh for a title I
[2:46] call it prevailing the work in the
[2:49] garden.
[2:51] And this prevailing part as we read here
[2:54] in Revelations chapter 5 and verse 5,
[2:59] the message that John receives here is
[3:04] weep not behold the lion of the tribe of
[3:06] Judah, the root of David hath prevailed
[3:11] to open the book. So he's already
[3:13] prevailed.
[3:17] And there's a quote that I'm going to
[3:19] read and and it'll be it it's it's the
[3:22] climax.
[3:24] It it's the it's the pinnacle of this
[3:26] thing and we're going to hit it right
[3:28] away. And then you're going to think,
[3:30] well, is that the end of the service?
[3:31] You know, do you you use the climax? But
[3:33] I'm putting the climax at the beginning
[3:35] so that then we can begin to unpack and
[3:37] we can begin to search through the
[3:39] arcade and see what what this means for
[3:45] us today.
[3:49] Now, I we're in that season. We're in
[3:51] that spring season
[3:54] where we begin to plant gardens.
[3:58] And I don't know how many of you have
[4:01] planted a garden or have worked in a
[4:02] garden. I've worked in a garden from the
[4:04] time I was a little boy. My mom always
[4:06] planted a garden.
[4:10] And there's so much work
[4:13] to planting a garden. It's not just go
[4:16] and open the packet of seeds and stick
[4:19] them down in the soil and and then water
[4:21] it every day. Before you do any of that,
[4:24] you've got to cultivate the earth.
[4:25] You've got to remove the big rocks that
[4:28] have surfaced through the freeze and the
[4:29] thaw of the winter. And it seems like
[4:32] every year you thought you got all the
[4:33] rocks out and every year more it's like
[4:35] like you're growing rocks,
[4:38] but they they they pop up and you got to
[4:40] get those rocks out of the way and then
[4:42] you've got to create your furrows and
[4:44] your rows to begin to to plant your
[4:47] seed. And then once you've planted the
[4:49] seed, you think uh as you start seeing
[4:52] little shoots shoot up from the earth,
[4:56] you think, "Oh, wow. It's already here.
[4:58] Like I can't believe it's already
[4:59] germinated." and and then you realize
[5:02] that's not my that's not what I planted.
[5:04] Those are weeds.
[5:06] So then you got to go through and you
[5:08] got to start weeding before you get to
[5:11] your plants. And and then once your
[5:13] plants do start growing and you get
[5:14] excited about the little leaves that pop
[5:16] up, you got to you got to thin them out
[5:19] because maybe you you you planted them
[5:21] too close together and and so you got to
[5:23] thin out your plants and again you've
[5:25] got to pull weeds and you constantly are
[5:27] pulling weeds. That's one that's always
[5:29] there. And there's just a lot of work
[5:31] that goes into a garden.
[5:37] And in our scriptures, in in the Bible,
[5:42] there's many references to a garden.
[5:46] And I'm going to take a few of them
[5:49] tonight.
[5:50] And I don't think it's necessarily by I
[5:53] I don't think it's by coincidence um
[5:57] these events that take place, but I'd
[6:00] like to to read a few scriptures
[6:03] discussing about
[6:06] uh a work that took place in the garden.
[6:08] Of course, we're going to start in
[6:10] Genesis
[6:11] chapter 3. I want to read verses 4-7.
[6:16] This is the serpent coming to Eve. And
[6:18] the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye
[6:22] shall not surely die. For God doth know
[6:26] that in the day ye eat thereof, then
[6:29] your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall
[6:33] be as gods, knowing good and evil." And
[6:37] when the woman saw that the tree was
[6:39] good for food, and that it was pleasant
[6:41] to the eyes, and a tree to be desired,
[6:45] to make one wise, she took of the fruit
[6:48] thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
[6:51] her husband with her, and he did eat.
[6:55] And the eyes of them both were opened.
[6:58] And they knew that they were naked, and
[7:01] they sewed fig leaves together, and made
[7:04] themselves aprons.
[7:09] So we see in Genesis we see the work
[7:12] that God did in the garden and it was
[7:16] good and it was good and it was good and
[7:18] it was very good.
[7:21] But now we see a work that the enemy is
[7:23] doing in the garden
[7:25] and he begins to to work also and not we
[7:30] we would understand and agree that he's
[7:32] sowing discord and he's sowing doubt.
[7:35] He's uh
[7:39] sowing I guess a a type of of knowledge
[7:43] not wisdom but knowledge
[7:46] and we see here when we read these
[7:49] scriptures that
[7:51] what's happening here
[7:54] uh is an awakening to the conscience.
[7:58] So when it says that uh the serpent said
[8:03] uh God doth know that in the day eat
[8:05] thereof then your eyes shall be opened.
[8:11] I think it's fairly evident to those who
[8:13] would read the Bible that their eyes
[8:16] weren't sealed shut and then right then
[8:19] suddenly eyelids were formed and their
[8:22] eyes were opened. We see that this means
[8:25] something different than their literal
[8:27] eyes coming open. This is an awakening
[8:31] of the conscience, knowing good from
[8:33] evil.
[8:35] And and sure enough, it says that she
[8:38] took and she ate and she gave also to
[8:41] her husband and he ate. And then it
[8:43] says, "And the eyes of them both were
[8:45] opened." So now this we see this
[8:48] awakening of a conscience. Now I
[8:53] I looked up the word conscience and
[8:57] conscience it says through Webster the
[8:59] sense of consciousness of the moral
[9:02] goodness or blameworthiness of one's own
[9:05] conduct, intentions or character
[9:08] together with a feeling of obligation to
[9:10] do right or be good.
[9:13] And we would say, "Yeah, that that that
[9:15] fits."
[9:17] And then there's another word that's
[9:19] conscious. And we realize that conscious
[9:23] is just merely uh being awake. Uh having
[9:27] mental faculties not doled by sleep,
[9:30] faintness or stuper awake.
[9:34] But there's another word that is
[9:37] self-conscious.
[9:40] And self-conscious is closer related to
[9:43] conscience
[9:45] than conscious.
[9:48] And to be self-conscious,
[9:51] we we would all say, "Wow, that guy's
[9:54] self-conscious. They're really
[9:55] self-conscious." It's not like, "Hey,
[9:57] wow, you know, that person's really
[9:59] self-conscious."
[10:01] We usually are like, "Wow, you're being
[10:03] so you're so self-conscious." Or, "Man,
[10:05] I'm I'm very self-conscious."
[10:08] It's usually a negative connotation that
[10:11] we use with self-conscious.
[10:12] Self-conscious is feeling undue
[10:15] awareness of oneself, one's appearance
[10:17] or one's actions.
[10:21] And we realize that with the awakening
[10:25] of the conscience in the garden,
[10:30] self-consciousness comes with it.
[10:34] that we find Adam and Eve hiding and
[10:38] covering themselves because of the
[10:41] awareness
[10:43] of their nakedness.
[10:52] So I want to turn over in Luke chapter
[10:55] 22 to another incident in a garden.
[11:00] This is when Jesus is in the garden of
[11:02] Gethsemane.
[11:05] In verse 41-44,
[11:07] it says, "And he was withdrawn from them
[11:09] about a stones cast." This is Peter,
[11:11] James, and John. And he kneel down and
[11:14] prayed, saying, Father, if thou be
[11:18] willing, remove this cup from me.
[11:23] Nevertheless,
[11:26] not my will, but thine be done.
[11:30] And there appeared an angel unto him
[11:32] from heaven, strengthening him. And
[11:35] being in an agony, he prayed more
[11:37] earnestly, and his sweat was as it were
[11:41] great drops of blood falling down to the
[11:44] ground.
[11:47] Now,
[11:49] here's another work that's happening in
[11:51] the garden.
[11:54] And this is
[11:56] as we're going to read
[11:59] uh a a statement that brother Brandham
[12:01] makes.
[12:06] God is in agony. God is wrestling.
[12:09] Jesus is wrestling here with something
[12:14] to the point to where he's asking,
[12:16] "Lord, is there any way? Is there any
[12:18] other way
[12:21] that your will could be accomplished
[12:23] besides me giving my life?
[12:26] Is there another way, Lord? Is there a
[12:29] way that I wouldn't have to drink from
[12:31] this bitter cup?
[12:36] And he and and we notice that he prays
[12:39] and he goes he goes to his disciples and
[12:41] they're sleeping and he asks them,
[12:43] "Could you not stay awake and pray with
[12:45] me just for an hour?" and he he goes
[12:47] back and he begins to pray again
[12:51] and he goes and he
[12:54] finds him sleeping. He goes and he prays
[12:55] again
[12:57] and he's it's this wrestling. He's doing
[13:00] this wrestling. There's this there's
[13:02] this urgency that that Jesus is
[13:05] wrestling with in the garden. There's
[13:08] something that's taking place there in
[13:10] the garden. And I want to read this.
[13:12] This is from uh the breach between the
[13:15] seven church ages and the seven seals.
[13:18] Brother Brandham is is ex is expounding
[13:22] on this revelations 5:5 which we read in
[13:25] our opening.
[13:27] Brother Brandham says don't be
[13:28] brokenhearted John don't weep for the
[13:31] lion of the tribe of Judah the root and
[13:34] offspring of David has prevailed.
[13:37] Prevail means wrestle with and overcome.
[13:42] I love that definition.
[13:44] Prevail means wrestle with and overcome.
[13:49] Oh my. The garden of Gethsemane when
[13:53] blood dropped down out of his face, he
[13:56] was overcoming. See, see the lion and
[14:01] the root of David has prevailed. Has
[14:06] overcome
[14:08] like Jacob. Okay. So now he switches and
[14:11] he's but he's giving us this image of
[14:13] wrestling with and overcoming. So he
[14:16] says like Jacob being suppler and when
[14:19] he got in contact with the angel he held
[14:22] on and the angel tried to pull away. He
[14:25] said I I'm just not going to let you go.
[14:28] He held on until he got what he wanted
[14:30] for and his name was changed from
[14:32] supplanter which means deceiver to what?
[14:35] To a prince with God Israel. He
[14:39] prevailed.
[14:44] Now, I'm gonna stop right there because
[14:46] we're going to get into the story of
[14:48] Jacob here in a little bit, but just I
[14:53] don't know how how how much you ponder,
[14:55] I guess, is the word. Uh,
[14:59] the story of Jacob wrestling with God
[15:01] and Jacob winning.
[15:07] I mean, really pretty ridiculous.
[15:12] You're going to wrestle with God and and
[15:13] and God's going to lose.
[15:19] But there's something there that God
[15:20] wants us wants for us to see. He
[15:23] wouldn't have put it in his word if he
[15:24] didn't want us to see that.
[15:26] But let's go on. And this lion of the
[15:28] tribe of Judah prevailed. He said,
[15:30] "Don't weep, John, for the lion of the
[15:31] tribe of Judah, the root of David, has
[15:33] prevailed. He has already overcome. He
[15:38] has done it. It's over, John. Oh my." He
[15:42] produced a bleach that sends sin along
[15:44] back to the greasy hands that with his
[15:47] wisdom that defiled it, the human being.
[15:50] Yes. So, brother Brandham is is is
[15:53] saying here, he's he's looking at this
[15:55] this scripture in Revelations 5 that
[15:57] says that this lion of the tribe of
[15:59] Judah has prevailed. He's already
[16:02] prevailed.
[16:03] He already wrestled with God and won.
[16:13] So, we see this wrestling that Jesus is
[16:16] doing in the garden. And you think, what
[16:19] is he prevailed over? What is it that he
[16:22] that that he was prevailing?
[16:24] What what what was he wrestling with?
[16:28] And and when we look and we see that
[16:30] that the wrestling that Jesus was doing
[16:33] was for you and me,
[16:35] that the wrestling was for was for our
[16:38] condition, was for was for fallen man.
[16:42] and and and and man, you could really go
[16:44] into this how that Jesus came as as son
[16:48] of man not through uh not through
[16:50] blowing through dust like that, but he
[16:53] came the way sinful men came.
[16:56] He came that same way so that he could
[16:58] experience temptation. So he could know
[17:01] what fallen man experienced
[17:04] obviously without falling, without
[17:06] sinning, but tempted in every manner.
[17:12] But I look at what happened in in in the
[17:15] Garden of Eden. And I look at at at
[17:20] this wrestling match that took place
[17:22] between the serpent and the woman and
[17:26] this this mental wrestling match that he
[17:29] had and and he just threw in that you'll
[17:33] not surely die.
[17:35] And he threw that in there and and
[17:37] you'll become wise. you'll become like
[17:38] gods and knowing right from wrong. And
[17:44] and and she saw this wisdom. She saw
[17:46] this he he he he began to to to deceive
[17:49] her and show her uh that there's a
[17:52] benefit to this. And then as soon as as
[17:55] this fall took place, as soon as her and
[17:57] Adam uh in took took part of this
[18:01] doubting God's word, along came
[18:05] doubt, along came fear. Along came
[18:08] self-consciousness
[18:10] of what have I done? and uh what you
[18:13] know we're wrong and and and then the
[18:16] fear of what's going to happen and let's
[18:18] hide
[18:19] and and then you know along you you
[18:22] start thinking about what feelings came
[18:24] along with the fall
[18:26] guilt and shame and and jealousy and and
[18:30] and hatred and anger suddenly and it's
[18:34] like where is all of this welling up
[18:36] from? And it's this this wrestling match
[18:39] that took place and man begins losing.
[18:48] But when we see Jesus in the garden and
[18:50] he's wrestling with God, we see this
[18:54] lamb that's wrestling this lion of the
[18:56] tribe of Judah wrestling with God.
[19:01] When I read this, I get I just got so
[19:03] excited BECAUSE I THOUGHT, GOD, NOT only
[19:05] did you take care of the sin question,
[19:08] not not only did you take care of the
[19:10] the guilt question where we don't have
[19:12] to feel guilty anymore, but I thought
[19:16] even our conscience
[19:19] can become new.
[19:21] that that that that with the awakening
[19:23] of the conscience that happened there in
[19:25] the garden. It was this consciousness of
[19:28] knowing right from wrong and then
[19:30] suddenly the pointing of you're wrong.
[19:33] Well, you're wrong and you're wrong.
[19:37] And so when I see that Jesus is
[19:39] wrestling in the garden and he prevails,
[19:43] he wins. And that that's where the
[19:45] winning took place was in the garden.
[19:48] that that's where the overcoming took
[19:50] place for Jesus was in the garden where
[19:53] that's where HE WRESTLED WITH GOD.
[19:55] THAT'S WHERE HE was wrestling to the
[19:57] point that his sweat was like blood so
[19:59] that he could go to the cross and say,
[20:01] "It's finished.
[20:03] It's finished. I've I've already
[20:06] finished THIS THIS JOB. I'VE ALREADY
[20:09] WRESTLED with this and won the battle."
[20:11] Amen.
[20:12] And when I begin to look at this idea of
[20:16] of our conscience just just waking up in
[20:20] the morning, just us being human beings
[20:23] and us saying, uh, you know,
[20:28] look at the condition I'm in and and and
[20:30] and why can't I why do I feel like I I
[20:34] just can't measure up and I just can't
[20:36] measure up and when when am I going to
[20:38] measure up TO WHAT I OUGHT TO BE?
[20:42] Brother Brandham gives us a a a picture
[20:46] into uh
[20:51] the contacting God and he starts and he
[20:55] draws three rings
[20:59] and he says your your outside man has
[21:03] five senses.
[21:06] There's five gates for us to contact
[21:09] this outside physical world. See, taste,
[21:12] feel, smell, and hear. We all say,
[21:14] "Yeah, we got that." He said, "But your
[21:17] spirit man, there's five gates to
[21:20] contact that man, and that's conscience,
[21:24] affection, reason, memory, and
[21:26] imagination."
[21:29] And then he said, "Then there's the
[21:30] soul, and it's only got one gate, and
[21:32] that's self-will.
[21:34] But there's two things that that that
[21:36] can affect that and that's faith or
[21:38] doubt.
[21:40] Only one of those can go in at a time.
[21:42] And sometimes unfortunately it's doubt.
[21:46] Doubt goes in and then from there once
[21:48] doubt goes in then it begins affecting
[21:51] everything on the way out. It affects
[21:54] your conscience, affection, reason,
[21:55] memory, imagination
[21:57] because of you. You begin doubting. But
[22:00] then it starts affecting the way you
[22:02] see, taste, feel, smell, and hear things
[22:04] as well.
[22:06] And it's all because of, you know, this
[22:08] input that's coming in in through those
[22:10] gates. So you hear something, you hear a
[22:12] rumor, you hear a whisper, you hear a
[22:14] lie. And it begins affecting now. It
[22:17] goes into your conscience, affection,
[22:19] reason, memory, and imagination. And you
[22:21] begin imagining things, you know, that
[22:23] this person is like and you begin
[22:26] remembering, you know, that the way that
[22:28] brother did you wrong in the past. And
[22:30] so, yeah, this lines up. And so suddenly
[22:33] your faith, you have no faith in that
[22:35] person because it's already been
[22:37] affected by all these other elements.
[22:40] And so then it begins working its way
[22:42] out so that when you see them and
[22:44] they're like, "Hey." and you're like you
[22:45] don't you know in the grocery stores
[22:47] you're ducking your head and get to the
[22:49] next aisle
[22:52] and it's like why
[22:53] that's no way to live.
[22:55] Amen.
[22:56] That's no way. We don't want to live
[22:57] that way and we don't have to.
[23:00] So when I saw that this prevailing in
[23:05] the garden, when I saw the work that
[23:08] happened in the garden of Gethsemane
[23:10] that Jesus did and I realized that one
[23:14] of the things that he had prevailed over
[23:16] right there in the garden was conscience
[23:20] was our conscience. And that with that
[23:24] conscience and andor self-consciousness
[23:27] that we feel we don't have to we don't
[23:31] have to.
[23:34] He made a way. He bridged a gap that we
[23:37] don't have to do that.
[23:40] This is where there's there is a
[23:41] perfecting love. There's a perfecting
[23:44] faith that can carry you through beyond
[23:46] that.
[23:48] And it and it and it and it and you get
[23:50] through it and you know you think you
[23:52] know can I take that step and and then
[23:54] you do and you're like was this a
[23:56] one-time deal and it's like no God made
[24:00] a way it's paved with bloody footprints
[24:04] that you can come you can come this way
[24:06] often.
[24:08] And so I thought, now this would be
[24:11] great for uh some preacher that was
[24:15] really good at preaching series,
[24:18] but I was just looking at the
[24:20] conscience. And and along with it,
[24:25] there's this scripture in Romans 9:1
[24:28] and Paul says, "I say the truth in
[24:30] Christ, I lie not. My conscience also
[24:34] bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.
[24:38] Now, that's an interesting statement
[24:39] because you may just say if Paul's just
[24:42] saying, "Look, I'm not lying. God's my
[24:44] witness. I'm telling you the truth
[24:46] here." But that's not what he's saying
[24:48] at all. He He could have just said, "I
[24:50] say the truth in Christ. I lie not. My
[24:53] conscience bearing me witness." But he
[24:55] says, "My conscience also bearing me
[24:58] witness in the Holy Ghost."
[25:04] we see that there's there's this
[25:07] conscience in the Holy Ghost.
[25:12] And I thought that's so beautiful
[25:16] that with the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[25:20] we have access to a new conscience,
[25:24] to a new way of thinking,
[25:27] to a new that that that that we can look
[25:31] through Christ. We can look to to
[25:33] Christ. We can look through what he
[25:36] prevailed over. And when he promised he
[25:39] would send back his spirit and he would
[25:41] be in us,
[25:43] then he's given us access to a new
[25:46] conscience.
[25:48] Well, then I began to think, well, if we
[25:51] have a new have access or the
[25:54] opportunity anyway for a new conscience,
[25:58] what about a new affection? What about
[26:00] new reasoning?
[26:02] What about new memories?
[26:04] What about new imaginations? Now that
[26:06] part I say for whoever can preach a
[26:08] series type service because it would be
[26:11] tremendous.
[26:14] But but this is the thing is then if if
[26:18] it'll affect your conscience, your
[26:20] affection, your reason, your memory and
[26:21] your imagination.
[26:25] Well, you still have your see, taste,
[26:27] feel, smell, and hear. And we hear
[26:30] brother Brandham saying all the time, if
[26:31] those five senses don't line up with the
[26:34] word, leave those alone.
[26:36] What you see, taste, feel, smell, or
[26:38] hear, if those don't line up, leave them
[26:41] alone and stick with what the word says.
[26:44] Well, the same goes with our conscience,
[26:47] affection, reason, memory, and
[26:48] imagination. If your imaginations don't
[26:50] line up with the word of God, leave them
[26:52] alone. But if they do
[26:56] line up, if what you see, taste, feel,
[26:58] smell, or hear lines up with the word,
[27:01] use it.
[27:02] Go further in the word.
[27:04] If your conscience, affection, reason,
[27:07] memory, and imagination lines up with
[27:09] the word,
[27:11] use it.
[27:13] Let that
[27:15] feed your faith to go into the
[27:18] self-willgate.
[27:19] So that we it's faith that's causing our
[27:23] by self-will. We say I'm going to live
[27:25] by faith not doubt. I'm going to believe
[27:28] God for this.
[27:31] And the question is is it possible?
[27:34] It is possible. This is what the work in
[27:37] the garden was doing. Now I'm
[27:43] I want to look at this because at this
[27:46] wrestling this prevailing wrestling with
[27:48] and overcoming brother said to prevail
[27:50] is to wrestle with and overcome.
[27:54] The scripture
[27:56] is full
[27:59] full of examples of men and women
[28:03] wrestling with God and prevailing.
[28:08] And it's not just full so that we can
[28:10] say, "Wow, they're they were somebody,
[28:14] but it shows us what did they wrestle
[28:16] with?" And and in the overcoming, what
[28:21] came with the overcoming? What was what
[28:24] was the prize? What what happened?
[28:28] So, brother Brandon mentioned in that
[28:30] quote that we read, Jacob. So, I'd like
[28:33] to look at the story of Jacob. If you go
[28:36] and you read Abraham, you'll find
[28:38] wrestling there, too. You find Abraham
[28:39] wrestling one night. Uh he God tells him
[28:44] to to create a sacrifice and he shoes
[28:46] the birds off the sacrifice all night
[28:48] long. And it's all in this e it's all in
[28:51] this evening time that this is
[28:52] happening. He's sheing this the birds
[28:54] off his sacrifice. and he falls asleep
[28:56] and he sees this burning furnace, this
[28:59] this smoky furnace and then this light
[29:01] that comes between and brother Brandham
[29:03] explains to us that that shows us where
[29:06] we ought to go when we die that Abraham
[29:09] falls asleep and he says that's that's
[29:11] like man dying and when he when you die
[29:15] where ought you to go into that smoky
[29:17] furnace into a into hell that's where
[29:20] that's where we deserve to go but there
[29:23] was a light that came between the
[29:25] divided sacrifice between the lamb and
[29:28] showing Abraham that no there is you
[29:32] don't have to go there. So but you see
[29:35] re Abraham wrestling with this all
[29:37] night. Well, now we go to his son Jacob
[29:41] or excuse me, his grandson Jacob. And in
[29:44] Genesis 28 11-14,
[29:47] this is now he's still Jacob and he's
[29:50] just shyered his way to get the blessing
[29:54] from his brother. And his father's like,
[29:56] "You better go to another land, this
[29:58] land, and get you a wife." And so he
[30:00] leaves. And Esau is like, "Where'd he
[30:04] go?" But he he leaves this place and he
[30:06] and and and here's how it goes. He lied
[30:09] upon a certain place and carried there
[30:11] all night
[30:13] because the sun was set. And he took of
[30:16] the stones of that place and put them
[30:17] for his pillows and laid down in that
[30:20] place to sleep. And he dreamed and
[30:22] behold a ladder set up on the earth. And
[30:26] the top of it reached to heaven. And
[30:28] behold, the angels of God ascending and
[30:30] descending on it. And behold, the Lord
[30:32] stood above it, and said, I am the Lord
[30:35] God of Abraham thy father, and the God
[30:38] of Isaac, the land whereon thou liest.
[30:40] To thee will I give it, and to thy seed,
[30:43] and thy seed shall be as the dust of the
[30:46] earth, and thou shalt spread abroad, to
[30:48] the west, to the east, to the north, and
[30:51] to the south, and in thee, and in thy
[30:54] seed shall all the families of the earth
[30:56] be blessed.
[30:58] We see the cross.
[31:01] We see God telling him, "Look, look
[31:04] around you to the to the north, to the
[31:06] south, to the east, to the west." And
[31:08] there he is standing in the midst. He's
[31:10] there at a place of the cross. And and
[31:12] God is rehearsing to him the same word
[31:16] he rehearsed to Abraham.
[31:18] This is I'm going to give you this land
[31:20] and your seed shall possess this land.
[31:22] And he's rehearsing the word to him.
[31:25] He's speaking the word so that he's
[31:27] hearing and that his while he's sleeping
[31:31] his imagination, his conscience, all his
[31:33] subconscious is hearing the word of God
[31:37] and and he's dreaming and he sees this
[31:40] angel or he excuse me he sees this
[31:42] ladder set up hooked up into heaven and
[31:46] hooked down onto the earth. Now, brother
[31:47] Brandham gives us a beautiful
[31:49] illustration of this and he says that
[31:51] that ladder was hooked where it was
[31:53] anchored into the earth was Jesus
[31:56] Christ. That the ladder of God was is
[31:59] hooked into heaven and and it's hooked
[32:01] and then it's anchored down in Jesus
[32:04] Christ. And that the angels will they
[32:07] ascend and descend bringing messages to
[32:10] the children of God. that when you have
[32:12] a need, there's angels that are bringing
[32:14] messages from heaven that God sends to
[32:17] you. And it's through Jesus Christ that
[32:21] we receive these these messages that we
[32:24] receive this the our answer.
[32:26] Amen.
[32:27] Now, a little bit later, Jacob goes, he
[32:30] leaves this place and he's still
[32:32] wheeling and dealing. Now, he's wheeling
[32:34] and dealing with with his future
[32:35] father-in-law.
[32:38] And, you know, he's pulling deals. his
[32:40] father-in-law's pulling deals, you know,
[32:42] I I want to work for this for for
[32:44] Rachel, you know, and and and he's like,
[32:46] "Yeah, well, uh, all right. Yeah, work
[32:48] for me." And here you get, Leah. And and
[32:50] then he's like, "Hey, what's the deal?"
[32:51] And he's like, "Well, work for me
[32:52] again." And so he's like, "Okay, I'll
[32:54] work for you again." And he's like
[32:56] striping the the the sticks and he's
[32:58] putting in the water and and Jacob's
[33:00] getting his father-in-law's cattle and
[33:02] he's getting rich off the cattle. He's
[33:04] like, "Hey, I guess this is how things
[33:06] go around here. you know, you you you
[33:09] you give me one, I give you one.
[33:14] But he leaves that place
[33:17] and he's on his way back to his country.
[33:22] He's got his wife and he's got his he's
[33:24] got all of his cattle. He's got all of
[33:26] his goods and he's on his way back. He's
[33:27] got his wives, his children. And then he
[33:30] hears wind, Esau's on his way here to
[33:33] meet you.
[33:34] In Genesis 32:es 24-28,
[33:38] Jacob was left alone. He'd sent his
[33:41] wives ahead. He'd sent all these things
[33:43] ahead. Jacob was left alone and there
[33:46] wrestled a man with him until the
[33:48] breaking of the day. So again, all
[33:50] through the evening time, Jacob's
[33:52] wrestling with God.
[33:56] And when he saw that he prevailed not
[33:58] against him, that the angel prevailed
[33:59] not against Jacob, he touched the hollow
[34:01] of his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's
[34:04] thigh was out of joint, and he wrestled
[34:05] with him. And he said, "Let me go, for
[34:08] the daybreakth." He said, "I will not
[34:10] let thee go except thou bless me." And
[34:13] he said unto him, "What is thy name?"
[34:15] And he said, "Jacob." And he said, "Thy
[34:18] name shall be called no more Jacob, but
[34:21] Israel. For as a prince hast thou power
[34:24] with God and with men, and hast
[34:27] prevailed.
[34:36] Now again, I I I'm coming back to that
[34:40] thought of how ridiculous this story
[34:44] would seem that a man could wrestle with
[34:46] God and win.
[34:52] But we do find that in Isaiah chapter 1
[34:56] and verse 18, we see God inviting man,
[35:00] saying, "Come, let us reason together."
[35:04] That though your sins be as scarlet,
[35:06] they shall be white as snow.
[35:12] God is inviting us.
[35:16] He He
[35:21] It's an invitation for embrace. It's an
[35:24] invitation for
[35:26] uh
[35:30] for a connection.
[35:33] It's not I'm God and you're down there
[35:37] and and there let's keep this. Let's
[35:40] just make sure we know that God is is
[35:43] showing us that there is an embrace that
[35:46] God desires
[35:48] this wrestling that there's this
[35:50] wrestling that's got to take place.
[35:55] Brother Brandham in Israel in the church
[35:56] says, "And watch, he touched his thigh
[35:59] and Jacob walked different."
[36:03] Amen. I hope that goes way down home.
[36:07] when you wrestle with God. Now, Brother
[36:09] Brandham doesn't say if you wrestle with
[36:12] God, he said when you wrestle with God,
[36:18] you'll walk different after that.
[36:31] It used to be this wrestling match with
[36:33] the devil. It used to be this wrestling
[36:35] match before I was saved.
[36:38] Who am I? And what am I here for? And
[36:42] there was this wrestling match there.
[36:46] But this is not wrestling to find out
[36:50] are you saved or are you not saved. No.
[36:55] No. That an that's already been
[36:56] answered. But this is something that we
[36:58] deal with on a daily basis as believers.
[37:03] And that's prevailing with God.
[37:08] It's a prevailing in this day, in this
[37:11] hour, in in 2023 where we're living.
[37:15] It's this wrestling with God to know
[37:18] when when God said, "Come, let us reason
[37:20] together." It's not, you know, give me
[37:22] your ideas and we'll just we'll see if
[37:24] your idea is better than my idea. No,
[37:26] it's God saying, "Let's reason. Let me
[37:28] hear the complaint. Let me hear where
[37:30] you're at. Let me hear the struggle. Let
[37:32] me hear the question. Just the honest
[37:34] question that you've got with the word
[37:36] that you've got with this message.
[37:38] Whatever it is, feel free. Ask it and
[37:41] let's reason it together so that I can
[37:44] walk you through the word. It's not just
[37:46] I'm God and just believe me and that's
[37:48] the end of it. It's let's wrestle this
[37:50] out so that you can work out of you the
[37:54] dross that you can work that thing out.
[37:59] Amen.
[38:02] We have family devotions.
[38:06] Um
[38:07] like that's a big shock to every Why you
[38:09] what
[38:12] what are those
[38:14] in our family devotions at home?
[38:18] uh
[38:20] Grace has the children uh reading
[38:22] chronologically through the Bible and
[38:25] they got to the book of Job
[38:29] and uh
[38:32] it just so happens that being
[38:34] self-employed
[38:35] and during the winters of Flag Staff
[38:38] there's not a lot of work so I get to
[38:40] sit home with my family a lot and I get
[38:43] to partake in the family devotions
[38:47] they're going to Job. And
[38:52] Job, the book of Job to me is so real.
[38:56] It's so man. It's It's I I'd say it's so
[39:00] man. That sounds awful. It's from God.
[39:03] It's of God, but it just personifies
[39:07] mankind so well.
[39:11] And we as you're going through Job,
[39:15] you're hearing uh of course at the
[39:17] beginning you hear God's uh conversation
[39:21] with the devil and how you know have you
[39:23] considered my servant and and and and go
[39:26] ahead and try him and oh no, you've got
[39:27] him protected. No, go ahead. Go ahead.
[39:29] Just don't take his life. And you're
[39:30] hearing this conversation that they're
[39:32] having without Job about Job.
[39:36] And uh but God's got confidence in Job.
[39:39] And brother Brandon talks a lot about
[39:41] Job and he says, you know, Job was so
[39:43] wise. People came from around the earth
[39:45] to hear the wisdom of Job, which is
[39:48] amazing. So he was already um God had
[39:51] just given him g a a real gift of wisdom
[39:55] so that people would come and hear him.
[39:57] when all of these things happen to Job
[39:59] and his children die and his and and his
[40:02] livestock die and then he be gets boils
[40:04] and
[40:05] and then his his miserable comforting
[40:08] friends come and they say, "Well, it's
[40:10] it you just you sinned. That's the
[40:12] deal." You know, like we got the answer.
[40:14] You're just a sinner. You just sinned
[40:16] and just make it right and all will be
[40:17] good again. And Job's like, "No, no, no,
[40:19] no, no, no, no, no."
[40:23] But Job begins wrestling
[40:27] And I I want to read just portions of
[40:29] this. I recommend obviously going and
[40:31] reading the entire book of Job, but I
[40:33] just want to read portions of the book
[40:35] of Job. Now I just want to show more of
[40:36] this wrestling. So in Job chapter 7 vers
[40:40] 13- 21, Job says, "When I say my bed
[40:44] shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my
[40:47] complaint, then thou scarest me with
[40:51] dreams." Now Job's talking with God.
[40:54] Then thou scarest me with dreams, and
[40:56] terrifiest me through visions, so that
[40:59] my soul choosth strangling, and death
[41:02] rather than life. I loa it. I would not
[41:06] live always. Let me alone, for my days
[41:09] are vanity. What is man that thou
[41:13] shouldest magnify him, and that thou
[41:15] shouldest set thine heart upon him, and
[41:18] that thou shouldest visit him every
[41:20] morning, and try him every moment? How
[41:23] long wilt thou not depart from me, nor
[41:25] let me alone till I swallow down my
[41:27] spittle? I have sinned. What shall I do
[41:31] unto thee, oh thou PRESERVER OF MEN? WHY
[41:34] HAST THOU SET ME as a mark against thee,
[41:36] so that I'm a burden to myself?
[41:40] And why dust thou not pardon my
[41:42] transgression, and take away MINE
[41:44] INIQUITY? FOR NOW shall I sleep in the
[41:46] dust, and thou shalt seek me in the
[41:48] morning, but I shall not be. Now, that's
[41:51] real talk.
[41:54] That's real talk. That's Job pouring out
[41:57] to God his complaint. And you go, I
[42:01] can't believe he said that.
[42:05] But this is so real.
[42:08] How many times have I said things not so
[42:11] King James like with the these and ths,
[42:14] but with the same inflections
[42:17] THAT GOD, WHO AM I?
[42:21] I just keep failing you. I I JUST KEEP
[42:25] DROPPING THE ball and why why do you
[42:28] keep giving me another chance and giving
[42:31] me another chance?
[42:33] Who? There's far better people out there
[42:37] that ought to get an opportunity. Why
[42:39] did you call me? I'm a loser.
[42:45] And Job is just being real with God. And
[42:49] then his accusers are like, "How can you
[42:51] say such things?"
[42:53] Job's like,
[42:58] "Look, look."
[43:05] So then in Job chapter 9,
[43:08] you know, that was chapter 7. Job
[43:10] chapter 9, I'm going read 1:3 and 32-33.
[43:14] Then Job answered and said,"I know it is
[43:17] so of a truth, but how should man be
[43:20] just with God?
[43:23] If he will contend with him, he cannot
[43:26] answer him one of a thousand.
[43:29] Who's going to who's going to contend
[43:32] with God?"
[43:35] Who can wrestle with God and win?
[43:40] Right?
[43:41] What a question. And then he jumps down.
[43:43] He says, "For God, he God, he is not a
[43:47] man as I am that I should answer him and
[43:49] we should come together in judgment,
[43:51] neither is there any days betw twix us
[43:54] that might lay his hand upon us both."
[43:56] Now, really quick, the daysman was if
[44:01] you and your neighbor got in a fight and
[44:03] your neighbor said, "I'm going to sue
[44:05] you. I'll see you in court." And you
[44:08] were like, "Okay, I guess we'll go to
[44:09] court." And so then the court's like,
[44:11] "Okay, well, we got a lot of cases. You
[44:13] know, your case will be in three
[44:16] months."
[44:18] The court files your your case. And they
[44:20] say, "Okay, the neighbor wants to sue
[44:22] you." And they say, "Is there
[44:26] we don't want to have to go through
[44:27] this. We have a lot of cases, serious
[44:29] cases, murders and, you know,
[44:33] kidnappings and so on and so forth,
[44:36] Teslas that catch on fire.
[44:40] They said, "Is there not a daysman? It's
[44:43] it's a guy that they can hire for the
[44:45] day to go to the to you and your
[44:49] neighbor and say, "Hey, what is there a
[44:51] way we could settle this without going
[44:54] throughout through all this process of
[44:56] the court? Is there a way we can settle
[44:58] this here and now on our farm?"
[45:02] You know, let's hear your complaint.
[45:04] Let's hear your complaint and let's see
[45:06] if we can settle this here. There's a
[45:08] daysman who can do that. Job is saying
[45:13] who who is there that can
[45:17] that can put his hands on sinful man and
[45:21] man in his condition and then a holy God
[45:24] that knows no sin, knows no
[45:26] unrighteousness, knows no, he has not
[45:30] experienced that. Is there somebody who
[45:32] can put his hand on a holy God and a
[45:34] sinful man and bring the two together
[45:39] that that this could be resolved
[45:43] BECAUSE WE LOSE EVERY TIME,
[45:46] RIGHT?
[45:48] WELL, then Job comes down
[45:51] to Job chapter 19
[45:54] as if Job's life was based on chapters.
[45:58] Let's hurry up and get to 19, Lord.
[46:02] So in Job 19:23-27,
[46:07] Job catches a revelation.
[46:10] He says, "Oh, that my words were now
[46:12] written. Oh that they were printed in a
[46:14] book that they were graven with an iron
[46:17] pin and led in the rock forever." In
[46:21] other words, this is important.
[46:23] Everybody should hear this.
[46:26] For I know that my redeemer liveth, and
[46:29] that he shall STAND AT THE LATTER DAY
[46:32] UPON the earth. And though after my
[46:35] skinworms DESTROY THIS BODY, YET IN MY
[46:38] FLESH SHALL I SEE GOD, WHOM I SHALL SEE
[46:40] FOR MYSELF, AND MY EYES SHALL BEHOLD AND
[46:43] NOT ANOTHER, THOUGH MY reigns be
[46:45] consumed within me. AND JOB CATCHES A
[46:47] REVELATION THAT THERE is one coming.
[46:50] There is a daysman who will be on the
[46:52] earth WHO CAN PUT HIS HANDS UPON A HOLY
[46:55] GOD AND A SINFUL man and bring
[46:57] reconciliation
[46:58] SO THAT NO MORE DO WE HAVE [screaming]
[47:00] TO ARGUE AND WRESTLE WITH OUR SINFUL
[47:04] CONDITION. BUT THERE'S GOING TO be a
[47:06] daysman who will solve that.
[47:09] And Job sees his redeemer. Job through a
[47:12] vision sees JESUS CHRIST. AND JOB
[47:15] RECOGNIZES ONE DAY
[47:17] THERE WILL BE SOMEBODY WHO WILL WRESTLE
[47:19] WITH GOD AND HE WILL WIN THIS BATTLE.
[47:26] So then we go to the end of the book in
[47:28] Job 42:es 1-6. Then Job answered the
[47:33] Lord and said, I know that thou canst do
[47:36] everything AND THAT NO THOUGHT can be
[47:39] withholden from thee. Who is he that
[47:41] hideth counsel without knowledge?
[47:44] Therefore, have I uttered that I
[47:46] understood not. And man, how many times
[47:49] have we uttered things that we didn't
[47:50] even understand? I said things I
[47:53] shouldn't have said. I didn't know what
[47:55] I was talking about.
[47:57] We're just being real.
[48:00] True.
[48:02] Things too wonderful for me, which I
[48:04] knew not. Here I beseech thee, and I
[48:06] will speak. I will demand of thee, and
[48:08] declare thou unto me. I have heard of
[48:11] thee by the hearing of the ear, but now
[48:15] mine eye seeth thee.
[48:18] Wherefore I abhore myself and repent in
[48:21] dust and ashes. And to think that Job
[48:25] comes to this conclusion at the end
[48:28] where he'd heard about the God. He'd
[48:30] heard about the things of God, but when
[48:32] then he be to see God in real time
[48:36] working in Job's life. AND JOB SAID,
[48:38] "I'VE HEARD OF YOU, GOD, but now I've
[48:42] seen you.
[48:43] I've seen it."
[48:46] Now, [panting]
[48:48] how am I on time? Okay, a little bit
[48:50] more. This is from the message I have
[48:53] heard, but now I see.
[48:56] You can imagine where the what the
[48:58] subject matter is. Brother Brandham
[49:00] says, "Now sometimes these great
[49:02] pulsations of faith come right in the
[49:04] time of crisis."
[49:07] I say amen to that, Lord. It's usually
[49:11] crisis that drives us into this. It was
[49:15] a crisis that drove Job into it. While
[49:18] he was at the end of his life, his
[49:20] children was dead, his camels, and all
[49:22] of his goods was gone and destroyed. And
[49:24] his own life, he was broke out from the
[49:27] crown of his head to the soles of his
[49:28] feet with boils. It was a crisis that he
[49:32] pressed himself. There's where the
[49:34] inspiration struck him. So now we see
[49:37] this crisis entering the picture in this
[49:40] wrestling in the garden. This work
[49:42] that's taking place in the garden. And
[49:44] when we see the crisis that was at hand
[49:47] with Jesus in the garden, it was our
[49:51] crisis. It was at hand. It was a crisis
[49:55] of the world. The world needed a savior.
[50:01] little further down now when the
[50:03] inspiration struck him that did it. He
[50:06] had it then. Now we found we find out
[50:08] there comes a time of these crisis when
[50:11] the press is right on and you look
[50:13] around today. Look at the condition
[50:15] we're living in. Aren't we living in a
[50:18] modern Sodom and Gomorrah?
[50:22] you you you you hear this and you read
[50:24] this and you think if you if you dare
[50:28] turn on the news or look at the news,
[50:31] it's like this anxiety begins to rise up
[50:33] within you.
[50:35] It's like this what is going on in the
[50:38] world? What is happening?
[50:42] Like you're kidding me. That did not No.
[50:47] People are not okay with this. And your
[50:50] anxiety be you're like where are we
[50:52] living? What is going on? And I mean you
[50:55] feel like is it in our house? And you're
[50:58] like okay get away. Like shut the news
[51:00] off
[51:02] and go grab your Bible.
[51:05] Okay. Get the good news.
[51:09] But it's true. Look at the conditions
[51:12] we're living in. It's this crisis
[51:14] moment.
[51:16] And when I look at this wrestling when I
[51:18] look at this wrestling for us, when I
[51:21] look at the wrestling for the believer
[51:23] today
[51:25] that you know what about, you know, it's
[51:27] it's not 1963 anymore. It's not, you
[51:31] know, we're not 1976 and we're thinking,
[51:33] you know, just next year, just next
[51:35] year, you know, we're 2023 and we're
[51:38] like, Lord,
[51:41] God, let your mercy,
[51:44] I pray your mercy is still with us and
[51:48] and it's got to be. I'm still here, you
[51:50] know, and I'm I'm I'm I'm believing. I'm
[51:52] one of them.
[51:54] And you go, Lord, it's so dark. It's so
[51:56] wicked. And and it feels like it's just
[51:59] crisis everywhere. Everywhere. Crisis,
[52:01] crisis, crisis. And the internet's
[52:03] speeding up and everything's speeding up
[52:05] and and you know, our work schedules are
[52:07] speeding up and it's just this anxiety
[52:09] buildup.
[52:16] Now, Brother Brandham says, "Now we find
[52:17] that in those hours of real stress,
[52:21] that's usually when the spirit of God
[52:23] moves in.
[52:25] He let the Hebrew children walk right
[52:27] into the fiery furnace before he ever
[52:30] moved a hand. But when he moved, he
[52:33] moves.
[52:35] And the church, this is further down,
[52:37] and the church has heard of God. They've
[52:40] read of him and what he did and the
[52:43] promises he made. But now we see him
[52:46] with our eyes just the same as Job did.
[52:49] I've heard of thee, but now I see thee.
[52:53] What a difference.
[52:58] And it I can't you you can't put on a
[53:01] tape.
[53:03] You know, you can't hear one of brother
[53:05] Brandham's sermons
[53:09] without, you know, Brother Brandham does
[53:11] such a nice job of taking us and giving
[53:14] us Bible foundation and saying this
[53:17] isn't strange and weird and, you know,
[53:19] some cult and fanaticism. This is in the
[53:23] Bible.
[53:25] And he begins to settle our spirits
[53:27] because we begin to see it in the word.
[53:29] We go, "That's right. That's in the
[53:30] word.
[53:31] That's in God's Bible. That's not new.
[53:34] That's Bible."
[53:36] And so, and then we begin to see God
[53:39] moving and healing the sick and opening
[53:42] the eyes and revealing the secrets that
[53:44] are hidden in this Bible.
[53:48] and the things that we'd heard of so
[53:51] long. We'd we'd heard that God was a
[53:53] healer. We heard that go but then we
[53:56] begin to experience and we begin to see
[53:57] it happening in our day.
[54:02] We begin to see the mysteries unfolded
[54:04] in our day in this last day. We begin to
[54:06] see answers answers that were hidden in
[54:09] here for generations. And we can say, "I
[54:13] heard of God." You know, I grew up in a
[54:16] Christian home. I'd heard of God, but
[54:18] now I see God real.
[54:21] I see him real and alive.
[54:33] I I'm going back to Revelation. I'm I'm
[54:35] coming to a close. And in in
[54:37] Revelations, we go back to chapter 5
[54:41] and we see that this
[54:44] this angel says to to to John, "Weep
[54:48] not. The lion of the tribe of Judah has
[54:50] prevailed." He already prevailed. And
[54:52] John recognizes
[54:54] he he turns and he sees he this lamb,
[54:58] this one who's worthy to open the book.
[54:59] And he begins rejoicing.
[55:02] And in verse 13, John says, "And every
[55:05] creature which is in heaven and on the
[55:07] earth, and under the earth, and such as
[55:10] are in the sea, and all that are in them
[55:12] heard I saying, blessing and honor and
[55:15] glory and power be unto him that siteth
[55:18] upon the throne, and unto the Lamb
[55:20] forever and ever."
[55:26] in that same message that we took the
[55:28] the quote of brother Brandham's talking
[55:31] about the prevailing and how that it was
[55:33] Jesus in the garden he'd prevailed
[55:35] that's where he did it that's where the
[55:37] prevailing took place was in the garden
[55:40] at the end of that message the breach
[55:44] he comes to he he gets down to this
[55:47] verse verse 13 and brother Brandham says
[55:50] you know that got next to John he must
[55:54] have saw his name wrote there. When them
[55:57] seals broke, he must have got real
[55:59] happy. Listen what he said. And every
[56:02] creature which is in heaven and on the
[56:04] earth and underneath the earth, such as
[56:06] within the sea, and all that in them is
[56:08] in them, heard me, I saying, blessings,
[56:12] honor, glory, power be to him that sits
[56:15] upon the throne, and to the lamb
[56:17] forever. Amen. Amen and amen. And the
[56:21] four beasts said, "Amen." And the four
[56:23] and 20 elders fell down and worshiped
[56:25] him that lives forever and ever. And old
[56:28] John, who'd been standing there, our
[56:30] brother, crying.
[56:33] He'd been crying. He'd been weeping.
[56:35] Why? He said, "Everything in heaven,
[56:38] everything in the earth, and everything
[56:39] in the sea heard me holler, amen.
[56:43] Amen. Blessings, honor, and might, and
[56:46] power be to him that lives forever and
[56:48] ever." Talk about a happy time when them
[56:52] seals broke. John must have looked in,
[56:54] seen a past the curtain of time, and
[56:56] said, "There's John."
[56:59] Oh,
[57:01] he was so happy till he said,
[57:03] "Everything in heaven." He must have
[57:05] really cried out, didn't he? Everything
[57:08] in heaven, everything in the earth,
[57:10] everything beneath the earth, every
[57:11] creature, everything else heard me
[57:13] saying, "Amen. blessings and glory and
[57:16] wisdom and power and might and riches
[57:18] belongs to him. Amen. Why? When the
[57:22] revelation come that the lamb, the
[57:24] redeemer, our kinsmen had come back from
[57:27] the throne of mediatorial and had walked
[57:30] out here to take his possession.
[57:41] You know, John was there
[57:44] at the cross. He was at the foot of the
[57:45] cross.
[57:52] John was there during the crucifixion.
[57:54] John was he ran ahead of Peter and got
[57:57] to the tomb and noticed he Jesus wasn't
[58:00] there.
[58:02] John saw all that. John saw the
[58:04] sacrifice hanging on the cross. John uh,
[58:08] you know, was that one that leaned upon
[58:10] his bosom.
[58:15] I don't how much of that did John take
[58:17] in at when it was happening? I don't
[58:20] know. Did John recognize this was the
[58:23] sacrifice for me and for my sin while it
[58:26] was happening? I'd like to believe that.
[58:31] [crying]
[58:33] But after the scriptures are compiled,
[58:35] you know, John and Mary,
[58:38] they they work together to compile the
[58:40] gospels,
[58:41] right?
[58:42] And that's what got him thrown onto the
[58:44] aisle of Patmas was for the word of
[58:47] God's sake, you know, putting together
[58:49] the gospels for in the name of Jesus.
[58:51] And all of this, putting this all
[58:53] together, got him onto this island. And
[58:56] God gets him alone on this island and
[58:59] begins giving him these these visions
[59:04] and
[59:07] and here John sees this lamb who's
[59:10] prevailed and he sees that it was Jesus
[59:14] and then when brother Random just
[59:15] explains that it was there IN THE GARDEN
[59:18] THAT'S WHERE HE prevailed
[59:20] when John just saw that he had prevailed
[59:25] that it It was Jesus that had prevailed.
[59:28] And then John saw that it wasn't just
[59:30] for merely at the time of his life, but
[59:34] this was of eternal significance.
[59:37] That when he saw that there was this
[59:39] lamb's book of life and that his name
[59:42] was on it, THAT IT MEANT SO MUCH MORE
[59:46] this prevailing
[59:47] that what happened for him.
[59:53] I I simply I close
[1:00:03] with this question and
[1:00:06] you know is it an ask? Is it a is it a
[1:00:10] challenge?
[1:00:11] Call it what it is. I I call it whatever
[1:00:14] you'd like to call it.
[1:00:21] But
[1:00:23] if seeing
[1:00:26] if seeing what was prevailed or what
[1:00:29] Jesus prevailed over in the garden for
[1:00:32] us
[1:00:37] affects our conscience,
[1:00:41] our affections,
[1:00:43] our reason,
[1:00:44] our memory and our imaginations.
[1:00:50] and how that we can begin to go through
[1:00:52] the scriptures. Now, this is what I mean
[1:00:55] when I say we can go through the arcade
[1:00:58] as believers, as saved. You, the seal is
[1:01:01] on you. You've got the seal. Now, let's
[1:01:04] go exploring
[1:01:06] to see what
[1:01:10] that as we still wrestle with God. If we
[1:01:14] are still wrestling on a daily basis,
[1:01:18] what is it that we're able to work out?
[1:01:22] Can we have a new conscience,
[1:01:25] new affections,
[1:01:27] new imaginations,
[1:01:30] new reasons, new memory
[1:01:33] toward the word of God, and toward uh
[1:01:37] the promises of God. Amen.
[1:01:40] We can we don't have to look back
[1:01:42] through our memory and say, you know, oh
[1:01:45] that was awful. What what I came out of
[1:01:48] was don't even look to that. Instead,
[1:01:51] begin looking at what did God do for me
[1:01:54] there
[1:01:56] and what did he do for me there
[1:01:59] and wasn't that God there? And as our
[1:02:03] memories as as the memories begin to
[1:02:06] come in about God about the things of
[1:02:09] God and it comes all the way down into
[1:02:12] that self-will gate that you say yes
[1:02:15] Lord you allow it in and you say by
[1:02:18] faith you say God if you did it for me
[1:02:21] then I believe you can do it again.
[1:02:25] Then there then doubt it just got no way
[1:02:28] to get into that gate. It's just faith
[1:02:31] coming in. It's just faith. And and I'm
[1:02:34] I just get so excited thinking about
[1:02:37] perfecting faith that God is still
[1:02:41] perfecting me and my faith.
[1:02:45] He's He's still perfecting my faith in
[1:02:48] him by allowing me to get into the word
[1:02:52] of God to look into my own life
[1:02:55] and see God is moving in my life. I see
[1:03:00] him moving. I see him answering prayer.
[1:03:02] I see him answering questions that I
[1:03:05] had. Changing my personality, changing
[1:03:07] my character.
[1:03:09] Even now as a Christian, he's still
[1:03:12] making my character better
[1:03:15] than when it was when I first gave my
[1:03:17] heart to the Lord.
[1:03:23] There's a prevailing for us. Amen.
[1:03:26] That Jesus was the source example for us
[1:03:32] wrestling with God and being able to
[1:03:36] prevail.
[1:03:39] I look forward to it.
[1:03:42] I look forward to hearing about the
[1:03:44] wrestling matches in my brothers and
[1:03:46] sisters and saying, "And you know, you
[1:03:49] want to hear a testimony that came from
[1:03:51] it.
[1:03:53] It'll be there." Amen.
[1:04:00] I guess the challenge would be,
[1:04:09] can we be real enough with God? Can we
[1:04:12] be honest enough as believers? Can we be
[1:04:15] transparent enough with God
[1:04:20] that we can say, "God,
[1:04:25] I got to wrestle with you. We got to
[1:04:26] have a match
[1:04:30] because there's things in my conscience
[1:04:33] that it's carnal. It's me.
[1:04:38] It's personal. It's my personal.
[1:04:40] Whatever you want to say, whatever it's
[1:04:42] character carryover, whatever you want
[1:04:43] to call it, it's got to go.
[1:04:46] I We've got to have a Gethsemane match.
[1:04:51] That would be my challenge is is is take
[1:04:54] that home. Take that home. Take that to
[1:04:57] work tomorrow.
[1:04:59] Take take that to school. Take that to
[1:05:01] your closet. Take that wherever it is
[1:05:03] that you want to get alone with God and
[1:05:05] say, "All right, here this is my safe
[1:05:08] space with God. here. I want to be
[1:05:10] transparent. I want to be clear and open
[1:05:13] with you. That would be my challenge.
[1:05:15] Wonder if we could stand together.
