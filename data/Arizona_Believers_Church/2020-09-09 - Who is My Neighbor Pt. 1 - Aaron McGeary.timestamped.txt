[0:00] but luke chapter 10 verses 25 to 37
[0:05] and we know it as the parable of the
[0:07] good samaritan
[0:09] and uh i'm wanting to draw uh from the
[0:12] question
[0:13] that is asked in this passage of
[0:15] scripture
[0:16] and behold a certain lawyer stood up and
[0:19] tempted him saying master
[0:20] what shall i do to inherit eternal life
[0:24] and he said un to him what is written in
[0:27] the law
[0:28] how read is thou and he answering said
[0:31] thou shalt love the lord thy god with
[0:33] all thy heart
[0:34] with all thy soul and with all thy
[0:36] strength and with all thy mind
[0:38] and thy neighbor as thyself and he said
[0:41] unto him thou hast answered right this
[0:44] do
[0:44] and thou shalt live but he willing to
[0:47] justify himself
[0:48] said unto jesus and who is my neighbor
[0:52] jesus answering said a certain man went
[0:54] down from jerusalem to jericho
[0:56] and fell among thieves which stripped
[0:58] him of his raiment and wounded him
[1:00] and departed him leaving him half dead
[1:03] and by chance there came down a certain
[1:05] priest that way
[1:06] and when he saw him he passed by on the
[1:08] other side
[1:10] and likewise a levite when he passed at
[1:12] the place came and
[1:13] looked on him and passed by on the other
[1:15] side
[1:16] but a certain samaritan as he journeyed
[1:18] came where he was
[1:19] and when he saw him he had compassion on
[1:22] him
[1:23] and went to him and bound up his wounds
[1:25] pouring in oil and wine
[1:27] and set him on his own beast and brought
[1:29] him to an inn
[1:30] and took care of him and on the morrow
[1:33] when he departed he took out two pence
[1:35] and gave them to the host and said unto
[1:37] him take care of him
[1:39] and whatsoever thou spend us more when i
[1:41] come again i will repay thee
[1:43] which now of these three thinketh thou
[1:47] was neighbor unto him that fell among
[1:49] the thieves
[1:51] and he said he that showed mercy on him
[1:53] then
[1:54] said jesus unto him go and do thou
[1:57] likewise let's bow our heads on a word
[1:59] of prayer
[2:00] as we pray we'd like to just remember
[2:02] brother ron spencer in prayer
[2:04] as we know he's been overcoming
[2:08] a battle with cancer but he's also uh
[2:10] been
[2:11] diagnosed with uh covet 19 and so
[2:14] some good news this afternoon he was
[2:16] released from the hospital and sent home
[2:18] with some medications and some things to
[2:21] monitor his breathing so we trust he's
[2:23] doing well sister connie also has had uh
[2:26] the the virus so let's just remember
[2:29] them in prayer as we bow our heads
[2:31] our gracious heavenly father we're so
[2:32] happy to be gathered to death
[2:34] together this evening lord we believe
[2:37] that we're gathered in your presence
[2:38] lord we believe that we've lifted up
[2:40] praises and worship to you
[2:42] and father as we stand here tonight
[2:44] reading from this book that we know is
[2:46] the infallible word of god that we know
[2:47] that is
[2:48] it is god breathed and it is god
[2:50] inspired we pray lord that you would
[2:52] come and take it now as only you can
[2:54] and break it to us lord as only you cam
[2:57] may make it alive to us by revelation
[2:59] but we commit it to you lord believing
[3:01] that there's truths in these
[3:03] just this one passage of scripture lord
[3:05] the exchange
[3:06] between jesus and this lawyer the the
[3:08] answer that is given by christ we know
[3:10] that there's
[3:11] such rich truths contained in it we know
[3:13] that it will put us
[3:14] in a closer walk with you or help us to
[3:17] be better bearers of your name
[3:19] so father we pray that you would open it
[3:20] up to us and give us strength and
[3:22] courage we pray
[3:23] lord we pray for brother ron spencer his
[3:25] church tonight his family
[3:26] that you would continue to strengthen
[3:28] them and heal them lord may you just
[3:30] deliver him from this pneumonia lord
[3:32] just take these symptoms of this virus
[3:34] father

[3:43] unabated lord without hindrance raise
[3:46] your servant up we pray lord as we
[3:47] commit him to you
[3:48] and just pray we join our voice with the
[3:50] thousands tonight lord who are praying
[3:52] for him
[3:52] praying for a healing lord a total
[3:54] healing we ask this in the name of the
[3:56] lord jesus christ
[3:57] amen amen you may be seated
[4:04] my title i'd like to give and in looking
[4:07] at this we're starting
[4:09] a subject of who is my neighbor
[4:13] and in looking at this subject i'd like
[4:16] to do it on
[4:17] uh on perhaps if the lord would lead us
[4:20] to do it
[4:20] on more than one service do it on
[4:22] wednesday nights and i find that
[4:24] wednesday nights affords you an
[4:26] opportunity maybe to go at a little bit
[4:27] different pace
[4:28] sometimes it could be what might be seen
[4:31] to be more teaching
[4:32] and i just when uh when the lord began
[4:36] to lead us in this path
[4:37] to start this work god anchored this
[4:40] subject
[4:41] in my heart of who is who is my neighbor
[4:44] and it's a question i think that each
[4:46] one of us can ask we may be able to ask
[4:48] it as a local church
[4:49] you can be asking it as an individual
[4:51] and there's such rich truths contained
[4:53] in the scripture in this subject and so
[4:56] this is just a foundational sermon
[4:58] in this subject some might look at it as
[5:00] the good samaritan some may look at it
[5:03] as a parable alone but it's something
[5:05] that a
[5:06] a dynamic conversation between christ
[5:09] and someone else
[5:10] that just unfolds a great picture in
[5:12] many different truths
[5:13] that i believe will be a strength to us
[5:15] and we've been looking at on sunday
[5:17] genesis chapter 1 verse 1 where it says
[5:19] in the beginning god
[5:21] created the heaven and the earth and
[5:24] i've been pondering the beginning of a
[5:26] thing
[5:26] and how that brother branham said the
[5:28] way god starts that's the way god
[5:30] finishes
[5:31] so we know that god starts perfectly and
[5:33] he ends perfectly
[5:34] and some of us may be start out slow and
[5:36] we may start out
[5:38] stumbling and we kind of bumble our way
[5:40] through certain things but we could
[5:41] eventually get it right and when it
[5:42] comes to the end product
[5:44] there it finally looks good and that's
[5:46] maybe the way that we do things but god
[5:48] has a way of doing something where
[5:49] even if it doesn't look right to us the
[5:51] way god starts
[5:53] is the way god finishes and i was
[5:55] thinking of different principles that we
[5:57] find in the message and
[5:58] certain things that have been expressed
[6:00] many times to us in ministry
[6:02] how that if you're if you're trying to
[6:04] aim at a target if you're off just a
[6:06] little bit at your scope and your sight
[6:08] isn't lined up right
[6:09] then by the time you reach the target
[6:11] you're even further off
[6:13] than you were just even where the line
[6:14] of sight was and the sight and the scope
[6:16] and so as time goes on if you're off at
[6:19] the beginning if you're off at the start
[6:20] the further you go the more you vary
[6:23] from the course
[6:24] and just was thinking of those different
[6:26] things and different principles in the
[6:28] scripture
[6:29] and i could say that my inspiration is
[6:31] this the right foundation
[6:33] for arizona believers church to have the
[6:35] right kind of foundation
[6:37] brother braham says before you can ever
[6:39] get started right you got to get on
[6:42] the right foundation and it's a it's a
[6:45] wonderful opportunity when the lord does
[6:47] a new thing
[6:48] and he does something where it's not
[6:50] building upon something else or it's not
[6:52] continuing something else
[6:53] but god desires to do something new and
[6:56] to start from
[6:57] from the ground as it were and i think
[6:59] i'm learning not to say from nothing
[7:01] but the lord starting something and
[7:03] taking things and bringing things
[7:05] together
[7:05] it gives you an opportunity to make sure
[7:07] you're starting out on the right track
[7:09] that you're starting to write on on the
[7:11] right basis and for the right reasons
[7:13] and i want to read a couple statements
[7:15] to you
[7:16] from by brother branham there may be a
[7:19] couple lengthy statements but they
[7:21] they deal with this thought of starting
[7:23] out on the right foundation
[7:25] and brother branham says in the message
[7:26] fellowship by redemption
[7:28] and i'm believing that the day that
[7:30] we're living now
[7:31] the most essential thing that i could
[7:33] think of any minister speaking of
[7:35] is to get the people back to the general
[7:38] principles of the gospel
[7:39] coming back to a place now
[7:43] that might seem uh to some they might
[7:44] read that think oh well what about
[7:46] uh the the depth of the word or the open
[7:48] of the word
[7:49] i have to realize that the the open of
[7:51] the seals
[7:52] those aren't the things that brother
[7:53] branham begin with when his ministry
[7:56] started
[7:56] there's things that he preached for a
[7:58] number of years even if you go back
[7:59] where he he's commissioned in 1933
[8:02] and you take everything that he would
[8:03] have preached up until we have his first
[8:05] recordings in 47
[8:06] all the way up to 1963 the beginning of
[8:09] 63
[8:09] those are all principles of the gospel
[8:12] upon which the open of the seals could
[8:14] settle upon
[8:15] so even in our own individual lives we
[8:18] are tasked as parents
[8:19] to teach our children the general
[8:21] principles of the gospel
[8:23] as a minister you continue to preach the
[8:25] general principles of the gospel
[8:27] because when they come to a new birth or
[8:29] you come to an understanding of the
[8:31] opening of the word
[8:32] these principles are necessary for
[8:34] everything to fit together
[8:35] and for the life of christ to be
[8:37] expressed and these
[8:39] general principles of the gospel they're
[8:40] always with us
[8:42] you're never going to mature beyond the
[8:44] general principles of the gospel
[8:46] if you lay a foundation of a house and
[8:48] then you build the house upon it
[8:49] if you want that house to stand you
[8:51] build it within the foundation
[8:54] you don't go beyond the foundation you
[8:55] don't exceed the the limits of the
[8:57] foundation you
[8:58] you're going to have a two-story house
[9:00] you need to have a two-story foundation
[9:02] if you're going to have a 3 000 square
[9:03] foot house and it's going to be single
[9:04] story you need to have a
[9:06] 3 000 square foot foundation so there's
[9:08] a foundation
[9:09] determines the scope of the building it
[9:11] determines that the height
[9:13] of the building and so we are never
[9:15] going to get away from the general
[9:17] principles of the gospel
[9:19] and brother branson says the most
[9:20] essential thing that he could think that
[9:21] a minister could speak on
[9:24] so he says he says for if you're not
[9:26] built upon the right foundation
[9:28] it's just it's no good what's the use of
[9:31] building upon a foundation that's
[9:32] already been condemned
[9:34] what would be the use of trying to paper
[9:36] and paint an old building that the
[9:38] government had condemned
[9:39] and that's what many people are trying
[9:41] to do today by reforming trying to
[9:43] reform
[9:44] we'll start a church and we'll turn a
[9:46] page and we'll do today
[9:48] he says and and we'll try to do a little
[9:49] different than we used to do
[9:51] you'll never get nowhere like that it's
[9:53] just foolish to even try
[9:55] you're just only wasting time you say
[9:58] well now i believe if i would just quit
[10:00] my line and stealing
[10:01] all those things are good and as good as
[10:03] they are you're still a million miles
[10:05] off of the road you've got to start back
[10:09] to the foundation so even things that in
[10:12] themselves
[10:13] may be good and efforts that might be
[10:15] scriptural or even pleasing to the lord
[10:18] in terms of the the the inspiration
[10:20] that's behind it the desire that's
[10:21] behind it
[10:22] he's saying it doesn't do any good if
[10:24] the foundation's not right
[10:25] got to come back to the right foundation
[10:27] you got to start back
[10:29] to the foundation you got to build a new
[10:31] place
[10:32] not patch up the old one it says build a
[10:35] brand new and you got to come back
[10:36] and start right this is this is
[10:39] instructive to us as individuals
[10:41] he says you can't just you can't just
[10:43] patch up an old place
[10:44] build a brand new one you got to come
[10:45] back and start right that's the reason
[10:47] you see so many faulty mistakes so many
[10:50] people indifferent
[10:51] people who profess christianity the
[10:53] reason why you see mistakes and you see
[10:55] people who confess christianity or
[10:57] profess christianity
[10:59] who are indifferent or they're lukewarm
[11:01] or they don't have overcoming lives
[11:03] it's because they're just trying to
[11:04] patch up something that's old
[11:06] and they don't look at some say i need
[11:07] to start all over not build upon my own
[11:10] ideas
[11:10] not build upon my own traditions and
[11:13] opinions of certain things but to come
[11:15] back down
[11:15] to start new to start start all over
[11:18] again and start on the right kind of
[11:20] foundation
[11:21] not build on a man's foundation not try
[11:23] to further a carnal legacy but come back
[11:25] start new start fresh start on the right
[11:27] foundation
[11:29] and brother brown is expressing this to
[11:31] an individual
[11:32] even expressing this in the way that hit
[11:34] the direction of these statements maybe
[11:35] even to
[11:36] a church or people wanting to do things
[11:38] right or have a revival it says it won't
[11:39] do you any good
[11:40] unless you're on the right foundation
[11:42] and this is instructive to us as we
[11:44] begin
[11:44] something you've got to have the right
[11:46] foundation if you want to see the lord
[11:48] bless something
[11:50] and the message to whom should we to
[11:51] whom would we go
[11:53] he says here some years ago i was
[11:55] standing up here in new york
[11:57] with brother berg we had passed by a
[11:59] building and there was a mammoth big
[12:01] building
[12:02] oh it was beautiful and the architect
[12:04] had taken so much
[12:05] pains with how he had built it and its
[12:08] class
[12:09] and when we got to the building the
[12:10] surprise it was just
[12:12] almost completely finished but had been
[12:14] left sitting there
[12:16] no one was occupying it and i said
[12:18] what's the matter
[12:20] but to this man i said what's the matter
[12:22] to this man that i was with
[12:23] i said what's wrong he said the building
[12:26] only served for one purpose
[12:28] the contractor was so interested in what
[12:31] he put in the building
[12:33] that he forgot to go deep enough to put
[12:35] it on the right foundation
[12:38] i think about that here's an architect
[12:40] this is someone who
[12:41] ought to have known better this is
[12:42] someone that conceived in their mind
[12:44] a beautiful building brother said it was
[12:46] beautiful he says my you look there was
[12:48] a mammoth big building it was beautiful
[12:50] and the architect had taken great pains
[12:52] as to how he built it but he was so
[12:54] interested in what was
[12:56] in the building and all the amenities
[12:58] and all the furnishings and all the nice
[13:00] trim and all the
[13:01] uh the the gingerbread trappings that
[13:03] would be in this house
[13:04] that he never thought about the
[13:06] foundation that would be resting on
[13:08] he says the contractor was so interested
[13:10] in what he was putting in the building
[13:12] that he forgot to go deep enough to put
[13:14] it on the right foundation
[13:15] so it was condemned and most any time
[13:18] that building
[13:19] would rock down no one will rent it
[13:21] nobody wants it no matter how pretty it
[13:23] is
[13:23] it wasn't placed on the right foundation
[13:27] so here's a principle to us to
[13:29] understand that no matter how much you
[13:31] could try to dress something up no
[13:32] matter how pretty you might want to make
[13:33] it look either on the outside or the
[13:35] inside
[13:35] it's got to have the right foundation or
[13:37] it won't succeed
[13:39] it's subject to fail at any time it's
[13:41] subject to topple over he says no one
[13:43] will rent it nobody wants it no matter
[13:44] how pretty it is he said brother sister
[13:46] may i say this in respects of jesus
[13:48] christ
[13:49] i don't care how good you go to church
[13:51] how well you dress
[13:52] what good neighbor you are unless you
[13:54] took time to dig down to that foundation
[13:57] of jesus christ
[13:58] and lay your hopes in that solid rock
[14:00] yonder your beautiful church buildings
[14:02] your robe choirs whatever which is fine
[14:05] but it'll rock down some of these days
[14:07] god will condemn it
[14:09] because it's not laid upon the rock
[14:11] christ jesus
[14:13] here he is identifying that the
[14:16] accoutrements of church the trappings of
[14:18] a church the great choirs a good song
[14:20] service
[14:20] all the things that could make a dynamic
[14:22] church service and all the things let's
[14:24] just be honest all the things that
[14:26] actually make us comfortable in church
[14:28] the things we enjoy about church
[14:30] he's saying those things are fine
[14:31] they're great they're wonderful
[14:33] but if you're not if it's not laid upon
[14:35] the rock christ jesus
[14:37] then it'll be condemned in the end now
[14:40] that
[14:40] doesn't mean that there's a clock that's
[14:42] ticking and we just anything that
[14:44] doesn't have the right foundation we
[14:45] just sit back and just say
[14:46] just watch any moment it's going to fall
[14:48] apart no there's things that are going
[14:49] to continue forever
[14:51] continue unabated continue seemingly
[14:53] flourishing things doing wonderfully
[14:55] but if you really want to succeed in
[14:56] christ if you really want to meet the
[14:58] mark and
[14:59] listen in this hour a goal of any church
[15:01] the goal of any individual
[15:03] should be to go in a rapture uh the the
[15:06] goal of
[15:06] the the the thrust of the message in
[15:08] this hour isn't just to perfect
[15:10] funeral services it's not to make us
[15:12] better uh
[15:14] able to deal with loss and to deal with
[15:16] the passing of a loved one
[15:18] but rather we are not living for a grave
[15:20] we're not living for a funeral
[15:22] we're actually living for a translation
[15:24] we are the people
[15:25] on earth today that are going to defeat
[15:27] death and that should be the drive
[15:29] and the ambition of a church and there's
[15:31] no way you're ever going to defeat death
[15:33] unless you're built upon christ the
[15:35] solid rock
[15:36] that's what david expresses in psalms 25
[15:39] he's he says now will my head be lifted
[15:41] up above my enemies
[15:42] he says now he has set me up upon a rock
[15:46] he's expressing something that's upon
[15:47] that rock that you are able to defeat
[15:50] death it's upon that rock you can
[15:51] look above your enemies brother brown
[15:54] showing how in even in the natural
[15:56] things a contractor
[15:57] so interested in how beautiful the
[15:59] building was he never took time to make
[16:01] sure the foundation was done right
[16:04] he says he is the only foundation and he
[16:07] says in mexico city we had a great
[16:09] meeting
[16:10] where their little baby was brought back
[16:11] to life and there wasn't that great
[16:14] place where we were having the meeting
[16:15] and this is just continuing that
[16:16] statement he
[16:17] transitions to mexico city he said we're
[16:20] having the meeting one of the brothers
[16:21] take me the next day
[16:22] out to look the city over which is
[16:24] mexico city a beautiful place
[16:26] but what did i find when i got out there
[16:28] looking down over the city
[16:30] some of the most modern architecture i'd
[16:32] ever seen oh they want they went all
[16:34] together out
[16:36] but what it was they never dug down to
[16:39] find
[16:39] the right foundation a great percent of
[16:42] mexico city is either pitched forward
[16:44] the buildings are backwards or sideways
[16:46] they never went to the rock no matter
[16:49] how pretty
[16:50] the building looked it wasn't built
[16:52] solid on the rock
[16:54] and when you're starting out for god
[16:56] don't lay down on some false foundation
[16:59] don't lay down on emotions don't lay
[17:01] down on some creed
[17:03] but lay your life in the hands of that
[17:05] eternal foundation jesus christ
[17:07] that chief cornerstone then build from
[17:10] then
[17:11] on no matter how fast or how slow you
[17:13] got the right foundation
[17:15] so it doesn't matter how fast or how
[17:16] slow if the foundation's right the
[17:18] building is going to be sure
[17:20] build from then on lay upon him for he's
[17:22] the only foundation
[17:23] that's for has security but you are
[17:25] secured in jesus christ
[17:27] as long as you're in him you are safe
[17:29] from the storm he
[17:30] is the only foundation
[17:33] and in each one of these examples if you
[17:36] want to take even brother branham taught
[17:37] me how you've got to start back to the
[17:38] right foundation and you got to build a
[17:40] new place not patch up the old one
[17:42] you got to start brand new what is he
[17:44] saying you can't build upon
[17:46] just patch up something old because the
[17:48] foundation isn't right
[17:50] and there's a lot of times when people
[17:51] will do a remodel project they'll
[17:53] actually find a place and
[17:55] they don't really like maybe what was
[17:56] built but realize this is a good
[17:58] foundation
[17:58] they'll tear down the whole structure
[18:00] and continue to use the foundation
[18:02] but what good would it be to build upon
[18:05] improve something that was old and patch
[18:07] it up if the foundation's not right
[18:09] and so he uses these two examples in
[18:12] this sermon where there's a a building
[18:14] in new york and all these buildings in
[18:15] mexico city
[18:16] they say they didn't dig down deep
[18:19] enough they forgot to go
[18:20] deep enough to put on the right
[18:21] foundation they never dug down to find
[18:24] the right foundation
[18:25] and he's saying that there's an effort
[18:27] that has to be taken
[18:28] in the beginning to ensure the longevity
[18:31] of the structure
[18:33] and i i don't pretend to be a builder
[18:35] and i'm actually maybe the antithesis of
[18:37] a builder
[18:38] uh not that i'm a destroyer but i'm just
[18:40] not really a builder i'm not really
[18:41] handy at figuring those things out
[18:43] but you find in my limited knowledge
[18:46] you'll find that the greatest expense is
[18:48] often in the beginning of something
[18:50] whether it be in the engineering of the
[18:52] plans and the design of the structure
[18:54] and then when money begins to be spent
[18:56] there's there's a lot of work that goes
[18:58] into making sure
[18:59] that the dirt is level that the studies
[19:02] of the soil and it can
[19:03] handle the weight of this of the
[19:06] building and if certain things need to
[19:07] be done to the soil certain things to be
[19:09] done to the
[19:10] the land all for to ensure the longevity
[19:13] and the safety and the integrity of the
[19:15] structure
[19:16] and so sometimes the greatest expense in
[19:18] a building is in the foundation
[19:21] the foundation's connected with your
[19:22] plumbing it'll be connected with your
[19:24] with your electrical and you don't want
[19:26] to skimp on that
[19:27] and say wow man this this house is going
[19:29] to cost us a lot of money it's 180 000
[19:32] to build it why am i putting 80 000 in
[19:34] the foundation
[19:35] couldn't we just skimp a little bit on
[19:36] the foundation and i can put more
[19:38] trim up or i can use a nicer brick i can
[19:40] have better appliances in there and you
[19:42] can say
[19:43] sure go for it but what are you going to
[19:45] have in a few years
[19:47] all those appliances and all the nice
[19:48] brick and all the nice trim it'll be
[19:50] popping it'll be
[19:51] settling to be sinking because you
[19:52] didn't want to spend the money in the
[19:54] beginning
[19:55] you didn't want to extend the effort in
[19:56] the beginning to dig down deep get the
[19:58] right foundation
[19:59] and those are the principles that
[20:01] brother branham is eliciting
[20:02] when he's talking about how something is
[20:05] built you've got to be on
[20:06] the right foundation and i i express
[20:09] that to you as as family this evening
[20:12] just to lay a foundation there you go
[20:15] how's that for
[20:16] uh for connecting that together just to
[20:18] lay a foundation for why
[20:20] why how the lord dealt with my heart on
[20:22] approach in this subject
[20:23] of who is my neighbor that there's it
[20:26] may
[20:26] it's it's i want to do it in the
[20:28] foundation in the beginning of this
[20:30] church
[20:30] so that there's certain principles that
[20:32] were built upon certain things that
[20:34] become a part of our dna
[20:35] certain that things that become a part
[20:37] of our prayer life and our vision
[20:39] so that we never lose sight of the
[20:41] purpose of the church
[20:42] that we never lose sight of the purpose
[20:44] of our experience with god and how god
[20:46] wants to use
[20:47] us and something that's very very real
[20:49] to me is how brother branham teaches in
[20:51] this hour
[20:52] that the bride is she is she is the
[20:54] ministry of the son of man she is
[20:56] expressing
[20:57] a manifest in the ministry of the son of
[20:58] man so the bride is going forth to serve
[21:01] him
[21:01] and in serving him she has a mission and
[21:04] a ministry to all the world
[21:06] and that we don't we don't gather in a
[21:08] church building just to insulate
[21:10] ourselves from others
[21:11] and we and we don't have a fellowship so
[21:13] that we can kind of come away in secret
[21:15] gatherings in a secret commune
[21:16] and it's all hushed and we don't ever
[21:18] let anybody know what we're doing but
[21:19] rather
[21:20] we gather in times like this to be
[21:22] strengthened so that we can be a light
[21:24] to the others that we come in contact
[21:25] with
[21:26] that we would have something burn in our
[21:28] hearts where there would be no shame
[21:29] in us recognizing maybe a hurting soul
[21:32] at work or we see somebody in our
[21:33] extended family
[21:34] that needs reaching out to it and we
[21:36] have something that we can offer them
[21:38] something that we can reach out to them
[21:40] to encourage them to strengthen them and
[21:42] they need to even be excited about
[21:43] inviting them to come to church
[21:46] and so if we want to look back at our
[21:48] text
[21:50] in luke chapter 10 my question is
[21:53] is taking it straight from this who is
[21:55] my
[21:56] neighbor now this
[22:00] this lesson that is expressed here it's
[22:03] it's uh
[22:04] it's part of that right foundation that
[22:06] i desire
[22:07] for this work and it says in verse 25
[22:11] and we'll just start with this and again
[22:12] we're not going to
[22:13] probably get very far in the subject
[22:15] tonight
[22:16] but just laying these things in here to
[22:19] ponder them
[22:21] it says in luke chapter 10 verse 25
[22:23] we'll read to verse 27 it says and
[22:25] behold
[22:26] a certain lawyer stood up my you got to
[22:28] watch those lawyers
[22:29] he says a certain lawyer stood up and
[22:31] tempted him so now
[22:32] it's it sets the scene that it's it's
[22:35] not merely
[22:35] someone who's sincere coming to him with
[22:37] the question in his heart
[22:39] but it it tells us that his motive in
[22:41] approaching christ
[22:43] is to tempt him and this scene is is
[22:46] is common when you read the gospels they
[22:48] were often looking for a way to trip up
[22:50] jesus
[22:51] to get him to say something wrong to
[22:53] rally the people against them to expose
[22:55] them as a fraud
[22:56] so this lawyer stands up and tempts him
[22:58] saying master
[22:59] what shall i do to inherit eternal life
[23:03] and jesus responds with the question
[23:05] what is written in the law
[23:06] what readers thou what is it that's in
[23:08] the law that you read what's your
[23:10] you answered the question now you want
[23:12] to know how to
[23:13] inhere eternal life i'm going to bring
[23:14] you back to your foundation or your
[23:17] belief system
[23:18] what is it in the law that you read what
[23:19] is your understanding
[23:21] he answers and says in verse 27 thou
[23:23] shalt love the lord thy god with all thy
[23:25] heart
[23:26] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[23:28] strength and with all thy mind
[23:31] and thy neighbor as thyself in other
[23:33] words
[23:34] love the lord thy god with all thy heart
[23:36] and love thy neighbor
[23:37] as thyself so the lawyer trying to
[23:41] jesus is saying what can i do to inherit
[23:43] eternal life
[23:44] jesus then kind of changes he takes
[23:46] control of the conversation
[23:48] and he gets the lawyer to begin to think
[23:50] about the law what he's taught in the
[23:52] law and what is it that
[23:53] he holds to and what does he think is
[23:54] the greatest and he says it's to love
[23:56] the lord with all your heart all your
[23:58] soul your strength all your mind
[23:59] and to love thy neighbor as thyself
[24:02] now his answer is it fits perfectly
[24:06] with the way that jesus also answers a
[24:08] similar question
[24:09] in matthew 19. so if you want to look at
[24:12] matthew chapter 19 verses 16 to 19.
[24:16] and notice this and behold one came and
[24:18] said to him good master
[24:20] what good thing shall i do that i may
[24:23] have
[24:24] eternal life and he said unto him
[24:27] why call us thou me good there is none
[24:31] good but one that is god but if thou
[24:34] wilt
[24:35] enter into life keep the commandments
[24:38] he saith unto him which now notice this
[24:41] is he's saying there's none good but god
[24:43] if you want to enter into life keep the
[24:45] commandments and this is
[24:47] this parallels with with the the lawyer
[24:49] that's tempting him this tempting lawyer
[24:51] who says what can i do to have eternal
[24:53] life he says what's written in the law
[24:54] what do you read in the law
[24:55] so he's bringing him to the commandments
[24:58] and then this
[24:58] this one who came unto him and said good
[25:00] master he says which of these
[25:01] commandments
[25:02] jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou
[25:05] shalt not commit adultery
[25:06] thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear
[25:09] false witness
[25:10] honor thy father and thy mother and thou
[25:12] shalt love
[25:13] thy neighbor as thyself
[25:16] so now when jesus was dealing with a
[25:18] similar question
[25:20] he elicits these commandments and then
[25:22] he references how that thou
[25:23] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[25:27] then just turn to matthew chapter 22. so
[25:29] it's just going to be a few pages later
[25:31] there where you're looking now in
[25:33] matthew chapter 22 verses
[25:35] 34 to 40. again this is
[25:38] uh this is a similar subject matter
[25:42] that's being raised
[25:43] but when the pharisees had heard that he
[25:45] had put the sadducees to silence
[25:47] they were gathered together now how did
[25:49] this happen they come to him they ask
[25:50] him a question
[25:51] jesus is able to answer the question in
[25:54] such a way
[25:55] to where it stuns them and again he did
[25:57] this over and over and over again where
[25:59] they come with the question
[26:00] and he's able to answer the question in
[26:02] such a way
[26:03] to where it it it foils their plan
[26:07] just as they came to them with they say
[26:09] well who should we pay tribute to and he
[26:11] said well
[26:12] show me the money and he said well whose
[26:14] inscription is that whose image is on
[26:16] that they said oh well it's caesar he
[26:17] said well give to caesar caesar's
[26:20] and he had such a way of answering these
[26:22] questions and then they ask him about
[26:23] the resurrection and he has a way
[26:25] to even answer them on the resurrection
[26:27] and he's one by one they come to him
[26:29] trying to tempt him trying to trip him
[26:30] up
[26:31] and he has a way of just each time
[26:33] answering with such wisdom and such
[26:34] authority
[26:35] to where they can't nail him down so now
[26:37] they the pharisees here that he put the
[26:39] sadducees to silence and they
[26:41] they're gathered together now people who
[26:42] are common enemies
[26:44] now are joining themselves together to
[26:46] fight against christ
[26:48] and isn't that something you see that
[26:49] happened all the time people who may be
[26:51] sworn enemies
[26:52] people who never get along watch god
[26:54] start doing something
[26:55] and pretty soon people start joining up
[26:57] and banding together
[26:58] to fight against god and fight against
[27:00] the truth and fight against the word
[27:02] because they find common ground in
[27:04] hating the truth
[27:05] they may hate each other but the common
[27:07] ground of hating truth
[27:08] will overcome a hatred for each other
[27:11] and they'll actually unite against the
[27:12] truth
[27:13] and that's what's happening here they
[27:15] gather together and verse 35 then one of
[27:17] them which was a lawyer
[27:19] here they go again my goodness one of
[27:22] them which is a lawyer asked him a
[27:23] question
[27:24] tempting him saying master which is the
[27:26] great commandment in the law
[27:29] and jesus said unto him thou shalt love
[27:31] the lord thy god with all thy heart
[27:34] with all thy soul and with all thy mind
[27:37] this is the first and great commandment
[27:40] now i i believe it's speculated in one
[27:43] place i think i'd read before
[27:44] one of the commentaries that this lawyer
[27:47] that comes from
[27:48] luke chapter 10 that he very
[27:51] he very well may have been repeating
[27:52] back what he knows jesus said
[27:54] but these are certain things that were
[27:56] rehearsed
[27:58] by the jews to one another this this
[28:00] commandment love the lord thy god with
[28:01] all the heart all thy soul and all thy
[28:03] mind
[28:03] he said this is the first and great
[28:05] commandment this is exactly what is
[28:07] expressed by the lawyer
[28:08] in luke chapter 10 who came to tempt him
[28:11] then verse 39 this is very
[28:13] very heavy and the second is like unto
[28:16] it
[28:18] so the first and great commandment is to
[28:20] love the lord thy god with all the heart
[28:21] soul and mind
[28:22] now that makes a lot of sense to us does
[28:24] anybody have a problem with that one
[28:26] that god's first commandment would be
[28:28] love me with all that you are all your
[28:29] soul
[28:30] all your strength all your mind love me
[28:32] with everything that you have
[28:33] with uh oh give me all that you are and
[28:35] we say that's
[28:36] that makes a lot of sense even if we
[28:38] wanted to attribute to god some false
[28:40] motive and and make him a deity among
[28:42] many
[28:43] if he had this desire this command that
[28:45] you were to love him with everything
[28:47] that would even meet a logical
[28:49] conclusion that someone would have
[28:50] that a deity would require so it's maybe
[28:53] not hard for anyone just to accept that
[28:55] god would want you to love him
[28:57] with everything that you are soul spirit
[28:59] body heart soul and mind
[29:01] but then he says the second one is like
[29:04] unto it
[29:05] so the second commandment is like the
[29:07] first commandment
[29:08] the first commandment being to love god
[29:10] the second one is similar to it and
[29:12] joined to it
[29:13] and we could look at it this way it
[29:14] flows from the first one
[29:16] he says thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[29:19] thyself
[29:21] now this is
[29:25] a substantial saying
[29:28] this is something that we can't be
[29:30] dismissive of it's not something you
[29:32] just rationalize with
[29:33] he says the first one is to love god
[29:34] with all your soul all your heart
[29:36] all your mind and then it says the
[29:38] second one is like it
[29:40] love thy neighbor as thyself on these
[29:43] two commandments
[29:44] hang all the law and the prophets all
[29:47] the law
[29:48] all the prophets hang upon the
[29:49] commandment to love the lord thy god
[29:51] and to love thy neighbor as thyself
[29:53] that's what everything's rested upon
[29:55] that's what everything is connected to
[29:57] and tethered to
[29:58] is these these two commandments and in
[30:00] each one of these instances we've read
[30:02] in three places already in the gospels
[30:04] where loving thy neighbor as thyself is
[30:07] brought up by
[30:08] jesus and brought up by the jews as
[30:10] something that was very
[30:11] focal to their faith and they're drawing
[30:14] it from leviticus chapter 19. so i'd
[30:16] like to read this so you can have the
[30:18] context of it
[30:19] leviticus chapter 19 verses 11 to 18
[30:23] he says ye shall not still neither deal
[30:27] falsely neither lie one to another
[30:29] and you shall not swear by my name
[30:31] falsely
[30:32] neither shalt thou profane the name of
[30:35] thy god
[30:36] i am the lord now these are
[30:40] principles that we would find that they
[30:43] have to do with decency and integrity
[30:45] when
[30:46] we even understand that these are things
[30:47] that would be prohibited criminally
[30:50] within our society within a decent
[30:52] society don't steal and don't deal
[30:54] falsely don't lie
[30:55] these are things that just basic uh
[30:57] dealings you shall not swear by my name
[30:59] falsely this
[31:00] relates to your attitude towards god and
[31:02] using the lord's name in vain not
[31:03] profane in the name of god
[31:05] i am the lord now notice from verse 13
[31:08] on to verse 18
[31:09] thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor
[31:12] neither rob him
[31:13] it would seem that it would be just
[31:16] maybe a given that you wouldn't do that
[31:18] so but yet it's still
[31:20] humans and their base nature they need
[31:22] to be told whatever you do
[31:23] don't rob your neighbor he says the
[31:25] wages of him that is hired shall not
[31:27] abide with thee all night until the
[31:28] morning so pay the wages timely give
[31:30] them don't withhold them
[31:32] thou shalt not curse the death nor put a
[31:34] stumbling block before the blind but
[31:35] shall fear thy god i am the lord
[31:37] you shall do no unrighteousness and
[31:39] judgment thou shalt not respect the
[31:41] person of the door nor honor the person
[31:43] of the mighty
[31:44] but in righteousness shalt thou judge
[31:46] thy neighbor
[31:48] thou shalt not go up go up thou shalt
[31:50] not go up and down
[31:52] as a tailbearer among thy people neither
[31:55] shalt thou stand against the blood of
[31:56] thy
[31:57] neighbor i am the lord thou shalt not
[31:59] hate thy brother in thine heart
[32:01] thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy
[32:04] neighbor and not suffer sin upon him
[32:06] thou shalt not avenge nor bear any
[32:08] grudge against the children of thy
[32:09] people
[32:10] but thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[32:12] thyself
[32:13] i am the lord you can take
[32:17] and and i and i'm just laying these
[32:19] principles out there for you just to
[32:20] maybe digest to chew on a little bit and
[32:22] ponder them as i mentioned before we
[32:24] won't go very far in this tonight
[32:27] but it's just it's just identifying that
[32:30] when the law is given
[32:32] this principle of loving your neighbor
[32:34] as yourself
[32:35] became focal to it to the point where
[32:37] jesus can say
[32:38] that loving god with all your soul and
[32:41] all your heart and all your mind
[32:43] and loving your neighbors yourself that
[32:44] all the law and the prophets
[32:46] hang upon this rest upon this are built
[32:49] upon this
[32:49] i have continuity and consistency
[32:52] through this understanding it has its it
[32:54] has its uh
[32:56] its accomplishment or its success and
[32:57] these two commandments
[32:59] jesus expressed them when he gives all
[33:02] these commandments he comes back to love
[33:04] thy neighbor as thyself
[33:06] and if you look at this passage here in
[33:07] these several verses in leviticus 19
[33:10] you find that if you can love your
[33:12] neighbor as yourself
[33:13] then you wouldn't rob him you wouldn't
[33:16] defraud him
[33:17] if you could love your neighbor as
[33:18] yourself you'd pay the wages and not
[33:20] withhold them to the morning
[33:21] that you would not put a stumbling block
[33:23] before the blind you would not
[33:24] you would not curse the death there are
[33:26] certain things that you would do
[33:27] that if you could love your neighbors
[33:29] you would love yourself then you would
[33:30] as the we would say do unto others as
[33:32] you would have them do unto you
[33:34] you wouldn't behave towards them in a
[33:36] way that you wouldn't want to be behaved
[33:38] towards
[33:39] so it serves even to kind of summarize
[33:41] maybe what god's trying to say he says i
[33:43] am the lord i am the lord i am the lord
[33:44] i'm trying to tell you how to act
[33:45] i'm not telling you how to treat one
[33:47] another so he says i let me say this but
[33:49] love thy neighbor as thyself and it just
[33:51] seems to kind of
[33:52] combine all these thoughts into one to
[33:54] realize yes this has to do with how i
[33:56] treat somebody
[33:58] that if i could love him as i love
[34:00] myself i wouldn't rob him i wouldn't
[34:02] defraud him i would even if i could love
[34:04] him as i love myself i would want to be
[34:05] corrective i would want to
[34:07] rebuke him and not not sin rest upon him
[34:09] there's certain ways that you would act
[34:11] towards them
[34:12] and so the the law brings the neighbor
[34:15] and your relationship to the neighbor
[34:17] into view
[34:18] and it makes it important that the
[34:20] individual just does not exist within a
[34:22] vacuum
[34:23] they don't exist in isolation that even
[34:25] their their pla
[34:26] to be pleasing before god and their
[34:28] relationship to god
[34:29] and even your success in the word is
[34:32] connected to relationships
[34:34] that aren't just your relationship to
[34:35] christ
[34:37] can you ponder that for a moment when we
[34:39] think about what what makes us
[34:40] a christian it's my personal experience
[34:42] with christ what is the new birth
[34:44] it is a revelation of jesus christ
[34:46] personally to you now once that
[34:48] relationship begins and once i'm on that
[34:50] foundation
[34:51] then the word is instructive and i begin
[34:54] to realize
[34:55] that i'm going to have relationships
[34:57] with other people
[34:58] that are not that are beyond maybe not
[35:00] beyond the word
[35:02] but that are connected with or are
[35:04] outside of my relationship with christ
[35:06] i have a relationship with christ but i
[35:08] can't just exist in a bubble and not
[35:09] meet with other people
[35:11] i cannot say well now that i'm a
[35:12] christian i'm going to divorce my wife
[35:14] and i'm going to move to idaho and i'm
[35:15] going to farm the land
[35:16] and i just want to be all by myself and
[35:18] i want to live as a hermit i want to i
[35:20] want to come away from all people
[35:21] all society all things and just live by
[35:24] myself you'd find that you couldn't live
[35:26] a christian life that way
[35:27] brother man says you cannot be a
[35:29] christian and stay at home
[35:31] you cannot be a christian and not go to
[35:33] church so there's certain things that
[35:35] were taught in the word of god that show
[35:37] that we must come together
[35:38] we must have relationships with other
[35:40] people and the dynamics of family and
[35:42] extended family
[35:43] it's all about relationship with others
[35:45] and we're seeing that in the bible in
[35:47] the old testament
[35:48] it was instructing them how to conduct
[35:50] themselves with other people
[35:52] even when the commandments were given
[35:54] the ten commandments in exodus 20
[35:56] two of the ten deal directly with the
[35:58] neighbor exodus 20 16 and 17 thou shalt
[36:01] not bear false witness against
[36:03] thy neighbor thou shalt not verse 17
[36:06] thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's
[36:07] house
[36:08] thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife
[36:09] nor his manservant nor his maidservant
[36:11] nor his ox nor his ass
[36:12] nor anything that is thy neighbors
[36:16] god allowed one fifth of the ten
[36:18] commandments two of these
[36:20] two of the ten to stand for your
[36:22] attitude towards and your treatment of
[36:25] your neighbor and so this
[36:28] is when when this lawyer who's tempting
[36:31] jesus and
[36:32] and that's just a few things that we've
[36:34] mentioned in the old testament a few
[36:35] things we've referenced because
[36:37] we plan to go deeper into this subject
[36:39] of who is my neighbor
[36:40] but these are just things maybe to whet
[36:42] your appetite a little bit get you to
[36:43] think and ponder
[36:44] about this subject so when the lawyer
[36:47] answers jesus he says what's written the
[36:49] law what readest thou
[36:50] and he says thou shalt love the lord thy
[36:52] god with all thy heart and with all thy
[36:54] soul with all thy strength with all thy
[36:56] mind
[36:56] and love thy neighbor as thyself jesus
[36:59] responds to him in verse 28 and he said
[37:00] unto him
[37:01] thou hast answered right this do and
[37:04] thou shalt live
[37:06] if you'll do this then this is this is
[37:08] the way to live this is how to have
[37:10] eternal life as he
[37:11] had answered previously you know keep
[37:13] the commandments if you'll enter into
[37:14] life
[37:15] keep the commandments so this is a way
[37:18] even if we wanted to try to wrestle with
[37:20] the paradox of how can i just keep the
[37:21] commandments and enter into eternal life
[37:23] he's showing this is the way to live
[37:26] this is the right kind of path to be on
[37:28] don't think that you can mistreat people
[37:30] and not love god and somehow find your
[37:32] way into eternal life
[37:33] but if you want to follow in truth if
[37:35] you want to walk in the light if you
[37:36] want to meet the
[37:37] the thresholds or or or to meet the mark
[37:40] for your age you've got to be loving god
[37:42] and loving your neighbor as yourself he
[37:45] says the house answered right this do
[37:46] and thou
[37:47] shalt live he's not reducing the
[37:50] commandment to be born again he's not
[37:51] taking it away he's not changing the
[37:53] formula of baptism and repentance he's
[37:56] just saying
[37:57] if you'll do these things this is the
[37:59] right way to live this is the right way
[38:01] the path to be in so now in this
[38:03] conversation he comes to him and he
[38:05] tempts them what shall i do to
[38:06] internally
[38:07] inherit eternal life jesus promised him
[38:09] what are you reading the law what do you
[38:10] what do you think
[38:11] is the most important he answers back of
[38:13] loving god and the neighbor is thyself
[38:15] jesus says that's a great answer
[38:17] but then notice verse 29 and this is
[38:20] where
[38:21] this is where the conversation begins to
[38:23] change
[38:24] and jesus is going to have to further
[38:26] take this lawyer to school
[38:28] he says but he willing to justify
[38:31] himself
[38:32] said unto jesus and who is my neighbor
[38:36] now there may be different ways that
[38:38] through inflection we could
[38:40] express just accurately the attitude
[38:43] that this lawyer had
[38:45] but it does it's we know that it's not
[38:47] sincere
[38:48] because he says willing to justify
[38:50] himself
[38:51] we know that he approached him even with
[38:53] the wrong approach because
[38:54] he was tempting him and so jesus through
[38:57] his wisdom
[38:58] is asked a question and he's able to
[39:00] kind of turn the question back on
[39:02] the lawyer and and certainly in this day
[39:05] and age
[39:06] in terms of the lawyers then if nobody
[39:08] understands this the lawyers then didn't
[39:09] study
[39:11] the criminal code like we do today
[39:13] lawyers then are different than the
[39:14] lawyers now i'm not saying one's better
[39:16] than the other
[39:17] but the lawyers then studied the law the
[39:20] law is given to moses the law is given
[39:22] to them in the order
[39:23] ordinances and sacrifices so it was a it
[39:25] was a spiritual thing it was ordinance
[39:26] related to their religion
[39:28] and their duties as as as jews and the
[39:31] judaic law that was imposed upon them
[39:34] and
[39:34] the way to approach god and the way to
[39:35] treat one another way to judge and so
[39:37] that's what a
[39:37] lawyer was but in today's parlance a
[39:40] lawyer
[39:41] asking a question to tempt jesus and
[39:43] then jesus asked him a question
[39:45] and now he's the one giving the answers
[39:46] he really flipped the script on him
[39:49] because that's one thing you learn as a
[39:50] lawyer never negotiate against yourself
[39:52] so you always want to have the other
[39:54] person negotiate against themselves
[39:56] they said well i'll give you 500 for it
[39:58] well don't you just say well 500 that
[40:00] doesn't
[40:01] that's not really what i was really
[40:02] wanting to make i mean could you give a
[40:04] little bit more
[40:05] and then you get them to up the offer
[40:06] without coming down off your price
[40:08] that's called having making them
[40:10] negotiate against themselves
[40:12] and jesus has now caught this lawyer to
[40:14] where he's he's answered and jesus is
[40:16] the one
[40:16] telling it well then you you did good
[40:18] that's right just do this and you'll
[40:19] live
[40:19] so now i imagine his attitude is a
[40:21] little bit more sour
[40:23] and willing to justify himself he says
[40:25] to jesus
[40:26] and who is my neighbor
[40:29] just exactly then because now he's kind
[40:31] of caught a little bit
[40:33] he says and love thy neighbor as thyself
[40:35] well if you'll do that then
[40:36] you've answered right you shall live
[40:38] well then who's my neighbor
[40:40] and notice the bible says willing to
[40:42] justify himself
[40:44] he had the wrong motive he was wanting
[40:47] to appear blameless
[40:50] he was wanting maybe to vindicate
[40:53] himself
[40:54] he was wanting to set forth uh uh to to
[40:57] look as if he had the
[40:58] the upper hand that he was justified
[41:00] that he he was he was blameless in his
[41:03] activities
[41:03] but there's something there's some
[41:04] pressure that's coming down on him no
[41:06] doubt
[41:06] for him to respond and who is who is my
[41:09] neighbor
[41:10] we've already read in matthew 22 verse
[41:12] 35 where it says they they came to him
[41:14] tempting him
[41:15] this is something that happened very
[41:16] often they're going to tempt him with
[41:18] the coin with the tribute
[41:19] tempting with questions about the
[41:20] resurrection always trying to trip him
[41:22] up always trying to get him to give the
[41:23] wrong answer
[41:24] and so now once again this tempting
[41:26] lawyer asked this question
[41:28] yet willing to justify himself he says
[41:31] who is
[41:31] my neighbor and i want to emphasize this
[41:34] part here in the beginning of this
[41:36] subject
[41:37] because this part cannot be missed we
[41:40] could go to the parable of the good
[41:41] samaritan we could read that we could
[41:43] study it we could try to take from that
[41:45] we could even come to a satisfactory
[41:47] conclusion tonight just by reading it
[41:49] they come to the end and jesus says well
[41:50] then who was the neighbor to him
[41:52] that fell in the way so well the one
[41:53] that showed mercy upon him and we could
[41:55] be satisfied that we understand better
[41:57] a principle of christ we understand
[41:59] better the nature of the good samaritan
[42:01] and how
[42:02] we would aspire to be him but the the
[42:04] this part
[42:05] where the lawyer is saying who is my
[42:07] neighbor
[42:08] and he says it in a way to justify
[42:10] himself we cannot
[42:12] overlook the pres the beginning of this
[42:14] parable
[42:16] if we're going to understand the parable
[42:17] of the good samaritan if we're going to
[42:19] understand
[42:20] this parable that jesus uses to show us
[42:22] who our neighbor is
[42:23] we have to understand the basis of the
[42:25] lawyer's question when he asked
[42:28] he asked who is my neighbor he's the one
[42:30] that was asking the question
[42:32] who is my neighbor he was doing it for
[42:33] self-justification
[42:36] therefore the answer that jesus gives
[42:39] directly responds to that bias
[42:42] the lawyer asked with a certain thought
[42:44] in his mind he asked with the
[42:45] motive he asked with this with this uh
[42:48] some kind of bent to it
[42:50] and who is my neighbor and since he
[42:52] asked with this motive he comes to him
[42:54] tempting him
[42:54] since he asked willing to justify
[42:56] himself jesus
[42:58] in order to give the correct answer has
[43:00] to address
[43:01] this motive that's in his heart jesus
[43:05] has to answer in such a way to where it
[43:06] attacks that bias it attacks that
[43:08] selfishness
[43:09] it attacks that self-justification and
[43:11] it'll it'll take it away from him
[43:14] and say at least expose him and have him
[43:17] uh wrestle with the truth of who really
[43:19] is your neighbor
[43:21] and this is it takes place in the
[43:24] message in a few places i could think of
[43:25] offhand
[43:26] where brother branham's asked a question
[43:28] and you find that the way that brother
[43:30] branham answers the question
[43:31] initially to us may not seem like the
[43:34] right answer
[43:35] when he's asked the question do all
[43:36] born-again believers go in the rapture
[43:39] well you take the message from 47 to 65
[43:42] and you can definitively prove
[43:44] that only born-again believers go in the
[43:46] rapture
[43:47] but yet now brother brahms answering the
[43:49] question in such a way towards like well
[43:50] wait a minute he says no
[43:52] only those that have the holy ghost and
[43:54] then when you realize that brother
[43:55] branham was often dealing with
[43:57] terminology
[43:58] and that this person that was asking the
[44:00] question must have had this in their
[44:03] mind
[44:03] that you could be born again without the
[44:05] holy ghost that you just accept christ
[44:08] it's like a
[44:08] i'm just born again i've accepted christ
[44:10] as my savior maybe a baptist
[44:12] understanding of salvation
[44:13] and so had brother branham answered the
[44:15] question right according to our theology
[44:18] according to the way that we understood
[44:20] the question he would have actually
[44:21] given the wrong answer to the individual
[44:24] who asked it
[44:25] so if we could even use it in this way
[44:28] the person who asked brother
[44:29] adam do all born again believers go in
[44:30] the rapture brother branham may have
[44:32] understood that he had a different
[44:34] understanding what born again meant so
[44:36] he had to orient him to to the fact that
[44:38] you have to be
[44:39] quickened by the holy ghost baptized at
[44:41] the holy ghost only those who have the
[44:43] holy ghost are going to go in the
[44:44] rapture
[44:44] and he's able to kind of correct this
[44:46] person's understanding
[44:48] and not give him the wrong answer so
[44:50] when this
[44:51] lawyer asked christ well who's my
[44:53] neighbor
[44:54] christ sees this bias in his heart this
[44:57] judgment or this deficiency that's in
[44:59] his heart and this motive that he has
[45:01] and his answer is going to address
[45:03] whatever's lacking in his heart
[45:06] and i think it's evident by the way that
[45:08] jesus answers that this lawyer
[45:10] probably had a narrow definition of what
[45:13] a neighbor was
[45:15] that to him immediately when he says and
[45:17] who is my neighbor he might have just
[45:19] been thinking of his history
[45:21] all of his bias and all his prejudice
[45:23] and all his discrimination
[45:25] his attitude towards the gentiles
[45:26] attitude towards maybe even the
[45:28] samaritan
[45:29] he might have hated samaritans he he
[45:31] might have had a bumper sticker on his
[45:33] cart
[45:34] rid judea of all samaritans and build
[45:37] that wall or something like that and he
[45:39] might have just
[45:39] it might have had a political platform
[45:41] and jesus just knew oh
[45:43] i'm going to get this guy i'm going to
[45:44] tell him a parable that's going to
[45:46] really hit him in his bias
[45:48] hit him right there in his prejudice and
[45:50] it's more than likely because he was a
[45:52] lawyer a student of the of the
[45:54] the judaic law he would have had a
[45:55] narrow definition that a neighbor was a
[45:58] jew and a jew only
[46:00] and think about this that's exactly how
[46:03] a lot of these jews perceived
[46:04] the law this is exactly how these jews
[46:07] would have perceived
[46:08] when the bible says love thy neighbor as
[46:10] thyself they would have said well my
[46:12] neighbor is my fellow jew
[46:14] and that would make it a lot easier
[46:18] and and he did it now he did it as a
[46:21] means
[46:22] to self-justify so self-justification
[46:25] was his motive
[46:27] so he wants to have this narrow
[46:28] definition of who
[46:30] who a a jew excuse me who a neighbor is
[46:34] so that he can be justified in his
[46:35] conduct he can be justified in his
[46:38] attitude
[46:38] he could be justified in his behavior
[46:40] and his judgments of others
[46:43] now make this very personal how easy
[46:46] would it be for us to
[46:47] make categories of people so that we can
[46:51] be justified in the way that we talk
[46:53] about them
[46:54] the way that we treat them and the way
[46:56] that we would avoid them the way that we
[46:57] would harm them whatever it might be
[46:59] and say well i i kind of ripped him off
[47:02] he's he's an unbeliever anyways
[47:04] oh my boss is rich he will never know
[47:06] that it's gone and besides he's not even
[47:07] a christian he doesn't even pay tithes
[47:09] this is just my
[47:10] way of getting the tithes in the right
[47:12] bucket my boss doesn't pay ties so
[47:14] i can skip i could do a little here and
[47:16] a little there how often
[47:17] are we able to judge somebody place him
[47:20] in a category
[47:21] and because we've placed him in another
[47:23] category we feel
[47:24] justified and vindicated in our
[47:27] attitudes towards them
[47:29] because they don't believe what we
[47:30] believe they don't live the same
[47:32] standard that we live
[47:33] they don't they don't told the line that
[47:35] maybe we think they should
[47:36] they don't look the part and so we're
[47:39] able to have attitudes towards them and
[47:40] treat them certain ways
[47:42] and so self-justification was his motive
[47:45] and i just want to take a few moments
[47:46] and this is a very very robust and
[47:48] a wonderful subject to explore in
[47:51] greater detail
[47:52] but self-justification is a very very
[47:55] nasty thing
[47:58] because when you this mechanism and all
[48:00] of us have it
[48:01] so at this point don't put your pencil
[48:03] down and be like yeah i want to see him
[48:05] rake that person over the coals no
[48:06] you're you're
[48:07] you're included too we all have it some
[48:10] are just better than others
[48:11] [Music]
[48:13] i i i there's my i came across a piece
[48:16] of paper
[48:17] when we were moving we found uh i found
[48:19] a little
[48:20] notepad that my high school one of my
[48:21] high school english teachers had given
[48:23] me it says everyone's entitled
[48:24] to my opinion and i think i had another
[48:27] one that said
[48:28] opinions are like noses and and the
[48:31] punchline to that is everybody has one
[48:33] and so i just added mine and mine are
[48:35] just bigger than yours
[48:38] because opinions are like noses
[48:42] i think maybe that that stands stands
[48:44] out on its own
[48:47] but self-justification makes it
[48:50] difficult if not impossible to say i'm
[48:52] wrong
[48:55] self-justification is so powerful that
[48:58] when you have offended somebody or done
[48:59] something wrong
[49:01] it makes it virtually it makes it very
[49:03] very difficult if not impossible to say
[49:05] i'm sorry i made a mistake
[49:08] and self-justification would work in
[49:10] such a way to where i could do something
[49:12] to offend
[49:12] brother john and i could recognize oh
[49:14] that was harsh
[49:15] that didn't seem right and and maybe i
[49:18] shouldn't have said that but
[49:19] self-justification would start to say
[49:20] but you know what he probably deserved
[49:22] it
[49:22] or you know what he's just reaping what
[49:24] he sowed
[49:25] right and we start thinking about
[49:27] scenarios in our minds to make ourselves
[49:29] feel
[49:30] better about what we said or what we did
[49:32] and we self-justify and if i engage in
[49:34] that kind of
[49:35] thought process then i'm probably not
[49:37] going to say you know what i'm really
[49:38] sorry i shouldn't have done that
[49:40] i've justified myself i'm the bearer of
[49:42] god's judgment or all you know really
[49:44] wasn't that bad he just needs thicker
[49:45] skin
[49:46] and self-justification will make it very
[49:48] very hard if not impossible for you to
[49:50] go to somebody and say
[49:51] i'm sorry i made a mistake
[49:54] now that may be very very damaging in
[49:57] our relationship to one another but
[49:58] there's a relationship with christ
[50:00] that when self-justification begins to
[50:02] work and you can't repent
[50:03] it will be impossible to grow in him
[50:06] be impossible to go any further and some
[50:08] people are living
[50:10] at this behind a wall or burial
[50:13] prison of their self-justification
[50:15] having offended or made mistakes or done
[50:17] things wrong
[50:18] years ago because of but with because of
[50:20] an unwillingness to just say i'm sorry i
[50:22] made a mistake
[50:23] even to god to repent to christ they're
[50:25] going to live in a prison of their own
[50:27] self-justification
[50:29] i read a book one time and it was
[50:33] i believe the title was mistakes were
[50:36] made but not by me
[50:38] and that's just maybe a perfect
[50:39] autobiography for all of us
[50:43] and if i remember correctly this is
[50:45] where i found these statements
[50:47] just listen to how the scientists or the
[50:50] uh the behavioral economics would
[50:53] address the way someone would be
[50:54] thinking and acting
[50:56] and how they've identified this bias
[50:58] within a human
[51:00] says as fallible human beings all of us
[51:03] share the impulse to justify ourselves
[51:06] and to avoid taking responsibility for
[51:09] any actions that turn out to be harmful
[51:11] or immoral all of us have this
[51:14] so jack one of the youngest here has
[51:17] this impulse in his heart all of the all
[51:19] the young children that are here today
[51:21] they have this impulse from birth and
[51:23] all of us as adults and
[51:24] young husbands and and whether it be
[51:26] grandparents whatever stage you are in
[51:28] life
[51:28] we all as human beings fallible human
[51:31] beings amen fallible
[51:33] folly who means we all share the same
[51:35] impulse to justify ourselves it's an
[51:37] instinct it's an impulse
[51:40] and to avoid taking responsibility for
[51:42] any actions that turn out to be harmful
[51:44] or immoral and then they they
[51:47] examine these different instances of
[51:50] corporate greed and corruption and
[51:52] different things and you find sometimes
[51:54] that somebody would do something you're
[51:56] like
[51:56] that person was really an upright guy
[51:59] you never would have thought they would
[52:00] end it up that way and how does a man of
[52:02] that integrity and how does a person who
[52:04] seem to be so honest and that decent
[52:06] person
[52:07] how does he end up in corruption and and
[52:11] moral decay so they ask the question how
[52:13] do you get an
[52:14] honest man to lose his ethical compass
[52:18] how do you get an honest man to to begin
[52:20] to vary from what he knows is right
[52:22] he says they say this you get him to
[52:24] take one step at a time
[52:27] and self-justification will do the rest
[52:34] how does how does someone become corrupt
[52:36] how does someone become immoral
[52:37] how does someone become hardened and
[52:38] perverse all it takes is one step
[52:40] at a time and as they self-justify
[52:44] they're never able to remedy they're
[52:46] never able to correct
[52:48] they're never able to come back and say
[52:50] you know what i shouldn't have done that
[52:52] they self-justify and say you know what
[52:53] it was okay for me to do that look what
[52:55] it produced
[52:56] or you know what i know maybe i cut a
[52:58] little bit on this but you know what i
[53:00] did it for this
[53:00] and as they make excuses and
[53:02] self-justified they get caught up
[53:04] and it just snowballs and they're saying
[53:05] that self-justification will do the rest
[53:07] just vary just a little bit
[53:09] and self-justification will do the rest
[53:13] they say mindless self-justification
[53:15] like quicksand can draw us deeper into
[53:16] disaster
[53:18] it blocks our ability to even see our
[53:21] errors
[53:22] let alone correct them
[53:24] self-justification will blind you to
[53:26] your own heirs
[53:27] let alone being able to correct them you
[53:28] won't even be able to see them
[53:30] it distorts reality keeping us from
[53:32] getting all the information we need
[53:34] and assessing issues clearly this is
[53:38] very instructive just to our
[53:39] interpersonal relationships the dynamics
[53:41] and family our dynamics with fringe
[53:43] uh with whether it be friends or
[53:44] employers employees
[53:46] this this mechanism this human mechanism
[53:48] of self-justification
[53:50] is destructive and when one engages in
[53:54] this
[53:54] this uh self-justification when you've
[53:57] done
[53:58] something wrong and you instinctively
[54:02] they call it mindless self-justification
[54:04] they say it draws you deeper into
[54:06] disaster
[54:07] it blocks you from seeing your air so it
[54:08] blocks you from correcting your air
[54:10] so that when you've done something wrong
[54:13] if if
[54:14] a message comes and i want to call it
[54:17] truth because if you've done wrong
[54:19] truth or right is what's going to expose
[54:22] your error so when light comes to show
[54:23] that you've done something wrong
[54:25] if you engage in self-justification
[54:28] truth becomes your enemy
[54:31] and think about that you're in air
[54:34] and there's truth that's trying to make
[54:36] you right but
[54:37] self-justification turns a truth into
[54:39] your enemy and so you actually begin to
[54:41] fight
[54:42] against truth when it tries to correct
[54:44] you
[54:46] and the very truth becomes your enemy
[54:47] you're in denial you don't want to
[54:49] believe it's true you begin to engage in
[54:50] self-justification
[54:51] and you'll actually have a way of
[54:53] thinking through something rationalizing
[54:55] and building support for it till you can
[54:57] finally take a truth and turn it into a
[54:59] lie
[54:59] and be justified in doing it that's very
[55:03] very dangerous thought process
[55:05] it's a very dangerous human instinct
[55:07] human impulse
[55:08] as they placed it as fallible human
[55:10] beings we all have this impulse to
[55:11] justify ourselves
[55:13] and this is the very impulse that was it
[55:16] may be instinctively welled up within
[55:17] this lawyer
[55:18] when maybe he's feeling somewhat exposed
[55:20] and jesus says well hey if you're doing
[55:22] all that
[55:22] then you're doing well you'll live
[55:24] you'll live right you'll live into life
[55:26] thou shalt live
[55:27] and now he says well who is my neighbor
[55:31] and it was because he was wanting to
[55:33] justify himself
[55:35] so the question was for the purpose of
[55:37] self-justification
[55:40] if you turn to john chapter 12 i want to
[55:42] look at another question here
[55:55] just to understand this how these
[55:58] questions are fraught with
[56:00] uh uh eleven and and a false motive
[56:04] and it's it's telling the story when
[56:06] mary we fell at the feet of jesus and
[56:09] she broke open and it's descriptive here
[56:11] but just imagine this scene then took
[56:13] mary a pound of ointment a spikenard
[56:17] now those of you who you know are into
[56:20] your essential oils i don't know
[56:22] how many bottles you'd need for a pound
[56:25] of any essential oil i don't know if
[56:27] doterra is heavier than young living
[56:29] i don't know if any one of them have a
[56:30] pound of rose essential
[56:32] oils but this is a lot
[56:37] could we all agree a pound
[56:40] i mean you just think as much as as dry
[56:43] as it's been i
[56:44] you know i put a big glob of lotion on
[56:46] and it's i think it's young living you
[56:48] know and just trying to sit there and
[56:49] get
[56:50] get the lotion in and you get just a
[56:51] little bit like okay maybe that was a
[56:52] little bit too much
[56:53] and we're talking something that
[56:54] wouldn't even register on the scale
[56:57] not even an ounce but yet now here is a
[57:00] pound of ointment and the bible wants
[57:02] you to know
[57:03] very costly this wasn't a cheap thing
[57:06] very costly and anointed the feet of
[57:08] jesus
[57:08] and wiped his feet with her hair and the
[57:10] house was filled with the odor of the
[57:12] ointment
[57:14] and now we we sat on the the right side
[57:17] of this we view this and we don't have
[57:19] any instinct within us to think oh my
[57:21] goodness what was she thinking
[57:22] we could just make okay a pound of
[57:23] ointment that's a lot very costly okay
[57:25] it's for jesus
[57:26] it's worth every penny right that's
[57:28] that's what we would be thinking
[57:30] but yet then said one of his disciples
[57:32] judas iscariot simon's son which should
[57:34] betray him and thank you john for
[57:36] nailing down this guy just exactly who
[57:38] he was he says in verse 5
[57:41] why was not this ointment sold for 300
[57:44] pence and given to the poor
[57:48] now if we could somehow enter into that
[57:50] very moment
[57:52] that mary is taking a pound of ointment
[57:55] very costly dumping it on his feet and
[57:58] the whole house is filled with the smell
[58:00] of it
[58:01] and then have judas who he would have
[58:03] respected say
[58:04] why was not this ointment sold for 300
[58:06] pence in other words we could have
[58:08] sold this excess ointment for 300 pins
[58:10] taken that 300 pens
[58:12] and given it to the poor and i without a
[58:15] doubt i'm sure that all of us would have
[58:16] agreed this was a very valid question
[58:19] and it would seem as if his question is
[58:22] sincere
[58:23] that judas is watching he's not
[58:25] questioning worship he's
[58:27] he's questioning the extravagance of it
[58:29] he's he's questioning
[58:30] how far it's being expressed this seems
[58:32] to be really extreme and
[58:33] but you do you really have to go that
[58:35] far it's oh what's on the inside that
[58:37] counts and
[58:38] do you really have to pour that much out
[58:39] do you really have to sacrifice that
[58:41] much
[58:41] and just think that's kind of the same
[58:43] questions we're asked sometimes why do
[58:44] you have to
[58:45] dress that way and why do you have the
[58:46] token in your home applied that way
[58:48] why do you go to that why do you go to
[58:49] church twice and why do you go live
[58:51] three times
[58:51] why do you do this why did you do that
[58:53] there's a lot of questions they're
[58:54] asking there's a way that it can be
[58:55] framed where it seems well that seems
[58:56] pretty logical that seems pretty sincere
[58:59] and 300 pence was a yearly wage for a
[59:02] working man then
[59:05] it was it was enough to maintain a
[59:07] household for
[59:08] one year so when
[59:12] when uh judah says we could have sold
[59:14] that for 300 pence i mean you had people
[59:16] going wait a minute what
[59:18] you could live a whole year off that you
[59:19] could maintain a household of that and
[59:20] judas might said yeah i've got an idea
[59:22] that what we could have done is we could
[59:23] actually could have supported 12
[59:25] different families
[59:26] one month at a time or we could have
[59:28] broken it we could have given this many
[59:29] and be thinking wow this seems very
[59:31] logical
[59:33] she gave worship to christ to such a
[59:36] degree i mean just a little bit would
[59:37] have been worship right
[59:38] just enough to get the feet wet just
[59:41] enough to show that i'm i'm interested
[59:43] i'm here i'm doing it and it would have
[59:44] seemed
[59:45] logical and it would have provoked maybe
[59:46] serious discussion at the time of what
[59:48] justice is and
[59:49] and value and morality and judas would
[59:52] have made a very strong case we could
[59:53] have all agreed listen we're not asking
[59:55] her not to worship
[59:56] and we're not asking her not to anoint
[59:58] his feet with oil but we could have
[1:00:00] better use of this oil
[1:00:01] we could support the poor for a year we
[1:00:04] could start a program and get matching
[1:00:06] donations and we could do a lot more
[1:00:08] with this substance
[1:00:09] than what this one woman is doing to the
[1:00:11] feet of jesus and it could have appealed
[1:00:13] to our uh
[1:00:14] our our passion could have appealed to
[1:00:16] our feeling it could have appealed to
[1:00:17] our humanity and we could have all been
[1:00:19] like you know what the right thing to do
[1:00:21] is to never let another person do this
[1:00:22] again and you look at it and what would
[1:00:24] have we been doing in the end
[1:00:26] we would have been questioning one's
[1:00:27] worship of christ and questioning the
[1:00:29] value of worship
[1:00:30] to the one who alone deserves it but it
[1:00:33] seems logical it's a logical question
[1:00:35] it's a
[1:00:35] seems to be a very fair question but
[1:00:38] then the
[1:00:38] the writer john helps us to understand
[1:00:41] this verse six
[1:00:42] this he said he asked why don't we
[1:00:46] we could have sold this for 300 pence
[1:00:48] supported a family for a year
[1:00:51] he asked that not that he cared for the
[1:00:53] poor
[1:00:54] but because he was the thief and had the
[1:00:57] bag
[1:00:58] and bear what was put therein oh my
[1:01:02] just exposes it now you would have
[1:01:04] thought that
[1:01:05] judas was asking because he cared for
[1:01:06] the poor this prudent question this
[1:01:08] valid question what about
[1:01:10] justice what about morality what about
[1:01:12] doing what is right
[1:01:13] and he didn't ask because he cared about
[1:01:15] the poor he asked because that 300 pence
[1:01:18] would have been put into a bag
[1:01:19] that he had his hand in he had selfish
[1:01:23] motive he had gained his own personal
[1:01:26] gain in mind
[1:01:27] in the same way the lawyer's question of
[1:01:30] jesus was with the wrong motive and with
[1:01:32] air in his heart
[1:01:33] judas asked the question not sincerely
[1:01:35] not for altruistic purposes
[1:01:37] not because he really cared about the
[1:01:38] poor but because he wanted to gain
[1:01:40] personally from it
[1:01:41] and the lawyer questioned jesus with air
[1:01:43] in his heart
[1:01:44] the same way judas questioned this
[1:01:46] worship of mary
[1:01:47] he questioned with air in his heart
[1:01:50] so jesus's answer will answer the
[1:01:53] question
[1:01:54] but also correct the heart the answer
[1:01:57] that jesus gives
[1:01:59] will not only help us to understand
[1:02:01] who's my neighbor
[1:02:02] but he answers it in a way to be sure if
[1:02:05] there's any prejudice if there's any
[1:02:07] bias
[1:02:07] if there's any self-justification if
[1:02:09] there's any wrong view of self
[1:02:11] if there's any wrong view of others it's
[1:02:13] got to be broken down
[1:02:15] and it's got to be taken away
[1:02:18] so we are asking i'm asking who is my
[1:02:20] neighbor
[1:02:22] not asking to justify myself not we're
[1:02:24] not asking to justify ourselves
[1:02:26] but to understand our duty if i could
[1:02:29] say it this way to a church to
[1:02:30] understand our role as a church
[1:02:33] because we must resist these these
[1:02:36] impulses we must resist these carnal
[1:02:38] mechanisms
[1:02:39] that create a culture that's contrary to
[1:02:42] christ
[1:02:44] it's very easy to have cliques it's very
[1:02:46] easy to have a culture it's very easy
[1:02:48] to begin to conduct ourselves in a way
[1:02:50] that becomes insular and then other
[1:02:51] people can ever feel that they're a part
[1:02:53] of it
[1:02:53] and then our attitudes begin we begin to
[1:02:55] judge others based upon the paradigm
[1:02:57] that we create within our own culture
[1:02:59] and we're no longer seeing others
[1:03:01] correctly
[1:03:02] and it's the worst place to get as an
[1:03:04] individual it'd be the worst place to
[1:03:06] get as an organization
[1:03:07] even if you start looking at corporate
[1:03:09] culture and it's not something that god
[1:03:11] wants to bless we've got to resist
[1:03:13] these carnal mechanisms that cause us to
[1:03:16] create cultures that are contrary to
[1:03:17] christ
[1:03:21] and i believe that as the bride of
[1:03:22] christ we can do this from a position of
[1:03:24] strength
[1:03:26] all too often defense mechanisms are
[1:03:29] born from weakness
[1:03:31] are born from insecurities born from
[1:03:33] complexes
[1:03:35] born from the idea that you think you're
[1:03:37] better but you're afraid somebody else
[1:03:38] is better than you
[1:03:39] so you've got to come up with ways to
[1:03:40] look bigger to look stronger to look
[1:03:42] taller
[1:03:43] this isn't the wizard of oz we don't
[1:03:45] have to come with lights and shows and
[1:03:47] some other ways to make ourselves seem
[1:03:48] great and
[1:03:50] powerful and mighty in dynamic we want
[1:03:52] to be ourselves
[1:03:53] and from a position of strength humble
[1:03:55] ourselves to minister to all
[1:03:58] you can do that because of who you are
[1:04:01] you can humble yourself to become a
[1:04:02] servant to all you can humble yourself
[1:04:04] to serve others you can do it because of
[1:04:07] who you are not because of what you're
[1:04:08] not
[1:04:08] not because of what you lack but because
[1:04:10] of who you are in christ you can have
[1:04:12] confidence that i can serve without
[1:04:14] compromise
[1:04:15] that i can love others and i can do good
[1:04:17] unto others and i can do it good unto
[1:04:19] all
[1:04:19] and not just the household of faith but
[1:04:21] do good unto all and treat others
[1:04:23] how others ought to be treated and not
[1:04:25] be afraid that somehow i'm sending mixed
[1:04:27] signals and i'm
[1:04:28] watering down what i believe we can from
[1:04:30] a position of strength
[1:04:32] love our neighbor as ourselves and do so
[1:04:36] without compromise
[1:04:39] i want to read this statement i realize

[1:04:42] longer than i thought i would

[1:04:47] closing
[1:04:49] brother branham's talking about being in
[1:04:51] new york city again and we had mentioned
[1:04:53] that how he was with brother berg and
[1:04:55] see that great big building now in the
[1:04:57] message paradox in february of 64. he
[1:04:59] says a few weeks ago in our meetings in
[1:05:00] new york city
[1:05:01] i come out one night from morris
[1:05:03] auditorium and we were walking down the
[1:05:04] street my son and i
[1:05:07] and we looked upon the people they're
[1:05:08] just thousands men with hair like women
[1:05:10] you know
[1:05:12] what they call ratted earrings leotards
[1:05:14] on
[1:05:15] men and women together and a poor old
[1:05:16] woman fell on the street
[1:05:19] he says nobody picked her up just went
[1:05:23] on
[1:05:23] see there's thousands of people in new
[1:05:25] york city and these are new yorkers
[1:05:28] and here one of their own you just
[1:05:29] suspect if she has groceries with her
[1:05:32] maybe she's one of their own they're in
[1:05:34] new york city a poor old woman fell on
[1:05:35] the street
[1:05:36] nobody picked her up just went on and i
[1:05:38] helped her get her oranges
[1:05:41] this is a visitor this is an outsider
[1:05:44] and i helped her get her oranges and
[1:05:45] picked her up like that old thing about
[1:05:46] 70 years old
[1:05:47] and she looked at me real strange and
[1:05:50] went down the street
[1:05:51] i spoke to the cab driver about he said
[1:05:53] mister when anybody comes to new york
[1:05:55] and acts like they're in the right mind
[1:05:57] we know he's a stranger
[1:06:01] he said them are good people but they
[1:06:03] just get into that swing
[1:06:06] think of this talking about something
[1:06:09] saying these are good people they go to
[1:06:10] new york they're good people
[1:06:12] but they get into that swing you take a
[1:06:14] man that comes here
[1:06:15] it isn't long till he's in that same
[1:06:17] condition he comes in here try to do
[1:06:19] everything
[1:06:19] you could lay there and die on that
[1:06:21] street and a heart attack somebody would
[1:06:23] think he was drunk they'd never touch
[1:06:24] you
[1:06:24] let you lay there and dying and then
[1:06:26] brother says see they don't mean to be
[1:06:28] that way
[1:06:29] it's just getting in the swing
[1:06:33] he said them again good people they just
[1:06:35] get into that swing
[1:06:37] just a way of thinking a way of life
[1:06:41] a mode a method and before you know it
[1:06:43] it becomes your thought process
[1:06:46] he says that's the way we do brethren in
[1:06:48] our church life
[1:06:49] we get into a swing of one certain creed
[1:06:52] or one certain thing and there we stay
[1:06:54] we swing with the rest of them we swing
[1:06:57] with our organization
[1:06:58] we swing with our community it's just
[1:07:01] natural
[1:07:02] paint your steps red and watch what your
[1:07:03] neighbor does they'll do it too
[1:07:06] one of you sisters get a certain kind of
[1:07:07] dress or a hat watch what your neighbor
[1:07:09] does
[1:07:09] it's an impersonation now it's
[1:07:12] it's not your neighbors it's your
[1:07:14] followers right post something on
[1:07:16] instagram or pinterest and everybody's
[1:07:17] like oh i got to get that too
[1:07:19] honey find me some mason jars find me
[1:07:21] some burlap i want to
[1:07:23] do something trendy hey because you see
[1:07:26] somebody else do it and you want to do
[1:07:28] it
[1:07:28] he says it's an impersonation he says
[1:07:30] it's a matching time
[1:07:32] we don't care whether our trousers match
[1:07:34] our coats
[1:07:35] we want our experience to match the word
[1:07:39] i don't care if our trousers match our
[1:07:40] coats we want our experience to match
[1:07:43] the word we don't want to get caught in
[1:07:46] the swing
[1:07:47] them are good people they just get into
[1:07:49] that swing
[1:07:51] it's just getting that swing so that's
[1:07:52] the way we do in our church life we got
[1:07:54] to be careful
[1:07:55] that we just don't get into a swing
[1:07:57] don't get into a way
[1:07:59] of thinking and a way of acting toward
[1:08:01] brother brown says here's a woman that
[1:08:02] fell in the street
[1:08:04] nobody would pick her up and then when
[1:08:06] he did
[1:08:07] she looked at him like he was funny you
[1:08:10] know i wouldn't mind if we begin to get
[1:08:11] funny looks
[1:08:13] because we're treating people with
[1:08:14] decency treat people with integrity
[1:08:17] we're treating people correctly we could
[1:08:19] just bow our heads
[1:08:21] hey you could just stand to your feet
[1:08:27] maybe if our sister could play i want to
[1:08:30] live the way he wants me to live
[1:08:33] let's just make this our prayer tonight
[1:08:35] lord don't let me get in the wrong
[1:08:38] swing i don't want to get into that
[1:08:41] swing where i'm not
[1:08:42] sensitive to other people and how
[1:08:45] they're hurting
[1:08:48] i don't want to be so caught up in
[1:08:49] whether my trousers match my pants and
[1:08:51] what color my steps are
[1:08:53] what kind of dress and hat i've got on
[1:08:56] the lord i want to be sensitive to how
[1:08:57] my brother's feeling
[1:09:00] i want to be sensitive to how somebody
[1:09:01] else is feeling
[1:09:03] maybe that'd be our prayer lord tonight
[1:09:05] don't let me get into the wrong swing
[1:09:08] and we could pray this as a church lord
[1:09:11] help us to know really

[1:09:35] it
[1:09:36] how can we lord as we're talking as a
[1:09:39] family last night
[1:09:40] how can we hate our brother whom we've
[1:09:43] seen

[1:09:47] seen
[1:09:48] how can we lord be foul and crude and
[1:09:51] vile and hateful and spiteful towards
[1:09:54] fellow man whom we see
[1:09:56] and claim the love of god that we have
[1:10:00] not seen

[1:10:33] greater mankind lord this is just
[1:10:35] loving the way that you would want us to
[1:10:37] love this is living how you would want
[1:10:39] us to live

[1:10:43] bitterness and having animosity
[1:10:45] lord this is not engaging in hurtful
[1:10:48] conduct lord and words that tear down
[1:10:50] but lord may we
[1:10:51] build up may we edify may we do it from
[1:10:54] a position of strength lord
[1:10:56] believing in this hour that we have the
[1:10:58] balm lord that this world needs
[1:11:00] believing that we have the light that
[1:11:01] our neighbors need the light that our
[1:11:03] family needs lord
[1:11:04] the the love that those that are hurting
[1:11:06] need lord

[1:11:20] them to a word that mends broken hearts
[1:11:23] that sets people on the right path
[1:11:27] and brings them to a solid place of
[1:11:28] assurance
