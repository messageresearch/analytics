[0:00] Ruth chapter 1. I'm going to read two
[0:02] verses, verses 14 and 15. And just
[0:06] looking out. It looks like we're pretty
[0:09] much all home, folks. So, I'm just going
[0:10] to have that liberty just to jump right
[0:12] in into the subject matter and not
[0:14] feeling that there needs to be a lot of
[0:16] connecting of the parts to understand
[0:18] just exactly where we are um in this
[0:22] subject of the bread of life. And we're
[0:24] going to be approaching a showdown. The
[0:27] title is a showdown. Uh I thought maybe
[0:30] there might be a couple parts to it. So
[0:31] in my notes I jotted down part one. Uh
[0:34] it's very possible that the the burden
[0:36] may just be delivered in this particular
[0:38] service. Ruth chapter 1 14 and 15. And
[0:42] they that's speaking of Orpa. And Ruth
[0:46] lifted up their voice and wept again.
[0:49] They had already done so in verse 9 uh
[0:52] when Naomi kind of encourages them to go
[0:55] back to Moab. This time there's another
[0:57] weeping and a lifting up of the voice
[0:59] and then a very two very distinct
[1:02] actions and Orpa kissed her
[1:04] mother-in-law but Ruth clave unto her.
[1:08] Now catch this image of now Ruth
[1:12] cleaving holding to and you know
[1:15] desiring not to be separated from her
[1:17] mother-in-law. And the mother-in-law
[1:18] says, Naomi says, "And she said, behold,
[1:21] thy sister-in-law has gone back under
[1:23] her people and under her gods. Return
[1:25] thou after thy sister-in-law." Now, what
[1:28] a what a challenge to her. Return thou
[1:31] after thy sister-in-law. You can take
[1:33] your seats.
[1:37] Now, as we are as we as we focused on
[1:41] this this book of Ruth in the context of
[1:43] the bread of life and this tremendous
[1:45] type that it holds for us today, we were
[1:49] kind of narrow just wanting to examine
[1:52] very particularly each verse and even
[1:54] the meanings of names and particular
[1:55] situations and and some of the dynamics
[1:58] that are historical when we look at the
[2:00] book book of Ruth, but um foreshadowing
[2:03] for us as the bride of Jesus Christ and
[2:05] really opens up a lot of truths
[2:07] uh to begin to understand the time that
[2:09] we're living in. And since IMC had
[2:13] traveled to Moab with his family, we
[2:14] kind of looked at what Moab represented
[2:16] and we identified that it was a
[2:18] condition. This is a backslim
[2:22] and that while there um in Moab, Ruth is
[2:26] going to come out with Naomi. So, it
[2:28] wasn't so much uh how it related to, but
[2:31] it represented the condition that Ruth
[2:33] as a type of the bride is called out of.
[2:35] And then as we saw the the Lord visiting
[2:38] his people and giving bread uh to
[2:40] Israel, that's the signal to Naomi to
[2:43] return back to Bethlehem Judah. And as
[2:46] she begins to depart, both Ruth and Orpa
[2:48] are traveling together with her. But
[2:50] then it comes to a particular place
[2:52] where Orpa decides to go back. And we
[2:55] recognize that as Orpa uh has this
[2:57] particular characterization in the
[2:59] scripture represents something that kind
[3:01] of signaled the opposition that Ruth was
[3:04] going to face in choosing to go all the
[3:05] way with Naomi. So Moab is the
[3:08] condition. Orpa represent represented
[3:10] the opposition. And both are challenges
[3:15] to Ruth, things that she's going to have
[3:16] to overcome, things she's going to have
[3:18] to face in coming to Bethlehem and
[3:20] coming to her kinsman redeemer. And both
[3:23] uh both Moab and Orpa represent the
[3:26] Leodysian condition. And in this Leo
[3:30] Leodysian condition, it's reflective of
[3:31] a spirit and an appetite of the age that
[3:34] we live in. Things that they want,
[3:36] things that they desire, the way that
[3:37] they look. And um Luke chapter, excuse
[3:40] me, Revelations chapter 3, uh verses 17
[3:42] and 18 has been quoted quite often just
[3:45] in the the beginning of this church as a
[3:47] lot of themes have revolved around the
[3:49] time that we're living and the
[3:50] opposition that we faced.
[3:52] and Orpa. I'm just maybe summarizing
[3:55] some key terms that Brother Vanam used.
[3:57] And these are this is the way that
[3:58] brother Brandham characterized Orpa. He
[4:01] called he he characterized her as the
[4:02] modern church, the formal church, the
[4:04] lukewarm church. And then when we begin
[4:06] to look at the condition of this
[4:08] Leodysian church, the modern church, the
[4:10] lukewarm church, they have what he
[4:12] called undisguised hostility towards the
[4:15] elect. And this this orper represents
[4:18] this hatred and persecution. And he says
[4:20] they make they make make fun of the
[4:22] bride of Jesus Christ. So this is the
[4:25] way that that Orpa spirit operates. It's
[4:27] critical. It persecutes. It has shows
[4:29] hostility. It has a hatred and even goes
[4:31] so far as to try to kill the influence
[4:33] of something. And really if we if we
[4:35] thought about that why would you want to
[4:37] kill the influence of something? Uh it's
[4:39] because you would perceive it as a
[4:40] threat. Or if it's healthy, if it's
[4:42] vital, then maybe it really serves um to
[4:45] tear down and to destroy uh something
[4:47] that you're trying to do. It represents
[4:49] a threat to your kingdom. And that's why
[4:51] in the scripture when Gia had the uh the
[4:54] attitude, you know, leave it alone. If
[4:56] it's not of God, it'll come to nothing.
[4:57] But if it's of God, you don't want to be
[4:59] fighting against it. And so, there's
[5:01] wisdom in that. There's this overt
[5:03] persecution, this overt criticism, this
[5:06] undisguised hostility to stand against
[5:08] something and and fight against
[5:10] something, not a spirit, but a people
[5:12] and a truth or or in this case the bride
[5:15] is done from this position of an orpa
[5:18] spirit. And where we ended last time,
[5:21] and I I really want to emphasize this
[5:23] now because we're really moving on from
[5:25] the Orpa condition and the Orpa
[5:27] opposition to a showdown. The lesson
[5:31] that we learned in looking at Orpa, it's
[5:34] and looking at her characteristics and
[5:35] identifying how the message of the hour
[5:37] places that lukewarm formal Leodysian
[5:40] church. It's not an exercise in
[5:43] identifying our persecutors.
[5:45] Okay? It's not an exercise in being able
[5:47] to identify who the orpas are in our
[5:49] lives, but an admonishment to us to not
[5:51] be one.
[5:53] If we could just kind of take that as,
[5:54] well, brother Aaron, what was your whole
[5:56] point in talking about Orpa? Um, should
[5:58] we have like a little a little place in
[5:59] the church directory, the ORPAS? Um, I
[6:02] was joking with brother Michael, we
[6:03] should have an index of we have Arizona
[6:05] believers church and we have Arizona
[6:07] Makeelievers Church. And you just have
[6:09] these two different indexes in a in a
[6:11] church directory. You know, they went
[6:13] out from us because they were not of us
[6:15] uh section. And and that's never that's
[6:17] never the exercise when you begin to
[6:19] look into the word of God. So, you could
[6:21] take somebody and try to place them in a
[6:23] box and say, "Well, this is your end,
[6:25] buddy. This is who you are." Uh, I'm not
[6:27] going to call you brother. It's just
[6:28] mister from this point on. No. Uh,
[6:31] that's not our call. That's not what we
[6:33] do. When we look at the the the
[6:35] characteristics of Orpa, it's not so
[6:38] that we would have a template to be able
[6:39] to recognize all the Orpas in our lives,
[6:41] but it primarily admonish ourselves to
[6:44] never be one.
[6:46] And that that's the real thrust because
[6:48] we want to challenge ourselves with the
[6:49] truth that the new birth does not have a
[6:52] persecution gene. Amen.
[6:55] You recognize that the new birth does
[6:57] not have a persecution gene in it. And
[6:59] so if we persecute, if we're critical,
[7:01] if we're harsh, if we have any kind of
[7:03] open or even undisguised passive
[7:05] aggressive hostility towards somebody,
[7:07] that's more reflective of your first
[7:09] birth because there's not a persecution
[7:11] gene in the new birth. And therefore, I
[7:15] think it it's uh that ministers grace to
[7:17] us because we can be very very strict
[7:19] and legalistic with the word that if at
[7:20] any time you exhibit a characteristic
[7:22] that's contrary to the characteristics
[7:24] of Christ, a lot of people just say,
[7:26] "Well, you're not born again. You need
[7:27] to be born again." And this time, let me
[7:29] baptize you so that you're one of my
[7:31] sheep, one of my converts. And it kind
[7:32] of creates this uncertainty and this
[7:34] instability. But let's just look at it
[7:36] this way that if there is a weakness in
[7:38] the flesh to persecute, to be critical,
[7:41] to to tear down and to have this
[7:44] undisguised hostility, this open or even
[7:46] disguised hostility that that's more a
[7:49] function of our flesh, not the the the
[7:51] soul that we have as believers because
[7:53] when we were born again, we did not
[7:55] inherit a persecution gene. Now, I I
[7:59] want to just let's read verses 14 and 15
[8:01] again. And that'll kind of help me um uh
[8:05] re refocus a little bit on where we want
[8:07] to go with this. And I have a two
[8:09] statements to read at the very beginning
[8:11] that set the tone for what I'm looking
[8:13] at on a showdown. Says, "And they lifted
[8:16] up their voice and wept again. And Orpa
[8:18] kissed her roof clave unto her. And she
[8:22] said, behold, thy sister-in-law is gone
[8:24] back unto her people and unto her gods.
[8:27] Return thou after thy sister-in-law."
[8:30] Now when Orpa now is manifesting
[8:32] herself, she's making her decision and
[8:35] Orpa has decided at the behest of Naomi.
[8:37] Just kind of this push or this
[8:38] discouragement from Naomi to go back to
[8:41] Moab. Now we recognize just what a
[8:44] terrible decision this is for Orpa
[8:46] because we we're told in the word that
[8:48] she's excommunicated.
[8:50] She's kind of becomes very insignificant
[8:52] now in the word. She's never mentioned
[8:53] again. Orpa only stands within the book
[8:55] of Ruth as at this moment when she
[8:57] kisses her mother-in-law goodbye. She
[9:00] now returns back into obscurity, back
[9:02] into unbelief, back into Moab. And so we
[9:04] don't we see her now sealing her
[9:06] testimony as this make believer and as
[9:08] one that won't go all the way. But then
[9:10] Ruth begins to express this instinct to
[9:13] cleave to Naomi. And and I was pondering
[9:16] this to be an emphasis tonight, but I
[9:19] and it's still just real fresh in my in
[9:21] my burden. So I'll just say it now here
[9:24] at the outset, though I won't be
[9:25] amplifying this. When Ruth cleaves to
[9:27] Naomi, she really has nothing uh nothing
[9:30] to go by other than just this. She's
[9:33] justified by her faith.
[9:34] That she she she justifies herself
[9:37] because this is instinctive. This is
[9:38] what she believes. This is what she
[9:40] knows is right. And when she begins to
[9:42] express the things that she does in
[9:44] verse 16 and verse 17, it's really just
[9:47] something that's pouring forth from her
[9:49] inspiration because Ruth isn't going to
[9:51] be able to tell you what it takes to be
[9:53] become proitized to the Jewish doctrine.
[9:55] She doesn't she doesn't know all the
[9:57] laws. She doesn't know the sacrifices.
[9:58] She doesn't know the laws of redemption.
[10:00] And she's not kind of conspiring ahead
[10:02] of time since look, if we could just go
[10:04] there and find out who the nearer
[10:05] kinsman is, they're responsible and
[10:07] obligated to do this. She's just going
[10:09] with this faith within her heart and
[10:12] that she feels justified in doing this
[10:14] in her heart because she feels this
[10:16] love. And I think we could liken Naomi
[10:19] to even be in that word and that
[10:21] prophecy how Naomi though she represents
[10:24] the backsliden uh Israelite church. We
[10:27] realize that the Israel though she's re
[10:30] she rejects Messiah the gospels first to
[10:33] Israel and then that they bring the
[10:35] gospel to the Gentiles. So, you see how
[10:37] Ruth is being brought in through Naomi,
[10:40] through her faith and belief in
[10:42] following Naomi, but there's a special
[10:44] promise in the end for Ruth and and she
[10:47] is just cleaving now. She's cleaving to
[10:49] Naomi. And then the next statement that
[10:52] that Naomi makes is very surprising
[10:55] because she's already tried to say,
[10:56] "Hey, you know, go back and and and I
[11:00] say maybe in the way I just said it, I
[11:02] think misrepresents it." She's saying,
[11:03] "May the Lord deal kindly with you. May
[11:05] you be blessed." And don't you think
[11:07] you'd be better off in Moab where you
[11:08] can marry again and have children and
[11:11] and please go because I I can't give you
[11:14] what you need and what you deserve and
[11:16] that was enough for Orpa. But now with
[11:18] Ruth cleaving, she becomes maybe a
[11:20] little bit more direct. And this is
[11:22] really going to challenge Ruth. And it's
[11:24] this uh it's this uh um this this
[11:29] statement from Naomi that provokes
[11:32] Ruth's confession. Your God will be my
[11:34] God. your people will be my people. I'll
[11:36] live where you live. I'll die where you
[11:38] live. And it's this very, very
[11:39] significant h passage of scripture. And
[11:43] so Naomi says, "Behold, thy
[11:45] sister-in-law has gone back unto her
[11:46] people and under her God." So look at
[11:48] this example. This is someone that you
[11:50] love, was close to, who is a walked with
[11:53] you, that you shared so much with, and
[11:55] the grieving of a loss of a husband and
[11:58] supporting one another, and you've been
[11:59] there for each other. As you see her
[12:01] return back, behold, look at, recall,
[12:05] bring to mind, see what your
[12:06] sister-in-law is doing. And she's
[12:08] returning to her people and to her God.
[12:10] She's returning back. She's going back.
[12:12] So he says, "Return thou after thy
[12:15] sister, why don't you do the same thing?
[12:18] Why don't you also go back?" Now,
[12:21] brother Brandham in the message and in
[12:23] these two different statements from
[12:24] redeemer redemption and then kinsman
[12:26] redeemer. You'll find that we've been
[12:27] reading a lot of statements from those
[12:29] particular sermons over the last several
[12:31] services. He says but Ruth not so in in
[12:35] the distinction between Orpa and Ruth.
[12:37] And we may have as a matter of fact I
[12:39] think it's the paragraph before this
[12:41] that we've read in great detail. So he's
[12:43] contrasting Ruth to Orpa not so a type
[12:45] of the bride. When her mother-in-law
[12:47] said, "Now Ruth, you return back." She
[12:50] said, "As the Lord liveth, I will not
[12:53] leave you. I will go with you. Your
[12:55] people will be my people. Your God shall
[12:57] be my God. Where you die, I'll die.
[12:59] Where you're buried, I'll be buried."
[13:01] Making her choice. That's where every
[13:03] man has to come to in life sometime is
[13:06] make a decision. You have to make a
[13:09] choice. God's not necessarily going to
[13:12] make it for you. You're going to have to
[13:13] make the choice yourself. You had to
[13:15] make a choice whe whether you were going
[13:17] to have an education or not. You had to
[13:19] make a choice who was going to be your
[13:20] wife. There has to be decisions and
[13:22] choices made in life. And this may be
[13:26] the night that you'll have your final
[13:27] call to make your choice whom you're
[13:29] going to ch serve. So a very challenging
[13:32] uh uh um text, a very
[13:35] causing a person to be introspective and
[13:37] examine where they are. Maybe your final
[13:39] time laying here, dad on the stretcher,
[13:41] your mother over there, young lady. It
[13:43] may be your final time to make your
[13:45] choice. So he's he's identifying this
[13:48] juncture where someone comes into a
[13:50] particular situation and a decision has
[13:53] to be made. And brother Bham talks about
[13:55] in other places you can't stay neutral
[13:57] anymore. Like you have to make your
[13:59] decision. If you leave tonight just
[14:01] saying, "Well, I'll just stay out of
[14:03] it." No, you've already made a choice.
[14:04] You've picked a side by trying to stay
[14:06] out of it. You can't remain neutral any
[14:08] longer. And this is what brother Random
[14:10] is using here in November 19th of 1955.
[14:13] Kind of bringing these people to
[14:15] consider. You have to make a choice
[14:16] tonight. You have to make a decision.
[14:18] You can't just leave the same way you
[14:20] were. God has now obligated you. If you
[14:23] leave, you're going to just try to claim
[14:24] to be willfully ignorant because you
[14:26] don't want to have some sort of
[14:27] knowledge require you to make a
[14:29] decision. But now, you know, you've been
[14:30] informed. You have to make a choice. And
[14:33] and really I think there's just a lot uh
[14:35] that overwhelms me as I ponder this
[14:36] because you come to places in life uh
[14:39] where as a Christian and at different
[14:41] times in your life you seek God and you
[14:42] pray and he tells you what to do. And he
[14:45] really does. Lord, I don't know what to
[14:46] do and I'm not sure what I should do.
[14:48] I've got these three different
[14:48] opportunities. Lord, what should we do?
[14:50] And he just goes bang bang takes two of
[14:52] them down and you only have one left and
[14:54] he gives you kind of that revelation. Go
[14:55] this way. And so in some ways he's he
[14:58] hasn't really necessarily even held your
[14:59] hand. He just kind of drags you through
[15:00] the door you should go through. But
[15:02] there's going to come a time in your
[15:03] life where you're going to be standing
[15:04] there, well, I'm not sure what I should
[15:06] do. I don't know what I'm going to do.
[15:07] And he's going to say, you need to make
[15:08] a choice. And so, it really is a point
[15:10] that all of us come to as Christians and
[15:13] even in our maturity where God is going
[15:15] to allow us to make decisions based upon
[15:17] the word and the word only. Can't be any
[15:21] other parameters, any other
[15:22] circumstance. Say, Lord, I see what your
[15:23] word says. I see what your word
[15:25] requires, and I'm making this decision
[15:27] based upon the word and the word only.
[15:29] Don't worry about what everybody else
[15:30] sees. Because to some people, they can
[15:32] look at a situation, oh, isn't that
[15:34] nice? Isn't that nice? Isn't that
[15:35] precious? Isn't that great? Isn't that
[15:37] wonderful? I wish I had that
[15:39] opportunity. But from where you stand,
[15:41] you see something wrong or you recognize
[15:43] in your heart, this isn't pleasing to
[15:44] the Lord. Or you sense in your spirit, I
[15:47] don't belong or or I need to make this
[15:49] decision or I don't want to take this
[15:50] opportunity. And you're going to be left
[15:52] making a choice.
[15:55] And and and so I want you to recognize
[15:57] that. I'd like for you to recognize that
[15:59] this evening. This is Ruth making a
[16:01] choice. She makes a clear-cut decision.
[16:04] And then he says, "But Ruth, beautiful."
[16:06] Now, notice that there in this
[16:07] statement, "But Ruth, beautiful." He
[16:09] says, "I wish we had time to dig into
[16:13] those old nuggets and bring them out,
[16:15] but we haven't." Now, see how he's re
[16:17] identifying yet again something about
[16:20] this story that there's a revelation
[16:22] that when you catch it, a hidden mystery
[16:24] that when you catch it, a hidden
[16:25] revelation that when you catch it, it'll
[16:26] bring you real close to God. And that he
[16:28] desired that our whole soul and spirit
[16:30] would be held spellbound until we see
[16:32] him, what he is in this story, what he
[16:34] is to you, and how we can receive him
[16:36] and accept him. There's more to this
[16:38] story than, oh yeah, Ruth is the church
[16:40] and Boaz is Christ. He said there's old
[16:43] nuggets and bring, but we haven't. We'll
[16:45] just have to hit the highlights.
[16:48] So, we have time. He didn't have time,
[16:51] but we have time.
[16:52] We have time to take these things that
[16:54] the prophet said, "Hey, mind this out.
[16:56] There's a lot of gold here. Get in
[16:57] there. Dig it out." And he kind of tells
[16:59] you this is the this is the channel that
[17:01] you can dig in. This is the place where
[17:03] you can mine this out. Stay under that
[17:05] where he pointed where he marked it. He
[17:06] marked it and said, "Drill here, you'll
[17:08] find gold." Now, don't go try to go mine
[17:10] your own mind. Don't try to go somewhere
[17:12] and and prospect. No. The prophet has
[17:15] told us where we can be. He hit the
[17:16] highlight. So then we can just go right
[17:18] into this condensed truth and expand it
[17:20] and stay right under this highlight. Now
[17:23] notice how he then amplifies this or
[17:25] highlights this in kinsman redeemer. And
[17:28] he's talking about the orpa spirit. He
[17:30] says a man because of popularity, he
[17:33] can't hold the Bible on it, but because
[17:34] of popularity will kiss the church, kiss
[17:37] the message, kiss Christ goodbye, and go
[17:40] back to where he was hollowed out of.
[17:43] kiss kiss the church, kiss the message,
[17:46] kiss Christ goodbye and go right back to
[17:48] what he said God would call him out of
[17:50] or what God had called him out of. He
[17:52] says orpa lukewarm excommunicated. So
[17:55] this is the representation of Orpa
[17:57] because of popularity, because of
[17:58] pretense, because of politics, because
[18:00] of the social things, which we see how
[18:02] Moab is built around the social aspects
[18:04] of church. a and the pretty feast and
[18:07] the banquetss and the organization and
[18:09] all these all these uh things that
[18:11] enamor the eye orpa is lukewarm because
[18:14] she's lukewarm and holds this popularity
[18:17] she's excommunicated from the blessings
[18:18] of God but then he says but oh how I
[18:21] like that little roof she had to make a
[18:23] decision I had to make a decision you've
[18:25] got to make a decision you'll never walk
[18:27] out of these doors this morning without
[18:29] some kind of decision I'm not
[18:31] foreshadowing that I'll be here till
[18:32] after midnight he says you'll walk out
[18:34] of these doors without you won't walk
[18:36] out without making some kind of
[18:37] decision. You'll not leave this room
[18:39] today. That's a little bit better.
[18:40] Either being a better man or woman or a
[18:42] worse man or woman. Who wants to leave
[18:45] worse
[18:47] then? Then what? Think about it right
[18:49] now. Let's just ponder this. He just
[18:51] said you'll either leave a better man or
[18:53] a worse man.
[18:55] You either leave a better woman or a
[18:56] worse woman. So what does that mean?
[19:00] You're going to leave a better man.
[19:02] What is it? That's the promise I have
[19:04] tonight that when I leave, I'm a better
[19:06] man.
[19:07] What? Can't we just accept that tonight?
[19:09] Can't we just accept it? Lord, I'm
[19:10] leaving tonight a better woman. I'm
[19:12] leaving tonight a better man because I
[19:14] have a choice tonight to leave either
[19:16] worse off or better off. And my
[19:18] goodness, I'm starting to get goosebumps
[19:20] thinking that every time I come to
[19:21] church, I can leave a better man.
[19:24] Why? because my attitude towards the
[19:26] promise and my belief that this is what
[19:29] this is supposed to do.
[19:31] And that's my attitude tonight. I'm
[19:33] going to leave a better man.
[19:35] I want to have that testimony then
[19:37] before my children, before my wife.
[19:39] You're a better man after last night.
[19:41] And that could be our testimony. That
[19:42] could be our desire that we're going to
[19:43] leave a better man or a better woman. He
[19:46] says to reject it, you'll be worse.
[19:48] It'll be harder the next time for you to
[19:50] get it get to it. So this is the real
[19:53] challenge as it's presented. Choose it,
[19:55] accept it, yield to it because the next
[19:56] time you're presented with this
[19:58] opportunity, it'll be harder to lean
[20:00] into it, to yield to it. He says, or
[20:02] you'll go out better. The language that
[20:04] really inspired me as I studied this, it
[20:06] come a showdown in her life.
[20:10] It comes a showdown in everybody's life.
[20:13] So the decision that she had to make,
[20:15] though we could say it's a decision,
[20:16] it's a choice. It's a clear clear-cut
[20:18] decision. He's placing in this context
[20:20] of a showdown. And that just really
[20:22] really struck me. He says Ruth had to
[20:24] make a decision. So the Bible said that
[20:26] her mother-in-law told her, "Go back to
[20:28] your gods like your sister did. Go back
[20:31] like the lukewarm did. Why don't go on
[20:34] back?" This is kind of the challenge.
[20:36] And and it seems to be coming from
[20:38] Naomi. It's something in the word,
[20:39] something in the message that becomes
[20:41] kind of the sticking point or something
[20:43] that kind of says, "Hey, well, why don't
[20:44] you go back? Why don't you kind of
[20:46] change the direction you're going?" It's
[20:47] some controversy, some kind of
[20:49] opposition, something that doesn't seem
[20:51] to be just right. And what is it doing?
[20:52] It's kind of trying to push you to see
[20:54] what you'll do. There's times that we
[20:56] look into the word of God and things
[20:58] don't seem to line up just right. And
[20:59] and and that's a challenge. Well, here's
[21:01] an opportunity for you to say either I
[21:03] believe or you know what, there's
[21:04] nothing to it and walk away from it. And
[21:07] it becomes a challenge.
[21:09] And so it's not just a well, you've got
[21:11] a choice. What would you like, pastrami
[21:13] or turkey? No, this is a showdown.
[21:16] And I know sometimes we get all anxious
[21:17] when we sit down in a restaurant and
[21:19] they say, "Are you ready to take your
[21:20] order?" And all a sudden it feels like a
[21:21] showdown and everybody kind of looks at
[21:22] you like we've given them 12 minutes
[21:25] already. You keep telling to come back.
[21:26] You keep this up, we'll never see them
[21:27] again. And it may feel that pressure,
[21:29] but this is more than that. He says it
[21:31] came a showdown in her life and it comes
[21:34] a showdown in everybody's life. And I
[21:37] was going to call it initially the
[21:38] showdown, but I realized that I I didn't
[21:41] want to place too much significance and
[21:43] emphasis on this particular decision.
[21:46] But there is this becomes a watershed
[21:50] moment for Ruth because from this moment
[21:53] on, she's going on to Christ. From this
[21:57] moment on, the momentum that begins from
[22:00] this moment is going to end in in in
[22:03] conceiving a son and bringing forth a
[22:06] child by Boaz. And so, it's this
[22:09] clear-cut decision that sets things in
[22:11] motion that's going to bring her to a
[22:13] revelation that what she is going to is
[22:16] not just a religion. It's not just a
[22:18] better place. It's not just a hospital
[22:20] or a place to heal. But what she has
[22:22] received is not just another
[22:23] interpretation of the Bible, but this is
[22:26] Christ. This is her Boaz. This is the
[22:29] promised word for her day. And it's
[22:31] going to become a very significant uh um
[22:33] moment for her. And there's going to be
[22:35] subsequent moments where she's
[22:37] recognizing things and she's doing
[22:39] things and she's acting affirmatively.
[22:41] And so we can say this is a showdown in
[22:43] this moment in her life. And it's a
[22:46] challenge. It's a challenge to Ruth
[22:50] to uh to make this decision
[22:55] to
[22:56] will she go back will she follow Orpa
[22:59] back into Moab back into a Moabitete
[23:01] condition or will she go on with Naomi
[23:04] to the promise? This became a real real
[23:06] challenge to her.
[23:08] Now based upon these statements it come
[23:11] a showdown the contrast of how brother
[23:14] Ramsey even identifying how Naomi took
[23:16] Orpa to to bring this contrast and to
[23:19] bring her to a showdown to a challenge.
[23:22] I want to dig into these old nuggets.
[23:25] That's what I want to do. I want to look
[23:26] more into these these nuggets that lay
[23:28] in there based upon the prophet's
[23:30] highlight. So he has highlighted
[23:33] something. and he he's he's identified
[23:34] this strain that we can mine out and he
[23:38] points to a showdown. Now, we know in
[23:40] the word of God that there's going to
[23:43] come a showdown for a bride and it's
[23:44] called a Mount Zion showdown. And he
[23:47] says Jesus will be the showdown.
[23:49] So, there is the showdown. If there's a
[23:52] if we would look at this in type that
[23:53] Ruth is making a decision now, when she
[23:56] makes this decision, she it's she's
[23:58] following Naomi. There's a sincerity
[24:00] there. There's a connection there. She's
[24:02] following Naomi, but ultimately who's
[24:04] she coming to? Boaz.
[24:06] And so it's when she comes to Boaz, you
[24:08] realize he's the showdown between
[24:11] anybody else in that kingdom, anybody
[24:13] else in this story. That becomes that
[24:15] that final separation for Ruth. And now
[24:18] you're now you probably already it's
[24:19] fully becoming aware to you where I'm
[24:21] going with this. that becomes the
[24:23] showdown between Ruth the Moabitete and
[24:25] who she is in the promise
[24:28] and who she is in relation to a
[24:29] redeemer, the kinsman redeemer. And so
[24:31] this Mount Zion showdown, you can go and
[24:33] look at the couple places where brother
[24:34] Bam talks about it in the church age
[24:36] book and then when he mentions it when
[24:38] he's preaching this showdown, this Mount
[24:40] Zion showdown and the three different
[24:41] showdowns that he recognized in the
[24:44] word.
[24:45] Now, we've already referenced this, so I
[24:47] feel like I can uh go back over it. I
[24:49] wanted to go back do it in more detail
[24:51] when we first touched on it. But let's
[24:53] look at this pattern in the scripture
[24:56] and how there is a connection obviously
[24:58] to Lot through Moab, but to Abraham
[25:01] through Naomi and through Bethlehem
[25:03] Judah. And so in Genesis, we've already
[25:06] looked at this in Genesis chapter 19
[25:08] that there was a certain character that
[25:10] was exhibited in Lot, a character
[25:12] exhibited in Lot's daughters, a
[25:14] character that was then expressed in
[25:15] Moab. And there was this nature of Moab
[25:19] that we can identify in Genesis 19. And
[25:22] it's that nature that Ruth has to
[25:24] overcome the condition as we've
[25:25] identified it. And we see how the
[25:27] message of the hour identifies that
[25:29] spirit just the same. We see it coming
[25:30] up later in the context of Israel in
[25:33] their Exodus. But I want to look at this
[25:35] character as is exhibited in Lot. But
[25:38] then also Lot's wife in this thought
[25:41] that brother Brandon brings us to a
[25:42] showdown. It came to a showdown. Now,
[25:46] I'm just going to begin reading in
[25:47] Genesis chapter 19. We're going to read
[25:48] all the way to verse 26, but I'll I'll
[25:51] kind of inject um I'll kind of skip
[25:53] ahead to verse 27 actually at some
[25:54] point. Um so, we're going to be reading
[25:56] verses 15 to 27. And when the morning
[26:00] arose and and I know that you understand
[26:03] just exactly what we're identifying, but
[26:05] the angel has appeared to Abraham, the
[26:07] Lord has appeared to Abraham in in flesh
[26:09] and had this meeting with him. He's
[26:11] discerned the thoughts of of Sarah and
[26:15] he and he told him about this judgment
[26:16] that's to come. And when the morning
[26:18] arose, then the angels hastened lot,
[26:20] saying, "Arise, take thy wife and thy
[26:22] two daughters which are here." We saw
[26:24] this parallel with the two
[26:26] daughter-in-laws which are here, lest
[26:27] thou be consumed in the iniquity of the
[26:29] city. And while he lingered, the men
[26:31] laid hold upon his hand and upon the
[26:33] hand of his wife and upon the hand of
[26:35] his two daughters. So they're they're
[26:37] not really awake, right? Lot and his
[26:40] family are kind. Yeah, who cares? They
[26:42] don't recognize the urgency. The Lord
[26:44] being merciful unto him, and this is the
[26:46] Lord's mercy to drag him out, and they
[26:47] brought him forth and set him without
[26:49] the city. And it came to pass when they
[26:51] had brought them forth abroad that he
[26:53] said, this is the message, escape for
[26:55] thy life. Look not behind thee. This
[26:58] part of the message, don't look behind
[27:00] thee, neither stay thou in all the
[27:02] plain. These are two parts. Now, third
[27:05] part, escape to the mountain, lest thou
[27:07] be consumed. So he says, "Look, don't
[27:09] look behind you. Don't stay in the
[27:11] plane. Go all the way to the mountain."
[27:13] Now here's the lot. Here's the
[27:14] makeeliever. Here he is. Oh, verse 18.
[27:18] Oh, not so, my lord. Behold now thy
[27:20] servant hath found grace in thy sight,
[27:22] and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which
[27:24] thou hast showed unto me and saving my
[27:26] life, and I cannot escape to the
[27:29] mountain, lest some evil take me and I
[27:32] die. He doesn't want to go all the way.
[27:35] He doesn't want to obey the the angel's
[27:38] message, go all the way to the mountain,
[27:39] says saying, "If that's what you want me
[27:40] to do, that's what I'm going to do." He
[27:42] wants to start compromising. Well, I
[27:44] know you want me to go all the way to
[27:46] the mountain, but ah, you know, can't we
[27:48] just settle a little bit here in the
[27:49] plane? And and it's very a very
[27:51] interesting story, very interesting
[27:53] dynamic. So, he says, "Behold now this
[27:55] near to flee unto and is a little one.
[27:58] Oh, let me escape thither. Is it not a
[28:00] little one? And my soul shall live." And
[28:02] the angel says, he said unto him, see, I
[28:04] have accepted thee concerning this thing
[28:05] also, that I will not overthrow this
[28:08] city, for thee which thou hast spoken,
[28:10] because this was one of the five cities
[28:12] that was going to be destroyed with
[28:14] Sodom and Gomorrah. Haste thee, escape
[28:16] thither, for I cannot do anything until
[28:18] thou become thither. So go. This
[28:21] judgment isn't going to fall until you
[28:23] find your place. But remember, they
[28:25] don't have the same promise that Abraham
[28:26] does.
[28:28] And he says, 'There the name of the city
[28:30] was called Zoir. The sun was risen upon
[28:33] the earth when Lot entered into Zoir.
[28:38] It's such a beautiful thing, such a
[28:39] beautiful image that has just come up in
[28:41] verses 22, the end of 22 and the
[28:44] beginning of verse 23. The angel's
[28:45] message was what? Don't stay in the
[28:47] plane, go all the way to the mountain.
[28:50] But Lot rebuffs the the instructions and
[28:52] pleads to stay in Zoar. And zor means
[28:56] insignificance.
[28:59] Go all the way to the mountain.
[29:00] Mountains would represent majesty. And
[29:03] and even with respect to Israel, what
[29:05] did the what did their their uh enemies
[29:07] often say? Well, their god's the god of
[29:09] the mountain. If we can just get him in
[29:10] the plains, just get him in the valleys,
[29:12] we'll be stronger than them. And so,
[29:14] it's something that God identifies
[29:15] himself with. He's there on on Mount Si.
[29:18] He's there showing himself and declaring
[29:20] himself on a mountain in the in the
[29:22] showdowns. What is it? It's three
[29:23] different showdowns. Mount Zion, Mount
[29:26] Carmel, Mount Transfiguration, Mount
[29:28] Zion. So this he's to go all the way to
[29:31] the mountain, but he can't go to the
[29:32] mountain because he's not part of that
[29:34] showdown. He stops though he'll carry on
[29:37] later and go on later. He finds himself
[29:39] a cave, but I and that's where Moab is
[29:42] conceived. But this to me, this is what
[29:45] I want you to recognize. This represents
[29:47] that locked nature, this nature of Moab
[29:49] that the instructions are clear, but he
[29:51] wants to compromise it. And when he
[29:53] does, he pleads to stay in a city that
[29:55] means insignificance.
[29:57] And that is exactly what happens to Orpa
[30:00] when she goes back. She's
[30:01] excommunicated. And brother says she's
[30:03] never mentioned anymore. She takes a
[30:05] place of insignificance in this in the
[30:07] in the economy of God by her own
[30:09] choosing.
[30:11] And so here's Lot choosing to stay in
[30:13] some place that's insignificant
[30:16] in God's language, in God's view. Let me
[30:18] stay here in this insignificance. And
[30:20] what else it says? The sun was risen
[30:22] upon the earth when Lot entered into
[30:24] Zoir. So I want you to notice this
[30:26] beautiful imagery. At the rising of the
[30:28] sun, Lot is entering into
[30:30] insignificance.
[30:33] At the very time that it is the rising
[30:35] of the sun, the church is fading off the
[30:38] scene. She's rejected. She is no longer
[30:41] God's mouthpiece. He is done with her.
[30:43] She is condemned. There's no compliment.
[30:46] Now he stands at the door and knocks and
[30:48] calls the individuals out of the
[30:50] insignificant, condemned, blacked out,
[30:53] rejected church. And here at the rising
[30:56] of the sun, Lot enters into
[30:58] insignificance.
[31:00] Amen.
[31:03] I just just wish there were some pews I
[31:04] could run right now.
[31:10] I'm going to take that as approval to
[31:11] sometime do that if I could try. I might
[31:13] have to practice a little bit. I I I'm
[31:16] drawing a mind blank right now on the
[31:17] pastor who did it, but brother Jason
[31:19] Watkins tells one of the funniest
[31:20] stories. It's funny maybe in retrospect
[31:23] how a brother used to run the pews, one
[31:24] of his first pastors, and he got to
[31:27] running and he went to running the tops
[31:28] of the pews and they got to the back and
[31:30] this young girl kind of hesitated and
[31:31] didn't know where to go. So, she moved
[31:33] and he stepping that way and he missed
[31:35] the step and he broke his leg right in
[31:37] the middle of a message church service.
[31:40] So, he drags I don't know why I'm
[31:42] telling this. We're just home folk
[31:43] tonight. He just drags himself back to
[31:45] the pulpit and he's got a broken leg.
[31:48] So, he's actually in so much pain. He's
[31:50] passing out and he's like, "It's getting
[31:53] dark, church.
[31:55] It's getting dark." Cuz he's passing out
[31:56] and everybody's like, "Oh, hallelujah.
[31:58] Yes, glory. It's dark." That's how I say
[32:00] it. And he completely passes out from
[32:02] the pain.
[32:04] And uh that's why I will not be running
[32:06] the pews if we ever have any. Where in
[32:10] the world am I? make the name of Jesus
[32:13] move.
[32:14] So at the rising of the sun, notice this
[32:17] be can you see the parallel now the time
[32:20] that we're living and the what brother
[32:22] teaches us at this junction in time when
[32:24] it's no longer church he's dealing with
[32:25] the church but now it's the bride in the
[32:28] individual members of the bride at the
[32:29] rising of the sun Lot enters into
[32:31] insignificance at the rising of the sun
[32:33] the church is rejected the bride is
[32:36] coming upon the scene the living bread
[32:38] of life bringing forth the bride and
[32:40] notice verse 27 I think I've got it here
[32:42] notice verse 27 At the same time that
[32:45] Lot is entering into Zoir, Abraham got
[32:48] up early in the morning to the place
[32:50] where he stood before the Lord. At the
[32:53] very same time that Lot enters into
[32:55] insignificance. Now you see this type of
[32:58] coming to the very place where the Lord
[33:01] was revealing himself through flesh. At
[33:03] the very place that he was letting his
[33:05] servant know what he was doing. And I
[33:07] see this beautiful parallel now as Lot
[33:09] the makeeliever enters into that foolish
[33:12] virgin enters into her place and her
[33:15] position and her her her insignificance
[33:17] and she kisses Christ goodbye. She
[33:19] kisses the church goodbye. She goes back
[33:22] to what she was hollowed out of. And at
[33:24] the rising of the sun, Lot finds his
[33:26] place in Zoir. But at the very same
[33:28] time, Abraham's brought to the place
[33:30] where the Lord reveals himself.
[33:34] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Early
[33:37] in the morning at the rising of the sun,
[33:39] he stood in the place where God made
[33:41] himself known.
[33:43] And you know what? There's more nuggets.
[33:47] We could end on that and I think we've
[33:49] got enough that we could chew on for a
[33:50] while. We could have a breakout session
[33:54] and we could have a lot to fellowship
[33:55] on. But let's look at verse 24 as we
[33:57] continue this. Then the Lord now as he
[34:01] makes his way into Zor and now the at
[34:02] the angel's compromise, he says, "Okay,
[34:04] fine. Uh if you make it there, we can we
[34:06] can allow this judgment to unfold. Then
[34:08] the Lord reigned upon Sodom and upon
[34:10] Gomorrah, brimstone and fire from the
[34:12] Lord out of heaven. And he overthrew
[34:15] those cities and all the plain and all
[34:17] the inhabitants of the cities and that
[34:20] which grew upon the ground. So now the
[34:22] judgment is striking. It's falling. And
[34:25] at some point in this process,
[34:28] verse 26, because remember Lot was told
[34:31] to go all the way to the mountain and
[34:33] not stay in the plane. But what does he
[34:35] do? He compromises and he finds his
[34:37] place in this insignificance. But now
[34:39] there's another type that emerges
[34:41] because the the the language also look
[34:44] not behind thee. In verse 17, look not
[34:46] behind thee. And it says in verse 26,
[34:48] but his wife looked back from behind him
[34:51] and she became a pillar of salt.
[34:56] So Lot represents something very
[34:58] significant to us in his contrast to
[35:00] Abraham. As Lot enters into Zor in this
[35:02] insignificance, we see this parallel how
[35:05] that's when the bride comes on the
[35:06] scene. Abraham comes to the place where
[35:08] he stood before the Lord. Now, there's
[35:10] this other representation in Lot's wife.
[35:13] And I don't have this statement in the
[35:15] slides because it's just a very quick
[35:16] one where I just take these
[35:17] characteristics out. Brother Ram says
[35:19] his wife belonged to all the societies
[35:22] in the city, all the stitch and sew
[35:24] parties. I don't know what we would call
[35:26] them today. Anybody want to help me out?
[35:29] I don't know if it's MLMs or if it's I
[35:31] don't know what it would be, but his
[35:33] white belonged to all the societies and
[35:35] all the groups and followed all the
[35:37] influencers on Instagram and whatever it
[35:39] was and belonged to all the the special
[35:41] social things, all the stitch and sew
[35:44] parties and everything else. But she
[35:46] became become to love it.
[35:50] So she loved the social aspects.
[35:53] she there was something she loved about
[35:55] how it made her fit into the the
[35:57] structure of the the society and the
[35:59] social economy and and the status that
[36:02] she received and she gained from um from
[36:04] these different things. And so, Brother
[36:05] Bam's identifying that what caused her
[36:08] to look back was this affinity in her
[36:10] flesh and in her spirit for the things
[36:13] that were carnal. Popularity, the
[36:16] pretense, the politics, right? All these
[36:18] natures of Moab, all these things that
[36:20] come up later at the feast of Belor that
[36:22] entrapp Israel, it's being expressed now
[36:25] in Lot's deci, Lot's wife's decision. I
[36:28] think we said before, I remember one
[36:29] time I preached a sermon, just a really
[36:31] young evangelist, and I preached a
[36:32] sermon and said, "There's only one woman
[36:33] in all the Bible who's mentioned in the"
[36:36] and I was mentioning how there's this
[36:37] woman mentioned in the Old Testament,
[36:38] the New Testament, and besides the Queen
[36:40] of Sheba, there's only one other woman
[36:42] where we don't know her name, and that's
[36:44] Lot's wife. And that was just kind of
[36:46] had what I had gathered from studying
[36:48] the word of God. And I thought, what an
[36:49] interesting parallel. The Queen of
[36:50] Sheba, the Queen of the South. We don't
[36:52] know her name. Old Testament, New
[36:53] Testament. And then you have this
[36:55] contrary example in Lot's wife. Uh she
[36:58] had this type of the the church, a type
[37:00] of the bride. And after I was done, the
[37:01] preacher got up there and said, "Well,
[37:03] we actually know Lot's wife's name." And
[37:04] I was like, "How did I miss that? How
[37:07] did I miss it? I studied the message
[37:09] backwards and forwards how to miss." And
[37:10] I was just feeling really discouraged.
[37:12] She said, "Yeah, her name was Nidita."
[37:14] Cuz she need a lot. You know, she just
[37:16] needed this and needed that. And I was
[37:17] like, "Ah, you're funny. Yeah, got me."
[37:22] And so, Brother Am kind of recognizes
[37:24] that character now in the message
[37:26] communion. And Abraham, this is where we
[37:28] see this this other type that has
[37:30] unfolded. Abraham, a type of the just,
[37:32] he was just he was so concerned about
[37:34] his nephew, a representative of the real
[37:37] true Christian that's tested and tried
[37:39] and been proven.
[37:40] So in Abraham, there was no competition
[37:43] to say, "Oh, you know what? I've kind of
[37:46] always resented Lot when he chose the
[37:48] well-watered plains and stuck me with
[37:50] this stuff over here, and our guys were
[37:52] always fighting. Here's my opportunity.
[37:54] Lot's getting his comeuppets. Uh-huh.
[37:56] Karma is going to get you now, buddy.
[37:58] You're going to die." No, he interceded
[37:59] for them. This is the attitude of a real
[38:02] believer. They They're not They're not
[38:04] desiring uh they're not in competition.
[38:06] They're not They're not saying, "Oh,
[38:08] well, line my orpas up. I'd like to see,
[38:10] you know, kind of have a a message jihad
[38:12] against all those that, you know, deny
[38:13] the truth. Uh there's this longing and
[38:16] this desire. He says he's a
[38:17] representative of a true Christian
[38:18] that's tested, tried, and been proven.
[38:20] And sometimes it's our testing, trying
[38:22] and proving that dries out of us some of
[38:24] these carnal uh narcissistic attributes
[38:27] that we have
[38:29] in these borderline persona, spiritual
[38:31] personality disorders that we have
[38:33] sometimes where we can't rejoice in
[38:34] others and we desire to see other people
[38:36] fall flat on their face. It took
[38:38] something to bring Abraham to that spot
[38:40] where when his nephew deserved it, he'd
[38:42] say, "God, is there not some way you
[38:44] could preserve him?"
[38:46] But then notice how he brings this other
[38:48] side. Now, the woman had a lot to do
[38:50] with it.
[38:52] Come on, somebody. Now, the woman had a
[38:54] lot to do with it. Lot's wife was
[38:57] carnal, very carnal. She stands today in
[39:00] the fields there as a pillar of salt, as
[39:02] a disgrace to those who pass by.
[39:06] So here she represents this carnality
[39:08] and he's recognizing how the woman had
[39:10] this influence on Lot. The woman had a
[39:13] lot to do with it. She was carnal, very
[39:14] carnal. She belonged to society, stitch
[39:17] and sew, parties, everything else. She'd
[39:19] become to love it. She stands now as a
[39:21] pillar of disgrace to those who pass by.
[39:24] And so now I want you to recognize how
[39:25] this woman Lot's wife is represented in
[39:29] Genesis chapter 19 as one who turns back
[39:33] contrary to the message does not go all
[39:35] the way. Then in the book of Ruth Orpa
[39:39] in the very lineage of this family
[39:42] because it was Lot's wife's daughter
[39:43] that brings forth now
[39:45] Moab. So in the very lineage of the
[39:47] family, we see the same characteristic
[39:49] expressed in Orpa because she's going to
[39:51] kiss Naomi and she's go right back into
[39:54] Sodom and Gomorrah, go right back into
[39:56] Moab. So she in Ruth now Orpa turns
[39:59] back, she's connected with the spirit of
[40:02] Lot. And so what I want to kind of set
[40:06] up and I I I have this I can set up my
[40:08] own spikes. It's kind of nice when
[40:10] you're you can you can do an alleyoop to
[40:12] yourself when you're preaching. uh that
[40:14] if they we see it in Genesis 19, we see
[40:17] it in Ruth. Does the Bible point to
[40:19] another manifestation of this today?
[40:22] Yes.
[40:24] Because Ruth's transition, remember it
[40:26] begins with the Lord visiting his
[40:28] people. In Luke 17, we're pointed to the
[40:32] days of Lot verses 28-32. Likewise, as
[40:35] it was in the days of Lot, they did eat,
[40:39] they drank, they bought, they sold, they
[40:41] planted, they builded. Likewise also as
[40:44] it was in the days of Lot. So we're
[40:47] drawn to this day, this time, this
[40:48] season. Begins to identify these
[40:50] different characteristics. But the same
[40:51] day that Lot went out of Sodom, it
[40:54] rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[40:56] and destroyed them all. We read this in
[40:58] Genesis 19. And as a part of this
[41:01] judgment that's outpouring in verses 24
[41:03] and 25, the word in Genesis 19 says,
[41:06] "But his life, Lot's wife looked back
[41:09] from behind him."
[41:11] Now Jesus is referring to these very
[41:13] instances in this time of Genesis 19.
[41:17] And he's saying as it was in the days of
[41:18] Lot, so shall it be. Notice this verse
[41:21] 30. Even thus shall it be in the day
[41:24] when the son of man is revealed. You can
[41:26] have days of Lot, but you have a day
[41:28] when the son of man is revealed. You can
[41:30] have these days of Noah, but there's a
[41:32] day when the son of man is revealed. You
[41:34] can there are these different times and
[41:36] seasons and dispensations and churches.
[41:38] But now there's a day when the son of
[41:40] man is revealed. We recognize
[41:42] scripturally that the revelation of the
[41:44] son of man is also called the coming of
[41:46] the son of man. It has a very specific
[41:48] place in prophecy. Has a very specific
[41:51] utility and use and purpose as it
[41:53] relates to the Gentiles and this end
[41:55] time revelation of Jesus Christ. I trust
[41:57] you understand some of those things. So
[41:59] he's saying now even thus shall it be in
[42:01] the day when the son of man is revealed.
[42:03] This is message scripture, right?
[42:08] Then verse 31. And verse 31 alludes to
[42:11] the destruction of Jerusalem. It kind of
[42:12] is parallel with Matthew chapter 24 16
[42:15] to 18. And it's a day that compares to
[42:17] the time we're living in now. And I' I'd
[42:19] love to bring that parallel out, but I
[42:21] just want to make this quick quick
[42:22] connection. In that day, he which shall
[42:24] be upon the housetop and in his stuff in
[42:26] the house, let him not come down to take
[42:28] it away. And he that is in the field,
[42:30] let him likewise not return back. And
[42:33] then he says, "Remember Lot's wife."
[42:36] Isn't that interesting?
[42:39] Remember Lot's wife. He says verse 31,
[42:42] the the the thrust now is do not return
[42:45] back.
[42:47] We take from this in the day when the
[42:48] son of man is revealed. There's this
[42:50] admonishment and this clear direction
[42:52] that we don't go back to what we've been
[42:54] called out of. God is not going to cycle
[42:57] back to what the life has moved on from.
[42:59] that if there there's not a and now I
[43:02] just kind of remember something I was
[43:04] fellowshipping on this week with
[43:05] somebody and that and I recall last this
[43:08] conversation I had yesterday and how
[43:10] that when God when God restores when God
[43:12] restores something it's it's bringing
[43:15] something back to the place that it once
[43:18] was so that it can take its last another
[43:21] step so it can move forward so we don't
[43:23] find that God's order of restoration is
[43:26] actually going backwards in the sense of
[43:28] reverting back, but it's to bring back
[43:30] what was been lost in order to go on
[43:32] into perfection. So, if we're going to
[43:34] be restored back to Pentecost, it's not
[43:36] so that we would cabbage down on
[43:37] Pentecost, but it's so that we can go
[43:39] back to what was given to the church in
[43:41] order to go on to the perfection of it.
[43:44] You catch that? So, when this this do
[43:46] not go back, do not return back speaks
[43:48] of the momentum of the word of God that
[43:50] you got to take this and go forward. And
[43:52] it's this admonishment that there is a
[43:54] don't go back to what you've been called
[43:56] out of like Orpa did, like Lot's wife
[43:58] did. Don't go back to what you've been
[43:59] called. Don't go back to what is cursed.
[44:04] And then he says, remember Lot's wife.
[44:08] I want you to understand this. And I'm
[44:10] so glad all of you are here tonight to
[44:12] hear this because to me, this is going
[44:14] to be this is very critical to our to
[44:16] our revelation and our understanding of
[44:18] the message of the hour. Lukeapter 17:32
[44:22] is not chastisement of the elect.
[44:26] Luke 17:32 is not correction of the
[44:30] elect because we must understand this
[44:32] very clearly. She is typed in Ruth. Ruth
[44:35] really literally had no way back.
[44:39] She was ordained
[44:41] something. I think you just I just lost
[44:42] you. Just locked up on this is really
[44:44] awesome to that point. It's like
[44:45] everyone digs in says I don't know,
[44:47] brother Aaron. By election by election I
[44:51] hope you believe this for yourself. You
[44:52] can't go back. Amen.
[44:54] You can't be lost. I know that bothers
[44:56] even I I know it bothers message uh us
[44:59] as message believers sometimes,
[45:01] especially as message pastors and
[45:02] preachers. Wow. You don't want to make
[45:04] them so elect and so predestinated, you
[45:06] know, that they just sin away the day of
[45:08] grace. You're like, well, that's true,
[45:09] but I don't want to make them so unelect
[45:12] and so unpredestinated that they never
[45:14] walk into a body change.
[45:15] So, I'd rather heir on you're going to
[45:17] make it, knowing that some will make it,
[45:19] and those who can't make it won't make
[45:21] it.
[45:21] Amen. And so we want to preach a
[45:23] positive gospel, a positive message. So
[45:25] when he says, "Remember Lot's wife,"
[45:28] this is not a warning to the bride to
[45:31] not be Lot's wife because she can't be
[45:33] Lot's wife. It's not a warning to the
[45:36] elect to not be Lot's wife. She can't.
[45:38] It's an impossibility for not to to for
[45:41] her to be a Lot's wife. So it's not
[45:42] chastisement, but it's prophecy.
[45:46] And when I preached this sermon years
[45:47] ago and I preached remember Lot's wife
[45:49] and I was getting called out for not
[45:50] knowing her name was Anita. Uh boy, it
[45:53] was an evangelistic, you know, rip your
[45:54] hide off of you, try to get as many
[45:56] people to the altar as you can. Remember
[45:57] Lot's wife, don't be a Lot's wife. And
[45:59] then the revelation came to me later on.
[46:01] This is not solely an evangelistic text
[46:04] to to shake the bride out of her
[46:06] doldrums and wake her up from her
[46:07] leodysian condition and her backsliding
[46:10] condition and looking back with the
[46:11] longing to the world and wanting to go
[46:13] back what she's called out of. But it's
[46:14] actually Luke 17:32 is prophecy. And
[46:18] when he says, "Remember Lot's wife," he
[46:20] says, "When the son of man is revealed,
[46:23] look for Lot's wife to manifest
[46:25] yourself. And if the son of man is
[46:28] revealed, there will also be a revealing
[46:30] and an unveiling of Lot's wife."
[46:34] And and if you don't see Lot's wife
[46:36] manifest, then you haven't seen the son
[46:38] of the revelation of the son of man may
[46:39] have not come yet because she's got to
[46:41] be there. The revealer of the son of
[46:43] man. Then sometime after the son of man
[46:45] is revealed, you want to remember Lot's
[46:47] wife because she's going to declare
[46:48] herself. At the rising of the son, Lot
[46:51] found his place in Zor. But Abraham went
[46:54] to the place where the Lord was at. And
[46:56] at that very time, at the rising of the
[46:58] son, at the revealer of the son of man,
[47:00] the bride is going to be brought forth
[47:02] by the living bread of life. But that's
[47:03] also going to bring forth Lot's wife.
[47:08] And she can only manifest herself if
[47:10] there's a roof that's going all the way.
[47:12] She can only manifest herself if there's
[47:15] the bride that comes on the scene.
[47:16] Because until then, everybody thinks
[47:18] she's the bride.
[47:20] Think about it. If all you had was the
[47:22] church and the church all says, "Well,
[47:23] let's correct course. Let's go this
[47:24] way." Then everybody's, "Oh, that must
[47:26] be what the Lord is doing." But when in
[47:28] everyone when the church does this and
[47:29] starts going this way, and there's a
[47:30] brother that says, "I'm going all the
[47:32] way with my Lord."
[47:36] Then you know, wait a minute, there's
[47:37] been a separation.
[47:40] Now, there's a there's a there's a point
[47:42] where there's been a separation. There's
[47:44] someone that's moving on. There's some
[47:45] advancing. And that's where Lot's wife
[47:47] manifest herself. Luke 17:32 is
[47:50] prophecy. And let me say, we've seen it.
[47:55] Have we not seen it? Have we not seen
[47:56] Lot's wife identify herself in going so
[48:00] far with the message, but then all of a
[48:01] sudden one day saying, "You know what?
[48:03] There's nothing to it. I'm going back."
[48:07] And brother Brandham says, "And how can
[48:08] I overcome?" She started out as an
[48:09] overcomer, but she never did overcome.
[48:12] She left the denominations. She did.
[48:16] She walked out of Sodom with Lot, but
[48:18] she wanted to go back. And here's the
[48:20] sign you see so often and have her hair
[48:22] cut. She had to go back. She just
[48:25] couldn't stand the test.
[48:28] So, here's the rejection of the headship
[48:30] of the word. Here's her identifying
[48:32] herself. This is her uh now choosing now
[48:35] to not follow the message all the way.
[48:37] She starts out overcome as an overcomer
[48:39] and there's a re there's a manifestation
[48:41] of Lot's wife after the son of man is
[48:44] revealed. I believe the son of man is
[48:45] revealed himself and is a manifestation
[48:47] of the spirit of Lot's wife that's also
[48:49] revealing itself or making itself known.
[48:53] I don't I I I I I I I don't want to end
[48:56] on that
[48:58] because there's remember it's a spirit
[49:04] and you'll never come out of the spirit
[49:06] of Lot's wife by just being called out
[49:10] on it.
[49:12] You got to know what you're called to.
[49:14] You got to see yourself in the word. And
[49:17] if I just took your nose and rubbed your
[49:19] nose and you're nothing but a bunch of
[49:20] makeelievers, you're not a bunch of lots
[49:21] like
[49:23] just rub your nose in it. Then you're
[49:25] going to go away just accepting that,
[49:26] right? Well, I don't really want to be
[49:28] Lot's wife, but what else am I?
[49:31] There's a contrasting contrasting
[49:33] example. We're not just left with Orpa
[49:36] and Lot's wife and Lot and his
[49:38] daughters. We see a contrasting example.
[49:40] We've already recognized where there's
[49:42] Abraham, but Ruth is the bride type in
[49:46] the story, the book of Ruth.
[49:49] So, where is the bride type in Genesis
[49:51] 19? because you're the bride today.
[49:53] Where is your type in Genesis 19?
[49:57] In the message, Abraham,
[49:59] brother Abraham says Sarah was in the
[50:01] covenant with him because she was the
[50:03] wife.
[50:05] So, it's not just Abraham now. Sarah,
[50:08] remember when those messengers came to
[50:11] uh came to meet Abraham, they they said,
[50:14] "Where is thy wife Sarah?"
[50:17] And then but only one spoke to her.
[50:20] one had a message for her.
[50:23] And it says Sarah was in the covenant
[50:25] with him because she was the wife. But
[50:27] notice when he separated himself from
[50:29] Lot and Lot's wife, I imagine Mrs. Lot
[50:32] wanted to belong to all the lotteryies
[50:34] and everything going along throughout
[50:36] the country. You know, she was a
[50:39] hindrance to him. Now, he's the one that
[50:43] takes Lot's wife and characterizes her,
[50:46] but contrast her with Sarah.
[50:50] So we could be Orpa, Lot's wife. We
[50:52] could see this type of the modern
[50:53] church, Leodysia. But where you're you
[50:54] you can see yourself in Sarah
[50:57] and the message communion. We read it a
[50:59] moment ago how we said that the Abraham
[51:01] was a type of the just. And I'm just
[51:03] going to pick up with this. Now the
[51:04] women had a lot to do with it. Lot's
[51:07] wife was carnal, very carnal. She stands
[51:10] today in the fields there as a pillar of
[51:12] salt, as a disgrace to those who pass
[51:14] by. Sarah, a beautiful woman.
[51:18] She wanted to do what God wanted her to
[51:20] do. She respected her husband and she
[51:24] stayed with Abraham regardless of what
[51:26] come or went. She stayed with him
[51:29] because he stayed with the promise.
[51:32] This is the bride type. This is what's
[51:34] represented in Ruth staying with Naomi
[51:36] because Naomi's going back to Bethlehem
[51:38] Judah because the Lord had visited her
[51:40] people and given them bread. And
[51:42] unbeknownst to Ruth, there's a promise
[51:44] even for her in Bethlehem Judah. And
[51:48] Orpa kisses Naomi goodbye. Kissed Christ
[51:50] goodbye. But now Ruth, she's also rep
[51:53] represented in Sarah. The bride is
[51:55] represented in Sarah. This beautiful
[51:57] woman who wanted to do what God wanted
[51:59] to do. She respected her husband. She
[52:01] stayed with Abraham regardless of what
[52:03] Connor went. She stayed with him because
[52:05] he stayed with the promise. In another
[52:08] place, I don't believe I provided this
[52:09] on a slide. He said Sarah was the
[52:11] prettiest woman in all the land. There
[52:13] was no woman as fair as Sarah.
[52:15] Everyone's seen her, fell in love with
[52:17] her. Now, how easy it would have been
[52:19] for Sarah to take that kind of choice
[52:21] like Lot's wife, to take that kind of
[52:23] choice like Orpa did. But she chose to
[52:26] stay with Abraham. She chose to stay
[52:29] with the promise. She chose to stay.
[52:32] Though as crazy as it may have seemed
[52:34] been to her, though as dead as they must
[52:37] have felt, she chose to stay where the
[52:40] word had promised her something.
[52:43] No matter how dark it seemed, how
[52:44] contradictory it seemed, no matter how
[52:46] hard it seemed, no matter what all the
[52:47] voices were coming against it, she
[52:49] stayed with him because of the promise.
[52:51] And there's your type.
[52:54] In a day and age where there could be
[52:55] many that walk in that spirit of Lot's
[52:57] wife, there's that walking in the same
[52:59] example of Sarah, walking in the example
[53:01] of Ruth in that moment of showdown, in
[53:04] that time of decision.
[53:06] My brothers would come to their
[53:07] instruments like to read this last
[53:10] statement. God being sovereign,
[53:12] he forneew by divine decree exactly who
[53:15] would be in his bride. He chose her. She
[53:19] did not choose him. He called her. She
[53:22] did not come on her own. He died for
[53:24] her. He washed her in his own blood. He
[53:27] paid the price for her. She belongs to
[53:29] him and to him alone. Now notice, she is
[53:32] wholly committed to him and accepts the
[53:35] obligation.
[53:36] Not that you would choose, right? We see
[53:39] the choosing of a bride. A man chooses a
[53:42] wife and he chooses her and then he
[53:43] would ask for her hand in marriage. And
[53:45] what does she do? She doesn't choose him
[53:47] as much as she accepts
[53:49] she accepts the choice. She's wholly
[53:52] committed to him and he accepts the
[53:55] obligation. Now she commits herself. He
[53:57] accepts the obligation to her. He is her
[54:00] head. For Christ is the head of his
[54:02] church. And then he uses this beautiful
[54:04] example. As Sarah called Abraham Lord,
[54:07] even so the bride is happy that he is
[54:10] her Lord. He speaks and she obeys, for
[54:14] that is her delight.
[54:17] That's that's what we see in this
[54:19] beautiful example of Ruth in this moment
[54:21] of contradiction, in this moment of
[54:24] opposition, in this moment of an exodus
[54:26] out of this terrible condition. She's
[54:28] brought to a place where she has to make
[54:30] a clear-cut decision. Will you go back
[54:33] like Orpa?
[54:35] And why don't you just go back? Why
[54:38] don't you? And it's not necessarily
[54:40] you're I've never liked you anyways as a
[54:42] daughter-in-law. I regretted the day my
[54:44] son married you. But it's, you know, you
[54:46] see your sister. Why don't you go back
[54:48] too?
[54:50] But there was something in
[54:53] Ruth,
[54:55] this instinct to wholly commit.
[55:00] She was happy to follow.
[55:03] That's where you are.
[55:07] I say when he said there's some nuggets,
[55:09] that means there's gold.
[55:11] You're the gold. You're the hidden
[55:14] revelation in Ruth. That's why it brings
[55:16] you so close to God when you see it.
[55:19] That's why it wasn't just what he is in
[55:21] the story, but also what he is to you
[55:24] and how you could receive him, how you
[55:26] could accept him. Because it has so much
[55:27] to do with you being the very thing that
[55:30] he highlighted
[55:32] that in the story, everyone would read
[55:34] through it. Everyone would read through
[55:35] it. And it's as if brother Brandham took
[55:36] the prophetic highlighter and just
[55:38] highlighted over Ruth. She is the bride
[55:40] of Christ.
[55:42] She represents you coming out of
[55:43] Leodysia. She represents you coming out
[55:46] of a Moabitish condition. She represents
[55:49] you being withtood by Orba. She
[55:51] represents you making a clear-cut
[55:53] decision in a moment, in a showdown,
[55:55] which wasn't easy, and saying, "I will
[55:57] wholly follow the Lord."
[56:00] And how the message of the hour brings
[56:02] to us these beautiful images of Genesis
[56:04] 18 and Genesis 19. And brother Brandham,
[56:06] in the midst of all this, we can see so
[56:08] clearly where Lot finds his place, Lot's
[56:11] wife finds her place, Abraham takes his
[56:14] place, and now he uses another example
[56:16] of Sarah.
[56:17] [Music]
[56:19] the contrast to Lot's wife, the bride
[56:22] type in Genesis, hidden bride type in
[56:24] Genesis 19, who chose to stay where the
[56:27] promise is. Will you stay?
[56:31] Did you make a decision tonight? I just
[56:34] like we said before, you have a choice
[56:36] to leave a better man or a better woman.
[56:40] Brother Aaron, will you leave a better
[56:41] man tonight? You make that choice. You
[56:45] can make that choice, Brother Phillip.
[56:47] Make a choice tonight. I'm trying not
[56:48] just singling those brothers out.
[56:51] But just just to so you can begin to
[56:53] make it personal. Then we can do it
[56:56] tonight by just standing. So I'm going
[56:59] all the way with my Lord. Choosing
[57:01] tonight. Let's stand. If you want to
[57:02] choose, I'm going to be a better man, a
[57:04] better woman tonight. I'm happy that he
[57:07] is my Lord.
[57:09] What he speaks, I will obey. And that's
[57:12] my delight. That's my joy. That's my
[57:16] pleasure. Let's bow our heads.
[57:19] I can say this before we pray. Remember
[57:22] Lot's wife?
[57:25] Is God whispering a secret to his wife
[57:28] just as he did the bosom of John? Did he
[57:30] not tell John the one who would betray
[57:31] him?
[57:33] Pet tell Ask him. Ask him who is it?
[57:37] John the type of the bride resting his
[57:38] bosom on the heart of Jesus. His head on
[57:41] the heart of Jesus. resting his head in
[57:42] the bosom of Jesus, Jesus leans down and
[57:44] said, "It's the one that when I've
[57:46] dipped my hand to him." And he knew the
[57:49] secret of who would betray him. And then
[57:52] right within the context of this
[57:53] beautiful truth of the revealing of the
[57:55] son of man, the living bread of life
[57:57] bringeth forth the bride. He says,
[57:58] "Remember Lot's wife." And it becomes a
[58:00] hidden revelation to the elect who could
[58:03] recognize a contrary spirit recognizing
[58:06] an opposition representing a a
[58:09] identifying and exposing a resistance to
[58:12] the revealed word of the hour that'll
[58:14] sweep itself onto people and cause them
[58:17] to walk away.
[58:20] And it would be my prayer
[58:23] that the Ruths that get caught up in the
[58:25] momentum, the Ruths that get caught up
[58:27] in the move, the Ruths that have
[58:29] temporarily lost their way would come to
[58:31] their senses.
[58:33] And I believe there's those who will.
[58:36] I believe there's those who will. Our
[58:39] gracious heavenly father, tonight,
[58:42] it has been such a joy
[58:45] to share your word with your bride.
[58:48] It has been lovely as a man of God to
[58:51] just
[58:52] walk with your with your wife through
[58:55] these scriptures.
[58:59] Have the privilege of sharing nuggets.
[59:01] [Music]
[59:03] Have the privilege of recognizing
[59:05] highlights.
[59:08] No wonder your prophet said it's the
[59:10] greatest privilege.
[59:14] is the most important job.
[59:18] This has been wonderful. Lord, I'm just
[59:20] saying this personally as a as a friend
[59:23] and as a brother, as a man of God
[59:26] tonight. Thank you, Lord, for this
[59:28] privilege.
[59:29] [Music]
[59:30] Thank you for these people that are so
[59:32] faithful.
[59:34] Thank you for the hunger of the hearts
[59:36] of those that are gathered, those that
[59:38] stream.
[59:40] Dozens that come every service even to
[59:44] stream online and can't be here but long
[59:47] to be here. The dozens that come in this
[59:49] setting now, Lord, it's just so
[59:51] beautiful.
[59:53] It's such a wonderful thing. And I'm
[59:54] moved now. I just desired that there
[59:56] would be a real anointing
[1:00:00] that would allow
[1:00:02] a son and a daughter tonight to know
[1:00:05] they're leaving better.
[1:00:09] Better for having heard your voice.
[1:00:11] Better for having seen themselves in the
[1:00:13] word. Lord, we have not just taken links
[1:00:16] to call out Lot and call out Orpa and
[1:00:19] call out Lot's wife, but we've connected
[1:00:21] them with Abraham. We've connected them
[1:00:23] with Ruth. We've connected them with
[1:00:25] Sarah.
[1:00:27] May they find themselves in Christ.
[1:00:30] May that be the uncction that gives them
[1:00:33] the courage to accept they're better.
[1:00:36] Courage to believe they're leaving
[1:00:38] better. The faith to know that it's
[1:00:40] going to get goodter.
[1:00:42] Commit the people to you tonight with
[1:00:44] this beautiful, wonderful presence that
[1:00:46] is with us. Bless them, I pray in your
[1:00:50] precious name. Amen.
