[0:00] as you see already from our title slide
[0:02] we're continuing on the subject of the
[0:04] kingdom and identifying in particular
[0:07] Heaven's mystery Earth glory and on part
[0:10] four I believe it is of worldly kingdoms
[0:13] and we're really we're looking at
[0:15] worldly kingdoms for the sole purpose of
[0:18] identifying uh the plan and purpose of
[0:21] God and as we read in the beginning
[0:22] several different places are just kept
[0:24] referring to the quote over and over
[0:26] again God is always moving towards the
[0:28] kingdom science goes backwards God is
[0:30] always moving toward the kingdom and so
[0:32] the plan and purpose of God we could say
[0:34] just in a way of using a phrase that
[0:36] kind of sums up a lot of stuff we're
[0:38] using it as the kingdom you say well
[0:39] what God wants to do is he wants to do
[0:41] this and he wants to do that uh I'm I'm
[0:43] just using the kingdom to bring into
[0:45] view the plan and purpose of God because
[0:47] that's what God is wanting to accomplish
[0:49] is his will and his what was deep within
[0:52] his heart is a mystery in the very very
[0:54] beginning
[0:55] and Sunday if I could summarize Sunday
[0:57] by saying this God allowed Satan to
[1:00] pervert the kingdom uh he had he had all
[1:03] fashioned and laid out there laid out
[1:04] all his material as a builder had the
[1:06] seed sown everything was in its place
[1:08] each seed bring it forth of its kind the
[1:10] man and a woman are naked and unashamed
[1:13] because they know that they have the
[1:14] power within the seed to bring forth
[1:16] everything that God desired but then God
[1:18] allows Satan to pervert that Kingdom of
[1:20] Genesis 1 and 2 and bring forth what
[1:23] we're calling worldly kingdoms all these
[1:25] things that we see in the world and we
[1:27] were using the parable of the sower of
[1:29] how the you know the uses it in the
[1:32] first symbol sense that our Master we
[1:34] know that you sowed good seed but where
[1:35] did the tares come from and it was Jesus
[1:38] using the parable to raise the question
[1:39] of to raise the question of why is there
[1:41] evil in the world but then also to
[1:43] answer it by saying it's the devil that
[1:45] has done this and as we read in Isaiah
[1:48] chapter 45
[1:49] verses 7 and 8 and More in particular
[1:52] verse 7 we know that God did not create
[1:55] moral evil but rather that was a choice
[1:58] of free will that mankind chooses wrong
[2:01] and even in the beginning he allowed
[2:03] Satan uh to have the capacity of free
[2:05] moral agency even as an angel he had the
[2:07] ability to choose because he was like
[2:09] God in every way except the ability to
[2:11] create and so he allowed Satan he didn't
[2:14] create evil but he allowed Satan and you
[2:16] might say well this is uh this is an
[2:18] interesting distinction but I think it's
[2:19] important he allowed Satan to pervert
[2:21] good
[2:22] and by perverting good It produced evil
[2:25] remember that a lie cannot exist on its
[2:28] own so God cannot create a lie but as
[2:31] soon as he bring puts forth truth and
[2:33] someone has the ability of free more
[2:35] agency then they can change truth he
[2:38] said well it doesn't quite mean that I
[2:40] know he said that you'll die but I'm
[2:42] just going to add three letters and say
[2:43] you will not die and that's all it took
[2:46] to take something good and turn it to
[2:47] evil and so the the way that Satan works
[2:50] is Satan does not have the power to sow
[2:52] seed of himself and so the only thing
[2:55] that he could do is find a way to deform
[2:58] good seeds and Satan found a way to do
[3:00] that take one seed that was meant to be
[3:02] used this way take another seed that was
[3:04] meant to be used this way and mix it
[3:05] together he said how can two you say two
[3:08] wrongs don't make a right
[3:10] right but two goods can make her wrong
[3:14] if you mix them if you mix them out of
[3:16] God's program in the way that God
[3:17] intended it and so I'm just using some
[3:19] summary language so that we're all on
[3:22] the same page and I have to admit
[3:23] sometimes I get nervous when there's
[3:24] visitors because I kind of have a
[3:26] tendency to preach in a series and you
[3:28] can just drop in on one service and be
[3:29] like he makes no sense
[3:31] he's lost his mind and so I get nervous
[3:33] uh in his when I preach in a series and
[3:36] we just kind of catch a snippet so if we
[3:38] need to kind of answer a bunch of
[3:39] questions later we're available but
[3:41] Satan he is a deformer so what Satan did
[3:43] is he deformed seeds that's what he does
[3:45] he's a deformer he deforms the seeds so
[3:48] sin is not organic or original right and
[3:52] that should please a lot of people who
[3:53] are all about Organics and so he'd say
[3:55] Walmart sells the deformed seeds and
[3:57] Sprouts sows the good seeds but it's uh
[4:01] we know that good seed is is original
[4:04] but Satan perverts the good seeds so sin
[4:07] is not an original seed sin is
[4:09] righteousness perverted Elias a truth
[4:13] perverted brother bam even says death is
[4:15] a perversion of life
[4:17] and so the things that you see that are
[4:19] Satan's kingdom whether it be Darkness
[4:20] it exists because of light whether it be
[4:22] death it exists because of life whether
[4:23] it be a lie it exists because of Truth
[4:25] and so God's not the one that creates
[4:27] those things as an original but rather
[4:29] they're things that exist as a result of
[4:32] the original being perverted I think
[4:34] that I think that's sufficient
[4:36] uh to go forward and I will say this
[4:39] it's at the real heart of us identifying
[4:43] the kingdom and even in eternity because
[4:45] there's a lot of things with I thought
[4:47] this was going to happen and that's
[4:48] going to happen and brother I'll read it
[4:50] here in a little bit where bro man talks
[4:51] about anything that had a beginning will
[4:52] have an end and so we are looking at
[4:55] things that are original and things that
[4:57] are perverted because that's a part of
[4:59] understanding
[5:00] Eternal things
[5:01] and in the sermon who do you say this is
[5:03] I think I just I don't know if I
[5:05] provided this statement but it says
[5:06] there is a system in the world and I
[5:08] would say that he's about to say there's
[5:10] two systems but we can identify a
[5:12] worldly system he says two systems and
[5:14] one of them is the right system and the
[5:16] other is a perverted system
[5:18] so there is a perverted system that is
[5:20] in the world and that's what we're
[5:21] looking at is where this perverted
[5:23] system began we use the parable of the
[5:25] sower the tares what are the tares
[5:27] brother Brown said they are the seeds of
[5:28] discrepancy that are sown by Satan it's
[5:31] that wheat's evil twin it's the mimic
[5:32] weed it's the impersonation and that's
[5:35] that's how there became a perverted
[5:37] system had that not happened and let's
[5:39] say nothing else happened then all we
[5:41] would have is the right system
[5:42] brother bam said in the seat of
[5:44] discrepancy Satan sowed his seed from
[5:46] the beginning when God placed his first
[5:48] harvest of human beings upon the Earth
[5:50] and I think we said before the way that
[5:52] he's characterizing this is very
[5:54] important that God had his first harvest
[5:57] of humans Adam and the woman that would
[5:59] be the pure human the pure race the pure
[6:01] seed that God had brought forth from the
[6:03] in the original creation and then Satan
[6:06] sows his seed in the beginning after God
[6:08] had placed his harvest in the Earth
[6:11] and he calls it a seed of discrepancy I
[6:13] think that characterization is so
[6:15] important because he says uses the
[6:17] definition of being contrary to what's
[6:19] already been
[6:20] so at a seat of discrepancy is something
[6:22] that's contrary it's a contradiction not
[6:24] just a difference you just say well the
[6:27] uh the serpent was different than the
[6:29] human but God wanted them he's a god of
[6:31] variety and he's a thing of a different
[6:33] Collins and different gifts in different
[6:34] places and one could have a true gift
[6:36] and one has a true calling and they're
[6:38] they're absolutely true but where they
[6:40] where things get wrong is when they get
[6:42] mixed
[6:43] and so it's not that God uh God likes
[6:46] differences he likes a A variation but
[6:49] it's not the the variance is what's
[6:51] against God so a seat of discrepancy is
[6:54] something that's a contradiction to what
[6:56] has been a conflict or variation between
[6:58] facts figures or claims and that's uh
[7:01] That's what Satan brought was a
[7:03] contradiction to God's program that's
[7:06] the seat of discrepancies oh well did
[7:08] Satan have an actual seed no he just
[7:10] brought a contradiction he used a seed
[7:12] of The Serpent and it brought a
[7:13] contradiction to what God's original was
[7:17] now I want to read this statement from
[7:18] the seat of discrepancy and it's in uh
[7:20] kind of two parts because then brother
[7:21] Brown gives the vision he had of the of
[7:24] the um the rain fallen on the uh just an
[7:26] unjust and the things he saw how the
[7:28] weeds Rejoice just the same as the the
[7:30] wheat and he's I had that experience in
[7:33] the Pentecostal meetings where one had a
[7:34] true gift and could use tongues in
[7:36] Prophecy and another one had an ungodly
[7:39] life behind it but he says I believe
[7:41] that Jesus was speaking this Parable in
[7:43] his day and this is the parable of the
[7:44] sword but was meaning it to be at the
[7:46] end of the world or the End of the Age
[7:48] which is this day
[7:50] that gives it a little bit more of a um
[7:53] we said I want you to understand this in
[7:55] particular in the end when these seeds
[7:57] are coming to harvest and I believe and
[7:59] he's taken it from Matthew 13 and he
[8:01] says and I believe this little text
[8:02] tonight is a very appropriate is for the
[8:05] hour that we're living in so if I could
[8:08] say this to us as Believers brother
[8:10] Branham as a prophet is putting his
[8:12] finger on a particular Parable and he's
[8:14] saying what Jesus is teaching in this
[8:16] and all the depth and meaning that it
[8:17] has he said is very appropriate for the
[8:20] hour that we're living in and if you
[8:22] want to argue it was appropriate for
[8:24] January 18 1965 and that alone okay
[8:26] that's fine argue it but if it was
[8:29] appropriate then just think of how these
[8:31] seeds are continuing to come to harvest
[8:33] and maybe even how more relevant it
[8:36] might be for us to take a cue from what
[8:38] was appropriate then
[8:40] and the brother Brandon continues after
[8:42] he gives that Vision he says the rain
[8:43] falls on the just and the unjust The
[8:45] Same Spirit can fall in a meeting and
[8:47] everybody rejoicing it Hypocrites
[8:48] Christians and all together exactly
[8:50] right but what is it by their fruits
[8:52] they are known so if we talk about
[8:53] sowing and manifestation he's looking at
[8:55] the Harvest to identify what kingdoms
[8:58] they may be of children of the kingdom
[9:00] are children of the wicked one that's
[9:01] the only way it can ever be known then
[9:03] you see that now since Wild Oats or wild
[9:06] wheat and Grains sometimes impersonate a
[9:09] genuine domestic grain so close that it
[9:12] would deceive the very elect so the
[9:14] other text he took was in Matthew 24 at
[9:17] 24 where he's talking about the spirit
[9:19] at the end time and he's false Christ
[9:20] would be showing such signs and wonders
[9:23] and doing such things that if it were
[9:25] possible
[9:26] it would deceive the very elect and so
[9:28] we can't brag about anything other than
[9:30] the fact that God designed You by
[9:32] election to not be deceived and so
[9:34] there's it's an impossibility for the
[9:36] elect in the end but notice how he's
[9:38] saying that it's a wild wheat it's that
[9:40] mimic weed that impersonator that those
[9:43] tares
[9:44] that have been sown into the Earth and
[9:46] into humanity and as we near the end
[9:49] he's saying that this even if you look
[9:51] at it in terms of a different type now
[9:53] the shock looks just like the wheat but
[9:56] it's not the grain it's not the original
[9:58] and so you could look at it from that
[10:00] standpoint or you could look at in terms
[10:01] of the tares that look just like wheat
[10:04] but it's it's there's a poison to it
[10:05] there's death in it he's saying they
[10:07] have been sown in amongst the domestic
[10:10] grain and it impersonates it remember
[10:13] the stowaway seeds and the truth about
[10:14] the Terrors that we've already
[10:15] ministered on he says I think we're
[10:17] living in a timely age when these things
[10:19] should be preached on and talked about
[10:22] and not and and the way that he puts it
[10:25] in that impersonation context I think is
[10:27] very very good because I believe that
[10:30] each one of us as individuals shouldn't
[10:32] should desire to manifest instead of
[10:34] impersonate
[10:35] and yeah maybe it's fun to sit back and
[10:38] identify all the impersonators but
[10:40] really uh it's horrible when we're the
[10:42] ones impersonating and so what we want
[10:45] to do is we don't want to be the
[10:46] hypocrite we don't want to be the
[10:47] impersonator really if I could put it
[10:49] this way if you're genuine grain and you
[10:51] start doing things like that you're
[10:53] impersonating the mimic weed hey you're
[10:56] the one that needs to check yourself
[10:57] before you wreck yourself because
[10:59] Christians shouldn't be doing that and
[11:01] so there is a there's an attitude that
[11:03] we have first we examine ourselves and
[11:05] we ask ourselves am I in the truth am I
[11:08] doing what's expected of a real genuine
[11:09] Christian do I have the right kind of
[11:11] attitude and so we're not necessarily
[11:13] wanting to identify externally the
[11:15] impersonations but how easy it for me
[11:17] having had my first nature and first
[11:20] nurture from the world how how is it
[11:22] that it's easy for me to slip into some
[11:24] of those things and not allow the
[11:26] kingdom to manifest itself
[11:28] and so we've been looking at Genesis
[11:29] chapter 3 where we could say that the
[11:32] the wicked one planted these Wild Oats
[11:35] these impersonating tears the mimics and
[11:37] so if you look at as we've looked at
[11:39] Genesis 3 we know it produces twins
[11:41] let's look at Genesis chapter four
[11:44] and and start with verse 16.
[11:48] and read uh just verse 17 and now we'll
[11:51] look at we're at least looking at the
[11:53] worldly kingdoms coming into into view
[11:55] and we could spend a lot of time on
[11:58] earlier in this chapter how that Cain uh
[12:02] brought of the fruit of the ground and
[12:03] in doing so brought an offering that
[12:05] wasn't accepted by God
[12:07] and when God came to him and said well
[12:10] your brother did well and if you'll just
[12:12] do well you'll be accepted and brother
[12:15] makes a statement that Cain could not
[12:18] humble himself to the word of God he
[12:19] said that shows the serpent Satan and so
[12:22] if I could put it this way instead of us
[12:24] saying that that that's identifying a
[12:26] pure serpent race on Earth today that
[12:28] identifies the hybrid nature that of
[12:31] itself cannot humble itself to the word
[12:33] of God and it ought to make you so happy
[12:36] for grace in your life that you did
[12:39] because the hybrid seed cannot humble
[12:41] itself to the word of God and so then
[12:43] God has placed inside of you in thy
[12:45] election into a new birth it gives you a
[12:47] different nature to where you can now
[12:48] humble yourself to the word of God so
[12:50] that's already happened in chapter 4
[12:52] verse 16 it says and Cain went out from
[12:54] the presence of the Lord
[12:56] and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East
[12:58] of Eden and Cain knew his wife and she
[13:00] conceived and bear Enoch and he builded
[13:03] a city and called the name of the city
[13:04] after his son Enoch so if I could say
[13:07] this is the beginning of the world in
[13:09] the worldly kingdoms this is now after
[13:11] there is a seed of of the serpent
[13:13] there's Cain who is that mixed not pure
[13:16] human not pure serpent as brothers
[13:17] teaches us he's now marrying he's having
[13:21] children he's building a city and this
[13:23] is the beginning of the world and
[13:24] worldly kingdoms what begins here is
[13:27] ultimately going to take over everything
[13:29] and so this is the beginning of uh these
[13:32] this is the beginning of civilization
[13:34] these are the seeds of modern thinking
[13:36] you say where we are today you want to
[13:37] know how we got here go back to Genesis
[13:39] chapter three look at its Beginnings in
[13:40] chapter four look at how God highlights
[13:42] it through the next few chapters and you
[13:44] look at that and it's all building up to
[13:46] when he calls Abraham because if I could
[13:48] say this uh and I believe it's Sunday
[13:49] morning that maybe we'll get into this
[13:51] how that God now frames the world but
[13:54] then he calls a man out of the world
[13:56] and he's going to bring forth the seed
[13:58] and in that he is representing
[14:00] symbolically through a natural seed his
[14:02] kingdom why the world exists as the
[14:05] kingdoms of Satan and so he's bringing
[14:07] that contrast right there through the
[14:08] Old Testament and then it's going to
[14:10] head up in Christ and Judas so you can
[14:12] see all along this has been God's plan
[14:14] but he's given us that Old Testament so
[14:16] that we can see uh how Satan sold those
[14:19] tares and how they're representing these
[14:20] other kingdoms so now that's these are
[14:23] the seeds of of the world and worldly
[14:24] kingdoms and so it says he Cain went out
[14:28] from the presence of the Lord now that's
[14:29] striking
[14:30] because it shows that even in the Fallen
[14:33] condition Cain is making a conscious
[14:35] decision to leave the word because in
[14:37] the beginning God's presence was
[14:39] declared by his voice it's declared by
[14:41] his the voice of God came walking in the
[14:43] garden saying and speaking so he was
[14:45] wanting to get away from the word he's
[14:46] wanting to get away from God and how he
[14:48] declared himself and made his presence
[14:49] known and he says indwelt in the Land of
[14:52] Nod now nobody go there tonight
[14:55] and so nard it means wandering speak or
[14:59] Exile and so we could say well that
[15:01] makes sense he's wandering away from the
[15:03] presence of the Lord and he's going to
[15:04] be exiled but it speaks of commotion it
[15:07] comes from the root of wandering or
[15:09] aimless and it it kind of carries with
[15:12] it this feeling of of unrest it's
[15:14] unsettled
[15:15] so if I could say about Cain and I want
[15:19] to say this because this is how I start
[15:20] thinking about Cain he's leaving and
[15:23] he's unsettled he has no aim he has no
[15:27] expectation except that God said well
[15:28] I'll put a mark on you that so no man
[15:30] kills you he doesn't say hey man just if
[15:32] you could just serve your sentence I'm
[15:34] going to take away I'm going to restore
[15:36] you and give you kingdoms and make you
[15:37] powerful and everything's gonna be fine
[15:38] again he doesn't speak any such prophecy
[15:40] over Cain when he's leaving remember the
[15:43] last time that somebody sinned and was
[15:44] sent away from the garden as they leave
[15:46] brother Brahm dramatizes but wait stop
[15:48] and love bundles itself up in a funnel
[15:51] and comes down and says I'll redeem I'll
[15:53] put enmity and so now as King's like oh
[15:55] no what's going to happen he says well
[15:57] I'll put a mark on you so that no one
[15:58] will will kill you he says and now Cain
[16:00] begins to leave God doesn't stop him
[16:02] he already he already told him hey if
[16:04] you'll just do well he'll just humble
[16:05] yourself to the word of God I'll uh your
[16:07] your sin lieth at the door and your
[16:09] brother you know he's telling them that
[16:11] you don't have anything if you'll just
[16:12] do right will everything not be well and
[16:16] so now as he leaves he doesn't stop him
[16:17] so his Cain is leaving he's unsettled he
[16:20] has nothing to Anchor himself in he's
[16:22] being driven by fear he's leaving the
[16:23] presence of God so it says restlessness
[16:26] and this aimlessness he's the maybe the
[16:28] father of wonderlust
[16:30] and then he says that he built he dwells
[16:33] in the Land of Nod there's your Wonder
[16:34] in your commotion and then it says he
[16:36] built a city
[16:37] what a remarkable difference I think we
[16:40] brought it up before how that after
[16:41] Abraham had a son of his own he planted
[16:44] a Grove and now after Cain has a son he
[16:47] builds a city
[16:48] one one making something that's open and
[16:51] inviting
[16:52] has no walls it has no fortifications
[16:54] but it's an oasis to welcome the weary
[16:56] traveler in but Kane on the other hand
[16:57] builds a city and the meaning of that
[17:00] means he built a place that was guarded
[17:03] by waking or watch
[17:05] I said well why did Cain build a city he
[17:08] built a city for his protection because
[17:10] of Terror because of fear because of his
[17:12] sins and to protect himself from himself
[17:15] as he builds walls and he builds
[17:17] fortification because now he's looking
[17:19] out and saying oh there's enmity and
[17:22] there's judgment and I've committed
[17:23] wrong let me build a city and let us let
[17:26] us support ourselves and fortify
[17:29] ourselves and so without happiness
[17:31] without peace and in the state of unrest
[17:33] he devised ways to protect himself
[17:37] and then feeling unsettled and feeling
[17:39] without any expectation if I could say
[17:42] this is like the this is you talk about
[17:43] whistling through a graveyard you talk
[17:45] about pretense Cain is trying to bring
[17:47] some sort of order
[17:49] and so to protect himself and to bring
[17:51] contentment if I could even say to dull
[17:53] the fear that was eating at him I'll
[17:56] build the civilization and I'll build
[17:57] walls and I'll build Gates and I'll have
[18:00] a family and we'll protect ourselves in
[18:01] the city as it's a place that's guarded
[18:03] by watching for what will come and harm
[18:05] us
[18:07] and we find
[18:08] and I could continue reading in this
[18:10] chapter
[18:11] but then I I use this just to show very
[18:14] clearly and I know you all believe this
[18:15] so it's not like I'm trying to say you
[18:17] people who doubt the original sin you're
[18:19] gonna get it tonight but just to show
[18:21] it's so scriptural that here from The
[18:24] Lion of Cain you first find polygamy
[18:27] you find murder with lameck you find an
[18:30] expanding of civilization and Science in
[18:32] verse 20 jabal was the father of those
[18:34] who made tents and raised cattle so it's
[18:36] a it's a means of protection and also
[18:39] sustaining life so he said we need to we
[18:41] need to find ways to protect ourselves
[18:42] we need to find ways to sustain
[18:44] ourselves and verse 21
[18:46] um his brother Jubal uh it says was the
[18:49] father of of harp and organ players and
[18:51] so now these are the musical instruments
[18:53] uh they're inventors it's tubal cane in
[18:55] verse 22 he's the instructor of every
[18:58] Craftsman and brass and iron and they're
[19:00] making armor they're making weapons
[19:03] just think of how these Generations are
[19:04] unfolding and as they're coming up to
[19:06] the seventh generation and you see these
[19:08] things manifesting they're becoming wise
[19:10] right they're saying wow we need armor
[19:12] and we need brass and we need these
[19:14] fittings and we need these instruments
[19:16] and they're trying to find ways to
[19:18] protect themselves trying to find ways
[19:20] to entertain themselves they're trying
[19:21] to find ways to find peace and happiness
[19:23] and joy and why all this is going on in
[19:25] keyneslin it's all we read about Adam's
[19:27] lineages they called on the Lord
[19:29] like there's there's just some sort of
[19:31] contentment and satisfaction going on
[19:33] with these simpletons uh who are just
[19:35] wanting to serve God and they're
[19:36] cognizant of things that once were and
[19:38] now they aren't anymore and and they're
[19:40] hearing the maybe this narrative from
[19:42] Adam about what should have been and
[19:44] they still have some uh I want to use
[19:48] the word Shadow but maybe they still
[19:49] have some gleam of righteousness who
[19:51] Adam was direct from God so now this is
[19:53] being projected in his his line in his
[19:56] seed but over here notice in this hybrid
[19:59] nature they can't be happy
[20:03] and their accomplishments their
[20:04] advancements and their skill and music
[20:06] and Industry and Science and knowledge
[20:09] you'll see that it fits perfectly with
[20:11] Lucifer's Vision to have a bigger and
[20:12] better Kingdom
[20:15] and as we could track it through the
[20:17] Bible as cane seed spreads out it gets
[20:19] further and further from the
[20:20] righteousness that God intended for man
[20:23] to where if you find in Genesis chapter
[20:25] six when God looks down upon the Earth
[20:26] the witness wickedness he says of man
[20:28] was great in every imagination of the
[20:30] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[20:32] continually what happened that hybrid
[20:34] nature had almost filled it up
[20:37] completely to where there's only one man
[20:38] left on Earth in whom God saw
[20:40] righteousness
[20:41] one it was Noah
[20:43] and that's that's the effect of that
[20:45] weakening blood the the mixture that's
[20:48] sewn into it this this nature of Cain
[20:50] and the way that Satan can influence it
[20:52] that's what that's the worldly kingdoms
[20:55] we'll read some places tonight to help I
[20:57] was wanting to take this from this
[20:59] scripture and start going through the
[21:00] Bible to Nimrod uh to Babylon and
[21:03] Nebuchadnezzar and all these different
[21:04] images in the Old Testament and that's
[21:05] when I realized I was wanting to give
[21:07] you 6 000 years of history in one
[21:09] service
[21:10] and I thought that wouldn't be a good
[21:12] idea
[21:13] and so we'll just read some things to
[21:15] summarize it because I want to go
[21:16] further but so notice how brother Brown
[21:18] says this in power of transformation as
[21:20] soon as they went out from the presence
[21:21] of the Lord they started building cities
[21:23] they started making instruments they
[21:25] started in science to make brass and
[21:27] iron and plain music and so forth now
[21:29] where did it come from
[21:30] who went out came the serpent seed you
[21:33] understand it Cain went out
[21:35] and notice he went out from the presence
[21:37] of the Lord and started working in
[21:39] science now look where he is still
[21:42] working science education cities culture
[21:45] it's of the devil
[21:48] don't get nervous
[21:49] but he says it's of the devil who
[21:52] started it the devil who is it of today
[21:54] the devil
[21:55] atomic bombs and things to destroy us
[21:58] with we live in it we have to live here
[22:00] we are a being we have to stay here
[22:04] that's uh
[22:07] that's quite a statement considering
[22:08] what he's about to say
[22:10] but God's Great civilization won't have
[22:12] any of that in it
[22:14] and science has taken the natural things
[22:16] and perverting it to do the things that
[22:18] it wasn't intended to do so it's taking
[22:20] natural things as brother man was
[22:21] talking about breaking into God's Great
[22:23] laboratory and they're discovering
[22:24] things and they're identifying certain
[22:26] things and they're playing with it
[22:27] trying to figure certain things out and
[22:29] trying to modify this and clone that he
[22:31] said they're perverting natural things
[22:33] into things that wasn't intended to do
[22:35] and is it not true that if science makes
[22:38] its great advancements and achieves
[22:40] something there's always a negative
[22:41] consequence I think we've mentioned that
[22:43] before man we can process food so much
[22:45] quicker now and we can feed billions of
[22:47] people cheaply and like isn't this great
[22:49] everybody's eating and then the Fallout
[22:51] from it like oh great now we need to
[22:52] come up with the way and science steps
[22:54] in and says we'll treat the cancers
[22:55] we'll treat the diabetes and right and
[22:57] so now it's just all the scientists
[22:59] they've made made one another necessary
[23:01] and so he says it's perverting things
[23:03] and natural things and perverting it he
[23:05] says and so is this is a real kicker
[23:08] scientific religion
[23:11] it takes the word of God and makes a
[23:13] church organization out of it instead of
[23:15] doing the things that it's supposed to
[23:17] do
[23:18] that's the that maybe is the real rub is
[23:20] it's when it comes into it comes into
[23:23] the church it comes into the things of
[23:25] God it comes into the message of the
[23:26] hour to where now it's a scientific
[23:28] religion that hybrids the message with
[23:31] politics and nicolaitanism and things of
[23:33] man and all sorts of ideas and those
[23:35] things he says you can't do that you've
[23:37] got to keep it pure remember you don't
[23:39] see a denomination and say that that's
[23:41] mixed all you do is when you see
[23:43] something that's mixed that's a
[23:44] denomination
[23:46] because that's what brother Adam
[23:47] identified as being in their anything
[23:49] that mixes the original is
[23:51] denominational
[23:53] now brother bam says this in the seed of
[23:56] discrepancy
[23:57] and I'm using this just to be more
[23:59] concise I was wanting to get into a lot
[24:01] of the scriptures of it but I'm wanting
[24:03] to go further I'm wanting to make a
[24:04] greater go a greater distance tonight
[24:07] so that we can continue
[24:09] into some other areas
[24:11] it says now we find when God sowed his
[24:13] seed in the Garden of Eden
[24:14] we find out that it brought forth an
[24:17] able
[24:17] so there's the man and the woman
[24:20] as God originally had set them forth in
[24:22] Genesis 1 and 2 that when she conceived
[24:26] of Adam she brought forth Abel but when
[24:28] Satan sowed his seat of discrepancy it
[24:31] brought forth a cane you know we I know
[24:33] we all believe that we're family tonight
[24:35] and we understand that one brought forth
[24:37] a righteous one one brought forth an
[24:39] unrighteous one because that Eve
[24:41] listened to the word of discrepancy
[24:43] contrary to the word so notice how the
[24:46] contradiction it was what opened up the
[24:49] channel for the Mixon all right that's
[24:51] where that's what it comes to so Satan
[24:53] uses the power of a lie that causes the
[24:56] hybrid and the mixing and that's there
[24:57] in the Genesis of it and so he says Eve
[25:00] listen to the word of discrepancy
[25:01] contrary to the word and it started the
[25:03] ball of sin rolling right there and has
[25:06] rolled ever since
[25:08] so God so to see it in the beginning and
[25:10] It produced an able we know that that's
[25:13] righteous Abel Abel operates by faith we
[25:16] looked in Genesis chapter 4 we'd find
[25:18] that he operates by Revelation you go
[25:20] again into the New Testament Abel by
[25:22] Faith by Revelation he acts and brings
[25:24] forth an offering a shedding of blood
[25:27] and it's a revelation and God has
[25:29] respect to his offering because think
[25:30] about his revelation of what happened in
[25:34] the garden
[25:35] because his revelation of what was
[25:37] brought death was brought in the and the
[25:39] way that it's so uh permeates his
[25:41] sacrifice and what it represents but his
[25:44] offering by Revelation is contradicted
[25:46] because think of the seed of discrepancy
[25:48] it wasn't just that it was a different
[25:50] offering
[25:51] but it was the fact that it contradicted
[25:53] I think it's in marriage and divorce
[25:54] where brother bam talks about Cain
[25:56] bringing forth by Revelation he says but
[25:58] excuse me Abel bringeth forth by
[25:59] Revelation but Cain
[26:01] is bringing forth fruit and he uses this
[26:03] phrase as he was taught that his parents
[26:06] particular as he was taught in the
[26:07] garden as they were taught in the garden
[26:08] and the phrase can be somewhat ambiguous
[26:11] but to me uh maybe I'm inferring that
[26:14] remember I'm saying that Cain was
[26:16] actually taught by his parents
[26:19] right because you imagine uh him feeling
[26:21] like they need to tell Cain
[26:23] you know
[26:24] Adam's not your real daddy like really
[26:26] the very first family
[26:28] and this is the problem like yeah is it
[26:31] any Wonder we have these problems in
[26:32] laodicea the very first family on Earth
[26:35] is like
[26:36] there's a secret
[26:38] and so what do they do that well it was
[26:40] fruit and that's why we don't live in
[26:42] that Mansion anymore you know the
[26:43] government Biden did it right and they
[26:45] just tell these stories thanks Obama and
[26:48] and so Cain is just like well you know
[26:50] that's great it was fruit let's offer up
[26:52] fruit let's offer these sacrifices and
[26:55] so Cain's offering was a contradiction
[26:58] to truth
[27:00] we can say Cain's Acts were poisoned
[27:02] right because he's he's been deformed
[27:04] and he's been he's influenced by the
[27:06] deformer
[27:08] again remember how that God wanted to
[27:10] indwell humanity God had alone reserved
[27:14] that right to him but he allowed Satan
[27:16] to use the serpent but he couldn't get
[27:19] in the woman he couldn't get in the man
[27:20] but now that he brought forth a hybrid
[27:22] who had some of the Serpent's DNA Satan
[27:25] had access to Cain to cause him to be a
[27:27] murderer caused off the wrong sacrifice
[27:29] causing to refuse to submit now causing
[27:31] to drive him out away from the presence
[27:32] of the Lord and so we could see that
[27:34] he's being deformed by the deformer
[27:37] and when Cain gives his offering I want
[27:40] to say this because it Harkens back to
[27:41] what we preached a couple Sundays ago on
[27:44] how the very seeds of Satan are the
[27:47] nature of it is pretense and pride and
[27:49] politics we see that in the beginning
[27:50] Isaiah 14 in Ezekiel how that it's all
[27:53] in there he wants pomp he wants
[27:55] circumstance he wants ceremony and so
[27:57] Cain acts as if ceremony is enough
[28:01] as long as it's pretty as long as it's
[28:02] beautiful as long as it's in order
[28:04] that's enough but this is born from
[28:06] Lucifer's pretense
[28:08] so we can say the seeds of false
[28:10] religion are manifested in Genesis
[28:11] chapter 4 by Cain it's a seed of
[28:13] unbelief the seed of Doubt because
[28:14] that's his poison formula that's his
[28:16] spray and it's deforming
[28:18] and it's even embodied in the phrase
[28:21] that he
[28:22] as it says that he traveled he dwelt in
[28:25] the land of not on the East of Eden
[28:28] brother Brown's the one that opened this
[28:29] up to me and and I would have just never
[28:32] caught it her brother man I'm not just
[28:33] pinpointed this but it's it's symbolic
[28:36] of religious motive
[28:38] not motive to please God but molded to
[28:41] please man motive for pretense if I
[28:44] could back up and say this about Cain
[28:46] Cain knew he could sense that he was
[28:49] untethered from the right things from
[28:51] the moment that God has respect unto uh
[28:54] able sacrifice Cain now is Roth and he's
[28:57] angry and he's a murderer and God says
[29:00] you're not right you ought to have done
[29:01] this and he knows that he's being
[29:02] punished so Cain is completely unsettled
[29:04] and Cain uh Cain is trying to quiet The
[29:08] Voice
[29:09] he's trying to he wants to give pretense
[29:11] that everything's okay he wants to
[29:12] posture himself and save a rattle that
[29:14] all is well and so when he acts it's it
[29:17] has religious religious motive to to
[29:21] posture to man and to give pretense to
[29:23] man even if it's to intimidate or at
[29:25] least to invite like hey wouldn't you
[29:27] want to be in this city a place of
[29:29] protection so he's acting out of
[29:31] religious motive because remember
[29:32] Lucifer desires to be worshiped as God
[29:35] not as a God he doesn't want to be the
[29:39] pastor of the Church of Anarchy and he
[29:41] doesn't want to be worshiped in this in
[29:42] the seat of the atheist he wants to be
[29:45] worshiped as God so he wants all even
[29:47] the children of God and the stars of God
[29:49] to worship him thinking that he is God
[29:53] so Satan Satan is going to be Cain is
[29:56] working in that motive
[29:58] in a religious realm and it's brother
[30:00] badman says it in power of
[30:01] transformation you can see I'm drawing
[30:03] heavily from these few sermons he says
[30:05] see how religious it was went around to
[30:07] the east side east side
[30:10] right so brother Brown he pointed points
[30:13] us to the fact that him going to the on
[30:16] the East of Eden signaled a particular
[30:19] intent and motive when he found himself
[30:21] on the east side that there is going to
[30:24] bring forth
[30:25] the fruit of religion
[30:29] the fruit of religious covering it's
[30:32] even from the very the very thing that
[30:34] Adam and the woman hid themselves in
[30:35] they take the from a fig tree and they
[30:38] dress themselves what was that the first
[30:40] religious move and remember uses that
[30:43] example religion is a covering and so
[30:45] now when Cain is going and when he first
[30:48] offers up worship and he offers up a
[30:50] sacrifice here then it is again it's in
[30:53] that that family of covering himself
[30:55] through carnal means
[30:57] it's a false religion it's a mimic it's
[30:59] wheat's evil twin
[31:01] and it's even in the same
[31:04] brother Branham identifies this I'm not
[31:06] going to read the statements here but I
[31:07] just grabbed the scriptures where in
[31:09] Genesis 13 it says lot chose uh all the
[31:12] plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed East
[31:15] and as he journeyed East that's where he
[31:17] separates from Abraham why because
[31:19] Abraham's not going to be religious but
[31:20] he's going to be true
[31:22] he's going to be in spirit and in truth
[31:23] so Abraham the true seed he the one
[31:25] that's called and elected he remains and
[31:28] it's just the religious that separate
[31:30] because they're going to journey into
[31:31] religion they journey into some other
[31:33] they have other motives they have other
[31:34] objectives and so even the name lot
[31:37] means covering
[31:39] and so it tells us he's connected with
[31:42] the sin in the beginning he's associated
[31:44] with that original sin it Associates it
[31:45] with Cain who's using the covering using
[31:48] the pretense and using the religious
[31:49] move so it tells us that he was in the
[31:51] Land of Nod it tells us that he built
[31:52] cities we're all recognizing the
[31:54] different elements of Cain of worldly
[31:56] kingdoms and then there's a religious
[31:58] hint to it because if I could say this
[32:01] and I know that I'm not going to touch
[32:03] on it tonight but maybe this will get
[32:05] you really hungry and pulling on this
[32:08] uh maybe even people change their
[32:09] vacation plans or something if it sounds
[32:11] exciting enough
[32:13] that this these seeds that are sown
[32:17] we recognize the polygamy the murder the
[32:20] the weapons the armor and all that side
[32:22] and civilization so we can get this
[32:24] image of Babylon and Hedonism and all
[32:26] these things and we feel that today we
[32:29] could identify that plainly in the world
[32:32] today but the same seeds produce
[32:35] spiritual wickedness
[32:37] and religion and Satan himself is
[32:39] transformed as an angel light so this is
[32:41] the statement I want to make that even
[32:42] though it may appear they're divided
[32:45] they are united
[32:48] even though it may appear these worldly
[32:50] kingdoms and the religious realm are
[32:52] against each other and they rally
[32:54] against each other right and one is this
[32:57] and one is that and they seem to be
[32:58] opposed to one another they're actually
[33:00] furthering the same agenda because given
[33:04] the opportunity you pull the curtain
[33:05] back they are United against the truth
[33:09] the thing they have in common is the
[33:11] thing that'll always bring them together
[33:12] is they can always bitter enemies can
[33:15] always unite together against truth
[33:19] and so now brother better makes this
[33:20] statement in the handwriting on the wall
[33:22] and this is kind of helping me
[33:24] uh it's almost like I've you know kind
[33:26] of able to accelerate a little bit
[33:27] quicker here it says in everything that
[33:29] is on Earth today in the way of
[33:31] spiritual things such as the spirit of
[33:32] God and the spirit of the devil and all
[33:35] the Cults and everything that we have
[33:36] today in the world they begin in Genesis
[33:38] Genesis means the beginning and all
[33:41] those things yet under another name and
[33:43] under another form but the same spirit
[33:44] that begin in Genesis brings it out and
[33:47] it's just like a tree growing coming up
[33:49] to a head where it'll all come to a
[33:51] climax in the end that's why this
[33:53] Parable is so important at the end the
[33:55] seat of discrepancy is so important to
[33:56] identify at the end for the great
[33:58] judgments of God where he will settle
[34:00] all things
[34:01] and all that had a beginning will have
[34:03] an end that's just something to really
[34:05] Ponder
[34:06] all that had a beginning will have an
[34:08] end just those things which had not a
[34:09] beginning has no end
[34:13] so God God has to God is Planning around
[34:16] that
[34:17] all that at the beginning we'll have an
[34:18] end just those things which had not a
[34:19] beginning have no end
[34:21] but notice it all the seeds sown in
[34:25] Genesis that we see here in Genesis 4
[34:26] he's saying they are here in the end and
[34:30] they're climaxing at the end
[34:33] laodicea is Satan's achievement
[34:37] in the sermon in Israel and the church
[34:39] this is part four and he says some other
[34:41] things I think it's part three where
[34:42] he's touching on some real important
[34:45] factors about the kingdom he says you
[34:46] notice that all those Cults of this day
[34:47] are beginning in Genesis they had their
[34:49] start back in Genesis winding up out
[34:52] here in the last day for instance many
[34:54] of them like how that formal religion
[34:57] begin and came how it come on out and
[35:00] come down through the sons of Noah him
[35:02] out of him he had Nimrod Nimrod built
[35:06] the Tower of Babylon this is kind of
[35:07] where we're able to just to do the
[35:08] thousands of years of History so formal
[35:11] religion begins in Cain it comes
[35:12] survives through the ark Nimrod built
[35:14] the tire Babel
[35:16] Babel comes down through King
[35:17] Nebuchadnezzar's time and on Outlander
[35:19] Revelations Babylon
[35:21] so you have Babylon is in Nimrod and
[35:24] that Kingdom of Babylon just continues
[35:25] to expand and that's what God called
[35:27] Abraham out of is out of Babylon he's
[35:30] using that in the very beginning to show
[35:32] us something but it's Babylon that ends
[35:34] up in the end and now not so much as
[35:37] just a nimrod or Nebuchadnezzar but as a
[35:40] beautiful church as a beautiful woman
[35:43] comes out in Revelation he calls it
[35:45] Babylon he says how that little seed
[35:47] started way back there at the East side
[35:50] of the gates of Eden
[35:52] so that's where he wants to bring it
[35:53] that's where you see but remember
[35:54] showing us this is something religious
[35:56] too
[35:57] it's not just the murder it's not just
[35:58] the uh the fornication and the lust and
[36:01] all those things but it has this
[36:03] religious side to it coming on down
[36:05] winding out all kinds of Cults and
[36:07] everything started back there winding
[36:09] themselves out to the end
[36:11] he says now and again this series Israel
[36:13] in the churches I recommend it to
[36:15] everyone to listen to because this
[36:17] prophet's coming off of being in the
[36:18] field and he's telling us this is what
[36:20] I've seen this is where we're at and he
[36:21] wants to use Israel as an example to
[36:23] show us where the church was at he says
[36:25] now it behooves us to watch be careful
[36:27] be set in the word many things are
[36:30] taking place today which are
[36:31] unscriptural let's watch the scripture
[36:33] be sure that we are right
[36:36] I think that's very very good advice
[36:38] connects back to what he's saying in
[36:39] seated discrepancy the things that are
[36:41] happening today this is appropriate for
[36:43] us to look at these things these are
[36:44] things that ought to be preached on and
[36:46] things that ought to be talked about and
[36:48] I'll say
[36:49] I'm not I'm not saying that brother
[36:51] Branham gave me my marching orders and
[36:54] that what I'm preaching needs to be
[36:56] talked about but go back and listen to
[36:57] what he preached on it
[36:59] listen to what he preached we're here as
[37:01] a voice amplifying what's been brought
[37:03] and if God has gifted us what all we
[37:05] want to do is just bring out his brother
[37:06] bam said we would from the word the
[37:08] things that have been spoken before so
[37:10] that we can get a revelation of it it
[37:12] can give us life and Empower us and so
[37:14] we want to watch ourselves and be
[37:16] careful be set in the word because
[37:18] there's a lot of unscriptural things
[37:19] that are happening today but Satan
[37:21] always presents himself in scriptural
[37:23] ways
[37:25] so you've got to be able to identify
[37:27] these worldly kingdoms
[37:30] now if you would allow me to I want to
[37:32] just
[37:34] take a little bit of a turn here
[37:37] because I want to end on a good note
[37:40] in Matthew Chapter 4 verses 8 9 8 9 and
[37:42] 10.
[37:44] and this is to
[37:46] like just kind of maybe seal up
[37:49] the worldly kingdoms that exist today
[37:51] because I'm going to pick I want to pick
[37:53] up maybe on this verse on Sunday
[37:56] wants to recognize Satan's the one that
[37:58] did this
[37:59] Satan has these Powers he has this way
[38:01] that he's working and so I know it's
[38:03] going to seem real gloomy for the next
[38:04] 10 minutes but then I'm gonna I'm gonna
[38:06] punch back at Satan a little bit
[38:08] so now in the Temptation Of Christ it
[38:10] says again the devil taketh them up into
[38:12] an exceeding high mountain
[38:13] and showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[38:16] world and the glory of them it's from
[38:18] this verse that I got the phrase worldly
[38:20] kingdoms
[38:22] if we just use less ink if than saying
[38:24] kingdoms of the world so he showed them
[38:26] all kingdoms of the world and the glory
[38:28] of them and saith unto him this is Satan
[38:30] now saying I've showed them all the
[38:31] kingdoms of the world and the glory
[38:34] the power The Prestige
[38:37] just oh wow you'd be in Wonder of it
[38:40] and he says all these will I give thee
[38:44] if that will fall down and worship me
[38:46] that's it that's Lucifer's agenda in the
[38:48] very beginning
[38:49] that's what he wanted in the very
[38:51] beginning he wanted Michael to worship
[38:52] him he wanted all the angels to bow down
[38:54] to worship him he wanted to supplant and
[38:55] you serve God and so here he is he's not
[38:58] hiding it at all this is his ambition
[39:00] and this is the Temptation that really
[39:02] could only come to the Messiah he says
[39:04] all these things will I give thee if
[39:07] thou will fall down and worship me
[39:10] and I love how Jesus answers this
[39:12] because he's just I think his answers
[39:16] it assumes some things and he doesn't
[39:18] really get he doesn't get caught up in
[39:19] the argument with him he just answers
[39:21] get the hint Satan and he uses the word
[39:24] once again for it is written Thou shalt
[39:26] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[39:27] shalt thou serve notice how he does not
[39:30] answer in any way to give any
[39:32] credibility to what Satan has said he
[39:34] just uses the word he's not going to
[39:36] debate oh well you think you own these
[39:37] things and you think you're great huh
[39:39] well yeah let me tell you something yeah
[39:40] he just says you know what the word says
[39:43] Thou shalt not worship you should only
[39:45] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[39:46] shalt not serve so he's saying get the
[39:48] hints I got word for this get get behind
[39:50] me
[39:52] and so when when he says all the
[39:54] kingdoms of this world we're using the
[39:56] phrase we're only kingdoms but this is
[39:57] the kingdoms of this world I want you to
[39:59] think Satan's Eden I want you to think
[40:01] about the fact that he's the God of this
[40:02] evil age he's the prince of the power of
[40:04] the air and how Satan has all this
[40:06] control over the world today and it's
[40:08] the very reason why some of us start
[40:09] having a hard time when we start talking
[40:11] about the world in positive ways and
[40:13] that for God so loved the world and
[40:15] there's a world that God loved and that
[40:16] God wants to redeem the Earth and God's
[40:18] not going to completely annihilate it
[40:19] and there's a lot of things we start
[40:21] wrestling with because we have taken the
[40:23] world that we see today and we say
[40:25] that's Satan's world
[40:27] I'm going to read from to you from oh
[40:31] maybe five different places real quick
[40:33] just quick bullet points I don't have
[40:34] the slides here but I just want to read
[40:36] these to you because I've been reading
[40:37] every place I could find in the message
[40:39] of the hour where brother banham
[40:40] referred to the scripture
[40:42] and he says and so these just kind of
[40:43] give us some more uh color to what he
[40:46] says what the scripture means it says
[40:48] when Jesus was taken up on the high
[40:50] mountain by Satan
[40:52] he let him look down through the stream
[40:53] of time
[40:55] and showed him all the world and the
[40:56] kingdoms thereof so he didn't lift him
[40:59] up just to see the Roman Empire he
[41:00] wasn't seeing uh kingdoms that might
[41:02] have existed in other lands at the time
[41:04] and and maybe the power of Egypt or the
[41:06] power of Greece he's he's raising him up
[41:08] to Sea in the Stream of time
[41:12] all the world kingdoms of this world and
[41:14] he sees them all and the glory of them
[41:17] and then his brother says and he showed
[41:18] him all the kingdoms of the world in a
[41:20] moment of time so here he's able to see
[41:22] spread throughout history and I would
[41:25] even say these future kingdoms because
[41:26] he looked down to the stream of time and
[41:28] he identified all these kingdoms he says
[41:30] just think of that in other words he
[41:32] just opened up and he saw all the
[41:34] kingdoms of the world United States
[41:36] Russia Great Britain all of them
[41:39] and he said these are mine Satan did
[41:44] he says Jesus knew they were his
[41:47] friends Satan's
[41:49] so as he as he shows him this and you'll
[41:51] find this in the many different places
[41:52] brother Adam refers to it that Satan
[41:55] shows them all the kingdoms of this
[41:56] world and Jesus doesn't debate with them
[41:59] he he recognizes you're the only one who
[42:02] could produce these things
[42:04] you've set the ball rolling you set
[42:07] these things in motion so he could see
[42:09] uh he could see where this was going
[42:12] what a remarkable I just think about it
[42:14] just now how remarkable that would have
[42:16] been here's the Messiah coming
[42:19] after all those years
[42:21] and and here he is he's sitting there
[42:25] and and I guess you'd say whether I
[42:28] would know the exact time but four
[42:29] thousand years he sets there
[42:31] and here's the Messiah who's prophesied
[42:34] and he's shown Satan's able to show him
[42:37] that a couple thousand years later man
[42:40] there's going to be kingdoms far
[42:42] surpassing the ones that he sees Russia
[42:44] Great Britain the United States and
[42:47] program says every nation under the
[42:49] heaven is dominated by Satan
[42:51] so he could show him all the kingdoms of
[42:53] this world he says now in another place
[42:55] and think of this he says and as long as
[42:56] they're controlled by Satan they've got
[42:58] that satanic thoughts and Powers they'll
[43:01] just fight until Jesus comes
[43:04] as long as they're controlled by Satan
[43:06] that's all there are fights and wars and
[43:08] backstabbings and and breaking of
[43:11] treaties and uh sabotage and terrorism
[43:13] he says as long as this is as long as
[43:15] there's they're controlled by Satan
[43:17] that's what happens he says and that's
[43:19] the reason we have wars and killings is
[43:21] because these kingdoms of the world are
[43:22] controlled by the devil and as long as
[43:25] they're controlled by the devil we will
[43:27] continue to have wars and fightings and
[43:29] killing one another
[43:31] that's what we've got
[43:33] why because all the kingdoms of this
[43:35] world are controlled by Satan
[43:38] and Satan is able to show Jesus in his
[43:41] temptation I want you to see not just in
[43:44] this time alone where you are here as
[43:45] the Messiah and we kind of all thinking
[43:47] that when the Messiah comes he's going
[43:49] to overthrow the oppressors of Israel
[43:50] but he's able to show them kingdoms
[43:52] persisting for a couple thousand years
[43:54] and their Glory of them and all the
[43:56] powers and Satan is saying these are
[43:57] mine
[43:59] and he offers them to Jesus as if he
[44:01] owned them and brother bam says Jesus
[44:03] knew that Satan did he knew that Satan
[44:05] controlled him brother Bam's coming back
[44:06] and affirming yes Satan is the
[44:08] controller of all of it but remember God
[44:10] will only allow it for him to bring to
[44:12] pass his plan
[44:15] and that's the kingdoms of this world
[44:19] so the sermon power of transformation
[44:23] listen to how brother Branham describes
[44:25] this he says he had six thousand years
[44:27] to do it with his poison spray
[44:31] and how did he do it he says now this is
[44:32] the Striking part
[44:34] he says and listen close he did it
[44:38] by civilization
[44:40] because that sounds strange but that's
[44:42] what
[44:45] amen just give me an amen if it sounds
[44:47] strange
[44:48] it does it sounds strange
[44:51] and I I committed myself
[44:54] to just really letting that just wash
[44:57] over me I I I wanted it to eat at me
[45:01] I want to think that you're you're that
[45:02] we're being taught and it's the truth
[45:05] Satan produced he did by civilization
[45:10] and and what caught me what finally
[45:13] caught me
[45:15] is to be civilized
[45:17] it all it to be civilized it's a term
[45:20] that's used if we're looking at how that
[45:23] we would use the word in our English and
[45:25] maybe it's it's Roots it would be used
[45:28] to describe somebody that's not barbaric
[45:31] or inhuman
[45:34] and so you would look at societies that
[45:36] are uncivilized and they live more
[45:39] simple and rudimentary and and they live
[45:40] closer to the Earth and maybe they don't
[45:42] dress very much and they don't have
[45:43] churches and they don't believe in a god
[45:45] they have different kinds of worship and
[45:47] so you would look at someone who's in a
[45:48] barbarian and they would live in a very
[45:50] inhumane way and then brother Adam is
[45:53] saying but Satan started all
[45:54] civilization
[45:56] and then it struck me just how
[45:57] self-aware Satan was
[46:00] that he that he works in Civilization
[46:02] why because he's trying to cover up the
[46:05] fact that he is in fact inhuman
[46:09] that the whole world has been overspread
[46:11] through barbarism and through mixed seed
[46:13] and mixed race and that's that's what's
[46:15] populated the whole earth so of course
[46:17] he wants to set himself forth as being
[46:20] very very civilized
[46:22] hey now he's the one that wants class
[46:23] and he's the one everyone to think no no
[46:25] no no no no no no don't think for a
[46:27] second that there's any any beast in
[46:30] this
[46:31] this is beautiful
[46:32] remember the beast at the beginning and
[46:35] the Beast at the end the Beauty and the
[46:37] Beast
[46:37] there's your story Disney's just picking
[46:40] on it that there is that what Satan is
[46:42] setting out to do he says he worked
[46:44] through civilization because it has
[46:45] everything to do with pretense
[46:47] has everything to do with binding to
[46:50] putting on this this show and goes back
[46:52] to Satan's desire in the beginning or if
[46:54] I could say Cain's actions in the
[46:56] beginning he built a city he civilized
[46:58] because he knew his unruly nature he
[47:01] knew the things that existed and so he
[47:03] had only one way to perpetuate it
[47:05] without the chaos in the Anarchy
[47:07] civilization bondage fear organization
[47:12] wow
[47:14] it still sounds strange that it'd be
[47:17] civilization he says I'm going to make a
[47:18] statement here that'll keep you guessing
[47:19] maybe for a few minutes I hope not but
[47:22] you realize this now I'm not trying to
[47:24] support ignorance but did you know that
[47:27] Civilization Science Education and
[47:28] things that we cherish so great today is
[47:31] the very instrument of Satan even
[47:33] civilization
[47:35] civilization never came by come by God
[47:38] civilization come by Satan now I'm going
[47:41] to read it I'm going to continue reading
[47:42] here and this will make more sense than
[47:45] when I read it he's talking about what
[47:47] we see as civilization it's not saying
[47:50] that God's not a god of order God's not
[47:52] a God of this and decency that he's not
[47:53] saying that he's saying what we know to
[47:55] be civilization is not God's original
[47:58] we don't look at we don't look at things
[48:00] in certain orders and seeing things a
[48:02] certain way and go oh wow this is so
[48:05] good and this is so Godly and we start
[48:06] talking about all the things that we
[48:08] love and enjoy whether it be you know a
[48:10] car that doesn't use gas and there's no
[48:11] combustion engines or whatever it might
[48:13] be that we might think oh this is
[48:14] progress we're doing wonderful and you
[48:16] know the fact that everyone wears
[48:17] clothes and people take showers and we
[48:19] have all sorts of things to take care of
[48:21] bad breath and we say oh these are good
[48:23] things hey this is this is progress this
[48:25] is civilization how how could we EXA
[48:28] exist without civilization so it's not
[48:30] that God's not a god of cleanliness and
[48:32] Order and things but if that what we see
[48:36] Satan began he says civilization never
[48:37] come by God civilization come by Satan
[48:40] now prove that to you by the word just
[48:42] in a few minutes civilization is not of
[48:44] God for let me show you in this
[48:46] civilization the more civilized we get
[48:48] as we work through science we're always
[48:50] killing ourselves it's more true today
[48:51] than it's ever been
[48:54] it says in this civilization is built up
[48:56] to its Pinnacle now I want you to catch
[48:58] that it's at its peak
[49:00] and we got death in this civilization we
[49:03] got sin in this civilization we got
[49:05] sickness in the civilization he says
[49:07] that can't be of God
[49:11] so God
[49:13] in his great own kingdom that is to come
[49:15] we will have a civilization
[49:19] all right he says but it will not be
[49:21] anything like this
[49:22] it won't be by science it'll be a faith
[49:25] Civilization by the word
[49:29] a faith Civilization by the word oh God
[49:34] does that not Inspire us then that let's
[49:36] cultivate that kind of Civilization now
[49:38] that I don't need to be cultivated by
[49:41] science and deformed by science and and
[49:43] deformed by politics and deformed by
[49:45] pretense and all the pressures that
[49:47] exist in the world today it's just
[49:49] trying to deform you and it has access
[49:52] to defamation by virtue of your first
[49:54] birth and your first nature but you
[49:56] who've been born again from above you
[49:58] have a different nature and a different
[50:00] nurture which wants to transform you not
[50:02] deform you and it can transform you into
[50:05] a faith civilization
[50:07] Hallelujah
[50:09] because God one day in his own great
[50:11] Kingdom that will come will have
[50:13] civilization and it won't be anything
[50:14] like this
[50:17] he says it talks about here we're here
[50:20] on Earth
[50:22] trying to just find where he says it
[50:28] he says we're being we're supposed to
[50:29] stay here but God's Great civilization
[50:31] won't have any of that in it
[50:34] because science has taken the natural
[50:35] things and perverting it
[50:38] so God's going to have a civilization
[50:40] let me say this in closing do not this
[50:42] has been at the heart I think if you go
[50:44] back to the the last service
[50:47] the end the the last part of the series
[50:49] that we preached the first part which
[50:51] was the last part
[50:52] do not confuse what it means to be a
[50:55] pilgrim and a stranger
[50:57] because again that's what the pope wants
[50:58] you to think
[51:00] is that you're just passing through here
[51:02] just doing your time on Earth and you're
[51:04] going to get spit out into eternal hell
[51:05] you're going to get spit out into
[51:06] Eternal heaven and that's what this
[51:08] world is all about just just a temporary
[51:10] Passage Point
[51:12] on Sunday we said if even but for a
[51:14] moment in there in Genesis 2 1 2 that
[51:17] the world existed as the opposite
[51:20] of the king of Heaven eternity
[51:23] but God transformed it into an Eden
[51:26] now Satan has come and done what
[51:28] transformed it right back to chaos in
[51:30] darkness again
[51:32] but God's made a promise
[51:34] God's made a promise and let's not
[51:36] forget this let's not misinterpret what
[51:37] it means to be pilgrims and strangers
[51:39] Abraham's sojourned as in a Strange Land
[51:43] as a pilgrim and stranger but remember
[51:45] that was his land
[51:47] he was promised it it's going to be his
[51:49] seeds and his seed after him so even
[51:51] though he might have seemed like a
[51:53] stranger and seemed like a pilgrim it
[51:55] was something that he owned and I
[51:58] believe that the devil wants you more
[51:59] than ever to begin to feel so strange
[52:02] and so was strange to where you just
[52:04] give up and languish but if you could
[52:07] recognize I just can't seem to hold it
[52:09] in anymore we have been made Kings and
[52:11] Priests and the Dominion is here now and
[52:14] our Dominion is Over The World the Flesh
[52:17] the sin and the devil right now we're
[52:20] ruling and reigning over the world sin
[52:23] the flesh the devil the devil wants you
[52:25] to think that you're just some sort of
[52:27] heaven-bound Earth that goes restricted
[52:30] creature
[52:31] it's more than that
[52:35] I'd say it's the lies of Catholicism
[52:38] that just the shadows of it there still
[52:40] speak to us and try to keep us
[52:41] compromised
[52:43] we say this world is not my home but it
[52:45] only relates to the Eden that Satan is
[52:46] controlling now because it says in
[52:48] Revelations chapter 11 verse 15 and the
[52:50] seventh angel sounded and there were
[52:52] great voices in heaven saying the
[52:54] kingdoms of this world are become the
[52:57] kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ
[53:00] and he shall reign forever and ever
[53:04] Hallelujah
[53:06] I believe these worldly kingdoms are not
[53:08] to scare us these worldly kings that you
[53:10] only exist here but for a few more days
[53:13] because it has been prophesied that the
[53:16] king of glory will assume power once
[53:18] again and all the kingdoms of this world
[53:21] are become the kingdoms of Our Lord
[53:24] Satan tried to offer him to him
[53:27] just as he did Eve
[53:30] offered a different way
[53:33] Eve accepted
[53:35] the very thing
[53:37] that was offered to Christ
[53:40] he said no I won't do it
[53:42] musicians if you please come in the
[53:44] sermon proving his word he said this son
[53:45] of the Virgin was the word made manifest
[53:48] now Saint John if you want to read that
[53:49] this Prophet this Prophet too he said
[53:51] but this son of the Virgin was the word
[53:52] made manifest the beginning of the
[53:54] creation of God
[53:56] now the whole earth is God's creation
[53:59] but it's lost
[54:00] then he redeemed this Earth
[54:03] and you are a part of the Earth
[54:06] and it redeems you by the same way he
[54:08] redeems the whole Earth
[54:10] remember I trust some of you are
[54:12] listening to a reading the future home
[54:14] he says now this son of the Virgin was
[54:16] the word made manifest in the beginning
[54:18] was the word and the Word was with God
[54:20] and the Word was God and the Word was
[54:21] made flesh and dwelt Among Us and here's
[54:24] Matthew chapter 4.
[54:26] Satan tried every scheme
[54:28] to make him discredit this
[54:31] Satan tried everything he could to make
[54:33] him discredited
[54:34] try to get him to take the kingdom
[54:36] without suffering
[54:39] try to get him to take it without
[54:40] Redemption notice how brother brings it
[54:43] back to Genesis 1 2 3 when it was God's
[54:46] plan in the Garden of Eden when he
[54:48] killed the lamb that only by Blood would
[54:51] he take it
[54:52] take the Earth
[54:54] even promised him all the kingdoms of
[54:57] the world if he would take it just think
[55:00] of what a promise
[55:02] I hope that that just kind of leaves you
[55:04] in a good state
[55:05] to recognize that Satan he had power
[55:08] over all of it
[55:09] and in that moment he offers it to Jesus
[55:12] but Jesus knows you can give it to me
[55:15] now but if I take it now I'll come to it
[55:19] in a way that I'm not supposed to just
[55:23] like you allowed to eat to come to it in
[55:26] a way that she wasn't supposed to and
[55:29] had she just waited for the promise I
[55:31] would have come forth and if I now in
[55:33] manifestation fall for the same lie I'll
[55:36] do the same thing that the woman did and
[55:40] the promise I'll have all the kingdoms
[55:42] and I could sit there ruling and
[55:43] reigning and and Satan could be
[55:46] worshiped through me in this place he
[55:48] could give it all to me but that's not
[55:50] the way that it's supposed to come it's
[55:52] got to come by Blood I've got to shed my
[55:54] blood upon the Earth to undo the curse
[55:57] to redeem what you've defiled and to
[55:59] bring forth all the spoken word seeds
[56:01] that are already laying in the earth oh
[56:04] Hallelujah the saint was trying to trip
[56:06] him up but Jesus saw the plan
[56:11] there was just one Kingdom that Satan
[56:13] couldn't see
[56:15] and there in the Stream of time in the
[56:17] moment of time Satan's showing them all
[56:19] the kingdoms all the kingdoms all the
[56:20] way down to Great Britain Russia and the
[56:22] USA and Satan's like you like that do
[56:26] you want it and just beyond that Jesus
[56:28] sees a bride
[56:31] Kingdom
[56:32] in a woman
[56:34] and he sees I can have all this
[56:36] but if I take it now I won't have that
[56:40] he says I'm sorry
[56:41] the glory of that Kingdom
[56:43] the glory of that woman
[56:45] the glory of that City the glory of one
[56:48] Jerusalem the glory of the New Jerusalem
[56:50] the glory of one kingdom is greater than
[56:53] all the kingdoms of this world it's
[56:55] greater than everything that you could
[56:56] show me he said no for the joy which is
[56:59] set before me I won't take it now
[57:01] without suffering I won't take it out
[57:03] with now without Redemption I won't take
[57:04] a now without the shedding of blood
[57:06] because if I shed my blood even those
[57:09] kingdoms that you raise up will be
[57:10] subject to me in the end I will have
[57:13] them in the end
[57:15] but it'll come God's provided way
[57:17] God's chosen way
[57:19] God bless you this evening let's stand
[57:21] to our feet
[57:22] [Music]
