TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 12 verses 1 to 9. genesis chapter 12 verses 1 to 9. my thought this morning is going to be very compact in the sense that we're wanting just to deliver a very a simple thought related to the life of abraham and continuing on the subject of supreme faith revealed in abraham and i just trust that the lord will bless you with this thought i had been wrestling all day yesterday and not feeling well and then also just really burdened in terms of what direction to take in the service and then elizabeth had just mentioned to me just how much the morales family was hurting and it was just in that moment it crystallized to me and i just felt this uh it just felt like the picture became completely clear and so i really feel that the lord has um given me a direct thought and a trust it would be a blessing to you genesis chapter 12 we're going to start with verse one read the verse nine we will be reading some of these verses again and we'll provide some backup and some context to this as we continue now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house and to a land that i will show thee and i'll make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed so abram departed as the lord had spoken to him and lot went with them and abram was 70 and 5 years old when he departed out of haren and abram took sarah his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in herein and they went forth to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came and abram passed through the land unto the place of shechem unto the plain amore and the canaanite was then in the land and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him and i removed from fence into a mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and haiy on the east and there he builded an altar into the lord and called upon the name of the lord and abram journeyed going on still toward the south by just on on the move can you relate today even as a church even they just journeyed a little bit further south amen god bless you can be seated the subject is as i mentioned a moment ago supreme faith revealed in abraham and maybe finding a way just to succinctly um kind of capture what my thesis statement is with respect to this subject is that we're trying to we're looking at how his life makes perfect faith relatable and we talk about perfect faith and rapturing faith and the faith of god's elect and end time faith is a way that that faith can seem impossible out of reach or not practical um even some might feel that it's unattainable and that the the faith of this hour and what the word of god has been revealed to us they feel that they can only believe it not live it but really if you begin to look at the life of abraham you find that his uh his faith is more relatable than we might think it is we think of the father of our faith it's a is a very relatable faith and abraham's faith and even the outcome of that faith was a was a journey and it wasn't that in genesis chapter 12 that god as they did as he bragged on job he's not necessarily bragging the same way on abraham because he's just saying hey get up away from thy country from my father's house and thy kindred and so abraham begins an adjourning and there was a process that began to work within abraham's life and it's through that process that abraham becomes the father of our faith he wasn't designated on day one look at this man of robust faith and perfect faith i'm going to choose him among all the unfaithful in the world he picked him by grace he was an ordinary man chosen by god and so we want to look at his faith in order to make it relate relatable to us and also give us courage and then i remind you that abraham's faith grew as he routinely trusted god it was it was something that god gave him a promise and when he trusted in that promise and he waited on god to fulfill that promise and so this is how his faith grew he grew through this routine of recognizing the promises of god submitting to the promise of god and watching god bring it to pass and so in that uh in that daily routine there was obedience to the call of god and there was worship and i wanted to take a few moments and this kind of maybe picks up some of the themes that we've been ministering onto the last few services as a reminder how that abraham's obedience to offer isaac as a sacrifice to god was not blind trust and there's a way that we kind of look at the faith of abraham and say well he just heard a voice he thought it was god he just believed it and he obeyed it and we kind of may we can make abraham's obedience on mount moriah just kind of like well whatever god says and going to do it and abraham's just kind of covering his eyes and bearing his head in the sand and just doing whatever god says and abraham was obedient specifically to what god asked him to do but by this time he's decades into walking with god and he's not just blindly following a god who told him to kill his only son but he has an understanding there's a revelation behind what he is doing and james captures it in james chapter 2 verse 22 it says see us thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect and so by this offering of isaac and specifically in james chapter 2 i realize now i just kind of pulled the scripture out very quickly he's referring to how that his it's when he offered up his son upon the altar and that this was a justification of his faith and that his works demonstrated his faith had been made perfect it reached its full supreme expression when he willingly offered isaac upon the altar and so this was abraham's perfect faith he began in faith and as he walked with god it came to a perfect faith and it was not let me put it this way in order for his faith to be perfect it required an understanding of god in order for his faith to be perfect it required more than just him saying well oh that's what god said that i'm going to do it but it was through this this understanding of the nature of god the character of the nature of the promises to to abraham so we've identified in this scripture that abraham had been given a promise even as we see here i'm going to bless you and all the families in the earth are gonna be blessed through you that as he walked with god and the promise became more clear more crystallized i'm gonna give you a land i'm gonna be your god forever i'm gonna give you a son that he could come to a place where he could say hey god promised me many descendants through isaac then if i if i'm sacrificing isaac today the scripture tells us that he obeyed knowing that god was able to raise him from the dead and so his willingness to sacrifice isaac was based upon a revelation that had unfolded in his understanding that god has power over death and he quickened my body he quickened the womb of my wife he can quicken my son back to life if he doesn't spare his life so it was one with understanding his perfect faith was uh based upon an understanding of not just god said it and i believe it but an understanding of the nature and the character of god that spoke in hebrews chapter 11 verses 5 and 6 it says by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god so enoch had a faith which translated him a walk with god that wasn't it wasn't uh one morning he was walking with god and it was the first time he ever walked with god and god said hey enoch get out of bed let's go on a walk but this was a daily life a life where he uh a daily routine of walking with god and so he had a life where it says he was uh he had this testimony that he pleased god he walked with god he had a testimony that he was close to god and so this is what was required for enoch's translation and then it says but without faith this is instructive to all of us hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him and this to me amplifies the faith of enoch that enoch was walking with god and in his walk with god he began to understand the nature and character of god he could trust in him more and he began to know more about his desires and more about his will and more about his his certain attributes and characteristics because it says without faith it's impossible to please him so enoch had that faith he says for he that cometh to god must believe that he is so this is a belief in god and an understanding of his existence and his presence and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so it tells me that enoch's faith was not just believing in a deity or believing in a higher power or believing in one that was greater than him and looking at creation and saying wow this just couldn't be by accident but enoch's translating faith grew through a walk with god that he had a walk with god and in walking with god his faith grew and as he walked with him he began to understand more about the nature of god and he gained an understanding of god's character because we could say that enoch had translating faith and a faith that pleased god so he believed that he was but he also knew that he was a rewarder he knew something about the things that god wants to give he knew something about the character of god and what it responded to so there was more about just believing in a higher power it was something about his promises and his nature and his character and his trustworthiness it wouldn't be difficult maybe for some of us to look at a physical specimen and say wow you're stronger than me you could beat me up but then it's something else to be able to trust the nature and the character of that person to do what they say and so it wasn't just believing that god was a higher power and supernatural but it was understanding his character and what constrained him and what motivated him so this i'm wanting just to emphasize this part of there's a journey and a process when it comes to perfect faith and luke chapter 6 verse 40 jesus is talking about the blind being leaders of the blind he says the disciple is not above his master and we realize that that uh if one is being discipled and one is being taught the student is not greater than the teacher but it says but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master and jesus is specifically identifying this process of learning a process of growing in a process of development wherein you have a student you have a disciple who has a teacher has a master who is disciplining them and teaching them and the student begins to learn to trust and as they they touch that decision the teachers they just trust the master they're learning to trust but then they're also learning from trusting so as you learn to trust and you trust in someone through that trust and that reliance you can learn from trusting and really if you think about it what you have to get you have to have confidence in the one that's teaching you and once you learn to trust them then you can learn from your trust and that's exactly what jesus is identifying as a process where you begin not knowing you begin unable you begin just simply learning to trust and relying on but he's demonstrating expressing this principle that the student though he may begin so far below his master through learning to trust and then learning by trusting and learning through this trust and through this relationship the the master's desire is to raise the disciple up to his level and this is exactly what jesus is identifying because he says look be ye therefore perfect even as your heavenly father which is in heaven is perfect now it's god's desire through discipleship and mentoring and teaching and the process of trusting that you could become like him so god does not desire to just always beat you down and make you feel uh completely broken and helpless that's that's that's human mechanisms that have capitalized on certain things in the word of god to always make you feel sick and broken and unable so that you can be manipulated and controlled but god wants to raise you up to a place of trust and confidence in him that you could be a perfect expression of his character and his attributes we we used this statement a number of times in this pro in these number of services we spoke on the subject but brother braham says in the sermon baum and gilead he says the one thing that we have to move up to now is a supreme faith to what we have had so he's saying you have a faith but there's a level there's a rapturing faith there's a growth in faith to a supreme faith he says you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you were doing abraham's willingness to offer isaac as a sacrifice was a supreme faith and he knew what he was doing not just blindly trusting he knew what he was doing then he uses this example you just say well i'm going home i'm going out i'm going to start the car that's all an act of faith he's he's mentioning these regular routine the daily habits as an act of faith tomorrow i'll meet you at a certain place that's all an act of faith because you've just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you well that's the way the things of god are after you have trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just like a regular routine that doesn't mean that it's common doesn't mean that it loses its uh supernatural significance or this character of being divine but he's saying that you learn to trust him and entrust in him so frequently and watching him stand behind his word time and time again it just becomes a routine that if god said it i believe it's going to happen and then we're able to take a step back and say well he said he would do this and he did it and he did this for this person and he got me out of this situation and then you're able to kind of begin to put the puzzle together and say well why am i so worried about this if he did this for me did that for them if he's answered this prayer if he's brought me this far if he's arranged all these other things then why can't i believe for this part and so it's through this trust in him you watch him do so many things to where you just get in this routine inhabit and this instinct of trusting god and he said that's the way the rapture is going to be it's going to happen through the regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god that's exactly the way the rapture is going to take place now to the world it just looks like we're doing the regular thing to the world it just looks like we're doing common things but we have an understanding that rapturing faith is being developed and cultivated through the regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god for our life even if the routine doesn't seem it seem extravagant even if the plans of god don't seem to have that pizzazz and sizzle like maybe we think it should it's still bringing out of us rapturing faith now i want to just i'm going to kind of want to take a step back and begin to look at abraham's journey and and focus on some specific details but just to kind of weave a a story that's very direct in terms of his making his experience relatable because abraham's journey to perfect faith is a parallels the path that all of us take as children of god you are the royal seed of abraham we looked at a number of different statements where brother branham said that abraham's faith was an example to our faith that he had been determined to be an example for the people today and that for all of us who have faith in god you have the faith of abraham so we don't want to put him so far off to where he becomes an idol but he becomes one that is an example and that we can relate to him and so he is his faith his journey to perfect faith or supreme faith is a parallel example to us who are children of god and in romans chapter 4 verse 20 i'm going to start with the scripture that immediately makes us feel as if we can't relate to him at all but it says he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god now when we read that it's immediately begin to say oh well never never mind i can't be like abraham because we know we've staggered and we might even be able to testify that in our own experience in our own lives that we've staggered through unbelief that there was times when we didn't believe and we resisted and we ran away and there's some that uh can be very belligerent and adamant that this is false and this is an error this is no longer true but then god comes around and makes himself known and he moves upon the scene and hearts are changed and they look back and say well i haven't always been like abraham and i did stagger but it says he's staggered not at the promise of god so it's the promise of god that kind of becomes the point of his staggering but it says he didn't stagger through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god there's a lot of ways that we could approach this but let me just put it this way as we read brother branham's statement last week where he said you could tell that man didn't write the bible because if abraham was in charge of writing the bible we wouldn't know about any of his mistakes he says would he talk about his cowardness would he write about all of his lies what's important in the writer now and the inspiration of god in romans 4 20 isn't writing about abram in his beginning in genesis 11. his reference point isn't genesis 11 genesis 11 saying he staggered not at the promise of god the the what's written in romans 4 20 is the conclusion of the matter what's written in romans 4 20 is kind of like the final picture not the build up not the work not the process he's not showing us the work he's not showing us the dirty dishes he's not showing us all the the wood chips and the shavings and he's not showing the the progress he's showing you the finished work and i think that's one of the rules if you're posting a remodel project is you show the finished product first and then you show the progress i think isn't that one of the rules if you're going to post something you show the finished product first for all you bloggers instagramers and social media influencers you got just a little bit of help today if you if it's monetized show your love uh hit that subscribe button and whatever else you need to do but uh you you show the finished product that's exactly what's happening here when we read romans 4 20 abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief was strong in faith giving glory to god because we know this isn't the whole story but it's the outcome it's the conclusion when you take abraham's life in total it's the conclusion when you look at his journey from what he began and where he ended up you say here's a man who ultimately came to a place where he could walk in a plain path with god this is his testimony in the end this is the testament how that faith began albeit small it prevailed ultimately in the end because when it says he's staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief it doesn't mean he was without weakness in james chapter 1 verse 12 it says blessed is the man that endureth temptation god said that he would bless abraham abraham was blessed blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life when he remains steadfast under trial when you persevere when tempted when you get back up after you fall he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him this scripture speaks beautifully of abraham because he remained steadfast under trial he was tempted he was tested he was tried he his testimony when you look at his life it it demonstrates a cowardness it demonstrates a line but yet he persevered through those situations he got back up when he fell down and this is wherein how we could relate to abraham because we all have imperfect records my loudest amen this morning i'll refer back to that if i need to wake you up we all have imperfect records right sister eliza as young as you are it's an imperfect record no matter how perfect we think she is as parents but there's a there's an imperfection in our lives we realize i've made mistakes i've wondered i've done things i shouldn't do we have moments of weakness even as born again christians we're driven to do things minor things that we don't want to do there's times when we know that our faith isn't followed that this is what i believe and this is what i'm convinced of but our actions don't necessarily line up with with what our profession is and what we say that we believe and we say well you know this is how i prove my love to him by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom comes allows to come to pass and you're on the phone sister brother branham said that we show our love to him by conducting ourselves with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allow us to come to pass so put your shoulders back and your chin up god's with you he's going to bless you and you hang up the phone and what our plans got canceled we don't we don't always follow the same advice we give everyone else it's faith unfollowed it's moments of weaknesses there's misunderstandings we don't always understand the word of god perfectly there's things that we can profess and believe and there's many that could probably testify that there was things you were just convinced about in the message of the hour and this is the way that it is and i believe this and as you walked with god you come to find out well that wasn't exactly the entire truth part of it part of the process but god washes you and encourages you builds you up you realize that i have the record that wasn't always perfect i have faith that's not always followed i have times of struggle and doubtings and maybe disputings and battles in my mind and weaknesses and misunderstandings and though abraham in the end staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief he prevailed ultimately in the end and that can give us courage because his path was not without distress his path in life was not without disappointments i think this is where god kind of began to really deal with my heart is to try to relate to abraham in that abrahamic suffered extreme discouragement and he had these different crises there's several different instances in scripture where i think you could count uh several maybe up to 10 and that you can count where these are crises these are moments in his life where he's battling something he's facing something he's struggling with something and these are just the ones that are written of there's several chapters that cover his life and and many and really we can say the entire old testament from this point on uh covers his family's life but in just these several chapters it highlights these different instances over decades period of time and you have to realize not every instance not every crisis not every discouragement is mentioned but though there's certain ones that are recorded for our benefit in genesis chapter 12 just make mention of it quickly it tells us that famine drives him out of canaan into egypt and as we've mentioned recently based upon the promise that god had already given him he had reason to trust god and believe that famine could not interrupt the promises of god but famine drives him out of cain and it's different i believe with jacob later on he by instruction of god during a time of famine goes down in gerar but in this time it in not obeying explicit commandment famine drives abraham into into egypt and as they begin to enter in he's like hey honey i'm going to tell a half truth here you're just my sister not my wife because i'm afraid that if they like you they're going to kill me because i'm your husband and he lies about sarah because he's afraid of being killed and we looked into the scripture and realized wow you know that was obviously a lack of understanding on his part because he couldn't die right there's no way that he could have been left for dead permanently he god had made him a promise and he had fully understood i'm not saying he didn't believe the promise but he had yet to fully understand that this promise dictated that if they took his life and murdered him god would have to raise him right back up again and so that just is a an example of abraham striving in a moment of crisis of how will i provide for my wife and how will i provide for my house and and then being afraid of death and lying and fudging with the truth a little bit in genesis chapter 12. in genesis chapter 13 verses 7 and 8 it says and there was strife between the herdmen of abram's cattle and the herdman of lot's cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land so there's this conflict not only with the canaanite and the perizzite where they had to be worried about these fierce tribesmen and they had to be worried about competition for water and in plains and they had to kind of carve out their territory but now it's right within his own family strife with the with the nephew and it says there's strife between the herdmen of abram's cattle and the herdman of lot's counter then abram says the lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee so the conflict of the herdman the conflict of the extended family members this this began to create family drama within with abraham's life he says let there not be strife between me and then between the heard men and thy heard men for we brethren it's okay if we read into this a little bit or at least come to the apparent conclusion that abraham is having difficulty within his family and maybe there's a struggle over resources and who has a right to this and who has a right to that and who got there first and who gets the best water and who gets this and who gets and whose cattle is that and this was maybe a common thing that may not be related to herds herding sheep or cattle anybody having family problems over livestock we can we can draw from this example here in genesis 13. but there's uh but we have differences and we have disagreements and this is something that happens with abram's life and that should make him relatable abram had to deal with family drama and in genesis chapter 14 verse 12 this very one whom he had to separate from and divide himself from it says he is attacked or there's a siege upon these different cities and sodom gomorrah and lot who had chosen to dwell in these watered planes of sodom gomorrah he's made made captive or held captive kidnapped by these kings it says they took lot abram's brother's son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed and what does abram do in response he goes out to rescue his nephew the one he was just fighting with in the chapter before he's now no he's a he's a nephew in need he's a he calls him his brother he's a brother in need i've got to go out i've got to rescue him and he takes his his trained servants and he goes and does battle with these different kings to rescue uh to rescue his nephew lot and we read it like abraham is like oh awesome this is a fight i've got these trained servants we all got our uh we have all got our weapons of warfare let's all just go and hunt these kings down like they were hired mercenaries and this is something they did in their spare time but this would have been a crisis this would have been something where he's like what do i do and i don't have armies and these are five different kings and look what they've done to these cities but there had to be a decision made in the moment of crisis and he follows his faith and he follows his love for his lost loved one to go out and to rescue him from this captivity just a few instances of distress and uh stressors and conflict in abraham's life we come to genesis chapter 20 many years later many different appearances of god to him and the promise unfold and becoming more plain you think oh this is where abraham's faith he will not stagger this is when abraham will have a perfect record and a perfect testimony but he goes down into gur and he's there with abimelech and abimelech thinks his wife is beautiful and he wants to take her to to be one of his own and what does he lie do he lies again he lies again about sarah being his uh sister and what did he what did he say to the abimelech well i mean she is my sister but not of my mother but of my father so we are brother and sister but we just don't share the same mother but she's also my wife right and he tells us kind of half truth to kind of justify himself but he makes this statement in verse 11 and genesis 20 and abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place when you read it you find there was a little bit of a misunderstanding because i think it's in the next chapter uh or maybe it's at the end of genesis chapter 22 where the abimelech is like look i know that you fear god the blessings of god are upon you and and forms a treaty with abraham and he's making the name of abraham great so he might have misjudged the character of abimelech and the people he says they don't fear god and they will slay me for my wife's sake we're not talking about abram in genesis 11. we're talking about abraham in genesis 20. this is abraham who had a lord appeared to him in a dream and division in genesis 15 the lord who confirmed the promise and changed his name in chapter 17 the lord who appeared to him in genesis 18 the the one who was in the form of melchizedek in genesis 14. these are many many years later he'd been in the message for a real long time he had been following the word of god for a really really long time and he's still prone to some of the same mistakes and he's still subject to the same fear of death and willing to tell the same lie that he told in genesis 12 and it still has not come to that full deep understanding abraham you have no reason to fear your own demise nor your wives and that would have been a time of distress and conflict he's a fearful of his life and he's making decisions based upon fear and not fully upon the promise and there's no doubt that that would have led to a discouragement for abraham he might have been discouraged that he had to separate from lot and didn't quite understand why it couldn't work out or just trying to identify briefly different times of distress or discouragement or disappointment in the life of abraham does it give you courage to think that abraham had many different crises and conflicts and it says in second corinthians chapter four verses eight to nine and i had spent all week on a beautiful slide show you should have seen it it says second corinthians chapter four verses eight to nine if you could turn in your bibles to look at this or open your app hey siri open the bible to second corinthians chapter four verses 8 and 9. it says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed it's very familiar scripture to us we've heard it ministered on in very deep ways and relevant profound ways and very gifted men of god have used this to encourage and strengthen our faith so i'm just stirring up your pure minds by way of remembrance to look back at this scripture where we stand today and realize that what paul is saying this he's not qualifying it he's not saying to some they they're perplexed and to others they're this and to others they're that he's saying we are and as we often put ourselves in the in the the shoes of the writer and we gather that he's not merely making a statement of how that we are on our way uh to rome or we are on our way to cyprus but he's saying that this is a characterization of us as christians we are troubled we are perplexed we are persecuted we are cast down in other words god allows trouble god allows perplexing god allows persecution and casting down and that there is no reproach in these things that when we find ourselves cast down or troubled it says troubled on every side and we find ourselves uh persecuted there is a there is a a way that there's a stigma that would try to be attached to us and a scarlet letter that we would wear when we're troubled or persecuted uh or perplexed or cast down but listen when paul writes it this way he's taken away and removing any stigma or reproach associated when a child of god is troubled he said well i'm troubled on my right side well i'm troubled on every side and there's still no reproach in it now i want you to look at this and i know that you've done this before but i want to remind you that when we look at this and he says we are troubled we are perplexed we are persecuted we are cast down there's this this is what god allows now i want you to look at this this the next part to it when he says yet not but not but not but not that that's satan's desire one is what god allows the other side is what satan desires he desires the distress the despair the feeling forsaken the believing that we are destroyed out so then catch this satan's objective is not to trouble you on every side that's what god allows satan's objective is to not it is not to perplex you that's what god allows satan's objective is not to persecute you that's what god allows his objective is not to cast you down that's what god allows but what satan would want to do is to take those things that god has allowed and to manipulate them in such a way and make them so large in your mind and cause you to forget the promise and to forget your faith in the promise of god it's not that abraham all of a sudden stop believing but in the moment he forgot about the promise in the crisis and the gravity of the situation that he's facing if he could have taken a step back and said now god's allowed me to be troubled god's allowed this famine god's allowed this circumstance god's allowed me to be persecuted and then said that which god has allowed i can accept but what is satan trying to do in this moment trying to cast my faith down he's trying to cause me not just merely to feel this way but to think that i am destroyed so satan's desire is to cause distress despair feeling forsaken believing that we are destroyed but the word of god says we are not right we can accept it the bible says i'm troubled the bible says and i'm perplexed the bible says i'm persecuted the bible says i'm cast down but notice how definitively paul expresses what we are he expresses in the same to the same intensity and emphasis what we are not and so no matter how much you may feel that you are forsaken or destroyed or despair or perplexed i want you to understand or not perfect despaired or forsaken or distressed or destroyed no matter how much you may feel we could say that we are not because paul says we are this but we are not that we are not distressed we are not disparity we are not forsaken we are not destroyed and in everything that abraham went through his life was full of trouble his life was full of situations that would seem to be distressing but in the end he was not deterred and we have to begin to relate to the faith of abraham that through everything he endured and went through in the in the journey and the path that he took that in the end hit the faith that he had was going to see him through he was going to move beyond it mature beyond it we're going to identify ourselves with it and the message three kinds of believers he says you have got something to do god's got something for you to do could we all accept that today every single one of us who are here no matter how long you've been serving the lord and no matter if it seems things have passed you by and opportunities or long gone or i had my i had my time in the in the service i had my time in the front line listen god still has something for you to do he says you may now if we could establish that that god has a purpose in your life then he says you may have some heartaches and some troubles you may have some disappointments and and and we can all say amen to that continued disappointments continued heartaches and things that resurface after many years in situations we find ourselves in like i'm back at this door again i'm in this trouble again yes these things take place he says but do we pray to shun them and we're all like yes yes yes we do that's exactly what we do and he says no i'm like oh right that's what i meant i misunderstood the question we we pray lord get me out of this keep me from it oh lord i don't want to have to go through this he says no this is the prayer lord take me through them whatever they is whatever it is don't let me escape them if they're set for me just give me grace to go through that that's all what a different approach because you realize that if god has set a a trial for you or god is going to allow you to be troubled gonna allow perplexing can allow persecution allow you to be cast down and this is what god is going to allow in his wisdom and as you come to it you see that it's coming and we begin to pray keep us from it and the devils are going yeah yeah ask him to keep you out of him because that's where he wants the distress to come that's where he wants the despair to come that's where he wants the i'm being forsaken god's thrusting in this trial this is where he wants us to believe that we're going to be destroyed by the thing that is coming but then when we put our shoulders back and say lord take me through it whatever it is if they're set for me give me the grace to go through that and this is this is the disposition of abraham ultimately lord whatever trial it is you've set before me give me the grace to go through it whatever mountaintop i have to ascend to whatever difficulty i'm faced with lord give me the grace to go through it now maybe i uh wrestled with the order of this and just exactly which order to take these different things but i felt to take this part which might seem to be oh you're taking a step back and that was kind of uh that was your your climax there if that was my climax that was part one i'm gonna start part two this is the evening service beginning now at 11 10 sunday morning so we can build to another climax brother branham teaches about two climaxes so this wouldn't be difficult for us to do this this morning but i wanted to establish that the principle that if you could trust god and his love towards you and you can have this comfort he's got something for you to do that will change change the way in which we approach difficulty in hard times and situations that are very grievous or sorrow even as we think of the moralist family something that's unexplainable how do we explain this how do we make sense of this that there's a trust in god that lord give me a grace to get through this may there be a grace on sister melissa may there be a grace on the mother of james and may there be a grace in the church and in the family to be able to navigate through this have the right things to say the right way to minister and and so with that as a kind of within the focal point of abraham's faith and his conviction and how he suffered these different situations in his life but in the end we find him on mount moriah willing to offer up his son because he fully trusts the lord he's fully persuaded now but when we think of that as it says in romans chapter 4 verse 21 and being fully persuaded it says that he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what god had promised he is able to perform being fully persuaded that what he god had promised god was able also to perform being fully persuaded that what god had promised to him abraham also was able to bring the past the promise that was given to him but even though the bible memorializes abraham's faith in that manner being fully persuaded abraham didn't always know the full plan of god in order to completely trust him he didn't know the full plan of god in order to completely incorrectly trust the plan of god because being fully persuaded does not imply full perfect understanding it says he's fully persuaded so in other words god can say i promise to do this and he's fully persuaded that god's going to do it but he doesn't yet understand perfectly how god's going to do it so it becomes somewhat of a wrestling within himself i'm fully persuaded god that you're going to do it but i don't know exactly how you're going to do it so he's always trying to figure out how maybe abraham knew that he was going to have an heir but the tension is created around who is the air going to be because it says in genesis chapter 15 verses 2 and 3 after the lord appears to him in a vision after these things after melchizedek serves in communion genesis 15 the lord appears to him in a vision fear not i am thy exceeding great reward thy shield i buckle exceed my your protector your cover your provider and abraham's response is lord god what will thou give me see and i go childless in other words it kind of seems to be somewhat of a disputing a a remark back to god don't be afraid abraham well what what can you do for me saying that i don't have a kid what good is all these things you can give me and all these blessings you can pour out upon me if i don't have an heir and he says and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus because he had traveled there into syria and was in that that area in that region and had uh obtained the servant in his house eliezer and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed so this is him he's being very upfront and honest look you've made this promise to me and in making this promise to me you've told me that i would have these this particular uh things that would be granted to me and i would have these promises that are mine he says but i don't have a child but i have one in my house is eliza damascus and lo one born in my house is mine heir you notice what he's just told god i don't have a son but eliezer does and being born in my house he is my possession he's one of my servants and he's part of my household and he would be one that would be identified with my stewardship and he's saying what about his son this is abraham in genesis chapter 15 fully persuaded that he was going to have an heir but there's tension around who the air is going to be and he's offering up the son of one of the stewards now we read this month oh no no abraham you don't understand no no no you don't understand it's going to be your son but this hasn't been fully developed in abraham's understanding yet then in genesis 16 verse 2 and sarah said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain child children by her so now sarah saying i can't have a kid and to that point there are some commentators that speculate that maybe she was trying to test abram so that the blame could be on him too and and i don't i can't but maybe i can obtain children by my own servant so now it's not just the son of eleazar but it's going to be the son of abraham but it's going to be through a servant of sarah's and it says abram hearken to the voice of sarah in other words he'll obey to her because he doesn't fully understand that the promise is through sarah alone so he says that's i hadn't thought about that why don't we do obtain children through your servant and sarah kind of gives it her stamp of approval and then we've read the story immediately it doesn't work out well for abraham right it causes this distress apparently now it's confirmed that abraham can bring four children she shoulders the blame uh on herself and there's this conflict and this torment within her spirit and it causes strife within the family again strife within the marriage abraham's having to deal with this why because he hearkened to the voice of his wife unsure of who the heir would be but yet still fully persuaded now we're not arguing with the scripture when it says he's staggered not at the promise through unbelief but in some ways he's trying to find just exactly where that solid footing is in genesis 15 could it be eliezer's son now in genesis 16 could it be the son of hagar then we get into genesis chapter 17 this to me verses 15 to 18. it is so remarkable this exchange and god said unto abraham god's speaking now okay in my notes i actually took what god says here and put it in red letter as for sarah thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall be her name and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of her now now in doing this god has taken what he expressed to abraham and he's unfolded the same if we could put it this way there's this promise given to abraham and and let's just say maybe a promise given this is the promise to abraham god doesn't change the promise he opens it up more deeply it says when i gave you the promise that you were going to have a son when i first spoke it that son was going to be through sarah when i said you were going to be a blessing and be a father of nations i was saying sarah would be a mother of nations when i said kings would come from you i was saying they were going to come from sarah so he's just turned the same promise around to where abraham's not changing his faith he's not saying oh well that's not the promise you made to me before god is unfolding that promise remember he said leave thy father's house and thy kindred in thy country just get out i'll show you the land later and then he journeyed into the land and god said this is the land i was talking about god wasn't saying i got to figure out a place to place abraham just wherever he goes wherever he ends up and we'll have to figure it out send angels out to find where he's going get ahead of him figure out where he's going oh god knew all along and then when he got to a particular place he says now i can show you now i can show you the promise so that in his journey this was very critical when we looked at this before so that when he got there it's faith that got him there and not the postcard or the pictures before abram didn't show up because there was this really really good photographer in kanan who used forced perspective and just the right kind of light and had all the best filters but yeah that's i want to go there who doesn't want to live in canaan it's gorgeous out there they've got these these cave walls with these nice angel wings that you can stand in front of and and do the duck face and post it and get a lot of followers there was nothing visual about it was all faith there was no there was no drama there was no filter there was nothing that drew it was all faith and god withheld it so when abraham arrived it's faith that got me here but then the revelation begins to dawn and the details begin to get filled in and then it begin to anchor in him the promises of god so now god has opened up the promise further to abraham listen you're going to be a father of many nations you've proven that you had some persuasion of that because you offered up your elie's your son as one in your own house and you've offered up the sun you've had the sun by your servant and he's trying to show him more specifically and plainly who this heir was going to be and you all know what he says next right verse 17 then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart anybody want to guess what he said shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old we know sarah gets all the the the flack for laughing in genesis 18. she's just doing what her husband said i think his brother uh brother jewel foreigner brother burley williams was talking about in marital strife and and your wife and her demeanor and her nature and he basically said behold your creation to us husbands right we've made her this way whatever we sow into her we get that out of her right and so here abraham we we give sarah a lot of grief in genesis chapter 18 uh uh for laughing abraham did it first in the face of god shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall sarah that is 90 years old bear and he says based upon this and didn't the bible say that he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief and considered not the deadness of his own body or the deadness of sarah's woman i mean that's what the bible says right i'm not just using you know the message search program and trying to find all the places where brother branham contradicted himself i'm just reading the bible and that it says and he says here and i'm not implying there's a lot of places where he does but i'm just referring to the critics who try to make things compete and work against themselves but he says he's saying shall this happen to me whose body is dead and to her whose womb is dead and in verse 18 and abraham said unto god oh that ishmael might live before thee think about this exchange god this is this is genesis chapter 17. he has spoken to him when he was in ur he has spoken to him when he was in iran he he built an altar to him in genesis chapter 12 god defended him when he lied to pharaoh and rescued him he has made himself known to him and allowing him to rescue his brother his nephew lot he has he's expressed himself manifest himself as melchizedek he's appeared to him in a vision as his cover and his defender and and he's changed his name and he's going through all these things he's changed sarah's name and he's fully expressed the promise abram you are now abraham because you're not just going to be a father of a son but you're going to be the father of many nations and sarah is going to be sarah because she's also going to be a mother of many nations this is who the promise is through and abraham's instinctive response is oh let ishmael be the one i'm this this reads in your bible right i mean it's the same one do i need somebody else to give me another translation instead of hey siri let's say okay google all right let's open up genesis chapter chapter 17. so we could read this together to realize he still is offering up this isn't this isn't because of the lack of faith he's fully persuaded that god is able to keep the promise but there's tension about who the heir is going to be he's not he's uncertain he's uncertain who this one who is going to be the one to fulfill the promise and not through unbelief but through a lack of understanding he said oh but could it be ishmael could it please be ishmael that would live before thee and if you look at abraham's journey it's one of increasing tension between god's promise to him and all the things that threaten it it kind of follows a literary technique of the maybe the hero's journey might be one that you could look at he's called out has this crisis has this moment of epiphany so there's maybe some literary techniques that you could use to identify and understand the story of abraham's journey but there's this obstacle that's always in his way god makes a promise but your wife is barren god makes a promise but there's a famine in the land god makes a promise but pharaoh's trying to take your wife god makes a promise but this is happening and that's happening and there's always this tension between the promise of god and all the things that threaten and there's always this question okay we accept the fact that god said i'm going to have an heir but who's it going to be anyways and one one final thought that i want to i want to use just to kind of look at this uh process and this journey of faith will bear these things in mind about abraham suffering these disappointments and discouragements and being cast down and all these different things that he went through and then now if this specific uh uh channel of this difficulty that he he faces in that trying to not fully understand the plan of god though he's fully persuaded of it not fully understanding the plan of god i want just to look maybe we could do it very quickly but abraham was always on the move the bible tells us that he was always seeking and always searching for something and if you look at his life it kind of seems unstable because he travels and he has these several years of travel and he finally gets to a place and god said this is the land i told you that i was going to give to thee but yet he's still nomadic he's still a wonderer he still travels from place to place notice what it says in genesis chapter 11 verse 31 and terror which took abram his son in lot the son of on his son's son and sarah his daughter-in-law his son abram's wife and they went forth with them from ur the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came unto heran and dwelt there this is the first step in this process in abraham's journey and so he moved once there are people here who've moved several times you know how the devil tries to create a stigma you know oh well you how many churches have you been to and how many times have you moved all right i got the father of my faith okay and so you want to argue with me about moves and and and there's some that would try to make it a reproach that we as a church are meeting in different tents all over the valley but uh but that was exactly what moab had to say about israel right criticized her oh she didn't even have a home church brother member even says that didn't even have a home church as it was and that was a criticism of the children of israel but you know we're in exodus we're in a rapture and if this thing's going to be wrapped up real soon then we would have had this duplicate expression within our journey even as a church that we existed from one place of fellowship and one house and one tent the tabernacle was always in motion as we went to that time of translation and crossing the jordan into that promised land and that meeting in the air but that's always a source of criticism moving moving moving roving roaming roaming there's one move from urban the counties to go into the land of canaan and they don't quite get to the land of canaan it says in genesis chapter 12 verses 5 and 6 and abram took sarah his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in iran and they went both to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came and abram passed through the land and to the place of shechem so he comes into the land of canaan and he doesn't settle down he still keeps going but notice this place shechem under the plain of mora and the canaanite was then in the land if you look kind of like a map in the journey of abraham from where he began in irv the caudis and it would have been a very beautiful city and he would have been traveling along the euphrates river and along a established trade route it's very remarkable when you dig into the life of abraham how there's many uh archaeologists and scholars who say that in his travel uh from the euphrates and following along to where he entered into canada he would have passed dozens over 30 different altars built to false gods and these would have been constant reminders to him of all these false deities and these false gods and from earth to her end he would have traveled about 700 miles and then another 700 miles to syria where he would have been entered into begin to enter into what we would call canaan and he would have come through syria maybe dwelt around damascus for some time and then he begins to travel through canaan because it says he passed through the land into the place of shechem so 700 miles another 700 miles in genesis chapter 12 verses 8 to 10 and he removed from fence unto a mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel in the west and haye on the east and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name of the lord he invoked the name of jehovah and abram journeyed going on still towards the south i'm already losing count because it doesn't tell us how many times he unpacked the boxes or packed them back up how many tents he set up how many days he spent there how many days he spent there i remember as we were traveling quite a bit as a family through a few years and then in 2019 we were gone for six whole months and uh and then we moved to north carolina and we're in north carolina uh for a few months and jack came to me i think was in early january and he said dad are you done preaching in north carolina yet i think he i think he just thought that we finally decided just to bring all our stuff with us when i go out and preach and we just take in his bed and put it in this room and he felt unsettled there's even a point where he said mom you remember the white house and we're like when we toured the white house in d.c and he's like no the white house in texas he was referring to our house in texas and it was usually in terms of do you remember and this isn't after we moved this is why we still live there because that's just how much we are muslim now when we count our moves we have to count the month we spent in cays or north carolina the month we spent in in lake leland michigan and the month we spit this we've moved dozens of times take heart my friends and here he is traveling yet again it says in genesis 12 18 and removed from fence unto a mountain on the east of bethel now he's moved to the east of bethel then verse 9 and abraham journeyed going on still towards the south he leaves irv the chaldees he moves along the recipes river and as he moves along this river he starts coming down to what would be modern-day syria he's entering into canaan land but he doesn't stop once he's there and god says see this land this is land i told i was going to give you and then he keeps going that's as you journey towards the south verse 10 and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt a soldier in there for the famine was grievous in the land he goes another 800 miles into egypt this is the this is the father of your faith this is his journey then in genesis chapter 13 verse 1 and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had in lot with him into the south now he's going back and decaying going right back where he left then it says in verse 18 then abram removed just tint and came and dwelt in the plain of mammary which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord notice how his journey is taking place and travels into canaan builds an altar keeps going south goes into egypt comes back out builds another altar he's traveling and he's always moving always on the go genesis chapter 20 verse 1 and abraham journeyed from fence towards the south country and dwelled betw between cadus and sher and sojourned in gerard moving once again it says in verse 34 of chapter 21 and abraham's soul journeyed in the philistines land many days but there was another move because in genesis 23 verse 2 it says sarah died in kurthara the same as hebron in the land of canaan and abraham came to the mount to mourn sarah and to weep for with her for her just trying to do so quickly with the number of scriptures just paint the picture that he begins he begins in er and he travels along these trade routes but then he starts headed south to go into the land of canaan and then he does go into the land of canaan and he comes in the land of promise but then he continues to the place of shechem and then he keeps journeying south and he comes to bethel and then he leaves bethlehem he comes down into egypt and then he comes back up and then he goes a little bit further and then he comes down over here and he comes back over here and abraham's moving all over the place and as he moves he's building these altars and it may seem like this long fruitless journey where abraham has these ups and downs and maybe he invites conflict and he struggles because he's done this and he went there and he went down in egypt and he created this problem and he went over here with with lot and created this struggle in this fight and he finds himself in this place and it puts his family in trouble and he has to go out and fight and you can look at abraham's journey from the moment he called them out of ur with these great big plans and promises right we dramatized it before how he's bragging as he leaves er be the father of many nations all right you know through me all the families of the earth can be blessed and 20 something years later he's still just a tent caravan his wife dies he has to buy a burial plot can you give me a possession i'm a stranger in this land he's saying this in genesis 23 3 i'm a stranger in this land i'm a soldier i have no plot i have no possession i want to buy a place to lay my wife's body you're like man here's a guy with a lot of boast a lot of brags and yet he's not this harambe he's not this nimrod he's not this one you're like oh my goodness this guy is so great he has such a great name he's a conqueror he's a king he's a he has a name and he commands authority he's having to buy a grave to bury his wife decades after the promise and it may seem very very frustrating maybe for those who believe in father abraham but think about how abraham must have felt but you always go back to the word of god to find the reason find the promise and in genesis chapter 13 verses 17 to 18 all right wake yourselves up this is the part that really really got me excited so if you've just been hanging on to this point you know take your luca energy shot uh put some lavender under your tongue or is it your big toe whichever works for you because we're on our home stretch now or maybe some peppermint on your temples rub it in a little bit you have a prayer line to anoint you with peppermint get rid of that headache kind of wake you up clear your sinuses a little bit i want to hear some amen sister julia this is your chance to get out of that special at the end and genesis chapter 13 verses 17 and 18 this is god speaking i put it in red letter in my notes arise walk through the land and the length of it and the breath of it for i'll give it unto thee you look at the travels of abraham from one perspective this guy just can't get a grip he doesn't know when to stop look what he's doing but yet he keeps moving he keeps traveling he keeps there's variances and archaeologists and people reading into the text say you know it was more than likely that he went here and did this and he went there and did that and he's doing some exploring he's doing some side hikes and he's doing all these side quests and all these other adventures and he's walking through it and it's god who said walk through the land listen abram didn't just show up to the message and say i believe it and i'm just going to sit down and wait until one day this body's changed he had a commandment this is your promise dig everything you can out of it walk in it learn it love it know it take it in your bosom and feed on it and he walked through the land he said walk the length of it walk the breath of it in other words walk all the way through it this is the commandment that abram was under walk through the land and the length of it and the breath of it for i will give it unto thee then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plane of memory which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord and you're thinking well why didn't you just read that verse first why do you read verse 17 before you read verse 18. you tricked us into thinking that abram is just this aimless wonder nomad running through the desert with no place to find but god had said get up and walk through it and by walking in it abraham was taking possession of it because even in the civil law at that time when you were going to take possession of something you walked it you wanted to identify the parcel of land that was going to be sold to you and that you were going to buy you walked it you measured it out you put footsteps on it because according to the civil law at the time you would have you would have demonstrated this is the land for dog lovers he's marking his territory right he's walking through and said this is mine i own it this is mine i own it this is mine i own it and he's walking through the land this walking was possession and it puts in context now this is where i'm wanting to turn the corner limit you've all have pulled so well this morning that i it's your fault that i'm getting a little bit long-winded but notice the promise now when it's given and not many of you laughed then so i apologize but the more it's better i'll keep going in deuteronomy 11 when god begins to speak to israel they're going back to the promised land we just think well god's saying go back in there and chase these people away there had already been a precedent and this is what i want you to catch the life of abraham what it demonstrates for us and what it how it blesses us god says in deuteronomy 11 24 every place where on the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the wilderness and lebanon from the river the river euphrates even under the uttermost sea shall your coast beam and when you look at the journey of abraham he went along the euphrates went along the coast went to the river went down into this place abraham had already walked the length of it and the breadth of it and so now when he talks to the children of israel and he says go in there and every place the souls of your feet shall tread from the wilderness if so shall your land be it shall be yours their father abraham to whom the promise was given had already marked it out for them and joshua in joshua 24 3 it says god speaking as they're there getting ready to cross over in genesis 24. he says get ready to take possession and take full possession he says i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood and led him throughout all the land of canaan who led him in canaan who had led him he here led him there and let him what's the most important thing that's the leading and he says i let him throughout all the land of canaan meanwhile his extended family kind of grabbed the popcorn where is he moving this time i wonder how active that whatsapp group was where are you going this time abraham and yet it's god that led him throughout all canaan and multiplied his seed and gave him isaac you know god had a purpose in him being quote unquote aimless god had a purpose in this frustrating journey and if abraham ever had developed a sense of frustration all he had to go back to is walk through the land the length of it and the breadth of it god himself gives us this understanding that i'm the one that took abraham and led him throughout all the land of canaan i'm the one that took him on the other side of that and he's the one that crossed over i'm the one that made him a hebrew and when abraham crossed over he says i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood and let him throughout all the land of canaan joshua's standing there in this spot in this particular place as he gives this commandment and in genesis chapter 12 abraham's first stop once he crossed the flood the river was at shechem and there he built an altar what i read about in genesis chapter 12. 500 years later joshua stands in the exact spot he says in verse 1 of joshua 24 and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel to shechem and call for the elders of israel for and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before god and joshua said unto all people thus saith the lord god of israel your father's dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time even tara the father of abraham and the father of nicor and they served other gods and i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood and led them throughout all the land of canaan and multiplied his seed and gave him isaac and now joshua is saying this as he stands exactly where abraham stood as he stood in shechem in the very place that abraham had already built an altar it was a ground that abraham had already consecrated a ground that abraham had already possessed so joshua wasn't just guessing he wasn't just saying all this looks good but he was standing in a place that had been bought he stood at a place that had purchased he stood in a place had been consecrated where his father had stood before and built an altar it was not aimless it was not baseless it was not blind trust but he had precedent can we relate to the faith of the royal seed of abraham to know that the seed of abraham jesus christ has already stood on this ground and has asked us to take it with him not very far from that place abraham's grandson jacob dug a well not too far from here and then 1500 years later john chapter 4 says jesus had needs to go by samaria and he came to a city which is called saikar shashem comes to the same city near a parcel of ground that jacob gave his son joseph jacob the grant the son of isaac the son of abraham given to his son joe look at this chain of command and jacob's well was there it's about the sixth hour of the day he comes to the well and the woman of samaria is there and he says give me a drink what becomes the focal point our fathers dug this well and it's all going back to abraham why because abraham visited that spot and abraham had claimed that ground and it was abraham's possession that was given to isaac that was given to jacob that was given to joseph and there was a well built there and it becomes the very canvas the very context the very parameters within which all the promises of god are going to unfold and abraham traveled that land as if it was required that he touched every inch of it to possess it think about just looking at this frustrating journey of abraham but i want you to realize that god through all of it had a purpose abraham visited every single land that bordered canaan he was in egypt gaza lebanon syria they say today that there's no place an israelite can go within the promised land where he didn't go there was nowhere to live in the promised land where he didn't already live there was no place to fight where he had not already fought no war to win that he hadn't already won this is the legend of abraham's faith this is the outcome of his journey why you went there why you went there but in every place that abraham journeyed he placed footsteps of possession and he built altars to the lord the countries he soldiered in the places the sojourned in the places he worshipped in we took a map and we began to identify he came here that he entered down he traveled this way if you look at his life in total the places he visited are later possessed by or visited by his descendants jacob at bethel joseph and egypt joshua shashem samson and philistia boaz and jordan samuel shiloh david on moriah solomon in jerusalem jesus at shechem paul at damascus think about all these prominent places where the you have these uh remarkable events in the seat of abraham taking place and abraham's already wearing the shirt been there he's already got the but his his water bottle always has a sticker from the visitor center on it and here's samuel and shiloh and and abraham's over there looking at his shiloh sticker yeah i remember that hike that was a good one right they don't that he's been there he's walked it all these places abraham had already visited sacrificed worshipped possessed and what i want you to think about right now and if you could just somehow begin to think now that as the pattern was laid down in the father abraham of the natural seed jesus christ the seed of abraham has already possessed certain promises for you by his stripes you are healed he has already suffered the rejection he has suffered the sorrow he has suffered the grief and as it were that david could be at jerusalem solomon jerusalem jesus that's shechem paul of damascus samuel shiloh boaz and jordan and joseph and egypt and all these places it's almost as if abraham had already consecrated them had already claimed all these places for all of them he had already done it so that when they were there samuel can say my father abraham was here when joshua was there my father abraham was here no matter where paul went he could say my father was here even in what seemed to be his wonderings in his frustrations and his sorrows god was in control god was using him as a forerunner as a father of our faith who has to experience certain things so that once he's experienced it he could radiate back to those of us who find ourselves in the same place he's saying that where you are today sister i've already consecrated that ground that where you are today brother i've already built an altar there this is hallowed ground god's already met me there there's no place where we ought to despair but jesus christ has already made it a place consecrated forever for you god was in control in the message victory day this will just try to sum it all up to you he says god lets disappointments happen to show victory abraham's disappointments were just progress towards victory get up and go wasn't that he lost that ground there was another ground he had to consecrate it wasn't that all that altar wasn't good enough there was another altar he had to build oh if we can only see that god let's disappointments happen to show victory oh if we can only see that you'd only see that these things that seem to be so burring you and upsetting you they are trials they are things to stand still and focus your glasses on the word of god the things that seem to be burning us and bothering us so much and upset us and getting us to talk and and worry and express frustration and disappointments and fear he said if no they're there so that you can take your glasses your binoculars your scope and take it off the negative and put it on the promise if all we did was zero in on and abraham moved and abraham moved and oh my goodness look at this character and abraham moved and have you seen their linkedin profile i've never seen so many cities lived in in my life can you believe this guy and then just take her glasses off of his google timeline and just zero right in on the verse 17 oh god said walk through the land and the length of it in the breath of it oh god says right here i took abraham from the other side of the flood and led him throughout all the land of canaan well then never mind maybe i shouldn't be so critical of abraham it was god that was doing it he said oh just focus your glasses on the word of god and speak the word and then just walk forward that's all there is to do it the time we say god i don't know what to do i'm up against it speak the word lord i believe and just start walking forward god does the opening of the sea you just keep walking that gives us courage that if abraham suffered these disappointments and these discouragements and he seemed to be this itinerant farmer and this wonder and this nomad this merchant that's just following these trade routes and seeking opportunities and and having to pack up and and move and to go all these different places and finds himself in strife and these different chapters and these different crises then we can look at the example of abraham and there he built an altar and there he worshipped the lord then we too as the royal seed of abraham can just praise them when we come into trouble praise them when we come into these situations praise them when we find ourselves in these circumstances because we are troubled we are perplexed we are persecuted we are cast down but we are not distressed we are not in despair we are not forsaken we are not destroyed so that i can praise him in this trouble let me encourage you this morning that you can build an altar right there in your sorrow you can build an altar right there in your distress it's father abraham built an altar he's like this ground has been purchased by my lord this sorrow has been claimed by my lord and right here i'm building an altar to worship we could do as abraham did possess that ground for your children consecrate that ground for future generations right now in your sorrow right now in your difficulty right now in your stress and your tribulation right now and whatever you're going through i'm going to consecrate this ground because one day my son's going to find himself at this same altar one day my son's going to find himself in the same place one day they're going to visit shiloh one day and they'll be back at shechem one day they'll find themselves in egypt one day they're going to be in damascus but i've already been there and i've prayed and i've consecrated and i've declared that this is my possession and it is theirs also that's the promise of god you could right now you could just build an altar say i'm consecrating this ground i'm claiming this ground because one day my child is going to come to this but mike if you could come there's other musicians you're welcome to play i took your father abraham out of her of the chaldees i'm the reason why he traveled all the land of canaan why because footsteps were possession and as he walked it he claimed it and as he walked it he offered up sacrifices and he built altars in every place he visited later on you find these descendants of abraham back in the same place they were already purchased it was ground that already been conquered it was a place where there had already been a victory why because god let disappointments come to show victory and the message i know brother branson said neither could death and old age take abraham until the purpose of god had been finished he says neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of god of our life is finished we've heard this a number of times right now if we could relate to abraham all things work together for the good right to them that love god or be called according to his purpose the tension isn't around that he's gonna make it work for good the tension around his what's in all things right that's where the tension is sometimes because we don't know what all things i'm gonna have to suffer we don't know all the ingredients that's working into this thing to come out good and so while we're in kind of the mix and we're in the process of things unfolding we can act just like abraham and we're like well uh what what what is the good that's gonna come out of this why is this happening but there's a place that we could come to to realize that god is in control and then we look at the example of abraham how that through his wonderings and his movements he was laying this pattern in these footsteps that his seed would one day follow and i said oh god always had it in control we can trust god the same way and not even have to do it the way abraham did because he was the forerunner we don't even have to do it in the same way that brother branham did we've already been afforded an example i was thinking of it this morning my my dad's birthday is this coming and and i was just thinking this morning of how i had the benefit of being raised in a home where parents who had already accepted the message and so there's this progress there's this process that that i'm a beneficiary of now just amplify that by brazilian and you'll realize that you have the benefit today of all history and all accumulation of all faith of all believers through all ages all prophets all sages here we stand today with so many different clouds of witnesses can we not have confidence and the god that has called us just as abraham did being the first one if not more neither can it take you or take me until the purpose of god of our life is finished so we gather from their consolation and he says and why does god let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth he doesn't just say this about death he says it about trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god we thought trouble was just driving abraham all over canaan god had put bits in trouble's mouth and with every move and every uprooting and every progress and everything it was just bringing him into closer fellowship with god can you trust him today can you just yield to his process accept the plan that he has for you could we stand together [Music] jesus christ has already gone before us and purchased every every possession and every promise you have every right as abraham did every right as abraham seed did to worship and to claim those promises today with our heads bound [Music] with our heads bowed if you need the lord to touch you could you take him at his word today just accept him [Music] you need to lift your hands to him so god i'm lifting up my hands as abraham did in those plains and those valleys on those hills on a mount moriah at an altar surrounded by philistines lord i'm lifting up my hands to you wherever i may be in my situation whatever i may be in my heartache or my struggle lord i can find that i can worship you on a ground that's been consecrated by your blood at an altar that has been opened up to me as your son or daughter a gracious heavenly father [Music] lord as we stand in your presence today we each want to have a different path in a different journey that has brought us to this house of worship [Music] and regardless of the path that we have gone we relate to abraham's wandering [Music] we relate to his uprootings we relate to how unsettled he might be might have been lord i believe that what we need today is a reminder of the promise abraham never stopped believing it was just times where he forgot and lord we can never stop believing there's just times that we forget and may we be reminded today lord of these great promises you have made towards us may we be reminded of the promise of comfort the promise of peace the promise of blessing the promise of our children the promise of salvation the promise of healing promise of comfort lord the fruits of the spirit the deep settled peace that we can benefit from that's within our souls lord whatever the struggle may be whatever the land that needs to be possessed maybe today lord we need to go on a walk we need to follow you we've got to hunker down and we've dug in our hills and we've tried to claim the ground that we're presently standing on but you want us to walk [Music] because that's not the place you're gonna bless us we've got more footsteps to make on these promises and lord we've kind of cabbage down we've hunkered down but lord lose us now lord may we unburden ourselves and walk through these great promises been sitting on our hands sitting back for too long folders shoulders hands crossed hands on our hips lord just waiting and you're saying no walk in these promises walk in these promises may we today go forward may we no longer be sitting still and lord may we not fear what man can do to us may we not fear what the future may hold but when we have a boldness knowing that you have already forever consecrated this way you have already built the altar you have already offered the sacrifice you have already shed your blood you have already manifested your presence so that there's no place we can go where you are not there no place we can travel where you have not been no place we can live where you have not lived no battle we can fight that you have not already won [Music] father may we gain some consolation today as we look back at our lives and our ups and downs and our in and outs and church experience and moving here and doing this and oh how the voice of the devil sometimes wants to get us to think that changing churches is the mark of the beast lord we've only followed your leadership and you led abraham from altar to altar place to place and at the end of the day what was most important is that you were leading so lord i say to the believers here of arizona believers church those of the mesa church may there not be lost hope may there be a renewed courage and strength to believe that you're mindful that you will provide and we thank you for your presence with us today i pray that you be with sister melissa she grieves and her family her daughter the loss of this baby grandbaby great grandbaby lord jamison may you have mercy upon them to the morales family the the aunt's lord and the hurt that they may feel the great ants lord the extended family may you give comfort to them lord we're rejoicing today in the wonderful work that you did in the demars family may you increase brother jason's strength and his witness in his ministry for us who are seeking your will may you give guidance and leadership lord as as my son's going to a youth camp this week may you give him lord and experience with you may you come upon the scene for him lord as i found myself at an altar of sacrifice to yield myself and surrender myself lord i believe that my seed too could come to that place of full surrender lord we're praising you and thanking you for your goodness may we right now father release all doubt lay it aside and accept your promises right now with a yea and amen and believe it and accept it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
