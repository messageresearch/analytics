[0:00] compliment everyone and make in the
[0:02] effort to be out to the house so Lord
[0:03] this evening I know midweek services are
[0:05] difficult to make especially with the
[0:07] schedules we have with work especially
[0:09] with how far away a lot of the families
[0:11] live and then just even the demands on
[0:14] our time at that midweek service is a
[0:16] difficult one so I just really
[0:17] compliment all of you who are here
[0:19] tonight and the ones that I look out
[0:21] upon you're consistently here and I just
[0:23] pray that you're finding a real benefit
[0:25] and blessing in your lives and in your
[0:26] families by making the effort to be here
[0:29] and may God bless you tremendously
[0:31] especially given the heat I have friends
[0:33] from all over the world sending me memes
[0:35] about the heat here in Arizona and so
[0:38] I'm frantically searching for memes to
[0:40] send back to them saving them for all
[0:42] the right moments and times but God
[0:43] bless you today for being here if it
[0:45] gets a little warm I trust the Lord the
[0:47] Lord above all can just give you a
[0:49] little bit of even physical comfort as
[0:50] we Minister the word this is part two on
[0:53] two Eden so we're coming to the second
[0:55] part on looking at two Edens and Sunday
[0:58] we spent a lot of time on this we're
[0:59] just going gonna pick up on it and the
[1:01] two Edens are God's Eden we looked at
[1:03] that as the original that God in the
[1:05] beginning created by the spoken word and
[1:08] then Satan's Eden that emerges even
[1:10] within God's Eden Satan is sowing the
[1:12] seeds and speaking the lies that will
[1:14] form his kingdom and brother Branham
[1:16] calls these two Edens perfect types and
[1:19] when he says that it's very remarkable
[1:21] because we might look at the beginning
[1:23] of the creation or when God begins to
[1:25] create and brings forth an Eden and a
[1:27] garden and all creation we think that is
[1:30] perfection of perfection but yet God was
[1:32] just given a type of it though it was
[1:35] perfect and it was very good it was a
[1:36] type and then Satan's Eden emerges and
[1:39] itself also is a type and brother
[1:42] Branham in that those statements that we
[1:44] read says that the Bible tells us that
[1:47] God's word produced in Eden but then it
[1:49] also warns us that a false Eden would
[1:51] come and he's using brother man points
[1:54] to Matthew chapter 24 verse 24 for there
[1:57] shall arise false Christ in false
[1:59] prophets and shall show great signs and
[2:02] wonders in so much that if it were
[2:04] possible they shall deceive the very
[2:08] elect and brother Branham and the way
[2:10] that he represent or speaks of these two
[2:12] Edens and talks about God's Eden and
[2:14] Satan's Eden and and refers to these two
[2:17] Edens that type so much he uses the
[2:19] scripture to point out that this is the
[2:21] false Eden that the Bible warns us of
[2:24] this is that these are the tares the
[2:26] representation of those Kingdom of tares
[2:28] that come into the world that were sown
[2:30] by the wicked one and it's remarkable
[2:33] that he says that and he says in
[2:35] different places how Satan has achieved
[2:37] it and what it produces is something so
[2:40] close to the original
[2:41] and that's what Satan does he's a
[2:43] deformer he's a mimicker he's an
[2:44] impersonator and that's why so often as
[2:48] you read the Bible and you hear
[2:49] different stories and different
[2:50] allegories that emerge in different
[2:52] historical circumstances and things that
[2:55] one man would do and what one man would
[2:57] believe in different ways that God would
[2:59] move you're always going to be be able
[3:01] to find something in ancient history
[3:03] that is a mimic of it that is an
[3:05] impersonation of it even things that
[3:07] they might say go before the historical
[3:09] record in the Bible That's because Satan
[3:12] from the beginning was trying to track
[3:13] God and trying to impersonate God even
[3:15] himself trying to stay one step ahead of
[3:17] God and so it emerges in the end as a
[3:21] twin to God's Revival
[3:24] and we know that in Genesis chapter 1
[3:26] verses 3 to 31 that God brings forth his
[3:29] Eden over six days and and those days in
[3:32] the Bible those division of time that
[3:34] 24-hour period but then the Bible
[3:36] teaches us that uh be not ignorant of
[3:38] this one thing as Peter says that one
[3:40] day is with the Lord as a thousand years
[3:43] and a thousand years is one day so it
[3:46] wasn't just six 24-hour periods that we
[3:48] might say but to God as he unfolded and
[3:51] created it took him six thousand years
[3:53] to bring forth his Eden his type his
[3:56] foreshadowing his first uh creation took
[3:59] six thousand years and just as it took
[4:01] God six thousand years to build his Eden
[4:03] Satan has taken six thousand years to
[4:05] build his brother Branham says in power
[4:07] of transformation six thousand years God
[4:09] took to make this and we see in Genesis
[4:12] 1 yet now we see that in this God had an
[4:16] objective that he wanted to bring to
[4:18] pass and we use that just to kind of lay
[4:20] back down again that when God created
[4:21] the heavens and the Earth he was had an
[4:23] ultimate an objective and ultimate
[4:25] purpose that Adam and the woman in type
[4:28] represented the threefold purpose of
[4:31] Christ or God manifested in Adam and the
[4:34] woman so it wasn't fully uh it wasn't
[4:37] the fullness of perfection but he was
[4:39] laying those seeds out there and so the
[4:41] original Eden we could say held all the
[4:43] all the types of God's Eternal Eden that
[4:46] would come it's like a preview or seed
[4:48] form of it and then Satan's kingdom as
[4:51] we're calling it Satan's Eden as brother
[4:52] Branham identifies it as Satan's Eden
[4:54] it's the kingdom that Lucifer intended
[4:56] from the beginning when iniquity was
[4:58] found in them this is what he intended
[5:00] to build and through the services on
[5:02] worldly Kingdoms in a lot of ways in
[5:04] these Services on Two Edens we're
[5:06] looking at how that Satan wanted to
[5:08] establish a kingdom and it's important
[5:10] because I believe it's those kingdoms
[5:12] that are going to be destroyed going to
[5:14] be annihilated going to be eradicated
[5:15] and there's one Kingdom that's going to
[5:17] remain that's the kingdom of God
[5:19] brother Branham says in Satan's Eden he
[5:21] says it's been and now is Satan
[5:24] establishing his kingdom in the earth
[5:26] that's exactly why he's doing it for he
[5:28] wants to establish his own kingdom and
[5:32] as we were reading from Revelations
[5:33] chapter 3 on Sunday I can't remember
[5:36] from the afternoon or not but in the
[5:38] morning service as we maybe came in just
[5:40] a past noon we're reading from
[5:41] Revelations chapter 3 verses 16 to 18 in
[5:44] the description of laodicea and how that
[5:46] God doesn't have one positive thing to
[5:48] say about it and the devil's bride is
[5:50] blind and naked and miserable and
[5:52] shameful and this is this is Satan's
[5:56] kingdom coming to its climax this is
[5:58] Satan perfecting his Eden it's him
[6:01] accomplishing really his own image what
[6:03] he wanted to achieve or if I could say
[6:06] this the only thing he could achieve is
[6:08] a perversion of God's original so
[6:10] laodicea in the description of laodicea
[6:12] is perfect opposite to God's image
[6:16] and Satan even trying to draw from
[6:18] certain things he he could only produce
[6:20] something that's a deformity uh that is
[6:22] the opposite of what God was going to
[6:24] achieve and so that's what Satan's Eden
[6:26] is it's a the antithesis it's the
[6:28] Antichrist it's the opposite of God's
[6:30] Eden because it is the seated
[6:32] discrepancy which is not just different
[6:34] but a contradiction
[6:37] and so if as we go further in this
[6:41] I wanted to stick with the title of two
[6:44] Edens but what I want to kind of focus
[6:46] on tonight is the two religions that
[6:47] come out of Eden
[6:49] and and I'll read from the church age
[6:51] book at the very end how brother Branham
[6:53] says that there are only two religions
[6:55] in the world True Religion and false
[6:58] religion
[6:58] and and that might seem remarkable in
[7:01] light of all the many different
[7:02] religions there are and even some
[7:04] religions that deny there is a God
[7:06] but it's important to note that even
[7:08] those religions are all part of the
[7:09] false religious system and that though
[7:12] some may worship Christ and some may
[7:14] worship the god that wrote the Bible and
[7:15] others may deny the god that wrote the
[7:17] Bible and believe in other gods and gods
[7:19] of the universe or even deny God uh
[7:23] their deny even eating deity those are
[7:25] all part of Satan's kingdom
[7:27] and they all worship the same thing they
[7:29] worship knowledge and Science and things
[7:31] that are false and so we as we look at
[7:33] the scripture and I think we'll just
[7:35] skip a little bit tonight some things
[7:37] but we know that both Abel and Cain
[7:39] offered Worship in Genesis chapter four
[7:41] they're both bringing offerings at one
[7:44] is accepted by God one is rejected by
[7:46] God God corrects the false worship and
[7:48] says your brother did well if you'll
[7:50] also do the same and and worship even in
[7:53] the manner which he did even supposing
[7:55] that he doesn't need the Revelation but
[7:57] if you'll just do what Abel did you'll
[7:59] also be accepted and so Abel with by
[8:02] Revelation by true Revelation he offers
[8:04] or sacrifices the firstborn from among
[8:07] the flock doing the same thing that God
[8:09] did in the garden by taking a life and
[8:11] and giving instructions to Adam and the
[8:13] woman to dress themselves and that those
[8:15] bleeding lambskins Abel offers the right
[8:18] way Cain doesn't
[8:20] we find that Cain in offering the wrong
[8:23] sacrifice that's the beginning of false
[8:25] worship
[8:27] brother random calls him twins he says
[8:29] they're they're Brothers in the same
[8:30] church they say they sat on the same Pew
[8:32] the different languages that he uses to
[8:34] describe it but one is worshiping
[8:35] falsely one is worth worshiping in truth
[8:39] in Genesis Chapter 4 verses 25 and 26 I
[8:43] want to take some time just to look at
[8:44] Adam's seed
[8:47] as the True Religion and the true
[8:49] worship of God as we'll contrast it with
[8:52] the seed of Cain it says and Adam knew
[8:56] his wife again and she bear a son and
[8:58] called his name Seth for God said she
[9:01] hath appointed me another seed instead
[9:04] of Abel whom Cain slew and to saith to
[9:09] him also there was born a son and he
[9:11] called his name Enos then began men to
[9:15] call upon the name of the Lord
[9:19] if we could look at verse 25 and see
[9:22] that she Bears a son and she said for
[9:26] God hath appointed me another seed
[9:28] instead of Abel
[9:30] it was her seed through Adam that she's
[9:33] identifying and her seed through Adam
[9:35] Abel was killed so she's saying that God
[9:39] has appointed me another seed another
[9:42] seed instead of Abel because Cain was
[9:45] different from Abel and she's she's
[9:49] using a language and she's saying
[9:50] something distinguish Abel from Cain God
[9:53] hath appointed me another seed because
[9:56] Cain is not the same seed as Adam was or
[9:59] as Abel was and so she does not say he
[10:03] has given me more seed given me another
[10:05] seed because she didn't have the seed
[10:08] anymore from Adam she had Cain who's of
[10:10] that Wicked one and she had a son by
[10:11] Adam who was killed by Cain so now she
[10:14] says I have that replacement I have
[10:15] another seed Seth who is different from
[10:18] Cain
[10:19] Seth being in this line and having a son
[10:22] Enoch so after Adam has had a son Seth
[10:24] and then he has a son Enos
[10:27] the Bible says that they then begin men
[10:30] to call upon the name of the Lord some
[10:33] render it to be and they called
[10:35] themselves by the name of the Lord
[10:38] oh it was they were identifying
[10:40] themselves with God they're identifying
[10:42] themselves with this one that might have
[10:44] seemed very mysterious to them but yet
[10:46] even by oral tradition Adam could have
[10:48] said that God created the heavens and
[10:50] the Earth and we walked with him and
[10:52] though my channels may be getting cloudy
[10:54] and fog I know that he made a promise to
[10:56] us and I could tell you what it was like
[10:58] Beyond those flaming cherubims I could
[10:59] tell you that there's a place right here
[11:01] on Earth where the presence of God would
[11:03] come down and we sinned in the beginning
[11:05] and God thrust us out but he gave us a
[11:07] promise that a son would come and he
[11:09] would share these things with his
[11:10] progeny his children after them and the
[11:12] Bible says that they called themselves
[11:14] the sons of God
[11:16] and they began the the sons of Adam as
[11:19] we contrast this with cane seed they're
[11:21] not running from the presence of God
[11:23] they're seeking it
[11:24] they're worshiping God they're calling
[11:26] upon the name of the lord they're
[11:28] connected to the promise they know that
[11:30] there's something Divine Beyond
[11:31] themselves they know there's something
[11:33] Supernatural so after the fall we could
[11:35] begin to see between cane seed and the
[11:39] seed of Seth that while on Earth despite
[11:41] the fall that you could either seek
[11:43] God's presence or disregard it you could
[11:46] either seek it or run away from it and
[11:48] disregard it and this is what they were
[11:50] doing the sons of Adam or the sons of
[11:52] God sought God together now men begin to
[11:56] call upon the name of the Lord and seek
[11:58] him together
[11:59] and in Genesis chapter 5 we'll see in
[12:01] verse 1 it says this is the book of the
[12:04] generations of Adam in the day that God
[12:07] created man in the likeness of God made
[12:10] he him
[12:11] raises up it reminds us that Adam's
[12:14] nature in the beginning came from God
[12:17] and that as he was made in the image of
[12:20] God there's an image of God in Adam even
[12:22] though this holy image would have left
[12:24] him and some Glory was lost to him he's
[12:27] still in his natural makeup had been
[12:29] made direct from God a spoken word Son
[12:31] of God created then the body formed from
[12:34] the earth and brought forth and so the
[12:36] Bible is telling us that he's made in
[12:38] the likeness of God so that we recognize
[12:40] that Adam's nature that he had from God
[12:43] is passing down to his sons
[12:45] passing down to the seed after them in
[12:47] verse 3 it says and Adam lived 130 years
[12:50] and begat a son in his own likeness
[12:52] after his image and called his name Seth
[12:56] as Adam was made in the image and
[12:58] likeness of God now the image of the
[13:00] Holy image of God remains in him it
[13:03] remains in Adam and now he has a son
[13:05] that comes forth in his own likeness and
[13:07] his own image
[13:09] Seth would then be in the nature
[13:11] I have the nature of Adam and the woman
[13:13] distinct from I know this is even review
[13:16] of the last few weeks distinct from the
[13:17] nature of the woman and the serpent it
[13:21] would have been maybe to use a phrase
[13:22] that might seem maybe a little bit
[13:24] misunderstood but a pure blood of Adam
[13:26] the woman in Adam's son together uh
[13:30] carried through
[13:31] and he would have had this he would have
[13:33] had the genes of Adam and the woman Seth
[13:35] in that image even as the children would
[13:37] come down he would bring forth children
[13:39] from his full sister to our theirs these
[13:41] are the seeds the sons of God the
[13:44] children of Adam
[13:45] and reading in Genesis chapter 5 we'll
[13:47] find we could find Seth's lineage as we
[13:50] keep reading and they're all humble
[13:52] people as you look at the meaning of
[13:54] their names their names are ones that
[13:56] glorify God there's no instances of
[13:58] murder or polygamy that are recorded of
[14:00] them there's no lying there's no
[14:02] deception as we get to the seventh
[14:03] generation of verse 24 it says Enoch
[14:05] walked with God and he was not for God
[14:07] took him
[14:08] I want to just draw from that very
[14:10] carefully even though we could drill
[14:11] down in each one of those verses there's
[14:13] something about the nature of Adam
[14:15] that's passed down to his children where
[14:17] they worshiped God they called
[14:18] themselves the Son of God they
[14:20] identified themselves as being uh
[14:22] passing down from this Holy One this
[14:24] even this mysterious one and the Mystery
[14:27] of God was precious to the sons of Seth
[14:29] it was precious to the those that
[14:31] descended from Adam and they they loved
[14:34] God and worshiped God and they were
[14:36] humble men and they were simple in their
[14:38] in their dwellings and simple and how
[14:40] they pursued life and yet as they are
[14:42] coming forth and being worshipers of God
[14:44] the mystery of God that was so revered
[14:47] by the sons of Adam is opposed by the
[14:50] sons of Cain
[14:52] you could compare the the generations of
[14:54] Adam the Seventh Generation from Adam
[14:56] being Enoch who walked with God how
[14:58] remarkable is that he walks with God and
[15:00] so pleases God that before
[15:02] God translates him because of how
[15:04] pleasing his desire for the things of
[15:07] God was and then you look at the Seventh
[15:08] Generation from The Serpent and you have
[15:10] a lameck who's a polygamist the first
[15:12] one recorded and he's a murderer
[15:14] confesses to his two wives I've murdered
[15:16] a man look at those distinct differences
[15:19] from in Genesis 5 the lineage of Adam
[15:21] and in the lineage of Cain
[15:23] very very different lineages
[15:26] and in Cain in Genesis Chapter 4 verses
[15:29] 16 and 17 it says and Cain went out from
[15:32] the presence of the Lord and dwelt in
[15:33] the Land of Nod on the East of Eden and
[15:37] Cain knew his wife and she conceived and
[15:39] bear Enoch
[15:40] and he builded a city and called the
[15:42] name of the city after the name of his
[15:44] son Enoch
[15:46] this is the beginning of Satan building
[15:48] maybe I'd want to say it this way the
[15:50] beginning of Satan building his natural
[15:52] Kingdom something you could look at and
[15:54] see you could touch it it's tangible and
[15:56] so he's building his kingdom on Earth
[15:58] the beginning of the natural Babylon
[16:00] these are the very seeds that's we're
[16:02] going to focus on tonight just very very
[16:04] briefly because I know you can only fan
[16:05] for so long before your wrists are going
[16:07] to be tired but there's this is a
[16:09] natural Babylon that's emerging and when
[16:11] we see a natural Babylon remember
[16:13] there's a spiritual one behind it
[16:15] just as Cain in the beginning offers up
[16:17] this worship that same Spirit of false
[16:20] religion Works in a spiritual way and
[16:22] he's building a spiritual Babylon even
[16:24] though historically we can look back and
[16:26] see natural Babylon that emerges on
[16:28] Earth As Natural kingdoms with natural
[16:29] rulers
[16:31] and in Genesis chapter 6 verses 1 and 2
[16:34] now we're skipping quite a bit Genesis 5
[16:37] was the lineage uh we see the lineage of
[16:39] Adam Genesis 4 is the worship of Abel
[16:43] and Cain and the uh Cain building a city
[16:46] and the appointed seat of Seth and then
[16:48] the lineage in chapter five and then the
[16:50] Bible comes to this description of
[16:53] humanity and it came to pass when men
[16:55] begin to multiply on the face of the
[16:57] Earth and daughters were born unto them
[16:59] that the sons of God saw the daughters
[17:02] of men that they were fair and they took
[17:05] them wives of all which they chose in
[17:08] this taken of these women there's
[17:10] there's an unrighteousness that is
[17:12] projected in that
[17:14] and the Bible is telling us that the
[17:16] sons of God through Adam's lineage these
[17:19] are the ones that begin to call upon the
[17:20] name of the Lord and call themselves the
[17:22] sons of God these sons of God through
[17:24] Adam begin to mix with the daughters of
[17:27] men
[17:28] and these Daughters of men they were
[17:30] they were not uh they were not from Seth
[17:33] lineage but there are some mixture some
[17:36] hydrating some cross relationships that
[17:38] were taking place as we could say the
[17:40] daughters of men are those Daughters of
[17:41] Cain and as there's Marrying an
[17:43] intermarian these men who called
[17:45] themselves the sons of God through the
[17:48] process of time they begin to mix with
[17:49] the daughters of men and in Genesis
[17:52] chapter 6 it tells us hey the sons of
[17:54] God saw the daughters of men that they
[17:56] were fair and they began to marry and
[17:58] Genesis 6 shows us just how quickly all
[18:01] of Humanity's degraded once they start
[18:03] intermarrying
[18:04] the effects of this the effects of that
[18:07] uh
[18:08] hybrid blood the effects of having that
[18:10] serpent nature sewn into them and the
[18:12] access that Satan could have to their
[18:14] imaginations in the influence that
[18:16] demonic Powers could begin to have upon
[18:18] the person and so the the sons of Adam
[18:20] begin to marry the daughters of Cain and
[18:24] it begins to corrupt wholesale corrupt
[18:26] human nature and the human race
[18:29] I know these are very uh
[18:32] um
[18:33] I think very profound teachings that are
[18:36] controversial to teach the original sin
[18:39] in the way that we believe it to teach
[18:41] the resulting effects of that in the way
[18:42] that we believe in a very controversial
[18:44] and so they're stigmatized and they're
[18:46] often attacked but as we read our Bibles
[18:50] it's right in our Bible it's right there
[18:52] in the Bible telling us this is what
[18:53] happened
[18:54] and eventually there comes a point and I
[18:56] know I'm just using some real summary
[18:57] language and I just haven't felt to get
[19:00] into this in great detail scripturally
[19:02] but there comes a point when only hybrid
[19:04] blood is left
[19:06] that there's there's not um the sons of
[19:09] God are calling upon the name of the
[19:10] Lord and sons of God worshiping God and
[19:12] living simply and Walking with God and
[19:14] in his presence there comes a point
[19:16] where all blood is marred all Humanity
[19:18] finds himself in this debased weakened
[19:20] condition
[19:21] and in Genesis chapter 6 verse 3 it says
[19:24] and the Lord said my spirit shall not
[19:25] always strive with man
[19:27] for that he also is flesh yet his day
[19:31] shall be a hundred and twenty years
[19:33] there's my spirit is not always going to
[19:36] be connected with man that his time is
[19:39] being limited it's being weakened his
[19:40] his days upon Earth are are getting
[19:43] smaller and smaller and my not my spirit
[19:46] they're not even be sensitive to my
[19:48] spirit anymore they're not going to
[19:49] regard me in their Consciousness anymore
[19:50] and and they're becoming completely
[19:53] Earthbound and debased it continues in
[19:55] verse four and there were giants in the
[19:57] earth in those days and also after that
[19:59] when the sons of God came in unto the
[20:01] daughters of men and they bear children
[20:03] to them the same became Mighty Men which
[20:06] are of old men of renown this is where
[20:08] you have the heroes upon the earth and
[20:10] the men of renown and reputation and
[20:13] trying to make a reputation for
[20:14] themselves this doesn't happen until the
[20:16] sons of God begin to marry the daughters
[20:18] of men
[20:19] and God saw this is how quickly when I'm
[20:22] mentioned a minute ago this is what I'm
[20:24] drawing from the Bible tells the sons of
[20:26] God begin to marry Daughters of men and
[20:28] just as soon as it tells you in verse 6
[20:30] it tells us verse 5 it tells us the
[20:32] condition and God saw that the
[20:34] wickedness of man was great in the Earth
[20:37] and that every imagination of the
[20:39] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[20:42] continually
[20:43] how different is this from Enoch
[20:45] the seventh from Adam how different this
[20:47] is from Seth and Enos and these ones
[20:50] that came came from this lineage of Adam
[20:52] to where they regarded God they thought
[20:54] of God they worshiped God they were
[20:56] sensitive to the things of God they
[20:57] called themselves sons of God
[21:00] that's what the Bible tells us they
[21:01] called themselves now the sons of God to
[21:03] the process of time and whether it be
[21:05] that what they felt was a natural need
[21:07] and the need to marry her enticed by
[21:10] these beautiful women they find
[21:12] themselves intermarrying and marrying
[21:13] these Daughters of men as they do the
[21:15] wickedness of man becomes great upon the
[21:17] Earth where he says every imagination of
[21:19] the thoughts of his heart were only evil
[21:21] continually and God says and it repented
[21:23] the Lord that he'd made man on the earth
[21:25] and it grieved him at his heart
[21:28] a condition of humanity what a condition
[21:29] of what we would call the human race is
[21:32] they've been mixed and mingled down and
[21:35] distilled down to where they're more
[21:37] Earthbound than they are heaven-bound
[21:39] and looking down to Natural things than
[21:40] they are looking up to God and seeking
[21:42] his presence
[21:44] yet in the midst of all this degrading
[21:46] of humanity the mongrelizing of the
[21:48] blood and the mixture of the seed Lion
[21:51] of Cain with the seed line from Seth the
[21:54] Bible says in Genesis 6 9 these are the
[21:56] generations of Noah Noah was a just man
[21:59] and perfect in his generations and Noah
[22:01] walked with God
[22:03] does God not say about Noah that in you
[22:06] only have I found righteousness and you
[22:08] and you alone and if you look at the the
[22:10] story of Noah he marries much later in
[22:13] life than his uh people before him as
[22:16] you look at the number of years it would
[22:18] take before a man would marry Noah Waits
[22:20] longer and longer and longer in life to
[22:21] marry and some speculate that he did
[22:24] because he couldn't find a suitable wife
[22:26] he couldn't find a daughter of Adam he
[22:29] couldn't find a woman to marry that
[22:31] could pass on the the the lineage of the
[22:33] sons of God but Noah remains upon Earth
[22:36] as a just meant perfect in all his ways
[22:38] and perfect before God and it's Genesis
[22:40] 71 he says Noah you alone for thee have
[22:44] I seen righteousness before me in this
[22:47] generation
[22:48] in Noah alone could you imagine what
[22:50] that looks like then Noah is the last
[22:53] son of Adam upon Earth
[22:56] and all humanity is intermarian and
[22:58] regarding not God and the imagination of
[23:00] his conscience is only evil continue and
[23:02] there's one man who's righteous in the
[23:04] middle of all that
[23:05] so God tells Noah in verse 13 The End of
[23:08] All Flesh has come unto me
[23:10] I was looking at that the end of All
[23:12] Flesh and he says my spirit shall not
[23:14] always strive with men for that he also
[23:16] is flesh and I was thinking about the
[23:19] flesh is we could use it to discuss or
[23:22] just to describe maybe the physical part
[23:24] and no doubt that without that
[23:27] manifestation we really wouldn't have
[23:28] much to articulate about or even look at
[23:31] and God uses the phrase flash first when
[23:34] he's going to separate out from Adam the
[23:36] woman and he says that I'm going to
[23:38] bring forth and they shall be one flesh
[23:41] this is what they're going to be it's
[23:42] used of Adam and the woman as one flesh
[23:44] and now he's saying this is the way that
[23:47] I was thinking about it today of how he
[23:50] says the end of All Flesh has come
[23:51] before me and it certainly projects that
[23:54] he's saying I'm going to destroy them
[23:56] all except for you Noah but in another
[23:58] sense that which he created in the
[24:01] beginning has come to its end
[24:03] there's no way for Noah to bring forth
[24:06] another son of Adam there's no way to
[24:08] bring forth another one that would be
[24:09] righteous he said this flash that
[24:11] existed in the beginning this and I
[24:13] don't like necessarily using the phrase
[24:15] pure blood but these genes from Adam are
[24:17] now ultimately going to be mixed and
[24:19] mingled with the daughters of men or the
[24:21] seed of Cain and so now the end of All
[24:24] Flesh has come before me he says I'm
[24:26] going to destroy them with the Earth
[24:29] we know that Noah and his sons are the
[24:31] ones that survived
[24:33] and if there's any kind of you're trying
[24:35] to figure this out of well who's related
[24:37] to who and figure out all these
[24:38] genealogies
[24:39] if there was a if we considered that
[24:42] there was a class of people that were
[24:44] between Cain and his half-sister and
[24:46] that that was a class of people that
[24:48] would have begun to form upon the face
[24:50] of the Earth and then this line begins
[24:52] to mix with Seth's line that's the line
[24:55] that begins to mix and that you see
[24:57] survive the ark
[24:59] is the mixed line and any any uh seed of
[25:03] Cain that would have been between you
[25:05] know him and his half-sister they're
[25:07] eradicated in the flood because only one
[25:09] man his wife and his three sons and
[25:11] their wives passed through the ark
[25:13] brother Batman the sermon serpent seat
[25:15] said how did the seed ever get over the
[25:18] seed come over in the ark just like it
[25:20] did in the beginning through the woman
[25:22] their wives They Carried the seed of
[25:25] Satan through the ark
[25:26] just as Eve packed the seed of Satan to
[25:28] give birth to Cain through the woman so
[25:31] this it is passed down through the wives
[25:34] it's through who they married and so
[25:35] Noah who's righteous it's through his
[25:38] sons that the whole earth is then
[25:40] repopulated and that is the hybrid blood
[25:44] from one blood are we all over spread
[25:46] over this whole earth and these these
[25:49] sons of Noah now are are of the of the
[25:53] mixed Humanity
[25:55] that proceeds out of Genesis chapter
[25:57] four
[25:59] and in Genesis chapter 10
[26:02] we're making just wonderful time tonight
[26:04] in Genesis chapter 10
[26:08] says now these are the generations of
[26:10] the sons of Noah
[26:12] Shem ham and japheth these are the sons
[26:16] of Noah these are the generations of
[26:18] Noah sham ham and japheth Genesis
[26:20] Genesis chapter 10 is going to give us
[26:23] the generations as you would read from
[26:24] each one of these of sham ham and
[26:26] japheth and unto them were Sons born
[26:29] After the flood
[26:31] so now after the flood and I guess just
[26:34] since I've been studying on these things
[26:35] for quite some time now in a lot of
[26:37] Mythology and a lot of other so-called
[26:39] religions they have their flood myth or
[26:41] their flood narrative and a flood that
[26:44] happened upon all the Earth and so if
[26:46] you're if you have a tendency to reject
[26:48] something just because there's something
[26:49] else from Antiquity that would oppose it
[26:52] well if you'd have to reject the Bible's
[26:54] truth about the flood based upon ancient
[26:56] text because there's other religions
[26:58] that have a flood story in their belief
[27:02] system and in their faith and so Noah
[27:04] has three sons sham ham and japheth the
[27:06] Bible says they are all born to they
[27:08] have children generations of them that
[27:10] are born After the flood
[27:12] look at verse 8 with me in Genesis
[27:14] chapter 10. looking specifically at cush
[27:18] says and Kush begat nimrod
[27:23] I'm going to back up physically and
[27:26] metaphorically for a second
[27:27] there if you could there's just a very
[27:30] small brief thought that I'm sharing
[27:31] with you tonight and I want us to be
[27:33] able to look at all in one picture so we
[27:35] could kind of carry it Forward it'd just
[27:36] be easy to go back to and I'm sure I'll
[27:39] get accused of saying a lot tonight and
[27:41] that that was a bunch and there was that
[27:42] was a lot and that was a lot there's a
[27:44] lot of scripture and I get it I'm
[27:45] getting better at learning how to say
[27:47] simple things in simple ways
[27:50] the the image that I'm wanting to put
[27:52] before you is this out of Eden there is
[27:55] a true religion
[27:57] that there that forms enable worshipings
[28:00] Abel is murdered by Cain this false
[28:02] worshiper God appoints another seed
[28:05] instead of Abel because it's not more
[28:07] seed because Cain is not the seed of the
[28:09] woman through Adam and then Seth's
[28:11] children begin to call upon the name of
[28:13] the Lord they begin to worship and the
[28:14] progeny after that are walking with God
[28:16] but in the process of time this false
[28:18] worship begins to take over the
[28:20] daughters of men marry with the sons of
[28:22] God and these Bloodlines begin to mix to
[28:24] where it culminates in God destroying
[28:27] the earth except for Noah his sons and
[28:30] their wives and these are the ones that
[28:33] live that survived the flood and God has
[28:35] essentially starting all over in Genesis
[28:37] chapter 9 he's given a covenant to Noah
[28:39] to to multiply and replenish the Earth
[28:42] and there's a covenant made with those
[28:43] that would inhabit the Earth and now
[28:45] they're starting over under a different
[28:46] Covenant and from then from Noah's
[28:49] family alone is the whole earth going to
[28:51] be overspread there's not going to be
[28:52] Cain and through his half-sister race
[28:55] and there's going to be Adam and his
[28:56] sons in their race they're not now
[28:58] really going to all be One race the
[29:00] human race
[29:01] and Genesis chapter 10
[29:04] is going to uh I'm wanting just to look
[29:07] at this in the way to see that how this
[29:09] false religion just takes hold so
[29:11] quickly
[29:13] and in the generations of Noah
[29:15] it says and Kush begat nimrod
[29:18] he began to be a mighty one in the Earth
[29:22] he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord
[29:25] wherefore it is said even as Nimrod the
[29:27] mighty Hunter before the Lord
[29:29] and the beginning of his kingdom notice
[29:32] how quickly it comes to this the
[29:33] beginning of his kingdom was Babel and
[29:36] Eric and akkad and kalna in the land of
[29:39] shinar
[29:41] you may read that and say he was a
[29:42] mighty Hunter before the Lord the
[29:44] Septuagint and other translations render
[29:47] it he was a mighty Hunter against the
[29:49] Lord
[29:51] the phrase there is not that he walked
[29:52] before the Lord and was perfect and that
[29:54] he was before the Lord in a worshipful
[29:56] way or that he was before the Lord in an
[29:57] honorable way but this is a man who is
[30:00] against the Lord
[30:01] the language suggests that he was
[30:03] arrogant against God he was haughty
[30:05] against God I'm a man of renown I'm a
[30:07] powerful man this this nature that was
[30:09] to rise up against us and how it would
[30:11] have been taking over the Earth with
[30:13] weakened humanity and as man begins to
[30:16] multiply in the Earth the Beast of the
[30:17] field are multiplying against him and uh
[30:19] the animal kingdom is rising up in this
[30:21] Mighty way Nimrod is like wow look I can
[30:23] tame the Beast I can hunt down these
[30:25] animals and these ones that are so
[30:27] voracious against us and horrible I I
[30:29] I'm able to conquer them and it says
[30:32] that he was a mighty Hunter against the
[30:34] Lord and the beginning of his kingdom
[30:35] it's the first mention of kingdom in the
[30:38] Bible
[30:39] this is a man whose kingdom was from the
[30:41] beginning against the Lord
[30:43] his kingdom is Babel
[30:46] and the ambition of nimrod as you
[30:48] remember the scriptures we used through
[30:50] the last several scriptures the ambition
[30:52] of nimrod is right in harmony with
[30:54] Satan's ambition
[30:56] it's against God his plan and his
[30:59] objective opposes God it's an anti-god
[31:02] he wanted to be a Lucifer wanted to be
[31:04] like God he wanted to overthrow the
[31:05] kingdoms of God now Nimrod comes against
[31:07] the Lord
[31:09] and it should be no surprise to us that
[31:12] the first Kingdom that emerges After the
[31:13] flood and the beginning of his kingdom
[31:14] was Babel that's the beginning of his
[31:17] kingdom and these cities are all built
[31:18] along the river Euphrates and Babel is
[31:22] the ancient word for Babylon
[31:25] and it means mixed
[31:29] means to mix oneself it means to mingle
[31:34] and then the other the other word it
[31:35] says the beginning of his kingdom is
[31:37] Babel and a wreck which means to grow uh
[31:39] to prolong or to continue
[31:42] and so now Satan he is the architect he
[31:45] is the designer and the inspiration of
[31:47] this Kingdom his and this one Nimrod
[31:51] who's against the Lord he now begins to
[31:53] embody the nature of Satan the nature
[31:55] that was uh used of the serpent now he's
[31:58] coming to this building a kingdom and
[32:01] it's the beginning of Satan's kingdom
[32:03] now post flood is Babble to mix
[32:06] to mix oneself to mingle and it says
[32:09] that it is in the land of shinar which
[32:12] is the ancient name for Babylon or
[32:14] chaldea
[32:15] the the place of between two rivers
[32:17] trying to identify that spot there was
[32:20] four rivers there in the beginning now
[32:21] those rivers that may have been
[32:23] eradicated in the flood they only
[32:24] identified two rivers that remain he's
[32:26] one to find that Source of Life he's
[32:28] wanting to be right there in the place
[32:30] where God built his garden so he's going
[32:31] to begin to build a kingdom on earth
[32:34] that is mimicking in pattern the kingdom
[32:37] that was in the Garden of Eden and the
[32:39] kingdom that was reflected in heaven
[32:42] he is the architect of it he's the
[32:44] inspiration of this Kingdom
[32:46] and in verse 4 Genesis chapter 11 verse
[32:48] 4 I think I'll just pick up on more of
[32:50] this on Sunday or maybe next Wednesday
[32:52] now the people that are populating the
[32:55] Earth say
[32:56] go to let us build us
[32:59] a city and a tower
[33:02] whose top May reach unto heaven let us
[33:05] make us a name
[33:07] when Cain had a son he named it after he
[33:10] built a city and named it after his son
[33:12] that's when that's when the sun now
[33:14] begins uh this perversion of to be
[33:17] renowned to be remembered to have this
[33:19] kind of legacy to build a kingdom to
[33:21] yourself men not calling upon the name
[33:23] of the Lord and calling themselves the
[33:24] Son of God so that their legacy is
[33:26] essentially in heaven they're wanting to
[33:28] establish something here on Earth let us
[33:29] build us a city in a tower I'd like to
[33:32] get into it maybe a little bit more at
[33:34] another time whose Tower May reach unto
[33:36] Heaven their very reason why they're
[33:38] wanting to do this to let us make us a
[33:40] name lest we be scattered abroad upon
[33:42] the face of the whole earth is in
[33:44] defiance to God's commission to know in
[33:46] Genesis 9.
[33:47] they're saying oh God told us to
[33:49] multiply and spread out upon the Earth
[33:50] sorry buddy you know what we're going to
[33:52] do we're just gonna go up
[33:53] we're not going to populate the whole
[33:55] earth we're going to rise up to heaven
[33:56] and if you ever try to flood the Earth
[33:58] again we're going to have a city and a
[34:01] kingdom that can rise above all your
[34:03] floods maybe they saw a high water mark
[34:05] maybe they knew just exactly how high
[34:06] they would need to build it and they had
[34:08] some sensor idea of what they would need
[34:10] to do to overcome the judgments of God
[34:11] do you realize just how anti-word they
[34:13] were how arrogant they were let us build
[34:16] us a city let us make us a name we're
[34:18] not going to scatter upon the Earth
[34:20] we're not going to multiply and
[34:21] replenish and fill up the Earth as God
[34:23] commanded Our Father know what to do but
[34:25] no we're going to make names for
[34:26] ourselves
[34:28] this is the beginning of nimrod's
[34:31] kingdom this is Babel
[34:34] which is the first word in the Bible for
[34:37] Babylon
[34:39] I was going to preach a different sermon
[34:40] tonight on Babylon and I felt well maybe
[34:43] I should just back up with the safe
[34:45] crowd
[34:46] and give some background to on where
[34:48] Babylon begin
[34:50] and Babylon begins as Babel the
[34:53] beginning of nimrod's kingdom was babble
[34:56] in the church age book chapter 5 and the
[34:58] pergamian church age someone already
[35:00] quoted this when I said Babel means they
[35:02] were already
[35:03] quoting from this church age book Babel
[35:05] is the original name for Babylon it
[35:07] means confusion
[35:09] where does the confusion come from
[35:10] mixing
[35:12] that's where it began in the very
[35:13] beginning just the mixture
[35:15] how did we get all the evil in the world
[35:17] just take two good things and put them
[35:19] out mix them out of place
[35:21] and it causes confusion
[35:23] Babble is the original name for Babylon
[35:25] it means confusion
[35:27] it was literally started by cush the son
[35:30] of him
[35:31] but was brought to a kingdom of power
[35:34] and Grandeur under his son Nimrod the
[35:37] mighty Hunter remember how the Bible
[35:39] says before the Lord meaning against the
[35:43] Lord
[35:44] so this Kingdom of Babel Babylon
[35:47] confusion to mix or to mingle to me is
[35:50] remarkable that now that we have a mixed
[35:52] race the very beginning of the kingdom
[35:53] is defined as a mixture a hybrid and
[35:57] it's confusion utter confusion it is
[36:00] against God it's a seated discrepancy
[36:02] manifested itself it's anti-god it's
[36:04] against the word it opposes God it
[36:06] exalts itself against God here's a
[36:08] mighty Hunter Nimrod according to the
[36:09] Genesis 11 account and also according to
[36:12] profane history set out to accomplish
[36:15] three things
[36:17] he wanted to build a strong nation which
[36:19] he did
[36:20] he wanted to propagate his own religion
[36:22] which he did he wanted to make a name
[36:24] for himself which he also accomplished
[36:28] his accomplishments were so Monumental
[36:30] that the kingdom of Babylon was called
[36:33] the head of gold amongst all the world
[36:36] governments
[36:38] so now it's not just a
[36:40] a localized Kingdom it's not one that
[36:43] would look back in history and say wow
[36:45] this guy was the ruler of Mesopotamia
[36:46] and and some acknowledgment of a mighty
[36:49] Hunter within some region but it becomes
[36:51] like the The Benchmark the symbol
[36:55] a kingdom of Babylons the head of gold
[36:58] amongst all World governments that his
[37:01] religion gave prominence is proven by
[37:03] the fact that scripture identifies it
[37:06] and this is where we escalate very
[37:07] quickly all the way to the end
[37:08] identifies it with saying Satan
[37:11] completely in Isaiah chapter 14 and in
[37:15] Revelations chapter 17 and 18. this is
[37:17] the the outline I've been working on in
[37:19] some of these service you see in chapter
[37:21] 14 of Isaiah and we're wanting to come
[37:24] to the fruits of it in Revelation 17 and
[37:26] 18. how it began in this as a seed in
[37:28] the beginning as a lie you shall not
[37:30] surely die
[37:31] that's where it began in Satan's Eden or
[37:33] in God's Eden and Satan's Eden and its
[37:36] climax is described in Revelation 17 and
[37:38] Revelations 18.
[37:40] and by history we can prove
[37:42] that it invaded the whole world
[37:45] and is the basis for every system of
[37:48] idolatry
[37:49] and the theme of Mythology through the
[37:52] names of the Gods though the names of
[37:54] the Gods differ in various sections of
[37:56] the land according to the language of
[37:57] the people so
[38:00] it's all tracks back to the same it all
[38:02] comes from the same thing isn't any
[38:03] wonder that you'll find different
[38:04] narratives that are very very similar is
[38:06] any wonder that the allegories and the
[38:08] all traditions and the stories that have
[38:09] been passed down that they're just
[38:11] recycling all these different narratives
[38:12] that have always existed because it all
[38:14] comes from a singular Source the
[38:16] ambition of Satan to be worshiped as God
[38:18] and it doesn't matter to him if they all
[38:21] use different names they have all
[38:22] different ideas and different ways it's
[38:23] going to end in different ways that it
[38:25] began as long as he's the one being
[38:27] worshiped and not the true God
[38:30] because he's behind it all he's the
[38:32] father of it all God has not fathered
[38:34] multiple religions and multiple ways of
[38:38] being worshiped and being multiple
[38:39] deities oh well you worship the son I'm
[38:41] in the Sun Well you worship the water
[38:42] I'm in the water no God is worshiped
[38:45] through one way alone and that's through
[38:46] spirit and Truth
[38:48] says that he made a name for himself and
[38:50] his followers goes without saying
[38:53] for as long as this present age goes on
[38:56] he says until Jesus reveals himself to
[38:58] his brethren because that's when there's
[39:00] this shift this giant shift that takes
[39:03] place the pre-millennial purging and the
[39:05] millennial Reign upon the Earth until
[39:07] then
[39:09] he will be worshiped and honored
[39:11] though under a different name from
[39:12] nimrod
[39:13] and as a temple and in a temple slightly
[39:16] different from the one in which he was
[39:17] originally adored
[39:20] this is Brother Branham identifying how
[39:23] that in the beginning after the fall
[39:25] when Babel rise up Rises up it's the
[39:28] first of Babylon that you see in the end
[39:31] in the same Satan that was worshiped
[39:33] then is the same one that's worshiped in
[39:35] the end who sits in the temple being
[39:37] worshiped as God as we read in
[39:38] Thessalonians this is what he wanted
[39:39] this was his ambition he wants to be the
[39:41] one that has looked to and they think
[39:43] they're worshiping God but they're
[39:45] actually worshiping Satan
[39:48] and as brother Branham took it from
[39:50] nimrod
[39:51] being under this inspiration of Lucifer
[39:55] in Isaiah chapter 14. I will exalt
[39:58] myself the king of Tyree the I'll exalt
[40:00] myself above the stars of God I will be
[40:02] like the most high I want to sit on the
[40:04] sides of the North and the Mount of the
[40:06] congregation I want to be lifted up I
[40:07] want to be exalted I want to have the
[40:08] throne I want even in the language I
[40:11] want to exalt myself above the sons of
[40:13] God how could he exalt himself above the
[40:15] sons of God by making the sons of God
[40:17] diminish themselves in the way Nations
[40:20] being weakened and being brought down to
[40:22] earth and now that the sons of God have
[40:23] intermarried and mingled themselves he's
[40:25] rising up being worshiped
[40:28] through his through the through the
[40:29] mixture and the mingling of Babylon
[40:33] and brother Branham identified it in
[40:34] Revelations chapter 17 and 18.
[40:37] and let's just look at Revelations
[40:39] chapter 18 verses 1 to 3.
[40:42] I'll close I'll close with these with
[40:45] these things here
[40:51] now we're
[40:52] I know we're kind of fast forwarding
[40:54] forwarding this and I'm doing it because
[40:56] there's just no way I'm going to spend I
[40:58] can't spend four services on it and then
[41:01] get to Revelation 17 and you all be like
[41:02] what that's Babylon we already know it
[41:06] I'm not I'm not going to surprise
[41:08] anybody
[41:09] you know this is like I I did not know
[41:11] it was a mother Harlot and it was
[41:13] Babylon and it's this religious system
[41:15] and I just thought we were all brothers
[41:16] and we were all serving God and no we
[41:19] know these things so I could come to
[41:21] here because some of you are saying well
[41:22] you just get there will you just get
[41:23] there please Revelations 18 I want to
[41:25] get to 19 and 20. I want to get to the
[41:27] end
[41:27] and so in Revelations 18 verses 1 to 3
[41:30] and after these things I saw another
[41:32] angel came down come down from heaven
[41:34] and having great power and the Earth was
[41:36] enlightened with his glory verse two and
[41:38] he cried mightily with the strong voice
[41:40] saying now
[41:41] we're not going to look so much at what
[41:43] he is saying about Babylon
[41:46] the great falling but look at what it's
[41:48] become Babylon the great is Fallen is
[41:51] Fallen
[41:52] and that even that description describes
[41:54] what Babylon the whole Ark of Babylon is
[41:57] from the very beginning
[41:58] and has become
[42:00] the habitation of devils
[42:03] remember Satan's
[42:04] um ambition in the beginning is he
[42:07] wanted to indwell man as God indwelled
[42:09] in man
[42:11] now this is where to me
[42:15] what brother Branham is teaching us and
[42:16] zeroing in is tying up a lot of loose
[42:19] ends and taking a lot of things for us
[42:21] to recognize that Satan has always been
[42:23] projecting himself certain ways and men
[42:26] men have always been wrestling with
[42:27] certain truths and presented certain
[42:28] truths and brother Branham is able to
[42:30] take these things and zero in on it to
[42:33] where we see that's what Satan was
[42:34] wanting to do God Alone had reserved
[42:37] flesh for him to dwell in Satan creates
[42:40] a like flesh human and Mankind in such a
[42:43] way that he can dwell in it and now God
[42:45] looks at it at the end in Revelations 18
[42:47] and says that Babylon has become the
[42:49] habitation of devils how did Brother
[42:51] Branham say it I believe we were on
[42:53] Sunday through the people
[42:55] and the hold of every foul Spirit and
[42:58] the cage of every unclean and hateful
[43:01] bird
[43:01] Revelation 17 describes it in different
[43:04] ways and identifies us to us that
[43:06] spiritual Babylon this mother harlot in
[43:09] all of her daughters which is
[43:10] represented in a spiritual Babylon and a
[43:12] religious system now as the scripture
[43:14] looks at it and Revelation Revelations
[43:16] 18 habitation of devils the hold of
[43:18] every foul spirit
[43:20] so if there's a foul spirit it's in her
[43:23] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[43:25] it's in her for all nations have drunk
[43:27] of the wine of the wrath of her for
[43:29] fornication what a description
[43:31] brings us all the way back to the
[43:33] beginning and the kings of the Earth
[43:34] have committed fornication with her and
[43:37] the merchants of the Earth are waxed
[43:38] Rich through the abundance of her
[43:39] Delicacies what a description
[43:42] what an incredible uh way to describe
[43:45] what John saw in chapter 17 is wow what
[43:48] a Wonder
[43:50] incredibly powerful uh system
[43:53] a kingdom an economy now the Bible is
[43:58] saying this is what it is no matter how
[44:01] beautiful it looks
[44:02] no matter how rich it is and no matter
[44:04] how
[44:05] uh wonderful it may and it may offer its
[44:09] amenities and how religious and
[44:11] spiritual and profound and great
[44:12] remember that it says that it'll be so
[44:14] close it could deceive the very elective
[44:16] possible
[44:18] if everyone could just look and it signs
[44:20] that habitation of devils we'd like
[44:22] right
[44:23] we see look in there there's a cage full
[44:25] of unclean and hateful birds like ah no
[44:27] thank you
[44:28] I'm not interested but it presents
[44:31] itself in glory it presents itself as
[44:33] signs and wonders it presents itself as
[44:35] Rich to increase with Goods it presents
[44:37] itself in a very
[44:39] awesome inspiring way is when John
[44:41] thought wow he wandered at it but now
[44:43] what's behind it the ambition of Lucifer
[44:48] the culmination of everything he was
[44:50] sowing in the beginning even the very
[44:51] climax of Babel in Genesis 10 this is
[44:55] Satan's kingdom Satan's Eden
[44:59] and something to really Ponder
[45:02] is it comes to this
[45:04] after Satan's even comes to this image
[45:07] after Christ is kicked out of the church
[45:10] once he's kicked out of the church in
[45:12] laodicea now Satan can bring it to where
[45:15] it's the hold of every habitation of
[45:18] devils the hold of every foul Spirit the
[45:20] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[45:21] Christ has been pushed out
[45:24] so now all there is is a cavity again
[45:26] a vacuum just like he did in the Garden
[45:28] of Eden now he fills it up with
[45:30] confusion he fills it up with Babylon
[45:34] brother Branham continues I'm cut out a
[45:37] rather somewhat lengthy portion maybe
[45:39] two paragraphs or so from the church age
[45:42] book where brother Brown was saying that
[45:43] he's now being worshiped in a temple
[45:45] differently than what he was originally
[45:47] adored and
[45:49] he continues to talk about Satan's
[45:51] ambition
[45:53] and how this is what he wanted to do all
[45:54] along he wanted to be worshiped as God
[45:56] this is what the thoughts he had in the
[45:57] beginning so it's brother Branham who's
[45:58] kind of tracking this for us he said
[46:00] there's no time to engage in a
[46:02] discussion of this
[46:03] it is merely introduced that you may see
[46:07] that there were two religions and two
[46:09] only
[46:10] and the evil one became worldwide
[46:14] two religions and two religions only you
[46:17] had the worship of the one true God and
[46:19] everything else
[46:21] and he says monotheism turned to
[46:23] polytheism in Babylon
[46:25] where there was the worship of one true
[46:28] God
[46:29] this is something that's actually been
[46:31] studied quite extensively I believe
[46:32] brother Branham quotes from a couple
[46:34] historians historians In this passage
[46:35] you can go back and read their their
[46:38] surmisings from ancient texts and
[46:40] ancient religions out of Egypt and all
[46:41] over and all the different gods that
[46:43] existed they say that there was and even
[46:45] whether it be Islam and these other
[46:47] religions they they look back and say
[46:50] that in ancient times and everything
[46:52] that we can gather we see that at one
[46:54] time they all believed in one true God
[46:57] and Satan wasn't satisfied in just
[47:00] having one true God he wanted to cause
[47:03] confusion
[47:04] so now the one true God is split up into
[47:07] polytheism
[47:09] and this statement to me was inspiration
[47:11] in the beginning when we started this
[47:12] series on the kingdom the devil's lie
[47:15] and the devil's Mysteries rose up
[47:18] against the truth of God and the
[47:21] mysteries of God in that City
[47:24] the city of Babel in the beginning of
[47:27] Babylon this is where Satan begins to
[47:29] spread his lie and his Mysteries
[47:35] and to look at it that way the devil
[47:37] used a lie in the Garden of Eden
[47:39] and and it and he even begins it I guess
[47:43] it's a very interesting language he has
[47:45] his own Mysteries
[47:47] and that's why you can't just get you
[47:49] know can't just love to have your ears
[47:51] itched right and like oh man I just love
[47:52] the Mysteries I love the Deep things man
[47:54] there's some people that preach things
[47:55] that are mysterious because that's
[47:58] exactly all they are is mysterious
[48:00] you know just ways I remember I think
[48:02] I've shared this before one time a man
[48:04] taught on the godhead and afterwards a
[48:07] sister left the church and said
[48:09] I don't know whether there's one God
[48:11] three or five Gods but that was deep
[48:15] and and the only thing that was deep is
[48:17] the hole that's being dug right you're
[48:20] just digging yourself a hole it may seem
[48:21] deep but the devil has Mysteries like
[48:23] whoa isn't that mysterious isn't that
[48:25] neat and this is what he wanted to do in
[48:27] the beginning the devil's lie in the
[48:29] devil's mystery so the lie that he spoke
[48:31] in the very beginning that's what he is
[48:32] the father of lies and now the devil's
[48:35] mystery make things mysterious make them
[48:36] make things confusing even he's able to
[48:39] create records and sew things in and do
[48:41] all sorts of stuff why to cause
[48:42] confusion it rises up against the truth
[48:45] of God and the mysteries of God in
[48:48] Babylon
[48:49] Satan wants to destroy the mysteries of
[48:52] God he rises up against the truth of God
[48:54] this is what is a sale this is what is
[48:56] attack this is what is being divided is
[48:58] the mystery of God and the truth of God
[49:01] God created the Earth for a purpose to
[49:03] get a bride out of it now Satan wants to
[49:06] raise up his own bride and present her
[49:08] as being the very thing that God wanted
[49:09] to achieve in the beginning so that he
[49:11] through her can receive all the worship
[49:13] and so it's the devil's lies and the
[49:15] devil's Mysteries that are rising up
[49:16] against the truth of God the word of God
[49:19] in the mystery of God that wants to be
[49:21] revealed through the truth in that City
[49:25] in Babel the beginning of Babylon
[49:28] brother Brown says Satan truly became
[49:30] the God of this world
[49:31] and exacted worship from those that he
[49:34] had duped causing them to believe that
[49:36] he truly he was truly
[49:39] the Lord
[49:44] I know I'm looking at the end
[49:48] and so we're not necessarily tracking it
[49:49] the trail of the serpent through the Old
[49:51] Testament
[49:54] you know what verse 4 says right
[49:56] Revelations 18 4.
[49:59] God identifies the condition of this
[50:01] church the condition of the world and
[50:03] all of Satan's kingdoms and it says and
[50:05] I heard another voice from Heaven saying
[50:07] come out of her my people
[50:10] that you be not partakers of her sins
[50:13] and that you receive not of her plagues
[50:15] another voice
[50:19] says in Revelation
[50:20] 20. I
[50:24] If any man will open up if he'll hear my
[50:27] voice and open the door I will come into
[50:29] him and will sup with him and he with me
[50:31] this is feasting with the Lord as we
[50:34] said Sunday in the presence of all our
[50:36] enemies
[50:38] in the very middle of Satan's Eden
[50:40] there's a voice that says come out of
[50:42] her my people
[50:44] why because I'm going to judge her come
[50:47] out of her that you not partake of her
[50:48] sins that you receive not of her plagues
[50:50] and brother Branham identifies himself
[50:53] with this voice of Revelations 18 4
[50:55] saying come out of her my people come
[50:57] out of the religious systems come out of
[50:59] Catholicism come out of
[51:00] denominationalism come out of
[51:02] babylonianism come out of all come out
[51:04] of Bible come out of the confusion
[51:07] what does he use to bring us to it the
[51:09] revelation of the mystery of God the
[51:11] restoration of the truth of God the
[51:13] restoration of the word as it rose up in
[51:15] Babble against the truth as the devil's
[51:17] lies rose up against the God's truth as
[51:19] a devil's Mysteries rose up to confuse
[51:21] the mysteries of God is it any wonder
[51:23] that in the end the mysteries of God are
[51:25] being revealed and all the loose sins
[51:27] are being tied together and it's those
[51:28] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[51:30] begin to pull us out of a Babylon
[51:32] condition
[51:33] well because it rose up that way in the
[51:35] beginning in Bible so it's going to take
[51:37] the very answer to that the restoration
[51:39] of that to shake us from those things
[51:43] the Bible says in Genesis 11 31
[51:47] that Abram went forth from Earth
[51:51] which means Flame
[51:53] of chaldea
[51:54] what does God tell us in the very Book
[51:56] of Genesis where this Mighty Man raises
[51:59] up with the Tower of BaByliss being
[52:01] erected and the Very seeds of Babylon
[52:03] are being planted at a one-day grow into
[52:05] this beautifully powerful woman in
[52:07] Revelation 17. he says come out of her
[52:10] my people in Revelations 18 4 and you go
[52:12] right back to Genesis 11 Genesis 12 and
[52:14] you see that God did the same thing in
[52:15] Abraham
[52:17] said come out of her
[52:19] come out of here and I'll I'm going to
[52:20] show you a land that I'm gonna I'm gonna
[52:22] give you
[52:23] and it's in the very place where Babylon
[52:25] was raising up
[52:27] but it's right in the very place where
[52:28] the New Jerusalem is going to come and
[52:30] settle back down on
[52:31] because he gives us the image he gives
[52:33] us the type he shows us that I'm going
[52:35] to call the people out of Babylon
[52:38] because what does I think I say this
[52:40] quite often when God calls Abram it's a
[52:43] it's a complete interrupt to the
[52:44] narrative
[52:46] we have Genesis 1 to Genesis 11 tells us
[52:49] the history of 2000 years we get this we
[52:52] get four thousand years roughly of
[52:54] history of mankind and the flood and we
[52:57] see so much just sandwiched in a very
[52:59] short period of time and God has just
[53:01] want us to understand the context for
[53:03] how you'd say Abram I want you to get
[53:05] out of the flames
[53:07] get out of er come away from Babylon
[53:10] come away from the seed of all this
[53:11] demonic worship come away from
[53:13] polytheism come away and I'm going to
[53:15] reveal myself to you because I'm the one
[53:17] true God
[53:18] the one who spoke and caused the worlds
[53:21] to come into existence I'm going to make
[53:22] myself known to you and from then on we
[53:24] only know about the world
[53:27] and the rest of what we only know about
[53:28] Babylon as it relates to Israel
[53:30] because God keeps using Babylon for
[53:32] judgment and they only enter into the
[53:34] narrative because God's focusing on
[53:35] Israel and they only enter the picture
[53:37] until after God the gospel turns to the
[53:40] Jews and then now once God is in the
[53:42] kingdoms of this world the time and the
[53:44] hour for all these Kings to be
[53:45] overthrown and the gospel is going to go
[53:47] to the Gentiles and begin to break the
[53:49] bow the bounds of polytheism and break
[53:51] the chains of this false worship and
[53:53] break the chains of all these demon
[53:55] powers in the Gentiles and the Heathen
[53:56] it's then that we begin to look outward
[53:58] and think about the whole world
[54:01] so this beautiful image
[54:03] of Abram being called out of Babylon
[54:05] it's there to tell us that in the end it
[54:07] shows us in the end this is what God is
[54:09] doing he's calling you out of Babylonian
[54:10] thinking
[54:12] calling you away from this Babylon
[54:14] system into his kingdom I believe an
[54:17] interns has been ministered to us in
[54:19] this hour they're saying come out of her
[54:21] my people that you be not partakers of
[54:23] our sins
[54:25] amen but Micah could you come to the
[54:27] piano
[54:28] God bless you let's stand tonight
