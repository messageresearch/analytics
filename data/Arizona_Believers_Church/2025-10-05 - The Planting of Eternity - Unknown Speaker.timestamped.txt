[0:00] Ecclesiastes chapter 6. I'm going to
[0:02] read verses 1 to9 and then I'm going to
[0:04] read verse 11. In chapter 3, there is an
[0:08] evil which I have seen unto the son, and
[0:11] it is common among men. A man to whom
[0:14] God hath given riches, wealth, and
[0:16] honor, so that he wantketh nothing for
[0:18] his soul of all that he desireth. Yet
[0:20] God giveth him not power to eat thereof,
[0:23] but a stranger eateth it. This is
[0:25] vanity, and it is an evil disease. If a
[0:28] man beget a hundred children and live
[0:30] many years, so that the days of his
[0:32] years be many, and his soul be not
[0:34] filled with good, and also that he have
[0:35] no burial, I say that an untimely birth
[0:39] is better than heed. For he cometh in
[0:42] with vanity, and departeth in darkness,
[0:44] and his name shall be covered with
[0:46] darkness. Moreover, he hath not seen the
[0:48] sun, nor know anything.
[0:50] This hath more rest. Moreover, he that
[0:52] hath not seen the sun, nor known
[0:54] anything, this hath more rest than the
[0:56] other. Yay, though he live a thousand
[0:59] years twice told, yet hath he seen no
[1:01] good. Do not all go to one place. All
[1:05] the labor of man is for his mouth, and
[1:07] yet the appetite is not filled. For what
[1:10] hath the wise more than the fool? What
[1:12] hath the poor that knoweth to walk
[1:14] before the living? Better is the sight
[1:16] of the eyes than the wandering of the
[1:18] desire. This is also vanity and vexation
[1:22] of spirit.
[1:24] And then Ecclesiastes chapter 3 11, he
[1:28] hath made everything beautiful in his
[1:31] time. Also, he hath set the world in
[1:34] their heart, so that no man can find out
[1:37] the work that God maketh from the
[1:38] beginning to the end. If we could just
[1:42] bow our heads in a word of prayer. Our
[1:44] gracious heavenly father,
[1:47] we're thankful that we have this
[1:49] opportunity to be gathered together in
[1:50] your presence today. We are remembering
[1:53] those that aren't with us. Whether it be
[1:54] by sickness, Lord, Brother Alfonso,
[1:56] recovering from surgery, whether it be
[1:58] traveling, maybe even for some it's just
[2:01] a coldness, maybe it's a difficulty,
[2:03] it's a hardship, it's a a depression or
[2:06] an anxiety that just they haven't been
[2:07] able to overcome, a complex so that
[2:10] making it to the house of the Lord is
[2:11] very difficult on them. Lord, we pray in
[2:14] love and with just a a grace for them
[2:16] that you would be merciful that you'd
[2:17] help them in their circumstance. And
[2:19] Lord, as we realize it is incumbent upon
[2:22] us as believers to gather together and
[2:24] that it is your will that we would
[2:26] assemble ourselves in church. If there
[2:28] be those that are unable to or have
[2:30] chosen not to, Lord, we pray that you'd
[2:31] be merciful to them. Sustain them for we
[2:34] know it's a dangerous place to be. And
[2:36] Lord, today as we have arrived here, we
[2:39] are here and our hearts are open. Speak
[2:41] to us through your word. Bless these
[2:43] scriptures which we have read. May they
[2:44] be made alive to us by revelation. We
[2:47] ask all this in the name of the Lord
[2:48] Jesus Christ. Amen. You can be seated.
[2:54] My title is the planting of eternity.
[2:57] And it may not be obvious, but I'm
[2:59] taking it from Ecclesiastes chapter 3
[3:02] 11, the planting of eternity. And I
[3:05] would ask that everyone, if you could,
[3:06] not that you don't normally do this, but
[3:08] focus this morning. I do think in
[3:10] exploring this subject today, it's a
[3:13] very simple uh of often repeated
[3:16] principles in terms of the planting uh
[3:18] and seed and sewing and harvest. It's
[3:20] not very deep, but I believe that it is
[3:22] impactful. And I feel that the
[3:25] principles in the word of God that
[3:27] relate to a planting and the seed and a
[3:30] harvest are some of the most important
[3:31] things we could ever see. It's something
[3:33] that God says God is not mocked. The
[3:35] Bible says he's not mocked. Whatever God
[3:37] a man sws, he reaps. And I believe that
[3:40] these principles are extremely relevant
[3:43] uh to the harvest time and even to
[3:44] current events and things that we're
[3:46] seeing whether it be in our own lives
[3:47] personally or things in the church or
[3:49] things at abroad. And uh these
[3:52] principles are at the very core of the
[3:54] message, very core of of the word of God
[3:56] and the rapture where God is wanting
[3:58] Genesis being a seed chapter. Revelation
[4:01] is that that that fruit where we see
[4:03] everything come up. And so these things
[4:05] are very very important. And I'm using
[4:07] this phrasing the planting of eternity
[4:09] just so that we're all kind of on the
[4:12] same page. We spent ministered Wednesday
[4:14] night on being and becoming. And we
[4:16] looked at it from the standpoint of a
[4:17] personal responsibility and even a
[4:19] parental responsibility of being which
[4:22] is be your existence but then also the
[4:24] becoming wherein you uh reach that
[4:27] potential uh your potential. you realize
[4:29] a higher level of potentiality
[4:32] and as individuals we have a present
[4:34] responsibility over our present
[4:36] condition uh to look after our lives and
[4:38] to live a godly life and then even this
[4:41] process of what we're changing into
[4:43] don't always want to stay the same but
[4:45] we want to be growing and that extends
[4:47] to a parental responsibility that I
[4:49] believe is obvious in the fact that you
[4:50] bring forth life you cause being but
[4:53] then also the process of what that life
[4:55] becomes and those were the principles
[4:57] that we're expressing Wednesday tonight.
[4:59] It tied together with the prelude of
[5:00] sewing seed and the kota of the fruit or
[5:04] the harvest of what has gone before. And
[5:07] something that I'm exploring just
[5:10] personally as I look into these things
[5:11] from our own family, my own life, but
[5:13] then I believe it's relevant in these
[5:15] things that we're teaching is the Bible
[5:16] teaches that there is a duty attached to
[5:19] every talent that we possess. God having
[5:22] given us gifts or given us certain
[5:23] abilities uh we have to we have a duty
[5:26] to that talent or to that gift. We use
[5:30] kind of this terminology of talent is a
[5:32] natural ability or a gift and the skill
[5:35] would be the development of that. So you
[5:38] can have a natural gift but your skill
[5:40] is when you employ that talent for a
[5:42] particular use and you use it for good
[5:45] your craft of using your talent. So
[5:47] those are the some of the things that we
[5:49] were ministering on Wednesday and I'm
[5:51] still continuing in those thoughts. Now
[5:53] if you look at Ecclesiastes chapter 3 11
[5:58] it says he hath made everything
[6:00] beautiful in his time. God has done
[6:02] this. God has made everything beautiful
[6:04] and becoming in his time. So he has a
[6:07] timing. He has a process. You may look
[6:09] at something and say well that seems
[6:10] incomplete or I don't see the full
[6:12] beauty of it yet. Let God continue his
[6:14] work. He will perfect that which he has
[6:17] begun. He'll finish what he started.
[6:19] He's made everything beautiful in his
[6:20] time. Also, he hath set the world in
[6:23] their heart so that no man can find out
[6:26] the work that God maketh from the
[6:27] beginning to the end. So, he has set the
[6:30] world in their heart. And he's speaking
[6:32] of so that no man can find out. And he's
[6:34] talking about the work that God maketh.
[6:36] The work that God makes from the
[6:38] beginning to the end. He makes
[6:39] everything beautiful in his time. So he
[6:42] begins something and it's going to be
[6:43] beautiful through this process. He's
[6:45] going to it's going to reach this
[6:47] perfection or this completion. But he
[6:49] says that he set uh something in their
[6:52] heart, the world in their heart so that
[6:53] that man is not still yet even though
[6:56] it's in his heart and God makes
[6:58] everything beautiful in his time. Man
[6:59] himself is not able to figure it out to
[7:01] figure out what God is doing. And so the
[7:04] the work that God maketh this is his
[7:06] work product. This is his artwork. This
[7:08] is his creation. And this phrase hath
[7:11] set the world in their heart is a very
[7:14] unique phrase. And in some translations
[7:17] and if you kind of read read and studied
[7:19] the words out yourself I think you could
[7:21] arrive to this conclusion. I'm not
[7:22] asking you to do it but some of the
[7:24] translations read it this way. God has
[7:26] planted eternity in the human heart.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; I think of this principle. He's planted
[7:32] eternity in man's heart. This sense of
[7:35] divine purpose. He makes everything
[7:37] beautiful in his time. And he's also
[7:39] planted eternity in their heart. This
[7:41] mysterious longing within man's heart.
[7:43] And think about it in the context of the
[7:45] book of Ecclesiastes. This longing in
[7:47] inside man's heart that only God can
[7:49] quench. And that is the writer, the
[7:52] preacher Solomon in Ecclesiastes saying
[7:54] that that nothing under the sun can
[7:57] satisfy.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; As we read in verse seven of chapter
[8:00] six, all the labor of man is for his
[8:02] mouth and yet the appetite is not
[8:04] filled. He man caters to his senses. Man
[8:09] is driven by his appetites. He's hungry,
[8:11] so he wants to find food. He's cold, so
[8:13] he wants to find shelter. And so man is
[8:15] driven by what he feels and his
[8:17] appetites. And this only feeds the lust
[8:20] of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and
[8:21] the pride of life.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; That's the that's what our senses,
[8:24] that's what our human appetites will
[8:26] satisfy. But these things cannot satisfy
[8:29] the soul. As man seeks shelters, man
[8:32] seeks clothing or food. It it there's
[8:35] something in man's heart where he's
[8:36] hungering for something deeper, he
[8:39] desires something more enduring. So
[8:42] there's always this edge in man where
[8:44] he's wanting to accumulate. He's wanting
[8:45] to achieve. All the bread that you eat
[8:47] on Monday isn't going to fill you on th
[8:50] Tuesday. And I'll testify that there's
[8:53] been at least maybe a half a million
[8:55] times where I have said, "I'm never
[8:57] going to eat again." And sure enough,
[9:00] I'm eating again. Maybe within an hour
[9:01] or two of when I proclaimed I can't eat
[9:04] anymore. But yet there's some So there's
[9:07] something to the natural appetite which
[9:09] is never satisfied. And that soul that
[9:12] which feeds the natural appetites cannot
[9:14] feed the soul.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; The soul cannot be fed by the same
[9:18] substance that feeds our senses.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; The soul craves eternity.
[9:24] And unless something eternal satisfies
[9:27] this longing,
[9:29] you will always hunger and chase desire.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; You'll always be looking for something
[9:36] that'll quench this holy thirst. As
[9:39] verse 9 of chapter 6 says, "Better is
[9:41] the sight of the eyes than the wondering
[9:43] of desire." This is also vanity and
[9:45] vexation of spirit. The desire seeks
[9:47] after. It wants to have things that it
[9:49] cannot have. And the Solomon is
[9:52] observing well it's better to be
[9:53] satisfied with those things which you
[9:55] have but then there's this desire that
[9:58] wonders after other things. He said this
[9:59] is vanity and vexation of spirit. If I
[10:02] could say this as you read uh what
[10:06] Solomon the preacher is writing
[10:09] in in this book he he had all the wealth
[10:12] in the world. He had all this wisdom and
[10:14] yet none of it would ever satisfy. And
[10:15] he's looking at this from the standpoint
[10:16] of unborn again, just the natural
[10:19] perspective of things. And he's closing
[10:22] all doors to everything else but faith.
[10:25] That's why he concludes there's nothing
[10:27] better than to fear God. There is a
[10:29] closing door. It's not going to be found
[10:31] in being wise. It's not going to be
[10:32] found in being rich. It's not going to
[10:33] be found in having a lot of children.
[10:35] That there's only one thing that's going
[10:36] to satisfy, and it's that thing that
[10:38] satisfies the soul. If the heart or that
[10:42] soul is longing, if it's unsatisfied
[10:44] despite all the outward comforts and
[10:46] enjoyments as Solomon is saying, then
[10:48] that soul is not at rest.
[10:52] That's why you look at people who are uh
[10:54] billion billionaires and as we mentioned
[10:57] uh these ones that are have a lot of
[10:59] money and they have billions and
[11:01] billions and why don't they just give
[11:02] some of these billions and this half
[11:04] trillion to everybody else who doesn't
[11:06] have because there's something that's
[11:07] not satisfied
[11:09] &gt;&gt; in them.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; They're not at rest.
[11:13] And I say that Solomon the preacher here
[11:15] is realizing what Moses had already said
[11:17] about bread, about food, about
[11:19] possessions. Deuteronomy 8:3 and it
[11:22] says, "And he humbled thee, and suffered
[11:23] thee to hunger, and fed thee with mana,
[11:26] which thou kneest not, neither did thy
[11:28] fathers know, that he might make thee
[11:30] know that man doth not live by bread
[11:33] only." What an interesting uh
[11:35] circumstance that God allowed to come to
[11:37] pass.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; He made them hungry, then fed them with
[11:41] mana from heaven. And the principle was
[11:42] that man does not live by bread alone,
[11:45] but by every word that proceedth out of
[11:48] the mouth of the Lord doth man live.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus quotes in Matthew
[11:53] chapter 4 to Satan that man shall not
[11:55] live by bread alone, but by every word
[11:57] which proceedth out of the mouth of God.
[11:59] So, well, we live by bread, but bread
[12:01] alone isn't going to satisfy you. That
[12:04] being hungry, we eat, being cold, we we
[12:06] clothe ourselves, and and eating to
[12:08] sleep, we shelter ourselves. And after
[12:10] those things, the Bible says, "Does the
[12:11] Gentiles seek?" And we, our heavenly
[12:13] father knows that we have need of those
[12:15] things. And so, we have to pursue those
[12:17] things. But it's man lives by the word
[12:20] of God,
[12:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[12:21] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 13 says,
[12:23] "Meat's for the belly and the belly for
[12:25] meats."
[12:27] Kind of has a little kind of a rhythm to
[12:29] it, right? Meats for the belly and the
[12:31] belly for meats. out that saying that
[12:33] the stomach is made for food
[12:36] &gt;&gt; and food is made for the stomach.
[12:39] Listen, I know a lot of you have had
[12:40] spiritual experiences when eating.
[12:44] But that still is just a chemical
[12:46] reaction that's taking place in the
[12:48] stomach and the endorphins and it's
[12:49] like, "Oh my goodness, this is
[12:50] heavenly."
[12:52] Brother Alfonso and I one time were
[12:54] talking about, I think it was tamali's,
[12:56] and we were talking about dessert
[12:57] tamales and he goes, "I just want to
[12:58] die." And I was like, "I get it. I know
[13:00] exactly what you're talking about. And
[13:03] as much as we were kind of getting in
[13:04] the spirit of food, wang coma, it was
[13:08] not it was not spiritual.
[13:12] It was still just our natural appetites.
[13:14] Though I like to think that the natural
[13:16] type is spiritual.
[13:18] But the meats are for the belly. Food is
[13:20] for the stomach. Food is for the body.
[13:22] And the body is for food. But what about
[13:24] your head and your heart?
[13:27] &gt;&gt; What about those things that pertain to
[13:29] your spirit? And even this deeper hunger
[13:31] of the soul, what is it that nourishes
[13:33] and enriches the soul?
[13:37] What is it that sustains your spirit or
[13:39] your soul? In Ecclesiastes 5:es 9 to10,
[13:43] it says, "Moreover, the profit of the
[13:45] earth is for all. The king himself is
[13:48] served by the field." That's I want to
[13:50] come back to that. But notice this is
[13:52] the yield of the ground. He says, "He
[13:55] that loveth silver shall not be
[13:56] satisfied with silver. Nor he that
[13:58] loveth abundance with increase." This is
[13:59] also vanity. So everyone eats from the
[14:02] field and that satisfies their body. But
[14:04] the increase of silver and the abundance
[14:07] of possessions still isn't going to
[14:08] satisfy the heart of a man. We might
[14:11] find satisfaction in the things that we
[14:13] eat. Oh, I I'm full and and I can go to
[14:16] bed on a full stomach. That's why uh the
[14:18] congalles they eat fufu when they wake
[14:20] up and they eat fufu when they go to bed
[14:21] and they have enough energy through the
[14:23] day and they have enough to sleep
[14:24] through the night. And I've always tried
[14:25] to figure that out like how does that
[14:27] even work? Very thing that makes you go
[14:29] through the day is the very thing that
[14:30] makes you go to sleep. And so that
[14:32] satisfies the natural man.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; It's what allows you to rest.
[14:38] But then the Bible says in Ecclesiastes
[14:39] chapter 6 1:3
[14:42] and and it's carried on this thought of
[14:43] but then you can have as much gold as
[14:45] you want but that's not going to satisfy
[14:47] the heart.
[14:50] He said there's an evil which I have
[14:51] seen under the sun and is common among
[14:52] men. This is very strong language. A man
[14:54] to whom God hath given riches, wealth,
[14:56] and honor. So he wantketh nothing for
[14:58] his soul of all that he desires. So
[15:00] there's this desire where I I I I have
[15:03] possessions. I have food. But then he
[15:05] says this, that he might uh
[15:09] yet God giveth him not power to eat
[15:13] thereof.
[15:14] In other words, you have all of it, but
[15:16] you can't really enjoy it. And he says,
[15:20] "But a stranger eateth it." This is
[15:22] vanity, and it is an evil disease. I
[15:24] think there's a lot that's being
[15:25] expressed here, but here, a man has
[15:26] everything that he seemingly would want,
[15:28] but yet it's not really satisfying him.
[15:30] And if a man begget 100 children and
[15:31] live many years, so that the days of his
[15:33] years be many, and his soul be not
[15:35] filled with good, and also that he hath
[15:37] no burial, I say that an untimely birth
[15:39] is better than he than he. In other
[15:41] words, one that doesn't survive child
[15:44] birth.
[15:45] I look at this scripture and I take it
[15:47] within the context, I can see that the
[15:49] desires of the soul will find nothing to
[15:51] satisfied in this world.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in the world that's
[15:54] going to give true satisfaction. No man
[15:56] live a 100 years and he beggets children
[15:58] and he sees his progeny after him. None
[16:00] of this will truly satisfy the soul. As
[16:03] much as a man may have possessions, yet
[16:05] these are things that you can't eat to
[16:08] satisfy the soul of a man in the same
[16:10] way that you would eat food to satisfy
[16:12] your belly.
[16:14] Jeremiah 10 23 says, "Oh Lord, I know
[16:17] that the way of man is not in himself.
[16:20] It is not in man that walketh to direct
[16:22] his steps." That's right.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; This is what Ecclesiastes is exposing.
[16:27] Man does not really know what makes him
[16:29] happy.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; The very things that we say will make us
[16:33] happy, uh, if they happen to us, then we
[16:36] say, well, or if we said that would make
[16:37] us unhappy. Oh, I would never want that
[16:39] to happen. Never. Listen, man is just
[16:41] all over the map when it comes to
[16:42] happiness.
[16:44] Matter of fact, I I was read a book one
[16:47] time and I remember even taking these
[16:48] little snippets out and and saving them
[16:51] and using them one point because someone
[16:52] says, "It's the best thing that ever
[16:54] happened to me in my life. I'm the
[16:55] happiest man in the world because this
[16:57] happened." And you're like, "Oh, wow.
[16:59] Who was this guy?" And it's somebody
[17:01] that was paralyzed,
[17:03] paraplegic. Another one said, "This was
[17:05] the greatest thing that ever happened to
[17:06] me and I could never be happier." And he
[17:08] was the original drummer of the Beatles
[17:09] who left right before they became
[17:11] famous. And you start reading all this
[17:13] and you like a band like the Beatles? Oh
[17:15] my goodness. Wouldn't you want to be in
[17:16] that? And realize but everybody's saying
[17:19] they're happy and you say, man, we
[17:20] cannot predict happiness.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; We cannot predict the things that are
[17:24] going to make us happy. This is the
[17:25] state of man. He doesn't the way is not
[17:27] in himself. It's not in him to walk to
[17:30] direct his steps because man only
[17:32] observes the outward.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; And Solomon's able to step back and say,
[17:37] "I've I've owned everything. I've been
[17:38] able to buy this. I've been able to
[17:40] marry that. I've been able to do this.
[17:41] I've been able to do that. I've been
[17:42] able to do everything and nothing's
[17:43] satisfied. He says in the end it's all
[17:45] vanity and vexation of spirit.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; None of that could overcome because all
[17:49] these things just pertain to the
[17:51] outward.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; So he makes this statement right in the
[17:54] middle of a chapter. Ecclesiastes
[17:56] chapter 3 11. And he says God has
[17:59] planted eternity in man's heart.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; This is something internal. All these
[18:05] other things are outward. What you wear
[18:07] outward. What you eat outward. what you
[18:09] see and you enjoy and you possess silver
[18:11] and all these abundance of possessions
[18:12] it's all outward but what nourishes and
[18:14] feeds I'm asking this what nourishes and
[18:17] feeds this planting
[18:19] &gt;&gt; that God has set the world in man's
[18:21] heart
[18:23] &gt;&gt; set something in his heart as these
[18:24] translations render it he has set he's
[18:26] planted eternity in you well what feeds
[18:29] that
[18:32] I know these scriptures may seem to be
[18:33] just real common place for us but let's
[18:35] read them in Genesis chapter 2:es 4-7 7
[18:39] and we'll read a few of these places in
[18:41] the book of Genesis.
[18:45] Genesis chapter 2:4. These are the
[18:47] generations of the heavens and of the
[18:49] earth when they were created in the day
[18:51] that the Lord God made the earth and the
[18:53] heavens. This Lord God is Jehovah
[18:56] Elohim. Now, this is the God becoming.
[19:00] He was God Elohim. Now, he's expressed
[19:03] in relationship to what he has created.
[19:05] He says, "And every plant of the field
[19:07] before it was in the earth, and every
[19:09] herb of the field before it grew." Who
[19:11] put it there?
[19:13] &gt;&gt; God did. He creates the heavens and the
[19:16] earth, and every plant of the field is
[19:18] in the earth. Every herb of the field is
[19:21] in the earth before it grew. So, he
[19:23] didn't just put a full plant there. He
[19:25] put the seeds there. And it says, "For
[19:27] the Lord God had not caused it to rain
[19:29] upon the earth, and there was not a man
[19:32] to till the ground. So God planted
[19:35] original seeds.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; These seeds needed to be watered. These
[19:39] seeds needed to be nurtured. They need
[19:41] to be worked. They needed to be guarded
[19:43] or cared for. And so it's saying the
[19:45] seeds were there but God had not allowed
[19:46] them to germinate and grow be because
[19:50] one they need water. Two they needed a
[19:53] man to care for it. It says and and
[19:56] there was not a man verse 5 and there
[19:58] was not a man to till the ground. But
[20:00] there went up a mist from the earth and
[20:02] watered the whole face of the ground. So
[20:03] there's the water that was necessary.
[20:05] And the Lord God formed man of the dust
[20:07] of the ground and breathed into his
[20:08] nostrils the breath of life. And man
[20:10] became a living soul.
[20:13] The these two verses
[20:16] are are put together for a reason. I
[20:19] hope you're following. This is where I
[20:20] wanted you to focus because I know it
[20:21] just seems so simple and some you all
[20:24] might start yawning here in a minute,
[20:25] but just feel sorry for me. Like just
[20:27] enter into this burden of man, brother
[20:28] Aaron is just learning these things.
[20:30] Maybe he can get deeper in this. And
[20:32] that's where you can just pull and
[20:34] really engage. You're you're doing it
[20:36] for me.
[20:38] These two verses are necessary to be
[20:41] together. God has planted original seed
[20:43] in the earth, but there's no water and
[20:45] there's no man.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; So he brings water and immediately he
[20:50] brings forth man in flesh
[20:52] &gt;&gt; and he forms him out of the dust of the
[20:53] ground. So the plants and man come from
[20:56] the ground at the same time. What does
[20:58] that create? this this connection
[21:03] uh this symbiosis this this togetherness
[21:06] where now man has some relation to the
[21:09] earth and God has reserve the seed in
[21:12] the earth until such time that there
[21:14] will be water which will cause plants to
[21:16] grow there'll be some germination
[21:18] process that's accelerated there'll be
[21:20] some growth but then the man is there
[21:23] to work to till as the Bible says to
[21:25] till the ground
[21:29] In verse eight, it says, "And the Lord
[21:31] God," and again, this is just this is no
[21:33] coincidence. And now it says, "And the
[21:34] Lord God planted a garden eastward in
[21:37] Eden, and there he put the man whom he
[21:40] had formed."
[21:42] Look at how that God has established an
[21:45] enclosure. That garden, this enclosure,
[21:47] he planted a garden. And as he plants
[21:49] this garden, he puts the man who came
[21:52] from the soil. He puts him in that
[21:55] garden. And having put him in that
[21:57] garden, it hearkens back to the prior
[21:59] verses that said, "Well, the Lord had
[22:01] put all the seeds in the ground, but he
[22:02] had not yet caused them to grow because
[22:04] there was no man there to cultivate and
[22:07] care for the plants." So now that the
[22:09] Lord has planted a garden and he's
[22:12] planted these seeds and a man is there
[22:15] to till the soil, it says, "Out of the
[22:17] ground," verse 9, "Out of the ground
[22:19] made the Lord God to grow every tree
[22:21] that is pleasant to the sight and good
[22:22] for food. And the tree of life also in
[22:25] the midst of the garden, and the tree of
[22:26] knowledge of good and evil. And a river
[22:28] went out of Eden to water the garden. So
[22:30] there's your water. And from thence it
[22:32] parted and became into four heads. That
[22:34] begins to describe these rivers and
[22:36] their extent. So God God is a gardener.
[22:40] Just want to use that phrase.
[22:43] He is a husbandman. That's a scriptural
[22:45] word that we might see. He is himself a
[22:48] dresser and a keeper of his garden or
[22:50] his vineyard. The Bible says the Lord
[22:52] God planted a garden. Isn't it wonderful
[22:55] to know that those of us who have
[22:56] gardens, we're in the image of God when
[22:58] we plant gardens. I know some of you who
[23:01] aren't green thumbs and you kill even
[23:03] the fake plants that you buy from IKEA
[23:06] and you have a complex, but there is
[23:07] something in the nature of God to be
[23:08] able to care for a plant.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; And so God is a gardener, but it says he
[23:14] made man from the ground and placed him
[23:17] in this garden. But notice how this is
[23:19] in the image of God in Isaiah chapters
[23:21] 27:es
[23:23] 1-6. In that day the Lord will with his
[23:26] sword and great and strong sword shall
[23:28] punish Leviathan the piercing serpent
[23:30] even Leviathan that crooked serpent and
[23:32] he shall slay the dragon that is in the
[23:34] sea. This is why I tell people and they
[23:36] say how can you believe this or that? I
[23:38] said I believe in a Bible of dragons and
[23:40] Leviathans. I believe this to be true.
[23:44] In the second verse it says, "In that
[23:46] day, sing ye unto her a vineyard of red
[23:49] wine. I will sow her unto me in the
[23:52] earth." He says in Hosea, God has
[23:54] planted seeds in the earth. And God had
[23:56] not brought them forth yet even in the
[23:58] garden. But then there's also this
[24:00] pointing to God's planting a vineyard of
[24:03] red wine. Notice verse three. I the Lord
[24:06] do keep it. I will water it every
[24:09] morning, every moment. Lest any hurt it,
[24:13] I will keep it night and day.
[24:16] This is why we ask people to water our
[24:18] plants when we go on vacation. They need
[24:20] to be cared for.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; That's why you have to know what kind of
[24:24] sunlight they like.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Can they exist in certain can they exist
[24:28] in certain climates? Can they grow in
[24:30] certain soil? There's thought given to
[24:32] this. And he says, I will keep it. I
[24:34] will water it every moment. And I think
[24:36] that means at the appropriate times. You
[24:38] don't want to overwater your plants.
[24:40] Lest any heard it, I will keep it. I
[24:42] will keep it night and day. He says,
[24:44] "Fury is not in me. Who would set the
[24:46] briars and thorns against me in battle?
[24:49] I would go through them. I would burn
[24:50] them together." So now he's zealous over
[24:52] this planting that there would be
[24:54] nothing else that would compete with its
[24:55] life. That nothing else would hinder its
[24:58] growth. Oh, let him take hold of my
[25:00] strength that he may make peace with me
[25:02] and shall make peace with me. He shall
[25:04] cause them that come of Jacob to take
[25:06] root. Israel shall blossom and bud and
[25:10] fill the face of the world with fruit.
[25:14] These scriptures are speaking to the
[25:15] character and nature of God. But it's
[25:18] using terminology that we could relate
[25:20] to as human beings, whether it be those
[25:22] who have green thumbs or plant gardens
[25:23] or have just experienced the fruits of
[25:25] those things. God expresses the
[25:27] character and conduct of a true
[25:29] husbandman,
[25:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[25:30] &gt;&gt; A true keeper of the vineyard, a true
[25:33] gardener, one that plants seed and is
[25:35] concerned. And he says it keeps and
[25:37] watches guard over and observes. He
[25:39] says, "I will keep it. I will observe.
[25:40] I'll watch. I'll see if it's needy. I
[25:42] will water, which is to nourish or cause
[25:44] it to drink water." These are things
[25:46] that the plant can't do in and of
[25:48] itself.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; And he does so keeping this care over
[25:52] it. As the Bible says, it shall blossom
[25:54] and bud till the face of the earth of
[25:56] the world is filled with fruit, allowing
[25:58] it to blossom, bud, and fill the world
[26:00] with fruit. That's the nature of God as
[26:04] a gardener. This is what God the
[26:07] scriptures express of what one who has
[26:09] responsibility over a planting this is
[26:12] this is what their vision is that
[26:13] they're going to keep water so it
[26:16] blossoms buds and becomes fruitful.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 2
[26:23] 15 to1 17 it continues and it said the
[26:26] Lord God took the man and put him in the
[26:29] garden of Eden to dress it and keep it.
[26:31] Why was man in the garden? We we could
[26:33] say, well, man was in the garden just to
[26:35] live out perfection and to have fun and
[26:37] enjoy and and just eat all the fruits of
[26:39] the tree. But the Bible says that he is
[26:42] there to dress and keep this garden that
[26:45] God planted.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; So now he is even seen as this steward
[26:49] or even a keeper of God's vineyard or
[26:52] God's planting.
[26:54] God places the man in this enclosure in
[26:56] the garden with responsibility to dress,
[26:58] to watch over, to guard, to observe, to
[27:00] keep.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. It's going to be a responsibility
[27:04] himself as a gardener.
[27:06] And he commands, the Lord God commanded
[27:08] the man, saying, "Of every tree of the
[27:09] garden, thou mayest freely eat because
[27:11] the trees that grew out of the ground,
[27:13] they were good for food. But of the tree
[27:16] of the knowledge of good and evil, thou
[27:17] shalt not eat of it. For in the day that
[27:19] thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely
[27:20] die."
[27:22] &gt;&gt; So now there's that prescription, that
[27:24] prohibition
[27:25] that is what gives him true liberty.
[27:28] So, Adam is placed in the garden to be a
[27:31] gardener,
[27:33] to till the soil, to labor over the
[27:36] planting.
[27:38] These were going to be these were things
[27:40] that needed attention. You couldn't just
[27:43] say, "Oh, well, God planted the seed.
[27:45] Whatever s's going to come up, whatever
[27:48] God wills and whatever God predestinates
[27:50] and whatever happens happens." But there
[27:52] was a responsibility. Adam and the woman
[27:54] were called to care for, cultivate and
[27:58] look after that which God had planted in
[28:00] the earth. Notice in Genesis chapter
[28:03] 1:es 27 to 29. So God created man in his
[28:06] own image. In the image of God created
[28:09] he him. Male and female created he them.
[28:14] It says and God blessed them and said
[28:16] unto them, be fruitful and multiply and
[28:20] replenish the earth. This speaks to them
[28:22] in their personal responsibility to have
[28:24] children that they were to be fruitful
[28:27] themselves that they were to multiply
[28:28] and replenish the earth means fill it up
[28:30] to what I've predestinated what I've
[28:32] desired to see of my seed after me. And
[28:34] this is and subdue it. So there is not
[28:37] only this personal responsibility for
[28:39] them to be fruitful to the extent that
[28:41] God has ordained it, but then to also
[28:43] subdue the earth. There is a subduing of
[28:45] the earth, this responsibility that they
[28:47] have, and it extended over to living
[28:49] things, and have dominion over the fish
[28:50] of the sea, and over the fowl of the
[28:52] air, and over every living thing that
[28:53] moveth upon the earth. And God said,
[28:55] "Behold, I've given you every
[28:57] herbbearing seed, which is upon the face
[28:59] of all the earth, and every tree which
[29:02] is in the every tree into which is the
[29:05] fruit of a tree yielding seed, to you it
[29:08] shall be for meat."
[29:10] Now, what I'd like you to catch from
[29:12] this, and we're making really good time
[29:13] here, so you're going to beat all the
[29:15] crowds to In-N-Out.
[29:17] The the principle of God having put the
[29:20] seeds there now placed man with the
[29:23] responsibility over it, and now man can
[29:26] enjoy the fruits of the planting and the
[29:29] labor, and he can enjoy the fruits of
[29:30] his labor. That man was to be a subduer
[29:34] of the earth. He was to be a tiller of
[29:37] the ground and the soil. He was to watch
[29:39] out over it. And in watching out over,
[29:41] he says, you can have the herb. You can
[29:44] have the fruit. You can enjoy these
[29:46] things for you. It will be your meat.
[29:48] Meats are for the belly and belly for
[29:49] meats. That's there for you as
[29:51] provision.
[29:54] Now, he prescribed them to eat of every
[29:57] tree that grew from the ground. But then
[29:58] he prohibited them from eating of the
[30:00] tree of knowledge and good and evil.
[30:07] And it the sin symbolically written as
[30:11] it's represented symbolically in the
[30:12] scripture. Adam's sin was directly
[30:14] connected with failing to honor this
[30:17] responsibility as a keeper
[30:19] to honor the seed to honor the planting
[30:23] to honor the fruit.
[30:25] So in Genesis 3:es 20-23
[30:29] this is after the fall this is after
[30:33] uh the the sin the original sin it says
[30:36] and Adam called his wife's name Eve she
[30:39] is called the mother of all living names
[30:41] her this after the acts involved with
[30:44] the fall there's a very strict reason
[30:45] why the Bible brings that up at this
[30:47] time because she was the mother of all
[30:48] living that's what Eve means unto Adam
[30:50] also and to his wife did the Lord God
[30:52] make coats of skin and clothe them so
[30:54] now man is dressing outwardly over this
[30:57] flesh. The Lord God said, "Behold, the
[30:59] man has become as one of us to know good
[31:01] and evil. And now, lest he put forth his
[31:04] hand and take also of the tree of life
[31:06] and eat and live forever."
[31:10] He's going to guard this way in the
[31:11] preceding verses after verse 23, the uh
[31:15] seraraphims with these flaming swords to
[31:16] keep the way of the tree of life. But so
[31:19] now since he says man has become think
[31:21] of this this becoming in one sense is
[31:24] well it's exactly what the serpent said
[31:26] he would do. You would become as gods.
[31:27] But this is a there's a judgment that
[31:29] follows this. Think of this that man has
[31:32] become as one of us to know good and
[31:34] evil.
[31:36] And so lest he eat of the tree of life
[31:38] and live forever in this fallen state.
[31:40] He says therefore the Lord God sent him
[31:42] forth from the garden of Eden. Here is
[31:44] his banishment. Here is this compounding
[31:46] of his punishment. There's been these
[31:48] curses, but now here comes this
[31:50] banishment, this expungement from
[31:52] expelling from the garden. He sent him
[31:53] forth from the Garden of Eden. Now
[31:55] having been cursed, the ground having
[31:57] been cursed, and the woman having been
[31:59] cursed, and now they're being cast out
[32:00] of the Garden of Eden, what happens to
[32:03] till the ground from whence he was
[32:05] taken. Banishment does not change his
[32:07] gifts.
[32:09] Banishment does not change his calling.
[32:12] He's still gifted. He was still called
[32:14] to till the soil. It was something that
[32:16] he needed to do. And I would say, "What
[32:18] grace God knowing that man would lose
[32:21] his privilege of the garden and
[32:23] everything that God had swn and God had
[32:25] planted in all the water." He made him a
[32:27] tiller of the ground, knowing he would
[32:29] need that gift postfall.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Still gifted and called to dress and
[32:35] keep the field. Yet God acknowledges as
[32:37] you continue to read that there would be
[32:38] a hardship and difficulty of this
[32:40] laboring for bread with the sweat of the
[32:42] brow. You're going to fight with it.
[32:44] You're going to toil. it's not going to
[32:45] yield as easily as it did before.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; And so he begins to foreshadow just how
[32:51] difficult it would be to keep a plant
[32:53] alive.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Just how you'd have to fight with briars
[32:57] and thorns and droughts and fires and
[33:00] winds and all sorts of invaders while
[33:02] you could plant your crops. But who's to
[33:04] say that your extended family isn't
[33:06] going to come and start eating your
[33:07] crops before you have a chance to?
[33:10] So man is still gifted and called to
[33:12] work with the ground and to bring forth
[33:14] the fruits of the ground. But it ain't
[33:16] going to be easy.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; And it's this very circumstance.
[33:22] Believe it is in Ecclesiastes that he
[33:24] says God has made man upright in the
[33:28] beginning. God made the man and the
[33:31] woman upright in the beginning but he
[33:33] pursues and chases after all these other
[33:35] desires.
[33:37] Man has fallen by that desire. And this
[33:39] is what the preacher in Ecclesiastes is
[33:41] wrestling with. This vanity of the labor
[33:44] and the results because man works and he
[33:45] works and he stores and he stores and he
[33:47] has and he has and everything is full.
[33:49] He has all the wisdom. He has all these
[33:50] wines. He has all these things to eat
[33:52] and enjoy. He can have everything he
[33:54] wants. But yet he's not happy.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; And then when he dies, everything he's
[33:58] accumulated is gone
[33:59] &gt;&gt; to him.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; He can't enjoy it. No matter how much
[34:02] they shoved wives and couches and food
[34:05] and the and the supplers and the the
[34:08] pyramids and the burials and the boats
[34:10] and everything they put all these things
[34:11] into, they're still there.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; They've been reduced to some other
[34:15] substance. The dead never enjoyed those
[34:17] things. This is exactly what Solomon is
[34:21] lamenting.
[34:25] As we read in Ecclesiastes 5:9, he says,
[34:28] "Moreover, the profit of the earth is
[34:29] for all. The king himself is served by
[34:32] the field." Rich or poor, you profit
[34:35] from the ground.
[34:41] There was uh we were looking for a place
[34:44] to eat. Reminds me of a time that we
[34:46] were looking for a really good hamburger
[34:47] or something like that and we
[34:48] accidentally went to we didn't really
[34:50] know the language but what we thought
[34:52] was maybe a burger place was actually a
[34:54] vegan restaurant in this language and so
[34:57] it's like they had beyond beef and
[34:59] beyond chicken and I actually think it
[35:01] should be below right like well what
[35:05] vantage I'm looking down that's beyond
[35:07] beef right and so there's a certain way
[35:10] that you look at this so we're kind of
[35:12] excluding maybe these synthetic meats
[35:14] that they can now make without any
[35:16] natural uh sources whatsoever.
[35:19] Wouldn't it be great if when you're
[35:20] hungry there was an app for that, right?
[35:22] And just NFC
[35:24] and I'm full. But there's the profit of
[35:27] the earth that which comes from the
[35:28] ground. Everyone enjoys this. This is
[35:30] what we eat by. This is what we live by.
[35:33] And as man was cast from the garden to
[35:35] till the ground from which he was taken,
[35:37] there's something in man that he now
[35:39] lives by his labor. Whether your labor
[35:42] produces a bartering power or income to
[35:45] purchase meats and those things to eat.
[35:47] This is what man lives by and what he
[35:49] enjoys outwardly. Ecclesiastes chapter 2
[35:52] vers 24. There's nothing better for a
[35:53] man. And he says in the sense that it is
[35:55] good, but then also what else is there
[35:58] than that he should eat and drink and
[36:00] that he should make his soul enjoy good
[36:02] in his labor. This is why I'd say to to
[36:05] young men and young young people that
[36:08] it's important to work and to get uh
[36:12] increase and enjoy the fruits of that
[36:14] labor.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; You can just sit around and laz around
[36:17] and do nothing and just have your
[36:18] parents feed you and clothe you and
[36:20] that's only going to lead to depression.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; It's only going to lead to some um
[36:24] atrophy. There's only going to lead to
[36:26] mental illness and and struggles and
[36:28] toils a and misconceptions and not able
[36:31] to perceive the world correctly because
[36:32] there's nothing better than for you to
[36:34] work and to labor and enjoy those things
[36:36] that you labored for.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't necessarily mean an
[36:40] income, but it can just be a
[36:41] stewardship, a putting the shoulder to
[36:43] the will with your parents and your
[36:44] siblings. And he says, I saw that this
[36:47] was from the hand of God. This is
[36:50] something that God allows and he asked
[36:52] for us to do. You have to the Bible even
[36:54] says a man who doesn't uh provide for
[36:56] his family uh is worse than an infill. A
[36:58] man that doesn't work doesn't eat.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; So this is tied to and connected with a
[37:04] man's ability a person's ability to joy
[37:06] enjoy life. You can't just have any
[37:09] everything handed to you.
[37:12] You can't develop properly unless you're
[37:14] exerting, laboring, producing something,
[37:17] being productive
[37:20] &gt;&gt; and enjoying the good in your labor.
[37:23] Ecclesiastes 3:22 expresses the same.
[37:25] Wherefore I perceive that there's
[37:26] nothing better than that a man should
[37:28] rejoice in his own works, for that is he
[37:31] is his portion.
[37:33] It is a man's portion. And I know this
[37:35] may be making all these these kids here
[37:37] who have these rich parents nervous
[37:39] because it basically says for what shall
[37:41] bring him to see what shall be after
[37:43] him? So in other words, if you have it,
[37:44] use it. What's the point in leaving
[37:46] wealth to your children? Right, brother
[37:48] Preston? Why should I leave anything?
[37:52] The Bible does say a good man leaves a
[37:54] legacy for his grandchildren.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; And and it's a legacy that cannot be
[37:59] stolen, cannot be lost in the stock
[38:00] market,
[38:02] &gt;&gt; cannot corrupt. Right?
[38:03] &gt;&gt; So there is a greater provision that you
[38:06] could be leaving
[38:07] &gt;&gt; than houses and lands.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying this I could say it
[38:12] in such a way to it's applicable.
[38:15] It's applicable even in relevant times.
[38:18] You think about these believers in
[38:20] certain countries whether it be in
[38:22] Eastern Europe and other places where
[38:24] they've worked, they've toiled, they've
[38:26] bought houses, they've bought cars, and
[38:28] then their their land is invaded and
[38:30] they have to leave it all.
[38:32] And and there's there's not even this
[38:35] possibility they'll ever be be able to
[38:36] go back to that house and reclaim it.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Everything they work for is gone. And
[38:41] I'm not trying to cause a red scare here
[38:43] that um everything that you thought,
[38:45] well, I'm going to get my dad's uh lot
[38:47] in this and I'm going to get that in an
[38:48] inheritance. There's things that could
[38:50] happen and all that can be gone.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; And so the Bible is observing, this is
[38:55] exactly what Solomon is observing. He
[38:56] says all this vanity and vexation
[38:58] there's really what man does and what he
[39:01] really truly brings him some sense of
[39:03] satisfaction is he works and he toils
[39:06] and it produces something and he enjoys
[39:08] it.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; This is the call of man.
[39:15] But as I bring this sermon to its
[39:17] closing section, let me say this. We are
[39:19] made in the image of God.
[39:23] We possess a divine calling to care for
[39:25] and to cultivate life.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; This was in the man in the beginning.
[39:32] He was made perfect. The man was made to
[39:35] be a laborer. He was made to be a
[39:37] co-orker with God. He was set to subdue
[39:40] over the earth to subdue the earth. He
[39:41] was put in the garden with the purpose
[39:43] to look after all the original seeds
[39:45] that God had sown.
[39:48] Therefore, it is still in us
[39:51] to be to care for life.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; One of the great travest or one of the
[39:55] great revealers of Cain's wickedness, he
[39:58] says, "Am I my brother's keeper?"
[40:01] It was in the nature of Adam to keep
[40:04] life.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; And Cain works as a hypocrite to one who
[40:09] worked with the ground and the soil to
[40:11] bring forth the fruit of the ground when
[40:13] it really came to the truth of it. Is it
[40:15] really in you, Cain? Do you really care
[40:17] for what you're cultivating? Do you
[40:19] really understand what it is you're
[40:20] producing? He said, "Am I my brother's
[40:22] keeper?" He didn't truly care about the
[40:24] fruits of the ground.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; His heart wasn't connected with that
[40:29] labor.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; And I believe that all mankind have a
[40:33] duty to life.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; That all life is precious and we should
[40:37] have respect for it and we should have
[40:39] and that there's something about life.
[40:41] God is the one that gives breath and we
[40:43] should never trivialize that whether it
[40:44] be our own or somebody else's.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; And so we have this divine calling, if I
[40:51] could say, a talent, a gift that God's
[40:52] given us.
[40:54] Ecclesiastes 3:1, he hath made
[40:57] everything beautiful in his time.
[41:02] God makes everything beautiful.
[41:05] Also, he hath set the world in their
[41:08] heart.
[41:10] God makes everything beautiful and he's
[41:13] placed. He's planted. I know I'm using a
[41:15] phrase that's not evident in this King
[41:16] James translation and and so I'm not
[41:19] trying to attach a meaning to this that
[41:21] you don't see, but he's I want to I want
[41:25] to show this by scripture, too. He's
[41:27] planted eternity in your heart.
[41:31] If God makes everything beautiful in his
[41:33] time, we should be laboring for beauty.
[41:36] We should be striving to make things
[41:38] beautiful.
[41:40] We should not have a casual attitude
[41:43] towards those things that we're
[41:44] creating.
[41:46] We should have an attitude even as we
[41:48] might say that leave leave uh something
[41:51] better than you found it. That shows
[41:54] integrity. That shows character. Th
[41:58] those are the kinds of things that last.
[42:02] While my wife and I were on on vacation
[42:04] recently, I saw a statement by Axel Sto.
[42:07] I don't know if you know him, brother
[42:08] Victor, but he's a renowned uh Danish
[42:10] ceramic artist uh very very famous and
[42:13] he made this statement. He said, "It is
[42:15] more important for an artist to create
[42:17] in the spirit of nature rather than to
[42:20] imitate its external appearance."
[42:23] You can there can be this external
[42:26] appearance. To me, this is what
[42:28] artificial intelligence produces. It
[42:30] gives you the facade of creativity
[42:33] &gt;&gt; but it has not actually gone through the
[42:35] process of human creativity.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; It has digested all the external
[42:39] appearances. Therefore, it can replicate
[42:42] a faximile of the creative process. But
[42:46] artificial intelligence cannot create
[42:48] art truly
[42:49] &gt;&gt; because all those things that an artist
[42:51] goes through to create something
[42:54] and to produce an image is is absent
[42:57] from that that shallow process. It's not
[43:00] beyond art. It's below art.
[43:03] And this statement so struck me. It is
[43:06] more important to create in the spirit
[43:08] of nature. In other words, we should
[43:10] create in God's nature.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; We should nurture with God's nature.
[43:15] Isn't this striking to think that as
[43:17] parents you say well what's the great
[43:19] debate? Is it all nature? Is it nurture?
[43:20] Well, it's both.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; You have received genetically a certain
[43:25] a certain nature which kind of gives
[43:28] this these bounds of what your potential
[43:30] is and then nurture is what's going to
[43:32] allow you to develop within that
[43:35] potentiality.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; So I believe it is nature and nurture
[43:38] with respect to our lives personally,
[43:40] individually and our families and with
[43:41] respect to a lot of things. Oh, the
[43:43] nature of this seed I is is a cactus.
[43:46] Plant it in the ground but don't if it
[43:48] doesn't have the right nurture and
[43:49] environment
[43:51] &gt;&gt; not going to come up.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; And so we are as parents I just say this
[43:55] maybe as parents and maybe you could say
[43:56] think of yourself individually that we
[43:58] are born with the nature of our parents.
[44:00] Our children are born with our nature.
[44:03] How scary would it be if only thing we
[44:05] nurtured them with was with our carnal
[44:07] nature. That's right.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; We want a nature. We want to nurture in
[44:13] the nature of God.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; If we're creators ourselves, if we are
[44:17] artists ourselves, that it's more
[44:18] important that we create in the spirit
[44:20] of God. That we work and labor in the
[44:22] spirit of God and not just be concerned
[44:24] with external appearances. Because our
[44:26] calling is not related to external
[44:29] things. Think about how often we judge
[44:31] one another externally.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; By what someone drives and what someone
[44:36] wears and all these things that are
[44:37] outwards. These are just the carnal
[44:39] aspects of being and becoming. And if we
[44:41] are not if we're not careful, we're not
[44:43] in the nature of it. We're just in the
[44:46] external part of it.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; If I could say this, I'm wanting to just
[44:50] bring this to a close. We're called to
[44:51] serve eternity.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; We're called to serve the eternity
[44:57] that's been planted in you and planted
[44:58] in our children.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; It's a seed of eternity that's been
[45:03] planted in the elect.
[45:05] This original seed. It's the germ of
[45:07] eternity and it needs germination.
[45:11] It's there already.
[45:14] As preachers of the gospel, we're not
[45:15] planting predestinated seed.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; The Bible says you're elect according to
[45:20] the fornowledge of God. According to the
[45:22] word of God, you are elect to a birth.
[45:25] There's something ordained by God that's
[45:27] placed in you. It's that germ of
[45:30] eternity, a seed of eternity. It's an
[45:32] eternal gene that's inside of you. And
[45:34] so the preaching of the gospel is not
[45:35] the planting of seed, but it's the
[45:38] watering of a seed.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; The way that we raise our children, a
[45:42] lot of us, you can't put predestinated
[45:44] seed in your children, but you can keep
[45:45] bad seeds from being swn into their
[45:47] spirit.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; You can't make them elect, but you can
[45:50] care for the garden where God says, "I
[45:52] will burn through briars and thorns."
[45:53] That ought to be the nature we have when
[45:55] it comes to looking after the hearts and
[45:56] the spirit and the nature of our
[45:58] children is. Why would I want to sow
[45:59] briars and thorns
[46:01] &gt;&gt; around this precious seed?
[46:03] It'll come to life, but we can make it a
[46:06] lot harder.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; There's a principle that seed will come
[46:10] up somehow, but there's things that can
[46:12] lay across it, things that can hinder
[46:13] it, and it causes its growth to be
[46:15] deformed.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; The seed having been planted, we see
[46:20] set, he's planted eternity in your
[46:21] heart. Notice how it says in Isaiah
[46:23] chapter 60 verse 21, "Thy people also
[46:25] shall be all righteous. They shall
[46:28] inherit the land forever." He says, 'The
[46:31] branch of my planting, the works of my
[46:33] hands
[46:36] that I may be glorified.
[46:39] God planted the branch. He's planted the
[46:43] seed. He said it will blossom and bud.
[46:46] It will become fruitful.
[46:48] What's this branch of his planting? He
[46:50] says it's going to they're going to
[46:50] inherit the land forever. It's the
[46:52] planting of eternity.
[46:54] The next chapter 61:3 to appoint unto
[46:57] them that mourn in Zion. This relates to
[46:58] his uh uh the second coming as he read
[47:01] to this point stopped to give unto them
[47:04] beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for
[47:05] morning, the garment of praise for the
[47:06] spirit of heaviness so that they because
[47:09] for that they might be called trees of
[47:13] righteousness,
[47:14] the planting of the Lord. You are the
[47:18] planting of the Lord
[47:19] &gt;&gt; that he might be glorified. The bride
[47:22] tree will blossom and bloom. It will
[47:25] bring forth the fruits of the original
[47:27] seed. God's prophesied it will run not
[47:29] turn void. It will not return void. So
[47:32] there is a planting of eternity in your
[47:34] heart
[47:37] and he says that they are going to come
[47:39] forth that he might be glorified. The
[47:42] branch of his planting the work of his
[47:43] hands that he might be glorified. What
[47:45] does this relate to? The product the
[47:47] harvest. Go read John chapter 15 those
[47:50] first dozen verses or so about the vine
[47:52] and the uh and the branches. He says,
[47:55] "Herein is my father glorified in verse
[47:57] 8 that we bear much fruit."
[48:01] &gt;&gt; How is it that God is glorified? When we
[48:05] bear much fruit,
[48:08] so shall you be my disciples.
[48:11] The planting of the Lord, trees of
[48:15] righteousness, the branch of God's
[48:17] planting, the planting of eternity has
[48:19] to bring forth fruit
[48:22] because that's the the the proof of the
[48:24] pudding is in the eating thereof. Wisdom
[48:26] is justified in her children in what it
[48:28] produces,
[48:30] &gt;&gt; and what it brings forth. How is the
[48:32] father glorified? not merely in the
[48:35] planting of seed, but the the growth and
[48:39] the harvest of that which has been
[48:40] planted.
[48:42] So when I say the planting of eternity,
[48:44] I'm not referring so much to the
[48:47] planting of the seed, but the planting,
[48:49] the eternal planting, that which has
[48:52] been planted.
[48:54] In Ecclesiastes 3:es 5-9,
[48:57] we've covered this lately, so I think we
[48:59] have some synergy in looking at this
[49:01] again. Who then is Paul and who is
[49:02] Apollos? but ministers, servants by whom
[49:05] you believed even as the Lord gave to
[49:07] every man. God given gifts to the church
[49:09] that speaking the truth and love, we may
[49:11] what? Grow up.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; God having uh uh looked out over this
[49:16] seed and he says, "I have planted
[49:18] Apollos watered." So he's showing the
[49:20] labor that one does to plant churches,
[49:23] to sew the word of God, to do these
[49:25] things and Apollos waters, but God gave
[49:26] the increase.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, see, neither is he
[49:29] that planteth anything, neither he that
[49:31] waterth, but God that giveth the
[49:32] increase. The planting is the Lord. The
[49:35] watering is the Lord. Because he says,
[49:36] now he that planteth he that wareth are
[49:38] one,
[49:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Part of the same labor.
[49:42] The one that waters waters the seed
[49:44] that's been sown.
[49:46] The w the one that plants is it plants
[49:49] the seed that's been given.
[49:52] Says, "And every man shall receive his
[49:53] own reward according to his own labor."
[49:56] still in the image of Adam
[49:59] to labor over a planting. And he says in
[50:02] verse nine, we are labors together with
[50:05] God.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; I want you to take that personal, not
[50:08] just Paul and Apollos. We are labors
[50:11] together with God. You are a labor in
[50:13] his vineyard. Then he says, you are
[50:16] God's husbandry. You are God's building.
[50:21] We should look at ourselves as the
[50:23] garden
[50:25] that he is cultivating, that he is
[50:27] enriching, that he has planted a seed of
[50:30] eternity within that needs to be
[50:31] germinated, that needs water, that needs
[50:34] light, that needs to be cared for to
[50:37] bring forth fruit because you are God's
[50:40] husbandry. That means God's building.
[50:41] You are the planting of the Lord. You
[50:43] are trees of righteousness that require
[50:46] growth.
[50:48] But then he says, "We are labors
[50:50] together with God." I don't want you
[50:52] just to limit that to Paul and Apollos
[50:55] and the ministers mentioned here in 1
[50:56] Corinthians 3. But you are a servant
[51:01] in the same vineyard,
[51:04] looking after, caring for those things
[51:06] that God has given you.
[51:09] As the musicians come in Psalms chapter
[51:11] 90:1 17,
[51:13] it says this, "And let the beauty of the
[51:16] Lord our God be upon us."
[51:21] Isn't that what we desire? He has made
[51:24] everything beautiful in his time.
[51:28] So if there is eternity planted in my
[51:30] heart, then I want the beauty of the
[51:33] Lord, the beauty of eternity to be upon
[51:35] me.
[51:36] It's not, oh look, I'm beautiful, but
[51:40] it's this longing. Let let the beauty of
[51:42] the Lord, let this this way that God is
[51:45] and his nature, let it be upon me.
[51:49] So the prayer is, and establish thou the
[51:52] work of our hands upon us.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Yay, the work of our hands, establish
[51:58] thou it. What a prayer. Because we have
[52:00] this sacred responsibility to cultivate
[52:02] and protect our God-given talents. We
[52:06] have a a sacred responsibility to look
[52:08] after life.
[52:11] And there is a responsibility to labor
[52:13] in the field that God has given us with
[52:15] the with the vision of a fruitful
[52:17] harvest. Let the beauty of the Lord be
[52:19] upon me.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; I have this responsibility.
[52:23] can't just say, "Well, I was born again,
[52:24] fully adopted on such and such date,
[52:25] such and such time, and now we're just
[52:27] kind of waiting for all these other
[52:27] knuckleheads to get the birth so we can
[52:29] get out of here." But no, I have a
[52:30] responsibility.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm not so much concerned with all
[52:34] the external things of how good we can
[52:37] make our church services, but I really,
[52:39] really want to live a life that's
[52:41] fruitful.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Because listen, think about it. In
[52:46] church, you're just you you're really
[52:47] there as an individual
[52:50] enter looking at the word and hopefully
[52:53] feeding on the word of God
[52:54] &gt;&gt; and and and wrestling it out so that
[52:56] something inside of you is strengthened
[52:58] and encouraged because then when you
[52:59] leave, that's when the real Christianity
[53:00] starts.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; That that's in the nature of the author.
[53:05] That's in the nature of God
[53:06] &gt;&gt; to live an overcoming life. that we're
[53:11] look more to the fruits of our personal
[53:13] lives and our personal callings as
[53:15] opposed to just how rad our church
[53:18] services can be,
[53:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:21] &gt;&gt; And just how much movement we can have
[53:23] and how we can just be so excited on
[53:26] Sunday morning that when we just barely
[53:29] survive the week through all of our
[53:31] habits and nastiness and lies and
[53:34] backslidings, we just can't wait to get
[53:35] to church on Sunday and feel good again.
[53:39] That's not a that's that's a shallow
[53:42] yield.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; We should be laboring in the field that
[53:46] God has placed us in with a vision to
[53:48] the harvest.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; So he says, God establish the work of
[53:52] our hands, the work of your hands. He
[53:55] has made everything beautiful in his
[53:57] time, but now it's the work of our
[53:59] hands. God give the increase to our work
[54:01] as laborers together with you in your
[54:04] vineyard.
[54:06] give the increase to the planting of
[54:08] eternity in my life and in my family.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; I think this is a very important and if
[54:15] you think I'm overestimating it, that's
[54:16] fine.
[54:18] I no offense, but to me, I began to feel
[54:21] in my heart over the past week, this may
[54:22] be one of the most important things I've
[54:23] ever preached, the planting of eternity.
[54:27] We have a responsibility over the
[54:30] planting, the tree, the life, the seed
[54:34] of eternity that is in each one of us.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Is not my life a reflection of what is
[54:39] on the inside of me?
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Can I not say and do things that might
[54:43] not accurately depict the grace and
[54:45] humility that is in eternity?
[54:48] Is there a way that I can live which is
[54:50] much below the power and the potential
[54:52] of the planting of eternity that is in
[54:54] my life
[54:56] and maybe more uh to to a greater
[55:00] detriment? Could I be mistreating you
[55:04] because I don't regard the eternity
[55:05] that's been planted in your heart?
[55:08] Could I be so focused on the external
[55:10] things and the outward appearance of
[55:11] things that I haven't taken time to look
[55:14] after the soul and the planting of
[55:16] eternity in my children's heart and ask
[55:18] myself what's nourishing that?
[55:21] [Music]
[55:23] What what is ministering to their
[55:24] spirits?
[55:27] Now you think about that.
[55:30] You feed them every day. You clothe them
[55:33] and that's meats for the belly and the
[55:35] belly for meats. What's going into their
[55:37] minds?
[55:39] What's going into their hearts? How much
[55:42] of it is the Tik Toks and the Instagram
[55:44] reels and all the things that they see
[55:45] and the shorts and all the social media
[55:47] and all the movies and music and
[55:49] entertainment. All those things are
[55:51] feeding their spirit.
[55:53] And you're like, well, they have a roof
[55:55] over their head and I buy them clothes
[55:57] and I feed them and I let them do all
[56:00] this, but they're not happy or they're
[56:01] not satisfied. They don't have good
[56:02] temperaments.
[56:04] It's because you're not giving them
[56:05] things that really satisfy.
[56:08] Try it. Try to bring the word of God
[56:10] into your home. Bring prayer into your
[56:13] home. Bring devotions into your home.
[56:15] Start feeding on the things that satisfy
[56:17] the soul. And you watch. It's thus
[56:19] sayeth the Lord. Things change
[56:21] because now the planting of eternity
[56:24] begins to take preeminence. And so,
[56:27] never forget that there's a tree of
[56:28] righteousness in you and in your
[56:30] children and in your home. and that has
[56:32] to be cared for.
[56:35] God, help us in this responsibility
[56:38] of the planting of eternity. Let's stand
[56:41] together.
[56:43] Let's pray together. Maybe you could
[56:45] say, we could all pray as a prayer
[56:47] today. Establish thou the work of our
[56:50] hands upon us. Notice, let the beauty of
[56:54] the Lord our God be upon us. Establish
[56:56] thou the work of our hands upon us.
[56:58] That's where the beauty of the Lord's
[56:59] going to come from. the work of our
[57:01] hands. Establish it just as you
[57:04] established a garden in Eden. Lord,
[57:06] bring forth your beauty in our lives.
[57:08] Let that be our prayer today. Our
[57:09] gracious heavenly father, Lord, as we've
[57:11] shared these very simple principles and
[57:13] repetitive with a lot of themes that
[57:15] have been used over the last several
[57:16] years, I find that there is a a cycle
[57:21] of revisiting these very strong
[57:23] principles and these themes because we
[57:26] must take
[57:29] account and reckoning of the field as we
[57:31] enter into this harvest time. We enter
[57:33] into this fall season, this autumn
[57:34] season, and oh, just how we love going
[57:36] out and just picking out the perfect
[57:38] heirloom pumpkins and getting all the
[57:40] wreaths out and the wheat and all the
[57:42] things that relate to the fall and the
[57:43] harvest and decorating our homes with it
[57:45] and the pumpkin spice lattes, Lord, that
[57:47] we'll just enjoy for the next few
[57:49] months. Lord, there's a sense of fall
[57:52] and harvest and all that it comes with.
[57:53] Lord, shouldn't we take a stop, a moment
[57:55] to stop and say, "Wow, if this is the
[57:57] external vanity
[58:00] that Solomon was talking about, what
[58:03] about the real planting and harvest that
[58:06] he pointed to? What about the harvest in
[58:09] our lives of all the seeds that we've
[58:10] been sewing all year?" We could look at
[58:12] families who backslide or we could look
[58:14] at individuals that go through hard
[58:15] things and surely, Lord, they could take
[58:17] a look at their life and say, "Wow, I
[58:19] haven't been planting for a spiritual
[58:21] harvest.
[58:22] I've been sowing to the wind and I'm
[58:23] reaping the world and I've sowed to the
[58:25] flesh and I'm reaping corruption. That's
[58:26] why my faith has failed.
[58:29] That's why I found myself horrified and
[58:31] without a place to stand in a moment of
[58:32] temptation.
[58:34] Oh God, I pray that you would inspire us
[58:37] to be better dressers and keepers of
[58:39] this vineyard.
[58:41] Lord, give me leadership and wisdom as a
[58:43] pastor how to explore this theme
[58:44] scripturally and through the message of
[58:46] the hour so that we could be rooted and
[58:48] grounded in the proper things that we
[58:49] could take this discernment we have by
[58:51] the word and find this right balance of
[58:54] sewing and reaping.
[58:57] Bless all that are here today. Lord,
[59:00] may their homes be strengthened by their
[59:02] determination
[59:04] to let the beauty of the Lord be upon
[59:05] them. May their marriages be
[59:07] strengthened by this determination to
[59:09] not try to have good Instagram pictures
[59:11] but by have real true interaction
[59:13] according to your nature that our
[59:16] marriages could be stronger.
[59:18] Lord let us not be afraid of how our
[59:21] children would respond
[59:23] to speaking to their souls and
[59:25] nourishing their souls for Lord that is
[59:27] a worthy endeavor.
[59:30] Lord, we could approach it by stripping
[59:32] them bare
[59:34] of all worldly comforts and all natural
[59:36] enjoyments and put such parameters upon
[59:38] them to where they find themselves in
[59:39] deep despondency, having been deprived
[59:41] of all these things that youth enjoy by
[59:44] nature and instinct of the flesh.
[59:47] And we'll be no closer to finding you if
[59:50] we don't speak to the eternity that's in
[59:53] them.
[59:55] Better is the sight of the eyes. Better
[59:56] is it then for them to see the nature of
[59:59] the true gardener, see the nature of
[1:00:01] Christ in us
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; than to fight the wandering of desire.
[1:00:06] Help us, Lord, to be those
[1:00:09] keepers and co-abors together with you
[1:00:11] in your nature according to your vision
[1:00:14] that we might see a fruitful harvest and
[1:00:16] you thereby be glorified. We ask this in
[1:00:19] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
