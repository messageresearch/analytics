[0:01] amen if you could take your bibles i'd
[0:03] like to read in luke chapter 10
[0:05] and we have been reading from that
[0:08] already through the last few services
[0:10] and i'd like to continue
[0:12] on the subject of who is my neighbor
[0:15] and we're drawing it from the question
[0:18] that is asked
[0:19] in verse 29 after
[0:22] the this lawyer had basically said that
[0:25] uh
[0:26] you know to love thy god with all thy
[0:27] heart and to love thy neighbor as
[0:29] thyself
[0:30] was what the law spoke to would be in
[0:33] terms of eternal life so then this is
[0:34] the part where
[0:36] that is the answer to the question i
[0:38] want to start with verse 30 as the
[0:39] question has been who is my neighbor and
[0:41] it says in jesus answering said
[0:43] luke chapter 10 verse 30 we'll read to
[0:45] verse 32
[0:46] a certain man went down from jerusalem
[0:49] to jericho
[0:50] and fell among thieves which stripped
[0:52] him of his raiment
[0:53] and wounded him and departed leaving him
[0:56] half
[0:57] dead and by chance there came down a
[0:59] certain priest that way
[1:01] and when he saw him he passed by on the
[1:03] other side
[1:05] and likewise a levite when he was at the
[1:07] place
[1:08] came and looked on him he drew drew
[1:10] closer to him and stood over
[1:12] him and looked on him and it just seems
[1:13] to kind of aggravate the passage a
[1:15] little bit
[1:16] and pass by on the other side
[1:19] you could take your seats this evening
[1:22] we do want to commend you for your
[1:24] sacrifice to be here
[1:26] and the wonderful spirit that you're
[1:28] able to create
[1:29] create the atmosphere that you're able
[1:31] to create and welcoming the holy spirit
[1:33] and
[1:33] we're so glad to see all of you here we
[1:35] appreciate you very much
[1:37] i just got to jump right into it the
[1:38] good this parable of the good samaritan
[1:41] is an answer to the question who is my
[1:44] neighbor
[1:45] and in doing so jesus is rejecting the
[1:48] lawyer's
[1:48] assertion that only the jews were his
[1:51] neighbor
[1:52] because he supposed that if uh if loving
[1:54] a jew
[1:55] satisfies the commandment as loving the
[1:57] neighbor as thyself
[1:58] then he would say i'm blameless in the
[2:00] law then i have inherited eternal life
[2:03] but it's important i think this commits
[2:05] uh
[2:06] this parable speaks to us in so many
[2:09] different ways that
[2:10] our neighbors just not those who live
[2:12] next door to us our neighbors just not
[2:14] those that agree with us
[2:15] it's not just our family member it's not
[2:17] just message believers or people who
[2:18] believe the message
[2:19] exactly like you do but it extends to
[2:21] all mankind and all humanity
[2:23] and we were looking at this and
[2:25] considering this answer to the question
[2:28] who is my neighbor especially
[2:29] in light of the great commission to
[2:31] spread the gospel
[2:33] and it's important for us to consider
[2:35] who is my neighbor and what the answer
[2:37] is to that
[2:38] if we're going to fulfill the commission
[2:39] as to how does we spread the gospel
[2:41] or fulfilling the commission of
[2:43] spreading the gospel and then
[2:45] even how our actions impact that and we
[2:48] thought about it if
[2:49] someone was wanting to convert to
[2:50] heathen or reprobate a jew was wanting
[2:52] to bring somebody
[2:54] to believe the judaic faith but they
[2:56] were always mistreating them always
[2:57] oppressing them always offending them
[2:59] and then they began to talk about a one
[3:01] true god who required a particular way
[3:03] of worship
[3:04] and wanted to to make a convert or a
[3:06] proselyte to the jewish faith
[3:08] then they say man you're always busting
[3:09] my chops you're always being rude to me
[3:11] you're always mean you're always
[3:12] why would i want to join in in your
[3:14] religion why would i want to believe
[3:16] what you believe it's only made you
[3:17] angry
[3:18] and made you critical and so our actions
[3:20] and our attitude towards others
[3:22] impacts our ability to fulfill the
[3:24] commission
[3:25] which in mark chapter 16 verse 15 it
[3:27] says he said unto them go ye into all
[3:30] the world
[3:30] and preach the gospel to every creature
[3:33] so we have a commission
[3:35] each of us as individuals to spread the
[3:37] gospel to spread the light to be an
[3:39] example
[3:40] and to minister the word of god and in
[3:42] doing so that others might see the light
[3:44] others might be drawn
[3:46] to the truth and be converted to the
[3:48] truth
[3:49] in romans chapter 1 verses 14 to 16
[3:53] paul says i am a debtor both to the
[3:55] greeks and to the barbarians that
[3:57] would be a a crude race of people
[4:00] they're very rude and very harsh
[4:01] he says i'm a debtor to the greeks and
[4:03] the barbarians in other words i'm bound
[4:04] to them
[4:05] i have an obligation to them by my
[4:07] commission i'm called to them so i'm
[4:09] bound to them i'm not choosing
[4:11] who i would preach to and who i wouldn't
[4:13] i'm not choosing who's worthy of it and
[4:14] who's not
[4:15] but i'm bound to greeks and barbarians
[4:18] both to the wise and to the unwise
[4:20] so as much as is in me as in me is
[4:23] i am ready to preach the gospel to you
[4:25] that are at rome also
[4:27] for i am not ashamed of the gospel of
[4:30] christ
[4:30] for it is the power of god unto
[4:32] salvation to everyone that believeth
[4:34] to the jew first and also to the greek
[4:41] paul sets this forth to say i'm not
[4:42] discriminating
[4:44] in terms of who i share the gospel with
[4:47] that i'm bound to greeks i'm bound to
[4:49] barbarians to the wise and the unwise
[4:51] and
[4:51] i'm ready to come and preach the gospel
[4:52] to you in rome he says i'm not ashamed
[4:54] of the gospel of christ it is the power
[4:56] of god to everyone who believeth not
[4:58] just the jew but also the gentiles
[5:01] and so this is paul showing that his
[5:04] view his worldview
[5:05] the expanse of who he could minister to
[5:07] wasn't limited to those that he and his
[5:10] mind felt were the most qualified
[5:12] or the ones that he was most comfortable
[5:14] in ministering to but rather he was
[5:15] bound by his commission to preach the
[5:17] gospel to every creature
[5:20] and as i mentioned a moment ago it's
[5:22] important for us to consider
[5:23] how that our actions and our attitudes
[5:25] impact our ability to be a witness and
[5:27] our ability to help somebody
[5:30] in first timothy chapter 4 verse 12 he
[5:32] says let no man despise
[5:34] thy youth it struck me a little bit
[5:36] different way
[5:37] today that this is a very very young
[5:40] church a very young assembly
[5:42] uh having just started and and let no
[5:44] man despise that
[5:46] no let no man despise a new thing don't
[5:48] let someone despise
[5:50] uh even the smallness of it because
[5:52] we're living in a time
[5:53] where it says it should be it's a it's a
[5:54] day of small things it's a day when
[5:56] god's not doing great big works and
[5:58] souls are being harvested by the
[6:00] thousands
[6:01] but this is this don't despise the day
[6:03] of small things this is a time
[6:04] when god is refining his bride for a
[6:07] rapture and as he refines us we're more
[6:09] active in the things of christ we're
[6:11] we're better able to witness and to
[6:12] share the love of christ
[6:14] so it says let no man despise thy youth
[6:16] but be thou
[6:17] an example of the believers so though
[6:20] you would be despised
[6:21] don't let the despising impair your
[6:24] ability to minister the word of god to
[6:26] spread the truth as he's speaking to
[6:27] timothy
[6:28] he says now the anecdote to that is be
[6:30] an example
[6:32] someone despises you if someone
[6:34] criticizes you if someone's hard on you
[6:36] if someone wants to bring a bad name
[6:38] upon you just conduct yourself above it
[6:40] and be an
[6:41] example of the believers that's the
[6:43] answer to someone who despise you
[6:46] be thou an example of the believers in
[6:48] word in conversation in charity and
[6:50] spirit in faith
[6:51] impurity so we must be examples of
[6:55] believers examples of the word that has
[6:57] been sent in this hour
[6:58] and it's in the things we say here when
[7:00] it speaks of conversation
[7:02] it's your manner of living the way that
[7:03] you conduct yourself in charity and
[7:05] spirit in faith and purity
[7:07] we are commissioned we are called to be
[7:09] an example of the word of god
[7:12] so our attitude towards people the way
[7:13] we treat people even how we would answer
[7:15] this question
[7:16] who is my neighbor is going to be an
[7:18] example
[7:19] of the believers now i'm wanting to
[7:23] by god's help go further in this parable
[7:26] as we've kind of been ministering around
[7:28] it on the front end and on the back end
[7:29] and maybe not get it into the specifics
[7:31] but tonight we want to start looking at
[7:33] some of the specific elements
[7:35] in the parable and explore the
[7:37] relationship among the characters that
[7:39] appear
[7:40] in this parable because there's more to
[7:42] examine than just the relationship
[7:44] between the victim
[7:45] and the samaritan there's more to look
[7:49] at and jesus uses
[7:50] languages very specific and examples and
[7:53] characters that would have got
[7:54] the people's attention in every
[7:56] circumstance in this
[7:58] parable is full of significance to those
[8:00] who heard it
[8:01] as jesus was near bethany even very near
[8:03] where this pathway may have been
[8:05] and there's a lot of significance and
[8:07] symbolism in that road and
[8:08] and different characters people would
[8:10] have known that would have traveled that
[8:12] way so every circumstance that jesus
[8:14] uses
[8:15] in this story has significance to those
[8:17] that he's speaking to
[8:19] and what i want you to do is instead of
[8:22] trying to
[8:23] time travel back to the days of jesus
[8:25] because that's impossible
[8:27] i want you just to make personal
[8:29] application of this for yourself
[8:31] and think well i want to put myself in
[8:33] the shoes of each one of these people
[8:35] because as we have read it already i'll
[8:37] just try to use some summary
[8:39] language here for time's sake but these
[8:41] are the characters that jesus refers to
[8:44] the individuals
[8:45] that uh that come up in this parable a
[8:48] certain man going down
[8:49] from jerusalem to jericho then you have
[8:52] thieves
[8:53] you have a certain priest you have a
[8:55] levite
[8:56] then you have a samaritan and you have a
[8:58] host
[8:59] and these are all the the characters and
[9:02] the groups of people that are mentioned
[9:04] in this story is a man who's going down
[9:06] from jerusalem to jericho
[9:08] you have a group of thieves then you
[9:09] have a priest then you have a levite
[9:11] the samaritan who's who is the good
[9:14] samaritan the one that
[9:15] the lawyer even says well that's the one
[9:17] who was neighbor to the one who was
[9:19] offended
[9:19] and then you even had the host of the
[9:21] inn who would have been there to take
[9:22] care of the one that was wounded
[9:24] once the samaritan left i wanted i want
[9:27] to start tonight well maybe just get
[9:28] through a couple of these characters
[9:30] and just look at each one and how we can
[9:33] relate to them
[9:34] and have personal application this the
[9:37] first one i want to look at is a certain
[9:39] man
[9:40] going down from jerusalem to jericho so
[9:43] jesus is referring to
[9:44] a notoriously dangerous path it's
[9:46] actually was called at that time
[9:48] the bloody way and we know from
[9:50] different teachings maybe even even
[9:52] sunday school
[9:53] that it was uh treacherous because there
[9:55] was thieves there were those that laid
[9:57] in weight and they
[9:58] had different bins and rocky curves and
[10:00] things that would have made it easy
[10:01] for people to prey on the helpless and
[10:04] so when jesus talks about this
[10:06] those who lived then would have
[10:08] immediately begin to think
[10:09] of all the different ways that this was
[10:11] a dangerous journey
[10:13] and then as it says a certain man and we
[10:16] understand
[10:17] what befalls him he can represent all
[10:19] mankind
[10:20] that has fallen in adam because in adam
[10:23] the bible tells us for as an adam
[10:25] all die and we know that through one
[10:27] man's sin
[10:28] entered into the world so in adam we
[10:30] have our representation
[10:32] in death and the journey of adam from a
[10:35] perfect
[10:35] garden in eden to a cursed earth can be
[10:38] seen
[10:39] in this man's path from jerusalem to
[10:41] jericho
[10:42] and jerusalem means peace it was a place
[10:45] of god's temple it was a place of the
[10:47] worship of the one true god it was
[10:49] beautifully situated and placed in the
[10:51] mountains and so this was the holy city
[10:54] this was the beautiful city this was a
[10:56] uh the place of peace and god's peace
[10:58] and then jericho even in christ's time
[11:00] was referred to as a
[11:02] cursed city it was regardless regarded
[11:04] as a wicked place
[11:06] so the journey of this man from a place
[11:07] of peace and beauty
[11:09] to jericho wicked place mankind could be
[11:12] included in this image that's
[11:14] brought up in this in this story and in
[11:16] that we can all identify with a certain
[11:18] man from jerusalem
[11:20] because the bible tells us that all have
[11:22] sinned and come short of the glory of
[11:24] god
[11:24] we weren't born in jerusalem we weren't
[11:27] born in the garden of eden but yet we
[11:28] find
[11:29] ourselves being born in a jericho as a
[11:31] fallen creature as a sinful man
[11:33] and so in that sense we can identify
[11:35] with this certain man
[11:36] who's on his path from jerusalem to
[11:38] jericho
[11:40] and then brother branham looks at this
[11:42] scripture
[11:43] in a little bit different sense and i
[11:45] think this is such a beautiful way that
[11:47] he places this and i'm going to read
[11:48] from three different places
[11:50] where he refers to this story he says
[11:53] jerusalem
[11:53] sets on a hill jericho sets in the
[11:56] valley
[11:57] and the good samaritan found a man
[11:59] coming from jerusalem down to jericho
[12:01] when he fell among thieves he says think
[12:03] of it he was backsliding
[12:06] so now he characterizes a certain man as
[12:08] backsliding
[12:09] coming from heavenly to the curse from
[12:11] the heavenly to the curse
[12:13] jericho was a cursed city jerusalem is a
[12:15] blessed city
[12:17] and he was on his road backsliding when
[12:19] he fell among thieves and robbers
[12:22] that stripped him and that's when you
[12:24] fall among thieves and robbers
[12:26] when you start backsliding away from god
[12:28] just expect the enemy to be along the
[12:31] road
[12:32] so that's a good way of placing this
[12:34] that if you begin to backslide and
[12:36] you're on your way from a place of
[12:37] blessing
[12:38] and a place of beauty on your way to a
[12:40] cursed city of jericho
[12:41] that's when you can expect to be taken
[12:43] advantage of that's when you can expect
[12:44] to be harmed
[12:45] and find yourselves stripped and fall
[12:48] among thieves and robbers so he's just
[12:49] he's kind of using in that way
[12:51] of warning and telling people that
[12:52] you're in a dangerous place
[12:54] when you're backsliding he says that
[12:56] again jericho is in the valley
[12:58] jerusalem is on the hill is did brother
[13:00] branham
[13:01] called tucson jerusalem and phoenix
[13:03] phoenix jericho is that how he referred
[13:05] to it
[13:06] oh well
[13:11] so he says jericho's in the valley
[13:12] jerusalem's on the hill
[13:14] and a man like we read of the good
[13:16] samaritan when he was coming down from
[13:18] jerusalem going to jericho
[13:20] he was backsliding coming out of the
[13:22] city of the blessed
[13:23] going down to the city of the cursed and
[13:26] that's when he fell among
[13:27] thieves and got stripped and wounded and
[13:29] laying half dead
[13:30] spiritually dead physically alive and
[13:34] that beautiful how a prophet takes this
[13:36] half dead and he says physically he's
[13:38] alive but spiritually he's dead
[13:41] and i imagine some of us can relate to
[13:43] that well we're just as healthy as we've
[13:45] ever been and physically we're alive
[13:47] but we feel a deadness spiritually and
[13:49] and this is the characterization of this
[13:51] one who's backsliding
[13:52] he may be physically alive but he's
[13:54] spiritually dead
[13:56] that's a and he takes that half dead to
[13:58] mean not that he's
[13:59] uh he's using that as a type that he's
[14:01] about to take his last
[14:02] last breath physically but he's pointing
[14:04] out in a spiritual sense
[14:06] you could be half dead spiritually dead
[14:08] and physically alive
[14:10] he says in another place too from
[14:12] jerusalem to jericho it showed he was
[14:14] backsliding
[14:15] he was going from up high going down low
[14:18] he was backsliding and he met him on the
[14:20] road
[14:20] and an enemy had beaten him and robbed
[14:22] him and left him half dead
[14:23] and he says it again physically alive
[14:26] spiritually dead
[14:27] so this is the way that brother branham
[14:29] identifies a type
[14:31] of this certain man going down from
[14:33] jerusalem to jericho
[14:34] he's saying this is one who would have
[14:36] had a spiritual experience or
[14:38] would have had a walk with god or some
[14:40] some sense of the divine and was in
[14:42] heavenly places and
[14:44] in a blessed position but then through
[14:46] circumstance he finds himself
[14:48] backslidden
[14:49] and he says physically alive but
[14:50] spiritually dead
[14:52] and it's in this sense that we don't
[14:54] want to be this man
[14:56] we could relate to him if we look at it
[14:57] in the sense of it represents humanity
[14:59] who's born in sin
[15:00] and we've all sinned and fallen short of
[15:02] the glory of god and president
[15:04] adam all men die and we could relate to
[15:07] that man in that sense
[15:08] but in the sense of being a backslider
[15:10] we don't want to be this man
[15:13] that being said we can still relate to
[15:14] this condition
[15:16] we can understand it brother branham
[15:19] calls him backslid that means in the
[15:21] scripture means back turning or to turn
[15:23] back or to turn away
[15:24] means to be turned and now when you look
[15:27] at what the word means in the old
[15:28] testament it means to be
[15:30] turned or driven back it means to be
[15:33] repulsed
[15:34] so in one sense if you say it means to
[15:38] turn back
[15:39] then one of their own volition of their
[15:41] own choosing of their own
[15:43] influence they decide to turn away and
[15:46] and turn back
[15:47] and that's backsliding but it can also
[15:49] mean to be driven back
[15:51] it can also mean to be repulsed so that
[15:54] it's not just
[15:55] you of your own accord in your own
[15:57] decision
[15:58] choosing to walk away or to go from
[16:00] jerusalem to jericho but it means
[16:02] something has acted upon you and caused
[16:05] you to be repulsed
[16:07] something in the name of jerusalem
[16:09] something in your experience something
[16:10] in
[16:11] a teaching something in your personal
[16:12] relationships something in life
[16:15] has war on you and cause you to be
[16:18] driven back
[16:19] and causes you to be repulsed so it's
[16:21] not always somebody who's just thumbing
[16:22] their nose at the message and
[16:24] someone thumbing their nose at holiness
[16:25] and someone's saying well that bible's
[16:27] just a bunch of tommy ron
[16:28] sometimes they're repulsed
[16:31] sometimes they're driven away sometimes
[16:33] they're stabbed and beaten
[16:35] and they're caused to fall away and
[16:37] backsliding is often misunderstood
[16:40] because you see a backslider and
[16:41] immediately you just put all the blame
[16:43] on them you just immediately castigate
[16:44] them and you cast them as dogs and you
[16:46] and you mistreat them and you say well
[16:47] good riddance they obviously didn't
[16:49] believe to begin with
[16:50] but we're not considering all the many
[16:52] factors that may work upon a soul
[16:54] to cause them to be discouraged allow
[16:56] their spirits to be broken
[16:58] and to fall from a heavenly place and
[17:00] end up in a very earthly condition
[17:03] backsliding is often
[17:05] misunderstood it says in jeremiah
[17:08] chapter 3 verse 22
[17:10] return ye backsliding children and i
[17:13] will hear
[17:14] hear excuse me heal your backslidings
[17:17] isn't that beautiful that's usually not
[17:19] what we say to the backslider we usually
[17:20] just tell them
[17:22] well they've asked for it they deserved
[17:23] it it proves they're not elect and we
[17:24] have a whole bunch of choice sayings for
[17:26] them
[17:26] and sometimes we kind of throw out the
[17:28] serpent seed
[17:29] just very casually let's not do
[17:33] a disservice to the teaching of the
[17:36] original sin
[17:37] by using serpent seed is the nomination
[17:39] you give to everybody that doesn't
[17:41] believe or live like you
[17:43] it waters down the truth of it as a
[17:45] matter of fact
[17:46] it observates the truth it muddies it it
[17:49] keeps it harder to understand
[17:51] when you throw serpent seed around
[17:52] because then it makes it seem like
[17:53] there's a race of people that descend
[17:55] directly from cain upon the face of this
[17:56] earth
[17:57] when when when it was the the doctrine
[18:00] of the original sin is to help us to
[18:01] understand
[18:02] how satan interrupted the program of god
[18:06] and that all men require salvation and
[18:09] how that the grace of god in your life
[18:10] is by election
[18:12] and the reason why we can be born again
[18:14] is there's a seed inside of us to be
[18:15] quickened
[18:17] so it's not something you throw around
[18:19] as a criticism as an explanation
[18:20] why some people don't do some things
[18:22] that should be something we're very
[18:23] careful to utilize something we're not
[18:25] we don't throw around very easily it can
[18:28] be informative and instructive in a
[18:29] teaching to understand
[18:31] that there is a spiritual a numbness and
[18:34] a spiritual
[18:35] inability to understand the truth but
[18:38] that's not throwing around
[18:39] casually but here he's saying return ye
[18:43] backsliding children
[18:44] and i will heal your backslidings
[18:47] that means backsliding is a condition
[18:49] that can be recovered from
[18:51] when you backslide it doesn't mean
[18:53] you've lost the doors shut there's no
[18:54] way that you can be restored
[18:56] he's saying return come back and i will
[18:58] heal your backslidings he says behold we
[19:00] come unto thee for thou
[19:01] art the lord our god this is how god is
[19:04] to the backslider
[19:06] he welcomes them he encourages them he
[19:08] leaves the
[19:09] leaves a path back if you have a family
[19:12] member someone you love a co-worker
[19:14] anyone
[19:14] who seems to have turned their back on
[19:16] the message or walked away from truth or
[19:18] separated fellowship from you do
[19:20] everything you can
[19:22] to let them know that the path is clear
[19:24] for them to come back
[19:26] don't slam the door on them and say hey
[19:28] you know what you blew it buddy and slam
[19:30] the door
[19:30] because one day one day they're going to
[19:32] turn around and that path is closed
[19:35] that path is closed that path is closed
[19:37] they've got no way to come back to truth
[19:39] they've got no way to be prayed for
[19:40] they've got no way to find it and all of
[19:42] a sudden they realize there's somebody
[19:44] who kept the door open
[19:46] there's a path back i'll just text that
[19:48] brother i'll just call that sister
[19:49] i'll come back to that church because
[19:51] when i left they they kept the door open
[19:55] amen return you backsliding children and
[19:58] i will heal
[19:58] your backslidings and so this is
[20:02] this is the certain man
[20:06] going down from jerusalem to jericho he
[20:08] can represent the center
[20:10] he can also represent the backslider
[20:14] and then it says this certain man fell
[20:17] among
[20:18] thieves so let's just take a moment to
[20:21] ponder these thieves
[20:23] it's not one who steals by deceit but
[20:26] rather
[20:27] these were violent men it wasn't a
[20:30] pickpocket you know on that road who
[20:32] came and asked for directions and said
[20:34] ways is acting up i don't know which way
[20:35] to go
[20:36] uh can i borrow your phone and call for
[20:38] directions and then just by stealth or
[20:40] deceit pickpocketed
[20:41] the man coming down from jerusalem to
[20:43] jericho these were violent men
[20:46] the word thieves comes from the word to
[20:48] plunder they were robbers or free
[20:50] booters or
[20:51] pirates as you might say in more modern
[20:53] parlance and it was a which they were a
[20:55] gang that ambushed people
[20:58] that they would do them physical harm
[21:00] and take their belongings from them this
[21:01] is
[21:02] the group that uh that fell that grabbed
[21:05] a hold of this man and seized upon him
[21:07] so it says he
[21:07] fell among thieves they ambushed him
[21:09] they grabbed them and it was a group of
[21:11] people
[21:12] and i think it is instructive that it's
[21:14] characterized as a group
[21:16] and and because it's characterized as a
[21:18] group i believe it can be instructive to
[21:20] us
[21:20] as a church or as a group of people
[21:24] or a group of friends or associates as a
[21:26] group we don't ever want to be thieves
[21:30] we do not want to be a group of people
[21:32] that ever injure or rob somebody
[21:35] and you think well my goodness brother
[21:36] aaron what's your attitude towards
[21:38] people in the message anymore to think
[21:40] that they would hide in weight somewhere
[21:42] and then jump out and physically grab a
[21:44] hold of somebody
[21:45] steal their iphone and take their nice
[21:46] jordans and then run off
[21:49] and maybe just kind of give them the
[21:50] business a little bit while they're down
[21:52] on the ground
[21:52] no that i'm not saying that we would do
[21:54] it physically
[21:55] and if that was merely what i was trying
[21:57] to encourage you not to do is to
[21:59] physically harm somebody
[22:00] i think we could all leave saying i
[22:02] think i can do this
[22:04] gonna be a good week right and we'd feel
[22:07] pretty good i mean brother aaron said
[22:08] don't punch somebody in the face
[22:10] i can do it i can do it i can do it and
[22:12] who knows there might be one of us going
[22:14] oh man he found me out got to do good
[22:17] this week
[22:20] my co-workers are going to notice a
[22:21] difference
[22:24] but when there's other ways that you can
[22:26] injure and rob
[22:29] i want you to think very maturely about
[22:30] this how can i be
[22:32] how can i be challenged by this image of
[22:34] a group of thieves and how can i apply
[22:36] it to my life who i don't ever want to
[22:38] do to this certain man who came down
[22:39] from jerusalem to jericho
[22:41] i don't want to do to him spiritually
[22:44] what these men did physically to him
[22:46] because brother man looks at him
[22:47] completely different he says this is a
[22:48] man who was backslidden
[22:50] he was spiritually dead yet physically
[22:52] alive
[22:53] i don't want to be somebody who can
[22:55] spiritually deaden somebody
[22:58] i may not have the capacity just within
[23:00] my person and maybe with the weak
[23:01] stomach to punch somebody and
[23:03] bloody them and and make them hurt
[23:05] physically but what capacity do we
[23:08] have with our own lives and attitudes
[23:10] and judgments and behaviors
[23:12] to spiritually harm somebody and inflict
[23:14] them with grief
[23:16] notice how it says when he fell among
[23:18] thieves who injure him and rob him it
[23:20] says immediately that they stripped him
[23:22] of his clothing
[23:24] took away his raiment and laid him bare
[23:26] and he was naked
[23:28] and it struck me as i studied this that
[23:30] we should never take away something from
[23:32] somebody
[23:33] without offering something to them in
[23:34] replacement
[23:36] that we should never and maybe i thought
[23:38] about it this way
[23:39] you take away someone's covering
[23:41] someone's clothing that we should never
[23:43] take away from somebody their
[23:45] arraignment without offering them
[23:47] something else that they can dress
[23:48] themselves in
[23:50] and brother branham taught that religion
[23:52] is a covering
[23:54] and if we're not careful we can point
[23:56] out
[23:57] how that many people have a false
[23:58] religion and it's fig leaf religion and
[24:00] those are ideas of man and
[24:02] your belief system is wrong and the
[24:04] catholic church teaches this
[24:05] and pentecostals do this wrong and we
[24:07] can we can sit down with them and we can
[24:09] walk them through the word
[24:11] and we can be very quick to tear down
[24:13] their belief system
[24:14] and then depart because the scripture
[24:17] says that they let wounded him and
[24:19] and took his ramen and wounded him and
[24:21] then departed
[24:23] stripped him of everything he had the
[24:24] way he saw things the way that he lived
[24:26] and all of a sudden it's like oh now
[24:27] that i've proven you're wrong i'm just
[24:29] going to go ahead
[24:30] and depart we don't we don't uh witness
[24:33] and we don't share what we believe and
[24:35] we never strive just to make somebody
[24:36] fool us or expose them
[24:38] or do anything where we laid them bare
[24:40] and now exposed and naked walk off
[24:42] if you're going to take something away
[24:44] from somebody offer them truth in return
[24:48] do not destroy a person's convictions
[24:50] without offering true salvation through
[24:53] christ
[24:53] do not take away and lie from somebody
[24:55] or expose an
[24:56] error in someone's belief system without
[24:58] offering them truth
[25:01] i mean it and maybe this is a little bit
[25:03] of a dramatic example but perhaps it
[25:05] would drive the point home
[25:07] where you take somebody said oh so you
[25:08] baptized in titles huh hmm
[25:11] yeah well you do know that's wrong right
[25:13] what do you mean well
[25:15] i mean think about it three gods
[25:18] and you just completely riddle their
[25:20] belief system and they're like well what
[25:22] do i do it's like well you know maybe
[25:23] you should pick up a bible and read
[25:25] book of acts and you just kind of leave
[25:28] them in their sin you leave them and
[25:29] they're wondering
[25:30] that's what these thieves did very very
[25:33] good at destroying and tearing down
[25:35] but completely incapable of building up
[25:39] always quick to expose someone in their
[25:40] air but never able to offer them a way
[25:42] out of it
[25:44] and all of us can be very good spiritual
[25:47] thieves
[25:48] to strip someone of the arraignment and
[25:50] to rob them and then depart
[25:53] it says they who wounded him struck him
[25:56] with blows
[25:58] and we may never physically assault
[26:00] someone but our words can hurt
[26:03] our attitudes can hurt ostracizing
[26:06] people can hurt
[26:08] you know separating ourselves and making
[26:10] them feel uncomfortable and
[26:12] and there's many different ways that we
[26:13] can treat others
[26:16] to make them feel all alone and to wound
[26:19] them
[26:20] brother branham says in the message
[26:22] hebrews chapter 7 part 2
[26:24] it says and you people with these saw
[26:25] blade tempers
[26:27] that's always spouting off in the mouth
[26:29] that somebody can't put up and things
[26:31] like that he says be careful
[26:33] now the reason why it's called a saw
[26:34] blade or a buzz saw is because it hurts
[26:37] it cuts it inflicts
[26:40] now and if you're thinking man brother
[26:42] aaron you didn't even wait a month
[26:43] before it got real
[26:44] well i feel like i'm with family tonight
[26:47] we can just be
[26:48] plain we can be honest it says
[26:52] people with these saw blade tempers he
[26:54] says be careful you're guilty if you
[26:56] speak a word against your brother
[26:58] that's not right and he says
[27:01] you know don't go around and tear down
[27:03] it he says you don't have to stick a
[27:05] knife in a man's back to kill him
[27:08] you can break his character and kill him
[27:10] kill his influence
[27:12] break a man's character speak against
[27:14] his character wound his spirit
[27:16] kill his influence he says speak against
[27:18] your pastor here say something bad about
[27:20] him
[27:20] you might as well just shoot him shot
[27:22] him might as well shot him
[27:24] now listen that doesn't just go for
[27:28] pastors
[27:30] he said well whatever you do don't say
[27:31] something about the pastor i would say
[27:33] well whatever you do don't say something
[27:34] about nobody
[27:36] i mean let's not just shoot somebody say
[27:37] well at least he's not a pastor
[27:39] put in another clip brother
[27:42] get the automatic out he's not a pastor
[27:45] just riddle him full of bullet holes
[27:47] he's just using an example that if you
[27:49] would speak against your pastor say
[27:51] something bad about him you might as
[27:52] well just shot him
[27:54] but that would apply to anybody told
[27:57] something that wasn't right about him
[27:58] well it'll kill his influence with the
[27:59] people and things like that
[28:00] and you're guilty of it so he's
[28:03] identifying a way and i know this is
[28:04] very familiar to us
[28:06] how that we through criticism with
[28:08] through lies or through exaggerations
[28:10] and half
[28:10] truths or whatever they might be through
[28:12] our own temper
[28:14] say things about other people and in
[28:16] doing so he's saying it's tantamount to
[28:19] wounding them
[28:21] he says you might as well as kill them
[28:22] because you killed their influence he's
[28:24] saying it's practically murder
[28:25] shooting somebody and assaulting
[28:27] somebody but through your words when you
[28:29] say things that are harmful and wounding
[28:30] to them
[28:34] and that's another way that we should
[28:35] always be careful
[28:39] and put ourselves in the place of the
[28:41] thief
[28:42] how can we hurt how can we offend how
[28:45] can we tear down
[28:48] and i want to read a statement where
[28:49] brother bannon wrote in chapter 5 of the
[28:51] church age book
[28:53] and catch how the word characterizes
[28:55] those who would seek to harm
[28:57] someone he says already the false vine
[28:59] was turning loose
[29:00] its anger against the living god by
[29:03] killing the elect
[29:05] he says even as it did as did its
[29:07] forebear cain
[29:08] kill abel now brother branham
[29:12] even says it here
[29:16] and i maybe i'm just uh i'm just missing
[29:19] it here but i want to
[29:20] express this he says somebody with a
[29:24] temper
[29:26] and now he's saying the false vines
[29:28] turning loose it's anger
[29:31] anger a temper and anger do not always
[29:34] arise of our own
[29:37] actions of our own just a bitterness in
[29:39] our hearts that we have manufactured
[29:42] but we can be angry because we have been
[29:44] aggrieved
[29:46] it can be our own sense of justice
[29:49] and our own hurting and from a place of
[29:51] hurt and a place of being wounded that
[29:53] we lash out with our tongues
[29:55] and that does not justify shooting
[29:58] somebody
[30:00] that does not justify killing somebody
[30:02] so no matter how much we may
[30:04] be hurt or offended and in our offense
[30:06] have a temper or
[30:08] in our pain be angry notice how he
[30:10] characterizes this the false vine
[30:12] through its anger
[30:13] was lashing out against the living god
[30:16] by
[30:16] killing the elect he says the true
[30:19] church kept trying to get the first
[30:21] church to repent
[30:22] it would not do so it increased in size
[30:25] and influence
[30:26] it embarked upon a constant campaign to
[30:29] discredit the true seed
[30:32] they claimed that they and they alone
[30:33] were the true representatives of the
[30:34] lord jesus christ and vaunted the fact
[30:36] that they were the original church in
[30:38] rome and they alone were the first
[30:40] church and brother brahma says and hey
[30:42] they were but where was the leaven where
[30:45] was the discrepancy
[30:47] how is it that the first church was
[30:49] clearly indicating that they weren't the
[30:50] church of god
[30:52] it wasn't in that they were second or
[30:54] that they were
[30:55] that they were third but it was in their
[30:57] attitude towards the other church
[30:59] the false vine was turning loose its
[31:01] anger against the living god
[31:02] by killing the elect they had embarked
[31:04] on a constant campaign
[31:06] to discredit somebody else whereabouts
[31:09] put in the context of the true seat
[31:10] listen
[31:11] if you embark on any campaign to merely
[31:14] discredit
[31:15] somebody else be careful who you're
[31:17] campaigning for
[31:21] even if you say well i'm just
[31:22] campaigning against false seed well they
[31:24] that the truth or the first church
[31:26] didn't think they were campaigning
[31:28] against the elect
[31:30] as we pointed out last time brother
[31:32] brown says that bride will not persecute
[31:34] bride
[31:34] why is that because bride don't
[31:36] persecute anybody
[31:39] that that's what that's part of the
[31:40] bride's characteristic
[31:43] and so there's different ways i'm just
[31:45] kind of going through this on a
[31:46] surface level just laying some
[31:48] principles out there for us to consider
[31:51] there's different ways that we can
[31:52] personally challenge ourselves with this
[31:55] image of a thief
[31:56] laying hold of a man and robbing him and
[32:00] and letting him bare or wounding him
[32:03] we could see how it applied to a group
[32:04] of thieves and even us individually
[32:06] how we use our words whether it be a
[32:08] buzz saw temper
[32:09] things that we say against a person's
[32:11] character or or being
[32:12] driven uh to discredit and to tear down
[32:16] these are all marks and characteristics
[32:17] of thieves and you don't want to be a
[32:19] thief
[32:23] and then to take this further to
[32:26] challenge ourselves in
[32:27] viewing these thieves it said they
[32:29] departed leaving him half dead
[32:32] let me challenge us with this if we have
[32:34] harmed anyone
[32:36] we should never become indifferent about
[32:38] it
[32:40] if someone says that hurt
[32:43] we should not um automatically engage in
[32:46] some kind of
[32:47] uh process of evaluating with just how
[32:49] much force did we hit them with
[32:52] and then say well you're just a big
[32:53] if that hurt
[32:56] and it was i'm not willing to
[32:58] acknowledge your offense
[33:00] i'm not willing to try to even affirm
[33:03] that it's
[33:04] that it's understandable that you would
[33:05] be hurt you just immediately try to
[33:07] justify your actions
[33:08] well how could you say that hurt there
[33:11] was nothing to that you need thicker
[33:12] skin or you should have ducked or you
[33:14] should have known i was going to hit you
[33:16] but instead if we have offended somebody
[33:18] we have harmed somebody
[33:20] we should never be indifferent or quick
[33:22] to justify ourselves
[33:24] if we have hurt somebody whether
[33:25] intentionally or unintentionally
[33:27] it is necessary as christians to make it
[33:29] right
[33:31] if you have hurt somebody whether by uh
[33:33] uh
[33:34] with intent or without intent it is
[33:37] necessary it's incumbent upon us in the
[33:38] scripture
[33:39] to make things right jesus says it this
[33:43] way matthew chapter 5 verses 21 to 24
[33:46] he says you have heard that it was said
[33:48] by them of old time thou shalt not kill
[33:50] and whosoever shall kill shall be in
[33:52] danger of the judgment
[33:54] now recall just a moment ago how brother
[33:57] branham said that
[33:58] you might as well shoot a man if you
[34:00] speak said something bad about him
[34:02] and that you kill his influence break
[34:05] his character
[34:06] and you kill him so we could use this as
[34:09] an application thou shalt not kill and
[34:10] whosoever shall kill shall be in danger
[34:12] of the judgment
[34:12] then jesus actually makes the same
[34:15] connection that brother branham made
[34:16] because he says but i say unto you that
[34:18] whosoever is angry with his brother
[34:20] without a cause shall be in danger of
[34:22] the judgment
[34:24] and whosoever shall say to his brother
[34:25] raqqa which would have been an insult in
[34:28] them at that time call him a or
[34:30] something
[34:31] shall be in danger of the counsel but
[34:33] whosoever shall say
[34:34] thou sh thou fool shall be in danger of
[34:37] hell fire
[34:39] notice how it's saying if you call
[34:40] someone a dimwit you call somebody
[34:42] uh stupid or something he's actually
[34:45] saying those
[34:46] words place you in the same position
[34:49] as one who would actually take another
[34:51] man's life
[34:54] this is jesus really raising the
[34:55] standard it's really would be causing
[34:57] the jews at that time to think man we
[34:59] knew
[35:00] that if a man killed somebody he's in
[35:02] danger of judgment now jesus says if
[35:04] you're just
[35:04] mad at your brother and you don't have a
[35:06] reason for it you don't have just cause
[35:08] and you hold bitterness and animosity
[35:10] against him without cause you're in
[35:11] danger of judgment
[35:13] and i say if you call somebody raqqa or
[35:15] a you're in danger of the council
[35:17] and i say if you say somebody that
[35:18] they're full you're in danger of hell
[35:20] fire
[35:21] he's magnified he's amplified the law
[35:24] he's put them all on notice you don't
[35:25] have to take a man's life
[35:26] to put yourself in a precarious position
[35:29] of being judged by the word
[35:32] so then he takes it to this if you think
[35:35] as far as
[35:36] being angry with your brother saying
[35:38] unto him raqqa
[35:40] or saying fool he says therefore verse
[35:44] 23 therefore thou bring thy gift to the
[35:46] altar
[35:48] and there remembers that thy brother
[35:50] hath ought
[35:51] against thee that means that you have
[35:54] wronged him
[35:55] you have harmed him he has caused to be
[35:58] offended by your
[35:59] words or by your conduct if you remember
[36:01] maybe we could read it this way
[36:02] if you remember that you have heard or
[36:04] harmed your brother
[36:06] he says leave there thy gift before the
[36:08] altar
[36:09] go thy way first be reconciled to thy
[36:13] brother
[36:14] and then come and offer thy gift
[36:18] this is very heavy the jews believed
[36:21] that if they stole from their neighbors
[36:23] they had to make it right before making
[36:25] an offering so if i stole something from
[36:28] you i took your lamb when you weren't
[36:29] looking i
[36:30] i took your shovel since you wouldn't
[36:32] let me borrow it and i stole it
[36:34] then before i make an offering before i
[36:36] would worship god
[36:37] i'd say oh i stole i need to go give
[36:40] them back what i stole their physical
[36:42] possession
[36:42] before i can make an offering but now
[36:45] jesus is expanding this to include
[36:47] any offense to a person whether by word
[36:49] or deed
[36:51] he's expanded it now to where it's not
[36:53] just if you stole something from
[36:54] somebody
[36:55] but you speak against somebody or you
[36:57] you use words of ridicule or you're just
[37:00] angry at them without cause he's
[37:01] expanded it to say listen
[37:03] if you have injured or offended anyone
[37:05] whether physically or emotionally
[37:08] before you make your offering go to that
[37:10] one
[37:11] and make it right if a person has
[37:14] any just reason to complain because of
[37:17] injury or offense on your part
[37:19] and in particular as he describes it in
[37:21] verses 21 and 22 he's saying leave your
[37:23] gift at the altar
[37:24] go to them and be reconciled that means
[37:27] settle the difficulty
[37:29] make a proper acknowledgement of the
[37:32] offense
[37:32] and then satisfy the satisfaction of the
[37:35] injury
[37:37] you acknowledge i've wronged i
[37:38] acknowledge that i've hurt and you make
[37:40] amends
[37:43] one commentator wrote it this way if you
[37:44] have wronged him make restitution
[37:46] if you owe him a debt which ought to be
[37:48] paid pay it if you've injured
[37:50] his character confess it and seek pardon
[37:52] if he's under an erroneous impression
[37:54] if your conduct has been such is to lead
[37:56] him to suspect that you've injured him
[37:58] make an explanation do all in your power
[38:01] and all you ought to do
[38:02] to have the matter settled not beautiful
[38:07] that even if there's some reason that he
[38:08] thinks wrong about your character
[38:11] but it's been your conduct that would
[38:12] lead him to be suspicious
[38:14] then make explanation do all in your
[38:17] powers you ought to do
[38:19] to make the matter settled settle the
[38:20] difficulty and
[38:22] sure it's these it's easy to say right
[38:25] but sometimes you have to be willing to
[38:26] face the hurricane
[38:29] you have to be willing to face the storm
[38:30] subject yourself to the
[38:32] to the anger but if you've done
[38:34] something wrong
[38:35] you've got to acknowledge it and then
[38:37] satisfy it
[38:39] it's our duty to make things right when
[38:41] we've injured others
[38:42] and this is where jesus places it now
[38:44] think of how this turns things around
[38:46] we think oh i was born to serve god and
[38:48] to worship and praise and
[38:50] go to church and throw my hands in the
[38:52] air just give myself to him give myself
[38:54] away
[38:55] jesus says it's our duty to make it
[38:57] right when we've injured someone
[38:58] even before we worship god
[39:02] that's the exact way that he places it
[39:04] if you've heard somebody
[39:05] before you make your offering to god go
[39:07] be reconciled with your brother
[39:09] before you even try to worship and
[39:12] christ is showing that god will not
[39:14] accept a man's worship unless he is
[39:16] made right to with the person that he
[39:18] has
[39:19] offended in order to worship god
[39:21] correctly this would apply
[39:23] maybe just not so much in an instance of
[39:25] bringing worship but in order to worship
[39:27] god correctly we must do justice to
[39:29] others
[39:29] and seek reconciliation we've hurt or
[39:32] offended somebody
[39:34] this i could say that we realize
[39:38] don't be a thief we don't want to be a
[39:41] backslider
[39:42] but as we look at this group of thieves
[39:44] it's instructive to us to say
[39:46] don't be a thief a christian is not one
[39:49] that injures any man
[39:52] therefore we should never seek to rob to
[39:54] harm or deprive
[39:56] any man not just to physical goods
[40:00] but even in spiritual senses
[40:04] the bible says in john chapter 10 verse
[40:06] 1 verily verily i say unto you
[40:08] he that entereth not by the door and to
[40:10] the sheepfold
[40:11] but climbeth up some other way the same
[40:14] is a thief
[40:15] and a robber i want to use it in a
[40:19] unique way
[40:21] we could say that he that does not come
[40:22] through christ and through the door of
[40:24] the sheephold
[40:24] we can realize he's not sheep but he's a
[40:27] thief and a robber perhaps he's coming
[40:29] to rob he's coming to be a thief
[40:30] he's coming to destroy the flock but
[40:32] rather someone who has not come through
[40:34] christ
[40:35] is characterized as a thief and a robber
[40:37] and we are not thieves we are sheep
[40:40] but when we behave as thieves that's
[40:43] when we're
[40:43] hypocritical that's when we're not
[40:45] acting in character a thief and a robber
[40:47] is one
[40:48] who has not come through christ it's one
[40:50] who has not experienced his grace and
[40:52] forgiveness of sins
[40:53] and we as sheep have the capacity and we
[40:56] have the ability to work past hurts or
[40:58] offenses
[40:59] and allow our emotions to come in
[41:00] harmony with the word of god and not
[41:02] lash out not be angry not have a saw
[41:05] temper
[41:06] and not be thieves and robbers in our
[41:07] own way
[41:09] because sheep are not characterized with
[41:11] that nature
[41:13] so i say don't be a thief you can go
[41:17] put it on instagram ma'am brother i
[41:20] heard preach tonight
[41:21] his point was don't be a thief i guess a
[41:24] hashtag winning i don't know you feel
[41:26] like i
[41:26] don't feel like i'm a thief but there's
[41:29] so many different ways we can be thieves
[41:33] as we're looking at this a certain man
[41:36] who came down from jerusalem and fell
[41:38] among thieves
[41:39] now he's there wounded naked
[41:43] half dead verse 31 it says and by chance
[41:47] there came down a certain priest
[41:49] that way and when he saw him he passed
[41:52] by on the other side
[41:54] and likewise a levite when he was at the
[41:56] place now
[41:57] now it says the levite came and looked
[41:59] on him
[42:01] there's different ways that you could
[42:03] imagine the priest walking by and sees
[42:05] this
[42:05] horrible scene and he's like oh you know
[42:07] what that looks like something that i
[42:09] could be justified in the law not
[42:10] touching i don't want to get dirty i
[42:11] don't want to marry my testimony
[42:13] i'm just going to keep on going the
[42:14] levite actually goes and stands over him
[42:17] maybe he kind of kicked him a little bit
[42:19] they saw if there was anything left did
[42:21] they take it all
[42:22] okay but he goes and stands over the man
[42:25] he looks on him
[42:26] and pass by on the other side
[42:29] now think of these two two people a
[42:31] priest he was one who offers sacrifices
[42:34] in the temple he's the one that would
[42:37] busy
[42:37] himself with the sacrificial rights he's
[42:39] one that's actually
[42:40] administering the sacrifices placing
[42:42] them upon the altar this is one
[42:44] that is is not just merely an attendant
[42:47] but he would be
[42:47] offering sacrifices on behalf of the
[42:50] people to god
[42:51] he was the priest who fulfilled that
[42:53] order
[42:54] in the law for the people and then a
[42:57] levite he was an assistant to the priest
[43:00] he would have kept the temple clean and
[43:02] the utensils clean he would open and
[43:03] shut the gates of the temple he would
[43:05] actually may have been one who sang the
[43:06] hymns
[43:07] in the temple that's what the levites
[43:09] did if they did not enter into the
[43:10] priesthood
[43:11] they still served within the temple and
[43:13] they sang hymns or they
[43:15] cleaned utensils and they kept the they
[43:17] kept the temple clean they were the
[43:18] assistants
[43:20] and it's possible that jesus refers to
[43:22] the priest and the levites because of
[43:23] the
[43:24] their call to duty and they're called to
[43:26] service they may have been the ones
[43:27] that most frequently traveled that road
[43:29] from jerusalem to
[43:30] uh to jericho or perhaps he used them to
[43:34] make a point
[43:37] that these two the priest and the levite
[43:39] by nature of their office
[43:41] were obligated to show mercy to the one
[43:43] who was injured
[43:44] there was just another common man that
[43:46] walked by him i thought well i mean he
[43:47] could have done better
[43:48] but rather jesus was trying to draw this
[43:50] contrast that the priest who would have
[43:52] had a duty under the law the levite who
[43:54] would have had a
[43:55] a life of service dedicated to serving
[43:58] in the temple the priest
[44:00] offered sacrifices on behalf of the
[44:02] people the levites
[44:03] offered a service to the priests to make
[44:06] sure the sacrifices were administered
[44:08] they by their very names were people who
[44:10] were given to serve and were obligated
[44:12] to show mercy to that man who was hurt
[44:16] in other words a person in need a person
[44:18] in this
[44:19] condition that this certain man was in
[44:21] would have had the right to expect
[44:23] immediate help from these two types of
[44:25] people
[44:26] if he was laying there and able to see
[44:29] he might have seen a traveler go by and
[44:30] thought
[44:31] well he he won't help me but then maybe
[44:34] he sees a priest and
[44:35] something leaps in his heart this is a
[44:37] man who would not only you think have a
[44:39] heart to do it but would be obligated by
[44:41] the law
[44:43] and then he passes on by maybe in his
[44:45] condition being half dead
[44:47] he sees the levite he's like oh the
[44:49] priest passed but now here's somebody
[44:51] who'll have compassion and as he lays
[44:53] there the levite begins to walk closer
[44:55] he thinks yes
[44:56] he's under the duty he's under an
[44:58] obligation of all the people that have
[45:00] passed
[45:01] this is the one that i could expect to
[45:03] help me but as he comes up he just looks
[45:05] over him
[45:06] and walks away again and this certain
[45:08] man of everyone who passed by that way
[45:11] would have expected these to stop
[45:15] but their failure to stop and comfort
[45:17] this man who was wounded was a clear
[45:18] breach of the law that they were called
[45:20] to observe even more we could say than
[45:24] any other jew as a priest and a levite
[45:25] they were bound to it they were
[45:27] characterized by it and yet they shirked
[45:29] their duty under the law
[45:31] for whatever thought process they went
[45:32] through they ended up passing by
[45:35] and and i'm going to just i'm going to
[45:37] leave it
[45:39] leave the description there for now and
[45:42] maybe go into it
[45:43] a little bit more but i just want to
[45:44] change the corner just kind of turn it
[45:46] and try to start wrapping this up
[45:48] and ask what about us
[45:53] are we not likewise by nature of our
[45:56] calling
[45:57] obligated to show kindness to somebody
[45:59] who's hurting
[46:01] are we not also expected by nature of
[46:04] our own confession
[46:05] to show mercy to someone who's to be
[46:08] pitied who has been wronged or harmed
[46:11] we're not called to aggravate their pain
[46:13] we're not called to rub it in we're not
[46:14] called
[46:15] to to walk by the man who's beaten and
[46:18] bloodied
[46:18] on the bloody path on the way
[46:20] backsliding from jerusalem to jericho
[46:22] and say
[46:22] looks like you got what you deserved
[46:24] buddy
[46:27] and to keep the the condemnation on them
[46:30] and leave them in their pain
[46:32] so then i want you to consider and i and
[46:34] i i'm sowing this by
[46:36] divine inspiration into the foundation
[46:38] of this church
[46:39] what is your reflex towards the
[46:41] backslider
[46:44] what is your instinctive attitude
[46:46] towards those that fall away
[46:49] do we pass by and so i say to you
[46:53] tonight
[46:53] don't be a priest don't be a levite
[47:00] definitely we you don't want to be a
[47:02] thief you don't want to be a backslider
[47:04] you don't want to be a thief but in this
[47:06] don't be a priest either
[47:09] don't be a levite notice what the
[47:11] scripture says because brother braham is
[47:13] the one that characterizes a certain man
[47:15] who went down from jerusalem to jericho
[47:17] he's the one that characterizes him as a
[47:18] backslider
[47:20] in james chapter 5 verses 19 to 20 says
[47:22] brethren if any man do
[47:24] air from the truth and one convert him
[47:27] now this is not a second conversion
[47:31] in order for him to err from the truth
[47:33] he's the very language that's used
[47:35] is here's one who's been walking in the
[47:37] faith one who's fellowshipped among you
[47:39] one who's had a confession
[47:41] maybe even had an experience or a
[47:42] testimony and he begins to vary from
[47:44] that way
[47:46] he says if one convert him not his first
[47:48] conversion
[47:49] but to restore him from his backsliding
[47:53] remember backsliding could be one
[47:54] turning away or one pushed away
[47:58] it says convert him let him know
[48:01] that he which converteth the sinner from
[48:03] the air of his ways
[48:04] shall save a soul from death and shall
[48:07] hide
[48:08] a multitude of sins
[48:11] james is telling these this church
[48:12] telling these people labor to restore
[48:14] those that have fallen
[48:17] that's the hard part right that's when
[48:20] you really have to roll up your sleeves
[48:22] that's when you begin to examine your
[48:24] own selves and consider your own selves
[48:25] that's when you need to be meek and in
[48:27] the fear of god
[48:28] restore such one he said we should labor
[48:30] to restore those that have fallen
[48:32] one summer is everyone ought to seek the
[48:34] salvation of everyone
[48:38] and not have these prejudices and biases
[48:40] and all these things that we immediately
[48:42] use
[48:42] to apply to every situation well that's
[48:44] that's outside of my
[48:46] expertise but labor
[48:50] to restore one that has fallen
[48:54] to convert means to bring back from
[48:57] wandering
[48:59] so it's not the first conversion of a
[49:01] sinner necessarily
[49:03] though that clearly has application to
[49:05] convert means to re-establish in the
[49:07] truth to turn
[49:08] from the air of his way do you realize
[49:11] the beautiful grace that's expected
[49:13] expressed in this just as we read in the
[49:15] beginning you backslidden children
[49:17] return i will heal
[49:18] your backslidings it's saying that if
[49:20] someone has backslid
[49:21] we don't slam the door we make sure the
[49:23] door stays open
[49:27] you don't shove them on the way out you
[49:28] don't say well let me let me help you
[49:30] get further down the road let me buy you
[49:32] some good running shoes
[49:34] whenever you see someone running away
[49:36] you lace your running shoes on you
[49:37] you lace them up tight you get ready for
[49:39] to chase after him you get ready for the
[49:41] return get ready for the rebound
[49:43] get ready to catch them if you can
[49:46] because it says reestablishing the truth
[49:47] turn away from is there all what a grace
[49:50] that is expressed to us maybe not us who
[49:52] are spiritual
[49:53] but us who backslid to us who have
[49:57] wondered
[49:58] those who've made mistakes what a grace
[49:59] that's expressed the bible doesn't
[50:01] castigate you the bible doesn't say
[50:03] there's no way back
[50:04] the bible's actually instructing to
[50:05] those who've held fast
[50:07] don't forget your brethren that have
[50:09] wandered off
[50:12] what a grace what a grace
[50:18] brother jason you could relate to as one
[50:20] being dead amen
[50:21] there's a brother here visiting from
[50:22] michigan it goes to my father-in-law's
[50:24] church and i say father-in-law's also
[50:26] one of my best friends he's a he's a
[50:28] father to me
[50:29] brother john martin he brother jason
[50:31] goes to to his church
[50:33] here's a man that was dead and raised
[50:35] from the dead
[50:37] physically dead three times that's a
[50:40] good number
[50:41] and he could testify not just being
[50:44] raised from the dead
[50:45] physically but spiritually
[50:48] what a grace to somebody that we can
[50:52] testify to anyone
[50:53] whether they're well you maybe can't
[50:55] testify if they're physically dead
[50:57] but you have a testimony god raises the
[50:59] dead amen
[51:00] and then we all can testify that god
[51:03] raises the spiritually dead
[51:06] we were all dead in sins and trespasses
[51:08] all of us here tonight who have
[51:10] spiritual life can at one time say i was
[51:12] dead but now i am alive i have been
[51:14] quickened
[51:15] and we don't turn our nose as it were or
[51:17] look down upon
[51:18] anybody who's spiritually dead or
[51:20] somebody who's wondered he calls them
[51:22] the wandering but we realize
[51:23] i can be commissioned if it's just pray
[51:26] just hold the door open
[51:28] let me be one who has a burden for those
[51:30] who have followed that they can be
[51:32] restored back to truth
[51:36] from a position of strength we forgot
[51:38] that we were sons and daughters of god
[51:40] we forgot that our position was secure
[51:42] in the kingdom and that it does not
[51:44] diminish the glory of the bride if she
[51:46] prays for the backslider if she reaches
[51:48] out to the sinner
[51:49] our glory is not diminished it shines
[51:51] even brighter because it's not carnally
[51:53] manufactured
[51:55] listen to how it's said in isaiah all
[51:57] this is so wonderful
[52:00] isaiah chapter 58 verses 6 to 8
[52:03] is not this the fast that i have chosen
[52:08] to loose the bands of wickedness
[52:11] to undo the heavy burdens and to let the
[52:15] oppressed go free
[52:17] and that ye break every yoke
[52:21] make this part of your divine commission
[52:23] to loose bands of wickedness
[52:25] undo heavy burdens let the oppressed go
[52:28] free
[52:29] break every yoke is it not to deal
[52:33] thy bread now because we we all are
[52:35] participating in this now
[52:37] deal vibrate give thy bread to the
[52:39] hungry
[52:41] and that thou bring the poor that are
[52:44] cast
[52:44] out to the house when thou seest the
[52:48] naked that thou cover him
[52:50] and that thou hide not thyself from
[52:52] thine own flesh from your own
[52:54] mankind your own associates your own
[52:56] family don't hide yourself
[52:58] don't pass by as the priest did
[53:03] not as if we were to even attribute this
[53:05] characteristic to god to loose the bands
[53:07] of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens
[53:09] to let the oppressed go free he then
[53:12] brings us
[53:13] into this very ministry if it's god that
[53:15] does that now he begins to tell us
[53:17] how that the bands of wickedness are
[53:19] loose how heavy burns are undone
[53:21] how the oppressed go free how every yoke
[53:23] is broken it is for
[53:24] you to deal by bread to the hungry it is
[53:27] for you
[53:28] to bring the poor that are cast out into
[53:30] the house when you see someone naked
[53:32] cover them and don't
[53:33] hide yourself from your own flesh that
[53:36] is how
[53:36] god looses the bands of wickedness that
[53:39] is how those who are laden with heavy
[53:41] burdens
[53:41] are undone that is how the oppressed
[53:43] goes free when you
[53:44] live the life that you ought to live
[53:46] amen
[53:49] oh and i love this verse 8 then shall
[53:52] thy light
[53:53] break forth as the morning when are you
[53:56] shining brightest
[53:59] when when when you when you're
[54:00] acknowledging that we're the elect and
[54:02] and it not everyone can see this and and
[54:05] the message is only for those who
[54:07] ordained to it
[54:08] when do we shine our brightest when we
[54:11] gather to ourselves
[54:13] and pat ourselves on the back or when
[54:16] the poor who've been cast out
[54:18] are invited to the house of the lord
[54:19] amen when do we
[54:21] when do we shine the brightest when
[54:24] we're
[54:25] hoarding the bread that we've received
[54:27] or when we give it out to the hungry
[54:30] when do we shine the brightest when we
[54:32] wear the glorious raiment
[54:34] and the garbs of this gospel or when
[54:36] we're willing to cover the one that is
[54:38] naked
[54:39] the bible says then shall thy light
[54:41] break forth as the morning
[54:43] and thine health shall spring forth
[54:45] speedily
[54:47] you might think brother aaron this isn't
[54:48] really deep i could go get this in a
[54:50] baptist church well okay
[54:51] all right but if you want to go in a
[54:55] rapture
[54:56] don't think you're going to get there by
[54:58] being selfish
[55:00] and not living for others the bible says
[55:03] thine health shall spring forth
[55:05] speedily your physical health can be
[55:07] improved by living for others
[55:09] your spiritual health will be improved
[55:11] by living for others
[55:12] then will your light break forth as the
[55:14] morning thy health shall spring forth
[55:16] speedly
[55:16] and thy righteousness shall go before
[55:18] thee the glory of the lord shall be
[55:21] thy reward do you desire more glory
[55:24] glory then you
[55:24] humble yourself to break yolks you
[55:26] humble yourself to loose bands of
[55:28] weakness
[55:28] you humble yourself to undue burdens i
[55:30] will deal my bread to the hungry
[55:32] i will bring the poor that are cast out
[55:34] to my house i will
[55:36] cover the naked
[55:41] i will as james said do my part
[55:47] to minister to the wandering
[55:53] or using the figure the attitude of the
[55:57] priest and the levites
[55:59] the levite to this backslider
[56:03] and i want to close i i i have maybe
[56:06] almost a
[56:07] a lot more here but i i may close with
[56:09] just this last statement
[56:10] i want to read brother branham and if
[56:13] you could
[56:14] could you just uh maybe quiet yourselves
[56:16] for a moment and ponder this
[56:27] i was so moved by this
[56:30] i i want i want you to just focus now
[56:34] i'm going to read an interaction between
[56:37] brother branham and a young man
[56:40] and it's in a prayer line in 1954.
[56:44] and he says young fella if you come here
[56:47] just a minute a little closer to me if
[56:49] you will
[56:50] i suppose that we're strangers are we
[56:52] together i don't know you i guess this
[56:54] is our first time meeting in life
[56:56] but you realize that the very god of
[56:58] heaven and whose presence we're standing
[57:00] now
[57:00] will judge us both some of these days
[57:02] for what we have done
[57:04] and the way that we've treated his
[57:05] message and his son
[57:08] what what's sobering words and with
[57:10] trembling fear to stand in his presence
[57:12] that's how i stand here tonight
[57:14] wondering what he'll say it that day
[57:16] that's very humble on his part there's
[57:19] no arrogance being projected
[57:21] he's actually created this image with
[57:24] this young fella
[57:26] if he catches what brother brad is
[57:27] saying he's saying you may look at me
[57:30] as if i'm a great man on this platform
[57:33] and people think i'm a prophet i've got
[57:34] a dynamic gift and the dead are raised
[57:36] and hands are laid on them
[57:38] but one day we'll both stand shoulder to
[57:40] shoulder and be judged the same way
[57:42] don't think i'm any greater than you but
[57:45] i even though you might think that i'm a
[57:47] minister of the gospel and i'm more
[57:48] important but one day we'll stand
[57:50] shoulder to shoulder before god and i'll
[57:52] tremble in fear just as any man will
[57:56] and wonder what he'll say at that day
[57:58] what a grace
[57:59] to take a young fellow and say why don't
[58:01] you stand with me for a moment
[58:03] in the presence of god not leave him out
[58:06] there wherever he might have been
[58:08] and be the one who in the presence of
[58:10] god who reaches out from the presence of
[58:12] god
[58:12] with the voice of judgment but rather he
[58:14] takes the man
[58:15] who's standing there in need and he
[58:17] stands with them in the presence of god
[58:21] and then he says there's something
[58:22] strange about you i don't know but
[58:24] there's something somewhere
[58:26] that's not just exactly right it keeps
[58:28] turning black all around you and moving
[58:30] away
[58:31] every time i go to meet your spirit it
[58:33] moves back for some cause i don't know
[58:36] the audience will bear me record of this
[58:39] that there's something somewhere that i
[58:42] can't understand
[58:45] that god keeps pulling me back from you
[58:47] all the time
[58:50] and there's something somewhere that
[58:51] certainly
[58:53] he stops says jesus christ the son of
[58:55] god whose spirit is present
[58:57] to do all things and do all things well
[59:00] he says you are in trouble
[59:04] that's what the blackness is it's a
[59:06] trouble and it's not you
[59:08] it's in your home it's domestic
[59:12] it's your wife she's left you
[59:15] i've seen that blackness go away and it
[59:17] was your wife a woman that was once to
[59:19] your side
[59:20] has pulled away standing in blackness
[59:22] and that's what it is
[59:24] and here's another thing in this
[59:28] you have lost out your experience with
[59:31] christ
[59:33] now if i could emphasize this for a
[59:34] moment my voice is louder than brother
[59:36] branham's was
[59:38] i'm projecting prayer because of the
[59:40] room but i'm just talking to this man
[59:42] with a very gentle
[59:43] gentle voice you lost out your
[59:46] experience with christ
[59:48] you've backslid and went back on god
[59:52] now i want you to imagine that
[59:55] here's a man who's backslid
[59:59] and think of the indignation
[1:00:02] think of the fury think of the
[1:00:04] disappointment think of all the choice
[1:00:06] words that could be said
[1:00:08] but remember that backslid it can mean
[1:00:11] to be repulsed
[1:00:14] and here's a man who through his hurt
[1:00:16] his wife
[1:00:17] once at his side is pulled away and he
[1:00:19] says and you've lost
[1:00:20] out your experience with christ you've
[1:00:22] backslid and went back on god and then
[1:00:23] brother bear says
[1:00:25] come here brother he says just come
[1:00:28] closer
[1:00:30] don't i don't want you to be to sense
[1:00:34] any alienation i don't want you to feel
[1:00:38] distant from me the man of god so he
[1:00:40] says come here brother
[1:00:42] come closer maybe to embrace
[1:00:46] to take a hold of his shoulders to begin
[1:00:48] to lay upon him and pray for him
[1:00:50] and then he says kind heavenly father
[1:00:53] be kind and merciful and may thy
[1:00:56] spirit be upon this poor dear man
[1:00:59] your wandering prodigal
[1:01:04] what a sweet prayer sister elizabeth if
[1:01:07] you could come
[1:01:09] he says may he come tonight to the
[1:01:11] father's house
[1:01:13] and may he the father supply all
[1:01:16] and restore to him a double portion
[1:01:19] granted lord
[1:01:21] i send him on down the road now to meet
[1:01:24] you
[1:01:24] lord in the name of jesus christ
[1:01:28] amen and he says god bless you boy
[1:01:32] he says go home now throw all your
[1:01:34] habits and things away
[1:01:36] back in the sea of forgetfulness your
[1:01:38] sins are forgiven
[1:01:40] and now go and god will move and work
[1:01:43] with you
[1:01:44] he says god bless you my brother
[1:01:48] so glad these things were preserved
[1:01:52] so i could hear how a righteous man
[1:01:56] eyed the backslider how a righteous man
[1:02:00] could look upon somebody
[1:02:02] who wants to walk with god but now
[1:02:05] lost out their experience with christ
[1:02:08] backslid
[1:02:08] and went back on god and in that very
[1:02:11] moment where the blackness
[1:02:12] that was in his wife that caused her to
[1:02:14] leave him and this man through his own
[1:02:16] hurt
[1:02:17] has now also walked away and instead of
[1:02:19] brother branham saying you should have
[1:02:20] known better
[1:02:21] it proves that you didn't have an
[1:02:23] experience to begin with just because
[1:02:24] your wife went and played the part of
[1:02:26] the
[1:02:26] don't you realize you should have stood
[1:02:28] faithful that's where you made the
[1:02:29] mistake you wouldn't be standing here
[1:02:30] today buddy
[1:02:31] if you just would have sucked it up when
[1:02:33] she left it was nothing but a woman
[1:02:34] anyways
[1:02:35] where's your conviction where's your
[1:02:37] genuine experience instead of him doing
[1:02:39] that
[1:02:40] he says come here come here
[1:02:44] and he says kind heavenly father be
[1:02:47] merciful
[1:02:48] calls him a poor dear man he says your
[1:02:52] wandering prodigal
[1:02:55] what a different attitude we could have
[1:02:57] if we see somebody backsliding
[1:03:00] instead of them just leaving them to
[1:03:01] satan say lord is that your wandering
[1:03:05] prodigal
[1:03:09] brother adam in the sermon testimony is
[1:03:12] a man that stands before him
[1:03:15] and he says you look this way and he
[1:03:17] keeps telling the man to look at him
[1:03:19] i'll point it out as we go he says if
[1:03:21] you would look this way sir if you would
[1:03:22] just a moment
[1:03:23] now you realize my dear brother that
[1:03:24] when you confess your faith in christ
[1:03:27] it says to believe now with all your
[1:03:28] heart do you you do with all your heart
[1:03:31] and you have no doubt but the spirit
[1:03:32] that is here now that's even on you now
[1:03:35] there's no doubt
[1:03:36] but that it's the spirit of god it could
[1:03:39] not be any psychological effect or he's
[1:03:41] feeling sensing something supernatural
[1:03:43] it's just the spirit of god you see yes
[1:03:45] you believe with all your heart
[1:03:47] well you live close do you in this city
[1:03:50] here
[1:03:50] i would say he was i want you just to
[1:03:52] look again
[1:03:54] when you read through this you hear it
[1:03:55] it's as if the man's eyes keep wondering
[1:03:59] he says yes sir brother you have
[1:04:03] trouble with arthritis it's what bothers
[1:04:06] you isn't that right
[1:04:08] i see the way you get around i want you
[1:04:10] just to look this way
[1:04:11] and be just as sincere as you can
[1:04:15] and it struck me the fact that he had to
[1:04:17] keep getting this man to look at brother
[1:04:19] branham you realize
[1:04:21] there was some sense of shame in this
[1:04:22] man's heart
[1:04:25] that he couldn't even look at the man of
[1:04:26] god
[1:04:28] and he kept kind of looking away and and
[1:04:30] maybe his mind is drifting back to
[1:04:32] something else and i
[1:04:33] i found myself just entering into what
[1:04:35] this man must have felt in that moment
[1:04:39] and the burban says life hasn't been a
[1:04:40] flower bed of ease for you has it
[1:04:42] brother
[1:04:43] now i thought it was arthritis but now
[1:04:46] he says you've had lots of sorrows lots
[1:04:48] of troubles
[1:04:49] you're in trouble right now brother
[1:04:50] isn't that right
[1:04:53] at one time you wouldn't have come up in
[1:04:55] this prayer line
[1:04:56] you were an unbeliever once very much
[1:04:58] critical of religion is that right
[1:05:01] you did a great thing along that one
[1:05:03] time too something that hurt you
[1:05:06] i believed you rebuked god or cursed god
[1:05:09] or something
[1:05:10] and done something wrong didn't you do
[1:05:13] that
[1:05:14] how would you think brother by the
[1:05:15] spirit of god he goes is that a tract
[1:05:18] concerning it and brother branham was
[1:05:22] able to point out that this man had a
[1:05:25] tract on his person
[1:05:26] and if you read in a few paragraphs down
[1:05:28] i don't have time to do it tonight
[1:05:30] it said something along these lines if
[1:05:32] there's a god i
[1:05:33] curse him he says all right
[1:05:37] now concerning that it harmed you
[1:05:40] being that you had that on tracks he
[1:05:43] says again then look this way
[1:05:46] he says believeth all your heart you
[1:05:49] dearly paid for that brother
[1:05:51] you've had lots of troubles now nervous
[1:05:53] you've had lots of home troubles too
[1:05:55] don't you
[1:05:55] domestic troubles with your home is that
[1:05:57] right will you believe me as god's
[1:05:59] servant
[1:06:00] it's all right for me to speak what the
[1:06:01] lord says you've had other troubles too
[1:06:04] sexual troubles is that right sexual
[1:06:06] troubles says you listen to what i mean
[1:06:09] nobody but god alone knows that better
[1:06:11] than you is that right
[1:06:14] now what would your attitude be
[1:06:17] towards a man who wrote a track saying
[1:06:20] if there was a god i curse him
[1:06:23] who passed it out who has home
[1:06:26] trouble domestic troubles sexual
[1:06:29] troubles what would your response be
[1:06:32] what what how would the prophet now in
[1:06:35] this setting
[1:06:36] how would he approach this spirit and we
[1:06:38] would say oh
[1:06:39] it's got to rise up an indication has to
[1:06:42] rise up
[1:06:42] this is going to be the loudest prayer
[1:06:45] this is going to be the most
[1:06:46] forceful of laying hands on somebody
[1:06:48] this is the point when you get just as
[1:06:49] close as you can
[1:06:50] to beating the devil out of somebody as
[1:06:52] you ever do as a preacher and he says
[1:06:54] you believe me with all your heart
[1:06:56] he says let me have your hand
[1:07:00] let's bow our heads and he just brother
[1:07:02] bam says in this most sweetest way our
[1:07:04] heavenly father
[1:07:05] there's nothing but what you know all
[1:07:07] about him
[1:07:08] i'm so thankful that you're here tonight
[1:07:11] this poor old brother having to run and
[1:07:14] slip away to get to the service
[1:07:17] he says but loves you in his heart
[1:07:22] god make a way for him granted lord he's
[1:07:25] in trouble
[1:07:27] you said that you would be near those
[1:07:29] who are in need
[1:07:31] god bless my brother now as i bless him
[1:07:33] in thy name
[1:07:35] may all these troubles clear up like a
[1:07:38] cloud
[1:07:39] leaving from before the sun
[1:07:42] what humility what grace
[1:07:46] and may he be healed tonight of his
[1:07:48] arthritis
[1:07:49] and all these other troubles lord and be
[1:07:52] made new
[1:07:53] and whole again in the name of jesus
[1:07:56] christ the son of god
[1:07:58] i ask it
[1:08:01] now that's how brother branham dealt
[1:08:05] with
[1:08:06] really nasty cases a backsliders and
[1:08:10] even enemies of the cross
[1:08:15] and i think it speaks of how god deals
[1:08:17] with us in our weakness
[1:08:20] we can all relate that when we thought
[1:08:22] we really were going to get it god dealt
[1:08:24] with us kindly
[1:08:27] i was pondering it today and not to get
[1:08:29] too far into
[1:08:31] maybe some of these other characters
[1:08:34] but what was it the samaritan saw in
[1:08:36] this man that the priest and levite
[1:08:39] didn't
[1:08:41] and i thought what did he what did god
[1:08:42] see in me
[1:08:44] that nobody else could
[1:08:48] we see people sometimes as three-time
[1:08:50] failures
[1:08:52] in and out and we think oh they're used
[1:08:55] up
[1:08:56] but that samaritan saw something that
[1:08:58] nobody else saw that day
[1:09:00] and god sees something in you that maybe
[1:09:03] you don't even see yourself
[1:09:06] and his attitude isn't vengeance his
[1:09:08] attitude isn't one of punishment
[1:09:10] but it's remedial he wants to recover
[1:09:12] you he wants to restore you
[1:09:15] and i believe that ought to be our
[1:09:16] attitude too
[1:09:18] we can't sit back with arms folded with
[1:09:20] a critical eye towards everybody
