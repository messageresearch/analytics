[0:01] Ephesians
[0:06] 28 very um I I believe it's a very
[0:10] profound scripture especially for one
[0:12] that is seeking salvation one that is um
[0:16] entering into the body of Jesus Christ
[0:19] to understand
[0:21] how that there is no Hoops to it that
[0:24] there's it's not something where there's
[0:26] a bunch of rules to get into the body of
[0:29] Christ or to be saved but it's a very
[0:31] simple concept that has been laid out
[0:33] for us it says for by grace are ye saved
[0:38] through faith and not that not that of
[0:42] yourselves it is a gift of God let us
[0:46] bow our heads Heavenly
[0:49] Father Lord It's just such a privilege
[0:51] to be here and to Worship You Lord Jesus
[0:55] and fill your Holy Spirit Lord I ask as
[0:59] your word goes forth that you just take
[1:01] control of this service as you already
[1:03] have been father that whatever you need
[1:06] for us father that it may be sewed into
[1:09] our hearts this morning Lord Jesus that
[1:12] if we need more of you father if we need
[1:14] more strength if we need a deeper
[1:17] relationship whatever it might be father
[1:19] whether it's in the body father or
[1:21] whether it's something spiritual Lord I
[1:23] just ask that it may be imparted this
[1:25] morning Father God I ask that you just
[1:28] take away everything that is contrary to
[1:30] you father and Lord just allow your Holy
[1:33] Spirit to come and flow through the word
[1:35] Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:36] Christ we pray amen and amen amen you
[1:40] may be
[1:42] seated one one of uh the scriptures that
[1:44] helped me as a young man and I'm sure
[1:48] it's helped many people to understand um
[1:52] the the beautiful simpleness of how God
[1:56] brings his children into the fold um my
[1:59] message today is Grace through faith
[2:03] very simple one and I want to um really
[2:06] go into the thought of faith and it's
[2:09] something that brother Branham and we've
[2:11] heard many ministers talk about for
[2:13] years and ages how important faith is
[2:17] and um I'm sure we all know that there's
[2:20] a natural concept of faith in the world
[2:23] which which we all have in some degree
[2:26] and it's not something bad it's
[2:28] something that we use every single day
[2:30] but it's this natural Faith or belief
[2:32] it's it's considered important to people
[2:35] because it provides like a sense of
[2:38] purpose um whether it's it's in a higher
[2:41] power or whether it's in a self-belief
[2:44] or it's a set of principles it's
[2:47] something so that it gives us purpose it
[2:50] gives us hope it gives us strength in
[2:52] life it helps us navigate through
[2:53] challenges by offering comfort and
[2:56] guidance most of the time uh we we look
[3:00] at something else for a faith or belief
[3:03] but there's we know that it we can also
[3:05] look within ourselves and believe within
[3:08] ourselves now we're just talking about a
[3:10] a um overall belief system or overall
[3:14] faith that people have that a person can
[3:17] believe in themselves and this belief in
[3:19] oneself has it it's actually this is the
[3:22] age that this kind of belief in oneself
[3:26] it's it's dominant in this culture now
[3:29] to to where it it's it it this belief in
[3:32] oursel it gives us a personal
[3:35] development it it it helps us with our
[3:38] mental health it helps us with success
[3:40] so you you have to believe in yourself
[3:42] to be successful right uh there's a
[3:45] focus on on our self-esteem our
[3:47] self-love our
[3:49] self-realization especially with a r
[3:52] rise of these uh Wellness Industries and
[3:54] motivational speaking and personal
[3:57] coaching we have this faith or we have
[4:00] this belief that helps us out and um I'm
[4:04] going to out myself because I I don't
[4:06] want to out anybody else but I don't
[4:08] know who's ever listened to a
[4:09] motivational speech but man they're good
[4:12] yeah you know um I used to work in sales
[4:15] I needed that every single day because I
[4:17] wasn't in the sales where where you're
[4:19] you're calling somebody or somebody's
[4:22] going into a place to where they already
[4:24] want the product you just want to up the
[4:26] price a little bit no you're I was
[4:28] walking into businesses is to where
[4:30] there's a great big neon sign that says
[4:32] no soliciting yeah and somehow you have
[4:35] to forget about it and be like I'm going
[4:37] to walk in and I'm going to try to
[4:38] convince this person that doesn't want
[4:40] me there that they really need the
[4:43] product so you really need Faith then
[4:47] you really need a self-belief because I
[4:50] I've seen many grown men and women
[4:52] sitting in the car while I I was there
[4:54] coaching them and and supervising them
[4:56] and and they just could not get
[4:58] themselves to walk into a place because
[5:01] they didn't have the confidence in the
[5:03] product yeah not only that but they
[5:05] didn't have confidence in themselves so
[5:08] whenever they walked in they were
[5:10] already
[5:11] defeated it was almost the person the
[5:14] the CEO or the the the decision maker we
[5:16] had to talk to they were convincing them
[5:18] why the product wasn't good it's um
[5:21] something where everybody needs and and
[5:24] a lot of times you need those things
[5:26] motivational speaking to help a person
[5:29] out just so that you can go over there
[5:31] and act like you've known the CEO for 20
[5:34] years and say hey is Bill there I want
[5:36] to talk to him and never seen me in my
[5:38] in in his life ever but it's it's this
[5:43] selfconfidence that everybody is looking
[5:47] for this self-belief that everybody is
[5:50] striving for it's something that is
[5:53] good and even though this faith is good
[5:56] it's it it's a natural faith even though
[6:00] it's needed it's natural in Ephesians if
[6:03] you'd like to turn with me in
[6:06] um chapter 4 verse 4 and to 6 we're
[6:09] going to be reading a lot of scriptures
[6:11] if you don't
[6:13] mind Ephesians 4 4- 6 it says now there
[6:19] is one body and one Spirit even as ye
[6:23] are called in one hope of your calling
[6:26] one Lord one faith
[6:30] one baptism one God and Father of all
[6:33] who is above all and through all and in
[6:36] you all so this this broad thought of
[6:41] Faith it's a natural inherent faith that
[6:43] we all have but this one that Paul is
[6:46] speaking to the people he's saying this
[6:49] is one Faith yeah this is not the faith
[6:52] that we just believe in ourselves but
[6:54] this is a faith the
[6:57] faith it's separate from any any other
[7:00] belief any other thing that makes us
[7:02] confident anything else but it is a
[7:04] faith in Jesus Christ and it's one yes
[7:08] it's called the
[7:11] faith brother Bram he says this in in
[7:13] Blasphemous names and here he explains
[7:16] the statue of a perfect man really well
[7:18] and he he's explaining how in uh
[7:21] paragraph 142 he says patience and so
[7:24] forth there's a mockery of it it's a a
[7:28] pretending to be a nature given Faith so
[7:33] the faith that we inherit or the faith
[7:35] that's already in us or we build up in
[7:37] our character even though it's good it's
[7:40] still compared to the faith of God it's
[7:43] a mockery and it's a pretending to be
[7:46] right so that there is there is a
[7:48] genuine faith and then there is a
[7:51] mockery or a pretending to be a nature--
[7:54] giving Faith a nature virtue there's a
[7:58] nature given temp Temperance all these
[8:01] are nature given so it's not something
[8:04] it's it's already natural in us it's
[8:06] nature given but compared to this faith
[8:09] it is a mockery or pretending to be he
[8:13] says the biggest part of our faith is a
[8:16] mental Faith so this this pretending or
[8:19] this mockery it's still a big part of
[8:21] our faith and he says by hearing the
[8:24] word it brings us to a mental
[8:26] recognition of a God right so so it's
[8:29] good it'll take us to the door it'll
[8:32] make us realize yes there is a God above
[8:35] right but it's still a natural Faith but
[8:39] he says but if this coming from above oh
[8:43] brother if it ever strikes this there is
[8:46] a Godly spiritual
[8:49] Faith then what does it do the faith
[8:52] that recognizes the word no matter what
[8:54] anything else says it only recognizes
[8:57] the word because in the the beginning
[9:00] was the word and the Word was with God
[9:01] and the Word was God and the word is
[9:04] still God and the Word was made flesh
[9:07] and dwelt Among Us and when the word
[9:09] itself is pouring into our faith our
[9:13] mental Faith becomes a spiritual
[9:16] Revelation so we have a mental Faith
[9:18] it's good we we can uh help ourselves
[9:21] out with it but this faith that is given
[9:24] or is is from God it's from above and
[9:28] it's not something that we can conjure
[9:30] up but it is given from God it it's it's
[9:34] a faith that where we step right at the
[9:36] door then the word pours into our faith
[9:41] his word and his faith a spiritual faith
[9:44] that will believe in things that we can
[9:47] never see things that the world can
[9:49] never
[9:50] see so God God is not only the a giver
[9:54] of this Faith because he gives this
[9:56] faith we we do not conjure it up we
[9:58] cannot work ourselves from with this
[10:01] Faith it's a god-given faith just like
[10:05] the Bible says that we um where we read
[10:07] it says we are saved by
[10:11] grace through faith it is a gift of God
[10:15] so so this is all a gift this is all
[10:18] something that has been blessed upon us
[10:21] this Revelation is a gift to us so he's
[10:24] not only The Giver of the faith but he
[10:27] is also the author and the originator of
[10:30] our faith Hebrews 12:2 looking unto
[10:34] Jesus the author and the finisher of our
[10:36] faith who for the joy that was set
[10:40] before him endured the cross despising
[10:42] the shame and is set down at the right
[10:45] hand of the Throne of God so he is the
[10:49] originator of our faith which means the
[10:52] inaugurator the the leader the Pioneer
[10:54] or the Forerunner of our faith Jesus not
[10:59] only said that but he it's he is also
[11:02] the perfector yes he's also the
[11:04] perfector the one to complete it and
[11:07] we'll hit this a little later if God
[11:09] willing but it means that there's a
[11:11] beginning and a completion to our faith
[11:15] that it's not only just um something
[11:17] that you just believe in or something
[11:19] that you just receive and now you have
[11:21] it but you receive something from God
[11:25] and and now there there is almost a
[11:27] Capstone to it yeah there there there is
[11:30] a growth there's a growing in this
[11:34] Faith so so just to recap the this Faith
[11:39] isn't our self-esteem it's not our
[11:41] self-realization our self-love but it is
[11:44] salvation yes why do we need this Faith
[11:47] it's for our salvation of our souls the
[11:51] Redemption back to our original
[11:53] state that's why we need this Faith see
[11:56] all these other faith we can we can have
[11:58] faith in our ourselves faith in our
[12:00] family faith in this faith in that but
[12:03] this faith is in Christ Jesus very good
[12:07] this is the faith that believes in the
[12:09] word and nothing but the word amen this
[12:12] is that faith it was that faith that
[12:17] believed in the word that word that was
[12:20] made flesh and died for us Romans Romans
[12:26] 5 verses 1-2 it says
[12:31] and Paul really lays this out this is
[12:33] very um you you just start listening to
[12:36] Paul and this is him just shouting this
[12:38] out this whole time and and I believe
[12:40] it's because of the um the situation
[12:42] that he was put in and the situation he
[12:45] came out of that he had to really preach
[12:47] this and show them that Faith this this
[12:51] is it this is your salvation this is the
[12:55] way he says therefore being justified by
[12:58] faith we have peace with God through our
[13:01] Lord Jesus Christ now I I really enjoyed
[13:04] the the message hidden in profanity
[13:07] because brother Aaron was showing how
[13:10] God was separated from the people he was
[13:12] too
[13:13] Divine so he he came and became
[13:17] common he be became that and and this
[13:21] this faith that we believe in this man
[13:23] that became Prof profanity to us became
[13:26] common to us we were able to receive
[13:29] receive him and now through that faith
[13:31] we have peace with God the Untouchable
[13:34] the the one that we could not see the
[13:36] one that we could not even get close to
[13:38] now there's there's a connection
[13:41] made he says with God through our Lord
[13:44] Jesus Christ and he says by whom also we
[13:47] have access by faith into this grace
[13:51] wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope
[13:54] of glory of God so brother brandham he
[13:57] says a beautiful
[13:59] uh thing here and he he says it all over
[14:02] in a lot of his messages but here in
[14:04] Statue of a perfect man he says and the
[14:07] key is Faith the faith holds the key and
[14:12] the key is the
[14:13] scripture and Christ is the door see
[14:16] Faith takes the little hinges of the
[14:18] scripture and unlocks the glories and
[14:21] the good of God out to his people see so
[14:25] Faith holds the key and it unlocks
[14:27] Christ to the people unlocks it reveals
[14:31] it amen so through faith we can look
[14:34] upon his word and we begin to have
[14:37] access to the glories of God everything
[14:40] you need whether it's your salvation
[14:43] whether it's healing whether it's
[14:46] something from God now we have our faith
[14:49] to unlock the hinges of the scripture
[14:52] and now we have
[14:53] acces so so this salvation that God gave
[14:57] us many people say well Jesus Di died on
[14:59] the cross yet their faith is not
[15:02] accepting what they did what he did by
[15:04] the life that they live right so so in
[15:07] order to receive this Universal
[15:10] salvation that is given to all and not
[15:12] to a particular people he said for God
[15:15] so loved the
[15:16] world so he gave it to all but now it
[15:20] takes one of us it takes somebody with
[15:23] faith to accept the word and open up the
[15:26] glories of God to accept your salvation
[15:31] Amen to accept every promise that God
[15:33] has given you it's through the
[15:36] faith so we have access now to God now
[15:41] when we were once enemies with God now
[15:43] we have peace with
[15:45] them what a beautiful thing that that
[15:49] makes me happy because you know a lot of
[15:51] times we feel like oh God Jesus Loves Me
[15:55] Jesus and and we'll see that but the
[15:56] life isn't there it's it's not so much
[16:00] if I'd like to say this this way it's
[16:02] not so much the sacrifice that sets you
[16:05] free but it is the faith that is able to
[16:08] accept it right like brother brandham
[16:11] says a pardon is not a pardon unless
[16:13] it's
[16:14] received so it can be there at our
[16:17] doorstep for years and years and years
[16:19] and say oh I believe God thank you Lord
[16:22] and never receive it never just like
[16:25] brother brandham when he was talking
[16:26] about the token where you he he kind of
[16:29] gave this concept or this
[16:32] um this Narrative of a priest saying oh
[16:35] I believe God I I you know I'm the best
[16:37] of the best and I believe this but he
[16:39] never applied the token yeah and because
[16:42] he didn't apply the token he wasn't
[16:44] under the blood it's the same thing you
[16:48] know we want it but we have to receive
[16:50] it through
[16:52] faith amen
[16:56] so he he is the key or the faith is the
[17:00] key that opens up the scriptures or or
[17:02] faith is the hand that opens that is the
[17:05] key we see clearly that the source of
[17:08] faith is not found with us it's not
[17:12] within us faith is something that is
[17:14] given to us by God now
[17:19] um
[17:20] here in in
[17:23] Titus he says
[17:25] that if You' like to turn with me in
[17:28] first Titus in
[17:30] chapter I mean uh Titus 1 and 4 and then
[17:34] we're going to go to Jude 1 and 3 here
[17:37] here is this A
[17:39] peculiar situation going
[17:43] with with Titus and Jude where where
[17:46] they they explain faith and salvation as
[17:53] common and it's really helped me out
[17:55] really helped me study because the word
[17:58] profanity isn't in that word common
[18:01] which is I I believe a a
[18:04] Coos well so he says um to Titus my own
[18:08] son after the common Faith grace and
[18:12] mercy and peace from God the father and
[18:14] the Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior so this
[18:17] faith that is not found within us it's
[18:19] not something that we can just receive
[18:21] or conjure up it's something
[18:24] particularly given to us by God but yet
[18:28] in in a sense it is a common faith and
[18:32] and it's not so much where it is profane
[18:36] or it it's it's something where it's
[18:38] dragged up on the in the ground or
[18:41] something that people can conjure up but
[18:43] it means that it's readily available
[18:45] right that it's something that is
[18:48] universal that it's not given to a
[18:51] certain type of race or a certain type
[18:52] of people but it's given to the whole
[18:55] entire world yes it is a common faith
[19:00] and in Jude it says beloved I when I
[19:02] have given all diligence to write unto
[19:05] the common salvation it was needed for
[19:07] me to write unto you and exort that ye
[19:10] should earnestly contend for the faith
[19:13] which was once uh delivered unto the
[19:16] Saints brother brandham he says now also
[19:20] he promised that there would be a
[19:23] restoring of the faith not a faith we
[19:26] read over in Jude that he said in Jude
[19:29] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[19:31] once Del delivered to the Saints now we
[19:35] are promised in Malaki 4 by the same
[19:38] system he always had always did that we
[19:41] would be restored back to the original
[19:44] Faith right oh oh my back to the
[19:47] original seed back to the original seed
[19:50] like it in the be um began on the day of
[19:53] Pentecost back to the same Doctrine by
[19:56] word by word Power by power Spirit by
[19:59] Spirit the same thing so there was going
[20:02] to be a restoration of the gift and he
[20:04] said the common
[20:06] salvation and I and you know if anybody
[20:10] heard the message uh hidden in profanity
[20:13] there we see that God this Divine God
[20:17] that is separate from all of us he
[20:19] became common for us and and when I see
[20:24] this salvation and this faith it means
[20:26] that it has become this Divine thing
[20:29] that has been given from God from a
[20:32] place of Holiness from a place of
[20:34] separatism or or separateness a a place
[20:37] of that that we'll never see he comes
[20:39] and he stoop down to give us a Salvation
[20:43] that is readily available to each and
[20:45] every person that wants it and he gives
[20:47] us this thing called faith that anybody
[20:50] can
[20:51] have so we can receive this Faith this
[20:55] faith that is given by God so even
[20:57] though it's given by God he
[21:00] doesn't divide it and say you can't have
[21:02] it or you can have it but it's to
[21:04] whosoever
[21:05] will whoever wants this can receive it
[21:09] and believe in this salvation and be
[21:12] saved
[21:13] am so it it throughout the Bible this
[21:18] faith is presented as something that
[21:21] people are capable of having regardless
[21:23] of their background or race or status in
[21:25] the New Testament for example Jesus
[21:27] often emphasizes the need for faith in
[21:31] God in passages like in Matthew 17:20 he
[21:35] tells his disciples that e even if they
[21:38] have the faith as small as a mustard
[21:40] seed they can move
[21:41] mountains this suggests that the faith
[21:44] in some form is universally available
[21:47] and is fundamental part of a human
[21:49] experience that it's it's something that
[21:53] even though Lord I Have A Little Bit of
[21:54] Faith well that Faith you're able to
[21:57] move mountains with that Faith you can
[21:59] move forward with that Faith you can
[22:02] receive your salvation the faith that he
[22:04] gives
[22:05] you but this ability to believe in God
[22:08] or to trust in
[22:09] Salvation it's not something that we
[22:12] build up ourselves or something that we
[22:14] we conjure up in our minds so it's
[22:17] readily available but it's something
[22:19] that God himself is the author of this
[22:22] Faith amen this is where the distinction
[22:24] lies while Faith it's
[22:27] available it and it's required for
[22:30] salvation its source is an origin it's
[22:34] in a Divine place came from a Divine
[22:37] being faith comes from God as a result
[22:40] of his grace and without him people are
[22:43] unable to have a genuine faith that
[22:45] leads to
[22:46] Salvation so without this faith without
[22:49] this believing see we we can have a
[22:52] mental conception we can stand at the
[22:55] door and say yeah yeah he he's good he's
[22:59] right but without this faith that is
[23:02] readily available it's not something
[23:04] that we can separate from it's given to
[23:07] us without that we cannot have that
[23:10] genuine faith we can't have that genuine
[23:13] experience of Salvation until we receive
[23:17] that so this dual aspect of faith it
[23:20] it's it's ready availableness and the
[23:24] divine origin It reflects a a tension
[23:26] between God's sovereignty and the human
[23:30] responsibility there there's there's
[23:31] this tension where God he's given it to
[23:34] us yet we have a responsibility to
[23:36] receive
[23:37] it and and I I believe this is It's
[23:40] essential that's why you know I I'm sure
[23:43] everybody's heard when when I believe um
[23:46] Joel Olstein goes and talks to Oprah and
[23:48] he says well every everybody can be
[23:51] saved what about the gays or what about
[23:53] this or what about what about the Muslim
[23:56] well no everybody can be he he just he
[23:59] just messed up the
[24:00] formula because this faith is only in
[24:04] the word right this faith is only in
[24:07] Christ Jesus you can't have a form of
[24:11] Faith you can't have a form of of some
[24:13] kind of belief system that you think
[24:16] you'll be able to be saved without Jesus
[24:18] Christ right there's only one Faith
[24:21] right one God one Lord and that is in
[24:24] Christ
[24:25] Jesus so there's there
[24:29] it is the Gateway for our Salvation we
[24:31] are justified by faith not by works and
[24:34] even though this Faith might look like
[24:36] you're doing something it's a gift right
[24:39] it this even though it's a Gateway and
[24:41] you're it's needed it it gives us a
[24:44] responsibility that we need to believe
[24:46] it's not a work that you
[24:48] do it's a gift from
[24:51] God it's whenever we step up and we
[24:55] start having that desire we step up and
[24:57] say Lord I believe in you whatever
[25:00] mental conception we have God will see
[25:02] it and pour His word into us and give us
[25:07] that
[25:09] Faith so that's how we receive it says
[25:12] Romans 10:17 it says so then Faith
[25:16] cometh by
[25:17] hearing we can hear a lot of things we
[25:20] can hear a lot of
[25:22] people but Faith don't come by those
[25:25] things Faith cometh by the hearing of
[25:28] the word of
[25:30] God so we can receive Faith by
[25:32] motivational speaking but that's going
[25:34] to get us as as far as the open door to
[25:37] a CEO's office yeah that'll get us as
[25:40] close as a successful life to to uh if
[25:45] we need to work out or we need to do
[25:47] that it'll give us motivation to do that
[25:49] but this will take us all the way to
[25:52] Salvation only one Faith the faith in
[25:56] Jesus Christ
[25:58] and it's by the hearing of his word that
[26:00] we receive this whenever we go and we
[26:04] open our hearts that that's why I I
[26:07] believe these Services every service
[26:10] that where somebody can sit with an open
[26:12] heart and the word can be po poured out
[26:15] there's something happening even though
[26:18] maybe you don't see it physically
[26:20] somebody has opened their heart to the
[26:23] word and and there's going to be a
[26:26] spiritual transformation that nothing
[26:28] nothing else can
[26:29] give that is by the
[26:32] word now the most com well it's one of
[26:37] the
[26:38] most the scriptures that I talk about
[26:41] the most is John
[26:42] 1:1 in the beginning was the word in the
[26:45] word the word was with God and the Word
[26:47] was God verse two and the same was in
[26:51] the beginning with God all things were
[26:53] made by him and without him was not
[26:57] anything made that was made verse four
[27:00] he says in him was life yes and the life
[27:05] was the light of men now the scripture
[27:09] in 2 Corinthians 4:6 it says that for
[27:12] whom God commanded the light to shine in
[27:15] darkness hath shined in our hearts and
[27:18] give the light of the knowledge of the
[27:21] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[27:25] so the light this life is the the light
[27:28] of men and the Bible says it's the
[27:31] knowledge amen of the glory the lord
[27:34] Jesus Christ right so this this light or
[27:37] this life it's light to
[27:40] us so when this word comes which is the
[27:43] knowledge and we receive it it it lights
[27:46] up our life and what do we have we when
[27:49] the lights turn on now we have a
[27:52] visual understanding or discernment to
[27:54] see things far away and see things that
[27:57] are happening
[27:58] yes when at first we couldn't because
[28:01] just like in in uh I believe it's in 2
[28:05] Corinthians it says that that the
[28:08] Gentiles or it's in Ephesians where
[28:10] their understanding was
[28:13] darkened through on through and they
[28:15] because their understanding is darkened
[28:18] they being
[28:19] alienated from God right so they they're
[28:23] alienated from God and now their their
[28:26] understanding is darkened right so the
[28:28] light is the knowledge the light is the
[28:31] life right the darkness is the ignorance
[28:35] and and and here Paul is talking about a
[28:38] willful ignorance and it's because
[28:41] they're alienated from that light
[28:43] alienated from
[28:46] God so that's what that is receiving and
[28:49] and why I'm I'm trying to um paint this
[28:53] picture is because what we receive we
[28:57] begin to be transformed by this and when
[29:00] we receive the word of God we receive
[29:03] the light and we receive the
[29:06] life and the life is your eternal life
[29:10] it's your original state it's what you
[29:13] were there back then in the
[29:16] beginning and whenever you receive it
[29:19] you receive the light which is the
[29:24] life and it reminds me of John 3 316
[29:28] where it says for God so Lov the world
[29:30] that he gave his only begotten son that
[29:32] whosoever
[29:34] believeth so God he could give his son
[29:37] to the world he did and it wasn't for a
[29:40] specific people he said for God so loved
[29:43] the
[29:43] world that whosoever believeth that's
[29:46] the
[29:47] caveat whoever believes in him whoever
[29:51] trust and believes in this Jesus Christ
[29:54] that was slain those are the ones that
[29:57] are SA
[29:58] saved 17 it says for God sent not his
[30:01] son into the world to condemn the world
[30:04] but that the world through him might be
[30:07] saved he that believeth on him is not
[30:10] condemned but he that believeth not is
[30:14] condemned already because he hath not
[30:17] believed in the name of the only
[30:19] begotten Son of God so this Faith it's
[30:23] powerful your faith it's necessary for
[30:26] your salvation
[30:28] the belief in Jesus Christ the belief in
[30:32] the word that's what gives you your
[30:34] salvation not anything
[30:36] else we can pile up rules we can pile up
[30:39] things we can pile up a bunch of Hoops
[30:41] that you have to go through but when you
[30:44] go down
[30:45] to the essence of it it's through your
[30:49] faith in Christ
[30:52] Jesus in the begotten son and not only
[30:56] in the son that was slain there but the
[30:59] S the one that was tooken off the cross
[31:03] put into Hell Rose up the third day went
[31:06] up to the right hand of the father came
[31:09] down on Pentecost all the way down to
[31:11] the ages and is here now that's the son
[31:15] that we're believing in not in a history
[31:18] not not in a thought but in a son that
[31:20] is actively a gift that is
[31:24] active a gift that you know I don't know
[31:27] if you've ever received received a gift
[31:28] but where it's like man I really like
[31:31] that gift but it's probably all messed
[31:33] up already or the the chocolates that g
[31:35] they gave you in your birthday well you
[31:37] like well that was a nice gift I
[31:39] appreciate it but it's it was way back
[31:41] when that's not the gift of Jesus Christ
[31:45] we we don't have to look back then and
[31:47] say oh praise God for that but it's the
[31:50] Jesus Christ now today that keeps on
[31:53] working that that sacrifice is still
[31:55] working today
[31:58] yes he says he that believeth or or here
[32:02] on 19 it says and this is the
[32:04] condemnation now he explains what the
[32:06] condemnation is right so he first he
[32:09] says he that believeth not is condemned
[32:12] already right now he says this is the
[32:14] condemnation let me explain it to you he
[32:17] says the light is come into the world
[32:21] and Men love Darkness rather than light
[32:24] because their deeds were evil so the
[32:27] light the knowledge the truth the word
[32:30] came into the world and Men loved the
[32:33] darkness what they love to be alienated
[32:36] from God they love the ignorance they
[32:39] don't want anything with the gospel they
[32:40] don't want anything with the word and
[32:43] because of that there is
[32:46] condemnation the reason I'm saying that
[32:48] is because when we believe when we don't
[32:51] want anything to do with the the willful
[32:53] ignorance we step into the light which
[32:56] is our salvation
[32:59] John 8:32 he says and ye shall know the
[33:02] truth and the truth shall make you free
[33:06] so this light is the knowledge the truth
[33:08] the word it'll make you free and the
[33:11] amount of Truth is the amount of
[33:14] Freedom the the the amount of life is
[33:18] the amount of light that we have in our
[33:20] life that's why we can see throughout
[33:22] the ages there was an amount of light
[33:25] there was portions of light but now
[33:28] we've had a prophet that said good
[33:30] morning good morning why the fullness of
[33:33] the light what does that mean the
[33:35] fullness of the truth and the more light
[33:38] you have the more freedom the more truth
[33:42] that you know the more freedom that you
[33:44] have it's not the truth shall make you
[33:47] free but knowing the truth having a
[33:50] knowledge of the
[33:52] truth that's what makes us free we are
[33:55] in the most tremendous age because we
[33:58] have that yes where we're not living in
[34:01] in in in a shadow we're not living in in
[34:04] a light that is reflecting we're living
[34:06] in the fullness of the word the fullness
[34:08] of the
[34:09] truth to where it'll not only just get
[34:12] us in a Justified State not only get us
[34:14] in another state but it will take us all
[34:16] the way back to the original
[34:19] condition that's what this truth does
[34:22] and when we believe it we step into the
[34:25] light yes whosoever beli believeth they
[34:29] shall not be condemned whosoever trusts
[34:32] in God this one
[34:35] Faith Romans 1:16 to18 he says for I am
[34:40] not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for
[34:43] it is the power unto
[34:46] salvation there's not a period there to
[34:48] everyone that believeth so there's a
[34:51] power to Salvation if you have the key
[34:55] if you have that access if you have that
[34:59] right away to that
[35:01] salvation when you have that Faith you
[35:05] have that power of
[35:06] Salvation he says to the Jew first and
[35:09] also the Greek for there is the
[35:13] righteousness that is revealed from
[35:15] Faith to Faith as it is written the just
[35:18] shall live by faith 18 He says for the
[35:22] wrath of God is revealed from Heaven
[35:25] against all ungodliness and
[35:26] unrighteousness unto man who hold the
[35:29] truth in
[35:32] unrighteousness here in the Cambridge
[35:35] commentary they say explains revealed
[35:39] from Faith to Faith he says it is
[35:42] unfolding and displays faith and only
[35:45] Faith as its
[35:47] Secret at each
[35:50] disclosure the initial step the entrance
[35:53] to just Faith to Faith the faith is also
[35:58] the life of a
[35:59] Justified of the Justified is maintained
[36:02] by the faith so faith is the starting
[36:05] point and the course yes that's why he
[36:08] is the author and the finisher there is
[36:10] a growth there's a faith to Faith to
[36:14] Faith where he is the author there is a
[36:16] start your initial Faith starts there in
[36:19] justification and then as you move on
[36:22] into your life as you grow into the
[36:24] light maybe you've received a little
[36:26] light maybe you've received a little
[36:29] truth and as you receive more and more
[36:33] the light gets more and more until you
[36:36] are perfected in faith
[36:38] amen I believe that the bride is stepped
[36:41] into the dawn yes but but individuals
[36:46] individuals are still receiving that
[36:48] light some are still stepping out of
[36:51] Lady oia some are still getting out of
[36:54] of a a stage of bondage through doctr
[36:57] through all these things and stepping
[36:59] into the
[37:01] light how through the word of God Amen
[37:05] Faith through faith through faith
[37:08] through
[37:09] faith so righteous righteousness where
[37:12] when you see you're justified by faith
[37:14] it's righteousness you have been made
[37:18] righteous so righteousness is deemed
[37:21] through faith man that that puts a lot
[37:24] of burdens off of our
[37:26] shoulders try trying to live something
[37:28] that we can never live something that we
[37:32] try to expectation that we make in
[37:34] ourselves we we take it
[37:37] out we believe and because we believe
[37:41] it's been imputed unto you
[37:44] righteousness then the fruits of the
[37:46] spirit
[37:47] come then then the fruits of the spirit
[37:50] just as Paul was talking to the
[37:52] Galatians he said there there's it's not
[37:54] a work of the flesh but it's a fruit yes
[37:56] amen it's something that just comes
[37:59] after you believe in Christ Jesus yes
[38:04] am so there's that righteousness is
[38:07] deemed through faith but here in verse
[38:10] 18 He says unrighteousness or sin is
[38:14] deemed through unbelief brother Bram Mo
[38:17] says sin is
[38:18] unbelief he says that the wrath of God
[38:22] is
[38:22] revealed from Heaven against all
[38:25] ungodliness and unrighteousness to those
[38:28] who are um of men who hold the truth in
[38:33] unrighteousness holding the truth let's
[38:35] not think of unrighteousness of of some
[38:38] kind of act but brother brandham says is
[38:41] unbelief we're Justified righteous by
[38:44] faith and we are condemned by unbelief
[38:48] and we we can hold this in
[38:52] unrighteousness it says the revelation
[38:54] of righteousness is while the the
[38:57] Apostle writes being made the person of
[39:00] Christ and salvation offered by him and
[39:02] the revelation of Wrath is to be
[39:04] inferred as an actual condition a
[39:07] degradation by doubly being degraded
[39:11] when we don't
[39:12] believe are just like the fruits of the
[39:15] spirit through faith we begin to walk
[39:18] into the spirit we begin to change why
[39:21] because we
[39:22] believe you're not going to do something
[39:24] that you don't believe in right and
[39:27] nobody has to force you into something
[39:30] that you 100% when no questions asked
[39:33] you believe in it why does somebody have
[39:36] to force me into it I'm stepping into it
[39:38] cuz I
[39:40] believe and when we hold it with
[39:42] unbelief there there's a degradation
[39:44] trying to hold on to it yet our life
[39:47] crumbles and crumbles and
[39:49] crumbles here here um there's a plain
[39:52] example of of what unbelief does here in
[39:55] Matthew where Matthew Matthew 13:57 to
[39:59] 58 he says and they were offended in him
[40:02] because Jesus said unto them a prophet
[40:05] is not without honor save in his own
[40:08] country and in his own house and he did
[40:12] not many works there because of their
[40:15] unbelief right because of
[40:18] unbelief we we almost
[40:21] stop the glory of God through unbelief
[40:25] we we stop God so
[40:28] my my uh title was going to be the the
[40:32] wrong
[40:34] belief but I realized that there's only
[40:38] one Faith so if if we we believe wrong
[40:41] or we're believing in the wrong thing it
[40:43] means we're not believing and we we
[40:46] don't have the the faith we might have a
[40:49] faith but we don't have the
[40:51] faith so so whenever we don't believe
[40:56] there's almost a chain
[40:58] there's a cut off from God's
[41:00] glory there's a cut off from God's
[41:04] Miracles brother brandham he says in the
[41:06] ministry explain he says somebody says
[41:09] how does Divine Healing is it does it
[41:12] last all the time brother brandham says
[41:15] it lasts as long as your faith lasts and
[41:18] salvation lasts the same way just as
[41:21] long as your faith lasts when you feel
[41:24] that you're not saved anymore you're not
[41:26] saved
[41:27] for by Grace you are saved through Grace
[41:30] is that right now I know this is a very
[41:33] you can go either way and there can be
[41:36] condemning there but but this Satan he
[41:40] loves what he loves to do is attack the
[41:42] mind of the people and try to make us
[41:45] not believe and make us feel
[41:49] somehow what is that word Gaslight us
[41:51] into not
[41:53] believing into feeling like like we
[41:56] don't we don't really believe yeah yet
[41:59] we're here every Sunday we're we're
[42:02] we're standing on the word we believe in
[42:04] the Lord we we trust in him and every
[42:06] but somehow we don't believe because he
[42:07] said
[42:10] so I I I don't think I think the devil
[42:14] is attacking us because we do
[42:16] believe I think the devil attacks us
[42:19] because we are standing where we're
[42:20] supposed to
[42:23] stand the Bible in Hebrews 11:6 it says
[42:27] without faith it's impossible to please
[42:29] him so so why does is it impossible
[42:33] because we alienate ourselves from that
[42:35] light we we flee from the one that is is
[42:39] trying to help us
[42:41] right so um I I preached this I think a
[42:46] few Wednesdays ago of how um brother
[42:49] Brandon was talking to Sister Bruce and
[42:52] she was just all in a distraught State
[42:55] how she thought she did didn't believe
[42:57] and he says you do believe you are a
[42:59] Christian right and it's just how the
[43:01] devil will get a Christian a son and a
[43:03] daughter of God into a bind and feel
[43:06] like oh Lord I I don't believe I don't
[43:08] believe I don't believe when you do
[43:11] believe it's just the devil wants to
[43:14] amen make us feel like we don't believe
[43:18] if he can take the belief out of the
[43:20] word out of Salvation then he's got
[43:24] us but I I believe it's more subtle than
[43:26] that that th this this uh not believing
[43:32] and not being saved I I believe the
[43:34] devil wants to just like in the Garden
[43:37] of Eden present another
[43:39] thought present another concept it's not
[43:43] so much a struggling within yourself of
[43:46] you've been standing on the word and and
[43:48] you're struggling on can I believe or
[43:50] not but it's presenting another thought
[43:53] that is almost more enjoyable or more
[43:57] enticing than the thought of the
[44:00] word that's what the devil did he didn't
[44:02] go over there and beat up Eve and she I
[44:04] don't know if I believe or not she she
[44:07] he just gave her better ideas yeah hm I
[44:10] never thought of that I never thought
[44:13] that way I never seen it this way to the
[44:17] point where where she brother brandham
[44:20] says it's a beautiful scripture and
[44:22] conflict or a beautiful quote conflict
[44:25] between God and saying he says but you
[44:28] have to ignore before in order to
[44:30] believe the devil's lie you have to
[44:33] ignore and deny God's truth
[44:36] first first before you have to believe
[44:39] the devil's lie you ever you ever think
[44:42] of that you have to deny the truth first
[44:45] before you could believe a lie right you
[44:48] have to deny it so first there has to be
[44:52] a better concept A Better thought a
[44:54] better Doctrine a better way of seeing
[44:56] the word trying to take Christ out of
[44:59] the church and when we can do that then
[45:03] what we do is is we handle the truth in
[45:06] unrighteousness and
[45:09] unbelief twisting the word because of
[45:12] the devil and not being able to receive
[45:18] salvation brother brandham I I mean uh
[45:21] Paul he has a struggle with the
[45:24] Galatians what a beautiful scripture I
[45:27] was um reading it while I or listening
[45:30] to it while I was at work and just just
[45:32] relising to it and man the struggle that
[45:34] he had with these these beautiful group
[45:37] of
[45:38] people where where he even said oh you
[45:41] foolish Galatians he he wasn't playing
[45:43] around yeah I I thought he was bad on
[45:45] the Corinthians but you go to the
[45:47] Galatians and he's over there you
[45:49] foolish
[45:50] Galatians yeah yeah who who be witched
[45:53] you who Put a Spell on You yeah how by
[45:57] their
[45:59] words he says oh foolish Galatians in
[46:02] gal uh Galatians 3:1 to 3:1 he says oh
[46:05] foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you
[46:08] that you should not obey the truth
[46:10] before whose eyes Jesus Christ had Jesus
[46:14] Christ has been evidently set forth
[46:17] crucified among
[46:18] you now this is an amazing it reminds me
[46:22] of the the messages we've been hearing
[46:24] because if if we go to the New Living
[46:27] Translation this is how he says it oh
[46:30] foolish Galatians who has cast a spell
[46:31] on you for the meaning of Christ death
[46:35] was made clear to you as if you had seen
[46:38] a picture of his death on the
[46:41] cross he laid out such a picture by his
[46:45] words and by his preaching that they
[46:47] could clearly see the death of Jesus
[46:51] Christ on the
[46:52] cross he painted it with the words of
[46:55] the Lord and He he said how how how are
[46:58] you now denying this picture yeah how
[47:01] are you denying this portrait of Jesus
[47:03] Christ who has Bewitched you what what
[47:07] happened was these people that were free
[47:11] they were called to be free from the law
[47:13] free from sin free from all these things
[47:16] somebody
[47:18] came with at that time was the word of
[47:21] the Lord at one point it was God's
[47:25] word came in
[47:27] and said well we're Jews and you need to
[47:31] be
[47:32] circumcised you need to be you need to
[47:35] follow the law you need to follow the
[47:38] traditions of of what we've we' have
[47:41] done for years and years just like in
[47:43] the law of
[47:44] Moses and these people weren't Pharisees
[47:47] that didn't give their heart to the Lord
[47:49] they were saved by the same Grace the
[47:52] ones that were given it to them and they
[47:54] were living like Gentiles yet they
[47:56] wanted to in in uh impart and and press
[48:00] these people in circumcising themselves
[48:02] and putting all these Traditions onto
[48:05] themselves and somehow they were
[48:08] Bewitched in doing those
[48:11] things he
[48:14] says he says in in three uh chapter 3 in
[48:18] verse 2 and 3 he says for this only I
[48:21] would learn of you now he's asking a
[48:23] question he's I want to ask you
[48:25] this receive the Spirit by The Works of
[48:28] the law or by the hearing of the faith
[48:31] he's asking how did you receive the Holy
[48:33] Ghost he's not talking to newborns he's
[48:36] not talking to to somebody that just
[48:37] came in he's talking to those that have
[48:40] received the spirit and he saying how
[48:43] did you receive it through faith through
[48:46] the
[48:47] law he says oh ye are so foolish having
[48:51] begun in the spirit how how through
[48:55] faith
[48:56] are now perfected by or you are made
[48:59] perfect by the flesh so so what what
[49:02] happened is they received the word they
[49:05] received what they needed but they they
[49:07] begin to adopt different different
[49:11] thoughts right different doctrines to
[49:14] where it's like now you have to do this
[49:16] in order to be saved you have to do this
[49:18] in order to be accepted you you have to
[49:20] do these certain things and and Paul
[49:23] says you are making Christ void
[49:27] you are denying the
[49:29] faith in Galatians 5:1 he says Stand
[49:33] Fast therefore in the Liberty praise God
[49:37] Amen that's where we're at yes amen you
[49:40] are free you're free from condemnation
[49:43] you're free from all those things and
[49:45] and now he's telling these people you uh
[49:48] Stand Fast in the Liberty where with
[49:51] Christ had made us free and be not
[49:53] entangled again with the Yoke of bondage
[49:56] behold I Paul say unto you that if you
[49:59] be
[49:59] circumcised Christ shall profit you
[50:03] nothing so the danger in believing in
[50:06] something else outside of the word voids
[50:10] Christ from our
[50:11] life when we when we don't receive the
[50:14] word because that is the light what we
[50:17] do is we dim the light and
[50:19] now the
[50:21] knowledge cuz you shall know the truth
[50:23] and it shall make you free now now
[50:25] you're going back into
[50:27] bondage because you're rejecting the the
[50:31] knowledge you're rejecting the freedom
[50:35] amen he says Christ will profit you
[50:38] nothing for I testify again to every man
[50:41] that is circumcised he is a debtor to
[50:44] the whole
[50:45] law Christ is become of no effect unto
[50:50] you and me I I started to think how a
[50:54] shift in belief it's not not struggling
[50:57] to
[50:59] struggling even though you believe but
[51:01] it's a shift in
[51:04] belief yes switching even though the the
[51:07] freedom can be preached throughout these
[51:10] years in this
[51:11] Pulpit if there's a shift in belief we
[51:14] can throw ourselves back into the same
[51:16] thing we came out
[51:19] of he says Christ is become of no effect
[51:23] to you whosoever of you are justified by
[51:26] the law we are fallen from
[51:29] Grace what a powerful thing just because
[51:33] we change the belief we we want works we
[51:36] we want to justify ourselves by works we
[51:38] fall from
[51:41] grace and we hold the truth in
[51:44] unrighteousness for we through the
[51:46] spirit wait in Hope of righteousness by
[51:48] faith for in Jesus Christ neither
[51:51] circumcision availeth anything nor
[51:53] uncircumcision but Faith which worketh
[51:57] by
[51:59] love now just like he says healing as is
[52:03] as long as your faith lasts salvation is
[52:05] the same
[52:06] thing here he says that circumcision it
[52:10] aileth nothing there there's it's all
[52:13] it's it has no value when you are
[52:16] standing in
[52:18] faith but here he's also saying that if
[52:21] you're circumcised you're making Christ
[52:23] void the uh Christ shall not profit you
[52:27] nothing if if you circumcise and you
[52:29] justify Yourself by the
[52:33] law and here you can clearly see in in 1
[52:36] Timothy here in closing 1 Timothy 4:1 he
[52:40] says now the spirit speaketh expressly
[52:42] that in the latter times they shall
[52:43] depart depart from the faith so there's
[52:46] a departing from the faith how giving
[52:48] heed to seducing spirits and doctrines
[52:50] of devils so that's the only way we can
[52:53] depart from Faith it's not the struggle
[52:56] that you have every single day believing
[52:58] in the word standing in the word the
[53:00] devil will try to make you disbelieve
[53:02] but it's when we turn into a a doctrine
[53:06] of a devil seducing Spirits seducing
[53:09] thoughts seducing things that not make
[53:13] us make us think oh well I never thought
[53:16] of that I never seen it that way and
[53:20] it's away from the light of God away
[53:22] from Christ
[53:24] Jesus now it's it's an amazing thing how
[53:27] Paul is telling all these people but in
[53:29] in Acts there was one time where uh Paul
[53:33] and Timothy were going to the Jews and
[53:36] he tells Timothy
[53:38] hey you need to be
[53:40] circumcised even though he's telling all
[53:42] these people don't be
[53:44] circumcised it's it's going to it's
[53:46] going to void Christ in your
[53:49] life but it's because the belief behind
[53:52] the
[53:53] ACT they they believed and they did the
[53:56] act and it voided Christ in their life
[53:59] but here Paul as he said to the Jew I
[54:02] have become a Jew right to the Gentiles
[54:05] I become a gentile to those that are
[54:07] weak I become weak and they knew they
[54:09] were going into a Jewish community and
[54:12] and uh Timothy his father was a Greek
[54:15] his mother was a a Jew and I believe
[54:18] with the mother if you have a mother
[54:20] that's a Jew then you are part of the
[54:23] the culture you're part of you are a Jew
[54:27] so they knew if they walked in there
[54:29] without him being
[54:30] circumcised that it would offend them
[54:33] that it would hurt them so they said you
[54:37] have to be circumcised so that we can
[54:38] become like them so that we can take
[54:40] them out of the mud that they're in
[54:43] right right then there's another
[54:45] situation where Titus didn't want to get
[54:49] circumcised even he was not compelled to
[54:52] be circumcised when he was talking to
[54:54] the Galatians
[54:56] because he was full Greek and he would
[54:59] have offended the Gentiles and hardened
[55:02] their
[55:03] hearts so so it's not the ACT it's not
[55:08] well you you have you have to have a a
[55:10] tie while you're up here right well you
[55:13] you have to do certain things and we
[55:16] create certain structures certain things
[55:19] and and that almost determines your
[55:22] salvation with certain doctrines that
[55:24] don't even it availeth
[55:28] nothing you can do it you can't you
[55:30] don't have to do it but there's people
[55:32] that will do it and because of their
[55:35] belief they turn away from Christ and
[55:37] they are
[55:39] condemned there's another instance in
[55:42] Romans where he's talking about the man
[55:44] that the the people that are weak in
[55:46] faith he calls them he says when you go
[55:49] to those people because you have the
[55:52] freedom you know that you can eat
[55:53] anything you want and these people are
[55:55] subject to herbs and all of that because
[55:57] of their Traditions don't go over there
[56:00] and eating a big old steak and saying oh
[56:02] look at my freedom but understand that
[56:06] these people are in
[56:08] bondage in bondage by some kind of
[56:10] thought some kind of uh belief system
[56:14] which e even though they still believe
[56:16] in Christ they still believe in Christ
[56:18] for salvation there's certain things
[56:20] that if they stop doing it they will be
[56:23] condemned in their eyes
[56:26] he even says in in Romans 14:22 he says
[56:31] hast thou
[56:32] Faith have it um have it to thyself
[56:35] before God he's telling the man that
[56:37] that is full of Faith he's like do it
[56:39] for God don't flaunt yourself and hurt
[56:41] other
[56:42] people he said happy is he that
[56:45] condemneth not himself in the thing that
[56:47] which he
[56:48] alloweth he that douth is damned if he
[56:52] eat because he eateth not of faith whato
[56:56] ever is not of faith is sin right so
[56:59] this person that that is indoctrinated
[57:02] with certain things if we try to present
[57:04] something and it condemns them or they
[57:06] feel like they're condemned they are
[57:09] condemned because they leave the faith
[57:11] and they believe that they are not saved
[57:13] anymore
[57:15] right it it's it's where we have to
[57:18] stand in Liberty become a Jew to the
[57:21] Jews become a gentile to the Gentile
[57:24] become weak to the weak and bring those
[57:27] in and not being Tangled by any of these
[57:30] seducing spirits that try to void the
[57:34] Jesus Christ in his word if You' like to
[57:37] stand with
[57:39] me I just um I added this
[57:43] quote it felt just so needed but if the
[57:47] musicians would like to come he
[57:49] says it's God manifest in flesh now in
[57:54] the flesh of his bride
[57:56] so now it's not we're not talking about
[57:58] a historical
[57:59] Jesus he's now in the flesh of his bride
[58:03] for the bride and the husband is the
[58:04] self same flesh these two are one and
[58:08] the church is becoming the bride and all
[58:12] all the time by believing the
[58:15] word so she she's she's stepping into
[58:18] the bride she's stepping into the light
[58:20] by believing right not by anything else
[58:24] the the word could be presented to us
[58:27] but it's whenever we begin to believe
[58:29] and take it in we begin to step into our
[58:32] position Faith after Faith after Faith
[58:36] after Faith until Christ will come and
[58:39] perfect our faith until he will come and
[58:42] say Well done Son Well Done daughter and
[58:46] it's by believing the Simplicity of the
[58:50] word cuz he's hi hidden in this even
[58:53] though just as brother Aaron's been
[58:55] saying he is the complex God that we'll
[58:58] never be able to understand he gives it
[59:00] to us in such a way we can receive it
[59:03] anyone Amen Let Us bow our
[59:08] heads Heavenly
[59:11] Father Lord we're just so thankful for
[59:14] this faith that you have given us Lord
[59:17] that's only been been departed by you
[59:21] even Jesus when he was in his flesh he
[59:23] says flesh and blood has not re revealed
[59:26] this to you but my father that is in
[59:28] heaven not even Jesus himself in the
[59:31] flesh but it was a spiritual
[59:34] Revelation from God and Lord we know we
[59:38] have that father we just ask that we
[59:41] hold this truth and we we stand on this
[59:45] truth that not only ourselves can be
[59:47] transformed into the very image into
[59:51] into your likeness but father our
[59:52] families and those around us can see
[59:55] that light and receive it also father
[59:57] Yes Lord you are that light you are the
[1:00:01] life you are the knowledge and you've
[1:00:03] given it to your people father so they
[1:00:05] become the light of the world yes
[1:00:08] they're the ones that impart that
[1:00:10] knowledge they're the ones that show the
[1:00:13] light show the truth everywhere they go
[1:00:17] father Lord I ask that you just bless
[1:00:19] each and every person the name of the
[1:00:21] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen
[1:00:25] hallelujah yeah brother
