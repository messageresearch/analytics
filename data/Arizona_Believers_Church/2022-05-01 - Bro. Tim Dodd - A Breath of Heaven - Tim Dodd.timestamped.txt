[0:00] ephesians chapter 4 is a chapter that i
[0:03] another chapter after psalms 25 i got
[0:05] into ephesians 4
[0:07] and
[0:08] i don't really know how it started
[0:11] but i just began to read some verses
[0:13] here and it really
[0:15] really
[0:16] touched my heart
[0:18] about
[0:19] a month ago
[0:21] and i just touched on it in a service at
[0:23] home and then i went to germany and then
[0:25] i came back and i ministered on it again
[0:28] and
[0:29] and just this past wednesday night
[0:30] actually and the song was appropriate
[0:33] because i want to
[0:34] title the message tonight a breath of
[0:36] heaven
[0:37] a breath of heaven
[0:39] let's read ephesians chapter 4.
[0:42] now ephesians 4 is a great chapter
[0:45] the book of ephesians is a great book
[0:47] and uh you know it's ephesians parallels
[0:50] joshua
[0:51] that god is calling it a foreign
[0:53] ephesian church in these last days a
[0:55] mature church a church that is matured
[0:57] in the word of god and and uh ephesians
[1:00] 4 starts out with one lord one faith one
[1:03] baptism and and then goes down through
[1:06] the the fivefold ministry the gifts to
[1:08] the body and the purpose of the gifts
[1:10] and and then it comes to being renewed
[1:14] in the spirit of your mind and maybe
[1:16] just to get the context let's pick it up
[1:19] at verse 23
[1:20] and it says and be renewed in the spirit
[1:22] of your mind
[1:24] and that you put on the nuke man which
[1:26] after god is created in righteous
[1:29] true holiness
[1:31] all right so it's not it's not just
[1:33] talking about the new birth it's talking
[1:36] about a molding process
[1:38] it's talking about a maturing it's
[1:39] talking about the effect of the word in
[1:42] your life read the whole chapter when
[1:43] you go home you'll see all of that and
[1:46] so he says
[1:47] wherefore put away lying putting away
[1:49] lying speak every man truth with his
[1:52] neighbor for we are members one of
[1:53] another be angry in sin not let not the
[1:56] sun go down upon your wrath neither give
[1:59] place to the devil
[2:00] let him that stole steel no more but
[2:03] rather let him labor working with his
[2:05] hands the thing which is good that he
[2:06] may have to give to him that needeth let
[2:10] no now here's where we're going to start
[2:12] our text here let no corrupt
[2:14] communication proceed out of your mouth
[2:18] but that which is good to the use of
[2:21] edifying i touched on that this morning
[2:23] building up not tearing down
[2:26] that which
[2:27] is good to the use of edifying that it
[2:29] may minister grace unto the hearers
[2:33] we often quote this next scripture and
[2:35] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[2:37] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[2:40] your of redemption so notice now he's
[2:42] talking about corrupt communication and
[2:45] edifying to those that are sealed by the
[2:47] holy ghost
[2:48] he's not talking to unbelievers here he
[2:51] says and grieve not the holy ghost
[2:53] whereby you're sealed unto the day of
[2:54] your redemption and then this next
[2:56] scripture is powerful let all bitterness
[3:00] and wrath
[3:01] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[3:06] be put away from you
[3:08] with all malice
[3:11] he's talking to people that have been
[3:13] scarred up
[3:14] he's talking to people that
[3:16] bear the after effects of some battles
[3:20] he says put these things away from you
[3:22] and be ye kind one to another
[3:26] tenderhearted
[3:28] forgiving one another even as god for
[3:32] christ's sake has forgiven you
[3:34] lord add his blessing to the word you
[3:36] may have your seats
[3:40] i was
[3:42] talking this morning about the power of
[3:43] the holy ghost in the lives of the
[3:45] believers
[3:46] and how that you have
[3:49] enough power within you the power of the
[3:50] resurrection is already within you and i
[3:52] thought i just actually read the quote
[3:54] uh tonight it's from ever-present water
[3:57] from the rock spoken in 1961
[4:00] and brother branham speaking here he
[4:02] says when we die our souls will go under
[4:04] the altar of god
[4:06] where i was privileged to see a few
[4:08] mornings ago
[4:10] as you know in the vision where the
[4:13] bible speaks of
[4:14] our spirits will go to god who give it
[4:18] and our bodies shall return to the dust
[4:21] of the earth
[4:23] now there's a whole you could take that
[4:25] first sentence our souls will go under
[4:27] the altar of god
[4:29] if you actually
[4:31] trace that back to the old testament
[4:33] tabernacle which altar is that
[4:37] it's not the altar of sacrifice
[4:40] i don't believe it's the altar of
[4:41] incense either
[4:43] i believe it's right under
[4:45] the mercy seat
[4:47] that all turn and so
[4:49] uh nevertheless that's a whole nother
[4:51] subject
[4:52] of the types of the old testament
[4:54] tabernacle
[4:56] so he says here our spirits will go to
[4:58] god who give it our bodies we'll return
[5:00] to the dust of the earth but someday
[5:02] where the scripture is fulfilled our
[5:03] spirits will be released from god will
[5:05] pick up the soul and the soul to the
[5:07] body and the power that will raise us up
[5:09] is right in us now
[5:11] we are now in heavenly places we are now
[5:14] in the power of the resurrection
[5:16] now
[5:17] i know there's some watching the service
[5:19] by way of streaming who have even asked
[5:21] me the question
[5:22] where do our spirits go when we die we
[5:25] know where our souls go here's your
[5:27] answer
[5:29] all right right laying right here in
[5:30] this quote
[5:32] and i greet everyone that's also
[5:34] streaming online god bless you
[5:36] this is an international service tonight
[5:39] so you know there's people in africa
[5:41] streaming in different places so god
[5:44] bless you they send their greetings and
[5:46] we greet them in return
[5:48] amen now he says so brother branham says
[5:51] we are now in heavenly places we are now
[5:53] in the power of the resurrection if
[5:55] there wasn't a law to that
[5:57] sons and daughters of god would create
[6:00] them a world out here and go live a
[6:02] private life on it
[6:04] i would want to
[6:06] amen i'm out of here
[6:08] you know i'm going to make my own world
[6:10] that's what we do in type
[6:13] we get a home
[6:14] we set up a home
[6:16] we we try and make it nice we create an
[6:18] atmosphere is that right you know we
[6:21] want to have the right atmosphere in the
[6:22] home
[6:23] the wife takes care of the house the
[6:25] husband comes home from work to that
[6:27] place of atmosphere and you know kept
[6:30] all lovely and at peace you know that's
[6:32] the inner yearning but that's speaking
[6:34] of something even greater that's going
[6:36] to be one day he says you have power to
[6:38] do it you've got if you've got the
[6:40] shadow of a
[6:42] shadow of the power of god in you you
[6:44] got power to do it god is omnipotent see
[6:48] what i mean the power that's in you you
[6:50] could speak a world into existence and
[6:53] go live on it
[6:54] that's what power is in the church now
[6:57] but it's controlled by a law and that
[6:59] law is not the keeping of a bunch of
[7:01] commandments it's the law of faith
[7:04] jesus said all things are possible to
[7:06] them that believe if you can believe it
[7:09] whatever god will lead your soul to
[7:11] believe that is yours you say amen to
[7:14] that every place the souls of your foot
[7:17] can set upon by faith god gives it to
[7:20] you what is that that's the book of
[7:22] joshua he says amen it's yours you
[7:24] possess it if you can find the key to
[7:27] this law of faith that opens
[7:32] controlled by if you're a son or
[7:34] daughter of god listen now if you're a
[7:37] son of god you are a daughter of god
[7:40] that never leaves you
[7:43] it's with you all the time
[7:46] but your faith gets away from it
[7:50] but it's still there
[7:53] you see when you feel low when you feel
[7:56] weak when you feel distance from god
[7:58] it's not that his power has left you
[8:01] it's that your faith has decreased
[8:04] you see and if you get into the right
[8:06] channel of inspiration whatever the holy
[8:09] spirit will lead you to believe when
[8:11] you're born again sealed by the holy
[8:13] ghost until the day of your redemption
[8:16] then that is yours by the revelation
[8:19] that loses the power of god within your
[8:22] life isn't that wonderful
[8:24] amen we know we go through ups and downs
[8:26] we have seasons in our life we we have
[8:28] seasons where it seems like god is so so
[8:31] far away and we have seasons when it
[8:33] seems like god is so near it's just
[8:35] really what our faith is walking with
[8:38] right now and how god is dealing with us
[8:40] individually and even as ministers and
[8:42] but i'm sure all of you understand this
[8:44] but as ministers many times we will we
[8:47] will get under an anointing or an
[8:49] inspiration and you feel like a superman
[8:52] because it seems like you could just do
[8:55] anything you could pray for anybody and
[8:57] they'll be delivered and you know that
[8:59] you could say anything in my would just
[9:01] move the people and inspire them but
[9:03] what is that there's no difference in
[9:05] the power of god there is different
[9:07] anointings don't get me wrong but
[9:08] there's no difference in the power of
[9:10] god in you you're already a superman
[9:14] you're already a superwoman
[9:16] but what maybe isn't super is your faith
[9:20] all right so your faith sometimes
[9:22] doesn't catch the full extent of the
[9:24] power that lays in you and as i said god
[9:27] doesn't always release that he didn't
[9:29] release the revelation of the rapture
[9:31] until the last days because it's only in
[9:34] the last days that the rapture is to
[9:36] come to pass that's why there's
[9:38] rapturing faith laying within the
[9:40] message of the hour because that's part
[9:42] of the message of the hour you see as i
[9:44] said this morning this is a love message
[9:46] to his bride it's the song of solomon
[9:49] god saying come away my loved one come
[9:51] away it's a it's the voice of god crying
[9:54] through the
[9:57] seeing you what does that mean like
[9:59] looking in a glass darkly the voice of
[10:02] god speaking to you and it's becoming
[10:04] clearer and clearer because it's a love
[10:06] letter that's why this message can't go
[10:07] to the jews actually some people think
[10:09] the message of the hour is going to go
[10:11] to the jews it's not because it's a
[10:13] different relationship this is a
[10:15] protestant
[10:16] the jews are not bride the jews are
[10:19] brethren it's the same atonement don't
[10:22] get me wrong it's the same atonement of
[10:24] calvary that during the tribulation time
[10:27] their eyes will become open to what
[10:29] christ did for them two thousand years
[10:31] ago as they as the scripture says they
[10:33] will say where did you get those
[10:35] handprints those prints in your hands i
[10:37] got them in the house of my friends
[10:39] you see and so they'll realize that
[10:41] christ died for them and what that will
[10:43] do is the messiah that they think is in
[10:46] the future they will realize was
[10:48] actually in the past
[10:50] and it will change their attitude
[10:52] towards the atonement and realizing that
[10:54] their messiah has already come and their
[10:56] redemption is already here and that's
[10:58] why brother branham said that the
[10:59] seventh trumpet is to the jews what the
[11:02] seventh seal is to the bride because
[11:04] what the seventh seal does for us is the
[11:06] same thing is that it changes our
[11:08] attitude towards the atonement it
[11:11] reveals the mysteries laying in the
[11:13] atonement that's already paid for
[11:15] because every promise in the book every
[11:17] blessing the inheritance all things are
[11:20] already paid for at calvary
[11:22] there's not something in addition that
[11:24] needs to be paid for but what the
[11:26] opening of the word does it changes our
[11:28] attitude towards what christ has already
[11:31] done for us we realize we're not just
[11:33] church goers we're not just sinners
[11:35] saved by grace but now by the opening of
[11:37] the word we understand we always were in
[11:40] his thoughts before the foundation of
[11:42] the world we realized that there were
[11:44] these certain mysteries that were held
[11:46] back that would loose the faith which
[11:49] would in turn lose the power within the
[11:51] church that will even change these
[11:54] mortal bodies
[11:55] it'll create a resurrection it'll bring
[11:57] the church from the ages up through the
[11:59] uh up from the grave and bring us into
[12:01] the fullness of our inheritance
[12:04] in the message future home he says
[12:07] heavens and earth have met
[12:09] god and man is reconciled
[12:12] a restored eden has begun
[12:14] see all the curse is gone just like all
[12:17] the curse of sin
[12:19] when the holy ghost accepts you
[12:21] all right so he's described in the new
[12:23] heavens and new earth but then he he
[12:25] types it to what happens in your life
[12:28] he says
[12:29] all the curse of sin is gone when the
[12:32] holy ghost accepts you
[12:34] notice how he says that
[12:36] you don't see he says you don't accept
[12:38] it
[12:39] it accepts you
[12:43] because it's god's attribute
[12:45] see if it's the holy ghost means god's
[12:47] spirit
[12:49] and it's the attribute the thought of
[12:51] god has accepted you
[12:53] because that you were ordained
[12:56] for that purpose there's a thought this
[12:58] morning
[12:59] see you was born in sin but god had that
[13:02] attribute
[13:03] and here you expressed yourself here on
[13:06] earth and he comes down and gets you
[13:11] see you're back here
[13:13] here's where you belong so he's showing
[13:15] two different places you're back here
[13:17] but here's where you belong
[13:19] he says see sins lost its power
[13:22] that's right the desire of sin has gone
[13:25] from your heart
[13:27] when the holy spirit comes in
[13:30] you are a restored person
[13:33] and then when the earth is restored by
[13:35] the same thing there can be no more
[13:37] cursing no more storms no more winds no
[13:40] more typhoons rather you're reconciled
[13:43] god and man has met
[13:47] see that's what god's doing in our lives
[13:48] right now he's taking the storms out
[13:51] he's taking the typhoons out you see
[13:53] you're already sealed to the day of your
[13:55] redemption but you got to realize the
[13:57] storms of your mind
[13:59] by the revealing of the word that's why
[14:01] a prophet had to go up on the mountain
[14:03] and speak to the storm
[14:06] showing that even in this message lays
[14:09] the power to rebuke every storm
[14:12] amen
[14:14] all right so
[14:17] now
[14:20] i was thinking about
[14:22] not this song but there was a song that
[14:23] was sung
[14:25] uh
[14:26] in our church recently of
[14:29] a special i think was last sunday
[14:32] actually
[14:33] a couple of sisters saying it and the
[14:34] the first sign was something like i long
[14:37] to breathe the breath of heaven
[14:41] and when soon as they sang that
[14:45] i thought there's my title
[14:48] there's my thought that crystallized
[14:52] as i was thinking about this scripture
[14:54] here
[14:56] i was in ethiopia just a month ago
[14:59] six weeks maybe
[15:01] kind of lose track of time sometimes
[15:03] things happen so fast
[15:06] but
[15:07] i was in the capital city of addis ababa
[15:10] and i was in the hotel and
[15:12] i was
[15:14] feeling a little i wasn't really short
[15:16] of breath
[15:17] but i was feeling like the breath just
[15:19] didn't satisfy like i was not getting
[15:21] enough oxygen
[15:22] you ever felt that brothers or sisters
[15:24] you know we feel like you know it's just
[15:26] something not right i thought it was
[15:27] something wrong with my heart it's
[15:29] something wrong with my lungs you know i
[15:30] was kind of questioning myself and of
[15:33] course i would never share this with my
[15:34] wife till after the fact but you know uh
[15:37] so i was just kind of like
[15:39] i wasn't lightheaded
[15:41] i wasn't anything like that
[15:43] i wasn't really even that tired it was
[15:45] just like
[15:47] i just wanted to breathe a deep breath
[15:49] you know
[15:50] i just wanted to inhale it and uh and i
[15:53] thought what is causing this what is
[15:55] what is uh
[15:57] making me hindered from
[16:00] not feeling air the way
[16:02] that i would like to i've i've had coven
[16:05] matter of fact i just had it a couple
[16:06] weeks ago
[16:07] and didn't really affect my lungs or
[16:09] anything like that so it wasn't covered
[16:11] or anything like that but as i was
[16:15] pondering that that was in the city of
[16:17] addis ababa and i began to think about
[16:20] pollution
[16:21] and i was thinking about now in in
[16:23] ethiopia anybody here ever been to
[16:25] ethiopia
[16:26] all right well anybody know any
[16:28] ethiopians
[16:30] no we're striking out this this evening
[16:33] now the ethiopians have quite a ceremony
[16:36] that they have with coffee
[16:38] i think maybe that's why we're kindred
[16:40] spirits
[16:42] and
[16:43] they they take the raw coffee beans they
[16:45] say the ethiopian bean is the best in
[16:47] the world and they take the raw bean and
[16:49] they cook it in their house over live
[16:51] fire
[16:52] it's it's got to be like live coals or
[16:55] or wood or something that they they'll
[16:57] burn inside the house
[16:59] okay and then they'll roast the beans
[17:01] there for about 15-20 minutes and then
[17:03] they'll grind them
[17:05] uh
[17:06] with a mortar and pestle i think that's
[17:07] the right word isn't it and then they'll
[17:09] they'll they'll cook the coffee with
[17:11] that
[17:12] and that it's delicious it's wonderful
[17:14] coffee but it's it's quite a ceremony
[17:17] for them so this goes on everywhere so
[17:19] now you have to picture
[17:21] there's live coals burning inside
[17:23] buildings
[17:24] there's not a barbecue going on outside
[17:26] this is going inside
[17:28] so this smoke
[17:29] this pollution permeates everything
[17:33] and uh and and then you add on the
[17:36] traffic and the car pollution and all
[17:38] these kind of things and i'm just
[17:39] thinking this air in addis ababa is not
[17:41] pure
[17:42] you know it just
[17:44] i just can't get any satisfaction out of
[17:46] it and and the meetings moved to the
[17:48] city of hawassa which is about five six
[17:50] hours south and and uh uh we had some
[17:54] meetings there and hawass is more of a
[17:55] resort city
[17:57] and uh it's beautiful green country on
[18:00] the side of a lake so the air is very
[18:02] clean and there's less population and
[18:04] all that kind of stuff and it's much
[18:06] more open and
[18:07] and when i got to hawasa this is how i
[18:09] knew it was the pollution when i began
[18:11] to breathe the air of hawasa
[18:14] then i thought oh there it is
[18:17] you know just inhale it
[18:18] that that just felt so good in my lungs
[18:22] just a little bit cleaner air
[18:24] but what will it be brothers and sisters
[18:27] that first breath in heaven
[18:33] when we open our lungs and just
[18:35] what will that taste like
[18:38] what will it be i was thinking of a baby
[18:39] that's born
[18:41] that you know comes out of the womb and
[18:43] doesn't know what air is
[18:45] knows what oxygen is because it's
[18:46] getting it from mama but comes out of
[18:48] the womb and sometimes it has to be
[18:50] spanked in order to cry out and to take
[18:52] a deep breath of air
[18:54] and begin human life but what will it be
[18:56] when we start that life over there
[18:59] when we finally get to heaven and take
[19:02] that great breath
[19:04] and that that satisfying portion and
[19:06] when we get to heaven
[19:08] every breath that you take will be the
[19:11] word of god
[19:13] because that's all that's over there
[19:16] it's just the word of god and it'll be a
[19:19] wonderful uh experience i believe and
[19:22] one day when we get there and we realize
[19:26] there's going to be a rapture here first
[19:27] but when we get on the other side at the
[19:29] marriage supper of the lamb
[19:31] one day that all that was caused by this
[19:34] civilization will be no more
[19:37] there'll be no more war in that
[19:39] civilization
[19:40] there'll be no more pollution in that
[19:43] civilization there'll be no more crime
[19:45] over there
[19:47] you won't have to lock your door
[19:49] praise the lord you won't have to turn
[19:51] your alarm on
[19:53] you won't have to lock your cars and
[19:54] make sure that everything's put away out
[19:56] of sight and that sort of thing there'll
[19:58] be no more of that praise the lord
[19:59] there'll be no more cars
[20:01] that'll be wonderful
[20:03] we realize we'll be able to travel in a
[20:05] thought there'll be no more death and
[20:06] sorrow the scripture says
[20:08] in the new heavens and the new earth
[20:10] bible says in revelation 21 god shall
[20:12] wipe away all tears from their eyes and
[20:15] there shall be no more death
[20:17] neither sorrow
[20:20] amen sister snow i was thinking of you
[20:23] the this afternoon as i was going over
[20:25] these thoughts
[20:27] we know what sorrow is death
[20:29] is sorrow
[20:31] partying death is separation
[20:33] and we realize we don't sorrow as the
[20:35] world's sorrows and that as them that
[20:38] have no hope we realize that we'll see
[20:40] our loved ones again
[20:42] but nevertheless it never makes it easy
[20:45] if you've ever had to go down that road
[20:48] you realize this is not easy
[20:51] and but one day there'll be no more
[20:53] sorrow
[20:54] because there'll be no more separation
[20:56] hallelujah his bible says there'll be no
[20:59] more crying
[21:01] neither will there be any more pain
[21:05] well there's a few of you that know what
[21:06] that is
[21:08] there'll be no more pain
[21:10] there'll be no more aches when we get
[21:12] out of bed in the morning i read a
[21:13] statement this afternoon it was
[21:15] interesting
[21:16] says you know fellow said when i was 12
[21:19] years old
[21:20] says i could i could ride my bike down
[21:23] the street crash my bike roll through
[21:25] the gravel get up off the road and and
[21:28] walk home for miles
[21:31] says but now that i'm 50 if i lay on my
[21:34] bed on the wrong way on the wrong pillow
[21:37] he says i'm paralyzed for two days
[21:42] but one day there'll be no more pain
[21:44] amen one day there'll be no more sorrow
[21:47] oh it'll be glorious it'll be nothing
[21:48] but the word over there nothing but the
[21:51] pure word of god if i say it this way
[21:53] there'll be no more spiritual pollution
[21:58] now god is calling us to the restoration
[22:01] that he's bringing because what he's
[22:02] bringing is a restoration of eternity
[22:06] oh you ever think about what brother
[22:07] brown said let me read what he said
[22:09] first before i go into it he says he
[22:11] says the great chain of perfection was
[22:13] broken by time space
[22:16] time be time came because of sin
[22:20] he says
[22:21] there's a little grou a little gap comes
[22:23] down breaks over this way goes out that
[22:26] way god had to do that because satan
[22:28] caused it it dropped down to a space of
[22:31] time for the trying and the perfecting
[22:34] and the purging of the lost
[22:36] that god by his sovereign grace might
[22:39] someday lift up that little hickey or
[22:41] gap
[22:42] back into the perfect circle
[22:45] then she rolls on just the same he says
[22:48] now time is this little loop that loops
[22:51] down
[22:52] jesus was from eternity to eternity but
[22:55] he stepped into the time spaces
[22:58] made flesh and came through here in
[23:01] order to sanctify or put a streak of
[23:04] blood all across this place to redeem it
[23:08] and connect it back with god again for
[23:11] all eternity
[23:12] you see it he says that's all time is
[23:16] amen so as i was speaking this morning
[23:18] about the integrity god is restoring the
[23:21] integrity of eternity
[23:24] god's bringing us back into that perfect
[23:26] integrity he's bringing us back to that
[23:28] perfect perfection but also do you
[23:30] realize that in this realm that we call
[23:32] time this is the realm that grace has
[23:35] expressed
[23:37] because the angels eternal angels don't
[23:39] know what grace is
[23:41] they don't understand grace they don't
[23:43] understand god as a healer because
[23:45] they're never sick
[23:46] they don't understand god as a provider
[23:48] because they're never in need
[23:50] they're just in a realm that's perfect
[23:52] perfection we're going back to that
[23:54] realm but now i want to say it this way
[23:56] do you realize right in the realm that
[23:58] we're living in because of sin and
[24:00] because of god redeeming back to himself
[24:03] that which was lost in time do you
[24:05] realize that there's mysteries in
[24:07] eternity that are not mysteries here
[24:11] grace is a mystery to the angels
[24:14] healing is a mystery to the angels but
[24:16] it's not a mystery to you hallelujah we
[24:19] had to come into this realm so god could
[24:21] express himself
[24:23] in attributes that that could not be
[24:25] expressed in a perfect eternity so he
[24:28] had to allow satan to rebel in heaven
[24:31] take a third of the angels come down
[24:33] into a time realm that he has a space of
[24:36] time and one day the devil and his
[24:38] angels will all be destroyed
[24:41] praise the lord there will be one last
[24:43] fire
[24:44] amen and that fly into that fire goes
[24:46] every sin into that fire goes every
[24:48] fallen angel into that fire goes
[24:50] everything that was never in the mind of
[24:52] god or everybody that's straight from
[24:54] the mind of god and god will dump it all
[24:57] into the lake of fire to be annihilated
[24:59] one day
[25:00] how long will it take brother brahma
[25:02] says i don't know could be millions
[25:03] could be billions of years but it will
[25:05] come to an end because they don't have
[25:08] eternal life
[25:10] amen but we have been called back to
[25:13] eternity god is bringing back all that
[25:16] was lost
[25:18] everything in time that will that is
[25:20] god's will be touched by the redemptive
[25:23] blood of jesus christ and one day
[25:26] brother adam calls it a scarlet thread
[25:28] and god will pull that scarlet thread
[25:32] and everyone that is attached to that
[25:34] scarlet thread will be pulled back into
[25:37] the perfection or into the integrity of
[25:40] eternity hallelujah it's and we're right
[25:44] near the end of that great purpose right
[25:46] now
[25:48] that
[25:49] god is preparing to annihilate all
[25:52] spiritual pollution
[25:54] sin from every dimension will be
[25:56] annihilated in the lake of fire
[25:59] but the scripture here
[26:02] is commanding us now
[26:05] and i'll just say it this way
[26:06] do not let spiritual pollution come out
[26:09] of your mouth
[26:14] i'm just gonna bring it right down to
[26:16] where we live now
[26:18] all right it's nice to talk about the
[26:20] eternities and the wonderful purpose of
[26:22] god
[26:24] but i want you to
[26:25] really ponder this this evening and let
[26:27] the holy spirit speak to you
[26:30] because god
[26:32] he says let no
[26:34] corrupt
[26:35] communication
[26:37] proceed
[26:38] out of your mouth
[26:41] let me say that again let no
[26:44] corrupt
[26:45] communication
[26:47] proceed out of your mouth all of us here
[26:49] would want to bow our heads now and say
[26:51] lord forgive me
[26:54] there's not one of us that would ever
[26:56] say we've always spoken perfectly
[26:59] we're all guilty of this
[27:01] but the commandment is
[27:03] don't let it happen. you see a word is a
[27:07] thought expressed
[27:09] and if there's a corrupt communication
[27:12] proceeding out of our mouth then there's
[27:14] something in our minds
[27:16] that is not quite right
[27:19] because of pressure and stresses
[27:22] because of feeding on wrong things
[27:25] if you fill your minds with spiritual
[27:27] pollution
[27:29] i'll say it this way then you're going
[27:31] to have spiritual bad breath
[27:38] i try and say something every service
[27:40] that you'll remember
[27:44] the next time someone says something
[27:46] that they should not say
[27:48] you just look at him and say you have
[27:49] bad breath
[27:53] someone's being naked has a negative
[27:55] confession instead of a positive
[27:56] confession
[27:57] you know what you got bad breath
[28:00] spiritual bad breath
[28:02] spiritual pollution
[28:04] let no corrupt communication now it's
[28:06] corrupt communication is not just things
[28:09] that you know we say bad against people
[28:12] but it's a negative
[28:14] confession it's that's why the bible
[28:17] says in in philippians i believe it is
[28:19] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[28:21] things are holy whatsoever things are of
[28:23] a good report let me
[28:25] let me pick it up first in philippians
[28:27] chapter two
[28:28] it says it says in chapter 2 and verse 5
[28:31] let this mind be in you which was also
[28:34] in jesus christ
[28:36] who being in the form of god thought it
[28:38] not robbery to be equal with god but
[28:40] made himself of no reputation and took
[28:43] upon him the form of a servant and was
[28:45] made in the likeness of men and being
[28:48] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[28:51] himself and became obedient unto death
[28:54] even the death of the cross my you know
[28:59] here was god himself dwelling bodily in
[29:01] flesh but yet he humbled himself as a
[29:04] man made himself no reputation took upon
[29:07] himself the form of a servant
[29:09] was mishandled many times was misspoken
[29:12] to was called names many times was
[29:16] smitten suffered 40 lashes did not
[29:19] revile back
[29:21] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[29:23] of your mouth there was no pollution in
[29:25] the mind of jesus christ he knew exactly
[29:28] who he was he knew exactly what his
[29:30] purpose was on earth he knew exactly
[29:32] what he was sent for he knew exactly
[29:35] even said the disciples it's necessary
[29:37] that i fall into the hands of
[29:38] unbelievers why because he had to go to
[29:41] the cross there had to be a fulfillment
[29:43] of scripture and so he would not revile
[29:46] them and even hanging on the cross in
[29:48] the depths of sorrow forsaken by
[29:51] everybody a man of sorrow acquainted
[29:53] with grief he hung there on the cross
[29:56] and says father forgive them
[29:59] they don't know what they're doing
[30:01] they don't understand they don't know
[30:03] who i am and they don't know who they
[30:05] are
[30:07] amen
[30:08] that's why the bible says in philippians
[30:10] 4 and i'll go there i've started there
[30:12] but
[30:13] philippians 4 and 6 it says be careful
[30:16] for nothing
[30:18] all right
[30:20] now this is a good one for sisters
[30:24] i know because i have one i happen to be
[30:25] married to one
[30:27] be careful for nothing that means be
[30:30] worried about nothing
[30:35] amen amen
[30:39] sometimes our sisters the weaker vessels
[30:43] are given to worry
[30:46] and you don't need to
[30:49] i'll say it sisters you don't need to
[30:51] worry the bible admonishes us don't
[30:54] worry about anything
[30:57] how can i do that brother tim it doesn't
[30:59] stop there it says but in everything
[31:03] not some things everything
[31:05] by prayer and supplication
[31:08] with thanksgiving
[31:10] let your requests be made known unto god
[31:14] amen
[31:15] don't worry about it pray about it and
[31:18] when you pray about it committed to god
[31:21] and brother brown says there's nothing
[31:23] so great as a committal
[31:25] and when you commit something to god
[31:26] that means you let it go and if you let
[31:28] it go then you don't worry about it
[31:32] amen
[31:33] he says and the peace of god which
[31:35] passes all understanding shall keep your
[31:37] hearts and minds through christ jesus
[31:41] not just your hearts but your minds
[31:45] brothers i'd picked on the sisters but
[31:47] i'll say sometimes brothers can be a
[31:49] little bit too stressed out about things
[31:50] too
[31:51] amen
[31:53] and but it says it says here
[31:56] if you want the peace of god this is the
[31:58] approach you take and he shall keep your
[32:01] hearts and minds
[32:03] through christ jesus then he says
[32:05] finally brethren now here we go
[32:08] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[32:10] true
[32:12] whatsoever things are honest
[32:15] whatsoever things are just
[32:18] whatsoever things are pure
[32:21] whatsoever things are lovely
[32:24] whatsoever things are of a good report
[32:27] if there be any virtue if there be any
[32:30] praise you will not find them on social
[32:33] media i'm sorry it doesn't say that but
[32:35] it says think on these things
[32:40] amen
[32:41] what uh what's what now
[32:43] read this when you go home put it up on
[32:45] your fridge write it out for yourself
[32:46] put it on your phone whatever it might
[32:48] be only things that are pure let those
[32:51] things into your mind
[32:53] whatsoever things are of a good report
[32:55] let those things in your mind now i
[32:57] don't know what this church is like
[32:58] because this is my first time here and
[33:00] this morning was my first service
[33:02] amongst you but
[33:03] you know some churches get to knowing
[33:06] each other so well that we know one
[33:07] another's hinder parts
[33:10] we know one another's bad traits did you
[33:12] know that there is bad traits about
[33:14] everybody
[33:16] i realize except you
[33:18] but everybody else
[33:20] there's bad things about them and and if
[33:23] you allow yourself you can focus on
[33:25] their bad things
[33:27] all right you can allow yourself to look
[33:30] at their bad parts look at their
[33:31] mistakes know about their history know
[33:34] about their past but the bible says
[33:36] don't think on those things because in
[33:38] everybody there is also good things
[33:41] especially the sons and daughters of god
[33:44] there's there there's something that god
[33:46] sees in each and every one of you that's
[33:48] a part of himself think on those things
[33:52] i'm not getting 100 percent here yet
[33:53] we'll just stay on the subject
[33:55] god wants you to just
[33:57] see one another the way he looks at you
[34:02] look at your brother look at your sister
[34:04] through the blood of jesus christ
[34:06] i appreciate what brother biscuit did
[34:08] one time
[34:10] in a service he was
[34:12] he took his bible and
[34:16] i do it sometimes overseas and he he
[34:18] finds the middle of the bible there's
[34:20] usually a page
[34:22] he says here's here's the page between
[34:25] the old testament and the new testament
[34:28] and he says on this side abraham's a
[34:31] liar
[34:34] but on this side abraham is the father
[34:36] of the faith
[34:40] on this side
[34:42] moses
[34:44] made mistakes
[34:47] but on this side
[34:49] moses by faith
[34:51] esteem the reproach of christ
[34:53] greater riches than all the treasures in
[34:56] egypt
[34:57] you see on this side before the blood
[35:00] were one thing but on this side we're
[35:02] completely another
[35:04] see the law on this side can only
[35:07] condemn us
[35:08] that's all the law can do the law cannot
[35:10] save you the law could only put you in
[35:12] jail
[35:13] the law can only cause you to be
[35:15] separated from god but it's the blood of
[35:17] jesus christ
[35:19] that saves you and puts you in the
[35:21] presence of god that's why the the jews
[35:24] in the time of jesus they thought they
[35:26] were still living on this side
[35:28] they thought they were still on this end
[35:29] so they bring a woman to jesus
[35:32] caught in the very act of adultery
[35:35] and they say the law on this side says
[35:38] this woman is to be stoned
[35:41] and jesus full of grace and truth he's
[35:44] on the other side he's the living blood
[35:46] that's about to be shed for our lives
[35:48] and it and he
[35:50] looks at the woman and
[35:52] and he says to them well
[35:54] he says let him that is without sin
[35:57] casts the first stone
[35:59] and then he just stoops down to right in
[36:01] the sand so in other words he's saying
[36:03] you all got hinder parts
[36:06] you've all made mistakes
[36:09] is that right
[36:10] you all got something that i the word
[36:12] could condemn you for
[36:15] he says and so let him that is without a
[36:17] mistake cast the first stone and i'll
[36:19] say it to the church let him that is
[36:21] without mistake cast the first stone at
[36:23] a brother or
[36:24] sister right but there was the sister in
[36:28] caught in the very act of adultery and
[36:30] and standing right in the presence of
[36:32] the word himself the true and just god
[36:35] standing in mortal flesh
[36:37] and there jesus stoops and writes on the
[36:39] sand the dirt i don't know what he's
[36:41] writing but as he's riding no doubt he
[36:43] begins to see two feet leave here and
[36:46] two feet leave that direction another
[36:48] two feet go that direction another two
[36:50] feet finally there's only two feet left
[36:51] and that's the woman's feet
[36:54] and he stands up and goes
[36:56] where are your accusers does none accuse
[36:58] you she says no lord he says neither do
[37:01] i condemn you
[37:03] jesus was looking through the blood
[37:06] neither do i condemn you go your way and
[37:09] sin no more
[37:11] sometimes
[37:12] it's okay if i get a little personal
[37:14] i just speak from my heart sometimes in
[37:16] the message we get a little too
[37:17] condemning of each other
[37:20] because with messages christ and the
[37:21] message is perfect
[37:23] but we fall short all the time
[37:26] as i said this morning brother branham
[37:28] said god knows you're just a man or a
[37:30] woman god knows you're going to make
[37:32] mistakes but you mustn't look at your
[37:33] mistakes you must look at your heart's
[37:35] attitude towards him and when you look
[37:37] at that and what you desire to be then
[37:40] you'll recognize who you are in the
[37:41] presence of god
[37:43] because if you measure yourself even by
[37:45] your own self and quite frankly as i'm
[37:47] preaching here tonight do you realize
[37:49] the hardest person as much as you have
[37:51] things against other people the hardest
[37:53] person for you to forgive is yourself
[37:57] you make mistakes and you condemn
[37:59] yourself
[38:00] and the devil helps you
[38:03] and he'll encourage you to condemn
[38:04] yourself
[38:06] and he'll tell you just how much of a
[38:07] bad person you are but you need to see
[38:09] yourself the way god sees you
[38:13] you're spotless in his sight because of
[38:15] the blood of jesus christ that's all you
[38:17] can say is father forgive me because of
[38:19] the holy spirit that's in you that's
[38:21] grieved that says lord i'm sorry
[38:24] i didn't mean to do that
[38:29] so he says here in ephesians
[38:35] he says put away these things
[38:38] sorry i
[38:40] lost my place
[38:46] he says let all bitterness
[38:51] and wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[38:53] speaking
[38:55] be put away from you
[38:59] and all malice
[39:04] i think the toughest one of these is
[39:06] bitterness
[39:12] but you know bitterness is a necessary
[39:13] part of your journey
[39:17] it was necessary part of israel's
[39:19] journey in the wilderness
[39:22] they come to the red sea they crossed
[39:24] over the red sea
[39:25] brother brown says they had a rejoicing
[39:28] miriam on the bank
[39:30] dancing in the spirit with the
[39:32] tambourine and the daughters of israel
[39:34] following her and singing praises to god
[39:36] the egyptians that army was buried into
[39:39] the sea and and
[39:41] destroyed by god there and they were
[39:43] they were just having a jubilee
[39:45] and brother mahm says it this way he
[39:47] says after the big song was over the big
[39:49] shout and having a hallelujah
[39:52] big time they started through the
[39:54] wilderness
[39:55] and led them right straight to bitter
[39:58] waters
[40:00] he said isn't that strange
[40:03] that's actually three days from the red
[40:05] sea to mara
[40:07] bitter waters he says right into
[40:10] temptation right into where the waters
[40:12] was bitter and they couldn't drink
[40:16] look the stream of mara bitter waters
[40:19] lays right in god's path he was leading
[40:21] his children
[40:23] isn't that strange
[40:25] looks like god would have bypassed that
[40:28] but he led them right straight up to
[40:31] that water
[40:35] he says yes standing there what can we
[40:37] do
[40:39] hallelujah we followed the lord we come
[40:41] through the blood we separated ourselves
[40:45] let me stop here for a moment many times
[40:48] those of you i don't know how many of
[40:49] you are old-timers in the message and
[40:50] how many you are new to this message
[40:52] that we love
[40:54] but you know
[40:56] many times we come into the mess and we
[40:58] thought our battles are over
[41:01] the truth is here finally
[41:03] and and i can just feed on the truth and
[41:06] that'll make everything perfect
[41:08] but you know what this isn't our
[41:10] millennium
[41:12] we can have an acreage with a pond
[41:15] horses and all that kind of stuff nice
[41:18] green pastures and everything and like a
[41:21] shangri-la on this earth but you know
[41:23] what this isn't our millennium
[41:26] the millennium isn't here this is the
[41:28] molding time
[41:29] this is the overcoming time this is the
[41:32] time of battle
[41:33] and he says
[41:35] he says what shall we do we followed the
[41:37] lord we come through the blood we
[41:38] separated ourselves moses said stand
[41:40] still that's right in every temptation
[41:43] he'll make a way of escape
[41:45] there was a little bush standing there
[41:47] on the side there hallelujah he cut down
[41:49] the bush and throwed it in the water and
[41:51] the water became sweet
[41:54] bubbling up joyful what another shouting
[41:58] time they had
[42:00] amen so the the little bush brother
[42:02] brown says another place that was that
[42:04] tree was a type of calvary
[42:06] he says you put calvary into the bitter
[42:09] waters he says and it takes the
[42:11] bitterness away
[42:13] but the bitterness was necessary god led
[42:15] them to the bitterness they had to go
[42:17] through the experience and many times in
[42:19] our lives we have to go through bitter
[42:22] experiences in order to overcome the way
[42:26] he wants us to overcome there's things
[42:28] in our nature there's things like you
[42:30] know job didn't get the great victory of
[42:32] the revelation of the resurrection
[42:34] simply by sitting in a church service
[42:37] amending the preacher
[42:39] no he was he had to go through some real
[42:42] trials he lost his money
[42:44] he lost his 401k
[42:47] all right he lost his is his family he
[42:51] lost all his children he lost respect
[42:53] amongst the brethren
[42:56] he became a nobody when he was
[42:58] considered the wisest man in that era
[43:01] and then on top of that he lost his
[43:02] health
[43:04] and he sat on the ash sheep he lost
[43:05] everything except the fact that he was
[43:08] alive
[43:09] that's all he could claim in life that
[43:11] he was alive it was bitter but he writes
[43:14] about it in
[43:16] in the book of job and talks about his
[43:18] bitterness but it was necessary because
[43:20] god was trying to get to him a
[43:22] revolution that he could get to him no
[43:24] other way job do you realize that when
[43:27] your redeemer when the redeemer comes
[43:29] you'll meet him
[43:31] he says you look at botany life the seed
[43:33] goes into the ground it comes up this
[43:35] one dies it comes up he says but what
[43:37] about a man but one day the lightning
[43:40] struck as it were and the whirlwind come
[43:42] down and the revelation struck job and
[43:44] he suddenly realized oh my says i i know
[43:48] my redeemer lives
[43:50] i know that though the skin worms
[43:52] destroy this body yet in my flesh i
[43:55] shall see god
[43:57] amen there's coming a resurrection time
[43:59] it was it became a reality to job you
[44:03] know brother adam had to go through
[44:04] those things too even in the beginning
[44:06] of his ministry i was talking about with
[44:07] brother aaron the other day how that you
[44:09] know you know brother branham how that
[44:12] he he had these visions
[44:14] they were bitter to him
[44:17] his friends ministers were telling them
[44:19] that's of the devil
[44:21] they all of a sudden came on him and
[44:23] and
[44:24] and he didn't understand it and and it
[44:27] tore him up and finally one day
[44:29] he said he has this this vision this
[44:32] blast underneath this tree and he's he's
[44:34] caught into the heavenlies and he
[44:36] doesn't understand it at all and he
[44:38] tells his wife that's it i'm done he
[44:40] says i'm going to my where i pray which
[44:42] was his cave and he says i'm going to
[44:45] pray and ask god to take these away and
[44:47] if he doesn't take him away he says i'm
[44:49] just going to die there
[44:51] i may never be back he says if god
[44:54] doesn't take these away and he goes to
[44:55] his cave and he begins to pray and he
[44:57] takes his bow and he begins to search
[44:58] the scripture
[45:00] and he's and he's calling on god and
[45:02] calling on god just take him away lord
[45:04] thereof the devil i don't want him i
[45:06] don't want to be of the devil see
[45:07] there's something in his heart his
[45:09] life's purpose
[45:11] as i said this morning is laying there
[45:13] and he doesn't understand it
[45:16] and he's he's just desperate before god
[45:20] and finally
[45:21] finally
[45:23] it's not the angel
[45:25] the revelation comes to him
[45:28] from the word of god
[45:30] and he begins to see it in the word oh
[45:32] jesus said whatsoever i see
[45:35] the father doing
[45:37] that doeth the son likewise
[45:40] and he began to see the scriptures
[45:42] pertaining to visions
[45:44] and how god would deal in visions and
[45:46] how what a prophet was and it began to
[45:48] become quick until until finally and you
[45:51] listen to brother branham's testimony he
[45:52] actually says this he says it just like
[45:54] this i don't have it in front of it he
[45:55] says it just like this
[45:57] and i begin to think
[45:58] maybe they're of god
[46:01] and then all of a sudden a light appears
[46:05] hello
[46:07] the bitterness was about to end
[46:11] and the angel stepped into the room
[46:14] and a man come walking out you know how
[46:16] he describes him
[46:18] he says
[46:19] and tells him that you've been sent with
[46:21] a gift
[46:22] to the world
[46:23] and you'll pray for potentates and kings
[46:26] and all monarchs and great men and all
[46:28] these things and begins to describe
[46:30] describe to him the ministry in other
[46:31] words he begin to describe his soul to
[46:34] him
[46:36] this is what's laying in that
[46:37] predestinated seed in your soul
[46:41] you are purpose to this work
[46:43] but it took a lot of bitterness
[46:46] to get him to the revelation of the word
[46:49] for himself personally
[46:52] see sometimes bitterness you can't avoid
[46:54] it
[46:56] but paul says
[46:57] while you must receive bitterness
[46:59] because it'll mold you you're not to
[47:01] give bitterness
[47:04] bitterness is something comes into your
[47:06] life but bitterness is not something to
[47:08] come out of your life
[47:11] because you get calvary in there
[47:13] and it changes the bitterness to
[47:15] sweetness
[47:17] brother brown says in hebrews chapter 4
[47:18] he says he led them to bitter water so
[47:20] he could prove their faith
[47:22] see revelation
[47:24] he likes to do it he likes to let
[47:26] tribulations come on you so he can show
[47:29] you his love and his power
[47:33] how can people today who doesn't believe
[47:35] in a miracle working of god when
[47:37] tribulations come they just give up and
[47:39] go on
[47:40] but we believe that god works miracles
[47:45] amen
[47:48] let all bitterness
[47:50] and wrath
[47:53] and anger i'm not going to go through
[47:54] all of these
[47:56] and clamor
[47:59] and evil speaking
[48:03] don't ever say something
[48:05] bad
[48:06] about anybody
[48:10] why is why is he
[48:12] why is paul emphasizing that because
[48:15] right in the midst of all this he says
[48:17] grieve not the holy spirit whereby
[48:20] you're sealed until the day of your
[48:22] redemption
[48:24] why is he saying that he's saying
[48:25] because in you is power to speak worlds
[48:29] into existence
[48:31] and go and live on them
[48:33] by the new birth the holy ghost that's
[48:35] laying within you but there are things
[48:37] that will stop the purity of that power
[48:41] that power that made the universe is
[48:43] inside of you
[48:46] i'm dealing with believers tonight
[48:48] that power that made the universe is
[48:50] inside of if if god is omnipotent every
[48:52] part of god is omnipotent
[48:55] and that little part if you've got the
[48:56] smallest part of god in you that
[48:58] littlest part is omnipotent
[49:01] but don't let that spark because we know
[49:03] that under the opening of the word in
[49:05] the last days part of the revelation of
[49:07] this day is that sons and daughters of
[49:09] god will have the right to say whatever
[49:12] you say
[49:13] it will be done
[49:15] if you say to this mountain be thou cast
[49:18] into the sea and be not removed but if
[49:20] it's as i as i described already is that
[49:23] if you're it it's all according to the
[49:25] revelation of your faith and if you if
[49:28] you allow your life if you allow your
[49:30] flesh if you allow your spirit to hinder
[49:33] the holy spirit that lays within you the
[49:36] purity of the power of god is hindered
[49:40] by corrupt communication
[49:43] let this mind be in you that was in
[49:45] christ jesus when you let god take all
[49:48] of the pollution now i'll just describe
[49:50] that pollution take your culture out of
[49:52] your mind
[49:55] we all have a culture you got an
[49:56] american culture
[49:58] i got a canadian culture africans got
[50:00] african culture asians got asian culture
[50:02] doesn't matter as chinese or indians or
[50:05] or or ugandans or ethiopians or
[50:07] americans
[50:09] there's a culture you've been raised in
[50:11] this is the way we do it really is it
[50:13] the word
[50:14] let the mind that was in christ jesus be
[50:17] in you because the power that was in
[50:20] christ jesus is in you
[50:22] and if the power that was in christ
[50:24] jesus was in you and the mind that was
[50:27] in christ jesus is in you then that's
[50:30] going to lose the power of god the way
[50:32] he wants it loose
[50:35] amen whatever we say whatever comes out
[50:37] of our mouth let it be edifying
[50:41] let it build up
[50:43] amen let it paul says here that it may
[50:46] minister grace to the hearer
[50:49] whatever i say o lord let it minister
[50:52] grace to somebody let it not minister
[50:55] legalism
[50:56] this woman was caught in adultery the
[50:58] very act what does what does the law say
[51:00] she should be stoned
[51:02] what does the message say she should be
[51:03] put out of the church
[51:07] oh don't worry i'm coming to this i'll
[51:09] show you write in the message
[51:12] all of these things you know we get very
[51:13] legalistic in our mindset
[51:16] it's okay if i take my coat off
[51:19] i'm getting kind of heated up i don't
[51:20] know why
[51:23] you know what thank you we we we get
[51:25] into this attitude as message believers
[51:30] listen saints i think we've been here
[51:31] long enough don't you
[51:33] i think it's time to go home but that
[51:36] going home comes from an everyday living
[51:38] for christ
[51:40] and a putting on of the word of god as i
[51:42] said to the brothers yesterday i said i
[51:44] said that brother branham had the vision
[51:46] of the bride of jesus christ he said she
[51:48] was wearing a specific garment
[51:50] he said lord grant that the crowning of
[51:52] my ministry would be to clothe the bride
[51:55] of jesus christ in the word
[51:57] and that's what we want to be clothed in
[51:59] is in the word and and this message
[52:02] is used of god to clothe us in the word
[52:05] of god and so we're we're
[52:08] we want the power of god that is within
[52:10] us all right stop now
[52:13] i got to explain this
[52:15] are you still with me
[52:19] the only reason i'm preaching on this is
[52:21] i would that the power that's already in
[52:23] you
[52:23] would be entirely loosed in your life
[52:27] if you say yes
[52:29] you see
[52:32] luther had the same holy ghost that you
[52:34] have
[52:36] same holy ghost we brother brown says
[52:38] we've been in the feast of pentecost
[52:39] from acts 2 all the way to today
[52:42] holy ghost down through the church ages
[52:45] but what what hindered them
[52:47] a lack of revelation
[52:50] see when the word come back to the
[52:51] church the just shall live by faith
[52:54] that loosed them
[52:56] to greater than what they had but that
[52:58] wasn't the fullness
[53:01] the the power of god in their lives by
[53:03] the new birth was still hindered by
[53:06] church ideology brother branham says the
[53:08] holy ghost is bound by church
[53:12] traditions that's what he talks about
[53:14] the river euphrates and all of that and
[53:16] i don't want to go into that tonight but
[53:18] nevertheless the the thing that we got
[53:20] to get out of our lives is church
[53:21] traditions the things that we got to get
[53:23] out of our minds is any thoughts that's
[53:26] contrary to the word and let the mind
[53:28] that was in christ jesus because the
[53:30] mind that was in christ jesus is
[53:33] revealed in the message of the hour
[53:35] it come to restore the word well what is
[53:38] the word the word is the logos it come
[53:40] to restore the one that became flesh and
[53:43] dwelt among us back into the church
[53:45] again so the entire word of god comes on
[53:48] the scene in the bride of jesus christ
[53:50] and her thoughts become entirely the
[53:52] word it's not just the new birth
[53:55] listen the new birth will get you into
[53:57] resurrection but it'll take the mind of
[53:58] jesus christ to get you in the rapture
[54:02] because the mind of christ has been
[54:04] restored in this day
[54:06] one time brother branham
[54:11] you know i'll say it this way could
[54:12] brother branham say anything he wanted
[54:14] to
[54:18] no he couldn't
[54:24] there's there's times that
[54:29] but yet technically i'll say he could
[54:31] say anything he wanted to
[54:35] but the question in the question was
[54:37] where was he standing
[54:40] all right one time
[54:42] brother branham talks about in one place
[54:44] he calls it his final test
[54:46] 1959 he talks about it he says there was
[54:50] a young couple in the church
[54:54] in a meeting
[54:55] and they were doing immoral acts
[54:57] right in the meeting
[54:59] it wasn't in jeffersonville it was out
[55:02] on the field somewhere
[55:03] because that's where things get out of
[55:05] order and the he says they were
[55:08] performing immoral acts and and us the
[55:11] deacons tried to stop them they wouldn't
[55:13] stop and and you know they were
[55:16] climbing all over each other right in
[55:17] the service
[55:19] brother well let me just read it the way
[55:21] he says it
[55:22] he says and the spirit of the lord came
[55:24] upon me and i begin to shake
[55:27] and this is before the service he says
[55:29] the lord said there's a trap set for you
[55:32] be careful what you say
[55:35] notice that statement
[55:37] says i write i went right ahead speaking
[55:39] just the same
[55:41] and oh he got so immoral with her
[55:44] till i had to stop again
[55:46] i said don't do that sir please i said
[55:49] if you want to make love to the young
[55:50] lady
[55:51] then you leave the building but this is
[55:53] a religious meeting
[55:55] so you see what's going on it's terrible
[55:58] and
[56:00] he says
[56:03] you shouldn't do that
[56:05] please don't do that while i'm preaching
[56:07] i started again and he just made it
[56:10] worse
[56:12] talk about disrespectful
[56:14] reprehensible every bad word that you
[56:17] might think about it
[56:18] he says something said to me say what
[56:20] you will and it'll be done
[56:23] and i stood there mr mercer the tape boy
[56:26] and all of them standing brother fred
[56:27] many of them standing present the
[56:30] perspiration was just running from me
[56:33] something said say blindness
[56:35] and it'll be blind
[56:37] say death and they'll pack them out
[56:40] say what you will
[56:42] he says i couldn't speak i couldn't move
[56:45] it just and it just left
[56:48] all right so now he he gets
[56:51] a commandment say whatever you will and
[56:53] it'll happen
[56:54] but then the devil comes behind that and
[56:56] says why don't you say death
[56:59] why don't you say cancer why don't you
[57:00] say this or that or the other and
[57:03] and he's just standing there he doesn't
[57:05] say anything because he doesn't know
[57:06] what to say and he says it just left and
[57:08] i thought god what must i do
[57:11] and i turned and he stood there and his
[57:12] face white looking at me and i thought
[57:14] what must i say
[57:16] and then i turned and looked like before
[57:18] i knowed what i said i said i forgive
[57:22] you of your act
[57:27] it doesn't sound very tough to me
[57:31] sounds christ-like
[57:36] and he says
[57:38] and i look down there and i said i
[57:40] forgive you
[57:41] and then he said that's exactly what he
[57:44] wanted me to say
[57:47] see
[57:48] forgive your enemy
[57:50] these are the spirits that make you evil
[57:54] watch them spirits
[57:57] see the power of god in you and the
[57:59] devil wants you to say
[58:01] the wrong thing
[58:04] and the and the warning of god was watch
[58:07] what you say
[58:09] because the power of god was in god's
[58:11] prophet
[58:12] and the anointing was on him and and he
[58:14] could have said anything and it would
[58:16] have happened
[58:18] but he had to be careful what he said
[58:21] see let no corrupt communication proceed
[58:24] out of your mouth
[58:25] but that which is good to the use of
[58:27] identifying that it may minister grace
[58:31] unto the hearers
[58:33] now let me just say this brothers and
[58:35] sisters i don't know where you're from i
[58:36] don't know your background i know
[58:38] brother aaron a little bit
[58:42] but there's nobody in this message
[58:45] that has done to you or to this church
[58:47] what that couple did in that meeting
[58:53] can you say amen to that
[58:56] now
[58:57] it was his will that brother brown would
[59:00] say
[59:01] i forgive you
[59:04] it was god's will
[59:06] it was the spirit of christ it was the
[59:09] mind of jesus christ to loose the power
[59:13] of god
[59:14] in the meeting
[59:17] for them to say
[59:18] i forgive
[59:20] for brother brahm to say i forgive
[59:23] now if that's so then
[59:25] that's so now
[59:29] you'd be long enough around the body of
[59:31] christ you know somebody's going to say
[59:33] something or do something that offends
[59:34] you
[59:38] that's the reality
[59:42] somebody's going to do something that
[59:44] that you don't understand
[59:47] there's things that people do and it
[59:48] might not even be to you
[59:50] but somebody will do something and act
[59:52] in a certain way and behave in a certain
[59:54] way that's discreditable to the gospel
[59:57] of jesus christ and you'll look at that
[59:59] and you'll say that's not right
[1:00:03] they shouldn't do that
[1:00:06] that's wrong but where you go next will
[1:00:10] determine a lot
[1:00:14] do you have an attitude where like those
[1:00:16] that talked about the woman that that
[1:00:18] came to jesus that they brought to jesus
[1:00:20] it says they ought to be stoned
[1:00:24] but what did jesus say
[1:00:26] the mind of christ says neither do i
[1:00:29] condemn you
[1:00:32] neither do i condemn you she did a
[1:00:34] reprehensible act
[1:00:36] she was caught in the very act of
[1:00:38] adultery hello
[1:00:39] there's many times that we have friends
[1:00:41] family members
[1:00:42] that go sideways and things that happen
[1:00:45] and i don't even know why i'm harping on
[1:00:47] this tonight but
[1:00:48] you know it just seems something that
[1:00:49] god's dealing with me
[1:00:51] and i'll say it deals with me personally
[1:00:53] because you know many of us think we
[1:00:55] look at different situations that have
[1:00:57] happened that have arisen and we
[1:00:58] immediately want to condemn
[1:01:01] we immediately want to put them out
[1:01:03] we immediately want to discommunicate or
[1:01:06] or separate or or shun or whatever more
[1:01:09] it might be but that was not the
[1:01:11] attitude of the lord jesus christ when
[1:01:13] he saw a predestinated seed in somebody
[1:01:16] he said neither do i condemn you
[1:01:19] go your way and sin no more yet at the
[1:01:22] other hand he could look at a rich young
[1:01:23] ruler a man that was that lived right
[1:01:26] that obeyed the commandments that did
[1:01:28] everything right and and the young men
[1:01:31] said you know what must i do to have
[1:01:32] eternal life and jesus said well you
[1:01:34] know the commandments and he said these
[1:01:36] i've kept from my youth and jesus said
[1:01:38] okay only one thing you lack the bible
[1:01:40] said jesus loved him and that's what he
[1:01:42] was doing and telling him that he was
[1:01:44] loving him
[1:01:45] he was loving him by telling him what he
[1:01:48] lacked in his life
[1:01:50] he says go and sell all that you have
[1:01:52] give it to your to the poor come and
[1:01:54] take up your cross and follow me and you
[1:01:56] shall have treasure in heaven and the
[1:01:59] man went away
[1:02:00] sad
[1:02:02] because he had many possessions
[1:02:05] but jesus loved him
[1:02:07] he said i'll give you what you need you
[1:02:09] want to know what you need you know
[1:02:11] you're not satisfied i'll give you the
[1:02:13] reason you're not satisfied
[1:02:15] it's because you're holding on to your
[1:02:17] wealth
[1:02:18] let it go you see that's a complex
[1:02:21] actually
[1:02:23] brother brown says if you find yourself
[1:02:24] being greedy give everything away
[1:02:27] that's a complex
[1:02:30] you see and so so there's many things in
[1:02:32] life that the devil tries to hold us to
[1:02:35] just because we have the power
[1:02:38] to speak doesn't mean we ought to speak
[1:02:43] just because we have the truth doesn't
[1:02:45] mean we should say it
[1:02:48] there were things that brother branham
[1:02:49] held back and even that he asked the
[1:02:51] angel can i tell so and so
[1:02:54] or he asked god can i tell them what's
[1:02:57] about to befall them sometimes he knew
[1:03:00] he couldn't even tell the person god
[1:03:02] would reveal something and he couldn't
[1:03:03] even share it just because you have it
[1:03:05] doesn't mean you share it
[1:03:08] you know paul was caught up into the
[1:03:09] heavens
[1:03:10] the third heaven he says we know it was
[1:03:13] paul he tried to put it at arm's length
[1:03:16] but we know it was paul and he was
[1:03:18] caught up there into the third heaven
[1:03:19] and he says i saw things that are
[1:03:22] unlawful to be uttered
[1:03:25] i can't even tell you what i saw i don't
[1:03:28] know about you brother aaron but i'd
[1:03:29] want to be sitting at paul's feet
[1:03:31] come on paul
[1:03:34] tell us what you saw
[1:03:36] i want to hear about heaven i want to
[1:03:38] hear what you saw i believe you were
[1:03:40] there why don't you just share with us
[1:03:41] the details he says no there's some
[1:03:43] things it's unlawful for me to even
[1:03:45] speak them
[1:03:47] my my the responsibility but god knew
[1:03:50] the character of paul
[1:03:52] and he knew that he could trust him with
[1:03:55] what he had revealed to him the bible
[1:03:57] says the word fitly in psalms or
[1:03:59] proverbs 25 a word fitly spoken is like
[1:04:02] apples of gold in pictures of silver
[1:04:05] fitly spoken means in its season
[1:04:08] you see there's words that that are just
[1:04:11] not truth words have timing
[1:04:14] you know and and there even ecclesiastes
[1:04:17] says there's a time to keep silence and
[1:04:18] there's a time to speak
[1:04:20] all right so a man
[1:04:22] uh proverbs 15 says a man has joy by the
[1:04:26] answer of his mouth and a word spoken in
[1:04:28] due season
[1:04:30] how good it is
[1:04:32] amen so it's not just that you have the
[1:04:34] truth we don't handle the word of god
[1:04:36] like an axe or like a sword and just
[1:04:38] chop down everything that we can see by
[1:04:40] the word of god we have the ability to
[1:04:42] do that but that's not what the word is
[1:04:44] for
[1:04:45] let the mind that was in christ jesus be
[1:04:48] in you
[1:04:50] jesus said to the disciples in john 16
[1:04:52] says these things have i spoken to you
[1:04:54] in proverbs but the time cometh
[1:04:58] the time cometh when i shall no more
[1:05:00] speak to you in proverbs but i will show
[1:05:02] you plainly of the father at that day
[1:05:05] you'll ask in my name and i say not unto
[1:05:07] you that i will pray the father for you
[1:05:09] for the father himself loveth you
[1:05:11] because you have loved me and have
[1:05:13] believed that i came out from god so
[1:05:15] here jesus
[1:05:16] is speaking to the disciples and we'll
[1:05:18] call it dark phrases and he's telling
[1:05:20] them listen there's come in a time
[1:05:22] where where you'll it'll no longer be
[1:05:25] proverbs to you it'll be plain what's
[1:05:27] that time when the spirit of truth is
[1:05:29] come
[1:05:30] he will lead you into all truth all
[1:05:32] right so when you have the holy ghost
[1:05:34] you'll understand much more than you
[1:05:36] understand now as a matter of fact at
[1:05:38] that time he says you won't ask me to
[1:05:40] pray for you you will pray for yourself
[1:05:43] because you'll understand that the
[1:05:44] father loves you
[1:05:47] and there's no greater hour than this
[1:05:49] hour for the understanding that god
[1:05:51] loves you
[1:05:53] and that day you'll know what day this
[1:05:55] day at the end time that i am in the
[1:05:57] father the father and me i and you and
[1:05:59] you and me
[1:06:00] amen there'll be a revelation come into
[1:06:02] the church that will identify to them
[1:06:04] their personal standing in god himself
[1:06:08] i was speaking about your position i'll
[1:06:10] just drop this in i didn't drop it in
[1:06:11] this morning but i'll drop it in now
[1:06:13] david's speaking about the purpose let
[1:06:15] me not be ashamed unto thee oh lord do i
[1:06:18] lift up my soul let me not be ashamed
[1:06:19] let not my purpose be ashamed let it not
[1:06:22] be defeated by my enemies
[1:06:24] you see the purpose that god put in you
[1:06:27] is for a specific reason
[1:06:30] it's a part of the redemptive plan of
[1:06:32] god listen to me very closely
[1:06:35] and the devil wants to defeat that
[1:06:37] purpose in you
[1:06:38] and i'll just say it this way
[1:06:41] the devil knows
[1:06:42] if he can defeat your purpose he can
[1:06:45] defeat god
[1:06:49] let me be more plain if he can defeat
[1:06:52] you
[1:06:53] he can defeat god
[1:06:58] you don't understand what's inside of us
[1:07:01] we don't understand the strength of the
[1:07:02] dealing of god in our lives
[1:07:04] we don't understand the connection to
[1:07:06] the eternal many times
[1:07:08] and and we we we just consider ourselves
[1:07:10] oh well you know i'm not important no
[1:07:12] god put something in you that has a
[1:07:14] purpose in this life
[1:07:16] and he will empower you and does empower
[1:07:19] you and ensure you have the power to
[1:07:22] carry out that purpose in the face of
[1:07:25] all
[1:07:26] opposition isn't that wonderful
[1:07:30] it's god doing it
[1:07:32] it's his purpose
[1:07:34] it's his great plan it's his redemptive
[1:07:36] plan breaks god we're just a part of it
[1:07:38] but when you get a revelation that i'm a
[1:07:40] part of it there's nothing can defeat me
[1:07:43] oh i make mistakes oh i fall short and
[1:07:46] and every day i have to pray lord
[1:07:47] forgive me every one of us do but yet in
[1:07:50] the midst of all of that we can say god
[1:07:52] there's something in me that's carrying
[1:07:54] me forward
[1:07:55] there's something in me that's moving me
[1:07:57] forward i can't help myself i sometimes
[1:07:59] i try and go this direction and
[1:08:01] sometimes i'm trying to go that
[1:08:02] direction but it keeps pulling me back
[1:08:05] it keeps moving me onward because it's
[1:08:08] something that god put in you that is a
[1:08:10] part of himself you see that's why jesus
[1:08:13] said the disciples uh i i say not i'll
[1:08:16] pray the father for you for the father
[1:08:18] himself loveth you
[1:08:20] see they didn't have that revelation yet
[1:08:22] they still were living in malachi
[1:08:25] you say you love us wherein do you love
[1:08:28] us
[1:08:30] see israel brother braham said the
[1:08:31] church age book had a tough time
[1:08:33] understanding the love of god
[1:08:38] thought love would be like a parental
[1:08:40] care for a baby
[1:08:42] protecting them from all harm
[1:08:44] he said but that's not god's love god's
[1:08:47] love is in the eternal
[1:08:49] god's love is an eternal purpose god's
[1:08:51] love is a revelation of himself in you
[1:08:54] and a molding of your life into the
[1:08:56] image of himself to be an expression of
[1:08:59] him in the age that we live in
[1:09:02] hallelujah still with me
[1:09:04] i'll go a little bit further try not to
[1:09:06] keep you too long tonight
[1:09:10] we're living in a time america i love
[1:09:12] america because of its principles
[1:09:15] don't love everything it does i'm
[1:09:17] canadian
[1:09:18] i happen to think canada is the best
[1:09:20] country or at least used to be
[1:09:23] but
[1:09:24] i don't know if there is a best country
[1:09:25] anymore
[1:09:27] they're bringing laws into effect in
[1:09:28] canada with relation to speech
[1:09:35] what they call hate speech
[1:09:37] what they call hate speech
[1:09:39] many things in this message would be
[1:09:41] deemed hate speech
[1:09:44] in america you have still freedom of
[1:09:46] speech maybe
[1:09:51] and they want to put laws into effect in
[1:09:53] america
[1:09:54] i see in the news
[1:09:56] and i'm not a political preacher don't
[1:09:58] worry i'm not going down this road
[1:10:00] but i see in the news they want to bring
[1:10:02] some kind of a ministry of information
[1:10:04] or something or
[1:10:06] uh
[1:10:07] ministry of truth thank you uh you know
[1:10:09] something to govern that you know
[1:10:12] you know that's
[1:10:13] that's one thing that they want to do
[1:10:16] but anytime you draw a line the question
[1:10:18] is not that you're drawing the line the
[1:10:20] question is who is drawing the line
[1:10:23] and where is the line drawn
[1:10:25] all right
[1:10:26] i'll say in the message
[1:10:30] that there is freedom of speech
[1:10:34] but that speech is governed by a nature
[1:10:38] it's not governed by a rule
[1:10:41] and it's not a line that's drawn by
[1:10:43] somebody
[1:10:45] it's a manifestation of the word of god
[1:10:47] in you
[1:10:49] and god puts his nature and that's why
[1:10:51] brother branham as god brought him to
[1:10:53] the test he says now be careful what you
[1:10:55] say he knew that the nature had been
[1:10:58] molded in the man
[1:10:59] to the mind was subject to the word of
[1:11:02] god and even though he had the authority
[1:11:05] to say death or say tuberculosis or say
[1:11:08] something else yet in himself there was
[1:11:10] a nature that that just doesn't seem
[1:11:13] right
[1:11:14] he had been molded by the holy spirit
[1:11:17] the warfare within his own mind to
[1:11:19] realize i only want to say what's
[1:11:22] pleasing to the lord i don't want any
[1:11:24] corrupt communication to come out of
[1:11:26] this mouth i remember when brother
[1:11:28] branham keep coming back to me then when
[1:11:30] he was in portland and the lunatic there
[1:11:32] that come up on the platform wanted to
[1:11:34] uh come and destroy him and and the man
[1:11:37] was big bigger than me 300 and some
[1:11:39] pounds and six foot five or something
[1:11:41] like that and and the man was you know
[1:11:43] was demon possessed and took pleasure in
[1:11:46] destroying preachers and and brother
[1:11:47] brown was just a little guy and and uh
[1:11:50] and so he was he come up on the platform
[1:11:53] and brother branham just shoot away the
[1:11:54] policeman and everything said this isn't
[1:11:56] a flesh and blood battle
[1:11:58] but what was the devil trying to do you
[1:12:00] notice that every trick that that giant
[1:12:02] pulled was to try and break the
[1:12:05] atmosphere of divine love around brother
[1:12:07] branham
[1:12:09] the things that he said you're just a
[1:12:11] liar i don't know about you i hate being
[1:12:13] called a liar
[1:12:15] because i'm not a liar and when somebody
[1:12:17] accuses me of lying i i just like
[1:12:20] i don't know what it is there's just
[1:12:21] something in he does not like it
[1:12:23] and uh and and the that that demon
[1:12:26] called brother brown i'm a liar you're
[1:12:28] just a snake in the grass you're just
[1:12:30] you know this and that and the other
[1:12:31] thing that didn't affect brother brown's
[1:12:33] thoughts towards him was you know what
[1:12:34] he's just a man he probably has a wife
[1:12:38] he's got children
[1:12:39] maybe that love him and and he doesn't
[1:12:42] mean to do that it's just the devil on
[1:12:43] it
[1:12:44] so the devil took the next step and god
[1:12:46] allowed him to he spit in brother
[1:12:48] brown's face
[1:12:51] i have to understand what is he trying
[1:12:52] to do this is not a flesh and blood
[1:12:54] battle it's the devil trying to break
[1:12:56] that atmosphere of divine love that was
[1:12:58] around brother brown because he the
[1:13:00] devil knew if he could break the
[1:13:02] atmosphere brother branham was powerless
[1:13:05] if he could get brother branham in his
[1:13:07] flesh brother madam was a boxer
[1:13:09] if he could get him in his flesh he
[1:13:11] could defeat him
[1:13:13] if he could get him wound up in his mind
[1:13:16] he could defeat him but as long as he
[1:13:18] stayed behind the word there's nothing
[1:13:21] the devil could do
[1:13:24] and branham just
[1:13:25] you know the man says i'm going to knock
[1:13:27] you into this out into this audience i'm
[1:13:29] going to break your neck or whatever he
[1:13:31] said and brother branham was about to
[1:13:33] say i wouldn't do that sir when out of
[1:13:35] his mouth came
[1:13:36] because you have
[1:13:38] i forget the words now but because you
[1:13:40] have glorified yourself over the servant
[1:13:42] of god you will fall at my feet today
[1:13:45] and the man thought it was brother
[1:13:46] branham speaking but it wasn't
[1:13:48] it was god speaking through brother
[1:13:50] brown
[1:13:51] and and the man says i'll show you whose
[1:13:53] feet i'll fall over and he goes he comes
[1:13:55] back to to strike brother branham but he
[1:13:58] gets a little bit too close
[1:14:01] and he comes under that atmosphere
[1:14:03] and he begins to crumble
[1:14:05] and brother brahm says he fought with
[1:14:07] everything that was within him
[1:14:09] to try and stay on his own feet
[1:14:12] but he just began to crumble why so
[1:14:14] great was the power of the atmosphere
[1:14:17] that brother branham had created by
[1:14:19] yielding himself to god by saying the
[1:14:22] right thing
[1:14:24] that's all the devil wanted was just say
[1:14:26] the wrong thing
[1:14:27] and he could magnify that and use it to
[1:14:30] disrupt that meeting
[1:14:33] if that's so then that's so today
[1:14:36] all he wants us to do
[1:14:38] all the devil wants us to do is say the
[1:14:41] wrong thing
[1:14:43] let no corrupt communication
[1:14:46] proceed out of your mouth
[1:14:50] they came to jesus in mark chapter 7
[1:14:53] and
[1:14:55] they were
[1:14:56] accusing him of
[1:14:58] unclean eating
[1:15:00] and
[1:15:02] eating with unwashed hands etc
[1:15:05] and
[1:15:06] he says
[1:15:08] hearken unto me every one of you and
[1:15:09] understand there is nothing from without
[1:15:11] a man that entering into him can defile
[1:15:14] him
[1:15:15] but that which comes out of him those
[1:15:18] are the things that defile the man
[1:15:22] and the disciples came to him and he
[1:15:23] explains it to them he says are you
[1:15:25] without understanding do you not
[1:15:26] perceive that whatsoever thing
[1:15:29] from without enters into the man cannot
[1:15:32] defile him you know how the jews were
[1:15:34] washed with with
[1:15:35] you know eat with washed hands don't eat
[1:15:37] the wrong foods has to be kosher all of
[1:15:40] these kind of things jesus says ignore
[1:15:42] that
[1:15:43] that's not what defiles a man
[1:15:45] he says because
[1:15:46] he says it cannot defile him because it
[1:15:48] enters not into his heart
[1:15:50] but into the belly and goes goes out at
[1:15:53] the drought purging all meats he says
[1:15:55] but that which cometh out of a man that
[1:15:58] defileth the man
[1:16:00] for from within out of the heart of men
[1:16:02] proceed evil thoughts adulteries
[1:16:04] fornications murders theft covetousness
[1:16:06] wickedness deceit lasciviousness evil
[1:16:09] eye blasphemy pride and foolishness
[1:16:12] all these things come from within
[1:16:15] and defile the man
[1:16:19] in other words there's nothing the devil
[1:16:20] does to you that can defile you
[1:16:24] praise the lord
[1:16:27] but it's what you allow to be within you
[1:16:29] that defiles you bitterness must come
[1:16:32] offenses must come but that does not
[1:16:34] define you
[1:16:37] let me say it again that does not define
[1:16:39] you the woman at the well
[1:16:42] with five husbands
[1:16:44] and all of the living that she had lived
[1:16:45] and the one she was living with then was
[1:16:47] not her husband
[1:16:49] that did not define her
[1:16:52] to the world to the church that defined
[1:16:54] her
[1:16:55] it's like oh she's she's without hope
[1:16:57] we've tried to help her
[1:16:58] we've tried everything we could and just
[1:17:00] try and teach her the right way to live
[1:17:02] and try to support her and try but she
[1:17:04] ends up going running off with another
[1:17:05] man all the time
[1:17:06] five men and now the one she's living
[1:17:08] with now is not her husband and there's
[1:17:09] no hope for this woman and she comes in
[1:17:11] the middle of the day because so that
[1:17:12] there's nobody else around when she's
[1:17:14] drawing water but jesus the word himself
[1:17:17] said the word himself said i have needs
[1:17:21] to go by samaria
[1:17:23] hallelujah i have needs to go by the way
[1:17:27] of a predestinated seed that is laying
[1:17:30] in the muck and the mire of the world
[1:17:32] and is all trodden down and cast out and
[1:17:35] and thought lowly of by everybody in the
[1:17:38] world there's nobody that gives her any
[1:17:40] hope but she's a seed
[1:17:43] hallelujah she's a seed and when the
[1:17:46] light struck the seed
[1:17:48] that's all it took when the light struck
[1:17:50] the sea then something changed
[1:17:53] then her life became different she
[1:17:55] dropped the water pot she runs into the
[1:17:57] city come see a man that told me all
[1:17:59] things is this not the very messiah the
[1:18:02] very purpose of her life now become
[1:18:04] manifested
[1:18:05] because the word of god ministered grace
[1:18:09] to her
[1:18:13] if that's so then that ought to be so
[1:18:14] today
[1:18:18] there's bitterness that comes
[1:18:21] from without
[1:18:22] but let not bitterness come from within
[1:18:27] our words are meant to be spirit and
[1:18:29] life
[1:18:31] you see our words
[1:18:33] are meant to be
[1:18:35] a breath from heaven
[1:18:37] amen
[1:18:39] god's calling you to minister grace
[1:18:42] to somebody else
[1:18:44] that's the truth
[1:18:46] not minister
[1:18:48] judgment
[1:18:51] that's not our place our place is to
[1:18:54] minister grace i don't care how far
[1:18:56] they've gone
[1:18:58] your call is to minister grace
[1:19:01] let me just
[1:19:02] close with this quote here i know it's
[1:19:05] already six o'clock i think we started
[1:19:07] at four
[1:19:08] and it's already time i'm sorry i've
[1:19:10] kept you so long
[1:19:13] we'll close with this thought brother
[1:19:14] branham is asked a question
[1:19:17] it says i lived many years in sin until
[1:19:19] i found the lord please brother branham
[1:19:21] i've sinned again
[1:19:22] i'm not worthy to come before you in the
[1:19:24] holy place
[1:19:26] please tell me if i can be restored holy
[1:19:28] again please help me brother branham i
[1:19:31] have a devil in me
[1:19:33] help me
[1:19:34] will you lay your hands upon me and
[1:19:36] restore me again
[1:19:38] this is questions and answers in 1962
[1:19:41] he says you have not sinned my friends
[1:19:44] so far in god but what you could be
[1:19:46] restored
[1:19:48] if you had sinned so far that you could
[1:19:50] not be restored you'd never want to be
[1:19:52] restored
[1:19:55] so i say it tonight if there's anybody
[1:19:56] in here thinking that the fact even that
[1:19:59] you're in this room means you can be
[1:20:01] restored
[1:20:03] he says as long as there is something
[1:20:05] dealing with your heart you're still in
[1:20:07] the line of restoration
[1:20:10] it says guilty of the least is guilty of
[1:20:12] the whole i have sinned many times every
[1:20:14] day every one of us do things we don't
[1:20:16] want to do
[1:20:19] that always gets a quieter amen when you
[1:20:21] say that
[1:20:22] he says every one of us every day
[1:20:25] do things that we don't want to do
[1:20:28] why because we're in these yet
[1:20:29] unredeemed bodies he says you don't want
[1:20:32] to be that way or you wouldn't ask the
[1:20:33] question he tells the person he says
[1:20:35] that itself is a proof that god's still
[1:20:37] dealing with you the very see the very
[1:20:39] fact that they asked the question
[1:20:41] he says you've probably gotten nervous
[1:20:42] probably satan telling you that you
[1:20:44] can't be restored he's lying
[1:20:47] because look if there's a deep calling
[1:20:48] there's got to be a deep call a deep to
[1:20:50] respond to the call if there's a hunger
[1:20:52] for something that something's got to be
[1:20:54] somewhere or you would have no hunger
[1:20:56] for it
[1:20:57] now as long as you're wandering and
[1:20:59] hungering to get back to god there's a
[1:21:00] god somewhere calling you see or you
[1:21:03] wouldn't be hungry there's a creator see
[1:21:05] now he goes beyond just the fact that
[1:21:07] you're hungering there's a possibility
[1:21:09] he now says the fact that you desire to
[1:21:11] be restored is actually only god himself
[1:21:14] dealing with you personally
[1:21:16] he says that proves god's calling you
[1:21:19] he says it goes to show that you only
[1:21:21] fell from grace backsliding is not lost
[1:21:24] i want somebody to tell me there where's
[1:21:25] backsliding lost prove it to the bible
[1:21:28] in the bible
[1:21:29] backslider's not lost he's just out of
[1:21:31] fellowship
[1:21:32] israel backslid but they never lost
[1:21:34] their covenant they lost their praises
[1:21:36] and joy david lost the joy of his
[1:21:39] salvation when he took bathsheba uriah's
[1:21:41] wife but he never lost his salvation
[1:21:44] he never said restore unto me my
[1:21:46] salvation he said restore to me the joy
[1:21:48] of my salvation
[1:21:50] he says oh there's so much legalism
[1:21:52] today touch not taste not you don't do
[1:21:56] things legally i don't come to church
[1:21:57] tonight legally i feel tired i've been
[1:22:00] nervous i'm upset i'm wondering about
[1:22:02] something that's out before me my
[1:22:03] heart's burning even as much until my
[1:22:05] hearts are fluttering
[1:22:07] i got a cramp of pain right at this
[1:22:09] moment just shooting back and forth up
[1:22:11] and down through here weak nervous
[1:22:13] trembling catch a hole here and squeeze
[1:22:15] and got my toes squeezed up in my shoe i
[1:22:18] i feel anything but come down here
[1:22:22] and you got symptoms
[1:22:25] praise the lord
[1:22:27] he says
[1:22:28] why did i come then because i love god
[1:22:33] live or die i must stand here for him
[1:22:35] it's not because i have to
[1:22:38] someone asked me today this afternoon
[1:22:40] might be streaming right now
[1:22:42] because i thought you were just in
[1:22:43] germany and before that you were just in
[1:22:45] ethiopia what are you doing in phoenix
[1:22:46] don't you ever rest
[1:22:49] i'm like i feel fine
[1:22:51] everything's good
[1:22:53] as long as i might feel weak but in my
[1:22:56] weakness his strength is made perfect
[1:23:01] he says i love god live or die i must
[1:23:03] stand for him it's not because i have to
[1:23:05] he wouldn't care about whether i did or
[1:23:07] not
[1:23:09] let's stop on that one
[1:23:11] sometimes we feel like well we have to
[1:23:13] or god's going to be angry with us
[1:23:14] brother brown says i didn't have to come
[1:23:16] and preach
[1:23:17] i do it because i love him
[1:23:19] he wouldn't care whether i did or not
[1:23:22] he says if i die i'd go to heaven anyhow
[1:23:25] but i'm coming because i love him
[1:23:27] you serve god because you love him not
[1:23:29] because you got to because you love him
[1:23:31] enough
[1:23:32] and you love the lord with all your
[1:23:34] heart you don't have to worry about
[1:23:36] these things if you made a mistake you
[1:23:38] don't sin willfully you just done
[1:23:40] something wrong you've slipped back true
[1:23:42] you was up here in fellowship and you've
[1:23:44] dropped back down in this must down here
[1:23:49] i'm just skipping over parts of it just
[1:23:51] to catch the highlights he says
[1:23:55] and he goes into into a story that i
[1:23:58] love
[1:23:59] and he talks about a bur an eagle in a
[1:24:01] cage in a zoo
[1:24:03] and he says
[1:24:04] he says this eagle wanted to get out
[1:24:06] but it couldn't get out of the cage and
[1:24:09] it would fly thinking if i just tried
[1:24:12] harder
[1:24:13] your brothers remember that were at the
[1:24:14] breakfast what i was talking about if i
[1:24:16] just try harder i'll break through the
[1:24:18] bars
[1:24:19] and it'll be over
[1:24:20] and and he tried to fly against the bars
[1:24:23] and he was all bloodied from flying
[1:24:24] against the side of the cage in the zoo
[1:24:27] it was an eagle that had been trapped
[1:24:28] and brother branham had you know his
[1:24:30] heart was the heart of a redeemer
[1:24:33] the redeemer
[1:24:34] and he
[1:24:35] he looked at that ego says if i had the
[1:24:38] money see if i had the purchase price
[1:24:41] i would pay for the bird unlock the cage
[1:24:45] and let the bird go free
[1:24:47] you see there's a mystery to the bird
[1:24:49] but it wasn't a mystery to brother
[1:24:50] branham
[1:24:51] there's a mystery of redemption to us
[1:24:53] but it's not a mystery to jesus christ
[1:24:56] he paid the price that you and i can go
[1:24:59] free you can be free from every complex
[1:25:02] you can be free from every bitterness
[1:25:04] you can be free from every malice you
[1:25:06] can be free from everything the devil's
[1:25:08] trying to put on you you can be free
[1:25:10] because christ has paid the price
[1:25:13] and he who the son sets free is free
[1:25:15] indeed and you can be free right this
[1:25:18] evening if you can reach out and accept
[1:25:20] the cr the price that christ paid for
[1:25:22] you
[1:25:24] you don't have to leave here under the
[1:25:25] same cloud that you came in
[1:25:28] you can leave here totally free in the
[1:25:30] revelation i'm a son of god it doesn't
[1:25:32] matter what the devil does to me my life
[1:25:34] why it might fall apart tomorrow but
[1:25:36] that doesn't mean anything different i'm
[1:25:38] still a son of god i'm still a daughter
[1:25:40] of god no matter what happens he's
[1:25:43] putting it all together i might have
[1:25:45] loved ones that are out there in the
[1:25:46] world i might have people that i want to
[1:25:48] see save that doesn't make no difference
[1:25:50] he's in control
[1:25:53] i got children that are not where they
[1:25:54] ought to be but let me tell you
[1:25:55] something tonight i just want to share
[1:25:58] this with you many people ask me and say
[1:26:00] you know brother tim what about my
[1:26:02] children what about you know them i'm
[1:26:03] praying for them
[1:26:05] is there anything else i could do
[1:26:07] do i says if they're a child of god
[1:26:09] they're coming
[1:26:11] i said it's got nothing to do with even
[1:26:13] your prayers because nobody was praying
[1:26:15] for me when i came into the message
[1:26:19] i got no family in this message
[1:26:21] god came down through a little town in
[1:26:23] the middle part of bc the interior of bc
[1:26:26] and sent some man that had been in the
[1:26:28] message only six months and knew nothing
[1:26:30] about the message
[1:26:32] he was a police officer he knew
[1:26:34] basically nothing about the message
[1:26:36] you know
[1:26:37] he was so bad he called amy temple
[1:26:39] macpherson one of the messengers
[1:26:42] he knew nothing
[1:26:44] but one thing he did know was original
[1:26:46] sin
[1:26:49] and i said to him i said what is this
[1:26:51] serpent seed you keep talking about or
[1:26:53] no i said what is the message that you
[1:26:56] keep talking about he said well you ever
[1:26:57] heard a serpent i said never heard of
[1:26:59] serpentine
[1:27:00] and he told me what the original sin was
[1:27:02] that it wasn't an apple and i've been to
[1:27:04] church all my life was raised to
[1:27:05] pentecostal et cetera et cetera and when
[1:27:07] he just told me what it was he didn't
[1:27:09] even explain it
[1:27:11] he just told me what it was
[1:27:13] fireworks went off
[1:27:15] there's no other way to say it
[1:27:17] scriptures begin to become real to me
[1:27:20] revelation just began to pour and just
[1:27:22] because somebody told me the original
[1:27:24] sin was adultery in the garden of eden
[1:27:26] between eve and the serpent
[1:27:28] and i was like there it is
[1:27:30] that answers so many questions and from
[1:27:33] that time to this time i've never looked
[1:27:35] back
[1:27:39] it was a man that knew nothing that just
[1:27:41] told me what the original sin was
[1:27:44] what's it going to take for your lost
[1:27:46] loved ones to be saved something very
[1:27:48] simple
[1:27:49] a word spoken in due season
[1:27:54] is going to change their lives
[1:27:57] hallelujah
[1:28:00] i just believe that's real
[1:28:08] so brother branham close goes on he says
[1:28:11] sister brother whoever wrote this if you
[1:28:13] have fallen down here that doesn't mean
[1:28:14] you're lost
[1:28:16] you're just an eagle got into a pen
[1:28:18] that's all
[1:28:19] you're caged up down here in sin again
[1:28:22] you don't want to be there that's the
[1:28:24] reason you're looking upward
[1:28:26] o brother branham i once lived up there
[1:28:28] is there a way here yes
[1:28:32] you may think you're tied to brother
[1:28:33] sister who wrote this question you may
[1:28:35] think the devil's got you tied down but
[1:28:37] he's lying
[1:28:41] there was one time a man come to earth
[1:28:43] jesus christ the son of god he untied
[1:28:45] you
[1:28:47] don't you believe it you don't have to
[1:28:49] stay down there
[1:28:50] no sir
[1:28:51] you're free
[1:28:54] that's right he died in your place to
[1:28:56] take away your sins
[1:28:58] you just believe on him
[1:29:00] flop your wings and fly away with the
[1:29:03] rest of them
[1:29:04] don't stay in that pit of the devil then
[1:29:07] he goes back to the question he says the
[1:29:10] question says now will you lay your
[1:29:11] hands on me and free me from that
[1:29:13] and he says sister dear or brother dear
[1:29:16] i'd lay my hands on you but that
[1:29:18] wouldn't free you
[1:29:21] what would free you is to understand
[1:29:23] you're already free
[1:29:26] you're already untied you don't have to
[1:29:30] worry about being free
[1:29:32] you're already free
[1:29:35] jesus made you free
[1:29:37] be not entangled again in the yoke of
[1:29:39] bondage you're free as you can be
[1:29:42] you don't have to be tangled up laying
[1:29:44] my hands on you is just a tradition i
[1:29:46] could do that but that still wouldn't
[1:29:48] set you free until you accept
[1:29:51] what he's done for you
[1:29:53] that's just me saying lord i believe it
[1:29:57] that anything goes back to the question
[1:29:58] well you just lay hands by faith upon
[1:30:01] him no sorry he says to the person will
[1:30:03] you just lay hands by faith upon him say
[1:30:06] you just
[1:30:07] and i want to say this right so so that
[1:30:09] it's very clear he says well
[1:30:11] you just lay your hands by faith upon
[1:30:15] him
[1:30:17] many times in the service brother brown
[1:30:18] said who did they touch
[1:30:21] i'm 50 feet from them i'm 20 feet from
[1:30:23] them who did they touch they touched the
[1:30:25] high priest
[1:30:27] it wasn't by their hands it was by faith
[1:30:30] their faith touched the high priest he
[1:30:32] said you lay your hands by faith upon
[1:30:33] him
[1:30:34] and say lord i believe it yes
[1:30:37] he said and then he says up you come
[1:30:40] confess your sins
[1:30:42] he says
[1:30:44] he that hides his sin will not prosper
[1:30:45] covers his sin but he that will confess
[1:30:47] his sins who do you confess them to the
[1:30:49] lord
[1:30:50] confess them to him that's where you get
[1:30:53] freedom and justification when you're
[1:30:54] willing to say i've sinned
[1:30:56] i'm wrong
[1:30:58] that's what you said here i've fallen
[1:30:59] i've sinned i'm dead wrong is there a
[1:31:01] chance for me to be whole again it's the
[1:31:03] last sentence
[1:31:05] or two sentences the minute absolutely
[1:31:07] he says the minute you desire it
[1:31:11] that shows that god dropped the lifeline
[1:31:14] down to pick you up
[1:31:18] just rise up
[1:31:20] on his lifeline
[1:31:21] of faith and prayer
[1:31:23] move right on up into the rest of the
[1:31:26] eagles like that
[1:31:27] and go flopping away
[1:31:29] let's all stand together
[1:31:35] let's bow our heads together
[1:31:43] maybe there's somebody here tonight that
[1:31:44] just wants to reach out to him by faith
[1:31:46] with our heads bowed and our eyes closed
[1:31:49] and say lord i heard your word tonight
[1:31:52] i believe it lord
[1:31:54] and i'm reaching out tonight to claim my
[1:31:57] freedom
[1:31:58] why don't you just by faith raise your
[1:32:00] hand to him and say lord i claim my
[1:32:02] freedom tonight
[1:32:03] i claim deliverance from this thing
[1:32:04] that's bothering me i recognize it's
[1:32:07] just the devil it's a lie of the devil
[1:32:09] and i'm walking away from the night by
[1:32:12] faith in jesus christ
[1:32:13] i'm laying a hold of the atonement 2 000
[1:32:17] years ago that has been revealed in its
[1:32:19] fullness in these last days
[1:32:22] i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god
[1:32:25] and i accept what jesus has done for me
[1:32:28] do you know that song amazing grace
[1:32:30] shall always be
[1:32:31] my song of praise maybe you could say
[1:32:33] that and we'll pray heavenly father
[1:32:39] lord we come to the end of the meetings
[1:32:41] today
[1:32:43] we're not so full of ourselves lord that
[1:32:45] we think that this service will change
[1:32:47] the world
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:49] but lord we just believe it can change
[1:32:51] one person
[1:32:54] we believe lord that you speaking
[1:32:56] a word in due season
[1:32:59] can come to somebody
[1:33:01] and let them know you're already free
