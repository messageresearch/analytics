TRANSCRIPT
========================================
psalms chapter 25 and verse 1. unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul o my god i trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not mine enemies triumph over me yea let none that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed which transgress without cause and just to save time i'm going to jump down to the verse 20. o keep my soul and deliver me let me not be ashamed for i put my trust in thee let integrity and uprightness preserve me for i wait on thee amen the lord had his blessing to the word you may be seated now i know that brother aaron is a good teacher and that you're well-taught people and that uh well-grounded in the word i think he's been now in arizona in phoenix now for 20 months or so and uh so uh but yet as i as i begin this morning i don't want to assume that you know something or assume that you've been taught something and so you forgive me if i repeat things that maybe you've heard or things that that are maybe well established in your heart you know we know that in that when we go to the beginning of the bible we really go to john 1 because john 1 was before creation in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god it says and then then in verse 10 of that chapter it says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not speaking about israel but as many as received him can you say amen to that as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man but of god and so we realize that if we are sons and daughters of god we always were sons and daughters of god all right but we needed to be empowered to become what we were meant to be you know that we god had us in his thoughts before the foundation of the world brother branham describing john 1 he says the logos he says that's where melchizedek comes into view he says that's where the lamb's book of life comes into view he says that's the son that came out from the from elohim the self-existing one and the first expression of god and then we know that word became flesh and dwelt among us the fullness of the godhead dwelling bodily in jesus christ but in him was attributes in him was thoughts and brother branham explains that those thoughts are eternal it's not like our thoughts we think you know i think today i don't know what time i'll get to church or you know i don't know what the traffic's going to be like i don't know how many cars are going to be on the road will i run into construction on the way to church these are all new thoughts to us but to god he knows how many cars there is he knows how much traffic there is he knows how much construction is going on he knows exactly who would be here amen he knew that i would be here he knew that you would be here he knows all things his thoughts are eternal and because we were in his thoughts that's the eternal part that that he wants to quicken us to the thoughts that he had of us before the foundation of the world god held alone with his thoughts he said to job he says the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy that was in god's thoughts when he saw you the sons of god the attributes of god you were shouting for joy so that's where he's taking us some of you have a further journey than others amen some of you are very quiet some of you come to church and and you know you're wrestling with a lot of things but if you really knew what god thought of you and you really knew what the apostle paul was writing in romans 8 and he said those who he foreknew in other words those that were in his thoughts before he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son moreover whom he did predestinate them he called are you called yes how many have you called all right all right he called you then if he as many as he called them he justified which is as though you never sinned in the first place how are you justified by believing the call abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness so paul picks it up and says how was abraham justified was it by works or was it by faith it was by faith god spoke the word and he believed god spoke the word and you believed amen you received his word he justified you and those whom he justified he has already glorified he already sees you as a finished product and everything that's happening in our lives was already in the mind of god to take us to the finished product amen and so paul says what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us that was the revelation that joshua had when the 10th five says we're not able they said but if god before us we are more than able amen and so paul says then i'm persuaded that neither height nor depth nor principality nor power nor tribulation or persecution not things present not things to come nor anything shall be able to separate us from the love of god that's in christ jesus now i wonder in the mind of god that the sons of god were shouting for joy amen he sees us there amen and the more that god reveals himself to us the more that becomes a reality within our lives so we are one of his thoughts that has become manifest in our day we were in his mind waiting for our time to come and our time came and we materialized that's not brother tim's ideas that's right out of the message of the hour now we gather here in church for many reasons you've come this morning i could list many reasons many of you are in need maybe some of you are physically in need some of you are emotionally in in need sister lori you've been on our hearts you know you've you've lost your mother and uh you know the different ones go through different experiences of different things in their lives god knows those things all right and so we we come to worship we come to lift up the name of jesus abide and when we use the word edified means to be built up paul even said about his own ministry if there are ministers here he said about his own ministry i will not use my gift for destruction only for edification we don't come to to tear down we come to build up it's it's god's purpose in our lives and in our ministry and even together to edify one another we have needs of different types as i've already mentioned you know in first john 5 it says this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us amen so it's not just if we ask anything but if we ask according to his will and so we we must find the channel of god's purpose in our lives and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him if any man see his brother sin of sin unto death and so on and so forth and and so uh but the purpose as we gather together is that we know that if we're asking according to his will we have a confidence that he hears us and be that he answers us but then james picks up the thought of of the church and he says why are there wars and fightings among you he says is this okay why are there wars and fightings among you he says you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members now i'm building to something here and so i want you to listen to this closely he says you lust and have not now that word lust is not just unclean lust to to uh uh the opposite sex or something like that that's not just all that is speaking about is speaking about natural desires okay and we all have natural desires that we have to be care careful of as paul says you know we crucify the flesh we die daily and so but james writes here you lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight in war yet you have not because you ask not and you ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you may consume it upon your lusts or your natural desires okay so john writes he says if we ask anything according to his will he hears us james when you ask be careful that you're not just asking according to natural desires okay so god is not interested in our lust he's not interested in our natural desires just hang with me for a minute i'm going to go here and he's not interested just in the desires of our flesh or of our mind which the book of ephesians chapter 2 says we all walked according to okay it's we it says you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the heir the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all that's all of us we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and there's no greater time than laodicea this this uh age of commerce and capitalism and money and buying and selling then then there's no greater age than this to fulfill the desires of the flesh and of the mind anything anybody wants is available out there it's it just seems like there's no limit to it he says and we were by nature the children of wrath even as others but god that's not just english translation that's in the original but god yes amen who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins has quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit in heavenly places in christ that he might in the ages to come show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness to in his kindness towards us through christ jesus all right now i've already thrown a lot of scripture at you and you might refer to them later later and maybe go through them again but god is not interested god is not maybe interested in the wrong word i'll say god is not moved simply by the desire of your flesh and of your mind now we know he is the high priest that is touched by the feelings of our infirmities so it's not that he doesn't care about how we feel he cares about how you feel this morning but there has to be a higher purpose in our healing than just feeling good all right there's got to be a greater purpose in something that you want deliverance from in your mind than just having peace and just being able to to be at rest in your thoughts there is a greater purpose of god in the individual as hebrews 4 says for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities i love that double negative there paul doesn't just say we have a high priest that is touched but he says we haven't it's it's he's very specific he says you don't have a high priest who cannot be touched so what he's saying is he's not necessarily touched but he can be touched by the feelings of your infirmity it's not just because you're infirm that he's touched but it's because he's your high priest yes that you're touched he's your high priest medical science is not our high priest we thank god for everything medical science can do but medical science is not our high priest psychology is not our high priest if it can help anybody that's wonderful even brother brown says you know whatever somebody can help somebody with that's great you know we thank god and make somebody else's life easier i'm not into psychology i'm not i don't have psychology background or anything like that but there is a word that became flesh that can be touched because he is your high priest amen and he is a faithful high priest having suffered and been tempted bible says was in all points tempted like we are yet without sin or without unbelief so while god is touched by the feelings of our infirmity it takes more than the feelings to touch god it takes revelation to touch god all right me so far one day jesus walking along the bible says in matthew 21 he says he went to a fig tree to have a fig anybody like figs i like figs i eat them all the time and it says jesus saw there was no fruit on it and and cursed the tree i get my fakes from costco if they don't have no i don't curse costco but jesus cursed the fig tree and the disciples might have thought well that's an overreaction because the time of figs was not yet man you know this is jesus he does everything right and now he gets mad at the fig tree because there's no fig and it's not even the time of figs yet and so that maybe stumbled them a little bit then they come back walking by the tree and it's withered away it's dying there's no life left in it jesus cast the life out of it i believe partly so that a prophet in this day can say see there's a life in it that needs to be cast out it says it's like cancer he says cancer has a life in it if you cast out the life the cancer will die and show us the principle of healing and the principle of cursing the thing and so and and jesus but then jesus said to them as they marveled at it and jesus answered and said verily i said to you if you have faith if you have faith and doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive let me say that again but and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive hallelujah what a gospel what a wonderful wonderful promise brother adam says in the message speak to the mountain he says if you could only see the simplicity of god's eternal purpose and the sovereignty of his grace could you imagine him using that great power to put a curse on a tree because it didn't have any fruit on it and leaving thousands lay unhealed see brother brown says if you could see the simplicity of god's eternal purpose he says he cursed the tree and left people lay unhealed he says the tree is part of god's creation as the same as man is part of god's creation but to show that he is concerned about trees about insects if he's concerned about those how much more is he concerned about you amen so he's concerned about all things brother branham says in the breach message and i'm going to change into second gear here he talks about the promise in the breach and the and the title deed and we realize that that this is important to this age because the lamb stepped forth in this age to loose the seals which is not just the revealing of mysteries but in first peter 1 it talks about an inheritance reserved in heaven for us and that's the inheritance that was in the right hand of the father and that it was waiting to be to be claimed and it was redeemed at calvary all that adam lost was paid for at calvary but it has been claimed in our day to the purpose that god would finish his redemptive plan and really what i want to do today is i want to view more of your own uh part of god's great redemptive plan because a lot of times we just look at individual promises and say you know oh this is a promise and i'm trying to see it and i'm trying to hold to it but if we can really see the redemptive purpose of god and our par to purpose then it will raise our faith up and make us realize that we cannot be defeated and if you cannot if you can see that you could not be defeated then you can go through life knowing that anything that you battle is you are you are more than able to overcome it because christ has already paid the price of our overcoming and may god pour in faith this morning to each and every one of us so brother brown talking about it he says the bible told us in matthew that the meat shall inherit the earth now the meek is not humble that's a whole surface in itself me is i'll just drop it in humility is your own attitude towards yourself but meekness is how you treat others all right and so i'll leave that there but he says the title deed to eternal life abstract title deed to eternal life when adam forfeited it for wisdom instead of faith it went back to the hands of the owner almighty god then he says what does abstract mean and i'm on page 86 of this look at it when you go home what does abstract mean it means it's searched all the way back to the beginning all right and so we and and when brother brown's preaching on abstract title d he's actually taken an american concept of law we don't even have this in canada or the different parts of the world they don't have it but he's taken an american term of an abstract which is a title search that searches the the claims upon the title it's not the title itself but you've got to have the abstract and the title deed and that's why he calls it abstract title d not only is it your inheritance but the abstract has searched all the way back by the holy ghost and the fact that you have the holy ghost shows that there's no claims against you all the way back to the beginning and you have a right to your inheritance okay and he says its redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by adam and eve the sons of god ought to shout for joy it's redemption what redemption the price of calvary and the lamb taking the book in our day the lamb taking the book the redemption means all legal possession to all adam and eve what's the hindrance the hindrance is the the flesh and the spirit because in your soul if you're born again you're sealed to the day of your redemption your nature has been changed there's nothing the devil can do about that you can go fishing every day of your life not that i recommend that but you can go fishing every day of your life you're still going to make it if you're sealed you're sealed that's the work of god that that totally changes the individual on the inside and brings you into line as the son or daughter of god but because you've been changed you've been empowered to manifest the life of a son of god in your day to as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god all right so he says it's legal possession to the abstract deed title deed of eternal life means you possess everything that adam and eve lost whoo what of it brethren the possession of that deed so if we know who we are why are we hindered from having anything that we have need of i i have to drop this in i want to go here tonight but i have to drop this in tonight this morning rather and that is brother branham said if you're born again by the spirit of god you have enough power in you to speak worlds into existence and go and live on them is that right holy ghost filled you have enough power to speak anything into existence but he says it's governed by a law and the law is not a laws of do's and don'ts it's not how much how you live or how sincere you are even it's the law is which is revelation because i'll tell you now this morning if it wasn't governed by a law no holy spirit because you have enough power in you to heal every disease you have the power of the resurrection is in you see the resurrected saints went into the grave with that power why haven't they come out of the grave yet because it's not the hour of that revelation we're now in the season but we don't know the day or the hour and so even the raptured saints you have enough power by the new birth for the rapture see when you're sealed by the holy ghost you already got enough power to fulfill every scripture it's not the power that's lacking the power has been in the church brother branham said down through the seven church ages but what has been lacking is revelation and revelation is faith and how does faith come faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of god that's why the word is so important to being revealed when the title deed was was redeemed and the seals were broken what was it doing it was revealing mysteries that were previously hidden from the church mystery truths that will loose the power of the rapture within the church you see it so it's those seven thunders brother branham said those mysteries contained under those seven thunders which were the mysteries contained in the seals that that those revelations is what is empowering us to live more than any other church age has ever lived because this age will take a rapture paul says there will be a people we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed hallelujah with this mortal will put on immortality this corruption one day will put on incorruption even even abraham saw that but we'll go beyond what abraham saw we won't just be turned young again we'll be made immortal we'll never die again there'll be a people that step across the curtain of time there'll be people that one day are living in an unredeemed body and the next day will come to the fullness of adoption to with redemption of their mortal bodies and they will they will have the ability to step across the curtain because they will no longer be bound by sin hallelujah our understanding will be loosed we'll never make another mistake aren't you glad for that we'll never make another mistake because we we sure hate making them now don't we because of the nature that's in our soul but one day the nature that's in our soul will also be in our spirit and will also be in our flesh hallelujah so we know that adam and eve lost this inheritance but that did not change the inheritance its bible says it was reserved incorruptible in heaven and so the revelation of the word is the revelation of what was always in god for the manifestation of himself in you the revelation of the word is not intellectual understanding the revelation of the word is something the gates of hell cannot prevail against when god and i'll say god is the only giver of revelation i can preach brother aaron can preach others can preach you can read the bible you can listen to a message and that and that's all good but you can't give yourself a revelation no preacher can give you a revelation but we can lay the word out and the holy spirit can anoint that word to you personally you can hear something today maybe something that you've heard before and the holy spirit come on that and the gates of hell will never prevail against that it's a revelation that's anchored in your soul throughout and if the gates of hell will not prevail against it it's eternal amen and so whatever we have need of is already paid for in calvary one day jesus went by a village called the it was called the village of the samaritans and he sent messengers there to go and make ready for him and the bible says they wouldn't receive him but it was the last week two weeks of his ministry and the reason they wouldn't receive him because the bible says his face was as though he would go to jerusalem it's an interesting statement he was in the last two weeks of his earthly journey there was a purpose to fulfill his his thoughts in other words his mind was entirely on that purpose i'm sure there was sick in this town that needed healing i'm sure there was people that wanted to hear the word of god there was many needs there in that samaritan village no doubt but the bible says they wouldn't receive him because probably he wouldn't have meetings the way they wanted meetings they probably wanted prayer lines and he wasn't interested in prayer lines you know they probably maybe wanted altar calls he wasn't interested in altar calls he had a purpose to fulfill and his purpose was to be the lamb of god to take away the sins of the world and he knew what his life was all about and so that eternal purpose was unfolding itself there in that we'll call it that first easter weekend as as jesus began to move towards all that was necessary of the crucifixion and then the going down to hell and preaching to souls in prison and then the resurrection and the and the cl and and the the vindication of the price that was paid all of those things the presence of god was moving him to his purpose david says in psalms 25 he says unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul forgive me for taking so long of a foundation this morning but he's lifting up his soul not unto the o god do i lift up my mind or unto thee oh god do i lift up my feelings i'll i'll just tell you one of brother tim's pet peeves sometimes we sing songs that it's like unto thee o lord do i lift up my feelings i've been through this and i've been through that and i just love it when my two-year-old daughter sings all my life you have been faithful not much of a testimony there i love that song though because it's real to me but you know when you get the little children singing some of those songs you know i've been through a great trial and he was there and it's like you're five years old what have you been through that's just me that's just brother tim we all enjoy music the way we enjoy music and there are times like david that we lift up our soul unto the lord and the scripture speaks about the soul in different ways and sometimes the soul just describes existence adam became a living soul sometimes it describes the whole being as as being how many souls there were in the city or so on and so forth and and but sometimes it describes just the innermost part and in the light of the message brother we're a three-part being we have a soul we have a spirit we have a body and that soul comes from god and is purposed in life and of necessity there is a deep calling the scripture says there is a uh a desire deep within the inside and and that soul is the real you and and that's really who you are your your outer man is not you it's you know you're you're looking at a certain stature and a certain individual i had a i was telling the brothers yesterday there was a man in ethiopia that had a vision of uh he was stan he was in church one morning and and uh not a believer he was just in a church local church and he was sitting there all of a sudden he was caught away into a vision and he saw himself standing there looking up at a big white man with glasses and dressed a certain way and he thought that was strange he thought well maybe there'll be a white man in the church today and there wasn't and so he didn't know what it was long story short he ends up driving down a street that i happen to be standing on after the last service of in the last place in ethiopia and i was just just had kind of moved out of the church and was standing by myself on the street and he's driving down the road hadn't actually missed his turn he told me and ended up on this street that he doesn't usually go down but it was sunday morning ethiopia is very religious place most people are in church so there wasn't a lot of traffic it wasn't a lot of people he's driving down the road and he looks over and he sees the big white man with glasses that he saw in the vision dressed exactly like he saw him in the vision and he pulls over and he sends his son man doesn't speak english he sends his son over to me who speaks broken english he says you need to talk to the driver of this car and i was telling the brothers you don't just do anything in a third world country just you know anything well you need to come over here with us you know you just don't do that and you know you so i was very suspicious and finally over the course of time i i had one of the local brothers talk to the young man who spoke broken english and found out the story that the driver was his father and and uh and and god had obviously spoken to him so i spent about 15 minutes preaching this message to him there on the sidewalk but my point was god won't lose one he was going to make sure that that man heard this message god knows every soul that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world and we look at each other but really we don't always see the the eternal purpose of god that's in the soul of the individual that's yearning to be expressed and the soul might not feel in the sense that the body feels or it or maybe it might not have emotion in the sense that the spirit has emotion because the soul has faith or unbelief but but there is a yearning in the depth of that because of the predestinated purpose and the devil will attack you in your flesh and the devil will attack you in your spirit in your mind to try and get you to deny your soul purpose he'll try and overwhelm you like the lunatic of the gadarenes thousands of demons there within that man but it doesn't matter how many demons were in him that soul desire was greater than anything the devil could put on him and when the word came by his way that predestinated soul moved him beyond the power of demons the power of demons had power to empower his flesh to break chains to to be unable to be captured to be unable to be a captive just lived amongst the tombs and and did all kinds of strange powerful acts but in the midst of all that that predestinated purpose on the inside brought that soul into a reality i was in a meeting in uganda a couple years back just before covet actually and uh and and it was a meeting of about 1500 people a large portion of unbelievers in the meeting and it was kind of in a in an area where a man with 800 people in his church a pentecostal man had come into the message actually i think he had a thousand but but the church had diminished down to about 400 you know when the message comes in it drives away all the unbelievers right and so now he had a church about 400 and he wanted to have a meeting we had a meeting and it was kind of a strange meeting brother aaron it was it was just different in the i had to actually change translators because the first translator was a young man and it's the first time he translated for me and something wasn't going right and i i told brother fred chingy i said you know uh i need someone else to translate he's not doing it right and i can tell he's not doing it right and so he he so brother fred actually i think began to translate for by himself for me and so so we just began to minister and and and it just wasn't going exactly the way that i would normally preach and finally i just thought okay here we go and i just close my notes and i just begin to preach and i just begin to to just lay the word in as the holy spirit just begin to give utterance i didn't know it but there was a witch doctor in that service all right and he during that service he tried to conjure up his demon spirits this wasn't just a witch doctor this was a teacher of witch doctors so this guy was a guy who knew his stuff and and he was trying to conjure up the the power of the enemy and he was amazed because it wasn't working and he was like you know i've never had that happen before this is his testimony afterwards and he never had it happen before and and he just thought that was amazing so so that sir you know many souls came to christ there and and uh i'm not an evangelist you understand i'm i'm more of a teacher but god used the service in a mighty way and that and that man went from there and he was kind of confused about what had went on and he goes home and he finds out his witchcraft stops working it just stops working and he's amazed and the demons that he calls on will no longer answer him and he just won what is going on but his sister is a believer and so so finally through his sister he arranges to talk to brother fred and the man gets gloriously saved hallelujah you talk about a predestinated seed god knows what he's doing and that man got gloriously now it's not without a battle because those demons left him and went to his daughter young girl they had to cast the demons out of the daughter but god gave them strength to cast those demons out and the daughter was also delivered and saved but nevertheless in the midst of it all god came down and there was a seed laying there and it didn't matter about witchcraft it didn't matter about demon powers it didn't even matter that i knew what was going on it's just a matter of surrendering yourself to god and god through the power of the word broke and bound those demons and that man got delivered they even took him out and i've got the video of it they took him back to his village and dug up the amulets or whatever you call it of his witchcraft the different instruments of his witchcraft the different things that he uses doug he bat him buried in the ground they dug him up they burned them all he was done praise be to god we thank god for his delivering power he's still the same yesterday yesterday today and forever but the devil will put all kinds of things on you to try and get you to deny what he saw in you before the foundation of the world but it's that purpose that drives us and we may not even realize it you have a purpose in you and you can't get away from it do you realize that you just cannot get away from it if you're a son or daughter of god it's laying there and you will never escape it you might go this direction in your flesh you might go that direction in your mind but that purpose will never escape you god doesn't have plan b if he did moses would have never been the deliverer moses went out into the wilderness run away from his purpose in life the purpose for which he was called and anointed and especially all of that 40 years forgot everything he knew comes in total weakness to the pillar of fire in the burning bush and says i'm not able no you got the wrong guy like i can't talk i can't lead i forgot all my learning everything like that and god's brother abraham says god liked to have kicked him around a little bit he said but god says no i the cry of my people i've come down to deliver them and i'm sending you amen i hope this is speaking to somebody this morning brother braham says in the future homie says if you got eternal life there's only one form and that's god and you are an expressed attribute the holy ghost is eternal and then you are in eternity where you was all the time only there you were a thought now you're materialized all right he says but you just recognize what happened see you were made for an eternal purpose because you manifestation of an attribute that was in god you out of and to make you a human being and sin come along and perverted his way you come anyhow but you was lost with the world so he come and redeemed you the expressed attribute and he also redeems the earth by the same way then his purpose rolls on see it's his purpose he came to you i'd love to just stop right here i got a lot a lot of things on my plate today but i'd love just to stop right here he came by your way you might say i was raised in the message i i heard this message all my life that doesn't make any difference you can hear it all your life and still miss it but one day god comes to you and he makes it real to you individually and making it real to you then it's you and him and you can never get away from it and who is this melchizedek brother branham says i'll re-title it for you who is this logos who is this melchizedek right that's what the that's what the logos became materialized in abraham's day and the logos coming materialized 2000 years ago was jesus christ all right he says being eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was he wanted me to stand in the pulpit now he's bringing it right down to the service he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one i just feel something telling me he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight see the lord wants you to be back tonight all right it says then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to the earth to serve his purpose is that right all right then after it's finished it's brought back to a glorified state it's matured and brought back again all right now now we finally got to the place we need to be praise the lord it's your purpose that god responds to it's the eternal purpose that god is working out it's not your feelings it's not your complexes it's not your culture all right it's not your education these are all things in your mind in your spirit realm it's not the family you were raised in it's not the church you were raised in it's your purpose that he responds to and when you find the channel of your purpose that brings a response from god to you individually all right now i'll show you here this here because there was a woman by the name of hannah in the bible we know who hannah was she was the mother of samuel all right but hannah didn't have an easy life because she was barren and she desired to have a child but in a woman having a child how many women here have a child right now in a woman having a child there's three levels of desire there all right number one is the flesh desire there's the natural hormonal desire of a woman to be a mother it's as these little girls here grow up they'll begin to feel it and not maybe understand what their bodies are going through and different things and and not understand why they feel the way they feel it's a natural preparation for motherhood right and so here was hannah she was married there was a natural desire to have a have a child she had a husband she wanted the natural things of life she wanted her own children maybe maybe a flesh desire to hold a baby any any of you are there any babies here i think there was one over here all right and uh you know that the baby started fussing just as i was sitting standing behind you just before the service and just started i think he started coughing a little bit now now there was nothing in me that said i got to hold that baby sorry it just wasn't in me it's i'm thinking take care of your baby mother that's a man i'm not being ignorant about it i'm just saying that's a man but maybe sister melissa back there who hasn't even had children yet amen maybe sister lori back there stan standing back there watching the child fuss a little bit maybe there's something in the motherhood there just saying oh i should just hold that child right maybe i'll just comfort that child a little bit that's the difference right that there's a natural makeup of a woman to hold a child and you sisters know that you see a little baby maybe in a in a little carriage or one of the sisters in the church have a new baby and all the sisters want to hold the baby is that right now none of you brothers are going up saying let me hold the baby hope not anyway maybe maybe some of you aren't being but you know that's all right to hold the baby if you're a man i'm not saying that but i just say there's something in the sisters it's a natural reaction to a child but it it goes beyond that now for a woman and i'll just say hannah had not just the natural desire but now she also had something arranged by god called a trial and the trial was called panina which was the second wife of her husband and banana had no problem having children she had several of them and her husband hannah's husband loved her what was his name elkanah or something like that uh i can't remember his name i probably got it here somewhere but anyway yeah okay and and he couldn't understand what was going on between the two women but every time panina said to hannah you know how god has blessed me with children just aided hannah not in her flesh now but in her mind i'm inferior because i can't have a child i'm less than what a woman ought to be ah you know sometimes it happens in young women before they're married i'll never get married there's a little few snakes i have daughters i know what that term is and they they feel like i'm less than really i ought to be because nobody's interested in me i'm sorry this is a sensitive area but that's only in the spirit realm that's the mind that's the complexes that's the culture that's the that's the different things that work on us and the devil likes to anoint those things because those things are real but that's not what god responds to and you sisters i don't even know who's single here i'm sorry i'm sorry sister melissa i know you're single but i'm not preaching at you all right but uh to to the sisters that are single i assume these ones are single i mean you know but uh you know there's there's you've got to go beyond that you've got to get beyond the complex of singlehood you've got to get beyond the idea of woe is me or i'm less than what ought to be no you're not less than what you ought to be you have an eternal purpose in the thoughts of god and that eternal purpose does not rest in your mind or your spirit it does not rest in your flesh and this world will try and tell a woman it does rest in her flesh it does not rest in your flesh the purpose of god lays within the soul all right and so you know el elkanah was like a typical husband excuse me for belaboring the point here but he was like a typical husband say says to hannah why are you crying he says what the bible says why weepest thou why don't you eat he says why eat as thou not why is your heart grieved he see he's the typical man he's trying to fix the problem he says am i not better than you than to you than ten sons right he's trying to get her mind off of that and onto something else i love you you're my favorite wife you're my favorite one i love you so much you mean all the world to me and no matter what he could say he could never stop her yearning because the yearning wasn't just in her flesh it wasn't just in her spirit there was something in her soul that god was working on and that yearning would not stop it was a deep calling that had to have a deep to respond hallelujah and so there's many times that that we maybe say something to comfort somebody that maybe we don't even have the answer and maybe they don't know the answer she just knew it as i need a child but that wasn't all the story because there was something in the mind of god before the foundation of the world there was a man called a samuel and that man was going to be a prophet to that age a word prophet that was going to establish the law in israel that moses had preached and he was going to lay the word out but god had chosen a particular vessel and that particular vessel had to come to the place in her life where she got a revelation lord if you give me a son i'll give him back to you that's what god was waiting for you see she had to get the revelation of why she was yearning she didn't know it was the answer she just finally came in exasperation and desperation and said lord if you give me a son i'll give him back to you i'll wean him and then he's all yours just give me a son and god said you said the right thing see it's the principle of the spoken word you said the right thing it's a predestinated seed laying within there where there was a hatty right that was in a room with a prophet of god that heard the word she'd been through many things but she had a soul desire hallelujah she had a soul desire and one day the word came and she said that's nothing but the truth i believe those squirrels were spoken that's nothing but the truth and that presence of god came down and says give her whatever she wants because he knew she was in the channel of her sole desire and she said i don't know what to ask for that's always what it comes down to we'll deal with that tonight i i i don't know what to say and so he finally says well your your sister's was it her sister or her niece or your is sick here in the wheelchair sister ask for her says you're poor ask for a million dollars see if it doesn't appear on the table right now soul desire she says i i want my two boys to be saved hallelujah and the presence of god came down and smote those boys i'll tell you what a soul desire the answer to your soul desire only lays in the word of god brother brown says in leading of the spirit he says have faith in god believe him with all your heart and you can receive what you asked for it's your faith that does it not me it's the lovely one who's here tonight the one that i spoke of that set with unwashed feet he loves you so much don't turn him away accept him in your heart and he says oh what a sin it would be for you to go away from here tonight disbelieving after he's come from glory to do these things amen before hannah could receive the answer she had to know what the question was the question wasn't just let me hold the baby the question was give me a son i'll give him back to you and god came down and and met that request the word becomes flesh the word became flesh to hannah the word christ became flesh 2 000 years ago the word christ the logos is revealed in our day the message is not something supplemental to god's plan the message is god's plan it's it's instrumental in what god is doing it's not peripheral on the extremities it's the center of it it's the mystery of god the part that's reserved for those that he loves you'll notice that about hannah it was written that she was in bitterness of soul that was the reality of the situation sometimes we think it's our mind sometimes we think it's our flag but she was in bitterness of soul and it was then that she wept and asked god if you give me a son i'll give him back to you and she was satisfied in her soul you see when david says lord unto thee do i lift up my soul he's speaking of something he says i'm not lifting up my flesh i'm not lifting up my spirit but lord i lift up my soul and then he says let me not be ashamed he's speaking about something because it's actually in the very same chapter and i think it's verse 7 where he says lord remember not the sins of my youth he's not talking about that kind of shame you see that we make mistakes in our flesh we are ashamed we make mistakes in our spirit our minds or because of our minds and we look at things the wrong way and we're ashamed but that's not what david says david says i'm lifting up my soul let the purpose of my life not be ashamed let not mine enemies triumph over me in other words let my soul come to the purpose that you called me too that's why the grace of god is here because we do things in the flesh we're ashamed of come on we've all done it david said remember not the sins of my youth we do things we think things we think things about one another we ought not to i'll i'll turn this direction while i'm preaching this part we we say things about each other we ought not to think those things we we ought not to think about that about somebody else you know that's one of the reasons that i hate social media is because it shows people in a state that is there they ought not to be in that kind of condition it shows sons and daughters of god even sons and daughters of believers that maybe go out into the world and live a life that they ought not to live but they're going to be there but right now they're in a condition of unbelief or they're in a condition of running from the lord and because of that they blasted all over facebook and i don't want to look at somebody that's where they where they ought not to be i'd rather think the thoughts of god that's a son or a daughter of god and they're predestinated before the foundation of the world and i don't care where they are today they're going to be if you knew where i came from you wouldn't believe that i would be here if they had facebook in my day when i was a teenager you'd say there's no hope for him but god didn't say that facebook is not the thoughts of god instagram is not the thoughts of god is there anyone else i gotta hit yeah i don't know the names of them all again i don't have them so you know it's like those are the two big i don't know twitter or whatever the point is that that that's not what's real what's real is what's in the thoughts of god amen there was a woman that came into a feast where jesus was at right and she saw that jesus was sitting there with unwashed feet and brother branham dwells on that jesus with dirty feet they ought to have washed his feet but jesus was unconcerned because he knew there was someone there that was going to wash his feet someone there whose purpose it was to wash his feet because jesus knew all things whatever the father showed him he knew it and he's sitting there with unwashed feet no doubt god had revealed to him the god in him revealed to him that you know just sit still she come by she snuck in a woman of ill fame that they all looked at her on face i mean sorry all looked at her and said if he knew who she really was but he knew who she really was and they didn't know what she really was because the flesh and the spirit were in bad condition but inside of the inside there was a predestinated purpose hallelujah and god had arranged the circumstances just for her and now there's the word and she said you know what i've had it with life i don't care what anybody thinks of me anymore i'm gonna go and i'm gonna wash his feet and she begins to wash his feet with her tears and begin to wipe them with the hairs of her head and jesus brother brown said he didn't even twitch he didn't move a muscle lest he scare her if he move her foot if he move his foot she might think he's trying to pull back and and you know my might be or sir but he was so careful yeah he was so careful for her listen aren't you glad god's careful of your complexes aren't you glad that he's careful about your feelings sometimes as ministers we fail we're not careful enough about people's feelings we're not careful enough i'll tell you what when i when i get up and preach i think i have it here you know i'm always careful to know who i'm preaching to i'll maybe move to that am i preaching am i one of the angels going down to sodom and preaching or i am am i part of the one that preached to abraham those two different types of sermons am i am i jonah that's crying out in the streets of nineveh repent or perish or am i moving on beyond that you know jonah let me let me read it to you the way brother brown is this okay so far all right can i take a little while longer all right 10 more minutes we'll say 10 more minutes all right give me your hand for 10 more minutes all right okay about 300 minutes okay all right now even as preachers i know what it is to preach to pentecostals done it a lot in uganda because there's a lot of them coming into the message it's a different kind of preaching and i know and i realized that in the service this morning and many times when i preach i'm preaching to the bride of jesus christ the beloved of the lord you are the ones that he loves and i try as a minister maybe sometimes i fail but i try to be very very respectful of who you are in his sight amen i'm not here to tell you you're nothing i'm here to tell you your everything amen to him your everything he gave everything he had for you he laid it all down yes then you might have life he laid it all down that i could live eternally i was lost and he laid it down for me he shed his own blood for me he paid the price that nobody else could pay and by paying that price he could open the seals he was the one that's worthy and because of him i stand here tonight and because of him you're here tonight and he loves you more than anything that's why paul said i'm persuaded nothing can separate us from that love but god for his great love wherewith he loved us all of those stories brother branham says you know as it he says in one place no matter how much i would pray for you being a sinner my prayers might not help or my prayers might help you i'm sorry and my persuasion might help you but i couldn't forgive one sin of yours god's already done that you have to accept it in christ when jesus died he saved everybody as far as god was concerned for he paid the full price of human redemption now don't think that i'm a universalist that believes everybody will be saved everybody's saved and will be i do not sir i believe that everybody was saved as far as god was concerned for jesus paid the full penalty of sin when he died now it will never do you no good until you accept it see you have to accept it and it's not how hard you cry how much you beg how much you persuade it's a surrendered heart to god with faith believing he's done it it says even our altar calls that we have in bringing people up around the altar they didn't do that in the bible time that's a tradition of our people formerly in the methodist church but look it's a good thing i don't like this dry eyed repentance i like to see somebody get up and really be sorry for what they've done and really mean it but be forgiven until you believe you're forgiven then you confess that you are and then you live like you are he says no one will still know no matter how much you cry how much you pray how much you shout how many times you speak in tongues whatever you do you're still not until the fruits of the spirit bear record in you in other words the life has to come into you to live a life out of you and god sends his spirit upon you when he recognizes your faith your faith that you were already saved at calvary so it's a justification by faith and now we realize that brother branham said in some places he says the the message is always repent or perish he takes it from jonah jonah crying out in the streets of nineveh he says always repent or perish but you know paul takes repentance and he says in ephesians or in hebrews rather chapter six therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ what's the principles baptism repentance surrender faith justification by faith believing in the atonement all of those things therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards god of the doctrine of baptism laying on hands resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment so he's saying now let us go on unto perfection what is that that actually is the word integrity in the old testament so when david cries out let integrity and uprightness preserve me he's actually making a statement that most people don't understand because the english word integrity has taken on a different meaning and integrity as we view it now is largely a facet of character you know that's that person has good integrity you know it's like faithful or or you know they're they're a good person or something like that but that's not what the word meant when david used it the word integrity actually means the fundamental idea of it is an idea of completeness and so that's the word that paul is using in hebrews there's two words for perfection one means without error and one we one means uh complete or whole and that's the word paul is using here in hebrews 6 when he says let us go on into perfection or let us go on unto the whole matter or the whole life or the life of completion or maturity and so all of those words are instructive as we look at this now as we bring this to a close this morning and and the word integrity actually you is used by samuel of jesse just to give you an idea of what i'm talking about when samuel is instructed of god to go into jesse's house all right and he sees like here this morning six boys one two three four five six he comes to the first one says oh this is surely the king he's the great stature go ahead stand up and he's great stature and he's a mighty man of valor and oh you know he's got to be the king and god says don't anoint him he's not the one sit down and he goes to the next one go ahead stand up he says oh look at this guy he's really got it together and he's got a surely he's the king no that's not him sorry sit down this one skipped out stand up number four wow this guy's head and shoulders above the rest he's surely the guy you know he's the one don't feel bad i'm head and shoulders above the rest too and so he's the one no don't sit down yet see you're already thinking of yourself too little and and and he's thinking well the first three got rejected the odds are i'm the one no sorry have a seat number six number five is this the one no sorry number six this is the last one that's here this has got to be the one let's get the cruise of oil and let's anoint them with the blackberry all right he's not the one i know you don't understand have a seat here comes number three now and he's thinking i know god said to come here he's here present speaking to me he didn't choose any of these six and he says to jesse he says is this your whole family is this the in other words is this the completeness of it is everybody present and so and and jesse says no he says there's one more hallelujah the first stage was good the second age was good the third age was good the fourth age luther raising up that was good what a mighty man of valor the fifth age i guess was luther the six h was wesley what a mighty man of god what's your name ian but wesley age was the six age and then it's like is that everybody no there's still more to come that's not the whole of it without us they cannot be made perfect or complete and without david jesse's family was not complete as far as jesse was concerned you might even say he was an afterthought you might even say david was one of those unexpected babies see what i'm saying but that's not in god's thoughts in god's thoughts he was the one you see in other words god's thoughts were not complete without david all right now let's go a little bit further in this thought before we close here we're coming down to the close the word uh integrity also means is also the word used for without blemish and that it it and and the word without blemish is not always what we think it is and i'm sorry i just have to stir your minds up a little bit because you're all thinking where is he going this morning but it's it's something the with the lamb without blemish didn't just mean it didn't have any scars it also meant it was whole it wasn't missing anything that everything required to make it a perfect lamb was there and that speaks of the sacrifice of jesus christ you can read about it in leviticus 22 in first peter chapter one as he says but the pr first peter chapter one says but the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot sometimes we think the word without blemish means without spot without blemish means the completeness of it the entirety of it in other words jesus was not just without mistake or without sin but he was also everything that was required in the sacrifice he fulfilled the entirety of it he was the fullness of the measure of a sacrifice that had to be made for you and i as the songwriter said living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away but there's one more step rising he justified in other words jesus rising from the dead showed that the sacrifice was accepted because many men died on the cross many men gave their blood many men went to hell but one man rose from the dead that was our lord jesus christ showing that he was the sacrifice without blemish he was the entirety of it as paul says one sacrifice for all everything that you ever did in the past every mistake you make today and everything that you will do in the future he's the entirety of it do you believe that this morning then if he's the entirety of it this morning then no matter what you do in your life the price is already paid it's not the sacrifice and your repentance it's not the sacrifice and your good works it's not the sacrifice and your efforts it's not the sacrifice and your revelation or and your understanding or anything like that no jesus paid the price for all if you can understand that that's why he was slain in the mind of god before the foundation of the world the price was already paid there's nothing that you can do in addition to that that will pay any iota of price all you have to believe is in the finished sacrifice hallelujah it's not of you it's not of me it's entirely of him yes it brings us to repentance yes it causes us to feel grief because of the mistakes that we make every day even as believers amen but here's the entire sacrifice he knew the mistakes and sins i made yesterday and he knows i'll say it the way brother braham says it he knows you're just a man or a woman and you're going to make mistakes but you mustn't look at your mistakes it's your heart towards him i'm sorry it just takes all of the fear out of the gospel because i don't believe that his bride is to live by fear i believe his bride is to walk by the revelation of the love that he has for her and that's what this message is it's a love letter it's the final love union between the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride it's it's not just a message of repentance yes when we believe we repent i believe repent baptize in the name of jesus christ you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost i believe in all of that and that's the foundation but then paul says let us go unto perfection let's let us go on unto the entirety of it let's go on into the fullness of what god has for us god is faithful to the integrity of his word heavens and earth will pass away but this word will never pass away god is faithful to it if you believe this word if you hang on to this word he'll be faithful to you but to be made whole is the word integrity many times in the scripture it's about healing i know we're about done here but excuse me if i just got to take another step to be made whole in the body the woman with the blood issue was made whole all right that's the same word to be made whole but though you're made whole in your body that integrity will fail you'll get sick again all right that's just the reality of the body divine healing is not permanent it's not like salvation all right there's there are things in our minds when actually when you're born again you receive a new mind or will say a renewed mind it looses you from your complexes it looses you from your fear but don't think the devil will never try and put a calm another complex on you i i i appreciate i have a good friend in uganda brother steven o'bally wonderful brother and and uh been a real friend over the years known him since the 80s and the lord's really using him there but he said something to me someday that just actually broke a complex that i had he said you know i decided one day that it was a waste of time to be nervous i was like why didn't i think of that but you know since that time every time i get nervous i'm thinking what good is this going to do me i'm nervous when i get to the pulpit i'm nervous when i'm preaching in a new place i'm nervous about all those things and then it's like well i'm going to do it anyway so no sense of being nervous about it it's just going to hit me amen brother aaron yeah i guess i'm preaching brother aaron this morning you know we all get nervous in different things in life but if god's in it if god be for us who can be against us there's things in our minds that you know god will deliver us one time and it tries to come back on us again that's just the battle of the mind that's where the battleground is how many are in a battle we're all in a battle how many know the battle is in your mind all right that's where the battleground is it's god versus satan we thank god i think brother aaron said right at the beginning of the service there's something within the soul that comes on the scene to conquer all things the power of the word that lays within the believer but god has and this is what i'm coming to now before we close god's most important things almost said that three times god values and will maintain the integrity of the word you see and it's actually the word purpose in your soul that cannot be broken and when david says i lift up my soul and let integrity preserve me he's actually saying lord let the purpose that you put in my life never be broken i may fail you and i'm sorry for it and david did fail god many times you know i may fall short i may not understand how it all works but lord i lift unto you my soul i give you my soul i give you who i am let it be what you want it to be i didn't select myself when my brothers were all sitting there and the seventh i came in as the seventh and i got anointed with oil i didn't ask to be anointed above shama i didn't ask to be anointed above the other ones all i know is i just came in from the field because the prophet was there and lo and behold he anointed me to be king lord you chose me i didn't choose you lord you sent this message by my way i didn't find the message lord you sent a prophet i wasn't asking for a prophet lord you revealed the word to me i didn't go to a theological school to understand this word you revealed it to me so lord let integrity preserve me let the integrity or the eternal purpose of the word of god keep me day by day because revelation 10 is the integrity of the redemptive purpose of god the lamb must come forth to claim those that are predestinated to eternal life he's maintaining the integrity of the purpose of god and the integrity of the message will preserve you it's the completeness of it of the progressive revelation of the word of god that has come down to this last days and it must keep every son and daughter of god that's why god attaches you to the revelation of the word in this hour matches you to it because that sin is his wholeness that's his integrity that's his entire purpose being revealed and you're a part of it because you're predestinated a part of it to this day and see god will is always faithful to the integrity of his word and those who fail that god will deal with remember god said how shall i get the words of elijah to be fulfilled in the days of ahab elijah's gone but now micaiah is on the scene how will i get the words to be fulfilled god even used a lying spirit to go down into the mouths of prophet to send ahab out to the battle that the prophecy of elijah would be fulfilled why god was maintaining the integrity of the word see there's times when those that did not maintain the integrity they paid the price moses smote the rock the second time instead of speaking to the rock he broke the integrity of the word and god said all right moses because you've done that now you won't go into the promised land you'll see it but you won't go in brother branham had to pay the price a couple times in his own life one time in south africa when he disobeyed the vision and he got extremely sick the other time was the brown bear vision you understand that you listen to brother biscuit's testimony about the brown bear vision the brown bear was there everything was in place but brother branham didn't go where he was supposed to go to and he stead instead went with bud southwick instead of going with brother biscuit and the other brother i forget who it was billy paul or somebody and in that direction because if he had gone that direction they saw the bear and he would have shot the bear and because of that then they had miserable weather and they had to cancel their trip everything turned see you can't break the integrity of god's word no matter who you are because god protects the integrity of his word but the ramp says in perfect faith the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are jesus had faith in the word of god that said what he was it's written of me didn't david in the psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of me i'm the bread of life that comes down from heaven i'm the tree of life in the garden of eden i am all these things i am that i am before abraham as i am with that a perfect faith that he was the anointed messiah and the spirit of god was upon him jesus had perfect faith he had it and it come because he was the word and you become the word as you receive the word and when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for and you shall have it it'll be given you time space nothing else will ever change it you know it's done and it's already over with let integrity preserve me in the midst of a crumbling world the integrity of god's purpose will preserve you in this age he's anointed the word for this hour we speak from wholeness a restored word we speak from a a maturity of the word in this age this message is not something that that's undermines or or that is uh this message is the culmination of all that god purpose this is the fulfillment of his integrity because if you understand that that means god will protect this message we don't have to protect it god will take this message to its final purpose because it's part of the integrity of the word of god with the musicians come we're living in a crumbling age aren't we it's a it's a terrible age that america is called the greatest nation in the world i know you all believe that and it may very well be but it's falling apart why is it falling apart because it rejected the integrity of god's word and and nebuchadnezzar saw it in a dream and daniel interpreted the dream to nebuchadnezzar and said you know there was a head of gold and sil shoulders and of and arms of silver and breastplate of brass and loins of iron and legs of iron and clay on down to the feet and all of that and it says then a rock was hewed out of the mountain
