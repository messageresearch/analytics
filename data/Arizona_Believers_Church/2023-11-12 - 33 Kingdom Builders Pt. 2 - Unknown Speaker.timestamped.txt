[0:00] I'd like to take a second part on the
[0:02] title Kingdom Builders and if you could
[0:05] maybe just look over in Isaiah chap 11
[0:08] quickly as we want to touch on a few
[0:09] verses there and I'm going to spend some
[0:13] time in the outset relaying a little bit
[0:15] of a foundation uh so that we're all on
[0:17] the same page and that'll so we'll just
[0:19] use this opportunity in the beginning to
[0:22] uh collect a few thoughts instead of
[0:24] just prefacing it with a few comments
[0:26] we'll just look into the scripture in
[0:28] Isaiah chap 11 if you were to read
[0:30] Around verses 6 to verse uh 10 verse 11
[0:34] you'll see that there's a description of
[0:35] the the wolf and the lamb dwelling
[0:37] together the cow and the bear feeding
[0:39] together uh eating a lion eating a straw
[0:43] like an ox a child playing before the
[0:45] hole of the ASP and uh nothing shall
[0:48] hurt or destroy in all my Holy Mountain
[0:50] it's describing a millennial we call it
[0:53] a millennial Condition it's a
[0:54] Thousand-Year Reign so Millennial has
[0:56] come to be used as an adjective to
[0:58] describe a time of Peace A Time time of
[1:00] righteousness a time of perfection and
[1:03] this is this description is carried over
[1:05] in other parts Isaiah 65 and a lot of
[1:07] different places we see this
[1:08] Thousand-Year reign of Christ upon the
[1:10] Earth uh it's a kingdom it's a kingdom
[1:14] upon Earth wherein uh sin is held uh
[1:17] held at Bay and righteousness Reigns on
[1:21] Earth for a Thousand-Year period and
[1:23] verse 9 describes it this way they shall
[1:25] not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy
[1:27] Mountain for the Earth shall be full of
[1:30] the knowledge of the Lord as the waters
[1:32] cover the sea what I'm going to
[1:34] summarize last couple Services is is say
[1:37] this that knowledge has the effect of
[1:39] purifying that the knowledge of God
[1:41] fills the entire Earth as the waters
[1:43] cover the sea and because the knowledge
[1:46] of the Lord is filling up things it it
[1:48] has the effect of cleaning out it has
[1:50] the effect of purifying and when it
[1:52] speaks of the knowledge of the lord we
[1:54] can think appropriately about
[1:56] understanding and wisdom and Revelation
[1:57] those are other ways to describe how
[2:00] that this knowledge may be utilized or
[2:02] how that it might come or how what it
[2:03] would look like and so these things uh
[2:07] have the effect of purging the world and
[2:10] establishing a kingdom upon Earth where
[2:12] in Christ is the preeminent one through
[2:14] his bride and in all the world it
[2:17] creates this we call a millennial
[2:19] Kingdom in verse two it says this and
[2:22] the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon
[2:23] him the spirit of wisdom and
[2:25] understanding the spirit of counsel and
[2:27] might the spirit of knowledge and of the
[2:29] fear of the Lord and shall make him of
[2:31] quick understanding the fear of the Lord
[2:33] and he shall not judge after the sight
[2:35] of his eyes neither reprove after the
[2:37] hearing of his ears ears this tells us
[2:41] that this is why there's going to be
[2:44] this Kingdom upon Earth if there wasn't
[2:46] a king there couldn't be a kingdom and
[2:48] this Kingdom requiring a domain and a
[2:50] king uh there's this dominion over the
[2:53] entire Earth uh because and and because
[2:56] he has this Dominion it produces that
[2:59] peaceful Kingdom om and what we're
[3:01] wanting to bring before you is that this
[3:04] Christ Millennial Reign parallels what
[3:06] he can do when he reigns in our hearts
[3:09] now the effect that Christ literally
[3:11] reigning on Earth for A Thousand Years
[3:13] brother brandham said the third coming
[3:15] is when he returns back to Earth in a
[3:16] Corporal body he said that's the coming
[3:19] most people are looking for why they're
[3:20] looking for a physical return of Christ
[3:22] uh but that when he comes back
[3:24] physically to the Earth and he's here
[3:26] literally on the earth and his literal
[3:28] presence upon the Earth Earth in
[3:30] reigning with his bride is going to
[3:31] produce this glorious Kingdom and I'm
[3:33] want you to see a parallel of what that
[3:36] reign will be in the Millennium to what
[3:38] his Reign right now literally in your
[3:40] soul can cause through the word of God
[3:44] as Paul writes that Christ May dwell in
[3:46] your hearts by faith so it's Christ who
[3:49] dwells in your heart it's the king upon
[3:51] his throne in your individual lives and
[3:53] if a reigning King will produce a
[3:55] condition in the Millennium then could
[3:57] he not do that in you now that's that's
[3:59] what we're wanting to inspire you at
[4:01] least getting you to think about now
[4:03] Ephesians chapter 1 verse1 17 says this
[4:06] is Paul's prayer that the Lord the that
[4:09] the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[4:11] father of Glory may give unto you the
[4:14] spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the
[4:17] knowledge of him again now this is a lot
[4:18] of review from the prior service Paul's
[4:21] prayer is that we would he would give
[4:23] unto this the spirit of wisdom and
[4:25] Revelation in the knowledge of him I'm
[4:28] going to summarize some stat that we
[4:30] read from the church age book but
[4:32] brother Bram is detailing this is me me
[4:34] summarizing you'll see this very very
[4:36] plainly there in in the church age book
[4:39] that the that the operation of the Holy
[4:41] Ghost in the bride is Vindicated by the
[4:43] Revelation it gives amen now think about
[4:46] that the operation of the Holy Ghost is
[4:49] Vindicated by the Revelation it gives
[4:52] now that's going to work counter to what
[4:53] we think the operation of the Holy Ghost
[4:55] is because we think the operation of the
[4:56] Holy Ghost would be C some kind of
[4:58] manifestation of the spirit through
[5:00] physical demonstration uh maybe someone
[5:03] being slain in the spirit or or somebody
[5:05] shouting or dancing or crying or
[5:06] speaking in tongu some gift manifest
[5:08] itself and you say well that's that's
[5:10] the operation of the Holy Ghost
[5:12] absolutely but it brother Bram through
[5:14] several passages is trying us to
[5:16] understand that the operation of the
[5:17] Holy Ghost in the bride will vindicate
[5:20] Itself by the Revelation it gives
[5:22] because the Holy Ghost can't reveal
[5:24] something contrary to the word and that
[5:27] and that can the word cannot be imperson
[5:29] everything else
[5:31] can and so he he details how that
[5:34] Revelation by the holy spirit is what
[5:36] gives us authority over the devil that's
[5:39] that's real genuine Authority Revelation
[5:41] by the holy spirit gives us authority
[5:43] over the devil and he's saying there's
[5:44] nothing as such prevailing power so
[5:47] there's no greater power than the power
[5:49] of
[5:50] Revelation can you catch that principle
[5:52] maybe jot it down if you want to put a
[5:54] question mark next to it um that's what
[5:56] I do in my notes if something said and I
[5:57] want to go back and look at it I'll put
[5:58] a question Mark kind of highlight it
[6:00] you're fine to use a question mark today
[6:02] is is there no greater power than
[6:04] Revelation well brother says there's
[6:06] nothing as such prevailing power as
[6:08] Revelation he said that the importance
[6:10] of it to a True Believer can never be
[6:11] overemphasized so there's a lot of
[6:13] weight to
[6:15] Revelation and brother bradam says in
[6:17] the patmas vision he says if there's
[6:19] anything good that will come to me it
[6:22] has to be revealed by the spirit so if
[6:25] there's any good that'll come it has to
[6:26] be revealed by the spirit confirmed by
[6:28] the word and made manifest by the
[6:30] results it Bears amen uh we it's often
[6:33] quoted I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard
[6:35] neither has entered in the heart of man
[6:36] the things that God has prepared for
[6:38] them that love him and people stop there
[6:40] but Paul says but he hath revealed them
[6:42] to us by his spirit and it's important
[6:45] to catch the context Paul is saying this
[6:48] while he's saying hey I didn't come to
[6:50] you uh with the Excellency of speech or
[6:52] wisdom when I declared to you the
[6:54] testimony of God in other words he's
[6:56] saying I declared to you things that you
[6:58] couldn't know know by human study or
[7:01] human discipline and I've declared to
[7:03] you the things that have been revealed
[7:04] to me and that's Vindication that this
[7:07] is
[7:08] God when God's making himself known and
[7:11] revealing himself so it made manifest by
[7:14] the results it bears and that's another
[7:16] good thing it's confirmed by the word
[7:17] and it manifests itself as surely as
[7:20] John needed to be in the spirit that was
[7:22] a real thrust of that last service how
[7:24] what it means to be in the
[7:25] spirit as John was in the spirit he
[7:28] heard
[7:30] he turned he was turned and he saw and
[7:33] that's what when you're in the spirit
[7:34] you're going to hear the word of God
[7:35] it's going to turn you and you're going
[7:37] to
[7:38] see and so John needed to be in the
[7:40] spirit to receive these tremendous
[7:41] Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to
[7:44] be in the spirit to understand the
[7:46] Revelation Revelations that God has
[7:48] given to us to live by in his word for
[7:51] it is the same spirit amen we must be in
[7:54] the
[7:55] spirit and we must understand what it
[7:57] means to be in the spirit or or if I
[8:00] could put it this way we must understand
[8:01] the most important aspect of being in
[8:04] the spirit is not how it makes us feel
[8:07] in mind or body but what it does to our
[8:09] understanding Paul says in 1 Corinthians
[8:11] chapter 14: 14 and 15 for if I pray in
[8:15] an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but
[8:17] my understanding is unfruitful much
[8:20] larger thought that is's expressing how
[8:22] in speaking in tongues we sound like
[8:23] barbarians and there gives an uncertain
[8:25] sound and how is someone going to know
[8:27] how to prepare for battle it's a much
[8:28] larger thought but for time's sake I
[8:30] just wanted to bring this out he's
[8:32] saying my understanding does not benefit
[8:35] what I'm saying what is being done
[8:36] there's no benefit to it when I pray
[8:39] with an unknown tongue he says my spirit
[8:41] prays but my understanding is unfruitful
[8:45] what is it then I will pray with the
[8:47] spirit now brother Ram quotes this in
[8:49] this patas Vision I believe he said I
[8:50] will whatever I do I'll sing I'll pray
[8:52] I'll dce whatever I'll do I'll do in the
[8:54] spirit he says I will pray with the
[8:55] spirit and I will pray with the
[8:57] understanding also I will sing with the
[9:00] spirit and I will sing with the
[9:02] understanding also if I could say this
[9:04] to be in the spirit brother B show is to
[9:06] be in the spirit of Revelation people
[9:08] don't dig down deep enough to get in the
[9:09] spirit of Revelation to be in the spirit
[9:12] is to be in the spirit of Revelation and
[9:14] to be in the spirit of revelation will
[9:16] manifest itself in wisdom and
[9:18] understanding so Paul is saying if I'm
[9:20] going to pray in the spirit let it be
[9:23] also with understanding in the with in
[9:25] the understanding with the understanding
[9:27] I will sing in the spirit and I will
[9:28] sing with the understanding also so that
[9:31] it might edify that it might build up
[9:33] that it might be fruitful so recognize
[9:35] how he's saying that with the spirit is
[9:37] being joined with the
[9:40] understanding there's a there's a unity
[9:42] and a Harmony between the
[9:44] two and Paul says in Galatians chapter
[9:47] 3:3 he says are you so foolish there
[9:49] this is just kind of pointing my finger
[9:51] to a lot a lot more teaching in this
[9:53] this book he says are you so foolish
[9:56] having begun in the spirit are you now
[9:58] made perfect by the flesh we could make
[10:02] a parallel behind between what Paul is
[10:05] recognizing the galatian church how they
[10:07] began in the spirit uh they had heard of
[10:09] Christ and they believed and now they're
[10:11] being brought back into Jewish
[10:13] Traditions it wasn't that they if I
[10:15] could say they left Jewish Traditions
[10:17] but what they were believing in as Jews
[10:19] is being fulfilled in Jesus Christ and
[10:22] so there was no point in going back to
[10:25] the things that God used to foreshadow
[10:27] what was coming there was no point to go
[10:29] back to certain traditions and certain
[10:30] manifestations and certain works and
[10:32] certain things because the the substance
[10:35] had come and so now that the substance
[10:37] had come that the Traditions had worked
[10:40] and they could move on now there's a
[10:42] tremendous parallel in our day between
[10:45] the Jewish traditions and the Jewish
[10:47] legalism if I could even put it that way
[10:49] and the Pentecostal tra and I want to
[10:51] say lowercase p Pentecostal traditions
[10:54] and legalism that we ourselves having
[10:56] been called out of it can go go right
[10:59] back to in the same way that the Jews
[11:02] were going back to their traditions and
[11:04] their legalism as if to say it didn't
[11:07] bring them to where they needed to be
[11:09] and we need to be very careful because
[11:11] we've had a message come at this hour
[11:13] and take the Pentecostal Church where
[11:15] God had brought them and they had
[11:17] established traditions and they had a
[11:19] certain way of worship and God wanted to
[11:21] bring them into the full truth and I
[11:23] believe the message could be the same
[11:25] today don't be foolish and go back to
[11:29] carnal things to try to be made
[11:33] perfect cuz what makes perfect not the
[11:36] flesh not the not these certain
[11:38] traditions of the flesh or legalism none
[11:40] of that can be can make us
[11:43] perfect there's a true genuine
[11:46] Pentecost and then there's there's a
[11:48] perversion of it because couldn't we say
[11:51] that the true genuine Judaism and Jewish
[11:54] religion was now embodied in
[11:56] Christianity they were real Jews cuz
[11:59] they had received their Messiah so
[12:01] there's a there's a falseness to holding
[12:03] to former lights and former glares and
[12:05] as Paul is talking about praying in an
[12:07] unknown tongue he says if I pray in an
[12:08] unknown tongue my understanding is
[12:11] unfruitful and we use this parallel
[12:13] maybe of what's become and been made as
[12:15] Pentecostal Traditions or legalism
[12:17] brother BR been talking about tongues
[12:19] and we could even say in some way
[12:20] certain manifestation of the gifts he's
[12:23] identifying this in the church and he
[12:25] says your Pentecostal version is already
[12:28] backed Genesis again in
[12:31] Babel so there is a Pentecostal version
[12:35] of gifts and tongues that brother bam
[12:37] says is back in Genesis as a tower of
[12:39] babyl in
[12:41] confusion because there are there's
[12:43] Traditions associated with the operation
[12:45] of the Holy Ghost that present a certain
[12:47] way and brother Bram saying now that's a
[12:50] version that's not necessarily the
[12:52] original is everybody with me in the
[12:56] sermon uncertain sound brother bam says
[12:57] they shall speak with new tongues now
[12:59] that we recognize that as being
[13:01] prophetic being scriptural but there's a
[13:03] certain way that that manifested on the
[13:05] day of Pentecost which was outstanding
[13:08] and and Beyond what Paul is talking
[13:10] about or is exactly what Paul was trying
[13:12] to identify that if you speak in an
[13:14] unknown tongue and other people don't
[13:16] understand that's for yourself that's in
[13:18] the spirit nobody's going to take that
[13:19] away from you but that's not what was
[13:22] the original amen because brother
[13:24] brandham says they shall I don't mean
[13:26] the uncertain sound this is him giving
[13:29] his some emphasis to this prophecy they
[13:31] shall speak with knowledge with
[13:33] Revelation they had the real gift of
[13:36] speaking in
[13:37] tongues said every man heard in their
[13:39] own language but what we're not told
[13:41] just exactly what they were even
[13:43] saying right people weren't sitting
[13:45] there saying well he just said Fifi tie
[13:46] your bow tie on right that wasn't what
[13:50] they were saying they were hearing
[13:51] something that there was something being
[13:54] said of weight and substance brother
[13:56] bradam says that to speak in new tongues
[13:58] if it's the genuine Pentecost and not
[14:00] some other Pentecostal version that's
[14:02] trying to be passed off he says they
[14:04] spoke with knowledge and Revelation and
[14:06] that was the real gift of tongues
[14:08] brother baham says new tongues is
[14:09] spiritual Revelation if you want to
[14:12] speak in true genuine original genuine
[14:15] version of Pentecost you speak with
[14:17] wisdom you speak with understanding you
[14:19] speak with spiritual
[14:21] Revelation am they shall speak with
[14:24] knowledge with Revelation brother bam
[14:25] says in Satan's
[14:27] Eden he says brother Neville say this
[14:29] morning someone might not have someone
[14:31] might have been asking him why I didn't
[14:33] preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do
[14:35] this here it is the Holy Ghost is the
[14:38] action in
[14:39] you and and I'm sure what it was is why
[14:41] aren't you preaching on uh the gifts and
[14:44] why aren't you preaching on uh the Holy
[14:46] Ghost and what it can do in a church
[14:47] service and how it can manifest itself
[14:49] and maybe there's a little conjecture on
[14:51] my part but based upon what he says here
[14:53] he says I'll tell you the Holy Ghost is
[14:55] is action is the action in you it's a li
[14:59] life not an
[15:01] emotion not some sort of a fleshly
[15:04] evidence why don't you teach on the Holy
[15:06] Ghost and speaking in tongues and
[15:07] shouting and dancing and screaming and
[15:09] running around why don't you do that why
[15:10] don't you encour encourage that
[15:12] emphasize that he says well because
[15:13] that's not really what it's
[15:15] about I that would be the wrong
[15:19] emphasis I think sometimes the reason
[15:21] why we would default to that is because
[15:23] we've lost our faith in the power of God
[15:27] and we're trying to convince ourselves
[15:28] the message is right by producing a pep
[15:31] rally that makes us feel good about
[15:35] it he says the Holy Ghost is the action
[15:37] in you it's a life not an emotion not
[15:39] some sort of fleshly evidence but it is
[15:41] a person Jesus Christ the word of God
[15:44] established in your heart to Quicken
[15:47] every word of this age of this age not
[15:51] another age but this age right watch the
[15:53] Holy Ghost In Action not so much in
[15:57] demonstrations and I believe what he's
[15:59] referring to in this in demonstrations
[16:01] because you don't want to completely do
[16:03] away with demonstration that's where you
[16:04] go on the wrong other side but he's
[16:06] talking about your Pentecostal version
[16:08] of it which is right back in Babel again
[16:10] confusion and nonsense and Chaos he says
[16:13] not so much in demonstrations if we
[16:14] could say maybe not an emotion and some
[16:16] sort of fleshly evidence but an action
[16:19] what it does according to the
[16:21] word what it does according to the word
[16:25] that's the Holy Spirit In Action amen so
[16:28] he says not so much in
[16:31] demonstrations in 1 Corinthians chapter
[16:33] 2: 4 and
[16:38] 5 we're looking at the power of God and
[16:42] how that Paul connects this with
[16:44] something he says and my speech and my
[16:46] preaching was not with enticing words of
[16:49] man's
[16:50] Wisdom but in the demonstration of the
[16:53] spirit and the power so his speech and
[16:55] preaching were a demonstration of the
[16:57] spirit and the power
[16:59] but not enticing words of man's Wisdom
[17:02] that your faith should not stand in the
[17:05] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[17:09] what is the most prevailing power
[17:12] Revelation could we say could that be
[17:14] the greatest power it's the most
[17:16] prevailing it's the strongest so Paul is
[17:18] not carving out and excluding wisdom
[17:21] Revelation understanding and I think
[17:23] it's important for us to think about
[17:24] this because when he makes a statement
[17:26] such as when I came to you not with the
[17:27] Excellency of speech or of wisdom then
[17:30] we H declar to you the testimony of God
[17:32] in our minds we think that oh then the
[17:34] power of God has to be demonstrated
[17:36] through some sort of fleshly sign on
[17:39] alone like that's real power you can say
[17:41] everything you want you can say whatever
[17:43] you want and say it and say it and teach
[17:44] it and place it do everything you want
[17:45] but that's not the power of God the
[17:47] power of God is when it does something
[17:48] to me right and that would be missing it
[17:52] that would be missing what Paul is
[17:53] saying cuz he's not saying there was no
[17:55] speech and there was no preaching and it
[17:57] wasn't it was just like Paul said I'll
[17:58] show you the power of
[18:01] God right that's not what he was doing
[18:05] he said I demonstrated the power of God
[18:07] through my
[18:09] preaching because the most prevailing
[18:11] power is revelation what was he
[18:12] preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ
[18:14] the Revelation for that age brother Bram
[18:16] in the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[18:18] chapter one of the church age book now
[18:19] we've been talking about the offices and
[18:21] manifestations of the one true God and
[18:23] beholding His glory in a scriptural
[18:25] study but he is not to be known
[18:27] intellectually
[18:29] this is what Paul is talking about I'm
[18:30] not coming to you with my ideas not
[18:32] coming to you with Traditions I'm not
[18:33] not coming to you with studies of the
[18:34] Rabin I'm not coming to you uh with uh
[18:37] interpretations I'm coming to you with
[18:39] Christ who is being spiritually revealed
[18:42] he says he is known spiritually by
[18:45] spiritual Revelation the spirit of man
[18:47] cannot know God it is the Revelation
[18:50] given by the spirit that allows man to
[18:51] know God it's the only way that you can
[18:54] know him nobody can say that Jesus is
[18:56] Christ except by the Holy Ghost ghost no
[18:59] man can know the father no man can know
[19:01] the son except to whom the father
[19:03] reveals
[19:06] him so now is he's talking about speech
[19:09] and preaching and the demonstration of
[19:11] the spirit and the power in 1
[19:13] Corinthians chap 2: 12 and 13 now we
[19:16] have received not the spirit of the
[19:18] world but the spirit which is of god
[19:20] that we might know the things that are
[19:23] freely given to us of God how are they
[19:26] given they're revealed yes they're
[19:28] revealed by the spirit as he said but
[19:30] God hath revealed them to us by his
[19:32] spirit so we have received the spirit
[19:35] which is of god that we might know we
[19:38] have received the baptism of the Holy
[19:40] Ghost that we might know by Revelation
[19:42] the things of God which things also we
[19:46] speak so what was it that Paul was kind
[19:48] of circling back to to say this is where
[19:51] the power was CU I wasn't preaching to
[19:53] you things that you could find in our
[19:54] old tradition I wasn't preaching to you
[19:56] things that you could figure out on your
[19:57] own I was preaching to you things that
[19:59] God has revealed to me by his spirit and
[20:02] that's the power of
[20:05] God which things also we speak not in
[20:07] The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth
[20:09] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[20:12] comparing spiritual things with
[20:14] spiritual that's the power of God the
[20:17] inside teacher teaching us the things of
[20:20] God and brother bam takes this very
[20:22] scripture and this is and as he points
[20:25] out to this scripture and he reads from
[20:26] it and makes reference to it 1
[20:28] Corinthians 2 and I think in the church
[20:30] age book it might say verse 14 or 15 but
[20:33] it's this this he's saying comparing uh
[20:36] spiritual things were spiritual and
[20:37] using these verses here this is how
[20:38] brother Bram uh summarizes it the true
[20:41] Revelation is God interpreting his own
[20:43] word by vindicating what is
[20:47] Promised the true Revelation is God
[20:49] interpreting his own word by vindicating
[20:51] what is Promised man's Wisdom lacks the
[20:54] Holy Spirit teaching right man's Wisdom
[20:57] lacks the Revel ation and it is only by
[21:00] the word that we can know that we're
[21:02] overcoming it is only by Revelation that
[21:05] we can overcome that is that is how that
[21:07] we overcome and so we can't we cannot
[21:11] make the mistake of belittling and
[21:13] devaluing where the power of God
[21:17] rests so he comes to verse seven or
[21:20] we're going to arrive at verse seven
[21:21] here and Paul says but we speak the
[21:23] wisdom of God in a
[21:25] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[21:28] ordained before the world under our
[21:32] Glory so it calls it the hidden wisdom
[21:34] of God in a mystery so the hidden wisdom
[21:37] of God is a
[21:39] mystery the hidden wisdom of God is what
[21:41] he's
[21:43] preaching and he says we speak it in a
[21:46] mystery and we understand that if I can
[21:48] say this wisdom is the principal thing
[21:51] with all thy therefore get wisdom the
[21:53] Bible says so wisdom is the principal
[21:55] thing we speak the wisdom of God in in a
[21:58] mystery even the hidden wisdom uh uh
[22:01] hidden uh hidden
[22:03] wisdom now again in the church age book
[22:06] brother BR says not the wisdom of God is
[22:07] a mystery says but a mystery requires
[22:10] the teaching of the spirit or it never
[22:12] becomes
[22:13] clear you got to have the teaching of
[22:15] the spirit or the wisdom of God never
[22:17] becomes clear and as long as it remains
[22:20] unclear it can't be fully effective for
[22:23] you how we need to hear from God and lay
[22:26] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[22:29] spirit to hear and
[22:32] know if there's one thing we ought to
[22:34] call upon God for more than anything
[22:35] it's Revelation if there's anything we
[22:38] ought to lay on the horns of the Altar
[22:39] for anything more than anything it's to
[22:42] hear and to know he tells us beyond
[22:44] anything else if you want to lay before
[22:46] God and say God give me the gift of
[22:48] speaking in tongues Lord I want to speak
[22:50] in tongues brother bam said if you lay
[22:52] before the altar long enough God will
[22:54] let you do it and tongues is a gift of
[22:57] the spirit it's wonderful but the
[22:59] emphasis was never on I want to pray
[23:01] enough till I start shouting I want to
[23:03] sing enough till I start dancing he says
[23:05] not to open ourselves up to some sort of
[23:07] fleshly evidence but to lay ourselves
[23:11] open and become yielded to the spirit to
[23:13] hear and
[23:17] know I say maybe once we start hearing
[23:20] and knowing that's when the real Joy
[23:21] Bells begin to ring that's when the real
[23:24] manifestations begin to
[23:26] follow so wisdom is a mystery a mystery
[23:30] is only known by
[23:33] Revelation and so then think of the
[23:35] importance of knowing the mystery right
[23:37] I wanted to point to a couple scriptures
[23:39] real quickly just so we could have this
[23:41] kind of lodged in our
[23:44] thinking uh the the concept of a mystery
[23:46] the concept of Revelation is no
[23:48] unfamiliar topic to us as message
[23:50] Believers but if the holy spirit is to
[23:54] come and Quicken every word of this age
[23:58] then there's prophecies that relate to
[24:00] this
[24:01] age that must be quickened to us or
[24:04] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[24:06] it never becomes
[24:07] clear there's things that God has
[24:09] promised to do in this age very specific
[24:12] prophecies that God has promised to do
[24:14] in this age I remember one time I was in
[24:16] a pastor's home and I uh we were just
[24:20] Fellowship was good Fellowship as before
[24:21] we were going to be ministering that
[24:22] weekend and the brother made a comment
[24:24] there's so many scriptures in the Bible
[24:26] brother Aaron that have yet to be
[24:28] fulfilled that we believing that God's
[24:29] going to fulfill and I thought awesome
[24:32] right like this is great and I was like
[24:33] well which ones are you thinking about
[24:36] because I at the moment at that moment I
[24:37] thought that we're going to get into
[24:39] some good stuff and I was like well
[24:41] which ones are are you referring to and
[24:43] he goes well I don't have a Bible on me
[24:45] brother Aaron I I can't show you all the
[24:47] scriptures that haven't been fulfilled
[24:48] that we're believing in and at that
[24:49] moment I thought wait a
[24:52] minute there's this is this is a little
[24:56] bit different setting and situ situation
[24:58] that I thought I was in because I'm in a
[25:00] pastor's home you're in the in the Bible
[25:02] Belt I mean you're going to fall and hit
[25:04] a Bible in his house right and so I was
[25:06] going to get my phone out and say well
[25:09] here we go tell me what words to search
[25:11] for I want to know the scriptures in
[25:14] this hour that need to be fulfilled I
[25:17] want to understand and come to find out
[25:19] the the the brother was leaving the
[25:20] message uh because he lack spiritual
[25:22] Revelation but there are scriptures
[25:24] pertaining to this day and this hour
[25:27] that we must know by the teaching of the
[25:31] Holy Spirit Luke 17:30 even thus shall
[25:34] it be in the day when the son of man is
[25:38] revealed the revelation of the son of
[25:40] man is one of the most critical uh
[25:43] truths in this hour that we're living in
[25:45] right now and you're not going to be
[25:46] able to study that out and figure it out
[25:48] you're not going to be able to humanly
[25:50] get into that you're not going to
[25:51] exercise your way into that you're going
[25:52] to have to have the Holy Spirit revealed
[25:54] to you the son of man in this
[25:56] hour right one of the most critical
[25:58] scriptures of the message Revelations
[26:00] chap 10 as the Lord himself descending
[26:03] with that book open but in the days of
[26:05] the voice of the seventh angel verse 7
[26:07] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[26:09] of God should be finished as Heath
[26:11] declared to his servants the prophets
[26:13] we're living in the day when a mystery
[26:15] of God's going to be completed a mystery
[26:17] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[26:18] never becomes clear if the son of man's
[26:20] going to be revealed it's going to take
[26:22] the spirit of God to reveal the son of
[26:23] man oh we're never going to know him now
[26:26] you can say what somebody else is saying
[26:28] you can repeat what the prophet said you
[26:30] might even try to go beyond that and
[26:31] rephrase what he said but unless the
[26:33] holy spirit is revealing it to you
[26:35] you're only going to lean out further
[26:37] lean out further and get further away
[26:38] from what he was saying and if you're
[26:40] just repeating what somebody else said
[26:41] you don't actually know by the spirit
[26:44] the son of man in this
[26:53] hour so when he said he speaks the
[26:55] wisdom of God in a mystery it's going to
[26:58] take that takes a revelation to do that
[27:00] and takes a revelation to know that now
[27:03] in Matthew chapter 16 Christ asked the
[27:05] question who do you who do men say that
[27:07] I am there's a lot of speculation well
[27:09] some say you're this some say you're
[27:10] that truly those answers could have come
[27:12] just by study discipline uh kind of
[27:14] running the metrics well you look like
[27:16] this prophet and there's a prophecy of
[27:18] this and you some say you're this some
[27:19] say you're that who do you say that I am
[27:21] said Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[27:23] Living God in verse 177 Jesus answered
[27:26] and said unto Peter he said blessed art
[27:28] thou Simon bar
[27:29] Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not
[27:32] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[27:35] which is in
[27:36] heaven has revealed to him that this was
[27:39] the
[27:40] Messiah flesh and blood cannot do that
[27:44] and I say unto thee thou that thou art
[27:46] Peter so now Simon is now given a name
[27:50] change I'm going to call you Peter which
[27:52] is Stone Upon This Rock and this is
[27:54] where the Catholic Church gets it wrong
[27:57] they think they're talking about Peter
[27:58] being the rock but it's Revelation
[28:00] that's the
[28:01] rock Upon This Rock I will build my
[28:04] church upon the rock of Revelation you
[28:08] there if there's no Foundation of
[28:10] Revelation then then there's no
[28:12] elevation you've got to have the rock of
[28:14] Revelation otherwise God's not going to
[28:16] build on it if you're if something's
[28:19] being built on a foundation other than
[28:21] Revelation then it's not Christ that's
[28:23] building cuz he's not going to build on
[28:25] anything else except the Rock of
[28:28] Revelation I will build my Church on the
[28:30] Rock of Revelation and the Gates of Hell
[28:33] shall not Prevail against it with true
[28:37] Revelation in our lives the Gates of
[28:39] Hell cannot Prevail over us but we will
[28:41] prevail over them with what Revelation
[28:44] in our lives and I will give unto thee
[28:47] the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and
[28:48] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on the Earth
[28:49] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[28:51] Thou shalt loose on the Earth shall be
[28:52] loosed in heaven remember how we pointed
[28:55] out earlier in this series all hell is
[28:56] against this Revelation because what
[28:58] we're seeing here is the knowledge to
[29:00] open the power of the Kingdom takes
[29:03] Revelation to do it brother Bradman who
[29:06] is this mesic says the whole Bible is
[29:08] the revelation of
[29:11] God the whole church is built upon the
[29:14] revelation of God there's no other way
[29:17] to know God Only by
[29:22] Revelation and It quotes the scripture
[29:24] to whom the son will reveal him you
[29:25] can't know God unless he's revealed to
[29:27] you amen good he says
[29:30] Revelation everything is
[29:32] revelation I don't think it'd be wrong
[29:34] to say Revelation is
[29:37] everything everything is revelation the
[29:40] whole church is built upon the
[29:41] revelation of God so not to accept the
[29:45] Revelation then you're just a cold
[29:48] Theologian and there's no hope for you
[29:51] hey you want to know what it takes to be
[29:52] a cold Theologian just deny the power of
[29:56] Revelation right
[29:58] that that's it because I think sometimes
[30:00] we think a cold Theologian is somebody
[30:01] who's just very dry and who just stands
[30:04] up behind the pulpit and just very
[30:07] dry you know read scriptures and read
[30:10] quotes and we say well that's just a
[30:11] cold Theologian no all you got to do is
[30:13] deny
[30:14] Revelation I don't care how hot you are
[30:17] how passionate you are about what you're
[30:19] preaching if you cannot accept the
[30:21] Revelation then you're just a cold
[30:25] Theologian now we're making wonderful
[30:28] time this morning we might we might get
[30:29] to the youth meeting sooner than
[30:31] later now I want to just kind of
[30:34] summarize some Concepts that are very
[30:37] familiar to us in the message we know
[30:38] that faith is a revelation of God's will
[30:42] a and so there's a symmetry even if
[30:44] we're not they're not synonymous that
[30:46] faith is a revelation so if you say
[30:48] faith it's Revelation you say Revelation
[30:50] it translates to Faith so there's there
[30:52] there's some components where they work
[30:54] together and when we talk about faith
[30:56] we're talking about a Revelation when we
[30:58] talking about Revelation you're talking
[30:59] about faith so there's something that
[31:00] joins that together a a and perhaps if
[31:03] you were to divide that what you might
[31:05] get is intellectual understanding or you
[31:07] might get intellectual Faith but when
[31:09] they both work together that's real
[31:11] faith and so we understand according to
[31:13] the teach of the message that re faith
[31:15] is a revelation of God's will now we
[31:17] also understand through volumes of
[31:20] statements in the message of the hour
[31:21] that God's will is his word amen so
[31:25] Faith's final resting place is on on the
[31:27] word of God faith comes by hearing
[31:29] hearing by the word of God faith is a
[31:31] revelation of God's will so it kind of
[31:32] creates this this big picture of how the
[31:35] word of God is what brings the Faith by
[31:38] Revelation that the word being revealed
[31:41] to us gives us faith that if the word
[31:43] has not been revealed to us then we
[31:45] really don't have faith that's right
[31:46] amen if if I if I told you something
[31:49] that the Bible said and you accept it
[31:51] upon the basis that it's in the Bible
[31:54] now that can be a faith but when it's
[31:56] revealed to you that makes it the that
[31:59] makes it the faith so some substance
[32:02] faith and you can say and brother B I
[32:04] know he goes through levels of Faith
[32:05] Revelation Vision a a and that's maybe a
[32:08] whole separate area but I want you just
[32:10] to kind of see how it works in your
[32:11] daily life that when you read something
[32:13] in the word of God and it's revealed to
[32:15] you what do you say I
[32:17] know right I
[32:19] know by Revelation and that's faith and
[32:22] so what it hasn't happened it's just as
[32:24] good as it hasn't happened because it's
[32:26] been revealed to me because that's how
[32:29] this process works when God reveals to
[32:30] you something that's the real power
[32:32] there's a lot of things you can do right
[32:34] now by discipline by education our young
[32:36] people may be honoring their father and
[32:38] mother in the home by not doing this and
[32:40] not doing that and it's through
[32:41] discipline and training and education
[32:43] and instruction and say well I promise
[32:45] mommy I'm not going to cut my hair I
[32:47] promise Daddy I'm not going to go smoke
[32:49] a a dope I promise I'm not going to do
[32:51] that cuz it's not right it's not good
[32:53] let me say this as long as it's under
[32:55] instruction and it's under discipline or
[32:57] it's under that legalism there's no
[32:59] power in you to say no but as soon as
[33:02] you get the Revelation youve got the
[33:05] power inside of you to deny all the
[33:07] temptation of the world because there's
[33:09] nothing of such prevailing power as
[33:14] Revelation and that's what we need more
[33:16] than anything is
[33:18] revelation that's right now think then
[33:22] in terms of the very Ministry of Malachi
[33:25] 45 who to turn the hearts of the
[33:28] children to the the faith of their
[33:29] fathers and that's a a lot of language
[33:31] that brother bam uses and it's a
[33:33] restoration of the
[33:35] faith and a restoration of the faith
[33:38] will take a revelation of Jesus Christ
[33:40] for this
[33:41] age
[33:43] right and brother brandham says in the
[33:45] church age book and in this age the Leo
[33:47] Dean the revelation of God will come in
[33:49] its due time it will not falter neither
[33:53] will it be
[33:54] premature so he says think on this and
[33:57] heed it well we would say today
[34:01] Ponder think on this and heed it well
[34:03] for we are in the end time
[34:07] today the the the the revelation of God
[34:10] will come in its Due Time Won't falter
[34:13] won't fail won't be premature it's going
[34:16] to come here's brother Brandon writing
[34:19] this in the church age book The
[34:20] revelation of God will come there will
[34:23] be a revelation of God to stir the bride
[34:26] there will be a manifestation of the
[34:28] spirit to catch the elect's attention
[34:30] and it's a revelation of God that's
[34:32] going to come and he says this is
[34:34] something we ought to think on we ought
[34:37] to consider this because it will
[34:39] come the son of man will come and reveal
[34:43] himself the ministry of God will be
[34:45] finished am and it takes a revelation to
[34:48] see these
[34:49] things it's important to note in Luke
[34:51] chapter 18 as Jesus gives the parable of
[34:54] the unjust judge and the Widow who
[34:55] constantly wearies him and finally the
[34:57] unjust judge is like you know what aveng
[34:59] her you know cuz she's driving me
[35:02] crazy and and Jesus says hear what the
[35:05] unjust judge
[35:06] saith and shall not God avenge his own
[35:10] elect which cry day and night unto him
[35:13] though he bear along with them I will I
[35:16] tell you that he will avenge them
[35:18] speedily this is
[35:20] Vindication this is
[35:22] identification that the elect who are
[35:24] crying out to God for the revelation of
[35:26] God to those who are looking for him to
[35:28] those who desire him in this season here
[35:31] as he's referring to he says I will
[35:33] avenge them speedily so there's going to
[35:35] be a Vindication that comes there will
[35:37] be a manifestation there's going to be a
[35:39] Deliverance but notice what he says at
[35:42] this time of vindication and deliverance
[35:44] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[35:47] so he's bringing this back to the coming
[35:49] of the son of man which is the revealing
[35:50] of the son of man and notice what is
[35:53] going to be an issue shall he find faith
[35:56] on the Earth
[35:57] Earth so when the son of man is being
[36:00] revealed what's the most important thing
[36:02] what is it he's looking for is he
[36:04] looking for outward demonstrations is he
[36:06] looking for a fleshly evidence is he
[36:08] looking for some Pentecostal version of
[36:09] it or is he looking for Faith I know the
[36:12] Bible says that i' actually had been
[36:14] preparing a sermon to minister on it and
[36:16] not maybe I'll just get it out of the
[36:17] way right here the Bible says fear not
[36:20] believe only and I want to say don't
[36:23] fear believing
[36:24] only that there can be such a nasty
[36:27] stigmatism placed on believing in only
[36:30] believing and sure there's been some
[36:32] scarecrows of easy believism but let me
[36:35] say easy believism whatever that ism is
[36:38] has never done away with only belief and
[36:41] Never Be Shaken off the foundation that
[36:43] I can believe the word of God and I can
[36:46] stand upon his eternal promise and
[36:47] that's all he's asked me to do and the
[36:50] rest is up to
[36:52] him that's good because what he's
[36:55] looking for is faith
[36:57] not looking for anything
[36:59] else not looking for someone say me look
[37:02] at me look at
[37:05] me no you don't even have to be moving
[37:07] and he'll see the
[37:09] faith that's what he's looking for his
[37:12] faith he's looking for
[37:16] Revelation now if you've been waiting
[37:18] for me to get to my title of Kingdom
[37:20] Builders here we
[37:21] are I had to go back and just bring some
[37:24] of these things about so he could really
[37:26] begin to think about just how important
[37:27] Revelation
[37:29] is and through some of these very direct
[37:32] things I trust the holy spirit is
[37:34] speaking to you Jesus said Upon This
[37:37] Rock I will build my
[37:40] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[37:43] Prevail against it brother B has drawn a
[37:46] lot from this in the church age book how
[37:47] but we will prevail over them when we
[37:50] can discern and withstand by spiritual
[37:52] Revelation the two Spirits within the
[37:53] framework of the Christian church you
[37:54] can be an invincible Army by spiritual
[37:56] discernment
[37:58] amen when he says Upon This Rock what
[38:01] ises he talking about Revelation the
[38:03] church is built upon
[38:06] Revelation and he takes in that
[38:09] statement he says Thou Art
[38:11] Peter which is
[38:14] Stone and Upon This Rock I will build my
[38:18] church now think of how interesting this
[38:21] is if you could just kind of get this
[38:22] picture in your
[38:24] mind he's referring to
[38:27] ration but then he calls Peter a
[38:30] stone and says Upon This Rock I'll build
[38:33] my
[38:34] church now he has a foundation and you
[38:37] have a builder but he's now brought
[38:39] Peter into view as a stone so now he's
[38:42] got his
[38:44] materialen so now think of this brother
[38:47] says in the sermon Christ is the mystery
[38:49] of God revealed it's an individual one
[38:52] person all hell is against this teaching
[38:56] amen
[38:57] all hell is against this
[38:59] truth but it is the truth Jesus never
[39:02] said now Peter you and John and all the
[39:04] rest of the people you've got the
[39:06] Revelation now the whole church is saved
[39:09] listen it's not going to be a group
[39:11] Movement we cannot make the mistake that
[39:14] denominations have made throughout
[39:16] Generations is trying to find comfort in
[39:18] a group movement or a group umbrella to
[39:21] feel oh well because these this is
[39:24] what's happening in a group context then
[39:26] I'm in the I'm in the Revival no you are
[39:30] the
[39:31] Revival let it be a Revival in me is
[39:34] what brother bradam said we've got to
[39:36] recognize this solemnly and convincingly
[39:39] deep down within our souls that I am an
[39:41] individual that has been born into the
[39:43] kingdom of God and thank God that
[39:45] there's other individuals around us we
[39:47] can fellowship with and worship with and
[39:49] there's men of God preaching this great
[39:51] truth around the world but I'm standing
[39:53] on my T toes I'm standing on a Firm
[39:57] Foundation as an
[40:00] individual so Jesus never said Peter you
[40:02] John and all the rest of the people
[40:03] you've got the Revelation now the whole
[40:05] church is say no it was to him
[40:09] personally I say to thee thee not them
[40:13] to thee Thou Art Peter Upon This Rock
[40:15] I'll build my
[40:17] church and the word Peter means a
[40:20] stone stone means the confessed one
[40:22] notice the separate one Upon A Certain
[40:26] Stone Upon A Certain thing a called out
[40:29] the church called out upon this Stone
[40:32] upon this
[40:33] Revelation so there he brings that see
[40:36] how now he's connecting it upon this
[40:39] Stone Upon This Rock I'll build my
[40:40] church that's a stone that's a rock
[40:43] that's a foundation and now he's
[40:45] bringing Peter into
[40:46] it by saying upon this Stone upon this
[40:49] Revelation Flesh and Blood never
[40:50] revealed it to you but upon this
[40:51] Revelation called out group I will build
[40:54] my church in them amen hu and all the
[40:59] gates of hell will never be able to
[41:00] stand withstand it amen Revelation is
[41:03] the foundation amen Revelation is the
[41:08] rock but now not only is it the
[41:10] foundation it's the means and material
[41:13] yes sir by which God will build his
[41:14] church amen God does not establish us
[41:18] upon the foundation of Christ and the
[41:19] revelation of Jesus Christ and then
[41:21] build upon it wood hay and stubble right
[41:24] God doesn't take the Divine the deity
[41:26] the revelation of Jesus Christ and he
[41:28] builds the foundation of Jesus Christ
[41:29] and then he's going to build upon that
[41:31] Humanity in
[41:33] [Music]
[41:47] carnalismo it's going to be Stone upon
[41:50] Stone upon stone brick upon brick upon
[41:53] brick the foundation of the revelation
[41:55] of Jesus Christ and then the building up
[41:57] of Jesus Christ by Revelation upon that
[42:02] Foundation it's that stone upon the
[42:05] rock Revelation is not only the
[42:07] foundation but it's the means and the
[42:09] building material of the Bride amen he
[42:12] said I want to get you built up in the
[42:14] Holy Oracles of God in the faith the
[42:16] faith of this hour why was he preaching
[42:18] the revelation of this hour because
[42:19] that's the building
[42:21] material Revelation is the building
[42:23] material of God's Church it's the
[42:26] building material of our individual
[42:28] spiritual house in 1 Peter 2:5 ye also
[42:31] as Lively Stones living stones are built
[42:35] up a spiritual
[42:39] house a holy
[42:41] priesthood you are stones in God's
[42:45] Building you are a spiritual
[42:50] house knowledge is
[42:53] power Revelation is power
[42:58] to build us
[43:00] up into powerhouses of
[43:03] God I'm not I I I know that there may be
[43:06] some
[43:07] things uh there may be ways that
[43:10] Revelation is preached and teaching is
[43:12] preach to where it tries to rob the
[43:14] people of of of a of overcoming life to
[43:19] explain way this and it's okay if you do
[43:20] that it's okay if you do that we got the
[43:21] word we got the word that's okay it's no
[43:24] I'm wanting I'm wanting the real power
[43:26] God to be loose in your life without
[43:28] restraint and however God wants to move
[43:30] in your life to manifest himself I
[43:32] encourage it
[43:34] amen because we we trust the Holy Spirit
[43:36] right if something starts happening it's
[43:37] not according to the word you you're
[43:39] just going to find yourself correct and
[43:40] you're going to
[43:41] moderate and so when these things are
[43:43] preached maybe sometimes they're
[43:44] preached in such a way to where it
[43:45] Waters down the life and Holiness and
[43:47] overcoming power maybe it Waters down
[43:49] the manifestation of God in a church
[43:51] service or the or or Miracles and signs
[43:54] and wonders no there there's there's no
[43:56] there's no doing away with that why
[43:58] because that's in the
[44:00] word listen understand this when we say
[44:04] word only then if it's in the word we
[44:07] believe it amen when people say it's not
[44:10] the word only they want to chop up the
[44:12] word and make it their own
[44:14] idea and so it's not the word only it's
[44:17] actually only this word on and they
[44:19] break it
[44:20] up so there's this is I'm wanting to
[44:23] encourage a real a real work of God in
[44:27] our lives but it's got to be in the
[44:29] right place got to be the right
[44:32] foundation we're talking about being
[44:34] Kingdom
[44:35] Builders we're addressing Kingdom
[44:40] Builders and Proverbs chapter 9 verse1 I
[44:43] hope this can kind of all come together
[44:45] as we've tried to build talk about what
[44:47] Revelation is now just for the last
[44:48] several minutes we've been looking at
[44:49] the context of Revelation
[44:52] being Building Material right amen it's
[44:56] the foundation it's the stones upon
[44:58] which the F it's the and the stones that
[45:01] rest upon that
[45:02] Foundation Proverbs chapter 9
[45:08] verse1 I was doing really good at time
[45:10] until you got
[45:12] involved and now I'm running out of time
[45:15] Proverbs chapter 9 vers1 wisdom hath
[45:17] build her
[45:18] house sheath heun out her Seven
[45:22] Pillars now if we can look at God says
[45:26] wisdom hath builded her house what a
[45:28] statement what a substance but God by
[45:30] his wisdom framed the
[45:32] worlds and as God built the habitation
[45:35] for all creation by his wisdom and here
[45:38] it's saying wisdom builds her house she
[45:41] hews out Seven
[45:42] Pillars now what is this wisdom this
[45:45] wisdom is the power of
[45:47] God Jeremiah 10:12 he hath made the
[45:50] Earth by his power he hath established
[45:53] the World by his wisdom and hath
[45:55] stretched out the heavens by his
[45:57] discretion God's power is connected with
[46:00] his wisdom it was manifested in his
[46:02] creating his establishing his ordering
[46:05] by his power he made the heavens and
[46:07] earth and what was that by his word by
[46:10] faith in his own word is what brother
[46:12] brandham says that's the power of God is
[46:15] faith in the word of God and he
[46:17] establishes it he makes it firm and he
[46:19] secures it by his wisdom and is the
[46:22] extent of it is by his discernment by
[46:24] his discretion by his
[46:27] understanding that's the power of God
[46:29] and it says in 1 Corinthians 1:24 but to
[46:31] them which are called both Jews and
[46:33] Greeks Christ the power of God and the
[46:37] wisdom of
[46:39] God now this is we just point you to
[46:41] Something in the message of the hour the
[46:43] word which is Christ is God's
[46:46] intelligence wisdom hath builded her
[46:48] house this is his mysterious
[46:51] wisdom and it build it's a builder just
[46:54] as God made the Earth by his power and
[46:56] established the World by his wisdom and
[46:58] stretched out the heavens by his
[46:59] discretion Christ the power of God and
[47:01] the wisdom of God builds it establishes
[47:05] it secures it orders God is a god of
[47:09] order not a god of chaos
[47:12] amen God's a god of
[47:15] stability he's he's a god of
[47:20] purpose it says that wisdom hath builded
[47:24] her house
[47:26] wisdom is the kingdom Builder true
[47:29] wisdom builds the kingdom of God in your
[47:31] life heun out Seven Pillars the use of
[47:34] seven there speaks of completeness and
[47:36] sufficiency
[47:38] Perfection uh the reference to Seven
[47:40] Pillars it's that that act of guiding
[47:44] and supporting raising a structure up
[47:46] when you have pillars it's lifting
[47:47] something
[47:49] up and there's different maybe
[47:52] interpretations of what these pillars
[47:54] are you can find even a parallel to the
[47:56] fruit of the
[47:57] spirit but just taking even from the
[48:00] Proverbs and how wisdom manifests itself
[48:02] these pillars of wisdom and
[48:03] understanding and counsel and strength
[48:06] and knowledge reverence fear of God
[48:09] these are the pillars that hold up the
[48:11] house
[48:12] am this is what makes something that's
[48:14] built upon a rock remain
[48:17] secure and it says that it hath Hune out
[48:21] her Seven Pillars which means to divide
[48:24] to cut out it's used as a Mason cut into
[48:28] a stone perfectly to fit its place in a
[48:31] building and it's amazing how that
[48:34] someone is even sharing with me recently
[48:35] about how even in think it was brother
[48:37] Matthew Watkins even in the wall the
[48:39] building of the temple wall that Still
[48:40] Remains they still they can't figure out
[48:42] how they did it right there's ways that
[48:45] they cut the way they shaped the way
[48:46] that they move these things and place
[48:48] these things well we're not even quite
[48:49] sure how they even managed to do this in
[48:50] that day and age we're we're not even
[48:52] sure we could do it exactly the same way
[48:53] in our day and age why cuz they had a
[48:56] way of hewing things out cutting things
[48:59] structuring things so it could be placed
[49:00] properly so that it could endure it's
[49:03] not just cobbling stones on top of
[49:05] stones all right any one of you think
[49:07] it's just easy to build a stone wall go
[49:09] ahead and try it
[49:11] sometime and you go by and you see walls
[49:13] that have been built somewhere by
[49:14] somebody who knows how to build a wall
[49:15] using just whatever Stones they find a
[49:18] and it's still there today hundreds of
[49:20] years later because somebody knew how to
[49:22] take the shapes they knew how to set
[49:24] them together
[49:26] and they don't even necessarily need
[49:27] anything to glue them together they just
[49:29] know how to stack them you ever seen a
[49:31] real Mason work with a brick it's a
[49:32] beautiful thing they'll just pick
[49:33] something I go and they know just
[49:36] exactly how to place it all together and
[49:38] they do this with stones they do it to
[49:40] place something where it belongs it's
[49:42] just not a matter of gathering Stones
[49:44] it's just not a sake of trying to
[49:46] collect information you've got to have
[49:48] it heun out you've got to have wisdom to
[49:51] build the house the foundation's been
[49:53] laid now we need wisdom to to build the
[49:56] house and to heue out the Seven Pillars
[49:59] to cause this bride to rise up in her
[50:01] real power and Glory brother brand in
[50:03] the sermon the end time evangelism says
[50:05] what good are Stones if you haven't got
[50:07] a stonemason to shape them out these are
[50:09] some Ponder points right here and
[50:11] confessions is Stones when Peter made
[50:14] his confession Jesus said Thou Art Peter
[50:15] a little Stone but what good is a stone
[50:18] if there isn't a stone Mason there to
[50:19] shape him into a Son of God you're just
[50:22] piling up a bunch of rocks is that right
[50:24] isn't doing a bit of good the water
[50:26] wearth away the stone see that's right
[50:28] that's the people what good are Stones
[50:30] if you haven't got a true stonemason
[50:32] with a good sharp tool to shape them
[50:34] into the Fitting Place in the house of
[50:37] God this is what we need more than ever
[50:40] is the king sword the sword of the word
[50:42] of God shaping Our Lives to cause us to
[50:45] fit into the house of God just want to
[50:47] ask you what goods the decision what
[50:49] good you putting your name on the book
[50:50] what good is it to come and join the
[50:52] church if the stonemason isn't there
[50:54] that'll shape that make them quit this
[50:57] and that and cut them and make them over
[50:59] this way and square them up and make
[51:01] them like Christians that set in the
[51:03] house of God with signs following the
[51:06] Believers Hallelujah let's get the faith
[51:08] first cuz the faith will follow the
[51:10] signs will follow them that believe
[51:12] those that are being shaped will have a
[51:14] life following
[51:16] them that's the end time evangelism
[51:18] taking the stones and shaping them what
[51:22] good would the stones be if you just
[51:23] pile them up let them lay where they're
[51:26] at might do a little better out there
[51:27] than they would piling them up
[51:29] together wait
[51:32] what what good is it just piling them
[51:34] into a room if you can't shape them he's
[51:37] actually he's actually kind of you know
[51:39] maybe just some conjecture here he's
[51:41] kind of saying you know they might just
[51:42] be better out
[51:44] there they might be better out in the
[51:46] world and just try to gather them into
[51:49] lodges true and pile them up good very
[51:52] good if there's not a stonemason
[51:56] if there's not a holy spirit teaching
[51:58] sir shaping guiding if it's if wisdom
[52:02] isn't hewing out Seven
[52:04] Pillars if the word is not being
[52:07] preached in love to raise us up into the
[52:09] stature of a perfect
[52:11] man amen might do a little bit out there
[52:13] than they would piling them up together
[52:15] they might be needed out there and none
[52:18] of them out there see that's right stone
[52:21] is no good without a stone Mason and
[52:23] then this now you can see what he's
[52:24] talking about Jesus counts character not
[52:26] members
[52:27] amen cuz he's talking about the forming
[52:30] forming of
[52:31] character you know that he counts
[52:34] characters not
[52:36] members I think the statement is said
[52:38] quite often it's kind of maybe cliche
[52:39] that God doesn't count as people he
[52:41] weighs them in the sense that he's
[52:42] looking at the character of the people
[52:45] the beauty of the church is the
[52:46] character of the people you don't count
[52:48] the empty seats to try to figure out
[52:49] whether or not you've had a good church
[52:51] service you think about what the word
[52:52] did in your
[52:53] heart what is it it done to press itself
[52:56] on my character what is it doing to
[52:58] shape
[52:59] me CU wisdom builds the
[53:02] house in Proverbs 24:
[53:05] 3-6 through wisdom I want to come back
[53:07] to these scriptures as we want to soon
[53:09] be getting into maybe a series on the
[53:11] house of God through wisdom is a house
[53:13] builded and by understanding it is
[53:16] established and by knowledge shall the
[53:18] chambers be filled with all precious and
[53:20] pleasant riches a wise man is strong yay
[53:24] a man of knowledge and increaseth
[53:25] strength we read where the translation
[53:27] is in knowledge is
[53:29] power for by wise counsel Thou shalt
[53:32] make thy war and in a multitude of
[53:33] counselors there is safety amen this is
[53:36] pointing us back to the power of
[53:39] Revelation as Paul said that God would
[53:41] Grant to you the spirit of wisdom and
[53:43] Revelation in the knowledge of
[53:46] him Spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[53:50] the knowledge of him not the spirit of
[53:53] wisdom not the Excellence of speech not
[53:56] enticing words but that the revelation
[53:59] of Jesus Christ could be preached to you
[54:02] and that you would hear and turn and see
[54:06] amen and that the light of the knowledge
[54:07] of the glory of the Lord could fill you
[54:09] up as he makes himself known to you and
[54:13] that's the building of the spiritual
[54:15] house takes Revelation to build you up
[54:17] as a
[54:18] Christian through wisdom is a house
[54:20] built by understanding it is established
[54:23] and by knowledge it's filled
[54:28] now I'm I'm going to end on a statement
[54:30] from ever present water from the rock
[54:31] we'll invite the musicians to
[54:33] come and I'm going to end with this
[54:39] statement and I want
[54:41] you to let it you let you just grab a
[54:44] hold of this and you let the Holy Spirit
[54:47] lead you into the applications of this
[54:49] because this is coming to a spot where I
[54:51] think I maybe got I want to at least
[54:52] preach one more uh service on the
[54:54] Builder Kingdom Builders at least one
[54:56] more I think and bring it right down to
[54:58] some relevant things there was a lot of
[55:01] wonderful Fellowship yesterday morning
[55:03] at the brother's breakfast the father
[55:05] Sons got together for breakfast just
[55:07] fantastic fellowship and some of these
[55:09] things were coming up and Lord it's just
[55:10] beautiful see this coming to a place
[55:12] where it's
[55:14] practical and the sermon now everpresent
[55:17] water from the rock I hope that you can
[55:19] kind of let everything that we've been
[55:20] preaching about this morning kind of
[55:21] zero in and narrow in and I hope this
[55:24] can be just a Clincher he says we are
[55:27] now in Heavenly places I believe that we
[55:28] were uh used this quote when we
[55:31] ministered on augmented reality on faith
[55:33] in a series on Divine Healing we are now
[55:35] in Heavenly places we are now in the
[55:38] power of the
[55:41] Resurrection now let's concentrate for
[55:44] just a few more
[55:45] moments if there wasn't a law to
[55:48] that Sons and Daughters of God would
[55:51] create them a world out here and go live
[55:54] a private life on
[55:56] it that's the power inside of a
[55:59] believer that power is with you now am
[56:03] in one place says you don't need more
[56:04] power you need more knowledge how to use
[56:06] the power well that comes to the
[56:09] law sometimes we think the law means
[56:12] that and and is certainly applicable
[56:14] that the law just says you can't do it
[56:16] but the law says how you're supposed to
[56:18] do
[56:18] it the law do say I'm sorry can't create
[56:21] a world the law says the law says oh if
[56:22] you're going to create a world this is
[56:24] the wisdom and knowledge and Revelation
[56:25] how to do it and so you can't do it
[56:28] unless you have the knowledge of
[56:31] how so he says we could create a world
[56:34] and go live on
[56:36] it you have the power in you to do
[56:40] it if you've got a shadow of the power
[56:42] of God in you you got power to do it oh
[56:46] let it shake away all the cobwebs of
[56:49] Doubt take anything that binds us today
[56:52] and causes us to fear and tremble and
[56:55] shake it away from us if you've got the
[56:57] shadow of the power of God and you've
[57:00] got power to create a world and go live
[57:01] in it God is omnipotent see what I mean
[57:04] the power of God that's in you will make

[57:18] world in existence and go live on it

[57:27] law and that law is not keeping a bunch
[57:30] of Commandments it's a law of faith I I
[57:33] know I know you may think this serves my
[57:35] purpose it's a law of
[57:37] Revelation it's a law of
[57:40] character Jesus said all things are
[57:42] possible to them that believe and if you
[57:44] can believe it whatsoever God will lead

[57:51] place The Souls of your foot can set
[57:53] upon by faith God giv it to you amen

[58:00] opens it to you what is it
[58:04] Revelation Hallelujah you see what I
[58:07] mean the power is
[58:09] controlled if you are a son of God if

[58:38] still there the power is still there I

[58:47] have inside of me a
[58:50] power that Revelation can use amen and
