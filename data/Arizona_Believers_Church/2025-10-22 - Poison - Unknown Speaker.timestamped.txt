[0:00] I have a a one-word title this evening.
[0:02] My title is poison. And there is a lot
[0:05] to use in this particular subject on
[0:08] poison. We'll come to it here just in a
[0:10] little bit uh maybe to background some
[0:12] of what we mean on that. But we have in
[0:15] the last two services ministered on
[0:17] praying on ignorance and then also on
[0:20] defformation of character,
[0:22] deformationation of character. And in
[0:24] doing that, we addressed vulnerabilities
[0:26] that the devil exploits. That not
[0:28] reading your Bible, not praying are
[0:30] things that he will definitely exploit.
[0:32] And prayer in scripture being the
[0:35] positive application that we should pray
[0:37] and read our Bibles, the failure to do
[0:39] so are the things that will expose a
[0:41] lack of faith in Christ. So if you don't
[0:44] have faith in Christ, if you're not
[0:46] reading and feeding and praying in those
[0:47] things, it'll expose that, but then it
[0:49] also will weaken the faith that we do
[0:51] have in Christ. And I was thinking a lot
[0:53] this week on the scriptures of Lord I
[0:55] believe. Help thou my unbelief until
[0:57] that your faith be increased. And
[0:59] there's a growing that takes place with
[1:01] respect to our faith. And so our
[1:03] character even the strength of our faith
[1:05] depends upon prayer and reading the
[1:08] scripture. Sunday we spoke on how the
[1:10] ignorance of scripture allows the Bible
[1:12] to be misinterpreted, misplaced and
[1:14] misused. And if the word which is the
[1:17] character of God is deformed or twisted,
[1:20] then it's going to deform our character
[1:21] because the word has power to thorly
[1:24] furnish a a man unto perfection. And we
[1:27] use the opposite of prayer is ignoring.
[1:30] That's the way that I would uh like to
[1:32] place it. That if prayer is speaking or
[1:34] communicating with God, then failing to
[1:36] do so is ignoring God. And ignoring God
[1:39] allows his character to be twisted,
[1:41] allows it to be distorted. It allows him
[1:43] to become distant to us. And maybe
[1:45] you've had this happen where if you
[1:47] haven't talked to somebody in a long
[1:48] time, someone can come around and say,
[1:49] "I don't know if you've heard about
[1:51] what's going on with so- and so, but
[1:52] yeah, I'm just not so sure." And the
[1:54] fact that there's distance, allows their
[1:56] testimony to be manipulated, allows a
[1:59] seed to be sewn in your mind because
[2:00] you're not in fellowship with them. But
[2:02] if you were, you could say, "Oh, no, no,
[2:03] that's not true. I talked to them
[2:05] yesterday. They mention to me what
[2:06] they're doing and what they're going
[2:07] through right now or where they've been.
[2:09] Uh, no, that's been greatly exaggerated.
[2:11] Or the the news of my death has been
[2:13] greatly exaggerated as one one uh said
[2:15] one time. And so there's a way that
[2:17] because you're in fellowship, that
[2:19] character cannot be maligned. It cannot
[2:21] be lied on. In the sermon question and
[2:24] answers, or I say sermon, but in the in
[2:27] what the message or the sermon we call
[2:28] question and answers, in question 350,
[2:31] brothers asked, "How can a Christian get
[2:33] deeper in the love of God?" And no doubt
[2:36] I remember when brother Jim Ed Dalton
[2:38] shared with me how they had asked uh
[2:40] brother Brandham how can we be more
[2:41] spiritual and so there was this kind of
[2:43] like this dramatic you know get the
[2:45] court stenographer here we might have
[2:46] had to have brother Wes you know here to
[2:49] be able to uh write it all down and do
[2:51] the and and write this really long
[2:53] answer that was going to happen and what
[2:54] what ends up happening it's very
[2:56] straightforward he said read the word
[2:58] and pray how can I get deeper in the
[3:01] love of God read the word of God and
[3:03] pray is what he said. So if we want to
[3:06] get deeper in the love of God, if we
[3:07] want to have greater love for our our
[3:09] children, for our brothers and sisters,
[3:11] if we want to soften our spirits, we
[3:12] want to grow in Christ, we must read the
[3:15] word of God and pray. And these last two
[3:18] sermons to me have been so important
[3:20] that I would I would encourage you to
[3:22] listen to them. If you consider this to
[3:24] be your home church, I would encourage
[3:25] you to listen to them and to digest them
[3:28] because I I feel this is something that
[3:30] we can't miss as families, as
[3:33] individuals, and as a church that we
[3:35] should be in the habit of praying and
[3:36] reading our Bibles. And we should be
[3:38] teaching our children the same because
[3:40] if we're not doing that, the devil will
[3:42] ultimately exploit it.
[3:44] &gt;&gt; And as I've said before, I don't want to
[3:46] assume anymore that these things have
[3:48] been taught. We're a young church. Uh
[3:50] most of us, if not all of us, have come
[3:52] from other churches and you see a
[3:54] certain image or a certain dedication
[3:55] and you just assume they're on the right
[3:57] track. Eventually, we're going to see
[3:59] the fruits of it. It's going to take
[4:00] hold. But if you don't have these
[4:02] fundamentals operating in your life,
[4:03] you're never going to get the fruit.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; What ends up happening is is a
[4:08] backsliding or something, God will allow
[4:10] some crisis to emerge so that you come
[4:13] to your senses or you come to that place
[4:15] of decision. So my again, my title
[4:18] tonight is poison. I'm continuing on
[4:19] this line of praying on ignorance and
[4:22] defformation of character. But tonight I
[4:23] want to use and is kind of looking at
[4:25] three different thoughts. And so this
[4:27] will kind of conclude this these this
[4:29] little these last few services. But it's
[4:32] I want to emphasize the importance of
[4:33] feeding on the word of God and how Satan
[4:36] tries to keep us from it. And I'm
[4:40] explicitly meaning and referring to the
[4:42] message of the hour when I say the word
[4:44] of God. Not just the Bible, but also the
[4:46] message of the hour. And so if you could
[4:48] turn to 2 Kings chapter 4. I'm going to
[4:50] start with verse 38. We're going to try
[4:52] to read through this text again in
[4:54] total, but then um supplementing through
[4:57] several other scriptures. And it says,
[4:58] "And Elisha came again to Gilgal, and
[5:00] there was a darth in the land, and the
[5:02] sons of the prophets were sitting before
[5:04] him." Darth there means famine. I know
[5:07] it's kind of a a fancy word it may seem,
[5:10] but Darth is a severe famine. So there
[5:12] was a lack of food. And this was a a
[5:15] drought that had been prophesied, a
[5:17] famine of seven years. And we know that
[5:19] this is the result of Israel's
[5:21] wickedness. And as a result of their
[5:23] wickedness, there was a shortage of
[5:24] rain. There's a shortage of grain.
[5:25] There's a shortage of bread. And so
[5:27] there's just kind of this domino effect
[5:29] where without rain, there's no proender
[5:31] to clean uh feed your flocks. There's no
[5:33] grain to make bread. And I want to bring
[5:36] a parallel of this famine that exists in
[5:39] 2 Kings chapter 4. And you could read
[5:41] about it earlier and even later in
[5:43] chapter 8 to the time that we're now
[5:45] living in where I believe and we've been
[5:47] taught that there's a famine for the
[5:49] word of God. In Amos 8 11 and 12 it says
[5:53] behold the days come sayeth the Lord God
[5:55] that I will send a famine in the land.
[5:58] It says and not a famine of bread nor a
[6:01] thirst for water. And what you had in 2
[6:03] Kings chapter 4 was a famine of bread
[6:06] and a thirst for water. We see even in
[6:08] those times of famine that happened with
[6:10] Elijah. Now with the ministry of Elisha,
[6:12] you see similar famines and this famine
[6:15] of rain and this famine of grain was a
[6:18] result of their disobedience. But God is
[6:20] saying, I'm not going to send a famine
[6:22] for bread and a thirst for water, but a
[6:24] famine of hearing the words of the Lord.
[6:29] And they that shall wonder, and they
[6:31] shall wander from sea to sea, and from
[6:33] the north even to the east, they shall
[6:35] run to and fro to seek the word of the
[6:37] Lord, and shall not find it.
[6:40] Catch this uh prophecy that it's going
[6:43] to be a shortage, not for bread or
[6:44] water, but it's going to be a lacking of
[6:47] hearing the word.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; Now, this is interesting. It's the
[6:50] opposite of what's happening in 2 Kings
[6:52] 4. Because in 2 Kings 4, you have Elisha
[6:54] there, and he's teaching the sons of the
[6:57] prophet. He's there giving the word of
[6:59] the Lord and they had a famine for bread
[7:01] and water. But God is saying, and I'm
[7:03] wanting to use this as a type, that
[7:05] there's going to be a time when you
[7:06] won't have that prophet there present
[7:09] teaching and being able to sit at his
[7:11] feet and hear what he has to say in the
[7:13] word of the Lord. And you'll have all
[7:15] sorts of bread and all sorts of water,
[7:16] but you won't hear the word of God.
[7:21] When we had ministered on this subject a
[7:23] few years ago, we were looking at
[7:25] hunger. One of the things that really
[7:26] stood out to me is there was no shortage
[7:29] for the things that minister to the
[7:30] flesh.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; There's bread to eat. There there's uh
[7:34] there's water to drink. And in the day
[7:37] that we're living in, there's no famine
[7:39] for emotion.
[7:41] The day we're living in, there's no
[7:42] famine for personality. Those things,
[7:44] there's plenty of things to feed that.
[7:46] There's plenty of things to feed the
[7:47] flesh. Even within the context of
[7:49] church, there's a lot of things that
[7:50] would be the bread and water that feed
[7:52] the spirit of a man. But the the
[7:54] shortage here is a lack of hearing the
[7:57] word. And just as one who wouldn't be
[7:59] able to eat bread, and we could say that
[8:01] of any kind of meat or substance that
[8:02] would sustain the flesh and drink water
[8:05] would impact your natural health, this
[8:06] failure to hear the word of God impacts
[8:08] spiritual health.
[8:10] And it weakens faith because in Romans
[8:13] chap 10:1 17, very obvious scripture to
[8:16] go to here. Faith cometh by hearing and
[8:18] hearing by the word of God. If there is
[8:21] no word of God, then there is no faith.
[8:23] You'd have a faith shortage. So the
[8:25] Bible says it's not a famine of bread
[8:27] nor a thirst of water. It is a famine of
[8:28] hearing the words of the Lord. That
[8:30] means without the word of the Lord,
[8:31] there cannot be that provocation of
[8:33] faith, the growth of faith, the
[8:34] stimulating of faith. And as a result,
[8:36] there is a faith shortage where there's
[8:38] a word shortage. I want to use this as a
[8:41] parallel that in 2 Kings chapter 4 where
[8:43] there was a darth or a famine of bread
[8:46] and water. That's a type I want to look
[8:48] at as a type of the time we're living in
[8:50] now where there's a famine for hearing
[8:51] the word of God and the impact that that
[8:53] has on our faith. So it says there was a
[8:56] darth in the land and this verse 38
[8:58] continues and he said unto his servant
[9:00] the prophet now speaks Elisha comes to
[9:03] Gilgal the sons of the prophet gather
[9:05] before him to sit at his feet and he
[9:06] said unto his servant singular set on
[9:09] the great pot and see pottage for the
[9:12] sons of the prophets. This is the boil
[9:14] pottage. There's different uh things
[9:17] that people say that might have been
[9:18] little bits of meat, maybe some
[9:20] vegetables, but he's going to be boiling
[9:21] a stew.
[9:23] And I believe that in this particular
[9:25] instance, and this will be me, I'll go
[9:27] ahead and just acknowledge this is me
[9:28] kind of setting this forth as the
[9:30] prophet providing this stew with
[9:32] supernatural means that there being a
[9:35] darth and a famine. No doubt he would
[9:37] have looked at the sons of the prophet
[9:38] and see that they're malnourished. They
[9:39] might not have had uh readily available
[9:41] resources. So he instructs his servant
[9:44] to boil this stew and he's doing it by
[9:46] the power of God. And he's making
[9:48] provision for the sons of prophet in a
[9:50] time of a great famine. In Psalms 132
[9:53] verse uh 15 God says I will abundantly
[9:56] bless her provision. I will satisfy her
[9:59] poor with bread. God has promised that
[10:02] his seed will not beg that they will not
[10:04] be forsaken. That he's given this
[10:06] promise that he will provide them uh
[10:09] things to eat and things to drink.
[10:12] As I mentioned here recently, I've been
[10:13] studying again in the book of Ruth and
[10:15] just some things personally or maybe
[10:17] some future services and how that the
[10:20] famine that existed in Israel at the
[10:22] time of the of of Ruth was a result of
[10:26] disobedience because God said, "If you
[10:28] obey me, I'll give you rain. I'll give
[10:29] you grain. I'll give you all the crops.
[10:30] You'll be blessed." And so when you
[10:32] disobey and you don't have uh substance
[10:35] and you don't have crops that the answer
[10:37] is to repent because God said I'll bless
[10:40] you in that land. But just as it says in
[10:42] Amos 8, they're going to go east to west
[10:44] wander to and fro trying to find the
[10:46] word of the God. And they're not going
[10:47] to find it because he can only be found
[10:49] in repentance and found and saying,
[10:52] "Lord, I I I I want to go where your
[10:54] promise is and seek you and find you."
[10:58] And so God promised to bless her
[11:00] provision and satisfy her poor with
[11:02] bread. In 2 Kings 4:42, it's in the very
[11:05] same reading. This is just after our
[11:07] text. I want to use this to show that uh
[11:10] there was supernatural provision through
[11:12] this ministry of Elijah in the spirit of
[11:14] Elijah. And there came there came a man
[11:17] from Ba Shalisha and brought the man of
[11:19] God bread of the first fruits, 20 loaves
[11:22] of barley, and full ears of corn and the
[11:24] husk thereof. So there was some
[11:26] substance that's being brought to him,
[11:28] but it's not a lot because now the
[11:30] prophet says and he said, "Give unto the
[11:32] people that they may eat." So this was a
[11:34] little um some bread and 20 loaves of
[11:37] barley, full ears of corn and the husk
[11:39] and he's going to give this to the
[11:40] prophet to sustain him. And the prophet
[11:42] says, "Give it to the people." And the
[11:44] servtor said, "What should I set this
[11:47] before a hundred men?" And whether it
[11:50] was exactly a hundred, it is referring
[11:52] to the fact it's more than just Elijah.
[11:54] And he thought he had Elisha. He thought
[11:55] he had enough for Elisha. But now Elisha
[11:57] saying, feed it to these many people
[12:00] exponentially. So a hundred times the
[12:02] amount at least that he was suggesting.
[12:04] And he said again, Elisha, give the
[12:07] people that they may eat. For thus
[12:09] sayith the Lord, they shall eat and
[12:11] shall leave thereof.
[12:14] Remember the miracle of the loaves and
[12:15] fishes wherein Jesus multiplied for the
[12:17] thousands. And there's two different
[12:19] instances and there was some left over.
[12:21] What Elisha is doing here is in the very
[12:23] image of what Jesus did there,
[12:25] multiplying out creation. And so he set
[12:27] it before them. And they did eat and
[12:29] left thereof according to the word of
[12:33] the Lord.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Notice there was a famine in the land, a
[12:36] darth of bread and water, and there was
[12:38] some provision, but just enough to where
[12:40] this one faithfully is giving a a tithe.
[12:43] He's giving this offering of it to the
[12:46] prophet. And the prophet says, "Take
[12:48] this little personal bit that you're
[12:50] going to give me and give it to we could
[12:53] say a hundred men to eat." And the man's
[12:56] like, "There's no way this is going to
[12:57] feed him." He says, "Thus sayeth the
[12:58] Lord, there'll be some left over." And
[13:01] there was supernaturally a breaking of
[13:04] bread and a multiplication of that
[13:06] bread, that barley, those loaves of
[13:08] barley, and those uh husk of uh corn,
[13:11] the corn to where they had enough left
[13:13] over. That's supernatural.
[13:15] And we read in sec verses 38-41, I
[13:19] believe that Elisha likewise was
[13:21] providing this stew by the power of God
[13:23] BECAUSE HE TELLS HIS SERVANT to boil the
[13:25] pottage. And so we could say that
[13:28] according to the word of God, God uh
[13:31] this servant now begins to boil this
[13:33] stew. But then in verse 39, it says,
[13:36] "And one went out into the field to
[13:38] gather herbs." And so this is not the
[13:41] servant of Elisha, but one that was
[13:43] there with the sons of the prophet. and
[13:45] found a wild vine and gathered thereof
[13:47] wild gourds his lap full. So it'd be
[13:49] like an apron full up to his heart to
[13:51] his chest and came and shred them into
[13:54] the pot of pottage. So this is a
[13:56] shredding. It's not like just full
[13:59] melons that are being tossed in there or
[14:00] giant cucumbers or something to where
[14:02] it's like oh those things can be easily
[14:04] easily removed but it's shredded so it
[14:07] becomes a part of this stew for they
[14:10] knew them not.
[14:13] I read in one uh commentary called this
[14:16] the ministry of ignorance.
[14:18] And what you had is one did not know
[14:21] what they were adding.
[14:23] They maybe were sincere and they wanted
[14:25] to add to the pot and they saw that the
[14:27] prophet had ordained this feast and the
[14:29] servants are making it ready and maybe
[14:30] he wanted to help and he wanted to
[14:32] support and maybe he thought maybe it
[14:33] needed a little bit more taste and so he
[14:36] added something to the prophet's
[14:38] provision that the power of God was
[14:40] bringing forth.
[14:42] There's a there's a parallel here when
[14:45] people don't know and they're ignorant
[14:46] or whether they're ignoring God in
[14:48] prayer. They're not uh uh knowledgeable
[14:50] of the scripture. They're not seeking to
[14:52] understand, but yet they want to add
[14:53] things in and they try to add things to
[14:55] what's been prepared.
[14:58] And he says it does it ignorantly.
[14:59] Revelations 22 18 and 19. And I think we
[15:03] should look at it not just for the book
[15:05] of Revelation, but this entire book of
[15:06] the Bible. For I testify unto every man
[15:08] that heareth the words of the prophecy
[15:10] of this book. If any man shall add unto
[15:13] these things, God shall add unto him the
[15:15] plagues that are written in this book.
[15:17] So we cannot add to it. And if any man
[15:19] shall take away from the words of the
[15:21] prophecy of this book, God shall take
[15:23] away his part out of the book of life
[15:24] and out of the holy city and from the
[15:26] things which are written in this book.
[15:29] Notice in these different scenes, we can
[15:31] say one is adding something or
[15:32] subtracting something. In doing so, it's
[15:34] no longer pure.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; This is what we see happening in verse
[15:39] 39. one went outside of the prophet's
[15:42] direction, outside of what Elisha had
[15:44] already said and gathered from a wild
[15:46] vine. There's a lot of scriptures maybe
[15:49] we could use there that that that that
[15:51] one who is not heir that shuck that was
[15:52] not heir that was a wild child. And
[15:54] there's this part that's not part of the
[15:56] original or part of the vine, the true
[15:58] vine that becomes that wild gourd or
[16:00] that wild vine. And that's seen here
[16:02] that there's something being mixed in to
[16:04] what the prophet said they should eat
[16:06] during a time of famine. and they did it
[16:09] ignorantly.
[16:11] There is, this is a very interesting um
[16:15] law that our country has. We even have
[16:17] it here in the state of Arizona. There's
[16:18] different state laws, but the FDNC act
[16:22] uh food, drug and cosmetics act, the
[16:24] federal act, I put it put it here so you
[16:26] could see this. It's uh there's a code
[16:31] the section 342 of that act calls it the
[16:33] adulterated food provision. Adulterated.
[16:37] I know we hear that a lot in the
[16:38] message, but this is a real thing. If
[16:40] something's adulterated, it's a state of
[16:42] being debased by a mixture with
[16:43] something else.
[16:45] So, when we see that these wild vine and
[16:48] these wild gourds are being added into
[16:50] this pot, it's become adulterated.
[16:55] Something is being mixed into it. And
[16:57] this federal law, and it's even a state
[16:59] law, says food shall be deemed to be
[17:01] adulterated if it bears or contains any
[17:04] poisonous substance which may render
[17:06] injurous to health.
[17:08] This is a this is a federal law, a state
[17:10] law that says that our food can become
[17:12] if if food becomes poisonous, that's
[17:15] against the law. and they and they
[17:17] govern uh the the the production of food
[17:20] and the sell of food to make sure that
[17:21] it is unadulterated
[17:23] that nothing has been mixed in nothing
[17:25] has been added into it that would be
[17:27] injurous to a person's health and I
[17:29] believe that I don't know what the
[17:31] numbers have been over the last couple
[17:32] years but at one time I think in 2023 is
[17:34] nearly 700,000 deaths result a year from
[17:38] adul from adulterated food
[17:41] that chronic food illnesses kill
[17:43] hundreds of thousands of people every
[17:45] here through food poisoning, things
[17:48] being added in. And here one goes into
[17:51] the field and gathers these herbs, adds
[17:53] them into the pot, but they do it
[17:54] through ignorance. As we mentioned in
[17:57] the last couple services in Mark 7:13,
[18:00] Jesus said, "Making the word of God of
[18:01] none effect through your tradition,
[18:03] which you have delivered, and many such
[18:05] like things do ye." We saw just how much
[18:08] they complicated, unnecessarily
[18:10] complicated the word of God by adding
[18:12] their traditions and missing the point.
[18:14] They say, "Well, Jesus, if this man uh
[18:16] uh marries a woman and doesn't give her
[18:18] a son and dies and this the other one
[18:20] marries him and does this and they had
[18:21] all these complex scenarios and
[18:23] questions that they asked and they
[18:24] missed the point of it
[18:27] &gt;&gt; and they made the word of God without
[18:29] any effect
[18:31] that that our carnal addition, our
[18:33] carnal subtraction, whenever you uh add
[18:36] or take away from the word, it loses its
[18:38] force.
[18:41] Let me be very clear. We do not need the
[18:43] word plus.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Right? We do not need the word plus. IF
[18:48] SOMEBODY SAYS, "WELL, WE'VE GOT THE
[18:50] WORD. WE'VE GOT THE WORD PLUS. WE HAVE
[18:51] ALL THIS." NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
[18:53] We have the word. The word is enough.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; No. If you want to kind of expound upon
[18:57] what that includes and what that word
[18:59] does to us, that's wonderful. But there
[19:00] is no plus.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; Because as soon as you add to it, well,
[19:04] we've got the word plus a bunch of
[19:06] shouting and screaming and dancing. It's
[19:08] like, well, that plus can hybrid it.
[19:12] That plus can sour THE WORD. THAT PLUS
[19:15] COULD JUST BE A LOT OF WILD GOURDS THAT
[19:18] GETS ADDED to it and it actually weakens
[19:20] the influence of the word to provoke
[19:23] your faith because now IT'S THE WORD
[19:25] PLUS. AND IF YOU GO TO A CHURCH SERVICE
[19:27] AND YOU DON'T GET THE plus
[19:29] [Music]
[19:30] not the same anymore.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; It can't be the word plus. It's the word
[19:35] only.
[19:36] And not only if I could say this, I'd
[19:39] like to make this point just using these
[19:41] natural types and even what happens here
[19:42] in 2 Kings 4 that they had made the word
[19:45] of God of none effect through their
[19:46] tradition, but they actually made it to
[19:48] the point to where it caused spiritual
[19:49] death.
[19:51] So, not only does it uh become
[19:53] ineffective, but they create a toxicity
[19:55] to it and it becomes poisonous to our
[19:57] health, chronic spiritual illness
[20:02] that's destroying the faith of hundreds
[20:04] of thousands of Christians every year.
[20:08] So, this one went into the field and
[20:09] gathered these herbs and puts it into
[20:11] shreds it into the stew. Then in verse
[20:13] 40 it says, ' So they poured out for the
[20:15] men to eat. And it came to pass as they
[20:17] were eating of the pottage that they
[20:19] cried out AND SAID, 'OH THOU MAN OF GOD,
[20:22] there is death in the pot. They noticed
[20:26] something was wrong and it says they
[20:28] could not eat thereof. This ministry of
[20:32] ignorance has now become a ministry of
[20:33] death.
[20:35] And now by through this substance that
[20:37] they added, it had this corrupting
[20:38] influence, this souring to it. And they
[20:41] don't just say, "Oh, this tastes
[20:42] horrible. We need to add a little bit of
[20:43] this and a little bit of that." They
[20:45] said, "No, there's death in this. It's
[20:48] rendered it not just inedible or
[20:50] something, ah, I guess I can just force
[20:52] it down." And one of the things you try
[20:53] to teach your children is eat what's put
[20:54] before you because you never know when
[20:56] you might be put in a situation where
[20:58] you somebody says, "Here, we want to
[21:00] serve you our best and they need to eat
[21:01] it." And your kid goes, "THIS IS THE
[21:02] NASTIEST STUFF I'VE EVER SMELT OR TASTED
[21:04] IN MY LIFE." AND YOU OFFEND SOMEBODY.
[21:07] And so we try to teach them that if you
[21:09] just eat it, it's not going to kill you,
[21:11] right? Well, this is a situation where
[21:13] it would have killed them. They didn't
[21:15] just say, "Well, this is horrible and I
[21:17] won't I don't eat fish or I don't eat
[21:18] that. I don't eat this." And it was
[21:20] there's death in the pot.
[21:24] I think it's important to notice that
[21:28] they recognized it
[21:31] because this is where I think some
[21:33] sometimes it's missing that worldliness
[21:34] will dull our senses and that there is
[21:38] this impact of the things that we eat
[21:39] that begin to uh doubt will numb your
[21:42] faith.
[21:44] There's a lot of things that we ingest
[21:45] and we partake in and we view and we put
[21:47] into our spirits that begin to dumb us
[21:49] down. And there's a lot of things that
[21:52] poisoned the pot with death. And what
[21:54] happened here is the sons of the prophet
[21:56] were spiritual enough to catch it. They
[21:59] were spiritual ENOUGH TO SAY, "OH MY,
[22:01] WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?" And Charles
[22:03] Spurgeon just he has written some very
[22:05] beautiful things on this scripture. And
[22:06] he said the the child of the world
[22:10] um will can live on that which would
[22:12] poison.
[22:14] But not A CHRISTIAN.
[22:16] A CHILD OF THE WORLD COULD HAVE EATEN
[22:18] this stew and never noticed it in a
[22:22] spiritual sense. Listen, just think
[22:24] about this uh with our own families, our
[22:26] own spiritual walk, HOW WE KNOW PEOPLE
[22:29] WHO FEED ON THE THINGS OF THE WORLD
[22:31] WITHOUT SEEMINGLY ANY HARM.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; BUT AS A CHILD OF GOD, YOU CAN'T DO
[22:36] THAT.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; AS A CHILD OF GOD, IT WILL POISON YOU.
[22:40] IT WILL POISON YOUR FAITH. IT WILL
[22:42] CHANGE YOU.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; SAY, "WELL, my goodness gracious. I know
[22:45] people that do this in the world all day
[22:47] long and they binge on this and they
[22:48] binge on that. They're good people. They
[22:49] go to work. They keep their jobs. They
[22:51] they're honest. All these things and it
[22:53] DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THIS DEGRADING
[22:54] impact on them. BUT YOU TAKE A CHILD OF
[22:56] GOD, YOU TAKE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS BETTER,
[22:58] WHO'S BEEN RAISED IN A GOOD ATMOSPHERE,
[23:00] knows the truth. The corrupting nature
[23:02] of worldliness will bring them to a
[23:04] place where it begins to bring death
[23:05] upon them.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; We got to wake ourselves up out of that
[23:09] stuper that this poison can CAUSE AND
[23:11] SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE. THERE'S DEATH IN
[23:12] THE POT." Because what the world can
[23:15] feed on a Christian can't. A child of
[23:18] God cannot live on poisonous substance.
[23:21] So there was a a mixing in to this
[23:26] to this stew, this pottage
[23:30] that was called death.
[23:33] In 2 Corinthians chapter 2 12-1 17, I
[23:36] have a number of scriptures to read as
[23:38] I've been doing in the two prior
[23:39] services. I'm going to read a much
[23:41] larger portion so you could see uh the
[23:43] the full context of some of this
[23:46] emphasis. He says, "Furthermore, when I
[23:47] came to Trrowus to preach Christ's
[23:49] gospel, and the door was open unto me of
[23:51] the Lord, I had no rest in my spirit
[23:53] because I found not Titus, my brother,
[23:56] but taking my leave of them, I went from
[23:58] then into Macedonia." Now, thanks be
[24:00] unto God, which always causes us to
[24:03] triumph in Christ. Amen. Always causes
[24:06] us to triumph in Christ. It maketh
[24:08] manifest the savor of his knowledge by
[24:11] us in every place. So by the preaching
[24:13] of the gospel there is this uh savoring.
[24:17] There's this partaking. For we are unto
[24:20] God a sweet savor of Christ in them that
[24:22] are saved. And in them that perish to
[24:26] the one we are the savior of death unto
[24:29] death and to the other the savior of
[24:31] life unto life. Notice how the gospel is
[24:34] life to one and death to another. He
[24:36] says, "And who is sufficient for these
[24:38] things? For we are not as many which
[24:41] corrupt," the Greek word there is
[24:43] adulterate
[24:45] they which corrupt the word of God, but
[24:47] as of sincerity, but as of God in the
[24:49] sight of God, we speak in Christ.
[24:53] There are those that are adulterating
[24:55] the word of God. In other words, they're
[24:58] mixing things into it. They're messing
[25:00] with the formula. They take some things
[25:02] out. There's a way that you could uh you
[25:05] could put something together and as it
[25:07] interacts together, it could be
[25:08] something very healthy. But just take a
[25:10] little bit out of that and it changes
[25:12] the balance. It changes the interaction
[25:14] and now you've created something very
[25:15] dangerous.
[25:17] Most certainly here in second Kings just
[25:19] adding a little bit of wildness to the
[25:21] pot brought death in the pot. And Paul
[25:24] is saying there are some we are not like
[25:26] those which corrupt the word of God.
[25:29] There is an influence that tries to
[25:32] corrupt the word. That's why it's
[25:34] important to pray and important to read
[25:36] your Bibles because Satan will poison
[25:39] the pot. In Galatians 1:es 6 to7, I
[25:43] marvel that you are so soon removed from
[25:45] him that called you into the grace of
[25:47] Christ unto another gospel, which is not
[25:50] another, but there be some that trouble
[25:52] you and would pervert the gospel of
[25:54] Christ.
[25:56] They would THEY WOULD BRING DEATH INTO
[25:58] the substance. They would take the word
[26:00] which Paul gave and Paul wrote to them
[26:03] and introduced them to this great gospel
[26:05] that would be the grace of Christ. But
[26:08] then THEY SAY SOMEONE WOULD COME AND
[26:09] BEGIN to add to or take away or
[26:11] emphasize this or question that AND TRY
[26:13] TO POISON THAT WHAT you're feeding on
[26:18] cause you to lose confidence in it.
[26:21] cause you to begin to question it and
[26:23] thereby trouble you by perverting the
[26:26] gospel of Christ and in doing so try to
[26:28] render another Jesus and there's not
[26:30] another Jesus.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Paul went so far as to say if an angel
[26:34] from heaven preached a different Christ
[26:36] than what I preached then that angel's
[26:38] occur let him be accursed.
[26:41] That's what Paul said. He wrote to the
[26:43] Thessalonians in 2 Thessalonians 2:7.
[26:45] For the mystery of iniquity doth already
[26:47] work, only he who now letth will let
[26:50] until he be taken out of the way. He
[26:53] said there WOULD COME A GREAT FALLING
[26:55] AWAY, that there would be a a loosening
[26:57] of faith. There'd be those that would
[26:59] defile the truth. He says it's the
[27:01] mystery of iniquity already working
[27:03] against the truth,
[27:06] trying to mix in tradition, try to cause
[27:08] confusion regarding it.
[27:11] It's a poison.
[27:13] It's those that would adulterate the
[27:15] word of God, that would pervert the
[27:18] gospel of Christ, the mystery of
[27:20] iniquity, fighting against the truth. In
[27:22] 1 John chapter 2, 18 and 19, little
[27:25] children, it is the last time. And as
[27:27] you have heard that Antichrist shall
[27:29] come, even now are there many
[27:30] Antichrist,
[27:32] working against the church, trying to
[27:34] make it lukewarm, cold, and powerless,
[27:36] defiling the truth, changing the image
[27:38] of God. Whereby we know that this is the
[27:40] last time. They went out from us, but
[27:43] they were not of us. For had they been
[27:44] of us, they would no doubt have
[27:46] continued with us. But they went out
[27:48] that they might be made manifest, that
[27:50] they were not all of us. In other words,
[27:52] they became defilers of the truth, not
[27:54] walking in truth. We walk in the light
[27:56] as he is in the light. And the blood of
[27:58] Jesus Christ cleanses us from all
[27:59] unrighteousness. And we have fellowship
[28:01] one with another. But now we see that
[28:02] the antichrist spirit is already there
[28:05] in THE CHURCH IN THE BEGINNING BEFORE
[28:07] THE NEW TESTAMENT'S DONE BEING WRITTEN.
[28:09] IT'S ALREADY FIGHTING AGAINST the truth.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Fighting against Christ.
[28:14] Deuteronomy chapter 32 31 32 and 33
[28:18] says, "For their rock is not our rock,
[28:20] even our enemies themselves being
[28:22] judges. For their vine is of the vine of
[28:24] Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah.
[28:26] Their grapes are grapes of Gaul. Their
[28:28] clusters are bitter. Their wine is the
[28:30] poison of dragons and the cruel venom of
[28:32] asps. A lot of scriptures we could use
[28:34] about poison and venom. This one, I
[28:37] think, just perfectly sums it up that
[28:38] the believer has a rock in Jesus Christ
[28:41] and there's this vine of Sodom, the
[28:43] fields of Gomorrah that have grapes that
[28:46] are of G, that have clusters that are
[28:48] bitter, that produce a wine that is
[28:50] poison. THEY MAY TRY TO SELL IT TO YOU
[28:52] AS STIMULATION of revelation, but it's
[28:54] poisonous wine because it only feeds the
[28:58] flesh, but never the soul. We believe in
[29:01] the stimulation of revelation. We
[29:02] believe that the revelation of Jesus
[29:04] Christ in THIS HOUR WILL STIMULATE THE
[29:06] BELIEVER TO JOY, STIMULATE THEM TO
[29:07] OVERCOMING, AND THAT IF WE'RE LUCKY,
[29:10] PERHAPS IN THE FLESH, WE MIGHT BE
[29:12] STIMULATED TO CRY. WE MIGHT BE
[29:13] STIMULATED TO DANCE. THERE MIGHT BE THIS
[29:15] NATURAL RESPONSE TO THE PERSON TO THAT
[29:18] STIMULUS. BUT DON'T BE DECEIVED. THE
[29:21] REAL MIRACLE is what it does to your
[29:22] soul.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Is how it CAUSES YOU TO TRUST HIM MORE,
[29:26] TO BELIEVE IN HIM MORE, TO overcome
[29:30] &gt;&gt; because somebody else could be right
[29:32] there at the time that the stimulation
[29:33] of revelation is taking place in your
[29:35] heart by the preaching of the word. And
[29:36] the stimulus of that may cause you to
[29:39] act in character. I'm more of a HAPPY
[29:41] PERSON. I LAUGH. I CRY IN SOMEBODY ELSE
[29:44] COULD BE STIMULATED by your stimulation.
[29:47] And if we have the word plus,
[29:51] they feel like they they're part of the
[29:52] revival.
[29:55] And it could just be a vine of Sodom. It
[29:57] could be the fields of Gomorrah.
[29:59] It could be the poison of dragons.
[30:02] It could be that deadly sting of the
[30:05] serpent.
[30:08] And so the result of this poison
[30:12] spray on the word, this poisonous breath
[30:14] that Satan began to breathe into the
[30:16] church even to protect it and we got to
[30:17] watch out over it. It has this impact in
[30:21] the early church. Revelations chapter 2
[30:22] verse4. Nevertheless, I have someone
[30:24] against thee because thou hast left thy
[30:26] first love, the love of the word.
[30:31] This is what causes the church ages to
[30:33] begin is the departure. It's not a
[30:37] church age until they slide.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Becomes a church age as soon as the
[30:42] antichrist spirit begins to work against
[30:44] it causing them to lose leave their
[30:46] first love.
[30:50] And it happened and I know that you're
[30:51] students of the message. It happened by
[30:53] Satan using poison
[30:56] in second Peter chapter 2:es 9-22. I
[30:59] know this is a lengthy reading, but I
[31:00] want to read it again just to show how
[31:02] that the prophet Elisha had provided a
[31:06] meal that would sustain them naturally.
[31:11] And someone added something to it
[31:13] through ignorance that was going to
[31:14] bring death to them physically. The same
[31:17] thing happened in a spiritual sense when
[31:19] Satan swed poison into the human race
[31:21] and it brought death. The same thing
[31:24] happened to the church where there was
[31:25] something sewed into that word of God
[31:28] that made it poisonous. And so it became
[31:31] something at their table that would
[31:34] poison their faith. Peter addresses it
[31:36] this way. Verse 9, "The Lord knoweth how
[31:38] to deliver the godly out of temptations,
[31:40] and to reserve the unjust under the day
[31:42] of judgment to be punished, but chiefly
[31:44] them that walk after the flesh in the
[31:46] lust of uncleanness, and despise
[31:48] government. Presumptuous are they,
[31:50] self-willed. They are not afraid to
[31:51] speak evil of dignities. Whereas angels
[31:54] which are greater in power and might
[31:56] bring not railing accusations against
[31:58] them before the Lord. Jude wrote similar
[32:00] things just how uh bold people can be to
[32:03] speak against things and be anti-anti-
[32:06] saying that even angels which have more
[32:09] power wouldn't dare do that.
[32:13] But these are natural brute beasts made
[32:15] to be taken and destroyed,
[32:18] speak evil of the things that they
[32:19] understand not, and shall utterly perish
[32:21] in their own corruption.
[32:24] They add their shredded gourds to the
[32:28] pot,
[32:30] and they poison the pot,
[32:33] and shall receive the reward of
[32:34] unrighteousness, as they count it
[32:36] pleasure to riot in the daytime. spots
[32:38] they are in blemishes, sporting
[32:40] themselves with their own deceings while
[32:42] they feast with you. There are spots in
[32:44] that feast of charity. They become the
[32:47] the a who and I'm just using this in the
[32:50] in the language and the type that he's
[32:51] showing that there's these influence,
[32:53] these corrupting influences that would
[32:55] try to lead astray. They would change
[32:57] what you're eating. HE SAYS THERE'S
[32:58] SPOTS AND BLEMISHES WHILE THEY FEAST
[33:01] with you. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO TRY TO
[33:03] DO? CHANGE your diet? Change what you're
[33:05] eating?
[33:07] having eyes full of adultery that cannot
[33:09] cease from sin, beguiling unstable
[33:11] souls, and heart they have exercised
[33:13] with covetous practices cursed children
[33:16] which have forsaken the right way and
[33:18] are gone astray, following the way of
[33:19] Balum the son of Bazor, who loved the
[33:21] wages of unrighteousness, but was
[33:23] rebuked for his iniquity. The dumbass
[33:26] speaking with man's voice, forbade the
[33:27] madness of the prophet. These are wells
[33:30] without water, clouds that are carried
[33:31] with the tempest to whom the mist of
[33:33] darkness is reserved forever.
[33:36] Peter, share with me how you really
[33:37] feel. For when they speak great swelling
[33:40] words of vanity, they alert through the
[33:42] lust of the flesh. Through much
[33:43] wantness, those that were escaped, those
[33:46] that were clean, escaped from them who
[33:47] live in air. While they promise them
[33:50] liberty, they themselves are the
[33:51] servants of corruption. For of whom a
[33:53] man is overcome of the same as he
[33:54] brought in bondage. I'm just wanting you
[33:56] to take this all in how he's saying
[33:57] there are those that are natural brute
[34:01] beasts that have a poisonous breath.
[34:04] They'll say things. They'll do things.
[34:06] They'll encourage instability.
[34:09] Wells without water. They make a lot of
[34:11] promises, but it's all empty. It leads
[34:13] to corruption. For after they have
[34:14] escaped the pollutions of this world
[34:16] through the knowledge of the Lord and
[34:17] Savior Jesus Christ, they are again
[34:18] entangled therein and overcome. The
[34:20] latter end is worse with them than the
[34:23] beginning.
[34:25] For it had been better for them to not
[34:26] known the way of righteousness than,
[34:28] after they have known it, to turn from
[34:30] the holy commandment delivered unto
[34:31] them.
[34:32] I think there's even this temptation and
[34:35] we have to be very careful that we don't
[34:36] fall for this that once the word is made
[34:39] known to you that we don't get to the
[34:40] place where we want to kind of just
[34:42] change it to fit our agenda
[34:45] begin to well yeah I don't know about
[34:48] that but it has happened unto them
[34:51] according to the true proverb the dog
[34:52] has turned his own vomit again in the s
[34:54] that was washed to her wallowing in the
[34:56] mire there's that degrading the
[35:00] poisoning
[35:02] the unhealthiness, the uncleanness.
[35:06] I believe that what we read about in 2
[35:08] Kings chapter 4 is an example and a type
[35:10] of what happened in the New Testament
[35:12] church. It's an example of the day and
[35:14] age we live in now.
[35:18] Brothers in the church age book chapter
[35:20] 4, he says the two vines within the
[35:21] framework of the church were drifting
[35:23] further apart with an increased
[35:24] bitterness toward the true vine on the
[35:26] part of the false. Death was not only
[35:29] the seed of the false vine, but even in
[35:30] the true vine, there was a creeping
[35:32] paralysis. This is that gradual
[35:35] spreading of muscular loss and strength,
[35:38] loss of vitality, loss of energy, uh uh
[35:40] leaving thy first love and impotence.
[35:43] What does that speak of? This lack of
[35:44] self-restraint,
[35:46] this lacking physical strength. They
[35:48] were powerless because they had already
[35:49] drifted from the unadulterated truth of
[35:53] the first few years after Pentecost.
[35:57] the word becoming adulterated could no
[36:00] longer give them verility, could give
[36:02] them life, COULD NOT GIVE THEM POWER.
[36:03] AND AS THEY KEEP FEEDING ON the hybrid,
[36:06] listen, do you realize that ultra we all
[36:08] know this now, right? Thanks to uh Mr.
[36:10] KENNEDY, HOW BAD ULTRAROCESSED FOODS
[36:13] ARE, RIGHT? We had a chicken dish the
[36:16] other day that I'm sure contained all
[36:18] the red dyes in it. It was I was like,
[36:20] "How do you plug this chicken in?" But
[36:22] it was really, really, really good. And
[36:25] it may have been nuclear, I don't know,
[36:27] but uh sure enjoyed it. And there's
[36:31] THINGS THAT WE REALIZE NOW are poisoning
[36:33] us.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Ultrarocessed foods are poisoning the
[36:38] body.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; And that's what Christianity has become,
[36:41] ultrarocessed.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; That's what the message has become in
[36:44] some ways, ultrarocessed.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; And people who get that taste for the
[36:48] ultrarocessed Christianity don't like
[36:51] how strong this word is when it's
[36:53] unadulterated.
[36:54] They want to water the message down.
[36:56] They want to pick at it. They want to
[36:57] poison it. They want to change it. They
[36:59] want to add these things in.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Don't add any MSG to my MSG. It's just
[37:05] as good as it is on its own.
[37:10] He says, "No true believer is any
[37:11] stronger and spiritually healthy and
[37:13] alive than his knowledge of and
[37:14] adherence to the pure word of God." As
[37:18] seen by multitudes of examples in the
[37:19] Old Testament. Speaking in this age he
[37:21] says organization was growing quickly
[37:23] growing a pace confirming and argu
[37:25] augmenting the death of the me of the
[37:27] membership for the Holy Ghost leadership
[37:29] was deposed and the word was replaced by
[37:31] creeds dogmas and man-made ritual
[37:35] creeds dogmas and man-made ritual will
[37:37] take the power right out of something
[37:39] soon as we make anything in a church an
[37:42] ought to beside believe and we take it
[37:45] from being a believing affair into a
[37:47] feeling or emotional affair it becomes
[37:50] comes it robs it of the power of God
[37:53] becomes powerless.
[37:55] So there's this image. Now I want you to
[37:57] catch this image that just in the same
[37:59] way that this pot had been was to be
[38:02] healthy had become poisoned. And we see
[38:04] it happens to humanity. Satan sowed
[38:06] weakness into humanity which the Bible
[38:08] says he weakened the nations. We see it
[38:09] now working spiritually on the Christian
[38:12] church. Brother Bam's identifying this
[38:14] lacking in the church.
[38:17] So the believer in that day, the sons of
[38:19] THE PROPHETS SAID, "OH MAN OF GOD,
[38:22] THERE'S DEATH IN THE POT." And in verse
[38:25] 41, he said, ' Then bring meal. Love
[38:28] just how simple this is.
[38:31] Been reading a little bit about
[38:32] simplicity
[38:34] and found that there was a time
[38:37] when men were uh they didn't crave
[38:40] simplicity because they had it,
[38:44] but what they wanted was things more
[38:46] opulent and more grand because they
[38:48] didn't have it. And now that life has
[38:50] become so confusing and convoluted and
[38:53] so opulent and so many accessories and
[38:55] buttons and glowing chickens that now
[38:57] what we want is just things that are
[38:59] simple
[39:00] &gt;&gt; because we don't have it
[39:03] and notice just how simple this was.
[39:05] Then bring meal this meal is a type of
[39:07] Jesus Christ
[39:09] and he cast it into the pot and he said
[39:15] pour out for the people that they may
[39:17] eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
[39:23] Someone had come and poisoned the stew.
[39:25] They'd went and added to or taken away.
[39:27] It became toxic. But could you imagine
[39:30] if the prophet went over there and said,
[39:33] "Bear with me. Let's turn the heat down.
[39:35] I'm going to try to pick out every
[39:36] shred.
[39:38] I try to pick out every lie, every every
[39:41] wild gourd. I'm just going to try to
[39:42] pick it out or I let's just start all
[39:44] over." No. He took meal and threw it
[39:49] into the pot. That was supernatural. It
[39:53] was very simple. That was by the power
[39:54] of God. It was by his pour out the for
[39:56] the people that they may eat. It wasn't
[39:58] that that it wasn't even that the meal
[40:00] in itself uh was uh was the supernatural
[40:04] element. God used the meal
[40:06] supernaturally.
[40:08] And if I could say this and I say it
[40:09] with so much conviction, the message
[40:11] introduces Christ to cure the poisoned
[40:14] pot.
[40:16] the poison pot of Christianity, THE
[40:17] POISON POT OF denominationalism
[40:20] &gt;&gt; that he he he what he pointed TO WAS NOT
[40:22] HIMSELF, NOT HIS PERSONALITY. HE POINTED
[40:25] BACK TO THE WORD OF GOD and he
[40:27] introduced he he says bring the meal and
[40:30] HE HE CENTERS IT BACK ON CHRIST
[40:34] AND THAT BECOMES THE BOMB THAT BECOMES
[40:37] THE HEALING POWER.
[40:39] not trying to figure it all out, not
[40:41] trying to extricate all the poison, but
[40:44] it was add Christ
[40:46] and there was no harm in the pot. And I
[40:49] believe that we must follow the same
[40:50] example of Elisha.
[40:53] And we must follow the command for he
[40:55] says to pour out to the people that they
[40:57] may eat.
[40:59] And we're not going to be able to render
[41:00] this world HEALTHY AND NO HARM IN
[41:02] SOCIETY, NO HARM IN THE POT BY PICKING
[41:05] OUT ALL THE WILD gourds because it's
[41:08] impossible to keep temptation from
[41:10] coming.
[41:11] It would be it would not be wise to
[41:14] think that we're going to go ahead and
[41:15] just build a Faraday cage around our
[41:17] children. It's going to protect them
[41:19] from all evil influences and there's
[41:21] never going to be an image or a sound or
[41:23] anything. Nothing's going to get them.
[41:25] I've been trying to protect them from
[41:27] Clash Royale all these years. and then
[41:28] the pastor uses a slide with a reference
[41:30] to it. See, you're never going to be
[41:31] able to get away from it.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; And I certainly don't want to be the one
[41:34] that's a source of all your pop culture
[41:36] references, but the truth is you're not
[41:38] going to be able to in a healthy way
[41:40] keep your children from seeing and
[41:42] hearing things. That's poison.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; And so, oh, then what do we do? We just
[41:48] try to pick out all the wild gourds. No,
[41:51] you better be adding in Christ.
[41:56] you better bring meal.
[41:58] And the meal was some in this literal
[42:00] instance I have here. It was a cure for
[42:03] the poison. But it was good, wholesome
[42:05] food that was cast into a poison stew.
[42:07] And what did it do? It rendered the
[42:08] poison ineffective. Gourds are still in
[42:11] there. The shreds were still in there.
[42:14] They might have even become part of the
[42:15] mixture.
[42:18] But he said, "Bring meal." And by adding
[42:19] it, there was no harm in the pot.
[42:23] You must sew the word into your hearts.
[42:27] You must sow the word into our homes.
[42:31] And if we do that, the false will not
[42:34] poison your soul.
[42:37] I I I don't have uh we don't have maybe
[42:40] the sensitivity
[42:42] uh or or the the time or or the
[42:45] discernment THAT GREAT MINISTRIES HAVE
[42:47] TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT EVERY PERSON AND
[42:48] everything like nope nope nope. kind of
[42:51] maybe if you've been trying to kind of
[42:53] like uh is Remy and Ratatouille, right?
[42:56] He had to smell all the food to make
[42:57] sure it wasn't poisoned. Good. GOOD. WE
[43:01] DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO SNIFF EVERYTHING
[43:04] OUT. WE BUT WE DO KNOW WHAT WORD IS.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT CAN BE ADDED IN
[43:11] YOUR HOME LIFE. THAT'S WHAT CAN BE ADDED
[43:12] IN YOUR PRAYER LIFE. THAT'S WHAT CAN BE
[43:13] ADDED. ADD IN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[43:15] THERE'S no excuse.
[43:17] THERE'S NO EXCUSE TO BE LIKE, "OH, I
[43:19] HAVE NO IDEA.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; If you're going to give YOUR KID AN
[43:23] IPAD, PUT THE MESSAGE on it."
[43:25] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A CELL PHONE, PUT
[43:26] THE MESSAGE ON IT. RED FLAG IF IT'S NOT
[43:28] ON THERE.
[43:30] Just going to go ahead and say it.
[43:32] You're not allowed to pray in this
[43:33] church unless first you can prove that
[43:36] you've got the table on your or not the
[43:38] table. What's the other one we use so
[43:39] that Brother Joseph doesn't know we're
[43:40] studying? No, I I wouldn't do that. I'm
[43:43] just joking. But there's no excuse.
[43:48] And I promise you, if you're not
[43:50] praying, reading your Bible, and you're
[43:52] not feeding on the word of God,
[43:54] then it's not too hard for it to be
[43:56] poisoned.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Not too hard for someone to come by and
[44:00] produce a list of all the things that
[44:02] they tell you this message teaches. And
[44:04] if you haven't been listening and you
[44:06] don't know context and you don't know
[44:07] nature and character and you haven't had
[44:09] enough Christ
[44:11] &gt;&gt; to recognize when someone's trying to
[44:12] poison your faith, you could look at and
[44:15] say, "Did he really say that?" But yep,
[44:17] he actually said it.
[44:20] And say, "Well, yeah. Did you know that
[44:21] bo slaves to obey their their masters?"
[44:25] Yep, he said it.
[44:27] There's a lot of things that the Bible
[44:29] says, a lot of things that the mess of
[44:30] the hour can say, but it's when it's
[44:32] poisoned. When it's manipulated, when
[44:34] it's put in a false context, when it's
[44:35] handled dishonestly,
[44:38] it becomes poison.
[44:41] So, we must be feeding on the word of
[44:43] God.
[44:45] In 1 Corinthians chapter 5 7 and 8,
[44:48] purge out therefore the old leaven that
[44:49] ye may be a new lump as ye are
[44:52] unleavened. For even Christ our Passover
[44:55] is sacrificed for us. Such rich words.
[44:57] Therefore, let us keep the feast, not
[45:00] with old leaven, neither with the
[45:01] leavenven of malice and wickedness, not
[45:03] with the spots, but with the unleavened
[45:06] bread of sincerity and truth. This must
[45:09] be the spiritual feast that we partake
[45:11] in as individuals and within our
[45:12] families.
[45:14] To the extent that you have a means of
[45:16] doing that or presenting the
[45:17] opportunity, I believe there should be
[45:19] prayer, there should be reading our
[45:20] scripture, and there should be some time
[45:22] individually as families around the word
[45:24] of God. to some to some degree these
[45:27] things you you must be cultivating this
[45:29] for your own health but also for the
[45:31] development of faith in your our
[45:33] families
[45:34] my final scripture here in Galatians
[45:36] chapter 3:es 1-14
[45:39] my original working title for these
[45:41] sermons was faith in prayer faith in the
[45:43] Bible faith in the message it was all
[45:44] that we had our faith in order to grow
[45:47] has to have these elements
[45:50] and Paul in in writing this even shows
[45:52] just how easy it is for people to be
[45:54] bewitched to be poisoned. He says, "Oh,
[45:56] foolish Galatians, who have bewitched
[45:57] you, that you should not obey the truth
[45:59] before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
[46:01] evidently set forth, crucified among
[46:03] you. This only would I learn of you,
[46:05] received ye the spirit by the works of
[46:07] the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
[46:10] How is it that we could promote the
[46:12] right mental attitude towards the word
[46:14] of God if we're not hearing the word of
[46:16] God? How is it you can be uh uh stable
[46:19] emotionally?
[46:22] How is it THAT YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE
[46:23] RESTRAINT? HOW IS IT YOU CAN GROW IF
[46:25] IT'S NOT THROUGH THE HEARING of faith?
[46:28] Are you so foolish, having begun in the
[46:30] spirit? Are you now made perfect by the
[46:31] flesh? Have you suffered so many things
[46:34] in vain, if it be yet in vain? He
[46:36] therefore that minister to you the
[46:37] spirit and workketh miracles among you,
[46:39] doeth he it by the works of the law, or
[46:41] by the hearing of faith.
[46:44] Even as Abraham believed God, and it was
[46:46] accounted to him for righteousness. Know
[46:48] ye therefore that they which are of
[46:49] faith, the same are the children of
[46:51] Abraham. And the scripture for seemed
[46:53] that God would justify the heathen
[46:55] through faith preach before the gospel
[46:56] unto Abraham, saying, "In thee shall all
[46:58] nations be blessed." So then they which
[47:00] be of faith are blessed with faithful
[47:03] Abraham.
[47:04] For as many as are of the works of the
[47:06] law or under the curse. For it is
[47:08] written, "Cursed is everyone that
[47:09] continuth not in all things which are
[47:11] written in the books of the law to do
[47:12] them. For that no man is justified by
[47:15] the law in the sight of God, it is
[47:16] evident, for the just shall live by
[47:19] faith."
[47:21] and the law is not of faith, but the man
[47:24] that doeth them shall live in them.
[47:26] Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[47:29] of the law, being made a curse for us.
[47:31] For it is written, cursed is everyone
[47:33] that hangeth on a tree, that the
[47:35] blessing of Abraham might come on the
[47:36] Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we
[47:38] might receive the promise of the spirit
[47:41] through faith.
[47:44] If we could say for our own selves that
[47:45] we have begun that our experience with
[47:48] God, we go back and said that when I was
[47:50] born again and when I received this new
[47:52] birth, I I go back to this time, this
[47:54] moment of surrender, faith in God. You
[47:57] don't depart from that.
[47:59] You don't depart from that that process
[48:02] that you you're initially engaged in
[48:04] that you become a part of the body of
[48:06] Christ by one spirit. You're baptized in
[48:07] the body of Christ. We don't then begin
[48:09] to feed outside the vine
[48:12] and and gather from the world wild
[48:14] gourds and think that we're going to be
[48:15] fruitful as Christians.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; It's still you still have to maintain a
[48:20] connection with the vine. YOU STILL HAVE
[48:22] TO ABIDE IN THE VINE. THERE HAS TO BE A
[48:24] LIFE OF PRAYER AND READING your Bibles.
[48:26] THERE HAS TO BE I BELIEVE COMING TO
[48:28] CHURCH TO FEED ON THE WORD OF GOD. I
[48:30] BELIEVE THAT'S WHY CHURCH IS SO
[48:31] IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IF A MAN GETS UP HERE
[48:33] AND JUST TELLS A LOT OF STORIES AND A
[48:35] LOT OF jokes and just yucks it up and
[48:36] doesn't preach the PURE WORD OF GOD,
[48:38] THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RECEIVE THE
[48:39] BENEFIT THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE FROM TIMES
[48:42] LIKE THIS.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY I PREACH FROM THE BIBLE.
[48:45] THAT'S WHY I PREACH FROM THE MESSAGE.
[48:46] THAT'S WHY I STUDY AND PRAY BECAUSE I
[48:48] WANT TO I WANT TO KNOW THAT WHAT I'M
[48:50] GIVING YOU IS THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[48:53] that I've received a a A POTTAGE THAT
[48:56] BROTHER BRANDHAM GAVE TO US, A WORD OF
[48:58] GOD, A WORD THAT BROUGHT US BACK TO THE
[49:00] BIBLE AND THAT I CAN BE FAITHFUL TO
[49:02] PREACH THAT AND AS LONG AS I'M NOT
[49:04] SHREDDING WILD GOURDS INTO IT, THERE'S
[49:06] NO HARM IN THE POT.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; BUT IF I TRY TO PUT PERSONALITY, I try
[49:09] TO PUT POLITICS, I TRY TO ADD THINGS
[49:11] INTO IT, THAT WILL HARM THE BELIEVER.
[49:14] That's right.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO BE SO DILIGENT AS
[49:16] INDIVIDUALS, THOSE WITH MINISTRIES and
[49:18] gifts a and and LEADERS OF FAMILIES THAT
[49:20] WE'RE PRAYING, WE'RE READING OUR BIBLES,
[49:22] AND the word has place because it's by
[49:25] the hearing of faith that we'll grow.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; And it's through that that our children
[49:31] are going to receive the same experience
[49:32] that we received.
[49:35] Cannot be passed on genetically.
[49:39] And just as much as we we try to build a
[49:42] Faraday cage around our children and
[49:43] make sure that no evil image or no evil
[49:45] thought or nothing ever gets to them,
[49:46] that still none of that none of that
[49:49] picking out the wild gourds or keeping
[49:51] the wild gourds out will ever make them
[49:52] born again.
[49:54] Christ has to be added into it
[49:57] and they have to partake in that. They
[50:00] have to partake in Christ.
[50:04] As our musicians come to their
[50:06] instruments,
[50:08] brother Brandham in the sermon, God
[50:09] keeps his word, he says, "So children,
[50:13] back to your God quickly.
[50:16] Don't tangle with the world for
[50:18] anything."
[50:20] We don't want to become entangled again
[50:23] and overcome.
[50:25] Don't tangle with the world for
[50:26] anything.
[50:28] You realize it would be worth it for
[50:30] some of us tonight before we go to bed
[50:31] to ask ourselves, am I further away from
[50:34] God tonight
[50:36] than I than I have been at any other
[50:38] time in my life? Or am I closer?
[50:41] And ask ourselves that where where do I
[50:44] stand in terms of my conviction for
[50:46] truth? WHERE DO I STAND IN TERMS OF MY
[50:47] CLOSENESS TO GOD? Are there things in my
[50:49] life that are red flag SHOULD BE RED
[50:51] FLAGS to me to SHOW THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN
[50:53] GROWING IN THE FAITH AND I'M BECOMING
[50:55] MORE NUMB TO THE THINGS OF GOD? I'M I'M
[50:57] BECOMING SLACK IN EVEN MY THE THINGS
[50:59] THAT I KNOW WORK,
[51:02] the things that I KNOW THAT I DID
[51:03] ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF GOD. AND GOD
[51:04] BLESSED ME BECAUSE GOD COULD BE SPEAKING
[51:06] A WORD OF WARNING RIGHT NOW TO SAY,
[51:08] "I'VE WASHED OUT OVER YOU. I've washed
[51:09] out over you. You haven't had MUCH OF A
[51:11] FAMINE. BUT IF YOU DON'T COME BACK TO ME
[51:13] NOW, THERE'S A POINT AT WHICH I'VE got
[51:15] to take a step back and there's a loss
[51:17] of things
[51:19] and there's a stumbling and there's a
[51:21] difficulty." And he does it for what? To
[51:23] show you you're not like the world. that
[51:26] you can't eat from a poison pot and not
[51:29] be in a affected by it. That you got to
[51:31] come back to Christ. You got to add that
[51:33] back into your life. You got to become
[51:35] more faithful in the things that you
[51:36] know you ought to be faithful in. Don't
[51:38] tangle with the world for anything. He
[51:39] says, "Stay out of this modern world.
[51:42] Stay out of these modern theologies."
[51:44] It's a mouthful. There's a lot of it.
[51:49] I don't think that I I I do not believe
[51:55] Someone could just cut that out, right?
[51:57] And end of me. I believe the word of God
[52:02] and I believe that it touches on all
[52:04] phases of our lives. It ought to.
[52:07] But there's so much political rhetoric.
[52:09] There's so many so much noise out there.
[52:11] It's all part of the same poison pot.
[52:14] And someone says, "Oh, well, all this
[52:16] wokeness, why don't we just add a little
[52:18] Christian nationalism into it? That'll
[52:20] cure it." No. No. The answer the the
[52:23] answer is not in those polarities.
[52:26] The answer ISN'T MAKING HEROES OR
[52:28] VILLAINS IN THE WORLD and all its
[52:30] arenas. The answer IS CHRIST. THE
[52:33] EXAMPLE'S BEEN SET. LISTEN, YOU GO BACK
[52:35] AND listen to the message of the hour.
[52:37] You'll find that brother Brandham was
[52:38] addressing all sorts of social,
[52:40] political, economic, financial, and
[52:42] health issues that are the same today.
[52:45] They're just more pronounced and
[52:47] greater. But he was dealing with them in
[52:48] seed FORM. AND THE ANSWER WAS, WELL, WE
[52:51] need to do this diet and we need to vote
[52:52] for this party and we need to do this
[52:53] and we need to do that. LISTEN, THERE
[52:55] WAS A CALL BACK TO CHRIST.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ANSWER.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; All modern theologies want to strip
[53:04] Christ out of it and then take the very
[53:06] thing that points you back to Christ and
[53:08] poison it.
[53:11] He says just look to the lamb of God.
[53:13] Read your Bible and pray all the time.
[53:17] Don't be weary. Be rejoice and happy for
[53:19] the redemption of the church is drawing
[53:21] nigh when we shall see him who died for
[53:24] us.
[53:26] Look to the lamb of God and read your
[53:28] Bible and pray all the time. It's a
[53:30] challenge to us here at this church
[53:33] to become individually those that pray
[53:37] to God, those that read their Bibles and
[53:40] listen to the word.
[53:42] And I promise you, it'll make a
[53:44] difference. Did anyone testify that it
[53:46] has that it is? And that'll make us
[53:50] healthy
[53:52] and that'll make our homes healthy. And
[53:55] I believe that it will actually be a
[53:56] cure for a lot of things that are
[53:57] poisoning us because it's a promise.
[54:01] Let's stand together.
[54:04] [Music]
[54:08] Let's just let's pray tonight together.
[54:12] Lord, if there's poison,
[54:16] then I just I hear you knocking tonight.
[54:20] And he said, if any man will hear my
[54:22] voice and open, I will come in and suck
[54:24] with him. I'm not worried about I'm not
[54:27] worried about all the poisons. Then I'm
[54:30] not worried about all the lies. I'm not
[54:31] worried about all the manipulation
[54:32] because boy, that would just it would
[54:34] drive you absolutely insane if you were
[54:36] going to try to untangle the wild gourds
[54:38] that have been shredded into the pot.
[54:41] But tonight, you can receive him,
[54:43] Christ, the meal offering. You can
[54:45] receive Christ and say, "Lord, I I I
[54:48] have poison in my mind. I have poison in
[54:49] my spirit. I've got all these things
[54:52] that are just affecting me. So, Lord, I
[54:54] just receive you now. I and I need
[54:57] Christ to to to re remove the harm."
[55:02] Our gracious heavenly father, tonight we
[55:04] plead to you.
[55:06] Oh, Christ, there's death in the pot.
[55:10] And so Lord, we pray that you would step
[55:12] into our mixture. Lord, you would step
[55:13] into our lives and that you by coming
[55:15] in, you could become that balm that
[55:17] heals.
[55:19] And Lord, I know that even of my own
[55:21] accord, I've sewed things into my
[55:23] children's minds and in their hearts.
[55:25] And even in my marriage, Lord, there's
[55:27] ways that we don't always treat with the
[55:29] kindness that we ought to. We don't
[55:30] always make the right decisions. We're
[55:32] not always proactive. And Lord, surely
[55:34] we can look at our families and say,
[55:36] "Oh, it's just a toxic brew. There's
[55:37] just so much that's been stirred into
[55:39] this pot. And Lord, we could fret. Oh,
[55:41] there's poison. There's poison. But
[55:43] Lord, I know that you're the answer.
[55:46] And Father, I come to you now, the bread
[55:48] of life.
[55:49] And Lord, I receive you as being the
[55:51] answer for the old the things that
[55:53] poison my mind, that poison my spirit,
[55:56] that poison the atmosphere in my home.
[55:58] And Lord, I could spend from now until
[56:01] the change trying to get my house clean
[56:03] and rid itself of so many different
[56:05] things, but if I never introduce you, if
[56:08] I never bring you to the table, if I
[56:10] never feed on your word, it's not by
[56:12] faith. It would be by works. And so,
[56:13] Father, I pray tonight that we could
[56:16] come back to you unreservedly, holding
[56:19] nothing BACK FOR THE UNADULTERATED WORD
[56:21] OF GOD. LORD, MAY WE APPLY THIS GREAT
[56:24] COMMANDMENT IN THIS HOUR THAT WE OUGHT
[56:26] NOT TO FEED ANYTHING THAT'S POISONED.
[56:30] AMEN.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; And Lord, where we don't have the
[56:34] sensitivities or sensibilities to sniff
[56:36] everything out, may we go to that which
[56:37] we know is pure and feed on that
[56:42] for chance, Lord, that there are things
[56:43] when what we read and what we see and
[56:45] things we're doing that could have some
[56:47] poisonous effect that by feeding on you,
[56:49] by feeding on the word, it'll render it
[56:52] harmless.
[56:54] Then we can grow and increase in wisdom
[56:56] and understanding and knowledge and
[56:57] discernment. And I believe it can make a
[56:59] great difference in our lives. So Lord,
[57:01] I pray for this church, these faithful
[57:04] ones that come on this Wednesday night
[57:05] and they hang on every word. Not because
[57:08] it's me speaking, Lord. They do it
[57:09] regardless of the minister that stands
[57:11] behind this desk, but it's because they
[57:13] recognize the value of this word and how
[57:16] Satan's trying to cut away at it. Bless
[57:19] these families tonight. Bless the
[57:20] individuals, those that couldn't be here
[57:22] tonight. I pray that you would spark a
[57:23] genuine word revival in their lives.
[57:26] those that long to be here, those who
[57:28] maybe have used a lot of excuses to not
[57:30] be here. Father, I pray that these
[57:32] things would help focus them.
[57:35] They could use the word to cure the
[57:37] poison.
[57:38] I commit them to you now in the name of
[57:40] Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:42] Amen.
