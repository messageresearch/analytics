[0:00] If you'd like to turn with me to
[0:03] Psalms
[0:05] 23 and verse 5, I've got um a very
[0:10] simple thought in my heart and um but I
[0:14] think it's it's something that stems
[0:16] over not only in my life but um lives
[0:18] that I've seen around me and and um just
[0:21] kind of um how God blesses us and
[0:26] anoints us and what it really means for
[0:29] that. And I just want to kind of give
[0:31] that thought out. Psalms 23:5 here. I'm
[0:35] gonna have it in my tablet, but I want
[0:38] to go to the scripture because it's um I
[0:41] I think from the youngest to the oldest,
[0:43] everybody knows that scripture. Um I'm
[0:45] sure most of us can recite it without
[0:48] even reading it. But in five, it says,
[0:50] "Thou preparest the table before me in
[0:53] the presence of mine enemies. Thou
[0:55] anointest my head with oil. My cup runth
[0:59] over. Let us just pray after this
[1:02] scripture. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:04] have read your scripture. Now we just
[1:06] ask that you continue to take control of
[1:08] this service, Lord, and just give us
[1:11] what we need, Father, Lord, so that we
[1:13] may not only be encouraged, but that we
[1:16] may just feel ready to go and and
[1:20] understand your goodness and your
[1:22] blessings around us. Father, touch each
[1:24] and every person here. Father, whatever
[1:27] continual thing that they they need.
[1:29] Lord, I just ask that you just work in
[1:32] their lives as we speak. In the name of
[1:34] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[1:36] And amen. Amen. You may be
[1:39] seated. Um I I was reading the the um
[1:44] the message um why little Bethlehem
[1:47] that's preached in 1958. And brother
[1:49] Brandham, he really um goes into detail
[1:52] of David's little trial whenever he was
[1:56] a fugitive king and how God anointed
[1:59] him. He anointed his head and now he
[2:02] finds himself in this predicament of
[2:05] well I'm here amongst enemies. I'm I'm
[2:09] here not crowned as a king but yet you
[2:12] anointed me Lord. And brother Brandham
[2:14] said that when he was in those caves,
[2:16] when he was between the Philistines and
[2:18] Saul, he began to remember this song
[2:22] that he sang that he remembers when he
[2:25] was a young kid and and he would sing
[2:27] this song, Lord, you are my shepherd. I
[2:29] shall not want. And he would remember
[2:31] how him as a shepherd, he would lead the
[2:34] sheep and and he would see himself as a
[2:36] sheep and he say, Lord, I am just like
[2:38] that little sheep. and and he had to go
[2:41] back to those times of whenever he sang
[2:44] this song and saying,"Lord, even though
[2:46] I'm surrounded by enemies, even though
[2:48] I've got all these issues, yet Lord, you
[2:51] have blessed me. You have anointed me."
[2:54] And um and it's an amazing thing because
[2:58] sometimes brother Brandham he says after
[2:59] he says that he says I remember when I
[3:02] was a little boy preacher and whenever
[3:04] the pastures were green and when
[3:06] everything was okay but now the battle
[3:08] is on. Now we're we're in the heat of
[3:11] the battle and we can go back and we can
[3:13] see our time in the little eagle's nest
[3:16] and and how God took care of us and how
[3:18] we had these little revivals in our
[3:20] lives. But now the the battle is on in
[3:23] our lives.
[3:24] And and sometimes we have to understand
[3:27] Lord, you have blessed me. That I am a
[3:30] blessed person. I am an anointed person.
[3:35] I I started to think about this thought
[3:37] of being blessed. And and um I often
[3:39] hear statements and I'm sure I've said
[3:41] it a lot of times where it's like,
[3:42] "Lord, I'm so blessed. Oh man, brother,
[3:46] sister, I'm blessed because I I I've got
[3:48] another position in my job or oh,
[3:50] because of this or because of that or so
[3:52] and so was healed and and we're just so
[3:54] blessed. And we kind of use those kind
[3:57] of that statement saying, "Oh, I'm
[3:59] blessed because uh my children are doing
[4:01] good or I'm blessed because I got a
[4:03] promotion or I feel so blessed. This is
[4:06] just a blessed day." And sometimes um we
[4:10] don't understand why we're saying it or
[4:12] sometimes we'll hear the world say it
[4:14] saying, "Oh, I am so blessed." And a lot
[4:16] of times we hear it or we say it because
[4:19] of maybe good fortune or of good
[4:22] circumstances. And we say, "Man, I'm so
[4:24] blessed." You know, you can drive up
[4:26] with a Ferrari and oh man, I'm so
[4:28] blessed. And everybody's going to be
[4:29] like, "Uh-huh. He's so blessed. Look at
[4:30] him." Why? It's that's just the way we
[4:33] think that that is blessings. And today
[4:37] that's the the word blessed. It's often
[4:40] used for somebody to that has received
[4:43] material things, earthly benefits, um
[4:46] such
[4:47] uh wealth, success, their health, boot,
[4:51] uh beauty, social uh honor. Being
[4:55] blessed in this modern sense has become
[4:59] um to mean having more better things
[5:02] than the average person, right? we can
[5:04] all be the same, but if if I get
[5:06] promoted, then I'm the blessed one,
[5:08] right? And um that that's that's how
[5:11] being blessed is being associated now.
[5:13] It's associated with abundance, comfort,
[5:17] s uh uh uh visible prosperity. And in
[5:21] this this view, being blessed is um
[5:25] seeing that we're we're living higher
[5:27] than others or or we're we're doing
[5:31] something better than the average person
[5:33] or something. And but but we have to
[5:36] understand that that is just a shallow
[5:38] way of looking at what being blessed is.
[5:41] Um if if you're not careful if if you
[5:43] have social medias or something, you can
[5:45] see people that are very blessed. They
[5:49] can put hashtag blessed and they'll have
[5:51] many filters and be in in the Bahamas
[5:54] and all of that and we can say, man,
[5:57] these people are blessed. But that's
[5:59] just a shallow version of what being
[6:03] blessed is. It's being misused. And it's
[6:06] what what's happening is it taking the
[6:08] value of what the true meaning is. And
[6:11] if you think about it, when we think
[6:14] about being blessed that way, it becomes
[6:16] unstable.
[6:18] It becomes unstable because what happens
[6:21] when the fortune is gone? What what
[6:24] happens when we don't feel blessed,
[6:26] right? Whenever we we feel like we uh
[6:30] something happens in our family, a
[6:32] sickness happens, some something
[6:34] happens, then if we're basing our
[6:36] blessings around material or outward
[6:39] things or outward circumstances, then
[6:42] our blessing is going to go from up here
[6:44] to down there to up here because
[6:46] blessings are going to be token and
[6:48] blessings going to be given throughout
[6:50] our lives. If we look at it that way and
[6:54] and um then we'll un think like oh well
[6:57] I guess I'm not as blessed as other
[7:00] people. Maybe I just missed out on the
[7:02] lot of
[7:03] blessings. But it's because they're
[7:06] looking around these things and and I
[7:08] think the reason why people have this
[7:12] shallow that thing because they don't
[7:14] understand the revelation of what
[7:16] blessed actually is or blessed comes
[7:19] from the Bible.
[7:21] If you'd like to turn with me in uh 1
[7:24] Peter
[7:28] 4:14, Peter, he's um showing a picture
[7:32] of what being blessed is. He says, "For
[7:37] if ye be reproached in the name of
[7:40] Christ, happy are you. For the spirit of
[7:44] the Lord and of God resteth upon you. On
[7:49] on their part he is evil speak spoken of
[7:52] but on your part he is
[7:55] glorified. Now it says if ye be
[7:58] approached in the name of
[8:01] Christ, happy are ye. and it'll
[8:05] automatically make well it made me think
[8:07] that I'm happy because I'm being
[8:10] reproached from Christ because of
[8:12] Christ. But that's not what it's saying
[8:14] here. It's not saying that be be happy
[8:17] because you're being reproached. But it
[8:19] says happy are ye for the spirit of
[8:24] glory restth upon you. The spirit of
[8:26] glory and of God resteth upon you. That
[8:29] word if you look at every other
[8:31] translation is
[8:33] because so happy you are you not because
[8:36] you're getting reproach not because
[8:38] you're going through those things for
[8:39] the sake of Christ but because the Holy
[8:42] Spirit is resting upon you
[8:45] and that word happy the literal
[8:49] translation is you if you are being
[8:51] reproached in the name of Christ you are
[8:55] blessed because the spirit of the glory
[8:57] of God resteth upon you. So that word
[9:00] it's to be blessed. It's macarios which
[9:04] is far more deeper than just being
[9:07] happy. Happy is just the the root word
[9:11] for happy is h a p. It means
[9:14] luck. So when you're happy it's because
[9:17] of good fortune or if it's it's because
[9:19] of some kind of lucky deal that you got
[9:22] and that's going to be unstable. It's
[9:24] all going to leave one day and then
[9:27] you'll get it back the next day. But
[9:30] this happy is a
[9:33] blessed is no matter what you're going
[9:35] through. Whether you're going through a
[9:36] good time or you're going through a bad
[9:38] time, you are blessed.
[9:42] That's a big difference than, man, I
[9:44] just got a check in the mail. I'm
[9:46] blessed.
[9:47] Or I just got this, I'm blessed. Or this
[9:50] is happening, I'm blessed. or this isn't
[9:52] happening. I'm not
[9:53] blessed. When you take all of that or
[9:56] all those things are happening to you,
[9:58] you could still say, "Thank you, Lord. I
[10:01] am blessed."
[10:02] Why? Because you're suffering? No.
[10:04] Because the spirit of God resteth upon
[10:07] you.
[10:09] The Holy Spirit is with
[10:11] you. And and if if we see it the other
[10:16] way, there's going to be fluctuations
[10:18] from ups and downs.
[10:20] Now the same word that's uh macarios or
[10:23] blessed this this is the same word Jesus
[10:26] uses in the
[10:28] biatitudes Jesus didn't say um blessed
[10:31] are thee for you are or if you are
[10:35] healthy or healthy or
[10:39] strong. He said blessed are the poor in
[10:42] spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[10:45] heaven. Blessed are they that mourn.
[10:49] Now if you see it that way now we
[10:51] understand now we're not being blessed
[10:53] because we are mour mourning or because
[10:55] we are poor but it is a characteristic
[10:58] of the blessed
[11:00] that sometimes we are going to go
[11:02] through those things. We are poor in
[11:04] spirit but those that are are in the
[11:07] spirit that are in that have the spirit
[11:09] in them they are blessed whether they
[11:12] areing whether they are poor in spirit.
[11:15] Blessed are the meek. Blessed are they
[11:18] that which hunger and thirst for
[11:20] righteousness, for they shall be filled.
[11:23] Blessed are the
[11:24] merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
[11:28] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
[11:30] shall see God. Blessed are the
[11:32] peacemakers, for they shall be called
[11:35] the children of God. Blessed are they
[11:38] which are persecuted for righteousness
[11:40] sakes, for theirs is the kingdom of
[11:43] heaven. Blessed are ye when men revile
[11:47] you and persecute you and shall say all
[11:49] manner of evil against you falsely for
[11:52] my name for my sake. Rejoice exceedingly
[11:56] glad. Be happy.
[12:00] Rejoice. Be happy. Why? You're blessed.
[12:03] The Holy Spirit is with you. For your
[12:06] reward for great is your reward in
[12:09] heaven. For so persecuted the prophets
[12:11] which were before you.
[12:14] Now it says he he he describes that
[12:18] condition of being blessed that the
[12:20] spirit of the glory of God is resting
[12:23] upon you. That is the condition of being
[12:28] blessed. Jesus he says in Luke
[12:32] 4:18 he says the spirit of the Lord
[12:36] restth upon me. He said, "Blessed are
[12:40] thee because the spirit rests upon you."
[12:46] He said, "The spirit of the Lord is upon
[12:48] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[12:52] the gospel to the poor, and he hath sent
[12:54] me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
[12:57] deliverance to the captives, and
[13:00] recovering the sight of the blinds, to
[13:02] set at liberty them that are bruised."
[13:05] So this blessing is the favorfilled
[13:08] condition that flows from
[13:10] anointing. He said he said the so the
[13:14] condition of being blessed is the spirit
[13:17] being on you. Now Jesus is saying the
[13:21] holy spirit or the spirit is on me
[13:24] because I have been
[13:26] anointed. So now we we are being blessed
[13:29] because of the spirit of the the
[13:32] anointing flowing from us.
[13:35] that the Holy Spirit is with us. Brother
[13:38] Brandham, he says in the message, why
[13:40] are people so tossed about? He says,
[13:43] "Some people gets the wrong impression
[13:45] of what anointing is." Did you ever
[13:49] think that when the greatest anointing
[13:51] ever give to anyone, what did they do
[13:55] when they had the anointing? The
[13:57] greatest anointing that was ever given
[13:59] to anyone was Jesus Christ. We have the
[14:03] spirit, but by measure he had it without
[14:06] measure. And one day he entered into the
[14:09] temple and picked up a scroll and read
[14:12] and read said, "The spirit of God is
[14:14] upon me, for he hath anointed me to
[14:16] preach the acceptable year to the blind
[14:19] um to bind up the broken hearts, to heal
[14:22] the sick, to give sight to the blind."
[14:24] And now we we would think if such an
[14:28] anointing was on him had been prophesied
[14:31] 800 years before that it would come and
[14:34] here it was with a type of anointing the
[14:38] fullness ble the full blessing and
[14:41] anointing of Lord upon him. We would
[14:44] want to run all over the building scream
[14:47] and
[14:47] holler. So people say oh man the
[14:50] anointing's on me. The first thing we
[14:51] want to do is jump and holler. But he
[14:54] says, "When the anointing, the fullness
[14:56] of the Holy Spirit, the fullness of God
[14:59] was in this man, how did he act?" He
[15:03] said, "We see that when we hear about
[15:05] anointing, what do we want to do? We
[15:07] want to jump and holler, run around
[15:09] everywhere because think that's
[15:10] anointing.
[15:12] We think that's that's what it is but he
[15:14] says but the Bible said he laid down the
[15:17] scroll and he sat down and precious
[15:21] words proceeded out of his mouth. That's
[15:24] what he done under anointing. The
[15:27] anointing is not an emotion. The
[15:29] anointing is supreme power in control
[15:33] knowing exactly what and how. See,
[15:38] that's where the bride is at today.
[15:41] We are not in a jumper jumping and
[15:43] hollering and and stammering and all of
[15:45] this. We are when the anointing comes,
[15:48] the fullness of the anointing comes on
[15:51] the bride. It's a sitting down and
[15:54] taking up the word and speaking.
[15:57] It's knowing who they are. It's where he
[16:00] could look at prophecy and say, "This
[16:03] day, this has been fulfilled. This
[16:06] scripture has been fulfilled."
[16:08] when we could be anointed fully from God
[16:12] when everybody's saying, "Oh, I'm
[16:14] blessed. I'm blessed." The bride is
[16:16] there with enemies all around them.
[16:19] Brother said in the in the message why
[16:22] um little Bethlehem, he said, "What are
[16:24] the
[16:25] enemies?" Whenever the devil says, "Oh,
[16:28] just take a drink for of social reasons.
[16:31] Oh, just just do this. Just just drop
[16:34] the bar just a little." Those are your
[16:36] enemies surrounding you.
[16:38] Every time the enemy wants to take you
[16:41] out of your character, wants to take you
[16:43] out of blessing, wants to take you out
[16:46] of those things. But you are blessed.
[16:48] You have been anointed around the world,
[16:52] around the the enemy. You're
[16:58] anointed. He says, or it says uh to be
[17:02] blessed is to be anointed.
[17:05] It is to have the spirit of God resting
[17:08] upon you, guiding you, strengthening
[17:11] you, and setting you apart.
[17:14] This blessing isn't um isn't something
[17:17] that fades with circumstances or changes
[17:20] with
[17:21] seasons. The blessings that the people
[17:23] have, the world
[17:25] has, those change with circumstances.
[17:28] Those will change with seasons. We can
[17:31] be we we can have good things. We can
[17:34] have be blessed. But that isn't a
[17:38] definition of why we are blessed.
[17:41] That doesn't mean that we're blessed.
[17:44] We're blessed whenever his anointing is
[17:46] with us.
[17:48] Brother Brandham says you can have all
[17:50] these things and and doesn't mean God's
[17:53] blessing is on you.
[17:55] We can have all these things and we
[17:57] could I could say we can have the lack
[17:59] thereof doesn't mean God's blessing is
[18:01] on us or that his his blessing isn't on
[18:04] us.
[18:07] His blessing is whenever his anointing
[18:10] comes and rests upon you and not just
[18:14] like how brother Brandham says in the
[18:16] anointed ones at the end times where
[18:18] it'll it'll touch somebody that we get
[18:22] experiences of the Holy Spirit. No, it's
[18:24] an indwelling.
[18:26] If ye abide in me and I abide in you,
[18:29] that's for the end time.
[18:31] Where we are fully abiding in Christ.
[18:35] You know, I was um um studying there
[18:39] there's uh theological words called
[18:42] transcendence and and
[18:44] imminence and that there's some people
[18:46] that say how God is transcendent and
[18:49] means that God he is greater and above
[18:53] everybody. And it reminds me of brother
[18:55] uh Erin's message on um uh what was it?
[19:00] It it was when he was talking about the
[19:02] art uh and he was talking about how
[19:04] something is common and how people will
[19:07] separate God into this great holy thing
[19:11] to where he cannot be touched that he is
[19:14] greater his thoughts are far greater and
[19:16] yes there is scripture that that God is
[19:19] transcendent but then this other word
[19:22] means he's which means he's
[19:24] imminent means he's in us he's in
[19:28] everything and he's acting ly working
[19:31] now.
[19:33] And and I truly believe that that is
[19:36] where Christ is today.
[19:39] But I don't believe his imminence is
[19:42] everywhere. I believe he's
[19:45] omnipresent. I believe that there is a a
[19:47] a sparrow where he knows every single
[19:50] feather on its head. That the sun cannot
[19:54] go up without him. That that his
[19:57] presence is is everywhere. But his
[20:00] imminence is only in his bride.
[20:03] That he's actively working in his
[20:05] people.
[20:07] That he's just like when Jesus on was on
[20:10] the earth, the sun was still rising and
[20:12] the sun was still going. The moon was
[20:14] going around and all things were going.
[20:16] And that was because of the power of
[20:18] God. Yet the imminence and the presence,
[20:21] the fullness of God was in a man named
[20:24] Jesus Christ.
[20:26] Brother Brandham said that today is
[20:28] going to be the same way. That the
[20:31] fullness of God was going to be in a
[20:33] group of people that were going to be
[20:36] despised and rejected, but yet they were
[20:39] going to hold the fullness of his
[20:41] anointing.
[20:43] And we weren't going to be just like in
[20:45] the past ages where we get an anointing.
[20:47] We get some kind of anointing and we
[20:49] feel like we're an anointed one and we
[20:51] jump and shout and we we create
[20:54] doctrines. But it's where we can sit
[20:56] down with the word
[20:58] and begin to speak.
[21:00] The word can be revealed.
[21:04] Why? Because word has been revealed. And
[21:07] now we can open it because we are
[21:10] anointed to read it. We are anointed not
[21:12] only to read but to step into it. I
[21:16] truly believe that's where his Holy
[21:18] Spirit is today is in us.
[21:23] So his
[21:25] anointing that is his blessing and his
[21:28] blessing is his anointing. And I started
[21:30] to think about David how this young man
[21:35] he was um brother Brandham called him or
[21:37] the Bible calls him a ruddy kid and
[21:39] brother just continues on. He's a little
[21:42] little tiny guy, runt of a guy. And yet
[21:45] God calls this
[21:47] man.
[21:49] Finally Saul, he kind of sended his way
[21:52] around away from the
[21:54] anointing. The prophet Samuel cries for
[21:58] him as he should because he was the
[22:00] anointed king. And he's
[22:03] crying because he knows that everything
[22:05] fell apart. That the people, he felt
[22:09] like the people rejected him. God raised
[22:12] up a man and now he's being rejected by
[22:15] God. And here's this man distraught,
[22:17] crying. And God says, "Get up. I've
[22:19] chosen another
[22:20] one. I chose one. I chose of my own
[22:24] choosing." I believe that's where we're
[22:26] at. I believe there's people that that
[22:29] will rise there. There's things that
[22:31] will rise. There's thoughts that will
[22:33] rise. But there's a people that have
[22:35] been chosen by his own choosing.
[22:38] That was David. He was chose by God's
[22:42] own
[22:43] choosing. It reminds me of
[22:45] whenever the churches were going in that
[22:48] vision and and he would see these
[22:51] churches and and as he would see them,
[22:53] it it almost seemed like they would
[22:54] degrade more and more. A and as a
[22:57] prophet, he began to cry. And he says,
[23:00] "What have has all this been in
[23:03] vain? All of his labor felt like it was
[23:06] in vain because these churches, these
[23:09] people, and I I truly believe that maybe
[23:12] that's how Samuel
[23:14] felt. This man had been anointed and now
[23:17] he's fell." But there was a
[23:19] bride that came up and he said, "Hold
[23:22] on. There's another
[23:24] one. Hold on. This is the bride. It's
[23:28] not going to be a great people. It's not
[23:30] going to be g great cathedrals and great
[23:34] uh intellectual things. It's going to be
[23:38] just like brother Brandham called David
[23:41] little runs and ruddies and just but yet
[23:46] that is the apple of his eye. And it
[23:48] wasn't because of how great these people
[23:50] were just like Saul, but it was what was
[23:53] in his heart. Amen.
[23:56] It was his dedication to the Lord.
[23:59] And he goes and he sees him and and in
[24:01] the message why little Bethlehem, he
[24:03] says, "But the prophet with the
[24:05] anointing oil in his hand, he said,
[24:08] haven't you got another one?" He went
[24:11] from brother to brother to brother. And
[24:14] maybe each one said, "Oh man, this is
[24:16] the reason I could be king." The other
[24:19] one says, "Man, I'd be a good king
[24:20] because of this." Then the strongest
[24:22] said, "I'd be the strongest. I'm just
[24:25] almost as tall as Saul.
[24:29] But every single one and even Samuel
[24:31] with his own eyes saw, wow, that one
[24:33] could be him. Wow. Why? Because he was
[24:36] looking with his own eyes.
[24:38] And you know what? The world can look at
[24:40] with in their own eyes and they can see
[24:42] what the bride should be. They can see
[24:45] what an anointing should
[24:48] be. But then he says, "Haven't you got
[24:50] another one?"
[24:52] And he brought them one by one until
[24:55] finally he said, "Haven't you got
[24:57] another one?" He said, "I've got one,
[25:00] but perhaps he wouldn't be
[25:02] nothing. He's just a little dried up
[25:05] sort of a fellow. We got him out here
[25:08] hurting sheep." He said, "Go get him."
[25:12] And as soon as he he fell in his eyes of
[25:16] the um he uh he fell in the eyes of the
[25:19] anointed prophet, he poured the oil on
[25:22] his head and run to meet him and said,
[25:25] "God is is this the um this is the one
[25:29] God chose." See, see, it's not the
[25:32] tinsel always of the world. It's God's
[25:35] choosing. And by God's grace, he chose
[25:38] us. We're so grateful for that this
[25:42] morning. I imagine this young man
[25:46] anointed to be
[25:49] king.
[25:51] Anointed to be the man of the
[25:56] hour. He was anointed, but he was never
[25:59] appointed. He wasn't appointed at that
[26:02] time. A young man anointed to be the
[26:06] king of Israel. Not only that, but
[26:09] through his lineage. I'm sure he didn't
[26:12] know yet his lineage, the son of David
[26:15] was out there
[26:17] waiting. His lineage, the son of David
[26:20] was going to be there. Anointed to say,
[26:23] "The Lord has anointed me. His spirit
[26:25] resting upon
[26:28] me." Young man, anointed yet not
[26:31] appointed.
[26:34] He was anointed to be king, but yet
[26:36] another man was on the
[26:39] throne. That's you have to think about
[26:42] this is is what a dangerous position he
[26:44] was
[26:46] in surrounded by enemies. Now,
[26:49] surrounded by by all of these things,
[26:52] yet God chose
[26:54] him. God chose him to be the king. Oh
[26:58] man, for me when I read this simple
[27:00] story I say Lord that's me.
[27:04] That's me
[27:06] anointed.
[27:07] Unworthy but anointed.
[27:10] He could have chose anybody but he chose
[27:13] a chosen people.
[27:16] And and the amazing thing is is we're
[27:18] anointed. God has given his anointing
[27:21] his Holy Spirit. Yet one day we will be
[27:23] appointed.
[27:25] One day we will be standing with the
[27:27] King of Kings and the bride by her his
[27:30] side.
[27:32] But right
[27:33] now she's rejected by the world,
[27:38] unrecognized. Brother Brandham said
[27:41] whenever David was in his situation, he
[27:44] said that he there was a denomination on
[27:47] one
[27:48] side, religious on the other side, but
[27:51] yet there the bride
[27:54] sets. That's where she's at today. She's
[27:57] at at at a point of anointing.
[28:00] And everywhere you go, even though
[28:02] you're living just a regular life, an
[28:05] everyday
[28:06] life, you do things every day mundane,
[28:10] you have been chosen by
[28:12] God. You have been chosen so that one
[28:16] day you'll be standing there with Jesus
[28:22] Christ. So nothing changed hourly. I'm
[28:26] sure he was still picked on by his
[28:28] brothers. Who knows?
[28:30] He still went back and tending
[28:33] sheep. He still did the same exact
[28:37] things. He still just lived his own
[28:41] life. But brothers, something
[28:44] spiritually shifted
[28:47] outwardly the same kid. Was there a
[28:50] crown put on his head? No. He was the
[28:52] same David. Yet something spiritually
[28:56] was inside of him.
[28:58] The Bible, it says, "The spirit of the
[29:00] Lord came mightily upon David from that
[29:03] day
[29:05] forward." Man, what an amazing thing. He
[29:08] was an anointed king. And God, you know
[29:12] how good God is? Put him right where the
[29:15] enemy was
[29:16] at. Right where the very one that wanted
[29:19] to kill him, he set him right there in
[29:21] the enemy's
[29:23] courts. Faithful, serving the Lord.
[29:27] Brothers, we have darts all around us.
[29:30] You have situations going on in your
[29:33] lives every single day that's trying to
[29:35] cause you to fail. Cause you to say,
[29:38] "Hey, you're not anointed. Hey, I'm the
[29:41] anointed one. We there there is one that
[29:44] is still the God of this evil age.
[29:47] He's still standing there in that throne
[29:50] of this world."
[29:53] even to the point when he saw the son of
[29:55] David, he said, "Hey, look at all all of
[29:58] this kingdom that I have. If you bow to
[30:01] me, you can have
[30:03] everything." But brother Brandham says
[30:05] he knew all of those kingdoms would fall
[30:08] to him in the millennial
[30:10] reign. And now the bride of that very
[30:14] king is right
[30:16] here standing here. And the devil's
[30:19] doing the same thing.
[30:21] You see, we're sitting in the court.
[30:24] We're blessing the world. The Bible
[30:26] says, "You are the light of the world."
[30:29] The The Bible said whenever whenever the
[30:32] anointing came upon David, a spirit, a
[30:36] evil spirit went upon
[30:39] Saul. So, the world, there's an evil
[30:42] spirit out to get the bride. There's an
[30:45] evil spirit wanting back the kingdom.
[30:49] Yet he's he's actively ruling now. He's
[30:54] actively working right now. Yet there is
[30:57] a David in their midst. There's a David
[31:00] working. There's a David not only
[31:02] working in their midst, but blessing
[31:05] him. Isn't that beautiful that you can
[31:08] go to work and you can bless somebody
[31:10] else? That
[31:12] sometimes they're so quick to blaspheme
[31:15] the word. They're so quick to to make
[31:18] fun of a Christian. They're so quick to
[31:20] do all those things, yet you're there
[31:24] blessing
[31:25] them. No, I I I remember just a it's
[31:29] just a little thought that came to my
[31:31] mind, but I have a a buddy named
[31:34] Job, and every time something bad
[31:37] happens to him, he says, "What's going
[31:39] on, man? Like, what? You're not praying
[31:41] for me or what's going on?"
[31:44] and and he's he's just joking around,
[31:46] but he
[31:48] understands not because of me, but he
[31:50] understand that there is a God
[31:54] that there is some kind of
[31:56] blessing, some kind of blessing behind
[31:59] the children of God. And if he could
[32:02] only understand that he could receive
[32:04] that blessing also, that he's not only
[32:07] getting an outward anointing or outward
[32:10] blessing, but he could step into that
[32:14] That's what we're doing every single day
[32:16] when we go out into the
[32:19] world. Nothing
[32:21] changed. And and God, he positionally
[32:24] placed David right there at the favor of
[32:28] Saul. And there, that's when the evil
[32:32] spirit just grew and grew and grew and
[32:36] just wanted to take over because he
[32:39] understood how blessed this man was.
[32:40] everywhere he
[32:42] went. Everywhere he went, Saul slaying
[32:45] his hundreds and David his hundreds of
[32:49] thousands. And he he started to
[32:51] understand like, man, I I do not want
[32:53] this guy because I think he caught the
[32:56] revelation. I think he understood that
[32:59] this man is going to take my place if I
[33:01] don't out of the scene.
[33:04] He's going to stand in
[33:06] mystead. What did he begin to do? He he
[33:08] tried to murder him. He tried to take
[33:10] him out of the scene and there was this
[33:13] this u back and forth of no I love you
[33:16] but I hate you and I love you but I hate
[33:18] you and and David finally had to leave
[33:22] because it was getting too
[33:24] dangerous and there he finds
[33:27] himself hiding in caves. Now think about
[33:31] it. Anointed by
[33:34] God to be king hiding in caves. Now this
[33:40] didn't happen over years. I mean over
[33:42] months. This happened they they say
[33:45] approximately 13
[33:47] years he was hiding and acting as a
[33:51] fugitive.
[33:53] I started to think about that and man
[33:56] that revelation that the prophet gave
[33:58] the the
[34:00] bride when the se came up and he says I
[34:03] no more call you the church you're the
[34:05] bride.
[34:06] I truly believe that name change wasn't
[34:09] the anointing upon them saying I what
[34:13] have I I have done is I've set you
[34:16] apart now it was 63 it's about almost
[34:20] around 62
[34:22] years
[34:24] anointed going around place to
[34:28] place preaching the
[34:31] word the the world doesn't care any any
[34:34] bit they're reection ing this there.
[34:38] There's an outward
[34:39] hatred towards
[34:43] this. When we think of blessing, we
[34:46] don't usually think of see a picture of
[34:48] someone hiding in caves, sleeping in the
[34:51] wilderness, or constantly fleeing from
[34:54] their life. But that's where we find
[34:58] David. That's exactly where he was at.
[35:02] Yet he was anointed and he was
[35:05] blessed. Brother Brandham, he continues
[35:08] on in paragraph 90 and why little
[35:11] bethlehem. He says, "Another great event
[35:14] that I wouldn't forget to call." That
[35:17] was when David was in the worst time
[35:20] when he was a
[35:22] fugitive. He already been
[35:24] anointed. He knowed what he was to be.
[35:28] He was to be king. God said so.
[35:32] And yet he was
[35:34] hated standing in between two deep
[35:37] fires. Here with the Philistines on one
[35:40] side after him. Here was Saul on the
[35:43] other
[35:44] side. And he was a man without a
[35:47] nation just as the church stands today.
[35:51] The true living church of God without a
[35:54] denomination or anything else. She
[35:57] stands alone. But yet she had the
[36:01] anointing poured on her. She knows what
[36:05] she what she is. Praise God.
[36:10] The anointed bride surrounded just as
[36:13] David was. But her identity comes from
[36:17] the anointing and not the approval of
[36:19] men, not by outward blessings.
[36:24] That's that's where we can say that
[36:26] happy are we that we are reviled. Happy
[36:30] are we. Why? Because the spirit of God
[36:32] rests upon
[36:34] us. My blessing, my my joy, everything
[36:38] that I am does not consist of these
[36:41] outward things. These things, they're
[36:44] good. We need them. And and and the
[36:47] Bible says, "Continue to work."
[36:51] Jesus told told um uh when he was giving
[36:54] that parable it said occupy till I come.
[36:58] So there there is a working and there
[37:00] there's something that we have to do
[37:02] before the fullness or the climax of his
[37:06] coming. There's things that we have to
[37:08] do
[37:09] yet he's here now
[37:13] that his imminence is here. His presence
[37:16] is
[37:17] here. And and and because of that, we we
[37:20] are waiting and we are working and we
[37:22] are preparing ourselves for that
[37:25] beautiful climax where the dead in
[37:27] Christ shall raise once
[37:29] more. And that what will that be? That
[37:32] will be our crowning.
[37:34] That be will be the fullness of our
[37:37] glory.
[37:39] The crown always represents the
[37:42] glory. And one day we will be fully
[37:45] glorified with Jesus Christ,
[37:48] seeing him face to face. Now, that would
[37:51] be a beautiful thing to see Christ face
[37:53] to face.
[37:55] It's amazing to to know that he's here
[37:59] yet there's a thirst to see him,
[38:02] that he's here
[38:04] fully, not just like he was in other
[38:07] ages, not like he he was. He's here
[38:09] because he's already poured out his
[38:12] spirit spirit. That's what I I like
[38:14] about the that word. I believe
[38:15] it's pouring out. It means if if I drop
[38:20] this, this is pouring out. I'm going to
[38:22] drop it. But whenever you get a a bottle
[38:25] of water, you begin to pour out. It it
[38:29] begins to come out
[38:31] gradually. It begins to descend down.
[38:35] And the Bible says that he will descend.
[38:37] And he is coming and he is here at the
[38:40] same time.
[38:44] That's where we stand. Anointed. Brother
[38:47] Brandham, he
[38:49] says his um his messiahic anointed ones
[38:55] believe that. What is
[38:57] Messiah? What is the Messiah? The
[39:00] Messiah is anointed one. And now if he
[39:04] was the Messiah being the anointed one
[39:08] for this day for um for that day to
[39:11] fulfill the word of God to be redeemer
[39:14] and to be the anointed one and God
[39:16] raised up that body his bride is the
[39:20] anointed one for this day. It's already
[39:23] raised with him in the resurrection
[39:26] because these two are one.
[39:29] We're not just following Christ. That's
[39:31] the amazing thing. We're just not
[39:33] following him. We're just not feeling an
[39:36] anointing. We are partakers.
[39:39] We're partakers of his anointing.
[39:43] I was um continuing to study while I was
[39:46] studying this that about the imminence
[39:50] and the imminent and the uh
[39:52] transcendent. Well, there's these two
[39:54] words that sound exactly the same.
[39:58] Imminent return of Christ means we're
[40:01] expecting that he is going to come but
[40:05] we are expecting or there's an imminent
[40:07] return of the imminent
[40:10] God that that now we are not just
[40:13] feeling an anointing but he's here
[40:18] today. Brother Brandham, he continues
[40:20] and he
[40:21] says, "How was it that
[40:26] day Satan took took him on a high
[40:29] mountain and said, if thou be the son of
[40:31] God, fall down and worship me. I give
[40:34] you all these kingdoms, they are mine. I
[40:37] do with them whatever I want to. I'll
[40:39] give them to you if you just worship
[40:42] me." Jesus knowing that they will fall
[40:45] heir to him in the millennium, he said,
[40:47] "Get thee behind me, Satan, for it is
[40:50] written, for thou shalt worship thy God,
[40:53] and him only thou shalt serve." Satan
[40:56] got in the back of
[40:58] him. Brothers,
[41:01] sisters, we're we're fugitives. We feel
[41:05] like the world is against us. Yet, we
[41:08] have to understand that God has given us
[41:11] a special blessing. if you'd like to
[41:13] stand with to your
[41:16] feet that whenever we say I am
[41:20] blessed we should think of it deeper
[41:24] instead of whenever we get a new car or
[41:26] we get something and say oh man I'm so
[41:27] blessed but one day it's going to break
[41:29] down because in reality all those aren't
[41:32] true blessings all those things those
[41:35] are given and they're taken away the
[41:37] true blessing of God is his Holy Spirit
[41:40] in his people. Let us bow our
[41:44] heads. Heavenly
[41:46] Father, Lord, I just ask
[41:50] that you continue to work in each and
[41:53] every person here.
[41:55] Father, that though it's the middle of
[41:58] the week
[42:00] and some most of us have to go to work
[42:03] and continue on with the
[42:05] week, yet
[42:08] Lord, you have set us apart.
[42:12] Father, we can be part of yet we are
[42:15] still set apart from all of these
[42:18] things, from our daily work and our
[42:20] daily struggles and all of these things,
[42:23] Lord. And I just ask that you just
[42:25] continue to give us a deeper revelation
[42:27] of who we are,
[42:30] Father, and how you've called
[42:33] us. and that this this is not just a
[42:36] regular Christian life, Father, but this
[42:39] is something much
[42:41] deeper that you want to show us who you
[42:44] truly are and so that we can change
[42:47] because by this word, by this word that
[42:49] has already been given, not some other
[42:52] word, not some other thing. This that
[42:54] has already been given is going to
[42:56] change us to who you are.
[42:59] Lord, I ask Father that you just bless
[43:02] each and every person,
[43:04] Father. Whatever things that they're
[43:06] going through,
[43:09] Father, whatever
[43:11] struggles humanly, Father, sometimes
[43:14] it's just so easy to look at the
[43:16] circumstances, Father. So easy just to
[43:19] go back to regular
[43:22] life. But Father, I ask Lord that you
[43:25] just refresh that anointing, refresh
[43:28] that that remembrance to them, Lord, of
[43:31] who they
[43:33] are. And by remembering and
[43:35] understanding who they are, they may act
[43:38] accordingly, Father, they may believe
[43:42] accordingly. We thank you, Jesus. The
[43:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
