[0:00] so my title tonight is very
[0:01] straightforward game over
[0:03] and that might be attention grabbing for
[0:05] some one brother saw it and told me that
[0:07] this is probably a little bit of a shot
[0:10] to all the kids who've had their devices
[0:11] taken away from them over the last few
[0:13] weeks but I did not mean that at all it
[0:16] kind of slipped right by me but if it
[0:18] kind of rubs it in a little bit maybe
[0:20] you just needed that and maybe it's uh
[0:23] not kids eat free today but kids eat a
[0:25] spoonful of gravel but the the title is
[0:29] game over I don't know if you could tell
[0:30] it by the subtitle underneath this or
[0:32] just the tagline we included in this is
[0:34] it is ending the blame game
[0:37] and originally my title was the blame
[0:39] game but I just rather put in this
[0:41] context game over putting the end to the
[0:44] blame game and in looking at that I
[0:46] could say this maybe as a thesis
[0:48] statement it's about taking
[0:49] responsibility taking responsibility for
[0:52] our actions and just how much power is
[0:55] in taking responsibility and there's a
[0:58] lot of things in our lives that are
[0:59] beyond our control there's a lot of
[1:01] things that happen to us and we're very
[1:02] quick to recognize I had nothing to do
[1:04] with this
[1:05] but when we can take responsibility for
[1:08] ourselves and we can take responsibility
[1:10] for our families and our own decisions
[1:11] and our own conditions and even our own
[1:13] mistakes it's very empowering it might
[1:16] not seem so and I think it works against
[1:17] our human nature but I want to look at
[1:20] taking responsibility because there's a
[1:22] power in doing that that breaks us out
[1:24] of a lot of mindsets that debilitate us
[1:27] and weaken us and kind of self-defeating
[1:30] is the phrase I believe I want to use is
[1:31] there's a self-defeating mentality that
[1:34] we feel that we're doing ourselves a
[1:35] favor by blaming but we're actually
[1:38] making it worse and bringing ourselves
[1:40] into a very negative cycle so tonight
[1:42] game over
[1:43] the end to the blame game now just pick
[1:45] up right where we were in verse nine as
[1:47] we've already seen that man was tempted
[1:49] the woman was tempted participation
[1:51] continues to demand Adam and the woman
[1:54] have fallen they've come up with their
[1:56] ways of addressing their fallen nature
[1:58] and now comes the moment when they're
[2:00] going to answer to God and he says in
[2:02] the Lord God called into Adam and said
[2:03] unto him where art thou and he said I
[2:06] heard the voice in the garden and I was
[2:08] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[2:10] myself and he said who told you
[2:13] I guess we could have read verse eight
[2:15] but we just skipped over that part where
[2:17] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[2:18] walking in the garden and they were uh
[2:20] and they hid themselves amongst the
[2:21] trees if I we read that good he says I
[2:23] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[2:25] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[2:26] myself and now God says who told thee
[2:30] that thou was naked hast thou Adam
[2:32] points his finger at the woman and then
[2:34] he says what is this thou has done and
[2:36] the woman said Adam points his finger at
[2:37] the woman and then he says what is this
[2:39] thou has done and the woman said the
[2:41] serpent beguiled yep I did exactly what
[2:44] you asked him not to do but his answer
[2:45] is the woman that you gave me she gave
[2:48] it to me and I did to verbalize what's
[2:50] taking place Adam says I was afraid and
[2:52] I hid I was like well what have you done
[2:54] and the very first thing they do and I
[2:56] want to look at it as one of the first
[2:57] characteristics of their broken nature
[2:58] was to say she did it
[3:01] and then she's like he did it and points
[3:05] to the serpent and we know that God
[3:07] despite where the fingers were placed in
[3:09] verse 14 he begins to curse The Serpent
[3:11] and there's judgment but this was the
[3:14] ACT Adam blamed the woman the woman
[3:17] blamed the serpent and to kind of give
[3:21] us kind of Grease the skids a little bit
[3:23] and get our minds thinking on what's
[3:24] been burdened me on the subject over the
[3:26] last few weeks it's an act or expression
[3:29] of disapproval
[3:30] that's what a noun blame would be an act
[3:33] of disapproval or it would be the
[3:35] responsibility for something that is
[3:37] wrong or done wrong you accept the blame
[3:40] or you place blame it's an act of
[3:42] expressing disapproval or kind of the
[3:45] responsibility for something that is
[3:46] wrong we used it as a verb where Adam
[3:49] blamed the woman it's place and
[3:51] responsibility on somebody for something
[3:52] that you deem wrong if somebody bakes a
[3:56] really really good cake you don't blame
[3:57] them for it right so it kind of blamed
[4:00] carries with it this negative
[4:02] connotation who's done this and are you
[4:04] looking someone to blame and when it's
[4:06] good you're looking to compliment you're
[4:07] looking to express something so blame
[4:10] kind of carries with it a wrong blame
[4:12] means if you blame someone it means to
[4:13] find fault with them and we'll write
[4:15] we'll kind of touch on what fault means
[4:17] here in a moment
[4:18] now I I share this and I hope that this
[4:21] could strike you
[4:23] as adding some kind of layers or some
[4:26] depth to this but to use the verb blame
[4:28] if I blame you it's a rebuke
[4:31] the word means and it's the richness in
[4:33] its original meaning and of these other
[4:35] languages it means to condemn or to
[4:37] criticize
[4:38] and the Very if you want to say the
[4:40] etymology of the word or just the the
[4:42] conjugation of it and what builds it in
[4:44] its prefixes and suffix the suffix of it
[4:47] in the blame it's the opposite of praise
[4:50] there's something just something that
[4:52] just struck me and I just meditated on
[4:53] for some time it's supposed to blame is
[4:56] the opposite of praising someone to
[4:58] blame is the opposite of commending
[5:00] someone so if you just looked at it
[5:01] logically that if something bad happens
[5:03] you blame someone if something good
[5:05] happens to you praise them or give them
[5:07] credit and so blame kind of is the
[5:09] opposite of encouraging somebody blame
[5:12] does the opposite of inspiring somebody
[5:14] and I want you to think about that that
[5:16] that's what blame does is it does more
[5:18] to kind of tear down and more to harm
[5:21] someone just in its word because when
[5:24] you praise someone that does something
[5:25] to encourage one but when you blame
[5:27] that's a discouragement
[5:29] I think that's a good important very
[5:31] important and very good point to
[5:33] consider as we talk about the blame game
[5:36] now enrollment so as we've looked at the
[5:39] failure of the man and the woman in
[5:40] Romans chapter 5 verse 14 speaks this
[5:43] and we're just kind of grabbing a truth
[5:45] from this nevertheless death reigned
[5:47] from Adam to Moses even over them that
[5:50] had not sinned after the similitude of
[5:52] Adam's transgression who is in the
[5:55] figure of him that was to come so it's
[5:57] Adam's transgression Adam sinned Adam he
[6:01] made a mistake and though we can kind of
[6:03] delineate where his mistake was and what
[6:06] he did and how he fell and what he was
[6:08] knowledgeable of and what his act was if
[6:11] we could put it this way Adam's
[6:12] transgression the phrase suggests that
[6:14] he bore some responsibility
[6:17] and so Adam was responsible despite his
[6:20] instinct to blame the woman
[6:22] When God Says did you eat of the tree in
[6:24] the Garden of Eden or this God this tree
[6:26] that I told you not to eat of Adam
[6:28] answering truthfully could have just
[6:30] simply said yes I did but rather he says
[6:33] uh this woman that you gave me and and
[6:36] notice how
[6:37] he's not even totally Shifting the blame
[6:39] on the woman right
[6:41] this woman that I don't know if you
[6:43] forgot you gave me
[6:46] that's that's interesting he shift
[6:49] wanted to shift the blame to the woman
[6:50] but in case there's any question whether
[6:53] or not Adam was responsible he's like
[6:54] now you you're the one that gave her to
[6:56] me like when I was when it was just this
[6:58] we were doing fine but when you wanted
[7:00] to put me to sleep and take her out now
[7:02] that she stands there and she can be
[7:04] tempted now I've fallen because you've
[7:06] done this and it's a way of Shifting the
[7:08] blame and if I could say this he had
[7:10] every reason just to own it
[7:13] every reason to say yes I did it
[7:17] in verse 12 he could have just said
[7:18] instead of saying the woman that thou
[7:19] gave us to me he could have said yes I
[7:22] did it
[7:23] but instead he shifts it
[7:25] First Timothy chapter 2 verse 14 it says
[7:28] and Adam was not deceived so kind of
[7:30] give some color to his action brother
[7:32] Branham in one place says she was a part
[7:34] of him and he was willing to take her
[7:37] responsibility upon himself
[7:39] So Adam had already acted in a
[7:42] responsible way brother but I'm
[7:43] characterizing the act that Abraham did
[7:45] it's so beautiful as Romans 5 14 is
[7:47] pointing to it that Adam even in his
[7:49] sinning was a figure of Christ who was
[7:51] to come who would become our sins so he
[7:54] could have taken responsibility but it
[7:56] what a beautiful picture he would have
[7:58] painted of how that Christ bore took
[8:00] responsibility for our own sins but yet
[8:02] any when he verbalized it brother said
[8:04] when he acted he was taking
[8:06] responsibility for the woman but now
[8:08] when answering for it he shifts a little
[8:09] bit
[8:10] but now it says Adam was not deceived
[8:12] but the woman being deceived was in the
[8:15] transgression guess what the Bible says
[8:17] Adam transgressed the Bible says the
[8:19] woman was responsible as well so neither
[8:22] one of them could we build the
[8:23] scriptural case to say that they had no
[8:25] reason to admit culpability or they just
[8:27] they were one of them was innocent one
[8:29] of them had been duped uh 100 completely
[8:32] and they shared no blame but despite her
[8:35] instinct to pass the blame to the
[8:37] serpent she was responsible
[8:40] and she knew she was at fault
[8:43] but she passed it on
[8:45] and in each one of these instances maybe
[8:47] we could ask we're looking at this scene
[8:49] the Temptation and the fall and before
[8:51] we get into the Judgment when there's
[8:53] judgment if we looked at it from a legal
[8:54] perspective they're trying to affix
[8:56] liability for one who's acted in a civil
[8:59] context they can actually say you're 40
[9:01] to blame you're 60 precipit to blame and
[9:04] they can kind of divide liability if
[9:06] injuries were a certain amount and
[9:07] you're proportionally liable you can
[9:09] they can reduce the amount you would owe
[9:11] according to what they felt you were
[9:13] responsible for and who's to blame you
[9:15] may be speeding through a green light
[9:17] and somebody may run the red light and
[9:19] they could say you know what but for
[9:20] your speeding you're partially liable
[9:22] and the person who ran the red light
[9:23] they're also liable so when we look at
[9:25] the situation we're saying well who's at
[9:27] fault
[9:28] fault is a shortcoming or failure the
[9:31] word even suggests some sort of opening
[9:33] or Gap where something is left undone
[9:36] and and there's a fault like you think
[9:37] of a fisture or a break in something
[9:39] it's a flaw it's a deficiency there's
[9:42] some sort of lacking so when we say
[9:43] fault it's really broad that we could
[9:46] bring ourselves uh who's at fault who
[9:48] did something wrong who left something
[9:49] undone who did the shortcoming who
[9:51] failed in these situations who's to
[9:53] blame
[9:55] who would we blame in this as Adam said
[9:57] it's the woman that thou gave us me do
[9:59] we just kind of back all the way up and
[10:00] say wow let's just go ahead and blame
[10:02] God or do we say well it was the devil
[10:03] who used the serpent we're looking at
[10:05] who's responsible for the ACT who who
[10:08] should bear the consequences for what
[10:10] was done and that's what we read in the
[10:12] preceding verses
[10:16] yeah
[10:17] and what we're what we're describing
[10:20] is the blame game
[10:23] and it was sometime last year
[10:26] that I heard this phrase I remember if
[10:29] you want to show that
[10:31] uh I was going to use the all your base
[10:33] are belong to us for this
[10:35] uh but it says I'm not saying it's your
[10:39] fault
[10:40] I'm saying I'm blaming you
[10:43] and just really stuck with me and this
[10:45] was the beginning of
[10:47] and they and this this sermon that we're
[10:49] preaching tonight that I believe we'll
[10:51] just be able to finish tonight Lord
[10:52] willing and just stand on its own and I
[10:54] feel that this is a very important
[10:56] subject that we're expressing to you
[10:57] tonight and I would
[11:00] I would encourage you
[11:02] to hit that subscribe button no I would
[11:04] encourage you
[11:06] to share this with anybody who misses it
[11:08] that's part of our church because
[11:09] there's a chance there's some that would
[11:11] not hear this and I feel it's so
[11:13] important for us as a church to have
[11:14] this
[11:15] to understand this principle and have
[11:16] this Instinct that that when something
[11:19] goes wrong we're not quick to point the
[11:20] finger like Adam and when the finger
[11:22] gets pointed at us we're not quick to
[11:24] keep it going we're the kind of people
[11:25] says game over
[11:27] good man what happened let's fix it
[11:29] right and so I feel this is a very very
[11:32] important subject and it was this phrase
[11:34] I'm not saying it's your fault I'm
[11:37] saying I'm blaming you I think it just
[11:39] perfectly describes the mindset of
[11:41] people in the world today
[11:43] and it kind of carries with it the human
[11:45] nature to where there's my there might
[11:47] even be a part of us that says I know
[11:49] it's not your fault but I'm blaming you
[11:51] I know it wasn't your mistake I know it
[11:54] wasn't your deficiency I was I know it
[11:55] wasn't you that left the opening I know
[11:57] it's not you that had the lacking you're
[11:58] not the one with the blemish but yet I
[12:00] still need to blame somebody
[12:02] and that to me is what makes it a game
[12:04] almost is that there's it has its own
[12:07] set of rules uh that's kind of confined
[12:10] to this activity is the whole the whole
[12:12] objective and goal is to not be the one
[12:14] that's to blame so even if you're not at
[12:16] fault you blame somebody else or even if
[12:19] you are even if they're not at fault you
[12:20] blame them
[12:21] so if you want to have T-shirts printed
[12:23] I'm not saying it's your fault I'm
[12:25] saying I'm blaming you it would make for
[12:27] an interesting one
[12:28] there's one A friend of mine told me one
[12:30] time it was on the front or I think it
[12:31] just said on the front sometimes never
[12:33] sometimes regardless
[12:35] now chew on that for a while
[12:38] now as we've looked at the very first
[12:40] blame game I hope we've kind of
[12:42] introduced some things into our hearts
[12:43] tonight our minds as we think about it
[12:45] and fault in blame if we're using blame
[12:48] or fault and kind of using those
[12:49] interchangeably they really Center on
[12:51] responsibility
[12:52] and so though it would say I'm not
[12:54] saying it's your fault I said that I'm
[12:56] blaming you you know in some ways what's
[12:58] happening is since blame and fault
[13:01] relate to someone's responsibility to
[13:03] blame someone would be our effort to
[13:05] make someone accountable
[13:07] so something happens uh the the man eats
[13:10] of the in the analogy eats of the tree
[13:12] of the this fruit of the tree and now
[13:14] he's partaken in it and now as he's been
[13:17] called in the carpet did you do what I
[13:19] told you not to do he when he says the
[13:21] woman that thou gave us to me there's
[13:23] some sense in what he's doing he's
[13:24] trying to say you know what she's the
[13:26] one that should answer for this
[13:28] because the question was asked of him
[13:30] and by pointing the finger he's trying
[13:32] it's an effort to make the woman
[13:34] accountable
[13:35] and so we blame or find fault
[13:38] when someone is irresponsible
[13:41] and we do that because in the most
[13:44] innocent sense we want them to answer
[13:45] for it and so now I feel like I'm real
[13:47] deep into the teaching part of this
[13:49] we're trying to unpack this Blame Game
[13:51] and how it works that when somebody does
[13:54] something let's say that you're not even
[13:55] a participant you're an observer and you
[13:57] see that somebody does something and
[13:59] causes something and you're like oh my
[14:02] goodness look what they've done and
[14:03] someone says what's happened here you go
[14:05] he did it he did it it's the very action
[14:08] of saying well he should he should be
[14:10] responsible for that he he should have
[14:13] he should answer for what he's done so
[14:15] it's our attempt to get them to answer
[14:17] for something they've done
[14:18] now I I may have lost count and I don't
[14:21] know if I wrote it down here what it is
[14:22] so if I get the numbers wrong it's not
[14:24] an Easter egg I apologize I just got it
[14:27] wrong
[14:28] and it reminds me of a sermon brother
[14:30] Paula Fontaine preached one time where
[14:31] he called it three simple words and he
[14:34] kept using four over and over and over
[14:36] again
[14:37] Adam it's just three simple words just
[14:39] remember these simple words and just
[14:41] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[14:44] is
[14:48] but I want to go through some problems I
[14:50] think I maybe have six here just three
[14:52] simple problems six of them
[14:54] and and the first problem I identify
[14:57] with the blame game because now the
[14:59] instinct to blame someone is they need
[15:01] to answer for this but you know what
[15:02] people just instinctively resist
[15:04] accountability
[15:06] it's just wired in US
[15:08] that whenever and and it's just really
[15:11] really strong from a young age that
[15:13] whenever someone's did you did you know
[15:15] a kid could be one and a half years old
[15:17] and learned its first words it's got a
[15:19] paintbrush in their hand paint
[15:20] everywhere paint all over the wall it's
[15:22] like did you do that and they're like
[15:24] and they point to the dog right it's
[15:27] just hardwired and it works really good
[15:28] from the beginning that we just
[15:30] instinctively resist accountability now
[15:33] as we begin to become more adults or we
[15:35] are more adult-like and not just there
[15:37] in a diaper with the paintbrush our
[15:39] pride gets in the way and we don't like
[15:41] to be questioned about something when
[15:43] we've done something we don't like that
[15:45] we don't want to have to answer for it
[15:46] we don't like to be challenged why did
[15:48] you do this and explain yourself that's
[15:49] being answerable we by Nature resist
[15:52] that
[15:53] Genesis chapter 4 verse 9 just watch how
[15:56] quickly this is kind of nature filters
[15:58] into the children and the Lord said unto
[16:00] Cain after uh regarding Abel where is
[16:03] Abel thy brother and he said I know not
[16:05] am I My Brother's Keeper
[16:07] and what was this he resists the even
[16:09] the inference of responsibility
[16:12] like where's your brother and his first
[16:14] thing is instead of maybe feeling that
[16:16] if he's being asked do you even know
[16:18] where he is he feels that he's
[16:20] responsible for his whereabouts he says
[16:22] am I My Brother's Keeper
[16:24] the question doesn't even necessarily
[16:26] suggest that he knew or should have been
[16:28] responsible for that he was responsible
[16:30] for it but it shows when he says am I My
[16:33] Brother's Keeper it shows that he's not
[16:35] willing to be accountable he doesn't
[16:37] want to be questioned he doesn't want to
[16:39] have to answer
[16:42] and just as Adam showed it
[16:45] I think we're all very good at blaming
[16:48] but not very good at accepting
[16:50] responsibility
[16:52] in Romans chapter 9 verse 19 it says
[16:54] that will say then unto me why doth he
[16:56] yet find fault for who hath resisted his
[16:58] will Paul in talking about election Paul
[17:01] come up the sovereignty of God and how
[17:02] that he chooses and how he chooses by
[17:04] love he anticipates the objection
[17:07] and he just draws from Human Nature
[17:09] that's just gonna say Well then why does
[17:12] God blame me
[17:14] why does he find fault with me why
[17:16] should we be held accountable isn't God
[17:18] to blame
[17:20] Paul anticipates the objection and
[17:22] remember he doesn't even answer it
[17:23] because it's not even worth answering
[17:25] but it shows the nature of humanity not
[17:28] willing to accept responsibility quick
[17:30] to shift the blame why does he yet blame
[17:31] us why does he find fault with us who's
[17:33] resisted his will is it he to blame for
[17:36] the way that we are
[17:38] and so that's
[17:41] this is the problem with the blame game
[17:42] is we instinctively resist
[17:44] accountability
[17:46] or we just if I could put it this way
[17:48] maybe the more obvious but we just don't
[17:49] like to be blamed
[17:51] we're good at blaming but not very good
[17:53] at being blamed
[17:55] and so if I could kind of
[17:57] uh extend that a little bit and call it
[18:00] another problem
[18:01] this is problem number two if you're
[18:03] counting my words
[18:05] another problem with the blame game is
[18:06] it's an act of imposing accountability
[18:09] on another
[18:11] since we're trying to hold them
[18:13] accountable if someone's done something
[18:15] and acted in a way to where they've
[18:17] caused a problem and we say he did it he
[18:19] did it he has to answer by that by
[18:22] playing the blame game you're not only
[18:24] wanting to hold someone accountable and
[18:25] they instinctively resist it you're
[18:27] doing it against their will
[18:29] because the it's an act of imposing
[18:31] answer ability on someone
[18:34] if we place the blame it's the act of
[18:36] identifying someone that we think is
[18:38] responsible for a fault someone who's
[18:40] responsible for a wrong
[18:42] and if the person's unwilling to be
[18:44] accountable
[18:46] a blame usually only provokes a defense
[18:49] so this is the problem with it that
[18:51] unless they unless they have are willing
[18:53] to be held accountable once you blame
[18:56] them you're not going to get them to say
[18:58] sorry I did it it's usually you gave me
[19:01] the woman
[19:03] it was a serpent that Did It My
[19:06] Brother's Keeper so if someone is not
[19:08] willing to make themselves accountable
[19:10] it's only going to be an instinct to be
[19:12] self-defense to be uh to be defensive I
[19:15] tell you I don't know all the ninjutsus
[19:18] and all the other things out there the
[19:20] MMA levels but we've all got a black
[19:23] belt in self-defense
[19:26] right because as soon as somebody as
[19:28] soon as somebody we just we just sense
[19:30] it
[19:32] I didn't do that right because our
[19:35] self-defenses are just so strong that we
[19:37] just instinctively it's just a reflex
[19:40] before they could even get out no uh I
[19:43] didn't do that
[19:44] walked right and we take care of it real
[19:47] quick because nothing's going to touch
[19:48] us
[19:49] and it were just really really good at
[19:52] this instinctively not being held
[19:55] accountable
[19:56] because if we haven't asked for it we
[19:58] feel that it's kind of been uh pushed on
[20:00] us
[20:01] I had a friend one time that says uh
[20:05] it was unsolicited or UNS an unsolicited
[20:08] advice is criticism in another form
[20:13] they just didn't want to be accountable
[20:17] but there's a truth to it because that's
[20:19] how you're going to take it
[20:21] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 21 it says
[20:23] submitting yourselves one to another in
[20:25] the fear of God there is a lot that can
[20:27] be said about accountability I'm kind of
[20:29] carving this out just as a little part
[20:31] of the blame game
[20:33] but when it says to submit ourselves to
[20:34] one another in the fear of God
[20:36] the word submitting speaks of arranging
[20:39] ourselves not necessarily underneath
[20:41] somebody but it's arranging ourselves to
[20:43] one another
[20:45] that if we submit ourselves one to
[20:47] another you tell me who's submitting and
[20:49] who's not
[20:50] if I've submitted to you and you've
[20:52] submitted to me who do you say is the
[20:53] who's the most powerful
[20:55] who's the one to under subjection we've
[20:57] submitted to each other we've leveled it
[21:00] so it's not so much trying to put
[21:01] someone on top and someone on bottom and
[21:03] someone in power and someone in a
[21:04] position of weakness if we submit
[21:06] ourselves one to another
[21:07] the phrase is suggesting that we're
[21:09] arranging ourselves to one another in
[21:11] relationship
[21:13] and that it's a voluntary the word
[21:15] submitting ourselves one to another it
[21:16] means a voluntary attitude of
[21:18] cooperation
[21:19] it is it's a giving in it's assuming
[21:22] responsibility that I'm going to assume
[21:24] responsibility I'm going to answer to
[21:26] you and I and you're I'm willing to
[21:28] answer to you and it's this Mutual
[21:29] accountability in this Mutual dependency
[21:31] where we're going to mutually carry a
[21:33] burden I'll answer for myself your
[21:35] answer for yourselves okay let's submit
[21:37] ourselves one to another
[21:38] and to submit one to another it means to
[21:41] yield to one's admonition or advice so
[21:44] it in that way you just take care of the
[21:46] fact that it's unsolicited advice you're
[21:47] saying I'm willing to hear I'm willing
[21:49] to listen that's what it means to submit
[21:50] one to another
[21:51] to submit to someone it means you're
[21:53] making yourself subject to answer to
[21:55] someone
[21:57] and so if someone is not willing to
[21:58] submit to another person and you blame
[22:00] them the only thing you're going to do
[22:02] is provoke the defense
[22:04] because they haven't they haven't been
[22:06] submitted to you they're not cooperating
[22:07] with you they haven't put themselves in
[22:09] a position to be made answerable to you
[22:12] and let me say this uh just a connection
[22:15] to somebody or a relation to ship to
[22:18] somebody alone does not hold us
[22:19] accountable
[22:21] you can say well brother Aaron's the
[22:22] pastor so he's accountable to the Sheep
[22:25] you know I I I
[22:27] ought to be
[22:28] right and as the Bible teaches and the
[22:31] message teaches it and the Sheep
[22:32] accountable to the pastor it's so
[22:33] beautiful that when you recognize Mutual
[22:34] dependency is what avoids codependency
[22:37] and it's under the guise of codependency
[22:39] that sheep are abused pastors are abused
[22:43] because once it becomes a codependency
[22:44] that's when there's manipulation abuse
[22:46] and control and there and people are not
[22:49] didn't answer for their conduct and so
[22:52] the relationship alone does not hold us
[22:55] accountable we must within the context
[22:57] of the connection and relationship
[22:59] voluntarily submit to it
[23:02] it's one of the things that I've learned
[23:03] in studying the subject
[23:05] is that accountability should never be
[23:08] imposed by power
[23:10] so if someone ought to answer you could
[23:13] recognize they need to but you can never
[23:15] impose accountability by power
[23:16] accountability must be offered willingly
[23:19] and voluntarily
[23:21] so accountability is never imposed it's
[23:23] offered something that's yielded it's
[23:26] welcome through humility and so if we
[23:28] try to blame someone who hasn't welcomed
[23:31] the blame or hasn't welcomed the
[23:33] correction hasn't welcomed the the
[23:34] answer the accountability then we put
[23:37] them in that position where we're just
[23:38] trying to fix blame and once we do it we
[23:40] just cause them to instinctively be
[23:43] defensive
[23:44] but remember that about accountability
[23:46] if you want to be accountable
[23:48] then you have to voluntarily into
[23:50] humility offer it
[23:52] and I know we might have situations as
[23:54] adults where we want to hold people
[23:55] accountable and you may feel that you
[23:56] have the right because you're in
[23:58] relationship to them but what you what
[24:00] you would desire is that that person
[24:02] would offer it
[24:05] wouldn't work if all of a sudden I just
[24:07] picked up the phone and started calling
[24:09] people in the church and said I'm just
[24:10] going to hold you accountable on your
[24:12] desired detox
[24:14] and it would go ring ring and you'd pick
[24:16] it up and you'd be hello and you'd say
[24:18] excuse me
[24:20] it doesn't work that way does it has to
[24:22] be voluntarily offered I'm not
[24:24] interested in auditing that anyways
[24:27] now the third problem with the blame
[24:29] game
[24:32] I should have said second just to kind
[24:33] of get you guys
[24:35] the third problem with the blame game
[24:37] it's an is it's an act of
[24:38] self-justification
[24:41] and if I could put it this way and I
[24:43] think I think these things are real
[24:44] heavy principles tonight real real solid
[24:46] uh this is good good eating kids eat
[24:48] free and all there is a stake on the
[24:50] menu tonight
[24:51] even though it's very simple I think
[24:53] it's there's some heft to it there's
[24:54] some real good cow the caloric density
[24:56] is off the charts tonight
[24:59] when I say the Act of self-justification
[25:01] I hope that means enough to you that as
[25:03] we kind of Amplified a little bit for a
[25:05] few moments
[25:06] when we blame someone we're often
[25:09] often when blame we blaming others it's
[25:12] more of an active excuse in ourselves
[25:14] it's not so much that we're accurately
[25:17] assessing blame on the appropriate
[25:19] person but when we blame others it's
[25:21] maybe more so that we're trying to
[25:23] excuse ourselves or we're making excuses
[25:25] for our mistakes Adam did it Adam could
[25:28] have said you know what I shouldn't have
[25:30] done it
[25:31] but I knew Lord that if if I didn't take
[25:33] her to myself and show some
[25:34] responsibility she would have died Adam
[25:37] more or less used by pointing the finger
[25:39] finger he was making an excuse as to why
[25:41] he did it
[25:43] and so if we're going to have willful
[25:44] personal accountability if we're going
[25:46] to voluntarily through humility take
[25:48] responsibility for our actions then then
[25:51] we've got to we've got to demonstrate
[25:53] that example first
[25:55] in fact I said but willful
[25:56] accountability is taking responsibility
[25:59] and it's and and it's it's showing
[26:01] ourselves as being I I'm gonna I'm
[26:03] willing to take accountability I'm
[26:04] willing to be held accountable and it
[26:05] affords a great example
[26:07] instead of just offering excuses the
[26:09] Bible says in Galatians 6 5 for every
[26:12] man shall bear his own burden remember
[26:14] how we look through this in verse two
[26:16] how bear you one another's burden but
[26:18] now in chapter verse five it's this
[26:20] burden which is a load or obligation
[26:21] one's own personal obligation speaks of
[26:24] a ship that's Laden down with Goods but
[26:27] these goods are marked for that ship and
[26:29] that ship is made to transport that so
[26:31] it's not the kind of Burden you say oh
[26:33] no they're loading the ship let me take
[26:34] some of this and put it on my ship it's
[26:36] like no Every Man Has to bear his own
[26:38] obligation notice we have to answer for
[26:40] ourselves
[26:42] we must answer for our load for our
[26:46] responsibility for obligation in not
[26:48] loaded up on somebody else because
[26:49] that's what verse two is saying bear you
[26:52] one another's burdens and in other words
[26:53] the number one rule of that would be
[26:55] carry your own and don't put on them
[26:56] your own
[26:57] don't put on them somebody else's
[27:00] so we must answer for ourselves and not
[27:02] this put this heaviness or this
[27:04] inappropriate weight on somebody else
[27:05] according to verse two
[27:07] and so black the blame game one of the
[27:10] problems with the blame game is it is
[27:12] evident that when someone blames
[27:14] somebody else they're usually not
[27:16] necessarily wanting to actually hold
[27:18] somebody truly and purely accountable
[27:20] but there's an element of excusing
[27:22] themselves with it
[27:24] and so throughout this I'm hoping maybe
[27:27] just to kind of look at the other side
[27:28] and say just focusing maybe at one time
[27:30] on the the positive side of not playing
[27:32] the blame game
[27:34] but if we're going to have willful
[27:37] humility or willful accountability
[27:39] through humility
[27:40] when others see our willingness to be
[27:42] accountable so if we're saying tonight
[27:44] game over
[27:45] I'm not going to play the game a blame
[27:47] game anymore if people see us being
[27:50] willing to be accountable it motivates
[27:52] them to be accountable
[27:54] and we can Inspire Inspire others in our
[27:56] relationships or others in our family to
[27:59] be accountable by accepting
[28:00] responsibility ourselves before placing
[28:02] the blame
[28:04] because we're only we're only affording
[28:05] them an example that and I wonder where
[28:08] e the woman got the nerve to blame the
[28:10] serpent she's sitting there going we're
[28:12] busted we're busted we're we're dead in
[28:14] the water there's no way we're getting
[28:15] out of this and and Adam says I didn't
[28:18] do it the woman you gave me she did it
[28:20] she's like I didn't think about that I
[28:23] knew I didn't know you could do that and
[28:25] maybe she's kind of smarting a little
[28:27] bit because she got blamed but she's
[28:28] like I don't like the fact that you
[28:29] threw me under the bus but I didn't know
[28:31] you could throw somebody under the bus
[28:32] so the serpent did it
[28:34] hey
[28:35] and so she learned she learned from Adam
[28:38] that oh you can you can blame it on
[28:40] somebody else and so if we said game
[28:43] over and we were willing to accept
[28:45] responsibility accept the blame it
[28:47] affords somebody else the example
[28:49] of accepting the blame and it motivates
[28:52] others to be accountable
[28:54] when others see that you hold yourself
[28:56] accountable it motivates them to be
[28:58] accountable
[29:01] in Matthew chapter 7 verses 1 to 5
[29:05] this is a real critical scripture this
[29:07] could have been my text and I think just
[29:10] reading through it just kind of
[29:12] adds to this it adds some more weight
[29:16] and some more Meats to the to the
[29:18] skeleton of this
[29:19] in Matthew chapter 7 verses one to five
[29:21] let's just work through this judge not
[29:23] that ye be not judged
[29:25] and so it's really uh talk it's really
[29:28] challenging us on our instinct to
[29:30] condemn somebody else and you know kind
[29:32] of draft a sentence he says for with
[29:34] what judgment ye judge ye shall be
[29:36] judged and what measure ye meet it shall
[29:39] be measured to you again so kind of
[29:41] however you want to judge somebody else
[29:43] you're going to get judged by
[29:45] he says and why now this is when it it I
[29:48] mean it escalates
[29:49] even further and why behold this thou
[29:51] the moat that is in thy brother's eye
[29:53] and we're all kind of thinking yeah I've
[29:54] noticed that little speck of straw there
[29:56] I've noticed that little sliver but
[29:58] consider it's not the beam that is a 909
[30:00] Jesus using this extravagant dramatic
[30:03] language to make a point or how about
[30:06] say to thy brother let me pull out the
[30:09] moat out of thine eye and behold a beam
[30:10] is in thine own eye
[30:12] and isn't that just like human nature to
[30:16] see something wrong in somebody else and
[30:18] perceive it as something that needs to
[30:20] be dealt with when we're not willing to
[30:22] deal with an even greater problem in
[30:24] ourselves and perhaps not even
[30:26] considering that the beam in my own eye
[30:29] is impairing my ability to appreciate
[30:32] the severity of the sliver in my
[30:34] brother's eye
[30:36] because Jesus says Thou hypocrite First
[30:38] cast out the beam out of their own eye
[30:40] and then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast
[30:42] out the moat out of thy brother's eye
[30:45] when he says judge not it's an act of
[30:47] offering an opinion concerning right or
[30:49] wrong you're making some sort of
[30:51] assessment whether someone's in the
[30:52] right or someone's in the wrong it's
[30:53] calling someone into question it is a it
[30:56] is a part you could say of a blame game
[30:59] you see the fault in someone else do you
[31:01] want them to answer for the fault you
[31:02] say well you need to address this you
[31:04] need to deal with this you've got the
[31:05] smoking right you've got this moment
[31:06] you're right and Jesus saying you know
[31:07] what you can see the fault in somebody
[31:09] else but you can't see your own
[31:11] I think we've mentioned this here before
[31:13] you've heard of the phrase the pot
[31:14] calling the kettle black
[31:16] and it wasn't that they're both black
[31:18] it's the pot seen Its Reflection In The
[31:20] Kettle
[31:21] because the kettle is is is reflecting
[31:25] the image of the pot and so that when
[31:27] someone says well that's just the pot
[31:28] calling the kettle black well it's not
[31:30] saying that the kettle's just as the
[31:32] same fault as the pot it's saying the
[31:33] pot has no idea that the air that it
[31:37] sees and the Blackness it sees in the
[31:39] cattle is actually not in the kettle
[31:40] it's in itself
[31:42] and aren't we all aren't we kind of
[31:44] instinctively able to see the bad in
[31:47] somebody else or project the bat in
[31:49] somebody else's actually our own bad
[31:50] like
[31:52] that girl is such a gossip let me tell
[31:54] you what she does
[31:55] hey
[31:57] and it's like the girl may never say a
[31:59] thing which you've projected your own
[32:01] gossip onto her through on weakness and
[32:04] complexes and and this could be in all
[32:07] sorts of ways it just doesn't have to be
[32:08] you know a guy talking about a girl girl
[32:10] a girl talking about a girl this pot
[32:12] calling the kettle black it's behold in
[32:14] its own blackness in the kettle and
[32:16] that's why Jesus calls it hypocrisy
[32:20] can't remember who said it but it's it's
[32:22] true enough
[32:25] well I guess who said it might cause you
[32:27] pause but I don't know who said it but
[32:28] so there's probably no such thing as a
[32:29] conscious hypocrite
[32:33] I've heard some people get close
[32:35] but there's probably no such thing as a
[32:37] conscious hypocrite they're convinced
[32:38] now they've got a problem they've got a
[32:41] problem shouldn't you address yours
[32:42] first no they've got a problem
[32:45] and this is at that heart this is at the
[32:47] core of the blame game
[32:50] that we're very quickly ready to see
[32:52] something a perceived weakness in
[32:54] somebody else that they're we're not
[32:55] willing to consider in ourselves
[32:57] so notice how remarkable the scripture
[33:00] is in Psalms 19 verses 12 to 13. who can
[33:03] understand his heirs
[33:05] what a question
[33:07] who can understand his mistakes who can
[33:09] understand his faults who can see him
[33:11] the Bible says every man is right his
[33:13] own eyes and the ways a man are clean in
[33:15] his own eyes and there's this this kind
[33:17] of this really robust means of
[33:19] self-justifying and well you know if I
[33:21] did it I mean is it kind of like well
[33:22] the steps of the good man are ordered of
[33:24] the Lord and you know this is
[33:25] predestinated and you know and things
[33:27] happen and they're just always willing
[33:28] to justify it I mean could you just
[33:31] imagine you know eichmann's over there
[33:33] going well look what it accomplished
[33:34] guys right prophecies fulfilled and
[33:36] that's the way some people act is they
[33:38] look at the results and they see the
[33:40] outcome and they see that God made it
[33:41] work out and they're willing to justify
[33:43] well that's why God did this and that's
[33:44] why God did this because they're always
[33:45] quick to justify themselves so when this
[33:48] question is who can understand his heirs
[33:50] who's willing to own them
[33:54] who can recognize him who can own them
[33:55] cleanse thou me from Secret faults
[34:00] Purge me of the unrecognized mistakes
[34:04] that I'm so quick to blame others for or
[34:08] for which I am that I unconsciously
[34:11] excuse
[34:12] cleanse me from Secret faults the
[34:15] unrecognized thing unrecognized things
[34:17] that I'm actually to blame for
[34:19] that maybe I blame on other people or I
[34:21] I just instinctively excuse or that I'm
[34:23] just merely unconscious of
[34:27] what honesty what introspection
[34:30] as the question is asked who can
[34:32] understand his errors and then the
[34:34] psalmist immediately says Lord cleanse
[34:36] me then
[34:38] and he says keep back by servant also
[34:40] from presumptuous sins
[34:42] it speaks of how we'll be innocent of
[34:44] the great transgression and they'll not
[34:46] have dominion over me but a presumptuous
[34:47] sin is a sin against the checks of
[34:50] conscience
[34:52] hold me back from the sins that are
[34:54] against knowledge
[34:56] now I just want to open the door and
[34:59] just point into the room
[35:01] where cognitive dissonance lives
[35:04] and I know enough tonight to not go
[35:05] there because from that moment on you
[35:07] all would exercise it to the very end
[35:10] but this this this part of our brains
[35:13] like we don't cognitive dissonance
[35:15] speaks of how we don't like it when we
[35:17] get uncomfortable
[35:19] and we don't like it when we have when
[35:21] we think something is true and we're
[35:23] confronted with evidence that we might
[35:26] begin to recognize that controverts what
[35:28] we're the opinion we already hold
[35:30] and that's called dissonance and so what
[35:32] we do is we just reject anything
[35:36] that makes us feel uncomfortable
[35:39] and so this is I believe what
[35:41] presumptuous sins is kind of touching on
[35:44] is how there's this check against your
[35:46] conscience
[35:48] and if I could put it this way knowledge
[35:50] without action only increases our sense
[35:52] of guilt
[35:54] when you know something and don't act
[35:55] accordingly or when you know something
[35:57] and act against it it only increases our
[35:59] guilt so the presumptuous sins these are
[36:01] the things where I'm acting against
[36:02] knowledge now David the psalmist just
[36:04] said you know Lord who can know his
[36:06] heirs Purge me of my secret faults for
[36:08] these things that I'm not aware of that
[36:10] I do that maybe I unconsciously blame on
[36:12] somebody else or I'm unconsciously
[36:14] excusing the things that I've been able
[36:15] to justify without even a thought but
[36:17] Lord even those ones that I know
[36:20] I shouldn't do but I just find myself
[36:23] saying it doesn't matter
[36:25] and coming up with excuses for it
[36:29] and because it's knowledge without
[36:31] action or acting against knowledge
[36:32] increases our guilt because cognitive
[36:34] dissonance is such an uncomfortable
[36:35] feeling we're quick to shift the blame
[36:37] and excuse our conduct
[36:39] I'm going to read a statement from a
[36:40] book that I read years ago as fallible
[36:42] human beings all of us share the impulse
[36:45] to justify ourselves and avoid taking
[36:47] responsibility for any actions that
[36:49] turned out to be harmful immoral or
[36:52] stupid
[36:55] I don't know why I said stupid so
[36:57] aggressively I think it's the the
[36:59] drywall dust
[37:01] my lisp is in 100 full active mode too
[37:05] they
[37:06] if you could think about that
[37:08] how we all share the impulse to justify
[37:11] ourselves and avoid taking
[37:13] responsibility when something is harmful
[37:14] immoral or just wrong or strong-headed
[37:17] or wrong
[37:18] and and the statement that's made in
[37:20] this book is how do you get a moral man
[37:22] to lose his moral compass and I'm kind
[37:24] of rephrasing it it says just let him
[37:26] make one mistake and self-justification
[37:28] will do the rest
[37:29] isn't that shocking
[37:31] that if you want to see someone lose
[37:33] their integrity lose their testimony
[37:35] find themselves falling in in Scandal
[37:38] all it takes for a good man to lose his
[37:41] way is one mistake in self-justification
[37:45] he says most of us will never be in the
[37:47] position to make decisions affecting
[37:49] lives and deaths of millions of people
[37:51] but whether the consequences of our
[37:53] mistakes are trivial or tragic listen to
[37:56] this on a small scale or a national
[37:59] canvas most of us find it difficult if
[38:02] not impossible
[38:04] this is why presidents can't own it but
[38:07] this is also why children stay far away
[38:09] from accepting it it's impossible
[38:14] difficult if not impossible to say I was
[38:16] wrong
[38:17] I made a terrible mistake
[38:22] the higher the stakes emotional
[38:25] so the higher the stakes would be
[38:26] emotional Financial moral the greater
[38:29] the difficulty
[38:31] the higher the stakes in other words
[38:33] when accountability is the most
[38:35] necessary
[38:36] when someone needs to answer we need to
[38:38] figure this out we've got an issue here
[38:40] someone is to blame something's amiss
[38:43] the higher the stakes the harder it is
[38:45] to say I'm sorry I was wrong I made a
[38:48] terrible mistake it says it goes further
[38:50] than that
[38:51] most people when directly confronted by
[38:53] evidence that they're wrong do not
[38:55] change their point of view or course of
[38:57] action but justify even more tenaciously
[39:01] just think of the
[39:03] tens of millions of people today when
[39:04] they found out that fox settled the
[39:06] defamation suit the Dominion filed
[39:07] against them and admitted to the tune of
[39:09] almost a billion dollars that they lied
[39:11] about the election lines
[39:13] think of how many people begin to engage
[39:15] in cognitive distancing now I know the
[39:17] truth
[39:20] they'll justify even more tenaciously
[39:23] even irrefutable evidence is rarely
[39:26] enough to pierce catch this phrase
[39:27] because I'm coming back to it the mental
[39:29] armor of self-justification
[39:33] this is why we act in the blame game
[39:36] the Bible told us in Matthew chapter 7
[39:38] the Instinct of human nature
[39:40] it offers us some sort of solution with
[39:42] this attitude of who could understand
[39:43] his heirs we can't understand our heirs
[39:45] our prayer ought to be Lord cleanse me
[39:47] from all these secret faults where I I I
[39:49] am to blame but I don't know it I am to
[39:51] blame but I excuse it and Lord even
[39:53] worse cleanse me Purge me keep me from
[39:55] these presumptuous sins when I act
[39:58] against my knowledge because all I'm
[39:59] going to do is start justifying why I
[40:02] did
[40:03] and it creates a mental armor
[40:06] if I could continue in this it's human
[40:08] nature I think what this is drawing on
[40:10] it's human nature to take credit for
[40:11] success
[40:12] right that's why when you read something
[40:14] about your the meaning of your name or
[40:16] how they say now it's just not what your
[40:18] name means does it have hard D's in it
[40:20] or does it have a sound or does it have
[40:22] a sound and it all has meaning right so
[40:25] when we read it and like oh oh I don't
[40:28] agree with that but like you read a
[40:29] little bit further but I agree with that
[40:31] it's the same person it's the same
[40:33] theology it's the same idea we're just
[40:35] it's human nature to take credit for
[40:37] Success you know it's a tribute the
[40:40] success of something to our efforts
[40:43] but just as strongly
[40:46] we explain away our failures
[40:50] self-justification takes credit for the
[40:52] good actions but makes excuses for the
[40:54] bad actions
[40:56] and so this is the fourth I mean the
[40:58] second problem
[41:01] with the blame game
[41:05] usually when we blame someone we blame
[41:07] the person who's not there
[41:09] and so we often implicate the innocent
[41:11] or the voiceless the ones who don't have
[41:13] a voice the ones that don't have a say
[41:14] the one that can't say anything
[41:16] when we excuse ourselves and let me say
[41:18] this with absolutely if you are 100 to
[41:22] blame and you blame somebody else
[41:24] the innocent are blamed
[41:27] if you shift the blame to somebody who
[41:30] maybe is partially being but you're
[41:31] fully to blame and maybe we do it to
[41:33] someone who's not there right whenever
[41:35] we're in school and we have a group
[41:36] assignment it's the person who didn't
[41:37] show up who tanked the group
[41:39] Michael I sure wish Teddy was here
[41:41] because he blew it right and you're
[41:43] quick to blame someone who's not there
[41:45] the Dutch have a proverb the absent
[41:47] always Bears the blame
[41:49] because it's just human nature
[41:51] and so when we are in a position where
[41:54] we ought to be accountable for our
[41:55] actions and we shift the blame and we
[41:57] deflect it oftentimes we're doing it to
[41:59] the weaker which Adam could have
[42:00] definitely be characterized as saying
[42:01] hey he pointed his finger at his wife
[42:04] but is she not the one that was deceived
[42:06] is she not the one that should have had
[42:07] his empathy is he is she not the one
[42:09] that he could have said you know what
[42:11] this woman that you gave me I had the
[42:13] responsibility over her
[42:15] I made a terrible mistake I'm sorry
[42:18] but through our Shifting the blame and
[42:20] the blame game it's often the absent the
[42:22] voiceless
[42:23] or the weak or the innocent that get the
[42:25] blame
[42:26] but let me say this I should say this
[42:29] about Christians
[42:31] that as Christians
[42:34] and as a people of Integrity we ought to
[42:36] take more share of the blame and much
[42:37] less share of the credit
[42:41] that if something is done well
[42:43] and there's credit to be given for it as
[42:46] a Christian let somebody else share the
[42:48] credit unless somebody else have the
[42:51] credit and if something's wrong we ought
[42:53] to as Christians take more share of the
[42:55] blame than we are willing to take care
[42:57] of the credit and let me just say that
[42:59] this this is the kind of Mark that
[43:00] fathers could have in their home this is
[43:02] the kind of Mark that we could have for
[43:04] the brothers here there's so many uh
[43:05] Brothers here that excel in leadership
[43:07] and have very weighty important
[43:10] positions within their their Industries
[43:12] let me say if you don't already put this
[43:14] in practice a great leader shares more
[43:16] of the blame and much less of the credit
[43:21] brother random in the sermon my new
[43:23] ministry he says you don't have to be
[43:24] rich and mighty in this world I was
[43:26] going to use this at the very end I just
[43:27] felt compelled to put it right here
[43:29] in what should have been the end based
[43:31] upon time but he says so you don't have
[43:32] to be rich and mighty in this world to
[43:34] be great in the sight of God you only
[43:36] have to be humble in your heart
[43:38] God calls that greatness remember he
[43:40] says a great man is somebody who makes
[43:41] you feel great he says he that's great
[43:43] he that's great enough to Humble himself
[43:46] that's a great person that'll take the
[43:48] blame for everything
[43:51] what would we call that person
[43:53] let's just be honest let's just say that
[43:56] a group of us got together and we
[43:58] vandalized the fellowship hall
[44:00] and after we were done you know everyone
[44:02] gets called on the carpet and we're like
[44:04] hey who vandalized the fellowship Paul
[44:06] and a few of us Brothers
[44:10] and Chase brother Chase not even there
[44:13] he goes I'll take responsibility for it
[44:18] I mean that's maybe not advisable as
[44:19] your lawyer but
[44:21] I mean it almost doesn't even
[44:23] magical
[44:25] but I believe he's speaking within
[44:27] reason a great person who has
[44:28] responsibility he'll take the blame
[44:31] that'll humble himself he says that's
[44:33] greatness
[44:36] is somebody who's not afraid to shoulder
[44:37] the blame
[44:39] somebody's not afraid to say you know
[44:41] what I'll take responsibility for it
[44:42] that's my fault no I'll own it it's okay
[44:45] let's not get bogged down in
[44:46] proportional liability let's not get try
[44:48] to figure out who's responsible for it
[44:50] let's just figure out what was wrong
[44:51] what happened you know what I'll take
[44:53] ownership of that let me take it from
[44:55] here let's go forward let's fix this
[44:58] I remember one time at the very
[45:00] beginning of the church something came
[45:02] up and I mentioned something to brother
[45:03] Mike
[45:03] and it was just something we had to
[45:05] address and his response was adapt and
[45:07] overcome
[45:09] and you know he he didn't have time to
[45:12] try to figure out who's wrong how we
[45:14] should handle it or you know how it
[45:15] could have been handled it was we see
[45:17] the need let's just adapt and let's
[45:18] overcome in the moment that we're in
[45:22] I think maybe too often we're you know
[45:24] we want to hot wash and download
[45:27] instead of just addressing a problem and
[45:30] going forward
[45:33] I know it may be politically incorrect
[45:35] to quote Dilbert
[45:37] but I believe this is from it was either
[45:39] from I'm not yeah
[45:42] I don't know if it's from Mr Adams
[45:48] you saw what I did there but it says the
[45:51] job isn't done until you've blamed
[45:52] someone for the parts that went wrong
[45:57] that's where we live
[46:00] jobs not complete until you found
[46:02] someone to blame for the parts that
[46:04] aren't perfect
[46:06] for all the hiccups for the delay we got
[46:08] it done but we didn't get it on time and
[46:10] it's Teddy's fault we didn't get it on
[46:11] time
[46:13] and so the third problem with the blame
[46:15] game
[46:16] is it keeps us in bondage to weakness
[46:20] I think this may be just one of the most
[46:21] important parts and and I think we're
[46:23] still doing good on time if I could
[46:25] finish in seven minutes
[46:26] but the problem with the blame game is
[46:28] it keeps us in bondage to this to
[46:30] self-defeat we're defeating ourselves
[46:32] when we choose to play the blame game
[46:35] when we put a quarter in the arcade to
[46:37] play the game the blame game it's we're
[46:40] admit we're it's a it's a self-defeating
[46:42] move
[46:43] and it keeps us in bondage to weakness
[46:46] this is something I found as I studied
[46:48] the subject the blame game is often
[46:49] played by those who have a victim
[46:51] mentality
[46:52] and I believe that some could be
[46:54] characterized as this but we can
[46:55] momentarily in certain instances though
[46:57] it may not be our character there's
[46:58] times when we feel so overwhelmed or we
[47:00] feel so attacked we feel that
[47:02] something's so wrong that we kind of
[47:03] take on the Persona and the feelings and
[47:07] we consider ourselves the victim I'm the
[47:09] aggrieved I'm the victim I'm the one
[47:10] that's harmed and for someone to carry a
[47:13] victim mentality be characterized as
[47:15] that somebody whose thought process and
[47:16] their thinking is characterized by
[47:18] blaming everyone and everything else for
[47:19] what's happening to you
[47:21] in other words these unfortunate events
[47:23] that have happened I'm the victim and
[47:25] it's kind of a way of saying I didn't
[47:26] cause this
[47:28] they're just out to get me I didn't do
[47:29] this this is a conspiracy I'm not
[47:31] responsible this is just how my life
[47:33] works
[47:34] and I know that I could spend a lot more
[47:36] time on this mindset of the victim
[47:38] mentality and how that when we blame
[47:40] others we're we're yielding where's that
[47:42] when we blame somebody saying that
[47:44] person had the power that person had the
[47:46] control I didn't
[47:48] I'd love to spend more time on this but
[47:49] I want you to catch that when we blame
[47:51] somebody else and we're willing to let
[47:52] them be fully answered before it we're
[47:54] saying it was outside of my power do you
[47:57] know what notice what you've just done
[47:58] you've just forfeited your Liberty
[48:00] you've just forfeited your power you
[48:01] forfeited whatever right you had to not
[48:04] participate said no I'm in I am subject
[48:06] to that whim
[48:08] I'm subject to that person whatever
[48:10] their actions are I'm drawn just got
[48:13] like a tractor beam I'm just drawn into
[48:14] it and I had to do it
[48:17] and let me just say this problem with
[48:19] the blame game it keeps us in that
[48:20] bondage of mental weakness it keeps us
[48:22] in that self-defeating cycle we're
[48:24] blaming everyone and everyone else but
[48:26] when we blame we're basically taking
[48:27] more power and giving it to somebody
[48:29] else more power and giving it to
[48:30] somebody else
[48:31] let me say this you cannot overcome you
[48:34] cannot address the problems in your life
[48:36] if you insist on being the victim and
[48:38] always blame somebody else
[48:43] Leo Tolstoy I know I'm probably not
[48:45] saying that right since it's Russian but
[48:47] he said a bad mood is often the reason
[48:48] for blaming others
[48:51] but very often can you catch this his
[48:53] brother Leo has to say this very often
[48:56] blaming others causes bad feelings in US
[49:00] the more we blame others the worse we
[49:02] feel
[49:04] think about what's going on inside of
[49:06] our spirits
[49:08] and how strong these mechanisms are in
[49:10] our hearts talk about a segment of
[49:13] character disorder
[49:14] that when you think about how someone
[49:16] has done something and we have this
[49:17] victim mentality maybe we're in a bad
[49:19] mood so we blame somebody else but he's
[49:22] saying very often it's blaming others
[49:24] that causes the bad feeling
[49:26] so Something's Happened and when you as
[49:29] soon as you attribute by I hope you can
[49:30] catch this as soon as you attribute the
[49:33] blame your sense of offense grows
[49:35] greater and you think it's because
[49:38] you've measured what they've done
[49:40] appropriately like I can't believe they
[49:43] did that to me
[49:44] ow
[49:46] that is disgusting I can't believe they
[49:48] did it you should be a sh oh my you are
[49:51] fully oh my goodness the worst we feel
[49:53] we don't realize that we're doing it to
[49:55] ourselves
[49:56] we've only begun to feel worse and worse
[49:58] and worse because we're putting the
[50:00] blame on somebody else and our
[50:01] conscience is saying you know better you
[50:03] know better
[50:05] but what we're doing is we're trying to
[50:07] pass that ugliness on to somebody else
[50:08] and we don't even realize that the
[50:10] reason why we feel bad is not because of
[50:13] the initial offense but because of all
[50:15] of our efforts to place the blame on
[50:16] somebody else and not accept
[50:17] responsibility ourselves
[50:20] it's self-defeating because we're
[50:22] overtly relinquishing power and
[50:24] self-control to somebody else
[50:26] or maybe not self-control just control
[50:28] to others
[50:29] and by blaming others to some degree and
[50:32] I'm careful I say by some degree we're
[50:33] admitting on some level we're powerless
[50:38] Proverbs chapter 28 verse 13 He that
[50:40] covereth his sin shall not prosper
[50:45] he that makes excuses for it
[50:47] he that justifies them himself shall not
[50:50] Prosper shall not Advance shall not make
[50:51] progress shall not be profitable
[50:54] in other words if you cover a sin it
[50:57] corrupts you
[51:00] if you cover sin it weakens you you
[51:02] can't Advance you can't grow
[51:04] it has a defiling corrupting nature to
[51:06] it he that coareth his sins whoever is
[51:09] in the mode of blaming excusing
[51:11] self-justify he's not going to advance
[51:13] and now notice the Bible says but
[51:14] whosoever who's so confesseth and
[51:16] forsaketh them shall have mercy
[51:19] I draw from this scripture the claim
[51:21] that blame is one of the most
[51:23] destructive forces in relationships
[51:25] and one of the most destructive forces
[51:27] in our families
[51:29] whether you want to talk about home or
[51:30] work or any kind of relationship or
[51:32] church blame is one of the most
[51:33] destructive corrupting defiling forces
[51:35] there are
[51:37] you know it could be said that some
[51:38] marriages crumble because of Acts of
[51:40] infidelity some marriages crumble in
[51:42] moments or instances of violence and
[51:44] there's and it's obvious and there's
[51:45] things that are done and we can
[51:46] attribute the crumbling of that marriage
[51:48] too uh some distinct uh unfaithfulness
[51:52] or some harm or some damage that's done
[51:55] but you know that most marriages slowly
[51:58] dissolve
[52:00] and an escalating of pattern escalating
[52:02] pattern of blame and self-justification
[52:05] this is this is where and you say oh my
[52:07] you know why why are you talking about
[52:09] the Neighbors in the apartment next door
[52:10] it was super relevant to this point I
[52:12] think it's important for all of us to
[52:14] think about what corrupts our
[52:15] relationships
[52:17] and how marriages of people that we love
[52:19] and even people who claim to believe the
[52:20] message and people who who claim to love
[52:22] each other how do they get to the place
[52:24] where they have contempt how do they get
[52:26] to the place where they're no longer
[52:27] willing to work together you can see
[52:29] that it's often just this snowballing of
[52:31] blame
[52:33] because they've been able to at some
[52:35] point put the blame on this person and
[52:37] maybe they act defensively and maybe
[52:39] they're not owning it maybe it's their
[52:40] fault but if you've been able to somehow
[52:42] attribute a hundred percent of the blame
[52:44] to somebody else or use the fact that
[52:46] they have some blame and they're not
[52:48] willing to own it to not own your own
[52:50] then it creates this pattern of
[52:52] self-justification for the ones you know
[52:55] and for the ones you're willing to be
[52:56] blamed for and blame for everything else
[53:01] and without noticing it I think this
[53:03] happens in so many relationships you're
[53:05] free to Amen to the extent that you
[53:06] agree and don't feel like you're getting
[53:09] called out on it
[53:10] but when we start with that Blame Game
[53:12] and even in the context of relationships
[53:14] we don't even notice that we become
[53:16] entrenched
[53:17] this is how people get polarized through
[53:20] cognitive dissonance through blame
[53:22] through self-justification we get
[53:24] entrenched in polarized positions and
[53:26] one feels this way and the other one
[53:27] feels that way and they're both in but
[53:28] it's his fault
[53:30] and they say no but it's her fault and
[53:32] they're stuck in it
[53:34] what got him there it's the blame game
[53:39] and that's why it's called mental armor
[53:43] because the Bible said who's so
[53:44] confesseth and forsake of them shall
[53:45] have mercy
[53:46] that mental armor blame hardens our
[53:48] hearts
[53:49] that's what it does
[53:51] every time you blame it's an injury
[53:53] every time you blame you get harder your
[53:56] conscience gets harder your conscience
[53:57] gets harder but listen when the Bible
[53:58] says confession
[54:01] it softens it
[54:05] when we take responsibility for our own
[54:06] actions we feel better
[54:09] I challenge you to try it
[54:12] maybe try it maybe the most innocence of
[54:13] context that the next time your child
[54:15] does something where you're absolutely
[54:16] convinced they're 100 to blame say I'm
[54:19] sorry it's my fault let's fix it
[54:22] and you'll find yourself in a position
[54:24] where you'll probably feel a lot better
[54:27] because blame only hardens our hearts
[54:29] whereas confession softens it
[54:35] in Colossians chapter 3 verse 13.
[54:40] the Bible says for bearing one another
[54:42] and forgiving one another
[54:43] If any man have a quarrel against any
[54:45] even as Christ forgave you so also do ye
[54:48] I encourage you to go back and read this
[54:50] scripture spend some time pondering it
[54:53] but it's saying be gentle
[54:55] be even tempered
[54:57] be self-controlled
[54:59] and if any
[55:01] man have a quarrel
[55:03] and all right you're trying to get
[55:04] technical brother it said man brother
[55:06] Aaron is talking about the men
[55:08] he's talking about us believers
[55:12] If any man have a quarrel against any
[55:14] the word is blame
[55:17] if anybody blames somebody else
[55:20] if anybody has a complaint to get
[55:22] someone else if anyone finds fault in
[55:24] somebody else forgive them
[55:28] this is what the Bible's telling us to
[55:29] do it's not saying that if you blame
[55:31] someone file a complaint
[55:34] if you blame someone you know you need
[55:36] to place the blame it's actually saying
[55:38] you know what Let It Go forgive them
[55:41] don't get caught up in the blame game
[55:43] because the fourth problem with the
[55:45] blame game nobody wins
[55:49] there's never a winner in the blame game
[55:52] and it always comes with the price
[55:55] the Bible's saying we have to forbear
[55:56] one another forgive one another we have
[55:58] to be gentle we ought to be even
[55:59] tempered and if any man blames somebody
[56:00] else if anyone have a complaint with
[56:02] somebody what you ought to do if you
[56:03] have this instinct to blame if you
[56:05] recognize the blame recognize it and pay
[56:07] in placing blame it comes with the price
[56:10] and you may think it's just a quarter in
[56:13] the arcade you may think oh this game is
[56:15] free this is free where I can play it as
[56:16] much as I want no it always costs to
[56:19] play the blame game and the cost is high
[56:22] because even when blame is Justified
[56:24] even when you feel that person is to
[56:26] blame and you absolutely know it I know
[56:27] those brothers are the one that
[56:28] vandalized the fellowship Paul I know
[56:30] they're the ones that did it they need
[56:31] to answer for it it carries negative
[56:33] consequences
[56:35] and if I could put it this way just so
[56:37] you could understand the blame game
[56:38] there are no winners
[56:41] there are no resolutions
[56:43] the game can the only way that you can
[56:46] end the game
[56:48] is to quit it
[56:50] it's a game over
[56:52] I won't play the blame game anymore
[56:54] because it just escalates it spirals it
[56:56] goes out of control
[56:57] and if I could say this about the blame
[56:59] game the reason why I say it comes with
[57:00] the price and it carries negative
[57:02] consequences it is the exact opposite of
[57:04] problem solving
[57:07] right we spend so much energy trying to
[57:09] figure out who's at fault
[57:11] we have we put so much effort trying to
[57:13] place the blame
[57:16] whereas instead we ought to Jesus says
[57:17] forgive
[57:19] and look for a solution
[57:21] forgive it if there's pieces that need
[57:22] to be picked up let's pick them up
[57:24] forgiven if there's something broken
[57:25] let's fix it let's not shame somebody
[57:28] and Shake somebody and begrudge somebody
[57:31] and you'd look at the other scriptures
[57:33] that are being used in this context it's
[57:35] encouraging us let's listen when
[57:37] something's been done and it's wrong the
[57:38] opposite to problem solving is trying to
[57:41] place the blame and figure out who's
[57:42] liable who's at fault the best thing to
[57:44] do is to forgive and fix
[57:46] the Bible says forgiving one another in
[57:48] other words some of the translations say
[57:49] be quick to forgive why because Christ
[57:51] forgave us also
[57:53] when we were guilty
[57:55] right when he could have put the blame
[57:57] entirely upon us because he was guilty
[57:59] what did he do were the guilty ones and
[58:01] he said I'll take it he shouldered our
[58:04] blame he accepted responsibility for our
[58:07] fault and he forgave us
[58:10] even there when he's down on the cross
[58:12] he doesn't say you crucified me you put
[58:15] me up here he said forgive them Father
[58:16] for they don't know what they do
[58:19] so if I could say this even when the
[58:20] fault is clear even when the blame can
[58:22] really be placed upon somebody we ought
[58:25] to have a deeper empathy for the
[58:27] offender
[58:28] we have to be more moved to forgiveness
[58:30] yes blame is available the blame card is
[58:32] on the table the blame game is always
[58:34] available for you to step up to it but
[58:36] you know what you could do instead of
[58:37] blame if any one of you have a blame
[58:38] against somebody else he's saying be
[58:40] quick to forgive don't enter into the
[58:42] blame game so when we have an
[58:43] opportunity to blame we can be
[58:45] empathetic
[58:46] I know this is the lengthy quote but I
[58:48] feel we're doing awesome on time
[58:50] I mean let me just say this in terms of
[58:53] being empathetic towards those that make
[58:54] mistakes in Galatians 6 1 I think we
[58:56] even have the scripture there it says ye
[58:58] who are spiritual when you find one
[58:59] taken in a fault
[59:01] when you find someone who's a blunt to
[59:03] blame
[59:04] you heard spiritual restore such a one
[59:06] within a spirit of weakness
[59:08] considering your own selves
[59:11] what does that speak of empathy
[59:14] when someone makes a mistake are you
[59:16] above them
[59:17] have you never made one
[59:20] I mean it was a question I asked once
[59:22] somebody one time I said have you ever
[59:23] made a mistake when doing this
[59:25] and and and I'd kind of impeached him a
[59:28] little bit I kind of boxed them in and
[59:29] when I asked if they'd ever made a
[59:30] mistake they wanted to say they never
[59:33] made a mistake so you know what they
[59:35] said this is where I kind of paused on a
[59:36] conscious hypocrite they said yes
[59:39] because if I say no it'll come across as
[59:42] arrogant
[59:45] so they admitted to making mistakes
[59:48] just because they if they it said that
[59:51] they hadn't because they thought they
[59:52] hadn't they know they would sound
[59:53] horrible
[59:56] and that's where it's like where's the
[59:59] empathy
[1:00:00] with someone is in that place where they
[1:00:02] never do anything wrong
[1:00:03] they've never made a mistake then how do
[1:00:05] you think they view everybody else who
[1:00:06] does
[1:00:08] and so where do we get as people when we
[1:00:10] look at a young person who's making a
[1:00:11] mistake well you've got an individual
[1:00:12] that falls and we immediately just judge
[1:00:14] him and castigate them and say all sorts
[1:00:16] of nasty things about them what about
[1:00:17] yourself
[1:00:20] who would need be without the grace of
[1:00:21] God
[1:00:23] we should throw our we should
[1:00:24] acknowledge that the Bible say who
[1:00:26] confesseth and forsake it shall be shown
[1:00:28] Mercy why don't we just say I am what I
[1:00:30] am by the grace of God and but for the
[1:00:32] grace of God their goeth I and then I've
[1:00:34] somehow found myself in his bed of mercy
[1:00:37] and they're renewed every morning and
[1:00:39] he's kept me and he's provided for me
[1:00:41] and if it listen if it wasn't for the
[1:00:44] grace of God we'd all we would all be
[1:00:46] wrecked
[1:00:48] so we ought to have that instinct to be
[1:00:50] empathetic as opposed to blaming forgive
[1:00:53] considering ourselves
[1:00:55] putting ourselves in their shoes and
[1:00:56] saying you know what if it was me I'd
[1:00:57] want to be forgiven
[1:00:59] if it was me I'd want to be understood
[1:01:00] surely that person didn't mean to do
[1:01:02] that surely they weren't this way
[1:01:05] I could even go so far as saying this is
[1:01:06] a lot of times people do things because
[1:01:08] they're just they're just clueless
[1:01:10] not because they're mean they're just
[1:01:12] clueless
[1:01:13] maybe that's a harsh word to use they're
[1:01:15] just insensitive they're not overtly
[1:01:16] mean they're not doing it because I
[1:01:17] really don't like that guy I'm going to
[1:01:18] do this they just don't realize what
[1:01:20] they're doing is mean
[1:01:22] anyone in that case they're having a lot
[1:01:24] of Grace and being able to establish
[1:01:25] boundaries and ways to address that
[1:01:27] would be what that person needs instead
[1:01:28] of mistreating and bullying thing and
[1:01:30] talking bad about them and but being
[1:01:32] empathetic they don't realize it we got
[1:01:34] to help them realize it some way but you
[1:01:36] know even the person who is
[1:01:37] intentionally means something's done
[1:01:39] Something's Happened to them
[1:01:40] and that's why they are the way they are
[1:01:43] and without empathy even if you can't be
[1:01:46] empathetic at least without sympathy
[1:01:47] saying something happened to them
[1:01:51] we just perpetuate the problem
[1:01:54] brother Branham said in the sermon the
[1:01:56] baptism of the Holy Spirit he's making a
[1:01:57] comment about how he'd come back from
[1:01:59] traveling
[1:02:00] when you came back there was a little
[1:02:02] issue in the church he says when we come
[1:02:03] in we found the church kind of in a
[1:02:05] little upset here and there this is kind
[1:02:07] of a neat story isn't it
[1:02:10] and some of the members had began to
[1:02:11] kind of get a little lukewarm
[1:02:13] pull away holding little enmities
[1:02:16] against each other and so forth like
[1:02:17] that
[1:02:19] and I went around from one to the other
[1:02:21] until we got us all straightened up
[1:02:24] he said now it's all right and there's
[1:02:25] nothing wrong and there was nothing
[1:02:28] wrong with any of the members
[1:02:30] they're everyone fine men and women but
[1:02:32] what happened
[1:02:33] something got in there
[1:02:36] something mixed things up got a little
[1:02:37] lukewarm had a little entities or
[1:02:39] whatever said if they could just realize
[1:02:41] this is the part I know it maybe seems
[1:02:42] just a little bit maybe a little bit off
[1:02:44] subject or maybe just in a little bit
[1:02:46] different vein but I want to take this
[1:02:48] from this if any man have blame forgive
[1:02:50] he says if they could just realize that
[1:02:52] that's the devil that gets between the
[1:02:53] people
[1:02:54] that's exactly right it's not the people
[1:02:56] if you can let a brother see that then
[1:02:57] he won't hold enmity against the other
[1:02:59] fellow he'll feel bad he'll feel like
[1:03:01] well I feel sorry for my brother
[1:03:03] see he did do wrong why it wasn't the
[1:03:06] brother it was the devil that did that
[1:03:08] so the brother did wrong he's like Adam
[1:03:10] he's in the transgression she's like the
[1:03:11] woman she's in the transgression he's
[1:03:13] like King he's in the transgression
[1:03:14] there's there's a portion of blame
[1:03:16] there's someone to be at fault but he
[1:03:17] says you know it's the devil that did
[1:03:18] that
[1:03:19] you say well this guy did a certain
[1:03:21] certain thing your brother didn't do
[1:03:23] that your sister didn't do that that was
[1:03:24] the devil that got into them and that
[1:03:26] did that so don't blame the brother the
[1:03:29] sister blamed the devil that's the one
[1:03:31] who caused it
[1:03:32] I shared this I wrestled with whether or
[1:03:34] not I ought to share it just because I
[1:03:35] feel like it kind of takes a little bit
[1:03:36] different light on the whole subject but
[1:03:38] I want you to just recognize that we do
[1:03:40] have something else we can do when the
[1:03:42] blame game is offered to us we can
[1:03:44] forgive and then if we feel really
[1:03:46] really pressed to be able to put the
[1:03:48] blame on somebody why don't we just
[1:03:50] drill down a little bit deeper and say
[1:03:51] if the devil that does it
[1:03:54] and put the blame on the devil they say
[1:03:57] well yeah I mean maybe I mean the
[1:03:58] serpent was responsible and Adam was
[1:04:00] responsible and the woman was
[1:04:01] responsible and we could recognize all
[1:04:03] the responsibility but just place the
[1:04:05] blame squarely on who we can blame so
[1:04:07] that we can have some empathy
[1:04:10] and if not empathy some sympathy
[1:04:13] for those who make mistakes and are at
[1:04:14] fault
[1:04:17] ah the blame game
[1:04:19] I hope we can say game over to it
[1:04:22] the Bible says who can understand
[1:04:24] his heirs
[1:04:26] and then ask cleanse me cleanse me
[1:04:30] for my secret faults
[1:04:32] that's the attitude I want you to have
[1:04:35] I if we could with the slide there just
[1:04:38] in in in your view who can understand
[1:04:40] his heirs cleanse thou me from my
[1:04:43] self-justification
[1:04:45] cleanse me from my cognitive dissonance
[1:04:47] keep it far from me
[1:04:48] cleanse me from this always blaming
[1:04:50] others doesn't make you a bad person
[1:04:53] it's helping you understand what you do
[1:04:56] have responsibility over
[1:04:58] there's people that gonna they are to
[1:05:00] blame they did make the mistakes they
[1:05:02] did do things to you they are
[1:05:04] responsible but Lord what am I
[1:05:06] responsible for what are our are my
[1:05:09] heirs I believe this is the attitude
[1:05:11] that we ought to have what is my share
[1:05:13] what could have I done better
[1:05:15] this happens a lot in in counseling
[1:05:19] that generally people come to you with a
[1:05:21] problem they have with somebody else
[1:05:23] and and what they're wanting to hear
[1:05:25] from you is all your opinions on how bad
[1:05:28] that person is in what we can do
[1:05:30] together to fix them
[1:05:32] and I've had this happen in all the the
[1:05:35] all the years I've counseled for
[1:05:37] whatever reason God always put it in my
[1:05:38] mind that when someone comes to me with
[1:05:40] the problem and the problems with
[1:05:42] somebody else I I'm not counseling
[1:05:44] somebody else I'm counseling the person
[1:05:46] that came to me and my instinct has
[1:05:47] always been well what can we do to help
[1:05:49] you to overcome this
[1:05:51] and you'll be surprised how many times
[1:05:53] it's like me I've got to do something
[1:05:55] about this
[1:05:56] you mean you're not you're not gonna go
[1:05:58] talk to him
[1:05:59] wait what do you
[1:06:01] person doesn't even go to our church
[1:06:04] they're not even a believer you want me
[1:06:05] to call and say I don't know if you
[1:06:06] heard but I'm a message pastor
[1:06:09] and you are wrong
[1:06:12] I'm so sorry
[1:06:15] and you start to counsel the person you
[1:06:17] say well you know what you need to show
[1:06:18] a lot of Grace you need to show a lot of
[1:06:19] patience have you said or done anything
[1:06:21] that provoked this did you do something
[1:06:23] to put yourself in a position where they
[1:06:24] didn't trust you well how dare you
[1:06:28] to actually try to find some secret
[1:06:30] fault in me
[1:06:34] we should be asking ourselves what is my
[1:06:36] fault
[1:06:37] that should be a way that we should
[1:06:38] approach problems together
[1:06:41] is I've got this problem what can I do
[1:06:43] better
[1:06:44] I have a problem with somebody else what
[1:06:45] have I done wrong
[1:06:47] there's a preacher I can't remember just
[1:06:49] exactly what Aries from Henry Ward
[1:06:51] Beecher I don't know why we do all three
[1:06:53] of those but it's just Henry Ward
[1:06:54] Beecher every time I see him referred to
[1:06:56] it get his middle name ward in there
[1:06:58] but he was asked One Time by a young
[1:07:00] preacher you know how can I keep my
[1:07:02] congregation from falling asleep
[1:07:04] and I didn't find find that because I
[1:07:06] was searching for Solutions
[1:07:10] it says young preacher I'm 48 years old
[1:07:14] how can I keep
[1:07:16] the congregation wide awake and
[1:07:17] attentive while I'm preaching and so
[1:07:19] Henry Ward Beecher replied that he
[1:07:22] always had a man who watched for
[1:07:24] sleepers
[1:07:25] so like a deacon
[1:07:27] and he kind of looked out in the church
[1:07:28] right
[1:07:29] and he'd walk around and he'd try to
[1:07:31] find somebody who was sleeping
[1:07:34] and if you ever found somebody I got a
[1:07:36] lot of Grace for kids on for kids for
[1:07:39] children that eat free on Wednesday
[1:07:40] nights
[1:07:42] but it goes around and he said he'd find
[1:07:44] somebody that was sleeping
[1:07:46] and he'd given him instructions
[1:07:49] as soon as he saw anyone that started to
[1:07:51] nod started the dolls or started to fall
[1:07:54] asleep he had one instruction
[1:07:57] to run to the pulpit and wake up the
[1:07:59] preacher
[1:08:04] and that was the instructions
[1:08:06] and what was hid reward beecher's
[1:08:09] self-awareness or what was his
[1:08:11] his conviction
[1:08:13] I'll take responsibility
[1:08:16] for the ones that are sleeping
[1:08:19] don't Rouse them up they probably have
[1:08:21] their reasons much better than my own
[1:08:22] and they they
[1:08:29] put them to sleep
[1:08:31] and what I loved about that that's you
[1:08:33] could put that slide back up there but
[1:08:34] John game over
[1:08:36] I love it game over
[1:08:38] young preacher comes to Henry Ward
[1:08:40] Beecher how could we keep the
[1:08:42] congregation from falling asleep when
[1:08:44] I'm preaching
[1:08:46] let's figure this out and let's find out
[1:08:48] all the things that make them sleep and
[1:08:50] let's find out what they're doing the
[1:08:51] night before and you know whether what
[1:08:53] energy drink are they using because some
[1:08:55] work better than others and let's do
[1:08:57] vitamin B pills just nothing if I said
[1:09:00] you know what Young preacher
[1:09:01] don't put them to sleep
[1:09:04] that was game over to the blame game
[1:09:06] it didn't even start
[1:09:09] and I say let's quit it
[1:09:11] anybody here playing it
[1:09:14] you know you know in the Nintendo days
[1:09:16] when the game wasn't going the way you
[1:09:17] liked it you hit the reset button
[1:09:19] right
[1:09:21] you just hit the reset button that was
[1:09:22] it you could start all over
[1:09:24] I don't know how the gaming systems work
[1:09:25] these days who knows it's probably one
[1:09:27] of these things where you can't get rid
[1:09:27] of it but it's there again
[1:09:30] but I I just suggest turning off the
[1:09:33] game console
[1:09:34] turning it off just get rid of it
[1:09:37] let the devil have it back
[1:09:39] just not worth playing
[1:09:41] you've been trying to win it trying to
[1:09:44] win it trying to win it and you've never
[1:09:46] won yet
[1:09:48] you thought you did but you only felt
[1:09:49] worse
[1:09:51] because no one wins the blame game
[1:09:54] and I say let's just quit it
[1:09:56] stop playing it if we started stop
[1:10:00] and do as the Bible says in Revelations
[1:10:02] 3 19 as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:10:04] chasten
[1:10:05] be zealous therefore and repent
[1:10:08] this must be our zeal
[1:10:12] I remember the the phrase my wife will
[1:10:15] share it with me 20 something years ago
[1:10:17] I just remember I think might have been
[1:10:18] when brother John had preached something
[1:10:20] her her dad
[1:10:22] on how it expresses the Zeal of the age
[1:10:26] that if God's asking them to do
[1:10:27] something I remember at the time maybe
[1:10:29] in my theological mind I'm thinking I
[1:10:31] don't know maybe the Zeal the age is the
[1:10:33] son of man what do you think right like
[1:10:35] you just you get in your mind loftier
[1:10:37] ideals
[1:10:39] but this is the this is what he asked
[1:10:41] him to be zealous for to repent
[1:10:45] and this must still be our zeal
[1:10:48] that we're taught to be quick to repent
[1:10:50] just as quick as we are to forgive
[1:10:53] so be willing to ask ourselves even in
[1:10:55] the face of when we've been harmed and
[1:10:56] when we've been hurt and maybe when our
[1:10:58] blame on somebody else is Justified to
[1:11:00] just simply ask ourselves what could
[1:11:02] have I done to do better
[1:11:04] and you might actually find yourself
[1:11:06] instead of blaming someone you might
[1:11:08] actually find yourself apologizing to
[1:11:10] someone and say you know what I want to
[1:11:12] apologize
[1:11:13] I put you in a tough spot I want to
[1:11:15] apologize I should have done this I
[1:11:18] should have done that and in with the
[1:11:19] apology the person's like oh no no no no
[1:11:21] no no that was my fault
[1:11:24] just think about how practical this is
[1:11:27] that you're willing to own it you're
[1:11:28] willing to accept it you've got down on
[1:11:30] your knees before God In Prayer you've
[1:11:31] confessed and forsaken you've softened
[1:11:34] your heart and you haven't hid yourself
[1:11:35] behind the mental armor of justification
[1:11:37] and now you begin to feel and you begin
[1:11:39] to get over those barriers enough to say
[1:11:41] I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that and
[1:11:43] the other person's like oh I accept your
[1:11:46] apology but really it was my fault what
[1:11:48] you don't know is I did this and put you
[1:11:50] in that situation and at that point if
[1:11:53] you really weren't playing the blame
[1:11:55] game
[1:11:56] you don't go I knew it
[1:11:59] you just say hey it's okay let's go
[1:12:02] forward
[1:12:05] let's go forward
[1:12:07] game over
[1:12:09] let's end the blame game
[1:12:12] I trust it's spoken to your heart in a
[1:12:13] very relevant and deep way again I
[1:12:16] encourage you to listen to this again I
[1:12:19] don't think I've ever told a church to
[1:12:21] do it
[1:12:22] but I encourage you to listen it again
[1:12:23] if you can stomach it
[1:12:25] and if someone in your family hasn't
[1:12:27] heard it find a nice way
[1:12:30] right say I learned a lot I'm sorry I've
[1:12:34] made mistakes and if you want to know
[1:12:36] why my heart's changed listen to this
[1:12:37] service right
[1:12:38] instead of saying I heard something
[1:12:40] tonight and you need to listen to it
[1:12:42] like of all services you miss you missed
[1:12:44] the one on the blame game
[1:12:46] right
[1:12:47] no let's not do that but I think it's
[1:12:50] important for us as a church I want this
[1:12:52] to be a part of our character as a
[1:12:53] church
[1:12:54] I want this to be part of the way that
[1:12:55] we handle differences with one another I
[1:12:57] want this to be a part of how we handle
[1:12:59] our relationships because as a church
[1:13:01] we're growing and we're not just growing
[1:13:03] because we're knocking out walls we're
[1:13:04] tearing down barriers
[1:13:07] we're tearing down barriers and we're
[1:13:08] growing closer together
[1:13:10] and as we do we need to understand one
[1:13:11] another and we need to be able to not
[1:13:13] engage in these these instinctive things
[1:13:16] that are harmful to ourselves and
[1:13:17] hurtful to other people
[1:13:18] and I want us as a church to have it in
[1:13:21] our hearts that the blame game is not an
[1:13:23] option but solving problems is
[1:13:27] and we will work through things we'll
[1:13:28] make things right and we'll figure out a
[1:13:30] way to achieve success instead of trying
[1:13:32] to figure out a way to shame somebody
[1:13:33] and blame somebody will you will you
[1:13:36] agree with me that game over
[1:13:38] the end of the blame game as a church
[1:13:40] that we will and I'll promise this to
[1:13:43] you as a pastor I'll take responsibility
[1:13:47] I'll hold myself accountable to you I
[1:13:49] willingly voluntarily offer it to you
[1:13:51] willing to be accountable and let's not
[1:13:53] have a blame game in this assembly and
[1:13:55] if we could do it as a church maybe
[1:13:56] it'll be a good example for you and your
[1:13:58] families
[1:13:59] and I know it'll make a difference in
[1:14:00] your life
[1:14:02] I love you thank you so much for your
[1:14:03] attentiveness tonight your patience it's
[1:14:05] been worth it
[1:14:07] could we stand together
