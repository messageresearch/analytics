[0:00] our title today
[0:01] under our family tree is a place called
[0:04] home so we'll just jump right into this
[0:06] do some review for a few moments and
[0:08] then pick up on those concepts of our
[0:10] family tree on family and tree and these
[0:12] concepts that are being combined so as
[0:14] we look at this in verse 33 like if you
[0:17] just to read it again with me and then
[0:18] ponder some of the things that we've
[0:20] covered already if you have if you take
[0:22] notes you might be able to just flip
[0:23] back
[0:24] and kind of parse over some of those
[0:26] things and we'll highlight some portions
[0:28] but abraham planted we know in planting
[0:31] this is something that god did uh it is
[0:33] something it was a tillage of soil even
[0:35] in some translations so it's something
[0:37] that adam was to do so it's the image of
[0:39] god in the image of adam it is a type of
[0:41] christ
[0:42] who said he would build his church and
[0:44] even in this tree that is built it is a
[0:47] type of christ and even the tree is a
[0:49] type of his church and so abraham
[0:51] planted the grove
[0:53] in some places it says abraham planted a
[0:56] tamarisk tree or abraham planted a tree
[0:58] in beersheba and it was there in this
[1:00] grove that he called upon the name of
[1:02] the lord and it uses this phrase it's
[1:04] the first time that it's used in the
[1:05] scripture the everlasting god so it
[1:07] speaks to his eternal quality and a god
[1:10] forever to abraham and when we read in
[1:12] genesis chapter 1 21 we saw where
[1:15] abraham plants this grove after the
[1:17] promised sun came doesn't plant it
[1:20] this instance and this instance of
[1:22] planting this tree comes into existence
[1:24] once the promised family comes into
[1:26] expression son to sarah sun by abraham
[1:29] and so this there was a fulfillment of a
[1:32] vision but also there was this
[1:33] forward-looking part on abraham's in
[1:36] abraham's actions where he had a vision
[1:38] where he's planting a family tree for
[1:40] himself for his wife
[1:42] and for his son and then all those that
[1:45] would come after him any of the ones
[1:47] that would come after isaac there would
[1:48] be this place
[1:49] that
[1:50] they could worship a place where his
[1:51] family would honor god worship the bible
[1:54] says the everlasting god
[1:56] and we identified how in plant in a tree
[1:58] it wasn't selfish not immediately to
[2:00] satisfy the flesh
[2:02] or self-serving unless abraham
[2:05] unless there was nurseries in those days
[2:06] that had the equipment that we do today
[2:08] where you could buy a 55 000 tree and
[2:10] have it transplanted and have a nice
[2:12] mature tree in your front yard wouldn't
[2:14] that be nice if that was within reach
[2:16] right
[2:17] uh elliot and i have had an ongoing
[2:19] debate as to whether or not there's any
[2:20] trees in phoenix i don't know if it is
[2:22] uh one of those conspiracy theories like
[2:25] there is there are no birds or birds
[2:26] aren't real
[2:27] but sometimes you wish for a tree well
[2:30] abraham planted a tree and knew that it
[2:32] would take a long time for this to grow
[2:34] if it was a fruit tree though many don't
[2:36] believe it was it would take years for
[2:38] it to fruit so something that was
[2:39] forward-looking something that had a
[2:41] vision
[2:42] and i was really moved by how the
[2:44] hebrews treat this scripture
[2:46] and the hebrew it's a abraham planted a
[2:49] shell
[2:50] and to a hebrew it was a place of
[2:51] hospitality
[2:53] and this is what they teach and their
[2:55] their synagogues this is what the the
[2:57] rabbis teach this is what their
[2:58] theologians hold in their tradition
[3:00] orally and in written that it was a
[3:02] place of feeding and drinking and
[3:04] supplying where you would give
[3:07] things to the travelers and to guests
[3:09] and to family that would come
[3:11] and they even look at the name michelle
[3:13] and it's actually an acronym for feeding
[3:15] drinking and accompanying and giving
[3:17] possessions and giving
[3:19] service to people and they don't just
[3:21] say that it was a place where he's
[3:23] standing under a tree like this saying
[3:24] jesus jesus jesus and that's how he
[3:27] called upon the name of the lord but
[3:29] rather he invoked the name of the
[3:32] everlasting god by the acts that he
[3:34] performed under the tree
[3:37] and in this grove and this garden that
[3:39] he built this place of worship that he
[3:41] would invite travelers that were passing
[3:43] through and say you look weary you look
[3:45] tired come and soldier in here for a
[3:46] little bit and and dwell with me for the
[3:48] night or come in for the day and he
[3:50] would uh he would minister to them and
[3:52] when he would done it had done it they
[3:54] would have wanted to thank him and they
[3:56] would have said oh you're a wonderful
[3:57] man and and praise be to you and he'd
[3:59] say no
[4:00] these things have not come by my hand
[4:02] but they've come by the everlasting god
[4:04] and and he would be able to witness and
[4:06] to testify of the things that god had
[4:08] done for him i imagine i mean abraham
[4:10] had a testimony he had a testimony
[4:12] unfolding there was think there were
[4:13] stories he could tell
[4:15] i was i was i dwelled in babylon and i
[4:18] left with my family and i traveled here
[4:19] and i traveled there and then to begin
[4:21] to tell a story about and god spoke to
[4:23] me appeared to me in a vision and god
[4:24] told me to do this and god told me to do
[4:26] that and they may all be thinking yeah
[4:27] we've heard of deities we've heard of
[4:29] gods but this is something that was real
[4:32] uh that he could begin to go through his
[4:33] life and tell these testimonies
[4:36] and so it was a place where he could
[4:38] testify it was a place where he could
[4:39] serve
[4:40] and and so the jews hold it as it was a
[4:42] shell was a place where god was
[4:44] manifested by how he served others it
[4:46] was a place where he could point others
[4:48] to god
[4:49] and we looked at the different places in
[4:51] scripture where abraham and even his
[4:53] seed after him returned back to this
[4:54] very place to offer sacrifice um to
[4:57] worship to serve god and it was a place
[5:00] not only where they worship but they
[5:01] found rest it's a place where they were
[5:03] fed as elijah fled to the beersheba left
[5:06] his servant there and went into the
[5:07] wilderness of beersheba and he was fed
[5:09] by god he was strengthened and then god
[5:12] spoke to his children there gave them
[5:14] visions appeared to them ministered to
[5:16] elijah there and so this is a special
[5:18] place
[5:20] and we're using abraham's grove as a
[5:22] type of our family tree
[5:24] that family tree is the one that's kind
[5:26] of maybe lined up next to you in the
[5:27] chairs you're sitting in today and it's
[5:29] also type of this family tree which
[5:31] we're a part of
[5:32] as a church
[5:33] and so we want you to see different
[5:35] layers of application in your life
[5:38] now two concepts merged together i
[5:40] mentioned this just a moment ago how two
[5:42] concepts merged together in the thought
[5:44] of our family tree and so this phrase
[5:46] family tree there's two different
[5:48] concepts that we could amplify one is a
[5:51] relationship and the other one is
[5:52] fellowship and so in that there's
[5:54] connection and there's communion so
[5:56] there's relationship connection there's
[5:58] fellowship and communion those are two
[6:00] different things
[6:01] family embodies the relationship and the
[6:03] connection and then the tree is a place
[6:05] of fellowship or communion
[6:07] now this is
[6:08] a subject that i would like to expand i
[6:10] thought i would maybe expand it a little
[6:12] bit more today
[6:13] but i just want to introduce it a family
[6:15] is a group consisting a group of people
[6:17] consisting of parents and children we
[6:20] kind of be the modern definition a group
[6:22] of people a group of parents and
[6:24] children living together in a household
[6:27] there's different legal rules for
[6:28] household and dependence or living under
[6:31] the same roof or depending on one
[6:33] another but that's what we would how we
[6:35] would define a family today been reading
[6:37] a number of articles and scholarship on
[6:39] what family is and how to define family
[6:42] and it's very interesting anymore
[6:44] how they want like to define a family
[6:46] but it would be parents and children
[6:48] living together together in a house
[6:51] and maybe another definition a group of
[6:53] individuals living under one roof and
[6:55] under one head
[6:56] and this is uh this is how we refer to a
[6:58] family and then there's also a
[7:00] definition of a group of people united
[7:02] by certain convictions and or a common
[7:05] affiliation and so that's another way of
[7:08] looking at a family
[7:09] and i believe that the
[7:12] the believers they they have a
[7:14] connection which is real in the same
[7:17] sense you have parents and children
[7:18] together in one household uh they also
[7:21] fit the definition of those who have a
[7:23] common conviction and they have a
[7:25] certain affiliation that connects them
[7:27] together but it's important to recognize
[7:29] that the true body of christ really
[7:31] transcends anything natural and we're
[7:34] only using natural things to somehow get
[7:37] our minds around what the body of christ
[7:39] is but the body of christ is a family
[7:42] as paul says in ephesians chapter 3
[7:44] verses 14 to 15 referring to jesus
[7:47] christ in verse 14 of hope of whom
[7:50] the whole family in heaven and in earth
[7:53] is named
[7:54] and so the body of christ is referred to
[7:57] as
[7:58] a family
[7:59] in the
[8:01] in the new testament the word family is
[8:03] patria
[8:05] it's also uh translated to lineage or
[8:07] kindred but this is the way that it
[8:09] describes family and this is perfect i
[8:11] think for
[8:12] for us believers
[8:14] it's lineage running back to the same
[8:16] progenitor the same father the same
[8:19] source the same ancestry and it's all
[8:21] those who in a given people lay claim to
[8:24] a common origin so it also maybe would
[8:27] refer to a race or tribe so if you're in
[8:30] a family if you have a common origin
[8:32] you're in a family if you have a common
[8:34] father you have a common common ancestry
[8:36] and a common progenitor so in the
[8:38] natural this is so that's why israel is
[8:40] such a beautiful type because they are a
[8:42] people that their religion and their
[8:45] conviction their belief was associated
[8:46] with who they were in their flesh
[8:49] like their their actual dna determined
[8:52] that they were israelites they were jews
[8:54] and they had a religion they had a god
[8:55] of their father and so the way that they
[8:58] would relate to one another in the
[8:59] natural is a type of how we are
[9:02] spiritually related to christ in a very
[9:04] real way
[9:06] in a very real way it says in luke
[9:08] chapter 2 verse 4 this kind of captures
[9:10] that thought it's talking about joseph i
[9:12] don't know if i provided this one but it
[9:14] says and joseph also went up from
[9:15] galilee out of the city of nazareth into
[9:17] judea under the city of david which is
[9:19] called bethlehem and it says because he
[9:21] was of the house and lineage of david so
[9:24] he was of the family of david he had
[9:26] descended from david so that's why he
[9:28] went to bethlehem because he was of the
[9:30] house of david or the lineage of david
[9:32] he was in david's family
[9:34] now we know that this in israel would
[9:36] relate to grandparents great
[9:38] grandparents and they would say we're of
[9:39] our father abraham because they
[9:41] descended
[9:43] linearly from him they are the lineage
[9:45] of abraham but i believe it was brother
[9:47] manuel and and i trust that we had that
[9:49] prayer request in to pray for him he's
[9:50] ministering in tucson today uh really
[9:53] enjoyed wednesday night service he
[9:54] mentioned wednesday night that god
[9:55] doesn't have grandchildren
[9:58] and he described a unique way that he
[10:00] had a relationship with god through his
[10:01] mom
[10:03] and so it's it's god does not have that
[10:05] kind of relationship so we are all
[10:08] uh descended from god we are his
[10:10] children
[10:11] and and as it says in galatians chapter
[10:13] 6 verse 10 the household of faith do
[10:16] good especially to them who are of the
[10:18] household of the lineage of the pro of
[10:20] the progeny of god the household of
[10:22] faith
[10:23] and a household means it belongs to a
[10:25] family and we speak of a household
[10:27] there's intimate relationships there's
[10:29] blood connections uh it's called kindred
[10:32] and so when we say family that's what
[10:34] we're looking at we're looking at
[10:35] relationship
[10:37] when we talk about family we're talking
[10:38] about connection that we would look at
[10:40] one another and we do not have
[10:42] connection because we have the same
[10:44] membership in arizona believer's church
[10:46] but we have connection because we are
[10:48] part of the family of god
[10:50] and we have a connection to one another
[10:52] because we have the same father and
[10:54] christ is our head
[10:56] and so that's what the true church is
[10:58] that's who you are a part of then we we
[11:02] have that becomes our model our example
[11:05] and how we'd like to participate and
[11:07] interact with one another in this
[11:08] household
[11:10] because all being children of god we've
[11:12] gathered here so then we ought to
[11:13] conduct ourselves in the house of god
[11:16] how that we would conduct ourselves in
[11:18] the family of god
[11:20] because god's family
[11:22] is a picture of what our family ought to
[11:24] be as heads of our own homes
[11:26] and then also what our church ought to
[11:28] be
[11:29] and i believe that in our and our
[11:30] families at home and wherever you may be
[11:32] and whatever your arrangement might be
[11:34] as far as family we should strive to
[11:36] reflect god's order of the family
[11:39] however god has arranged and how he's
[11:41] placed it it's remarkable and i might
[11:43] find myself veering out a little bit
[11:44] here it's remarkable how much of our
[11:47] duty as christians is expressed in the
[11:49] terms of our relationships to other
[11:51] people
[11:52] and taking your place as a man taking
[11:54] your place as a woman taking your place
[11:56] as children and all the different things
[11:58] that we would do in some way it relates
[12:00] to our position
[12:02] and relationship to other people
[12:05] and so we should strive to find that our
[12:07] place in our lives but then also to
[12:09] reflect christ and god's order in these
[12:12] different relationships so that's the
[12:14] concept of family when i talk about
[12:15] family these are some of the things
[12:17] we're talking about this household of
[12:19] faith the family of god
[12:21] now i want to touch on very quickly the
[12:23] concept of fellowship because we say our
[12:26] family we're a family but then there's a
[12:28] tree and that could be in the sense that
[12:30] we all descend from christ or we're all
[12:31] re we're all related to god so you could
[12:33] see that as a lineage i don't know how
[12:35] that runs like this
[12:37] for a very very long time and there's no
[12:39] grandchildren so it's just those two
[12:40] levels god and then everybody else
[12:43] uh and it's kind of the sparks the
[12:45] interesting theological discussions
[12:47] about what the wedding supper table is
[12:48] going to look like and the seating
[12:50] arrangement
[12:51] that's always fun and fruitless
[12:54] but it is it is fun just to ponder it
[12:57] and think about it
[12:58] and not saying it is but could it be a
[13:00] table so long or so high or a spiral so
[13:03] we all see a big round table right so
[13:05] we're all facing each other you got
[13:07] perfect eyesight right
[13:09] so it's gonna be like they're right
[13:10] there
[13:11] see it could be fun
[13:12] so uh this idea um
[13:15] so that's our we have our family then we
[13:17] as a tree we're looking at this concept
[13:19] of fellowship when we talk about a tree
[13:22] and this is uh
[13:24] i believe fellowship and communion is
[13:25] embodied in the idea at least this is
[13:27] how i'm reading it in the scripture this
[13:29] is how it strikes me the different
[13:31] places that i read about uh um the the
[13:33] symbolism and the type of a tree but the
[13:36] idea and image of a tree is express the
[13:38] idea of connection and fellowship a
[13:39] grove would be a place that you would
[13:41] come to a garden uh would be a place
[13:43] that you would spend time in i still
[13:45] remember very very vividly sister
[13:47] elizabeth can attest to this it's almost
[13:48] as if we could walk through each pace
[13:50] that when we were received into brother
[13:52] harold and sister ernestine beckett's
[13:54] home in cape town
[13:55] uh that they greeted us and they and
[13:58] they showed love to us and then uh
[14:00] sister ernestine took elizabeth into one
[14:02] room and brother beckett took me in
[14:03] another and they washed our feet
[14:06] it was it was remarkable i still to this
[14:08] day can just be moved with the motion
[14:10] and pondered and then having washed our
[14:13] feet and prayed for us they they they
[14:15] got us maybe something to drink and then
[14:16] he walked us out into a garden it was a
[14:18] grove and we sat underneath the
[14:21] greenery and everything and and a
[14:22] beautiful place and i did he have some
[14:24] music playing i think there might i
[14:25] don't know if there's maybe i'm just
[14:26] hearing it maybe my wife was singing to
[14:28] me
[14:29] but he just sat us down he says why
[14:31] don't you two just spend some time
[14:32] together and rest a little bit in this
[14:35] grove or this garden and it went away
[14:37] and he left us there to fellowship and
[14:39] commune with one another and then he
[14:41] came back a little bit later just began
[14:42] to speak to us then he began to prophesy
[14:44] to us tell us what to expect things that
[14:46] were going to happen sure enough it
[14:48] happened exactly like he said it would
[14:49] but it was a wonderful time and it
[14:51] happened there under these trees in this
[14:53] arbor and this grove because that's what
[14:54] is expressed about a garden
[14:57] and trees hold a rich symbolism in the
[14:59] bible the whole symbolism in literature
[15:01] even in humanity there's a lot of ways
[15:03] that trees are expressed in other
[15:05] religions
[15:06] and again this is not just
[15:08] me doing a search on trees and repeating
[15:10] tree trees trees trees trees all over
[15:12] again
[15:13] and then telling you that it's 777
[15:15] inches to that tree out there and
[15:17] getting us all excited but rather it's
[15:19] just to really look deep into
[15:22] what god is meaning in a particular
[15:24] scripture
[15:25] because abraham's tree the tamarisk tree
[15:27] abraham's grove represented a gathering
[15:29] place for fellowship if you say no
[15:32] brother and that's not what it meant
[15:33] that's not what it was it was just an
[15:34] altar it was just a single tree i'm not
[15:36] going to argue with you we're using it
[15:38] as a type
[15:40] a type of community and hospitality was
[15:42] a place where relationships could be
[15:44] formed maybe someone entered in as a
[15:46] stranger but then they they left a
[15:47] brother they left a friend it was a
[15:49] place where connections could be formed
[15:52] our relationships could be formed
[15:53] there's a place where you can cultivate
[15:55] common conviction
[15:57] and ambition and aspiration that you
[15:58] come together you have a common goal you
[16:00] have common ideals and you could gather
[16:02] under that tree and you can inspire one
[16:04] another you can encourage one another
[16:05] and that's what our tree ought to be as
[16:08] christians we have a common ambition
[16:09] which is christ and we're out there on
[16:11] our own on our own as our own families
[16:14] and out there doing things on our own
[16:15] but then when we gather back here on the
[16:17] sunday mornings and wednesday night we
[16:18] have to realize that this is a wonderful
[16:20] opportunity to communicate to one
[16:22] another and to cultivate common uh
[16:25] ambition and
[16:26] and what we're trying to do and
[16:28] encourage one another
[16:30] i was fellowshipping with brother samuel
[16:32] brother ellie
[16:33] and it was just heartbreaking to think
[16:35] of some of the situations that are
[16:36] taking place
[16:38] in families and in churches
[16:40] and how that seems so often and this
[16:42] wasn't their expression it was mine
[16:45] how
[16:45] so often families seem to be completely
[16:48] on their own in church but completely on
[16:50] their own trying to raise their children
[16:52] and say well it's the family that's got
[16:54] the duty and the responsibility to do it
[16:55] it's their fault that the children
[16:57] backslide and it's their fault if they
[16:58] don't hold the standard in the home and
[17:00] i believe that we could all say amen but
[17:03] it's the church's responsibility to
[17:04] support them in that endeavor
[17:07] and if the parents aren't getting
[17:08] support if they're not being taught
[17:10] wisdom if they're not being shown things
[17:12] and encouraged and things and sometimes
[17:14] even being told hey you know what that's
[17:16] just normal it's just a phase every
[17:18] parent has children that do that there's
[17:20] no reason to be embarrassed or just that
[17:22] kind of encouragement support i'll be
[17:24] praying for you looking out after you
[17:27] that's what that's what we ought to be
[17:28] doing for one another
[17:30] our testimony as a family sister
[17:32] elizabeth and our children
[17:34] is that
[17:36] there have been people in our lives that
[17:39] have uh made a difference
[17:41] people in the body of christ that have
[17:42] made a difference in our life
[17:45] uh and and made it that impacted us and
[17:48] then we're being given an opportunity
[17:50] now to impact the children of those very
[17:52] people that made an impact in our lives
[17:54] and then we see those children that we
[17:57] impacted having an impact on our
[17:58] children and that's the way the family
[18:00] ought to work
[18:01] that's the way the church ought to work
[18:04] and it's those fellowship that communion
[18:07] and it says in verse 34
[18:11] i just want to compliment everyone on
[18:12] creating such a wonderful atmosphere by
[18:14] the michael tremendous job the musicians
[18:16] just such a a pleasing atmosphere here
[18:18] today to minister the word
[18:21] and
[18:22] i don't know that this would necessarily
[18:24] be a warning maybe this would just be
[18:26] like
[18:26] uh
[18:28] just get everyone really really excited
[18:30] uh since we're not having wednesday
[18:32] service i'm kind of combining
[18:35] combining services today
[18:37] and so i'm not really combining services
[18:39] but i really want to get all most that
[18:41] we can't out of this but verse 34
[18:43] and abraham so adjourned in the
[18:46] philistines land many days
[18:49] souljarn it's a word actually that i
[18:50] think i never really looked up and
[18:53] researched it but it was just kind of a
[18:54] word that to me meant something and that
[18:56] kind of soldier and to me kind of meant
[18:58] traveling
[18:59] but it actually is kind of the the
[19:01] opposite to soldiering is to take your
[19:03] abode
[19:05] and and he dwelled and inhabited
[19:08] and so there was a there's a it means to
[19:10] continue and actually the word comes
[19:12] from
[19:14] holds the root meaning and it means to
[19:16] seek hospitality with
[19:18] and so when the bible says when he
[19:20] planted a grove and then you realize
[19:21] well maybe the jews weren't off on a
[19:23] limb when they said it was hospitality
[19:24] they're using a very word of hospitality
[19:26] he built a grove and then sought
[19:28] hospitality with the philistines many
[19:30] days
[19:31] in other words it was by the means of
[19:32] this grove he invoked the name of god it
[19:34] was a place of hospitality and when he
[19:36] evolved there he dwelt he inhabited it
[19:38] he continued there and he sought
[19:40] hospitality in this place of the
[19:42] philistines
[19:44] in the land of promise
[19:47] but it was the philistines land the land
[19:49] of the philistines many days so he was
[19:51] not just there temporarily he did not
[19:53] get a hotel hotel room and stream
[19:55] service that night but he put up his
[19:58] tent he built a a grove he had a place
[20:01] of worship and he remained there many
[20:03] days
[20:04] now in hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 to 10
[20:07] i want to use
[20:09] the several verses in hebrews chapter 11
[20:11] just to kind of look on the this other
[20:13] side of abraham's vision and desire by
[20:16] faith abraham when he was called to go
[20:18] out into a place which he should after
[20:20] receive for an inheritance
[20:23] inheritance
[20:24] in the greek is property received is
[20:27] something that's given as a possession
[20:29] so when you receive something by
[20:30] inheritance you typically receive it
[20:32] from a family member family
[20:35] home or family land just passed down and
[20:38] so he was called to go to a place which
[20:41] he would receive for an inheritance it's
[20:43] a family inheritance it's a place that
[20:45] he would receive as inherited
[20:47] as an inheritance as a gift from one uh
[20:50] in his family so this is what he's
[20:52] seeking is an inherited home an
[20:54] inherited land
[20:56] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[20:58] whether he went
[20:59] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[21:02] promise he remained he abided he sought
[21:04] hospitality in the land of promise
[21:07] as in a strange country dwelling in
[21:09] tabernacles with isaac and jacob
[21:12] the heirs with him of the same promise
[21:14] so now notice he is
[21:16] by faith
[21:17] he dwelled in tabernacles with isaac and
[21:20] jacob by faith he lived in tents with
[21:22] his family
[21:23] soul journey these are kindreds who were
[21:25] heirs of this eternal home this as it
[21:28] says that heirs of the same promise for
[21:30] he looked for a city which have
[21:31] foundations whose builder and maker is
[21:34] god what was it the future home
[21:36] the eternal home remember in the series
[21:38] and i know you remember exactly the date
[21:40] the title and everything i said on in
[21:43] the supreme faith of abraham and how
[21:44] that he was looking for the thing that
[21:46] god was revealing to him is i will be a
[21:48] god to thee forever
[21:50] i'm going to give you an inheritance
[21:52] forever i am the everlasting god and at
[21:54] some point abraham could have had this
[21:56] kind of faith to say wait a minute
[21:59] you mean forever
[22:01] it's like so then that means what
[22:03] happens to death and god would have been
[22:05] like
[22:08] you're on to something
[22:10] i don't know how his conversations went
[22:12] but i've had a lot of people tell me
[22:14] stories how they have conversations with
[22:16] god and i can't find that anywhere in
[22:17] the bible where
[22:19] god talks to people the way they say he
[22:20] does
[22:23] and so this is an eternal home that he
[22:26] was seeking for
[22:28] but yet even though he had an eternal
[22:30] home it says by faith he dwelled in
[22:32] tabernacles it's still by faith that he
[22:35] continued
[22:36] remained and abided it's still by faith
[22:39] that he's he's by faith he has a vision
[22:41] of home by faith he sees something
[22:42] eternal but then he has faith to build
[22:44] him a place he has a place of faith that
[22:46] causes him to settle and it says in
[22:48] verse 13 about these forefathers these
[22:51] all died in faith not having received
[22:53] thee promises but having seen them afar
[22:56] off and were persuaded of them and
[22:59] embraced them and confessed notice this
[23:01] phrase that they were strangers and
[23:03] pilgrims on the earth just an immigrant
[23:06] i'm just one that's passing through i
[23:07] have no permanent possession in this
[23:09] land i'm a stranger in a pilgrim i've
[23:12] come from i've left my homeland i've
[23:13] left where my roots are i left where i
[23:15] thought i would be forever and i'm in
[23:17] this place that's strange i have no
[23:18] family connections i have no legacy here
[23:21] i only have a promised future i have
[23:23] nothing to show as far as a title deed
[23:26] or anything but here i am on a promise
[23:28] he says but i'm a stranger and a pilgrim
[23:30] on earth remember that phrase i want to
[23:32] carry it through
[23:35] and so abraham's vision of a future home
[23:37] it was permanent fixed a city that hath
[23:39] foundations
[23:42] this image this is what i want you to
[23:43] catch by faith he sought an inherited
[23:46] place but then by faith
[23:48] he he built dwelling places
[23:51] when he souljourned
[23:52] so it gave him this vision of a future
[23:55] home gave him an image for his earthly
[23:56] dwelling
[23:58] what what he saw his future home to be
[24:01] it gave him a goal and a vision and
[24:03] ambition to pattern himself after that
[24:07] i don't want to just live here loose and
[24:09] indifferent and and live
[24:11] sad and beaten down and unhealthy and
[24:14] kind of take that as my lot in life and
[24:16] then like but one day i'm going to be
[24:17] happy i'm going to be sin free and i'm
[24:20] going to be healthy and then just kind
[24:22] of undergo here until you get there but
[24:24] rather use the vision of the future home
[24:27] and say then that i can pattern what
[24:30] that life will be there i want this life
[24:32] to begin to express and manifest those
[24:35] things
[24:36] it's even what this baptism of the holy
[24:38] ghost is a down payment of and the
[24:40] guarantee of is the blessedness of
[24:42] eternity and perfection
[24:44] and so abraham had that vision of a
[24:46] future home and he could pattern his
[24:48] present home after it and perhaps
[24:49] inspired by it
[24:51] inspired by that vision of eternity he
[24:53] built a grove
[24:55] to serve
[24:56] the purpose of the eternal everlasting
[24:58] one i want you to catch this
[25:01] though a stranger and a pilgrim on earth
[25:04] he built a home
[25:07] even though he was scattered even though
[25:09] he was uh even though he was seemingly
[25:11] didn't couldn't say whether or not he
[25:12] would be here permanently and he didn't
[25:14] lay a foundation and he was always
[25:16] renting and always in a place of tents
[25:18] that could be wrapped up and taken away
[25:20] and move on he's still where he was he
[25:22] built a home
[25:24] even though he was scattered
[25:26] he could soldier
[25:28] i remember father abraham provides an
[25:30] example
[25:32] and so we see this pattern happen when
[25:33] the church begins the body of christ in
[25:35] first peter chapter one
[25:37] verse one
[25:39] it says peter an apostle of jesus christ
[25:42] to the stranger scattered throughout
[25:44] pontus galatia cappadocia asia and
[25:47] bethennia
[25:48] so he's writing this letter
[25:51] to the strangers
[25:53] remember how that
[25:55] the bible paul called abraham and his
[25:57] seed after him strangers and pilgrims
[26:00] now peter is referring to the strangers
[26:01] scattered throughout pontus galatia
[26:04] cappadocia asia and bethennia the word
[26:07] strangers scattered throughout in one
[26:09] translation is soldiers of the
[26:11] dispersion
[26:12] there might be a good band name
[26:14] uh soul journalers of the dispersion
[26:17] and the soul genres of the dispersion
[26:18] the despoor the scattering about looking
[26:21] for a heavenly jerusalem pilgrims and
[26:24] strangers looking for heavenly jerusalem
[26:25] as their home just as abraham had a
[26:28] vision and he went out and he abode and
[26:29] he dwelt and he worshipped god now the
[26:31] christian church is being scattered
[26:33] abroad and they don't go out to galatia
[26:36] or pontus or cappadocia or bethennia and
[26:39] asia being a portion of that asia minor
[26:42] the
[26:42] present-day turkey on the furthermost
[26:44] west part there wasn't it wasn't that
[26:47] they oh well this is where we're forever
[26:49] going to be and this is my lot in life
[26:51] and this is my permanent abode and this
[26:53] is my fixed dwelling
[26:55] they went where god sent them they went
[26:56] where god was placing them
[26:58] and in doing it they realized that one
[27:01] day they have an inheritance in the
[27:03] eternal
[27:05] have any of you ever debated um just uh
[27:08] after you got done talking about the
[27:10] the table at the wedding supper
[27:12] i've debated about what you're going to
[27:13] get in the millennium
[27:15] you've talked about that
[27:17] and
[27:18] sister elizabeth i just believe that
[27:19] because we've come to phoenix and spend
[27:22] out our days here that god's going to
[27:23] give us leelanau peninsula in michigan
[27:26] in the millennium
[27:28] and i don't know if it works that way
[27:30] but it's fun to talk about it
[27:32] i think maybe just fruitless but
[27:34] uh there's an idea that i i'm not
[27:37] looking at whatever takes place here in
[27:38] the 75 to 100 something years that we
[27:40] have on earth that this is going to be
[27:42] the sum and substance and i take my
[27:44] character and i leave a legacy and
[27:45] there's not going to be anything to show
[27:47] for it there's an eternal home that
[27:49] we're going to
[27:52] and so do we have that first map i don't
[27:54] know if that's next and then maybe track
[27:56] the notes in there
[27:59] so we can see this i don't know if
[28:01] you'll be able to see it very well
[28:03] and i kind of apologize for including
[28:05] incongruent maps that i'm using i like
[28:07] to use things that would be
[28:08] um
[28:10] look a little bit better but i found i
[28:11] was spending maybe too much time trying
[28:12] to find a map that i found some that
[28:14] could kind of help i want you to
[28:17] listen to what i'm saying but if you
[28:18] want your eyes to kind of glance at this
[28:20] map and look at this to see
[28:22] the different places that paul mentions
[28:24] in the north there pontus and bethenia
[28:26] galatia in the middle
[28:28] asia to uh
[28:29] to the west cappadocia to the east
[28:32] and and and peter excuse me is
[28:34] describing strangers scattered
[28:36] throughout this area
[28:38] soul journals of the dispersion
[28:40] and it's scattered it means it's driven
[28:42] out of their own land
[28:45] and and moved or driven uh driven out by
[28:48] persecution and being driven out by
[28:50] persecution and circumstance they were
[28:52] seeking a place of refuge in a place of
[28:53] safety and there's a reason why they
[28:55] went
[28:56] and it says in acts chapter 8 verse 1
[28:58] and saul was consenting unto his death
[29:02] and kind of jumping into the the
[29:04] the middle of this it says and at that
[29:05] time this is the part i want you to see
[29:07] and at that time there was a great
[29:08] persecution against the church which was
[29:11] at jerusalem
[29:13] and they were all scattered abroad
[29:15] throughout the regions of judea and
[29:17] samaria except the apostles
[29:20] and so there is a persecution of the
[29:22] church at jerusalem and then what
[29:24] happens is all the believers that had
[29:26] gathered at jerusalem they begin to be
[29:28] persecuted and so they start to scatter
[29:30] a little bit
[29:31] this is what the bible's showing us the
[29:33] scattering because we see the example of
[29:35] abraham traveling down you can actually
[29:36] attract it on this map you can see where
[29:38] abraham began and would have come down
[29:40] and entered into the promised land even
[29:43] going down into egypt and coming back up
[29:45] it's showing that now in the birth of
[29:47] the christian church starting there at
[29:49] jerusalem
[29:50] all these believers because of
[29:53] persecution
[29:54] are scattered through these other
[29:56] regions but the apostles stay
[29:59] so believers are being scattered
[30:02] now in first peter chapter 2 verse 11
[30:04] and you can again just continue to
[30:06] ponder this map dearly beloved i beseech
[30:09] you as strangers and pilgrims
[30:14] abstain from fleshly lust which war
[30:17] against the soul
[30:20] now you can go to these verses here but
[30:22] john and we'll come back to these maps
[30:24] dearly beloved i beseech you as
[30:25] strangers and pilgrims abstained from
[30:27] fleshly lust which war against the soul
[30:31] so again he's beseeching them as
[30:32] pilgrims and strangers
[30:35] dispersed among the world
[30:38] scattered abroad this is how paul refers
[30:40] to the believer in that day in that time
[30:42] strangers and pilgrims dispersed abroad
[30:45] scattered about because of persecution
[30:47] paul acting against the church scatters
[30:49] them abroad that the regions of judea
[30:50] and samaria and now i want you to catch
[30:53] that we're still pilgrims and strangers
[30:56] and there's many many many scriptures
[30:58] and quotes we can use on this and the
[31:00] sermon once more lord
[31:02] brother abraham says lord god may our
[31:04] eyes come open to the fact that he is
[31:07] still the messiah
[31:08] and may we embrace him tonight for we
[31:10] have confessed that we are pilgrims and
[31:13] strangers of this world it says it many
[31:15] many different times although peter was
[31:17] referring to people who were literally
[31:19] of a dysphoria within the christian
[31:21] church
[31:22] and literally christians scattered
[31:24] abroad as it says from judea and sumeria
[31:26] and all all the areas round about and
[31:28] peter even saying they're in cappadocia
[31:30] and they're in asia and bethenny and
[31:32] galatia he says
[31:33] you being strangers and pilgrims and
[31:35] that's true then and it's true today
[31:39] that we are pilgrims and strangers of
[31:40] this world he says this is not our home
[31:42] this is not our land
[31:43] we are a different acting people because
[31:46] we are born from above born again from
[31:49] above
[31:50] and this is
[31:51] i want to continue reading this because
[31:53] it holds such a critical part to what
[31:54] we're saying this morning and we who
[31:56] hold this promise in our heart may we
[31:58] see the promise that jesus made to his
[32:00] church
[32:01] that we would see just prior to his
[32:02] coming as we see the days of noah
[32:04] returning eating drinking marrying given
[32:06] in marriage and the morals of the land
[32:08] then he said as it was in the days of
[32:10] sodom to the gentiles before the fire
[32:11] fell that god came down and was
[32:13] manifested in flesh by knowing the
[32:15] secrets of the hearts of the people and
[32:17] he promised the same thing to return
[32:20] it kind of brings abraham into this
[32:22] image of pilgrims and strangers and
[32:24] god's visitation
[32:26] and so we are pilgrims and strangers
[32:28] like the first church was and we are
[32:30] like abraham
[32:32] we're dwelling even in uh temporal
[32:34] bodies temporary bodies
[32:37] we are dwelling in temporary houses
[32:39] we we do it looking for an eternal body
[32:43] we do it looking for an eternal mansion
[32:45] a place to live an eternal inheritance
[32:48] and it ought to be a comfort to us that
[32:50] when we see the signs of economic
[32:52] downturn when we see the reality of
[32:55] losing things that we hold dear or our
[32:57] 401k is kind of just going to nosedive
[33:00] and everything we save up for is
[33:01] dwindling away and our all the those um
[33:04] alt coins that we thought we'd be able
[33:05] to retire on uh this august are worth
[33:08] nothing
[33:10] there should be some consolation
[33:12] uh that you can always repent and not
[33:14] make the same mistake again
[33:16] and that we have an eternal inheritance
[33:20] it ought to be a consolation to us is it
[33:22] not paul that told us that if we were
[33:24] only living this life christians are the
[33:26] most miserable people
[33:29] and it's amazing how some christians
[33:30] just live the most miserable lives and
[33:32] it's a shame when we want everyone else
[33:34] to be miserable
[33:36] i think sometimes this is just really
[33:38] impressed upon my heart over the last
[33:39] couple days how sometimes we see people
[33:42] that that whether it be family members
[33:44] they fellowship with us they lived with
[33:45] us they went to church with us they
[33:47] confessed the same things we did and
[33:49] they backslide and they go off
[33:51] and it looks like they're living their
[33:52] best life i mean like they are
[33:54] what hipsters aspire to be
[33:57] and we we want to say we want to say oh
[34:00] you're miserable
[34:01] you're not happy you must be totally
[34:03] miserable what if they're totally happy
[34:07] what if what if they are finally free
[34:09] and living their best life because
[34:10] remember this is by election
[34:15] and if someone who doesn't have the seed
[34:16] of god
[34:18] with the with the the the perversions
[34:20] that exist and the manipulations and the
[34:22] tortures that people use the bible to
[34:24] inflict upon other people they are
[34:27] miserable because they've never
[34:28] experienced the grace of god they only
[34:30] experience the legalism of man and man
[34:33] legally is trying to make them seed when
[34:35] they're not that produces people who are
[34:38] crazy who are depressed who are manic
[34:41] who who can't find peace except they
[34:43] experience the love of god from those
[34:45] who actually have it
[34:47] and they get away from toxic cultures
[34:49] and toxic environments like no i really
[34:51] am happy you know what i find in my
[34:53] heart thinking i'm glad they are
[34:56] i want them to be free from
[34:58] depression i want them to be free from
[35:00] affliction i want them to be free from
[35:02] sorrow i want them to be free from from
[35:04] anxiety and if they can have that god
[35:06] bless them and if they're elect they're
[35:08] coming right back to what they left
[35:11] and the only way they're going to want
[35:12] to come to it is if we're salty enough
[35:14] and christ-like enough and have a door
[35:16] open enough that's a place where they
[35:18] could come to find him
[35:24] and so we are like abraham
[35:26] looking for something eternal
[35:28] and as abraham planted a grove in the
[35:31] wilderness of beersheba in the land of
[35:33] the philistines
[35:35] god will provide for us a place
[35:39] this is where i get my thought and the
[35:41] title came from god will
[35:44] because i i i was there's ways you look
[35:46] at it well the tree represents christ
[35:48] the tree represents the church well
[35:50] abraham represents adam or he represents
[35:52] god and you're thinking man you can just
[35:53] type anything any way you want well
[35:56] yeah you're free to do whatever you want
[35:57] i guess
[35:58] but i i see the truth
[36:00] and i catch the principle in god's word
[36:02] and then the types can be used and
[36:04] emerged because at the end of the day
[36:05] you say well maybe that's not a good
[36:06] type the truth remains
[36:08] the truth remains
[36:10] and what i began to real when i the way
[36:12] i looked at it is i couldn't put myself
[36:15] i could put myself in the place of
[36:16] abraham
[36:18] but then i put myself in the place of
[36:19] abraham's seed in what abraham did for
[36:22] isaac and what he was doing for jacob
[36:24] and what he was doing for his seed and i
[36:26] saw abraham acting as god
[36:30] implanting a grove
[36:32] for a place for his son to worship
[36:34] planting a grove for all the other
[36:37] those who would come to know him a place
[36:40] that they could gather
[36:41] to have common fellowship
[36:44] so just as we are
[36:46] strangers and pilgrims and abraham a
[36:48] stranger pilgrim planted a place
[36:50] in the land of philistines he's promised
[36:53] to provide for you a place that you can
[36:55] call home
[37:00] now we can look at these maps again
[37:01] consider the elect scattered throughout
[37:04] pontus galatia cappadocia asia and
[37:07] bethennia
[37:09] god's sheep were scattered
[37:11] for different reasons
[37:13] spread out all over asia minor and even
[37:16] further abroad and it's some of the
[37:17] references you find in scripture and
[37:20] some of the the convictions and beliefs
[37:22] based upon that the furthest reaches
[37:23] that maybe some of the apostles went
[37:25] it's it's a marvel it's a marvel to
[37:28] something to marvel at when you consider
[37:30] just how far the gospel was spreading
[37:32] then
[37:33] and
[37:34] to look at this and we know that the the
[37:36] when the holy spirit fell on the day of
[37:38] pentecost when i want to come to that
[37:40] and the church began to grow from there
[37:42] paul accounts of this in acts chapter 18
[37:44] verses 1 to 3. we believe luke writing
[37:47] and after these things paul departed
[37:49] from athens and came to court again i
[37:51] just want you to ponder the map as you
[37:52] listen to these places and found a
[37:54] certain jew named aquila born in pontus
[37:59] lately come from italy with his wife
[38:02] priscilla
[38:03] so here's a man who was born in pontus
[38:05] which would be at the north of asia
[38:07] minor but then he immigrated and moved
[38:09] to italy but then the bible says because
[38:11] he says lately he come from italy but
[38:14] then it says because that claudius had
[38:16] commanded all jews to depart from rome
[38:19] so here's someone born in one place
[38:21] moves to another place and now he is
[38:23] departed and he finds himself in in
[38:25] another region and it paul just happens
[38:28] to come to him and paul comes to them
[38:31] come in corinth and came to them and
[38:33] because he was of the same craft paul
[38:36] being a tent maker he aboled with them
[38:38] and wrought for by their occupation they
[38:40] were tit-makers
[38:43] and i guess it blessed me to see this in
[38:45] that abraham would have constructed a
[38:47] tent and raised a tent as pilgrims and
[38:49] strangers and here's paul making tents
[38:51] making dwelling places making
[38:53] tabernacles together with aquila
[38:57] began in pontus move to rome now moved
[38:59] to corinth
[39:00] god moves his people for different
[39:02] reasons
[39:04] but when they were in corinth paul had a
[39:05] place to come and abide
[39:08] god had a provided a place even for paul
[39:11] and then later in the same chapter
[39:13] speaking of apollos who was born in
[39:15] alexandria
[39:16] and then came to ephesus it says and
[39:18] they be he began to speak boldly in the
[39:20] synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla
[39:22] had heard they took him unto them and so
[39:25] they take him into their home and
[39:26] expounded unto him the way of god more
[39:29] perfectly
[39:31] this is the one born in pontus living in
[39:33] italy now migrating back
[39:37] in first corinthians chapter 16 verse 19
[39:39] now i'm just going through some of these
[39:41] verses we've used before but kind of
[39:42] look at this where everyone's spreading
[39:44] and recognize this common thing
[39:46] scattered throughout but notice what's
[39:48] happening
[39:49] paul says the churches of asia salute
[39:51] you
[39:52] aquila and priscilla salute you much in
[39:54] the lord with the church that is in
[39:56] their house so it's churches of asia
[39:58] we say asia again you notice it's on it
[40:00] would be
[40:01] uh it wouldn't be all of asia that we
[40:03] would refer to today as a continent but
[40:05] this this one part
[40:07] on the western coast
[40:09] colossians chapter 4 verse 15 salute the
[40:11] brethren which are in laodicea and
[40:13] nymphus and the church which is in his
[40:16] house
[40:17] in galatians it speaks about the
[40:18] churches of galatia and paul writes to
[40:21] philemon in verse 2. the church in the
[40:23] house together with his brothers
[40:26] in acts chapter 14 verse 23 and when
[40:28] they had ordained them elders in every
[40:30] church so there's churches of asia
[40:33] there's churches throughout these
[40:34] different areas and they had to ordain
[40:37] pastors in every church
[40:41] paul wasn't going around setting up live
[40:43] streams
[40:46] in acts chapter 15 verse 41 and he went
[40:48] through syria and cilicia confirming the
[40:51] churches
[40:52] so again now this is in syria and and
[40:54] celestia
[40:57] in acts chapter 16 verse 5 and so were
[40:59] the churches established in the faith
[41:02] and increased in number daily
[41:05] in ii corinthians chapter eight verse
[41:07] one see if you can find it on the map it
[41:08] says moreover brethren we do
[41:10] we do you to wit of the grace of god
[41:12] bestowed on the churches of macedonia
[41:16] if god called amanda macedonia don't you
[41:18] think they're just wouldn't he just call
[41:19] them to the whole church a whole place
[41:21] in macedonia it should only be one
[41:23] church in macedonia but there was
[41:25] churches of macedonia
[41:27] revelations chapter 1 verse 11 saying i
[41:29] am alpha and omega here christ speaking
[41:31] the first and last and what thou seest
[41:34] write in a book and send it unto thee
[41:36] seven churches which are in asia there
[41:38] were seven literal churches in ephesus
[41:41] smyrna pergamus thytira
[41:43] sardis philadelphia and laodicea wasn't
[41:46] just one mega church wasn't just one
[41:47] pastor
[41:49] but they all served the true church
[41:53] and as you look at this and pondered
[41:54] this
[41:56] why would god establish churches in
[41:58] these places
[42:00] why would we read through and find that
[42:02] there was churches in pontus galatians
[42:03] cappadocia asia bethennia uh in corinth
[42:08] and
[42:08] in ephesus
[42:10] and in laodicea
[42:13] and syria and cilician macedonia and
[42:16] phytaira and sardis philadelphia
[42:18] pergamos smyrna all these places why
[42:21] would there be churches in all these
[42:22] different places there's ways that we
[42:24] could track the
[42:25] paul's travels and find there's a lot of
[42:27] other places you can see where churches
[42:29] were being established why would all
[42:31] these places have a church and then god
[42:33] ordained an elder in that church
[42:36] because it's where god was placed as
[42:37] elect
[42:39] that's where the elect went so god was
[42:41] establishing a place for the elect
[42:43] to where they would not be on their own
[42:45] they would not be alone but there would
[42:46] be a place
[42:48] a grove where they could worship
[42:50] you see where all this began in acts
[42:52] chapter 2 verses 4 to 12 this is very
[42:54] beautiful and they were all filled the
[42:55] holy ghost this is the day of pentecost
[42:57] they were 112 120 gathered in the upper
[43:00] room and began to speak with other
[43:02] tongues as a spirit gave them utterance
[43:05] and there were dwelling at jerusalem
[43:07] jews devout men out of every nation
[43:10] under heaven
[43:12] now when his this was noised abroad the
[43:14] multitude came together and were
[43:16] confounded because that every man heard
[43:18] them speak in his own language
[43:20] and they were all amazed and marveled
[43:22] saying one to another behold are not all
[43:24] these which speak galileans
[43:27] and how here we every man in our own
[43:30] tongue wherein we were born so they were
[43:32] born elsewhere but now we're in
[43:34] jerusalem
[43:36] and some say they living there
[43:39] they dwelled there some others saying
[43:40] they're visiting at the time of the
[43:42] passover and i could certainly say it
[43:43] would be true that they may be devout
[43:45] men jews living as the bible says
[43:47] proselytes to the faith or jews
[43:50] themselves who had lived there and
[43:52] migrated there and then others who may
[43:53] have come for the passover but now in
[43:55] this one place they're hearing the word
[43:57] of god preach they're hearing this
[43:59] remarkable move of god and it says we
[44:02] hear every man in our own wherein we
[44:04] were born parthians and needs and
[44:06] elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia
[44:09] and in judea and cappadocia in pontus in
[44:12] asia
[44:13] phrygia and pamphlea in egypt in the
[44:15] parts of libya about cyrene and
[44:17] strangers of rome jews and proselytes
[44:20] cretes and arabians we do hear them
[44:22] speak in our tongues the wonderful works
[44:24] of god
[44:26] think of all these places and they were
[44:27] all amazed and were doubt saying one
[44:29] another what meaneth this
[44:32] so they all came to one place and began
[44:34] to see god fulfill his word hear a
[44:35] gospel
[44:36] here jesus christ preached and then what
[44:38] happens from here
[44:40] if you look at this
[44:42] this is what we just read
[44:44] from this one place they hear the word
[44:46] of god and then it says the the the
[44:49] believers were scattered abroad
[44:51] throughout the regions of judea and
[44:53] whether they had come for the passover
[44:55] and heard the truth and then left or
[44:57] they were dwelling there when they were
[44:58] persecuted they all went back
[45:01] to the places they lived
[45:02] before and all of a sudden from one
[45:05] epicenter you could see where it starts
[45:08] in jerusalem and they go back to egypt
[45:10] and libya in crete and rome and they
[45:13] spread out each one of these believers
[45:15] branching off
[45:17] and this is how the faith was propagated
[45:20] like seeds from a tree
[45:23] and the winds of persecution and winds
[45:25] of change and winds of leadership and
[45:27] god calling people either back home or
[45:29] to other places to seek safety this is
[45:31] how the faith was established and spread
[45:33] and dispersed the the elect heard the
[45:35] word where they were but when they were
[45:37] placed by god and sent out the word went
[45:40] with them and when they found themselves
[45:42] in galatia in pontus and all these other
[45:44] places god there would plant a grove
[45:49] where the elect could gather around the
[45:50] word
[45:52] god dispersed the elect
[45:54] but he always provided a home
[45:56] a place that could speak about and lift
[45:59] up and reflect
[46:01] their future home
[46:04] now in jeremiah chapter 23 verses 1 to 6
[46:06] i'm going to read through this
[46:08] and i want you just to catch the image
[46:11] of god's promise
[46:15] to you
[46:17] jeremiah chapter 23 verses 1 to 6.
[46:23] and again there's much that we could
[46:24] expound on this
[46:26] but in this image of scattering
[46:29] peter said they're scattered abroad
[46:32] luke ryden scattered abroad everyone
[46:34] scattered but where they ended up god
[46:36] provided a place
[46:38] it says well be unto the pastors that
[46:40] destroy and scatter the sheep of my
[46:42] pasture
[46:44] saith the lord therefore thus saith the
[46:46] lord god of israel against the pastors
[46:48] that feed my people
[46:49] you have scattered my flock and driven
[46:52] them away and have not visited them
[46:55] behold i will visit upon you the evil of
[46:57] your doing saith the lord
[46:59] and i will gather the remnant of my
[47:02] flock out of all countries whether i
[47:04] have driven them and i will bring them
[47:06] again to their folds and they shall be
[47:09] fruitful and increase what a beautiful
[47:12] callback to the garden of eden and i
[47:14] will set up shepherds over them which
[47:16] shall feed them and they shall fear no
[47:19] more nor be dismayed neither shall they
[47:21] be lacking saith the lord what beautiful
[47:24] language what a beautiful promise to us
[47:26] and how often some of us have looked to
[47:28] this scriptures god's promise to me as a
[47:30] believer that he promised he would feed
[47:32] me he promised he would care for me he
[47:34] promised he would give me substance that
[47:36] he would feed the word to me this is a
[47:38] promise that he gave me and then it
[47:40] it blends into a prophecy of christ
[47:42] behold the days come said lord that i
[47:44] will raise unto david who was a shepherd
[47:47] a righteous branch
[47:50] remember this image of a family tree
[47:52] coming out of david christ is that
[47:55] branch christ is that tree and the king
[47:58] shall reign and prosper david was a
[48:00] shepherd who became a king christ is the
[48:02] image of this tree as a shepherd as a
[48:04] king and shall execute judgment and
[48:06] justice in the earth
[48:08] and in his days judas shall be saved and
[48:11] israel shall dwell safely and this is
[48:14] his name whereby he shall be called the
[48:16] lord our righteousness
[48:19] the tree the tree of righteousness
[48:21] christ is the branch christ is the
[48:23] shepherd christ is the king and this
[48:26] prophecy prophecy is connected to what
[48:28] god is going to do when he takes
[48:30] scattered sheep and brings them to their
[48:33] fold where they'll be fruitful and
[48:35] increase and be fed and fear no more
[48:37] don't be dismayed nor be lacking it's
[48:40] going to be where they raises up a
[48:41] shepherd and provides a branch and
[48:43] provides a place of shelter and safety
[48:46] i will gather my flock in our spiritual
[48:49] sense the elect and bring them to their
[48:51] folds they will have a home
[48:54] flock here is a reference to pastoral
[48:56] sheep
[48:57] and and all animals within a breed are
[49:00] related
[49:02] strictly speaking
[49:03] and according to the law in leviticus 19
[49:06] 19 thou shalt not let thy cattle gender
[49:08] with diverse kind
[49:10] the image is not just some hodgepodge of
[49:12] a of different species mixed together in
[49:15] a whole you know different things
[49:18] and you got a cow you got an ox you've
[49:20] got a goat you've got a giraffe you've
[49:22] got a rhino just all kind of gathering
[49:24] along no it would have been a this
[49:25] homogenous
[49:27] herd of
[49:28] sheep and then and and the purity they
[49:32] would gender them together of their kind
[49:33] they would be the same seed the same
[49:35] family that's what's seen in this flock
[49:37] that are scattered about these sheep
[49:39] that are driven out and i'm going to
[49:41] bring them back to it's his flock so
[49:44] they're of his seed
[49:45] and i'm gonna bring them to their folds
[49:47] it's a place of abode a habitation
[49:50] notice the language of the scripture it
[49:52] says it's gonna be a safe place to dwell
[49:55] a place of rest and provision under his
[49:57] branches under his care
[50:00] place to be cared for just read what it
[50:02] says here in this scripture it's a place
[50:03] to be cared for
[50:07] a place to be fruitful
[50:09] place to increase
[50:11] a place to be washed to fear
[50:14] i'm going to bring them back and in
[50:15] their fold they're going to be washed to
[50:16] fear and it says neither shall they be
[50:18] dismayed this is a very beautiful uh
[50:20] promise because it says it's going to be
[50:22] a place of healing they're healed of
[50:24] their dismay which is a brokenness
[50:30] neither shall they be lacking
[50:33] under this righteous branch under this
[50:35] righteous tree there will be a place of
[50:37] safety security justice
[50:39] judgment
[50:41] it's a place reflecting home
[50:43] where the king is
[50:46] and let me say this i'm making a turn
[50:48] and i feel that i'm
[50:50] i'm rounding second on my way to home in
[50:51] an inside the park home run
[50:54] that
[50:55] this is what our house is ought to be
[50:58] for our families today
[51:00] this is these scriptures are speaking of
[51:02] what as a shepherd in the home as a
[51:04] pastor home as a father in a home this
[51:05] is my this is my image a place of home a
[51:08] place called home brother brandman
[51:10] question and answers part four we'll
[51:11] amplify this more in the future make
[51:13] your home nice
[51:15] make your home a place where your
[51:16] daughter or son will not be ashamed to
[51:18] bring their company before their father
[51:19] and mother and into their house make
[51:22] homes so happy that they'll be pleased
[51:24] in their home to stay there
[51:26] this is what home want to be
[51:29] we say a place called home i was going
[51:30] to take time today to expound upon how
[51:33] there's a difference between a house and
[51:34] a home
[51:36] a vast difference between a house and a
[51:38] home this can just be a house it can
[51:40] just be a gathering place where people
[51:41] come they hear word priests and they
[51:43] just leave and they feel no connection
[51:44] they feel no benefit they're not getting
[51:46] all the things they ought to and people
[51:48] can treat this as a house but you won't
[51:50] get the benefits until it's made a home
[51:52] and you treat it like a home
[51:56] and so this is what we ought to aspire
[51:58] to have in
[52:00] our homes
[52:01] as as parents make your home a nice
[52:04] place a happy place
[52:06] and that's what this church ought to be
[52:08] for believers today a place called home
[52:11] brother braham says in a message
[52:12] uncertain sound but in the church house
[52:13] he's talking about how he preached a
[52:14] meeting in five nights and
[52:16] some uh in some sort of conventional
[52:19] arena he says he likes to be in a church
[52:21] but in the church house i believe the
[52:22] angels of god encamp around because of
[52:25] saints gathering there
[52:27] it's a noted place for god
[52:30] where he comes and meets with his people
[52:35] that's what this is
[52:37] that's what the sanctuary is
[52:39] that's what we're doing on sundays and i
[52:41] want our children to hear this that when
[52:42] we say we're going to church we're not
[52:44] just coming to church to see brother
[52:45] lucas
[52:47] we're coming to church because this is
[52:48] where god meets us
[52:50] we're coming to church because he meets
[52:52] us here he says it's a place where he
[52:53] comes and meets with his people it's
[52:55] always seemed kindly good to me to be in
[52:58] church
[52:59] i like it better it's on my in a church
[53:01] place and instead of an arena so you can
[53:03] be a and he says it seems like at home
[53:07] i know it's just a fragment but i wonder
[53:09] if he was going to say family
[53:12] it seems like at home you know it's
[53:14] where we just fellowship together and
[53:16] have things in common
[53:18] that's what church ought to be
[53:20] church ought to have the feelings of
[53:22] home the sentiments of home
[53:25] the restoration of the bride tree
[53:26] brother graham's praying before he
[53:27] preaches a message on the bride tree the
[53:30] restoration of the bride tree he says
[53:31] bless this little church help me lord as
[53:33] i go to bring the message to other
[53:35] people and may we together like one
[53:38] person one family stick together and
[53:41] pray together and live together in holy
[53:43] unity of the holy spirit until jesus
[53:45] receives us into his kingdom for we ask
[53:46] in his name and for his glory amen
[53:49] that's what church ought to be a place
[53:51] where we together like one person and
[53:54] one family stick together pray together
[53:56] live together in holy unity of the holy
[53:58] spirit that's what church ought to be
[54:03] just as these believers were scattered
[54:05] throughout all
[54:07] all over that region in that area they
[54:09] were not just left alone there was a
[54:11] place where god planted a church there
[54:13] was a place where god ordained elders
[54:15] there was a place that they could gather
[54:16] with those other precious saints and
[54:19] have things in common and lift up the
[54:21] word of god and lift up a common
[54:22] ambition read the letters of paul
[54:24] together hear the word of god preach it
[54:26] was a place that god provided for them
[54:28] and i believe that today there must be a
[54:30] place on earth that can promote the
[54:32] highest of heaven
[54:35] there must be a place where christ is
[54:37] lifted up
[54:39] there's
[54:40] many different quotes and if you're
[54:42] familiar with uh with them
[54:44] then you could just say you could say
[54:46] amen when i strike that cord but home
[54:49] life is
[54:50] broken home life isn't uh uh uncertain
[54:55] the security of the home is broken
[54:57] and i put it my the words i'm using now
[54:59] the the family tree has been cut down
[55:03] it's been completely torn apart
[55:06] to where we all live such separate lives
[55:10] even to where it's striking and don't
[55:12] amen too loud because then you might
[55:13] think you're talking about the neighbors
[55:14] in the department next door
[55:16] but there's families believing families
[55:19] that come to church husbands and wives
[55:22] that live completely separate lives
[55:25] than with each other because this one
[55:26] does their thing this one does their
[55:28] thing and it's just like they convene at
[55:29] night when they go to bed
[55:31] but in the morning they're going right
[55:32] back apart again and then the children
[55:35] themselves they are broken up they do
[55:37] this they do that they do this they do
[55:39] that there's no family time together
[55:40] there's no family meal time there's no
[55:42] family unity there's no family
[55:43] involvement everyone has their own
[55:45] little things that they're doing and you
[55:46] don't even have to go into another room
[55:48] to do it you can all just sit at the
[55:49] same table and do it now
[55:51] because everybody has a screen
[55:55] and it's uh the whole concept of family
[55:58] time family togetherness it's been
[56:00] rejected
[56:02] the world doesn't value it
[56:05] like it once did
[56:07] and this is in the image of the fall
[56:09] and you know i'm realizing now i may
[56:11] have bit off a little bit more than i
[56:12] could chew and i
[56:13] i don't know okay well you can stay
[56:16] um
[56:17] but i'm just starting to i'm starting to
[56:19] wonder just where we're at as far as
[56:20] time
[56:21] because i really really want to um
[56:24] emphasize something here because there's
[56:26] in the something in the image of the
[56:27] fall
[56:30] that that has is climaxing in the day
[56:32] that the time that we're living in now
[56:35] in genesis chapter 4 verses 16 and 17
[56:38] after cain
[56:39] is
[56:41] uh punished it says and cain went out
[56:43] from the presence of the lord isn't that
[56:45] remarkable
[56:46] you say the presence of the lord was in
[56:48] this a particular place it was towards
[56:50] the presence of the lord there was
[56:51] something
[56:53] very special
[56:55] about this area that they were in even
[56:57] though there were severance guarding the
[56:58] way that you couldn't get to the tree of
[56:59] life that it still denoted something
[57:02] about god something to keep god in your
[57:04] conscience and so when he went out from
[57:06] the presence of the lord god's speaking
[57:07] to him and he leaves him
[57:11] and and i realized now in cutting some
[57:12] of the things out that i did last night
[57:14] we know that the presence of god is
[57:16] declared by the voice of god
[57:19] and and so it was where the voice where
[57:21] the voice of god is lifted up that's
[57:23] where his presence is declared so he's
[57:25] fleeing from that and it says he dwelt
[57:27] in the land of nod
[57:28] this is just aimless no ambition on the
[57:31] east of eden
[57:32] and cain knew his wife and she conceived
[57:34] and bare enoch
[57:36] and now
[57:38] notice this contrast and he builded a
[57:41] city
[57:42] and called the name of the city
[57:44] after the name of his son enoch
[57:47] now think of how vastly different this
[57:50] is of abraham
[57:52] who after his son is born
[57:54] he planted a grove
[57:56] and called
[57:58] on the name of the lord
[58:00] but now cain has a son and immediately
[58:02] he builds a city not planting a grove
[58:05] but he builds a city and he calls the
[58:08] name of the city after his son enoch
[58:11] and a city was a place at the time you
[58:13] didn't need a city there was no reason
[58:15] to have a city
[58:16] there was no need to have civilization
[58:19] and all these other things but a city
[58:20] was a place that was guarded by watch
[58:23] you put up walls you built things
[58:25] strategically so you could be on watch
[58:27] and he built it because of fear
[58:29] he built it because of terror and you
[58:30] know what struck me and i never quite
[58:32] looked at it this way cain built the
[58:34] city to protect himself from people like
[58:36] himself
[58:39] the only reason why you need the only
[58:41] reason why kane needed to build a city
[58:42] is in case there was other canes out
[58:44] there
[58:45] you don't have to worry about adam you
[58:47] didn't have to worry about his mom you'd
[58:48] have to worry about all these other it
[58:49] was cain had to protect himself from
[58:51] cain
[58:53] but through his fear and his paranoia
[58:55] civilization he began to read what the
[58:57] the artificers and the workings and what
[58:59] they began to do and musical instruments
[59:01] all these things this is cain's idea
[59:03] civilization protection entertainment
[59:05] always he begins to build it toward
[59:07] climaxes in genesis 6 11 12 the earth
[59:09] also was corrupted before god and the
[59:11] earth was filled with violence and god
[59:13] looked upon the earth and behold it was
[59:15] corrupt and all flesh had corrupted his
[59:17] way upon the earth
[59:19] all begins with cain being ushered out
[59:22] having a son enoch and then he's afraid
[59:24] of all these other uh
[59:26] siblings and all this other family in
[59:29] the world he says we better build a city
[59:32] and he builds a city he doesn't call
[59:34] upon the name of the lord he doesn't
[59:35] begin to honor god what does he do he
[59:36] calls it names it after his son
[59:39] it's a legacy to man it's a legacy to
[59:41] himself it's all born out of ambition
[59:43] and fear
[59:45] needed to protect himself
[59:47] and then we see the conclusion of that
[59:49] kind of thought process and the
[59:50] intermingling for the whole earth is
[59:52] corrupt the earth is filled with
[59:53] violence and all flesh had corrupted his
[59:56] way upon the earth except for one man
[59:57] noah
[1:00:00] and that's exactly the condition of the
[1:00:02] world today
[1:00:04] the climax of satan's seeds that he was
[1:00:07] sowing in genesis 4.
[1:00:09] as the bible says in luke chapter 17
[1:00:11] verses 26 to 32
[1:00:14] it says as it was in the days of noah so
[1:00:16] shall it be in the days of the son of
[1:00:18] man
[1:00:19] they did eat they drank
[1:00:22] now again i'd like to point out and this
[1:00:24] has been done
[1:00:25] a brazilian times let's just do it one
[1:00:27] more time
[1:00:28] they ate they drank they married wives
[1:00:30] they were given in marriage
[1:00:32] well let's just try to pick that apart
[1:00:33] and figure out what's wrong with that
[1:00:35] but it's it's what's denoted in the days
[1:00:38] of noah
[1:00:40] until the day that noah entered in the
[1:00:41] ark and the flood came and destroyed
[1:00:42] them all we're right back again in the
[1:00:44] days of noah
[1:00:45] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:00:47] lot it's interesting he points out the
[1:00:49] days of lot both times of judgment but
[1:00:51] in this case he leaves out abraham
[1:00:54] but he's bringing us to that time
[1:00:56] because there's a mystery contained in
[1:00:58] here they did eat they drank they bought
[1:01:00] they sold they planted they build it i
[1:01:02] don't know if anybody built today or
[1:01:04] planted today but maybe some of us have
[1:01:06] eaten or drank something
[1:01:10] maybe you've bought
[1:01:11] maybe you've sold
[1:01:13] thanks to craigslist or ebay
[1:01:16] but in the same day that lot went out of
[1:01:18] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:01:20] heaven and destroyed them all think of
[1:01:21] how god christ is choosing to
[1:01:23] characterize the daily activities of man
[1:01:27] in this time
[1:01:28] of judgment
[1:01:30] and here verse 30 even thus shall it be
[1:01:33] in the day when the son of man is
[1:01:35] revealed
[1:01:37] so what's going to happen when the son
[1:01:38] of man is getting revealed people are
[1:01:39] going to be eating drinking sleeping
[1:01:41] waking working planting buying buildings
[1:01:43] selling doing all sorts of stuff
[1:01:45] marrying
[1:01:46] all that's going to take place just
[1:01:48] people living and
[1:01:49] living aimlessly like cain was building
[1:01:52] civilizations doing what would happen in
[1:01:54] genesis chapter 6 all these things are
[1:01:56] going to be happened but then god is
[1:01:58] going to reveal himself
[1:01:59] so as it was in the days of lot so then
[1:02:01] we have the image of sodom and the days
[1:02:03] of lot but there's another type to that
[1:02:05] there's another scene where it says even
[1:02:07] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[1:02:08] of man is revealed
[1:02:10] and then prophesying and the nearness of
[1:02:13] this i think is very important
[1:02:14] prophesying the days of the siege of
[1:02:16] jerusalem it says in that day he which
[1:02:18] shall be upon the house top and his
[1:02:20] stuff in the house let him not come down
[1:02:22] to take it away take what the stuff in
[1:02:24] the house
[1:02:26] he that is in the field let him likewise
[1:02:28] not return back he is now brought up in
[1:02:30] that prophecy he's raised something
[1:02:33] about the working the planking the
[1:02:35] building the selling the marion and all
[1:02:36] those things that becomes the
[1:02:38] distraction he says remember lot's wife
[1:02:41] because when she left sodom there was
[1:02:44] something that remained there that kept
[1:02:46] her heart
[1:02:48] that kept her attention
[1:02:51] in all these labors of planting building
[1:02:53] drinking buying selling there's
[1:02:55] something that was missing there's
[1:02:56] something about what they're doing and
[1:02:58] these days that's connected to the heart
[1:03:00] of cain who went out from the presence
[1:03:02] of the lord and built the city not to
[1:03:04] honor god not as a place to worship god
[1:03:06] but a place to honor himself and to
[1:03:08] preserve his legacy after him
[1:03:10] so christ says in that day if you're on
[1:03:13] the housetop don't go down
[1:03:15] and i like i was just and his stuff
[1:03:18] that's what this all that's that's all
[1:03:20] we have is just stuff
[1:03:22] in our houses what is it you have that
[1:03:24] that really really nice expensive
[1:03:26] comforter you bought it's just stuff
[1:03:30] our whole house is just one big junk
[1:03:32] drawer
[1:03:35] at least my garage is
[1:03:37] it's just stuff
[1:03:40] and i challenge you this week to get rid
[1:03:42] of 100 items and you'll find just how
[1:03:43] much you love stuff
[1:03:48] why would he say this
[1:03:50] it's not the stuff the possessions in
[1:03:52] the house we ought to be concerned with
[1:03:54] he that is in the field in his labor all
[1:03:56] worried about his job what are you
[1:03:58] worried about your job for
[1:04:00] is that more important is that what has
[1:04:02] the preeminence is that what drives you
[1:04:03] is that what motivates you
[1:04:05] it's not those things we ought to be
[1:04:06] concerned about
[1:04:08] christ is bringing this up and these
[1:04:10] things of planting buying buildings
[1:04:11] selling all these things and then he
[1:04:13] uses this image and the day that the son
[1:04:15] of man is revealed and he kind of
[1:04:16] inserts this prophecy the siege of titus
[1:04:18] and then he brings it right back
[1:04:20] remembers lot's wife he's wanted us to
[1:04:22] consider what motivates us what drives
[1:04:24] us what has the premise what has greater
[1:04:26] value does the promise or does the
[1:04:27] pleasure
[1:04:30] does his presence or is it your position
[1:04:40] our purpose is greater than possessions
[1:04:44] brother braham says in flashing red
[1:04:45] light are the signs of his coming he
[1:04:46] says the red lights are flashing and the
[1:04:48] time is at hand
[1:04:50] as it was in the days of noah see they
[1:04:52] took the legitimate thing and perverted
[1:04:54] it
[1:04:55] they took eating
[1:04:57] and they took drinking they put building
[1:04:59] and they put all these other things and
[1:05:01] perverted so there's a perversion they
[1:05:03] perverted it wasn't just the act of
[1:05:05] eating that's all fast it wasn't just
[1:05:07] the active drinking let's all die of
[1:05:08] dehydration no it's in the perverting of
[1:05:11] it
[1:05:12] and i love how he says this jesus
[1:05:14] expects us to build a home
[1:05:18] he expects us to build a home and
[1:05:20] remember as men we're homebuilders as
[1:05:22] sisters your homemakers we have a
[1:05:24] responsibility not to literally go out
[1:05:26] and buy a plot of land and build a house
[1:05:28] but to whatever where we live where we
[1:05:30] reside to turn that dwelling into a home
[1:05:33] to make this church which is a gathering
[1:05:35] place make it a home week jesus expects
[1:05:37] us to build but just look what has taken
[1:05:40] place in that
[1:05:41] look at what church has become today
[1:05:43] christianity today christianity is a
[1:05:45] mean to the world
[1:05:46] they laugh at it they tr they troll the
[1:05:49] christians of today
[1:05:51] he says eating he expects us to eat
[1:05:53] that's right look well look what's
[1:05:54] taking place in that he goes on
[1:05:56] continues on with the drinking that
[1:05:58] there's things that we have to do
[1:06:00] there's things of necessity but look how
[1:06:02] it gets perverted
[1:06:06] so he finishes that chapter luke 17
[1:06:08] verse 37
[1:06:09] as he's saying there's going to be
[1:06:12] going to be those taken and they're like
[1:06:14] where where where wheresoever the body
[1:06:16] is feather will the eagles be gathered
[1:06:19] together
[1:06:22] not gathered around stuff
[1:06:25] not gathered around jobs
[1:06:28] not gathered around eating planting
[1:06:30] buying selling not gathering around all
[1:06:31] those things but gathered around the
[1:06:33] word because that's where eagles gather
[1:06:37] it's prophesied that there is a
[1:06:39] gathering place for his elect there's a
[1:06:40] place of provision
[1:06:42] there's a place of rest there's a place
[1:06:44] of shelter that's what's the image in
[1:06:45] jeremiah 23 in the flock that was once
[1:06:48] scattered is then going to be all
[1:06:49] brought scattered it's amazing when you
[1:06:51] look at sheep that if sheep
[1:06:53] they're such a remarkable animal that
[1:06:56] it's it's necessary that they have
[1:06:59] someone
[1:07:00] that could
[1:07:01] shorn them and shave them
[1:07:03] or that can get to a point to where
[1:07:05] their wool grows so much it can lead to
[1:07:07] their death
[1:07:08] they can't see they can't eat they it'll
[1:07:11] actually kill them unless they have
[1:07:12] someone looking out over them and
[1:07:14] watching over them so these ones that
[1:07:15] are scattered they're not supposed to be
[1:07:17] on their own they're not supposed to be
[1:07:18] out here they're not supposed to be out
[1:07:19] there he says i'm going to bring them to
[1:07:21] folds places of habitation where they
[1:07:23] can dwell safely they can dwell
[1:07:24] peaceably and they can receive justice
[1:07:26] what is that know what their value and
[1:07:29] know their worth
[1:07:31] so many times we take justice in the
[1:07:33] sense of legalism
[1:07:35] your skirts are too short your hills are
[1:07:36] too high all of you are making us look
[1:07:38] bad in the way that you live in the way
[1:07:40] that you dress no justice is letting the
[1:07:42] people see who they really are
[1:07:46] that's what justice is
[1:07:49] it's not a measuring stick or a closed
[1:07:51] line or beating people up it's to
[1:07:53] justices to treat them as they ought to
[1:07:55] be treated and to show them who they are
[1:07:58] in the word of god
[1:08:00] gathering place for the elect
[1:08:02] rest and shelter
[1:08:04] so just as cain in genesis chapter 4
[1:08:07] went out from the presence of the lord
[1:08:08] running away from god running away from
[1:08:09] the voice of god and build as a son and
[1:08:13] builds a city
[1:08:14] and names the city after his sons like i
[1:08:16] don't want to have anything to do with
[1:08:17] the presence of god
[1:08:20] in genesis chapter 4 verses 25 and 26
[1:08:22] and add them to his wife again and she
[1:08:24] bear a son and called his name seth
[1:08:27] for god said she
[1:08:29] hath appointed me
[1:08:31] for god said she hath appointed me
[1:08:33] another seed instead of abel
[1:08:36] whom cain slew
[1:08:38] and to seth
[1:08:39] to him also there was born a son so now
[1:08:42] remember the image
[1:08:44] of abraham first
[1:08:46] but now cain the contrast and now look
[1:08:48] again what's in seth
[1:08:50] he has a son named born and he names
[1:08:52] them enos then began men to call
[1:08:56] upon the name of the lord
[1:08:59] such a difference
[1:09:01] and that's what we see in genesis
[1:09:02] chapter 21
[1:09:04] the birth of a son and invoking the name
[1:09:07] of jehovah and the everlasting god the
[1:09:09] eternal god
[1:09:11] then again men men here are the sons of
[1:09:13] adam
[1:09:16] and the bible says then men begin to
[1:09:17] call upon the name of the lord it means
[1:09:20] the sons of god sought god together
[1:09:25] and as i pondered this last week i
[1:09:27] i i i thought how how did this happen
[1:09:30] was it just instinct was it just
[1:09:33] innate in them it was just something
[1:09:34] that you know seth has a son and then
[1:09:36] enos comes out and he just wants to
[1:09:38] serve god but when you look at the
[1:09:40] family you would see that adam had
[1:09:42] instilled in his son seth and likewise
[1:09:46] he wanted to be expressed even to enos a
[1:09:49] sense of the divine
[1:09:51] a sense of his presence that is not said
[1:09:54] of adam it is not said of seth it is not
[1:09:56] said of his seed that they fled from the
[1:09:58] presence of the lord it was a place
[1:10:00] where adam wanted to keep the voice of
[1:10:01] god fresh the remembrance of god fresh
[1:10:04] the promise though how no matter how
[1:10:05] much his channels had been clogged
[1:10:07] something and adam wanted to keep the
[1:10:09] testimony alive of what god had the
[1:10:11] promise that god had made and so they
[1:10:13] invoked the name of god together
[1:10:16] and when the bible says they called they
[1:10:18] called upon the name lord
[1:10:20] in one translation i think even to the
[1:10:22] hebrew it says they called they were
[1:10:23] called by the name of the lord in other
[1:10:25] words they called themselves by the name
[1:10:28] of the lord they called themselves the
[1:10:30] sons of god
[1:10:33] that's why you find later when the sons
[1:10:34] of god saw the daughters of men
[1:10:37] because in this moment there's a
[1:10:38] contrast there's a distinction cain has
[1:10:41] run off into his folly the way of cain
[1:10:43] has a son builds a city names it after
[1:10:45] his son but now by teaching now by
[1:10:48] inspiration now by conviction now even
[1:10:51] after after the similitude of their
[1:10:53] brother abel after the image of adam
[1:10:56] seth has a son and they began not just
[1:10:59] to call upon the name lord but they
[1:11:01] identified themselves not as sons of men
[1:11:04] but as sons of god
[1:11:08] and that is what we begin to declare
[1:11:10] to for ourselves we are not just men and
[1:11:13] women but we are sons and daughters of
[1:11:15] god
[1:11:18] and adam
[1:11:20] instilling this in his family and his
[1:11:21] family beginning to reflect
[1:11:25] i this a topic for a minister's meeting
[1:11:27] back east
[1:11:28] the topic is
[1:11:30] i don't know if you got it uh brother
[1:11:32] reggie but it's uh
[1:11:34] was able born righteous
[1:11:37] so i text one of the brothers out there
[1:11:38] and says now it's getting fun
[1:11:43] and
[1:11:44] what happens in genesis chapter 21
[1:11:47] it says abraham planted a grove in
[1:11:50] beersheba you're like brother aaron
[1:11:51] you're still reading it we've all
[1:11:52] memorized it
[1:11:53] abraham planted a grove in beersheba and
[1:11:55] called there on the name of the lord the
[1:11:57] everlasting god
[1:12:01] i'm closing
[1:12:04] and i want you to ponder this very
[1:12:05] deeply
[1:12:08] to realize that this one scripture is so
[1:12:10] inspiring
[1:12:13] we've only looked at it for these last
[1:12:14] two services but it inspired the first
[1:12:16] two
[1:12:18] and you look at this abraham planted the
[1:12:20] grove in beersheba
[1:12:22] there was so much
[1:12:25] that led to this moment that's built
[1:12:27] into this action
[1:12:29] and there's so much that it foreshadowed
[1:12:32] he planted a tree planted a grove a
[1:12:34] garden
[1:12:36] remember all these things that we've
[1:12:37] expressed
[1:12:40] but it was a place as i mentioned
[1:12:41] earlier that he could testify what god
[1:12:43] had done for him
[1:12:46] there he called on the name lord the
[1:12:47] everlasting god it's just exactly what
[1:12:49] seth and enos did the lineage of adam
[1:12:51] they called themselves the sons of god
[1:12:53] abraham would call himself
[1:12:55] the son of god
[1:12:57] a servant of the most high
[1:13:01] it was a place that abraham testified of
[1:13:04] the son of man who visited him
[1:13:09] and the god who gave him a promise
[1:13:12] and the god who had most recently
[1:13:13] fulfilled it
[1:13:14] is that right in genesis 21
[1:13:17] and where was it now i'm just i'm going
[1:13:19] to read from genesis chapter 18 and then
[1:13:21] i have um
[1:13:22] three more quotes in a scripture i'm not
[1:13:24] going to tell you how long they are
[1:13:26] but
[1:13:27] after this genesis chapter 18 verses 1
[1:13:29] to 8 and follow this with me
[1:13:42] because this is part of the inspiration
[1:13:44] to his grove in genesis chapter 18
[1:13:47] verses 1 to 8 and the lord appeared unto
[1:13:49] abram
[1:13:51] appeared unto him in the plains
[1:13:53] of mamrie
[1:13:55] and he sat in the tent door
[1:13:57] in the heat of the day
[1:14:01] we can all relate to that
[1:14:03] and the tent door
[1:14:05] imagine this tent would have been built
[1:14:06] in a place that would have provided some
[1:14:07] shade
[1:14:10] probably north facing
[1:14:12] and he lift up his eyes and looked and
[1:14:14] lo three men stood by him when he saw
[1:14:16] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[1:14:18] door and bowed himself toward the ground
[1:14:20] so he's left as he sees them coming and
[1:14:22] traveling he leaves this place where
[1:14:23] he's abiding he leaves this place where
[1:14:25] he was just standing and he runs to them
[1:14:27] and by revelation he doesn't just
[1:14:29] acknowledge the three but he
[1:14:30] acknowledges the one he says my lord if
[1:14:33] now i have found faith in thy sight pass
[1:14:35] not away i pray thee from thy servant he
[1:14:38] is calling him lord he is acknowledging
[1:14:40] that this is god this is not this is
[1:14:42] some this is the image of god this is a
[1:14:44] one in the person of god he reverences
[1:14:47] him lord if i found favor pass not from
[1:14:49] thy servant and watch what his instinct
[1:14:52] is
[1:14:53] let a little water i pray you be fetched
[1:14:56] and wash your feet
[1:14:58] and rest yourselves
[1:14:59] under the tree
[1:15:02] i wanted to wash your feet
[1:15:04] set them under the tree he says and i
[1:15:06] will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort
[1:15:08] you your hearts after that you shall
[1:15:11] pass on what a beautiful image
[1:15:14] and and i like to i was looking at this
[1:15:17] in the continuity of abraham's life
[1:15:19] after he had returned from the battle
[1:15:21] who was it melchizedek that meets them
[1:15:23] and serves them
[1:15:24] bread and wine
[1:15:26] and abraham's revelation is growing and
[1:15:28] service is growing and
[1:15:30] and his ministry is growing he's
[1:15:32] learning how to serve and he he gets
[1:15:34] this example so now he's able to return
[1:15:36] what he has received and the bread and
[1:15:38] the wine and the nourishment and the
[1:15:39] ministry after the battle in genesis 14
[1:15:42] now he says lord let me fetch some water
[1:15:45] to wash your feet rest under the tree
[1:15:49] and i will fetch a morsel of bread and
[1:15:51] comfort ye your hearts after that ye
[1:15:53] shall pass on
[1:15:55] for therefore ye come to your servant
[1:15:58] and they said so do as thou has said
[1:16:02] so they he met him and he says come
[1:16:04] under the tree where was the tree it was
[1:16:06] where that tent was by the tent door
[1:16:08] they could gather under that tree it was
[1:16:10] gonna be a place where he washed their
[1:16:11] feet
[1:16:12] fed them bread
[1:16:14] and abraham hastened to the tendon to
[1:16:15] sarah and said make ready quickly three
[1:16:17] measures of fine meal knead it and make
[1:16:19] cakes upon the earth and abraham ran
[1:16:21] into the herd and fetched a calf tender
[1:16:23] and good and gave it unto a young man
[1:16:25] five stars and he hasted to dress it and
[1:16:28] he took butter and milk and the calf
[1:16:30] which he had dressed and set it before
[1:16:32] them and he stood by them
[1:16:34] under the tree
[1:16:36] and they did eat
[1:16:37] what a beautiful saying
[1:16:40] these men coming upon him in the heat of
[1:16:43] the day must have been a hot day
[1:16:46] and he comes and his instinct is to
[1:16:48] minister to them let me wash your feet
[1:16:51] let me get you some bread let me get you
[1:16:53] some water let me get you some milk let
[1:16:55] me get you some a calf
[1:16:57] let's let's take bread and butter and
[1:16:59] let's eat and dress it and you sit here
[1:17:02] under the tree and rest
[1:17:05] and he stood there with him under the
[1:17:07] tree a resting place a place of feeding
[1:17:10] a place where his home was
[1:17:13] right there under that shade tree
[1:17:15] and brother branham in the modern events
[1:17:17] made clear by prophecy i found dozens of
[1:17:18] places where brother bran just brought
[1:17:20] this
[1:17:20] the tree the tree under the tree and
[1:17:22] this instance of the revealing of the
[1:17:24] son of man he said one day under the
[1:17:26] shade tree while they were sitting and
[1:17:27] resting god came down in the form of a
[1:17:30] man
[1:17:32] and to catch the full picture
[1:17:35] and i believe i just like how this
[1:17:36] summarizes it so it can help us to close
[1:17:38] here in the message this day this
[1:17:40] scripture is fulfilled now abraham did
[1:17:42] not go down in sodom
[1:17:44] he and his group he had a big group with
[1:17:46] them enough to fight off a dozen kings
[1:17:48] in their army so he had a big group with
[1:17:50] them
[1:17:51] and he was setting out there under an
[1:17:53] oak tree one day
[1:17:54] when everything was going wrong for him
[1:17:57] nobody had anything to do with him but
[1:17:59] he was still holding on to that promise
[1:18:02] there was a place where he sat with his
[1:18:04] group his family under that tree
[1:18:07] despised rejected persecuted maybe not
[1:18:09] fitting in with the crowd like lot was
[1:18:11] but he says watch now closely before we
[1:18:13] close while he was sitting there down
[1:18:15] come three men walking to him two of
[1:18:18] them went down into sodom and preached
[1:18:20] the gospel to them to come out to lot
[1:18:22] but one stayed with abraham
[1:18:24] notice and he's expanding the story
[1:18:26] beyond where they went down and the lord
[1:18:28] remained with him under that tree to
[1:18:30] reveal himself and further unfold the
[1:18:32] revelation and promise to another tree
[1:18:34] says notice one that stayed with abraham
[1:18:36] was god
[1:18:38] himself where did he come to he came to
[1:18:42] that home he came to that place and it
[1:18:44] was there under that shade tree where
[1:18:46] god spoke to him and confirmed the
[1:18:49] promise and said i will return unto you
[1:18:52] according to the time of life and sarah
[1:18:55] shall have a son
[1:18:58] it was in that place under that tree
[1:19:02] that god spoke to him and confirmed the
[1:19:04] promise
[1:19:05] and so once god fulfilled that promise
[1:19:08] in genesis chapter 21 this is what
[1:19:10] abraham's tree represents in verse 33
[1:19:13] this is what it represents it's in the
[1:19:15] image of the place that god met him in
[1:19:17] the door the tent door underneath that
[1:19:20] tree
[1:19:22] it's a place where god met him
[1:19:25] and it was a place
[1:19:27] of service and feet washing and feeding
[1:19:30] and i say may this church
[1:19:33] be a tree
[1:19:35] where god can come to it
[1:19:37] may this church be a tree where god
[1:19:39] could come and reveal himself to
[1:19:41] abraham's seed
[1:19:43] in the contrast to what was going on in
[1:19:45] sodom
[1:19:47] may this be a place that's not
[1:19:48] characterized by eating and drinking and
[1:19:50] buying and selling and planting and
[1:19:52] building may not be a place that's just
[1:19:53] busy with the things of life busy with
[1:19:55] carnal things busy with carnal pursuits
[1:19:57] busy with just opportunities
[1:20:00] i think i mentioned it the other day and
[1:20:01] it's really the sad reality i think some
[1:20:04] people just look at it as a church as an
[1:20:05] opportunity to pull off another mlm
[1:20:08] right
[1:20:09] just more people to practice their wares
[1:20:11] on and sell things too and get things
[1:20:12] out of the people and that's not what
[1:20:14] family is for that's not what the church
[1:20:16] is for it's not just a place for us to
[1:20:17] find find people who can do our bidding
[1:20:20] it's not just a place we say oh i'm glad
[1:20:21] we got a church i need to move
[1:20:24] no those are all the things that how a
[1:20:26] family functions in its and its growth
[1:20:28] and it's a development it's not just a
[1:20:30] place for eating and drinking buying and
[1:20:32] selling planting and building as things
[1:20:34] are in the world but it's a place where
[1:20:36] the voice of god is stronger than the
[1:20:38] voice of politics it's a place where the
[1:20:40] voice of god is stronger than the voice
[1:20:42] of hollywood it's a place where the
[1:20:43] voice of god is speaking therefore it's
[1:20:46] a place where we come not running from
[1:20:48] the presence of the lord but a place
[1:20:50] where the presence of god is guaranteed
[1:20:55] brother i said it's noted for god it's a
[1:20:57] place where the son of man is being
[1:20:59] revealed
[1:21:00] a place to feed on his unfailing word
[1:21:06] musicians please come in ephesians
[1:21:08] chapter 2 verse 6.
[1:21:10] paul's speaking about us he says he's
[1:21:12] raised us up together
[1:21:17] and made us sit together
[1:21:20] in heavenly places
[1:21:22] in christ jesus
[1:21:24] that's it
[1:21:26] that's what we're doing now
[1:21:29] raised us up together made us sit
[1:21:31] together where abraham was that day
[1:21:33] under that tree he had a view of the
[1:21:35] well-watered plains of sodom
[1:21:38] he had a view of where those angels were
[1:21:40] going down but he had this place just a
[1:21:42] little bit higher a little bit off apart
[1:21:44] with god himself
[1:21:47] he's raised us to sit to raise us up
[1:21:49] together and made us sit together in
[1:21:51] heavenly places
[1:21:52] in christ jesus
[1:21:57] the sermon i am the resurrection and the
[1:21:59] life
[1:22:01] i said
[1:22:02] that's what this church ought to be
[1:22:05] now i want to close with this this quote
[1:22:07] will be this is the sermon for wednesday
[1:22:09] night
[1:22:12] he said there's righteous people walking
[1:22:14] in the light of the lord
[1:22:17] he's talking about the the family the
[1:22:19] simeon and the those that he was
[1:22:21] revealing himself to he says that's the
[1:22:22] kind of home
[1:22:25] god can get into
[1:22:26] righteous people walking in the light
[1:22:28] that's the kind of home that god can get
[1:22:30] into now if you're serving all kinds of
[1:22:32] parties and beer and everything in your
[1:22:33] house god will never visit you there
[1:22:37] that's right
[1:22:38] but if you've got a home that's cleaned
[1:22:40] up and living for god
[1:22:42] with prayer and the bible open and a few
[1:22:44] tear stains on it god can visit you
[1:22:48] that's right because you've opened up a
[1:22:50] channel that he can come to
[1:22:54] that's the word of god
[1:22:55] you can open up a channel how
[1:22:59] by making it a place that god can come
[1:23:01] to
[1:23:03] imagine that abraham
[1:23:05] planted a grove
[1:23:07] and often looked to the horizon
[1:23:09] for another visitation
[1:23:12] of elohim
[1:23:15] had it had a place there
[1:23:18] before the well-watered plains of
[1:23:21] sodom
[1:23:23] in the heat of the day just sitting
[1:23:24] there as brother bradham said
[1:23:26] nobody will have anything to do with me
[1:23:30] everything's going wrong
[1:23:32] but he's sitting there saying but i know
[1:23:34] who holds tomorrow
[1:23:36] i know the promise he made sarah
[1:23:40] god made the promise
[1:23:42] wrestling with things pondering things
[1:23:43] but that day under that tree he looked
[1:23:45] up and the lord was coming
[1:23:49] and there under that tree
[1:23:50] in the heat of the day
[1:23:53] bread was served feet were washed
[1:23:56] meat was eaten
[1:23:58] and god spoke to him and confirmed his
[1:24:00] promise
[1:24:02] and i could just see abraham
[1:24:05] after this son is born he planted a
[1:24:07] tamask tree
[1:24:08] and he planted a grove and he he had a
[1:24:11] place
[1:24:12] reserved there
[1:24:13] and it was a reminder it was a reminder
[1:24:17] of that place where god met him
[1:24:19] it was in that place he could testify of
[1:24:22] the one who came and spoke to him of the
[1:24:25] one who came and prophesied
[1:24:28] to him
[1:24:31] that's what this church is
[1:24:34] it's a well it's an oasis
[1:24:36] it's a place you can call home
[1:24:39] that's what your houses need to be
[1:24:42] the place that can be called home
[1:24:45] our heavenly father
[1:24:49] lord in our hearts
[1:24:51] we see so much truth
[1:24:55] we hear so much word
[1:24:59] and there's a longing to live it
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:03] there's an image in the scripture that
[1:25:04] seems historical it seems allegorical
[1:25:07] that seems in shadows and types
[1:25:10] and lord as i preach it i realize to
[1:25:12] some it may seem to be pointing
[1:25:14] backwards but lord may there be a
[1:25:15] quickening right now
[1:25:17] that it just comes into focus for
[1:25:19] present day
[1:25:21] just in this moment lord there can be
[1:25:23] husbands that recognize a pathway to
[1:25:26] make this applicable
[1:25:28] wives who can see avenues to support
[1:25:30] that vision
[1:25:32] to not try to be the leader to not be
[1:25:34] the one that's pushing or the one that's
[1:25:35] pulling
[1:25:37] but just a way that they could support
[1:25:40] hold up their end
[1:25:42] of the labor
[1:25:43] now lord where there's homes that are
[1:25:45] broken or where there's maybe a
[1:25:46] difference of standard may you
[1:25:49] lord visit that home
[1:25:52] lord today visit this family as we've
[1:25:54] gathered this place this is a place
[1:25:56] where the atmosphere can be right and
[1:25:58] it's a noted place for god and we gather
[1:26:00] as a family there may be disharmony and
[1:26:02] disunity in our houses and our
[1:26:04] residences beyond these walls but if we
[1:26:06] can make this place a home then it can
[1:26:08] be a spot where you come and they feed
[1:26:10] their feet are washed
[1:26:12] they're nourished by the butter and the
[1:26:14] milk and the bread and the calf
[1:26:18] and it gives them courage to go home and
[1:26:19] do things
[1:26:20] right pray lord that you strengthen your
[1:26:23] families today
[1:26:25] lord you know in my own home there's
[1:26:26] such a
[1:26:28] a preciousness with my children
[1:26:31] such a beautiful vision that i share
[1:26:33] with my wife
[1:26:35] there's challenges lord
[1:26:38] and i know challenges are opportunities
[1:26:40] for victory
[1:26:44] challenges are opportunities to stay
[1:26:46] take steps higher
[1:26:48] but there's moments that break our
[1:26:50] hearts lord
[1:26:52] there's moments where we
[1:26:55] we trust we can only trust you lord for
[1:26:58] the outcome
[1:27:00] but i do not want to take my hands off
[1:27:02] lord from working from laboring from
[1:27:05] serving from sanctifying
[1:27:08] i could turn that house into a home
[1:27:11] lord with the way things are in
[1:27:13] economics and the future days
[1:27:16] unfold from weeks into years and
[1:27:19] decades it could be a time when not many
[1:27:21] would be able to own their own house
[1:27:24] but lord wherever we are maybe we make
[1:27:25] it a home
[1:27:27] this church now just renting lord but we
[1:27:29] don't want to
[1:27:30] look down on this facility lord we want
[1:27:33] to make it a home
[1:27:34] make it a place where you can come to
[1:27:38] so i pray that you bless us today
[1:27:40] thank you for your presence amongst us
[1:27:43] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:27:44] pray amen amen
