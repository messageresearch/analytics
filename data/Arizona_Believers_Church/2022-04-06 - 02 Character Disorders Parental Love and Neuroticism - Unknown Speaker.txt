TRANSCRIPT
========================================
brother brandon makes this statement he says it's a nervous age what is it then i give this solemn warning to the church stand still god always commands us stand still before he does anything and then he makes this statement the church is in a neurotic stage every church just proselyting and pulling and fussing and stewing it's a neurotic age but stand still and and i want to focus i kind of want to amplify some of these things these comments he's making here on the church is in a neurotic stage that's quite a statement and i think if a uh if a minister if brother brenda makes that statement then it it means something and it's something very important it's good to see you brother matthew i saw somebody on the corner of my eye and didn't know who it was but it's good to see you i was actually just texting you before i walked out so this is an odd an odd manifestation of a response to my text messages but uh god bless you it's good to see you but it says it's a neurotic stage and then he says it's a neurotic age now this is very important because i believe this is a prophet diagnosing certain things and so what i'd like to talk about today and i don't know if this is going to work so i might it might have timed out on me but uh is a second installment on our uh of our segment called character disorders and so this is um would maybe be part two if you're writing it down but this this installment is going to be on parental love and neuroticism and i know that might be somewhat of a catchy phrase but you're going to see just exactly where we drew it from is on this is character disorders and that's kind of the segment which we said we wouldn't necessarily do it in the series things in sequence but god just really i just punched me with it early this morning and and take this this subject of parental love and neuroticism so we have what could be the way we would title it uh zero two character disorders parental love and neuroticism and because of some of the themes with with the adult sermon you get a free kid's entree uh a free kid's meal so it's kids eat free on wednesday night because of the subject matter so almost combining two different things and so aren't you excited about this kids with this the sermon for the adults you're going to get to eat free tonight and we're not sure what that means just yet but maybe we'll all get there eventually now in revelations chapter 3 verse 17 it says god is looking at the age and he says and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked this is the assessment of the laodicean age the time that we're living in now different from their own self-estimation or rich we're increased with goods have need of nothing but yet god looks past the exterior the veneer of wealth the veneer of happiness and memes and all sorts of things that make people feel uh that they're doing well but he's identifying this last church age as the worst of all the ages uh one thing that's note is every other age gets a compliment except laodicea and that's something to note and that it's and he's saying the people are afflicted they're uncomfortable if we just put it mildly and we're trying to be politically correct just uncomfortable but the word wretched it means it's a combination of two words which means to endure trial not in the trials that a christian would endure but these are trials and afflictions of uh of the unbeliever of the of the one denying god the one who's lost and anxious and unsettled and so the way that god describes it even as we've already read as the church is in a neurotic stage it's an age that is depressed is in an age that is miserable and brother brandon makes these statements i don't have the slide there but just ponder god's diagnosis of our time now he says this age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly goods catch the phrase but the people are less happy than ever this age boasts of its spiritual attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than ever isn't it remarkable that when you can get more money it doesn't resolve happiness when you can achieve certain things it doesn't necessarily resolve happiness but they have goods less happy than ever spiritual attainments less sure of themselves than ever key phrase less sure of themselves self-doubt questioning and then he identifies just the advancements in technology going from horse and buggy to the rocket age in just several decades and he says the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that have come upon the earth can't even keep up so why why is it we see certain things rising up why do we see certain problems that are very prevalent we might think that our technological scientific and medical advancements would insulate us or at least help us to overcome certain things but it's actually giving rise to these things and he says that the man cannot keep up with it so there's a psychological impact there's a physical impact i i don't mean to inspire any of the the foil hat people here or the uh are the conspiracy theorists but how do they know that you can't fill up all the spectrums of the bandwidth and there's not a fallout when you do it i shared this with someone the other day in sedona and they said oh that gave me chills i thought oh wait never mind shouldn't be talking about this here in sedona but it's true you don't know what happens when you fill up all the bandwidth could there be a physical fallout and he's saying mankind cannot keep up with this and then he says inside is a dark void cavern that is crying out in torment and without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neurotics it's a church he says the church is in it's an erotic stage now we could say as an assessment of not just the church age but god's diagnosis of our time this is prevalent over all society it is an age of neurotics in second timothy chapter 3 verse 1 timothy paul writing to timothy says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come a perilous means hard to take or hard to bear troublesome dangerous it comes from the root to be harsh fierce and savage so we can say these are savage times these are fierce times these are harsh times and therefore it's times that are hard to bear times that are very difficult or troublesome man can't take it and it seems as if how can we go any further how can this continue and brother branham says in this i want to use this kind of as a summation as this introduction of the time that we're living in the spirit of the world today is neurotic identifies in different places how it's just think something's building up it says attention it's pressure it's wearing the mind the mind isn't made to handle these things the body then isn't made to prop up the mind you realize that right the bible even tells us that when a man is sick his spirit will bear him up in his sickness and his weakness of his body the spirit just says hey you got to go to work you just suck it up you pull yourself up by the bootstraps and you get to work you do that by the spirit that's in you but when the spirit gets out of cater and the spirit gets breached the body no matter how strong it is can't just reach in there and tell the spirit come on let's get going you can't train enough to dig down deep and get your spirit in line and so it's a weariness it's a crumbling you're built up all this pressure's built up all this tension and mankind's being impacted by it so we live in a neurotic age i wanted to define this in such a way to kind of zero in on what this word means i would as i gave the same caveat as i gave a caveat when we first introduced the concept of uh character disorders and the anti-spiritual personality disorder i didn't have slides because i wanted you to focus very intently on what i was saying and not so much getting lost in the terminology because we're just bringing this back to the word i think maybe we started off on this so you know what we're you probably already can begin to anticipate that this can be closely connected to a spiritual fame a word theme things in the bible that we can learn from but in a very general sense someone who's neurotic is someone who behaves strangely and so it's they exhibit strange behavior in some ways they exhibit some unreasonable anxiety so there has to be some baseline in order to say someone's neurotic you have some uh reasonable behavior you have some a reasonable threshold of worry or fear anxiety and someone who is a neurotic you'd say they're not this is unusual out of the norm behaviors for somebody in this situation and so there's some uh just i say that because you'll find many times brother branham's referring to neurotic behavior and its deviation from what would be correct spiritually so deviation from what would be correct morally it's deviation from what human humanity used to deem uh uh proper indecent and then someone begins to deviate from they says that's neurotic behavior they're insane to dress that way they're insane to act that way so in that way neurotic could be used kind of in a sense to explain that someone's conduct does not conform with what is usual or normal in that particular situation but the neuroticism which is kind of maybe more what uh we're looking at is you could even see brother branham identifying it the bible identifying it it's defined by a tendency to towards anxiety negativity and self-doubt this would maybe be more of a textbook definition so neuroticism is kind of the worst case scenario thinking you're always just imagining the worst and because of that it leads to high levels of guilt it leads to high levels of worry and fear and depression and so these things kind of feed into some of the uh the 157 things we were talking about before the dsm-5 on the um the disorders of the of a person personality disorders and i will say this that it is a neuroticism from a um maybe i would maybe don't want to use the word clinical but an academic or uh treatment standpoint it exists on a spectrum and they say that all of us are at least a little bit neurotic and could we get an amanda that all of us at least to some level are are neurotic now this is different from neurosis which would be something entirely different and would be more clinical but we're looking at neuroticism or to be neurotic and this is a statement that i found that i thought really summed this up real well it's a fundamental domain neuroticism a fundamental domain of personality that has enormous public health and public health implications impacting a wide array of psychopathological and physical health care concerns it contributes to the occurrence of many significantly harmful life outcomes as well as impairing the ability of persons to adequately address them they recognize that neuroticism is implicated in a lot of bad life outcomes neuroticism implicating a lot of pathological problems and physical health care problems and not only does it cause that or may be correlated but it also impairs a person's ability to then address whether the physical or mental need that is caused by it so it can create a very damaging cycle and so with that in mind let me read this statement says everybody has become a neurotic the whole world is a neurotical age and we know there's something wrong now what i want to pose and the question i want to ask tonight is how did we get there how do we get to a place where brother bannon could make such stark statements and that in one sense in second timothy chapter 3 paul would prophesy it and then we come to revelations chapter 3 verse 17 and and again in symbolic form it comes to pass that mankind has they become neurotics it's prophesied in the last days they'll be perilous then in revelations 3 17 17 though it's prophecy i want to say that it shows the fulfillment or the fruit of that seed prophecy that everything has become a neurotic age and i want us to think about how we got there but then also i want to ask if the word prophesied it do you think you could solve it if the word knew it was going to be here do you think the word would make provision for it do you not think that if the word said hey in the last days it's going to be a neurotic age you do not think that the word would then provide some treatment or care for the neuroticism that exists in the world today and i can demonstrate this to you from an academic scientific standpoint and show you that the the doctors and scientists have a language to use to describe the maladies of the mind and the problems with people today and then you could and then you can go right to the bible and see that the bible knows already and was written to address it god knew we knew he'd be insane in the last days you know what he began to do all the way back in the old testament in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth so he would provide us with our own bible our own psychiatric bible or our own dsm-5 he provided us with something that we could consult and go to to address this problem so i've already answered it if the word prophesied it yes it can solve it now this is this next statement here is just going to open up the door in terms of what what i'm uh what inspired me it's from the message great coming revival he says the whole air has become contaminated with the powers of the underworld and the powers of darkness now this will get the republicans feeling really good about themselves we'll look out over the world now and find around how communism is weaving its way in isn't that right it's the communist and says why we could get out on the street and we here in america we take for instance like i was passing a place a while ago in your city the lovely city not only that but my city and everywhere you find these mothers out working these war plants and things that come in their children with babysitters now again a lot of times what we do is we would attribute this to well that's just chauvinism or that's uh misogyny right that's what we would attribute it to her that was just the prevailing dominant mindset of men in that day but brother graham's not just saying this because he doesn't think women should work it's because there's a there's something that's being forsaken and this is important to catch because you could just read this like that's right all these women out there working in the plants but it's not that wasn't the problem it's the other part that's really the problem and here he gets to it he says oh it's a disgrace our american women ever put on a pair of overalls and went into a war plant to work i don't care how much that hurts but it's a disgrace and this is the key it's a breaking the backbone of this nation that little baby of yours needs you so it wasn't it wasn't that it was just because there was a woman out there working in a plant it's because something is abandoned something forsaken some standard let go and so you could take and i hope i'm not venturing out you'll find that when brother banham dealt with a woman working he was very sensitive to situations that would put a sister in a position where she needed to work so it's not just the job itself that makes a woman wrong or evil or out of her place but it's what's being abandoned or forsaken or let go of and not honored when it happens and listen i think there's a lot of misogynist who grabbed these quotes in the message and used them to beat up women and it produced the wrong result because we missed what was being taught by the prophet not just looking at in the age that he was in the language he's using at the time but taking a step back and saying well why was it such a disgrace because there was a baby at home that needed the mother and he says god gave you that baby to raise yourself for you to raise the baby not the baby to raise you he god gave you that baby to for you to raise not some babysitter that's right now i know this is hard even in the times we're living in an hour this can be very very hard but watch what he says here not long ago they had some of these doctors that said let the baby lay and cry you nurse it at a certain time you don't pick it up if it cries let it cry it out and i think there's two different schools of thoughts i forgot because it's been a long time since we've had a a baby in the family uh that would have to be by this schedule but it's either on demand or on certain times and so maybe there's still a debate that rages between among mothers nowadays like well i do it every morning at such and such time and i don't wait till such and such time and and uh even though it seems certainly relevant to that i'm not saying that brother brown is waiting in on that debate necessarily but he's just saying there used to be this theology or this idea of let the baby cry cry whine cry if it's not that certain time that you nurse it just let it lay there and cry you don't pick it up if it cries let it cry it out he says they did that 25 years ago he said that was a great belief amongst the doctors i want to come right back to that phrase in a moment that was a great belief amongst the doctors come to find out it hatched out a bunch of neurotics he's making this direct connection that there was this approach to motherhood this was approach to parenthood there was this approach to infants that was basically saying let them cry leave them alone and stick very rigidly to the schedule of feeding them and brother man says you know what it did it produced neurotics this is his his diagnosis and he says let nature have its way god knows what's best that baby needs love this is where i get the phrase parental love and neuroticism because brother graham's just connected to two the the the the holding withholding and the one part from that teaching hatched out a bunch of neurotics but he says the baby needs love if you take love away from it you'll make a brute out of it that baby's got to have love you've got to take care of it and today the mothers become bar flies out around the ballroom and things like that and the whole morals of the nation is breaking and everything we're at the end of the road in in again i'm not wanting to limit just how far-reaching those statements are and just what brother branham was intending by referring to certain things in the workplace or here even with bar flies and and bar rooms but notice how the fallout and the consequence how much greater it is when you have a mother who's out doing those things and is leaving a baby at home he's saying there's a direct consequence if you take love away from it you make a brute the baby's got to have love so if they if they abide by what the doctors were saying take a step back leave them alone feed them at certain times it produced neurotics and he says but nature the very nature that god gave the mother he knows what's best and the baby needs love so you see the connection that we're making there so this statement that brother browner makes is a great belief among doctors so i i've gone back and i've actually come across these things through the years in my in my reading and studying and i know many of you may uh be familiar with some of these things that we're going to touch on but i want to i want to identify what this great belief amongst the doctors was and it's uh it's well documented it was a frequent um assertion and then even later on begin to be greatly debated so it's very easy to find a lot of materials within the academic circles on these things and in the early 1900s many psychologists believed that showing children affection served no real purpose i thought well you show them affection it's just a sentimental gesture and has no developmental impact and this is what they believe they believe that to rub a kid on the head or to hug him or to kiss him on the cheek this is just sentiment this is just a sentimental gesture and it does not impact the child in any measurable way and this is what they believed and they actually went so far as to think that this kind of behavior affection would spread diseases and and that they believed it would actually lead to adult physiological uh psychological problems later on in life that if you love on them and care for them not only could you inflict them with some disease but also later on they'd have a psychological problem as a result of it and then this statement is very shocking i wanted to put it in that neurotic age font but this is john b watson he's the founder one of the founders of behavioral psychology and i'm not wanting to use this as an indictment of that discipline but he said when you're tempted to pet your child remember that mother love is a dangerous instrument okay dr watson when you are tempted to pet your child remember that mother love is a dangerous instrument that's quite a statement but this is the prevailing idea of this is the great belief amongst doctors when brother bam says 25 years ago he says in 1954 he is bulls eyeing this attitude and this idea that this is the way we think this is the way we believe that when you're tempted to show affection to your child when you're tempted to let that motherly love be expressed to that little and remember it's dangerous it could cause diseases it could cause psychological problems later on so it builds up this great belief amongst doctors that you let the baby cry you only nurse it at certain times don't pick it up if it cries let it cry it out he says it hatched a bunch of neurotics in the 1950s and 60s a behaviorist and the psychoanalyst believed that babies became attached to their mothers merely because they provided them food they thought this is the only reason why a child an infant becomes attached to a mom this is the only reason why there is seems to be this attachment they called it attachment theories how they explored it it's solely based upon the fact that the mother feeds them and that's why that's what they look at they say the mother is only to provide food in providing food that's why they get attached and so it's not necessary that there be any other signs of love or expressions of love to the child because that'll only be problematic because after all a mother's love is a dangerous instrument so it makes this statement even more striking this is the early 1900s then even the 50s and 60s this is the prevailing attitude and notice what brother brown says in 1958 i'm reading these next two statements to zero in on this time period mom is having a little innocent fun he's talking about women out partying and everything maybe their husbands were home babysitting or some hired child is taking care of their children he says god gave you them children to take care of them yourself and it's your responsible to god we don't have juvenile delinquency it's parental delinquency where is the delinquency not being at home taking care of the children he says some mothers have got away from their duty they want to run to bar rooms and carry on and run all night long and leave their children grow up so where where could we say is the transgression the the removal of the mother from her duty in the home to grow and raise her child up that's the duty that's being forsaken he says no wonder they grow up in that neurotic age god gave you that child to raise and to take care of we read it from 1954 this is 1958 he's looking at neurotic behaviors in children and teenagers and people today and he's saying that the reason why we see this rise of neuroticism in people is because they've this detachment of parents to their children and because they're not showing them this they're not showing them the proper care that is that is their responsibility before god so there's some scriptural standard he says they just leave their children to grow up they're detached they're not involved so no wonder they grew up to be neurotics because god gave you that child to raise and to take care of and i would i would kind of posit here that it is a scriptural duty therefore there's a scripture way to fulfill it and and so there's there's maybe perversions of the parenthood that uh subscribe to maybe a counter uh belief system than than the ones espoused by these doctors that want you to be very very involved and overbearing and i would say that if it's not the word of god you're going to find yourself going from one ditch into another then in the message thirsting for life he says that's what breaks up homes i'm sorry if i went too far there we're competing how did that happen now you guys know where i'm going i hate that sorry my fault and thirsting for life he says that's what breaks up homes that's what spoils children he's talking about parents being out of the home out partying all night he says that's what breaks up homes parents not being in their place we can always blame the kids right but the parents i thought for sure that the front row would just be getting ready to carry me around on their shoulders if they could it's the parents out of place it's parental delinquency and he says that that's what makes neurotics it's not even the drug use of the kids it's not the video games of the kids it's not it's not the atmosphere in the environment necessarily at school he said it's something in the home he's he makes the statement that the backbone of this nation is broken and that's what causes the neuroticism in the children not because the schools are broken because the malls are broken because the internet is broken because the all these things but it's because something that god designed to protect and guide the children has been broken or lost its compass and therefore that's how the children become neurotics he says that's what makes teenage delinquency is when motherhood and fatherhood is broke i often emphasize this when i read these statements is just when you read how dark the age is and how awful things are and how things have gotten to where there's so much delinquency just take the opposite if it's broken parenthood that caused it then strong parenthood can resolve it if broken parenthood is what caused the problem then god can bring a strong home and a strong atmosphere in the home and it be the inoculation and the defense against it so in the diagnosis of the problem is the solution kind of invert always invert if a broken home caused the problem then a unified home can fix it he says that's what makes neurotics now in august 31st 1958 so i read from 54 58 1960 on august 31st 1958 harley harry harlow presented an address at the 66th american psychiatric association their annual convention was the 66th three times seven it's a 66 apa convention and he gave his address and it was titled the nature of love and harlow presented the results at this talk called the nature of love he presented the results of a set of exp experiments he had done kind of the culmination of a lot of observations and just over decades these things kind of added up and so harlow began his career using non-human primate research i think he started at the university of wisconsin begin this primate research laboratory and because he needed regular access to monkeys it kind of sounds funny but because he needed regular access to monkeys he kept infants in a nursery and so he would separate these baby monkeys away from their parents and away from their mothers they would be born and very early on he would separate them from their mothers put them in a nursery because he needed quick access to them to operate the experiments and you'll find that if there's criticisms of harry harlow it is his treatment of animals it really was extreme the things he began to do to try to explore human behavior and so as he took these baby monkeys away from their mothers and he had him in a nursery he still had some monkeys that were still with their mothers and he observed that what he would call maybe the nursery monkeys the ones separated from their mothers behaved very differently than their peers that lived with their moms and he noticed that the ones in the nursery more reclusive they had clear social deficiencies he found that even they clung to um their cloth diapers and and they they just acted very differently socially and in their behaviors and mannerisms than the the behavior of those who were connected to their mom and then it was in the 1950s and certainly this is not things on the front page of the jeffersonville times these are not things you'd be really here being discussed it was more within academia in the 1950s certain researchers began to kind of take on and address this notion uh that physical contact from parents was bad they they looked at uh this prevailing id in the early 1900s this idea that we said brother branham talked about uh the belief system amongst the doctors and he he took it and and these certain scientists and these uh doctors began to say you know what we think there's a flaw in this rationale there's something missing in this approach and they begin to examine whether or not there was this was true this prevailing idea amongst doctors was true and these other researchers begin to argue that mothers provided more than just food that there there's this unique bond that was formed between a parent and a child that positively influenced the child's development and positively influenced the child's mental health so remember brother brown said this great belief amongst doctors was leave them alone only feed them at certain times and so leave brother graham's identifying this psychoanalyst thought that the mother's love is a dangerous instrument be sure you don't exercise it don't pet the child stay away keep arms length there's a lot i can use and statements and quotes and examples of how this prevailed in even what was publicly taught to parents at the time fathers were expected to be more detached mothers were cautioned to be affectionate but then there's this change in the 1950s where some researchers are looking at it and and just because it's a researcher just because it's science doesn't mean they're going to come up end up discovering something false really only the only thing that science can achieve in their discoveries is something that god has already set in motion or something god has already created it's their conclusions that are off base but generally something that's not a hypothesis but that they prove you say god's the one that set that in motion to begin with but remember there's a lot of theories out there and so harlow came up with an experiment then as this counter idea began to develop that no mothers me are more than food but there's a bond there that's very critical to development he came up with an experiment to study the bond and he published a book later on called learning to love which kind of encapsulated all these um experiments and again remember it first began with him observing how monkeys separated from their mothers behave very differently than the ones that remained with their mothers so he came up with an experiment and he created two different surrogate mothers their fake mothers are called they're they were made up of inanimate they were not real moms they were made out of wire and there was one that was they called a cloth mother it was made with a nice cherry cloth and it was very soft and it's the one that's on your right excuse me you're left i turned that one around in my head but it's the one on your left and this one was soft and it may be a more uh normalized face and maybe we could call this the soft mom and they made another one that was made out of wire just bare wire that's all that it was and if you notice in the image on the one on your right that one would provide food so they would put a bottle there on the one on the right it's just a wire mother but this other one would never provide food but it was soft and it was more comfortable and so the infants as they observed this to some tremendous degree the infants went to the wire mom only for food they only went to the one on the right when they were hungry but they preferred the soft mom when they weren't eating to the point to where they they were always hugged up next to it and they were always very close to it and and and and held to it just like they would a mom and they learned they leaned on this soft mom for comfort it's inanimate it never spoke to it it never fed it it never picked at it it never did anything to declare to it that it was alive but yet it it represented something more soft and more affectionate more inviting and they leaned on it for security and i could i could spend a lot of time just getting to the studies because it was it was amazing just how many many different ways they studied this but they even presented it in a strange situation scenario where they would test the the monkey in a scenario that was strange and unfamiliar to them and if they put him in a strange environment with without a mother or with the wire mother they were scared and they were un unwilling to explore but just the presence of this soft mom in the room made them feel more comfortable to explore and understand their surroundings that they would present them with what was called a fear test and they had a stuffed animal i think it was a dog that would bark or make loud noises and without the mom there just the wire mom they cowered they were scared they cried out in fear but then the presence of the soft mom just her being there made them more bold they weren't scared sometimes they would pick at it or they would be they wouldn't be afraid to address the stuffed animal and they observed this behavior amongst monkeys and what they began to deduce is that in this experiment is that there was a primary need for closeness within these infants and this affectionate bond was very critical to development because they began to recognize that there was developmental disorders in the monkeys that did not have a mom and the monkeys that only had the wire mother because they they had a control group and had ways that they were able to analyze this and they could see even in their physical maladies that they had digestive issues even though they may weigh the same they had very terrible digestive issues and there was personality things that they observed in ways that they could see that there's a definite definitive impact of having the presence of a mom even when you could say that this image here that it preferred this the warmth the softness over the one that gave it food and these findings of harlow and some of these other researchers at the time contradicted the traditional ideas of how spoiling a chair you avoid spoiling the child that was what avoid spoiling the child emotions don't matter these things are are dangerous you should avoid them don't spoil them don't be affectionate don't worry about nurturing some sort of emotional health because emotions don't matter these things are kind of hard hardwired all you need to do is give them food and the rest of itself rest is going to take care of itself now this is what science is arriving at but it's rep it's only showing us it's only discovering what brother brahma had already said in this particular instance almost 10 years earlier if it's 1958 when harry harlow gets up there and presents the presents this in the nature of love you can go back to 1954 where brother branham himself is calling out these doctors and saying you've got it wrong the baby needs love he says let nature have its way that baby needs love and then harlow harry harlow gets up there and says the nature of love the babies need love he's maybe a little bit late to the party but he's getting it right and i bring these in just so you can see how this message is uh you can say well brother ben why don't you just read to us the quotes well um i i feel led to do it this way and i think it's i think it's striking for us and i want us to have confidence in this word that yeah we could maybe you could buy the book the nature of love maybe you could buy or the the learning to love and you could buy the book nature of love but i want to come to something here in a minute and say even those things miss it because all hairy harlow is saying is they need love but does he know what love is this is something within nature within these monkeys but when it comes to a more complex individual in the family unit and fathers and mothers and children and the demands upon their time and think about the neurotic age that we're living in and the these the diagnosis that we have from revelations 3 17 there should be some heightened awareness that if science can deduce this in the laboratories with monkeys how much lar much larger of an issue is it with us as humans and this message god have provided a way there's your answer right there god hath provided a way he says i was talking to a young lady just a few moments ago that was suffering from a nervous condition she said how she had tried to overcome it now i'm not much of a christian science or unitarian i don't believe there's anything like mind over matter i believe god is a healer he says the lady was born in that nervous condition her mother and father died now she was born in that nervous condition now he's going to explain this her mother and father died when she was a child a baby and was raised up just tossed about everywhere and never had the proper love and care that a baby has you're recognizing this i i left it out of my my notes tonight um i i would say intentionally but maybe even inadvertently there's a number of studies of orphanages one very very striking studies in orphanages in romania and then other studies of russian orphanages that found that this kind of sterile approach to children in orphanages was you just feed them and you don't provide any love or care there's no touch there's no affection that's shown to them and in some cases the death rate in orphanages was 100 and they found that where the death rate was high where the death rates were high is orphanages that just operated by the sterile they just need to be changed they just need to be fed and the developmental disorders the mental disorders and even the death rates and those were exponentially higher but when they begin to train the nurses to hold to caress to care for to spend time with the death rates plummeted why because the lack of affection and warmth caused caused them to die the children the infants would actually die because of the lack of love why because god made us to experience that love to experience that so he says that she was raised up tossed about everywhere and never had the proper love and care that a baby has you know mother i want to tell you something now this is going to strike us here i know i got a little boy back there and he's really rankly spoiled is every word thus saith the lord and he's really rankly spoiled but i would rather have him that way keep following along i believe it'll make a better man out of him if god lets him live then so there's a it's not just i want him spoiled but there's an opposite he's contrasting to then to let him scream and cry and upset his little self so he's not saying that we all need to go out and just wrinkly spoil our children for some of you it's too late for others maybe we have enough time right but obed we have enough time to spoil you we can just give you all the things you want but he's not saying that he prefers spoiling the child to raising them the right way but he's saying i'd rather him be spoiled than to be detached emotionless leaving him alone letting him scream letting him try to figure his way out and having him suffer from that emotional detachment he said god if god lets him live then i'd rather him be spoiled than this other side this great belief amongst doctors and so he brings it right to this point this is where i think he's zeroing in on this maybe some people will just end on he's rankly spoiled and not care to read the rest but he's making a very beautiful point here and here some a few years ago some normal modern witch doctors said let that baby cry don't pick it up all things like that don't let grandma touch it he says you know what i hatched out what they hatched out you see what it is a juvenile delinquency a bunch of neurotics what did it produce delinquency but who is delinquent the parents and he's saying that when we thought this idea don't let them cry don't pick it up just ignore their pleas ignore their needs and things like that don't let grandma touch it he says there are a bunch of neurotics he says god made a baby to be loved that's why he made a mother to love a baby that's why we're supposed to be this way god made it that way listen and any time that you upset god's program you must remember you are wrong and will be wrong as long as you are upsetting god's program follow god's program do it the way god said do it god hath provided a way god hath provided a way to love our children god hath provided a way to raise our children god has actually provided a way for us as believers to navigate an insane age and to treat our children in such a way with respect and decency and to raise them in such a way to we protect their minds from being neurotic made a baby to be loved we could take oh love is tough and this tough love idea and these certain ideas of love and we can miss it by a million miles he says the juvenile the juvenile delinquency is because god made children to have the parental love and parental care and so he gave parent he made parenthood for that purpose isn't it striking do you not can we see it then in in what brother branham said and the parallel at the exact same times what science said on one hand but then what they ultimately begin to discover on the other they begin to discover that brother branham uh not that they discovered the eureka moment was you know hairy harlequin that preacher in kentucky was right but it's being preached it's been expressed it's in the word of god and then scientists and the integrity that they approach these things at times they're discovering these things and they're being honest with themselves and even the peer review process and the way things get published is very very uh very remarkable in these studies because there's often times in when there's this honesty that they want to arrive at the right conclusion they let things be tested let others try it out and they see these things to be correlated because they're wanting to arrive at things at solid conclusions so they have this idea these behavioral psychologists have this idea and then these other doctors begin to look at and explore they say wait a minute we're finding evidence to the contrary and that's in their realm but let's take a step back and recognize that the word of god recognizes the air and shows that god is provided away and i don't know that science would say well yeah we're in a neurotic age and everyone's going crazy and this is insane and evil persist and this is satan's eden and this is why these things are happening no they might think we're more advanced than we've ever been we've got access to more medicine than we've ever had we got access to more treatments and more programs so we've got to figure out a way to do this but let's come back to it's the word of god that sets the standard it's the word of god that addresses these issues so we read in the very beginning ephesians chapter six verse four this is this is the way that god provided just look at how the bible speaks to this and it says ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath that's a phrase very very heavy phrase it's just a full phrase in my mouth provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up graze them up mature them grow them bring them up remember brother man says oh you just leave your kids to grow up by themselves he says but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord the nurture and admonition of the lord nurture means the whole training and instruction of the child the nurture of the lord the word nurture is a very deep word a very full word and it actually is referring to the full cultivation of the child mentally and physically it's not just providing him with something to eat so that his body matures but it's the cultivation of the mind and his morals paul isn't saying you know fathers provoke not your children to wrath by only feeding them tv dinners but bring them up with proper nutrition and grass-fed beef and avoiding grains and anything white and bleached flowers and any white sugars but it's more bring up in the nurtures the cultivation of the mind and the morals the word nurture it's instruction which aims to increase virtue in a lot of places in the word of god this very word is translated to chastisement and we automatically we think chastise we think pain right we think the belt the switch i'm going to scourge you and chastise you but chastisement is discipline or instruction and chastisement isn't harsh discipline it isn't loveless discipline if it's loveless and harsh it's not chastisement of the word of god sometimes we just get this wrong mental image of chastisement and though there could be some a punishment and some infliction of pain and during a particular age to reinforce certain things it's not shame and and the experience of this uh condemnation and shame that you try to impose chastisements make you just feel how bad and nasty you are no it's instruction which aims to increase virtue and then this phrase admonition the nurture of the lord and the admonition of the lord admonition is exhortation exhortation in this sense is the proper placing the proper setting of the mind and the emotions raise them up in the nurture of the lord teach them in a way that promotes virtue increases their virtue and cultivates their mind and their morals and and the whole training and instruction of a child develop their character and increase their increase their virtue within their spirits and then admonition this is an exhortation in other words there's praise there's instruction there's virtue that places them and settles their mind and emotions it's the bible is directly addressing this great belief system among he said modern witch doctors which said leave them alone don't speak to their emotions don't show any affection and the bible's saying no there has to be some nurture and admonition that is properly placing their mind that is properly balancing their emotions the word actually speaks to and you look at the other places it's used uh not used very often necessary but in other places it's improved means to improve their reasoning so they can reach god's solution in other words improve their thought process by going through his thought process teach your children to do that teach your children to process things the way god would process things improve their thought process improve their their handling of their emotions their measure of their emotions so that they'll reach god's solution i would say and maybe sister elizabeth could uh back this up maybe later don't need to do it on camera but that a lot of our instruction to our children is regulation of emotions and we spend a lot of time validating that you have every right to be frustrated you have every right to be mad you have every right to be hurt and upset yes i understand this is a disappointment this is painful and but you have to learn how to handle those emotions i i i don't want to be quick to tell them they're wrong to cry no crying's normal and you're gonna cry that's fine but there are certain things that you can exhibit when you're upset when you frustrated when somebody does something to harm you say no you can't do that you have to learn to process these things a different way and also reach god's solution so that if someone strikes you that hurts you get angry you want to strike them back but what would be god's solution to the problem you want to teach them to go through his thought process bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord ephesians 4 15 says but speaking the truth in love we address this here recently the christians got it all backwards we just thought when we tell somebody the truth that is love but no it means the truth has to be spoken in love speaking the truth in love it's not just taking quotations and waving them in people's face and scriptures you know what the bible says about this the bible says about that but the truth has to be spoken in love otherwise it doesn't cultivate it's only going to tear down but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ notice the spiritual this is the very literal scripture that the men men of god are to speak the truth in love and it's this truth with love and this relationship between the two and this motivating factor of speaking the truth that actually is going to nurture and cause someone to grow that speaking the truth in love will cause the church to grow up into christ and to all things and what i would say is that we can gather from that is something similar analogous to us who are to teach our children to raise them up and to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord it's speaking the truth in love and that element not in a worldly sense but in the element of what really is godly love what really is godly nurture and admonition what really is showing care and concern for your child that's what's going to cause him to grow up into the right image if i could quote harry harlow one more time he says if monkeys taught us anything if monkeys have taught us anything it's that you've got to learn to how to love before you learn how to live that that could go on instagram right with the nice beach in the background of sunset maybe a nice filter if monkeys have taught us anything that's that you've gotta learn how to love before you learn how to live and i thought that's profound that really is profound it kind of has a real catchy ring to it and i would say that there's probably a way that we could sit down as believers and figure out just maybe the right way to express it scripturally but that if it's not until not until you're living in the love of god it's not until you have eternal life which is living for others and and this love of god is motivating it's not until then that you can actually learn how to live and we might be able to find a way to substantiate it but yet i wanted just to point this out and i read this just to come to this that though he could have make profound statements such as this and he could experience even from i think was the 1930s when he began to do this research and observe these differences among these monkeys that had parental care and ones that didn't and then was motivated by this uh this idea that you know love didn't matter affection didn't matter emotions didn't matter and then you begin to see maybe this other uh side come up and say well wait a minute we think these things are very important in developmental of the development of a child he took the went to great lengths when he began to see his i want to test this hypothesis i want to test these things and he was so rigorous he got so consumed with it that his experience began to get more and more seemingly harsh and social deprivation and different circumstances with these monkeys but he was despite his dedication to this learning to love the nature of love and his dedication to child development research harry harlow was an alcoholic absentee father isn't that amazing the one who's in his laboratory and knows just how horrible detachment can be still didn't have enough in knowledge to motivate him to correct think about it you would think the best father in the world right like the best husband in the world would be chapman right the one who knows all the love languages no i don't think the guy has a relationship with any of his wives let alone his children right and some of the other ones that get a lot of air time over pulpits they have horrible relationships with their children because sometimes even though they're quoting scripture they've left the spirit of it out and you can't do that you can't do that listen the message can be preached till people are blue in the face and the spirit be out of it the real spirit of it the real the real thought behind it and it's not hitting the mark and maybe everyone culturally conforms and they look like they look like they're believers but where's the spirit of it where's the nature of it so despite all that there still was an element missing that could take an alcoholic absentee father who knew everything scientifically and cause him to act in a way that would address the need brother brandon makes this statement he says it's just built up pressure it's the age that we're living in a neurotic age where people don't know what to do where they're going and the doctors don't have the answer for it because the psychiatrists are being doctored by the psychiatrist so they have not the answer harry harlow didn't have the answer and that's exactly what brother branham said the doctors don't have the answer the psychiatrists are being doctored by the psychiatrist so they don't have the answer they can tell you what the problem is and they can use science to remedy certain maladies and to try to address certain things but they don't really have the answer he says and then in another place then the nervous neurotic age that we're living in and you know in all of this the doctors don't have the answer because they're plagued with it too they don't have the answer they don't know what to do but i'm so glad god does i'm so glad christ is the answer to this and if this seems like a just an over generalization it's the one time you're absolutely dead on correct when you just want to generalize christ has the answer this word has the answer to the neuroticism in this neurotic age where people don't know what to do they're less sure of themselves than ever they're self-doubt it's leading to anxiety it's leading to worry this this situation their home makes it even more problematic it's manifest itself everywhere science says oh you know what what we need is we need the parental care we need the love of a mother we need the attentiveness of the parenthood this needs to be strong in order to properly nurture children to not be neurotics and the very ones that are espousing that can't overcome it and can't remedy it why because it takes something more i'll just i'll end with this scripture second timothy chapter 3 verses 16 to 17 all inspiration is all scriptures given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine yes for reproof for correction for instruction there's your nurture and admonition for instruction in righteousness the word of god given by the breath of god the heart of god the thought of god the god who made the human mind i want to expand upon this more later that god made the human mind and the human body in this alignment of body spirit and soul perfect in the beginning the fall interrupts this so in the beginning adam would have been perfect harmony with his spirit his emotions and everything the fall now begins to throw emotions and embody spirit and soul out of cater the soul gets darkened so now it's a warfare between the mind and body satan has access now to those realms uh which we could get into a greater degree and it's very very fascinating to see it in the word of god and do you not think that god from the very moment that these things begin to unfold that god wasn't writing a book a manual he wasn't providing a word that would be able to address the mindset and the mentality of people at the end time he's like no no no i wrote it already a thousand years ago i'd already provoked a few thousand years before that i even in the beginning laid out the way these things work upon the mind so you can go all the way back to genesis chapter 3 and begin to recognize how this human mind can be manipulated and controlled and break down and be susceptible to certain things so all scripture is given by god's inspiration and is beneficial and profitable for reprove correction instruction and righteousness for what that the man of god and i would say that we all as believers may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works and i believe that that is speaking about the totality of our person not just the salvation of our souls but emotional harmony and the wellness of our body god is the one who can not only save the soul and heal the body but align our spirits that we might be truly furnished unto all good works the word of god is meant for that the word of god is the answer so that's the second installment of character disorders and the subject of parental love and neuroticism now do you know where i got the title brother braham says that failure of parental love that caused the neuroticism so it's our love even our love towards one another that can be health against the
