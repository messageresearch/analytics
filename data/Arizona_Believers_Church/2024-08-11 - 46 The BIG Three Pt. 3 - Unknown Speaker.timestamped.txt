[0:00] continuing on the subject of the big
[0:02] three I thought it would just be one
[0:04] sermon it's now we're on part three
[0:06] we'll probably continue on this for a
[0:08] little bit uh on Wednesday night we had
[0:11] a very simple thought we wanted to show
[0:13] how that when brother brandham talks
[0:14] about money women and
[0:16] popularity that there is a connection
[0:19] with those different things with the big
[0:21] three and we'll look at those very
[0:23] quickly here in 1 John Chapter 2 and
[0:26] when brother brandham says that these
[0:28] money women in popularity even though he
[0:30] raises it in the context of ministers it
[0:33] is something that is applicable to all
[0:35] of us because when we look into the
[0:37] scripture uh a pastor or Minister an
[0:39] elder a bishop they're all to be
[0:41] examples and examples because what they
[0:44] teach is the word of God and that we're
[0:46] all to we're all Desiring to come into
[0:49] that image of the word or Express the
[0:51] word or uh obey the word of God that we
[0:54] um he that heareth the word and then
[0:56] does the word that's what we want to be
[0:58] and so it's not just a higher calling
[1:01] because they're preaching the word but
[1:03] it's a higher calling to preach the word
[1:06] that we are to become so they themselves
[1:09] cannot be in contradiction with it
[1:11] otherwise it undermines their Doctrine
[1:13] or their teaching and as the Bible says
[1:16] the throne must be established in
[1:18] righteousness there's a lot that we
[1:20] could share how that uh teaching is is
[1:23] good and and and it's effective and
[1:26] there's those that will be able to
[1:27] receive it and benefit by it but
[1:29] ultimately what God wants is not only
[1:31] for the word to be rightly divided but
[1:32] for us to rightly live the word and so
[1:35] the application of the Temptation or the
[1:38] test or the hindrance of money women and
[1:40] popularity to minister we can all take
[1:43] instruction from and realize it in some
[1:45] ways we're going to be tempted in those
[1:48] Avenues in 1 John chapter 2: 16 that was
[1:52] my Wednesday night sermon and some of
[1:53] you who are there are going oh well why
[1:55] don't you just say that in 1 John chap
[1:57] 2:16 it says for all that is in the
[1:59] world world the lust of the Flesh and
[2:01] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[2:03] life is not of the father but is of the
[2:06] world continues to say but he that doeth
[2:08] the will of God abideth forever so we
[2:10] know that it's in the doing of the word
[2:12] living the word wherein we have that
[2:15] security but the world is comprised of
[2:18] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[2:20] eyes and the pride of life I'm saying
[2:22] this is the big three he's saying all
[2:24] that is in the world and he puts it
[2:26] under these three headings or these
[2:28] three different classifications we could
[2:30] say that well this is this is the big
[2:32] three that the world is comprised of and
[2:35] it's connected with the Temptation in
[2:36] the garden of the woman we could see the
[2:39] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[2:40] and the pride of life it's connected
[2:42] with the temptation of Christ in the
[2:44] wilderness in each one we see the lust
[2:46] of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and
[2:47] the pride of life brother Brandon refers
[2:50] to those three Temptations in Harvest
[2:52] time if so these three represent the
[2:54] three Temptations of Jesus the three
[2:56] Temptations of a minister three
[2:58] Temptations of a church the three
[3:00] Temptations of an organization he says
[3:02] the three Temptations of an individual
[3:04] and each one he's saying how they fail
[3:06] or how they fall so it it may be seem
[3:09] very very simplistic we say there's only
[3:11] two forces faith and doubt and then we
[3:13] try to establish this metric to where
[3:16] everything we do is like well am I going
[3:17] for the lowfat because I doubt or should
[3:19] I go for the full fat because I believe
[3:21] and it's not necessarily binary in that
[3:24] way but there's faith and there's doubt
[3:25] and then there's ways that that uh
[3:27] operates and in this way it's not
[3:29] that're trying to divide everything in
[3:31] the world into three different
[3:32] categories but there's three uh things
[3:35] in the world that are the the Temptation
[3:37] that are the test or that all man will
[3:39] face and it's in these categories of
[3:41] lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and
[3:43] the pride of life the lust of the flesh
[3:46] is that allowing the five senses of the
[3:48] body to control us where we we allow our
[3:50] hunger our thirst or something that
[3:52] pertains to the body to have preeminence
[3:55] where the body matters the most and
[3:56] Jesus says the body is more than food
[3:58] the body is more than meat life is more
[4:00] than me life and the body are more than
[4:02] food and rainment so he's talking about
[4:04] this uh imbalance of feeding the Flesh
[4:08] and the lust of the eyes it's allowing
[4:10] the eye to govern the body senses and
[4:12] even the spiritual senses of a person
[4:15] it's a coveting what is seen it's that
[4:17] uh Desiring for the things that satisfy
[4:19] the Flesh and things using that eye gate
[4:22] causing us to want to satisfy the lust
[4:24] of the eyes we saw that when the woman
[4:26] saw that the tree was pleasant to the
[4:28] eyes you saw the lust of the the flesh
[4:30] when she saw that it was good for food
[4:32] Christ turning the stones to bread was
[4:34] tempted to the lust of the flesh when he
[4:36] was showing all the kingdoms of the
[4:37] world he was tempted to the lust of the
[4:40] eyes and when he was told to cast
[4:42] himself down that was the pride of life
[4:45] and the woman herself seeing that it was
[4:47] to be desired to make one wise that's
[4:49] the pride of life the pride of life is a
[4:52] desire for recognition it's seeking
[4:54] honor or status and as I've looked at it
[4:57] and continued to study hoping maybe to
[4:59] take some time on each one of these in
[5:01] more detail and then also line it up
[5:03] with money women and popularity you can
[5:06] see how that this pride of life in some
[5:08] ways is hoping that through satisfying
[5:10] the lust of the Flesh and the lust of
[5:12] the eyes it'll Advance your standing
[5:14] cause you to become accepted or or to
[5:16] have power because there's things that
[5:19] you do to satisfy the body and then
[5:21] there's things that we do to Adorn the
[5:23] Flesh and to satisfy the eye and in some
[5:26] ways there's this Vin diagram where
[5:28] they're overlapping and the pride life
[5:30] uh is feeding off these others to in the
[5:32] sense of how does it make me better and
[5:34] how can I appear to be righteous and how
[5:37] can people think I'm beautiful or have
[5:38] power I have a lot of followers and
[5:41] really when it comes to social media all
[5:42] you need is a filter and a bot and you
[5:46] can get a lot of
[5:48] followers so the big three it's the
[5:50] devil's satanic Trinity it's his schemes
[5:54] his attacks his methods in James chapter
[5:57] 3: 13 to1 18 I'm going to use this to
[6:00] pull from Matthew Chapter 13 go a little
[6:03] bit further and kind of this symmetry of
[6:05] the threes who is a wise man endued with
[6:08] knowledge among you let him show out of
[6:11] a good conversation his works with
[6:14] meekness of wisdom this the the seed is
[6:18] the word of God as Jesus is teaching us
[6:20] even in that the wheat and the tears in
[6:22] that Parable the seed is the word of God
[6:24] the seed is the gospel that is sown and
[6:27] the seed is the word which bring brings
[6:29] forth fruit of righteousness so there's
[6:32] this A wise man who is endued with
[6:35] knowledge he will show this through a
[6:38] life and it demonstrates the meekness of
[6:41] wisdom but if you have bitter envy and
[6:44] strife in your hearts Glory not and lie
[6:47] not against the truth this wisdom
[6:49] descendeth not from above but as
[6:53] Earthly sensual devilish for where envy
[6:57] and strife is there's confusion in every
[6:59] evil work but the wisdom that is from
[7:02] above is first pure then Peaceable
[7:05] gentle easy to be entreated full of
[7:07] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[7:10] and without hypocrisy and the fruit of
[7:13] righteousness is swn in peace of them
[7:15] that make peace so this is the seed that
[7:18] is sown is to find good ground and bring
[7:20] forth fruit unto Perfection or fruit of
[7:22] righteousness but Satan tries to take it
[7:26] away or the flesh is offended by that
[7:29] word or the world tries to choke it out
[7:33] the world is the word is to produce good
[7:36] conversation works with meekness of the
[7:38] that demonstrate the meekness of wisdom
[7:41] but Satan wants to snatch the word out
[7:43] of your heart some of us become offended
[7:45] or the world just chokes it out but the
[7:48] wise man endued with true knowledge will
[7:50] show the word by the fruits of his
[7:54] life and so James immediately goes to
[7:57] but if you have bitter and Envy in your
[7:58] hearts Satan wants to seow a different
[8:02] seed he wants to produce bitter envi and
[8:05] and strife in order to bring forth the
[8:07] fruit of Confusion And every evil work
[8:10] so the seeds are bitter envy and the
[8:12] seed is Strife so that it can produce
[8:15] this confusion this chaos and evil
[8:18] works and all that is in the world we
[8:21] could say this connecting it with the
[8:23] big three all that is in the world is
[8:25] Earthly which pertains to the flesh
[8:28] sensual as it pertains to the eye in
[8:30] devilish as it pertains to the pride
[8:33] pride of life each one of these we can
[8:35] see that that which is from U below that
[8:38] descendeth not from above is Earthly
[8:40] it's the lust of the flesh it's it's
[8:42] sensual it's the lust of the eyes and
[8:44] it's devilish the pride of life uh it's
[8:48] a partner with that Pride that was in
[8:50] Lucifer in the beginning I believe these
[8:53] things just fit so well if you listen to
[8:54] the sermons on uh Power without
[8:57] character and the image of God that
[8:58] brother elizer are ministered just much
[9:00] more rich and full that you could go
[9:02] draw from that how that Satan had a
[9:04] perverted image of what God was he said
[9:07] I want to be like the most high a and
[9:10] the way the brother elzar uh
[9:12] demonstrated that I know some of you
[9:13] prob saying who's Brother elzar everyone
[9:15] calls him brother Eli but I call him
[9:17] brother elzer I like the name and
[9:20] there's a um uh this image that Satan
[9:23] had of God His image that he had in his
[9:26] mind his perception of God was perverted
[9:28] so what he wanted to become was
[9:31] perverted and so there's Satan has this
[9:34] desire this pride of life he has a the
[9:36] the Earthly flesh the sensual
[9:39] eyes and the sermon wisdom versus Faith
[9:42] as this this scripture and I think even
[9:44] brother brandham uses this scripture in
[9:46] that sermon how that this wisdom which
[9:48] is from above uh brother brother Reggie
[9:52] Reginald Ben David PL
[9:56] said or brother Ben brother Reggie
[9:58] there's a lot of we got to get them all
[10:00] cuz there's a different group here and
[10:01] some know you by different names brother
[10:03] PL PL he was sharing with me some quotes
[10:05] last week on that Trinity above which is
[10:08] uh cont pertains to God and that demonic
[10:11] Trinity from below and so it's those
[10:13] evil Things From Below those spirits and
[10:16] those demon powers and the devil that
[10:18] works from below H it's it's contrary to
[10:21] the wisdom that is from
[10:23] above and brother bramman wisdom versus
[10:26] Faith he says Satan could scientifically
[10:28] prove by his his wisdom that the soil he
[10:31] was going to give for the human race to
[10:33] grow in had vitamins so Satan has this
[10:36] ground or this this soil that he wants
[10:39] to grow the human uh race in he could
[10:43] scientifically prove it he said they can
[10:45] scientifically prove anything they want
[10:46] to almost so that's just where that's
[10:50] come to you can't trust them anymore the
[10:53] number of scientific articles and things
[10:55] that are retracted and studies which are
[10:57] fabricated it's just starting to get out
[10:59] of hand because there's no Integrity
[11:01] anymore but brother brandom in this
[11:03] sermon wisdom versus Faith he gives
[11:05] these different vitamins Satan's wisdom
[11:08] soil contains these vitamin vitamin P he
[11:12] says for pleasure and popularity vitamin
[11:14] C for common sense vitamin R for
[11:18] reasoning vitamin B for beauty vitamin M
[11:20] for modern you go and read it it's
[11:23] really interesting how he's showing
[11:24] these different vitamins are all in this
[11:26] soil in order to produce the crop that
[11:28] Satan wants to produce he says
[11:29] ultimately the most uh the one that's
[11:32] the maybe the strongest is the vitamin D
[11:36] death there's so much research around
[11:39] vitamin
[11:40] D uh in the natural but this vitamin P
[11:43] and vitamin C vitamin R Vitamin B and
[11:45] vitamin M the pleasure popularity Common
[11:48] Sense reasoning Beauty it's to be modern
[11:50] and then vitamin D death but brother
[11:53] Bram says but Faith only grows in one
[11:56] vitamin or vitamin it only has one vit
[11:59] vitamin don't have to have any mixture
[12:02] at all Faith grows in one vitamin that's
[12:05] the word that's the only thing that
[12:07] faith can grow in is the word and the
[12:09] only way that it can grow is because it
[12:10] believes the word and has to take all
[12:13] the word and it's believe it's true and
[12:15] Faith vitamin is spelled in a little
[12:17] four-letter word l i f life it has
[12:22] vitamin L faith has vitamin
[12:25] L life the word that's what faith uh
[12:30] that's all that it needs to grow because
[12:32] it believes the word and it's going to
[12:34] grow life so that's the most important
[12:37] thing is Faith and Faith growing by the
[12:42] word or growing by life that's the
[12:45] vitamin that we need now there's a lot
[12:47] of these other things that we are in the
[12:49] soil that we live in Pleasures
[12:51] popularity Common Sense reasoning Beauty
[12:53] and modern and ultimately death but we
[12:55] have to be very uh uh recognized that
[12:58] though might be getting these vitamins
[13:00] by the natural man we better be sure
[13:02] we're getting our vitamin L by the
[13:04] spiritual
[13:07] man in James 1: 13-1
[13:11] 17 says let no man say when he is
[13:13] tempted I am tempted of God for God
[13:15] cannot temp be tempted with evil neither
[13:18] tempteth he any man but every man is
[13:21] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[13:24] lust and enticed this there's just a
[13:27] formula here then when lost hath
[13:29] conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin
[13:32] when it is finished bringeth forth death
[13:35] true do not Heir my beloved Brethren
[13:37] every good and perfect gift is from
[13:39] above and cometh down from the Father of
[13:42] Lights with whom is no variableness
[13:44] neither shadow of turning you have the
[13:47] things that are from below that are
[13:49] Earthly sensual and devilish but now you
[13:51] have a wisdom which is from above every
[13:54] good and perfect gift is from above
[13:57] there's no shadow in it there's no
[13:58] variable
[14:00] and he says that we ought not to
[14:03] attribute our mistakes or our failures
[14:05] to God because God hath tempted us but
[14:08] every man is tempted when and here's the
[14:11] formula he's first drawn away of his own
[14:14] lust and
[14:15] enticed then when that lust hath
[14:18] conceived it brings forth sin and sin
[14:21] when it is finished it brings forth
[14:23] death you have the three stages one of
[14:26] lust one of sin and then death it ref
[14:29] refs how Satan works not only on the
[14:30] individual but also how he worked
[14:32] against the church and the church ages
[14:35] brother Bradman the church age book
[14:36] writes as Sin started in nothing but a
[14:40] feeling so the death to the church
[14:42] started with the simple little notice
[14:44] Deeds of the
[14:45] nicians it's important for us to
[14:47] recognize how that Satan first wants to
[14:50] get to us through the subtlety of sewing
[14:52] seed the subtlety of his vitamins the
[14:54] subtlety of things that we might think
[14:56] are harmless but if Satan can get that
[14:58] in the right kind of of soil and we can
[15:00] nurture it with the wrong kind of
[15:01] environment that it could bring forth
[15:03] the fruit that Satan desires to see and
[15:06] sin started with nothing but a feeling
[15:08] and we need to be very careful that we
[15:09] do not go by feelings because if we do
[15:12] that's where sin can
[15:14] start and in the church age book chapter
[15:16] 3 that other prior one was from the
[15:18] thyrian age in chapter 6 he goes through
[15:21] this step or formul it was called Deeds
[15:24] then it became a Doctrine we see this in
[15:27] the scripture that first it starts as a
[15:29] deed sin begins as a feeling it's just a
[15:31] a deed a little notice deed but once
[15:34] that deed kind of begins to have a
[15:35] little bit of preeminence and
[15:36] recognition then it becomes a Doctrine
[15:39] for now it's not just a feeling but it's
[15:41] you better have the same feeling it's
[15:43] not just a little deed it's now everyone
[15:45] has to do the same deeds and so it's
[15:47] called Deeds then it becomes a Doctrine
[15:49] listen he says it became the
[15:52] standard it became the unbending
[15:55] way it finally took over and God was
[15:58] pushed aside
[15:59] oh it started so small so quietly so
[16:02] inoffensively this is Satan's method of
[16:05] operation start with the feeling start
[16:07] something small start something simple
[16:10] and then once it starts to begin to work
[16:12] then make it the standard this is the
[16:14] way that it has to be this is the way
[16:16] that everyone has to do it then make it
[16:18] the unbending way so that when no one
[16:20] else is doing it they're immediately cut
[16:21] off or at least
[16:24] persecuted he says it looked good seemed
[16:26] good then it caught a hold like a python
[16:29] it squeezed out the very breath and
[16:32] killed all the spirituality there was in
[16:34] the church oh that false Vine is subtle
[16:38] it is like an angel of Light until it
[16:40] gets a hold on
[16:43] you Deeds are feeling become Doctrine
[16:46] they become the law the standard the
[16:48] have to and it leads to death brother
[16:51] brandom said it became crowned in death
[16:53] Deeds Doctrine death lust sin death
[16:58] that's how the devil Works through lust
[17:01] these three Temptations these three uh
[17:04] three channels money women popularity
[17:05] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[17:07] eyes and the pride of life working to
[17:09] produce sin so that it can produce
[17:13] death and Jude uh verse 11 it says wo
[17:17] unto them for they have gone in the way
[17:21] of
[17:21] Cain and ran greedily after the heir of
[17:25] balum for reward and perished in the
[17:28] gain
[17:29] of Kora there a lot of threes when you
[17:32] begin to match these things up the way
[17:34] of Cain we can show is the lust of the
[17:36] eye the he of balam the lust of the
[17:39] flesh the gains saying of cor the pride
[17:42] of
[17:43] life they rebelled because they weren't
[17:45] given a position in the priesthood it's
[17:48] the pride of life why can't we be
[17:51] recognized why can't we have the
[17:53] opportunity Cain through the lust of the
[17:55] eye wanted something beautiful and
[17:57] pleasing and certainly it was swn into
[17:59] him genetically and the heir of balum
[18:01] the lust of the
[18:03] flesh remember part of overcoming is
[18:05] recognizing Satan and all of his tricks
[18:08] that we are to not be ignorant of his
[18:11] devices and so I know that in
[18:13] ministering on these things I'm not
[18:15] ministering anything new if anything
[18:18] it's repetition of things that we've
[18:19] often heard about lust and Temptation
[18:21] and struggles and trials but if there's
[18:23] a way that we can continue to expose how
[18:26] the devil works and make us more
[18:28] sensitive an alert in how he works in
[18:30] demonic Realms both religiously and
[18:32] spiritually and also through perversions
[18:34] in our flesh we can be better equipped
[18:36] ourselves to overcome them and hopefully
[18:39] what we then can do is learn by our own
[18:41] overcoming and Revelation how to protect
[18:43] the hearts of our children and to not
[18:45] lay a stumbling block in front of other
[18:49] people Wednesday night I believe we were
[18:51] leaving leaving off on this particular
[18:53] scripture in 1 Corinthians 10: 11- 14
[18:57] now all these things happen unto them
[18:59] for amples and they are written for our
[19:01] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[19:03] world are come the scriptures tell us
[19:06] the story in the Old Testament and then
[19:08] again in the New Testament especially in
[19:10] the Book of Revelation as prophecy so
[19:12] that they can be examples to us and
[19:15] admonish
[19:16] us we're we're told of The Exodus we're
[19:19] told of the failures and the prophecies
[19:21] and all sorts of things so that we can
[19:23] be we can learn from them wherefore let
[19:27] him that thinketh he standeth to take
[19:29] heed lest he
[19:30] fall there is a a great warning in that
[19:34] pride in which we think that we are
[19:36] secure and we can't be tempted and we
[19:38] won't make a mistake so he says be
[19:40] careful and he says not so much to
[19:43] condemn somebody from having confidence
[19:46] or to uh abandon us to the thought that
[19:49] well I can't think that I stand I guess
[19:51] I'm just going to fall and might as well
[19:53] accept the fall but he says there hath
[19:54] no temptation taken you but such as as
[19:57] common to man
[19:59] and we say Yes Man is tempted Christ was
[20:02] tempted in all points in like manner as
[20:04] we are Elijah even a man subject of like
[20:06] passions we see that there's something
[20:08] common to all men and women in terms of
[20:10] Temptation and weakness and things that
[20:12] the devil fights against us the lust of
[20:14] the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride
[20:16] of life we all fight with him but God is
[20:18] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[20:20] tempted above that ye are able but will
[20:23] with the Temptation also make a way to
[20:25] escape that you may be able to bear it
[20:29] what a what a testimony that in all of
[20:32] these things God will make a way to
[20:35] escape that yes The Temptations will be
[20:38] present and we don't we could pray Lord
[20:40] I don't want to be tempted Lord I I let
[20:43] it not come near me let me just not see
[20:45] it let me avoid it altto together and I
[20:47] I'm not going to encourage you or
[20:48] counsel you not to pray in that manner
[20:50] but then we ought to have the kind of
[20:52] Faith to believe that if God would allow
[20:54] us to be tempted or that Satan would
[20:56] work his way near to us we find
[20:58] ourselves in the throws of some sort of
[21:00] Temptation to begin to look for God's
[21:02] way of now the Bible says they ran
[21:06] greedily after the error of balum for
[21:09] reward he becomes a very good character
[21:12] study especially in light of the fact
[21:15] that Paul says uh he that thinks he
[21:18] stands be careful lest he fall bam is a
[21:22] good example of that but then also
[21:24] there's no temptation taking you but
[21:26] such as common demand so there's this
[21:28] that balum had or maybe this security he
[21:32] began to feel that he thought that he
[21:33] could get away with something and then
[21:35] we could also say that whatever balum
[21:37] faced and whatever he was tempted with
[21:39] we likewise can be tempted
[21:41] too balum the word means not of the
[21:45] people and the scripture refers to him
[21:48] as a
[21:50] prophet but then there's also another
[21:52] place where he's referred to as a
[21:54] soothsayer or divver not necessarily one
[21:57] in a in a good
[21:59] way and if you look into the scriptures
[22:01] you'll find that God does speak to balum
[22:03] traditionally amongst the Israelites and
[22:05] their oral tradition and historically he
[22:08] was regarded as a great prophet who
[22:11] spoke things that came to pass as we'll
[22:13] see in the scripture that even Bao
[22:15] recognized that the words that balum
[22:17] spoke came true so in numbers chap
[22:22] 22:6 Bayo says come now therefore I pray
[22:25] thee to balam he has summoned him curse
[22:27] me this people people that's come up out
[22:30] of Egypt for they are too Mighty for
[22:33] me per Adventure I shall Prevail that we
[22:36] may Smite them and then I may drive them
[22:39] out of the land for I what that he whom
[22:41] thou has for I what that he whom thou
[22:44] blessed is blessed and him who thou
[22:46] curseth is cursed he knew that balum if
[22:50] he blessed someone they were blessed if
[22:51] they were cursed they were cursed so
[22:54] he's asking bam if he would curse these
[22:57] people he didn't know who they were and
[22:58] even balum is like I I don't know who
[23:00] these people are and so he says in verse
[23:03] 13 and balum Rose up in the OR balum
[23:06] goes before the Lord and the Lord says
[23:08] who are these people that come to you he
[23:09] says they've come to me and want me to
[23:10] curse this people that's come up out of
[23:12] Egypt and so God tells them uh speaks to
[23:16] him and then B balam comes back and says
[23:18] rose up in the morning and said unto the
[23:20] princes of Bao get you into your land go
[23:22] back for the Lord refuses to give me
[23:25] leave to go with you so bam is refusing
[23:29] to do what he was asked to curse this
[23:32] people that came up out of
[23:34] Egypt then in verse 17 Bao is going to
[23:37] try again he's saying curse them for I
[23:40] will promote thee un very great honor
[23:42] and I will do whatsoever thou sayest
[23:44] unto me come therefore I pray thee curse
[23:47] me this people now he's trying to not
[23:51] just plead to him that whatever you say
[23:54] seems to come to pass and I want to go
[23:56] to war against these people and I want
[23:58] to overthrow them so will you curse them
[24:00] and Bam's like well yeah let me go
[24:02] before the Lord let me find out whether
[24:04] or not I should he comes back and says
[24:05] the Lord told me not to go with you and
[24:07] so he says he's wants to try a different
[24:09] way and if you go back and read this F
[24:12] you'll see how Bayo each time is going
[24:16] to him and saying well here he says I'll
[24:18] promote thee and then he says well maybe
[24:19] if I do it over here or maybe if I do it
[24:21] over there and he's trying to move him
[24:22] around hoping that change your scenery
[24:25] will
[24:25] help he says the Lord refuseth me to
[24:28] leave you so he says well I will to go
[24:29] with you I promote Thee I will honor you
[24:31] you can have whatever I want you asked
[24:33] for bam answered and said now just think
[24:36] of this from the standpoint of we have
[24:37] no idea who balam is the unnamed prophet
[24:41] he says unto the Servants of bik if Bao
[24:43] would give me his house full of silver
[24:46] and gold I cannot go beyond the word of
[24:48] the Lord my God to do less or
[24:51] more wow all right
[24:55] balum you have another son name name him
[24:57] balum right this is this is sounding
[25:00] pretty good and he gets what Bao is
[25:03] saying because he says I'll give them to
[25:05] the great honor I give you whatever he
[25:06] could give me his house full of silver
[25:08] and gold and I won't go beyond what the
[25:10] word of the Lord says now therefore I
[25:12] pray you Terry ye also hear this night
[25:14] that I may know what the Lord will say
[25:16] unto me
[25:17] more and God came unto balam at night
[25:20] and said unto him now focus on this
[25:22] because we'll come back to this I think
[25:24] two more times if the men come to call
[25:26] thee rise up and go with them but yet
[25:29] the word which I shall say unto you thee
[25:31] Thou shalt thou do this is what he has
[25:33] to do whatever God says that shalt thou
[25:38] do don't do what you want do what I say
[25:41] say what I say bam rose up in the
[25:43] morning and Saddles ass and went with
[25:45] the princes of Moab so he's go he he
[25:48] gets up and he's going to go but he
[25:49] knows I can only say what God wants me
[25:51] to say if you read continue to read
[25:54] there and if you want to take time I'll
[25:55] just hit some highlights here balam
[25:57] never cursed Israel with his
[26:00] mouth there there's nothing on the face
[26:03] of this story is he even read it up to
[26:04] verse to end of chapter 24 to where it
[26:07] appears that balam accepts the
[26:10] bribe first he said hey will you curse
[26:13] these people and and and balum being a
[26:15] prophet says well I don't want to be too
[26:17] quick to curse him I don't want to be
[26:19] too quick to try to help you achieve
[26:21] your Victory so let me go before the
[26:22] Lord and the Lord tells him speaks to
[26:24] him so he goes back and says I can't go
[26:26] with you so then B and the princes try a
[26:29] different attack well you we ask for
[26:32] your help you don't want to help but
[26:33] what if we give you a lot of money what
[26:35] if we give you a house full of silver
[26:36] and gold and what if you do this he says
[26:38] I won't go beyond what God's told me to
[26:40] say no matter what you give me amen and
[26:44] in numbers 22:38 balam said unto B lo I
[26:47] am come unto thee have I now any power
[26:50] at all to say anything the word that God
[26:53] putteth in my mouth that shall I speak I
[26:56] mean this is bam is appearing to be a
[26:59] man of great character and
[27:01] integrity he seems to be one that's
[27:03] holding very closely to the word of God
[27:05] and wanting to honor the Lord and not
[27:06] deviate from it you can go into the
[27:09] message of the hour and find a lot great
[27:11] a lot more statements to this respect
[27:12] but in Numbers Chapter 23 he offers on
[27:15] seven altars seven Rams and seven oxen
[27:18] numerically correct his typology was
[27:20] correct he was offering I think brother
[27:22] bam says in some place he was more uh H
[27:24] as far as in his offerings and his
[27:26] typology and numerology more perfect
[27:28] than
[27:30] Moses so here he is seemingly hitting on
[27:33] all points and and doing these things to
[27:36] honor the word of the Lord and as balam
[27:40] is offering these seven Rams and seven
[27:42] oxen on seven altars in numbers 23: 4
[27:45] and 5 and God met
[27:49] balum and he balum said unto him I have
[27:51] prepared seven altars and I've offered
[27:53] upon every altar a bulock and a ram
[27:55] think of what is what these things are
[27:57] testifying of
[27:59] what they're what they're foreshadowing
[28:01] and the Lord put a word in balam's mouth
[28:05] and said return unto Bao and thus Thou
[28:07] shalt speak nothing to this point
[28:10] suggests that balum will do anything
[28:13] other than say exactly what God put in
[28:16] his mouth sir and he does that you'll
[28:19] find that b brings him to three
[28:20] different places and and balum
[28:22] prophesies I believe four times
[28:24] ultimately the first Oracle the second
[28:26] Oracle the third and then the final
[28:27] Oracle and every time he's only saying
[28:30] what God would have him to
[28:32] say numbers 23:12 and he answered and
[28:35] said must not must I not take heed to
[28:38] speak that which the Lord hath put in my
[28:41] mouth verse 26 and 7 27 and balum
[28:46] answered and said unto BAC told not I
[28:48] Thee saying all that the Lord speaketh
[28:50] that I must do no words every time that
[28:53] bik asked him to curse after he became
[28:55] to tried to bribe him and take him to
[28:56] these different places and show him
[28:58] different things and after he prophesied
[29:00] blessing he said well come over with me
[29:01] over here to this high place and and try
[29:04] it here and he keeps trying these
[29:05] different ways to entice him and cause
[29:06] him to
[29:07] fall he said told not I Thee saying all
[29:12] that the Lord speaketh that I must do
[29:14] and Balo said unto balum come I pray
[29:17] thee I will bring thee Uno another place
[29:20] per Adventure it will please God that
[29:21] thou mayest curse me them from
[29:25] then once again he keeps trying it
[29:28] right I just want to kind of throw this
[29:30] out there at what point is balum
[29:33] sounding a lot like
[29:35] Samson like tell me what your secret is
[29:38] well if I eat a day old oatmeal I'll be
[29:41] sick what's for breakfast Delila day old
[29:47] oatmeal and it's like come
[29:49] on like wake up
[29:53] Samson and once again good God does not
[29:57] let balam curse
[29:59] Israel once again when balam opens his
[30:02] mouth blessings come out
[30:06] prophecies powerful things that are
[30:08] spoken it is balum who said God is not
[30:11] like God is not like the son of man to
[30:16] lie in numbers 24: 10 to14 we kind of
[30:20] see this boiling over and bik's anger
[30:22] was kindled against balum and he smote
[30:24] his hands together and Balo said unto
[30:25] balum I called thee to curse my enemies
[30:28] and behold thou has altogether blessed
[30:30] them these three times therefore now
[30:33] flee thou to thy place I thought to
[30:36] promote thee into great honor but Lo the
[30:39] Lord hath kept thee back from honor
[30:41] that's persuasive you could have been
[30:44] something if you could have just kept
[30:46] your if you could have just got happy
[30:48] with the way I did things you could have
[30:50] been it's kept you back from honor and
[30:54] balam said unto Bic spake I not also to
[30:56] thy Messengers which thou sent this unto
[30:58] me saying now it's going all the way
[31:00] back to the beginning if Bayo would give
[31:03] me his house full of silver and gold I
[31:06] cannot go beyond the Commandment of the
[31:07] Lord to do either good or bad of my own
[31:10] mind but what the Lord saith that will I
[31:15] speak and you'd have to go back and
[31:17] check the record and be
[31:19] like yep maybe Bayo says princes tell me
[31:23] Messengers tell me what did he say let's
[31:26] go check the tweets let's see see let's
[31:28] see exactly what he said in the DMS and
[31:30] it's go back says if he give me his
[31:33] house full of silver and gold I cannot
[31:35] go beyond the Commandment of the lord
[31:38] it's what he
[31:40] said and
[31:41] then the final Oracle balam says and now
[31:44] behold I go unto my people come
[31:46] therefore and I will advertise to thee
[31:49] what this people shall do to thy people
[31:51] in the latter days read the remainder of
[31:53] verse chapter 24 and he's speaking these
[31:56] great prophecies very specific things
[31:59] and to close out the chapter in verse 25
[32:01] and balum Rose up and went and returned
[32:03] to his place and Bao also went his
[32:08] way we stop in the reading and this is
[32:12] where we get really the story of
[32:14] balum in reading this if we were to make
[32:18] this a subject of discussion or take
[32:20] this text and produce to us a character
[32:23] study or tell us your thoughts if we
[32:25] just said he's an unnamed prophet and
[32:27] change the tell in such a way to only to
[32:29] go by his actions in chapters 22 23 and
[32:32] 24 we would say that balum was a true
[32:35] Prophet who said only what God told him
[32:39] to say was not a word rejector was one
[32:43] that when he was speaking or preaching
[32:45] he seemed to be really in line and in
[32:47] harmony with the word of God there's a a
[32:50] lot that it appears to be
[32:53] correct and it his story ends with him
[32:55] apparently turning down Bao and as we
[32:58] read in the prophecies and go forward in
[33:00] history say balam is saying a lot of
[33:02] true
[33:03] things but then we read in Micah chap 6
[33:06] verse5 oh my people remember now what
[33:10] Balo king of Moab
[33:13] consulted and what balum the son of beor
[33:16] answered him from sheum unto gilgal that
[33:19] ye may know the righteousness of the
[33:21] Lord God's correctness God's judgment
[33:24] God's justice remember Bayo in he tried
[33:28] to do remember
[33:29] balum how he answered from sheum under
[33:33] gilgal so Micah is kind of pointing us
[33:36] out something thank you Micah and and
[33:38] he's showing us something to think about
[33:39] with balum so when we go to sheum it
[33:43] says in numbers 25 veres 1 to5 balum has
[33:46] gone his way bik has gone the other way
[33:49] and the next thing we know in Israel
[33:52] Abode in
[33:53] shom and the people began to commit
[33:56] whoredom with the Daughters of
[33:59] Moab after all these
[34:01] blessings right after all these
[34:05] blessings upon Israel The Chosen the
[34:08] people the bride yeah he said they begin
[34:11] to commit whoredom with the daughters of
[34:12] Moab and they called The People Under
[34:15] The sacrifices of their gods the
[34:16] daughters do this now and the people did
[34:21] eat starting there even with the lust of
[34:24] the Flesh and bowed down to their gods
[34:27] and Israel joined himself into Bel peor
[34:29] now there's a lot of Rich history on
[34:31] this and the message of the hour brings
[34:33] out the the wor the worst thing that
[34:35] they're doing and how they're joining
[34:36] themselves and the anger of the Lord was
[34:39] kindled against Israel and the Lord said
[34:41] unto Moses take all the heads of the
[34:43] people and hang them up before the Lord
[34:44] against the Sun that the fierce anger of
[34:47] the Lord may be turned away from Israel
[34:49] now I just kind of let that wash over
[34:51] you a little bit this was a tremendous
[34:55] offense in all everything that was
[34:58] trying to
[34:59] do to get balam to curse the people of
[35:03] God and every time balum opens his mouth
[35:05] the people are blessed but now in just a
[35:08] very short time and we're not given the
[35:10] benefit and the scripture tells us like
[35:11] five days later a few moments later or
[35:13] whatever it might be it says now all of
[35:16] a sudden Israel's joined themselves to
[35:17] bayor and God is saying cut off all the
[35:20] heads and Moses send to the judges of
[35:23] Israel slay everyone his men that were
[35:27] joined joed under
[35:29] bpor kill your own people any one of
[35:32] them that were joined to that Feast any
[35:33] one of them that laid with that women
[35:34] any one of them cut their heads
[35:37] off the men did eat and they
[35:41] bowed and then they were killed started
[35:44] off as a deed then it became a doctorine
[35:46] then it became
[35:48] death immediately after numbers
[35:52] 24 Israel Falls in whoredom and
[35:56] idolatry immediately
[35:58] now I know what you're
[36:00] thinking this must have something to do
[36:02] with balum is that what you're
[36:04] thinking you guys are nervous do I play
[36:07] tricks too
[36:10] often one time I said if I told you that
[36:12] the tail of a horse was a
[36:14] leg how many legs does a horse have and
[36:17] how
[36:18] many four no matter what I tell you
[36:22] right a horse only has four legs and
[36:25] that's the kind of stuff maybe your
[36:26] thinking is happening right now bam I
[36:28] don't even know who you're talking about
[36:30] so let's go back to Numbers 22 and see
[36:32] if we can't find if God isn't already
[36:34] foreshadowing to us this lust that's in
[36:37] balam's
[36:39] heart verse 20 and God came unto balam
[36:42] at night and said unto him and this is
[36:44] after he is well I guess we'll we'll go
[36:46] back we'll see this and God came to
[36:48] balam at night and said to him if men
[36:49] come to call thee rise up and go with
[36:51] them but yet the word which I shall say
[36:53] unto thee Thou shalt do so that's what
[36:55] we focus on God's only say what I say
[36:58] and balum Rose up in the morning and
[37:00] saddled his ass and went with the
[37:01] princes of Moab and then verse 22 all of
[37:04] a sudden comes out of the middle of
[37:05] nowhere God's anger was kindled against
[37:08] he kindled because he
[37:10] went and the angel Lord stood in the way
[37:13] for an adversary against him now he was
[37:15] riding upon his ass and his two servants
[37:17] were with him and you know the story how
[37:18] that the the angel of Lord stands in the
[37:21] way and and the the donkey sees it and
[37:24] you know he ramming him up against the
[37:25] side doesn't want to go and finally it
[37:26] speaks to him says hey man I'm not going
[37:28] to go beyond this but God God speaks to
[37:33] him and he seems to say that well if
[37:37] they come to you rise up and go with
[37:39] them and then whatever I say you say but
[37:41] then God gets angry when balum gets up
[37:43] and
[37:44] goes God knew the greed that was in
[37:47] balam's heart now you might say well I
[37:50] can say that because that's how he's
[37:52] memorialized later so it's it's not like
[37:54] I'm you know God told me last night I
[37:56] said whoa what's happening here he says
[37:58] I I think he's greedy right it's in the
[38:00] scripture so God knew that there was
[38:02] greed in balam's heart and I want you to
[38:04] catch this now I want us to think about
[38:07] ourselves and judge ourselves by this
[38:09] there was something in balum where he
[38:12] still wanted to hold open the chance for
[38:16] Honor I I want to be careful how I deal
[38:19] with this guy because if I if I if I
[38:23] come on too strong or say too much maybe
[38:25] I won't get what he has to give
[38:28] me remember I was put in a situation one
[38:30] time where a particular brother was
[38:32] asking me to do do some work and there
[38:34] was things in my heart that began to
[38:35] check me not on the legality of it or
[38:36] anything like that but with respect to
[38:38] his character and I found myself Limited
[38:40] in being able to as a brother and as a
[38:43] friend challenge him or correct him or
[38:46] or be honest because this well I don't
[38:48] want to lose the
[38:49] job okay so this is something that's I
[38:53] think we can all draw from something in
[38:55] him wanted to hold up this CH the this
[38:58] opportunity for gain as brother elzer
[39:01] was preaching in power without character
[39:03] God knew the the motive of balam's soul
[39:07] that was a powerful statement when you
[39:09] said there's a lot of things that we're
[39:10] working through on the outward but God
[39:12] looks down and he sees the character the
[39:14] motive in Bam's Soul because as we're
[39:16] reading through this and and I'm not
[39:18] saying this to trick you I'm just saying
[39:20] it objectively and maybe for you
[39:22] subjectively as we read the story of
[39:24] balam from chapter 22 to chapter 24 just
[39:27] raise your hand if on the face he seems
[39:29] like he's doing a good job I mean all
[39:32] right for the rest of you we can talk
[39:33] about
[39:34] it and so there's but God sees something
[39:38] that maybe we don't see so in numbers
[39:41] 22:12 we're going back this is when God
[39:44] first speaks to balum about balo's plan
[39:48] and God said unto balum Thou shalt not
[39:50] go with
[39:51] them Thou shalt not curse the people for
[39:55] they are blessed this is what balam
[39:59] knows so watch verse 13 and balum Rose
[40:03] up in the morning and said unto the
[40:05] prince of Bic get you into your land for
[40:07] the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go
[40:10] with
[40:11] you it's what he doesn't say which
[40:14] betrays what's in his heart he knows
[40:17] that Bayo wants him to curse Israel then
[40:21] Bic offers him honor and a lot of stuff
[40:24] to do it so he knows that God said don't
[40:28] go with them but he also said don't
[40:32] curse them but balam is somewhat Coy
[40:35] about it well let me go see what God
[40:38] will
[40:39] say pre- Adventure he might put words in
[40:42] my mouth that we curse Israel and I can
[40:45] get a house full of gold and
[40:48] silver balum voice will it work can we
[40:50] do a a skit with
[40:53] that and he says God doesn't want me to
[40:57] go with you but he doesn't tell
[40:59] them that God told him not to curse
[41:02] Israel because of
[41:04] greed now that those are my words it's
[41:06] what I'm deducing from scripture so what
[41:08] I'll say is that could it be that God
[41:11] saw into his
[41:12] soul and then so now watch this this is
[41:15] what God sees balam was dishonest at
[41:18] first he only told part of the story
[41:20] that's why when you look at the message
[41:21] of the hour we can focus all we want and
[41:24] just emphasize don't go don't go don't
[41:26] go but is also whatever you do don't
[41:28] curse and you've got to be balanced in
[41:31] the message of the hour or you can just
[41:32] start seeing the things that you like
[41:35] seeing these things and pulling them out
[41:37] and pulling them out and anymore the
[41:39] longer that you spend in the message in
[41:41] fellowship with certain people that come
[41:42] under some sort of fanaticism about some
[41:45] pet Doctrine or some ideal they can find
[41:48] millions of quotes just as scientists
[41:51] can scientifically prove to you anything
[41:53] they want to brandom mites can prove to
[41:56] you just about anything they want to
[41:58] using quotations of the
[42:00] Prophet but they do it
[42:03] dishonestly so verse
[42:07] 17 let me recap this Bic says balam I
[42:12] want you to curse this people that's
[42:13] come up out of Egypt they're great
[42:15] people I I'm afraid that I won't be able
[42:16] to spite them Smite them so curse them
[42:18] so I can Prevail over them I'm afraid of
[42:20] them balam goes to God and God says
[42:23] don't go with them and guess what I will
[42:25] never curse them
[42:28] Thou shalt not curse this people for
[42:30] they are blessed so you can't curse them
[42:32] because they're blessed how can you
[42:34] curse God is blessed this is God's
[42:38] words and then balum says well I can't
[42:42] go with you
[42:44] sorry and then there's the the
[42:48] promotion numbers 22: 17-2 for I will
[42:51] promote thee unto unto very great
[42:55] honor and and I will do whatsoever thou
[42:58] sayest unto me so balum withholds he he
[43:02] doesn't say I have been told that I
[43:04] cannot curse Israel for their blessed
[43:06] since he doesn't say that and he's held
[43:08] something back in his heart we see we're
[43:10] questioning his character at this point
[43:12] thinking well why did he what's going on
[43:14] here and I believe that Bao is kind of
[43:16] speaking to that a little bit says well
[43:18] I'll promote the into great honor and
[43:20] I'll do whatsoever thou say us enemies
[43:21] kind of probing testing come therefore I
[43:24] pray thee curse me this people and Bam
[43:26] and answered and said un the Servants of
[43:28] baleo it's almost like I don't
[43:32] know uh you know Brier
[43:35] rabbit oh please don't throw me into
[43:37] that Brier patch he could give me a
[43:40] whole house of silver and gold right
[43:43] makes you wonder but it it seems like
[43:45] yeah he gets it if Bao would give me his
[43:47] house full of silver and gold I cannot
[43:48] go beyond the word of the Lord my God to
[43:49] do less or more it sounds really really
[43:51] good but notice now therefore I pray
[43:53] that Terry you also he this night that I
[43:55] may know what the Lord will say unto me
[43:56] more
[43:59] help me out here balum don't
[44:01] go because you can't curse them because
[44:04] I've blessed them I mean what more needs
[44:05] to be said on
[44:07] this right I mean think about this in
[44:09] your life on certain things things
[44:12] that's God God's already spoken about
[44:14] the message is clear on it but we start
[44:16] trying to work things around a little
[44:17] bit well I don't know maybe so I don't
[44:20] know maybe we could do this maybe we
[44:22] should just all go back to Pentecost oh
[44:24] maybe we should just kick this out maybe
[44:26] we should just do this we should just
[44:27] brother Bon's been clear on the word is
[44:29] clear on it let me just go back and see
[44:32] if I can't rearrange his words a little
[44:35] bit right and God comes unto him at
[44:38] night and says verse 20 God came unto
[44:40] bam at night and said unto him if if the
[44:43] men came to call thee rise up if the men
[44:46] come to call thee rise up and go with
[44:48] them but yet the word which I shall say
[44:50] unto thee Thou shalt that thou shalt do
[44:54] and balum Rose up in the morning and
[44:55] saddled his ass and went went with the
[44:57] princes of Moab
[45:00] now anybody catch
[45:03] it look at verse
[45:05] 20 verse 20 if the men come to call
[45:11] you if the men come to call you then go
[45:16] go with them but then speak only what I
[45:18] tell you to
[45:19] speak but balum as soon as he woke up
[45:23] that
[45:24] morning gets on his his da monkey and he
[45:28] goes to the princes of Moab they didn't
[45:30] come to
[45:31] him why didn't he wait why didn't he
[45:35] wait for them to come I wonder how early
[45:40] in the morning he rose up I wonder if he
[45:43] was kind of laying there going is that
[45:45] them is that the Russell is that them
[45:47] and it was it was just his ass every
[45:49] time moving around like when are these
[45:52] PRS going to show up but he jumps up he
[45:55] rationalizes and he go
[45:58] goes very innocently now because the
[46:01] question could be why in the world let
[46:03] me just see if I have it here why in the
[46:05] world would God get angry with balum
[46:07] when he told him to go it's because God
[46:09] didn't tell him to go he told him to go
[46:12] if and balum blows right past the if to
[46:16] the going and still says but I'll only
[46:19] say what the Lord wants me to say and
[46:20] God's mad at him God's angry why he sees
[46:23] the motive in balam's Soul he knows that
[46:26] bam has a weakness he knows there's
[46:29] something there in his heart that can be
[46:30] exploited and so he says you told him
[46:33] you cannot curse Israel but balum still
[46:36] kept coming around acting as if well
[46:38] let's just see let's just see let's just
[46:41] see if God will do
[46:42] it let's just see what will happen and
[46:46] he ran greedily after the princes of
[46:49] Moab hoping for
[46:52] riches hoping for
[46:54] reward I hope it's okay for me to say
[46:57] this I think I can amplify this more in
[46:58] the next service it was the lust of the
[47:00] flesh working on balum that perverted
[47:03] his
[47:04] decisions and you're thinking well okay
[47:07] I mean I get it we're all kind of
[47:09] susceptible here but at the end of the
[47:10] day what he spoke was right but balum
[47:14] succumbed to the
[47:16] temptation to help Bao because the lust
[47:20] of the flesh he was greedy for gain he
[47:23] wanted the
[47:24] money it had to do with appetite it had
[47:27] to do with the flesh so numbers 31: 15-6
[47:31] this is after God has said that Israel
[47:34] Abode in sheet them and the people begin
[47:35] to commit hoard him with the daughters
[47:37] of Moab so God said Moses said to the
[47:40] people have you saved all the women
[47:42] alive these daughters behold these
[47:46] caused the children of
[47:48] Israel through the councel of
[47:52] balum and when you think about like well
[47:54] when I when I'm listening to what but
[47:56] when I heard what he was preaching well
[47:58] I don't I mean it seems like this fit
[48:00] and there's something something was
[48:02] off something was
[48:04] wrong he caused the children of Israel
[48:08] to commit trespass against the Lord in
[48:10] the matter of peor and there was a
[48:12] plague among the congregation of the
[48:14] Lord what caused the children of Israel
[48:17] to commit trespass against the Lord the
[48:19] Council of
[48:21] balum read it the councel of balum yeah
[48:27] the emphasis the repetition the scheme
[48:30] the attack his interpretation it was the
[48:33] Council of balum that caused Israel to
[48:37] fall listen he couldn't open his mouth
[48:39] to curse him every time he prophesied
[48:42] God blessed him he couldn't help but
[48:45] lift up the bride he couldn't help but
[48:46] lift up The Messengers he couldn't help
[48:48] to preach the word but yet there was
[48:49] some living in his
[48:52] soul that in the end was counsel that
[48:55] caused balum that caused Israel to
[48:58] commit trespass against the
[49:01] Lord he helped Bayo hurt
[49:05] Israel he hurt he couldn't curse them
[49:08] but he could hurt
[49:09] him how could he hurt him by tempting
[49:12] them to the lust of the Flesh and the
[49:13] lust of the
[49:14] eyes you cannot curse what God has
[49:17] blessed the bride has a blessing on her
[49:18] you have a blessing on you you're sealed
[49:21] by the Holy Ghost it's a permanent
[49:22] Eternal unconditional Covenant blessing
[49:24] it cannot be rescinded but guess
[49:27] what you can hurt yourself that's true
[49:31] the devil can't curse you and you can't
[49:33] curse yourself but you can hurt yourself
[49:36] listen to how the Jewish historians or
[49:38] the actually the oral tellers and the
[49:40] tarum the rabbis have this say what
[49:43] happened because it's it's in the
[49:44] scripture in a way that maybe you don't
[49:46] see so numbers 24 it looks as if bam
[49:49] goes his way Bic goes the other way but
[49:51] then we find out in numbers 31 God is
[49:54] letting us know that though we only see
[49:57] blessing in those three chapters 22 23
[50:00] and 24 balum
[50:04] counseled gave counsel that caused the
[50:07] congregation the People Israel to
[50:11] stumble and they write and balum Rose up
[50:14] and went to return to his place and bik
[50:16] also went upon his way and this is the
[50:19] silent part between 24 and 25 and
[50:22] appointed the daughters of the
[50:23] midianites for the tavern booths at Beth
[50:25] joshimath
[50:27] by the Snow Mountain where they sold
[50:29] sweet meats cheaper than their
[50:32] price I kind of love sweet meats know
[50:36] you they sold sweet meats cheaper than
[50:40] their price now listen listen to this
[50:44] listen they were selling that is a lost
[50:48] leader right they were selling something
[50:52] desirable and necessary cheaper than
[50:55] what it was and guess what these guys
[50:57] were doing like wait a minute I can get
[50:59] this sweet meat for that much and it it
[51:03] catches
[51:04] them and they did it because the price
[51:07] after the Council of balum the Wicked at
[51:09] the dividing of the way when you look at
[51:11] the scripture when they say the divide
[51:13] the way it's so beautiful another Rabbi
[51:15] wrote it this way come I will counsel
[51:17] thee because he tells ba come here I
[51:19] will counsel thee go and set up ends and
[51:22] place them with the place in them horish
[51:25] women to sell food and drink at a low
[51:28] price and this people will come and eat
[51:31] and drink and be drunken and will lie
[51:34] with them and deny their God and they
[51:37] will be quickly delivered into thine
[51:39] hands and many of them shall fall now I
[51:42] know when we think of the Feast of Bel
[51:44] peor we're thinking like party like just
[51:47] this gigantic Feast where you you get an
[51:51] invitation it's like you got invited to
[51:53] the Feast of elpor I didn't get invited
[51:54] can you give me an invitation is it a
[51:56] plus one but notice even how subtle this
[51:58] Feast may have been just in traditional
[52:01] places taverns and in and places where
[52:04] you might frequent places you might go
[52:06] but there's things that are put out
[52:07] there to tempt you little dainties and
[52:10] things that if you could begin in that
[52:11] path there's a point at which you become
[52:13] overwhelmed and Intoxicated by feeding
[52:15] the lust of the flesh where ultimately
[52:17] it where it results in
[52:20] more you following
[52:22] this balum could not curse Israel
[52:27] so he told Bayo how he could get them to
[52:30] fall and in Revelations chap 2 verse
[52:33] chapter 2:14 it tells us but I have a
[52:35] few things against thee because thou
[52:37] Hast there them that hold the doctrine
[52:40] of
[52:42] balum who taught Bayo to cast a
[52:46] stumbling block before the children of
[52:48] Israel and to eat things sacrifice into
[52:51] idols and to commit
[52:52] fornication this is
[52:54] it bam taught Bayo a three-step process
[52:59] to getting them to be judged by God
[53:02] place a stumbling block they'll eat
[53:05] things sacrifice and idols and they'll
[53:07] commit
[53:08] fornication the stumbling block of
[53:10] eating uh of eating things sacrifice
[53:13] Idol commited fornication results in
[53:14] death for them God had blessed them I
[53:17] keep saying it God had blessed him but
[53:18] there was no way that he could curse
[53:22] them so he knew and he told B you must
[53:25] cause them to stumble through
[53:29] Temptation notice necessarily that the
[53:31] big three isn't Sin Sin iniquity
[53:35] iniquity sin sin or it it it's not the
[53:38] big three is the lust of the eyes the
[53:39] lust of the Flesh and the pride of
[53:41] life it's not even you know uh sin and
[53:44] death those things have been beaten and
[53:48] vanquished death has no more power over
[53:50] you youve been made free from the law of
[53:52] sin and death but yet there still exists
[53:55] this power of the lust of the flesh the
[53:56] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[53:58] you may not be able to condemn their
[53:59] soul through to hell but you can cause
[54:02] them to stumble through
[54:04] Temptation you can keep them from
[54:06] bringing forth fruit unto Perfection you
[54:09] can keep them from a h hundredfold you
[54:11] can cause them to get nervous under
[54:14] persecution you can snatch the word out
[54:16] of their hearts you can cause the
[54:18] deceitfulness of riches to choke out the
[54:21] word so in second Peter chapter 2: 14 15
[54:25] and 16 Peter's using the same language
[54:28] akin to what Jude writes he says having
[54:30] eyes full of adultery that cannot cease
[54:33] from sin oh the lust of the eyes
[54:36] beguiling unstable souls and a heart
[54:39] that has exercised with Covetous
[54:42] practices cursed
[54:45] children the cursed children the bride's
[54:48] not cursed the elect are not cursed the
[54:49] children of God are not cursed you have
[54:51] the children of obedience the children
[54:53] of Disobedience you have cursed
[54:55] children that are not elected to a new
[54:57] birth and then you have those who
[54:59] are not cursed who can be born again the
[55:03] seed of God is in them to be born again
[55:06] so he says which have forsaken the right
[55:08] way and are gone astray following the
[55:12] way of balum the son of basor or as the
[55:14] Bible says beor who loved the wages of
[55:20] unrighteousness the
[55:22] payment the lust of reward but was
[55:26] rebuked for his
[55:27] iniquity all right does that not tell
[55:30] you the dumb ass speaking with man's
[55:33] voice forbade The Madness of the
[55:37] Prophet now I'm like hold on hold on
[55:39] hold on let me go back and read this let
[55:40] me read this numbers The Madness of the
[55:42] Prophet where's The Madness of the
[55:44] prophet he went yeah when he wasn't
[55:47] supposed to go he said but God said to
[55:49] go he said yeah if they
[55:51] call so then why why did that become
[55:54] such an issue his own Madness
[55:57] he ran greedily after the he of balum
[56:01] for
[56:02] reward he taught Bayo to cast a
[56:06] stumbling block why because Bao made a
[56:11] deal this is a hypothetical
[56:16] speculation balum realizes okay I can't
[56:19] curse them because they're blessed maybe
[56:21] he comes clean with Bay you've asked me
[56:23] to do something that I can't do
[56:26] I can't curse them because they're
[56:28] blessed so you can give me all the money
[56:31] you want in the world but I can't
[56:32] prophesy I can't say anything against
[56:34] what's already what God speaks and so
[56:38] B's like and Bam's kind of like you dig
[56:43] like I can't I can't curse
[56:47] them and B look's
[56:49] like so what can you do
[56:53] like like it starts doing charades right
[56:59] and he said he say he says well I do
[57:02] know that God has
[57:03] said that they're not to lie with your
[57:06] women and so and and they have this
[57:10] appetite they have this desire and you
[57:11] can work through economy you can you
[57:13] work through consumerism you can put it
[57:15] in grocery stores and online markets and
[57:17] you can do this and you can offer
[57:19] discounts and you can provide this and
[57:20] you can provide that and you can work in
[57:22] this Channel and what will happen is
[57:23] they begin to consume this it'll pervert
[57:25] their sermon or their judgment or put
[57:27] them in proximity to other things that
[57:29] they're not to partake in and these
[57:31] women will ultimately be able to seduce
[57:32] the men and it'll cause God's judgment
[57:34] to come on
[57:37] them that's the way of
[57:40] balum The Madness of the Prophet God
[57:43] knew it the moment he left or God knew
[57:45] it before but he showed it the moment he
[57:47] didn't tell Balo that he couldn't curse
[57:49] him in the moment he left for the
[57:51] princes of Moab when God told him not to
[57:53] go unless they came to him then let me
[57:56] say this as I close balum represents to
[57:58] us the lust of the flesh lurking
[58:01] underneath the surface through whether
[58:03] it be need or even
[58:06] desire the controlling factor or
[58:09] preeminence where it's what the flesh
[58:12] wants it's something
[58:17] there
[58:19] balum was controlled by the lust of the
[58:23] flesh he says a lot of good things does
[58:25] a lot of good things things prophesies a
[58:27] lot of good things preaches a lot of
[58:28] good sermons even in the face of Bayo
[58:30] the critic and the one who's trying to
[58:31] get him to do otherwise but ultimately
[58:32] he succumbed because of the pressure not
[58:36] just the pressure he had in his heart
[58:37] but the pressure that Bic also has put
[58:39] it on him and as those of you who
[58:41] studied this know brother Bram made
[58:42] these statements in the sermon why are
[58:44] so people tossed about money was the
[58:47] prophet balum in money women and pro
[58:49] popularity says baalm represents money
[58:51] who sold out his gifts to go on account
[58:53] of money when Bayo offered so much money
[58:59] yes I hope you understand further and
[59:01] better the story of
[59:04] balum that the scripture oh scripture
[59:07] does not even speak to us what happened
[59:10] between chapters 24 and chapters
[59:13] 25 but tells us later in Micah and Peter
[59:16] in Revelation and even as we read in
[59:18] Jude that there was this Heir in balam's
[59:21] heart this Doctrine where he taught BAC
[59:24] how to lay a stumbling block running at
[59:26] greedily after the heir of balum the the
[59:29] way of balum Who Loved wages of
[59:34] unrighteousness this
[59:36] Council
[59:38] money is represented by balum money the
[59:42] lust of the
[59:44] flesh the love of money is the root of
[59:46] all
[59:47] evil this is the spirit of balum
[59:50] Brothers you can come to your
[59:51] instruments this is the spirit of balum
[59:54] I'll say this and leave it here when we
[59:56] say that money is something that hinders
[59:59] a minister we might think oh if he has a
[1:00:01] lot of it but it could also be if he
[1:00:04] doesn't have
[1:00:05] any and therefore poverty and the lack
[1:00:08] of money becomes problematic brother
[1:00:09] brandham is even honest about the fact
[1:00:11] he never wanted money to be a problem
[1:00:13] and that's why he never took up
[1:00:15] offerings but then what happened he got
[1:00:18] into debt so much to he quit Ministry
[1:00:22] because he did a Revival in California
[1:00:23] ended up oing tens of thousands of
[1:00:24] dollars or thousands of thousand of
[1:00:26] dollars couldn't pay it back came back
[1:00:28] said he was going to go get his old job
[1:00:30] and come off the field because he didn't
[1:00:31] want money to be a problem
[1:00:34] well the lack of it was even causing the
[1:00:37] prophet to do something that even in his
[1:00:39] heart he didn't necessarily believe was
[1:00:40] right God had to give him a vision that
[1:00:44] night so this the the money isn't always
[1:00:47] maybe what we think it is and we kind of
[1:00:49] look at our bank account and be
[1:00:51] like I don't have a problem with
[1:00:53] money I got money problems
[1:00:58] and so there's more to it I'll say this
[1:01:03] to have a problem with money especially
[1:01:05] any one of us it's not just to this is a
[1:01:07] spirit of abalum it's to be controlled
[1:01:09] by
[1:01:11] money you may not have it but you're
[1:01:14] trying to get
[1:01:17] it in each one of these instances it
[1:01:19] says that he gave
[1:01:21] counsel and it's through that counsel
[1:01:23] that he caused the people to eat
[1:01:27] and I began to see this symmetry in the
[1:01:29] word of God wherein if a man does not
[1:01:32] work he's not able to
[1:01:35] eat and there is a a a a a a connection
[1:01:39] between labor and eating the fruits of
[1:01:41] your labor and that the wage and the
[1:01:44] fruit of Labor we we are to enjoy but
[1:01:48] there's a point at which the pursuit of
[1:01:50] the Mammon the pursuit of the fruit The
[1:01:52] Pursuit Of The Riches of the money or
[1:01:55] that which we want to joy as a result of
[1:01:56] our labor causes us to go further than
[1:01:59] just the need but then to bow down to
[1:02:02] other gods and to commit fornication
[1:02:04] through
[1:02:06] intoxication it's to be controlled by
[1:02:09] money a minister can be controlled by
[1:02:12] money in that he's afraid to speak
[1:02:13] things because he doesn't want to cause
[1:02:15] a tithe payer to hold back their tithes
[1:02:18] or to lose somebody who who who gives or
[1:02:21] miss out on an opportunity to do
[1:02:22] something many times uh men of God can
[1:02:24] be controlled because they say we have a
[1:02:26] need for a fellowship hall to meet these
[1:02:28] needs and a guy comes and he's got a
[1:02:30] check and he says how much is it going
[1:02:32] to cost and he says well we need
[1:02:35] $150,000 he says I'll I'll write you a
[1:02:38] check this big too right I'm going to
[1:02:39] write you a check and you could build it
[1:02:42] but or I I want you to do it and then
[1:02:45] suddenly through different ways says
[1:02:47] yeah you know I just got this this
[1:02:49] situation with my wife and you know I
[1:02:51] want to put her away and God gave me a
[1:02:53] dream years ago that I was supposed to
[1:02:55] marry this other girl and she turns 18
[1:02:57] next month and you know kind of like bam
[1:03:00] and Bot kind of
[1:03:02] like you picking up what I'm laying down
[1:03:04] here and it seems absurd but these
[1:03:07] things happen and maybe I use it on an
[1:03:08] absurd scale and I should kind of bring
[1:03:10] it down to a little bit more subtle
[1:03:11] levels that's how sometimes money
[1:03:13] becomes a pastor's problem or a
[1:03:15] preacher's problem it's because how
[1:03:16] others try to use it on him true but the
[1:03:19] spirit of balum is not just to be
[1:03:21] controlled by
[1:03:22] money but it's representing the spirit
[1:03:24] of bao to use money to
[1:03:28] control there's some likeminded with Bao
[1:03:31] and balum there's a reason why they kept
[1:03:32] traveling together you know to different
[1:03:35] Vantage points you know going up this a
[1:03:37] great hike to the top of this mountain
[1:03:38] it's beautiful see these people over
[1:03:39] there can you curse them now I don't
[1:03:42] know let me see bck let me see let's
[1:03:44] just Camp another night here let's hang
[1:03:45] out a little bit and let's see I
[1:03:48] couldn't curse him well let's go on
[1:03:49] another hike let's go down to the valley
[1:03:50] let's go over here let's do this it was
[1:03:52] his traveling buddy never tired of his
[1:03:54] presence they were like
[1:03:57] Spirits so money can become a problem
[1:04:00] money problems doesn't necessarily
[1:04:02] always mean that you have it in your
[1:04:03] Rich it's how you use it
[1:04:05] yes sometimes people will not tithe as a
[1:04:10] way of
[1:04:12] protest and you might be thinking oh man
[1:04:14] I got the pastor you know the pastor has
[1:04:16] no
[1:04:16] idea he's over there praying for you oh
[1:04:19] God bless them they're they they don't
[1:04:21] they they must be going through tough
[1:04:22] times Lord and financially they must be
[1:04:24] going through and they pray and and
[1:04:25] they're burden for you no judgment
[1:04:27] whatsoever and you're thinking yeah I
[1:04:28] really stuck it to them and God's over
[1:04:31] there
[1:04:32] going I've given him tenfold what you're
[1:04:36] withholding you're robbing me pal you're
[1:04:39] robbing me why because it's the spirit
[1:04:41] of balum with money in ways that they
[1:04:44] think they control money becomes a
[1:04:47] problem with ministers not because they
[1:04:49] have too much of it but they'll use it
[1:04:50] to bribe and to control to put you on
[1:04:54] salary or under their thumb or to use
[1:04:57] use money there's ministers and there's
[1:04:59] pastors especially because the a lot of
[1:05:01] in some Churches everything you give is
[1:05:03] tithing and the pastor decides when the
[1:05:05] rent's going to be paid or the mortgage
[1:05:06] and he distributes everything and so all
[1:05:08] the money in a church is the pastors and
[1:05:10] so he's the only one that can buy you a
[1:05:12] set of tires right he's the only one
[1:05:15] that can put gas in your tank he's the
[1:05:17] only one that can help you when you're
[1:05:18] in need and so what does he do he uses
[1:05:20] it to buy influence and to Curry favor
[1:05:24] and there's some people that we know and
[1:05:25] we they seem to be so unselfish say I've
[1:05:29] never met a man that is so unselfish
[1:05:32] with his money but God sees right
[1:05:34] through the Optics of balam's heart and
[1:05:36] right into his soul and knows he's only
[1:05:38] doing it for
[1:05:43] influence so the lust of the flesh it's
[1:05:46] connected with this money it's more than
[1:05:49] just eating but it's to be controlled by
[1:05:51] it and to use it to control
[1:05:59] why are people so tossed about brother
[1:06:00] says money was the prophet balum who
[1:06:02] sold out his gifts to go on account of
[1:06:03] money when Bao offered so much money
[1:06:07] many of you are acquainted with the
[1:06:09] story we are I I could read it now
[1:06:11] because anyone here we're all acquainted
[1:06:12] with it just think about it for a moment
[1:06:16] this example of
[1:06:18] balum who thought that he
[1:06:20] stood thought he was doing
[1:06:23] good and it seems as if he never quite
[1:06:26] recognized where he was going
[1:06:30] wrong and to get away from
[1:06:33] it no it's one thing to say oh my
[1:06:36] goodness brother Aaron I I I I think
[1:06:38] I've got this in my heart I I I I feel
[1:06:42] like I I I've got a problem that
[1:06:44] whenever I go to this place I I get
[1:06:47] drawn and I get tempted and I've been
[1:06:48] saying no and so I think I've got this
[1:06:50] weakness and I've got this problem and
[1:06:52] and I just want God to get rid of this
[1:06:54] problem and so you show back up at that
[1:06:56] place you say well I guess it's still
[1:06:58] there it's like hey don't go
[1:07:01] anymore right don't
[1:07:03] go that that's part of Satan's got a
[1:07:06] Punch Coming got to keep a spot covered
[1:07:09] up it's not so much asking for
[1:07:12] deliverance as much as it is asking for
[1:07:13] the wisdom of the
[1:07:18] word oh God help us
[1:07:28] he says to Samson it was Delilah the
[1:07:32] woman who woed him in his her lap until
[1:07:34] he gave away the secrets of the L Lord
[1:07:37] to her money women that's the lust of
[1:07:41] the eyes and Saul it was
[1:07:45] popularity pride of life those are my
[1:07:47] words the pride of life is my words the
[1:07:49] Bible said he was numbered with the
[1:07:51] prophets and through popularity he
[1:07:53] wanted to be big and above someone else
[1:07:55] and he fell by
[1:07:56] this and this is the three major causes
[1:07:59] that I see in the Bible that caused men
[1:08:02] to fall and brother B says and I asked
[1:08:05] our heavenly father to please let me
[1:08:06] shun at all times those
[1:08:09] things especially these three major
[1:08:11] things and had kept a covering over
[1:08:17] them January 1st 1956 why are people so
[1:08:21] tossed about go
[1:08:24] read how he begins to confess how
[1:08:27] money not in a lustful way not in a
[1:08:29] perverted way but how money this thing
[1:08:31] he's tried to kept cover he's
[1:08:32] transparent about
[1:08:34] it he's not Hy he's not saying well the
[1:08:36] Lord told me to come off the field and
[1:08:38] go get my job you know go get another
[1:08:39] job he's being transparent I've tried to
[1:08:41] keep this covered up I've tried to stay
[1:08:43] away from it I've turned down millions
[1:08:44] of dollars I haven't taken up offerings
[1:08:46] but I find myself in this pickle I owe a
[1:08:48] lot of money I I can't keep doing these
[1:08:50] meetings if I'm going to have to start
[1:08:51] pulling for money and he's still trying
[1:08:53] to keep it covered up he's not wanting
[1:08:55] to give
[1:08:56] in and I believe it applies to all of us
[1:09:00] I want you to begin to think about these
[1:09:01] things in ways that are much deeper than
[1:09:03] just the usual suspects or the real
[1:09:05] clothline punch that can give but to
[1:09:08] recognize you can't be cursed daughter
[1:09:09] of God you can't be cursed Son of God
[1:09:14] but you can be caused to stumble and
[1:09:16] it's the wicked one that wants to do
[1:09:18] that hey I don't want to be his
[1:09:21] stumbling block do you so God help us
[1:09:26] amen for my sake and
[1:09:28] others to keep the big three at Bay to
[1:09:31] be Discerning to use wisdom could we
[1:09:34] stand together
