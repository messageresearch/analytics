TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I would like to entitle this uh Small Talk deity and truly uh to come to this Psalm here verse 7as he says it will not he will not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is steadfast trusting in the Lord now you need to be uh mature to to see that this part of the Bible become a reality in our heart it doesn't matter the news that you might hear you're not going to feel that not because you are somebody not because I am somebody but because of the god that we have amen the almighty uh you're not you're not going to preoccupy yourself with that what is it uh is it healing econom economy money stress because what affects one of the things that affects most this world is stress and as Christians sometimes we permit the devil to just drag us like the world is being dragged and the stress will sometimes lead us to uh unbelief because if you are trusting in God how are you going to uh solve a problem a lot of times we say that that we trust in God and we want God to give us the answer to our problems but our [Music] way and if it's not in our way then we feel that God's not working and at times we uh make the problem bigger now see deity we know that deity is God in human flesh lately I've been meditating on this word deity and even so we believe that God sent us a very powerful Prophet now he was revealed through [Music] him because no human being can do what he's done through him amen we all believe in that deity Amen in the prophet right that God brought down and revealed and he had discern the hearts of the people through the prophet now it had to be the almighty God because he had promised that just like he discerned the heart of Sarah likewise it had to be in this last days and it happened and there's a lot of tapes that you can hear from Brother brandham Where he discerned the the heart of the people and it's uh it's very beautiful to believe in deity because God promised itos because he promised that I would not leave you orphan or alone solos alone he said I will send the comforter the Holy Spirit that's deity it's beautiful to believe and it's very easy to believe in deity in the prophets of the Bible it is easy to believe that there was deity in brother Bram because of what God did through him it's very easy sometimes to believe that deity is in the pastor and even so God uh told Brother Branham if you do if you can get the people and that's where the little problem exists now if you can get the people to believe nothing nothing can be impossible canc not even cancer but there was a condition that the people had to believe that it was God through him a lot of people did not believe and therefore did not receive their healing now myself about 20 years ago while I was cutting here on 75th and B Road uh it happened or God sent me a client back then uh that person that client was between 60 and 70 and as I was speaking to him or or talking to him don't know how I mentioned the the last name of brandom I believe I believe I was uh talking about the Bible to him and of course he was not a believer of the message then he said you know what I was in one of his campaigns when he was here in Phoenix me and my brother and we went to one of his campaigns uh to see if it was true what he was saying and as we were standing as the line was forming to uh uh for the healing service to pray for the sick we thought that it wasn't believable or that that was untrue now he was a very good preacher and a good evangelist but he never mentioned that he was a prophet now uh to him he was just a good preacher and a good evangelist and as me and my brother were uh observing then my brother all of a sudden remember something that I had uh stomped on my uh big toe and it was swollen and purple and he said oh I remember that happened cuz I didn't remember and he said and he said why don't you go forward and see if it's true so I got in line and all of a sudden as I came back from the line my brother was waiting for me and the service was over and when the service was over we exited out and then my brother uh I told him why don't you take your shoe off and I took my shoe off and my and my toe was as normal as the other toe he said God used that man how not to believe brothers that it was God using Brother brandham deity but if you can get the people to believe now God gave us promises not go throughout the world and preach the gospel and you can put your hands on the sick but all of that is there there's a um a compromise or or something that you must do now you and me uh I don't believe that it was just for brother brandham now I can see it now that way this is what I believe that it wasn't just for brother BR it is for each and every True Believer we must must do that we must want that the people will believe us that they will see us as children of God because even God if they didn't believe Jesus he didn't do no Miracle the people have to believe us but the problem begins with deity with ourselves a lot of times not even ourselves we believe ourselves we we claim to be Sons and Daughters of God but us ourselves don't even believe in the commission that was given to us but you know one thing I've been studying a little bit on the seven compound names of God Jehovah Gyra God will provide just with that one alone if we just believe that alone we would almost get to uh uh fig uh just have everything uh at hand there to believe amena Jehovah Rafa uh Jehovah your healer amen Jehovah uh your banner but what's what's a flag on your banner what is it good for so you can identify amen but a lot of times not even ourselves uh no what is it that identify us you know a ship cannot navigate if it doesn't have a flag where it comes from it should be the same with the Christian I've always believed that a true Christian now me myself I have believed I I'm not saying that it has to be that way but I have believe with all my heart that you and me that people should identify us and it should be something there that would make that would look different different in work wherever we might be that if there was a a if there were to put a line and they would put us right there in the middle of that line it should be something that it would stand out from the people that are there on that line amen Jehovah our Banner but a lot of times instead of picking up the banner or the flag we hide it Jehovah Shalom Jehovah Shalom Jehovah is our our peace our peace in the Christian home uh it should be in abundant Jehovah Shalom our peace and not just in our homes people should see us like someone that can help them and not like just another problem in their lives Shalom Jehovah shalom if you are a son of God you should have peace for the people that surround you not more problems no more or more stress yes Jehovah Jehovah is my pastor and we will not lack anything that right there if if we just believe it it doesn't need an explication of that you knowu Jehovah shiku uh Jehovah's Justice and Jehovah shama Jehovah is present every Christian we should have in our present life manifestation of all these names Jehovah but brother brandham I'm sorry I was reading uh the statue of a perfect man and as I was studying uh the stature of a perfect man the fruits of the spirit did you know that every one of these compound names they go hand in hand with every fruit of the spirit the first name of Jehovah that appeared in the Bible it was Jehovah Gyra Jehovah will provide and the first fruit is Faith uh God cannot provide unless me and you have faith but you know I found something out in my life that God uh send to us that's why I've been enjoying this uh messages from brother Aaron uh the kingdom he says search ye first the kingdom of God and the rest will come uh and be added onto you but the problem that I found out in my life that I was looking at first to be added on to me it was the kingdom of God uh for a long time as a Christian I was looking for those added on things that were promised the blessings to prosper economically so many things that I forgot to search for the kingdom of God to look for the holy spirit in my life none of these names will have an effect or will be manifested in my life see it's like that man that brought that his son uh that was full of demons unto the Lord he said I took him to your disciples and the demons wouldn't leave them and then the disciples asked how come we couldn't get that de those demons out because these demons only come out with with uh fasting and prayer now a lot of times Brothers I have found myself that I want to be found or named a Son of God but but I don't want any of what comes with it being a Son of God or that and that is to pray uh to fast read my Bible daily listen to the message you see we know that faith is a foundation of the growth or Revelation what brother Aon was speaking about faith faith we must have faith amen but to have faith we must be born again we need to find the kingdom of God if we don't then those demons or devils are going to laugh about us and not just the Devils even the people right sometimes we don't uh take on the challenges that the devil might present to us because we don't feel prepared it's because we know that we are not fulfilling our uh duties as a Christian brother brother Bram uh spoke and said you you have two things to do daily is to pray and to uh reach your Bible amen and we also should fast that way because when he said and these signs shall follow those who believe now right there he didn't place the ministry there he put the believer there amen I you know now there he didn't say uh go and talk to your pastor and the deacons to come and pray for this sick person he said the believer but many times we do what Adam did now he went and hid himself when he found out that he wasn't right with God because when he was uh right with God then he would come out and meet him that's why it's very important to examine ourselves daily see those uh footprints that we're leaving behind what is that image that we're leaving behind a lot of times we just uh forget to look back and see how crooked or what way we're or going forward and a lot of times if we just took the time to just look occasionally back and see our Footprints and if we're walking straight or maybe we're just zigzagging one side to another that would help us to line ourselves up with just by our own Footprints but a lot of times we don't want to be judged remember one thing if we are part of the Bride we are being judged as it is right now and if you and I are being judged we should be happy but we should be given a good example and you know as as I would listen to that oh yes I would say you know what the people of of the the world should should look at me uh like this in in in this manner and and that's good but it would always go above me in in my home how is my wife uh seeing me how is my son looking at me how are my co-workers looking at me are they seeing part of God you know and and I remember when I was like around 20 like a worker and now uh as a Christian now I feel ashamed because every day I would just complain of everything it was more of a problem than a solution for me at work I didn't I didn't think that people were looking at us as a Son of God there and not just at work now my wife is here and she's a witness at church everything would bother me and and I would complain even as I exited the the the service I was already complaining because the preacher took too long maybe because the the the brother that came and directed The the song leader just made one more song too long the place where they set me for me it was a problem with the deacons don't you know who I am why are you sitting me there you should uh have a place for me uh reserved over there on that side yes brother when me and you have not been born again we are a problem walking we we may uh you know make believe that we're good Christians and you know before uh being born again A lot of times we look for knowledge before the Holy Spirit and then we become experts on the Bible we uh turn to being experts on the message so we can just complain of what other people are doing but not to judge our own life that's why for me for it's very important and it is important to understand the three stages of Grace F understand if I've been born again because that's fundamental to understand deity in me in me in myself uh deity will not come to be if we you and I are not born again right good uh we could believe in deity in another person but the hardest thing is to believe deity in yourself and myself what did God ordain us to do or send us to do is to do it myself look I I believe it with my heart when you are sure yourself that you have been born again you're not preoccupied or you don't worry about the pastor a lot or maybe your pastor because of of what teaching he's going to give why because if the holy spirit is with you and if he makes a mistake an error you are confiding in the spirit that's in you Brothers cor no so you can discern what you're uh digesting is good or wrong or or any preacher or if the pastor sends you to do something I'm not afraid for the pastor to send me to do something first of all because I believe in my heart that he is a man of God right and he's not going to send me to do something that's incorrect and even if he was to make an error a mistake the spirit that's inside of me is going to help me but we have to confide in what we believe and what what we trust we can have a lot of knowledge but if we don't have Revelation Nicodemus said to to the Lord we know we know who you are uh he knew but he never accepted it himself he had knowledge but he had no Revelation so a lot of times I was just out there finding myself looking for knowledge but no Revelation and many times knowledge like I said a while back will take us to be a problem because at times like we have so much knowledge then it's very difficult uh to understand and align ourselves according to the word of God we have to search understand I had a real hard time why brother Brandon would say at times search or look for the Holy Spirit was desperation desperate because me and you cannot do nothing as Christians without the Holy Spirit to begin with we cannot even uh make the first step the fundamental or the foundation is Faith what good is it to believe that God can make Miracles if we don't have faith if you don't have faith then you don't have virtue perhaps we can be in a place or arrive to a place now me and myself uh personally I never knew brother brand to see that God was using that person but God did permit me to be right next to my mother person th this is the one person that I have seen that God had moved tremendously in a person I even seeing uh dead Rise Up from the dead now I can't say and deny that God does not exist because perhaps I didn't see brother but God permitted through my mother see that God that's Almighty and like my father oh like a f like like a father I have to uh go forward or give it to my son it is one of my uh I I preoccupy myself with that's just a worry of me in life now that my son can see to see the God that he listens to in this church in my life because if it ain't that is just a a word of mouth in it's my responsibility that my son with my life with my works see that God that's acting because if we go to the Book of Judges it says that the generations begin to wither or fall apart from God because they stopped seeing his works his his mighty works it is our responsibility that our generation that's coming behind us does not get away from God because without works it is just another denomination like any other one what good is it for my son that I believe in a revelation that God sent down that we have the highest Revelation but if we are afraid to uh pray for the sick what what good is it to my son to know that God had has revealed all the Seven Seals but in daily life he cannot see that powerful God Amen however to show that I have to search the kingdom of God we have to search the kingdom of God and be if we can say it this way like a buffet that's walking what do you need Jehovah will provide pass peace do you need for me to help you to identify yourself Jehovah what do you need in what stage are you in uh what steps are you in your stage you maybe I'm at the stage of Faith but I know that my brother here is in virtue let's just bring him out here so he could pray what is virtue power and virtue came out of him that's what the Bible said brother Bram said it is power it is science or or knowledge temp it is templin hold on to now that if you can be tempered that's very difficult it says that in the hard times or the tough times that's where the leaders you know who your leaders are in the tough times because they're they Temperance not just uh are are taking abide by what they see even to know ourselves I am uh learning myself uh to be Temperance the problem is not that things bother you the problem is how you react to that if me and you have not learned to have Temperance uh to control ourselves you need the holy spirit amen do you have temperance in my youth I didn't have it everything bother me and even now there's things that bother me but the difference is my reaction to that to those things that bother me now if it's me that it's the problem or that I'm exaggerating or is it the other person that's doing that I can help him do things a little better patience Shalom Jehovah Shalom that's what patience is peace that's another thing that cost me quite a bit and that Brothers if me and you are not connected with God daily we are not going to have Temperance and we're not going to have patience and brother Bram says patience now it's not the patience of what the world gives you even though it is but on the fruits of the spirit the patience that he's talking about is the patience that you're calm because God's going to do what he has to do amen he has the and it's difficult because God never works within our time our way and that really took a toll on me it cost me a lot to understand and to accept it uh fear of God the last one uh brotherly loveah Jehovah sh Jehovah is here how many times someone needs someone else yah sh Jehovah sh to feel God remember something God is a spirit and he needs a human body so he can perform that's what brother brandham taught us so he can show his love what good is it for people people to say that we believe a god of love but they never see that love amen that we believe in a God who saves and we're the first ones to uh kick them and all this I'm I'm speaking about the ones that are near us they're the ones that see us 24/7 sometimes it's easy to uh conquer someone who sees us only two or three or four hours but the ones that we live with do they see us in the same manner what do we need but the but faith is like a muscle if we don't fortify it we don't exercise it it'll never be strong look the uh if a person that's never made made any uh physical uh things or exercise cannot go and just lift up a weight of 100 pounds he has to start with a 10 pound or a 20 PB it's the same thing with faith if you've never practiced it is you're not going to come up and raise someone from the dead because maybe you haven't even prayed for a headache that's faith we have to practice Faith Amen to fortify it if me and you do not practice we can never be strong in faith deity deity is God in us to believe all of his promises not not just believe them to understand that God gave those promises to the people but the people needed so those promises can come through you and me all those words and must be uh be manifested in someone I want to ask that you uh stand on your feet what
