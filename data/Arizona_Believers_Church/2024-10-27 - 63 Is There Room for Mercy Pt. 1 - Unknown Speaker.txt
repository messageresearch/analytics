TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies that the king said unto Nathan the prophet see now I dwell in a house of Cedar but the Ark of God dwelleth within curtains and Nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the Lord is with thee and I you can recognize what he's speaking of is transitioning from the ark that's been placed in the Tabernacle which was present in the wilderness which was moving around now he wants to build a fixed permanent Temple or house for the ark and it came to pass that night that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan saying go and tell my servant David thus sayith the Lord shalt thou build me and house for me to dwell in whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a Tabernacle in all the places wherein I've walked with all the children of Israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of Israel whom I commanded to Feed My People saying why build ye not me in House of Cedar now therefore so sh so shalt thou say unto my servant David thus sayith the Lord of host I took thee from the Sheep coat from following the Sheep to be ruler over my people over Israel and I was with thee whether soever thou winest and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like under the name of the great men that are in the earth moreover I will appoint a place for my My People Israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them anymore as before time and as since the time that I commanded judges to be over My People Israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also the Lord tth thee that he will make thee a house and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy she seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bows and I will establish his kingdom he shall build a house for my name and I will will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever I will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity I will chasen him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men but my Mercy shall not depart from him as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee thy Throne shall be established forever according to all these words and according to all this Vision so did Nathan speak unto David amen you can be seated I know there's Clear Connection in these the scripture reading I think we've even read some of this this year already to the house of the Lord and David meditating at the end of his days and as he is looking at the peace that reigned there in Israel he thought well God who dwells between those cherubims and there at the ark he has he lives behind a tent he lives behind a veil and I live in a nice house so I want to build him a house and the Lord's response to him is uh quite remarkable he's saying I've never once asked for you to build me a house but yet you say I want to build a house and it must have been something that please the Lord because he says you won't build the house but your son will build the house and he says that he will build this house and I will establish your house and your seed and I'll be a father to him and he says in my Mercy shall not depart from from him and it's kind of central uh to this theme in the house of the Lord you'll find and so I want to uh change titles in our subject now to is there room for mercy and ask this question is there room for mercy and we're still looking at these aspects of the house of the Lord and I want to blend the last subject where we were looking at the role of the house and how that the a household or a house whether you're an individual a family or a church is that you would develop character character that there'd be growth and maturity of the members of that household either uh maturity is demonstrated by those that are doing the leading and those that are doing the following are growing into the image of a of a an adult a mature individual and we took the approach of youngans uh whether you go from infancy to adolescence of growing into mature Sons and Daughters of God so that your's not you're not always just staying in one place you're not just being stagnant but there's this trajectory of growing into the image of Christ and I'd like to transition into a new focus on mercy and in particular been just studying again on the mercy seat and uh there's a lot in that and I realize we've ministered on these subjects quite a bit already over the last few years but yet it's a you you cannot exhaust the subject of mercy and I was blessed even this morning in singing this song about the goodness of God because that goodness is Mercy and and so this is there room for mercy you could have said is there room for goodness it goes back to kindness that we were ministering on and some of those things that we've touched on in the house of the Lord but just to uh blend this together we were looking at the statements wherein brother brandham is uh preaching the invisible Union of the bride of Christ in shreport we looked at that series quite a bit and how he's talking about the the modern church and he says they don't want any of these here screaming uh shouting tongue speaking acts 238 youngans around her and he's talking about the natural process of a birth and the way that a baby would act an infant even at the time that it's born there are certain signs of life and crying and shouting and breath is coming in and so he talks about screaming and hollering and blabbering he talks about an oldfashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost filled child born of the spirit screaming hollering shouting praising God and these are characteristics he's saying of a genuine child that's born there going to be some signs of life there's going to be some activity there's going to be something and even talks about at the in the birth of that church where there were signs and miracles and and wonders and crying and shouting and lifting up a loud voice and a cry to the Lord and it's the two acts 238 youngans been born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I believe these statements stand as truth it just uh some of us have in our birth in our experience it was a mess and there's different ways that it manifest itself uh uh through different uh uh in many different ways but this stands for a definite truth but the truth can be misused Paul even uses a phrase handling the truth in unrighteousness and I want to use an example in the scripture and this to me is just perfect overlap of how you could take a truth and just try to apply it in a like a legalistic way and say well we got the results or this is what it says it's supposed to do so this is what it is but you completely miss the whole point and in there the word isn't effective it can't produce what it's supposed to produce in Proverbs 13: 24 it says he that spareth his Rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him be times so this be times there it means early and we might say early and often but the meaning here is that uh one who loves his son is going to correct him and chasen him early on uh because he loves him and he wants him to turn out right he wants to train him up in the way that he should go and so with it stands for the proposition I think it's very clear in the language it's using if you love your child you chasen him early on so where they get the saying spare the rod spoil the child you won't find that necessarily verbatim in scripture but this is what it's drawing from and I'll say it right now because this the point I'm trying to make at this at this particular juncture is some read this scripture he that spares his Rod who he who does not spank his child or punish his child hates him but if you love him you'll spank him and and we read that scripture and you really can't I mean even if you just try to break down the Hebrew you can't get away from the fact that it's saying that there ought to be some sort of chastening some sort of Affliction uh I if you love your child early on to train them up in the way that he should go but this scripture is taken and used to justify outright abuse in Proverbs chap 23 verses 13 and 14 withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die and some think that the goal then is to beat him with the rod until with an inch of their life and that's going to save them from dying and what is it it's a blatant misuse and a perversion of the Scripture it says Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shal deliver his soul from death and so many thinking that they're being faithful to the scripture will clinch their teeth and take a rod and beat the devil out of you boy right and they're going to spank them and they're going to inflict pain and they're going to inflict this great harsh punishment and all the while say well it's in the word this is what the word says says in Proverbs 22:15 foolishness is Bound in the heart of a child but the rod of Correction shall drive it far from him and there's a there's a lot in the language that's used and how they took it from what it was originally written in and then we reading from the King James version and maybe even a little more archaic language than we might use it to use today but it's saying that if you don't spank your child you hate him but if you love him you'll spank them and if you withhold correction uh uh you know don't withhold correction but beat him with a rod or just apply uh contact you know spank them we could say is maybe more modern parlament Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from Death because foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child but the rod of Correction spanking corporal punishment will drive it from him and I believe that these scriptures can be used and are used to support what we call corporal punishment or to justify physically correcting a child you say well what does that mean is it a switch is it a spank is it am I using a literal or a belt what what is I use and I think that without taking much thought if we just tried to apply it literally truth can be wrongly applied and uh and I'll say it this way and I think we've addressed it in the past where if the heart's not right of the one that's doing the correcting and they just grab a hold of this as you know the rod will drive it from them and they use this without being connected with the thought behind the scripture the intent of even what they might call punishment or I like to say correction that if they're missing that what it what that very act to follow the scripture becomes is not the scriptural Act of correcting the child physically but just abuse and it doesn't mean if it leaves a Mark it's an it's abusive or uh you say well I didn't leave a mark it's what's the intent it's the understanding it's the approach that can change something that the scripture is advocating for and turning it into something that the scripture is not advocating for even though looks like you're doing exactly what the scripture said I do recall when we were ministering on this uh some time ago it was on a Wednesday night H we looked at through scriptures and it's very hard to deny that the Bible is uh teaching these things we clearly see the Bible is teaching it but then we look at the product that those who follow some of these scriptures have produced in their children and the the the thousands of people that say in the studies they've done that said well the kids that were corporately punished turn out with great more mental health issues they become more abusive and the results are very hard to deny and the and what we could say is the word's not wrong but the application was and so you can't judge the word by the results because it wasn't applied in the way that the word calls for it to be applied and so the Bible is by these verses admonishing us to diligently seek useful effective discipline for our children now if it seems like I'm just a out somewhere else real quick I'm really not we're we're still just right real close to our subjects here and it's that correcting that CH trains and disciplines so it's got to be done in love it's got to be forward-looking it's not you're not just trying to and I don't want to get pulled into this but you're not just being uh reactive where you know child spills milk and you told them not to get the milk and so you just you just slap them and you smack them up real good and you tell them to clean clean up the mess and so what you're doing is you're looking backwards to punish them for prior conduct but you want to address it in a way that you uh you take care of or you moderate future conduct in the right way you want to do it to where they're always afraid to drink milk so they never drink milk like why are you breaking your bones why is this happening why because they're afraid to drink milk because you didn't address it so Behavior going forward wasn't really properly corrected and it creates complexes and fears and negative Dynamics so there's an approach to addressing Disobedience that's forward-looking it's love it's training it's cultivating and there's a wisdom that's joined with it Proverbs 29:15 the rod and repr give wisdom so if it's only giving pain it's not the rod and the reproof that the Bible wants the rod and reproof give wisdom but a Child Left to himself bringeth his mother to shame and all the mothers don't say anything the rod and reproof give wisdom but a Child Left to himself bringeth his mother to shame in a lot more ways than we might think because a mother who doesn't train her child it shames her right and that child will act in a way that'll bring the mother reproach there's a lot that's meant in this verse verse but if a child is allowed to remain a child oh just let them be who they want to be explore who they think they are find out for themselves and even as we've maybe seen as of late to where they won't put a gender on the birth certificate because won't name the child because they want they them to figure it out on their own and there's a lot of approaches where this this newborn is going to find their own way and explore their own way and the Bible is saying if you don't train that child up in the way that it should go that's a shame to you and they will shame you they can't just be allowed to remain a child oh isn't that great the goooo Goa a they beautiful and they wonderful just let them just let them enjoy that and be what they want to be there comes a time when you've got to approach the child to train them and let the rod and reproof give wisdom it's what the uh the rod and reproof the correction and even the disciplining and even if we want to say this uh use of a rod this physical punishment the way that you uh trust that you're doing as you feel let with your individual children using love and wisdom and restraint so that it's proper but there is a you've got that's what should give the child wisdom to grow correctly the Bible says Folly is rooted in children at Birth and so it's in their nature and correction is the means of reforming that nature you're not necessar reforming their soul you're not going to get them the Holy Ghost by beating them and you may think you're beating the Devil out of them when you spank them but that's not going to give them the Holy Ghost and if you apply discipline incorrectly you are reforming their nature can cause you can cause a lot of future problems but properly administer this correction is a means of reforming that foolish nature to where they're no longer foolish so foolishness is bound in the heart of a child when one is foolish if there's foolishness they're childlike they lack wisdom so if you when you see like this characterization of one being foolish they haven't properly developed or grown as they ought to what's expected if you if you walked into a restaurant today and you saw a grown man over there with a binky in his mouth sucking on a pacifier you say well that's foolish you look over there and you see a six-month-old doing it you'd be like that's that's not foolish all right you see a man over there with a blanket and a stuffed stuffed teddy bear you say that's that's crazy this man's crazy's acting like a child but then a child doing it you don't even judge it whatsoever and so this is you would train and and and that that's a shame to the right if the guy's gr adult and he's holding on to a blanket and wearing a diaper and sucking on a binky because he never was trained out of that and so this correction properly administered will the Bible says that that it the rod of Correction will drive foolishness away and it will deliver his soul from hell and it'll do it so that he shall not die correction properly applied will will deliver the child keep the child from harm not inflict it I that's a good uh maybe a good way of looking at that is that you if you trained them properly if you discipline them correctly and I I maybe I'm spending more time on this than I envisioned uh but I want to maybe having pointed to this I feel that it it deserves some attention that in training our children and however that we would do that we will save them as the Bible says from death and from harm and injury and that discipline should not be inflicted the injury and so the word says and I would say based upon these scriptures we must discipline our children and it times corporately where there is pain as a consequence they are going to feel it but physical pain alone does not produce the results physical pain alone will not produce the results proposed by the scripture that uh foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child and if you if you give the correction uh then the and reproof will give wisdom you say all the rod and reproof will give wisdom you're a failure and then expect the child to be wise that's not what the Bible's saying it's but even though it is scripturally saying one thing if you don't apply it correctly you won't get the results that the Bible suggest that you will have failure to apply the wisdom and the nurture with the nature of the word will cause abuse by the word gu what I'm saying the Bible says take the rod and correct your child so just grabs the rod corrects the child and it produces different results but yet it was quote unquote by the word in Proverbs 3 chapter 3: 11 and 12 my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth he correct even as a father the son in whom he delighteth when a father has Grace towards his son favor pleasure towards his child even the father who is so loving and kind and smitten with his children a father that loves his children will correct them will chasen them so he says whom the Lord loveth and every son that he receiveth he scourgeth he he he chastens and so don't despise it when the Lord corrects you don't get weary of his correction because even the father who is the most smitten and in love and delights in his child will correct and Scourge and smite or chasen and correct his child but the Bible says in Hebrews 12:11 drawing from these various same scriptures now no chastening for the present seem to be joyous but Grievous when we are chastened of the lord we feel it when our parents after the flesh chastened Us in even in a physical way or they used words we felt it nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby how many have been exercised by chastening how many had some parents that exercised uh uh this kind of chastening and what the if if Don in the right way It ultimately produces this Peaceable fruit of righteousness where you don't see this as a result something's wrong in the application somewhere the word misapplied will not produce the results the word says will uh will transpire you could have the outward appearance and you could have maybe an image or some sort of semblance semblance of what the word is saying in a legalistic way but it's not the proper expression and let me use this again as I'm trying to blend some subjects and go further in uh in this into is there room for Mercy I just feel like there needs to be some of this connection here let me use this example of a False Image here's a false image of Proverbs 13 Proverbs 23 Proverbs 22 Proverbs 29 Proverbs 3 Hebrews 12 here's a False Image a spanked child and you see a child spanked and you see them crying and maybe you see them being corporate punished and and you look at that and you say well that's a scriptural image but that does that that's not telling the whole story because that isn't the aim of the scripture that isn't the goal to have spank children right I mean if the goal was just to spank children I'd wake up every day and just beat my kids and say well the word of God's been fulfilled you know that's what church becomes right spare the rod SP the child I'm not going to spare you sheep you're going to get it and there's your image spank children that's a False Image because we're not examining the fruit that precedes afterwards we're we're not waiting say well what kind of does it produce Peaceable fruit or does everybody just cow down and cower and everyone obeys the man of the house and everyone's afraid and as soon as the garage door is opening everyone has a panic attack because Dad's coming home and he's going to produce a scriptural image of a home under subjection by producing spank children and a wife that keeps her mouth shut so well that's that's that's a False Image because all you're doing is replicating a rod to the backside of a kid and saying that's the word no that's not the word and in the same way talk about you know maybe hard right here but in the same way we could have a false image of crying babbling youngans right that's what we have we have we have this move we have this look we have this expression of crying shouting screaming dancing tongue-talking people and we say oh that that's the image but it can be a false image because the word is aiming for something more you can't look at the spank child say oh that's wrong well no you can't say that nor can you point to say now that's perfect there's got to be more to this image that God's wanting to accomplish and I want to use that I'm using this example I don't know if you could call it as a fulcrum but just as a a touch Point even as a way of saying that in the same way that these things in Proverbs about correcting children it's a truth it's an absolute truth can be misapplied and used to abuse in the same way other things are used and they're truth but they're used to for the wrong slant the wrong motive without the right purpose it's not yielding the right kind of fruit ultimately that the word of God says should be produced and we can't be deceived into just narrow being narrow-minded about well this is what it says this is what it says but we want to catch the heart of God in everything he has said in Psalms 103: 13 and 18 says like as a father pth his children so the Lord pth them that fear Him pth in the Hebrew there is Raam it means to love deeply to be compassionate to have tender affection it means to have mercy as a father pth his children so the Lord pth them that fear Him I so this we'll see it here in the scripture in a moment the Lord's Mercy this compassion this tender affection as a father has this affection a son in whom the father Delights as a father pies his children the Lord pies them that fear Him and so the Lord's uh attitude is hard is the Lord's Mercy is tied to this deep love and compassion and I want you to catch this pity in order to truly have pity as a father pth his child notice not says as a man pies children right for the most part we probably you know are jealous of just children in general they get to nap they have snacks you know right there's things that we might we might pity we might be jealous but in this way it says a father pies his own child why he knows them and not in the sense of wow he's a you know he's a real knucklehead but it's this understanding of that the true condition and the helplessness and even the potential and the struggles they go through so it's rooted in some understanding of the child is the father has this tender affection and compassion and pies his child the Lord pies them that fear Him and notice this connection in verse 14 for he knoweth our frame he remember that we are dust there's your uh uh that connection to as a father knows his child and has compassion the Father Knows us knows our frame knows who we are knows where we come from as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourisheth for the wind passeth over and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more but the mercy of the Lord is from Everlasting to Everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children not just the children grandchildren to such as keep his Covenant and to those that remember his Commandments to do them but the mercy of the Lord the Lord pities as a father pth his children this to to love deeply to be compassion have tender affection it means to have mercy and then it says the mercy of the Lord this Hebrew word cassed it speaks of uh to of goodness kindness faithfulness it is often connected with pity and this uh Raam it's this uh compassion this desire the mercy of the goodness of God the kindness of God the faithfulness of the Lord is from Everlasting to Everlasting this is where I want to start to blend some of these concepts of the house of the Lord and youngans with this next subject is there room for Mercy Mercy we know is a very vast subject I've been looking at it aresh myself it's such a large Concept in the scripture misunderstood misapplied controversial in some ways but it's such a important part of the story of redemption and I'd like to as we're looking at the father's attitude towards a child youngans growing up into maturity what I this has come come to me in several different ways as of late that this Mercy is at the heart of this it's it's an element perhaps that's missing that causes the confusion and I'll say this before we go on to our text if you want to turn to 2 Samuel 7 I'll start with verse 12 that in the house of the Lord just get this picture in your mind in the house of the Lord and how that God arranged I want you to think very spiritually and explore this deeply now that there was an arrangement in the house of the Lord of outer Court inner Court the holiest of holies the most holy place the holy place and that that uh Arrangement as we've looked at in great detail was saying something about God it was uh uh emphasizing about something about God's character and about his house the house the Lord was saying something about God it tells the story of redemption and in the most holy place of all the elements and everything that you read about in the most holy place there was truth and mercy there was really nothing else that's not inside or connected with those that representation in the most holy place there was the ark which contained the law there is your truth and then you had the covering or the seat that was on top of that Ark so that it became one thing and those cherubs forming the covering that was called The Mercy Seat so there's all sorts of stuff everywhere else all sorts of activity in the outer all sorts of offerings and Washings in the inner but once you went in behind that Veil all there was was truth and mercy that should tell you something that should tell you something about God something about the the word and something about the truth and mercy in 2 Samuel 7:12 this Builds on the thought of a father connects with the youngans going up to maturity and this new uh focus on Mercy and these are the words that are being spoken and when th thy days of God to through Nathan to David and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdom it's speaking very particularly of Solomon yet here David the king who had a desire to build the house of the Lord who couldn't because he was a bloody man he had murdered but yet his house his name right this the son the builder of the family name the the one that the the first born that comes we looked at in the scripture on Wednesday is the one that builds the house and a brother who doesn't perform his duty isn't interested in building the house so it's going to be in the family he says he shall build a house for my name and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever and then God says this to David about his own son I will be his father and he shall be my son now that you know I don't know how would you act if somebody went up to you and said hey uh you know your boy over there I'm going to be his daddy he be like Luca don't talk about never mind Booker like that he says I will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children men now God's telling us something very deep here I think it's just beautiful he says I'm going to be his father he's going to be his son and if he does something wrong I'll correct him with the rod of men there'll be a price to pay with the stripes of the ch but my Mercy shall not depart away from him God is telling us something very important as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee if you didn't catch Wednesday night I really encourage that those of you who follow are following the the series here go listen to Wednesday night cuz kind of trying to end the thought on the when the youngans don't grow up and Saul is that final example of one who wouldn't listen and because he wouldn't listen he lost something doesn't lose his salvation God didn't call him a reprobate and a heathen but he lost the throne and he lost it for his own children and so we can always have a relationship with God but benefits and privileges that come by that relationship can be forfeited through rebellion and stubbornness which Saul demonstrated and so Saul here is put away he says but says something M remarkable to David I won't take my Mercy away from your son and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee thy Throne shall be established forever God is expressing something about the the proper elements of a relationship in this uh and even it speaks of a family relationship I'll be his father and he shall be my son so there's chastening with the rod there's Stripes of a child he's saying if there's going to be a relationship of a parental figure to a child then there's got to be correction there's got to be chastening he says the rod of men and the the stripes of a child we go back to Proverbs and we see those very things that he's talking about but the very next thing he says is but his Mercy would not depart and this is why the house was established forever cuz this Mercy is an essential characteristic it's this it's this necessary attribute maybe I could put it this way it's an absolute necessary material to build the house if you're going to fix it if you're going to establish the house of the Lord you couldn't just throw out all the raw materials you couldn't just have a rod you can't just have stripes you've got to have mercy and God reveals the type of character that fathers should be aiming for that parents and leaders should be aiming for he reveals the type of character that a father should have and it's the type of character that we should seek to cultivate at home because God wants his young to grow up and he's showing us the way that's why I was so encouraged personally and even as a pastor when brother elizer ministered on a deep to respond in the approach that he took is like this is this is necessary when we're looking at things in the scripture be therefore perfect and the great standards that God's wanted to use in our lives and we look at it from our standpoint say God's doing overtime to get me where I need to be and I'm not getting there and then the word of Lord word of the Lord comes along and expresses great Mercy says I'll get you there just keep yielding I'll get you there then brother Reggie preaching on PTSD I wish brother John I wish you wouldn't have spoiled the punchline because man it was just wonderful a posttraumatic stress uh disorder he said but no the d stands for deliverance because God in his Mercy just doesn't want to leave us victims to our trauma he actually can use it right use the trigger use the trauma not only having delivered us but now use it to propel us to Greater Heights and to perfect our character and so God wanting us to grow up he's not just going to use the rod he's not just going to use chasing and he's going to use Mercy it takes speaking the truth you've got you you you've got got to have a standard you've got to tow the line you've got to do things according to the word of God if you fail to speak truth if you fail to correct that's a lacking of truth but an overcorrection is a lack of Mercy an over application or misapplying it or going to some extreme not catching the heart of it that's a lack of Mercy yeah maybe you maybe you don't correct you're lacking truth but if you don't correct correctly you're lacking the mercy and it takes truth and mercy to have Christ amen amen meditate on that you can have truth but if you don't have mercy you don't have all of Christ because truth is something else if it's divorced from Mercy in 1 Corinthians chap 4: 14-6 I want you to see this in the heart of Paul he says I have I write not these things to shame you but as my beloved Sons I warn you as God said that he would be a father to Solomon and that he would Solomon would be his son and that he would uh correct him but his Mercy would never depart from that correction that the correction would not be punitive but it would be remedial restorative that he was looking to promote Solomon and the seed after David to establish a house forever so he was not trying to punish and put away or destroy expressing something very beautiful in God's character Paul is now expressing likewise similar things to the children or his beloved Sons as converts and cians I'm not right in these corrective words just to shame you I'm not just calling you out I'm not just exposing you he says for though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ I think it's important remember correction should never result in shame for though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ you have not yet not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel Paul is likening himself as to a father in The Gospel so he says wherefore I beseech you be you followers of me now someone that would say that without the wrong heart is wanting to bring followers to themselves make it all about them and it's the the ministry is what I call it and they are both mean and it's all about me and so in this ministry it's gaining followers to themselves but we know Paul said be followers of God as dear children he's saying as I follow Christ follow me so his heart was right and we don't fear uh though you know in our your own household a father should always be praying Lord I want to be the right kind of example because whether I like it or not my children are watching and and and they're going to follow me so I want to walk closely to God and I want to be I want to be like Christ so that as they desire to be like me they're coming closer to God's heart and that they would have their own experience so Paul is expressing this and he starts out by saying this correction is not meant to shame but as a father to you and because there's this relationship and bond of love I'm trying to promote growth so he says be ye followers of me he's not looking for discipline he's not looking for subjection he's not looking for absolute obedience and just say yes sir and if I say jump you say how high or whatever you want to say it's it's one of those things where he says I'm trying to demonstrate I'm trying to teach and cultivate because I want you to become and so the rule and discipline the law or the truth must have the same nature of the truth and Paul's expressing that the nature there has to be a relationship there so that one could understand the heart of the one being corrected and the one being corrected can understand and be connected to the heart of the corrector and it gives that context to where correction discipline training comes from a place where the one doing the teaching understands the condition of the young and wants to promote growth and the young and understands the heart of the teacher and wants to come into the image of the master he says in 1 Thessalonians 21 as you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his children this is how Paul is writing this is how he approached the church this is how he wrote to his converts we've exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you a father exhorts he Comforts and charges as a father doth his children so Paul had to speak truth but he's not just speaking truth he's showing Mercy we've identified this here recently in Galatians 4:19 my little children of whom I travail and birth again until Christ be formed in you in Galatians he's talking about the subject of adoption he's looking how that one would just would not just begin in Christ but would grow into the image of Christ having begun in Christ that you had grow to this maturity and Paul was striving and teaching he was exhorting he was comforting he was charging he was not riding to shame but he was approaching the church and saying hard things but he was joining it together with Mercy because he didn't want just to have disciples to himself he wanted to see Christ in them that was his aim Christ be formed manifest itself in attitude and behavior and conduct that morphe to where Christ be formed in you to where you are the very bearer of Christ Image in his heart and to do this it took pity it took love it took truth and it took Mercy in order to know how and to properly cultivate this image look at how he addressed the Corinthian Church many called it out but he did it in such a way to where he addressed it he even they think to them he says What would you want me to come to you with a rod and and some of us would read in Proverbs and say that's exactly what you should do Paul see you want me to come and you want me to beat it out of you he said would you want me to come with love I said well that doesn't mean there's no Rod doesn't mean there's not correction doesn't mean the words won't sting or hurt but what he's saying is that what do you want me to do just come in and start uh beating you shaming you tearing things up or would you want me to come with the rod of Correction and reproof that gives wisdom would you want me to come and address it as a father with his children and not just an angry Shepherd who's sick of sheep don't have the love of God in our heart right so in Galatians chapter 3: 1 to 4 here's Paul giving us this he's demonstrating this all foolish Galatians foolishness is bound in the heart of a child and he's saying you're childlike all the foolishness isn't out of you yet who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would I learn of you this is the only question I have I got one question to ask he says received you the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith it's one thing he wants to know but he's going to break it up into a few different questions receive you the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith how did you receive the spirit through Works did you did you earn it did you jump high enough what did you do or did Faith hearing the word and a confirmation of your faith was the Seal of God so he says are you so foolish are you so childish are you so immature having begun in the spirit hearing the word believing the word the faith in God's word the Seal of God the birth is a seal of your faith not your shouting not your emotion not your works but having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by this flesh how childish are you to think that you can take control of this process he says have you suffered so many things in vain he says if it be yet in vain and I love that because suffering is the process of character development and once we've endured and the sufferings of this present time are cultivating this great Glory inside of us so he's saying that you are to this place where you've suffered but if you remain foolish it's in vain if you don't grow up it's in vain he goes but if it yet be in vain because I'm calling you out cuz I don't want you to remain foolish I I don't want you to remain immature you're not growing up and this is where I see this overlap to in this growing from emphy to adulthood it takes truth and mercy it takes it takes this tremendous balance in the word of God that can only come from God everything in the I guess it's such a man it's just leod DEA I think it's just the best way it's just gray it's everything's mixed CU on one hand you say well it's it's it's polarized and you it's on on the left it's on the right and everything's polarized and and then you start getting into it and you're like I don't even know where they all stand it's all confusing nothing makes sense and you got this side that says this and that side and everybody's trying to pull it every every all these different sides and so we get into this idea that there's this it's just this binary system and we're saying oh yeah that's right everyone's over here and everyone's over there then we hear somebody saying no it's not non it's it's non-binary it's nonbinary like it's got to be nonb wait wait what's going on it's crazy out there and the only way you're going to find the balance is to tap into the heart of God to really catch the heartbeat of the word of God and that's what's going to help help you to take a look at a situation and not be polarized yourself and not hate this side and clean lean to this side and get mixed up in the politics of it but live Above It Rise Above It resurrect take a step higher out of leod DEA and come into the Capstone age in your heart and your relationship with God to where you can look at all the rest and know where they are and have pity it's going to take Mercy together with this truth he says cuz they've been Bewitched I mean that's quite a quite a statement right they've been Bewitched it's to bring evil on one by feigning praise it's using deceit you know ah you've been Bewitched kind of coaxed into this evil eye they CH Charmed I mean Bewitched they've been Charmed into something they've been kind of coaxed and cultivated and used that that in innocence and that infan and use kind of their their trusting and their enthusiasm and bewi them into transmitting their Zeal towards just blowing out a lot of steam in works of the Flesh and when he says Bewitched I know we kind of just think about you know the twitch of a nose and poof something happening but it's it speaks to a deception and Jesus says in Matthew 24:24 that it's going to be so close in the end time the spirit of Deceit and the false Christ false Christ and it says he's go they're going to produce and show by false prophecies and signs and wonders that are great and the signs and wonders going be so great that if it were possible it would deceive the very elect such an image and such a false image that unless God would say I will not let it happen it would deceive the very elect I see the same with Solomon and the words of Christ too H H uh excuse me the words of God through Nathan to David that what if it wasn't for God just saying he would do it it wouldn't have happened and so God makes it an impossibility that the elect can be deceived but yet it tells us there's a bewitching that in our foolishness in our infancy in our youthful state if we're not growing properly then we fail to discern Paul says having our s senses exercised as we grow by going from milk to meat we're able to like whoa there's a bewitching here this is muddled this is confusing this is a Pale Horse I don't I'm not sure what's happening here this is really really h h h there's a mixture here I need to know I need to understand I need to get through this there'll be those that are Bewitched in Matthew 7 that come before the Throne of God and they'll say Lord we've prophesied in thy name we've cast out devils in thy name and in thy name done many wonderful wonderful works and his response in Matthew 7:23 is not to say no you didn't he's just say depart from me I never knew you and he says you're workers of iniquity toward still at the end of the day the prophecy the casting and the working amounted to iniquity they elicit their works and his his summation in the end is oh at the end of the day all your works are iniquity how they're performing the signs they're performing the Wonders things are happening what would it become a False Image because it didn't produce the fruit that the seed is supposed to produce it might look like True Vine it might act like true word it might look like the truth but at the end when you examine the fruits of it what does it promote and produce in the end he says man I'm sorry you did run well but who who who kept you from obeying the truth it looked good everything was lining up just right but you you failed in the mercy you you failed in the application you failed in the growth you failed in the image ultimately and I believe this is at the heart of what brother brandham was teaching there in the sh Port Series in 1965 he takes that sermon the next day after invisible union he says that's the reason I say people can jump up and down and speak in tongues people can shout lay hands on the sick and heal the sick and so forth by faith and don't you dare say it's not God right I remember one time somebody said oh did you hear Vander Holyfield said that he went to Benny Hinn's meeting and he prayed for him and and God healed a hole in his heart he said God didn't do that I'm like why not I mean God's A Healer that's what God does so if I if I I didn't have to believe that brother Benny Hinn well you know was upstanding honest you know good guy or whatever and I'm not advocating for a Vindication of his ministry thank God that Benny Henn was able to promote enough atmosphere for Evander Holyfield to say I believe God's A Healer and healed the whole in his heart who did that not Benny hen my god did so I don't have to disparage and run down and shame and tear apart and judge all because maybe it feels like some sort of threat to me no I believe that I believe that's what God does by faith they can do all these he says great things by the spirit but still be lost and he says anointed ones there is an anointing there is a move there's things that happen and we want to be careful that we never say that's not God but God's not just a move flesh God's not just a promoter of excitement God is a Visionary father who looks at our lives and says I'll provide these things for you I'll even give you these things in the Youth of your experience because I want to establish you and I want to cultivate you but as we go in this I want to grow you to be more mature more solid I want you to learn how to swim without splashing all the water out of the pool I want you to be able to take that that Steam and put it in the into the engine to cause those Wheels to move and God has a way of training us because he's not just interested interested in truth without Mercy but they have been met together and at the end of the sermon an invisible Union brother Brams has an Al alar call he says I wonder around the altar now those who are kneeling here many of you claim to be Christians but you felt there's always something somewhere that you didn't possess wow there's some self-examination you know something's missing he says you might have done all the religious Act remember he may be talking to people who thought they were the youngans he may be talking to people who demonstrated all these outward signs and because they did they thought that's it this is the seal this is the This is the End you might have done all the religious acts you might have shouted you might have done all things might have danced in the spirit you might have spoken tongues and no one can say anything wrong against that that's true that's all good and we say Amen it's true it's all good right but you see that's gifts of the Spirit without the spirit or we can say according to how he explains it in other places it can be the the the gift of the spirit without the spirit indwelling if the spirit was there that feeling wouldn't be condemned like that so he said God's dealing with your heart as a father dealing deeply with you don't don't chase that voice away don't rationalize well I did this I did that follow that leading it's how God deals with you through his spirit in the heart of a man do you really sincerely hear at the altar believe that right now while you're here that just the act of turning yourself loose and we're all like oh yeah that that that's what I'm talking I want to get loose right and he says not an emotion now because that's what some people think I just want to let loose says not an emotion but in a genuine unadulterated faith that God notice this this is what this is what he wants you to let loose too that God will receive you and nurture you with his word until you are eagles yourself and can fly he's telling he's telling them in such a beautiful way truth and mercy saying if you're not a young and you need to be a young and if you're young and you need to grow up you need the baptism so will you now in an act of turning Yourself Loose with a sincere belief in your heart not an emotion why is he tampering that because it was them there that Pentecostal hotbed that would tend to those emotions he says no not an emotion now those Sensations with it emotion goes with it he's not saying anything against that he said that's all good but he says but in genuine unadultered faith that God will receive you and God chastens and scourges every son that he receiveth God will receive you and nurture you this is not just an experience but he will nurture you with his word until you are born again by the the word of God and teaches you how to fly where you grow up amen I'm just going to stop there we'll pick up the rest of it on Wednesday night let's stand is there room for Mercy is there a place and I'm skipping a lot here so I don't want this to seem disjointed but I want to read a scripture to close just to kind of wet your whistle a little bit in this is there a place in our hearts is there a place in our homes is there a place in this church for Mercy I touch it on it Lord willing a little bit on Wednesday night or is there just a lot of personal opinion and judgment or is there just indifference well are realize sometimes if we've been the victim of harsh judgment if we've been a victim of the word misapply sometimes we can just swing the other way and just be indifferent so much uh vital and animous and hatred and such uh spewing forth of anger towards something and we don't share in that so what happens is we just become indifferent towards it you find out so- and so is doing something and this is happening and you're like oh well you know I don't get all worked up like they do about it well yeah maybe you don't need to get worked up about it but maybe you shouldn't just be so blasé about it but is so in that is it all indifference is it all legalism is it all harsh or is there room for Mercy it's the mercy that calls away from those sides and brings us to the very center amen and as we're using this image of youngans and a a certain scriptural pattern that we can cabbage down on or even statements of the Prophet to say well this is what we need to produce this is what we need to produce and you can't really argue that's what the spirit produces but is there enough Mercy in our hearts to say that not only is that true but that that that there it must yield the Peaceable fruit that with it there's Mercy to teach and to train and to discipline and take that be press into the perfect things of God and if you could take time to read if you want to read the book of Hosea it's not long if you want to read chapter 6 it's really at the heart of some of these things I'm speaking on but in Hosea chapter 6 particular verses 1 to 7 verse 6 it says for I desired mercy so where he's saying I've smitten but I'm going to heal I've I've scourged I've done these but I'm going to bind you up he says I'm going to revive you I'm going to live in my presence and you're going to know the Lord he says I desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings think of that Saul was bent on justifying his Disobedience because he could perform all sorts of religious acts and Samuel said no no to bayy is better than sacrifice to listen to God to hearken to God is better than the fat of rams and here in Hosea says you know what Mercy is better than sacrifice God desired mercy God didn't want the sacrifice this listen I hope you catch this he it wasn't the sacrifice that he wanted the offerings the praise the blood the Bullocks the incense and all it wasn't all that that he wanted what he wanted was Mercy it wasn't all about the offerings and the outer court and the inner court that was all a process to get us to that place of mercy and the knowledge of God it was all a process to bring us to a place of that behind the veil the most holy Place into the house of God the true Dwelling Place of the shikina to where when you come in behind that Veil all that other stuff is behind you it was part of this process to get you where you are now but there now in his presence what is there mercy and Truth he desired mercy and the knowledge of God more than the sacrifice more than the offerings and if the sacrifice and offerings bring us to that place we can never do away with them but we got to recognize what it was for he says but they like men have transgressed the Covenant there have have they dealt treacherous treacherously against me should I have you all say treacherously yeah thank you I couldn't even get it right my interpreter without Mercy against God he desired Mercy not sacrifice and the the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings Lord help me search my heart is there room for Mercy you're students of the Bible you know this is an important subject in the end times when judgment comes and and there's this oh is there when does mercy in when is it over what what where do we stand today in the urgency of the hour I in my heart say is there room for Mercy let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord our we're examining our hearts today we're asking ourselves is there is there [Music] room Lord you made a place for us at your table you found room for us you made room in your house you you built a house Lord you allowed Solomon to build the house after dwelling he said I all this time I followed you I never lived in a house of Cedar and I lived behind a tent in the Tabernacle I never asked for anything more and then David says I want to I want to build a place I want to build a place for you permanent God said I didn't ask for it but what house will you build me where's the place of my rest and you said I'll allow Solomon to build this house and in the very image of what that house was to you you said I'll be a father to him and he'll be my son son and I'll correct him and I'll train him and I'll discipline him but my Mercy will never leave him and isn't that what your house always represented whether it be the Tabernacle in the wilderness or the temple there in Jerusalem it was you with your family it's your way of dwelling with your children you didn't even care that it was a tent you just loved having your family positioned around you everyone with their ENT door facing you and you gathered them together and it didn't matter to you that it was just a temporary and these staves and these Transitions and the curtains and everything you were at home in your people and Lord when David built you that had that Vision to build you a temple and Solomon brings it to pass Lord you were pleased to come when that Ark settled in that place once again your shakana glory declared you were amongst your people in your [Music] house and Lord it has such a such a message to us that what you desire more than sacrifice and offering more than great signs and wonders more than talking in tongues and gifts and all these other things Lord that what you want is the knowledge of you and you recognize that in order for us to ever come into that Union that perfect union you're going to have to have a lot of Mercy on us and Lord as you made room for mercy and there in the shikina glory not only did you place your law but you wanted that wood overlaid with gold and there between the two cherubims you would come and settle down and you wanted to be called The Mercy Seat that's the place that you wanted to meet us and so you designate a mercy that'll never end help us father to make room for this Mercy forgive us Lord for our failures and our mistakes Lord I pray that you forgive me as a husband and as a father Lord if I failed in this Mercy Lord I pray that you forgive me as a pastor that if truth has been lifted up in Mercy lay it aside Lord we quickly take it back up recognize Lord to not speak the truth as a lack of truth but Lord to mishandle truth as a lack of Mercy I don't want to be guilty Lord bless us today as we desire your loving Embrace as we believe that you're with us and you've confirmed your presence may you be merciful to our hearts Lord may you bless our children children bless our family heal those that are sick be a comfort to those that are visitors today Lord May above all may your peace guide them may they know that you're real you're mindful of them Lord that you have their best in mind Lord I pray this in my heart just now recalling the things that we've skipped over how that you as a father know each one of us in such a particular way where you would not force anything on us so Lord I will not force anything on anyone else but admonish them to receive you completely and holy without reservation bless us I pray Lord as we dismiss this service shortly as we worship you be with us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
