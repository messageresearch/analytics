TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners it means bitter hostility against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds amen we desire that god would bless the words which we've read you can be seated we're continuing on the subject of pure joy and the title of victory ahead is victory now and pure joy is the joy of the lord there's no other way of looking at it and we know the joy of the lord is our strength and the pure joy that we're identifying is the joy of the lord and it's a joy that he gives and we find in the scripture that the joy that he gives no man shall take away from you so it's a joy that you have a right to it's a joy that you ought to be able to believe is yours it's your possession and uh you don't need to let somebody steal that joy and we are looking at these three verses in the book of hebrews and in chapter verse 2 it says looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith so there's a beginning and there's a perfecting and so there's an in-between there's a process where it's developing and it says so we're looking to jesus and then paul wants us to recognize these two things who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame disregarding it and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god so and then in the next verse it says so consider him so you're looking unto him and you're considering him and it points out that he endured death he disregarded shame and he could deal with the bitter hostility all because of the joy that was set before him and so there's a joy set before him as he's enduring bitter hostility there's a joy set before him as he's facing death and with that joy set before him we see where he ends up he ends up at the right hand of the throne of god and we saw how that even with respect when we were looking at the scripture on wednesday night how that rachel had a son and called him man of sorrow but then israel says no he shall be the son of my right hand we see this expressed in christ a contradiction of sinners we see this hostility and even death and disregarding the shame of that death and he went to the cross and died with the joy that was set before him and now he's set at the right hand of the throne of god and we broke it up in this way and we're just backgrounding a little bit for a few moments here at the outset how the we could see this snapshot of his life where his present circumstances were bitter hostility shame and death that's what he was going through literally enduring those things but then his future circumstances was to be at the right hand of the right hand of the throne of god so he has his present circumstances and he has his future circumstances and so the joy of christ the source of his joy was his hope it wasn't oh he loved being beaten and he loved dying and he loved the shame and so it's instructive to us because we say well this is difficult and persecution is hard and rejection hurts and it's painful when this happens and and i don't like it when that happens you're not supposed to love those things that's not what joy means of the joy of the lord and if you're and well you just don't have any faith if that bothers you no that's not what faith means faith is not the absence of some contrary emotion and faith is not the absence of being uncomfortable and neither is joy the absence of pain or sorrow but it's having something deeper and more settled than any of that and that's what christ had is his hope was his the source of his joy and that's why paul says look to him look to him look to jesus look at what he did and how he could go through bitter hostility and and disregard the shame and even submit himself to death so he says look to him and he says consider him so this is what we want to do we want to look to jesus as the author and finish of our faith who had this particular way that he approached his difficulties and his challenges and it's what gave him the right conduct in the midst of everything that he was going through and so we we placed it this way something about his future changed the way his present was characterized he who for the joy that was set before him he endured in the present tense who for the situations that he was enduring and the situations that he was facing was able to go through difficulties and and overcome the situation he was in so something about his future was changing his present tense and that's why we take this statement victory ahead is victory now that if we know that we're going to ultimately win then there's no point we're losing because it's all part of the outcome i say oh well you were down and this was happened and you were behind and you were you had this take place and you had this taken away from you there's nothing you haven't lost here that's not already won back there and that's what redemption is all about so no matter what snapshot you might want to take in someone's life and said oh they're defeated and they're downcast and they're rejected no if they ultimately win they're always winning and so victory ahead if we can believe and be convinced of an ultimate victory then we can believe and that we are victorious now and conduct ourselves accordingly and as we were looking at how there's a little bit of a misunderstanding that perception is reality and how that our perception does not change reality but our perception of our circumstances typically determines our state of mind or our condition within that our reality so if we perceive something a certain way then we're going to react towards what we perceive if we perceive a threat we're going to act a fearful or we're going to run or we're going to flee or maybe get paralyzed or maybe we'll fight if we perceive something a certain way we're going to act accordingly and so that's important to understand that what you perceive what you understand and what you know determines how that you'll act and what we're wanting to identify and point to is that we can perceive something greater than the circumstances that we're presently in we can perceive something beyond what's natural and beyond these five senses to determine our state of mind and our condition within this present reality because our joy is not the product of our current circumstances but our joy as we're calling it the pure joy is a condition that can be influenced by your future and this may be seen where it's paradoxical and also i realized as i was pondering over this weekend that it may be uh stating the obvious and if it's stating the obvious and just kind of well this is not anything we don't already know then i would say that from my vantage point as i look at it if it's something we already know then it's something i want to fully implement and rely on and rest in as to the way that i conduct myself in my everyday relationships and the situations that i'm in to believe that right now my emotions my state of mind and my conduct can be influenced not by all the symptoms and circumstances that surround me in this natural world but by an eternal condition and by a truth and a promise that exists beyond these senses he said i have not seen nor ear heard neither entered into the heart of men the things which god has prepared for them that love him he says but he's revealed it to us by his spirit why does he reveal us things that are prepared why does he reveal us things that are forward-looking why does he reveal us things that are in the future so that the future can impact our present he reveals it to us now because it it ought to cause us to act it might ought to cause us to think a certain way and live a certain way that the same principle applies why he doesn't show us something sometimes you ever wondered why didn't he show me that why didn't he tell me this was going to happen it really would have been nice to know beforehand because god knew that if he showed you too soon you might not have the right response or he knew that if you knew that it would change the way that you would act and god is shaping things and forming things and guiding things to bring a past his perfect will and so the same principle applies and that he shows you things because he wants it to change what you're doing now change your mindset change your attitude and give you a hope for the future and so the reality of eternity should press itself into our reality now the reality of eternity ought to influence how we think how we act how we feel how we conduct ourselves in present tense because the things that are to be are supposed to change the way things are we could spend a lot of time looking at how that virtual reality synthetic reality and and the the the things that are presented to us as a replacement for literal contact with human beings and real people and real interactions and things becoming virtual and more through media and through the uh immersing ourselves in something that is digital how that that's actually changing the way we think in the way that we act and the way that we interact with real things for me i had this happen several years ago and went in that i realized just the impact technology was having on me when i was reading my bible and i did this i'm holding a physical bible and i use my thumb to scroll scroll the column and i was like wow this is this is changing the way that i interact i handed um i think i handed a picture to somebody one day and they tried to zoom on it zoom in on it no wow that's technology if you could manage to do that uh and it's because we it's changing the way that we interact it's changing the way that we think it's changing the way that people perceive themselves because things can be digitally altered and and i bring that up just to make this point if things that aren't real can change your actual behavior how much more ought things that are to be and are more real than the things that are change our behavior the things that are to be ought to influence and change the way that things are now and we ought to have this attitude to believe that our future will change our present and therefore we develop this discipline of faith where we're going to we're not going to reach into our past to define who we are now in our carnal past and our problems and our mistakes and our failures and our past interactions and our broken promises and everything that we've gone through we're not going to use our past to construct our perception of our reality and to define who we are present tense but we'll use revelation to be who we actually are and and be who we actually are even if circumstances don't change even if environment doesn't change if laodicea doesn't change if politics get worse if economics get worse if the social climate gets worse no matter what happens i can i can have this disposition and character within my heart to believe that i am going to become who i'm supposed to be by revelation of my future and not because of all the circumstances and symptoms that exist around me and therefore if i can do that i can rest joyfully i can joyfully rest i i can take rest in the joy of the lord and conduct myself in the midst of all these things that are taking place the right way and so it brings us to a statement that has formed part of the basis for this uh series on pure joy brother brown is talking about the love of god and how it's misunderstood and and they look to human characteristics and interpret human experience by human experience and even by your own feelings the love of god and how they miss the mark on god's love and he says we know that he loves us because he elected us and we'll come to that those points here in a moment but then he says how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy admits the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass now this is to me very personally a heavy statement that the proof of my love to god is the attitude that i carry when i go through something difficult i i'll just make the confession on my behalf and the neighbors next door there's not much proof that i love god at times if it's purely based upon how i'm going through conflict and how i'm handling adversity and how you doing brother and i don't you know i don't really appreciate what happened and i think this is bad and this is horrible and i can't believe they treated us that way and it's like whoa you don't really love god at all do you because this is this is actually saying that the proof of our love is that we believe what he said and we can all get rally around that faith faith yes we believe but then i must conduct myself with joy in all the trials i go through because all that if he permits the trial it's his wisdom that permitted it there's no unwise trial that slips by while he's over here trying to figure out brother mitch all of a sudden the trial gets onto you and oh no i didn't mean that to happen to sister so-and-so no that's not how it works anything he allows to happen is in his wisdom so then i have this uh instructions from the word of god it says in every trial in every situation shoulders back chin up conduct yourself with joy and then so i believe that there is an understanding then of what it means to conduct ourselves a joy and that we ought not to default to a bubbly personality or default to you know kind of a fake put on uh syrupy sappy uh you know persona when you're going through difficult things like how's everything going you know i just love it that my family hates me i've been waiting for this for 46 years and you know what it happened so you can you can believe you can believe for yourself that you'll be rejected and you'll be scorned and you'll be hated praying for you it doesn't it doesn't need to be that way it could just be hey you know what this is hard this is difficult but the joy of the lord is my strength i don't know how this is going to turn out and this is heartbreak even with tears of sorrow and weeping if if crying was a sin jesus was a sinner if sorrow was a sin then jesus was a sinner what if the bible teaches teaches he was without sin so sorrow's not a sin crying is not a sin and so the key then that brother branham connects this to and this is where i want to try to unpack and understand this commandment that conducting ourselves with joy the key to a joyful disposition he had already elicited it was god's elective love so the how can i conduct myself with joy without discussing what that might look like because all of us conduct ourselves differently i mentioned before brother who's a friend of mine that no matter what's taking place he kind of just is real even yeah today's the best day of my life and it really is and then years later yeah today is the worst day of my life i mean it's just even it's just the way they always are so it's not so much the outward demonstration but rather the inward peace and comfort that we all might have that's connected to so without getting into what it may look like what's it connected to what is this joy that we can have in the midst of the trials that he allows to come to pass it's connected with god's elective love and brother brahm said his love is elective which he had for us notice this phrase before the foundation of the world and this is where i want to start getting in identifying more how that if by being forward-looking we can allow the future and there was so much that we ministered on last time that i hope for most of you you had listened to that and and it's connecting very well that it's forward looking into eternity that bears itself on the present tense now now there's a way that i want you to look at that it's not so much looking forward in time because we're so much creatures of chronology and and how tech seconds tick off and things go move forward on a continuum but now it's something that precedes time it's something that is beyond time it's b it's not tied to light time and matter it's something that transcends those things and so the anchor for god's elective love and our understanding of it is his love which he had for us before the world began and in john chapter 3 verse 35 it writes this in kind of this descriptive summary uh introduction to the story of christ in the book of john the father loveth the son and have given all things into his hands so that god is characterized as loving the son and has given all things into his hand so jesus did not conduct himself with joy without a knowledge and understanding of the love that god had for him so he endured the shame he despised the shame he endured the cross he put up with bitter hostility for the joy that was set before him but that joy was not just kind of a hope so it was connected to the fact that he knew that god loved him brother madam even says about job that job loved god and he knew that god loved him and this is why job could endure and go through the things that he did is he he had a grip on god and hot god had a grip on him and he knew that god loved him and that he loved god and that could give him a particular attitude and no matter what he was going through because he was confident in the love of god jesus says in john chapter 5 verse 20 for the father loveth the son and showeth him all things that himself doeth jesus is now confessing this that the father loves the son shows him all things that himself do it and then he this gives them confidence about the future and he will show him greater works than these that he may marvel he had this confidence in his relationship with the father that he who has shown me things before loves me and he'll continue to show me things in the future and so this confidence that existed in christ and how paul says looking unto him and considering him we need this type of confidence to conduct ourselves with authentic joy we need this kind of confidence we need this kind of assurance to conduct ourselves with joy and and it be a genuine joy and not a synthetic joy not a synthetic happiness that that we manufacture through dissonance and and we manufacture through all sorts of defense mechanisms but we need this kind of confidence that i fully understand that what has happened is difficult it is hard it is a loss it is it is true it is tribulation it is a trying it is suffering it is anguish it is painful but i know that he loves me and he will not suffer me to be tempted above that which i'm able i know that he's working all things for my good and you place your confidence in that nothing past present or future can separate me from the love of god that's the kind of confidence we need to conduct ourselves to joy in first john chapter 3 verses 20 to 21. it says for thought if our heart condemn us and it's talking about the love of god in in this past in these passages if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart so if our heart is condemning us and that's condemning finds fault or blame or cues if your heart is accusing you if your heart is finding fault if your heart feels blame he says god is greater than our heart and then the next phrase is the phrase to me that stands out the most and knoweth all things because our heart is what retains knowledge and information if we could say it resides within our spirits and our emotions and so conscience memory reason and affection are all these elements of our heart so if all these things condemn us he said god is greater than our hearts and regardless of what you think you know in your mind he knows all things so the fact that what he's want us to understand is yes our heart may con your heart may condemn you but god's greater than that and has a knowledge that will cast down the condemnation god is greater than your heart and he knows all things and what he knows destroys the lies that your heart is telling he says beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards god now i know that we read this and we read it in the sense to say oh well i guess i have to get rid of my condemning heart before i can have confidence with god and so he said oh well if i have a heart that convinces me then i obviously don't trust god and let's just be honest we take it that way right we can read the scriptures sometimes where it says oh well then if uh i don't really as we were mentioned before well if i conduct myself very poorly in a trial that i have well then you don't really love god no that's not that's not the point or the emphasis the emphasis is you know that he loves you and just let that have preeminence and you'll act differently and if you're not acting differently it's not because you don't love god it's because you're forgetting just how much he loves you or need to know it more and that which is going to be gap the love that you have for him so it's not that you don't love god if you don't behave well it's that you're not realizing the power and potential of the love that you have so instead of reading this well if your heart condemns you then you don't have confidence towards god let's invert it if you have confidence towards god don't let your heart condemn you because if your heart doesn't condemn you then that can only be be because you have a greater confidence in god who knows all things regardless of what your emotional state's telling you regardless of what your memory tells you your affection reason and conscience in these things if my heart is not condemning me it's because the confidence i have in god is greater and so our heart condemns us it finds fault it blames and listen our accusing hearts are full of what's called adverse knowledge knowledge that is against our best interest knowledge which is to our ill or to our bad or for our shame can we all admit to that and we won't pull up anybody's social media accounts right now to prove it but we have we have pictures we have posts we have memories we have all sorts of things we have a past all of us who've come here have a past that is not perfect and sinless and so we have gone through circumstances and situations and maybe not even the things that are overt just the thoughts that we wrestle with can condemn us yeah i haven't gone out and done it but boy i sure wished i could have i sure wish this would have happened and struggle with this and i struggle with that we have all these things which become knowledge adverse knowledge in hearts that become accusers and this is how i'm wanting to kind of understand it in uh this the sequence or how chronology can unfold are negative thoughts about what's to come and so we're not we're not looking forward to things we become apprehensive about the future our negative thoughts about how we are now or even about our future are reinforced by our painful memories or our past experiences so we we feel we we're uncomfortable about the future because what's happened in the past there's a statement in the law that says you owe you always draft according to your last deal so if you're a contract lawyer and you're drafting a contract you're going to draft the contract you're presently riding based upon how the last deal worked out based on how the last contract worked out so the contract that i signed for the hilton garden inn looks a lot different than the one i had previously signed because i'm drafting i'm drafting based upon that so now i have liquidated damages provisions i have them required to go i hope they're not streaming this they're required to go out and find me a replacement if they can't they need to pay me the difference when i rented the phoenix convention center why because prior experience is informing me now and now i'm active better cover myself better do this better do that so prior experience influences things you've happened things that you've been through think heartaches and disappointments and all those things begin to inform us how we feel now but then it also begins to shape our expectations and our anticipation about the future so it's painful memories past experiences these different things or disappointments are informing our perception as we go forward or as we think about going forward but notice how that the bible john now addresses this in the next chapter first john chapter 4 verses 16 to 19. and and he says it was such absolute terms and i believe we ought to be the same way and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us i want to have that kind of confidence i know and believe the love that he has for us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment this is where it pays off this is when it really when it really manifests itself wherein was faith abraham the faith of abraham made perfect when he offered isaac in other words it wasn't that he had deficient faith to that moment but that's when it really paid off that's when it really manifested what it was he said this is how our faith is made perfect our love is made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world well what is he is he full of fear is he full of doubt and worry and trepidation is he anxious no so as he is so are we present tense in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear now again let's invert this in the sense that don't say well if i fear i don't have perfect love because that's how the devil works on us well if you fear you don't have perfect love but it's telling us that the perfect love you have ought to cast out fear we don't have to give it any place it says because fear have torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us so our wholeness our wellness our sound mind matters and how that perfect love cast out fear because if you had perfect love and still feared you would be incomplete so perfect love exists to drive out fear fear brings the thought of punishment or negative consequence fear or dread of abandonment or or fear is a distressing emotion when you're fearful or something you're afraid of a negative impact you're not afraid of something that can't harm you you're not really worried if the stock market crashes unless you have some risk exposure in the market if you're living off the grid in a tent in sabino canyon i don't care what happens in the stock market hey i'm not tied to it but we fear if we recognize there's some consequence or negative impact based upon a certain outcome or a certain action so fear is a distressing emotion that brings a dread and so if we have a fear of rejection a fear of abandonment as it relates to our fear the wrong kind of fear towards god will he reject me will he abandon me is he going to punish me and so you live in the sphere that if something happens maybe god is finally calling on something and saying well you asked for it buddy you're going to get it we don't have to go any further than our childhood memories to know what that feels like and i i guess i'd like to say it this way it's amazing how that we can live in in the with this fear that our past is going to catch up to us and that we're constantly living right now and we're living in today present tense right now but we're living with this fear that somehow what's happened in the past is going to overwhelm us and catch up to us and in doing so we're letting the past steal our present it's gone it's history we can't do anything about it but we we use the fear of it our interpretation of it our perception of it we use the we let the past we're living under the cloud of it we're living under the the darkness of it we're living under the consequences of it and we can't ever seem to outrun it like no matter what happens i'm a victim of my past mistakes no matter what happens i'm always going to have this shadowed over me i'm always going to let it uh it's always foreboding so if you're always honored how can you look forward and see light at the end of the tunnel this rain cloud is always going to be there this feeling is always going to be there and so it's amazing how we can let the past continue to have power over us and so i want to identify this the theme and things that are to be or one of the things that themes that is in things that are to be is that eternal life gives purpose and meaning to our present lives when i say eternal life i i'm not only referring to the eternal life you possess now by the new birth but i'm also talking about the life that will live in eternity and this is something that brother branham's identifying that there's something about this eternal life in this life that's beyond this one that is so powerful and so overwhelming that we ought to let that overwhelm us and the brightness of our future be enough to chase away the clouds of our past like we live in fear that our past is going to catch up to us but we ought to just live with anticipation that our future is going to overwhelm us i'm not going to let my past catch up to me i'm catching up to my future why because my future in christ is a memory and i know it i can feel it i can see it i know it's real i'm coming to it and i don't have to worry about my past because it's going to be swallowed up in my future so our joy then is connected with the eternal not the temporal and let me ask you this what's greater what's greater 40 something years of human existence or a life that never ends what ought to have more power decades of unbelief decades of sin broken relationships bad mistakes addictions hostility bitterness estrangement decades of that or eternal life what's greater has more power and so the key scripture that brother of adam uses and things that are to be is john chapter 14 verses one to three let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also and me and that's the first part of proving our love to him by believing what he said now he's talking about troubled hearts let not your heart be troubled it means inward commotion to lose the calmness of mind to make someone restless to to be troubled the word means to strike with fear or dread so he says don't lose your rest don't be troubled in mind don't be caused to lose don't be cause to have some sort of inward commotion be settled be at rest believe in me and then this is what he uses as the basis for this confidence or an untroubled heart in my father's house are many mansions we know these are not actually uh buildings but in my father's palace in my father's house are many bodies if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again what is he wanting to set expectations and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also and it hit me a little bit differently over the last couple weeks in that if that's his future promise then as he is so are we in this world that there's something about this promise that is so certain and so sure that my heart ought not to be troubled just like the young girl on the ranch who has made the promise by the swift armor heir that i'm going to come back in a year am i going to marry you and so she could conduct herself in the midst of all the ridicule and sarcasm and bitterness of all the other girls and all the other cousins and all the other wealthy people there on the ranch wow because she was so certain that one day this man who had promised to take her away in marriage was going to come and so she could just the whole time say they have no idea oh karma's something else isn't it [Music] what what the look on their face and so oh is that really how you feel about me it's kind of like the whole thing when someone asks to speak to the manager and you're the manager say on go ahead what's your problem i want to talk to the owner i am the owner right it's like you can just you don't need to get fearful you don't need to be worried this is exactly how jesus is using these things to say look don't let your heart be anxious and it speaks to an anxiety it talks about this losing calmness of mine to make restless it's a feeling of worry or nervousness or unease and when anxiety uh becomes uh overwhelming and oftentimes anxieties relates to the imminence of an event or something about an uncertain outcome so you think something's gonna happen so you're anxious about this imminent outcome or you're you're uncertain about things how they're gonna work out it causes an anxiety and when it becomes excessive and you have this excessive apprehension it leads to compulsive behavior or even panic attacks amen all based upon what your perception of things and what you think the future is going to do or what the consequences are going to be and you have shortness of breath and accelerated a heartbeat and you things begin to your physical body begins to break down all because you're apprehensive and he's saying don't let that happen don't be anxious don't be fearful don't be worried don't be excessively apprehensive about things and he points to what will be as the source of our confidence and the way to allay a troubled heart how can we ease our fears well he goes ahead and he just points to something beyond whatever the outcome could be here notice he doesn't say hey don't let your heart be troubled none of you are going to be persecuted that would have been misleading hey don't worry from here it's a cakewalk and so oh awesome cakewalk and then things start going bad it's like i guess i didn't understand what cakewalk meant right and you just keep telling me this is really a cate walk no what you do is go this is no cake walk this is not a picnic this is war and so what god doesn't say he doesn't kind of try to oh let's just hide it from him he says nope you're going to be persecuted you can be hated you can be hunted down you're going to be killed and even to this hour we see in the word of god how the true bride is going to be hated of her brother and she's going to be persecuted and made fun of and laughed at and there's a press that comes against her for what she stands for even within the context of the message the confines of the message and so it doesn't hide the ball and say we're all gonna be one big happy family and everything's gonna be great and everything's gonna be wonderful he's just saying hey listen when it's all over this is what waits for you and not being dismissive of your pain but there's a there's a secret revelation there's a hidden revelation or let me say this there's a power in the revelation of that that can change how we relate to rejection and persecution now and that's why he points to the ultimate victory in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you but i will come again i'll receive you that where i am there you may be also christ's remedy for a distressed heart and for someone who's going through something difficult was to speak to them about a greater reality before them i can't change reality that the way things are the circumstances the situation the disappointments the heartaches the hard trials all the sufferings and those things i can't change that but i want you to see something another reality that exists and that can change the way you conduct yourself brother branham says it this way and things that ought to be pointing to this very scripture he was telling them that after death there is life because i go and prepare a place that is to receive them shows that there he was speaking to them that there was a life after this life is ended and he says and what a consolation that ought to give all of us to know that after this life is over there's a life that we go into now let's think very let's just slow down and think about this how that the consolation is now it's not a consolation prize later in other words oh after this life is over that'll be a great consolation no i mean it just doesn't even fly with our we have a consolation prize or something like that it's for the guy who doesn't win like here's your participation trophy and that's that's not the way that this is the language is being used it means that ought to comfort us now that ought to perk us up now that ought to energize us now if that's what's coming then it ought to change the way things are now so he's not saying oh one day it'll feel good no he's saying right now it should because notice these i need to go a little bit more quickly now second corinthians chapter five verse one for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens that exists right now there is a body in an eternal realm that exists now so before you were ever born there was a representation of you in the eternals so it's not something that's going to come in existence later that in your most horrible state now even when you were lost and sinning and rejecting and worldly and ungodly even now through all your addictions and your uh battles and your frustrations there is a you that is existing now in god greater than this one greater than this reality in matthew chapter 18 verse 10 as he's talking about these little children and he says don't despise him he says that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven now and i know that i'm just making reference to this and not expounding upon the the conversation that's being had in matthew 18 but when he makes this statement their angels he is acknowledging and pointing out that we all have one so we can say your angel beholds the face of the father which is in heaven it's a celestial reality it is what we call using language of the message it's a theophany which is a manifestation of god the theophant it's a manifestation of god which you are connected to and just to make summary of it it's a body that you will enter into and receive after this body is dissolved or changed right do we believe that and that exists now it's eternal now and jesus is pointed out in john 14. paul has pointed out in second corinthians 5 jesus is making reference to it again in matthew 18. and we need to become more and more convinced of that reality and our position and our existence in it this is this is the victory ahead is victory now this is the real hope that we can have paul says in first corinthians 15 19 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable the lack of a future hope imposes upon us a present misery as christians and this is the language he says if we in in this life only have the hope of christ so those who are hoping in christ only have in this life then we of everybody on the face of the earth would be the most miserable so then if only having hope in christ in this life makes you the most miserable person on earth then what about the assurance of a life after this one what about an assurance of a hope after this life what about the assurance of a bright future it ought to make you the most ambitious person on earth that ought to make you the happiest creature on earth regardless of what you go through regardless of your circumstances if with no hope in christ after this life makes you the most miserable then a revelation of my hope in christ after this life makes me the mostest happiest what is this hope colossians 1 5 for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven where have you heard before in the word of truth of the gospel paul is saying your confidence is born from experiencing what heaven holds for you he says for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven which you heard before in the word of truth of the gospel your confident hope your expectation your feelings now and how you feel and your joy and your anticipation and the con the the content of your character and the nature of your your conduct is born from experiencing what heaven holds for you the things we experience in the supernatural is a foretaste of what's coming the baptism of the holy ghost which is the seal of god the new birth is a down payment and an evidence of the inheritance that you're going to receive it is a guarantee it is the earnest it is the earnest the full redemption so you have the opportunity to begin to taste the eternal and in taste and experiencing the eternal it gives us a confident listen hope says when you heard before the word of truth we ought to be so certain of this the word of truth is never merely data the word of truth is never merely information the word of truth is never just historical if it's referring to information if it refers to data if it refers to history and you're only catching it that way say god show me the more because it's never merely that it's inspirational it's instructive it's it's motivating it is living and eternal it is your joy victory ahead is victory now that means we're anchoring in something beyond the temporal something beyond the temporal is what i'm anchored to i'm tethered to matthew chapter 5 verses 11 and 12 this is just an example of how again the future is impacting the present blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake right you're blessed so really any if anybody ever asks us blessed blessed especially lately or something you can always if you're really going through it you can say even more so lately blessed are you when people revile you persecute you disrespect you mistreat you use you say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake and then he just doesn't stop there rejoice and be exceeding gladden he's actually saying leap for joy this is the believer's exercise regime and as the bride walks in this truth she can be more and more healthy and shed even more calories because she is going to constantly be leaping for joy with everything that's happening around her and to her rejoice and be exceeding glad the rejoicing it means it's so deep it actually motivates you physically to exuberance uh because of the persecution well for great is your reward in heaven and he says for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you there's two layers to you to it if you're suffering now realize that you're suffering in the same manner that the prophets have and that christ has he says remember they're going to hate you but remember they hated me before they hated you and that kind of gives us some assurance and and a way to rationalize with it and process and say well it hurts really really bad but jesus knows what it's like and they hate me but they also hated him and it kind of helps us with these discomforting emotions but he just doesn't leave it in the past he projects into the future and he says you're rejoicing your exuberance your leaping your joy is also connected to the reward that's awaiting you in heaven so regardless of what's passed regardless of what's present there's something in the future that radiates back upon me now and i can live in the brightness of a future glory today rejoice and be a seed and gladden that's exactly because great is your reward in light of the hatred persecution reviling evil speaking lies but because of a great reward ahead in heaven it changes the way i live right now so looking under jesus causes us to be forward looking considering him we actually look back to him as an example so we can look back considering him and then as we look to looking back to him considering his example we realized that he was forward-looking so in considering him and looking at it's not that we're just always looking back but we're looking at these different aspects in christ and we can be forward looking in john chapter 8 verse 56 notice it happened with abraham your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it it says he rejoiced to see it means he gushed with excited desire abraham gushed with the excited desire to see christ's day and he saw it and was glad so you notice how this works you get excited about it and then he shows it to you and then once he shows it to you it's not a future joy it's a present joy abraham rejoiced to see christ's day god showed it to him and he saw it and was glad he saw it by revelation and was joyful he saw it prefigured he saw it in type and when abraham was so excited to see it god showed it to him so his excitement brought him to an experience to of a revelation of it and the revelation of it brought him joy then it wasn't yeah well one day one day when it's all over yeah but oh immediately it's like hey whoa yes yes i was under anticipation i was expecting it i was hopeful i was the rash with this expectation and i was longing to sit and then god shows it and the revelation brings the joy in first peter chapter 1 verses 19 to 21 because considering him looking to him looking at his example notice how the scripture speaks of christ and how we ought to interact with the revelation of it but we have been purchased by but with the precious blood of christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world so the lamb was for ordained the lamb as a sacrifice the shedding of the blood of christ his shedding of the blood his his role and perpetuation as a sacrifice was for ordained notice before time but was manifest in these last times for you so it's maybe a paradox for ordained before time but the actual crucifying and sacrifice just took place before your eyes who by him do believe who by him do believe in god and so we believe by christ in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory christ raised up his son from the dead gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god so really to me all these elements in this are so important that christ shed his blood for our sins and that we by believing we believe that god raised him from the dead and god gave him glory and that by our faith these things happen so that our faith is not only in god but our hope is in god so we have this we have faith in god but now we have this expectation joyful expectation anticipation positive expectation not the enemy of faith but a hope in god that is rooted in a truth that is birthed from faith that you might have faith in god and hope in god based upon the fact that god ordained him before the foundation of the world that it happened and now he's seated he's given him glory raised him from the dead and gave him glory now in romans chapter 8 verse 28 all things work together for the good right to then love god and are called according to his purpose and this is this is connected with how do i conduct myself with joy by believing or how do i prove my loved one believe what he said conduct myself with joy and as it continues all that were foreknown are predestinated right so if you're for known uh you're predestined if you're elect you're predestinated and then you're brought to glory if you read those verses even to verse 30 it might be if you read in there it's showing foreknowledge predestination ultimate destination ultimate glory it's all connected together and it can't break there's a there is a truth to confess justification confession of sanctification but we can take it and kind of misalign it to think that you can actually be justified and then be lost now think about it i i'm not going to have to sit down and explain it to you right and yeah i mean because we'll just chew on it for a little bit lord will bring us maybe to another a greater teaching on it or more teaching on it if you are justified the bible says you he you're justified he that he has justified he is glorified right so if you've been justified you're already glorified if there's not a glorified representation you cannot truly be justified now you can be under the confession of justification you can have the confession of faith you can potentially be confessing that you believe and potentially seem to be under as judas was a justification but if you are truly justified you're already glorified because that's scripture then if you are sanctified the bible says he have perfected forever them that are sanctified so the believer having been sanctified is already perfected i say it to say this that as the elect you are on a different path than those who can appear to be justified and appear to be sanctified and still reject truth and be lost that cannot happen to the elect of god it is impossible and so for knowledge election and predestination all work together not independently you can't be elect and then not be predestinated so foreign knowledge election and predestination all working together in christ as we see in christ ordained before the foundational world and in you jesus said in john 17 24 father i will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory so that he's praying for you that you may be with him where he is so you see this continuity that as he is in this world so are we that where i am there you may be also this is his prayer and he says that they may behold my glory we need to get the glory which thou hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world so christ was ordained before the foundation of the world and he is going to be given glory because the god loved him before the foundation of the world that's christ notice how paul says in ephesians 1 4. i i know i'm going very quickly over this because i only want just to point out the forward-looking aspect and these points in eternity where things are being said about you about christ and you i want you just to kind of look at look at the big this big picture so there's a lot more time that should be spent on these but i just wanted to point to them very quickly according he had chosen us in him so god loved the son before the foundation of the world and we were chosen in christ before the foundational world so we were chosen in love in love having predestinated us that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated which was the next one so we have been that we have been called then chosen us in christ before the foundational world with the destiny that we might be holding without blame because in love we have been predestinated are we not taught in ephesians that we are right now presently seated in heavenly places in christ jesus doesn't look heavenly looks like a courtyard by marriott to me looks like the generic convention hall carpet i look around but i'm seated right now in heavenly places already raised up already passed from death and to life that's a reality and i if i could just say this really the uh what we ought to be striving for every day is a greater understanding of that reality let me live in that reality let me be subject to that reality let me submit myself to that reality lord it's real it's real it's real it's real i believe it that's the that's the energy for the fruits of the spirit so in eternity before there was ever time god chose you in eternity before there was time god loved the son chose you in him before there was time he slewed the lamb and then destined you to be perfect forever or destined you to a perfect forever however you want to look at it so god does this the term that's used is foreknowledge elect according to the foreknowledge of god the bible says that's god's awareness of a thing before it happens or before it's manifested as peter said who verily was ordained before the foundation of the world that's for knowledge but was manifest in these last times god foreknew purpose formed the intent i hope this isn't getting i'm going to be getting too technical here i was explaining um i was trying to explain to sister elizabeth this morning quantum mechanics quantum superposition and schrodinger's cat i wouldn't even get into schrodinger's equation and she said honey you're not going to talk about that this morning in service are you and no no not this morning but if i get past noon i was like no i'm not going to do it um but there's an interesting some interesting things to talk about if you what are you what are you guys doing for lunch i want to hijack the open house but we can maybe talk about quantum superposition between three and five today but now there's a moment where how do i get into that oh yo i'm not i'm not going to be too technical but god there's a time when it's thought of in eternity it's in eternity and it manifest in time but it was eternal before it manifests here and so foreign knowledge of god is this awareness that something's going to happen it's a knowledge of something before it exists and so god's foreign knowledge about the future this is the part the part i had to skip over last time i left out last time god's foreknowledge about the future dictated a provision in eternity why did he slay the lamb it had to be slain as a sacrifice why did you need sacrifice for someone's sins so this is god in being proactive this is god in eternity god in his mind and i realize there's a paradox to it and there's a way that it's very difficult maybe to resolve these things but god's foreknowledge about your future condition and god's foreknowledge about what will be dictated that he had to in eternity form the attempt and actually slay the lamb before the foundation of the world so in terms of time things that would be necessitated that god act or purpose before time begin so in revelations chapter 13 verse 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him and this is not a good worship that we're to worship this antichrist whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world now peter has said that the lamb was for ordained before the foundation of the world so the sacrifice was for ordained god formed the intent before the foundation of the world now the language that's used here in revelation calls him a lamb slain before the foundation of the world why based on what would later be in time why was he slain he wouldn't have been slain if there wouldn't have been a need for the slain in time so we realized now in the eternities god's purposing something beforehand before you even come he's already made a decision beforehand and so it's the lamb slain before the foundation of the world romans 5 2 by this lamb by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god so christ becomes the source of our hope we rejoice in the hope of the glory of god we rejoice now we're joyful we're happy now in the glory of god because through this sacrifice we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand it's your standing in christ not your present circumstances all because of this lamb that's slain before the foundation of the world but then there's a way that it's written whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world so then there's names that are written in the lamb's book of life based upon the foreknowledge of god according to the future so no matter how you look at it whether it's the names or the lamb god by foreknowledge has written your name down in a record that can't be blotted out and has caused the sacrifice that would cover those names so they couldn't be blotted out so it's permanent and that's already settled and decided before there's one creation so that when things happen now in in earth just as jesus said i'm telling you these things beforehand so that in me you might have peace so that when they take place you'll take great comfort and no one already warned you ahead of time so we could take the same thing and realize god is making these provisions and doing these things well before time and now here i am in time and i'm considering him and i'm looking to jesus and i'm realizing there's something eternal that's higher that's greater that's more real than anything that happens in bc or a.d and listen to what jesus says in luke 10 20 as they all came back from a revival from a camp meeting and everything was really excitable and everything was everybody was really really happy because demons were cast out he says notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you in other words what's your real joy what's your real rejoicing what are you anchored in but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven the source of your joy is not whether or not you lay hands on the sick and they recover the source of your joy is not whether or not you get the experience the dead being raised the source of your joy is not in casting out devils and working many modern mighty wonderful works the source of your joy and your rejoicing is in that your name is written in heaven the source of your joy is in his election and his predestination brother of adam uses the phrase it's scoff it's in your scofield bibles where he takes it election looks back to foreign knowledge predestination forward to the destiny and they're tied together election looks back to foreign so our current state of being elect is the outcome of god electing a pr of god's foreknowledge and then he by the same foreign knowledge he's now and this is the practical outworking of the foreign knowledge not just election but then election works to reaching our ultimate destiny brother ram says an adoption i'm gonna i'm gonna uh turn it up to one point one and a half speed now he says god before the foundation of the world elected that the cocklebur is to become a grain of wheat that's you by election now i know i'm a grain of wheat because i'm saved how do i do it look back and see what he predestined long time ago by foreknowledge he seemed that i would love him so he made a perpetuation through his own son that through him i might become from a cocklebur to a grain of wheat now don't take that statement to mean that somehow you forced god's hands his election is independent you didn't make yourself saved you didn't make god save you it's his choice brother donnie reagan shared it with me one time fellowshipping on this subject and just to me it was like the final nail in in the in the in the coffin of your works having anything to do with your election he said adam was placed on the basis of free moral agency but he had no choice to be a son you are his son by his choice you're his daughter by his choice by foreknowledge he saw that you you would love him so he made a way for you so that through him i might become from a cocklebury to a grain of weed now where am i at now i'm saved i'm walking in the grace of god what does predestination look to destiny where will he take me to where am i going that's got you there you are so it's that it's what has been his election i'm anchored and tied to my foundation his is his election but my destiny is his predestination his calling in my future and this is what determines how i ought to conduct myself is what is coming because he's changed my nature now luke chapter 11 verses 11 to 13. he says if a natural son would ask his father for bread will he get a stone if he asks for a fish will give him a snake if he asks for a leg excuse me not a leg but an egg would he offer him a scorpion might feel like an arm and a leg when he asked for 20 bucks but if he shall ask for an egg he offers him a scorpion and basically he's saying no if you ask your dad for bread he'll give you bread if you ask for a fish he'll give you fish if you ask for an egg he'll give you an egg he says and then if you being evil or even formed from evil in the products of a sinful birth know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him i want to quickly just focus you on this he's dealing with expectation and hopes about the future based upon relationship he's saying a son should not expect a scorpion from his dad if he asked him for an egg saying that a son should not expect a stone from his dad if he asked his dad for bread right so he's talking about what what state of apprehension or anticipation should a child be in when you ask a parent for something good he said if a natural parent knows how to give good things to his children that asks how much more shall your heavenly father so then how much more should we be in a state of anticipation rather apprehension since he's dealing about our concurrent condition of whether we be dreadful apprehension or excitable anticipation how much more are we to conduct ourselves with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass based upon the fact that he loves us oh how he loves us and that's what i'm basing it on that he loves me and it's base and he's trying to use this analogy of an a of a father's love so in things that are to be he says look at how your earthly parent before you come here before they knowed you was coming made ready for your coming i hope that you could just catch this beautiful picture your parents made ready for your coming just think of that now your earthly parents so now god which an earthly parent is only a type of a heavenly parent so now look at our relationship to god and what our expectations ought to be and what is he doing and what is he forming and what is he taking care of if we know how to give good gifts to our children how much more does your heavenly father know how to give good gifts to his children jesus spoke these words they made ready your coming so when your earthly parents when the mother was pregnant the father and mother made ready for the child that was coming now notice the child's not there yet but he says they made a little crib or got some little booties or little clothes or so forth they made ready everything for you to arrive prepared before you ever even come on the earth so even before you get there things are coming to the manifestation things are coming out why because the parent's preparation is based upon their expectation of what will be so they have baby showers they paint the nursery they they they buy diapers or don't buy diapers they they get car seats they they get clothes what they're all doing this in anticipation of the arrival but catch this none of that would be sane if they didn't know a baby was coming like none of that it wouldn't make sense and we're just thinking rationally according to human thought all that behavior all that activity all that effort all that energy all these things the painting the construction the crib the booties the diapers the baby showers all these things it's all done in light of what is coming they only exist then think about the things that exist they don't exist for the parents right they exist for the baby the crib isn't for the dad who's like i'm never going to catch up on sleep and crawl into the crib the diapers aren't for the the parents the the booties all those things these are for the babies and each one of those things that come into manifestation before the baby ever arrives is related directly to something the baby's gonna need for its reality it comes into existence because of the future it comes into existence now because the need is soon going to arrive whoa amen go ahead and think spiritual we're not talking about baby showers now we're talking about a heavenly father that knows there's something coming and will bring things into manifestation now and we'll give you things now as a heavenly father now knowing that you need it now in order to be who you will be there that's what a heavenly parent an earthly parent will do so that he continues on the subject this is what really brings it home in paragraph 67 notice how the expecting mother on earth today how the mother's body craves for certain things i'm speaking i guess i hope to all adults that'll understand the mother and the birth of the baby if there's something lacking in her body she begins to crave certain things i remember we raised such a poor family we didn't have hardly anything to eat when we were kids many of you suffered the same thing so how that when the before the babies would be born mother would crave something now brother branham is using this understanding that a mother's craving is related to the need of a baby right he's using this understanding to make a greater point so we're not trying to make the scientific point that a mother wanting pickles and peanut butter uh is related to the baby needing something in the pickles and peanut butter this is something that relates to a mother's cravings and what she eats and what she ingests and how she's driven to do certain things is related to something else he says before the baby would be born mother would crave something and dad would just pinch corners and everything in his poverty to get it for it's her the body her body the calcium and so forth of her body the nutrients the vitamins that she needs so all these things he says juni is being made up and he craves for things foods for the coming child so the mother's craving but the cravings are what because there's a body being formed on the inside of the mother and how parents they try to get so the baby will be born as perfectly and happy as possible this is what natural parents do wouldn't your heavenly father be doing the same thing now think about it see how your parents will do that when there's something needed the mother gives witness of it her system is made up now the baby's not here yet but that baby needs something so her system's made up toward now while in incubation while in the womb she's going to pour in nutrients into that baby that it needs he says you understand that's how that when there's something needed here to the oncoming child the mother begins to crave for that the child's not here yet but it needs it now now so the expecting parents now just try to with a few moments that we have remaining in this morning just try to really let this break open into you and have a revelation of this what he's trying to make say the expecting parents are experiencing a transformation even before the baby arrives just as the father and mother went out and bought a crib why because the baby's going to be sleeping in that crib why did they paint the nursery blue because they think they're having a boy right why do they buy diapers because babies need diapers these things are being done because the baby needs it now he uses it in this way the mother's cravings during pregnancy are not for her solely for her benefit it's not just to get her through the trimester not just to get her through the day and to knock away some cravings but she's actually eating now based upon a need that the baby has and it's calling for and it's not just to make the baby's womb experience uh a peaceful or stop it from kicking or moving around but it's actually for the proper development of the baby so that it can come into a perfect delivery it's done based upon the child's future so the preparation in the womb is for the reality that awaits the newborn why do they why is there going to be these different things why is there booties because that baby is going to have feet why is there diapers because the baby's going to have a little bottom why do you have all these things because there's going to be a body that's going to need those things hallelujah there's going to be eyes there's going to be hands there's going to be feet there's going to be a body that lays in that crib there's going to be a body that wears that onesie there's going to be a body that wears those diapers there's going to be a body that eats that baby food and the mother's preparation in the womb is developing the baby for reality outside of it and the hope of the expecting father and the excitement of an expecting mother changes the course of their entire lives changes their conduct i i welcome the sisters to give a hearty amen if this is true i i i think maybe to a sister it's even more pronounced and would be a greater type to what i'm trying to describe but a mother loves her baby long before she sees it right right mothers can we all say man mothers amen you love that thing before you ever see it before it ever cries you have deep empathy for it before it ever takes a breath you do anything to protect it you love it before you ever even see it and it's unexplainable it's hard for you to explain it unless somebody else knows this feeling right mothers because you've never seen it but you feel it you know it's there you know it's real right and it's just pushing out and everyone else knows they're under expectation they're under anticipation it's a reality deep inside you that you can't deny and so you love it even before it cries or wails even before you hold it you love it and you promise that you'll keep it to never let any harm come to it this is what brother branham is pointing to to understand god and ourselves he said that god as a heavenly parent now notice how things come into manifestation now before the baby ever arrives and there's things that the baby's receiving while in the womb getting ready to be delivered so that it can have what it needs when it arrives you don't think god's pouring stuff into you now we're not waiting for it one day we're getting it now the translation transpires when you're finally fully made up and ready to be there we're not going to be broken imperfect people that in a moment in a twinkling of an eye are changed to become perfectly whole and joyful no right now the fruits of the spirit are mending healing strengthening encouraging raising us up we're walking it now one day we're going to take that joyful last step into eternity why he's pouring into us now what we need for a perfect delivery into a new body brother braham said i believe that heaven is a place just as real as this we don't set up there to eternity just sit there on a cloud we don't just strum our harp for all here forever or from here forever but we're going to a real place and we're going to do things you got a to-do list in heaven we're going to do things activities yes we're going to live we're going to work we're going to enjoy we're going to live don't get too worried we're going to work think about it what he's beginning to describe has some sound about what's happening now we're going to live we're going to work we're going to enjoy we're going to live we're going to life to a real eternal life we're going to a heaven a paradise what am i doing here well i think i'm living i'm think i'm working i'm supposed to be enjoying and one day i'll be there i'll be living i'll be working i'll be enjoying if that's what's coming to let that be now let me live now let me work now let me enjoy now if that's coming let me have it now because remember the influence the future ought to have on you now so brother abraham describes it paragraph 59 but oh my and the kingdom of god there is no death there is no sorrow there's no need of those things these things of the world he says but we've passed from this thing into the realities of god where we struggle so far hard to find through science the more scientific we get the more death we bring ourselves we're fighting and losing battle there so turn loose of it turn loose of the natural and get a hold of the supernatural turn loose of the things that are and get a hold of the things that are to be by faith believe jesus christ is the son of god tonight and accept him he is the one a few paragraphs later he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists if that's what exists then then i have a right to claim it now right how can you have healing now because there's a well body there he's gone to prepare a place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there so when will your perfection come it's right now it's a perfect place calling to a perfect you and it ought to be bringing out the perfect you now why because you need it now just as a baby in the womb needs it then the mother begins to crave for it god knows you need it so he begins to send it the body begins to crave it people begin to crave it they begin to call for why they need it and god begins to send it what before the development of you now so that who you are at the time when you're fully developed and ready the baby will come when it's ready right it comes into another reality and brother is using that as a type to get us to understand the things that are to be and the life that is before us and that there's a perfect reality calling us out of this reality into that reality but we're developing into that perfection now he talked about how in the delivery of a child how that you watch that mother she could be just as ornery as she can be but just before she comes to deliver a sweetness comes over her why it's because the baby's coming you tell me how that that chain changes things so he says this and things that are to be this is my last statement from that message oh little children do you feel the need of that vitamin tonight that's something because now notice how he's placing it not we're just not sitting sitting there here twiddling our thumbs waiting for a change he says there's a body waiting yonder there's a body waiting to be received people don't be deceived don't be deceived the devil is a deceiver even the wedding garment you must wear it it must be and so i it would imp i emphasize this the devil's trying to keep you from this truth trying to hide this we're at the evening time the earthly body is now ready to be dissolved and we are preparing can i say now to enter into the heavenly and we now feel the strange call of god to go to this great eden you may not be able to have explained it you may not even be able to understand what it is but your love of this truth your desire to be in church your desire to serve your desire for joy your desire for healing your desire to follow god your desire for your loved ones is not just merely a desire to be in the message but it's a desire for changing your body it's a strong craving to be translated it's a strong craving to be liberated from this flesh strange call of god to go to this great eden and before we could be born here notice our little bodies cried for something that had to be provided or we'd be afflicted an afflicted child here if we wasn't so if the body the baby didn't get what it needed in the womb it's not going to be the baby it needs to be when it comes into this other reality you following me i can start over maybe for your own sake just start amen and real loud when you talk to somebody and that you don't understand each other's language you just smile and not right yes yes i don't mind if you told my car right you just smile and nod if the baby doesn't get what it needs here it won't be perfect there so it gets what it needs in the womb from a parent that cares to be perfect before it gets there so it's perfect when it gets there and that's what brother brahm's trying to say now there's a perfect you there and god's gonna give you what you need now to be perfect when you get there you crave it you long for it he says there's something that had to be provided or we'd be an afflicted child here if he wasn't so it must be provided now he says god has no afflictions up there so let's think about it if god has no afflictions up there then i've got to get what i need for my afflictions here if there's no afflictions there then i'm not waiting for my healing when i get there i want to claim it now i'm not waiting for my joy when i get there i want it now i'm not waiting for a sound mind beyond the curtain of time i want it now that's what i wanted now otherwise i'd be an afflicted person when i get there oh god heal my hurts heal my pains heal my disappointments now do it now lord because god has no afflictions up there there everyone perfectly lined up the bride just exactly like the groom was the word manifested in its season god grant tonight children each and every one of you granted maybe it made this bride may she be lined up may she be walking in it he said there's a heaven to go to there's a hell to stay away from and then if you listen to the sermon or read he tells about going beyond the curtain of time do you remember the vision he had going up beyond the curtain of time and in it and i i've lost i've i i've used up all my time i'm actually in overtime now what are the new overtime rules now in the pandemic i'm starting on second base how's that i'm closer to home than i would have been prior to the pandemic so i'll close sooner than i would have pre coven help me get home drive me in somebody hit a home run brother branham is laying in bed hands behind his head and he experiences this translation and he's in a condition here and can look back and see himself there see the old man his present circumstances his body his weakness everything there but he's in a different state here and and he tells the story going beyond the curtain of time and instead of maybe embellishing all the thing or expressing all the things that he says in it let me just share the phrase that comes right before god shows him this brother brahm's laying there the voice speaks to him says just keep pressing on if you only knew what it was at the end of the road just keep pressing on so grateful god gave this experience to our prophet just keep pressing on if you only knew what is at the end of the road and what does god let him see it's at the end of the road and when he gets there when he's hugging all these different people he's experiencing this and he says it's beyond sublime it's the most sublime thing ever and he's described as beyond perfection beyond perfection beyond perfection and this is what the voice says to him this is what you preached was the holy ghost think about it that's what you have now by the new birth he says this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it now let's invert he's not trying to tell you you won't be there he's trying to tell you you're guaranteed to get there right this is your invitation it's not oh oh perfect love i don't have that no he's saying no you've that's what you have actually and the devil's trying to deceive you and make you think you don't have it so that when you struggle with contrary emotions oh i just need perfect love no you just need to kind of wake it up say i don't need to hate i don't need to be bitter i don't need to lie i don't need to cheat i don't need to worry i don't need a friend i got perfect love perfect love cast out fear that's what this love is for that's what this holy ghost is for that's what this love divine is for it's for these distressing emotions it's for times like this times like this don't prove i don't got it it's times like this when what i got can prove itself don't think for a moment your hard times are proof but in the hard times let what you have prove itself just keep pressing on if you only knew what was at the end of the road and he says this is what you preached was perfect love that's what you have that's why perfect love cast out fear because fear has torment it has to completely cast it out he said once they had made it there there was none of that no distressing emotion no lust nothing impure that was when perfect love was unrestrained and brother brown this is how brother branham wrote it and took from rejected king and he wrote it in the full gospel businesses voice and he says at the this and this is i want to end with this here the man says i said oh god help me i i know it's very late it's 11 56 according to my my my clock i i just can we just wake ourselves up for a moment we can start from the front to the back just kind of shake ourselves pinch yourself wake up here wake up the neighbor in the apartment next door just try to use whatever little bit of energy you have left to focus on this and listen to how he says this because this applies to us we've got to see this we've got to catch this he says oh god help me never let me compromise with the word let me stay straight on the word i don't care what anyone else does lord let me press on to that beautiful joyful place i'm more convinced i don't have it on the slide because i just wanted you to focus in your mind's eye and in your heart just listen let it let it strike you deep within your soul i am more convinced than ever in my life that it'll take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only supreme beauty and joy if that's what your body needs when it's going to get there then god your heavenly father knows now that he can get rid of jealousy he can get rid of tiredness he can get rid of sickness he can stop the advancement of old age and one day he will destroy death only supreme beauty and joy i'm going to be supremely beautiful there whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where now this is this is instead of looking at as well i got to get rid of these things before i have perfect love no this is what perfect love can do for you get to where you can love everybody even every enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or the guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love that's the place we ought to come to where we can love even our enemies and people who hate us and mock us and lie about us and offend us and hurt us we can get to that place that we love our enemies and we love those that hurt us and why why can you do that because you know what's at the end of the road because you're i know i'm his daughter i know i'm his son i know there's a throne of waiting for me how can i hate anybody if i know one day i'll be their judge how can i despise what god's what god allows to happen why would i let myself under the power of an accuser live under the power of an abuser i can forgive i can go forward i can live above it because i know at the end of the road i'm healed i'm delivered i'm pure i'm clean i'm saved i'm healed he says if you're not saved except jesus christ as your savior now if you're not baptized in water be baptized now if you've not received the baptism holy spirit receive it now press on in that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time see pressing into that perfect love isn't what we do to get there it's what we do before we're there if not the perfect love can enter there it's not something you're given at the door it's something you receive it's part of the invitation it's part of the earnest is part of the down payment so with our hearts just open now i want to i want to be able just to seal this thought in my heart so i could take liberty into the next step if we could just bow our heads and close our eyes i feel impressed to tell you to step out of the shadows of broken dreams to break the cycle to stop living in fear of it there's a voice calling beyond the clouds there's a tug can you feel it keep pressing towards this joy because it's worth it as abraham rejoiced to see and he was gushing with excitement and god showed him i believe that we can rejoice to see and he will show you by little and little he'll keep showing you piece by piece as you have need of it he'll keep showing you and as a heavenly father that knows there's a body waiting for you and that is brother has drawn the image and things that are to be that we're going to be delivered out of this pest house into a new body he's given you everything you need now to not be afflicted there it's things that are to be changing the way things are now i believe that we can see what god wants us to see behind the beyond the curtain of time do you believe that i have not seen nor heard neither is into the heart of men the things that god hath prepared for them that love him but he reveals them to us by his spirit and i believe we can ask god to show us what's at the end of the road he said just keep pressing on if you only knew it was at the end of the road i believe we can ask god to show us by little and little what's coming brother branham after he had experienced that he says it in different places but i just grabbed a couple where he makes it very very plain it's changed me i can never be the same anymore it's so real it's just as real as i'm looking at you just that reel so there's no fear so think of that think of that in light of what uh of what is expressed in these other statements that he's made to this point in things that are to be that it's more real there's no fear because it's real i know it's real i can never be the same no more the reality changed who he was before he comes to it he says another place the one visit there to me has made me a different man i can never never never be the same brother branham that i was i said well brother aaron does that mean i have to have a vision beyond the curtain of time no we're not prophets we don't get those kind of visions but you as a son or daughter of god he can give you a revelation and the revelation that you need to change you in your present circumstance and i believe that right now whatever you have need of you could just let it lift up within your heart and let your heart christ say lord give me the revelation i need for right now even if it's just for the next 24 hours lord give me what i need right now to conduct myself with joy and miss this trial you've allowed to come to pass let me get by minute by minute if i need to lord but i need something for now i worry too much about the future i'm burning bridges before i come to them i'm obsessing about this and i'm worried about that and i've got this plans and those plans and i'm all worried about what the future is going to be like am i going to get married can i ever afford to buy a house will i get good grades in school what about this being restored that we're all so worried about the future and we can't even live happy in the present tense oh god give me what i need right now to walk to walk free even if it's just you showing me where i am in eternity if that's all it will take to change me god show me let me be convinced of it let me know beyond a shadow of a doubt that i'm coming to it and i can't miss it bless you today bless you whose hearts are bowed and heads are bout and hands are raised god let me be convinced more than ever that it's already done i need to have this kind of confidence and assurance that you love me and loving me you have what's best for me and knowing that you've chosen me beforehand that your love is elective therefore if it's victory ahead it's victory now if i'm gonna be happy and shout and rejoice and dance on those streets and i might as well cut a rug while i'm here if i'm gonna praise and shout over there i might as well start doing it now brother lucas was sharing with me how even science has tapped into the fact that if you act happy you get happy because it's an immutable truth of god's word the body's got to obey that your confession and activity and being active and doing and stepping out and being positive in those things it's not mind over matter it's you minding the things that really matter and setting your mind on the things that really matter and say god i don't know what's going to happen now persecution affliction rejection lost dreams and hopes that are dashed and things that may not i work out the way i wanted to but i'm looking over it to a joy which is set before me and you told me to rejoice and leap for joy and be exceeding god because my name is written in the lamb's book of life because i have a great reward waiting for me in heaven lord let that reality raise and raise and raise in my heart god bless you if there's a with the heads are bowed now if there'd be a broken heart or someone in a difficult situation that would want to stand up as just even activity of saying i'm leaving that which is behind behind by standing up i'm raising myself up into these heavenly places i'm taking my position in christ i'm looking to jesus i'm considering him and i'm saying lord i'm tied to something greater than my flesh i'm tied to something greater than my memories i'm tied to something greater than my affections oh god i stand in your presence now as a testimony that i'm healed that i'm saved and i'm delivered god bless you all god bless you could we stand together with these all of us together now stand let us pray our gracious heavenly father lord your presence is so wonderful it is so beautiful lord to feel you here speaking to our hearts with such clarity lord i pray that through the the breadth of this and the length of him that you have been present near your children lord expressing to them what you would have them to hear lord one day a little boy showed up at a large gathering with two fish and five loaves of bread and he was gonna eat that for himself maybe little lunch that a mother cooked packed for her son and little did she know that she cooked for over five thousand that day but it was you that broke it up and what was meant for one was meant for all i pray lord you take these things that have been broken up and these things have been spread out and dispersed and made every single person here today receive substance from you now lord wherever they may be in this journey whatever they may be going through lord lighten their load relieve their anxious mind free their burdened hearts lord i speak to whoever would hear this may they find that tomorrow morning is lighter than mondays usually are a little bit more ambition less less of a darkness lord more motivation to get the day started and get the job done but i'm praying that for all who would hear all that are here under uh under anxiety and apprehension or they'd be loosed and freed and delivered lord surely above all we would desire that people would come to know you in the forgiveness of sins and and the baptism of the holy ghost or that's that's what we present before you but may we who might not even know you in that way first begin to experience you in deliverance and healing and joy and know that you're real give us a taste lord of the divine give us a taste of something supernatural i'm praying father for the people to bless them today encourage them to believe that when your son said it is finished he didn't just do it for me he did it as me and i could say it's finished it's finished it's finished for me the victory is mine bless your people i pray in jesus name amen
