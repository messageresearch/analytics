TRANSCRIPT
========================================
luke chapter 2 i'm going to be reading verses 1 to 14 and i am excited about some of the things i've been studying the way the lord's dealt with my heart we've had several requests for more parts on abraham i'm sure we'll have opportunity to minister on him as we continue to minister the gospel it's hard to avoid abraham as you preach the word of god but i've been studying some things the lord's been doing with my heart and it's december 1st it's after thanksgiving this is when some people can finally start to think about christmas even though they push it on us right around halloween time but i want to speak on a number of different subjects during the month of december and maybe we could call it a series of sermons deriving some inspiration from the events of the birth of christ uh so you could call it a christmas christmas series and i'll give you my title here in a little bit uh but i wanted just to give you that uh give you that at the outset and begin reading in luke chapter 2 verses 1 to 14 and there's a wonderful atmosphere here tonight so i just feel very comfortable and it came to pass in those days he's going to be reading luke chapter 2 verses 1 to 14. and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out to of the city of nazareth and into judea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel lord came upon them and the glory the lord shone round about them and they were so afraid the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord there shall be a sign unto you you shall see you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with an a with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising god and saying glory to god in the highest on earth peace good will toward men god bless you can be seated as i mentioned i'm wanting to uh if god would lead us and i want to be very very strict uh to find his leading uh there's maybe a lot of things in the word of god that you could give a speech on or that you could print out statements on or just do a word search and print out a number of scriptures but that would not match the need that you have in your life the spiritual need because only the anointing and only what is inspired in a season is what's going to feed your soul and so i don't want to just because it's december and we're heading towards a christmas celebration that we just speak on a subject i've never actually ministered on a series of services on christmas and i don't often just grab things that might seem to be relevant because of the season but god's impressed some things on me and i want to speak on the subject and then acknowledge just even at the outset that the subject of christmas and you could just be free to amend this if you agree and it won't disclose which side you might be on but christmas can be a controversial subject isn't that right and it's amazing that it can be but my goal in speaking on christmas is to lift up christ and to lift up the true meaning and to identify the true spirit of christmas so i'm not angling into taking a stand in the areas that might be controversial but just really identifying that as christians there's something that we can emphasize and something that's very real about the birth of christ and those are the things that we would like to do is to lift up christ in these things that we would minister and in the sermon the deity of jesus christ brother branham preaches this it's the first sermon that we have recorded in which he preaches on christmas day and i believe i have it there on the slide in the deity of jesus christ it says as it was in the days of noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man noah had some faithful ones in that day god god's got some faithful ones today and i just love this how he approaches this and i wanted to use this as a foundational statement the hour is coming this great drama setting men and women if the holy ghost is dwelling in you the christ that was born 1900 years ago came to manhood he never stayed in the cradle so you could already begin to recognize maybe a theme here and even recognize the the danger of some of the emphasis that we could put on christmas if we keep him in a manger you just keep him in a stable and so he's identifying that christ was born born in a manger as the scripture says but there was a trajectory a progression an evolution in his life where he came to manhood and i love that statement he never stayed in the cradle and he's expressing this to those who have the holy ghost so if we have the holiness we can't stay in a cradle we've got to grow to manhood and he says and today this is where he kind of begins to focus on the event of christmas and today that memorial of his birthday so this day the date he's preaching if you could see it on the opposite the other the first slide i think i even put it in our traditional uh christmas colors you can see preach this on christmas day and so he's thinking of this time the memorial of his birthday what did they do they get some tree cut it down make a christmas tree for the kitties he says that's all right i'm not kicking against that but the thing of it is they put more on the christmas tree than they do for christ kris kringle's all over the country who was he a german a catholic saint years ago an old man went about doing good and today it's become almost a worship so we can see he's he's bringing in a lot of different elements it's the memorial of christ's birthday but people cut down a tree and they give the preeminence to the tree they give preeminence to kris kringle and the um the teaching of christ's birth is kind of losing losing focus so he says it's become almost a worship that's right it's all right to tell the kitties or whatever you want to do as far as i'm concerned way i take that is he saying hey if you want to tell your kids about a kris kringle you want to you want to have a christmas trees he says i'm not kicking against that he said whatever you want to do as far as i'm concerned but he this is the emphasis but the real thing of it is it's so easy to fall in that rut on the other side and push christ and push out christ the real fundamentals of christmas notice he's identifying this rut on the other side so i would say if he's saying there's a rut on one side there's a rut on the other and there's these two different areas that you can fall into and he says and make and man take kris kringle instead of real christmas that's right no room for him in the end so just as it was in the time of his literal birth and whatever time of year that would have been we don't believe it was in the winter time we don't believe that it was on december 25th but as it would be in the springtime when rams are born and lambs are born that there was no room for him at the end and then once again here in the end time in the last days as mankind and his traditions and his theology has accumulated he says they put more emphasis on kris kringle or santa claus as we might call him instead of real christmas that there's a real truth to christmas and what christmas ought to be identifying he says they fall in on the other side and push out christ and he uses this phrase the real fundamentals of christmas so there are fundamentals of christmas he's identifying this as a on this christmas day in 1949 he identifies fundamentals of christmas and that would mean the the primary or something that's primary to christmas or original to christmas uh pertaining to the foundation of christmas if it's the fundamentals it's the primary principles or rules as it relates to christmas and and this is this is something that we ought to catch on there are fundamentals of christmas and that he's wanting to point to these primary foundational things as it relates to christmas time and there are many truths and i pondered this even this afternoon i started as i was pondering this i wanted to make this statement there's many truths uh pertaining to the birth of christ that are worth lifting up and you're like duh but i really just think there's even some things that are more uh really deep very rich there's types and shadows in the birth of christ there's many truths about him being born as a baby and the circumstances of his birth and all the many different prophecies that are fulfilled that are worth emphasizing that are worth lifting up and we could emphasize them on july 4th we could emphasize them uh in the month of may we could do it in september you could really do it any time and if you take time to do it in this season it's not inappropriate to ponder and think about what was happening when this babe was born i think it's a good thing to do so there's many uh principles and shadows there's even really beautiful types in the birth of christ even the elements of these things that we read about and joseph and mary and the taxation and the city of bethlehem and there's no room at the end he's lying in a mange and wrapped in swaddling clothes there's a lot of rich truths pertaining to these things and just think of the different prophecies that are fulfilled when he comes as a baby they're born in bethlehem and so there's meaning behind these prophecies there's meanings in these events but i want to just ask this question just for you to ponder it and i am going to answer it generally before we go into a more foundational subject before we enter into even what our title is but why why has christmas become so controversial it's important it's it's interesting to think about it just how controversial it has become because to be anti-christmas is just not it's not just an atheist sentiment right and maybe this is new for some of us it's not just the atheists that rail against christmas and hate christmas and despise christmas uh there there's there's another side to it that's more of a religious fervor and and more of an indignation uh that would be more uh religious uh not atheistic but those who would uh would not like it and would be against it so it's controversial not just because they're trying to take christ out of christmas and they want to take away uh and you shouldn't say merry christmas you should say happy holidays it's it's not even that anymore there's actually those that even believe very fervently in christ but would be anti-christmas and anti-christmas sentiment and so the con the christmas christmas is it's very easy to say this way christmas is controversial due to its truth because of what it stands for it's controversial you say it's certainly controversial to the atheist or the agnostic who denies that there is a god or does not believe there's a god let alone one that would send his son to be born of a virgin birth and a manger so christmas is controversial just because of its truth but it's also controversial because of its myths and that's where my title is today christmas myths and i missed a really good lispy pun and i could have just called it chris smith's and brother michael suggested that i should have had an outline of mike tyson uh there behind it and so we're preaching on christmas uh christmas myths and i know now i'm gonna list my way through this as we refer to it but and that's what i want to begin to speak on are christmas myths christmas myths right and and i'm not going to be able to get into those myths necessarily this evening but it's something i want you to begin to ponder what are the myths as it relates to christmas and how is it that mythology has somehow been blended in with christianity and made the gospel uh mysterious to some and controversial to others and even caused some to reject truth or to reject certain things all based upon a mythology it's starting saints pray for me my tongue's starting to get real fat but there's uh there's things that i want to begin to identify and it may be something we could just touch on very quickly in a future service but before we begin to drill down on some of these christmas myths i wanted to just take a foundational some foundational subjects some principles maybe not subjects but just words and principles before going deeper into the myths of christmas and these things i want to identify tonight are principles that are worth understanding with respect to any subject matter as you approach anything in the word of god as you approach any subject matter with respect to god's truth and maybe even guiding principles if we're trying to figure something out in our own personal life that may not relate to supreme truth these principles are important to think of and i want to talk about polarization polarization and the importance of being balanced how things can become very polarized polarization and the importance of being balanced or the importance of balance and with respect to polarization just the idea of things being coming radicalized radicalization or even a dogma and are those terms that are familiar to you i'm going to expound upon them a little bit so i think they'll become more familiar and hopefully just kind of find their place in this subject matter and truth can be very muddied up obfuscated because of extremes and so you have a truth and then people can get very extreme with truth and when truth and when i say extreme i don't mean people being very fervent and passionate or zealous about truth because there's a we need to be zealous and there's a true zeal that is according to knowledge but what i what i mean is truth can be lost sometimes not in the zeal or proper enthusiasm for truth but in the extremes that people can take with respect to truth and what happens is these opposites begin to form the boundaries and so you have you have some people that look at something one way and they form a boundary and this is the line and they're in this extreme and then it happens on the other side we're going a little bit i'm going a little bit far in my my my slideshow i should have put the warning there my my even my christmas image of polarization you get that the pole polarization um and so i'm gonna get there i'm gonna get the polarization but in the um so the one side has a barrier this is how we believe this is how we see things and they become very entrenched in this and then on the other side and sometimes i'd even say it now i hope to come to it later almost in a counter measure people draw a line in another extreme and in some ways it almost tries it's almost trying to form like this counterweight to this side that's really extreme so this side other side gets really extreme and then this almost becomes the point at which um you have to either be on this side or that side and so if you if you have to gather behind this line or gather behind that line these lines actually then become barriers to truth because everybody's put in this camp and everyone's put into that camp and you either have to be on this side you have to be on that side and there's really no more liberty uh to even find the zeal for the truth because now it's been lost in the extremes fanaticism is maybe a word we could use for this it's an excessive or irrational zeal so i believe that we ought to be as christians zealous for truth but when it comes to the word of god and the thought and the logos of the word of god we ought not to be irrational or exceed beyond some boundary with our zeal so it's something if you're a fanatic you're wildly excessive it's wildly excessive devotion or wildly excessive enthusiasm to be a fanatic it's one who's marked by or motivated by extreme unreasonable enthusiasm and so i think that's something when we think about because we can be called fanatics and that doesn't necessarily mean you are one i think the phrase is oft you've been used before fanatic is just someone who loves jesus more than you and that a lot of times can be the truth a fanatic is one who is more zealous for truth but i'm not identifying a zeal for truth as it says something that is excessive or something that exceeds a particular it's irrational fanaticism is something that crosses a certain boundary fanaticism is something that exceeds it says it becomes excessive so if we could just think about that in order to go from zeal to to fanaticism you have to cross a boundary and that's that's where the extremes begin to be adopted is in these ex in these signs it's winston churchill that said a fanatic is one who can't change his mind and won't change the subject and so it's something it's irrational it's excessive it's too much so now on the subject of polarization i want to just ponder this for a moment and maybe briefly just express this polarization is the state of having different properties on different sides so this is where we could put that slide up of polarization it's the state of having different properties on different sides we have polar opposites and so we get the idea of pole it's the poles even in the earth that's where we draw this thought from the north pole the the north pole the south pole and they're polar opposites it's having different properties on different sides that's what this word uh polarization relates to uh so if something is polar it's the direct opposite in character or tendency as it relates to electricity or magnitude uh if something's magnetized you could have these polar opposites things that are directly opposite in character or tendency so what does that tell us if i'm talking about polarization you're talking about properties with different signs different characters and it's tr polarization can be good and we don't want to characterize it as all negative but it's something that can be good within a democratic society it's something that's good within the um the political process so it's not that it's all bad if you become polarized and believe in something and very adamant about something and people are different so it's not just the polarization alone that begins to raise these barriers to truth but polarization can quickly go beyond disagreement indifference to where wow you see it one way i see it another way and and so we can be different in character and i can acknowledge well i see it this way you see it that way and so and it can even be opposite where i think it's this way you think it's that way and it's really hard to see the two harmonized and that in itself is not wrong it's not wrong to have disagreement it's not wrong to not see things necessary exactly the same way but what happens when we go beyond just our differences is that can lead to a loss of empathy to where now because i believe a certain way and you believe another way there's certain mechanisms that begin to work within our in our minds and what happens is we begin to lose empathy over why this person may see it the way that they do or why i see it the way i do and the liberty that they may have to see it a different way and then we might feel attacked we might feel kind of defensive so we can't we're not just happy saying well we just agree to disagree you've got to tear the other person down or you've got to make the reason why they believe it differently because there's something wrong and there's some they've done this and they've done that and you start to tear something down and you lose empathy as to why they may be where they are and when that happens it goes beyond mere disagreement or differences and it leads to what is called effective polarization it's a negative sentiment towards one who differs or disagrees polarization is one thing and it would be fine we are polarized in a lot of our beliefs in a good way we believe the bible is the word of god that's polarizing we believe it's true it's without error that it we can trust it we can rely on we believe that jesus christ is the son of god that's polarizing there's a lot of things that are polarizing but what begins to happen is even holding those truths could you imagine that believing that jesus christ is the son of god who came into the world to shed his blood from my sins and it's the very heartbeat and blood of god that jesus loved those who disagreed with them and the very ones that crucified him he shed his blood for in what grace and mercy was shed and then as soon as we find somebody else who doesn't believe jesus christ the son of god you infidel i hope you die and like all of a sudden it's like whoa that escalated really quick we're bathed in the blood of jesus christ basking in the glow of his love and find out that someone doesn't share the same sentiments and we want to we want to do our own christian jihad on them it's a paradox isn't it maybe not quite a paradox but more uh revealing but this effect of polarization is where we begin to develop these negative attitudes these negative feelings towards someone who disagrees with us and this is where we begin to get very extreme our polarization is one thing but then we become begin to get extremist with it and it leads to this not just uh empathy but antipathy where now we are very harsh very critical not not that we just lost feeling but now we begin to develop these very negative feelings and it leads to radicalization where people get radical with it and whenever we become radicalized and i'm wanting to wanting to introduce these principles because i think that your mind you could grasp these things and use them in this context these are very foundational principles when we become radicalized it's easy to justify hatred when we become radicalized it's very easy to justify hostility and anger and bitterness and even violence well there's and you think well we're not we're not talking about christians anymore well i'm going to show a lot of grace for people who become radicalized and then do a lot of hateful spiteful sometimes not just character assassination but do physically physically do things that are out of character and they would know that they're out of character but they justify their hateful words they justify their hateful actions and they justify it out of some sort of radicalization about truth even some people when they become anti the word they become anti the message they become anti certain things it's it's not enough to continue to love and to pray and to desire to see grace come on the scene and things to change they become radicalized against something and once they become radicalized they'll use a lot of other people's failures and things that they've done and their own hurts and their own disappointments to justify hatred hostility and they'll even justify lying exaggeration manipulation and all sorts of nasty devious things and they'll justify it because they become radicalized against something and and they they will even be confronted with it and say well you know all of it was you know maybe 99 was a lie but one percent was true and the reason why they feel justified is because they're convinced that the means justify the ends justifies the means now there's also so there's there's a there's the camp that we could say that we need to be very careful of becoming radicalized where we're different we have differences well then that and that's in that way we're kind of polarized because we don't really see harmony or the way these two things uh could meet and then the the once it gets to this effect of polarization you get to get you begin to get nasty you're following me out or it's not we just disagree but now they disagree because they're the devil or you know maybe that's a i will people say that we know that's true but maybe we wouldn't say that about each other uh they have an iphone because they just can't afford an android whatever it is and so we get into these camps and we're in these kind of we take these positions and then when we become radicalized and we become very entrenched in these things and we get in that extremism it becomes more negative we're able to justify hostility and that's when we become radicalized now that's one side i just want to touch on this for just a brief moment because then there is also this radicalization myth and it'd be very very dangerous because then what we do and this is let's say we're not radicalized but then we can we can take this idea of being radicalized and we can use it to stigmatize those who have extreme beliefs where somebody's very fervent about something very passionate very zealous and maybe even extreme and because they're extreme we just give them this label this scarlet letter being radicalized and this happens it happens not i'm not this may not happen necessarily within the uh our circle of fellowship and the things that we believe within the message but to some extent i would say in broader christianity but definitely as christianity pits itself against other religions there's this label of radicalization that can be placed on certain things in order to create a climate of fear in order to kind of create this kind of self-censorship because you create this oh they're radicalized and and you you got to watch out because they're going to want to they're going to want to blow up your car they're going to want to do this they want to do that and it's all done to cause one to forsake their religious uh their religious beliefs to change their religious exercises that's why i believe that we ought to be very careful as christians the animus and the the bitterness that we be we could have or the disagreement that we could have towards other people's expression of what they believe because it can be a double-edged sword that if i'm just gonna be very blunt if you wanted to get all the mosque out of maricopa it's just a matter of time before they want to get all the churches out you thought about that and that there's a certain there's a certain way that we want to be able to worship christ in liberty we have the liberty to serve god we have the liberty to to dress the way we want and to preach the things that we want and then we want to use the law we want to use politics to shut the mouths of other people that don't see the message quite the same way we do or certain views the same way we do it can kick back it can backfire on you and so there can be this radicalization myth to where we we we say well they've been radicalized and we kind of use it to put this pressure on them so that they abandon the exercise of their conviction and we wouldn't want anyone to put that pressure on us because trust me there's those that would want to put this label on us and say you were just radicalized and you've drunk the kool-aid and you guys are in a cult and they want to cast you as being radicalized and they want to use that as some sort of intimidation it's just a matter of time until you guys go viral and then to put this pressure on us to abandon what our religious exercise and to abandon our i say religious exercise i'd use that very generally but i can say just abandon our discipline and our conviction in truth so you say well well what's your point brother aaron all right thank you for asking my my point is beware of the polls and i'm not talking about you know where they ask you questions and or or people from poland i'm saying beware of the polls the polarization the ex the the extremes the sides beware of those uh and beware of the extremism and the way they kind of push you within those extremes and be aware of your own biases be aware of certain ways that we might think we could be biased to certainly be aware of your own beliefs and this is the way i believe and this is why i believe it be very conscious of that and when someone believes differently realize that if you are in fact walking in truth by revelation and somebody is counter to that and they are uh they are in the opposite in character their opposite in tendency realize the grace that put you in the place that you are and how that it must be the same grace that'll put them likewise in the same place otherwise we're all just playing a game so you recognize i'm in truth by the grace of god they are the polar opposite to me but it's going to take the grace of god to change them and put them where i am and so as we spoke on for many many weeks on who is my neighbor we don't want to be that nasty neighbor who cast somebody down and always criticize them as and is terrible towards them because they're the opposite from us they're never wanna they're never gonna wanna be in the place you are and here you are in truth and you've created such a nasty energy around your truth that the person who's in complete deception knows enough that they don't want that so that's the uh that's my point in bringing up polarization beware kind of avoid the caustic extremism where you can get very extreme with something and when you get extreme you get very caustic with it and it's something that is uh that often grieves me as i can agree with somebody but their tone and their attitude and the way they're putting is so caustic and that's corrosive it's going to erode something and you're going to kind of lose the righteousness and it's become unrighteousness whenever it gets caustic so there's the kind of the subject of polarization but then also in another way of looking at this because i want to touch on hopefully we can get to it tonight on balance but i want to look at the idea of dogma and a dogma is a settled opinion it's a principle that one holds two that you hold to is being firmly established so you can have a dogma and he said this is this is firmly established in psalms 119 verse 89 it says forever o lord thy word is settled in heaven i use that so that when we introduce the concept of dogma use that term i don't want you to think that anything that's firmly established is you know be leery of god's word is dogma it's firmly established it's forever established it's the truth is firmly and forever established thy word is settled it is it is dogma the word of god is dogma so it's a principle that we can hold to the word of god is something we can hold to as being firmly established and as we talked about fanaticism before the line between faith and the word of god and fanaticism is found right here the word is the line between faith and fanaticism someone says well i have faith i'm zealous i have a zealous faith and then someone else has fanaticism you say well what's the difference brother the difference is the word because remember fanaticism exceeds something so the boundary that fanaticism exceeds is the boundary of the word of god where they take something that is outside the word it becomes the kind of the focal point the rallying point the rally and cry it's not even in the word it's not a subject of the word it's not addressed by the word or clarified by the word but yet it becomes something you can be very passionate very zealous of and then it becomes fanaticism because it's no longer in the foundation of the word so you want to know the difference between faith and fanaticism the word the line of the word the boundary of the word is the difference faith we know is built on the word faith can only be energized and fed by the word but fanaticism on the other hand it may be very near the word so you can have the word the word ends here and you can have fanaticism just right here right up next to it but it's crossed over so you have the word establishes the boundary fade fanaticism became very very near it but one thing about fanaticism is it's not fed by the word it's not supported by the word fanaticism lives outside of the word fanaticism has its existence outside the word because fanaticism is not actually sustained by the word now your your minds are working right now and i can tell there's things that are turned over and you realize that when someone has given themselves from faith into fanaticism it's no longer the word of god that is bolstering their enthusiasm it's no longer the word of god that's channeling their faith and causing them to act they're no longer operating by the message of the hour they're operating by all these other things forums and whatever else you want to talk whether it be social media or things you read and that's what becomes the evidence and the support and that's what keeps the belief or conviction going is things that aren't in the word come on somebody it's true it's something we have to be very very conscious of that fanaticism exists outside the word lives outside of the word and is fed and sustained by things that are not that are outside of the word and so it's important i believe it's important for us to know the difference between word and i'll use this phrase personal dogma very important for us to understand to know the difference between the word and personal dogma you can have a personal dogma as it relates to certain things and that that dogma as long as it's not anti-word and as long as it doesn't infringe on somebody else's liberty and christ then we could respect that right that's their personal conviction it's not a word but that's their personal conviction but it's important for us maybe to recognize that their conviction is not necessarily word based but if i'm the one with the personal dogma it'd be very important for me to realize that by me not drinking coffee i just lose everybody i'll drink i'm a social drinker i'll drink coffee every once in a while but i used to joke when somebody said brother aaron would you like some coffee and say no thanks i'm a christian and uh and then i really one time that kind of got taken the wrong way and like they didn't realize i was completely joking and so then i started saying uh no thank you i don't even smoke and i think that one was even worse so i just don't joke around anymore i'll say no thank you and so but if someone had this conviction that you shouldn't drink coffee that there's something wrong with coffee and i don't you shouldn't be drinking that kind of caffeine or maybe even meat don't eat meat meat is bad and they and they're vegan or vegetarian or pescatarian they only eat fish that would be a personal dogma that would be something that this is just the way somebody feels and and you would know they'd kind of be getting on a dangerous territory if they started to try to use this to support that right and that would be when it would be important for someone to say you know i have this i have this personal metric i have this personal conviction have this personal dogma and then that'll keep them from becoming what not just polarized but radicalized and looked down on all these filthy meat eaters and so it's important to know that and so i think it's kind of built into the word dogma in the sense that dogma would be a firmly established truth we could say that the word of god is dogma but in this sense god's word is not dogma dogma is a philosophical tenet or or a philosophical opinion think about that it actually comes from the root that which one thinks is true coming from the the root to seem good or to think you're pondering that that dogma is just something that which one thinks is true and it seems good or you think to be true so in that way dogma could be just a personal opinion we need to recognize when we are entering into these areas where we just hold a personal opinion and when opinion deviates from the word this is something i guess would be a very very uh broad subject but when whenever our opinion deviates from the word but you you want to justify it or some forces begin to work on you uh because of your personal conviction you try to make it spiritual if it's contrary to the word at some point i'll say this especially for a real believer there's gonna there's gonna be some dissonance begin to wrestle between well the word doesn't really talk about this at all but i have this idea this really gets under my crawl and i really feel strong but i can't really find any basis or justification for it so then you begin to get this little dissonance and in order to shout down the dissonance you become very dogmatic and so it becomes a dogma to you and then and that's where and then if someone tries to help you say hey you know by the way then you get what more entrenched because you get very defensive that's why we have to be very careful about the things that we begin to defend i found this in my own personal experience especially as a minister uh that there's things that truths that you would hold you'd say well i i i believe this is just right about where the word of god places this truth and all of a sudden you find somebody that just kind of takes it and throws it all the way over here and you're like oh my goodness how could you do that and in an effort you know to balance out the guy who wants to close the book and throw it all on the other side you want to take it and put it all the way over here and you find wait you realize wait a minute i don't even i don't even believe that i'm not that extreme i'm bending against this guy over here and you got to recognize when that begins to happen because sometimes one of the worst things that can take place in our own spirits is when we get oh we get unnecessarily defensive about truth and by pushing back against the air we kind of we cause ourselves to get a little bit out of off balance a little bit off balance and so that's how we can keep even from truth from becoming tainted with this personal dogma and opinion by just recognizing these mechanisms that can work against us and resisting being overly defensive resist uh this idea of shouting down our dissonance and becoming dogmatic on things if you have an opinion on something that the word doesn't clearly address keep it out of the realm of the word that way you won't try to use the word to justify it you won't become dogmatic about it and you can have grace for other people that may see it differently and and the church age book brother branham writes this it is very very profound i want to read a very large portion of it and i believe it just really conveys what um what i'm thinking about in terms of these where how it begins and it kind of entrenches itself and we know that he brings us through this progression of deed doctrine and death and how something can start as a deed it's merely a deed but then it becomes a doctrine and then it's crowned in death but this is just the one part here that deals with it from deed to doctrine see how it started out in the early church it was called deeds it's just something you do right i do this this is something i drink i i don't drink coffee or i drink coffee but he says then it became a doctrine it became the standard it became the unbending way it finally took over and god was pushed aside it's amazing that this could happen around things that are that are quotes and scriptures and principles in the word of god that you can because you may take a deed and it becomes a doctrine then god gets pushed out of it oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looked so good it seemed so sound then it caught a hold and like a python it squeezed out the very breath and killed breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church we need to be very careful that we don't have deeds that become doctrines that do not have god in them because they will act as a python in your spiritual life anybody want to say a personal amen to that you take up causes you get caught up in things that have don't have god in them and it's a deed the deed may be fine in itself hey i'm doing this thing i'm doing this thing but then it becomes this doctrine and it gets on this slippery slope where now it becomes more of an identification because more of a fervor more of a passion outside the realm of even recreation or hobby or even a conviction now it becomes this python that can squeeze the very spirituality out of you because it's gotten into it's gotten out of balance oh that false vine is subtle it is like an angel of light until it gets a hold on you now i want to say that i believe in leadership i wanted to read this because i felt it was so beautiful to balance out um some of the the way the channels through which deeds and doctrines come i believe in leadership but it's not the leadership of men i believe in i believe in the leadership of the holy ghost coming through the word there's a we could probably get the loudest course of amends everyone agree on that and then it gets a little tricky for some people because there's different camps i believe also that god has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order i believe that i also believe that the church is ruled over by men that god sends to take charge we believe these things and i love this balance but that rule is by the word it's not the man's charisma it's not his opinion it's not his popularity it's not his politics it's not his money the leadership is by the world the rule is by the word so that it's not men really ruling but the spirit of god for the word and spirit are one now that's the anecdote to deeds becoming doctrine that's the anecdote from not being led astray into certain things that may be done and maybe personal conviction maybe personal opinion maybe personal dogma that someone does and then when it begins to take hold as a doctrine that happens when man's personality and his own preference and these different things begin to take the preeminence and then it's no longer ruling by the word you're ruling by your opinion and that opinion becomes the python that's going to take the spirituality right out of you so that men are no longer ruling by the spirit of god they're ruling by their own spirit their own opinions very very dangerous brother jason demars expressed it this way i believe it was last year at a ministers meeting in 2020 it seems like decades ago or maybe days ago i don't know anymore it's just kind of all running together but uh there's um he made the subject was on the line between being ecumenical and compromised it was very intriguing subject i really really enjoyed it i had the opportunity to speak on it myself but the one my takeaway was not what i spoke on but what brother jason dimar said and he talked about how where the problem in these areas and i want to specifically relate it to this the problem is when we are dogmatic when god allows differences and allow differences when god is dogmatic i thought ponder that for a moment so very well fray a framed statement that we can be very dogmatic on something that god's word doesn't even touch on could you imagine if we had this dogma that if somebody didn't have a turkey on thanksgiving they were serpent seed i mean i know some people that didn't and it just may be a very innocent way of putting it if someone didn't have turkey ate cheesesteaks or something like that on thanksgiving that they can't be christians right there's no way in the world they'd have to be from philly and can any good thing come from philadelphia i mean there's all the things we can start saying and that would be we all of a sudden get dogmatic and you just create kind of this i listen if things were uh if i if i would if i was just one percent good looking some people could take them like oh my goodness did you hear that we shouldn't have cheese steaks and just build a little cult around it but i have the benefit of not being very charismatic and that's how things get started just a little statement is made and also it becomes this idea and i'm using something very innocent because i doubt anybody had cheese steak on thanksgiving but if uh or maybe i'm doubting my doubts because i know someone did um so if they if we made that a doctrine and we're dogmatic about you have to have turkey you have to have turkey well please show me anywhere in the word of god and use josephus if you want all the the fox's book of martyrs you can use anything you want to try to find place where someone anywhere made this statement that you had to have turkey on thanksgiving and just show me anywhere and you'll find the god silent but you get dogmatic about it and there's a problem when we are dogmatic on something that god has not even addressed or dogmatic on things that god isn't very clear on he says it a certain way and and wow there's it could be this it could be that and you realize i i need to be very careful not to be dogmatic and say this is a firmly established truth these are the boundaries put a period on it and anybody outside of his contrary to the word of god when god himself hasn't done that and then the flip side is when we allow differences when god is dogmatic that the word of god says it's one way but we oh well it doesn't really matter it can be this way it can be that way when the word of god is clear the way that baptism ought to be and there's well maybe we can allow differences and the word of god is very clear on salvation very clear in certain things there's things in the word of god that god is dogmatic about this is an abomination this is how i feel this is the way it is this is how the things ought to be established this is the word of god pertaining you and we have things that the word is very dogmatic on and where we get in trouble is when we begin to allow differences on the things that god is dogmatic and what i find fascinating if i could use that word for this is a lot of times the people that are most dogmatic on things that god allows where god allows differences can allow for differences so easily where god is dogmatic it's like wow i mean you are very very extreme on this but very very loose on that with no basis for this but a lot of basis for this as brother rand continued i just had this statement written down and didn't provide the full quote he says with those arms of iron his deeds became doctrine and his doctrine became the law of an empire you see how subtle it can something can come into your life arms of iron can turn deeds into doctrine and then this doctrine becomes the law of your life this doctrine becomes what overrides you it controls you and so he's showing how that deeds become doctrine and they're not supported in the word but they're carnal traditions they're men's ideas they're things that christ even identified as taking away the life and the power of the word of god and so there's i just i i'm wanting just to introduce these things to you and and i realize with such liberty tonight it's been very easy to amplify these things maybe beyond what i intended but recognizing how personal dogmas and things and opinions that we might hold that might be different we have to be very careful that we don't become entrenched with them and extreme with them and i would say even dogmatic so that it becomes polarized and then it we begin to cause friction let me just say this avoid weaponizing your personal dogmas right you see something one way someone sees it the other way if two can come together and reason it out and find it in the word of god i believe that we should have relationships with one another that if i preach something wrong as your pastor and you see it in the word of god a different way you are absolutely welcome to come show me and i mean that if you feel differently for about something i am not above the word of god if you see it a certain way i welcome you to show me and we can talk about it and we can reason it out and then we might just say well brother you see it this way or well sister well argued and you see it that way and i can show you where i see it you can show me where you see it and then we could just say hey you know what i see where you're coming from you do you see where i'm coming from and there might be a way that these things kind of dovetail together when we look at things in the word of god but if there's something that's not in the word of god and you know it's your personal preference or your opinion and it's your own little pet doctrine or your pet dogma let's not weaponize it as for somebody else's detriment i mean there's things even such as one cup at uh a communion versus several little cups that divide denominations like we're all one big happy family let's have communion and wash one another's feet oh i love you brother washing one another's feet oh this is wonderful and then they bring out the communion train it's a bunch of little cups it's like never mind i hate you give me one cup and they separate and and you're laughing maybe because you know it's true or maybe you think i'm just joking but there's been organizations split over whether or not you use one cup or little cups at communion and i'm not saying there might not be a very robust theological debate with respect to that but it's very dangerous when you weaponize things and become radicalized and then therefore justify hatred because somebody sees it differently than you i need to go very quickly here it's in philippians chapter 4 verses four and five i debated on whether or not to include chapter verse four not a whole chapter just verse four chapter four verse four and then five but paul says rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice this is very extreme it seems you're going to rejoice in the lord alway which really doesn't leave room for any more but then he says and again i say rejoice so rejoice all the time plus more and this seems to be very very passionate rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice so rejoice 24 hours in a day and in another half hour or rejoice even more rejoice rejoice 365 and on the leap year right like rejoice rejoice rejoice but then he says let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand what a remarkable statement let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand moderation it speaks of yieldingness being able to yield let your moderation it speaks of reasonableness i know and it is true that this phrase could be used moderation can be used to express uh you know maybe not an excessive appetite or giving in to certain things but even in that way it holds this foundation this route of being reasonable that your moderation it's a it's it's being able to yield it's being able to understand it's being able to be entreated there's this kind of this accommodation without compromise that it's speaking of you're going to rejoice in the lord always but then we're not wanting to be these religious zealots who are extremists that want to kill all the infidels there's a moderation that we have in second corinthians chapter 10 verse 1 paul uses this he says now i paul i paul myself beseech you i'm reasoning with you i'm pleading you but he says by the meekness and gentleness of christ which means the the mildness makings the mildness the gentleness speaks of fairness one translation says by the meekness and the sweet reasonableness of christ christ had a there was a reasonableness about him we know that there was a no without question there was things that he acted under the anointing of the scripture the zealothine house hath eat me up and that zeal could in no way be fanaticism because it's according to prophecy the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up and he rid the the sanctuary or the the temple of the money changers and turned over their tables and this was him operating which would be some with some sort of zeal and passion but yet you look at how his life was characterized the friend of publicans and sinners and and he had tax collector that followed him and all these he had this this uh reasonableness about him that was inviting to those that needed him he wasn't prickly and caustic uh to the hurting to the lost he even uses the phrase you know those that aren't sick don't need a physician you guys that have it all figured out and are religious and you avoid this and you avoid that you know you could tithe on the mint and cumin and you everything broke down and you've got everything figured out you're religious and you're pious and you know how to pray and you cast down them oh god thank goodness i'm not like that guy over there he says i'm i haven't come for those who think they're perfectly healthy i've come for the sick and he had he had an inviting nature about him that drew the sick to him a reasonableness it comes from actually logicos which is of the word to be reasonable agrees to reason or following reason comes from a logic cost which which would come from logos and that's where i said jesus's reasonableness was an anti-word it never deviated from the word and that's our reason for believing is the word whereas fanaticism human reasoning takes place of the word remember radicalization is not connected to the word fanaticism is not connected to the word it can be very near it and at one point in it but then once it crosses the word it becomes fanaticism brother branham says in the message god in simplicity or god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same he said there's one side that's highly intellectual cold and indifferent they deny everything there so that's one side and the others get on the other side on the other side a radical bunch of emotion and deny the word you see the two ruts two sides and one side that's all emotion cold or no emotion cold formal but they deny everything the other side maybe they don't deny as much but they deny the word and he said these are two sides but he says but the real true church stays right in the middle of the road that's when it comes to the word we know there are some things that we want to stay afar as far away from the edge as possible right right and we want to stay as far away from the world as possible there's other things that we find ourselves in and you've got this side and you've got that side and we need the discernment to know that i can stay right in the middle there's a path there's a right path do you believe that there's a right way and there's ditches that are formed on each side of the right way and in these ditches we can call them ruts but there's ruts on each side of the road and in these ruts there's hang-ups it's always easier to travel in the road is that at least something we can all agree on if you're in the ditch it's a lot harder to go but yet if you're in the motorcycle it's a lot easier to stay on the road instead of a ditch even if you're on your quad or a dirt bike you're going to find that the road is a lot easier uh to traverse than the ditches so you could be in a rut and moving along and i know this the phrase is i can't tell if i'm in a groove or a rut because they're really similar in a lot of ways but you could find these sides on both sides of the word of god in the imbalance are ditches and this is true the word can be preached in such a way to pull us out of those ruts but the danger's pulling too hard and you go from one ditch to the other oh they're all caught up in this they're all caught up in that and so in the effort to get them out of this you yank so hard they go out of one ditch into the other like oh my goodness i didn't you weren't supposed to do that why because you go too hard you can go so hard on you know god's prophets don't make mistakes where every word is thus the lord but you've got to be very careful when you start to talk about mistakes otherwise you just can reject the whole thing there's ditches that form themselves on each side of the road when it comes to god's path that he has for us and we have to be sure that we stay out of the ditch that the real true church stays right in the middle of the road in other words it's important for us to be balanced christians even the idea of planting seed you you plant in the in a row because that's something that's going to enhance the yield and maximize your yield why don't we just throw seed out there indiscriminately any any farmers here what do you do you ho a row you farm in a row and you plant in a row why to maximize the effectiveness of the seed to maximize the yield of the seed if you just throw it all out there indiscriminately and nothing's in its place in the proper channel you won't get the results you need and you can maybe make some progress in a ditch but it's not going to be efficient and expedient to where we need to go get out of the ditches in the middle of the road and avoid those ruts that are hang-ups that cause it so hard to go the way of the christian life i believe i could say this in the name of the lord some of us are finding the word of god to be very difficult not because of the word but because of the personal dogmas we've attached to it and we're finding so much resistance and we're finding it so hard to move forward and you're just in a ditch just get out of the ditch leave the personal dogma alone leave all their stuff get out of the ditch get in the middle of the road you'll find you know what it's much easier when i stay in the middle of the road billy branham and when he's preaching revelation of jesus christ he's uh in december of 1960 he's talking about how there was this legalism that came legalist teaching and he said the legalist teaching was a good thing because all he had got what had gone was calvinistic in england where they didn't even have revivals anymore and john wesley came along preaching the armenian doctrine which balanced it up so he's saying that they were all on this one side in calvinism and then there was armenianism and he says god will always balance it up and so sometimes the there can be an extreme that is god's purpose of trying to bring the balance but what do you have to do you don't want to get in this side or that side you got to find where god's trying to bring the balance i've often wondered this sometimes this is where the danger is uh when we have access to all the other great ministries that are in the world today and you can stream this preacher and that preacher and this minister and this pastor and just right now we can leave the service and we can pick up somebody else's service and we can listen to what they preach tonight and it's very wonderful to have maybe an opportunity to hear what some of these other uh ministers are saying but there's a real danger because i know it could happen at any moment to our services where somebody just tunes in at one moment and like wow they're really out on a limb because you've never you've never watched the pastor climb up the tree set the stage for why he's going out on a limb to rescue a lamb that's gone a little bit of stray to bring him back off the limb and get him back on the down the tree like we don't catch the rest of it so we go away going man i really wish brother ann was on a limb i really wish he was this way i really wish he did that and you don't know you don't even know where it's going right because you only catch a glimpse and it's important for us to realize that sometimes god will allow things to happen to bring a balance but you got to take everything in total and allow god to balance it up i want to end with this with a thought just i want to sum this up polarization and let me say it more this way extremism and even radicalization and i want to make this even in this sense even things that are anti-word are sometimes born as a counterculture and counterculture is something that where there's something is a certain way and then that's kind of what the hippies were right there's counter culture there's different things that you know they want to be counter it's like all the hipsters you know they want they just want to be different and they've just all become the same and it's like you're not really a hipster you're like everybody else your beard your flannel your boots everything you're just a carbon copy of the next guy and and so there's it's this attempt to kind of try to be different edgy counter culture and so there's this i'm not looking at the sense of some sort of you know uh movement that wants to be counter culture in itself but there's this things that can take place to where there's certain things are a certain way but then something raises up to counteract that and to be against it and there's a lot of things that are movements and extremes and political ideals and philosophies that exist for a reason and maybe we don't ask ourselves why is it this way there's a sermon that i had wanted to preach for a long time and i recently just revisited my notes on it and hadn't recently there's times we find ourselves i won't preach it right now it's 8 35 but there's times we find ourselves having to make a critical decision and instead of asking ourselves what decisions should i make we should ask ourselves how did i get here and there's a reason why people can be where they are there's a reason why they're there and it's not to say that they're justified in being there but maybe to find out how someone gets there is explanatory as to why they're feeling the way that they are and there's instances where someone could be uh could perceive a problem and even if it's not fully rational they their their position exists for a reason even if it's not really a true solution to the problem or fully rational but it exists because they recognize something is wrong they perceive a problem and many polarizing movements are in direct opposition against the word this is important for us to ponder at all times how does this relate to the word of god modern events are made clear by prophecy i always want to view things through the the viewer the viewfinder of god's word i want to look at it through the word of god and there's a lot of things that exist because they're kind of it's satan's agenda against the word of god and you go oh wow this is happening because it's against it's anti-word it i can see that this is clearly against the word but i i know it's late but please i think the lord just arranged it perfectly with those who have late bedtimes or no work tomorrow or something like that are here tonight i'm not going to be very much longer but i want to share this it's very important it's very heavy up on my heart but so there's things that are anti-word and sometimes it's not obvious but god's got to bring us to these places to recognize anything that's contrary to the word of god we need that discernment but i want to say this in some cases there can be movements or even extremes that exist because of the lack of broad faith in the word of god now i hope i hope that that statement is explanatory but let me say it this way in our even in america alone there's problems that exist because faith has lost its hold within our community community at large when you when you don't have men of conviction when you don't have principle when you don't have integrity in truth and the bible begin to lose its premise there's things that exist as problems today in america and around the world that are symptoms of broad faith a public believing in god a a broader public going to church a broad right of public believing in christ in the virtues of the word of god and in a broad faith in the word of god as that has weakened it's given rise to these other things so i i want you to recognize things that may seem to be very anti-word sometimes they exist not to be against the word but they exist in the absence of the true word all right to me it's so liberating when you think about it that way it was something that really and i'm really continuing on the subject of blind trust bad faith because this was something so i recognized how we we lose our our center post we lose our absolute when we when we don't recognize that some things exist today because faith no longer has its hold in society as it once did so let's just as i close think about the first christmas i want to use this to to wrap this to wrap this up but in the first christmas the world was lost amen groping in darkness it was chaotic it was depraved you'd actually find if you study it that had been hundreds of years since the word of god had been spoken they had lost so much of their of their worship even in israel there is so much in the word of god is somebody praying that i just stopped because now my throat is dry the world the um it was there there's so many things that's kind of maybe just getting into my thought process here because i studied on this and i know exactly what i'm looking at and i don't want to have to describe the whole picture to you but even israel god's chosen people the nation of israel had no word the word of god had been lost and so even if you go to luke chapter 2 i'm not going to read it in luke chapter 2 it sets the scene for the birth of christ because caesar augustus called for taxation what does that tell us they are under the dominion and rule of a foreign power they've been stripped of their liberties they're being called to tax and to report back to their the place of their birth and their their family lineage in order to report and so it's in that season the darkest of times god's answer and god's solution to all these things that we could describe was jesus christ this was god's answer what we read about luke chapter 2 tonight this babe lying in a major this was the beginning of god's answer the savior of the world now follow me please very closely very closely here so christ then was the answer to all strife christ was the answer to all evil he was the answer to sorrow he was the answer to sickness he was the answer uh uh to to uh whatever you could think of cry that would be negative jealousy hatred bitterness anxiety depression christ was the answer and we could say even today would we not agree that if there is a lacking if there is a longing christ is the absolute answer to any need that we have do we believe that so then that was god's answer in the first christmas then what happens if christ is not preached what happens if christ isn't lifted up i i'm wanting to i pray that your heart could be softened towards those that are lost because what happens when christ is no longer lifted up what happens if christ is not preached in the absence of a christ to run to they'll turn to something else and in revelations chapter 3 verse 20 says behold i stand at the door and knock one of the most pitiful scriptures in the bible because christ's true nature is no longer in the church he's no longer within the church he's no longer in the place that is identified as christians as maha gandhi said it is not the christ that i do not like it is the christians that i don't like he said he liked christ he said it's the christians i don't like why because the christ that ought to make the christian church a christian church is no longer in the church so it's not really a christian church it's just a church it's a mystery babylon and it becoming it becoming this and it becoming a church that no longer has christ christ true reasonableness christ's true nature is no longer in the church and if jesus christ no longer has the preeminence what does the church have to offer except personal dogma opinion polarization if christ no longer has preeminence what is the church inviting people to and listen there's people that are sharp enough to look at it and say that's not something i want that's no better than the other religions of the world that's just as bankrupt as this theology that's just as bankrupt as that one and what they do is they turn to something else not because they're evil but because of their need is not met in the church can i blow your mind since you waited with me this long we can really really have a lot of hatred and bitterness towards feminism but i don't because i had the highest grade in feminist political theory when i graduated from my undergrad degree i had the highest grade in the class the feminist hated me but i didn't hate them feminism offers to women who've been marginalized women who've been abused women who've been controlled it offers to those women the value and the worth that christ could give them think very deeply about this because we make a lot of people are bitter enemies but what they what they found in their ideology is what christ could have offered them if the church hadn't kicked them out and so you're the only one that holds the true balm to give them what they need and they're looking to find in their ideologies let me say this way the ism itself can be evil but the ist may just be confused the ism may be evil the ism may be anti-word but the ist the one that's in it may just be hurting may just be seeking the feminism is anti-word but the feminist just may be looking for something that'll give her the value and give her the worth that only christ can give her but she never found it in the church all right i'm gonna stop here if we could stand together i'm gonna sort of turn the service over brother michael if you don't mind coming and maybe playing but i'm going to turn it over to brother loyal for worship and uh but i i want to i'll say this just so no one can get worried about where i'm going because i realize even right now i've probably set a pretty good foundation to either say if you celebrate christmas you're going to hell or if you don't celebrate christmas you won't be in the millennium i've probably set a pretty good foundation for either one of those but let me just say this when it comes to celebrating christmas it's december 1st some of you have already gotten out your christmas decorations uh or some of you have already gotten out your ba humbug sign i don't know but let me just say this when it comes to celebrating christmas that's a family decision not a church decision there's not there's no church creed that's going to force you to do one thing or the other i think that's something that there should be no church pressure when it comes to those things if if i as the pastor in my family celebrated christmas and none of you did there should be no pressure for you guys to change what you do as family when it comes to christmas if i didn't celebrate christmas as a as your pastor and i was very adamant within my own home that we do it this way and we don't do it that way and we've seen the nonsense and we're going to be very careful not to identify ourselves with all the frivolity that's related to christmas then i wouldn't it wouldn't be my place and i probably may be giving a very uh open door into how i believe that the message of the hour lays this out i should not exert pressure from the pulpit and put this political pressure on you to change what you feel led to do within your home but what we can do is use the word of god to bring the balance and use the word of god to let christ have his preeminence within our homes and there may be things that you could do as families there may be something we do as a youth group there might be things that we do that should not be taken as some sort of endorsement or approval of anything because as a church i would say this you abide by your convictions as you see them in the word of god you abide them as you feel that you ought to in the home but most of all let's not leave the word of god because it's when we do that all of a sudden things become polarized and we have to have an a service and a b service so those who want don't mind me saying merry christmas can come in the morning and those who can't stand it come in the evening right there's there's a there's a church i know of that had different entrances and exits so if you could enter one way you could exit the same way and that church they no longer hold services in this building anymore but that church actually the people entered and left according to the particular doctrine that they believed you came through that door you were in a camp if you left through that door you are still in that camp and let it not be so amongst us that we become so polarized in the things that god is not dogmatic on do we begin to lose the fellowship and the strength and the camaraderie that we can have amongst ourselves because god's doing something very special this is the work of god that is very very special it's done so much for me i can testify as a christian this work of god has done so much for me i trust that you could testify the same for you and your families and i have a burden this this december to lift up christ and do it in a way that promotes the freedom of worship and the liberty of the holy spirit in our midst can we do that together let's pray our gracious heavenly father lord has a precious presence with us tonight it's wonderful how you orchestrate just the the service from beginning to end and lord our heart misses the more than a dozen families that are not here this evening we we miss them we miss their prayers and their singing and this their countenance their amends it's obvious lord that that they're not with us and we miss them and to think lord that in their absence in such an extreme absence you still brought so many out to the house of god and the house feels it doesn't feel empty it feels full and there's such an anticipation and a worship where the voices being raised it created just the perfect atmosphere tonight to hear your voice and lord i realize as i have the benefit of looking at a month's worth of sermons and a burden that i would like to unfold to this church as you've burdened me it might be easy for some to take the things that i've said and feel that i'm pushing pushing on them but lord let me just get out of the picture tonight and may you just be the one that sets their present within their hearts to either encourage and increase our zeal or wash us of any fanaticism that keeps us from seeing your face clearly our need is for you our answers are in your word [Music] and lord as we brought to our minds the image of a feminist who can be very [Music] passionate of certain ideals and principles and in that belief and conviction that can be so anti-word lord to understand that even that movement and those positions as anti-word as they are some people are caught up in them because when the church ought to have nurtured her protected her and valued her she was marginalized and abused and cast down [Music] and is just searching for something to find the worth that is in her lord that's what happened to your bride in the face of so many isms she became an ist not because she wanted to be but because she couldn't find you and i'm so glad we found the ist the christ that you've taken us to become christians and i pray tonight as we stand in your presence that you could be the one that levels this out in this subject matter and the things that i'm preaching that we could find the true balance and be in harmony with your word in these things i commit it to you now i pray father be with your people and bless them supremely in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you
