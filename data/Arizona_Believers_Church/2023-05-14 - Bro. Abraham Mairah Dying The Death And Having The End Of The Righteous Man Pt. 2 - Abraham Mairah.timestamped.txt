[0:00] Yeah, it was quite interesting
[0:01] yesterday. We sharing about
[0:05] dying the death and having the end of
[0:09] the righteous man and we're trying to
[0:12] focus
[0:15] so much on what's the death of the
[0:17] righteous
[0:20] visav the death of a fool.
[0:27] And we saw how the four lepers
[0:30] said, "How can we just sit there idle
[0:35] when we can do something?"
[0:41] And they came up with a decision
[0:45] said we have to do something about a
[0:46] condition.
[0:48] If we go back to the city, we shall die.
[0:51] If we stay here, we shall die. If we go
[0:54] where the enemy is, well, we shall be
[0:56] ready to die. If they kill us, we die.
[0:58] If not, we shall live.
[1:01] So there is some hope in the land of the
[1:03] enemy than where we are. Because where
[1:06] we are, we shall die. If where we left,
[1:09] we shall die. If we go back to the city,
[1:10] we shall die. If we stay here, we shall
[1:12] die. But if we go where the enemy is,
[1:14] well, there is some probability that we
[1:16] can live. So they were willing to stake
[1:19] their lives to go to the enemy. And we
[1:23] saw in the book of um Deuteronomy, I
[1:25] mean numbers
[1:28] where Joshua and Calb says only don't
[1:31] rebel against the word of the Lord. The
[1:34] Lord the land that we saw is very good
[1:36] land
[1:39] and if the Lord delights in us,
[1:44] he will bring us to that land.
[1:45] Yes. Right. And the people that you are
[1:48] magnifying so much,
[1:51] talking so much about how big, gigantic,
[1:56] how you are belittling yourself to the
[1:58] size of a grasshopper
[2:04] because you are looking at the horror
[2:06] condition using your eyes. You don't
[2:08] have eyes of faith like David who could
[2:10] not look at the gigantic Goliath by the
[2:13] physical eyes.
[2:16] But he looked at him by the spiritual
[2:18] eyes and saw him as an uncircumcised
[2:20] man.
[2:22] He says, "What will this uncircumcised
[2:23] Philistine do?"
[2:25] He didn't mention, "What will this mass,
[2:28] gigantic, big appearing man do?" That
[2:30] would already praise the enemy and work
[2:33] psychological and spiritual on him to
[2:35] pull him down. So he looked at the other
[2:38] side, how God looks us, how God looked
[2:41] at Goliath,
[2:42] the uncircumcised.
[2:45] Amen.
[2:47] So I think for us to always get victory,
[2:49] we need to put on God's goggles, so to
[2:51] speak,
[2:52] so that we begin to look at things the
[2:54] way God looks at them. So you see Joshua
[2:56] and Calb are saying the enemy, those
[3:00] men, those giants you are talking about
[3:03] are bread for us.
[3:05] Yes.
[3:10] And I wish I had my strength. Me I'm
[3:12] more of a preacher than a teacher. Then
[3:14] I could do preaching
[3:17] because that is very good to me.
[3:20] Your enemy is your food. What you fear
[3:24] is where your strength is.
[3:26] What you are scared of, what makes you
[3:28] freak out is what you actually embolden
[3:31] you because that's where the midst of
[3:33] your victory lies. You can never have
[3:36] victory without the enemy.
[3:38] And you will never sit with Christ on
[3:39] his throne unless you overcome. So how
[3:41] will you go there without overcoming?
[3:43] And how will you overcome without a
[3:44] battle? And how will there be a battle
[3:46] without an enemy?
[3:48] So we should thank God for the enemies.
[3:53] Because the Bible says, I will prepare a
[3:55] table for you before your enemies.
[3:59] So God has never promised to take away
[4:01] enemies from you. In fact, he makes sure
[4:03] that he surrounds you with enemies.
[4:05] So because as a child of God, you are
[4:08] successful, more successful spiritually.
[4:10] when you are surrounded by enemies than
[4:13] when you are surrounded by friends.
[4:18] You will not understand that but that's
[4:19] the truth.
[4:21] So when you are surrounded by enemies
[4:22] don't pray that God takes away the
[4:24] enemies.
[4:25] In fact I pray that he adds you more
[4:30] because the more enemies the more faith
[4:33] the more resilience the more stand in
[4:35] the word the more you are grounded.
[4:37] That's why the prophet says the more
[4:40] they win the more the roots go down.
[4:44] So God doesn't take away the enemies
[4:45] because the enemies your promoters when
[4:48] you are sick when you in problems that
[4:49] they once always who say let's see he's
[4:51] God. So they provoke God into action on
[4:54] your behalf. They are always challenging
[4:56] God. I said let's see his God. This time
[4:58] he must die. This one is not going to
[5:00] survive. Let's see. He always says he
[5:02] trust in God. So they are provoking God
[5:04] on your behalf. So they are you are
[5:06] promoters
[5:07] and I'm always really happy to have
[5:09] them. That's why the Bible says love
[5:11] your enemies. Pray for them. Don't even
[5:14] hate them.
[5:15] But don't make them your friends. Just
[5:17] love them.
[5:19] Feed them. But don't go to eat in their
[5:20] places. Feed them
[5:22] because you can't poison them. But for
[5:24] them they can try to poison you. So
[5:26] don't don't go there and play around and
[5:29] eat there and no
[5:30] but feed them when they come. Close them
[5:32] when they they naked. The Bible says
[5:35] because those are your promoters. You
[5:36] need them. You need them more than you
[5:39] need your friends.
[5:44] Well, that is a strong statement, but
[5:46] that's what I've gone through. I am
[5:48] where I am. If some of you have ever
[5:50] listened to my testimony because of what
[5:52] I went through.
[5:57] And actually the more enemies you are
[5:59] surrounded with, the more faith, the
[6:02] more God is presc.
[6:05] And that's why here we see a prophet
[6:08] Isaiah saying, "Lord, other lords
[6:11] besides thee have had dominion over us."
[6:17] God permits other lords besides him to
[6:21] have dominion
[6:23] so that you fight to break through
[6:27] to break free.
[6:29] Amen.
[6:30] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So you
[6:32] see that's why these people were saying
[6:35] if we die if we sit here we die. If we
[6:38] go back we die. If we go forward well
[6:40] there's a chance. And because they were
[6:42] willing to die, they didn't die because
[6:44] they lived by faith.
[6:46] Faith takes you to the enemy's ground,
[6:49] not to the comfortable zone.
[6:51] Because first of all, where is the
[6:53] comfortable zone?
[6:55] Not even your home is comfortable.
[6:58] There's no place you'll ever be that is
[6:59] comfortable. Not even your family.
[7:02] The only way that you'll get comfort is
[7:05] when God ordains peace. Like the
[7:07] scripture will says, "Lord, you are the
[7:10] only one who has ordained peace for us.
[7:14] Thou shalt ordain peace.
[7:19] So your peace
[7:22] lies within the confines of your
[7:24] victory."
[7:24] Amen.
[7:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So now
[7:28] the problem that we always have is
[7:30] sitting idle wanting things done for
[7:34] you.
[7:36] But a prophet, we read what the prophet
[7:38] said, don't sit idle. Do something.
[7:41] Don't wait to be prayed for pray. Don't
[7:43] wait to be don't asking even silly
[7:45] questions. I mean, how do you ask me
[7:47] about hair? All these years you have
[7:49] been in the message, you don't know the
[7:50] scriptures about hair.
[7:54] You don't know what the prophet says
[7:55] about her. You don't know even the bests
[7:58] about the church order. You don't know
[8:00] even how to pray, how to wait upon the
[8:01] Lord.
[8:03] You don't know your responsibility. Who
[8:04] is the bride? There are some questions
[8:07] that you should be now asking as mature
[8:09] people but not childish questions. There
[8:11] are certain things that you have to do a
[8:13] DIY do it yourself.
[8:16] You are mature and you have to read the
[8:17] message
[8:18] to start a message to pray and to ask
[8:20] God. God doesn't have grandchildren.
[8:22] God can deal with you. He can speak to
[8:24] you. He can reveal himself to you. He
[8:26] can make it plain to you. You are not
[8:28] going to work. I mean God has to work
[8:30] with you directly
[8:31] because he's his you are his daughter.
[8:33] You are his son. Amen.
[8:36] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[8:38] So that's what we looking at yesterday.
[8:45] And the question was David is asking why
[8:48] should Abuna,
[8:51] a major general, commander in chief, a
[8:54] commando trained in military affairs.
[8:59] Why would we die as a fool
[9:03] at the hands of his fellow commander
[9:05] Joab?
[9:07] And why did he accept to be called back
[9:10] summoned back by his actual enemy, a
[9:13] sworn enemy
[9:19] because already he had finished the
[9:20] king's business. He had already talked
[9:22] with the king. King David had already
[9:24] done you know you know commissioned him
[9:26] sent him to go and gather all Israel so
[9:28] that all the people come to accept him
[9:30] as a king why accept another call
[9:36] that's the problem people who always
[9:38] call you back and trying to talk to you
[9:41] other things
[9:42] more than what you've heard and that's
[9:45] why now we have so many jobs who are
[9:48] sending secret messages
[9:50] do you really believe this I want to
[9:53] talk to you about us about ABCD. Can we
[9:55] meet in private? I want to talk to you
[9:58] without your pastor so that we discuss
[10:00] these things these things really. Do you
[10:03] see the way I see it the message
[10:06] according to brother so and so? Have you
[10:08] have you heard him of reason? Have you
[10:10] seen how he exposed this?
[10:16] Ah,
[10:19] blessed be the name of the Lord. Just
[10:21] like you know what what what what what
[10:23] what the what Hanoon did to the servants
[10:26] of the messengers of David.
[10:28] David has heard that his father has died
[10:30] and he has sent messengers
[10:33] to console him to comfort him and he
[10:36] takes the messengers of David and just
[10:38] shaves half of their beard
[10:40] and then cuts off the clothes the Bible
[10:43] says to the mid of the bs
[10:45] that's what the Bible says and sends
[10:47] them away naked
[10:52] and the men were so ashamed
[10:55] what they they were done to I mean what
[10:57] was unto them was unwarranted.
[11:01] So we have such men
[11:04] who have a specialization in calling you
[11:08] secretly to cut off the clothes of
[11:10] somebody. Do you really know so and so?
[11:13] Do you know that man you are dealing
[11:15] with? Like right now they can tell you
[11:18] do you really know William brother? Do
[11:20] you know the weaknesses he had? Do you
[11:22] know there are things he prophesied and
[11:24] did it happen? Do you know this? Do you
[11:26] know this? They have the ministry of
[11:28] cutting off the scars of the prophet and
[11:30] exposing his nakediness.
[11:32] Am I interested in his nakedness? I'm
[11:34] interested in the mouth.
[11:36] I'm interested in the spoken word. I'm
[11:39] not interested in the person.
[11:43] God called me to the reality of the
[11:45] message, not the messenger. Don't point
[11:47] me to the messenger. Point me to the
[11:49] message. Amen.
[11:51] So as far as God is concerned, he's not
[11:53] even concerned and heaven is not
[11:55] concerned about the weaknesses of the
[11:57] messenger, but the purpose of the
[11:59] messenger.
[12:01] And God lets those messengers have
[12:03] weaknesses that people can point out to
[12:05] and to try to discredit here, discredit
[12:07] there to to destroy your faith.
[12:10] But we are not here to look at William
[12:12] Brham. We are here to receive the
[12:14] message that he brought. And the message
[12:16] that he brought with revealing identify
[12:18] the the the fullness of the word Jesus
[12:21] Christ himself. So Jesus is here. But
[12:23] because many people are failures,
[12:26] look, Joab is exposing his own distrust
[12:30] in the leadership of David. He's under
[12:33] David, but he's not contented with what
[12:37] David is doing. He feels he has better
[12:40] ideas, better plans than David, but he
[12:44] died for it.
[12:48] So the question is, why would you die as
[12:50] a fool? Because a fool says there's no
[12:53] God.
[12:56] We were dealing with that yesterday.
[13:01] We are not fools and we should not act
[13:04] as fools and live like fools.
[13:06] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now
[13:08] today I'm looking at how do we end.
[13:15] You see
[13:21] look at Moses.
[13:23] How is he ending?
[13:26] One of the greatest prophets the world
[13:29] has ever had. The very type of Jesus
[13:32] Christ.
[13:37] The one whom God made a god. I have made
[13:41] you a god to Pharaoh.
[13:45] The one whom God talked with face to
[13:48] face.
[13:51] He asked one time God until God showed
[13:53] him his glory. God showed him the back
[13:56] part his back.
[14:00] Look at how he's ending
[14:03] being buried
[14:05] in the land of Moab
[14:08] by God himself.
[14:13] He is ending by being shown
[14:18] what the possession is but not being
[14:21] allowed
[14:23] to go and possess.
[14:30] And if you'll watch carefully, this is
[14:32] what the devil wants to do.
[14:36] He wants you just to look at what is
[14:39] promised.
[14:44] And that's what God allowed Moses. Look,
[14:46] see, see see
[14:49] all the land. But you're not going to go
[14:51] there. Why?
[14:54] Because of your reaction to the
[14:56] provocation.
[15:00] You didn't really act calm. You didn't
[15:04] You were not cautious of my presence.
[15:07] You owned my position.
[15:12] You know, Moses is is told to go and
[15:15] speak to the rock because he had already
[15:17] smitted the rock
[15:20] and that rock was Christ and Christ
[15:22] supposed to be smitten once.
[15:25] when you smile him the second time, that
[15:27] is Hebrews chapter 6,
[15:30] crucifying him the second time.
[15:33] But now Moses because he's already
[15:35] annoyed
[15:37] and he had a problem of anger,
[15:41] he goes in rage
[15:43] and he forgets the very wording of the
[15:47] message.
[15:49] He doesn't do it according to what God
[15:52] spoke verbatim.
[15:57] Instead of speaking to the rock, he hits
[16:00] it twice.
[16:10] And if you watch carefully, why did he
[16:12] hit it twice yet? He had already hit it.
[16:16] That makes it three times the rock is
[16:18] heated
[16:21] is hit three times by Moses.
[16:27] And Moses here is typing on the in the
[16:30] physical someone who will see but not
[16:34] rich.
[16:37] Although for him of course he went to
[16:38] heaven. He is gone. The Bible says later
[16:40] on God pardoned him and came and
[16:42] resurrected him and there was an
[16:44] argument over his body with Lucifer.
[16:47] Do we know that?
[16:49] Do you know why there was an argument?
[16:51] Because of this.
[16:57] And now today we see Jesus was crucified
[16:59] first on Calvary. In 1963, brother
[17:02] Brandham preaches indictment and he says
[17:05] they have crucified Jesus Christ again
[17:07] the second time. in 1963.
[17:10] But today Jesus Christ is again this
[17:13] time being crucified by the bride by the
[17:17] believers
[17:19] because the fullness of Christ has been
[17:22] identified. Christ was identified with
[17:25] the bride
[17:26] live the denomination 1963 Christ was
[17:28] crucified by the denominations
[17:31] on their pulpits.
[17:33] But in the year 2000 where we are
[17:35] standing onwards 2023
[17:38] Christ is being crucified. The message
[17:41] is being crucified. The truth is being
[17:43] crucified by the people who believe the
[17:45] truth and preach the truth.
[17:49] Three crucifixions.
[17:51] The rock was hit three times.
[17:57] And because they are hitting the rock
[17:59] the third time, it impedes them to cross
[18:03] over.
[18:10] I was preaching somewhere in Kenya
[18:11] sometime last year, November I think,
[18:13] and I was talking about this is Jesus
[18:15] Christ, the king of the Jews. I was
[18:18] talking about the Jesus whom the devil
[18:20] wants, the Jesus whom the people want.
[18:25] And Pilate is saying this is Jesus the
[18:27] king of the Jews. And they are going to
[18:30] him and said don't write the king of the
[18:32] Jews but that he said. And then Pilate
[18:34] says what I have written I have written.
[18:37] I know that that man is a king of the
[18:39] Jews. And look at the kind of the the
[18:42] way you have treated your king.
[18:45] Look at your king. He's not my king.
[18:48] He's not the king of the Romans. He's
[18:49] not the king of the Gentiles. He's not
[18:51] he's the king of the Jews. Look at your
[18:53] king. You have sweped him naked. You
[18:55] have beaten him. He has a crown of of
[18:57] thorns. He's bleeding. He's is is like
[19:00] that. You are king. The Jesus that is
[19:04] demeaned. That is brought down.
[19:09] That is crucified.
[19:11] That's dead.
[19:14] That is the king. That's the Jesus you
[19:16] want. That is the Messiah you want. You
[19:18] want him in that state.
[19:21] That is the crucifixion. Jesus crucified
[19:25] both the hands the the legs are nailed.
[19:28] The hands are nailed.
[19:31] Three nails.
[19:34] One nail is joining the legs. Another
[19:37] hand. The hand is a nail. The hand is
[19:39] nailed. Three nails.
[19:41] And we still have the three nails today.
[19:46] Women, money, popularity.
[19:49] That's what is crucifying him.
[19:54] Popularity, money, women
[19:58] has made preachers today to crucify,
[20:00] right?
[20:01] Jesus to sell the truth, to reject the
[20:04] truth.
[20:06] And Jesus is now a powerless crucified
[20:10] somebody.
[20:14] The Jesus you control, the Jesus who
[20:16] doesn't control you, the Jesus who's
[20:19] held, who cannot stand and the feet
[20:22] stand for the gospel. The hands stand
[20:24] for the works. So the hands are nailed.
[20:29] The Jesus that is powerless that cannot
[20:31] heal the sick,
[20:33] crucified,
[20:35] exposed, ashamed, belittled, abused
[20:38] because of the church, because of the
[20:40] believers.
[20:43] So Moses because he crucifies or he hits
[20:46] him the third time. First time smite the
[20:50] rock. That was official. God told him to
[20:52] smite the rock and God permitted Jesus
[20:54] to be killed on Calvary.
[20:56] But second time 1963
[20:58] the type of 1963 denominations killed
[21:01] him, rejected the word, crucified the
[21:03] revealed truth, rejected the prophet.
[21:05] And now in our age, the message
[21:08] believers they wanted Jesus the control.
[21:13] the Jesus that is so little that is so
[21:16] small
[21:17] that has no control over them they have
[21:20] their rights they they they talk the way
[21:22] they talk they walk the way they want
[21:26] the Jesus they don't worship the Jesus
[21:29] they can't praise too little to be
[21:31] praised so that's why this instead of
[21:33] clapping you know we do this
[21:36] our Jesus has become so little he
[21:39] doesn't deserve being clapped for he
[21:41] doesn't deserve love being lifted up
[21:42] hands for. He's not a big one to be
[21:45] woripped.
[21:49] A Jesus we have no time for his word. We
[21:52] can't even read. You know, we have so
[21:54] much stuff that the world gives us to
[21:55] read, but no time for Jesus. A Jesus
[21:59] that you cannot kneel and pray to. You
[22:02] are too big to even kneel. Too big. Yay.
[22:05] Yay.
[22:07] Crucified, put in a small place,
[22:09] belittled one. The Jesus that the devil
[22:12] wants, the message that doesn't control
[22:15] you, but you control it.
[22:23] Yeah.
[22:25] Yeah. That's why we come here somewhere.
[22:29] The prophet says
[22:33] there's a problem. He says it is the
[22:36] stubborn. Let me come here. He says God
[22:38] is going to ask us why.
[22:42] Why sit we here?
[22:44] Why are you not healed? Why are you not
[22:47] strong? Why are you not having the Holy
[22:49] Ghost? Why are you not on fire? Why are
[22:52] you ashamed of Jesus? Why are you, you
[22:55] know, embarrassed to talk about him? You
[22:56] can't even testify about Jesus. Do how
[23:00] do you want to end?
[23:03] Do you know what God was hating about
[23:05] Moses? When Moses was smiting the rock,
[23:08] he said, "Come if you rebels," you know
[23:11] the scripture. He says, "Must we
[23:16] must we fetch water for you out of this
[23:20] rock, we"
[23:23] And God said, "Because you didn't
[23:26] glorify me,
[23:28] you glorified yourself."
[23:34] Mhm.
[23:35] And you know the word that God has given
[23:38] us, the truth that God has given us,
[23:41] this message should make us nothing,
[23:44] should humiliate us to nothing until we
[23:46] become completely nothing and we
[23:48] disappear and he appears.
[23:52] What they call the manifestation of the
[23:54] sons of and daughters of God. That means
[23:56] you completely disappear. It's God now
[23:58] appearing. It's God now speaking,
[24:01] walking, talking and doing everything.
[24:03] But when you are the big one and Jesus
[24:06] is nothing,
[24:08] then you are taking the glory from him
[24:12] and God is going to say because I gave
[24:15] you the opportunity to glorify me
[24:20] so that you get manifested as a son of
[24:23] God.
[24:28] But instead, you ended up glorifying
[24:31] yourself.
[24:33] And that's why we have so many of these
[24:35] super preachers,
[24:37] international pastors,
[24:39] big men around the world,
[24:41] messiahs,
[24:43] prophet this, prophet that, messenger
[24:46] this,
[24:49] I have come back instead of William Ram.
[24:53] Yeah,
[24:56] brother says when Christ pours himself
[24:59] again anymore, he's not going to pour
[25:02] himself into one individual. Says the
[25:04] whole body of Christ.
[25:06] So the Elisha ministry is not going to
[25:09] be some brother somewhere in Africa, in
[25:11] America, Europe,
[25:14] right?
[25:15] It's going to be the body.
[25:16] That's why it's called a bride body.
[25:22] Okay.
[25:26] Well, I said yesterday I'm not looking
[25:28] for friends. Maybe I'm preaching myself
[25:30] out of Phoenix.
[25:34] Maybe Phoenix will never invite me
[25:36] again.
[25:38] And that would be very good for me
[25:42] because it will keep me back home.
[25:47] Glory be to God. Amen.
[25:49] So the problem is when you lift up
[25:52] yourself, you take the glory from him,
[25:54] you begin to be the one to shine. All
[25:56] men look to me. I'm the man of the hour.
[26:04] Oh,
[26:09] blessed be the name of the Lord. So what
[26:11] happens?
[26:14] God now says, "Okay, you see where you
[26:17] are supposed to go."
[26:20] Is that the end I want to have? No.
[26:25] So the prophet says he God is going to
[26:28] ask us why.
[26:30] He asked the king why.
[26:33] Now it wasn't because they didn't have a
[26:36] prophet that they could consult. No, no,
[26:39] no, no, no, sir. He could have went and
[26:42] consulted with a prophet.
[26:45] Excuse me.
[26:48] The prophet of God. It wasn't because
[26:50] there was no prophet in Israel. Sure,
[26:53] the God of Israel would have told the
[26:55] prophet about a king, but it was the
[26:58] king's own stubborn way.
[27:02] And then he comes up and says, "And
[27:03] that's what's the matter with the
[27:04] nations today in the world. It's not
[27:06] because we haven't got a God,
[27:11] but science is trying to rule him out of
[27:14] the picture.
[27:16] Science.
[27:19] I have the best specialist for the nose,
[27:22] for the eyes, for the this, for the
[27:24] that.
[27:26] And they are always booked out.
[27:28] The dentists,
[27:31] the ENTs,
[27:34] Dr. this specialist this and and you
[27:36] know God is say okay come on wait time
[27:39] will come that you'll have to look for
[27:41] me
[27:44] science is trying to rule him out of the
[27:47] picture
[27:50] you have a problem before you even kneel
[27:52] and ask God to touch you have already
[27:54] made a call to your specialist
[28:01] Uhhuh.
[28:03] And God comes last when man has failed.
[28:13] Who must have the preeminence?
[28:17] Mhm. Science
[28:20] is trying to rule him out of the picture
[28:22] and the people are too stubborn to stand
[28:24] up on the principles of God's word.
[28:27] Exactly right.
[28:30] Stubborn.
[28:32] Maybe that's not a good word, but I'm
[28:33] reading your prophet.
[28:38] Oh, they say it's just a bunch of horas.
[28:40] Let it be whatever it may be. I've
[28:43] traveled around the world over several
[28:44] times. I've never seen a horola yet. And
[28:47] I've looked, but there is 969
[28:50] different denominations, organizations,
[28:52] churches recorded in Washington. And
[28:54] there's not a one of them called Horas.
[28:59] That is a data name that the devil put
[29:00] on the church. Right.
[29:02] There's no such a thing as a holy
[29:03] roller. No such an organization called
[29:05] holy rollers. They call anybody that
[29:08] believes in holiness holy rollers.
[29:11] And yet without holiness no man shall
[29:14] see God. So you see where the essence of
[29:16] it comes from. Yes. Amen.
[29:20] They they they they they attach a name
[29:23] that is you know abusive to reality so
[29:28] that they it works on you
[29:29] psychologically to distance yourself
[29:31] from it.
[29:36] You grow hearing bad words about it. So
[29:39] he says all right the king he was just
[29:41] stubborn and he didn't want to listen to
[29:43] the prophet. They had a prophet. Now he
[29:47] comes down. He says just like a man
[29:49] dying on a do on a doctor's doorstep
[29:52] because he won't take his medicine. The
[29:54] doctor's got the toxin for the disease
[29:56] that he's got and the man will set will
[29:59] sit on the doorstep and doctor has got
[30:01] plent of toxin but he won't take it. He
[30:04] just too stubborn to go in and take it.
[30:06] He will die and he ought not to if he
[30:10] feels that way about it if it is not
[30:14] because of the doctor. So don't lay it
[30:16] onto the doctor. If the doctor's got the
[30:18] toxin and is willing to give it, and the
[30:20] patient is sitting there on the
[30:21] doorstep, just too stubborn to come in
[30:24] and take it, don't lay it onto the
[30:26] doctor.
[30:27] It is not the doctor's fault. Neither it
[30:30] is of the toxin, it is the patient's
[30:32] fault that won't take it. So when you
[30:34] sit there and there is a solution.
[30:38] I read here a quote yesterday where the
[30:40] prophet said you have no reason why you
[30:44] leave this building and go home when you
[30:45] are sick.
[30:51] It's not even about a preacher I'll pray
[30:53] for you. It is about the faith that
[30:55] moves the gift.
[31:02] Many of you heard about the the old man
[31:04] who was here yesterday. The thing is the
[31:06] father of sister Hannah Stansson
[31:09] he was this old man yesterday was seated
[31:11] here
[31:14] and many people have said this woman was
[31:16] born blind. How could he see after 40
[31:18] years? I said it's her faith.
[31:22] I just prayed for her. She had problems
[31:24] with the voice in 2014 and God healed
[31:26] her and God healed her friend who was
[31:28] also deaf and she hearing after 20
[31:31] something years deaf
[31:34] and many other cases of leukemia were
[31:36] healed. So she took a queue and say if
[31:38] that man can pray for this he can also
[31:40] pray. And she came.
[31:43] She traveled by herself all the way from
[31:45] Norway
[31:47] to Uganda
[31:49] to my deep village there and we kept her
[31:53] there for a week and I prayed for her in
[31:57] church after regular service like this
[32:01] and God opened her eyes.
[32:05] It was not me,
[32:07] not because I'm special, but she had
[32:10] special faith in the word in in in what
[32:13] God can do.
[32:16] Brother Brham says very clear that that
[32:19] woman who touched the hem of Jesus was
[32:21] healed because she had a right attitude.
[32:25] That is all her faith.
[32:27] She wrote her own check
[32:29] and dropped it into God's you know
[32:32] banker into God's you know you know you
[32:34] know riches
[32:36] and and God gave it to her and it
[32:38] surprised even Jesus said who touched me
[32:43] but so many others were just rubbing on
[32:46] him and scrubbing on him and say let's
[32:48] see this this holy law here let's see
[32:50] this man who claims to be the holy man
[32:52] of God they didn't get anything
[32:55] they didn't get anything. So he comes
[32:57] here he says the same thing that is in
[33:00] the church the same thing is it is in
[33:02] the church we've got plent of balin gad
[33:07] we got physicians here but people die in
[33:10] the pews in sin without the holy ghost
[33:14] because they are too stubborn to come
[33:17] and take it
[33:21] they are there
[33:23] but they sit there and die in the pews
[33:31] One time I was somewhere and you know
[33:33] God's grace sometimes goes a little
[33:36] a step more for some people. I was
[33:39] praying for some people and there was a
[33:41] woman who was almost dying and then the
[33:43] Holy Spirit kept telling me this woman
[33:45] needs deliverance
[33:48] but she had a stubborn spirit and you
[33:50] know in her she was feeling like she's
[33:52] very white
[33:54] you know the white supremacist spirit
[33:57] and this is a black man with black hands
[34:00] cannot lay his hands on me
[34:05] and I called out I said sister whom do
[34:08] you think will will miss anything. It's
[34:11] you who is going to die.
[34:14] Not maybe it's my black hearts
[34:17] and the Holy Ghost is not black or
[34:19] white.
[34:20] It's not even yellow.
[34:25] So you are looking at the skin, the
[34:27] badger skin.
[34:29] You are just suffering. You are, you
[34:32] know, you are defrauding yourself. You
[34:34] are cheating yourself. You are deceiving
[34:36] yourself.
[34:38] come out of that shell. This white skin
[34:40] is nothing. It's just food for maggots
[34:43] like mine.
[34:45] If you die, maggots will eat you like
[34:47] they eat me.
[34:52] Uh she's there. God is delivering other
[34:56] people. For her, she's like, "How can
[34:58] that black man touch me?"
[35:04] Sure.
[35:07] Stubborn spirit, intransigent, rigged.
[35:15] Mhm.
[35:18] They die in abuse, in sin without the
[35:20] Holy Ghost because they are too stubborn
[35:22] to come and take it and they afraid it
[35:23] will hurt their social prestige.
[35:26] It will break them down. Might cost them
[35:29] a little of their card baptism things.
[35:31] They afraid it might cut up a little
[35:34] cut. Actually,
[35:36] no. Don't blame the doctor. Don't blame
[35:38] the remedy. Just blame the patient for
[35:41] not taking the remedy. That's where it
[35:43] is. We've got toxin. We got plenty.
[35:48] The world is full of the Holy Ghost.
[35:50] It's just everywhere.
[35:54] So, you have no reason why you didn't
[35:57] receive the Holy Spirit.
[36:05] And if God permitted that demon to
[36:07] torment you so that you get a testimony
[36:09] to glorify God.
[36:12] So how many people do you think have
[36:14] rejoiced over the testimony of Sister
[36:16] Hannah? So many.
[36:19] How many people have we prayed for back
[36:21] home there and God has delivered them
[36:24] and they live to glorify? So many.
[36:29] But what brought it? The attitude, the
[36:32] faith, the aggressiveness.
[36:35] You know, very many people fear Africa.
[36:39] How do I go to Africa?
[36:44] But here she is. She has never traveled
[36:47] to Africa and she's by herself. And she
[36:50] came
[36:52] from Oslo to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to
[36:55] Nairobi, Nairobi tobe
[36:58] three planes
[37:01] by herself, blind.
[37:04] Why wouldn't God honor such a faith,
[37:12] going to the unknown,
[37:14] going to the territory of fear,
[37:20] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[37:23] Mhm. So here he comes again.
[37:28] It's a dangerous thing.
[37:31] A fellow would die could die and he
[37:34] would die sitting there when there is
[37:37] plent of medicine. Now he contined to
[37:39] say. So it is today men and women will
[37:44] sit in the church, sit in the church, in
[37:46] the church pew and hear the
[37:47] unadulterated gospel
[37:51] and the power of the Holy Ghost and see
[37:53] the manifestations and the
[37:54] demonstrations of the spirit of a living
[37:57] resurrected Christ and still die in sin
[38:00] sitting in the church pew.
[38:04] Not because there's no balm, not because
[38:06] there is no physician, but it is because
[38:09] the people are too stubborn to take the
[38:11] medicine trying to find the least way of
[38:14] resistance. Going the way of the world,
[38:18] perishing in again saying of Kora, the
[38:21] least way of resistance. I want a
[38:23] Christianity that people don't resist me
[38:26] too much.
[38:29] I want to preach a gospel that everybody
[38:32] will say I
[38:35] a pro people gospel pro church.
[38:41] Well, I've not come here to make you
[38:43] comfortable friends.
[38:46] I've come here to make you so
[38:47] uncomfortable that Jesus becomes
[38:49] comfortable.
[38:53] Glory be to God. Glory be to God.
[39:00] So
[39:04] let me come to my message now.
[39:08] How do you end?
[39:10] How did Moses end? Look at the pain that
[39:14] was in Moses's heart.
[39:18] Because you go to numbers chapter 23:10,
[39:21] he was saying, "Let me die the death of
[39:23] a righteous man and let my end be like
[39:26] his."
[39:29] And brother Brandham was I read you that
[39:31] quote yesterday where he say even if I
[39:33] don't want to be a balam, but I want to
[39:35] quote what he said.
[39:37] I want my end to be like this.
[39:42] Let me go somewhere in the book of Acts
[39:44] chapter 7.
[39:51] Acts chapter 7.
[39:54] I want you to look at how this man, the
[39:57] first matter
[39:59] in the Christian era,
[40:02] the first believer to be killed
[40:06] for the gospel sake, how he ends, how he
[40:10] stays.
[40:12] from Acts 7 verse 55.
[40:22] This is Steven now preaching to the
[40:24] Sanhedrin.
[40:26] The whole of that chapter he was
[40:29] speaking to the Sanhedrin.
[40:32] Now 55 says, "But he being full of the
[40:35] Holy Ghost filled to the full
[40:40] every fiber of his life filled with the
[40:42] Holy Spirit."
[40:45] Don't just tell me, "Brother Abraham,
[40:47] you got baptized with the Holy Spirit
[40:48] some 20 years, 15 years ago.
[40:52] The disciples were filled on the day of
[40:53] Pentecost and in chapter five, they
[40:55] prayed for more. They a refilling.
[40:59] There is no sin in asking for the
[41:01] refilling
[41:03] filled until you are full
[41:06] and then you are sealed
[41:10] finished product.
[41:16] He being full of the Holy Spirit, Holy
[41:18] Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven.
[41:25] Stephen is looking
[41:29] to where he's going
[41:32] to heaven.
[41:34] Just like Enoch walked with God. And the
[41:37] prophet says one day he walked all the
[41:39] way to heaven.
[41:49] He saw
[41:51] the glory of God. And Jesus standing on
[41:55] the right hand of God. And he said,
[41:57] "Behold, I see the heaven is opened
[42:02] and the son of man standing on the right
[42:04] hand of God. I see."
[42:13] Wouldn't that be a glorious ending?
[42:20] When you see your Lord
[42:23] While you are still here,
[42:25] you see Jesus. You see heaven.
[42:33] He was lost out. He was gone. He was in
[42:35] the glory. He was here, but he was
[42:37] there.
[42:41] That's how Steven ends.
[42:45] He sees the land where he's going. He
[42:49] sees the God he has been serving. He
[42:51] sees the Jesus who died for him. He sees
[42:54] the master he has been serving.
[42:56] He sees Jesus standing there ready to
[42:58] receive him.
[43:05] The end of a righteous man.
[43:08] Yes.
[43:10] And he's dying. He's going to be stoned.
[43:12] But before he's stoned, he has already
[43:14] seen where he's going. Right.
[43:17] And he doesn't just see like Moses,
[43:21] but he's going there.
[43:28] Glory be to God.
[43:41] And he said he spoke it. He's not
[43:43] ashamed.
[43:45] Behold, I see the heaven is opened and
[43:48] the son of man is standing on the right
[43:49] hand of God.
[43:52] They don't want to hear that.
[43:54] But he's so taken so sucked up into
[43:56] heavenly places.
[43:59] He's so lost into love with God. He
[44:01] doesn't care about his surrounding.
[44:04] The gospel means everything for him.
[44:06] He's ready to die in order to live. That
[44:09] is the end of a rightous man. He doesn't
[44:12] care what he's losing, how many people
[44:14] are against him, how many are not
[44:16] wanting to hear what he's speaking. He's
[44:18] speaking what he knows and what he sees.
[44:21] He's making his final statement
[44:24] of what he's saying.
[44:26] And that's where he's going.
[44:30] Then they cried out with a loud voice
[44:32] and step stopped their ears.
[44:36] We rather preach until those people stop
[44:38] their ears.
[44:42] Talk about Jesus until your friends stop
[44:44] their ears.
[44:50] Not you stopping talking.
[44:53] Let's talk about Jesus.
[45:00] Not whisper about Jesus
[45:04] or dream about Jesus.
[45:08] talk about him
[45:11] wherever.
[45:17] That's the ending of a righteous man.
[45:19] Until your friends, your associates,
[45:22] your pals, those who have been meeting
[45:24] you will begin to stop their ears and
[45:26] say, "I don't want to listen to Yes.
[45:35] But before you stopped your ears, you've
[45:37] heard Yeah. Very good.
[45:41] Hallelujah. Glory.
[45:45] They stopped their ears and ran upon him
[45:48] with one accord and they cast him out of
[45:50] the city and stoned him. And the
[45:52] witnesses laid down their clothes at the
[45:55] younger man's feet whose name was Saul.
[45:58] Uhhuh. The same one will be converted
[46:00] tomorrow and also be slaughtered,
[46:02] beheaded
[46:04] for the very cause.
[46:08] So he's learning something from Stephen.
[46:11] What is this that makes a man willingly
[46:13] to die?
[46:17] The end of a righteous man. How is he
[46:20] ending?
[46:22] Dying. And and you know the words that
[46:24] Stephen is saying
[46:27] and they stoned Stephen.
[46:29] What is he doing? He's calling on the
[46:31] name of the Lord.
[46:33] calling upon God and saying, "Lord
[46:36] Jesus, receive my spirit." And he knelt
[46:38] down and he cried with a loud voice. He
[46:41] said, "Lord, lay not this sin to their
[46:43] church."
[46:46] And when he has said this, he fell
[46:48] asleep. He didn't die.
[46:56] That's not how we are going to end
[46:58] physically speaking for us. We are going
[47:00] in rapture. Yes,
[47:02] you don't have to be stoned. But if God
[47:04] has ordained that I get stoned, no
[47:06] problem.
[47:11] Just imagine the love the prophet had.
[47:13] Let me just bring it here where he said
[47:16] even if God was to tell me that you are
[47:18] going I'm sending you back to earth to
[47:20] preach I don't know how many many years
[47:22] he mentioned and then after that I'll
[47:24] take you to hell.
[47:26] He says, "I love him so much that I'll
[47:29] preach him from door to door, street to
[47:31] street, even if I'm going to hell
[47:37] because I would do whatever pleases
[47:39] him."
[47:40] Talk about intimate love
[47:43] between you and Christ. Amen.
[47:54] Let me let me bring you something here
[47:56] that happens when a righteous man is
[47:59] ending
[48:01] and that we as preachers like my friend
[48:04] Aaron
[48:05] and our wives, our children, our
[48:07] brothers, our sisters, the believers in
[48:09] the church should know these things. We
[48:12] must be ready for them.
[48:15] When you come here to 2 Timothy chapter
[48:17] 4, let me begin where we began
[48:20] yesterday. Verse 7. He says, "I have
[48:23] fought a good fight,
[48:28] not a bad fight.
[48:31] If you fight a good fight, that means
[48:33] the good one is involved."
[48:36] And who is the good one? God.
[48:38] No man is good.
[48:40] Not this American fake greeting. How are
[48:43] you? I'm good. You are not good.
[48:52] Hey, God bless you. God bless. How are
[48:54] you? I'm good. You are a liar. You are
[48:56] not good.
[49:01] Jesus said, "No man is good.
[49:05] [Laughter]
[49:07] Only God is God.
[49:15] So he fight a good fight that means the
[49:17] good one is involved.
[49:21] Acts 10:38 how God anointed Jesus of
[49:24] Nazareth and he went about doing good
[49:30] healing all that were sick and casting
[49:32] out devils.
[49:34] So there is only one who can do the
[49:36] good. Fight the good battle, the good
[49:39] one that is God in you, not you.
[49:43] So fighting a good fight means the good
[49:46] one is in you. Cuz for you, you seize
[49:48] that the good one is living in you to
[49:50] fight it.
[49:53] So Paul says, I've fought a good fight.
[49:56] H
[49:59] I've finished my course. I've not
[50:01] strayed into any other person's course
[50:05] trail.
[50:07] I've remained within the confines of
[50:10] what God assigned me.
[50:14] If I'm a woman, I have remained a woman.
[50:16] I've not tried to become a man because
[50:19] I'm take advantages of the American
[50:22] rights.
[50:25] Those are American rights, not biblical
[50:27] rights.
[50:29] Uh-oh.
[50:34] have kept myself a woman, a wife,
[50:38] a mother. Like on Mother's Day, oh, we
[50:41] celebrate our mothers. Okay. Are you a
[50:43] mother?
[50:45] H what does it take to be a mother?
[50:48] Not just producing a baby and throwing
[50:50] it there alive.
[50:55] That is your pastor. He'll take over
[50:56] from there.
[51:02] I fought a good fight. I've finished my
[51:04] course. I've kept the faith.
[51:08] He doesn't say I have the faith.
[51:12] But I've been the storehouse
[51:15] that has kept the faith. Who is the
[51:17] faith? It's the faith of Jesus Christ.
[51:20] And the faith is a person.
[51:22] When the son of man cometh, shall he
[51:24] find faith? Not the church having faith
[51:27] but faith will be a person
[51:30] a person in the body and the body is the
[51:32] body bride I mean the bride body
[51:35] that is housing Mr. faith Jesus Christ
[51:38] himself. So I have kept that man.
[51:45] Now let's go down here. And then it
[51:47] says, "Henceforth
[51:49] there is laid up for me a crown of
[51:51] righteousness." crown of righteousness
[51:55] because
[51:56] I am living
[51:59] the life
[52:02] and having the end or dying the death of
[52:05] a righteous man and having the end of a
[52:07] righteous man. So he says henceforth is
[52:10] laid up for me a crown of re
[52:11] righteousness which the Lord a righteous
[52:13] judge shall give me another day and not
[52:17] me only but unto them also which love
[52:20] his appearing. Now listen to this. You
[52:23] should not be afraid of the appearing of
[52:26] the Lord Jesus.
[52:28] You should not be scared of the rapture.
[52:32] You should love it. You should pray for
[52:35] it.
[52:36] You should not even be scared when
[52:37] America's crumbling, rushes this and
[52:39] that and that, the economy, this money.
[52:42] These things must be
[52:45] they must come to pass. These are
[52:47] prophecies.
[52:49] You don't have to really sit there and
[52:51] be an worried. How am I going to
[52:54] survive? How am I going to be? How am I?
[52:57] You don't take care of yourself.
[53:00] God already knows how he's going to take
[53:02] care of that. And who knows when the
[53:04] rapture is going to be.
[53:06] We have to go away before some of the
[53:08] things.
[53:11] So don't be worried. You should love
[53:14] that the raptures is coming is
[53:17] impending.
[53:18] Be happy.
[53:21] Don't bring your sorrow to church
[53:24] and they are preaching the word. You are
[53:26] there. Oh man.
[53:34] If Jesus can't make you happy, what will
[53:35] make you happy?
[53:37] If you cannot rejoice at the word, what
[53:38] will make you happy?
[53:40] Where else will you be free?
[53:46] I thank God I'm not your pastor. I'm
[53:48] just going
[53:52] now listen.
[53:55] He says, now listen to this. Do thy
[53:58] diligence to come shortly unto me. Why?
[54:02] Paul was now alone for second.
[54:10] Where are his acquaintances?
[54:13] He begins to to tell you
[54:18] for Deus has forsaken me.
[54:23] Brother Brand explain is about Deas.
[54:27] He was an intellectual world affiliated
[54:31] connected believer
[54:34] who was always watching the stocks,
[54:43] the investments
[54:46] and he was looking for the dynamics and
[54:49] this and trying to gauge the ministry by
[54:53] his intellectual
[54:55] yard sticks.
[55:01] And he reached the time and he saw like
[55:02] Paul is getting washed up. It's not what
[55:06] he used to be.
[55:08] Like yesterday a fool says in his heart,
[55:11] there is no God in this church. You
[55:13] don't feel the anointing.
[55:16] Who was supposed to bring God for you?
[55:20] Who is supposed to bring down God for
[55:22] you so that you feel the presence of the
[55:24] Lord?
[55:26] That is a deceiving experience.
[55:29] The true experience is God comes down
[55:32] for you and lives in you. And wherever
[55:34] you are, you feel his presence. Whether
[55:36] others feel it or not, you are in his
[55:40] presence.
[55:43] Now Deas has forsaken me. He says,
[55:47] having loved this present world, now
[55:51] listen, where did he go?
[55:54] and is departed unto the Salonica.
[56:01] Something mysterious about the Salonica.
[56:04] Hold there a finger beat. Let me take
[56:07] you back to the introduction of the book
[56:09] of Thessalonians.
[56:12] The church in Thessalonica.
[56:16] Hold your finger there. Let's go to
[56:19] first Thessalonians chapter one. Why did
[56:22] Deas forsake
[56:24] the ministry of Paul and go to de to
[56:28] Thessalonica
[56:34] verse one first Thessalonians chapter 1
[56:37] verse one Paul and Timos and the church
[56:43] and to the church look at that let look
[56:45] carefully and the church of
[56:49] the Thessalonians
[56:52] This is the only church in the Bible
[56:55] which Paul addresses as the church of
[56:58] the Thessalonians.
[56:59] Not the church at Thesalonica
[57:04] or the church in Thessalonica
[57:06] but the church of the Thessalonians. It
[57:09] belonged to the people.
[57:16] Compare with other message, other
[57:18] epistles, he never mentioned the church
[57:20] as being of
[57:24] but it was the church at
[57:27] Philippi, the church at Colos, the
[57:30] church at Ephesus.
[57:33] But this one is the church of
[57:36] the democratic church. The church of the
[57:39] people by the people for the people
[57:44] where people's ideas are incorporated.
[57:54] You get some sense why why why deas
[57:59] to go there.
[58:02] It was a democratic place
[58:07] where people lived the way they wanted,
[58:10] did things the way they wanted, and
[58:12] still believed the message.
[58:16] Message believers that have a liberal
[58:20] way of living.
[58:28] Second proof you want, you go to the
[58:30] second Thessalonians again, you'll see
[58:32] how Paul, you see, out of two or three
[58:35] witnesses confirming what come to second
[58:37] Thessalonians chapter one, you'll find
[58:39] he writes the same thing in verse one.
[58:41] Paul and Stevens
[58:45] and the church of the Thessalonians.
[58:52] It was not a church at
[58:55] but it was a church of the people. Same
[58:58] demon
[59:00] in Laicia if you go to revelation
[59:02] chapter 3
[59:04] is the only church that is also
[59:06] addressed like the church of the
[59:08] loudians.
[59:16] So that's why when this man
[59:21] reached to the point that it became
[59:24] evidently clear that you have to die to
[59:27] possess.
[59:29] He backed away.
[59:33] He went to a church where you live
[59:37] and Jesus is buried.
[59:40] Not a church where you are buried and
[59:42] Jesus lives.
[59:49] So we know why Dimas left
[59:53] and where he went and we can really
[59:56] understand why he went to Thessalonica.
[1:00:03] And then here Luke
[1:00:06] Deas has forsaken me. We are back 2
[1:00:08] Timothy chapter 4. having loved his
[1:00:11] present world and is departed unto the
[1:00:14] Salonica
[1:00:16] crescent to Galatia. You remember what
[1:00:18] we read about Galatians yesterday? Oh
[1:00:21] foolish Galatians
[1:00:23] who has bewitched you.
[1:00:28] Foolish
[1:00:30] a church believers of the message but
[1:00:33] foolish dying the death of fools. Having
[1:00:38] begun in the spirit, they are getting
[1:00:40] perfected in the flesh.
[1:00:45] That's where crescents go
[1:00:48] to a church that is backsliding
[1:00:52] but doesn't accept that is backsliding
[1:00:55] goes to Galatia. This one goes to the
[1:00:57] Solonica and Paul is left alone.
[1:01:06] And the prophet says, you know, men try
[1:01:09] to seek honor one from another and they
[1:01:13] honor one another and dishonor God by
[1:01:15] doing so.
[1:01:17] So, brother, if you are here looking for
[1:01:19] honor, seeking honor, respect from men.
[1:01:23] In so doing, you are dishonoring God.
[1:01:31] Every one of us wants to be regarded
[1:01:33] with dignity. He's a big man. He's a
[1:01:35] good man. He's a this. He's a that. He's
[1:01:37] a that.
[1:01:39] But when you become that, then you
[1:01:41] dishonor God. They honor you but you
[1:01:43] dishonor God.
[1:01:45] This is what the prophet is saying in
[1:01:47] the message
[1:01:50] present stage of my ministry. He says,
[1:01:53] see, we try and make big people among
[1:01:57] us.
[1:02:00] And when we are no big people and little
[1:02:03] people, we are all little people.
[1:02:06] There's only one big one among us,
[1:02:08] that's our Lord. See,
[1:02:11] and we make our organization so much
[1:02:14] bigger than God.
[1:02:17] You see the churches that become bigger
[1:02:18] than God
[1:02:21] and ministries that bigger become bigger
[1:02:23] than Jesus
[1:02:25] and you have to look to them
[1:02:28] instead of looking to Jesus
[1:02:31] bigger than God.
[1:02:34] And then here he he begins to bring how
[1:02:36] they are addressed the great holy church
[1:02:39] of this that or the other the great holy
[1:02:42] bishops and so forth. There's no such a
[1:02:44] thing as that.
[1:02:47] That is the honor of man. There's only
[1:02:49] one holy and and that's God. And the
[1:02:52] Holy Ghost which is God is among us.
[1:02:54] It's not us that is holy. It's the Holy
[1:02:57] Spirit that is in us. It's when we see
[1:03:00] things done, it isn't us doing. It's the
[1:03:03] Holy Spirit. Jesus said, "It's not me
[1:03:05] that doeth the works. It's my father
[1:03:07] that dwelleth in me and is the one that
[1:03:10] doeth the works." It isn't him that is
[1:03:13] doing it. I mean, it isn't that. It is
[1:03:15] him doing it. He says, but we find them
[1:03:19] true servants down through the time. God
[1:03:23] has got true servants.
[1:03:25] And he says, here's the thing I want to
[1:03:29] kind of exercise on for a few moments.
[1:03:32] Now, it is usually at such a time as
[1:03:35] this when men have stayed true to the
[1:03:37] word of God and all men have forsaken
[1:03:40] him until God steps in in defense of
[1:03:43] that person and crowns his ministry.
[1:03:50] But we don't want to be forsaken.
[1:03:58] But until you are ready to be forsaken,
[1:04:01] until you are ready to be hated, until
[1:04:03] you are ready to be surrounded by
[1:04:06] enemies,
[1:04:08] you are not going to get the food
[1:04:12] because the food for you is where your
[1:04:15] enemies are.
[1:04:20] And then he says God steps in down in
[1:04:24] the face of that person and crowns his
[1:04:26] ministry. That's right. What a
[1:04:28] consolation. Our consolation is built in
[1:04:30] the promise of God's work. No matter
[1:04:32] what the world says, what the world
[1:04:35] does, that is not our hopes. It's not
[1:04:38] built in what the world is doing.
[1:04:41] Whether America was prospering, Africa
[1:04:43] is becoming rich or blessed and this and
[1:04:45] that, that's not our consolation.
[1:04:50] It's not even that when your businesses
[1:04:52] are doing well, which is good. We pray
[1:04:54] for that per should not be the base of
[1:04:57] your consolation.
[1:04:59] The bas is no,
[1:05:02] the crowning of your life.
[1:05:05] And then Brham comes and speaks about
[1:05:08] himself. He says, "But all men have
[1:05:10] forsaken me because I have took a true
[1:05:14] word and stood by the word. I've stayed
[1:05:18] right here to what he said to me. Preach
[1:05:20] the word, not a denomination of
[1:05:22] philosophy. Preach the word. That was my
[1:05:25] commission. Stay with the word. And
[1:05:27] brethren, who is listening in to this on
[1:05:31] the tape? I was a great guy when I came
[1:05:34] among you just healing the sick,
[1:05:37] speaking of visions and showing things.
[1:05:40] But when I went to tell you the truth
[1:05:42] about the word,
[1:05:44] what did you turn your back on me for?
[1:05:50] Do you realize this just fulfilling what
[1:05:52] the scripture said? Yes, it does that
[1:05:55] way. Now I can hardly get into a place.
[1:06:00] Let us come from all the time. Comes all
[1:06:03] the time. One brother the other day
[1:06:04] said, "Brother Braham, I had the
[1:06:06] greatest confidence in you, but I heard
[1:06:08] you say that a certain denomination
[1:06:09] which I bring to belong to was
[1:06:11] backsliding. I I said I have no more
[1:06:14] confidence in in you at all from now
[1:06:17] onwards." And he said, "We were there
[1:06:20] was about 25 of of the brethren of my
[1:06:22] denomination sitting in one of your
[1:06:23] meetings and we just got up right up and
[1:06:26] went off when you said that."
[1:06:29] Then the prophet says, "Well, all men
[1:06:31] have forsaken me, but there is one
[1:06:33] thing. He stood by me.
[1:06:39] I'm not I wasn't disobedient to the
[1:06:42] heavenly vision that happened to me down
[1:06:44] there on the river. I've stayed true to
[1:06:46] it. He's been true to me. I'm trusting
[1:06:49] in him someday. I don't know when, for a
[1:06:52] crowning of my ministry."
[1:06:57] What is the crowning of the ministry of
[1:07:00] brother Brham?
[1:07:04] How does God crown the prophet?
[1:07:09] By vindicating the word that he
[1:07:11] preached.
[1:07:13] By perfecting the bride that he was sent
[1:07:16] to prepare.
[1:07:22] and he will present us to Christ
[1:07:26] as trophies of his ministry.
[1:07:31] So you are the crowning.
[1:07:35] No wonder the devil is fighting.
[1:07:38] He doesn't want the crowning part.
[1:07:41] But I want to stand there that day
[1:07:43] besides the prophet
[1:07:45] when he's presenting us to Jesus Christ
[1:07:47] and say I stood with that message. I
[1:07:49] preached that message. I believed it. I
[1:07:51] held on it.
[1:07:56] Okay.
[1:07:59] And the prophet brings something and he
[1:08:02] says how he wants to end.
[1:08:05] Listen to this. He says an old friend of
[1:08:08] mine
[1:08:10] which has just gone home to be with the
[1:08:12] Lord. Many of you might have known him
[1:08:14] Dr. FF Bworth.
[1:08:18] Many of you, he was here in Phoenix.
[1:08:20] Mhm.
[1:08:22] And we are here in Phoenix, isn't it?
[1:08:26] He says, "I believe with me one time, a
[1:08:29] very gallant soul."
[1:08:31] He was a saint and all man, but he had a
[1:08:34] sense of humor. And he said to me once,
[1:08:36] I kept talking about fellowship. And he
[1:08:38] said, "Brother Abraham, you know what
[1:08:40] fellowship is?" I said, "Well, I think
[1:08:42] so, brother." Both of us. He said, "It
[1:08:44] is two fellows in one ship." And so
[1:08:47] that's about right. Sharing room with
[1:08:49] each other.
[1:08:51] And I seen many of you put up your hands
[1:08:53] of knowing brother Bosworth being that
[1:08:56] that you knew him. I would just like to
[1:08:58] speak a word of his last moments here on
[1:09:01] earth.
[1:09:04] I had known him for some time and he was
[1:09:07] out here preaching the gospel and
[1:09:09] praying for the sick before he was born.
[1:09:12] So you can see what age he was. Lord let
[1:09:15] him live. I think he lived about 85
[1:09:18] years
[1:09:19] something like that and still a gallant
[1:09:23] old man when he died and when he was 75
[1:09:26] I believe it was
[1:09:28] it says I believe at age hotel in M
[1:09:31] Miami and he we had our supper and he
[1:09:34] walked out in the seashore where the
[1:09:36] waves were coming to watch up watch the
[1:09:39] moon come up and here I was about 40
[1:09:42] years old and my shoulders drooped down
[1:09:45] walking out like that and him about 75
[1:09:49] just as straight as he could be and I
[1:09:51] looked at him and I admired him and I
[1:09:53] said, "Brother Boouth, I want to ask you
[1:09:55] a question." He said, "Go right ahead,
[1:09:57] brother." And I said, "When
[1:10:01] were you your best?"
[1:10:06] He said, "Right now." Yes.
[1:10:11] Well, then I felt ashamed of myself and
[1:10:13] I said, "You forget that I'm just a kid
[1:10:16] living in an old house." That's what
[1:10:18] both said. I'm just a kid living in an
[1:10:21] old house.
[1:10:24] Said that was brother Bosworth. And when
[1:10:27] I heard he was going to meet the Lord,
[1:10:28] he was about to die. What we call death.
[1:10:31] I just almost burnt the tires from my my
[1:10:35] car going down to Miami to see him. And
[1:10:38] when wife and I got there and the both
[1:10:40] family and our family had been great
[1:10:42] friends and we went in the old part
[1:10:46] laying there on a little couch and he
[1:10:48] had raised up his little bald head,
[1:10:51] little thin arms held out to me like
[1:10:54] that and tears running down my cheeks. I
[1:10:57] grabbed him in my arms and I cried, "My
[1:11:00] father, my father, the chariots of
[1:11:02] Israel and the horsemen thereof."
[1:11:04] Because listen, if there was ever
[1:11:08] if there ever was an old man that ever
[1:11:11] put dignity in the Pentecostal move, it
[1:11:13] was brother Bothworth. He certainly was.
[1:11:16] He was a great flower. And you know, the
[1:11:18] first thing you want to do is to tell me
[1:11:20] a little joke like that, you know. And I
[1:11:23] said, "Brother Bothworth, are you going
[1:11:25] to get well?"
[1:11:28] He said, "No, brother, I'm not sick.
[1:11:37] Look at the ending of a righteous man.
[1:11:41] Oh brother, I'm dying. It is painful. It
[1:11:44] is this f.
[1:11:47] No.
[1:11:51] So much with the in love with the Lord.
[1:11:54] So much full of revelation where he's
[1:11:56] going until the pain is not felt. The
[1:11:59] sickness is not even there. Amen.
[1:12:02] Listen what he says.
[1:12:05] He says, "I'm not sick, brother. No, I'm
[1:12:08] not sick."
[1:12:12] To begin with, he said, "I'm just going
[1:12:14] home."
[1:12:16] I said, "Well, that's very fine."
[1:12:20] We had just come off the mission fields
[1:12:22] of Africa, he and I, and he said, "I'm
[1:12:24] just too old to leave any longer." He
[1:12:28] said, "I'm going home." I said, "Brother
[1:12:30] Bothworth, what would you advise me to
[1:12:32] do?" And he said, "Stay with the
[1:12:35] gospel."
[1:12:37] And he said, "Go get back to the mission
[1:12:39] fields as quick as you can." He said,
[1:12:42] "That would be my advice." And I said,
[1:12:44] "Brother Bothworth, one more thing I
[1:12:47] would like to ask you." And he said,
[1:12:48] "What is that, brother?" And I said,
[1:12:51] "Now you've put in about 60 years for
[1:12:54] the Lord in his service or maybe more."
[1:12:57] And I said, "When was your happiest time
[1:12:59] in life?"
[1:13:01] He said, "Right now."
[1:13:09] Not when the lamb walked, the blind saw,
[1:13:12] and when this and that, and saw
[1:13:14] thousands of people getting saved, and
[1:13:16] this and that.
[1:13:18] Right now,
[1:13:22] I'm ending the journey as a righteous
[1:13:26] man.
[1:13:31] And I said, "Brother Bowworth,
[1:13:34] you know, you are dying."
[1:13:37] And he said, "I can't die.
[1:13:41] I died many years ago."
[1:13:47] He died the death of a righteous man.
[1:13:50] Now he's just going home.
[1:13:54] He can't die because it's not him
[1:13:57] living.
[1:13:59] It's Christ leaving. He already died the
[1:14:02] death of a righteous man.
[1:14:07] And he died with no problem with the
[1:14:09] prophet. But all his other acquaintances
[1:14:12] rejected the prophet.
[1:14:15] And brother Abraham is calling him my
[1:14:17] father.
[1:14:20] And in another place he says I want to
[1:14:23] go home the way both worth went.
[1:14:28] That is what my end I want my end to be
[1:14:31] like that.
[1:14:35] He said I can't die. I died many years
[1:14:38] ago.
[1:14:39] He said, "Brother Brham, all that I have
[1:14:42] loved and cared for for the last past
[1:14:46] six 60 years, I'm watching for him to
[1:14:50] open that door at any time and come and
[1:14:54] get me."
[1:15:00] waiting for him to open the door. Get
[1:15:03] me?
[1:15:06] Look at that.
[1:15:09] That was when Pentecost was fading and
[1:15:13] the message dispensation coming in.
[1:15:18] And brother Bam calls that one his
[1:15:20] father.
[1:15:26] And he loved the way he ended.
[1:15:29] And he ended the way he ended in peace
[1:15:31] and love and freedom and and and and
[1:15:35] joy, not scared of where he was going
[1:15:38] because he died many years before.
[1:15:42] He had died the death of a righteous
[1:15:45] man. Now he's just going home. Amen.
[1:15:49] Those who die the death of a righteous
[1:15:51] man when they die and Christ lives in
[1:15:53] them.
[1:15:54] They are not scared of what is coming.
[1:15:56] They are just going home.
[1:15:58] They are ready to go home.
[1:16:00] Friends, this is if there was a time
[1:16:02] that you have to be ready to go home.
[1:16:04] This is the time.
[1:16:05] You can see how the world is waiting for
[1:16:08] the what they know.
[1:16:12] Nations are on their tent hooks
[1:16:16] financially,
[1:16:18] politically
[1:16:21] security wise. We are at the end.
[1:16:28] You can't save the world.
[1:16:31] America cannot be redeemed anymore.
[1:16:35] Not even Europe, not even Africa, not
[1:16:37] even Russia, nowhere. It's just the end.
[1:16:43] But who is holding it?
[1:16:45] You.
[1:16:50] Because you have to get out of here.
[1:16:55] And if you are an elect, then God is
[1:16:58] wanting you to die the death of a
[1:17:00] righteous man. Die out completely.
[1:17:04] Be ready to go.
[1:17:06] He cannot take you until you are ready
[1:17:08] to go. And that's why the Bible says the
[1:17:11] Lo is not slack concerning the promise
[1:17:14] of taking us home. But he's not willing
[1:17:17] being that God of love that any of us
[1:17:19] should perish.
[1:17:23] But that we should all come to the
[1:17:25] fullness of perfection.
[1:17:29] Let me read you something final here.
[1:17:31] when you come here
[1:17:38] I think it's in the message adoption
[1:17:42] he says the other day what happened to
[1:17:44] me that morning
[1:17:47] I don't know I can't say yet whether I
[1:17:52] was whether I was here at my body or I
[1:17:55] had just seen a vision or whether I was
[1:17:57] taken away from here over there I don't
[1:18:00] Excuse
[1:18:04] me.
[1:18:06] I don't know. I can't say.
[1:18:09] So he says the only thing that I know
[1:18:15] that I was always afraid of dying.
[1:18:21] Uhhuh.
[1:18:23] You are only afraid of dying
[1:18:27] when something has not happened.
[1:18:31] And the prophet is say I was that means
[1:18:34] by that time he was no longer afraid.
[1:18:42] I was always afraid of dying that little
[1:18:44] place of of sting but not afraid Jesus
[1:18:48] would would come to get me now. I was
[1:18:52] afraid of that cuz I didn't fear that.
[1:18:55] That is mean I didn't fear to meet
[1:18:57] Jesus. But if I would meet you, it just
[1:19:01] be a little old mist flying out through
[1:19:03] the air.
[1:19:05] But I see now when I seen those people,
[1:19:09] they were real. And they were people who
[1:19:13] were once associated with me here on
[1:19:15] earth. Even to my first wife, she wasn't
[1:19:19] my wife. She was my sister. She never
[1:19:22] called me her husband. She called me her
[1:19:25] darling brother.
[1:19:28] There was no sex, no feelings of that
[1:19:30] type. It couldn't be. It was perfect. It
[1:19:33] was sweetness. It was perfection.
[1:19:39] And I'm wondering, I don't know. I'm
[1:19:41] wondering, is that what she seen before
[1:19:44] she left the earth?
[1:19:48] when she was yonder in the hospital when
[1:19:51] I called her and she said Billy listen
[1:19:54] to this
[1:19:56] you have preached it you've talked about
[1:19:59] it but she said you don't know what it
[1:20:03] is
[1:20:05] she said I have no more desire to stay
[1:20:09] here
[1:20:12] at 20 years something
[1:20:14] this young woman hope
[1:20:17] is willing to go. Says I have no more
[1:20:21] desire to stay because she had seen
[1:20:27] where she was going.
[1:20:30] And brother Brham was given the same
[1:20:32] privilege to see past the curtain of
[1:20:35] time
[1:20:37] that she never feared. Now listen,
[1:20:39] brother Brham has been taken to two
[1:20:41] curtains. He has seen the curtain of
[1:20:43] hell
[1:20:44] beyond the curtain of hell and he told
[1:20:47] us what is there and then he also sees
[1:20:51] past the curtain of time and tells us.
[1:20:55] So now
[1:20:58] what is your ending?
[1:21:02] How are you ending here? Are you ending
[1:21:05] like you are scared of rapture? You are
[1:21:08] scared of going home. You are scared of
[1:21:11] the world ending. You are squaring of
[1:21:13] America getting collapsing. Scared of
[1:21:16] this world collapsing.
[1:21:20] How are you ending?
[1:21:25] Are you ending the ending of a righteous
[1:21:27] man? The just shall live by faith.
[1:21:34] Do you fear death?
[1:21:38] If we can't fear death, how can we fear
[1:21:41] whatever causes death?
[1:21:44] Cuz death is already conquered.
[1:21:48] So if I can't fear death, imagine people
[1:21:52] like I mean Paul and all these other
[1:21:54] people who died all those years, I don't
[1:21:57] know whether they bones still exist
[1:22:02] or whether they are just a bunch of
[1:22:03] soil.
[1:22:06] But it will be just at the
[1:22:10] when the trumpet of God shall sound
[1:22:13] in a twinkling of an eye
[1:22:16] and their bodies will be created back
[1:22:20] and the dead in Christ shall rise up
[1:22:22] fast.
[1:22:24] Think about that power
[1:22:26] in a moment. They are there.
[1:22:34] What about you who has a body?
[1:22:39] If you say I am sick, thank God that you
[1:22:42] are sick. The sickness means you are
[1:22:43] alive.
[1:22:49] You can even still pray. You can still
[1:22:51] come to church. The preacher is still
[1:22:53] there.
[1:22:54] You can still read the Bible.
[1:22:56] You can still praise and worship the
[1:22:58] Lord. What about those who are already
[1:23:00] sleeping?
[1:23:01] They have been waiting thousands of
[1:23:02] years.
[1:23:06] But they went with anticipation. They
[1:23:08] sleeped in hope.
[1:23:10] They they are waiting. They are not
[1:23:13] complaining.
[1:23:14] They are waiting for us.
[1:23:17] Imagine what the prophet was told that
[1:23:19] mom is waiting for you and the he wants
[1:23:21] to see you. His only daughter is telling
[1:23:24] mama wants to see you.
[1:23:27] They are waiting for us. Where are all
[1:23:29] his friends who who sleep? Where do they
[1:23:31] go? Very sweet sisters, very sweet
[1:23:34] brothers.
[1:23:36] They are waiting for us.
[1:23:44] So don't leave as if you are, you know,
[1:23:47] permanently here. Don't leave as if you
[1:23:50] are fixed to remain here. Your plans
[1:23:52] should just be for a a pilgrim, a
[1:23:55] stranger, a person who is passing by.
[1:24:01] And let's know that if Paul preached
[1:24:03] about rapture, all the seven, seven
[1:24:06] church ages preachers preached about
[1:24:08] rapture. What about today? How close are
[1:24:11] we to it?
[1:24:13] And the Bible says the son of man cometh
[1:24:15] in the time that he will not be looking
[1:24:17] for him.
[1:24:19] So there is this fear, there is this
[1:24:22] complacency, there is this lukewarmy
[1:24:25] coming into the church and making you
[1:24:28] settle for less
[1:24:30] doing nothing. Yet this is the time it's
[1:24:34] urgent. The message is urgent.
[1:24:36] You have to be sealed.
[1:24:40] Have the seal of God
[1:24:43] because lacking the seal of God is
[1:24:45] having the mark of the beast. The
[1:24:46] prophet said,
[1:24:51] The prophet he was saying the whole the
[1:24:53] world is full of the Holy Ghost. The
[1:24:54] skies are full of the Holy Ghost. Why
[1:24:57] are you not receiving him?
[1:25:01] Who is going to do that religion for
[1:25:03] you?
[1:25:05] Who is going to pray for you?
[1:25:08] Do you know that even the age of just
[1:25:10] say lay hands on me, lay hands on me,
[1:25:12] pray for me, cast this, shake me, you
[1:25:14] know, you want to be shaken and then you
[1:25:16] feel the physical shaking. And then the
[1:25:18] brother says was praying. I I think I
[1:25:21] felt some fire moving me and and I then
[1:25:23] I I I mean you are not a kid.
[1:25:32] You are now mature. You are a gentile
[1:25:36] bride. You are not a Jewish person who
[1:25:38] must you know like Jra said come and lay
[1:25:41] your hands upon my child. That was a
[1:25:44] sign of the Jews.
[1:25:45] But the Roman soldier gentile said speak
[1:25:48] the word.
[1:25:51] Look at that. Had he attended any sermon
[1:25:54] of the pro of Jesus? No.
[1:25:57] But that's by default
[1:26:00] the gentile faith. Speak the word.
[1:26:04] My servant will be healed. Yes.
[1:26:06] What about us who have had the word
[1:26:08] spoken until we have become the word?
[1:26:11] What is the problem?
[1:26:13] Just exert your position. Take your
[1:26:15] position. Stand as a child of God. Stand
[1:26:17] as a believer
[1:26:19] and face the future without fear.
[1:26:22] Deal with whatever is in your life
[1:26:24] without fear.
[1:26:26] Your enemy is your food. The more you
[1:26:28] conquer, the more you become stronger.
[1:26:31] The more you defeat, the more you
[1:26:34] qualify for a seat.
[1:26:36] He that overcomemeth shall I grant him
[1:26:39] to sit with me like I overcame and I'm
[1:26:41] now sat with my father.
[1:26:45] Don't be scared of rejection. Don't be
[1:26:48] scared of being hated. Don't be scared
[1:26:50] of being fought
[1:26:52] as long as he remains with you.
[1:26:56] Be only cautious of one thing. Is he
[1:26:59] here?
[1:27:03] Don't be cautious of friends.
[1:27:05] As I told you yesterday, I don't look
[1:27:07] for friends anywhere because my friends
[1:27:09] are already already part of me. I don't
[1:27:12] have to make anything to make them to do
[1:27:14] anything to make them my friends. They
[1:27:17] are already my friends by default
[1:27:19] because we were attributes together in
[1:27:21] his minds in our father. I mean in his
[1:27:24] mind before the foundation of the world.
[1:27:26] So if we were there before the world,
[1:27:29] nothing in this world can separate us.
[1:27:36] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:27:39] So now you see
[1:27:42] as I come to conclusion as we come to
[1:27:44] pray now
[1:27:47] you will look at this
[1:27:50] and understand why
[1:27:54] the go grace provided forever was to
[1:27:58] possess what you see.
[1:28:05] Not as Moses who saw but didn't possess.
[1:28:08] But in the New Testament, the first
[1:28:11] believer, what he saw is what he
[1:28:13] possessed.
[1:28:15] He went right away. So what you see in
[1:28:18] the word,
[1:28:20] what do you see in the promises?
[1:28:23] Do you see yourself sick? You'll possess
[1:28:26] sickness. Do you see yourself healed?
[1:28:28] You'll possess healing. You see yourself
[1:28:31] victorious, you'll possess victory. Do
[1:28:33] you see yourself a failure? You'll
[1:28:35] possess failure. Do you see yourself in
[1:28:37] the negative, you'll always be negative.
[1:28:39] You see yourself in the positive, you'll
[1:28:41] always be positive. You see yourself in
[1:28:43] heaven, John the B. I mean John the who
[1:28:46] wrote Revelation, he was come told to
[1:28:48] come up here
[1:28:50] and he saw himself
[1:28:54] seated. When he saw 24 elders, he was
[1:28:58] one of the 24 elders. And he saw 24
[1:29:01] elders and he looked at the book which
[1:29:04] no man was supposed to look. And one of
[1:29:06] the 24 elders says, "Don't weep, John."
[1:29:08] Who was that one? One one elder. The
[1:29:11] Theophan of himself,
[1:29:13] speaking to him, don't cry, don't weep.
[1:29:16] You come to the point where you
[1:29:18] encourage yourself. The Theophan
[1:29:20] connects to you and speaks to you and
[1:29:22] comforts you and encourages you. You
[1:29:24] come to the point that you correct
[1:29:26] yourself
[1:29:27] that you you you tell yourself this is
[1:29:29] wrong.
[1:29:30] You don't even need a pastor to correct
[1:29:32] you, a deacon to correct you, the other
[1:29:34] one to tell you, but there is a system
[1:29:35] within you that tells you this is not
[1:29:37] me, this is not me, this is not me.
[1:29:40] That's perfection. When you cannot even
[1:29:43] sleep or eat until you have put it
[1:29:45] right,
[1:29:47] that's perfection.
[1:29:48] Perfection doesn't mean not making any
[1:29:51] mistake. Perfection means no room for
[1:29:55] abiding with the mistake.
[1:29:58] Mistakes will be there. Yes.
[1:30:00] But you cannot stay with them.
[1:30:03] You can't have peace when it's there.
[1:30:05] Something is in you resisting it.
[1:30:08] You have a system in you that the Bible
[1:30:12] says no man shall tell you to know you
[1:30:14] are God. But from the beginning, from
[1:30:16] the little ones to the greatest, all of
[1:30:18] them shall know me. Amen.
[1:30:21] That's perfection.
[1:30:23] That's where we are going. And what you
[1:30:25] see when you begin to see Christ
[1:30:29] in you, you see blessings, you see
[1:30:33] victory, you see eternal life, you see,
[1:30:36] you know, heaven. You see, that's what
[1:30:39] you possess.
[1:30:43] No one is going to tell you because when
[1:30:45] Jesus stands in the skies, who is going
[1:30:48] to wake you up? Brother, the rapture is
[1:30:50] happening now.
[1:30:55] The Bible says every eye shall see him.
[1:30:59] The enlightened ones,
[1:31:02] those who are enlightened,
[1:31:04] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:31:06] So
[1:31:10] we shouldn't sit idle.
[1:31:14] We should go to that place where others
[1:31:17] are scared to go.
[1:31:21] Preach the things that others don't want
[1:31:24] to preach.
[1:31:26] Believe the things that others don't
[1:31:29] want to believe.
[1:31:31] That's what makes you the bride.
[1:31:34] Are you ready to take on the challenge
[1:31:37] to believe what others shy away from?
[1:31:40] to receive the fullness of him that
[1:31:43] loved you, that died for you to die out.
[1:31:48] Come on, you young girls. This world is
[1:31:51] very wicked and terrible now.
[1:31:55] And the devil is pumping you with a lot
[1:31:58] of intellectualism,
[1:31:59] resistance.
[1:32:02] And it is tailored. The whole system in
[1:32:04] the world is now tailored to rebellion
[1:32:08] that you come to a point 14 years, 15
[1:32:11] years above. You begin to walk like you
[1:32:13] have springs in your knees and
[1:32:16] everywhere you are prancouncing around
[1:32:17] and you feel like what will mama have to
[1:32:19] tell me?
[1:32:21] What will daddy have to tell me? This
[1:32:24] old man here is he's living in the
[1:32:26] yesterday years.
[1:32:35] You need more of him 10 times than your
[1:32:39] father.
[1:32:40] The prophet said each age has more
[1:32:44] trials 10 times.
[1:32:48] But you look at it, the more we have
[1:32:51] more trials, the more weaker we have
[1:32:53] become. You young people, how many times
[1:32:57] do you kneel by yourself in your bedroom
[1:33:00] and pray to God?
[1:33:04] Even waking up to pray in the morning or
[1:33:06] in the night, they have just come, come,
[1:33:08] they have to remind you.
[1:33:12] How are you going to overcome?
[1:33:14] You want to sit there idle and you think
[1:33:17] your business is eating pie and this and
[1:33:19] that
[1:33:21] chocolate.
[1:33:26] That is not why we are here. Everybody
[1:33:28] in the world is eating those things but
[1:33:31] they are eating to grow. Growing to get
[1:33:34] old getting old to die.
[1:33:37] So in essence you are just struggling to
[1:33:39] die.
[1:33:45] the death of a fool.
[1:33:49] There's no God. Don't tell me things
[1:33:51] about the God. Don't tell me things
[1:33:53] about the Bible. Don't tell me things
[1:33:55] about the message. Don't tell me this
[1:33:56] this laws. Law legalism. I don't want
[1:33:59] legalism. But Jesus said, "If you love
[1:34:01] me, keep my commandments."
[1:34:04] What were the commandments? The word.
[1:34:09] If you love him, keep his word.
[1:34:14] May God bless you. Let's stand up.
[1:34:23] You let me as I say let's stand up. Let
[1:34:26] me hope you are not going to be stubborn
[1:34:27] to not stand up. Cuz you see sometimes
[1:34:31] when the song leader say let's clap.
[1:34:33] Some people don't want to clap. Let's
[1:34:35] stand. Others sit down. And the Holy
[1:34:38] Ghost is say lift up your hand. If you
[1:34:40] have a problem for you, you don't lift.
[1:34:42] And yet you have a problem. So how do
[1:34:44] you think God is going to help you?
[1:34:48] Or you lift like this.
[1:34:54] You're not even sure what you do. You
[1:34:56] are stubborn in the house of the Lord.
[1:35:01] Let's be flexible.
[1:35:03] In the beginning was the word. Yes. But
[1:35:05] there was flexibility. When God said,
[1:35:07] "Let there be." There was no ayat of
[1:35:09] unbelief to resist it.
[1:35:11] There was no disobedience.
[1:35:17] So as we humble ourselves, closing our
[1:35:20] eyes,
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:23] just think about it. This could be your
[1:35:25] last day, maybe my last day to preach or
[1:35:28] your last day to be in church to hear.
[1:35:31] What if we are going home? If there's a
[1:35:33] rapture going to take place this evening
[1:35:37] this afternoon,
[1:35:40] are you sure you're going?
[1:35:43] Are you ready?
[1:35:46] Is your ending victorious over the enemy
[1:35:50] or the enemy has defeated you, has
[1:35:53] bogged you down.
[1:35:57] How do you feel in your heart?
[1:36:01] Is he in there?
[1:36:04] Are you dead to the world or you are
[1:36:07] struggling with those lusts and desires
[1:36:10] for the worldly things?
[1:36:15] What is your reaction to the word? Are
[1:36:18] you rebellious,
[1:36:20] intransiggent, rigged, hard-hearted,
[1:36:24] or you feel that indeed you are a heart
[1:36:26] of flesh
[1:36:28] that the sword of the word pierces
[1:36:30] through?
[1:36:32] Are you ready to be broken and molded
[1:36:35] into his image?
[1:36:39] If you are not, friend,
[1:36:42] this is your time.
[1:36:46] He is here
[1:36:48] to help you.
[1:36:52] Just believe in your heart. Confess in
[1:36:54] your heart. Say, "Lord Jesus, help me.
[1:36:59] Complete the work that you began in me.
[1:37:01] I never called myself. You called me."
[1:37:04] You have the reason why you called me.
[1:37:07] Maybe I was born in a family where my
[1:37:09] parents are believers. How many children
[1:37:12] are born in homes of pagans, atheists
[1:37:16] who don't even want to hear about God?
[1:37:20] And why would I spit in your face by
[1:37:24] being re rebellious,
[1:37:27] rejecting
[1:37:30] what you've laid on my laps?
[1:37:33] What will I say?
[1:37:36] Maybe you are here sick.
[1:37:39] What are you doing about it? He's here,
[1:37:42] brother. He's here, sister.
[1:37:44] And this prayer that I'm praying. Oh,
[1:37:47] I'm going to pray. I remember when I
[1:37:50] prayed in Norway one time and that deaf
[1:37:52] woman had we never laid hands on
[1:37:55] anybody. I mean, God can do anything.
[1:38:00] He's here. He's omnipresent, omnisient,
[1:38:03] omotent.
[1:38:05] He asks no one permission to help you,
[1:38:09] to change you, but he's just looking at
[1:38:12] how tender your heart is, how humble
[1:38:15] you, how broken you are, you are. That's
[1:38:18] one weakness of God. God can't stand a
[1:38:21] broken heart. He can't stand someone who
[1:38:24] is repenting. He will always help that
[1:38:26] person.
[1:38:30] Just open up your heart and believe God
[1:38:33] for whatever you want him to do this
[1:38:35] morning and lift up your hand in faith
[1:38:38] as we pray. Loving heavenly father,
[1:38:43] we indeed have no excuse because we are
[1:38:47] living in the days that Lord the
[1:38:49] handwriting is on the wall for time.
[1:38:52] Every radio, every newspaper
[1:38:56] is speaking about the signs of the end.
[1:39:00] And there's nothing that we are asking
[1:39:02] whether or not has been fulfilled.
[1:39:05] The world is ripe for judgment.
[1:39:08] The nations are ripe for judgment.
[1:39:11] The denominations are dead long ago,
[1:39:14] rotten.
[1:39:16] And here we are, Lord. Have mercy upon
[1:39:18] us. a struggling church, a struggling
[1:39:21] believers. Lord, a board of people who
[1:39:24] are supposed to know better
[1:39:26] that we are still pulling and cursing,
[1:39:29] arguing, doubting,
[1:39:32] failing to go to possess that which
[1:39:35] belongs to us. Help us Lord not to be
[1:39:39] like the two tribes and a half
[1:39:42] that wanted their portion this society
[1:39:46] because it was comfortable for them.
[1:39:49] They didn't go they didn't want to go
[1:39:51] God's way. They thought they can create
[1:39:54] their own way in God's program.
[1:39:58] Help us Lord to know that in Cananan
[1:40:01] where the giants are where the demons
[1:40:04] that we are scared of the diseases the
[1:40:07] afflictions the the the the tormenting
[1:40:10] forces that's our land which flowth with
[1:40:14] milk and honey that's what our victory
[1:40:17] lies
[1:40:19] and we must take it whether it's little
[1:40:22] by little or lumpsum we have to take it
[1:40:25] yes
[1:40:27] help us Lord not to just
[1:40:31] surrender to fate and settle for less
[1:40:34] but Lord God and take all that belongs
[1:40:38] to us otherwise we'll be spitting in
[1:40:42] your face on Calvary why did you die why
[1:40:46] did you suffer you suffer and say it's
[1:40:49] finished and by your stripes we are
[1:40:51] healed
[1:40:53] so if we are healed then let there be a
[1:40:56] manifestation of at healing
[1:40:58] and Lucifer, Satan, you are defeated in
[1:41:01] the name of Jesus. I rebuke any demon
[1:41:04] here. Any disease, any affliction, any
[1:41:08] kind of spirit that had long possessed
[1:41:10] and bogged down and chained and shackled
[1:41:13] the children of God, I rebuke it out.
[1:41:17] You can't call God's children anymore.
[1:41:19] and demons of fear that had gripped the
[1:41:22] people that had failed people that I
[1:41:25] held them in their tracks that they have
[1:41:27] failed to go possess what belongs to
[1:41:29] them. May they be defeated this day.
[1:41:33] Lord come down and bless your people.
[1:41:36] Help us, strengthen us, fill us,
[1:41:38] transform us, bring us, Lord, go to that
[1:41:41] stature of the fullness of Christ.
[1:41:45] Christ in us the hope of glory. Bless
[1:41:48] the ministry here. Bless Pastor Eron,
[1:41:50] your servant, his wife, his family, the
[1:41:54] deacons, the trustees, the believers,
[1:41:57] all those who are part of the ministry
[1:41:59] here. Bless all the churches here in
[1:42:01] Phoenix
[1:42:02] and around the world.
[1:42:04] We need you, Lord, at this hour.
[1:42:07] Help us, Lord, to understand the move of
[1:42:10] God at this hour. what you want to be
[1:42:13] done because the bride has the mind of
[1:42:16] God and she knows what he wants done
[1:42:20] with his word. Help us Lord. I commit
[1:42:23] each and everyone into your hands as
[1:42:25] your servant in Jesus name I pray.
[1:42:29] Amen.
