[0:00] turn in our Bibles 1 Corinthians
[0:03] uh
[0:05] chapter 11 and verse 1. And before we
[0:08] get started, I you know, we count this a
[0:11] privilege, your pastor, our brother, as
[0:14] he's away, he sends his love and
[0:16] greetings. I think that goes unspoken,
[0:18] though. Um but he did want us to be
[0:21] careful to mention that. And I know
[0:23] there's uh our church back home in in
[0:26] Texas is also sends their love and
[0:28] greetings. represent the body there and
[0:31] and bring those as well. Let's just
[0:33] read. It's going to be a short reading.
[0:34] We'll have you be seated. 1 Corinthians
[0:37] 11 and verse one. Be ye followers of me
[0:40] even as I also am of Christ. I just ask
[0:44] the Lord to bless the word and you be
[0:46] seated. And just in this reading, I
[0:49] think there's a lot that could be
[0:50] conveyed. And it's to us as believers to
[0:52] recognize this is a pattern that we uh
[0:56] each would have in our own lives that we
[0:58] would believe that we can say to others
[1:00] that we're following after Christ. And
[1:02] as we follow after Christ, we would want
[1:04] to be an example. We would want to we
[1:06] would want to be uh aware that as we
[1:10] reflect him to others, that is a gospel
[1:13] that's written. your your written
[1:15] epistles read of all men that you are uh
[1:19] you have this authority of the word
[1:21] where you could say follow me as I
[1:24] follow Christ and I would say in this
[1:26] even in no other age can we understand
[1:29] that we have the privilege of knowing
[1:31] the very heartbeat the very mind of
[1:33] Christ to know what he wants done with
[1:35] the word and we should absolutely have a
[1:38] confidence in what uh we're representing
[1:42] and and to that just to keep a subject
[1:45] and maybe to to follow along and keep
[1:47] myself along the thought. But you pull
[1:49] on the word. I believe we can minister
[1:51] to however the Lord would. But it's a
[1:54] sacred trust. So if I I was going to
[1:56] give this a title, I'd say you have a
[1:58] sacred trust. There's been something
[2:00] given to you that you have the ability
[2:03] to impart eternal life and also you've
[2:06] been it is God's very heart intent to
[2:10] reflect his image in you. So that that
[2:13] is a that is a sacred trust. You're a
[2:16] bedding ground. You're you're something
[2:18] that's going to reflect an image.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; And uh we just want to fellowship along
[2:22] that thought as we would uh if you would
[2:25] turn in Proverbs those who will do it uh
[2:27] in a way maybe we give you a chance to
[2:30] turn. Proverbs uh chapter 18 verse 20
[2:36] speaks of this uh if you will
[2:40] responsibility
[2:43] death and life are in the power of the
[2:46] tongue 18:21
[2:49] and they that love it shall eat the
[2:51] fruit thereof. So it in your words is
[2:54] the power of death in life. the the very
[2:57] things you say the the and profess the
[2:59] things you put on your lip have the
[3:01] power to impart death and impart life.
[3:06] This is not a just to lay a foundation.
[3:09] This is not something that is is uh
[3:13] should be foreign to us. This should be
[3:15] the confidence really that we have in
[3:18] why we would even say you know be still.
[3:20] If you don't know what to say just be
[3:22] still. uh guard your heart, guard your
[3:25] tongue, guard your heart because it is
[3:27] from the heart, right? The that the
[3:30] mouth speaketh. So we don't want to just
[3:34] think that idle words have power. It is
[3:37] really the things that have gone to seed
[3:39] in our hearts that's going to come up
[3:42] from our belly and out of our mouths.
[3:44] And it has life in it.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; It's it's when you speak from experience
[3:49] that you know that it means something.
[3:52] You know, when you say, "I know God's a
[3:54] healer," that in itself has power in it.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; The testimony of the tongue and what you
[4:01] say that you know God to be a is really
[4:05] what you're responsible to.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; And as you're faithful in little, God
[4:09] will add, but be faithful to the little
[4:12] that you know.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; You know God to be real.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; And you can testify to that portion of
[4:18] it. And it is in the testifying that you
[4:21] are fulfilling that sacred trust. As
[4:25] just as much as Adam was given the
[4:27] commandment to go and to tend to the
[4:30] land and to till it, you have the same
[4:32] authority. God wants to see you as
[4:35] little messiahes going out into the
[4:37] world that you've been given tending to
[4:40] those things. When you see weeds coming
[4:42] up, you have the authority to rebuke the
[4:45] weed, to prune the weed in your life, in
[4:49] your own life, and in your the
[4:50] atmosphere, the dominion in the kingdom
[4:52] of God. That's yours. Mark 16:15 would
[4:56] say it like this. This is the great
[4:57] commission. This is this is the
[5:00] authority really that uh establishes us
[5:03] and what we're doing. Uh it would read,
[5:06] "And he said unto them, go ye into all
[5:09] the world and preach the gospel to every
[5:12] creature. He that believeth and is
[5:14] baptized shall be saved, but he that
[5:17] believeth not shall be damned." So it is
[5:20] in the preaching, it is in the
[5:22] ministering, it is in the giving of the
[5:24] words of life that it could be accepted
[5:26] or rejected.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; You know, it it would do no good to hide
[5:30] your light underneath a bushel. I know
[5:33] this is basic Christianity, but I I want
[5:35] you to understand that it is the uh
[5:38] we've been paralyzed by the scarecrow.
[5:43] We're not handing out denominational
[5:46] belieism. I just believe I'm not trying
[5:49] to convince you of the way I believe,
[5:52] but I'm imparting life. And if we
[5:55] understand what we possess, that we're
[5:57] possessing the very life, the very
[5:59] salvation, the very thing people need to
[6:01] make it, we would be more convinced and
[6:04] concerned.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; You if you do not share what you have,
[6:08] then people are hopeless.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; They're lost. And it's in the manner of
[6:12] living. It's not just in word only
[6:15] because it wasn't that the people would
[6:17] just believe, but and these signs shall
[6:19] follow them that believe. So in your
[6:22] heart, you're converted. You believe.
[6:25] You know these things to be true. And
[6:27] you're testifying to you knowing a risen
[6:29] savior, someone who's changed your life.
[6:32] In my name, they shall cast out devils.
[6:34] They shall speak with new tongues. They
[6:36] shall take up serpents and they shall
[6:38] drink any deadly thing and it shall not
[6:41] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[6:43] sick and they shall recover. That is not
[6:45] a God of the pulpit only.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. That's the authority the
[6:50] word is is is brought in and that is
[6:52] here. But that is to the individual.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; You have that authority that it's given
[6:58] to you to minister life.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; And when you see the enemy come in,
[7:02] we've been given dominion. Out of all
[7:04] the ages that anybody wanted to live in,
[7:06] it is this age.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; God wants to move through his word and
[7:10] prove it to be true to a lost and dying
[7:13] world.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; How great the darkness. Yeah.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; If we were to just even sit here and
[7:18] look at the millions of people groping
[7:21] in darkness, you possess the very way of
[7:24] salvation, of deliverance from the
[7:27] things that would bind. I I'm and I'm
[7:29] telling you, there's nothing too hard
[7:31] for our God.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; That Satan hasn't managed to con concoct
[7:36] any atmosphere, any imagination, any
[7:40] reasoning, any uh anything that God
[7:43] doesn't know how to find the individual.
[7:46] because he's a a good shepherd that'll
[7:48] leave the 99 and seek the one.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; You may think that you can imagine your
[7:54] way into a place and you're just waiting
[7:56] to get there as soon as church is over.
[7:58] I'm going to go see what my friend's
[8:00] done here and I'm going to go play my
[8:01] game here and I'm going to join the chat
[8:03] and this game and I just can't wait to
[8:05] get there. He knows where you're at.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly where. You can't create
[8:09] a little world and go live on it that he
[8:11] can't find you.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Because David would say, "Though I make
[8:14] my bed in hell,
[8:16] &gt;&gt; thou art there." So, you could be in the
[8:18] very pits of of Satan's snare, and my
[8:21] God knows how to bring you out.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; I'm here to witness that. I know that to
[8:27] be true for myself. He's a he he's a a
[8:30] loving shepherd. So as we look at this,
[8:33] it is
[8:35] in the partaking of the divine nature
[8:37] that you have something to give.
[8:40] But it's also because of that that Satan
[8:43] will do everything he can do to keep you
[8:46] from doing just that. And we're not
[8:49] naive to these things because we've seen
[8:51] his tactics in this day. It's exposed.
[8:54] We see the son of predition. The same
[8:56] way he deals with the church, he deals
[8:58] with the individual. We know how in each
[9:00] age he came against the church and those
[9:03] same tactics he will use against you
[9:06] &gt;&gt; as the individual. So you want to be
[9:09] aware of the enemy. this message through
[9:12] God's prophet tells us Satan and his in
[9:15] his tactics and reading in in
[9:17] Philippians I I want to impress this
[9:20] this Philippians 1:27
[9:22] only let your conversation at it as it
[9:25] becometh the gospel of Christ that
[9:28] whether I come and see you or else be
[9:31] absent I might hear of your affairs that
[9:34] ye stand fast in one spirit with one
[9:37] mind striving together in the faith of
[9:40] the gospel Isn't that a beautiful
[9:42] picture of the body of Christ? This this
[9:44] conversation isn't just a measure of
[9:46] words. This isn't something that
[9:50] David, I've only managed to say I I
[9:53] stayed out of the news. I didn't discuss
[9:55] the latest political uh topics, but I've
[9:58] only managed to talk about the things of
[10:00] God. That's not just the conversation
[10:03] that's being spoken of here, but this is
[10:05] your manner of living, the things that
[10:08] you do, how you handle things. That's
[10:11] the greatest testimony. What what you
[10:13] got to be aware of is when the when the
[10:15] opportunity comes to react badly because
[10:18] every excuse has been given to you. The
[10:21] person's done you wrong. You you need
[10:23] better service. The the food was cold.
[10:26] And and I find this true in my own life.
[10:28] the the very times where it feels like
[10:30] sometimes I just almost come short is
[10:34] really when it was the greatest
[10:35] opportunity to live a testimony.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; The food being cold really wasn't that
[10:40] important. I could have recognized what
[10:43] the right response could have been to
[10:45] those around me.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to be aware of.
[10:48] It's our when I say conversation, how do
[10:51] we handle just the daytoday things?
[10:55] &gt;&gt; That's your mannerisms. That's your
[10:56] conversation. That's your pattern of
[10:58] good works. That's waking up in the
[11:00] morning and putting God first. Those are
[11:02] the things that people see. And we want
[11:05] to establish as uh a pattern of good
[11:08] works or a conversation. That's a manner
[11:10] of living. The amplified would read it
[11:12] like this. Only be sure as citizens so
[11:16] to conduct yourselves that your manner
[11:18] of life will be worthy of the good news,
[11:22] the gospel of Christ, so that whether I
[11:25] do come and see you or am absent may
[11:29] hear this of you. So it is uh it is how
[11:33] others see you
[11:36] that we want to be aware of
[11:39] &gt;&gt; because we want them to inquire what is
[11:41] the hope? Why are you different? Why do
[11:45] you not do the things others do? Why do
[11:48] you not look at that?
[11:51] I've noticed you're different. You turn
[11:53] your head. That's a testimony. That's
[11:57] something that people notice. But what
[11:59] is that? That's now a door. That's that
[12:02] you your your manner of living and your
[12:04] conduct as simple as it was proc was
[12:07] salty enough to portray Christ. But now
[12:10] you can witness what the hope of your
[12:13] calling is.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; So it's that's the and what I mean by
[12:18] that is so many times we take the power
[12:20] of the gospel and we we want to just
[12:22] leave it to the fin the the the the
[12:24] fantastic things the raising of the dead
[12:28] the healing of cancer and those things
[12:30] we do
[12:31] &gt;&gt; but I would say just as much a miracle
[12:34] is you living an overcoming victorious
[12:36] Christian life. That's the true power of
[12:38] the gospel that many deny because many
[12:41] come to him in that day and say, "Have I
[12:42] not? Have I not? Have I not?" And he
[12:44] says, "I never knew you." What did they
[12:46] really do at the end of the day? They
[12:47] denied the Christ. They denied the power
[12:50] of God to live an overcoming, victorious
[12:52] life. Because it's not just about
[12:53] miracles. It's about putting Jesus
[12:56] Christ on display every day.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; This is out of the there's one way
[13:01] provided, God's provided way. It says
[13:04] God's word is the seed. Jesus said that
[13:07] the word of God was a seed that is the
[13:10] swer swed. This is the only seed that
[13:12] will produce eternal life. Now we can
[13:15] have all other kinds of lives. Church
[13:18] life, home life, family life, national
[13:20] life, but the only eternal life comes
[13:23] through God's word. That's the only seed
[13:25] that can produce eternal life. And I
[13:28] want to tell you, there's many people
[13:30] living different lives. The life
[13:32] testifies to it. They're caught up with
[13:35] their job. They're living a work life.
[13:37] That's simply what they have. They come
[13:39] home and they testify my work.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; It was work. It was work. It was work.
[13:44] My work is the reason I live the life I
[13:46] live. They It's politics. It's it's, you
[13:49] know, America first. We got to do
[13:51] better. And their life testifies. That's
[13:54] the life that they're living. They're
[13:55] living a life. And it testifies by the
[13:59] things that they care about, the things
[14:01] that they do. Well, how much more as the
[14:03] bride of Christ do we live the life of
[14:06] Christ, the victory that he's given us,
[14:08] the joy in knowing that we're where
[14:10] we're going. And I want to remind you,
[14:12] we're not staying here. This isn't the
[14:15] life we're living for.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Everything that he's promised us, we're
[14:20] is is beyond this temporal reality.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; That's the testimony we have. If we
[14:26] don't portray that and we are not
[14:28] showing that reality to be real and the
[14:32] and the strength in knowing that is the
[14:34] joy of your salvation. Satan wants to
[14:36] cut the joy of your salvation off. He
[14:38] wants to choke it out by the cares of
[14:40] this life. He wants to make you think
[14:41] the devil's actually got power and
[14:43] authority and he has none.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; The devil can't take you before it's
[14:47] your time. I don't care how much the
[14:49] calamity is. I don't care how though war
[14:51] should rise in this. I'll be confident.
[14:54] When David said that, he was a man who
[14:56] saw the calamity of war. War is a
[14:59] destructive thing. You think of Ukraine.
[15:01] You think of national force. You think
[15:03] of how it would be to to be powerless
[15:06] before an army coming before you saying,
[15:08] "I've got my bombs. I've got my weapons.
[15:11] I can take your life." And you could
[15:13] stand there and say, "No, you can't do
[15:15] it." Just like you can't do it unless my
[15:18] father allowed it.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; And and as sons and daughters of God,
[15:21] Satan can't touch a hair on your head.
[15:24] without going through God.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; You can be sure of that.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; We can't let the things of this world
[15:30] dampen the confidence we have in the
[15:32] Lord Jesus Christ.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; He knows you and he's keeping you. The
[15:36] the contrast though is that when you're
[15:39] not
[15:41] living in that reality, and I would say
[15:43] it's very easy to be drawn back out of
[15:46] the confidence and the assurity we have
[15:48] in Christ Jesus because we get shocked.
[15:51] Sure,
[15:53] &gt;&gt; we can get shocked in denominational
[15:56] thinking, thinking that we could just
[15:57] settle for just believing it the way I
[16:00] don't want to just settle with easy
[16:02] belieism.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; I want to see my God come real on the
[16:06] scene.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; I I want to know that in my situation,
[16:09] he's a present help in the time of need.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; And I don't have to settle for him not
[16:14] showing up. I can be if God be for us,
[16:17] where be all the miracles? If there's a
[16:19] desire in me to see more of God, there's
[16:21] more of God to be had. And I could tell
[16:23] you why I know that is because the
[16:25] sheathwave offering that came in this
[16:27] day that said Jesus Christ is the same
[16:29] yesterday, today, and forever.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; I I that's whose pasture I'm in.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; That's my shepherd.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; But it's the it's the the interbreeding.
[16:43] It's the It's the hybriding. It's the
[16:45] cutting off of the joy. It's the It's
[16:47] the things that try to take that blessed
[16:49] assurance away from you that will cause
[16:52] you to to think you're meeting the mark.
[16:57] And what you've done is you've just kind
[16:58] of well, I believe it. I'm okay.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; And that's not what we're called to in
[17:04] this hour. It's complete victory.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; And it's a privilege.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; So the it it back to the sacred trust. I
[17:11] think these things will drive it home. I
[17:14] we know that God's word is the vehicle
[17:17] through which he imparts eternal life.
[17:19] He framed the world to it. We we say
[17:20] God's word and we mean it in the
[17:23] simplicity of God's word. This
[17:24] vindicated word that he looked out and
[17:26] wrote over by the Holy Spirit moving
[17:28] upon men. But it's not just in word
[17:30] only, right? But it's through power and
[17:33] demonstration. It's through the life of
[17:35] the word. And that is in you.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; And God wants to prove his word a
[17:41] reality. That is why the prosperity
[17:44] gospel works,
[17:46] okay? Is God does good to those who
[17:49] despitefully use him and he so desires
[17:51] that man would know who they are by
[17:55] showing who he is
[17:57] because we are made in his image.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; You know that this message tells us some
[18:02] beautiful things about who we are that
[18:04] you will find nowhere else.
[18:07] You are made in the image of God. Before
[18:09] Adam was even formed out of the flesh,
[18:12] he was made spirit man in the image of
[18:14] God. And you have that theophony
[18:17] representation, the very the the life of
[18:19] his life.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; You were with him before the foundation
[18:23] of the world.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; That's the life you have. That's what's
[18:26] desiring to be declared. And I got to
[18:28] tell you, this body can't stop it.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; You though the skin worms eat this
[18:35] flesh. You could do whatever you want.
[18:37] You could destroy this body, but the
[18:39] life of Christ in me cannot be
[18:41] destroyed. It's as eternal as God is
[18:44] eternal. And I want to declare it. But
[18:46] what the thought I want to try to get to
[18:48] is is that this is God's plan was to
[18:51] have a preeminence in the people. We're
[18:53] in the day where he wants to make known
[18:56] what it looks like God in human flesh.
[18:58] That's the sacred trust that we're we're
[19:00] manifesting. This is uh this is out of
[19:04] the sermon. You could probably find it.
[19:06] The Comforter 61, October 1st, the
[19:09] evening. I'm going to take a text here
[19:11] from uh the reading from paragraph 55.
[19:15] Actually,
[19:18] I might back up. I don't know if I read
[19:20] this earlier.
[19:23] This is in 52.
[19:25] And if I read it, we're going to read it
[19:27] again. Now, we have a sacred trust. You
[19:30] know what a trust is. And we have an
[19:34] inheritance, a heritage that we inherit
[19:37] as believing children. It's a sacred
[19:40] trust. And that sacred trust and our
[19:43] sacred heritage is the word of God
[19:46] that's been given to us. The full word
[19:48] of God. The word itself is the vitamin.
[19:52] The word itself, God's word.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it is a privilege to
[19:58] have the full word of God. Not a partial
[20:01] light, not something the enemy's been
[20:03] able to come in and put through the
[20:05] cycle of revival and death, but you are
[20:08] sitting in the hour where the word comes
[20:10] to full maturity.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; It's rapture time.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; This isn't a partial word with you're
[20:17] you're not just stuck under
[20:18] sanctification
[20:19] as powerful as it is. You're not just s
[20:22] stuck under a justification knowing that
[20:25] blessed is he who the Lord doesn't
[20:27] impute iniquity. I know that it's I've
[20:29] been forgiven. But in this day, we
[20:30] understand justification as though
[20:32] you've never did it in the first place.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; That how could you when he already took
[20:37] a picture of you before the foundation
[20:38] of the world?
[20:40] &gt;&gt; That you are in the eternal thoughts of
[20:42] God.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; That's our that's our inheritance.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Just moving on down.
[20:57] God's word is a seed. We read that,
[21:00] pardon me. It is our privilege. It's the
[21:02] sacred trust. This is in 55. That God
[21:05] has put in his church. God gave his word
[21:07] to his church. And that sacred heritage
[21:10] is ours. It's a gift from God. Not just
[21:14] to compromise on this and cut this out
[21:16] and throw this out and add this in to
[21:19] suit our own taste, but to preach the
[21:22] full word.
[21:24] And and just to understand what I would
[21:27] even desire to to to convey is it it's
[21:31] really the the word of God is of no
[21:33] private interpretation
[21:37] &gt;&gt; and and what we really want to display
[21:40] is Christ
[21:42] and not my
[21:44] dogmatic way of carrying the message and
[21:47] its truths and and and uh bless God or
[21:51] and even in and I would say even in the
[21:54] right way of authority. But it and it
[21:57] should be carried that way. This isn't a
[21:59] compromising wishy-washy gospel.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; So I don't mean to demean that, but I
[22:03] mean the nature
[22:05] &gt;&gt; in which it was brought in.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; I don't need to add my own flavor to it.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; But if I could convey to you who I've
[22:13] met
[22:15] &gt;&gt; and how he changed my life,
[22:19] &gt;&gt; that's what can make the difference. So
[22:21] it's not through the abundance of words.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Little sisters, little brothers, you can
[22:27] display a lot of times a lot more Christ
[22:29] than the the adults can
[22:32] &gt;&gt; because you have a tender heart and you
[22:34] have a nature that he's pleased to draw
[22:37] nigh to. And we could do a lot better
[22:39] with our ability to humble ourselves
[22:42] because what did he say? I suffer the
[22:44] little ones to come unto me. We can get
[22:46] off our high horses and get a little
[22:48] little a lot of times and we that would
[22:51] do more for the kingdom of heaven than
[22:54] all of our theology.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; That's the nature and he draws near to
[23:00] that.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; We know whom we've believed in.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; We ain't guessing who he is. We haven't
[23:08] turned him into some big teddy bear. We
[23:11] don't have him god a far off. But if
[23:14] you've met him, you know that he cares
[23:18] &gt;&gt; and he's mindful
[23:20] &gt;&gt; and he wants to wash your feet. He wants
[23:23] to take the dirt off. He knows where
[23:25] you've been. He knows the things. He
[23:27] knows what it's like to be a teenager.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; He knows. And anybody that tells you
[23:34] that this gospel and the power of the
[23:35] Holy Spirit isn't enough doesn't know my
[23:38] God.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Because it's not a different life.
[23:42] It's the same life that was in Jesus
[23:44] Christ was the promise.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; So, did it overcome in Jesus Christ?
[23:49] &gt;&gt; What charge are you laying to my Lord?
[23:52] Are you saying that Jesus Christ was a
[23:54] flawed teenager?
[23:56] &gt;&gt; That he bore the likeness of sinful
[23:58] flesh in vain? That what was in him just
[24:00] didn't have the power to overcome?
[24:03] And that if he would have just had a
[24:05] good philosophy and a theology, it might
[24:08] have been better. But no, it was the
[24:10] life of Christ that was deity in flesh.
[24:14] And the promise was that the same life
[24:16] that was in Jesus Christ can quicken
[24:18] this mortal body.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; That he that he that raised Christ from
[24:22] the dead, if he dwell in me,
[24:24] &gt;&gt; that I can live. That it's no longer I
[24:27] that liveth,
[24:28] &gt;&gt; that Christ that liveth in me. We can't
[24:30] bypass the death.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; And that's daily.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. If
[24:36] anything, the the when you say you're
[24:38] taking out the flavor,
[24:42] it's we just got to die.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; We just got to die
[24:50] &gt;&gt; because so many times our pride wants to
[24:52] just take the word and just put it the
[24:54] way we want to kind of carry it.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; You know, we want to carry it this way.
[24:58] It's less offensive. You know, we want
[25:01] to carry it this way because we don't
[25:02] have to die. We can hang on to this. you
[25:05] know, it's just moderation.
[25:07] We But that's not that's not the life.
[25:11] That's your flavor. So, we don't want to
[25:14] suit our own taste, but we want the full
[25:17] word.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; And that's a sacred trust. So, what
[25:20] we're, you know, wanting to recognize is
[25:24] um
[25:26] there's those who've carried this truth.
[25:29] And I believe we can look to and see our
[25:32] prophet messenger in this day carried
[25:34] the word and this truth and it was done
[25:37] in a way that really I would say if you
[25:40] want an example of the life of Christ.
[25:42] Thank the Lord for having it in a way
[25:45] that we can look to where we can hear
[25:47] the audio where you could go watch a
[25:49] video and see a man where you can
[25:51] understand that this was not your
[25:53] televangelist.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; It wasn't your aa Allen. It wasn't, you
[25:58] know, there was a lot of moves of God,
[26:01] but something that was different about
[26:03] this was the nature that it was brought
[26:05] in.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; And that's the power.
[26:12] That's I don't want to ever lose that.
[26:16] I want our lives to be so impressed that
[26:18] they could say just as they did of the
[26:20] disciples, we've perceived that these
[26:22] have been with Christ,
[26:24] &gt;&gt; ignorant and unlearned.
[26:26] But what was the effect of being in his
[26:28] presence?
[26:32] That's a virtue.
[26:34] There's a life to give and you've been
[26:36] given that.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; I have no idea where we're at on the
[26:40] time. You guys hide the clocks around
[26:42] here.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; All right. I don't know what time I
[26:45] started either. So, I think someone
[26:48] asked for a two-hour sermon, so we might
[26:50] be in trouble.
[26:55] All right.
[26:57] Well,
[27:01] what time did we start? 7:30, right? So,
[27:03] we're good. Okay.
[27:06] And my my clock may be on a different
[27:08] time, so we're we're doing real good.
[27:14] But so, this is we are all Americans, I
[27:18] think. So, in the church tonight, maybe
[27:21] not. We are all American citizens. We
[27:23] are thankful to be American. Yet, but
[27:26] what happened to our American heritage?
[27:28] What was it? We began to compromise. So,
[27:32] this isn't a this isn't a new
[27:34] understanding. If you think we've
[27:37] compromised
[27:38] now, I mean, this was already the
[27:42] compromise had started.
[27:44] I I you know I I know that it was said
[27:47] recently and I don't want to necessarily
[27:49] borrow uh worldly terminology but it we
[27:53] it should behoove us to understand what
[27:55] it means to be born in a Christian
[27:57] nation.
[27:59] It really we we really should understand
[28:01] that as a nation the people who don't
[28:04] even acknowledge God are beneficiaries
[28:07] of a culture of a country that was
[28:12] raised in Christian principles
[28:16] and we're and people who deny God are
[28:19] still showing forth pieces of the
[28:22] attributes of Christianity. They can.
[28:25] Look, you could lock yourself in the
[28:27] basement and deny there's a son. It
[28:29] doesn't mean there's not a son. And you
[28:31] could say there's good without God, but
[28:33] there is none good but God. And if
[28:35] anybody is portraying any virtue, I'm
[28:38] telling you, it's because they're
[28:40] capable of reflecting the virtues of
[28:44] God.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; They can deny it, but there is nothing
[28:48] good but God.
[28:51] They may not attribute it to God, but
[28:52] they're beneficiaries of the same son
[28:54] that we're under.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; So that's a heritage.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; And just as much as someone can get
[29:02] passionate about preserving an American
[29:05] heritage, I want to awaken in you.
[29:07] You've got a sacred trust to this
[29:09] gospel.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let it be carried in a
[29:12] different flavor and a different life
[29:14] than what God wants to display.
[29:17] He wants Jesus Christ the same
[29:18] yesterday, today, and forever.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; And we know who our Christ is. He's the
[29:23] meek and the lowly. He He's the one who
[29:26] was born in a manger.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; That's our Lord.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; And we've been given the privilege to
[29:34] live that.
[29:36] God help me. God help you as Christians
[29:39] never to compromise one word of God's
[29:41] word. For this is the sacred trust that
[29:44] was handed to the church. And it's a
[29:46] glorious thing to have this gospel, the
[29:48] full gospel, to preach it without
[29:50] compromising anywhere. Preach it just as
[29:53] it is written. Leave it just as it is
[29:56] written. What a sacred trust. And if we
[29:59] ever expect this word to ever come to
[30:02] pass, if we ever expect God to keep his
[30:05] word, we've got to stay with it just the
[30:08] way God wrote it. That's the reason if
[30:11] you stay with it the way God wrote it,
[30:14] there will be all kinds of things
[30:16] happening among you. Every word will be
[30:18] fulfilled.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; It is in putting God's word first with
[30:23] an understanding
[30:25] &gt;&gt; with a a a this is the promise. He said
[30:30] &gt;&gt; that if in all my ways I acknowledge
[30:32] him, he'll direct my path.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; God can move through that.
[30:37] We're not just guessing on how to apply
[30:39] the word, but we want the word to be uh
[30:43] uh applicable.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; We want to find the practical
[30:47] applications of God's word in our life
[30:49] and then put it in practice so God can
[30:52] prove himself the yes the same. And if
[30:56] many people not knowing that they're
[30:59] using scriptural principles are applying
[31:02] it and God does he he's true to his
[31:04] word. But you want to see God come in
[31:07] the power and authority of his word, put
[31:09] it before you. Just as they just as they
[31:11] did when they came to the Jordan, they
[31:13] took the ark and they stepped. You put
[31:15] the word of God before you, it will
[31:17] light your path. It'll make a way. It'll
[31:19] it'll go through the mountain.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; That is the privilege that we have.
[31:29] And there's many mockers of it.
[31:32] There's there's a
[31:36] and this is just a way to capture it,
[31:39] but it is in surrender, right? It is in
[31:43] laying down our understanding. It is in
[31:46] truly humbling ourselves to the word of
[31:48] God because the word of God is above the
[31:50] wisdom and understanding of man. There's
[31:53] things that we would say this is the
[31:55] right decision. This is the right
[31:56] choice. And I would say if it is in
[31:58] contradiction to the word of God, cast
[32:00] that down.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Quickly,
[32:05] &gt;&gt; God will prove his word to be true. And
[32:08] he's pleased when you stand by faith
[32:10] upon his word. And that it's the faith
[32:12] in his word that ultimately what we
[32:15] ministered on last time. He's pleased by
[32:17] your faith
[32:18] &gt;&gt; in his word.
[32:21] God never used idols. He's always used
[32:23] man. God don't use machinery, mechanic
[32:27] devices. He uses man, individuals.
[32:29] Excuse me. I didn't a mean to holler
[32:32] that loud. Notice, I'm not excited,
[32:34] though. I know right where I'm at. Amen.
[32:38] Notice then this God had come down,
[32:40] great Jehovah, and was manifest himself
[32:43] through a man that they knowed it was
[32:45] more than a man. There was something
[32:47] about him that was different. And the
[32:50] people all worshiped God and believed
[32:51] God, and they built the temple. They
[32:53] done great things in that day. Notice
[32:56] this little queen began to hear it. Now
[32:58] she's talking about Solomon and temple
[33:00] and the queen. Now I I like the Queen of
[33:02] Sheba because
[33:05] she heard
[33:08] &gt;&gt; and I I don't know it was a many days
[33:11] journey. So there was someone carrying
[33:13] the word of God and testifying to the
[33:15] things that had been real to them.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; And this strikes the Queen of Sheba. The
[33:21] privilege you have is might be just the
[33:23] one who we don't hear the account of who
[33:27] brought it to the Queen of Sheba, but
[33:29] there was someone
[33:30] &gt;&gt; who was testifying of the things that
[33:33] they had seen.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; And that is so true in our day.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Come and see.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; This message is life.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; I I I still like to show the video of
[33:50] of a man sent from God in in well it's
[33:53] uh 20th century prophet there's
[33:55] different titles for it but when he's
[33:57] there and the the Chicago campaign and
[34:00] he's discerning the thoughts and intents
[34:02] of the heart I I that's a beautiful
[34:04] thing to share
[34:06] that's Jesus Christ put on display to
[34:09] this generation to this day
[34:11] &gt;&gt; words of life
[34:14] God's love projected that testimony
[34:17] should not be dead upon our lips I'm not
[34:20] ashamed of this gospel. This message was
[34:22] God's provided way of salvation.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; It's not just in word and deed, but it
[34:27] was the nature that was displayed in
[34:28] that prophet that I want others to see
[34:33] &gt;&gt; because that's just as much a part of
[34:35] the gospel.
[34:36] Now, I want to believe that's for me,
[34:39] too.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just put that off on,
[34:42] you know, you have to look at him
[34:43] because I can't live it. No, but God
[34:45] help me live it.
[34:47] I want to if if they don't have a chance
[34:49] to see it, I want to show it.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; My life should be the the that is the
[34:55] proof that the seed's coming to
[34:56] maturity. It wasn't just a sheathwave
[34:59] offering to be the sheath all by itself,
[35:01] but there's got to be a a seed come to
[35:03] maturity.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; And we're here. I believe it.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; I know we we speak these things a lot of
[35:10] times as they shall be, but I believe
[35:11] we're at the very hour.
[35:14] We have to believe and start claiming it
[35:16] to be for us for ourselves.
[35:20] Hebrews 13:78
[35:22] would say, "Remember them which have
[35:24] rule over you, who have spoken unto you
[35:27] the word of God whose faith follow."
[35:30] So this is not
[35:33] an unscriptural principle to recognize
[35:36] the authority of the word of God in our
[35:38] day came through a prophet. We don't
[35:40] have a message of our own. We don't have
[35:42] another place, but we're going to be
[35:44] gathered under the messenger to our age.
[35:46] That word is our provided place of
[35:49] safety.
[35:51] And we absolutely should be remembering
[35:54] that. It shouldn't be something that for
[35:57] some reason uh we've grown past
[36:01] or we think that we now now that we've
[36:04] got everything, we can figure it out
[36:07] ourselves. But that is a provided place
[36:10] of refuge. And I would say I don't have
[36:15] my own thought coming.
[36:19] If I think I've figured something out
[36:21] that makes more sense than what the
[36:23] prophet taught,
[36:25] Lord help me.
[36:28] you it's uh
[36:32] I hope not something that any of us have
[36:34] fallen into that trap but we would have
[36:36] if we if someone has become so wise in
[36:39] their own conceit that they think they
[36:41] understand something better than the
[36:43] very prophet to the age and they want to
[36:45] tell you that they figured it out
[36:51] just stick with the message
[36:55] &gt;&gt; I don't believe this message didn't
[36:57] anything that needed to be corrected was
[36:59] corrected within the message. It's the
[37:01] word of God.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; And and this is where and you know, we
[37:08] know the saying quite well. You'd rather
[37:11] have the right spirit than the the wrong
[37:15] than the wrong the the right spirit and
[37:17] the wrong doctrine, the right doctrine
[37:19] and the wrong spirit because the right
[37:20] spirit will bring you to the truth.
[37:24] But even in all of that, the the token
[37:28] life, the Holy Spirit does more to
[37:31] testify about the truth than your
[37:33] ability to explain theology and
[37:36] doctrine.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; There's things that you may never be
[37:39] able to explain, but you understand to
[37:41] be the truth because it's in your heart.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to practice Christian
[37:48] apologetics. You want you you have the
[37:51] ability to just say, "I believe it."
[37:57] &gt;&gt; That's the difference.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; And when you say it, you mean it.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; I know this to be the truth.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; And though my God doesn't deliver me, he
[38:08] may not. But I will not bow to your
[38:11] ideology, your thinking, your theology,
[38:14] your understanding. I don't care what
[38:15] corner you think you painted me into.
[38:18] I'm sorry. I believe what I believe.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; I know it to be the truth.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; You may be able to think you can
[38:26] convince me otherwise, but I've
[38:28] experienced it.
[38:30] He doesn't care how religious you are.
[38:35] But he's he's looking out after if you
[38:37] possess the life.
[38:48] Amen.
[38:55] Take the time to read this. It's a
[38:56] little maybe even a common reading, but
[38:58] it excites my heart. I don't think I
[39:00] could get a I it could get old reading
[39:03] from our prophet.
[39:06] This is uh the rising of the sun,
[39:11] paragraph 62. Hebrews 13:8 said he's the
[39:16] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[39:20] And saints, I know that saying becomes
[39:22] common. But it's something we should
[39:24] really start meditating on more.
[39:28] It is when even when Jesus would say,
[39:31] "Our father which in heaven," and he
[39:33] would begin to pray, he would say, "On
[39:35] earth as it is in heaven." When you
[39:38] start to understand what it means for
[39:40] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[39:42] and forever. Think of this. Heavens and
[39:44] earth will pass away, but his word will
[39:47] not pass away. So everything that's not
[39:51] going to be there,
[39:53] and you just start thinking about that,
[39:55] there's a lot. The mourner's bench will
[39:57] have no place at all. There ain't going
[39:59] to be no sickness. There ain't going to
[40:01] be no sorrow. There ain't going to be
[40:02] confusion. There ain't going to be no
[40:04] video games. There's not going to be all
[40:07] the things
[40:09] that aren't there
[40:11] are outside of Jesus Christ the same
[40:15] yesterday, today, and forever.
[40:18] That's your refuge.
[40:20] I know what's not going to be there and
[40:23] I know who's going to be there.
[40:26] That's my Lord.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; I I know whom I've believed in.
[40:31] That's today.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; That's now. That's lifting out up Jesus
[40:37] Christ out of history and saying he's my
[40:40] Lord right now.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Because I I I could we could lot could
[40:44] believe for what heaven's going to be.
[40:47] We know the devil ain't going to be
[40:48] there. We just know that academically
[40:50] that guy ain't there. It's heaven. Of
[40:52] course he's not there. But when you
[40:54] could start believing that the light
[40:56] that shines now can cast out darkness,
[40:59] that he's a God that could come present
[41:01] on the scene now, and that your darkness
[41:03] can be turned today, that your sorrow
[41:05] can become joy, that everything that you
[41:09] think Satan's trapped you into can be
[41:11] obliterated.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Now,
[41:14] &gt;&gt; today. Now's the hour of salvation. This
[41:17] isn't a God of will be. It's today.
[41:19] Amen.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus Christ today
[41:25] and we're his beneficiaries to prove his
[41:28] life is in us now. The beneficiaries of
[41:31] the life. The life there never was a
[41:34] life lived like it. He was the son of
[41:36] God and he died and that and that shut
[41:39] it out. But when he raised again from
[41:42] the dead on Easter morning, then we as
[41:45] his servants are commissioned by him to
[41:47] go into all the world and to bring the
[41:49] good news to every person that he is
[41:52] living. And how can we do it? By the
[41:54] word only. For it is written, the gospel
[41:57] came not by word only, but through the
[42:00] power and manifestation of the Holy
[42:02] Spirit to prove that he is alive.
[42:05] Now, if there is another gospel as Bo
[42:09] Paul spoke of to one of the groups, I am
[42:13] so surprised that you've turned to
[42:15] another gospel.
[42:17] Saints, that spirit still works.
[42:21] There's people who've made this gospel
[42:23] of none effect. They've literally turned
[42:26] to other gospels
[42:29] &gt;&gt; even in the name and the framework of
[42:31] what we hold dear. And I I I don't even
[42:33] like to call it the message, but it's
[42:35] just the same religious denominational
[42:38] thinking that's been at work in every
[42:40] age. But this message won't denominate.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; It is the life of Christ.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; And we can't be uh caught off guard
[42:49] or or think that we have any less than
[42:51] the full manifestation for us to
[42:53] manifest.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Don't settle.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; I ain't turning back.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; I want my mountain.
[43:02] I'm not going to stay the same.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not settling for anything
[43:07] less than perfection. I want the I if
[43:11] there's more to me to die than I want to
[43:13] be. The zeal I want to have is to repent
[43:15] &gt;&gt; and die. I don't want to think that I've
[43:17] come so far in my theology and
[43:19] understanding of what a believer should
[43:20] be that for some reason it's wrong to
[43:23] repent
[43:25] &gt;&gt; and to say I'm sorry and to really show
[43:28] the fruits of what the power of Christ
[43:30] is which is really the power to die.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; He had the he laid his life down.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't forget that.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; That was the example. That was the
[43:44] ultimate example that he had. And it the
[43:46] most sublime of all scriptures for their
[43:49] sakes he sanctified himself. He had a
[43:52] right to do a lot of things and he could
[43:56] have done them
[43:59] just as the right of any person would
[44:01] do. But for the sacred trust, for the
[44:05] for the sake of life, for the sake of
[44:07] bearing this Christ, for the sake of
[44:10] bringing the life to the church which
[44:12] the bride has been given,
[44:15] We can die
[44:17] &gt;&gt; to self.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; I could die a little more to my
[44:20] understanding, to my wants, to my needs.
[44:23] That I could be a more effectual in the
[44:25] body of Christ. That I could show forth
[44:27] his image, not with the flavor of in of
[44:31] David McGee. Now, to his glory, he's a
[44:34] bouquet. He He knows how to use all
[44:36] kinds.
[44:38] Be who you are.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; But I want it to be Christ in me.
[44:43] I don't want to be me holding to
[44:45] tradition, to my understanding. My
[44:47] family did it this way. This is the way
[44:49] I see it. If the word of God challenges
[44:51] me, I want to be willing to die
[44:56] &gt;&gt; and just say, Lord, be it unto me
[44:58] according to thy word.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; I want to be a carrier of your life
[45:02] above all else. You wanted to have the
[45:05] preeminence in your church in this day
[45:07] to show forth Christ in this day.
[45:13] Just going to try to bring it to a close
[45:15] and wrap uh
[45:21] this is uh the statue of a perfect man.
[45:24] He says it this way in paragraph 75.
[45:27] Know how that God is in his church. The
[45:30] church is now supposed to be taking the
[45:33] place of Christ carrying on his
[45:35] ministry.
[45:37] And that is
[45:41] g a giver of life.
[45:44] You you are the light.
[45:48] If there's and I would even say this
[45:51] way, did he not feed the multitudes, the
[45:55] loaves and the fishes?
[46:00] We don't sell the economy of God short.
[46:07] the good day that you could be to
[46:10] others.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; The ray of sunshine
[46:16] there you just your smile, the way you
[46:18] treat somebody, the light you shine very
[46:21] well could change the whole direction
[46:23] that their life was going in because
[46:25] you're Christ.
[46:29] What was it? The funeral possession
[46:32] couldn't cross his path.
[46:34] That's us in this day.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Darkness has to flee.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; And you I it's it's to be put on
[46:45] display. The token is to be put on
[46:47] display.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; You have a sacred trust. The greatest
[46:51] privilege that we would know really is
[46:53] to know the truth.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; The truth sets free. If it men for a
[47:00] lack of vision perish, but we have an
[47:03] open word and a truth.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Your heritage is to come into this
[47:06] building to hear the gospel preached,
[47:08] the fullness of it, what God's done in
[47:10] this day. And it would behoove us to
[47:13] make sure that we know
[47:16] what is that you ready to give an
[47:18] answer. Young people, be ready to give
[47:20] an answer. And I and not just from
[47:23] doctrine, but but that you know him.
[47:32] We don't want to be make believers.
[47:35] You can't give what you ain't got.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; And and I'm saying this for myself.
[47:41] There's things I know I believe are the
[47:42] truth. I believe them there. I believe
[47:46] that's God all God. I have confidence in
[47:49] the source. I know it's God's word. But
[47:51] there's a difference when something is
[47:53] just an understanding and a belief and
[47:56] when it becomes a revelation
[48:00] &gt;&gt; and I want to allow myself to be
[48:02] quickened
[48:05] &gt;&gt; it to to bring forth the life of it
[48:09] &gt;&gt; not just settle for an understanding of
[48:13] it. And you know what in even saying
[48:16] that you know what the price is? God
[48:18] will do what he needs to to make it
[48:20] become a reality. Being on the potter's
[48:23] will isn't easy.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; But I want to set before you what the
[48:29] reason is.
[48:31] Why are things hard? Why are there
[48:33] trials? Why is there something that
[48:35] challenges you? Because God wants to
[48:38] show his image in you.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Christ didn't have an easy road.
[48:44] But there's a victory that we all must
[48:48] win. He doesn't have to bear he doesn't
[48:50] bear the cross alone.
[48:52] But there's a dying out that we can bear
[48:55] the fruit.
[48:57] And it in the in the simplicity of it,
[49:00] it's nothing but the birth.
[49:03] It's let your word be born in me Lord.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; The sacred trust is that is of
[49:09] motherhood is to bear the life. I want
[49:11] to bear the life of Christ.
[49:13] So you just stand with me
[49:19] and the musicians could come.
[49:27] Lord, I want to be faithful
[49:34] to all that you want to in this day
[49:40] display.
[49:44] I believe this is the hour of maturity.
[49:49] Just as Adam would have been in the
[49:50] garden and display his sunship,
[49:55] I believe that there's a bride that's
[49:57] going to reflect
[49:59] the image of who he is, the life of
[50:02] Christ.
[50:07] And I want the Lord just to be faithful
[50:10] to complete the work he started in me. I
[50:13] know the in the seed.
[50:15] It's there.
[50:17] All that he's given will be manifested.
[50:22] But I know that sometimes we just say,
[50:25] "Lord, there's more of me to die
[50:29] that you can live. I haven't allowed you
[50:31] to be on full display the way you should
[50:34] be." Sometimes I
[50:36] [Music]
[50:38] just let my flesh get in the way.
[50:42] But Lord, do what you need to give me
[50:45] the vision of what's set before me.
[50:48] That there's others that are depending
[50:50] on me, the heritage that I have that I
[50:53] need to preserve it.
[50:56] That I want to show the nature of Christ
[51:00] that others could live. Let's just go
[51:02] before him. Gracious heavenly father, we
[51:07] thank you for your word. Thank you for
[51:09] the heritage of it, Lord. And I believe
[51:12] as you've trusted us with your word that
[51:15] it's because you know exactly what we're
[51:17] made out of.
[51:20] We're sons and daughters of God.
[51:23] The power to overcome and all that we
[51:25] are, you put in us before the foundation
[51:28] of the world,
[51:30] Lord. and you give us your word to fight
[51:33] the battle. Father, we ask that you
[51:36] anoint our faith, Lord, to believe and
[51:38] to receive and you'd quicken us, Father,
[51:41] from glory to glory. You'd give us
[51:44] strength that we could be a light and a
[51:46] virtue to others, Lord, that if there's
[51:48] any here that feel like they don't have
[51:51] anything to give, Father, that will you
[51:53] fill their cup, Father, to overflowing,
[51:55] Lord. One touch from you,
[51:58] everything changes.
[52:01] One touch from you father that death
[52:05] becomes life.
[52:08] You haven't changed Lord.
[52:11] You said not by power, not by might, but
[52:13] by my spirit.
[52:15] Father, may your spirit have complete
[52:17] preeminence and control in our lives.
[52:20] [Music]
[52:21] May it be what quickens the word to our
[52:23] heart.
[52:25] Maybe we understand what it means for
[52:27] you to come in and blow through the room
[52:29] and make your presence known.
[52:32] Lord, you've changed not.
[52:36] [Music]
[52:42] But you're the same.
[52:45] It's not for another day age, another
[52:47] day. But I believe that many sitting
[52:51] here now have known you in many times to
[52:55] move in powerful ways.
[52:58] You're still the same, Father.
[53:01] Lord, even now just thinking of the
[53:03] times you've done miraculous things.
[53:07] Can't even explain why you would come
[53:09] and
[53:11] make yourself so real.
[53:14] Father, and yet I know there's many
[53:18] who would desire to have you come in a
[53:20] reality
[53:22] and may say they've never felt you and
[53:25] they don't know you to be real. But
[53:27] Father, I believe you're desiring more
[53:29] than they realize to make yourself known
[53:31] to them,
[53:33] [Music]
[53:36] Lord. And where there's any hindrance, I
[53:39] ask that you would break it.
[53:42] Lord, that recognize Jesus Christ of
[53:44] this Bible promised that he would come
[53:48] again, that he would be the comforter,
[53:52] Lord. And it's given us to know you in
[53:54] the power of your resurrection. Commit
[53:56] it all to you in the mighty name of
[53:58] Jesus Christ. Amen.
