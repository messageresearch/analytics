[0:00] I trust you're all doing well this
[0:01] morning and feel good by God's grace and
[0:04] if you don't uh if you don't feel well
[0:06] you have to resist the urge to feel like
[0:08] the way I feel now there's a way it's
[0:10] always been and the way that it's always
[0:11] going to be but know that uh with God
[0:14] everything gets gooder and gooder and
[0:16] whatever ails you and whatever you're
[0:18] experiencing whatever you're going
[0:19] through God is always faithful to meet
[0:21] us in our needs and bring us out of
[0:23] whatever it is we're going through and I
[0:25] do believe that this the sun has risen
[0:27] upon God's elect and that no matter what
[0:31] we go through every obstacle every
[0:33] challenge every battle you know has to
[0:36] have in it somewhere good
[0:37] Victory and overcoming no matter what it
[0:40] is you know if a challenge meets you you
[0:42] got to know that it's pregnant with
[0:43] victory for you if you're in a battle
[0:45] you got to know hey the battle has
[0:46] Victory inside of it for you and that's
[0:49] kind of optimism we can have as
[0:51] Christians now I'm going to start a new
[0:54] um subtitle so to speak with worldly
[0:57] kingdoms and I've actually decided to
[1:00] not even capitalize the world and not
[1:02] even capitalize kingdoms because I don't
[1:04] want to give any glory and honor to
[1:06] these worldly kingdoms but I believe
[1:08] it's important to look at them and as
[1:10] we've been speaking about the kingdom of
[1:12] God and what it relates to and even
[1:15] Heaven's mystery and Earth's Glory these
[1:17] things I hope maybe maybe it's a very
[1:19] big picture but I just hope in different
[1:21] places pieces are coming together but I
[1:24] have chosen to approach I want to look
[1:26] at the kingdoms of this world and
[1:28] Satan's kingdoms and I believe it's
[1:30] necessary because it they are the
[1:32] enemies to God's kingdom and to the
[1:35] kingdom that we're speaking about and so
[1:37] it's very important and today we'll just
[1:40] begin to lay some pieces in there that I
[1:42] believe will expose Satan's tactics
[1:44] and help us to understand uh more
[1:47] because I know that you understand it
[1:49] but in a greater way the greatest battle
[1:52] ever fought and just how the devil is
[1:54] trying to attack Us in very unique ways
[1:57] to try to hinder the kingdom
[2:00] and we know that the kingdom is the king
[2:04] God is to be established in the hearts
[2:06] of his children we see that from the
[2:08] parable and the kingdom of God is within
[2:10] you and that to me is just a it's a
[2:13] mind-blowing mystery and the more that I
[2:14] study this the clearer the picture gets
[2:16] but that's what God's wanting to do is
[2:17] he's wanting to establish the kingdom in
[2:19] you as has already been prayed this
[2:22] morning I would say the kingdom is in
[2:24] you the kingdom is here and so those are
[2:27] things that the devil is fighting
[2:28] against and we've been taking this
[2:30] statement from the sermon the countdown
[2:32] as a principle that we're building off
[2:34] of where he says as science achieves
[2:36] something looking backwards so science
[2:38] achieved something no matter how much it
[2:40] may seem like it progresses it's
[2:42] regressing that's oh that's a that you
[2:45] know you know combustion engines this is
[2:46] awesome this is great right everyone
[2:48] thought it was the most wonderful thing
[2:49] ever when they invented combustion
[2:51] engines and science says we've gone
[2:54] forward now what are they all saying
[2:56] it's marched just backwards right and
[2:58] now they're trying to figure out a way
[2:59] to get rid of combustion engines because
[3:01] that's Satan's the kingdoms of this
[3:04] world or science achieves always going
[3:06] backwards and has to deal with the
[3:08] consequences and Fallout of their
[3:10] achievements but God achieves going this
[3:13] way going forward to the kingdom
[3:16] whatever God does he moves closer to the
[3:19] kingdom even if it seems that God takes
[3:22] something away he only does that to
[3:24] advance you further to the kingdom you
[3:26] say oh well I've been I've been fought
[3:27] against and I've been attacked or this
[3:29] has happened or that's happened God's
[3:31] only doing it because he wants the
[3:33] kingdom to come into preeminence and so
[3:35] God achieves whether it be by addition
[3:37] or subtraction God achieves going
[3:40] forward to the kingdom and Satan will do
[3:44] anything and he and it kind of reminds
[3:47] me of the underminer you know there's
[3:50] nothing beneath him like the stoop as
[3:53] low as he can to do anything to try to
[3:55] keep us from going forward to the
[3:58] kingdom that's his objective is to keep
[4:00] the Kingdom from coming into
[4:01] manifestation so I want to use worldly
[4:04] kingdoms to identify and even just uh
[4:07] use this moment and this Parable to
[4:09] identify Satan's kingdoms and his
[4:11] tactics because like science he's behind
[4:15] science it's regressive
[4:17] and I believe that Satan does not want
[4:19] uh the kingdom seeds that are in us that
[4:22] lay within us to be expressed or come to
[4:24] full manifestation and I want to use
[4:26] this statement from the fourth seal and
[4:29] I'm using this uh to introduce a couple
[4:31] principles uh that we're not I don't
[4:34] want to review the sermons we've already
[4:35] Minister on this but this will just kind
[4:37] of help us capture something as we go
[4:39] forward brother Bram is recounting a
[4:41] conversation I was walking to a person
[4:42] talking to a person not long ago and
[4:43] he's trying to discuss with me saying
[4:45] aren't you ashamed to say that God
[4:47] created the heavens and earth in six
[4:49] days
[4:50] I said that's what the Bible said and so
[4:52] the response is well we've got evidence
[4:54] and can prove that the world is millions
[4:56] of years old and so that's uh that's the
[4:59] response the scientist right we can
[5:01] prove it that we have done the testing
[5:04] and the testing cannot fail the testing
[5:07] says that what we the material we are
[5:09] examining is millions of years old and
[5:12] brother Brown's response is
[5:14] that didn't have anything to do with it
[5:17] I gotta be careful sometimes when we try
[5:18] to debate the scientists and and the
[5:21] evolutionist and those things he says in
[5:23] Genesis 1 1 it said in the beginning God
[5:25] created heavens and earth period
[5:27] that's all now the world was with world
[5:30] without form and void he said I see I
[5:33] said I believe every seed was laying
[5:35] right there
[5:36] from some other civilization or
[5:39] something
[5:40] oh that's a remarkable statement
[5:42] and and we've already examined how that
[5:45] uh the word of God shows us that all the
[5:48] seeds were there by the spoken word of
[5:49] God and it took light to bring it forth
[5:51] and manifest it so in the beginning God
[5:53] created the heavens and the earth and
[5:54] the spoken words of the original seed
[5:56] and God puts things into the Earth and
[5:58] so just imagine that if the seed was
[6:01] millions of years old
[6:03] all right the elements the very things
[6:04] as a matter of fact they might find that
[6:06] their testing is wrong and some of these
[6:08] things actually on a million years old
[6:09] they're eternal
[6:11] and just the they can only read so far
[6:14] they've got like computers that won't
[6:15] make it past the year 2000 and so it
[6:18] says I believe every seed was laying
[6:19] right there from some other civilization
[6:21] or something and as soon as the water
[6:23] lifted off the light Struck it up come
[6:25] the trees and everything so this is this
[6:28] is how God has brought forth all
[6:30] creation is the seeds of the Kingdom
[6:32] were already in the earth and framed it
[6:35] with this this image of in the beginning
[6:37] God created the Heaven and the Earth and
[6:39] then the man and the woman were in this
[6:41] Garden of pleasure in God's Eden naked
[6:43] and unashamed that's all God's word seed
[6:46] bringing forth if it's kind and that
[6:48] ends the that's the end of Genesis
[6:50] chapter two this is what happens so he
[6:52] says the same thing with the human being
[6:54] so now we're going to see us it's a type
[6:56] when all the Mist is moved away and the
[6:59] revealed truth to that real seed Lane
[7:01] there still germatized in the light of
[7:04] the Gospel can Strike It by a true
[7:06] Vindication of the word it'll live it's
[7:08] got life in it
[7:10] and so that's what we have inside of us
[7:12] we have this treasure in Earthen vessels
[7:14] that when the light of God's word can
[7:16] break away all the mist and all the
[7:18] unbelief and all the callousness I know
[7:20] sometimes we we have it in our minds
[7:21] that well if you're the elect seed of
[7:23] God all you got to do is just read the
[7:24] Bible and hear the word and as soon as
[7:26] it strikes you then something's going to
[7:28] happen and brother bam says usually they
[7:30] catch it this quick but sometimes we've
[7:32] been raised in ways and taught in
[7:34] certain ways and treated in certain ways
[7:36] and abused in certain ways and all sorts
[7:38] of things have happened do we have a
[7:39] little bit more mist and thick clouds in
[7:42] our spirits and things that we have to
[7:44] overcome and God is faithful to just
[7:46] keep driving it away and driving it away
[7:48] and for some it may take longer but
[7:51] eventually that seed must come forth
[7:53] because it's got life in it
[7:56] now that's the seeds of the Kingdom
[7:59] those are the seeds that God sowed in
[8:01] the beginning
[8:02] and we can go back to the beginning to
[8:03] find the good seed that God sowed but
[8:05] now if we looked at the worldly kingdoms
[8:07] we can just go back we go back to the
[8:10] beginning to see the seeds of the
[8:11] Kingdom well we can do the same thing
[8:12] for the kingdoms of this world
[8:14] and
[8:17] there is let me say this and I'll come
[8:20] back to it
[8:21] um
[8:22] I have got so much to preach it's
[8:25] awesome and uh and I'm thinking about
[8:28] adding Services here and there and we
[8:30] can just go back to zoom Church
[8:33] for some of you and I know some of you
[8:35] some of you just cringed
[8:37] uh but in Revelations 21 and 22 is we've
[8:41] kind of touched on it quite a bit that
[8:44] shows us the glory of the Kingdom in its
[8:46] full manifestation seed sown in Genesis
[8:48] 1 we go to the end here it is here it is
[8:51] and it's a good seat as the scripture
[8:53] tells us good seed fully harvested so I
[8:55] want to go back to Genesis
[8:57] and find the seed that the wicked one
[9:00] sold to build worldly kingdoms and the
[9:03] nature that's behind it so if you look
[9:04] at Matthew chapter 13
[9:06] verses 38 to 39 and says the field is
[9:10] the word the world excuse me the field
[9:12] is the world
[9:13] the good seed are the children of the
[9:15] Kingdom but the tares are the children
[9:18] of the wicked one that's just a mouthful
[9:21] I mean what he is saying especially to a
[9:24] Jew is just one of these things where
[9:26] they're they're picking up what he's
[9:27] laying down even to the point where like
[9:29] I know exactly what you're saying and
[9:31] what you're trying to say and and
[9:33] there's this and I think they wanted him
[9:35] to be wrong in a lot of things and
[9:36] that's where their wrestling was is man
[9:38] this guy speaks truth this guy has
[9:39] wisdom we don't know it we keep trying
[9:41] to trip him up and he has a way to
[9:42] answer it the field is the world the
[9:45] good seed are the children of the
[9:46] Kingdom so you are
[9:49] The Good Seed
[9:50] I says but the tares are the children of
[9:53] the wicked one
[9:55] and he says the enemy that sold them is
[9:57] the devil
[9:58] the Harvest is the end of the world
[10:01] and the reapers are the Angels now
[10:03] there's a lot in there where we looked
[10:05] at how had to wait to the time of the
[10:07] Harvest before they could uh separate
[10:09] them out and I want to just take a few
[10:11] moments to set this up and if I have to
[10:14] slow down uh that may be an answer to
[10:16] prayer for some but if I have to slow
[10:19] down and make the point this is a very
[10:20] important point I want to make but I
[10:21] want to draw
[10:23] uh I'll just warn you ahead of time I'm
[10:24] gonna draw from Shakespeare to make my
[10:26] point
[10:27] and these tears that are here I think we
[10:30] say the good seed are the children of
[10:32] the kingdom and and we could spend time
[10:35] on The Good Seed but now that it's these
[10:36] tares that I want to look at this
[10:38] morning and and that the the word that
[10:42] is used there for Tears it's agreed to
[10:44] across the board everywhere that this
[10:46] would be a particular plant that is just
[10:48] a weed a Darnell plant
[10:50] our zazonian is the Greek word that's
[10:53] used and it's actually called This is
[10:56] the I wouldn't say a technical term but
[10:58] this is how it's referred to in
[10:59] Horticulture is wheat's evil twin
[11:02] and so there is wheat that is sown into
[11:05] the in the field that's sown into the
[11:08] the world the wheat represents the
[11:10] children of the Kingdom but now you have
[11:12] a tears and the tares are weeds evil
[11:14] twin why because it looks just like
[11:16] wheat before full maturity
[11:19] that up until that moment when it's
[11:22] actually harvested into that moment
[11:24] where it can be harvested it can by all
[11:26] appearances look just like wheat but
[11:29] this Darnell though it may look like
[11:31] wheat it can't doesn't function in the
[11:33] same way that we can because it is a
[11:36] poison
[11:37] and so the tares The Good Seed is
[11:40] harvestable wheat productive wheat and
[11:42] we could just use the example of wheat
[11:44] seed and what it can produce and how
[11:45] it's good for food and bread but the
[11:48] tears are wheat's evil twin and it's a
[11:50] poison and eating the seeds of the
[11:52] Darnell plant will make you dizzy make
[11:54] you off balance and nauseous and
[11:57] actually can be deadly
[11:59] so this is a poison seed that Jesus is
[12:04] saying is sown into the field that if
[12:06] one eats it can become cause you to
[12:09] become nauseous and off balance and lose
[12:11] control and actually Darnell comes from
[12:14] the root Latin drunk
[12:16] so it's a it's a weed that causes one to
[12:19] become intoxicated and causes one to uh
[12:23] now I feel like there's so many weed
[12:25] jokes we can start telling but there it
[12:27] is it is something that influences and
[12:31] poisons causes one to become nauseous
[12:33] and it's deadly it can lead to death
[12:36] it's actually called a mimic weed
[12:39] and this mimic weed it called a mimic
[12:42] weed because it's not entirely wild but
[12:44] not quite tame
[12:47] it's a mimic weed it's like they can't
[12:49] say it's completely wild but it's not
[12:52] completely tame because it looks and
[12:54] behaves like wheat it looks and behaves
[12:56] like this other plant uh but yet it
[12:59] requires human assistance in order to
[13:01] survive
[13:03] they actually call them stowaway seeds
[13:06] to where they're they're not planted
[13:08] themselves they're not tame where you
[13:10] would sow them intentionally and plant
[13:11] them and harvest them they stow away
[13:13] with other seeds
[13:16] and their survival requires human
[13:18] assistance and so what it means is it's
[13:21] it stows away it it's in the other grain
[13:23] it's mixed in with all the other good
[13:25] seed and being mixed in there it's
[13:27] planted at the same time as the good
[13:29] seed and then as it grows up you can't
[13:31] distinguish it from The Good Seed you'll
[13:33] only know in the end uh when it when it
[13:36] comes forth that it's the wrong seed so
[13:38] what happens is it ends up growing up
[13:40] with the rest of the wheat and it gets
[13:41] harvested with it and then plant it
[13:44] again so it has been harvested replanted
[13:47] harvested replanted and that's why it's
[13:49] not quite entirely wild but it's not
[13:52] entirely tame
[13:55] I came across an article in the Journal
[13:57] of ethnobiology it was laying on one of
[14:00] your coffee tables when I was over for
[14:02] dinner but the Journal of ethnobiology
[14:04] didn't even know it existed but they
[14:06] wrote an article on the Darnell plant
[14:09] several years ago and they called a
[14:10] symbol of malign subversion
[14:13] now someone could say well yeah of
[14:16] course because Look what Jesus had to
[14:17] say about it it's like all right exactly
[14:20] got a little bit because science is a
[14:22] little self-aware now and they're
[14:24] looking at this and they're recognizing
[14:26] what this plant is it's a symbol of
[14:28] malign subversion and they wrote this
[14:31] where there is Darnell there is
[14:32] treachery in toxicity
[14:36] this is what they have to say about the
[14:38] tares and this is exactly the image that
[14:40] Jesus is wanting us to catch he says I
[14:43] sowed good seed and that seed would
[14:45] bring forth of its kind and it's going
[14:46] to produce a particular nature and have
[14:48] a particular expression and look a
[14:49] certain way but the wicked one came and
[14:52] sowed tears and these tares are a poison
[14:55] and wherever these tares uh plant or
[14:59] planted there is treachery in toxicity
[15:02] it is aligned it is a malign subversion
[15:05] it is poisonous it intoxicates it causes
[15:09] one to become a nauseous and it can even
[15:12] lead to death and Madness
[15:15] and it is you'll find once you start
[15:17] looking at this and you start trying to
[15:19] find this plant you'll find it in a lot
[15:20] of different places
[15:23] Shakespeare used in a number of several
[15:26] of his plays I think three or four
[15:28] and one in particular on King Lear
[15:31] and it's about the downfall of a king
[15:33] and how he loses his kingdom and he
[15:34] loses his family
[15:35] he loses his mind
[15:38] and so this is this is the story that is
[15:41] being portrayed by uh Shakespeare
[15:44] and and I guess if I'm just using maybe
[15:48] one's interpretation of it and I find
[15:49] found this quite frequently is those
[15:51] that would analyze the the the the play
[15:54] that this was a king who by his
[15:56] arrogance
[15:57] an excessive Pride
[15:59] he loses his daughter
[16:01] he loses his most faithful servant the
[16:04] people that loved him truly that were
[16:06] faithful to him stood by his side that
[16:08] would never do him any harm because of
[16:11] his Madness his increasing Madness his
[16:13] lack of discernment his lack of wisdom
[16:15] he ends up losing everything
[16:19] that was good and right and even loses
[16:21] his kingdom so it's about a king who
[16:23] loses the kingdom
[16:24] and it says in the play that his crown
[16:27] this is where the Darnell comes in I
[16:28] know you're somebody you're just saying
[16:29] just get there my goodness gracious
[16:32] you didn't like it in high school and
[16:34] you don't like it now
[16:36] but the crown was made up of all the
[16:39] idle weeds that grow in our sustaining
[16:41] corn
[16:42] so he was given a crown and this Crown
[16:46] was made up of these weeds or if we
[16:49] could even maybe surmise that it was
[16:51] mixed in it that they were wanting to
[16:52] use something but mixed into this Crown
[16:54] the crown was made with all the
[16:57] idleweeds the Darnell that grows up with
[17:00] the corn
[17:01] so though he had a crown there was
[17:04] poison that was mixed up in it
[17:06] and what's what's kind of represented by
[17:09] this when I read it this is what strikes
[17:11] me that the king's Madness was
[17:14] symptomatic of Darnell poisoning
[17:16] that the very way he's acting and the
[17:18] way he's living and the way that he's
[17:20] deciding the way he's viewing his own
[17:22] children and the way that he's viewed
[17:23] his kingdom and his faithful um servants
[17:25] he is it is indicative that he has been
[17:28] eating Darnell
[17:31] and the way it struck me is the King was
[17:33] drunk on his crown
[17:35] he was eating the crown and because
[17:37] there was poison in the crown because
[17:40] there was poison in the power because
[17:42] there was Darnell sewn into it it
[17:44] perverted his character and it
[17:47] intoxicated him and it corrupted him
[17:50] because he's feeding on that power apart
[17:53] from character is satanic
[17:55] but Power with characters fit to rule
[17:58] and and here's a king who got drunk on
[18:01] his own power and drank the Kool-Aid so
[18:03] to speak or drank the punch or drank the
[18:05] things and and intoxicated him caused
[18:08] him to lose his mind and lose his
[18:09] discernment I I see even the image of
[18:12] Saul in this
[18:16] and these are the seeds that Jesus says
[18:18] the wicked one is sown into Humanity
[18:21] so look at how literature
[18:25] takes the Darnell Terror these are what
[18:28] the tares are
[18:29] it's a poison I just want to zero on
[18:32] that the aspect that Darnell the tares
[18:34] are a poison God sows good seed but then
[18:38] the tares are rep are a poison weed a
[18:41] stowaway it's gonna it's gonna piggyback
[18:43] off of the fact that you don't plow a
[18:45] field and you don't get it already in
[18:47] order to plant Darnell you do it to
[18:48] plant wheat so then the wicked one takes
[18:51] advantage of the fact that the field is
[18:52] ready the field is cultivated it's good
[18:54] ground it can nurture and germatize
[18:56] there's life everything there that the
[18:58] wheat needs the the enemy knows that he
[19:00] can use what's already been there by
[19:02] Spoken Word creation he can use what's
[19:05] already there in order to poison that's
[19:08] the key poison
[19:12] the the kingdom of God poison Humanity I
[19:15] want to call it the devil's poison
[19:17] and I think that maybe we'd be able to
[19:19] point this out but if I if I fail to
[19:20] come back to it
[19:23] the devil well as a matter of fact
[19:25] another thing I probably keep saying
[19:26] that I probably say it 12 times so
[19:27] whoever keeps counts of track of these
[19:29] things here's check one the devil can't
[19:31] create
[19:33] he doesn't have a seed
[19:35] so how does he get how does he poison
[19:38] good seed
[19:40] and in Genesis chapter 3 and I'm going
[19:43] way too slow this morning and there's a
[19:46] lot that I want to bring out that I'm
[19:48] not going to be able to do this morning
[19:50] but I feel there's just a direct point
[19:52] that I want to make this morning to help
[19:53] us understand the kingdom of God that is
[19:55] within us but in Genesis chapter 3 we
[19:58] know the devil is in the Garden of Eden
[20:00] sowing the seeds of another kingdom
[20:03] and again the wicked one cannot create
[20:06] so maybe I could help you count
[20:08] he has not the power he does not have a
[20:10] seed
[20:11] but we'll come to some scriptures in a
[20:13] moment he wants his own kingdom
[20:15] he he he wants to be worshiped he wants
[20:18] to have power and since he can't create
[20:21] his own kingdom he can't create his own
[20:23] world he has to use what exists
[20:27] and he cannot transform it he can only
[20:31] deform it or pervert it
[20:34] so now we'll go to Genesis 3 1. we've
[20:36] seen the framing the book ends Genesis 1
[20:39] Genesis 2 in the beginning was the word
[20:40] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[20:42] and the Earth we've come we've fast
[20:43] forwarded to see the full fruits of that
[20:45] in Revelations 21 and 22 but now Genesis
[20:47] 3 and I think we've already touched on
[20:49] this a little bit it says now the
[20:50] serpent
[20:51] which is coming from the word enchanter
[20:55] was more subtle
[20:57] than any beast and is tied with
[20:59] lamenting and was more subtle than any
[21:02] beast of the field which Lord God had
[21:04] made
[21:06] so now he's wanting just to recognize
[21:09] that this serpent was a beast of the
[21:12] field
[21:13] and he's very subtle of all the animal
[21:14] life of all these creatures and he
[21:17] apparently could talk we know according
[21:19] to the scripture he could apparently
[21:20] walk
[21:21] and he said unto the woman so now this
[21:24] is his first tactic he says yeh hath God
[21:27] said You shall not eat of every tree of
[21:30] the garden
[21:31] now there this is where I could get
[21:33] sidetracked there's a reason why he went
[21:35] to the woman
[21:36] he there's a reason why he went to her
[21:39] and there's a reason why he's talking to
[21:41] her and this question of you shall not
[21:44] eat of every tree of the garden I'm not
[21:45] even going to get into the woman's
[21:47] answer
[21:48] but let me just say that his question
[21:50] may seem like an affirmation
[21:53] well didn't brother Branham say
[21:56] s doesn't the Bible say
[21:58] and so he's quoting God
[22:01] in such a way that it could provoke an
[22:04] affirmation that well God said you can't
[22:06] eat of every tree in the in the garden
[22:08] and so it's even in a way trying to
[22:10] establish some the woman's confidence
[22:12] that he knows what he's talking about
[22:14] establishing some common ground or that
[22:16] we have a meeting of the minds right
[22:18] will you believe God sent a prophet and
[22:19] will you believe this and there's a
[22:21] little bit of a kind of can we can we
[22:23] find Common Ground some space to work
[22:25] within
[22:26] and once he's been able to do that he
[22:28] says
[22:29] does he not say that you shall not eat
[22:31] of the tree of the garden now he spoke
[22:34] now I'm I'm doing this uh
[22:37] and it is maybe very meticulous
[22:41] and and I didn't choose the hottest day
[22:43] of the year to do this intentionally
[22:46] but this is
[22:48] this is important I believe this is very
[22:50] very important
[22:51] he speaks
[22:53] and as he speaks the woman is going to
[22:55] be receiving these words so now he's
[22:57] trying to use his spoken word
[23:00] and Jesus says in John 8 44 year of your
[23:03] father the devil
[23:04] and the lust of your father will he do
[23:07] so now the Devil is a father
[23:09] and it's a father that brings forth by
[23:12] lust so lust is sown into the nature
[23:15] he was a murderer and I
[23:17] I'll we'll clarify as we continue this
[23:19] is your father the devil and we think oh
[23:20] they're literally the spawn of Satan
[23:22] well
[23:23] it has to do with his will not his seed
[23:26] because he doesn't have one because he
[23:28] cannot create
[23:29] you have your father the devil and the
[23:31] lust your father you will do he was now
[23:33] a murderer from the beginning
[23:36] now I know in our minds we go to King
[23:38] but Cain Now is acting out
[23:40] the murderous spirit and Abode not in
[23:43] the truth because there is no truth in
[23:46] him
[23:47] when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of
[23:49] his own for he is a liar and the father
[23:52] of it notice how the devil the the devil
[23:57] is called the father your father the
[23:59] devil the lust of your father so he's
[24:02] saying in a way that you are now progeny
[24:05] of the devil but notice that he is given
[24:08] credit of being a father of dishonesty
[24:11] like he says he's only given credit for
[24:13] creating dishonesty
[24:15] so let me give him credit for being the
[24:17] father of lies because I'm because he's
[24:20] the father of Lies he cannot bring forth
[24:22] life he can only bring forth death
[24:25] and it says that he is you're of your
[24:28] father the devil the lust of your father
[24:30] you will do that means he what he's
[24:32] trying to recognize is that you have
[24:34] come because of a liar
[24:36] you're of your father the devil well
[24:38] where's the kinship oh the devil is the
[24:41] father of lies and it took a lie to
[24:44] bring us forth in the way that we are
[24:45] and so it's trying to get us to
[24:47] understand why things are the way they
[24:50] are why it looks the way they do and why
[24:52] sometimes that wait we think the way we
[24:54] think so he's the father of Lies he says
[24:56] he's a murderer from the beginning
[24:58] Satan was a murderer from the beginning
[25:00] because he desired and acted to ruin
[25:03] Humanity
[25:04] to murder its influence to ruin the
[25:07] children of the Kingdom he was a
[25:09] murderer from the beginning who wanted
[25:11] to take away life
[25:14] and so it's his word of unbelief and
[25:16] doubt
[25:17] that acts as a poison upon the seed so
[25:20] when he says ye shall not eat of every
[25:22] tree of the garden that on its face may
[25:24] seem to be an innocent question but it's
[25:26] a lie
[25:28] it's a lie
[25:30] but he has no power of the spoken word
[25:32] to create
[25:34] and so Satan's poison breath if you
[25:36] study the message you'll find that he's
[25:38] and what I'd want you to look at this
[25:40] morning
[25:41] let's just read it from God's power to
[25:43] transform
[25:44] that just watch how he manipulates how
[25:46] he contrives
[25:48] watch how he postures
[25:50] watch how he politics
[25:52] because this is this is plain and simple
[25:54] what he's trying to use against the
[25:56] woman are not the tactics that God uses
[25:59] Satan wants the kingdom Satan uses
[26:01] certain tactics to build his kingdom to
[26:03] defend his kingdom to represent his
[26:04] kingdom God doesn't use those tactics he
[26:07] uses fear and intimidation and bullying
[26:09] there's a way that he was trying to work
[26:11] against the woman's nature to supplant
[26:13] but God doesn't use the same tactics
[26:16] and God's power to transform he says
[26:18] like Satan at the beginning when he come
[26:20] into the Garden of Eden
[26:23] he could not dig up those seeds
[26:26] he could not destroy them
[26:29] but he sprayed them with poison
[26:32] and it deformed the seed
[26:34] it didn't bring forth of its being forth
[26:37] Its Right Kind
[26:39] it deformed The Original Seed so can you
[26:43] recognize Satan is a deformer
[26:46] and the way that he's using it is Satan
[26:48] used he can't dig up the seeds right so
[26:50] he couldn't go into the field and dig up
[26:52] all the good seed and destroy it and
[26:54] then put his Bad Seed in there he had to
[26:56] find a way to deform the seed that was
[26:58] there
[27:00] and he says it deformed The Original
[27:03] Seed now and that's
[27:05] he says and that's what all these
[27:07] programs of religion
[27:10] so now we've got to realize whoa
[27:12] organize religion and religion how the
[27:15] leaven that's in it and the danger of
[27:17] the poison and intoxication and the
[27:20] poison that's in the crown
[27:21] he says they're still Sons and Daughters
[27:24] of God but it's being deformed that
[27:27] means there's real genuine children of
[27:28] God who find themselves in situations
[27:30] where they're not being nurtured to
[27:33] express the word they're being deformed
[27:36] and it's hurting their discernment it's
[27:39] hurting their nature it's hurting their
[27:41] families it's hurting their environment
[27:42] it's hurting their atmosphere and we
[27:44] have to be very careful with her nothing
[27:45] but a bunch of you know unborn again
[27:47] degenerates so hold on they may only be
[27:50] doing that because of poison
[27:52] what else do you expect if things are
[27:54] sold into someone's garden they're
[27:56] they're just gonna they're gonna get out
[27:57] of it listen that's exactly what God
[27:59] made the woman to be whatever you put in
[28:01] her is what you get out and so sometimes
[28:04] people are just sitting there and
[28:05] they're receiving all sorts of
[28:06] deformities and all sorts of attitudes
[28:08] and all sorts of seeds and because
[28:10] they're good ground
[28:12] right they're just going to be
[28:14] manifesting it and you may look at that
[28:15] say oh I don't like that prickly nature
[28:17] I don't like their attitude I don't like
[28:19] their cynicism I don't like their
[28:20] critical nature they're in the wrong
[28:22] kind of program
[28:24] all it produces the deformity
[28:27] and this is where brother Branham
[28:28] touches on this uh the the heaviness of
[28:31] it they go to church wanting to do right
[28:34] a nun never enters a nunnery to be a
[28:36] mean woman
[28:38] a minister never goes through school
[28:39] just to be a bad man
[28:42] never joined church and Shake Hands put
[28:44] your name on a book or whatever you do
[28:45] in your church to be a bad person I hope
[28:47] you're listening
[28:49] you do that to be a good person
[28:51] people that go to church are not doing
[28:53] it they're not doing it to raise a flag
[28:55] of you know of obstinence here they're
[28:59] doing it because they're being genuine
[29:01] but it's deception
[29:03] it's the deformity that does it it says
[29:05] Satan sprayed it
[29:11] Satan's poison has
[29:14] many good people bound
[29:17] many good people drunk you'll find even
[29:19] in the King Lear how there was times
[29:21] where even in his madness he seemed to
[29:23] have more of an awareness than when he
[29:25] was in his right mind
[29:26] because why and it's hard at his core
[29:28] maybe a good man maybe a good person
[29:31] good relationships with his daughters
[29:32] and trusted these servants and there are
[29:34] certain things that maybe are certain
[29:36] ones and there's things that you say oh
[29:37] there's good in this person there's
[29:38] glimpses this is this is great but then
[29:40] you see the madness and you see the
[29:43] poison they're drunk with poison it
[29:45] deforms the expression
[29:48] and I'm wanting you to recognize how
[29:50] that brother Branham says Satan at the
[29:51] beginning sprayed the good seed with
[29:54] poison
[29:55] because God sows good seed now Satan
[29:58] cannot just sow a seed of evil
[30:02] because he cannot create
[30:04] evil are we at four now
[30:08] and since he cannot do that
[30:10] he has to find a way those are nice New
[30:12] Balance Rowan I like that and those are
[30:14] new he has to find a way to cause an
[30:16] imbalance
[30:18] right he's got to find a way to poison
[30:19] it
[30:20] so I'm going to skip what the woman has
[30:22] this saying come to verse 4 and Genesis
[30:24] 3. and the serpent said unto the woman
[30:26] ye shall not surely die wait what
[30:30] now in the beginning well God said you
[30:32] hasn't he said you could eat of every
[30:34] tree of the the uh in the garden but now
[30:36] when the woman says but if we eat that
[30:38] one we die
[30:40] and now notice how it's just
[30:43] again Satan cannot create a kingdom he
[30:46] cannot create a world so he has to
[30:48] pervert what already exists
[30:50] so now that he has already begun to work
[30:53] on her
[30:55] and find is finding his way into the
[30:57] ground his with the poison of unbelief
[31:00] and doubt because that's what he uses
[31:02] those are the that's the formula that
[31:03] Satan uses is unbelief and doubt and
[31:06] once he uses that notice how easily he
[31:09] uses an outright lie
[31:12] hey so this is just me dramatizing this
[31:16] that God does not write the story to say
[31:18] that as the serpent walked by the woman
[31:21] one day he says you know that if you eat
[31:22] that tree you won't die it's not what he
[31:24] starts with
[31:25] there's some other pretense
[31:28] there's trying to form some sort of
[31:30] Alliance and some appearance of while
[31:32] we're together in this and are we all
[31:34] God's creation shouldn't we all just get
[31:35] along and there's some appearances that
[31:38] are being expressed there and being set
[31:40] out in this image and once he
[31:41] establishes that he has no problem now
[31:43] you can go to the Bible and find this
[31:45] over and over and over again to the
[31:46] nature of the wicked they have no
[31:50] problem just outright lying in
[31:53] fabricating
[31:55] complete absolute dishonesty without any
[31:58] conscience
[31:59] you know why they'd convinced themselves
[32:01] that their objective is right in any
[32:03] means they can justify
[32:05] even to the point to where I remember
[32:08] brother Randy you're the one that told
[32:09] me this some men ungodly men rose up
[32:12] against brother bisco and begin to sow
[32:15] poison and when their plan failed they
[32:17] confessed to brother Randy well 90
[32:19] percent of it was lies anyways but at
[32:22] least some of it was truth I might have
[32:24] got the percentages wrong
[32:26] they have no problem no problem even
[32:29] admitting to dishonesty
[32:33] because they've convinced themselves
[32:34] that their objective is right
[32:38] so he resorts to an outright lie
[32:42] lies are at the heart of Satan's kingdom
[32:49] now
[32:51] pay very careful attention if you would
[32:53] to the nature of the poison that's being
[32:55] spread into the world
[32:57] God sowed good seed now the wicked one
[32:59] is coming and he's sowing bad seed
[33:03] it was uh I know that we've touched on
[33:05] this in the past that there is the tree
[33:08] of knowledge of Good and Evil in the
[33:09] Tree of Life what Satan wants is the
[33:10] Tree of Life
[33:12] he cannot create only pervert
[33:15] therefore what he's trying to gain
[33:17] access to is that which can bring forth
[33:19] life
[33:20] he's wanting to find a way that he can
[33:22] bring forth his own
[33:24] and he knew according to Genesis 1 that
[33:27] the seed
[33:28] was according to Genesis chapter one The
[33:31] the seed was in each specie to bring
[33:33] forth after its kind he knows this God
[33:36] has spoken he sees God in creation that
[33:38] God has put within each specie each
[33:40] plant each tree each Beast that there is
[33:42] a fruit there is a seed inside of it to
[33:45] bring forth of its kind so what Satan
[33:47] accomplishes in Genesis 3 is a mixture
[33:50] of trees
[33:52] he takes a seed of the beast of the
[33:55] field and the seed of the woman and he
[33:57] mixes the trees together so he takes the
[34:00] tree of man and the tree of the Beast of
[34:02] a beast and he mixes it by using the
[34:04] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[34:07] notice the tree of not the knowledge of
[34:09] Good and Evil and I know these things
[34:11] are symbolic in their representation
[34:13] that that's a mixed Tree in itself
[34:16] and so he is mixing these things
[34:19] together and Jesus God had said of the
[34:21] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou
[34:23] shalt not eat of it remember he said
[34:24] devil said You shall not surely die he
[34:27] said Thou shalt not eat of it for in the
[34:28] day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt
[34:31] surely die
[34:33] so there there are seeds that God
[34:36] planted that are good seeds
[34:39] and if those seeds mix it brings forth
[34:43] death
[34:44] and God's judgment upon those that mix
[34:47] is death
[34:49] so by high breeding by mixing the trees
[34:52] it changes God's original program and so
[34:54] death is sown into it
[34:57] death is there and now judgment is upon
[35:00] because you remember God said about Adam
[35:02] and the woman that guard the Tree of
[35:04] Life lest they partake of it and never
[35:06] die
[35:07] so it is it is by the punishment of God
[35:10] that they their life expires but now and
[35:13] there's death upon the race but there's
[35:15] a way that if they took the tree of life
[35:17] they live forever but Satan mixes the
[35:20] seeds and that brings death because of
[35:22] God's law
[35:24] God said it
[35:26] and then the consequence of this
[35:27] original sin and this is a lot to chew
[35:30] on and we could go through this in
[35:31] Greater detail Through the Bible but the
[35:33] consequence of the original sin is a
[35:35] poison nature that's completely
[35:37] incongruent a discrepancy completely
[35:39] incongruent with the original word
[35:42] it is not the nature of what God
[35:44] originally sowed
[35:45] it's poison nature it's poison nature
[35:48] that builds worldly kingdoms
[35:50] from that moment on as we'll look at
[35:52] this all the kingdoms of the world and
[35:55] all that is in the world and all that is
[35:56] in the flesh has come by way of this
[36:00] poison
[36:02] in Isaiah chapter 14 verses 12 to 14
[36:05] . speaking of Lucifer oh Howard thou
[36:07] fallen from heaven son of the morning oh
[36:09] Lucifer son of morning
[36:11] how about thou cut down to the ground
[36:13] which did US weaken the Nations
[36:16] Satan weakened the word there's disabled
[36:19] the Nations the word that's used Nations
[36:20] there is a word that's used for Humanity
[36:23] in general
[36:24] Satan weakened Humanity
[36:28] because of verses 13 and 14. God had
[36:31] sowed good seed
[36:33] there was the potential within that seed
[36:35] to bring forth man because Adam is man
[36:38] Humanity mankind
[36:40] and then Satan found a way to weaken or
[36:43] disable humanity and he says you were
[36:46] cut down to the ground and you weakened
[36:47] the Nations he's cast down to Earth from
[36:49] heaven he weakens the Nations and this
[36:51] is why this is his because of this and
[36:53] by his ambition in these two verses for
[36:55] thou has said in thy heart I will Ascend
[36:58] into heaven I will exalt my Throne a
[37:01] kingdom is what he's after above the
[37:04] stars of God he's been cast down to
[37:06] Earth but now he wants to rise above
[37:08] heaven the stars of God I will sit also
[37:10] upon the Mount of the congregation in
[37:13] the sides of the north beautiful imagery
[37:14] and symbolism there I will Ascend above
[37:16] the heights of the cloud I will be like
[37:19] the most high notice how that his only
[37:21] way is to Aspire to ascend
[37:24] but it's God who descends
[37:27] Satan is only wanting to ascend but God
[37:30] desires to descend not God it's Satan
[37:33] wants to go to heaven
[37:34] but God wants to bring Heaven to Earth
[37:38] and pride if you look at this pride and
[37:40] Prestige as Satan begins to talk and God
[37:42] begins to reveal what's in his heart
[37:43] these are elements I want you to
[37:45] recognize the worldly kingdoms these are
[37:46] the seeds that are sown in the beginning
[37:47] uh the he's the father of Lies
[37:51] dishonesty now you can begin to see this
[37:53] Pride this Prestige the pretense
[37:56] that's his poison
[37:58] he wants a beautiful kingdom he wants a
[37:59] powerful Kingdom brother Branham is
[38:01] going to quote from Ezekiel 28 he says
[38:02] watch the evil controls of this world
[38:04] now
[38:05] these are this is the evil that controls
[38:07] the world in Ezekiel 28 son of man take
[38:10] up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus
[38:12] and saying thus saith the Lord God and
[38:14] you'll see that this is an image of
[38:16] Satan thou seal us up the sum full of
[38:18] wisdom and perfect in Beauty and and
[38:21] what that phrase means is you draw a
[38:24] picture of yourself
[38:26] you form an image of yourself and you
[38:29] represent yourself as the Perfection of
[38:32] wisdom and beauty
[38:33] so Satan's kingdom is pretense
[38:36] false seeds a false Beauty pretense are
[38:39] his seeds this is I want you to
[38:41] recognize the seeds of his kingdom how
[38:44] Satan moves the politics the pretense
[38:46] the prestiges The Pride the way that he
[38:48] works
[38:49] and this is thou has been in the garden
[38:51] of God every precious stone was not
[38:54] covering so it says thou has been in the
[38:56] garden of God Genesis chapter 3.
[38:59] and then it says every precious stone
[39:01] was thy covering
[39:03] now that that is an interesting way of
[39:06] placing it the Sardis topaz Diamond
[39:09] Borough Onyx Jasper Sapphire Emerald
[39:11] carbuncle and gold so you have all these
[39:13] precious stones and then the gold the
[39:15] workmanship of thy tablets and of thy
[39:17] pipes was prepared in the end the day
[39:18] that thou was created
[39:19] and it says iniquity was found within
[39:21] them uh within the anointed cherub and
[39:24] and there was uh there was no sin no
[39:26] iniquity and then his imperfections when
[39:29] uh until the iniquity was found in them
[39:32] is that we could continue to read but
[39:33] we're not going to do it
[39:35] but God is using the king of Tyrus to
[39:37] show Satan's ambition
[39:39] this is the embodiment of Lucifer's
[39:40] agenda God is using this as it would be
[39:43] a pronounced on uh whoever this King was
[39:45] and whoever it represented he I mean he
[39:47] couldn't have been in the Garden of Eden
[39:48] the literal King a prince at that time
[39:50] could not have been a Garden of Eden but
[39:51] he's using this king's arrogance he's
[39:53] using this king's pride he's using the
[39:55] pretense of his kingdom and all of his
[39:57] power to show Satan's ambition in the
[39:59] beginning
[40:00] it even says in Ezekiel in that chapter
[40:02] verse 6 he set his heart as the heart of
[40:05] God
[40:06] oh my think of that kind of wickedness
[40:08] he set his heart as the heart of God why
[40:11] because he wants to be worshiped as God
[40:14] he craves popularity
[40:17] he creates power
[40:19] and if I can say this if if in the way
[40:21] that I'm wording it to this point
[40:23] because I I'm beginning to recognize now
[40:24] that some of these uh some of the ways
[40:27] that I'm wanting to bring this into a
[40:29] more direct application
[40:32] or maybe a little bit further away for
[40:34] us today if you're having if you're
[40:37] having the first instinct is to begin to
[40:39] look out when these things are brought
[40:41] up that's fine but just be sure you come
[40:44] back to this
[40:46] right be sure to just kind of look at
[40:48] yourself be like
[40:51] okay
[40:52] right
[40:54] these are the things of the world
[40:57] this this is the enmity in every human
[40:59] being
[41:01] and for him
[41:03] he craves popularity he craves power
[41:07] but he can only he he cannot create
[41:10] right
[41:11] he can only pervert
[41:13] he can only impersonate
[41:16] he's a mimic weed
[41:18] it's a stowaway seed it's wheat's evil
[41:20] twin is what he's going to produce
[41:23] and so notice how that his covering is
[41:25] Sardis topaz Diamond Burl Onyx and
[41:27] Jasper Sapphire all these elements that
[41:30] we would find represented in the Earth
[41:34] and then we also find it's represented
[41:36] in the New Jerusalem
[41:37] when God is describing the Lamb's wife
[41:40] as a city the foundation the wall of the
[41:42] city were garnished with all manner of
[41:44] precious stones the foundation was
[41:46] Jasper Sapphire calcutty Emerald
[41:49] sardonyx Sardis crystallite Burl topaz
[41:53] christopherus Jason amethyst these are
[41:56] all the the the
[41:58] gemstones in the foundation
[42:01] of the city of God
[42:03] what is Satan trying to do he's trying
[42:05] to present himself
[42:07] as what God's trying to achieve
[42:10] God made the Earth for a purpose if I
[42:12] could just do this in type in the Earth
[42:14] are precious stones the Earth by
[42:16] pressure and by our composition and by
[42:20] nature and nurture is producing
[42:22] gemstones within its crust within its
[42:25] atmospheres below and then those
[42:27] emeralds and those diamonds and these
[42:29] pearls and these things that are being
[42:31] formed by the elements that are within
[42:32] the Earth God made the Earth to bring a
[42:35] bride out of it the most important thing
[42:37] there is in the Earth today is getting a
[42:39] bride out of the earth that's the most
[42:41] important job and so Satan wants to
[42:44] mimic
[42:46] and he wants to set forth an image to
[42:49] say I have achieved
[42:52] a bride from the earth because look at
[42:54] all the elements and all the images and
[42:56] all the pearls and all the gold and all
[42:58] the wisdom and all the power and all the
[43:00] beauty
[43:01] it's a false Church you'll find it in
[43:03] Babylon we'll come to it later
[43:06] the seeds of Genesis 3 you'll begin to
[43:08] find in Revelation 17 and Revelations
[43:09] 18.
[43:11] so mimicry is his method
[43:15] religion
[43:19] uh religion is is part of his poison is
[43:22] deforming power
[43:26] just remember that how he uses mimicry
[43:32] and if I could say this the instruments
[43:39] the instruments that build worldly
[43:40] kingdoms the things that Satan used both
[43:42] in ambition
[43:44] in tactics to build his kingdom are the
[43:47] same today
[43:50] and so the beginning of worldly kingdoms
[43:53] uh this is you know I sometimes take
[43:55] surveys so this is a little pop-up
[43:58] in the middle of the sermon that you've
[43:59] gotta you gotta answer a question before
[44:01] we can go any further
[44:03] those who do continuing education
[44:04] exactly what I'm talking about
[44:06] but this is the point where I say are
[44:09] you are you with me so far can you at
[44:11] least someone you don't have to see the
[44:12] full picture right because no nobody
[44:14] does and no one Minister does see the
[44:16] whole picture so I'm just trying to
[44:18] describe you the part that I see
[44:20] and how that the the tares were sown by
[44:24] the wicked one
[44:26] and the tares are then not good seed it
[44:31] the the the the process
[44:34] is two good seeds
[44:38] out of their place
[44:40] crossing a mixing
[44:43] and that's how Satan gains access
[44:47] so that's I guess that's that's what I'm
[44:50] going to try to show you to the
[44:51] remainder of this service then is if we
[44:53] can see the parable of the kingdom and
[44:56] this the tares are poison it deforms
[44:59] it's going to build worldly kingdoms so
[45:01] in Genesis 4 the beginning of the
[45:03] worldly kingdoms raise up with the birth
[45:06] of twins
[45:07] Cain and Abel remember tear is a mimic
[45:09] weed it's wheat's evil twin
[45:11] so Cain
[45:13] though he's from a mixed tree would look
[45:15] in every way just like Abel
[45:17] every way
[45:19] we look just like Abel
[45:22] and in Genesis Chapter 4 verses 1 and 2
[45:24] and Adam knew Eve his wife and she
[45:25] conceived you'll notice in this there's
[45:27] only one knowing and and two conceptions
[45:29] and bearings and she conceived in Bear
[45:31] Cain and said I have gotten a man from
[45:33] the Lord and she again bear his brother
[45:35] Abel I think all agree that there were
[45:37] Twins and Abel was a keeper of sheep and
[45:40] Cain was a tiller of the ground notice
[45:43] they would have been twins when I say
[45:45] they I don't know that they would have
[45:46] been identical I'm not saying they're
[45:47] identical twins but I'm saying you
[45:49] wouldn't be like well one's a donkey
[45:51] one's a a crab right you know but both
[45:55] look like dogs so they both look like
[45:56] cats they both look like there would
[45:58] have been some Affinity with respect to
[46:00] uh species but notice if you could just
[46:02] Ponder this image
[46:04] of how the very first thing that God
[46:07] expresses is what they do
[46:09] enables a keeper of sheep and Cain's a
[46:12] tiller of the ground
[46:13] and remember God called The Serpent a
[46:16] beast of the field
[46:18] and when it came to God acting
[46:23] after sin he slew a lamb
[46:27] enabled by Revelation becomes a keeper
[46:29] of the Sheep
[46:31] and came by education
[46:33] because he's taught that it was fruit
[46:35] becomes a tiller of the ground
[46:38] now when it says that I have gotten a
[46:40] man from the Lord
[46:42] notice how the woman
[46:46] recognizes all life comes from the Lord
[46:48] and the Bible does not say that Cain was
[46:51] begotten by Adam but acquired by Eve
[46:57] Cain means acquired it comes from to
[47:00] lament or well and even kind of has some
[47:02] symmetry with chant why because he's the
[47:04] son of the enchanter
[47:05] even in his name it's trying to create
[47:07] this connect these dots back to the
[47:09] serpent and there's no scripture that
[47:11] directly references Cain as being Adam's
[47:13] son but when the Bible speaks of him
[47:16] he's identified with Satan
[47:18] and as far we've got to recognize that
[47:21] this is to me I know just teaching that
[47:23] I just feel is so important to enter
[47:25] into the record so important
[47:27] if there's going to be an indictment
[47:30] there has to be evidence if there's
[47:32] going to be a Vindication there has to
[47:34] be evidence I'm entering evidence
[47:36] and in first John chapter 3 verse 12 not
[47:39] as Cain who is of that Wicked one and
[47:41] slew his brother and why did he slay him
[47:44] because his own Works were evil and his
[47:46] brothers righteous
[47:48] now we know that Cain was not the
[47:51] literal seed of Satan
[47:54] but he was vicariously of Satan through
[47:57] the influence of the serpent
[48:00] this is the law of genetics
[48:03] the law of heredity
[48:05] the law that nature is going to be
[48:06] passed by those that are bred together
[48:08] and so the law genetics say that the the
[48:10] child or the progeny received the traits
[48:13] and characteristics from the father and
[48:16] the mother
[48:17] all right that's why if anybody asks you
[48:19] what that baby looks like you just say
[48:20] he looks just like his dad and mom
[48:23] it's the only safe answer there is it
[48:25] looks just like his dad and mom and if
[48:28] they say well he's adopted say I'm
[48:29] telling you I don't know what they look
[48:31] like I just know that's what he looks
[48:33] like
[48:34] it's always a way out of it
[48:36] but that's why because it's going to be
[48:38] mom and dad
[48:40] this helps us understand original sin we
[48:42] really got to recognize these aspects of
[48:43] original sin because the the serpent
[48:46] seed so to speak is not Satan as a man
[48:50] producing his own creation or bringing
[48:53] forth his own life but it's taking
[48:55] elements of man and Beast
[49:00] so Cain had DNA and nature from Eve the
[49:06] woman that's why she's the mother of all
[49:07] living but then also took a nature from
[49:09] the serpent
[49:11] so he received the nature of The Serpent
[49:13] and the woman
[49:14] so serpent seed is just a mixed nature
[49:18] I think the devil tries to obviously
[49:20] right he wants to cast uh some questions
[49:23] on the the DNA testing you can't rely on
[49:26] those tests you know he wants he doesn't
[49:28] want us to recognize and this is why he
[49:30] attacks this Doctrine so vehemently is
[49:32] because it exposes him and he wants us
[49:35] to kind of present it as well you know
[49:37] it was this and this is what happened is
[49:39] this but we got to just recognize it for
[49:40] what it was it's a mixed nature
[49:44] that's why in the Judgment he says I'm
[49:46] going to put enmity meaning they can't
[49:48] mix anymore
[49:50] and so now watch Cain's nature and I'm
[49:53] just touching this quick I don't know if
[49:54] we'll come back to it at another time
[49:55] but I just want you to see this Cain Now
[49:57] talks in verse 8 chapter 4 came talked
[50:00] with Abel his brother
[50:04] and it came to pass when they were in
[50:05] the field oh I'd love to know that
[50:06] conversation
[50:10] I wonder if it started with did not God
[50:12] say
[50:15] and it came to pass when they were in
[50:17] the field that Cain rose up against Abel
[50:20] his brother and slew him
[50:22] wheat's evil twin is drunk with rage
[50:26] the terror now
[50:29] the poison is set in
[50:32] and now there has not been the only
[50:34] murder there was in the beginning was
[50:36] the intent of Satan through the serpent
[50:38] and now in a jealous rage
[50:41] he acts as jealousy notes these are the
[50:44] these are the seeds of the Kingdom they
[50:45] even find with Joseph and his Brethren
[50:46] why did they throw him in a pit why did
[50:48] they sell them in slavery jealousy
[50:50] these are these are the marks of worldly
[50:52] kingdoms his wheat's evil twin now Cain
[50:56] as a tear he is now there's a mixture
[50:59] there he's like his mommy's like his
[51:01] daddy he doesn't maybe know who his
[51:02] daddy is but he's a mixture there and
[51:05] the nature of the worldly kingdom is
[51:07] manifesting itself and it manifests in
[51:09] Murder
[51:10] and if we were to look at I did we were
[51:12] keeping a scorecard all the nature of
[51:14] the worldly Kingdom it manifests in
[51:17] Pride and pretense and politics and
[51:19] hatred and jealousy and murder all the
[51:22] fruits of the flesh as the Bible calls
[51:24] it
[51:25] find all the things that in the New
[51:26] Testament they start identifying as
[51:28] these are the fruits of the flesh
[51:30] these are the Deeds of the flesh these
[51:32] are the Deeds of the flesh these are the
[51:33] Deeds of the flesh this is the these are
[51:34] the worldly kingdoms and so just to
[51:37] summarize I want to move on the world
[51:39] lady this there's a different nature can
[51:41] we agree there's a different nature
[51:43] exhibited by Cain
[51:45] if you have Adam and the woman living in
[51:47] imperfect Harmony everything's great and
[51:50] wonderful
[51:51] one day the woman eats an apple ah
[51:55] man you shouldn't have done that that
[51:57] was wrong we got to leave our house
[51:59] we've been evicted and all because mom
[52:01] ate an apple Cain's got these kind of
[52:04] behavior problems
[52:07] we're doomed right
[52:09] we are in big trouble
[52:13] if that's all it takes for your son to
[52:15] be a murderer
[52:16] no wonder we have so many serial killers
[52:18] these days
[52:19] right because all she did was eat the
[52:21] wrong kind of fruit and all of a sudden
[52:22] her Kenya just just wait till you start
[52:24] having kids right and that's what they
[52:26] all say well I can't wait till you have
[52:27] teenagers I don't know how many parents
[52:29] have wished failure on their kids
[52:32] well you think your kids are good now
[52:34] just wait and then you know I guess the
[52:36] right response is well I guess they do
[52:38] have your nature somehow
[52:42] foreign
[52:44] but it's a different nature exhibited by
[52:46] Cain
[52:47] he manifests he's manifesting traits and
[52:49] characteristics of a poisoned seed
[52:53] I say well then what made the serpent so
[52:55] bad
[52:57] good question
[52:59] maybe I should have researched that
[53:00] before
[53:02] I ask there's a rule in trial law write
[53:05] this down
[53:06] you'll be tested on this later
[53:08] never ask a question you don't know the
[53:10] answer to all we're getting
[53:13] and it's best just to ask questions that
[53:15] are yes or no or doesn't matter how they
[53:18] answer it the point's already been made
[53:20] you want to argue with me
[53:22] come on
[53:26] now
[53:28] and brother man says this it's all just
[53:29] have brother Brandon asked the questions
[53:31] Church age book chapter three now why
[53:33] did this have to be so he's referring
[53:35] specifically to the original sin and the
[53:37] resulting consequences why did this have
[53:40] to be so why was it that the seed of the
[53:42] serpent must come this way
[53:44] good questions right
[53:47] wow wow wow to this answer
[53:50] Man was created for God
[53:53] man was to be the temple of God
[53:57] the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit
[53:59] was man the temple remember Satan wants
[54:01] to set in the throne and be worshiped as
[54:05] God
[54:06] even his ambition in the end the
[54:08] Antichrist what we see in King Tyrus and
[54:10] the serpent in the beginning is
[54:11] exhibited the representative of Satan
[54:13] and the Antichrist he says Man was
[54:15] created for God man was to be a temple
[54:16] of God the place of God's rest was man
[54:19] and notice how God has to express
[54:22] himself as Holy Spirit to do that was
[54:25] man the temple this is the kingdom God
[54:28] desired
[54:30] Heaven resident with men
[54:33] Heaven and Earth fastened together
[54:36] now I'm going to have to go very quickly
[54:38] here through some principles but he says
[54:40] Man was created for God man was to be a
[54:42] temple of God and in Genesis 2 1-3 thus
[54:45] the heavens and the Earth were finished
[54:46] because we're looking at God's rest the
[54:48] Heaven and Earth are finished and all
[54:50] the hosts of them and on the seventh day
[54:52] God ended his work which he had made and
[54:55] he rested on the seventh day from all
[54:57] his work which he had made and God
[54:59] blessed the seventh day and Sanctified
[55:01] it because that in it he had rested from
[55:05] all his work which God created and made
[55:09] so notice what's implied he's resting
[55:12] and not just from work because that's
[55:15] what we look at our Saturdays as oh I'm
[55:16] taking a day off for some people Sundays
[55:18] I don't want to go anywhere do anything
[55:19] this is my day off but it's not that he
[55:21] stops working his work is done
[55:25] he sowed the seeds and now that the
[55:28] heavens and earth are finished listen
[55:30] now that that's finished he can rest
[55:35] because that's where he wants to be
[55:37] that's where he wants to dwell that's
[55:40] where he's expressed that's where he's
[55:42] made known as a lonely god with no
[55:45] nothing else you can't know him so he
[55:48] has to create if I could say a theater
[55:51] he asked to create something that can
[55:55] manifest his hidden Glory manifest who
[55:58] he is and he says I'll use Heaven and
[56:00] Earth
[56:01] so when he creates and it says and all
[56:04] Heaven Earth is finished now God rests
[56:06] not from work but in his work
[56:09] nothing better for a man than the labor
[56:11] and enjoyed the fruits of his labor so
[56:13] now God is resting in his creation God
[56:16] is coming down in the cool of the
[56:18] evening God is fellowship me with man
[56:19] and the woman he is reflected in his
[56:21] creation all the material is laid out he
[56:24] says now I just need to walk with it now
[56:27] I just need to fellowship with it I
[56:29] don't need to work anymore I just have
[56:31] to be and the becoming God will bring
[56:34] the life out of the seed that's there
[56:39] so there is in his Temple
[56:41] in his creation
[56:43] with man Heaven and Earth
[56:46] and in Acts chapter 7 watch this verses
[56:48] 46 to 51 speaking of David who found
[56:50] favor before God
[56:53] and desire to find a tabernacle for the
[56:55] god of Jacob
[56:56] but Solomon built him a house
[57:00] he wanted a plate what's a house it's
[57:01] the way dwells it's his habitations
[57:02] where he finds rest this is where he
[57:04] returns how be it the most high dwelleth
[57:07] not in temples made with hands
[57:11] I saith the prophet Heaven is my throne
[57:14] and Earth is my footstool
[57:18] he's given himself dimensions
[57:22] Heaven is my Throne Earth is my
[57:24] footstool
[57:25] on one hand saying how can you build me
[57:27] a house
[57:29] when Heaven's my throne and Earth is my
[57:31] footstool
[57:32] what house will you build me saith the
[57:35] Lord
[57:36] or what is the place of my rest
[57:39] half thought my hand made all these
[57:41] things oh my goodness this beautiful
[57:44] picture
[57:46] in other words man cannot build
[57:50] a suitable Tabernacle for God
[57:52] we can't we don't have enough AC units
[57:55] we don't have enough spackle we don't
[57:57] have enough gingerbread we don't have
[57:58] enough crown mold and we don't have
[57:59] enough we don't have enough balconies
[58:01] oh there's just no way that you can
[58:03] build a suitable
[58:05] suitable Tabernacle for God because man
[58:08] cannot do it but what does he say has
[58:11] not my hand made all these things why
[58:14] because God man doesn't make God a
[58:17] tabernacle God made man the Tabernacle
[58:22] to be the temple he said Heaven's my
[58:25] throne and not just heaven but Earth is
[58:27] my footstool
[58:29] and so he says as Solomon built him a
[58:31] house when he says Heaven is my throne
[58:33] and Earth is my footstool the prophet
[58:35] Isaiah is not only wanting us to get an
[58:37] image of the Tabernacle which brings
[58:39] Heaven and Earth together but also not
[58:41] just Solomon's Temple but also Solomon's
[58:43] throne
[58:44] brought into the image of God's kingdom
[58:46] and notice what it says about Solomon's
[58:48] throne in second chronicles 9 17-19
[58:50] moreover the king made a great Throne of
[58:53] Ivory and overlaid it with pure gold and
[58:57] there were six steps to the throne
[58:59] with the footstool of gold
[59:02] which were fastened to the throne
[59:05] notice that it's not something
[59:07] distinctly separate but he takes heaven
[59:10] in fascinates to fastens it to the Earth
[59:14] and it's overlaid with gold speak the
[59:16] ivory and the Purity and the white but
[59:18] now it's overlaid for gold he's trying
[59:20] to express his habitation Heavens my
[59:23] Throne Earth is my footstool unless you
[59:26] think that's a doormat and you think
[59:27] that's just something under my feet to
[59:29] describe what I mean by my kingdom but
[59:31] no it's not just my subjects but it's
[59:34] those that will actually be in the
[59:37] throne with me that'll rise up through
[59:40] seven Church ages that'll not only just
[59:43] be brought up into another kingdom but
[59:45] I'll fasten it together by deity
[59:51] footstool fastened to the throne
[59:54] he says there's not like any made in the
[59:57] Kingdom
[59:58] this is a throne
[1:00:00] remember Satan wanted a throne
[1:00:02] this is the Throne of his this was the
[1:00:04] Throne of his ambition
[1:00:06] and so God
[1:00:08] ordained man
[1:00:09] if I could say to be the base
[1:00:12] of his throne
[1:00:15] footstool
[1:00:17] that's that that link
[1:00:23] just like
[1:00:25] if let's just read it and question
[1:00:27] answers on Genesis
[1:00:30] just like Adam in the beginning when he
[1:00:31] was made he was Supernatural he's made
[1:00:34] Supernatural
[1:00:36] and then a body is made from the Earth
[1:00:39] so God ordained man
[1:00:41] Heaven the throne to be fastened to the
[1:00:43] Earth
[1:00:45] and so notice what he does it's just
[1:00:47] it's just like heaven in Adam who's from
[1:00:49] the Earth
[1:00:50] and brother Bram says in question
[1:00:52] answers on Genesis he formed Man Out of
[1:00:53] the Dust of the ground a dust of the
[1:00:55] earth and put a supernatural the
[1:00:57] supernatural spirit
[1:00:58] now he was laying there he says I can
[1:01:00] have many pictures of it I can see Adam
[1:01:02] standing
[1:01:04] let's take it this way see him standing
[1:01:06] like a tree
[1:01:08] God made him he was dead as he could be
[1:01:11] his toes like the roots sticking in the
[1:01:15] ground
[1:01:16] fastened to the Earth
[1:01:19] this is this is the earth now being
[1:01:22] brought up
[1:01:23] and Heaven coming down the Supernatural
[1:01:26] and the natural it's the only way you
[1:01:28] can have Supernatural
[1:01:30] right right
[1:01:31] if all you have if you didn't have
[1:01:32] natural you just have super
[1:01:35] hey so in order to have the supernatural
[1:01:37] he had to have the natural die
[1:01:40] so here he is Earth coming up Heaven
[1:01:43] coming down to be embodied and reflected
[1:01:45] in Adam who represents Heaven and Earth
[1:01:47] and hidden in the earth is Heaven's
[1:01:50] mystery of a bride a woman that's going
[1:01:52] to come forth here it is forming up and
[1:01:54] his toes are in the earth like roots
[1:01:56] sticking to the ground and God breathed
[1:01:58] the Breath of Life in him and he jumped
[1:02:00] and came to himself
[1:02:02] breathe the Breath of Life in him and he
[1:02:03] became a living Soul let me say this is
[1:02:06] the temple this is the Tabernacle this
[1:02:09] is the throne this is the kingdom
[1:02:12] these are the seeds that God sowed God
[1:02:15] had ordained the Earth to manifest
[1:02:16] Heaven's Glory this mystery is hidden
[1:02:18] Adam now God is bringing up we see it's
[1:02:20] fastened the throne is being fastened to
[1:02:22] Earth
[1:02:24] because Adam we know there's a king on
[1:02:26] Earth
[1:02:27] now I got carried away there
[1:02:31] this is why this is the reason for the
[1:02:34] original sin
[1:02:36] everything I just expressed to you I
[1:02:38] Amplified brother I said Man was created
[1:02:39] for God man was to be a temple of God
[1:02:41] and he's saying that to answer the
[1:02:43] question why did this have to be why did
[1:02:44] the seat of the serpent have to come
[1:02:45] this way
[1:02:46] the reason
[1:02:48] he's asking and then I say this is the
[1:02:49] reason why because man was the temple
[1:02:52] this is the reason why it came the way
[1:02:54] it did this is the reason why it had to
[1:02:55] come the way it did because Satan knew
[1:02:57] this
[1:02:59] Satan knew this all along
[1:03:02] and so he had that's where he goes for
[1:03:05] his to get his kingdom
[1:03:07] I said but Aaron where did you get that
[1:03:08] uh Chapter 3 of the church age book
[1:03:10] Satan has known this all along
[1:03:14] he had one job
[1:03:15] is it not in there I had one job Satan
[1:03:19] has known this all along he wants to
[1:03:21] dwell in man even as God so does
[1:03:25] Satan has known this all along he also
[1:03:28] wants to indwell man even as God so does
[1:03:31] why did it have to be this way why did
[1:03:34] everything come this way because Satan
[1:03:36] knew all along that that was God's
[1:03:38] Temple and God's Tabernacle he can't
[1:03:40] build his own but he can deform it he
[1:03:42] can't create his own but he can
[1:03:44] desecrate it he can pervert it he can
[1:03:46] deform he can defile he can poison Satan
[1:03:49] wanted to end dwell man as God does but
[1:03:51] God has reserved to himself that right
[1:03:57] Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared
[1:04:02] in human flesh
[1:04:05] oh
[1:04:07] Satan could not and cannot do that we
[1:04:10] have to be talking about the original
[1:04:11] you'll see this he does not have
[1:04:13] creative powers are we counting does
[1:04:15] that count as eight the only way for
[1:04:17] Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do
[1:04:19] was to enter the serpent in Eden
[1:04:23] even as he entered by evil spirits into
[1:04:26] the swine of gatara
[1:04:29] you know in the scripture when the the
[1:04:31] evil spirits were cast out a legion and
[1:04:34] it went into the swine
[1:04:36] and and and I think kind of the history
[1:04:38] teaches us unless you get kind of upset
[1:04:40] that those Farmers living was ruined as
[1:04:42] I believe that the the the mythology is
[1:04:44] that those were Jews who shouldn't have
[1:04:46] been hurting them to begin with
[1:04:47] right and so the the evil spirits could
[1:04:51] enter into swine could enter into
[1:04:52] animals we could see that from scripture
[1:04:55] he said but God does not enter animals
[1:05:01] if you have any trouble at all figuring
[1:05:03] that out just buy a cat
[1:05:08] stick with me brother Micah
[1:05:12] but Satan can and will to accomplish his
[1:05:15] ends
[1:05:17] he could not have a child directly by
[1:05:20] Eve as God did by Mary so he entered
[1:05:24] into the serpent and then beguiled Eve
[1:05:26] he seduced her and by her did Satan have
[1:05:30] a child vicariously
[1:05:32] so he's not the literal spawn of Satan
[1:05:34] he is not the literal seed of Satan but
[1:05:37] Satan was able to access the serpent and
[1:05:39] influence him to mix Cain bore the full
[1:05:42] spiritual characteristics of Satan and
[1:05:44] the animalistic Central fleshly
[1:05:46] characteristics of the serpent
[1:05:49] no wonder the holy spirit said that Cain
[1:05:51] was of that Wicked one he was
[1:05:54] out if I'm running out of time then let
[1:05:56] me say this
[1:06:00] do you notice what happened then
[1:06:04] you say well how come why didn't God
[1:06:06] just
[1:06:07] in why didn't the serpent just indwell
[1:06:09] the woman
[1:06:10] why don't he just go go to Adam he
[1:06:13] couldn't
[1:06:14] Adam couldn't just be there and all of a
[1:06:16] sudden be possessed with an evil spirit
[1:06:17] it was impossible
[1:06:19] but the serpent could be influenced
[1:06:22] and so now the serpent realizes I have
[1:06:25] no access to man
[1:06:27] I can't get into man
[1:06:29] I I can't I can't work in his mind I
[1:06:32] can't possess him I can't influence him
[1:06:34] I can't I can't get in there I can't
[1:06:36] organically get into him so what he does
[1:06:37] is he gets into the serpent
[1:06:40] and he causes her to bring forth the
[1:06:42] child that now that he's hybrid that's a
[1:06:47] nature that God did not reserve for
[1:06:49] himself to dwell in
[1:06:51] so now he can embody and inhabit any
[1:06:56] flesh that comes hybrid
[1:06:59] and if I could say this worldly kingdoms
[1:07:01] only exist because Satan's poisonous
[1:07:03] influence
[1:07:04] and so what he does is he uses God's
[1:07:05] original seeds
[1:07:07] and he mixes them to create something
[1:07:09] that he could access
[1:07:12] it's a an evil twin
[1:07:15] one he can't get into
[1:07:17] how come he didn't get into able and
[1:07:19] make him offer fruit of the ground
[1:07:22] why did he just possess him why didn't
[1:07:23] they just why didn't they do a murder
[1:07:25] suicide just end it all right there
[1:07:27] just take care of it boom it's over
[1:07:28] we're all dead we're all done all
[1:07:30] there's all there is left is a bunch of
[1:07:31] snakes
[1:07:33] he couldn't get in it
[1:07:35] but he used God's original seeds
[1:07:39] and brother Branham says we don't want
[1:07:40] any of your mixed trees we don't want
[1:07:43] none of your mixed trees denominations
[1:07:46] think of that market denomination think
[1:07:47] of the mark of the serpent seed think of
[1:07:49] the marks of these things
[1:07:51] it's a mixed well a mark of a worldly
[1:07:54] kingdom is a mixed tree
[1:07:56] anything mixed is denominational
[1:08:00] what we look for is the denomination
[1:08:03] right and that and then we and then we
[1:08:05] deduce
[1:08:06] a mixed tree if you see a mixed tree
[1:08:09] it's denominational
[1:08:12] but this is how Satan gets access to the
[1:08:15] the kingdom of man
[1:08:17] is through mixed flesh
[1:08:19] this is how he's worshiped as God
[1:08:22] this is why there's death there's death
[1:08:24] in anything mixed anything hybrid
[1:08:26] brother Bram says in God's power to
[1:08:28] transform
[1:08:29] I'm wrapping this up quickly how he says
[1:08:31] now how the poison is struck the Earth
[1:08:33] struck the struck the church struck the
[1:08:35] Earth Satan's poison upon the seeds has
[1:08:38] put cavities in it and cause it to be
[1:08:40] deformed more and more he sinks deep
[1:08:43] into the heart of the hearts of the
[1:08:44] churches and of the hearts of the people
[1:08:46] and everything science science
[1:08:48] just permeating
[1:08:50] until it become a place where the human
[1:08:51] race being interbred I believe every
[1:08:54] seed should bring forth of its kind in
[1:08:56] the human race and the plant are all
[1:08:57] being interbred and has brought us to a
[1:08:59] place and eating our food from the earth
[1:09:01] our bodies have made hybrid it's put our
[1:09:03] whole Minds I know it's kind of chopped
[1:09:05] pieces but if our bodies are falling
[1:09:07] from 20 to 25 years old because of
[1:09:09] degenerated cells by hybrid Foods don't
[1:09:11] our brain cells degenerate
[1:09:15] I think I think he's he's asking us
[1:09:17] rhetorical because I think he's assuming
[1:09:19] that everybody would recognize this and
[1:09:20] say if hybrid foods and what do they
[1:09:23] champion in more and more of these days
[1:09:24] is all these processed foods and hybrid
[1:09:26] foods are destroying the body and they
[1:09:28] don't realize what it's doing to the
[1:09:29] mind
[1:09:32] and all the dysmorphia and all the
[1:09:34] confusion and everything but these
[1:09:37] things are on the increase because of
[1:09:38] hybriding
[1:09:40] and he says isn't that also that's why
[1:09:42] he says Ricky's run to the street with a
[1:09:44] hot rod Ricotta and alvidas many of them
[1:09:47] as we would call names out here half
[1:09:49] naked before the people mentally gone
[1:09:51] the Darnell the poison no more
[1:09:55] conceptions of decency or morals
[1:09:57] that's just in that the natural I'm
[1:09:59] thinking the religious Realm
[1:10:01] think of the place that it's come to
[1:10:03] even in the religious realm where
[1:10:05] there's just there's no decency there's
[1:10:07] no respect there's no Integrity there's
[1:10:09] no love there's no real love
[1:10:13] he says it's Poison Poison Poison Poison
[1:10:17] as I said before I want to end on this
[1:10:19] thought
[1:10:21] well I think I'm at eight so Satan could
[1:10:23] not create
[1:10:25] he can only pervert
[1:10:26] and Adam and the woman could not be
[1:10:28] possessed by Satan
[1:10:31] could not be possessed by Satan but the
[1:10:33] serpent could
[1:10:35] and then only the woman by Free Will
[1:10:37] could make a choice
[1:10:40] Satan could not dwell in Adam Satan
[1:10:42] could not dwell in the woman
[1:10:44] he had no access to their soul by virtue
[1:10:47] of the pure seed
[1:10:49] why because man was reserved for God
[1:10:54] Satan could have tried to get there but
[1:10:56] realized I'm walled off
[1:10:59] I can't so I've got to produce an evil
[1:11:03] twin
[1:11:04] that looks like the original atom but
[1:11:07] it's not entirely the original atom not
[1:11:10] quite a tame but not fully wild I've got
[1:11:14] to create a Darnell I got to create a
[1:11:16] tear and I'm going to do it through this
[1:11:17] mixing I'm going to solve this poison
[1:11:19] into this race and once I can get a
[1:11:22] mixed seed just as I could inhabit the
[1:11:24] Beast of the field I can inhabit
[1:11:26] anything that's hybrid with that nature
[1:11:29] and that's what gives rise to demon
[1:11:30] possession
[1:11:32] and the whole world has been brought
[1:11:34] forth through this hybriding and now man
[1:11:36] yet is still reserved
[1:11:39] Kate was a hybrid excuse me Kane was a
[1:11:41] hybrid therefore he could be possessed
[1:11:44] that's why brother Brown says he bore
[1:11:45] the spiritual characteristics of Satan
[1:11:48] and the animalistic characteristics of
[1:11:50] the serpent
[1:11:52] and then in Luke 22 3 then entered Satan
[1:11:55] into Judas named Iscariot
[1:11:57] it shows the inspiration behind worldly
[1:11:59] kingdoms it shows Adam could not be
[1:12:02] possessed by Satan so he used Cain
[1:12:06] or Abel couldn't be possessed so he used
[1:12:08] Cain
[1:12:09] use Kane to do what tried to destroy the
[1:12:11] pure
[1:12:12] the good
[1:12:13] and the Bible shows us just as the
[1:12:15] spirit of Satan Satan entered into Judas
[1:12:18] he could have never done that to the
[1:12:19] woman he could have never done that to
[1:12:20] Adam he couldn't have done it to Abel
[1:12:22] but he did it to Cain
[1:12:26] musicians ready yourselves get ready
[1:12:29] I apologize for the cat comment I Need
[1:12:31] You Now
[1:12:34] fake fake of the Kingdom implications
[1:12:39] if this is how and I know it's just a
[1:12:41] really small picture but if we've come
[1:12:43] up to that point and there's good seed
[1:12:45] and there's bad seed
[1:12:47] and all that is in the world is the sin
[1:12:50] the World the Flesh the devil all these
[1:12:51] things lust of the eyes the pride of
[1:12:53] life less of the Flesh and all this is
[1:12:56] what exists within our Natures by our
[1:12:58] first birth and this is where everything
[1:12:59] is
[1:13:00] and then that I think that definitely
[1:13:02] sets forth the worldly kingdoms and
[1:13:05] where we're going to be tracking but
[1:13:06] think of it on the other hand
[1:13:10] what it means to be a part of the
[1:13:11] Kingdom
[1:13:13] now this is where I'd say invert always
[1:13:16] invert I mean because we could just kind
[1:13:17] of get real dour on the worldly kingdoms
[1:13:19] but then what is God wanting us to
[1:13:22] recognize about the kingdom
[1:13:25] think of what this means there are there
[1:13:28] is a race of people if I could put it
[1:13:30] this this way there are a people that
[1:13:33] God has ordained that would be his
[1:13:34] habitation
[1:13:37] and brother Branham says this he writes
[1:13:39] us continuing in the church age book
[1:13:40] well let me let's read from Matthew
[1:13:42] chapter 3 verses 16 and 17. I I do want
[1:13:44] to go ahead and finish with this
[1:13:46] and I gotta get I got to get myself
[1:13:48] lined up here
[1:13:51] I have some more things I want to read
[1:13:55] and uh
[1:13:57] he says this
[1:13:59] and the seat of the wind was literally
[1:14:03] well Matthew chapter three let me read
[1:14:04] this thing first and Jesus when he was
[1:14:07] baptized because he's the seed of
[1:14:10] went upstairs
[1:14:13] and law the heavens were opened up unto
[1:14:15] him
[1:14:17] and he saw the spirit of God descending
[1:14:19] like a dove and lighting upon him
[1:14:22] and law a voice from heaven
[1:14:25] now the sun is in the water on Earth
[1:14:30] and the Earth this body that God had
[1:14:33] created from the same created those
[1:14:35] cells and the the egg and the sperm and
[1:14:37] the woman and brought forth this body he
[1:14:39] is the seed of the woman as the
[1:14:41] scripture says he's standing on Earth in
[1:14:44] the water
[1:14:45] and the voice from Heaven saying this is
[1:14:48] my beloved Son and whom I'm well pleased
[1:14:51] but not just who I'm happy with but in
[1:14:55] whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:14:59] because the heavens open up and the
[1:15:02] spirit of God the Holy Spirit coming
[1:15:05] back to its Tabernacle
[1:15:07] I mean to its Temple and it comes down
[1:15:09] to heaven and it dwells the Son of God I
[1:15:13] say this is the kingdom this is Heaven
[1:15:16] and Earth kissing this is heaven Earth
[1:15:18] embracing
[1:15:19] this is God saying this is what I've
[1:15:22] longed for when man lost his glory I
[1:15:25] couldn't come back and fully dwell and
[1:15:26] inhabit an animal I can't inhabit a
[1:15:29] beast I can't inhabit a brute so I'll
[1:15:31] bring forth one who is bypassed the
[1:15:34] hybridian who's bypassed the poison
[1:15:36] who's bypassed the tariffs and that's
[1:15:39] one I can dwell in that's what I can
[1:15:41] live in
[1:15:45] that's the one that I can come back into
[1:15:47] and that's the one I reserve the right
[1:15:50] man is reserved God Alone appeared in
[1:15:53] human flesh let me say this if I can say
[1:15:56] in its purest form Satan has not
[1:15:58] appeared in human flesh God has only
[1:16:01] appeared in human flesh what you see is
[1:16:04] a deformed hybrid what you battle with
[1:16:07] what you struggle with what horrifies
[1:16:10] you what you detest it's not the real
[1:16:13] genuine seed it's the poison deformity
[1:16:16] but inside of you is a seed of Heaven
[1:16:22] brother Bradham says as a seed of the
[1:16:24] woman was literally God reproducing
[1:16:26] himself in human flesh
[1:16:29] so now we have to see the contrast so
[1:16:30] the seed of the serpent is the literal
[1:16:32] way that Satan found he was able to open
[1:16:33] the door to himself into the human race
[1:16:37] if you thought I had come up with some
[1:16:38] kind of newfangled Theory
[1:16:40] brother Brown just wrote it explicitly
[1:16:42] in the church age book
[1:16:44] that this is how he opened the door to
[1:16:46] himself into the human race
[1:16:47] it was impossible for Satan
[1:16:50] for he is only a created spirit being to
[1:16:53] reproduce himself in the manner which
[1:16:54] God reproduced himself
[1:16:58] so the Genesis account tells us how he
[1:17:00] produced his seed
[1:17:02] and introduced or
[1:17:04] injected himself into the human race
[1:17:08] and recall that Satan is called the
[1:17:10] serpent
[1:17:11] it is his Cedar injection of the human
[1:17:13] race we are speaking of
[1:17:15] wow
[1:17:17] this answers a lot of questions
[1:17:21] and now you have then the kingdom
[1:17:24] and if I could say this the kingdom
[1:17:27] is its own thing
[1:17:30] it has no rivalry
[1:17:33] right yeah
[1:17:35] it just it's the greatest it's the most
[1:17:37] premium it's the it it's the original
[1:17:40] everything else is fake
[1:17:42] everything else is an imposter
[1:17:44] you know who creates the Rivalry the
[1:17:47] little imp that wanted to be this and
[1:17:48] can never be it
[1:17:49] right that's the original Short Man
[1:17:51] complex
[1:17:52] hey
[1:17:54] hey you you think they invented this
[1:17:57] I mean that's what Satan Satan knows
[1:17:58] that's him
[1:17:59] yeah right
[1:18:01] he's brought down to the Earth and he's
[1:18:03] the one that Rivals he hates God's
[1:18:05] Kingdom
[1:18:06] so he's bent he set against the kingdom
[1:18:08] of God
[1:18:09] everything he does is intent on
[1:18:12] destroying the kingdom of God
[1:18:14] and because he does that he gets trapped
[1:18:17] in the works of his own hands he comes
[1:18:19] with death and God's kingdom just repels
[1:18:21] death he comes a disease and God's
[1:18:23] kingdom just repels diseases
[1:18:26] that's why we're taught to just take it
[1:18:28] as we come to it we don't have to pick
[1:18:30] fights we don't have to go devil hunting
[1:18:33] just live the life live the Kingdom Life
[1:18:35] the kingdom is what God desired worldly
[1:18:38] kingdoms have made themselves Rivals and
[1:18:40] enemies to God's kingdom and remember
[1:18:42] the enemy of your enemy is your friend
[1:18:43] and that's why you see all the
[1:18:45] allegiances you do today is not because
[1:18:48] there's actually the kingdom rivalry
[1:18:49] against Satan no because the truth is
[1:18:52] hated by the LIE
[1:18:55] and I say it's the end of time I'm gonna
[1:18:57] it's the end of the sermon
[1:18:59] dogs and cat lovers alike come to your
[1:19:01] instruments
[1:19:04] I say it's it's that now we have the
[1:19:06] worldly kingdoms coming against God's
[1:19:08] kingdom why is Darkness Gathering to
[1:19:10] Gathering against the light
[1:19:13] It's The End Time Showdown
[1:19:15] you start studying Mount Zion
[1:19:17] I think there's been a line drawn
[1:19:22] I see it more and more pronounced in the
[1:19:24] scripture
[1:19:25] I want you to hear this let me just read
[1:19:27] this to you as our musicians play
[1:19:34] um
[1:19:35] I'm just going to read this in Ezekiel
[1:19:48] the word of the Lord came again unto me
[1:19:50] saying
[1:19:51] son of man
[1:19:54] say unto the prince of Tyrus
[1:19:57] because we've we've seen his ambition
[1:19:59] right
[1:20:00] now let's listen to this
[1:20:02] the seeds have been sown
[1:20:04] thus saith the Lord God because thine
[1:20:07] heart is lifted up and thou has said I
[1:20:08] am a god
[1:20:10] I sit in the seat of God in the midst of
[1:20:12] the Seas yea thou art a man and not God
[1:20:17] I think brother Fulcher would like that
[1:20:20] though thou set thine heart as the heart
[1:20:22] of God
[1:20:24] behold wiser
[1:20:28] there is no secret that they can hide
[1:20:30] from thee
[1:20:31] with thy wisdom and with thy
[1:20:33] understanding thou has gotten the riches
[1:20:34] and has gotten gold and silver into thy
[1:20:37] Treasures
[1:20:38] by thy great wisdom and by thy traffic
[1:20:40] hast thou increased thy riches and thy
[1:20:43] heart is lifted up because of thy riches
[1:20:46] therefore thus saith the Lord God
[1:20:48] because thou has set thine heart as the
[1:20:51] heart of God behold therefore I will
[1:20:52] bring strangers upon thee
[1:20:56] Hallelujah I will bring strangers upon
[1:20:59] thee the terrible of the Nations and
[1:21:01] they shall draw their swords against the
[1:21:03] beauty of thy wisdom and they shall
[1:21:05] defile thy brightness they shall bring
[1:21:08] thee down to the pit Thou shalt die the
[1:21:11] deaths of them that are slain in the
[1:21:13] midst of the Seas wilt thou yet save
[1:21:15] before him that saith Thee I am God but
[1:21:18] Thou shalt be a man and know God in the
[1:21:21] hand of him that slayeth thee Thou shalt
[1:21:23] died the deaths of the uncircumcised by
[1:21:26] the hand of strangers for I have spoken
[1:21:29] it saith the Lord God
[1:21:30] oh Hallelujah there will be a people
[1:21:33] that overthrow the king of Tyrus that
[1:21:36] overthrow Lucifer's ambitions
[1:21:39] oh it continues in verse 16 by the
[1:21:41] multitude of thy merchandise they have
[1:21:43] failed think of Revelation 17 and 18
[1:21:45] filled the midst of thee with violence
[1:21:47] they thou and thou has sinned therefore
[1:21:50] I will cast this profane out of the
[1:21:53] Mountain of God and I will destroy thee
[1:21:55] Oh covering cherub from the midst of the
[1:21:58] stones of fire thine heart was lifted up
[1:22:00] because of thine Beauty thou has
[1:22:02] corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy
[1:22:03] brightness I will cast thee to the
[1:22:06] ground I will lay thee before Kings
[1:22:10] Hallelujah lazy before kings that they
[1:22:13] may behold thee thou Hast defile thy
[1:22:16] sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
[1:22:17] iniquities by the iniquity of thy
[1:22:19] traffic therefore I bring a fire from
[1:22:21] the midst of thee it shall devour Thee I
[1:22:24] will bring thee to ashes upon the Earth
[1:22:26] in the sight of all them that behold
[1:22:27] thee all they that Know Thee among the
[1:22:30] people shall be astonished at thee they
[1:22:33] shall be there thou shall be a terror
[1:22:35] and never shalt thou be any more
[1:22:38] Hallelujah there will be an end to these
[1:22:41] worldly kingdoms they will disappear
[1:22:43] they will be vanquished oh he'll lay
[1:22:46] them before Kings I say let the Kings
[1:22:49] arise let the Kings and Priests take
[1:22:52] their position and brother Branham says
[1:22:54] and why little Bethlehem showing all
[1:22:56] these things yeah I think I could say
[1:22:58] this I I'm getting such more and more I
[1:23:02] guess I am so turned off by worldly
[1:23:04] kingdoms I have such a distaste for
[1:23:07] these things Brotherhood says oh Warrior

[1:23:16] to truth I say who will pull their sword
[1:23:19] who will draw their sword the king sword
[1:23:22] so I'm sick of tradition I'm sick of

[1:23:31] Pride and pretense and posturing and
[1:23:33] politics I'm sick of these things I'm
[1:23:35] going to draw the king sword
