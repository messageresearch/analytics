[0:00] again john chapter 16 verses 20 to 22
[0:03] verily verily i say unto you that ye
[0:05] shall weep and lament
[0:07] but the world shall rejoice and ye shall
[0:09] be sorrowful
[0:10] but your sorrow shall be turned into joy
[0:13] christ is speaking about even his then
[0:15] his crucifixion is coming and the sorrow
[0:17] that they would experience
[0:19] a woman when she is in travail have
[0:20] sorrow because her hours come
[0:23] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[0:25] child she remembereth
[0:27] no more the anguish for joy that a man
[0:30] is born into the world
[0:32] and ye thou therefore have sorrow but i
[0:34] will see you again and your heart shall
[0:35] rejoice and your joy
[0:37] no man taketh from you amen you may be
[0:42] seated
[0:52] continue on the subject of pure joy
[0:56] and i felt directed the lord just kind
[0:58] of directed me to the subject of
[0:59] motherhood
[1:01] and how appropriate for mother's day and
[1:04] it just seemed like certain subjects
[1:06] that who'd been i had been studying and
[1:07] pondered
[1:08] uh kind of intersect a little bit and we
[1:10] could use this example of motherhood so
[1:11] i feel very directed
[1:13] to do this to speak on the topic i do
[1:16] not think that we should
[1:18] just grab a subject to speak on just
[1:20] because it is
[1:21] a particular holiday or particular day
[1:23] nor do i think that we should avoid it
[1:25] just because it is
[1:26] that particular holiday a particular day
[1:28] but we desire the lord to give us
[1:29] leadership
[1:30] um to to speak on the things that he
[1:32] would have us to speak on
[1:35] and just to reset a few things about the
[1:37] pure joy that we're uh
[1:39] wanting to explore is we're kind of
[1:42] approaching the thought of experiencing
[1:44] god's full joy while surrounded by
[1:46] conflict and chaos and confusion
[1:49] and really ourselves as believers
[1:51] experiencing
[1:52] and living and having the fullness of
[1:55] joy
[1:56] regardless of what takes place in the
[1:57] world even as some of the songs
[2:00] have ministered that regardless of
[2:02] what's taking place in our lives there's
[2:03] something within us
[2:05] that we're tied to that's more than life
[2:07] itself that's more than
[2:08] circumstance it's more than situation
[2:10] and we derive
[2:11] a satisfaction and a fulfillment from it
[2:14] and so pure joy as we're pondering it is
[2:16] a joy with a divine origin
[2:18] this is not a joy that we experience
[2:20] when we accomplish something in the
[2:22] flesh this is not
[2:23] a joy that we can feel when we ride a
[2:26] ride or we go hunting and we go fishing
[2:28] and so it's not that type of happiness
[2:30] or joy that we're talking about
[2:32] nor is it a psychological defense or
[2:35] some sort of mechanism that we use to
[2:37] tell ourselves everything's okay
[2:39] and i'm sure um you've seen that meme
[2:42] where there's a i don't know if it's a
[2:44] character or whatever it is
[2:45] from a cartoon or something but it shows
[2:47] looks like a little dog sitting there
[2:49] with a coffee
[2:50] cup in the house that's burning down and
[2:51] i think it says i'm fine
[2:53] that's cognitive dissonance and he may
[2:56] see they might be setting forth the
[2:57] principle that in the midst of a fire
[2:59] i'm fine everything's okay but that's
[3:01] not the joy i'm talking about
[3:03] not a psychological defense mechanism
[3:05] that we all have that convinces
[3:07] ourselves that even though we didn't get
[3:08] the promotion or even though
[3:10] we had our savings account drained by
[3:12] through fraud and the bank's not going
[3:13] to give it back
[3:14] i'm somehow happy and okay with that
[3:16] we're talking about a different kind of
[3:18] joy that transcends emotion
[3:21] and so there is a joy that we can look
[3:24] into the scripture and find that is a
[3:25] strength
[3:26] there's a joy that is a power there's a
[3:28] joy that is something that is divine not
[3:30] just a
[3:31] uplifting uplifting emotion or something
[3:34] that we experience
[3:35] in a moment i i'd like for you to
[3:38] um as best as you can just focus on
[3:42] this part because it's very important to
[3:43] the foundation of going into the subject
[3:45] of motherhood
[3:47] and i want to if god would allow us to
[3:49] look into this more deeply in the
[3:51] scripture in the message of the hour
[3:53] but when we talk about joy it's
[3:55] important to catch this joy
[3:57] is connected with purpose and and and i
[4:01] want you to think about this and ponder
[4:02] it very deeply that joy is connected
[4:04] with purpose so it's not just the
[4:06] fleeting or temporal happiness
[4:08] not just something we experience in a
[4:09] moment but it's connected with purpose
[4:11] and to have joy and to experience joy
[4:14] that we're talking about a scriptural
[4:15] joy
[4:16] it's about doing what is worth doing
[4:18] it's about accomplishing something
[4:20] that's worth accomplishing so it's about
[4:21] having meaning and not just doing things
[4:23] and experiencing things that make us
[4:25] happy
[4:26] and there's so much to unpack and so
[4:29] much to share when it comes to
[4:30] understanding
[4:32] happiness and human emotions of
[4:33] happiness and our pursuit of happiness
[4:36] and i'd really like to look at it and
[4:38] explore it very deeply
[4:39] but there's a hedonic happiness we were
[4:42] actually going to talk about eating
[4:43] where you just eat for pleasure
[4:45] on wednesday night we didn't have a
[4:46] chance to get to it but there's a
[4:48] a hedonic pleasure or happiness that we
[4:51] experience where we're just
[4:52] we're just experiencing pleasure
[4:54] something that makes us feel good
[4:56] and we could say that's pleasure for the
[4:57] sake of feeling happier happiness for
[4:59] the sake of making our body feel good
[5:01] but joy
[5:02] is something where you're fulfilling a
[5:04] purpose or if i can put it this way
[5:06] living meaningfully you're having
[5:08] meaningful experiences you're doing
[5:09] something that's meaningful so
[5:11] we talk about happiness well that could
[5:12] just be hedonism where you're just oh i
[5:14] feel good that was great that made my
[5:15] body feel good
[5:16] but when we talk about joy we're talking
[5:18] about experiencing something
[5:19] that is fulfilling or rather living a
[5:22] meaningful life
[5:24] in john chapter 3 verse 29
[5:27] john the baptist has come to him and
[5:29] it's
[5:30] just a remarkable reading how that they
[5:32] come to him and they say hey you know
[5:34] this guy that you told us was the
[5:35] messiah
[5:36] he's baptizing people and john is like
[5:40] okay you know that's who i i said that's
[5:43] the one that you should follow that was
[5:44] the one that was coming after me
[5:46] and so john is answering this question
[5:48] about
[5:49] whether or not this one is doing the
[5:51] right thing and he makes this comment
[5:52] he that hath the bride is the bridegroom
[5:56] but the friend of the bridegroom which
[5:57] standeth and heareth him rejoiceth
[5:59] greatly because of the bridegroom's
[6:01] voice
[6:02] and what a beautiful picture of john the
[6:04] baptist who is allah is coming in as a
[6:06] forerunner in the spirit of elijah
[6:08] who has now pointed the people to the
[6:10] messiah and the messiah is there
[6:12] baptizing and people are coming to him
[6:14] and everybody's like oh well what about
[6:16] elijah what about his message and
[6:18] and what about john and what about him
[6:20] shouldn't we be following him still john
[6:22] says no
[6:23] i'm the friend of the bridegroom my
[6:25] whole purpose was to see that this
[6:27] happens i'm here
[6:28] here to make way for the the bridegroom
[6:30] and now that they're together and
[6:32] they're in fellowship i'm rejoicing it
[6:33] says he rejoiceth greatly
[6:35] because of the bridegroom's voice and
[6:37] then he says this
[6:38] my joy therefore is fulfilled
[6:42] and this is where we can see that
[6:44] scripturally joy is connected with
[6:45] something that is fulfilling
[6:47] joy is connected with purpose because he
[6:49] says my joy is complete
[6:51] if if this had not happened i would not
[6:53] be fulfilled if this had not happened
[6:55] then my joy would be partial or maybe it
[6:57] would just be happiness or it'd be
[6:58] maybe i would be maybe he's even
[7:00] suggested there'd be some
[7:02] disappointment had this not happened she
[7:04] says my joy is complete
[7:06] and that's because joy is connected with
[7:08] fulfillment
[7:09] and so this is joy scripture it's to
[7:11] accomplish something
[7:12] that you're sent out to do john says i
[7:15] this
[7:16] my joy is complete my joy is finished
[7:17] because he had done what he was supposed
[7:20] to do
[7:21] and in the scripture even the word
[7:23] that's used for joy
[7:25] and there's a connection there's a
[7:27] tremendous connection of joy with peace
[7:28] we say shalom
[7:30] and shalom being used as a greeting i we
[7:33] say that it means peace but
[7:34] and it does mean peace and it's
[7:36] connected with with joy this joy that
[7:38] i'm talking about it but in the
[7:40] in the greek to the the word joy that's
[7:42] used actually is used in a phrase to say
[7:45] be well
[7:46] if you wish someone joy or use this
[7:48] phrase joy it means to thrive or to be
[7:51] well so joy is connected with thriving
[7:54] joy is connecting to being well and i
[7:57] can remember
[7:58] uh brother greg alford one time we were
[8:01] hosting him and showing him around to do
[8:03] something and i think he went in to do
[8:05] something he came back out and i said
[8:06] well did you find what you're looking
[8:07] for he says no joy
[8:09] and he used this phrase to describe when
[8:11] something some expectation had not been
[8:13] met or he hadn't fulfilled his purpose
[8:15] rather
[8:16] did you find what you're looking for no
[8:17] joy didn't find any joy didn't have any
[8:19] joy
[8:20] and so it's connected with fulfilling
[8:21] something it's connected with something
[8:23] that has meaning
[8:24] and so a life to live well is what we're
[8:27] talking about when we say joy
[8:29] pure joy is connected with the life that
[8:30] has lived well not just a life that has
[8:32] lived pursuing fleshly pleasure
[8:35] you say oh this feels good and that was
[8:37] fun we're talking about a life lived
[8:38] well life that is flourishing a life
[8:40] that is thriving
[8:41] now it might not have the same optics to
[8:43] somebody who's standing on the outside
[8:44] looking at it
[8:45] that someone who's living in pleasure
[8:46] would live in but when we talk about
[8:48] pure joy we're not talking about an
[8:49] ecstasy
[8:50] ecstasy or some kind of great feeling in
[8:52] your flesh but something very
[8:54] very deep that's connected with meaning
[8:56] and purpose so we're looking at a life
[8:57] that's lived well
[8:58] versus a life that's lived pursuing the
[9:01] pleasures of the flesh
[9:04] and there's so much that could be said
[9:06] in this vein and i know that we'll have
[9:08] opportunities to look at it
[9:10] better but they've identified
[9:14] through vast studies that have looked at
[9:15] a number of um
[9:17] across cross-sections of cultures and
[9:20] regions and people and found that people
[9:22] with a greater sense of purpose lived
[9:25] longer
[9:26] people who themselves individuals who
[9:28] had a greater sense of purpose
[9:30] lived longer than those who maybe had a
[9:32] less sense of purpose and they actually
[9:33] didn't just live longer they lived
[9:35] better
[9:36] so this is science taking a look at
[9:38] individuals who aren't necessarily
[9:39] christians because they've done this in
[9:40] japan
[9:41] they've done in different places that we
[9:42] might say are not christian cultures and
[9:44] they found that as long as a person had
[9:46] a sense of purpose
[9:48] and lived a meaningful life they lived
[9:50] longer and they didn't just live longer
[9:51] but they lived better
[9:53] and one particular book that is very
[9:56] fascinating on this subject
[9:58] is by victor franco and he he was a jew
[10:01] that was in a concentration camps
[10:04] there's a survivor of a concentration
[10:06] camp during world war
[10:07] ii and he wrote a book about the i think
[10:10] his man's search for meaning is the name
[10:12] of the book
[10:13] and what he kind of pulls together and
[10:15] this is me just maybe using some summary
[10:17] language but he's basically sets forth
[10:18] that man's deepest longing
[10:21] is to find meaning and that for
[10:24] humankind not just a man but for
[10:26] humankind their strongest desire
[10:28] is to find some meaning and he calls it
[10:30] their primary motivational force
[10:34] now just so this begins to make some
[10:35] sense to you and you don't feel like we
[10:36] kind of left
[10:37] a sermon and now we're kind of in a
[10:39] psychology class
[10:40] this is what explains religion this is
[10:43] what explains the belief that the son
[10:46] is a god and beliefs that the water is a
[10:47] deity and beliefs and mythology
[10:49] it's always for man to somehow ascribe
[10:52] meaning to their existence
[10:54] and how they navigate that by pleasing
[10:56] gods or pleasing deities or
[10:58] why did this happen to athenia well this
[11:01] god got mad and he wiped it out because
[11:03] this person cheated with that person and
[11:05] this happened
[11:06] and they try to explain everything and
[11:07] give purpose and meaning to advance why
[11:09] because it's one of men's primary or
[11:11] it's the primary motivational force to
[11:13] make sense of life
[11:15] does it have meaning does my life have
[11:17] meaning is it for a purpose and so he's
[11:20] talking about man's deepest
[11:21] desire strongest longing is to find
[11:24] meaning
[11:25] and he makes this statement in his book
[11:27] this is this is so good
[11:29] this is so good life is not primarily a
[11:33] quest
[11:33] for pleasure as freud believed because
[11:36] freud as a
[11:37] psychologist kind of framed everything
[11:39] in the sense of law desires and
[11:41] and if you say something uh well it
[11:43] reminds me of one of my greatest
[11:44] statements i've ever made while
[11:45] preaching is i made the comment i never
[11:47] wanted to be a lawyer
[11:48] and freud would say well that's you said
[11:51] that it was a freudian slip because
[11:53] i was wanting to say liar and i said i
[11:55] don't want to be a lawyer and i said
[11:56] liar lawyer
[11:57] just the whole meeting broke up and i
[12:00] think we just began to sing take the
[12:01] name of jesus with you acapella
[12:03] because there was no getting them back
[12:04] in at that point and i remember saying
[12:06] well that was a freudian slip like
[12:07] there's something deep
[12:08] lurking inside of me where i really
[12:10] didn't want to be a lawyer someone would
[12:11] say what's the difference
[12:12] lawyer liar uh but they said that's a
[12:15] freudian slip why because deep in your
[12:17] psychology somewhere
[12:18] life is about desires and if you if you
[12:20] dream about money it means you have a
[12:22] lush spirit if you dream about lust
[12:23] you're greedy for money and so freud
[12:25] framed things in the sense that man's
[12:27] quest was for pleasure
[12:29] but then he says life's not primarily a
[12:31] quest for power so he says life's not
[12:33] primarily a quest for pleasure as freud
[12:35] believed
[12:35] or a quest for power as alfred adler
[12:38] taught but a quest
[12:39] for meaning that somehow
[12:43] that man is going to make sense he's
[12:44] going to feel of some sense of
[12:46] accomplishment as long as he can ascribe
[12:48] meaning to things that take place in his
[12:49] life
[12:50] he's going to be endure certain
[12:51] difficulties as long as he has some sort
[12:52] of goal in mind
[12:54] and he points out viktor frankl points
[12:56] out that without meaning life becomes
[12:58] full of vice or bad habits
[13:00] without meaning life can become just
[13:02] purely hedonistic and it's full of
[13:04] pleasures and materialism and
[13:05] hatred and boredom and jealousies he
[13:07] says this is what
[13:09] comes from a lack of meaning and lack of
[13:11] purpose
[13:12] now there are some amens that start
[13:14] working in our spirits if you can start
[13:16] looking at this in the context
[13:17] of the ultimate purpose of creation and
[13:19] god's desire for humanity
[13:21] but viktor frankl is identifying that
[13:23] something that's rooted within man that
[13:24] if he doesn't have a purpose
[13:26] he tends to do things that are
[13:28] destructive or to live in a way that
[13:29] only graciates
[13:31] his base instincts and his desires and
[13:33] to feel satisfied
[13:34] and it's what leads to criminal behavior
[13:36] and fraud and drug abuse and alcohol
[13:38] abuse
[13:38] saying he's looking so people without
[13:40] meaning are the ones that are going to
[13:41] tend to do the things
[13:42] that only satisfy the flesh and enter
[13:44] into some cycle of destructive behavior
[13:48] and so if you if if we think about it in
[13:51] that context
[13:52] that joy relates to purpose
[13:56] and joy is about a life that's lived
[13:58] well a life that's thriving that even
[13:59] the word joy speaks of being well or
[14:01] thriving
[14:03] joy then is not the aim
[14:07] in other words we don't say well i just
[14:08] want to be happy and
[14:11] and sometimes i think we kind of say
[14:12] that in a way that is uh
[14:14] a little bit of a barb or condescending
[14:16] well i sure hope you're happy
[14:18] and uh i hope you're happy now are you
[14:21] happy i hope you
[14:22] and it's kind of used in a sense to kind
[14:23] of make a person feel like uh
[14:25] they've done something wrong but joy so
[14:28] our goal well why did you do this and
[14:30] why well i'm just trying to find
[14:31] happiness i'm just trying to find
[14:32] happiness
[14:32] that's not the goal pure joy is not
[14:34] necessarily the the object or the goal
[14:36] that you work for
[14:38] joy is not the aim but rather joy is the
[14:40] outcome of our pursuit of fulfilling our
[14:43] purpose
[14:44] joy is kind of the byproduct it's what
[14:46] comes out of our pursuit
[14:48] of doing what we ought to do as we've
[14:51] been looking at
[14:52] blessed is he who hungers and thirst
[14:54] after righteousness that's
[14:55] the condition as he ought to be to
[14:57] fulfill your purpose to be right
[14:59] and so if we are doing what we know we
[15:01] are called to do
[15:02] there's a sense of satisfaction and
[15:04] fulfillment that comes with it so we're
[15:06] not just do
[15:07] do what makes you happy and do what
[15:08] makes you feel good and do what's going
[15:10] to give you some sort of satisfaction
[15:11] you've got to do what you're called to
[15:13] do you've got to do what fulfills your
[15:14] purpose
[15:15] and in just doing what you know fulfills
[15:17] your calling and doing what you know
[15:18] fulfills your purpose
[15:19] believe it or not there's a joy to be
[15:21] had in fine doing that
[15:24] and i believe what the world tries to do
[15:25] is paint a different kind of picture
[15:26] where it's like well you just kind of
[15:28] have to find that needle in the haystack
[15:29] that's going to make you happy
[15:31] you got to find this you got to find
[15:32] that do this or something that's going
[15:33] to make you happy
[15:34] but really it's about me living a
[15:36] meaningful life and living a life well
[15:38] and living a life according to values
[15:40] and precepts and i'm talking about the
[15:42] word of god
[15:43] and that in doing that you're going to
[15:44] find there's your pure joy
[15:48] now there's many subjects that could be
[15:50] explored to examine this truth
[15:54] now that we're just not merely trying to
[15:56] find happiness or pursue happiness
[15:59] uh there's actually a book that was very
[16:01] good called it's been a long time since
[16:03] i've read it
[16:05] i'm always kind of maybe a little leery
[16:06] to recommend a title because you never
[16:08] know when it's like brother aaron you
[16:09] recommended that book do you know what's
[16:11] in i'm like
[16:11] i forgot all right just read the cliff
[16:14] notes or i read that in law school sorry
[16:17] um but it was a book that was basically
[16:19] the title was stumbling on happiness
[16:22] and the point was basically we talk
[16:23] about the pursuit of happiness
[16:25] and i still kind of i struggle with that
[16:27] even how it's outlined in our
[16:29] i believe it's our declaration of
[16:30] independence or the constitution of life
[16:32] liberty and the pursuit
[16:33] the pursuit of happiness well there's a
[16:36] dark side to that
[16:37] that if that's what your goal is and we
[16:38] just want to be happy and just do what
[16:40] makes yourself happy and pursue
[16:41] happiness
[16:42] they find that you really don't pursue
[16:44] happiness and find happiness you stumble
[16:46] on it
[16:46] when it relates to the human carnal
[16:48] sense of joy and satisfaction
[16:50] those kind of what makes you happy will
[16:52] find it's not always the thing that you
[16:54] think is going to make you happy
[16:55] that's because the human mind is really
[16:57] really really
[17:01] completely haywire the human mind is
[17:04] messed up it's
[17:05] it it's going to fail us time and time
[17:08] again so we don't just go by
[17:09] the human mind of human emotions so
[17:11] there's many subjects can be explored to
[17:13] find that when you get to get down to
[17:14] purpose
[17:15] and you find meaning that's where
[17:17] there's real joy
[17:18] but i want to use the subject of
[17:20] motherhood
[17:23] to identify how there's actually the a
[17:25] battle for joy
[17:27] that it's something that is available to
[17:30] us
[17:31] and yet when we frame things the wrong
[17:33] way or we place them in the wrong kind
[17:34] of context
[17:35] then we find ourselves wrestling and
[17:37] struggle and the wrestling and struggle
[17:38] is what kind of causes the consternation
[17:40] and disappointment we find ourselves
[17:41] despondent because we're fighting but as
[17:43] we've tried to
[17:44] lifted up this principle last week
[17:45] invert always invert
[17:48] but the michael told me he thought it
[17:49] was always introvert always introvert
[17:51] and he thought he was killing it
[17:53] it was like no it's invert invert always
[17:56] invert and in doing that
[17:59] we find that no if i'm fighting let's
[18:01] look at what's happening what's taking
[18:03] place and we realize no
[18:04] i'm not actually being attacked i'm
[18:06] advancing the word is advancing and
[18:09] we're finding the devil in a hiding spot
[18:11] somewhere in our lives and god said
[18:12] you're going to get out of here
[18:13] so the devil's kind of been woken up and
[18:15] there's a fight there's a struggle
[18:16] taking place
[18:17] because you're conquering territory so
[18:19] every battle doesn't mean oh woe is me
[18:21] i'm in a battle but oh
[18:22] something is being possessed something
[18:24] great is happening
[18:26] and so when we look at motherhood we
[18:28] could use some of these same principles
[18:29] of inversion
[18:30] to to identify how that the devil is
[18:32] trying to steal our joy
[18:34] and so i want to look at this battle for
[18:35] joy within the context of motherhood
[18:38] and it's just so remarkable how it works
[18:40] out that it's on mother's day
[18:43] now just a very simple definition of
[18:45] mother it simply means the female parent
[18:48] and and so if we kind of continue to go
[18:50] with it where we're going we're gonna
[18:51] have to lose a lot of words in our
[18:53] vocabulary
[18:55] but a mother is a female parent or the
[18:57] word is meaning one who has given birth
[19:00] and brother brown even uses this i think
[19:02] in the sermon he preaches mother's day
[19:03] he says it's one who is begotten it's
[19:05] one who's given birth
[19:06] and so a mother being the female parent
[19:09] of a child
[19:11] and we know that the mother would be the
[19:12] one who has given birth
[19:15] she's the one that knows a child has
[19:17] been born she knows
[19:18] that child is hers right
[19:21] i said because and so that she's
[19:23] connected with it and the one that she
[19:24] gives birth
[19:25] and only a woman only a woman can enter
[19:27] the office of motherhood
[19:29] that that motherhood it's mother head
[19:31] it's in the office of being a mother
[19:34] now if we just take those very basic
[19:36] simple points that a mother
[19:39] that a woman is only one who can become
[19:41] a mother
[19:42] and a mother is one that births gives
[19:44] birth to a child
[19:46] that's that's we understand to be
[19:48] motherhood a woman who beca
[19:49] who gives birth to a child becomes a
[19:51] mother
[19:52] yet in the the times that we live in now
[19:55] modern culture devalues
[19:57] this sacred virtue that a woman holds to
[20:00] give birth
[20:02] it devalues this sacred virtue that a
[20:04] woman holds to rear children so
[20:06] a woman is blessed with the capacity or
[20:09] the ability and now speaking in general
[20:11] she is granted the physical
[20:12] characteristics to be able to as she
[20:14] matures to be able to
[20:16] bring forth a child to give birth to a
[20:18] child and so this is something that a
[20:21] woman
[20:21] is made for in general she has this
[20:23] ability to do it
[20:25] and so only a woman can do it only a
[20:26] woman can have a child only a woman can
[20:28] be a mother to a child
[20:29] she has this charge and this this virtue
[20:32] to mother children and then to
[20:34] raise those children to be a mother to
[20:36] them for their lives
[20:37] for their entire life there's one thing
[20:39] about being a mother that i can't
[20:41] personally attest to
[20:44] but there's a but it's even been
[20:45] witnessed too and testify when i say
[20:47] that i'm not a mom
[20:48] so i i don't have personal experience
[20:50] about that's what it means like oh
[20:51] brother aaron doesn't like his mom
[20:53] but when it comes to being a mom if you
[20:55] can you can be a spouse but get divorced
[20:57] and you're no longer a spouse
[21:00] but you never stop being a parent you
[21:02] never stop being a mom if that child
[21:04] dies there's still something that does
[21:05] not
[21:05] change that instinct in that in that
[21:08] mother
[21:08] that that loss that they experience and
[21:10] that suffering that they feel and the
[21:12] children can grow up and move on so
[21:13] there's something extraordinary about
[21:15] this calling
[21:16] to be a mother but yet culture devalues
[21:19] this
[21:20] and in genesis chapter 2 verse 18 it
[21:22] says the lord god said it is
[21:24] not good that the man should be alone
[21:27] now i believe this to be very very
[21:28] remarkable we examined it in great
[21:30] detail last year
[21:32] however when god makes this declaration
[21:33] here's a man in eden that was good
[21:36] and things were wonderful and god had
[21:38] placed a man on earth who was in the
[21:40] very
[21:40] image of god but now god's assessment of
[21:43] the man is that it's not good that he
[21:45] should be alone
[21:47] i will make him a help meet for him
[21:51] the takeaway i want to emphasize right
[21:53] now though i know this has been
[21:54] emphasized many many times through
[21:56] the the the history of the word of god
[21:59] we must recognize that
[22:00] man himself was not complete without the
[22:03] woman
[22:04] when god said it's not good he's saying
[22:06] the man is not fulfilled the man is not
[22:08] complete there's still something missing
[22:10] so the man himself and his life would
[22:12] not have been as fulfilling
[22:14] as it was supposed to be without the
[22:16] woman
[22:18] so we have to admit it as men when we
[22:19] get married they say that a man is not
[22:21] complete
[22:22] before he's married and then after that
[22:24] he's finished
[22:27] a man is not complete before he's
[22:29] married but then once he's married
[22:30] then there's there's some completion
[22:32] there's some coming into an office
[22:34] so it's not that the woman was just kind
[22:36] of cooked up uh to kind of help around
[22:38] the the garden but rather
[22:40] man needed the woman to be complete
[22:44] and so though that's something we need
[22:46] to recognize and then also recognize
[22:48] that he says i will make him a help me
[22:50] his work was not finished without her
[22:54] no matter what adam could do he could
[22:55] not finish it without the woman
[22:58] so then the woman now has a very
[23:01] important purpose
[23:02] in god's creation he has meaning to her
[23:06] creation his meaning behind her coming
[23:07] forth god's purpose for a woman
[23:10] now and i feel like we're all family
[23:12] here here and um
[23:15] we're uh you know we're not trying to
[23:17] fight the patriarchy and things like
[23:19] that we can just kind of relax and just
[23:21] preach the word of god
[23:23] but god's purpose for a woman was
[23:25] related to
[23:26] the man this is we believe this to be
[23:30] the creation
[23:31] of man a creation of humanity and when
[23:33] man comes up and then the woman is
[23:35] brought out of the man
[23:36] her she is brought into the picture in
[23:39] with the man
[23:40] in view and with the purpose of bringing
[23:42] forth children
[23:44] so you can't fully understand the woman
[23:47] without the man being in the picture and
[23:50] without the purpose of bringing forth
[23:52] children
[23:53] that this is what gives us uh gives
[23:55] meaning and purpose to the woman now
[23:57] the woman also gives purpose and meaning
[23:59] to the man so it's not just kind of
[24:01] cutting her off and look how she's
[24:02] nothing without the man and you know
[24:04] she's nobody without the man
[24:06] we could emphasize over and over again
[24:08] how the man needed the woman but looking
[24:10] at now the woman her life
[24:11] and her vision and her abilities and her
[24:13] powers are being framed
[24:15] and it's done so with this being brought
[24:17] to the man or that he's being brought to
[24:19] the woman they're being brought together
[24:21] and the purpose of bringing forth
[24:23] children
[24:24] now in titus chapter 2 verses 3 to 5.
[24:32] the aged woman likewise as paul is
[24:34] giving duties to the church he says the
[24:36] aged women they have a duty
[24:38] that they be in behavior as becometh
[24:41] holiness
[24:42] now pay attention to this because
[24:45] sometimes i
[24:46] there's a there's this thought that as
[24:47] long as you're older than somebody else
[24:49] you can always tell them what to do
[24:50] right well i'm older than you the bible
[24:53] says the elders are to teach the younger
[24:54] ones
[24:54] well it's very specific so the age women
[24:58] likewise that they be in behaviors
[25:00] becometh holiness not false accusers not
[25:02] given to much wine
[25:03] teachers of good things that they may
[25:06] teach the young women to
[25:08] be sober to love their husbands to love
[25:10] their children
[25:12] these are things that are being that the
[25:14] the aged women
[25:15] are to teach the younger and as long as
[25:17] their behavior becometh holiness and not
[25:19] false accusers not given to much wine
[25:21] they can be teachers of these things to
[25:23] love their husbands to love their
[25:25] children excuse me
[25:27] so this is saying this is if the aged
[25:29] women are going to teach the younger to
[25:30] love their husbands
[25:31] this is a good thing that they know if
[25:34] they're going to teach them to love
[25:35] their children this is a good thing that
[25:37] the age know that the young must learn
[25:39] and it relates to the purpose of the
[25:40] woman he says to be discreet chaste
[25:43] keepers at home good obedient to their
[25:45] own husbands
[25:46] let the word of god be not blasphemed
[25:49] and when he's telling them to
[25:51] when he's saying that you should teach
[25:52] them to love their children to love
[25:53] their husbands and to be keepers at home
[25:55] it means to be a guardian of the house
[25:57] even some of the older translations
[25:59] render it the workers at home
[26:01] this is where the woman's role and her
[26:04] purpose and her meaning is being
[26:06] is being formed scripturally now he
[26:08] writes this to timothy first timothy
[26:10] chapter 2 verse 15.
[26:12] just identifying that scripturally when
[26:14] paul was said that we must teach the
[26:16] younger women
[26:16] he teaches them to love their husbands
[26:18] and to love their children why that
[26:20] relates to the purpose of the woman
[26:22] you say well does that what about the
[26:24] man he's told to love his wife
[26:26] so it's not that the man is some
[26:28] independent king
[26:29] uh who can do whatever he wants first
[26:32] timothy chapter 2 verse 15
[26:34] notwithstanding he's speaking about how
[26:35] the woman was deceived not adam but he
[26:37] says notwithstanding she shall be saved
[26:40] in childbearing
[26:41] if they continue in faith and charity
[26:43] and holiness with sobriety
[26:45] so the woman is brought to a peculiar
[26:48] place before god and man and so with
[26:50] this peculiar position
[26:51] as paul is wrestling with the fact that
[26:53] it was the woman that was deceived
[26:54] and how that a woman does not
[26:56] necessarily she does not occupy
[26:58] an official office within the church to
[27:00] speak or to teach or to have authority
[27:02] or control
[27:03] he's identifying that she's not
[27:04] completely hopeless and she's not cast
[27:06] aside
[27:07] but he says that she is she is saved in
[27:10] childbearing
[27:10] if they continue in faith charity
[27:12] wholeness with sobriety
[27:15] and that word they're saved i know we
[27:16] might think oh well she's saved in
[27:18] childbearing that that means about here
[27:19] eternal salvation
[27:20] but the word saved means to be made
[27:22] whole or healed
[27:24] so it's more than just oh she's saved by
[27:26] confessing the lord jesus christ but
[27:28] there's something within the woman this
[27:30] is all i'm wanting you to take from this
[27:31] is there so you can be pulled into
[27:33] teaching so much more with these
[27:34] scriptures
[27:35] she is saved she is made whole she is
[27:37] actually healed
[27:39] in child bearing
[27:42] i give you permission to amen if you
[27:44] agree but only if you agree
[27:47] only if the holy spirit and you can say
[27:49] it go ahead and let it out
[27:52] it's not going to bother me at all she
[27:53] shall be saved in childbearing she is
[27:55] made whole she's made complete in having
[27:57] children
[27:58] why it's how god made the woman
[28:04] in first timothy chapter 5 verse 14 i
[28:07] will therefore that the younger women
[28:09] and this is even maybe conclusion a
[28:11] conclusion of what he has already
[28:12] expressed in chapter 2
[28:13] i will therefore that the younger women
[28:15] marry
[28:17] bear children guide the house here's the
[28:20] prophet to this age here's paul
[28:22] laying out these fundamental principles
[28:24] to timothy he's going to teach others
[28:26] these are things that are being
[28:27] established within the christian church
[28:29] and this is a scriptural principle with
[28:31] that this is the general principle that
[28:32] we would lift up this is what we would
[28:34] desire that young women would get
[28:35] married bear children and guide the
[28:37] house
[28:38] this is the glory of the woman this is
[28:39] her calling this is her duty
[28:41] this is what she's called to give none
[28:42] occasion to the adversary
[28:44] to speak reproachably reproachally so
[28:46] what is the bible speaking to and
[28:48] identifying that god made the woman with
[28:51] the purpose and that a woman is going to
[28:52] sense
[28:53] fulfillment when she satisfies that
[28:56] purpose
[28:58] there's going to be a sense of
[28:59] accomplishment and i've done something
[29:01] and there's going to be meaning that is
[29:02] that the woman is going to feel this is
[29:04] going to be her glory or her enjoyment
[29:06] when she marries bears children and
[29:08] guides the house
[29:10] there's a benefit there's a reward in
[29:11] doing those things
[29:13] that this is god's purpose this is god's
[29:15] order this is god's program
[29:16] and when a woman does that there's a
[29:18] salvation that comes with it
[29:19] she should love her husband she should
[29:21] love her children be keepers at home
[29:23] these are things that she's called to do
[29:26] now i'm going to acknowledge well let me
[29:29] let me just say this i was
[29:31] had purpose in my heart that maybe it's
[29:32] later on i would say this but
[29:34] i having not necessarily written it down
[29:38] i want to say it now i'm lift what i'm
[29:41] speaking to
[29:42] are the things that we can clearly
[29:43] identify in the word
[29:46] and it should help you understand why
[29:48] when a woman is not able to have a child
[29:50] why it has such a deep impact why it's
[29:54] not it's not something they can just get
[29:55] over
[29:57] and so i do not want to lift these
[29:59] things up to the detriment of any
[30:01] daughter of god who has experienced
[30:05] not being able to have children and just
[30:06] to let this become
[30:08] fester be discouraging if anything it
[30:10] can give you
[30:11] some some means of attacking the devil
[30:14] because that's why you're letting it
[30:15] bother you so much because that's what i
[30:17] was made for
[30:19] because this is what god's word said
[30:21] about me and this is not
[30:22] it's not a bad thing to desire this it's
[30:24] not a wrong thing to have wanted this
[30:25] it's not it's not wrong to believe that
[30:27] a woman would be made this way and a
[30:28] woman should do this and so
[30:30] i'm very very sensitive to the struggle
[30:32] that many of our sisters have
[30:34] in in not being able to conceive and
[30:36] have children
[30:38] and so i don't want to be in any way
[30:39] dismissive of that but if we could just
[30:41] acknowledge it now and say
[30:43] this is why these things are why it is
[30:45] so hard
[30:47] and it's not just something they kind of
[30:48] say ah no big deal
[30:52] now this is the other thing i want to
[30:53] say before we continue this biblical
[30:55] truth and these things we're talking
[30:56] about
[30:58] at best by the world would be considered
[31:00] outdated like if they were going to be
[31:01] kind of nice to us like oh bless your
[31:03] heart your
[31:04] old fashion and so at best it'd be
[31:07] considered outdated at worst it's cast
[31:09] as demeaning or
[31:10] oppressive that to take
[31:13] the woman and a female and say that
[31:16] a woman is made to be a wife and a woman
[31:19] is made to be
[31:20] a mother and this is how god made her
[31:22] they say this is oppression and this is
[31:24] this is the patriarch patriarchy has
[31:26] invented the institution of marriage to
[31:28] subjugate women
[31:29] and make them subject to men and to rule
[31:31] over us and deprive us of all these
[31:33] other
[31:33] rights and privileges that we ought to
[31:35] have and there's a way that they can
[31:36] paint the picture it's like
[31:38] well that kind of makes sense with the
[31:39] way the men have been acting but it's
[31:41] a denial of how god made the woman
[31:46] i'm not commenting on history and i'm
[31:47] not talking about feudal lords in
[31:50] ancient england and i'm not talking
[31:51] about how pharaohs ruled egypt and how
[31:53] the greeks treated their women
[31:55] i'm not talking about cultures in asia
[31:57] i'm talking about the word of god going
[31:58] back to the beginning i'm talking about
[32:00] truth
[32:00] that there's a language that god uses
[32:02] regarding both genders there's a
[32:04] language that god uses
[32:06] about the woman about the man about how
[32:08] he desires them to live and to act
[32:11] and that is the virtuous way to live and
[32:13] that is the only meaningful way to live
[32:15] and that's the only way you're ever
[32:17] going to find pure joy
[32:18] is by finding your place as a man and
[32:20] finding your place as a woman
[32:21] and staying in your place and fulfilling
[32:23] your purpose in that place
[32:26] but the nowadays they would even they
[32:29] might say well that's kind of an
[32:30] old-fashioned way of viewing that and
[32:31] that's kind of an outdated way but i
[32:33] think
[32:33] it's getting more uh uh
[32:36] just uh visceral and angry
[32:40] and vicious venomous and it would be
[32:43] cast as
[32:44] demeaning to women to say that she's
[32:47] made to be a wife it'd be demeaning to a
[32:48] woman to say
[32:50] that she was made to be a mother this
[32:51] this is oppression this is
[32:53] bondage this is a slavery to the woman
[32:58] and i would like to i want you to think
[33:02] about
[33:02] how there's many things that exist in
[33:05] culture and many things that are taught
[33:07] and espoused and believed and lifted up
[33:10] that can be categorized as an agenda
[33:12] against a woman's purpose
[33:15] and any agenda that tries to confuse
[33:17] tear down muddy up or devalue a woman's
[33:19] purpose as an attack on a woman's joy
[33:23] anything that would get to the heart of
[33:24] the what's meaningful to a woman
[33:26] anything that would get to the heart of
[33:27] why she's made and the way that god made
[33:29] her
[33:29] is an attack on the woman's joy it's a
[33:32] direct
[33:32] assault on what's going to make that
[33:34] woman joyful
[33:36] and it's a direct attack on what's going
[33:37] to allow that woman to live a meaningful
[33:39] life
[33:43] in genesis chapter 3 verse 16
[33:48] under the woman he said this is when the
[33:50] curse is being expressed to the woman i
[33:51] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[33:53] conception
[33:55] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[33:56] children now we should not read this to
[33:59] suggest that
[34:00] prior to the sin she was not going to
[34:02] bring forth children
[34:03] but rather we should read it that
[34:05] there's going to be sorrow
[34:07] conjoined with it that though at one
[34:09] time whatever by whatever means they
[34:11] would have brought forth children adam
[34:12] and the woman by mixing themselves
[34:14] together would have brought forth
[34:15] children
[34:16] now she is it's going to be something
[34:18] that's painful
[34:19] a travail a great labor and a great pain
[34:21] to her she's going to bring
[34:22] it forth in sorrow then he makes the
[34:24] statement and thy desire shall be to thy
[34:26] husband but or and he shall rule
[34:28] over thee now
[34:31] it's interesting the language that's
[34:33] used that you're you're gonna have pain
[34:36] labor pains it's gonna be hard it's
[34:37] gonna be difficult upon the body
[34:39] to give birth to children and and this
[34:42] is a consequence of the original sin
[34:44] and to say your desire is gonna be to
[34:46] your husband telling the woman that she
[34:49] should only have her desires to her
[34:50] husband
[34:51] but then he is going to rule over you
[34:53] it's a very strange phrase
[34:55] but the way that it's used it can have
[34:58] tremendous application in different ways
[35:00] but it identifies something this is to
[35:03] me what's really remarkable as i
[35:05] pondered this
[35:06] here the woman is going to be she has
[35:09] the role she was suited for bringing for
[35:10] children
[35:12] but now after the fall something has
[35:15] been breached
[35:16] and broken within the harmonious
[35:17] relationship between the man and the
[35:18] woman headship has been broken
[35:20] through the act of redemption adam
[35:22] carries or carries her over into a
[35:24] fallen world
[35:25] but now something there's been a
[35:27] fracture
[35:28] within the the arrangement of the man
[35:30] and the woman and because of what she
[35:32] did
[35:33] something's introduced into the human
[35:35] race and god is identifying what's going
[35:37] to happen to the woman
[35:38] and he says you're going to desire to
[35:39] have what your husband has
[35:42] it says your desire shall be to your
[35:43] husband you will desire your husband's
[35:45] position
[35:46] you will desire your husband's role in
[35:48] god's prophecy god is prophesying
[35:51] of the rise of women's rights the rise
[35:53] of equality
[35:54] the rise of doing what uh foregoing her
[35:58] calling to bring for children looking
[36:00] down upon the labor and the pain and the
[36:02] difficulty of doing it saying
[36:03] i ain't want none of that let me be my
[36:06] own woman let me live free of that let
[36:07] me just accomplish and achieve and be
[36:10] and god is actually prophesying when he
[36:12] curses the woman saying
[36:13] you one day are going to desire to have
[36:15] the man's role to step into his office
[36:18] and to be what his is but the man has
[36:20] been called to be the head
[36:24] and it's a the bible is just identifying
[36:27] it in the very beginning
[36:30] and so some of the major goals for the
[36:32] independence of women or some of the
[36:34] major arguments for the equality of
[36:36] women are pushed back against the word
[36:39] and i'm not like
[36:40] all nervous saying that all of a sudden
[36:42] i'm going to come out and somebody's
[36:43] going to attack me
[36:44] they would agree with me those that
[36:47] believe in these things would say you
[36:49] are 100 percent
[36:51] what we are teaching women today and
[36:53] what we want them to understand
[36:55] is 100 percent a aggression and attack
[37:00] against the traditional roles that have
[37:01] been espoused by christianity
[37:04] they will not argue with that so i and i
[37:06] feel that i'm qualified to share this
[37:08] because when in
[37:09] my undergraduate degree i took women's
[37:11] political theory
[37:13] it's called women's political thought i
[37:16] took that class
[37:17] and i had the highest grade in the class
[37:19] i had an a plus and
[37:20] let me tell you there were some women in
[37:22] there that hated me
[37:27] and so i feel like i'm qualified to
[37:28] speak about some of these things
[37:31] but these goals are a push back against
[37:34] the word because i was a bible toten
[37:36] christian sitting in class and the
[37:38] teacher would say well you know in the
[37:39] bible it says this and everyone would go
[37:42] and look back at me like oh no oh no uh
[37:45] oh
[37:46] and we had some fun we had some fun in
[37:49] that class
[37:50] and i made an a she didn't like me the
[37:51] teacher didn't like me but she's very
[37:52] gracious
[37:53] she'd say i completely disagree with you
[37:55] you're very unfair to this feminist
[37:57] i think that you're putting her
[37:58] arguments in the wrong kind of light but
[38:00] well written well argued very good
[38:01] support a plus
[38:05] i don't know why i'm humble bragging
[38:07] about my
[38:08] a plus and women's political theory
[38:11] but got an a
[38:14] did i mention i got an a plus it was the
[38:16] highest grade in the class i
[38:18] i didn't mention that did i
[38:21] so i i have authority to say that
[38:24] even when it was taught to me feminism
[38:26] was taught to me
[38:28] it was espoused verbalized and it was
[38:31] explicit
[38:32] that this is an argument against what
[38:34] you're taught in the bible
[38:36] and some of the common goals of feminism
[38:38] are to define
[38:39] establish and achieve political economic
[38:42] personal
[38:43] and social equality of sexes so this is
[38:46] some of their goals or common goals to
[38:48] define establish and achieve
[38:49] freedom independence political economic
[38:52] personal and social equality of sexes
[38:54] this includes seeking an established
[38:56] educational and professional
[38:57] opportunities for women
[38:59] that are equal to those of men
[39:02] now don't get me wrong and not that i
[39:05] ever said this to my teacher
[39:07] to get an a but okay that seems fair
[39:10] that seems reasonable
[39:12] but there's something missing here
[39:15] that the whole approach that in order to
[39:17] achieve this
[39:18] for a woman to be able to achieve
[39:21] political economic personal and social
[39:23] equality
[39:24] and then to also have you know be able
[39:27] to establish it through educational
[39:28] professional opportunities
[39:29] for women that are equal to those of men
[39:31] if you look at the agenda the common
[39:33] goals and the arguments they take
[39:35] motherhood out of womanhood
[39:39] i mean this is true if you if you ponder
[39:41] it and you realize that one of the
[39:43] greatest barriers
[39:44] to achieving this agenda is the fact
[39:47] that the woman
[39:48] can bring four children because the man
[39:52] doesn't so he can father a child and
[39:54] guess what he can do he can work without
[39:56] stopping
[39:58] it's like nancy we've got a meeting that
[39:59] too just hold on i'm almost done
[40:01] delivering the baby i'll be there at 2
[40:03] 15.
[40:04] it doesn't work that way so in order to
[40:07] achieve this
[40:08] there has to be and my goodness it
[40:10] really opens up to the door to why
[40:12] there isn't there is a imbalance in
[40:14] certain things
[40:15] it's because the women choose on their
[40:18] own
[40:18] many times they desire to be mothers and
[40:21] are willing to be paid less or work less
[40:24] or not ascend up a corporate ladder
[40:26] because they themselves desire or
[40:28] value the role that they would feel as a
[40:31] mother
[40:33] but these arguments about the equality
[40:35] of sexes within
[40:36] a politics or economics and these
[40:38] different things they leave
[40:40] motherhood out of womenhood so the
[40:42] ultimate barrier to this goal is not
[40:45] misogyny
[40:47] the ultimate barrier to achieving this
[40:49] is biology
[40:52] ponder it think about it the biggest
[40:55] hindrance to the
[40:56] uh to women to the feminist agenda
[41:00] is a woman's essential calling that an
[41:02] or if she
[41:03] if every woman if women are ever going
[41:05] to achieve this she needs to stop having
[41:06] babies
[41:09] and in romans chapter 1 verses 26 to 28
[41:16] for this cause gave them up unto god
[41:18] gave them up onto vile affections for
[41:20] even their women did
[41:22] and i realized time is like super
[41:24] getting away from me
[41:25] let me just try to go through this very
[41:27] quickly god as he's running through
[41:29] all these things that have happened to
[41:30] man and how perverted he's become
[41:33] he says even their women did change the
[41:35] natural use
[41:36] into that which is against nature now
[41:39] i'm just wanting you to
[41:41] ponder this without getting into what's
[41:43] being um
[41:44] identified as evil and wrong and how the
[41:46] perversion crept in
[41:48] he's saying that the women uh changed
[41:51] natural use into something against
[41:53] nature likewise also men
[41:54] leaving the natural use of the woman
[41:57] burned in their lust one toward another
[41:59] men with men working that which is
[42:00] unseemly receiving in themselves
[42:02] the recompense of their heir which was
[42:04] meat and even as they did not like to
[42:06] now this is kind of where it all went
[42:08] wrong they did not like to retain god in
[42:10] their knowledge
[42:11] god gave them over to a reprobate mind
[42:14] to do things which are not
[42:15] convenient so convenience speaks of
[42:19] something that is proper
[42:20] right something being accomplished that
[42:21] it's not this does not accomplish what a
[42:24] woman has accomplished
[42:25] uh made for this does not accomplish
[42:27] what a man this is for and those things
[42:29] so they comment they enter into
[42:30] reprobate mind to do things that are not
[42:32] fulfilling that are not convenient do
[42:34] not accomplish the right things
[42:35] and it's all built upon this this
[42:37] failure to
[42:39] fulfill the natural use
[42:45] what is looking at what would be this
[42:47] natural use what was she naturally
[42:48] called to do now without getting into
[42:50] some of the arguments that are made
[42:51] about these scriptures
[42:53] a woman was made to mother a woman was
[42:55] made to bring forth children
[42:57] but in this very this picture saying man
[42:59] has kind of abandoned that and left that
[43:00] aside
[43:01] and he's given up the natural use of a
[43:03] woman and she's changed
[43:04] the natural use into that which is
[43:05] against nature and the woman what she's
[43:08] called to do
[43:09] is not regarded at all
[43:12] this is going to be something this is
[43:13] something to chew on
[43:16] and i i'm running out of time to really
[43:18] expound upon it so this is maybe one of
[43:19] those times when it's maybe a little fun
[43:21] to say something everybody's like what
[43:23] and they just have to think about it but
[43:25] the comment there's a common ground
[43:27] that's shared between those who degrade
[43:29] women and those that want to liberate
[43:30] women
[43:32] there's a common ground they have a
[43:33] commonality which they maybe don't look
[43:36] at very
[43:37] um maybe immediately but those that
[43:39] would degrade
[43:40] women and sexualize them and objectify
[43:42] them and those that want to liberate
[43:43] women
[43:44] they both have this common ground and
[43:46] this they disregard the disregard and
[43:47] respect for a woman's calling
[43:51] both of them are are locked arms
[43:54] together and
[43:55] operating by the same principle that
[43:56] they do not respect
[43:58] and value what a woman is for they say
[44:01] what a woman is for like she just has
[44:02] some use no god has created her for
[44:04] glory
[44:05] created her for something great and a
[44:06] man will just use her and objectify her
[44:09] and degrade her and devalue her
[44:10] and then on the other side well we would
[44:12] value women we want to liberate them and
[44:14] what they want to liberate her from is
[44:15] her ovaries
[44:17] and they want to liberate a woman from
[44:19] her calling and to be a wife and to be a
[44:21] mother and that's where they have their
[44:22] common ground
[44:24] but if we just leave aside a person's
[44:26] right over their body
[44:27] because i think sometimes we have to be
[44:28] very careful how adamant we get about
[44:31] certain things and something could be
[44:32] wrong but you have to be very careful
[44:34] that you're not acknowledging that you
[44:35] know what when it comes to law and it
[44:37] comes to reason and it comes to choice
[44:39] you have that choice so we're not going
[44:41] to get into the arguments about a
[44:42] person's right or their body or choice
[44:44] because we are made what
[44:45] free moral agents without getting into
[44:48] that consider what
[44:49] what i've just said what am i
[44:50] identifying what a woman's virtue is
[44:53] so it's not an argument about her choice
[44:55] it's not an argument about your choice
[44:57] it's not an argument about
[44:58] uh birth control rights and a right over
[45:00] a woman's body
[45:01] it's a it's an it's an argument that's
[45:04] revolving around what is a woman made
[45:06] for
[45:07] and the shifting attitude towards
[45:08] motherhood and the change in the
[45:10] attitude towards womanhood
[45:11] is a product of a lost connection with
[45:13] christ
[45:15] these attitudes that have changed have
[45:16] changed because we're no longer viewing
[45:18] one another through what god would want
[45:20] us to be we're no longer viewing
[45:22] marriages and families and churches
[45:24] we're no longer viewing them through
[45:25] what
[45:25] the word said they should be but they
[45:27] become something totally different
[45:29] that's defined socially
[45:30] that's defined subjectively by
[45:33] individuals and we kind of want
[45:34] everyone to have this autonomous
[45:36] definition of who they are and the
[45:37] reason why we have such polarizing
[45:39] differences
[45:40] is because we have lost our connection
[45:42] with the word which would give us common
[45:44] ground
[45:45] to both respect and value and liberate
[45:48] women the proper way
[45:51] and really i'd say this there's no
[45:53] there's no promise of joy in the world
[45:55] view
[45:57] only the pursuit of pleasure and in
[45:59] pursuing pleasure
[46:00] the outcome of disappointment
[46:04] because god made a woman a certain way
[46:06] and you may liberate her by somehow
[46:09] breaking the shackles of the patriarchy
[46:11] by somehow overthrowing misogyny by
[46:14] somehow putting every chauvinist six
[46:16] feet under
[46:16] and somehow you've liberated the woman
[46:19] and you've made her free and she no
[46:20] longer has to worry about man
[46:22] and every man has been subjugated and
[46:24] conquered and cast into prison
[46:26] and the woman is finally free and shall
[46:29] find that though there may be pleasure
[46:30] they'll never be fulfillment
[46:34] again i'm speaking in general about the
[46:36] woman
[46:39] and if we look at the time that we're
[46:40] living in now
[46:43] laodicea tries to smother out the glory
[46:45] of a woman's purpose
[46:47] tries to smother out the glory of a
[46:49] woman's true calling
[46:50] the word laodicea in the greek means
[46:52] justice of the people
[46:54] the city was named historically after
[46:56] laodicea shrewd and powerful woman who
[46:59] divorced her husband
[47:00] and accumulated much wealth through that
[47:02] divorce
[47:04] and it's in this age that's named after
[47:07] this woman
[47:08] this powerful woman it's an age that has
[47:10] become a woman's age
[47:12] the image of the woman has changed
[47:15] and since the image of a woman has
[47:17] changed the ambition of women has
[47:19] changed
[47:20] why because they pursue the image i
[47:23] think about this
[47:24] i'm not i'm not just trying to diagnose
[47:26] like someone we can leave today and you
[47:27] go to in and out this evening like
[47:28] look at that laodicean look at that
[47:30] laodicean i'm wanting you to ponder the
[47:33] impact it has on your
[47:34] mind your thinking and on your heart how
[47:37] there's an
[47:38] image out there of the woman and what
[47:40] she's doing and what she's accomplishing
[47:41] and what she's able to do and what she's
[47:42] able to achieve
[47:44] and this image of a woman and we're
[47:46] presented with multiple images so you
[47:47] can almost choose your flavor well i
[47:49] want to be like
[47:49] this instagram woman i want to follow
[47:51] this woman on youtube
[47:52] and whatever image it might be there's
[47:54] an image of the woman that's being
[47:55] presented to you
[47:57] and since this image is presented it
[47:58] influences your pursuit
[48:01] it influences your desire
[48:04] and let's just be honest the woman's
[48:06] role is not being defined now by a godly
[48:07] society
[48:10] it is not being influenced by biblical
[48:13] teachings
[48:14] in the world you're not going to find
[48:16] the model of a biblical woman
[48:18] being presented to you that this is what
[48:19] you should follow this is how you should
[48:20] live
[48:21] the world is not lifting those things up
[48:22] the world is not allowing an avenue for
[48:25] those things to be
[48:26] supported that's not the image you're
[48:28] going to be beholding
[48:30] but a biblical woman a woman who would
[48:32] desire and even say well i just want to
[48:34] be
[48:34] a housewife i just want to be a
[48:36] stay-at-home mom and these phrases that
[48:38] are used i mean
[48:39] you would have these women that just
[48:40] clutched their pearls like
[48:42] you would what you just want to be a
[48:49] i can't even say it you just want to get
[48:52] married
[48:54] and that's how they feel and and what is
[48:56] amazing is that
[48:57] a woman who gets married and has
[48:59] children is now telling her daughter
[49:01] why would you get married
[49:06] some kind of logical disconnect there
[49:12] but a woman who would desire that is
[49:13] made to feel less honored a woman that
[49:16] would desire is made to feel less valued
[49:18] she she feels has less fulfillment in
[49:22] home and in marriage because the result
[49:24] of the image that's being presented
[49:27] now i'm speaking this to our sisters now
[49:29] and even to us brothers and all of us as
[49:31] the family of god to consider this
[49:34] that there's enough of an image that's
[49:35] being presented in the world
[49:38] to make a woman feel less valued and
[49:40] less fulfilled in her role in the home
[49:43] outside of the difficulties that may
[49:44] take place in the home
[49:46] there's a pressure and attack that tells
[49:48] her she hasn't accomplished as much
[49:50] she's not as valued as much she's not as
[49:51] special as she could be
[49:54] if she was doing more than just married
[49:55] and raising her kids
[49:58] and so with that there's a sense of
[50:00] shame or even maybe this idea of broken
[50:02] dreams and expectations unfulfilled and
[50:05] man i was really good at this and i was
[50:07] great at that and
[50:08] if i hadn't gotten married and had kids
[50:09] and i would have had this business and
[50:11] i'd be making a lot of money and i would
[50:12] have franchised this
[50:14] and there's a lot of ways come on
[50:15] sisters get behind me now there's a lot
[50:17] of ways we have gifts and talents and
[50:19] abilities and blessings and
[50:20] opportunities i had a full ride
[50:22] scholarship for this i had an
[50:23] opportunity to do that
[50:24] and then you find yourself the lord
[50:26] maybe a circumstance maybe god
[50:28] you know intervenes in your life and you
[50:30] think it was a tragedy but it was god
[50:32] saying wait a minute stop her before she
[50:33] does that
[50:34] something changes you find yourself
[50:36] today you're married and you have
[50:37] children you're a stay-at-home mom
[50:38] you're homeschooling
[50:40] and your life is full of laundry and
[50:43] and matthew c and all sorts of
[50:45] curriculums you're trying to figure out
[50:46] and all these things are
[50:48] taking place right this is your life and
[50:49] there's a voice that says you know if
[50:51] you
[50:51] just stuck it out with that education
[50:55] and then there's a way that it gets
[50:56] married with this idea well if you would
[50:57] have done that you would have been able
[50:58] to afford private school
[51:01] and so you would and you could just work
[51:02] from home you could you could just put
[51:04] an office on the back of this as a
[51:05] matter of fact you would have been
[51:05] making so much money you would have
[51:06] built a better house than what your
[51:07] husband built
[51:09] like man you're right i could have had a
[51:10] better house could have had an office i
[51:12] could have done all my stuff over here
[51:14] could have
[51:14] paid a tutor to come to my children
[51:16] could have put them in private school
[51:17] and so it's like you're not wrestling
[51:18] with it in the sense that wow
[51:20] oh i would be a single woman living it
[51:23] up as the ceo of apple right now had i
[51:25] not gotten married
[51:26] there's a way that you're just made to
[51:27] feel that something's missing
[51:30] just because you're a wife and a mother
[51:36] now in psalms 113 verse 9
[51:40] i was going to read the entire psalm not
[51:42] the book of psalm the entire psalm 113
[51:46] as my text because it just lifts up a
[51:48] lot of beautiful things in the beginning
[51:50] and i felt for time i wanted to focus on
[51:51] john 16.
[51:53] but notice how it says this in verse 9
[51:55] he maketh the barren
[51:56] woman to keep house
[52:00] and even the language that's used in the
[52:01] hebrew he make it the woman to fill the
[52:02] house up with children
[52:04] this is what makes her a keeper at home
[52:05] as the children that have birthed them
[52:06] to the home
[52:07] and this is the prophecy this is a
[52:08] promise to a woman he makes a woman who
[52:10] is unable to have children to become
[52:12] a woman who keeps house to has children
[52:15] and to be a
[52:16] joyful mother of children praise
[52:19] ye the lord so this is a cause for
[52:23] praise
[52:25] this is the cause for exaltation and i
[52:27] want you to catch this because it's
[52:28] important to understand that this
[52:30] is not being said
[52:33] only to the woman who was barren so it's
[52:35] not only that the baron would have
[52:37] children
[52:38] but it points to what makes a woman
[52:40] joyful
[52:41] that when a barren woman is able to have
[52:44] children she becomes
[52:46] a joyful mother as other women have
[52:48] become
[52:50] and this is how the bible describes
[52:52] motherhood
[52:53] it doesn't say and she becomes this
[52:56] chore this bondage this burden of a
[52:59] mother
[53:00] well he gave the barren woman what she
[53:02] asked for handcuffed her for 18 years
[53:04] chained a ball and chained to her ankle
[53:06] and she had to drag around these kids
[53:08] for 18 years
[53:09] before her and her husband finally go on
[53:11] that vacation to europe once they get
[53:12] the kids out of the house
[53:14] no it says that she may be a joyful
[53:16] mother of children
[53:17] though it's becoming a mother is a joy
[53:19] it's not a chore it's not a bondage it's
[53:21] not restriction
[53:22] it's not a cause for lamentation it was
[53:25] a cause of praise and exaltation
[53:27] not only that a woman who could not
[53:29] conceive would conceive
[53:30] but when any woman does
[53:34] that in its purest way having children
[53:36] is a joy
[53:37] and causes her to be a joyful mother of
[53:39] children
[53:41] the by this scripture is saying that god
[53:42] created the woman to cause the house to
[53:44] be full as leah and rachel
[53:46] built up israel and brought forth
[53:48] children it's referring how the woman is
[53:49] used to build up the family
[53:51] and to cause a house to be full he
[53:52] causes the woman to keep house
[53:54] this is god's purpose god made the woman
[53:58] to be
[53:58] not just a mom or to mother but rather
[54:00] to be a
[54:01] joyful mother of her children what is a
[54:04] joyful mother is a mother who's pursuing
[54:06] purpose
[54:07] it is a mother who's finding meaning and
[54:09] doing what she is called to do
[54:11] it she's a joyful mother because she
[54:13] realized that being a mother is part of
[54:14] god's plan
[54:15] she's a joyful mother because she
[54:17] realizes there's meaning in being a mom
[54:19] and what other greater joy could she
[54:20] have what other greater calling could
[54:22] she have
[54:22] not because she missed out on this
[54:24] opportunity not because she could do
[54:26] this and do that if we had more money
[54:27] then we could do this and we could do
[54:28] that no
[54:29] it's an idea that no matter how hard and
[54:31] difficult the circumstance is
[54:33] this is a calling of god to be a mother
[54:39] just in being the mom she's to be joyful
[54:44] the joyful mom is the one that finds
[54:46] that there's meaning in this there's
[54:47] purpose in this
[54:49] and this is what makes john chapter 16
[54:51] stand out to me so much more
[54:53] verses 20 and 21
[54:56] verily verily i say unto you that you
[54:58] shall weep and lament but the world
[54:59] shall rejoice and you shall be sorrowful
[55:02] but your sorrow shall be turned into joy
[55:05] so jesus wanting the disciples to
[55:07] understand that as his
[55:08] as he is going to be crucified soon
[55:13] and he is and they're going to be very
[55:16] sad as a result of that
[55:18] he's wanting them to know that this
[55:20] great sorrow and this
[55:22] dread that they feel can be changed into
[55:25] joy
[55:26] and catch this as we continue to read
[55:28] jesus is using childbirth as a type
[55:31] to understand their impending sorrow
[55:34] but the imminent joy their sorrow but
[55:37] ultimately there's joy
[55:39] and and so this is what he's wanting to
[55:41] use your sorrow should be turned to joy
[55:43] and then he uses this example
[55:44] a woman when she is in travail have
[55:46] sorrow she's giving birth she has pains
[55:48] and it's
[55:49] it's hard because her hours come but as
[55:51] soon as she's delivered of the child
[55:53] she remembers no more the anguish
[55:57] this is in the days before epidurals and
[55:59] c-sections
[56:00] right she doesn't remember the pain she
[56:02] remembered no more the anguish
[56:05] for joy that a child that a man it
[56:07] doesn't speak just of a man
[56:08] for the joy that a man is born into the
[56:11] world
[56:13] think about that i know there's sisters
[56:14] here that can relate to this that how
[56:16] horrible and hard
[56:17] a pregnancy can be and a labor can be
[56:20] that then when that child as soon as
[56:22] that child is born it's almost as if
[56:24] those nine months ago gone
[56:28] and it's so remarkable that you find
[56:30] that a woman who just
[56:32] almost lost her life in delivery had the
[56:34] worst nine months of her life is like oh
[56:36] i want to have another one like do you
[56:40] remember what those months were like i
[56:42] still haven't lost the weight you want
[56:44] another one why
[56:45] for the joy that a child was born
[56:49] it's a joy that eclipses the pain it's a
[56:52] joy that eclipses the suffering it's a
[56:54] joy that eclipses
[56:55] all those things and this is in the
[56:57] beauty of marriage and this is
[56:58] connected with the beauty of a woman
[57:00] fulfilling her purpose this is the way
[57:02] that it ought to be this is the joy of
[57:03] childbirth this is the joy
[57:05] of having children in the in a marriage
[57:07] which is sanctified before the lord
[57:09] she remembered no more the anguish for
[57:11] joy that a man has brought in the world
[57:13] the pain the anguish and the suffering
[57:14] of labor
[57:15] is immediately overshadowed of the joy
[57:17] of the delivery
[57:21] now the bible says that she praise god
[57:23] that a mother become a woman becomes a
[57:26] joyful mother and jesus is using
[57:29] this travail and sorrow that then
[57:32] becomes eclipsed because the woman is
[57:34] still the body's still in trauma
[57:38] the body has still suffered there's
[57:39] still a recovery for this woman there's
[57:41] still changes that are going to take
[57:42] place
[57:42] there's still something that this woman
[57:44] physically is going to overcome there's
[57:46] still a suffering and a consequence from
[57:47] what has happened to the body but the
[57:49] fact that the child is here
[57:51] exceeds all that so the pain the
[57:54] delivery the pregnancy it's not keep
[57:56] getting brought up keeps getting brought
[57:57] up you're looking at this baby and say
[57:59] yeah you're cute but my goodness those
[58:00] nine months i don't know i don't know if
[58:02] it was worth it
[58:03] no it was all worth it once you're
[58:05] holding that baby it's all worth it you
[58:06] even take mothers who have children born
[58:08] prematurely and they have to be in
[58:10] nicu for months and months and months
[58:12] and they can only visit and see them
[58:13] through a glass and after
[58:14] seven or so months they finally get that
[58:16] baby and they're bringing that little
[58:17] baby home
[58:18] yes it was it worth it they'd say oh
[58:20] it's worth it
[58:22] worth every second worth every dollar
[58:24] worth every effort oh no
[58:26] it was worth it why because this is the
[58:28] principle that god put within the woman
[58:30] a power that he put within the woman
[58:32] and jesus is actually using that
[58:34] probably because what else could he use
[58:38] right to describe what it was going to
[58:41] be like for the disciples to see christ
[58:44] die but the joy that they would feel
[58:47] upon his resurrection the revelation of
[58:49] it like how else can we describe it
[58:51] except childbirth
[58:53] how else can i describe to you and and
[58:55] what's funny is he's telling this to men
[58:57] and then like
[58:57] hmm
[59:01] yeah i mean she did scream a lot
[59:04] if that's got to be hard yeah that's got
[59:05] to be hard and the women are there going
[59:07] are you serious this is what it's going
[59:08] to be like
[59:10] this is awesome he says she remembers
[59:12] nowhere the anguish christ has to use
[59:15] this example of the joy that a mother
[59:17] experiences
[59:18] to help the disciples begin to
[59:19] understand the joy they'll fear feel
[59:21] after the sorrow of his crucifixion
[59:23] but the revelation of his resurrection
[59:26] and
[59:27] this is the point where i really want to
[59:28] drive home to our mothers happy mother's
[59:29] day
[59:31] this is not a fleeting joy
[59:34] but it becomes an occasion for a woman
[59:36] to occupy herself in god's purpose
[59:40] it's not just a joy that oh a baby is
[59:42] born it's a newborn this is great i had
[59:44] a baby but
[59:45] now the woman steps into an office
[59:48] and she's given an opportunity to occupy
[59:51] herself
[59:51] from that moment that the baby takes
[59:53] that breath she knows that now for the
[59:55] rest of her life she can occupy herself
[59:58] in god's purpose because listen when we
[1:00:00] begin to speak about family
[1:00:02] behind this pulpit and to you as a
[1:00:04] church and some of you who have
[1:00:05] grandchildren
[1:00:06] and you're enjoying great grandchildren
[1:00:07] it's easy to say oh well brother aaron's
[1:00:09] preaching about
[1:00:10] you know raising children hey you
[1:00:12] haven't left being a parent
[1:00:15] there's still a role that you play
[1:00:17] there's still an influence you have
[1:00:18] there's still things that we can learn
[1:00:20] and benefit from
[1:00:20] and even some tremendous paths upon the
[1:00:22] back saying attaboy you did a good job
[1:00:24] when we tune into the things that are
[1:00:26] taught in the word of god concerning
[1:00:27] parenthood
[1:00:28] but this is not just something where she
[1:00:30] has oh that was great that was wonderful
[1:00:32] i'm happy
[1:00:33] and then begins to enter into this
[1:00:34] despondency this chore of raising
[1:00:36] children to maturity
[1:00:38] but now she's entered into an office
[1:00:40] motherhood
[1:00:41] as in in the office of a mother she has
[1:00:43] been given an opportunity
[1:00:45] every day even once the children are
[1:00:47] married and gone
[1:00:48] every day she can enter into that office
[1:00:50] and occupy herself
[1:00:52] as a prayerful mother for the sake of
[1:00:54] her children
[1:00:56] job offered sacrifices for his children
[1:00:58] that weren't at home
[1:01:02] and it's not just a fleeting joy because
[1:01:03] verse 22 says and ye now therefore have
[1:01:05] sorrow
[1:01:06] as a woman does when she's in labor but
[1:01:09] i will see you again
[1:01:10] upon the resurrection and your heart
[1:01:12] shall rejoice so a woman who's in
[1:01:14] travail
[1:01:15] is like how you're going to feel once
[1:01:17] i'm crucified but when you catch the
[1:01:19] revelation and see me in the
[1:01:20] resurrection
[1:01:21] you're going to be happy like a woman
[1:01:22] when she has a baby and then he says
[1:01:25] and your joy no man taketh from you
[1:01:28] and lord this is a an abiding joy this
[1:01:31] is more than a moment this is more than
[1:01:33] emotion
[1:01:33] and i want to catch this this was what
[1:01:35] there was a real force behind my
[1:01:36] inspiration
[1:01:37] is to make this point that the world
[1:01:39] tries to steal that joy from a woman
[1:01:42] because but with god has made you a
[1:01:44] mother i don't care how dark it is how
[1:01:46] hard it is what it looks like
[1:01:48] god has promised a joy that should not
[1:01:50] be stolen to
[1:01:52] mothers your joy no man taketh from you
[1:01:56] in other words jesus is saying just as a
[1:01:58] mother's joy should never be stolen
[1:02:00] your joy will never be taken away just
[1:02:02] as sir as a woman as soon as she becomes
[1:02:05] a mother
[1:02:05] she enters into relationships she's
[1:02:07] never known before she enters into
[1:02:08] emotions and feelings she's never known
[1:02:10] before
[1:02:10] she enters into a joy she becomes a
[1:02:12] joyful mother
[1:02:14] and that joy cannot be taken from her
[1:02:17] he's using that so a christian can
[1:02:19] understand what the resurrection is like
[1:02:21] and let me say this to our mothers don't
[1:02:23] let anybody steal your joy
[1:02:26] do not let the joy of motherhood be
[1:02:28] taken away from you by the perverting of
[1:02:30] the picture of what a woman should be
[1:02:32] do not let the joy of motherhood be
[1:02:33] taken away from you by the fear of
[1:02:35] missing out
[1:02:36] do not let the joy of motherhood be
[1:02:37] taken away from you by comparison
[1:02:41] and you look out and you see this you
[1:02:42] see that in the world is trying to steal
[1:02:44] the joy
[1:02:45] of motherhood away from a woman and the
[1:02:47] bible says in proverbs 31 30
[1:02:50] which lifts up this virtuous woman and
[1:02:52] her price is far above ruby's and how
[1:02:54] has she described a woman who has busied
[1:02:56] herself with their family
[1:02:58] a woman who's busied herself with her
[1:02:59] children a woman who's busy herself with
[1:03:01] her husband
[1:03:01] and it says this favor is deceitful and
[1:03:03] beauty is vain
[1:03:06] what does that speak to the elements
[1:03:07] that try to rob a woman for over
[1:03:09] happiness
[1:03:11] beauty is deceitful or vain and favors
[1:03:13] deceitful favor
[1:03:14] applause accomplishments popularity it's
[1:03:17] deceitful beauty of same but a woman
[1:03:19] that feareth the lord
[1:03:20] she shall be praised
[1:03:23] the bible says who can value a virtuous
[1:03:25] woman a virtuous woman is a woman who
[1:03:27] pursues
[1:03:28] virtuous things and because she's
[1:03:31] pursuing virtuous things because she's
[1:03:32] pursuing the right things
[1:03:34] the outcome is joy she doesn't pursue
[1:03:37] joy if she pursue joy
[1:03:38] then the deceitful favor is what she
[1:03:41] would try to have
[1:03:42] if she's pursuing joy then the vanity of
[1:03:44] beauty is what she would try to have
[1:03:46] come on think about it this is exactly
[1:03:48] what the scripture we could use the
[1:03:49] scripture to make the point
[1:03:51] that if all you wanted was to be happy
[1:03:53] then try to find favor
[1:03:54] if all you want to do be is happy then
[1:03:56] try to become more view beautiful
[1:03:58] but there's vanity and deceit in those
[1:04:00] things but in pursuing virtue and
[1:04:02] purpose there's joy that comes with it
[1:04:06] favor and beauty try to lure a woman
[1:04:09] into selfishness
[1:04:12] where it's about her and about her
[1:04:14] rights and what she can do and how she
[1:04:16] looks and what she can accomplish and
[1:04:18] i've never been able to do this and i've
[1:04:19] never been able to do that and i've
[1:04:20] never been able to do this
[1:04:21] and her desire shall be to her husband
[1:04:23] you get to go on this and you get to go
[1:04:25] do that and you've been able to do this
[1:04:26] her desire shall be to her husband
[1:04:28] she begins to want to do and accomplish
[1:04:30] and feel a sense of accomplishment that
[1:04:32] that the man has
[1:04:35] when in reality the man could look at
[1:04:37] you and say
[1:04:39] just is whatever you can say about me i
[1:04:41] could say about you
[1:04:44] don't ever compare your job to her job
[1:04:47] you don't want it right he said well i
[1:04:51] have to leave every day and i'll work 12
[1:04:52] hours and i'm doing this time to do that
[1:04:53] all you do is stay at home you don't
[1:04:55] want it
[1:04:56] you don't want it
[1:05:01] and sisters you don't want it either
[1:05:05] the 12 hour shift you don't want him
[1:05:09] you're not called to him but this
[1:05:12] deceit lures a woman into selfishness
[1:05:16] to want to achieve something for her her
[1:05:19] happiness and
[1:05:21] and her pleasure but if you read
[1:05:24] proverbs 31 a virtuous woman is defined
[1:05:26] by her service to others
[1:05:32] do you mind if i go a little bit longer
[1:05:34] do you mind
[1:05:36] okay i was i was wanting to catch just
[1:05:38] somebody's eye who's saying go ahead
[1:05:39] and that's i was only asking sister
[1:05:41] hannah and she said continue so
[1:05:43] apologize i was looking at my kids and
[1:05:46] my family hoping they'd give me a thumbs
[1:05:48] up but
[1:05:50] is that yes or no you don't want me to
[1:05:52] continue okay
[1:05:55] okay yes okay no what i already got my
[1:05:57] goal
[1:05:58] there's a book entitled don't write it
[1:06:00] down just forget it as soon as i say it
[1:06:02] the feminine mystique i think is the
[1:06:03] name of it
[1:06:05] there was a book written i think it was
[1:06:06] in 1963
[1:06:08] and it was done and i think the study
[1:06:10] was largely based upon this woman
[1:06:12] surveying her high school uh friends
[1:06:16] they graduated in the 15th anniversary i
[1:06:18] think it was graduation in 1949 so i
[1:06:20] think that's very
[1:06:21] interesting dates so these women have
[1:06:23] graduated from high school in 1949
[1:06:26] she had surveyed all these women now in
[1:06:28] the late 50s
[1:06:29] and as a result of this survey she wrote
[1:06:31] a book challenging the belief that a
[1:06:33] woman's fulfillment could only come as a
[1:06:35] housewife and a mother
[1:06:36] so the whole point was this feminine
[1:06:38] mystique is challenging this notion
[1:06:40] that a woman can that a woman is connect
[1:06:44] her fulfillment does not come alone from
[1:06:46] being a housewife and a mother
[1:06:48] and this let me just read this to you
[1:06:51] sister hannah let me read this to you
[1:06:53] the problem laid buried unspoken for
[1:06:56] many years in the minds of american
[1:06:58] women
[1:06:59] it was a strange stirring a sense of
[1:07:02] dissatisfaction
[1:07:03] a yearning that women suffered in the
[1:07:05] middle of the 20th century in the united
[1:07:07] states
[1:07:08] each suburban wife struggled with it
[1:07:10] alone
[1:07:11] as she made the bed shop for groceries
[1:07:14] matched slipcover material
[1:07:15] ate peanut butter sandwiches with her
[1:07:17] children chauffeured cub scouts and
[1:07:19] brownies
[1:07:20] lay beside her husband at night she was
[1:07:22] afraid to ask
[1:07:23] even of herself the silent question
[1:07:26] is this all
[1:07:31] think about it it's framing the woman's
[1:07:34] existence in her life that
[1:07:36] this is the unsettledness this is the
[1:07:38] dissatisfaction this is what
[1:07:40] really this yearning deep within the
[1:07:42] women who are suffering
[1:07:43] in america is that they lay next to
[1:07:45] their husbands after living all day for
[1:07:47] their children
[1:07:48] and they want to ask the question but
[1:07:50] they're afraid to even ask their
[1:07:51] question of themselves
[1:07:52] is this life is this all is this what i
[1:07:56] was made to be
[1:07:58] is this all i'm gonna accomplish and it
[1:08:00] says
[1:08:01] we can no longer ignore this is what she
[1:08:04] writes we can no longer ignore that
[1:08:05] voice within women that says
[1:08:08] i want something more than my husband
[1:08:10] and my
[1:08:11] children in my home
[1:08:14] we can no longer ignore this is right at
[1:08:16] the time the seals are being opened this
[1:08:18] book is published
[1:08:19] we can no longer ignore the voice that
[1:08:22] says
[1:08:22] within women i want something more i
[1:08:25] want something more than a husband i
[1:08:26] want something more than children
[1:08:28] i want some more than a home we should
[1:08:31] be the pearl clutchers now
[1:08:33] what you would want something more than
[1:08:36] that
[1:08:39] and think about the condition this world
[1:08:41] is in now 60 years later to where now
[1:08:44] we that sounds reasonable that sounds
[1:08:46] plausible and if someone was to suggest
[1:08:47] well what more could you have as a woman
[1:08:49] than to be a wife and a mother and say
[1:08:51] well that's just oppression that's
[1:08:53] oppressive that's
[1:08:54] that's demeaning that that takes away
[1:08:56] the value of a woman
[1:08:58] and let me say this their argument
[1:09:02] is valid because something had become
[1:09:05] broken
[1:09:07] a value system had been broken the
[1:09:10] family in the home had lost its place it
[1:09:12] lost its purpose
[1:09:14] and how can a woman who's called to be a
[1:09:16] virtuous wife who's called to be a
[1:09:18] joyful mother of her family
[1:09:19] how could she experience that when the
[1:09:22] man and the family itself is no longer
[1:09:24] being centered around god's word
[1:09:26] she is experiencing now how it feels to
[1:09:28] be displaced
[1:09:29] and instead of her saying why do i feel
[1:09:31] so dissatisfied
[1:09:33] in examining what god's purpose would be
[1:09:35] for the woman
[1:09:36] she realizes how man is flowed into this
[1:09:38] abyss
[1:09:39] of of misogyny and power
[1:09:43] in greed and capitalism and she has a
[1:09:45] sense of missing
[1:09:46] out because she doesn't fit in with in
[1:09:48] that vision anymore
[1:09:51] my goodness i'm biting off a mouthful
[1:09:55] and she says we need a drastic reshaping
[1:10:00] of the cultural image of femininity
[1:10:03] that will permit women to reach maturity
[1:10:05] identity completeness of self
[1:10:07] without conflict with sexual fulfillment
[1:10:09] and i'm going to say
[1:10:11] amen because what had happened to the
[1:10:14] cultural image of the woman by that time
[1:10:17] it had already been broken it's not like
[1:10:21] it's little house on the prairie and now
[1:10:22] a woman's wanting to go to college
[1:10:24] no this had left that it had been torn
[1:10:27] down it had been torn down to the point
[1:10:28] where now
[1:10:29] the woman is experiencing this sense of
[1:10:31] this all this doesn't satisfy
[1:10:33] why because she wasn't just made to be
[1:10:34] at home and be a woman who's making
[1:10:36] peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
[1:10:37] she was made to be a co-laborer with the
[1:10:40] man to fill purpose to fill meaning to
[1:10:42] fulfillment
[1:10:42] you take christ out of it she's not
[1:10:45] going to have it
[1:10:49] the shift cause of this the shift away
[1:10:51] from godly principles
[1:10:52] the shift away of a man being the man
[1:10:54] that he ought to be the shift away from
[1:10:55] church being what it ought to be
[1:10:57] the change from the family the bible
[1:11:00] being in the family and christ being in
[1:11:01] the home
[1:11:02] the shift away from that the
[1:11:04] unsettledness went through the entire
[1:11:05] family
[1:11:06] where the husband had to be off doing
[1:11:07] this and off in that club and off doing
[1:11:09] that and the children had to go get
[1:11:11] their hot rods and be in this and being
[1:11:12] that
[1:11:13] and the woman was left where's my part
[1:11:14] where's my joy where's my pleasure why
[1:11:16] did that happen
[1:11:17] because christ left the home
[1:11:22] can we invert
[1:11:25] can we invert always invert
[1:11:28] if that attitude existed because christ
[1:11:31] left the home christ is in your home
[1:11:35] he's not gone so then the lack of joy
[1:11:38] the lack of enthusiasm the lack of
[1:11:40] fulfillment
[1:11:41] is within your grasp you just have to
[1:11:43] take your eyes
[1:11:44] off of the worldly principle that
[1:11:45] somehow suggests to you
[1:11:47] that you're living far below your
[1:11:48] potential or your privileges and say no
[1:11:51] that once i
[1:11:52] have the word as the my centerpiece once
[1:11:55] i've come to this
[1:11:56] i know that as a wife and a mother no
[1:11:58] matter how hard those offices may be
[1:12:00] and regardless if i'm successful in them
[1:12:03] i
[1:12:04] am doing what i'm called to do
[1:12:08] it's your purpose
[1:12:11] but this selfish kind of love
[1:12:18] the bible says in second timothy chapter
[1:12:20] 3 that in the last days perilous times
[1:12:22] will come it says
[1:12:23] men will be lovers of their own selves
[1:12:27] what happens when a woman is laying
[1:12:28] there in bed
[1:12:31] and says this is all or is this all
[1:12:36] and women are saying there must be a
[1:12:37] change in the cultural image
[1:12:39] of femininity that'll permit a woman to
[1:12:41] be live a fulfilling life
[1:12:44] i want something more than my husband my
[1:12:45] children my home why is she feeling that
[1:12:47] way
[1:12:48] because men become lovers of the own
[1:12:50] selves
[1:12:53] and whether you want to say she caused
[1:12:54] it or she's the product of it she's
[1:12:56] laying there
[1:12:57] questioning what she's doing because she
[1:13:00] loves herself
[1:13:02] she's laying there questioning what
[1:13:03] she's doing because she hasn't been
[1:13:05] loved
[1:13:06] herself
[1:13:10] the selfishness and greed
[1:13:14] feeds the weaknesses of humanity and it
[1:13:18] broke marriage
[1:13:19] and it broke parenthood amen
[1:13:22] it's exactly what happened why
[1:13:25] because joy is connected with purpose
[1:13:30] but that purpose cannot be rooted in
[1:13:33] self-gratification
[1:13:34] that purpose cannot be rooted in success
[1:13:38] of on your own terms that i'm pursuing
[1:13:40] success and i'm pursuing happiness
[1:13:42] joy is connected with purpose but that
[1:13:43] purpose is not rooted in self
[1:13:45] uh satisfaction or self success
[1:13:50] happiness gained through selfish
[1:13:51] pleasure cannot produce joy
[1:13:55] happiness gained through selfish
[1:13:56] activity happiness gained through things
[1:13:58] that are only meant for you will not
[1:14:00] produce the fulfillment and enjoy
[1:14:01] now i'm not saying that if somehow
[1:14:04] everyone else can't benefit by it you
[1:14:05] shouldn't do it but you should be aware
[1:14:08] that when your recreation brings you
[1:14:10] happiness and your recreation
[1:14:11] relaxes you and your hobbies and the
[1:14:13] things that you get to do
[1:14:15] bring you great satisfaction realize
[1:14:17] that those accomplishments will not
[1:14:19] bring joy or fulfillment
[1:14:24] because it's not connected with purpose
[1:14:27] i i know i've been long it's 5
[1:14:29] 50 and and i've been an hour and 20
[1:14:34] minutes already and i realized that and
[1:14:35] if i'm
[1:14:36] doing myself a disservice by telling you
[1:14:37] how long you've been sitting here i
[1:14:39] apologize
[1:14:40] to myself but i have to finish this
[1:14:43] because it's just a few more just a few
[1:14:46] more moments here
[1:14:47] moments are not clearly defined how long
[1:14:50] they are
[1:14:51] but there's a few more of them and i
[1:14:53] have to share this because this is what
[1:14:55] to me was just what sealed the deal for
[1:14:56] me last week when i was looking at this
[1:15:00] how can you how do we describe
[1:15:06] the love of god
[1:15:10] as that song goes how do you explain
[1:15:14] how do you describe
[1:15:17] love that goes from east to west
[1:15:20] it runs as deep as it is and you know
[1:15:24] how you would strike
[1:15:25] start to try to describe it you'd say
[1:15:27] well it's like a mother loves
[1:15:28] her son that's where you would start
[1:15:32] you wouldn't start about a boy and his
[1:15:34] dog
[1:15:35] you wouldn't start with a man in his
[1:15:36] hobbies
[1:15:39] you wouldn't start with a horse trainer
[1:15:40] and his horses
[1:15:42] you wouldn't start about with a woman in
[1:15:44] her job
[1:15:46] a professor and his students what would
[1:15:49] you start with if you wanted to begin to
[1:15:51] understand
[1:15:52] instead of saying well it's like god so
[1:15:53] loved the world well what does that mean
[1:15:54] that god so loved
[1:15:56] you're trying to should take share with
[1:15:57] somebody the love of god you would begin
[1:15:59] with well you know how a mother
[1:16:01] cares for a child and then okay all
[1:16:03] right now imagine that
[1:16:05] and once you begin to understand that
[1:16:06] just multiply it to infinity
[1:16:09] and that's where you can begin to convey
[1:16:11] it why because a mother's love is like
[1:16:13] god's love
[1:16:15] what i was studying last week is the
[1:16:16] mystery of motherhood
[1:16:18] and how that god manifested himself in
[1:16:20] fatherhood and he get manifest himself
[1:16:22] in sonship
[1:16:23] and she had god the father god the son
[1:16:25] and god the holy ghost where is the
[1:16:26] mystery of motherhood
[1:16:28] where is it that he expresses himself in
[1:16:30] that attribute where is it that he
[1:16:32] conveys that and expresses that and you
[1:16:34] see the mystery of it come down through
[1:16:36] the entire bible
[1:16:37] and you'll have the perfection of it in
[1:16:38] this end time that we're living and let
[1:16:40] me say mothers you are called to reveal
[1:16:42] the mystery of motherhood
[1:16:47] a mother's love is like god's love
[1:16:51] strong unselfish
[1:16:55] it's fierce it's fearless
[1:17:00] that's what will cause a mother deer to
[1:17:03] stand up
[1:17:06] in the way of a hunter if she thinks her
[1:17:09] baby's in trouble so to cause a mother
[1:17:12] to run into flames of fire to rescue her
[1:17:14] child
[1:17:15] what compels a mother to do that
[1:17:18] it's the mother's love
[1:17:21] it's boundless it's brave in isaiah
[1:17:24] chapter 66 verse 13. i haven't just made
[1:17:27] this up that if you're going to
[1:17:28] begin to compare to get someone to
[1:17:31] understand the love of god you would
[1:17:33] start with the mother's love so guess
[1:17:34] what god does
[1:17:36] when he wants you to understand his
[1:17:37] commitment to you he can only point to
[1:17:40] the commitment of a mother for you to
[1:17:41] begin to understand it
[1:17:43] as one whom his mother comforteth so
[1:17:45] will i comfort you
[1:17:46] and you shall be comforted in jerusalem
[1:17:50] i want you to know just how much i'm
[1:17:52] going to comfort you
[1:17:53] and in order for you to understand just
[1:17:55] how much i'm going to comfort you
[1:17:56] think about how your mother comforted
[1:17:58] you and god has to use the mother as a
[1:18:00] model of his love
[1:18:03] why because the love of a mother is like
[1:18:05] god's love
[1:18:08] and this is why a mother who perverts
[1:18:10] her
[1:18:11] expression of love a mother who abandons
[1:18:13] her love to her children abandons her
[1:18:15] duty to her children
[1:18:16] a mother who forsakes this cause and
[1:18:18] care and concern over children for some
[1:18:20] other love and some other pursuit some
[1:18:22] other pride
[1:18:22] that is why it is so destructive to a
[1:18:25] child
[1:18:27] and that's why it just shocks
[1:18:30] and it's like there's this shadow that
[1:18:33] just reverberates within a child who's
[1:18:35] been rejected by their mother
[1:18:37] and it stays in there their whole life
[1:18:41] and where it does its most damage is
[1:18:43] when they want to start to love god
[1:18:46] and they're told he'll love you like
[1:18:47] your mom and they think i sure hope not
[1:18:52] think about it
[1:18:58] something is born in the woman when she
[1:19:01] gives birth to a child
[1:19:04] i think one person said at one time a
[1:19:05] woman is born again when she gives birth
[1:19:11] it releases a deep strength
[1:19:14] even in labor they've concluded that the
[1:19:16] pains that they experience
[1:19:17] and the the trauma that a woman's body
[1:19:20] goes through
[1:19:21] and then they come out of it and then
[1:19:22] you see the pictures and they're just
[1:19:23] like
[1:19:24] they're glowing and yeah it was a 72
[1:19:27] hour labor and
[1:19:28] no medicine nothing yeah it's all
[1:19:30] natural and it's like she's glowing
[1:19:33] but it doesn't even make sense you just
[1:19:35] think that well their body goes to
[1:19:37] getting hit by a truck
[1:19:39] what is it it's their strength that's
[1:19:40] relief and released in the woman
[1:19:43] a power a strength that comes abraham
[1:19:46] lincoln says i remember my mother's
[1:19:48] prayers
[1:19:49] and they have always followed me they've
[1:19:51] clung to me all my life
[1:19:54] one of the greatest presidents this
[1:19:55] country has ever known abraham lincoln
[1:19:57] says the prayers of my mom have clung to
[1:20:00] me my entire life
[1:20:02] what was it that was there clinging to
[1:20:04] him in the days of the civil war as he
[1:20:07] formed policy what was there clinging to
[1:20:08] him when he looked to god for guidance
[1:20:10] and faith
[1:20:10] the prayers of a mother you the mothers
[1:20:13] are called the fifth gospel there's a
[1:20:14] law of the mother that the bible refers
[1:20:16] to there's running out of
[1:20:17] time just to express all these things
[1:20:20] oliver wendell holmes he was a supreme
[1:20:21] court justice he says youth fades
[1:20:23] love drops the leaves of friendships
[1:20:26] fall
[1:20:27] amen youth fades love troops
[1:20:30] the leaves of friendship fall a mother's
[1:20:33] secret hope
[1:20:34] outlives them all oh there's so much
[1:20:37] power in that
[1:20:39] that's why you pined for it that's why
[1:20:41] you longed for what
[1:20:42] you wanted to know what your mother's
[1:20:44] hope was for you that's why it caused so
[1:20:45] much
[1:20:46] pain and travail when it's not
[1:20:47] communicating when it's not received but
[1:20:48] i
[1:20:49] instead of maybe going down that path
[1:20:50] though i sense maybe you're hurt in some
[1:20:52] of your hearts without going down that
[1:20:54] path think about what you have
[1:20:55] today as a mother an opportunity to get
[1:20:58] it right an
[1:20:59] opportunity to express it as it wasn't
[1:21:01] expressed to you an opportunity to know
[1:21:04] that youth fades and love droops and the
[1:21:06] leaves of friendship fall we've seen it
[1:21:08] happen in our lives
[1:21:09] but a mother's secret hope outlives them
[1:21:11] all the hope of a mother though it may
[1:21:13] be a mystery
[1:21:14] it stays with that child forever
[1:21:17] even to where the greatest president in
[1:21:19] the united states here she would stand
[1:21:21] there
[1:21:21] and say the prayers of my dead mother
[1:21:24] still cover me today
[1:21:28] this is a love and a hope
[1:21:31] that is not an engine to pride
[1:21:34] it's not a motivation to emotion or
[1:21:37] ambition
[1:21:41] but this is a love
[1:21:44] that is a motivation to the soul of her
[1:21:46] child
[1:21:48] to her child jesus says greater love
[1:21:51] hath no man than this
[1:21:53] that he lay down his life that a man lay
[1:21:55] down his life for his friends
[1:21:57] the greatest love is the sacrificial
[1:21:58] love
[1:22:00] if the greatest love is that christ
[1:22:02] would actually give his life
[1:22:03] think about the great love that is
[1:22:05] expressed when a mother says yes there's
[1:22:07] opportunities yes i could do that yes
[1:22:09] i'm a freeman agent
[1:22:10] yes i could get an education yes i'm
[1:22:12] very good at this yes i'm very good at
[1:22:13] that
[1:22:13] but i choose this
[1:22:16] there's not a greater love so there's a
[1:22:20] greater love and then it says in
[1:22:21] 3rd john 1 2-4 beloved i wish you above
[1:22:24] all things that thou mayest prosper and
[1:22:26] be in health this would be the love of a
[1:22:27] mother this would be a desire of a
[1:22:28] parent
[1:22:29] even as my soul prospereth for i rejoice
[1:22:31] greatly when the brethren came and
[1:22:33] testified to the truth that is in thee
[1:22:35] even as thou walkest in the truth and
[1:22:37] you're familiar with this statement
[1:22:39] i have no greater joy than to hear that
[1:22:42] my children
[1:22:43] walk in truth this is not a selfish kind
[1:22:46] of love
[1:22:47] this is not a love that's a point of
[1:22:49] pride you better do this and you better
[1:22:50] do that and
[1:22:51] succeed in this and do this and honor
[1:22:53] this and honor that and this all these
[1:22:54] different things but a desire there's no
[1:22:56] greater
[1:22:57] joy than to hear that your child is
[1:22:58] walking in truth
[1:23:01] if you can't rejoice that your child is
[1:23:02] walking in truth
[1:23:04] something's wrong somewhere
[1:23:08] i have no greater joy it's joined with
[1:23:09] the no greater love
[1:23:13] why because this love i'm talking about
[1:23:15] the love of a mother is not selfish
[1:23:19] because it's not selfish it's pursuing
[1:23:21] the right things
[1:23:23] and because it's pursuing the right
[1:23:24] things that's where a mother finds joy
[1:23:27] it's only when we let the devil take our
[1:23:28] eyes off that
[1:23:31] to oh what could be what could have been
[1:23:34] and we look at the wrong image the image
[1:23:35] that was broken the image that even the
[1:23:37] cultural image of the woman was so
[1:23:39] broken
[1:23:39] that even the women were complaining
[1:23:41] about it they just had the wrong
[1:23:42] solution
[1:23:46] i have four more scriptures actually six
[1:23:48] but i don't think i'm gonna use them all
[1:23:50] four more scriptures written down here
[1:23:53] let me just use this one to kind of
[1:23:54] bring it to this
[1:23:55] run home isaiah 49 15.
[1:23:58] now this is heavy
[1:24:02] can a woman forget her sucking child
[1:24:05] that she should not even have
[1:24:06] she should not have compassion on the
[1:24:08] son of her womb
[1:24:09] now it's meant to be in a sense a
[1:24:11] rhetorical question that as
[1:24:13] i desire you it's the same way that a
[1:24:15] mother desires a child and as
[1:24:17] a woman would always be mindful of her
[1:24:18] son that she uh breastfed that she would
[1:24:20] always have this compassion and love for
[1:24:22] him and she would not forget him and
[1:24:23] cast him off and
[1:24:25] and and wish ill upon him he's bringing
[1:24:27] this thought
[1:24:28] again when god wants you to understand
[1:24:30] how much he loves you
[1:24:31] he doesn't talk about daddy he talks
[1:24:33] about mom
[1:24:35] but then he says this yea they may
[1:24:38] forget
[1:24:41] yet will i not forget thee
[1:24:45] yea they may forget
[1:24:49] mothers don't forget
[1:24:53] if you have remember
[1:24:57] do not let the enemy steal your joy of
[1:25:01] motherhood
[1:25:04] do not be deceived by beauty and
[1:25:12] favor this line the illusion of the
[1:25:16] world that somehow you're missing out
[1:25:18] somehow you're being devalued somehow
[1:25:19] you're you're losing the power that you
[1:25:21] could have as a woman
[1:25:23] i say don't forget the world has
[1:25:26] devalued
[1:25:27] true womanhood the world today would try
[1:25:31] to define
[1:25:32] womanhood without motherhood but the
[1:25:35] miss just give me the signal if i need
[1:25:36] to grab a mic
[1:25:37] am i good how about the mic though
[1:25:42] okay
[1:25:45] the world has devalued womanhood
[1:25:50] they've taken motherhood right out of it
[1:25:53] now you that are sitting here today as
[1:25:54] mothers you think well i haven't really
[1:25:56] haven't really thought about it but you
[1:25:58] felt the pressure of it
[1:26:00] why because the image no longer is that
[1:26:04] a woman is called to be
[1:26:05] a wife and a mother it's a woman can be
[1:26:08] whatever she wants to be
[1:26:14] and the reason why it is devalued is
[1:26:16] because there's so much strength in it
[1:26:20] proverbs 31 25 strength and honor are
[1:26:22] her clothing
[1:26:24] don't let the world strip you of your
[1:26:25] clothing strength and armor
[1:26:28] honor are what clothe you strength and
[1:26:30] honor what keep you strength and honor
[1:26:32] or part of your clothing
[1:26:33] and being a virtuous woman as we said in
[1:26:36] the beginning i'd like to
[1:26:38] bring it back to this in closing joy is
[1:26:41] connected with purpose
[1:26:43] that we don't all sit here today and we
[1:26:45] think oh what will make me happy
[1:26:47] and then we strive to become happy we
[1:26:50] need to find
[1:26:51] meaning we need to find purpose and if
[1:26:55] it's problematic and how we're going to
[1:26:56] fulfill that purpose we can invert and
[1:26:58] ask ourselves what's going to keep me
[1:26:59] from it
[1:27:01] to narrow down our choices in life to
[1:27:02] narrow down our field to
[1:27:04] begin to understand better what's going
[1:27:05] to really produce joy as an outcome in
[1:27:07] the end
[1:27:09] and what victor frankl recognizes this
[1:27:10] strong desire within man to find meaning
[1:27:13] man's search for meaning he realized
[1:27:14] that in the concentration camps it was
[1:27:16] those
[1:27:17] who had purpose that survived and they
[1:27:20] were all
[1:27:21] enduring the same thing sharing some of
[1:27:23] the same genetic characteristics the
[1:27:25] same upbringing the same past the same
[1:27:27] families
[1:27:28] they all couldn't you couldn't
[1:27:29] differentiate you could control for all
[1:27:31] these other variables and come down to
[1:27:32] it and he sat there's a very educated
[1:27:34] and sharp man he could say listen
[1:27:36] i found in the end it was those who had
[1:27:39] a sense of purpose
[1:27:40] that could endure the concentration camp
[1:27:44] none of us are living in a concentration
[1:27:45] camp kids i don't care how bad you
[1:27:47] teenagers have it at home none of you
[1:27:49] have a concentration camp
[1:27:52] but there was something within those who
[1:27:55] had purpose
[1:27:56] that despite the deterioration of their
[1:27:59] body
[1:27:59] and the deplorable conditions and people
[1:28:02] dying just from fear and starvation and
[1:28:04] people dying
[1:28:05] from just the anxiety of a gas chamber
[1:28:08] there are those who lived and he said
[1:28:10] those who lived had purpose and had
[1:28:12] meaning
[1:28:13] and he came to this conclusion those
[1:28:15] that have a why to live can bear with
[1:28:18] almost
[1:28:18] any how hallelujah let me give brother
[1:28:21] victor and amen
[1:28:22] those who have a why to live can
[1:28:25] bear with almost anyhow listen don't
[1:28:28] worry with the
[1:28:29] about the what don't worry about the how
[1:28:31] it doesn't matter today how bad your
[1:28:32] home life is
[1:28:33] doesn't matter how bad your marriage is
[1:28:35] it doesn't matter how all those things
[1:28:36] are and stay with me it doesn't matter
[1:28:38] how if ultimately you understand the why
[1:28:43] give me a why to live
[1:28:47] and i don't even need to know why this
[1:28:49] is happening
[1:28:51] because i've got a purpose and i know
[1:28:52] that god would not offer anything that
[1:28:55] would keep me from it
[1:28:58] give me a why a why to marriage a wider
[1:29:01] raising children why why
[1:29:03] why once you know the why you can bear
[1:29:05] with almost anyhow
[1:29:07] it is in the meaning of motherhood that
[1:29:09] matters
[1:29:12] it is in the purpose of motherhood that
[1:29:14] matters not the how
[1:29:17] in other words when i say the false
[1:29:20] measures
[1:29:21] do you realize that even this i'd say
[1:29:23] this
[1:29:25] and i was pondering this yesterday and
[1:29:27] this is what brought me this is what
[1:29:28] when i read these things i came to this
[1:29:29] conclusion i thought well lord
[1:29:31] if i should share it please bring it to
[1:29:32] my my mind
[1:29:35] so often we try to measure our success
[1:29:39] in what makes a good mom what makes a
[1:29:41] good wife what makes it
[1:29:42] you can get so sidetracked by pursuing
[1:29:45] success
[1:29:46] you'll never find it that way you find
[1:29:49] it by just doing what you know you're
[1:29:51] supposed to do
[1:29:52] and regardless of the results in
[1:29:55] marriage and with your children
[1:29:57] if you've done what you're supposed to
[1:29:58] do there's fulfillment
[1:30:02] maybe someone said well i regret the way
[1:30:03] i raise my children i regret this i
[1:30:05] regret that
[1:30:06] then you you ask for forgiveness and you
[1:30:08] go forward
[1:30:09] and you know that even with our regrets
[1:30:11] god has a way of taking those
[1:30:13] and using them for his glory
[1:30:18] let's not have false measures and false
[1:30:19] metrics and what makes
[1:30:21] a successful wife what makes a
[1:30:22] successful mother but just know
[1:30:25] that if i am one then there's a purpose
[1:30:28] in it
[1:30:30] and i want to serve my purpose because
[1:30:32] that's where redemption is
[1:30:35] musicians if you'd come
[1:30:41] i'm glad in services like this that none
[1:30:44] of our musicians are mothers
[1:30:48] so that the mothers could just ponder
[1:30:50] these things as we close
[1:30:57] as i pondered that woman laying there in
[1:30:59] bed and
[1:31:00] afraid to even ask herself the silent
[1:31:02] question
[1:31:04] is this all i realize that as men
[1:31:09] we have to take our responsibility for
[1:31:11] causing the question because
[1:31:17] there there's there's enough there's
[1:31:18] enough blame right
[1:31:21] where everyone has their share in it
[1:31:25] but i believe that as husbands
[1:31:30] can take ownership of our charge
[1:31:34] and we acknowledge that as a daughter of
[1:31:38] god if there is some
[1:31:39] sense in your heart of a lack of
[1:31:42] satisfaction a lack of fulfillment
[1:31:46] that it wouldn't be a matter of us
[1:31:47] wagging our finger in your face and
[1:31:49] saying well you just don't see any
[1:31:50] purpose and meaning in marriage or
[1:31:51] purpose and meaning
[1:31:52] in raising children but we could
[1:31:54] acknowledge that
[1:31:56] that has no meaning without us
[1:32:01] and we could take ownership of the
[1:32:02] charge that god has given us to
[1:32:04] encourage
[1:32:04] to provide and to give a place for joy
[1:32:09] because i believe that's our
[1:32:10] responsibility
[1:32:12] it says in proverbs 31 verse 28 her
[1:32:14] children arise up and call her blessed
[1:32:17] which is happy joyful her husband also
[1:32:20] calls her blessed
[1:32:21] and he praiseth her
[1:32:24] this is something that we as children
[1:32:26] something that we can do
[1:32:28] as husbands we could take our
[1:32:29] responsibility and not just castigate
[1:32:32] the wife who's laying there in bed
[1:32:33] saying is this is all but realize
[1:32:35] maybe there's times when a woman feels
[1:32:37] that way because what's been provided
[1:32:40] isn't convenient for her joy
[1:32:44] and that's to be an avenue for it we can
[1:32:46] join together in this purpose
[1:32:49] of pure joy it says in proverbs 31 31
[1:32:54] give her this virtuous woman this wife
[1:32:56] this mother
[1:32:57] give her the fruit of her hands in other
[1:33:00] words
[1:33:01] ponder this this is your reward
[1:33:05] don't take this the wrong way you want
[1:33:07] the pat on the back you want the
[1:33:09] accolades you want the recognition you
[1:33:11] want
[1:33:11] you want things to uh to be honored you
[1:33:14] want to somehow win
[1:33:15] look i won mother of the year i didn't
[1:33:16] even know if i had a contest i
[1:33:18] we want that but the bible says just let
[1:33:21] her enjoy the fruits of her labor
[1:33:25] that's your reward and this and let her
[1:33:26] own works this is beautiful
[1:33:28] let her own works praise her in the
[1:33:30] gates
[1:33:32] the man gets praised in the gates he
[1:33:35] needs to hear it in the gates he hears
[1:33:37] it from the children
[1:33:37] hears it from the family he hears it
[1:33:39] from everybody a man gets the lord and
[1:33:41] the accolades of the palace good job oh
[1:33:42] you're doing really good the man gets
[1:33:44] all the attention
[1:33:45] and the woman is just there silently at
[1:33:47] home serving and laboring and doing
[1:33:49] everything she can
[1:33:50] and the bible says she may not get all
[1:33:52] the praise and adoration and glory
[1:33:54] so let her own works be her praise
[1:33:57] therefore you can do it as unto the lord
[1:34:00] knowing from whom your reward comes
[1:34:03] if i don't need man to pat me on the
[1:34:05] back i don't need this i don't need that
[1:34:06] i don't need this i just need to do
[1:34:08] what's pleasing to the lord and know and
[1:34:11] know
[1:34:11] that i'm in his calling that in no way
[1:34:14] absolves us as men
[1:34:15] from doing our part but i say that to
[1:34:16] encourage our mothers today
[1:34:18] that your labor is your reward there's
[1:34:20] reward in your labor there's fruit in
[1:34:22] your labor
[1:34:23] and your works in your purpose will be
[1:34:25] your praise
[1:34:28] you want to know how to be happy you
[1:34:30] want to know how to find joy
[1:34:32] it will be in living a meaningful life
[1:34:37] and i say don't forget daughters of god
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:41] don't forget the calling you have as a
[1:34:43] mother
[1:34:45] don't let the world steal you of your
[1:34:47] joy as a mother
[1:34:51] could you accept that today
[1:34:55] could we do this
[1:35:00] if you are a child
[1:35:03] a spouse and you're next to your mom
[1:35:07] your mom's within reach could we just
[1:35:08] bow our heads
[1:35:09] could you put your hands lay your hands
[1:35:10] on your mom
[1:35:12] or the mother there's a
[1:35:16] you need to move to a husband can do it
[1:35:20] for the wife
[1:35:24] and you could pray for them this mother
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:32] why is motherhood attacked why is the
[1:35:34] woman attacked she's carrying a mystery
[1:35:38] let's bow our heads in prayer
[1:35:46] just pray now for the wife or the mother
[1:35:51] and pray an honest prayer that god would
[1:35:53] strengthen her and encourage her
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:36:00] our heavenly father thank you for
[1:36:03] allowing us to have a mother's day
[1:36:04] service
[1:36:07] thank you for allowing us to do it in
[1:36:08] the afternoon
[1:36:10] there could be an intimacy and personal
[1:36:13] touch
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:18] thank you for our wives and for our
[1:36:21] mothers of our children and
[1:36:22] we as children we thank you for our
[1:36:24] mothers
[1:36:28] lord we're in awe of how when you wanted
[1:36:32] to express
[1:36:32] to israel your love for them you used a
[1:36:35] mother's love as an example
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:41] and i believe it's encouraging in the
[1:36:42] scripture that you say
[1:36:44] they may forget
[1:36:47] because i know that there's mothers here
[1:36:49] today that as a result of circumstances
[1:36:51] whether it be a broken marriage or
[1:36:52] wayward children or
[1:36:55] even just current difficulties within
[1:36:56] the home it's easy
[1:36:59] to lose the joy of motherhood
[1:37:04] and to lose the real happiness and
[1:37:07] enthusiasm
[1:37:08] and inspiration but i remember just
[1:37:12] writing down last week mothers don't
[1:37:14] lose your inspiration
[1:37:17] and how the love of that mother deer
[1:37:20] inspired a man bert called to give his
[1:37:23] heart to the lord
[1:37:25] how the prayers of abraham lincoln's
[1:37:28] mother
[1:37:28] covered him years later
[1:37:32] how a mother's secret hope outlast them
[1:37:35] all
[1:37:37] i thought lord don't let our mothers
[1:37:38] lose their inspiration
[1:37:41] don't let our wives lose their
[1:37:42] inspiration
[1:37:44] by some kind of false image a lie of the
[1:37:46] devil an illusion
[1:37:50] and lord i it struck me in such a way to
[1:37:52] realize that the word
[1:37:53] places it with such there's such beauty
[1:37:56] and power in just the office
[1:37:59] that even a woman married to an awful
[1:38:02] nasty husband
[1:38:04] can still serve you and do that which is
[1:38:05] pleasing in your sight
[1:38:09] even a woman whose children are backslid
[1:38:11] and wayward can still find
[1:38:13] that there was purpose and is purpose in
[1:38:16] being a mother still yet
[1:38:18] and that the joy the joy of a mother was
[1:38:20] not contingent upon
[1:38:22] the success of the marriage it was not
[1:38:24] contingent upon the success of the
[1:38:26] children but rather
[1:38:27] it was contingent upon whether she
[1:38:28] fulfills her duty as a mother
[1:38:31] father that's what i pray for our
[1:38:33] mothers is that you would give them
[1:38:35] strength
[1:38:36] to occupy their calling that you would
[1:38:39] give them
[1:38:40] energy and enthusiasm and ambition not
[1:38:42] to achieve success
[1:38:44] but to live a meaningful life
[1:38:47] to fulfill their purpose
[1:38:50] they are called lord to be mothers
[1:38:53] we are nothing without them and we pray
[1:38:56] tonight that you would bless them that
[1:38:58] you would strengthen them that you would
[1:38:59] encourage them
[1:39:01] for the offenses and the faults and the
[1:39:03] hurts on our part god we pray that you
[1:39:05] would heal
[1:39:07] that you would do what only you could do
[1:39:09] father and take wounds and scars and
[1:39:11] deep hurts and cover them over with the
[1:39:13] balm that would deeply heal him
[1:39:16] and lord may it not be done in such a
[1:39:17] way that we would feel justified and
[1:39:19] absolved but lord may it be done
[1:39:22] to first begin and to promote the
[1:39:23] healing to the breach that is in their
[1:39:26] emotions and their spirits
[1:39:28] that are related to the marriage into
[1:39:30] the relationship with children
[1:39:33] that lord if you could begin to heal
[1:39:34] those wounds and those scars then the
[1:39:36] relationship can begin to be
[1:39:38] repaired and healed
[1:39:41] and that's what we ask for lord not an
[1:39:43] opportunity to sweep under
[1:39:44] everything under the rug but an
[1:39:45] opportunity to begin to do things right
[1:39:47] and do things correctly
[1:39:49] and on this day this mother's day what
[1:39:51] our prayer is for our moms is pure joy
[1:39:55] we cannot promise them a life of ease we
[1:39:57] cannot promise them a lack of heartache
[1:39:59] we cannot promise them
[1:40:01] that there will be no disappointments or
[1:40:02] hardships or great
[1:40:04] loss and even broken hearts and
[1:40:07] shattered dreams lord we cannot
[1:40:12] answer what the how is
[1:40:16] but lord if they can know the why
[1:40:21] if they can have meaning lord
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:25] then no matter how early monday comes
[1:40:29] that mama will get up and work
