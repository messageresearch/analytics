[0:00] Acts chapter
[0:01] 7 thank you musicians Acts chapter 7 I'd
[0:05] like to read verses 1
[0:12] to6 Acts chapter 17 Acts chapter 17
[0:16] veres
[0:20] 1-6 my title today is pure joy and so
[0:25] overwhelmed with the subject matter and
[0:27] there's so much um so many ditions to it
[0:30] and breth to it uh that I know that this
[0:33] will just be the first part um and on
[0:36] this subject and Lord willing to speak
[0:38] many different services on pure joy and
[0:41] amplify that more but then my subject or
[0:44] subtitle is invert always invert and
[0:47] hopefully that'll make some sense to you
[0:48] here in a little bit uh but our sub our
[0:51] title is pure joy that's a subject
[0:53] matter and then a kind of a subtitle is
[0:55] invert always invert acts chap 17 veres
[0:58] 1 to6 and when they had passed through
[1:00] amphipolis and
[1:02] appollonia they came to thessalonica
[1:05] where was a synagogue of the Jews and
[1:07] Paul as his manner was went unto them
[1:09] and three Sabbath day Sabbath days
[1:12] reasoned with them out of the scriptures
[1:14] opening and alleging that Christ must
[1:17] needs have suffered and risen again from
[1:19] the dead and that this Jesus whom I
[1:22] preach unto you is Christ wow powerful
[1:25] and some of them believed and consorted
[1:26] with Paul and Silas and of The Devout
[1:28] Greeks a great multitude and of the
[1:30] chief women not a few but the Jews which
[1:33] believed not moved with Envy took unto
[1:36] them certain lewd fellows of the baser
[1:39] sort thank you Luke for that uh rare
[1:41] insult certain lwd fellows of the baser
[1:44] sort and gathered a company and set all
[1:47] the city on an uproar and assaulted the
[1:50] house of Jason and sought to bring them
[1:52] out to the
[1:54] people and when they found them not they
[1:57] drew Jason and certain Brethren unto the
[1:59] rulers of the city crying these that
[2:02] have turned the world upside down are
[2:05] come hither also think about that phrase
[2:07] these that have turned the world upside
[2:10] down are come hither also amen God bless
[2:13] you you may have your
[2:15] seats these that have turned the world
[2:18] upside down I'm ministering on and
[2:22] beginning to look at the subject of pure
[2:24] joy and I'd like to make maybe just a
[2:26] few comments at the outset to express
[2:29] how God's been dealing with with my
[2:30] heart on this subject of joy and the way
[2:32] that it's impressed me is in looking at
[2:35] it even in the sense of pure joy it's
[2:37] about fully experiencing the joy of the
[2:40] Lord amid all the chaos that surrounds
[2:42] us and the confusion uh that seems to be
[2:45] so near whether it be criticism or some
[2:47] sort of Confrontation and even maybe in
[2:50] the midst of conflict some sort of
[2:52] warfare that we could find that there is
[2:55] this steadiness and there's this
[2:56] consistency of pure joy and scripture
[3:00] if in looking at the word joy in the Old
[3:02] Testament and we hold true in the Hebrew
[3:06] as well and Greek that pure joy is a
[3:09] gladness it is a joy is a gladness it is
[3:12] a rejoicing and so when we say pure joy
[3:15] we're talking about a gladness or
[3:17] rejoicing a happiness even that is not
[3:19] born of dissonance where in our minds
[3:21] we're trying to uh you know plate
[3:23] ourselves and keep us from being
[3:25] conscious of certain things it's not a a
[3:27] carnal mechanism of a dissonance or even
[3:30] a f a psychological defense where we
[3:32] have psychological immunity where we try
[3:34] to protect ourselves and keep ourselves
[3:36] from feeling pain and convincing
[3:38] ourselves yeah I I I'm really happy with
[3:40] the fact that my house burnt down it's
[3:42] great no it's wonderful that's not what
[3:44] I'm talking about when I'm talk about
[3:46] joy and those kind of mechanisms but
[3:48] rather I'm talking about a pure joy
[3:51] which Finds Its Genesis in the Divi in
[3:53] in the Divine so it's a joy that has a
[3:56] Divine gen Divine Genesis it begins in
[3:58] God it's a joy that's more than an
[4:01] emotion so part of this is is we kind of
[4:03] use this as a a basis it's a joy that's
[4:06] more than an emotion but it's it's an
[4:08] abiding condition something permanent
[4:10] something firm something real and as
[4:13] I've been studying the subject of Joy
[4:15] there's there's so many different
[4:16] components and facets to it one began to
[4:18] stand out to me that I found in the
[4:20] message of the hour and I just want to
[4:23] address it very quickly brother Ram
[4:25] makes the statement Brethren we've had
[4:26] churches bubble dancing long enough
[4:30] think about that we've had the church's
[4:32] bubble dancing bubble dance long enough
[4:35] we got to get down to something real
[4:38] then things all right so bubble dance is
[4:40] all right says but we got to get down to
[4:42] Something Real it's the joy of the Lord
[4:44] many times instead of the power of the
[4:46] Lord and brother man makes a few
[4:48] statements where he's identifying a a
[4:51] joy of the Lord that can be expressed in
[4:54] in excitement and exuberance and and
[4:56] some sort of physical manifestation
[4:59] jumping shouting praising rejoicing and
[5:01] those things and he's saying you can
[5:03] have this joy of the Lord Dynamic
[5:05] wherein the spirit of God will be poured
[5:07] out upon All Flesh and people can get
[5:09] excited and they can dance and they can
[5:10] shout even as he says here the we've had
[5:13] the church's bubble dance and he says
[5:15] but we've got to have something real you
[5:17] can have Bubble dancing he said it's all
[5:18] right nothing against bubble dancing but
[5:20] you need something real and he's
[5:22] identifying a power of God so he's this
[5:26] is the uh this is how he's setting it
[5:29] there's a joy of the Lord many times but
[5:31] it's not the power of the Lord so he's
[5:33] identifying in these different
[5:34] statements an emotional
[5:36] Dynamic that produces an excitement
[5:39] that's
[5:40] temporal where a spirit the spirit can
[5:42] move in service and people shout and
[5:44] people dance and people get all excited
[5:45] and we even say my I didn't even know
[5:47] she was could get loud like that I
[5:49] didn't know that brother could dance and
[5:50] and we see something maybe we don't
[5:52] normally see manifest in people's lives
[5:54] but there's a different side where he
[5:56] says it's the power of the Lord that uh
[5:58] that's different than this move he says
[6:00] in another place the spirit of the lord
[6:02] it's anointing many people don't
[6:04] understand what anointing means they
[6:06] think it means to shout and he says
[6:09] that's Joy so some people think anointed
[6:11] is shouting and sweating and expression
[6:13] and and and let's just be honest that
[6:16] there's a way that sometimes we view S
[6:19] Services and if they don't get loud the
[6:21] people Don't Clap the people don't shout
[6:23] people don't cry if there's people not
[6:25] at the altar if you don't have a prayer
[6:26] line the meetings were a flop however it
[6:28] is sometimes we're looking to the
[6:29] outside and the external to determine
[6:32] whether or not the the anointing was
[6:33] really there he like well I don't even
[6:35] know if he was anointed at all he didn't
[6:36] even sweat but somehow if the guy's
[6:39] sweating and his tie gets a skew and he
[6:41] takes his coat off and we're like man he
[6:43] just seemed to be so anointed no it was
[6:45] just humid or he was hot and he needs to
[6:47] lose some weight or something it doesn't
[6:49] always have to be the anointing but he's
[6:51] saying that's a that that they think
[6:53] that means to shout he says that's Joy
[6:55] then he says power comes solemn that's
[6:58] the joy of the Lord this is the power of
[6:59] the Lord healing making well and he uses
[7:03] this line when he's looking at how when
[7:05] the spirit of God can move in a meeting
[7:07] shouting and there's Charisma and
[7:08] there's excitement and physical exercise
[7:11] and he's doing this from the basis of
[7:13] even his own Ministry because you'll
[7:15] find that whenever it came time for
[7:16] prayer lines and it came time for
[7:18] healing and the power of God to move
[7:20] there wasn't a bunch of shouting and
[7:21] carrying on everything got very sober
[7:23] and very solemn and brother brandham is
[7:25] saying this is different with the power
[7:26] of God it's more quiet it's more sober
[7:28] it's more solemn and brother Craig Boer
[7:31] brought it to my attention one time he
[7:32] was expressing his heart on things and
[7:33] he says you know we don't do prayer
[7:35] lines in the message like brother
[7:36] brandham did prayer lines and it really
[7:38] kind of caught my attention I kind of
[7:40] expounded a little bit on on how the
[7:42] Lord was dealing with his heart because
[7:43] you'll find that in those prayer lines
[7:45] that it was more sober it was more quiet
[7:47] it was more solemn the word had the uh
[7:49] the focus a and the promise of God was
[7:52] what was was being enacted was being
[7:54] done but then there's a certain way that
[7:56] prayer lines anymore is just who can hit
[7:58] the person the hardest with their Palm
[8:00] without them noticing that that's
[8:02] exactly what you did uh my dad tells the
[8:05] story one time he' just come to the Lord
[8:06] and just come to the message and he
[8:08] hadn't been around the charismatic side
[8:10] of of the gospel and hadn't been in
[8:12] Pentecost or anything and he said there
[8:14] was a sister come through the prayer
[8:15] line he's just a young preacher he's up
[8:17] there and this sister was going through
[8:20] going my dad you know CES her coming
[8:22] along and he puts his hand on he says
[8:24] bless God he said Heavenly Father heal
[8:26] her neck in the name of the Lord Jesus
[8:29] Christ and she straightened right up
[8:30] like and then my dad looked at her and
[8:32] said praise God like he's already healed
[8:35] that Twitch in her neck and and so
[8:38] there's a way that brother Bam's
[8:39] recognizing that there can be a move of
[8:41] God where people are shouting they're
[8:43] they're screaming they're running the
[8:44] aisles they're praising he says that's
[8:46] the joy of the Lord says but then
[8:48] there's also a dynamic of the power of
[8:49] God and it's more sober it's more solemn
[8:52] and he's addressing the manifestation of
[8:54] a spirit how a spirit would move in a
[8:55] service the moving of the spirit in a
[8:58] service and how people would inter
[8:59] interact with it and how that they would
[9:01] rejoice and
[9:02] Shout now with identifying that
[9:06] distinction there is a joy which is
[9:10] power the Bible says the joy of the Lord
[9:12] is my strength there is a joy which is
[9:15] power there is a joy which is manifested
[9:18] in the same solemn power that brother
[9:21] bradam is talking about and it's a joy
[9:23] that transcends
[9:26] emotion it it's not a joy of the spirit
[9:28] where I'm exuding and I'm excited I feel
[9:30] good today and I and I feel like
[9:31] shouting but it's a joy that's deeper
[9:33] than that and it transcends just the
[9:35] type of emotions that we have says in
[9:37] Hebrews chap 12:2 who for the joy
[9:40] speaking of Jesus Christ the author and
[9:42] the finisher of our faith I want just to
[9:44] take this piece out of that scripture
[9:46] who for the joy that was set before him
[9:48] endured the cross now this is different
[9:50] than Jesus looking forward to a time
[9:52] where he would dance and he would shout
[9:54] and because this bubble dance is coming
[9:56] up I'm going to be so I'm so excited for
[9:58] the bubble dance that's not the joy
[10:00] which was set before him who for the joy
[10:02] that was set before him endured the
[10:04] cross so Christ had a case or occasion
[10:07] to Joy and that's what gave him the per
[10:11] that's what allowed him to persevere
[10:13] past the suffering and the reproach and
[10:16] the word Joy there is also used to
[10:18] persons who are one's Joy so he says for
[10:20] the joy which was set before him you can
[10:22] say this is you for this Pride this joy
[10:25] in the in and his his desire to see you
[10:28] and his and in your election and your
[10:31] predestination with that Joy set before
[10:33] him this abiding condition this
[10:35] permanence this something that
[10:37] transcends emotion like oh once I get
[10:39] through this I'll feel better we don't
[10:41] want to make ourselves hurt just so that
[10:43] we can appreciate not hurting and so
[10:45] he's saying for the joy which was set
[10:46] before him it wasn't an emotion it was
[10:49] something greater than that and so when
[10:51] we talk about pure joy we're not talking
[10:53] an exuberance and an exaltation we're
[10:55] identifying something deeper than that
[10:58] that a believer holds deep within their
[11:00] hearts and it allows them to go forward
[11:02] in such a chaotic time there is a pure
[11:06] joy do you believe that there is a pure
[11:10] joy and there are things that stand
[11:12] between you and pure
[11:14] joy and this is where taking just a
[11:16] little bit of a turn to focus on a um H
[11:19] maybe a little kind of a preamble on
[11:21] this subject there's a pure joy and
[11:24] there's someone that wants to stand in
[11:25] the way of your pure joy in the message
[11:28] greatest battle ever fought and a lot of
[11:30] the things that we're
[11:32] pondering uh today are from this message
[11:35] greatest battle ever fought brother
[11:37] remember says Satan Army brings diseases
[11:39] so I've laid my Foundation now you could
[11:42] if you didn't have that background of
[11:43] pure joy I still think this would just
[11:46] resonate with you as a separate subject
[11:48] but let's just begin to think about this
[11:50] a little bit Satan's Army brings
[11:53] diseases That's what Satan is he's a
[11:56] destroyer so Ponder these attributes and
[11:58] characteristics of Satan he has an army
[12:00] he's bringing disease he's a destroyer
[12:04] Satan the whole Kingdom of Satan is
[12:05] sickness death and sorrow and
[12:07] frustrations and worry all of Satan if
[12:11] we were kind of just stacking up uh uh
[12:14] characteristics and doing pros and cons
[12:16] these are all the all the negative sides
[12:18] of life and these are the things that
[12:21] are represented by Satan's kingdom
[12:22] sickness death sorrow frustrations and
[12:24] worry disease he's a destroyer and then
[12:28] on the other hand God is life Faith joy
[12:31] peace over here now if we could just
[12:33] imagine it that this is a battle a
[12:36] battle's being set in Array and you have
[12:38] on one side the Destroyer you have
[12:40] disease you have sickness you have
[12:42] sorrow you have frustration you have
[12:44] worry and you have death this is the
[12:46] negative things but then you have on the
[12:49] other side the positive side which is
[12:51] God in life Faith joy peace over here
[12:54] and one's on one side and one's on the
[12:57] other and what are these they're
[13:01] opposites this is what I want you to
[13:03] begin to ponder why are they
[13:06] opposites because we could focus so much
[13:08] well Satan is a destroyer and Satan has
[13:11] sickness and he has sorrow and he has
[13:12] frustration and he has worry but why do
[13:15] those things even
[13:17] exist worry only exists because there's
[13:20] peace fear only exists because there's
[13:24] Faith death only exists because there's
[13:27] life the these different characteristics
[13:30] in natur Satan is a destroyer because
[13:32] God is a
[13:34] Creator and and and that this is where
[13:37] I'm starting to kind of get into my my
[13:38] thought about invert always invert but I
[13:41] want you to just before we get there
[13:42] think on one hand you have all these
[13:44] dirty vile filthy horrible
[13:47] characteristics but then you have on the
[13:48] other side God is life Faith joy peace
[13:51] over here those things only exist
[13:53] because there's a positive
[13:55] side and we're not just focusing on
[13:58] Satan's AR he's got death he's got
[14:00] disease he's got sorrow he's got
[14:01] sickness why do these things even exist
[14:04] within his
[14:05] army why would these things even show up
[14:08] and begin to press Upon Our psyche or
[14:10] our experience our lives and our family
[14:13] in our experience why are these things
[14:15] even encro seem to be encroaching
[14:18] consider
[14:19] that now in Revelations 2:
[14:24] 24 he says but I say unto you in this
[14:28] description of the theran age but I say
[14:30] unto you and unto the rest in thyra as
[14:34] many as have not this Doctrine in which
[14:36] have not known the depths of Satan as
[14:38] they speak I will put upon you none
[14:41] other
[14:42] burden and that we know there's a lot of
[14:44] depth to this statement but I want to
[14:46] focus on how he says we have not known
[14:49] the depths of Satan brother bam points
[14:52] out how that none of the commentators
[14:53] have anything to say about this look at
[14:55] commentaries you look at uh things that
[14:57] people say and in his study he found
[14:59] that there's not a lot of people trying
[15:01] to express what the depths of Satan were
[15:05] and this is how he approaches it now
[15:07] catch this let us first know what the
[15:10] depth of God is and the opposite will be
[15:13] true for the depth of Satan so we can
[15:16] read the scripture and say well we have
[15:17] not known the depths of Satan and we can
[15:19] be like oh well let's figure this out
[15:21] don't you want to know the depths of
[15:23] Satan let's know how how deep it goes
[15:25] and how horrible it is and how dark it
[15:28] is and let let's get into this let's
[15:30] roll up our sleeves and let's really
[15:31] really wrestle this out let's have a
[15:33] weekl long retreat for Ministry to kind
[15:35] of figure out what the depths of Satan
[15:37] are and you could approach it from that
[15:38] standpoint we want to know the depths of
[15:41] Satan so let's get into his thoughts and
[15:43] his attributes and his characteristics
[15:44] and all the things that we could see
[15:46] through history and our own experience
[15:47] and things in the scripture but brother
[15:49] bam says no you don't need to figure out
[15:52] and study the depths of Satan all you
[15:54] need to know first is what the depth of
[15:56] God is and if you know the depth of God
[16:00] then you could just take the opposite
[16:02] and know the depth of Satan if you could
[16:04] just if you just approach it as well if
[16:06] Satan is I if Satan is the opposite then
[16:09] I don't need to know everything about
[16:11] Satan to know the depth of it I just
[16:13] need to know everything I need to know
[16:14] about truth to know that the opposite is
[16:17] how deep Satan will go now in this he he
[16:21] quotes from Ephesians chapter 3: 16 to
[16:23] 18 and I've excluded it because he
[16:25] begins he kind of summarizes it in the
[16:27] next few statements now according to
[16:29] these verses when a man experiences the
[16:31] depth of God in his life it is an actual
[16:34] personal experience of the spirit of God
[16:36] indwelling in him and his mind is
[16:39] illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge
[16:41] of God through the
[16:43] word but the depth of Satan will be in
[16:46] that he will attempt to destroy
[16:48] this so there's only a depth of Satan
[16:51] because there's a deepness to God
[16:53] there's only a lie because there's a
[16:56] truth and he says this this actual
[16:58] personal experience of the spirit
[16:59] indwelling and Illuminating the Mind by
[17:01] wisdom and knowledge through the word
[17:03] the depth of Satan is his attempt to
[17:05] destroy this he will as always attempt
[17:08] to make a substitute for this reality of
[17:11] God how will he do it he will take away
[17:15] the knowledge of the truth of God
[17:17] destroy the word by putting forth his
[17:19] own yay hath God
[17:22] said this is very important to consider
[17:25] very important to ponder very deeply how
[17:28] is what what are the depths of Satan
[17:30] he's got to chip away at something that
[17:32] already exists he's a perverter he can't
[17:35] create he cannot derive his own truth he
[17:38] cannot come up with something of his own
[17:40] he can only work as a defiler and a
[17:42] perverter of Truth so if Satan has a
[17:45] gospel he's borrowing borrowing
[17:47] something about truth and perverting it
[17:49] and twisting it and adding something he
[17:51] doesn't have his own Messiah he can only
[17:53] pervert pervert the truth of the
[17:55] Messiah yeah hath God said he puts forth
[17:57] his own he will then substitute the
[17:59] personal Christ in our
[18:01] Spirits wow now that's that's a heavy
[18:04] statement we who are born again have the
[18:07] personal Christ in our spirits and what
[18:10] Satan wants to do is give you a
[18:11] substitute for that where I'm no longer
[18:14] enjoying that I'm no longer connected
[18:16] with that I'm no longer subject to that
[18:18] but he wants to give us a substitute for
[18:20] the personal Christ in our spirits and
[18:22] just in that way that if every action
[18:25] has an equal and opposite reaction we're
[18:26] getting scientific today then if there's
[18:29] some sort of Christ that's supposed to
[18:31] be in your heart that's supposed to have
[18:32] the preeminence and then Satan wants to
[18:35] do a substitute then there's something
[18:37] that kicks back and that's when you
[18:39] begin to know the depths of Despair
[18:41] that's when there's a sense of
[18:42] hopelessness when the personal Christ is
[18:45] substituted in our spirits and let me
[18:47] say if you have never come to know the
[18:49] Lord personally he's given you a
[18:51] substitute to keep you from
[18:53] it he says he will do it as he caused
[18:56] Israel to do the same by a human being
[18:59] reigning as King instead of God the Born
[19:02] Again experience what is the Born Again
[19:04] experience the spirit of God indwelling
[19:06] in you and your mind being illuminated
[19:08] by the wisdom and knowledge of God
[19:10] through the word the Born Again
[19:11] experience will be rejected in favor of
[19:13] church
[19:15] joining it kind of makes it uh I mean
[19:19] maybe maybe it's easy for us to amen
[19:20] that because we we we we we believe that
[19:23] it's not just join in a church but I
[19:25] mean why can't the Born Again experience
[19:27] be rejected in favor of selling
[19:31] drugs you you didn't think about that
[19:33] you had thought about
[19:34] that why can't it be uh the Born Again
[19:38] experience will be directed in favor of
[19:39] rejecting
[19:42] Christ it's it puts it on a plan where
[19:45] man the devil's pretty shrewd isn't
[19:48] he born again experience is replaced
[19:51] with just church joining then and this
[19:54] is where the language begins to get very
[19:56] heavy the depths of Satan have been in
[19:58] had been entered into that age the depth
[20:00] of Satan had entered into the age and
[20:02] the fruit of that depth of Satan which
[20:04] are lies murders and horrible crimes
[20:06] came forth from it and somehow brother
[20:10] Bram is placing the depths of
[20:12] Satan on par of of joining Church on par
[20:16] with lies murders and horrible crimes
[20:18] that come from it now why do these
[20:21] things exist because the opposite of the
[20:23] depths of
[20:25] God where there's life and there's joy
[20:28] and there's there's satisfaction and
[20:30] there's power and there's righteousness
[20:32] the fruit of the depth of Satan there
[20:33] lies murders and horrible crimes they
[20:35] come forth from it but notice how the
[20:37] Born Again experience is usurped he
[20:39] replaces the personal Christ in our
[20:41] Spirits he destroys the word of God by
[20:43] putting forth his own he takes away the
[20:45] knowledge of the truth of God and he
[20:47] wants to substitute the reality of God
[20:50] for something else and that's what leads
[20:52] to the depth of Satan how is there any
[20:54] depth to Satan because there's such
[20:56] great depth to God
[21:00] so he says first
[21:02] know first know what the depth of God is
[21:06] this is the next slide there first know
[21:08] what the depth of God is and the
[21:10] opposite will be true for the depth of
[21:13] Satan and what is brother brandham doing
[21:15] when he takes this scripture they have
[21:17] not known the depths of Satan and
[21:20] instead of him saying well they haven't
[21:22] known it do we know it what does it mean
[21:23] what does it mean to know it he does not
[21:26] pursue the path of trying to figure out
[21:27] the depths of Satan he just says first
[21:30] know what the depth of God is and then
[21:31] you could just take the opposite for the
[21:33] truth of the depth of Satan this is
[21:37] inversion not perversion or conversion
[21:40] this is inversion inversion is the
[21:42] reversal of a position reversal of an
[21:45] order or even a reversal of a form or
[21:47] the reversal of a
[21:49] relationship the word invert it means to
[21:52] put upside down or in the opposite
[21:54] position the opposite order the opposite
[21:56] Arrangement so we're looking at well
[21:57] let's look at the deps of Satan brother
[21:59] man says well if you want to know the
[22:00] depths of Satan then just look at look
[22:02] at the depths of God he's changed the
[22:04] order he's changed the arrangement he's
[22:06] changed the
[22:07] view and so Carl jacobe he was a
[22:10] mathematician he had this phrase and it
[22:12] wasn't in English but this is what it
[22:13] translates to invert always
[22:17] invert and if you invert that it's
[22:19] invert always
[22:22] invert that's kind of the the cleverness
[22:24] to it so this is you say invert always
[22:28] invert
[22:29] and it was a maxim to describe an
[22:32] approach to difficult problems so invert
[22:36] always invert relates to things that are
[22:38] difficult to figure out problems
[22:39] hardships uh uh uh Pathways things that
[22:42] you're try you're wrestling with and
[22:43] trying to figure out and it speaks of
[22:45] how that many hard problems are best
[22:47] solved when addressed
[22:50] backwards and in instead of and it's
[22:52] it's just a different way of thinking
[22:55] things thinking about things it's the
[22:58] ter into things upside down that you
[23:00] have a problem and instead of trying to
[23:02] figure out a way to get to to to get to
[23:05] this or to figure this out you start in
[23:07] a different place than you normally
[23:09] would and work your way backwards I
[23:11] think it's Charles Munger who made the
[23:12] statement tell me where I'm going to die
[23:14] tell me the place I'm going to die and
[23:16] I'll always avoid
[23:18] it right and this is kind of the idea of
[23:21] working backwards and what we really
[23:23] really I really really want to do this I
[23:25] I I want to I want to be able to
[23:27] accomplish this I want to be able to
[23:29] have this instead of trying to figure
[23:30] out what's going to get you there you
[23:31] think about what's going to keep you
[23:32] from getting there what's going to stand
[23:34] in the way what's going to keep you from
[23:36] getting it and so this is the these are
[23:38] kind of the thoughts behind how a hard
[23:40] problem can be addressed through
[23:42] inversion or addressed backwards where
[23:44] you look at a problem well it's this way
[23:45] it's this way it's this way oh turn it
[23:46] around work backwards address it
[23:49] differently and this is so this is
[23:53] um this invert always invert this is
[23:56] where and even the idea of pure
[23:59] joy this is the foundation this is how
[24:02] how the Lord dealt with me on in this
[24:05] and we spoke about it very briefly
[24:07] Wednesday night I I've been pondering
[24:10] mind
[24:12] battles and in these mind battles and
[24:17] just how pervasive they can be if you
[24:19] have a battle in your mind it's it's a
[24:20] battle everywhere it's present with you
[24:23] it seems to both be internal and
[24:25] external it's mental and physical it's
[24:27] emotional it just seems to go everywhere
[24:29] and it it weighs down upon your soul it
[24:31] clouds your spirit it causes your body
[24:33] to feel heavy and to feel sick and so
[24:35] there's so much to mind battles and then
[24:37] I was pondering the greatest battle ever
[24:39] fought my wife had been listening to
[24:40] that we'd been fellowshipping on it and
[24:42] that's kind of how these things have
[24:44] been thinking about it and where the
[24:46] inversion part comes into it is I
[24:49] realize that we can view Warfare we can
[24:52] view the the battle and the fighting and
[24:54] the struggle in a way that brings
[24:56] additional discouragement or it's what
[24:59] causes the
[25:00] discouragement and and there's just so
[25:02] much I'd like to be able to share and I
[25:04] I have to just try to stay very
[25:06] disciplined that I I just don't kind of
[25:08] go here and go there because I want to
[25:10] express this the right
[25:11] way and and if you can relate and you
[25:13] can identify with this and and by all
[25:16] means nod
[25:18] aggressively if when when we find
[25:21] ourselves fighting when we're fighting
[25:23] and we're struggling and we're wrestling
[25:26] we're not all grins
[25:28] it's more of a
[25:30] Grimace and and we and I don't know that
[25:32] we that I don't know if any of us have
[25:33] ever answered when somewell how are you
[25:35] doing brother John it's like hey man I'm
[25:37] fighting woo right we just it's like oh
[25:41] man I'm really going through it I'm just
[25:42] really fighting the devil's just really
[25:43] working me over and we kind of have a
[25:45] way that we talk about it and the Very
[25:47] fact that we're fighting the very fact
[25:49] that they're Waring just the fact that
[25:50] there's a fight discourages us has
[25:53] nothing to do whether or not you're
[25:54] winning or what it's about it's just
[25:56] it's a fight and since it's a fight I'm
[25:58] discouraged and you find yourself
[26:01] becoming uh you know more Melancholy or
[26:04] or unmotivated because it's fighting or
[26:06] you find your faith slipping a little
[26:08] bit uh because you're actually fighting
[26:11] and this is a phrase that I've heard
[26:12] lately the devil is attacking my mind
[26:15] and different ones expressing this
[26:17] battle that they're in and things that
[26:18] they're going through and I'm not going
[26:21] to let the devil hide behind well you
[26:22] know about it so you shouldn't preach
[26:24] about it
[26:28] I certainly don't want to touch anything
[26:29] through my own Humanity my own opinion
[26:31] and my own emotions but a man of God
[26:33] studies and he prays and he sees the
[26:35] spots where the people are and he
[26:37] recognizes an attack and he says you
[26:38] know what devil we're going to shut you
[26:40] down we're just going to go ahead and
[26:42] address it and so the devil is say well
[26:45] the devil is attacking my mind and when
[26:47] we say that and it's and the reality is
[26:49] there's a Warfare taking place in the
[26:51] mind but there's a way that we view this
[26:53] Warfare and this battle where we're made
[26:55] to feel
[26:56] defensive like I'm being picked on I'm
[26:59] being poked I'm being prodded we're made
[27:00] to feel vulnerable like where did this
[27:02] come from I mean everything seem to be
[27:04] going well and all of a sudden I have
[27:05] this thought and this happens and that
[27:07] happens and we're made to feel weak
[27:09] because we find ourselves finding or at
[27:11] worst we're made to feel
[27:13] wrong well I must something must be
[27:15] wrong because I'm fighting something
[27:17] must be wrong because this is happening
[27:18] something must be wrong because this is
[27:20] taking place a a and with if you think
[27:23] I'm disqualifying that let me just say
[27:26] you need to be honest with your life if
[27:27] you're in a battle because you've
[27:29] wandered from the Wall come back to the
[27:33] wall we could certainly go into great
[27:35] depth in this but when Nehemiah and they
[27:37] were restoring the temple walls in the
[27:39] book of Nehemiah and they're restoring
[27:40] the temple they were hard at work and
[27:42] they were working and they had this uh
[27:44] this plan that whenever you hear the
[27:46] trumpet you you work with a hammer in
[27:48] one hand a sword in the other when you
[27:50] hear the trumpet fire on one side of the
[27:51] wall let's all run together and fight
[27:53] along the wall but then there was a
[27:56] letter that came and said hey you know
[27:58] why don't you meet meet me in the valley
[27:59] of
[28:01] Ono and they wanted Nehemiah to come
[28:04] down and meet in the valley and get him
[28:07] away from the wall and if you leave the
[28:10] work along the wall and you're fighting
[28:12] in the valley that's a battle you
[28:13] shouldn't be in and you're fighting now
[28:16] as like a reminder a red flag as a
[28:18] buffer as God saying stop you're in the
[28:21] wrong place get back along the wall some
[28:23] of us can be fighting because we haven't
[28:25] been obedient to the leadership of the
[28:27] Holy Spirit we know we're not where we
[28:28] need to be our family's not where it
[28:30] needs to be I'm not doing the things
[28:31] that I know a Believer ought to do and
[28:33] the Warfare is directly resulted with
[28:35] you leaving your position along the wall
[28:38] and you got to get back on the wall
[28:40] because if there's a battle along the
[28:41] wall there's a trumpet that sounds and
[28:44] there's support that comes to help you
[28:46] you're in the valley you're all on your
[28:50] own but the problem the way what I'm
[28:53] looking at is how that this battle the
[28:55] devil is attacking me how we're made to
[28:56] feel wrong but when we look at say I'm
[28:59] right where I believe the Lord wants me
[29:01] to be I'm doing what God wants me to be
[29:03] so what I'm suggesting today is a
[29:05] different
[29:08] perspective let's invert
[29:11] this this is this is a difficult trial
[29:14] this is a this is something we don't
[29:15] understand this is things that very
[29:16] Troublesome to our Spirits all right
[29:18] this is a hard problem let's
[29:25] invert let me say start by saying this
[29:28] you're not the
[29:30] victim when we look at it from the
[29:32] perspective the devil's attacking me you
[29:34] feel as if you've been assaulted you've
[29:35] been jumped and you've been sucker
[29:37] punched and you're the victim and the
[29:38] devil's given you put you you know kind
[29:40] of got you on the chin so you're made to
[29:42] feel like you're the victim you're not
[29:43] the
[29:45] victim we are not the ones being
[29:50] attacked this is where we mentioned just
[29:52] briefly Wednesday
[29:54] night and I want you to hold this phrase
[29:56] this is just kept coming to me over and
[29:57] over over and over again as I studied
[29:59] last week the word is the aggressor in
[30:03] this
[30:04] war oh the devil's attacking me I'm
[30:07] fighting I'm really going through it the
[30:08] word is the aggressor in this war in
[30:11] Acts chapter 17 is talking about how
[30:13] Paul uh came to thessalonica and he goes
[30:15] to the synagogue of the Jews he begins
[30:17] to teach about Christ that Christ
[30:18] suffered and that this Jesus is Christ
[30:22] and there's many that believed of the of
[30:24] the Greeks and chief women and then the
[30:26] Jews who didn't believe that they begin
[30:28] to look at what's happening they get all
[30:29] upset and they're and they growl
[30:31] everyone up against them and you think
[30:33] well Paul comes preaching and now
[30:35] they're being going to be persecuted and
[30:37] Jason's going to be brought out and
[30:38] they're going to be he's going to be
[30:39] scourged and they're going to be called
[30:41] out and going to be threatened with
[30:42] punishment but this is what they're
[30:43] saying hey these that have turned the
[30:46] world upside down have come
[30:49] hither Paul wasn't the
[30:51] hunted Jason wasn't the persecuted I
[30:54] want you to just kind of take this to
[30:56] really what how this should look look in
[30:58] your minds in this instance Paul was the
[31:01] aggressor Paul had brought the battle to
[31:03] thessalonica this whole thing is taking
[31:05] place because something's being stirred
[31:07] up and the way that they described Jason
[31:10] and all those that came with them is
[31:11] they turned the world upside
[31:16] down these have taken the order of
[31:18] things and completely rearranged them
[31:20] they have taken what we thought to be
[31:22] true what we thought to be right what we
[31:24] thought to be the proper order they have
[31:26] turned the world upside down what was
[31:30] taking place this was an
[31:32] inversion it was an invasion not of
[31:35] these Jews and let's just say it the way
[31:38] that Luke said it lewd fellows of the
[31:40] baser
[31:42] sort why were their lewd fellows of the
[31:45] baser sort even showing up because the
[31:47] word had come
[31:48] up the Jews would have never consorted
[31:51] with the the lewd fellows of A baser
[31:54] Sort if Paul hadn't showed up
[31:58] everything would just be fine everything
[32:00] would be normal everyone would be in
[32:01] their place but one day the word shows
[32:03] up in
[32:04] thessalonica the word begins to have the
[32:06] preeminence the word starts to be get
[32:08] lift up lies start to be torn down and
[32:10] Paul begins to preach the truth and now
[32:12] what happens hey go get the LW fellas of
[32:14] a baser swort we've got
[32:17] problems and it's then that the lud
[32:19] fellas of A baser Sort show up they said
[32:23] call The Brute Squad it's like I am the
[32:24] brute Squad right they're all showing up
[32:27] now now that now they're here now
[32:29] they're going to start causing problems
[32:30] why because their world had been turned
[32:32] upside
[32:33] down Paul wasn't hid away in the
[32:35] mountain somewhere Jason wasn't just
[32:37] minding in his own business doing what
[32:39] he wanted to do and keeping his head
[32:41] down no the word was the one that was
[32:43] causing the offense the word was the one
[32:46] that that was the aggressor and so when
[32:49] we look at this inverting this difficult
[32:51] problem these mind battles the things
[32:52] that we're going through Satan's attack
[32:54] may be him fighting
[32:56] back the the devil's bombarding my mind
[32:59] the the devil's attacking me maybe he's
[33:01] been attacked and now he's defending
[33:04] against the advancement of the word if
[33:07] you just would have left well Al alone
[33:09] and just left it alone if you just would
[33:11] have kept doing what you were doing if
[33:12] you wouldn't have red things up if you
[33:14] wouldn't have got more dedicated if you
[33:16] wouldn't had made a decision to serve
[33:17] God if you wouldn't have said Lord I
[33:19] know there's more for me and I want it
[33:21] if you hadn't made that difficult
[33:22] decision to stand for truth and make a
[33:24] decision in your family if you just
[33:26] would have kept your mouth shut and your
[33:28] feet still this never would have
[33:30] happened but something has moved forward
[33:33] in your life and now Satan is all of a
[33:35] sudden put on the
[33:38] defensive think about it that way oh the
[33:40] devil's attacking me the devil's
[33:42] attacking me no you're attacking the
[33:44] devil and you didn't realize it oh God
[33:47] the great Marinette he's got your dukes
[33:49] up and he's just moving you and he's
[33:51] causing you to give punches to the devil
[33:53] and you thought it was the devil who
[33:55] started the fight
[34:02] the greatest battle ever fought Bill
[34:04] Bram uses this principle goes how did
[34:06] Grant take
[34:09] Richmond there's a phrase like Grant
[34:12] took Richmond anyone ever heard that
[34:14] phrase you actually have okay great
[34:16] because I think that's kind of what
[34:18] brother Brandon was borrowing from I
[34:21] know we've had uh different Wars since
[34:23] then so we're not always just talking
[34:24] about Grant taking
[34:26] Richmond but it's when Grant took
[34:28] Richmond says like Grant took Richmond
[34:29] you'd say well he just came through here
[34:31] like Grant took Richmond think something
[34:32] decidedly determination
[34:34] quickly and so how did Grant take
[34:37] Richmond but this is this is the part I
[34:39] think is so beautiful just as he come to
[34:42] it Grant took Richmond Richmond didn't
[34:45] come to
[34:47] grant grant came to Richmond so in the
[34:50] greatest battle ever fought we're just
[34:51] not kind of sitting here you brother Aon
[34:53] I was just believing the word and just
[34:55] hanging out you know just chilling a
[34:57] villain and everything was great and
[34:59] everything was wonderful and I thought
[35:02] this was smooth and and then I'll boom
[35:04] all of a sudden I'm attacked now in your
[35:08] heart in your life you've come to
[35:11] Richmond said how did he take
[35:13] Richmond just as he come to it that's
[35:17] how God's soldiers
[35:20] take sin
[35:23] sickness and add whatever else you want
[35:25] to it Melancholy depression
[35:29] anxiety pressure financial troubles if
[35:32] you're going to conquer it it's going to
[35:34] be because you come to its door
[35:36] step we could spend a lot of Our Lives
[35:39] defending ourselves and fending off
[35:40] blows and we and oh I escaped this and
[35:42] oh I escaped that but there comes a
[35:44] point in a believer's life where you're
[35:47] no longer hiding and defending attacks
[35:49] but you go on the
[35:51] offensive there's definitely times in
[35:53] our lives when we're being under attack
[35:55] and there's things that we can say and
[35:56] do that put us on on the defensive I'm
[35:58] looking at a diff a difficult situation
[36:01] a problem a a wrestling that you're
[36:02] engaging in how that now it's not a
[36:05] matter of the battle coming to you but
[36:06] you've taken the battle yourself and
[36:08] you've Advanced to a particular position
[36:10] in this Warfare he says just as he come
[36:13] to it that's the way God's soldiers take
[36:15] sin sickness just as they come to it
[36:18] you're not sitting back waiting for
[36:20] sickness to come to you somehow in your
[36:22] life God has walked you to this not so
[36:26] that it would def deat you but so that
[36:28] you could defeat
[36:30] it just as they come to it that's the
[36:32] way they overcome their doubts that's
[36:34] the way they overcome their fears that's
[36:37] the way they overcome things how are you
[36:40] going to overcome things not by hiding
[36:42] out somewhere in an easy chair and they
[36:44] kind of show up and pester you and call
[36:46] your name and and chide you and spy on
[36:49] you and do these sneak attacks no you
[36:51] overcome it when you walk up to your
[36:54] doubt and you begin to defeat your doubt
[36:56] you overcome when you walk up to your
[36:59] fears and defeat your fears you overcome
[37:02] things as you come to
[37:04] things oh this fear is bother me this
[37:07] doubt has bothering me you picked to
[37:08] fight with
[37:10] fear or God
[37:13] did just like God did with job hey satan
[37:17] have you considered
[37:19] job did you hear what job said I had to
[37:21] say about you oh yeah he said he in yeah
[37:23] he said he could beat you up he said you
[37:26] could do whatever you want to him and he
[37:27] won't curse curse me and die oh is that
[37:28] what he said yeah you should I mean you
[37:29] going to let him do talk to you like
[37:31] that huh you going to let him do you
[37:33] like
[37:34] that and God's the one that set it
[37:38] up why was job attacked not because he
[37:40] was a
[37:41] sinner that's what all his friends
[37:43] wanted to tell
[37:44] them but because there was none like
[37:48] him
[37:53] invert just as they come to it they
[37:56] overcome doubts fears years and things
[37:58] when one Rises they chop them down move
[38:01] out of the
[38:03] way there's a there's a path forward
[38:05] something is moving
[38:07] forward and I was thinking about this
[38:09] last week no just kind of got me all
[38:10] stirred up we we love the Civil War as a
[38:12] family we've visited a lot of don't like
[38:15] we love war we love the history of the
[38:17] Civil War man we just really can't wait
[38:19] for another
[38:24] one we we love the history of the Civil
[38:26] War and the Civil War
[38:28] and in the capture of Richmond we think
[38:31] well how did Grant take
[38:34] Richmond they say well that that like
[38:36] Grant took Richmond and even some
[38:37] historians and different people kind of
[38:38] wrestle with the fact that how long it
[38:40] took for Richmond for them to get to
[38:42] Richmond and they think out this
[38:43] protracted battle and how late in the
[38:45] battle it was in 1965 before they
[38:47] finally overtook Richmond but the fall
[38:50] of Richmond was preceded by the siege of
[38:53] Petersburg and and I just want to use
[38:55] this historical Point hopefully it kind
[38:56] of light fire uh for some of you for
[38:59] nearly 300 days I it was 292 days at
[39:03] least that the two armies were
[39:06] entrenched from June 15th 1864 to April
[39:10] 2nd 1865 almost a year nearly a year
[39:14] both sides had been
[39:17] entrenched and so during this time the
[39:19] armies were entrenched over 40 miles my
[39:23] they dug in their
[39:24] positions the Confederates had their
[39:26] line the had their line and they just
[39:28] had these skirmishes so over 10 for over
[39:31] a period of 10 months nearly 70,000
[39:34] soldiers spread out over 40 miles would
[39:36] just kind of do these little attacks and
[39:38] these little skirmishes and these
[39:39] attempts to flank but each one held
[39:41] their ground and held their position and
[39:43] for near nearly 10 months they built one
[39:44] of the most sophisticated systems of
[39:46] Earth Works ever seen in battle to even
[39:49] when it came time for the Great War they
[39:51] didn't call it World War I when the
[39:52] first started they didn't have the
[39:54] premonition well this is just the first
[39:55] of two
[39:57] World War I of two like how did you know
[40:00] that kind of like the coin don't ever
[40:01] buy a coin that's dated 400
[40:05] BC just a pro tip for coin collectors
[40:09] they didn't know there was going to be a
[40:10] second one so they called it the Great
[40:11] War they actually established what was
[40:13] called camp Lee in this area to teach
[40:17] soldiers here in the 19 1900s teach them
[40:20] how to build bullworks and Earthworks
[40:21] and to create trenches because this was
[40:23] something very sophisticated and new in
[40:25] Warfare and it wasn't just go meet over
[40:28] here in battle and meet over there in
[40:29] battle now was taking these
[40:31] entrenchments and establishing
[40:33] themselves in strongholds and say this
[40:35] is the ground that we possess we're
[40:36] going to dig in here this is ours we're
[40:38] going to defend Petersburg we're going
[40:40] to set up this line this is where it's
[40:42] going to this is where it's going to
[40:43] happen and it's this long drawn out
[40:45] protracted Warfare Skirmish here
[40:48] Skirmish there attack here attack
[40:50] there but finally after 10 months St
[40:53] Petersburg was surrendered at dawn on
[40:54] April
[40:56] 3rd at Dawn on April 3rd Petersburg
[40:59] Falls nearly 300 days 70,000 men over 40
[41:04] miles through 10 months fight and it's
[41:06] this entrenchment and this is their
[41:07] fortifications this is where they stand
[41:10] but in the dawn of April 3rd Petersburg
[41:12] Falls and by that night Richmond
[41:15] fell man I don't is lot about got a lot
[41:18] of rebels here I thought I might get a
[41:20] bless God or you know thank God for the
[41:23] union and
[41:26] right there let me make the spiritual
[41:28] application to get some amens think
[41:30] about it there was a long Siege where
[41:33] there was an
[41:35] entrenchment and it took a long time and
[41:37] there's different skirmishes but once
[41:39] that finally
[41:40] broke and it was uprooted from the
[41:43] stronghold that evening Grant Advanced
[41:47] to
[41:48] Richmond didn't take him days that the
[41:50] SE they the lines didn't crumble and
[41:53] then Grant they're all toasting each
[41:54] other this is great this is wonderful we
[41:56] got them out there and trenches no it
[41:58] was time to move
[42:00] forward and the next Target was Richmond
[42:03] so once the siege of Petersburg was over
[42:06] and the the rebels had surrendered it
[42:08] and they vacated their positions they
[42:10] weren't just happy oh they're gone
[42:11] they're out of their fox holes they're
[42:13] out of their trenches like no let's
[42:15] advance to Richmond so how did Grant
[42:17] take Richmond as soon as he came to
[42:20] it and that night Richmond
[42:23] fell why because there had been a
[42:25] stronghold that had been Tor down
[42:29] so it's time to go
[42:32] forward in the greatest battle ever
[42:34] fought brother R says take the word of
[42:37] God and cut your way through every
[42:41] doubt we're not laying around just
[42:43] trying to defend ourselves no you're cut
[42:45] your way
[42:46] through you got your eyes on something
[42:49] you're moving sure that's it I love the
[42:51] way he says it that's the next job let's
[42:54] get it
[42:55] done after this Siege of Petersburg the
[42:58] next job was Richmond this is the idea
[43:01] this is the example that the analogy
[43:02] brother brah is using for the believer
[43:04] that once you why is there a battle in
[43:06] Richmond why is there a fight in
[43:08] Richmond because you've come to
[43:10] it and you take it as you come to it so
[43:13] whatever battle you're in right now as a
[43:15] Believer who who's want serving God and
[43:17] doing all you can to serve him and
[43:19] you've turned over every Rock and you're
[43:21] you're trying to find what's wrong and
[43:23] you're wanting to do the things that are
[43:24] right before God but you find yourself
[43:26] being bombarded whatever the wherever
[43:28] the bombardment is coming from that's
[43:30] your next job let's get it
[43:34] done next thing I'm to do is get away
[43:36] from my doubts cut it down that's my
[43:39] next job is get all my frustrations
[43:42] away it just it's I mean notice the
[43:45] grace in this well brother Aaron I
[43:46] finally overcome doubt now I'm
[43:48] frustrated all the time you haven't gone
[43:50] backwards you've gone
[43:52] forwards so while I was struggling with
[43:54] doubt and now now that I've resolved my
[43:56] doubt and I've got faith now I'm dealing
[43:57] with frustration the only reason why
[43:59] you're able to deal with frustration is
[44:00] because you got doubt out of the
[44:03] way right I mean this isn't uh a video
[44:06] game where you're trying to get to the
[44:07] final boss and defeat him but in some
[44:10] ways if you trying to figure out what's
[44:12] going on here you've just defeated level
[44:14] one you're level two now it's not ah I
[44:17] thought that was the end of the game no
[44:18] you've you've
[44:20] graduated you matriculate to another
[44:22] battle another now that you have faith
[44:24] and you got doubt out of the way now you
[44:25] can really deal with frustration
[44:28] if you defeat frustration and you still
[44:30] have doubt you're just going to get
[44:31] frustrated again so he's walking you
[44:33] through these steps and these
[44:34] progressions of battles you got to get
[44:36] this done your doubts that's my next job
[44:38] frustration if all my senses tell me
[44:40] Well you feel bad now that you got dealt
[44:42] dealt with doubt dealt with and you got
[44:44] frustration dealt with now your
[44:46] senses well yeah my senses feel bad the
[44:48] next thing to do is cut that thing away
[44:51] that's right you say you know my
[44:52] conscience tells me brother brand I'm
[44:54] that well you might as well cut this
[44:55] thing away that thing away you ain't
[44:57] going to get no further than
[45:01] that this is the next
[45:04] job just get your next job
[45:07] done he says take off your coat and Bear
[45:11] right into it just keep on going one
[45:15] objective I'm going to win I can't lose
[45:19] I'm going to
[45:21] win we know that that we say that well
[45:24] the it's on the battlefield that a
[45:25] victory is decided Well
[45:27] okay but we know who wins I wish Brother
[45:30] Andy was here right brother Andy you've
[45:32] read the back of the book right we
[45:35] win we know how this story ends we know
[45:38] that in the end we're going to win so
[45:40] there should never be any doubt as to
[45:42] the
[45:43] outcome the way my wife Elizabeth and I
[45:46] were fellowshipping on this and what I
[45:48] thought of that that uh made some sense
[45:51] to me is we think about these little
[45:53] skirmishes and these little battles and
[45:54] the devil thinks oh you know look what
[45:55] we did we kind of got you to do this we
[45:57] got you do that it reminded me of the
[45:59] you know the last two battles of the
[46:01] Civil War were won by the
[46:04] rebels and there were battles in
[46:07] Texas by a bunch of guys who didn't know
[46:09] the war was
[46:10] over and they had these battles and it's
[46:13] like hey did you not know we already
[46:15] won so what you got my flag oh you got
[46:18] my Cannon oohoo big deal it didn't
[46:21] matter anymore they had already won the
[46:23] war it was already decided it was a
[46:25] defeated enemy that was just trying to
[46:27] have bragging rights over something the
[46:28] devil it don't matter no more it doesn't
[46:31] matter to me the war is already won so
[46:33] we can have this kind of attitude when
[46:35] it comes to conflict and confrontation
[46:37] and when there's a battle that's taking
[46:38] place there it's never in doubt I'm
[46:41] going to win I can't lose I'm going to
[46:46] win and if this is what is in the way
[46:49] now in front of me then this is what's
[46:51] going to have to
[46:53] fall and the story that brother bam is
[46:55] building off of is the story of uh
[46:57] cartright Peter
[46:59] cartright he went into town to have a
[47:02] Revival and there he's in there washing
[47:05] the windows and setting up chairs and I
[47:07] think the story's told that he was up on
[47:08] a ladder washing
[47:10] windows and he's washing the windows the
[47:12] town bully shows
[47:15] up and he gets down at the base of the
[47:17] ladder and he pulls his coat back so he
[47:19] can see the gun he says yeah I hear
[47:20] you're having a
[47:22] Revival and you know what brother
[47:24] cartright did
[47:27] tell you what he didn't do he didn't
[47:30] take the
[47:32] sponge and put it down and climb down
[47:34] off the ladder and have a conversation
[47:37] he just kept washing
[47:39] windows why he's supposed to have
[47:41] Revival and he had to get the place
[47:43] ready for it so he didn't stop he just
[47:45] kept washing windows yeah I hear you're
[47:48] going to have Revival pulls a gun back
[47:49] and he's like yep mhm what God called me
[47:51] to do he goes well you're not going to
[47:53] have a Revival around here oh really
[47:58] he knew what God called him to do he
[47:59] just kept working so finally the bully's
[48:02] like you know what if you're going to
[48:03] have to have if you're going to have a
[48:04] Revival then you have to go through me
[48:07] first and Peter's like oh so that's my
[48:10] next
[48:12] job it's exactly what he did he's like
[48:15] oh well then that's my next job and he
[48:17] put the sponge down the rag down
[48:19] whatever is he climbed down the ladder
[48:21] took his coat off and said I must fight
[48:23] if I must reain increase my courage Lord
[48:26] and beat the car out of the bully why
[48:28] the bully stood in the way of his
[48:30] Revival and there was a bully standing
[48:33] there taunting him saying he was going
[48:35] to keep him from his Revival Peter
[48:36] wasn't walking down the road and got
[48:38] picked on he was in the line of duty and
[48:41] the fight came to him why was the bully
[48:44] brandishing a weapon inside of that
[48:46] place that day because he was in the
[48:48] line of duty doing what God wanted him
[48:50] to do and the devil didn't like it so
[48:53] there was a brawl and there was a fight
[48:55] and he put it down took his cut off beat
[48:57] the tar out of that guy and the bully
[48:59] came that night and got
[49:01] saved brother B says this is how we
[49:03] ought to look at it you've got a job to
[49:05] do keep doing what you're supposed to do
[49:07] if something comes up in the way of you
[49:08] doing it then that's your next job cut
[49:11] it down get it out of the way conquer
[49:14] it and just keep going on why because
[49:17] I'm going to
[49:18] win I can't lose I'm going to
[49:21] win let me say this is a different way
[49:23] of viewing the greatest battle ever
[49:25] fought
[49:30] it's just not the a
[49:31] battle in the
[49:34] mind he said the greatest battle ever
[49:36] fought the chosen The Chosen ground is
[49:39] in the mind that's the Battle Ground
[49:41] that's the Battlefront it rages in the
[49:43] mind but so that we can think about this
[49:47] differently it's not it's not I wouldn't
[49:50] even say it's a battle in the mind it's
[49:53] a battle for the mind
[49:57] that's why there's a battle there did
[49:59] Satan just choose the mind because it
[50:01] was
[50:03] inconsequential did Satan choose the
[50:05] mind because he thought well this
[50:06] doesn't really matter and if I as long
[50:08] as I have the mind I can just do my
[50:10] tricks and play my
[50:11] games we know God chose the
[50:14] heart
[50:17] first and the devil chose the Mind
[50:21] next and the battle is in the mind but
[50:24] it's a battle for the mind
[50:27] therefore we realize the battle is not
[50:29] without a
[50:30] purpose there has to be a battle
[50:35] there we know that we have something to
[50:38] overcome and in overcoming it it's for a
[50:41] reason says in Genesis 22:1 17 about
[50:44] Abraham and his seed after him that they
[50:47] thy seed shall possess the gates the
[50:50] Gate of his
[50:52] enemies and it's referred to in other
[50:54] places as the gates of his enemies
[50:57] this is the promise to Abraham's seed
[50:59] they will possess the Gate of his
[51:02] enemies you are Abraham's Royal seed
[51:05] therefore you are under a prophecy you
[51:07] are under a commandment you are under an
[51:09] order that you are to possess the Gate
[51:12] of your enemies and then this is a an
[51:16] order that is so expansive to where God
[51:19] is not not God is Not merely just saying
[51:21] he's going to save your soul and change
[51:23] your body but you are going to possess
[51:26] your completely and you're going to
[51:28] bring mind body and spirit under
[51:31] subjection to the word of God so that
[51:33] there's not just one dimensional
[51:35] Deliverance but there's a
[51:36] three-dimensional Deliverance to the
[51:38] fullest extent of the word why because
[51:40] God has not only purchased your soul and
[51:43] will one day change your body but he's
[51:45] going to redeem this Spirit into
[51:48] Perfection this mind must be possessed
[51:52] if we are taught that the greatest enemy
[51:53] is ourselves then your Gates of seeing
[51:56] taste feel smell here and touch all
[51:58] those senses those five gates of the
[52:00] spirit they must be uh conquered the
[52:04] imagination conscience memory reason and
[52:06] affection they these Gates these
[52:09] channels must be
[52:13] possessed says in Genesis chter 49: 19
[52:16] this is Jacob Israel's prophecy of each
[52:19] one of these Sons he says Gad a troop
[52:22] shall overcome him Gad was called a
[52:25] warrior tribe
[52:27] it says he's going to be
[52:31] overcome gathers a bunch of Warriors
[52:33] they they like to fight they're going to
[52:34] be overcome but notice the next part but
[52:36] he shall overcome at the
[52:38] last I love it the enemy may come and
[52:43] take the enemy May advance and possess
[52:46] certain grounds and build certain Gates
[52:48] and certain bullworks and do certain
[52:49] things but we'll overcome at
[52:52] last this was a prophecy that God would
[52:55] be Warriors and at times they would be
[52:57] conquered But ultimately they would be
[52:59] victorious they may seem to be defeated
[53:01] they may lose some battles but it says
[53:03] but he shall overcome at last whatever
[53:06] has been taken away will be restored and
[53:08] Paul borrows on the same thought in
[53:10] Romans 8:37 nay and all these things we
[53:13] are more than conquerors said of God He
[53:16] Shall Overcome ultimately be victorious
[53:18] exceed victoriously he shall overcome at
[53:21] last Paul says we are more than
[53:23] Overcomers we are more than conquerors
[53:25] through him that loved us
[53:27] in all these things what were the things
[53:28] he was talking about tribulation
[53:30] distress persecution famine nakedness
[53:32] Peril sword but ultimately we gain
[53:35] surpassing
[53:37] Victory ultimately we are more than
[53:40] conquerors said it's a surpassing
[53:44] victory what how is it that we overcome
[53:46] what this is we're looking at this I
[53:48] want you to look about look at this
[53:49] differently than traditionally how we
[53:52] express the battle and the Warfare is oh
[53:55] I'm being attacked oh I'm really going
[53:56] through
[53:57] it no something else is
[54:00] happening it's not just a wasteland
[54:02] where skirmishes are taking place but
[54:05] God wants your
[54:10] mind was talking about the the actual
[54:13] mechanics of this and greatest battle
[54:15] ever thought he says you had to open
[54:16] that channel the Channel first so there
[54:17] has to be an opening up an allowing but
[54:20] this is part I want to focus on you've
[54:21] got to get the the soldier the Holy
[54:24] Spirit placed at the Battlefront
[54:28] so the battle is not you in your mind
[54:31] with the
[54:32] devil as we think about the greatest
[54:35] battle ever fought if we just think it's
[54:36] a mind battle with Satan that would be
[54:40] discouraging but and I want to choose my
[54:42] words carefully because I'm I'm
[54:44] certainly not suggesting that we're
[54:45] Spectators but in one sense there's a
[54:48] fight taking place because the soldiers
[54:51] there the Holy Spirit just admit it
[54:54] before you didn't have much of a fight
[54:57] right before he got there you just kind
[54:58] of gave in oh you really want me to do
[54:59] that
[55:01] okay you really want me to doubt okay
[55:03] I'll
[55:04] doubt but now you have a soldier there
[55:06] that's what had to happen you open up
[55:08] the channel you've got the soldier
[55:10] placed at the Battlefront that takes
[55:11] God's word he is the word and he stands
[55:15] there there's nothing going to stop it
[55:17] then there's
[55:18] nothing why is there a war because of
[55:21] the presence of the
[55:23] warrior why is there a fight because the
[55:25] presence of the fighter why is there a
[55:28] battle because of the one that leads the
[55:30] battle if there was not one on the
[55:32] battlefield it wouldn't even be called
[55:33] to fight it wouldn't even be fair
[55:35] because you're not a match at all but
[55:37] through Christ you're more than a match
[55:39] for the devil why because through
[55:42] him the word is our Warrior he's the
[55:46] soldier the soldier he's the combatant
[55:48] he's the one that wages War he's the one
[55:51] that says follow me we got
[55:53] thisam in the story greatest battle ever
[55:55] fought talks about how the
[55:56] Jeffersonville fire department and the
[55:58] Albany fire department there was a big
[56:00] huge Raging Fire and he said there was a
[56:02] captain saying shoot a little fire water
[56:04] there phw put a little fire water there
[56:06] phw and you had these little guys there
[56:08] kind of just telling them how to put out
[56:09] a fire but then the captain from
[56:11] Louisville showed
[56:13] up and and what did the captain from
[56:15] Louisville do he didn't tell the men
[56:17] fight there and fight here and put water
[56:19] there he grab took his ax and said come
[56:21] on boys follow me and he went to the
[56:24] fire to put the fire out he ran to it he
[56:26] says that's our
[56:28] captain if there's a fight it's not
[56:30] because you're over there put a little
[56:31] water here and a little water there
[56:33] trying to put our fires we spin our
[56:34] whole lives bubble dancing and putting
[56:36] out fires and now there's a battle why
[56:38] because Christ said follow me and now
[56:41] you begin to follow and obedience do
[56:42] what the word requires you to do things
[56:44] start changing things start moving God
[56:46] starts doing Supernatural things and all
[56:48] of a sudden you're in the greatest
[56:50] battle ever fire not because you're
[56:51] laying around but because you're moving
[56:53] forward
[56:57] the word is the one that wages the war
[57:00] the Bible says in Exodus chapter
[57:02] 15 verse three the Lord is a man of
[57:08] war this is how he's described this is
[57:10] part of his essential
[57:12] characteristics I if he saved us and
[57:14] then we just put on the sidelines and
[57:16] everything was just easy and we just
[57:18] begin to Bubble dance and have a picnic
[57:19] then Jehovah would be over there just
[57:21] itching for a
[57:24] fight oh I want to fight so
[57:27] bad how is he going to fight unless it's
[57:29] your feet unless it's your hands unless
[57:32] it's your mind he is a man of war he
[57:35] wants to go to battle he he wants to
[57:37] roll up his sleeves he wants to fight he
[57:39] says the Lord is a man of war Jehovah is
[57:41] a hero of the battle in battle he always
[57:44] overcomes God wants a fight and the only
[57:47] way he can fight is through
[57:51] you Isaiah 42:13 the Lord shall go forth
[57:54] as a Mighty Man he shall stir up
[57:57] jealousy like a man of war why are these
[58:00] things happening we're talking about
[58:01] invert always invert think about this
[58:03] greatest battle ever fought think about
[58:05] what you've been going through and how
[58:06] bowed down you felt and how discouraged
[58:08] you felt and how you felt things were
[58:10] turning you I thought things were really
[58:12] good you know what they're better than
[58:13] you thought they
[58:14] were Hallelujah they're better than that
[58:17] you thought they were because now
[58:18] there's things happening that you didn't
[58:20] even know needed to
[58:23] happen next time someone says how it's
[58:25] going say better than I thought it was
[58:28] well how do you know man I'm in a fight
[58:30] I'm in a fight it's like the Civil War
[58:33] up in
[58:34] here you're all excited like this guy's
[58:40] crazy the Lord shall go forth as a
[58:42] mighty man he shall stirp jealousy like
[58:44] a man of war he shall cry y Roar he
[58:47] shall Prevail against his enemies who is
[58:51] it that's fighting the battle all the
[58:53] devil's attacking me turn it around the
[58:55] devil is being attacked and he's angry
[58:57] he's mad and he's brought you up as he
[59:00] did Jason this guy is turning the world
[59:02] upside down what are we going to do with
[59:06] him 1st Samuel 17:47 and all this
[59:09] assembly shall know that the Lord sath
[59:11] not with sword and Spear and other words
[59:13] it's not through the man for the battle
[59:15] is the
[59:16] Lord's he will give you into our
[59:20] hands that's exactly how David felt it's
[59:23] not going to be through Talent not
[59:25] through training
[59:28] but this is God's
[59:30] battle this is God's battle and I know
[59:33] I'm going to
[59:34] win I can't
[59:37] lose how do you know you see who I'm
[59:41] with you think you're fighting me a
[59:45] little Ruddy 13-year-old boy you think
[59:46] that you think you're fighting me you
[59:48] think you you said send me a
[59:51] man and you think what you got was a boy
[59:55] my Lord is a man of war and you may see
[59:59] me with a sling and five stones and you
[1:00:01] may stand there with a shield and a
[1:00:03] sword and a spear but I'm coming in the
[1:00:05] name of the Lord and this battle is the
[1:00:08] Lord's in other words the events of War
[1:00:10] Are Holy in God's power it's under his
[1:00:13] Direction it is the Lord's war and I'm
[1:00:16] here fighting alongside My Savior I'm
[1:00:19] right here with the chief Warrior and
[1:00:21] the chief captain and he can't lose
[1:00:23] therefore I can't lose
[1:00:27] listen if you want to set up some sort
[1:00:28] of prop bet or side war and do something
[1:00:30] off on the sidelines you're probably
[1:00:31] going to get it whipped a little bit but
[1:00:32] stay close to his side the battles the
[1:00:35] Lords in Exodus chap 14: 13-
[1:00:40] 15 here they come up against the Red
[1:00:43] Sea people all worried all nervous all
[1:00:47] fearful um if you could just think about
[1:00:49] it for a
[1:00:50] moment that and I know it may seem just
[1:00:53] to be
[1:00:54] logic but they come up against the Red
[1:00:58] Sea and it's as if collectively they're
[1:01:00] all
[1:01:01] like God isn't God is
[1:01:05] ignorant and wasted his time through all
[1:01:08] the
[1:01:09] plagues through everything he done and
[1:01:11] all the Vindication and everything he
[1:01:13] brought them through he's bringing them
[1:01:15] out by a mighty hand finally their
[1:01:16] prayers are being answered they prayed
[1:01:18] for this for decades they prayed for it
[1:01:19] for hundreds of years as a people this
[1:01:21] is something they always wanted
[1:01:22] something they always look forward to
[1:01:24] they finally have it and now all of a
[1:01:25] sudden a little bit of trouble arises
[1:01:26] it's almost like those 10 plagues that
[1:01:28] meant nothing that was so
[1:01:30] yesterday and they're all worried and
[1:01:32] fretful but had they just stood there
[1:01:34] and said all right this doesn't look
[1:01:36] good doesn't look good at
[1:01:39] all so what's going to happen here how
[1:01:42] are we going to get out of this because
[1:01:44] God's got to get us out of this because
[1:01:47] when he brought the 10 plagues upon
[1:01:48] Egypt and finally hardened the heart of
[1:01:50] pharaoh and called us to eat because we
[1:01:52] were going to be leaving and he would
[1:01:54] bring us he said he would bring us into
[1:01:55] the land I know this is not the land so
[1:01:58] we have a Red Sea in front of us we have
[1:02:00] an enemy behind us I may not be able to
[1:02:03] figure this out in my mind how it's
[1:02:05] going to happen but this is a difficult
[1:02:07] situation so I'm going to
[1:02:10] invert I know he's going to put me in
[1:02:13] the promised land so I know neither Red
[1:02:15] Sea nor Pharaoh's Army is going to keep
[1:02:17] me from it so God's got to deal with one
[1:02:20] or the other or
[1:02:22] both there was just this is just how
[1:02:24] they should have looked at it but they
[1:02:25] all fearful and there said a you bring
[1:02:27] us out here to die and he says Moses
[1:02:28] said fear not stand still and see the
[1:02:30] salvation of the Lord which he will show
[1:02:32] to you today for the Egyptians you whom
[1:02:35] you have seen today you shall see them
[1:02:37] again no more
[1:02:39] forever the Lord shall fight for
[1:02:45] you and you shall hold your
[1:02:48] peace now I think the next verse is
[1:02:50] still very important for us because it
[1:02:53] puts us in the frame of mind that the
[1:02:54] Lord fighting for us us is indicative of
[1:03:00] advancement it's not just recovery it's
[1:03:04] restoration it's not just a hostage
[1:03:06] situation where he's trying to get us
[1:03:08] out of the clutches of the devil get us
[1:03:10] the clutches of Egypt well we're out of
[1:03:13] Egypt you know let's just let's just
[1:03:14] hang out here no he says the Lord shall
[1:03:17] fight for you in verse 15 and the Lord
[1:03:20] said unto Moses wherefore criest thou
[1:03:22] unto
[1:03:23] me speak unto the the children of Israel
[1:03:26] that they go
[1:03:28] forward what are you crying
[1:03:30] for have you not seen my mighty hand do
[1:03:34] you not know what the promise
[1:03:35] is the Lord is the one that shall fight
[1:03:39] for you the battle is the Lord's then go
[1:03:41] forward whatever's in front of you it's
[1:03:43] got to go it's got to be dealt with it
[1:03:46] can't hang on it can't be there forever
[1:03:48] it's got to go out of the way so this is
[1:03:50] what I want to take from this this says
[1:03:52] the Lord shall fight for you the battle
[1:03:53] is the Lord's he is a man of war he Goes
[1:03:56] Forth as a mighty man Jehovah as a hero
[1:03:58] in the battle the Lord he shall fight
[1:04:00] for you so speak and go
[1:04:02] forward your fighting isn't an act of
[1:04:08] Defense I I I I I'm probably going to
[1:04:10] have to just close very or I'm not going
[1:04:12] to be able to cover all the ground I
[1:04:13] wanted to cover today but we're going to
[1:04:16] advance this fighting is not an act of
[1:04:20] Defense it's an act of enforcing
[1:04:22] Redemption
[1:04:25] I it's so important that you view it
[1:04:27] correctly it is not you're fully
[1:04:30] redeemed you're fully adopted fully
[1:04:31] placed sign and here I am just kind of
[1:04:33] waiting for these other guys to catch up
[1:04:35] and you just start I'm just fending
[1:04:36] things off I'm fending things off no the
[1:04:38] armor of the believer they're dressed
[1:04:42] because they're
[1:04:44] advancing they're dressed because
[1:04:46] there's forward movement they have their
[1:04:48] feet Shaw why because there's going to
[1:04:50] be times when their feet are exposed
[1:04:51] because they're walking forward they're
[1:04:53] not just hiding behind the shield they
[1:04:55] don't just have their backs up against
[1:04:56] the wall no this is a forward moving
[1:04:58] message and so the fight is not a
[1:05:01] defensive one but it's an act of
[1:05:03] enforcing redemption's
[1:05:06] claims this is how Paul spoke to Timothy
[1:05:08] in 1 Timothy chapter 1 1 Timothy chapter
[1:05:11] 6 he's
[1:05:12] charging Timothy that by the prophecies
[1:05:15] that have been spoken over him by them
[1:05:18] he might War a good
[1:05:21] Warfare there's nothing defensive in
[1:05:23] that language to war it means to make a
[1:05:26] military expedition to lead soldiers to
[1:05:28] war to be in service to fight so when he
[1:05:31] told them to take the prophecies that
[1:05:33] have been spoken over you and War a good
[1:05:35] Warfare he didn't say hold yourself up
[1:05:37] and defend yourself against all the
[1:05:39] attacks of the enemy but he said this is
[1:05:40] going to be an advancement this is going
[1:05:42] to be offensive and as you advance
[1:05:44] there's going to be fiery darts coming
[1:05:45] your way as you move forward there's
[1:05:47] going to be battles As you move you're
[1:05:48] going to be possessing land so use the
[1:05:51] word to war to make a military
[1:05:53] Expedition and to be led into to
[1:05:56] war war a good Warfare a military
[1:05:59] Expedition or campaign speaks of
[1:06:01] military service or Warfare so he tells
[1:06:04] them in 1 Timothy 6 fight the good fight
[1:06:06] of faith and to lay hold of eternal life
[1:06:09] fight means to enter a contest to
[1:06:10] contend with adversaries to fight with
[1:06:13] difficulties and
[1:06:14] dangers so he's telling them to fight
[1:06:17] the good fight that's a battle fight a
[1:06:20] battle to a
[1:06:22] contest a fighting a striving
[1:06:24] endeavoring with great against
[1:06:26] enemies and when he says lay hold of
[1:06:29] eternal life again this is not a
[1:06:30] defensive posture but it's the act of
[1:06:33] taking
[1:06:34] possession lay hold is the o to overtake
[1:06:37] or to attain it means to seize upon with
[1:06:39] your hands so there must be a reaching
[1:06:42] forth and you don't think while you're
[1:06:44] trying to reach forth the devil's not
[1:06:45] there trying to knock your hand
[1:06:47] away keep your hands in your pocket
[1:06:50] that's when you know it's really cold
[1:06:51] right when a lawyer has his hands in his
[1:06:53] own pocket
[1:06:56] as long as you keep your hands in your
[1:06:58] pocket Devil's all right it's fine but
[1:07:01] as soon as you start reaching forth he's
[1:07:03] there to try to stop
[1:07:04] you lay a
[1:07:07] hold I notice what it says in 2
[1:07:09] Corinthians chapter 10: three and four
[1:07:13] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[1:07:15] not war there's the same word for war to
[1:07:17] make military Expedition we do not war
[1:07:19] after the flesh for the weapons of our
[1:07:22] Warfare there's the word again about a
[1:07:24] military Expedition or campaign the
[1:07:26] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[1:07:29] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[1:07:31] down of
[1:07:33] strongholds what did the siege of
[1:07:35] Petersburg teach us once the strongholds
[1:07:38] tore down you keep
[1:07:41] advancing once something's cleared out
[1:07:43] you possess
[1:07:45] it once you've had a victory you move
[1:07:47] the battle line
[1:07:49] forward in this battle we do not
[1:07:51] Skirmish on a field and then
[1:07:54] Retreat we do not have a battle here
[1:07:56] over doubt and then we vacate the
[1:07:57] battlefield of doubt we plant the flag
[1:08:00] of faith and we say this ground is
[1:08:02] possessed and now that I have this
[1:08:05] ground what's next frustration all right
[1:08:07] let's plant the flag of faith on
[1:08:09] frustration next and you keep advancing
[1:08:12] and you keep advancing why because the
[1:08:14] weapons of our Warfare are meant to the
[1:08:17] pulling down of strongholds that's a
[1:08:18] fortress that's an entrenchment that's a
[1:08:21] place where your enemy has been
[1:08:22] fortifying his position against you and
[1:08:25] one CE you've shined the light on him
[1:08:26] and exposed him he puts up a fight but
[1:08:29] once you tear it down you've got him on
[1:08:31] the run and now you bring the fight to
[1:08:33] the
[1:08:35] enemy there's a difference of you
[1:08:37] fighting
[1:08:38] Philistines and you kicking Philistines
[1:08:41] out of where they want us they've been
[1:08:43] living and the battle some of you are
[1:08:45] facing is not a matter of you having not
[1:08:46] possessed enough or Disobedience or
[1:08:49] backsliding but it's a matter of your
[1:08:53] maturing you're finally a great grown up
[1:08:55] enough to fight this I'm not saying that
[1:08:59] condescendingly you've Advanced to push
[1:09:01] that out you were too small at one time
[1:09:04] to push it out just as he said by little
[1:09:06] and little I'll drive the enemy out from
[1:09:08] before you till you be increased and can
[1:09:10] possess the land I'm not going to do it
[1:09:12] all at one time but as you
[1:09:14] increase as you put footsteps to the
[1:09:16] promises as you come to their door then
[1:09:19] I'll drive them out I'm not just going
[1:09:20] to go ahead and drive them all out
[1:09:22] you've got to come to their
[1:09:23] doorstep and then I can f for
[1:09:26] you you've tored down some strongholds
[1:09:29] now the devil's been exposed now there's
[1:09:31] more
[1:09:34] fighting the greatest battle ever fought
[1:09:36] is a mind
[1:09:38] battle because God's taking back your
[1:09:42] mind recesses in your thoughts that were
[1:09:46] buried things that you had no idea
[1:09:48] formed the basis for certain attitudes
[1:09:50] and actions and all of a sudden like why
[1:09:52] am I going through this now this is
[1:09:54] Victory
[1:09:56] why is this happening this is maturity
[1:09:59] this is advancement these are things
[1:10:01] that have held you back but now this is
[1:10:02] going to be dealt with this is going to
[1:10:04] be torn down God wants it all every
[1:10:08] part there's there's no junk jawer in
[1:10:10] your
[1:10:11] mind right some of us have junk drawers
[1:10:14] some of us have junk closets some of us
[1:10:15] have junk
[1:10:17] garages right we all have some space we
[1:10:20] just kind of let it go now don't look in
[1:10:22] there that's just where all our garbage
[1:10:24] goes that's where hm I want to save this
[1:10:26] from kindergarten you just never know
[1:10:28] when you're going to need
[1:10:29] it one day when my kids are in
[1:10:32] kindergarten oh they're all teenagers
[1:10:33] now well my
[1:10:35] grandkids but there's no there's no junk
[1:10:37] jawer in your mind for
[1:10:40] God there's no garage there's no under
[1:10:42] the bed there's no part there's no part
[1:10:44] in your mind that God says you know what
[1:10:45] it's okay you can keep that God says I
[1:10:47] want it
[1:10:48] all every thought every crevice every
[1:10:51] nook every cranny every drawer every
[1:10:53] closet every room every gar he wants
[1:10:56] everything
[1:10:57] his and so as the word starts searching
[1:11:00] through your mind he's taking possession
[1:11:02] of your soul now that he has your soul
[1:11:04] he's like now it's time to do battle not
[1:11:07] just in the mind but for the mind now
[1:11:09] you've got the warrior and what is he
[1:11:10] itching for a fight and that place you
[1:11:13] just never wanted to go there oh no I'll
[1:11:15] do anything but I don't want to have to
[1:11:16] clean the garage he's like no we've got
[1:11:18] this come on we've got this it's time
[1:11:21] and now he's wanting to give you enough
[1:11:23] courage to roll up your sleeves and say
[1:11:25] today is garage day today is the day
[1:11:29] that I get this cleaned up today is the
[1:11:32] day that this is finally set in order
[1:11:34] and we just need to put our shoulders
[1:11:36] back like a Peter cartright and say God
[1:11:39] this must be what's
[1:11:42] next you know why you're going through
[1:11:44] it because God wants you to be free from
[1:11:49] it brother BR says restore means to
[1:11:52] return to the former own owner or to
[1:11:55] bring back to the former of state of
[1:11:58] condition this is what he says
[1:11:59] restoration is if we are in a
[1:12:01] restoration season if this word is
[1:12:03] restorative if our faith is being
[1:12:05] restored it means to return to the
[1:12:06] former owner to bring back to a former
[1:12:09] estate or condition and he says and we
[1:12:11] can enforce a claim to be
[1:12:15] restored you're you're not defending a
[1:12:17] claim you're taking back a claim you're
[1:12:21] not building up entrenchments and a moat
[1:12:24] and and trying to do this and trying to
[1:12:25] do that trying to figure out a way to
[1:12:27] defend yourself no you are enforcing a
[1:12:31] claim upon what basis the basis of
[1:12:34] restored faith I have a
[1:12:37] right to have
[1:12:39] this we're saying we're inverting the
[1:12:41] battle now any raging battle is the
[1:12:44] evidence of the work of
[1:12:47] restoration every battle is the evidence
[1:12:50] of a work of restoration in other words
[1:12:52] you're taking back what was lost you
[1:12:54] know I surrendered that part of my mind
[1:12:56] my emotions I Surrender that part I I I
[1:12:57] just let the devil have it I just let it
[1:12:59] go no at some point God's going to
[1:13:01] circle you back and say now you're
[1:13:02] strong enough take
[1:13:04] it you're taking back what was lost this
[1:13:07] was so impressed upon me that I know
[1:13:10] this is this is
[1:13:12] God
[1:13:14] speaking you have not lost your mind you
[1:13:18] are not losing your mind you're winning
[1:13:20] it
[1:13:22] back I didn't get that from Joel Stein
[1:13:25] or Joyce
[1:13:26] Myers you're not losing your mind you're
[1:13:29] winning it back and the devil wants us
[1:13:31] to think I'm losing my mind am I'm
[1:13:33] losing my mind I think I've lost it I'm
[1:13:35] losing control I'm losing control of my
[1:13:36] emotions no no the battle may seem hot
[1:13:38] and heavy things may seem to be chaotic
[1:13:41] things may seem to be going sideways
[1:13:42] this may not be what you expected and
[1:13:44] you think you're losing your mind but in
[1:13:46] reality you're actually winning it
[1:13:49] back because now something's been
[1:13:51] stirred up and now the lewd fellows of a
[1:13:54] baser sort are all anxious and upset why
[1:13:58] because you've turned somebody's world
[1:14:00] upside down and God is getting things
[1:14:02] right and that's why you're fighting
[1:14:04] you're not losing your mind you're
[1:14:06] winning your mind you're finding your
[1:14:09] right
[1:14:12] mind as thought by thought inch by
[1:14:16] inch I because Satan's being exposed
[1:14:37] okay I'm
[1:14:38] GNA skip a whole bunch brother John's
[1:14:42] the only one that knows just how much
[1:14:43] I'm skipping i w to go to I don't know
[1:14:45] what slide it is but it's just after the
[1:14:47] breach I think the first statement from
[1:14:49] the breach greatest battle ever fought
[1:14:50] we got a festar general and then I'm
[1:14:53] going to skip um to the last quote
[1:14:58] if I could say this brother bam talks
[1:15:00] about in greatest battle ever fought he
[1:15:02] says the brains of the army lays in its
[1:15:05] captains the
[1:15:10] intelligence what's taking place
[1:15:13] today is
[1:15:15] not it's a Warfare related to the time
[1:15:18] you're living
[1:15:19] in it's because of the things that are
[1:15:21] happening in the super Supernatural
[1:15:23] Realm
[1:15:25] again if we're looking at a problem we
[1:15:26] work our way backwards and you
[1:15:30] say I have to defeat
[1:15:34] death right you do I won't say me you do
[1:15:40] right you have to defeat death you have
[1:15:43] to bind the
[1:15:45] greatest so you're going to go in a
[1:15:47] Rapture
[1:15:49] right whoever believes it can amen
[1:15:52] it then let's work our way backwards
[1:15:56] if I'm going to go in a Rapture then
[1:15:58] what would be something that would keep
[1:15:59] me from getting
[1:16:01] there now think about what you're going
[1:16:03] through
[1:16:06] now can you recognize that the reason
[1:16:08] why you're fighting what you're fighting
[1:16:10] now is not because you've wandered off
[1:16:14] somewhere not because you're weak and
[1:16:15] because you're wrong but it's because of
[1:16:17] where you're
[1:16:19] going you're fighting this because of
[1:16:21] where you're going you're fighting
[1:16:23] because where the promise l if they had
[1:16:25] gone the other way there would have been
[1:16:27] no Red Sea and the devil would have said
[1:16:29] well go ahead run right head long into
[1:16:30] the desert but because they were going
[1:16:32] in the right direction there was a Red
[1:16:34] Sea in their way and an army behind them
[1:16:37] but there was a promise that said they
[1:16:38] would get there so they just had to work
[1:16:40] backwards I'm fighting today because of
[1:16:43] the promise that God gave me and he made
[1:16:45] the promise that this is his
[1:16:51] fight brother Bram says this and
[1:16:53] greatest battle ever fought we got a
[1:16:55] five-star general spelled Jesus
[1:16:59] s this is the one we have fighting the
[1:17:01] battle this is the intelligence think
[1:17:03] now I wanted to use some other
[1:17:04] statements in a little bit different
[1:17:07] context about the time that we're living
[1:17:09] in now this is who is in the battle on
[1:17:13] the
[1:17:14] Battleground the battle in your mind is
[1:17:16] not a is not oneon-one you and the
[1:17:21] devil Christ
[1:17:25] the reason why you're fighting is
[1:17:26] because Jesus
[1:17:28] Christ and you've got a five star five
[1:17:31] star general Jesus and I love this
[1:17:33] placing five stars
[1:17:35] on
[1:17:37] us we've been made a five-star
[1:17:40] general right along with him and what
[1:17:43] did he give us F AI t h
[1:17:45] Faith he's never lost a battle and he
[1:17:49] starts saying hallelujah a lot in here
[1:17:51] hallelujah he conquered death hell in
[1:17:54] the grave
[1:17:56] get the Devils out of the
[1:17:59] way out of the way why out of the way
[1:18:03] I'm going somewhere Satan get out of my
[1:18:07] way if you're just laying around you say
[1:18:09] just leave me alone just leave me little
[1:18:11] I'm trying to take a
[1:18:12] nap but you're going
[1:18:14] somewhere and you've ruffled his
[1:18:16] feathers and ye he's in your way and
[1:18:19] you're enforc it what are you doing you
[1:18:21] are evicting him he's not disturbing
[1:18:25] your peace you're taking it back you're
[1:18:28] not losing your mind you're winning it
[1:18:30] back you've Advanced to his doorstep and
[1:18:33] you're saying I've got eviction papers
[1:18:35] I've got a title deed I've got every
[1:18:37] right to this I'm enforcing Redemption
[1:18:39] claims what gives you the right to do
[1:18:41] that the mighty Angel the man of war has
[1:18:44] told me to take this claim and to
[1:18:46] enforce this claim and that's exactly
[1:18:49] what I'm
[1:18:50] doing says get the Devils out of the way
[1:18:53] he's the great chief captain and this is
[1:18:55] just what's so beautiful in some ways
[1:18:57] maybe it contradicts everything I've
[1:18:58] been trying to say so the devil isn't
[1:19:00] even in the
[1:19:03] picture it's not about the
[1:19:05] devil let's not make him the subject the
[1:19:08] devil is attacking me
[1:19:10] okay why because he's under
[1:19:15] attack says to where the devil isn't
[1:19:17] even in the picture anymore why because
[1:19:19] it's about Christ it's about advancement
[1:19:21] of the word it's about the promise of
[1:19:22] the hour and anything that stands in the
[1:19:24] ways has got to get dealt
[1:19:26] with and Lord deal with my adversaries
[1:19:29] Lord deal with my weaknesses deal with
[1:19:31] my doubts deal with my frustrations deal
[1:19:33] with my word deal with them Lord I don't
[1:19:35] want to suppress them I don't want to
[1:19:36] ignore them I don't want to shove them
[1:19:37] off into a corner if there's some recess
[1:19:39] if there's some dark place if there's
[1:19:41] something in me come on Lord you're
[1:19:43] itching to fight Lord come fight my
[1:19:45] battle Lord get in here and help me I
[1:19:47] want to overcome this once and forever I
[1:19:49] want to be God I want to be behind me
[1:19:52] why I'm going forward
[1:19:55] so the devil isn't even in the picture
[1:19:58] anymore the greatest battle was ever
[1:20:00] raged is setting right ready
[1:20:04] now in the language that he's using he
[1:20:06] says the great hour of charge is at
[1:20:12] hand not the great hour here's coming
[1:20:14] another
[1:20:15] one we kind of use this the idea brother
[1:20:19] saying Satan's got one
[1:20:20] punch so it's almost as if we're just
[1:20:22] kind
[1:20:23] of hanging out at the
[1:20:27] party just waiting to get sucker
[1:20:30] punched oh thought you were the devil
[1:20:33] right like what's what's my punch right
[1:20:36] so I back up I'm G to hide go wor no
[1:20:40] throw the Long Island ice tea
[1:20:43] away you're out of that it's over behind
[1:20:47] you you're on the battlefield for the
[1:20:49] Lord now and he's got one punch coming
[1:20:51] but he's going to throw it when you show
[1:20:52] up at his doorstep say time to leave
[1:20:55] buddy enough's enough I'm getting out of
[1:20:59] here and you're in my way and you didn't
[1:21:01] pick a fight with the devil this isn't
[1:21:03] bradia this isn't you making some wild
[1:21:04] claims the Lord brought you to this
[1:21:06] fight the battle's the Lords David
[1:21:09] didn't go picking on the armies of the
[1:21:11] Philistines and they said well you want
[1:21:12] to mess with us you're going to mess
[1:21:13] with Goliath David showed up one day
[1:21:14] just doing his
[1:21:16] business doing what he was supposed to
[1:21:18] do doing what a 12-year-old boy would do
[1:21:19] bringing cheese and bringing some corn
[1:21:20] and bringing things to his brothers and
[1:21:22] the captains and he shows up and someone
[1:21:24] has showed up and making a bold claim
[1:21:26] send me a man send me a man and they was
[1:21:28] like you guys are just going to let him
[1:21:29] talk to you like that well this isn't
[1:21:31] right think about all the things God had
[1:21:32] done for us the things that Jesse had
[1:21:34] said and taught him instilled with him a
[1:21:35] faith to believe God said that every
[1:21:37] single one of our enemies would be
[1:21:39] defeated this is the battle this is our
[1:21:41] enemy what are we worried about take the
[1:21:44] battle to
[1:21:45] him that's how he said the battle is the
[1:21:47] Lord's the great hour of charge is at
[1:21:50] hand David didn't wait for Goliath to
[1:21:52] regroup he ran after after him and he
[1:21:55] ran and said today I'm you're going to
[1:21:57] be delivered in my hands and he charged
[1:21:59] to the Giant and he slew the Giant in
[1:22:02] his advancement caused all Israel to
[1:22:04] rally and put the Philistines to
[1:22:07] flight the great hour of charge is at
[1:22:09] hand he says he don't have
[1:22:11] Retreat so he's teaching Us in these
[1:22:13] statements shine your armor polish your
[1:22:15] armor up you got to get
[1:22:18] ready because it's time to
[1:22:21] fight musicians if you could come
[1:22:26] if you could just take some time go
[1:22:28] listen to the
[1:22:34] breach and and all the things brother
[1:22:36] talking about Redemptive claims
[1:22:37] Redemptive
[1:22:41] claims and how that we must we can only
[1:22:45] properly view the Battle we're going
[1:22:47] through through God's promise of the
[1:22:51] hour that somehow when I'm going through
[1:22:55] right now is related to where I'm
[1:23:00] going somehow if it's if you've been
[1:23:03] disobedient you've been doing things
[1:23:04] wrong and you're in a battle and things
[1:23:06] are falling apart and things aren't
[1:23:07] working out the way you want them to
[1:23:09] that's God's
[1:23:11] grace forming forming some
[1:23:16] resistance and you're getting this
[1:23:18] resist you're not going to drop any
[1:23:19] further than this and it's his way of
[1:23:21] saying Turn Around you're going the
[1:23:22] wrong way
[1:23:25] why is that there because of where
[1:23:27] you're
[1:23:28] going if you weren't going up yonder if
[1:23:31] you weren't leaving in a Rapture that
[1:23:33] wouldn't be there you just go as far as
[1:23:37] far as one could go but at some point
[1:23:39] God says stop you're going the wrong
[1:23:43] direction it's says turn
[1:23:45] around and then whatever you meet on
[1:23:47] your way back you're meeting it because
[1:23:50] you're on your way back whatever you're
[1:23:52] going through whatever you're fighting
[1:23:53] with whatever's happening it's standing
[1:23:55] in the way of you in pure
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:00] joy brother B makes a statement the
[1:24:02] greatest battle ever fought he says oh

[1:24:49] of the Lord but our strength is the joy
[1:24:53] of the Lord is my
[1:24:56] strength that's my that's my strength
[1:24:59] some spooky Spirit Some Cloud something
[1:25:01] coming against me I'm going to take the
[1:25:03] word of the Lord the joy of the Lord is
[1:25:05] my strength get away from me
[1:25:08] whack you cut them with the word whether
[1:25:11] it be a demon whether it be an enemy
[1:25:13] whether it be a sickness whether it be a
[1:25:16] disease whatever it
[1:25:18] is take that word pull it with the
[1:25:22] sword and if you whack it the first time
[1:25:26] and it don't seem to move whack it
[1:25:29] again and whack it again and whack it
[1:25:32] again don't
[1:25:35] stop brother what should I do whack it
[1:25:38] yeah let it have let him have
[1:25:41] it about the arrow of God's
[1:25:43] Deliverance the prophet said take this
[1:25:46] take the arrow and smite the
[1:25:48] ground King took the arrow was like
[1:25:54] the prophet was Roth he
[1:25:57] said that's
[1:25:59] it he's going to kind of pound it five
[1:26:03] times he said because you only did it
[1:26:05] you you you'll have five victories but
[1:26:07] you won't completely defeat the
[1:26:09] enemy you ought to have taken this
[1:26:12] opportunity to strike and to strike and
[1:26:15] to strike and to strike and to strike
[1:26:17] did he recognize the value of the
[1:26:19] opportunity with the prophet that was
[1:26:21] standing before him did he recognize the
[1:26:22] chance that he had to take the AR of
[1:26:24] God's deliverance and completely drive
[1:26:26] out the enemy from before him that
[1:26:28] Prophet made his mistake but or that
[1:26:30] King made his mistake let us not make
[1:26:32] the same
[1:26:34] mistake take the eror of God's
[1:26:36] deliverance and say Lord I must strike

[1:29:38] stopped me in the fall or a roadblock
[1:29:40] that stands in my way now as I'm
[1:29:43] rising Lord I'm accepting that I'm going
[1:29:45] to win I can't
[1:29:47] lose I'm accepting that you know the way
[1:29:50] we
[1:29:51] don't I'm looking to you the festar G
[1:29:54] General that's placed a five star of
[1:29:55] faith upon me the battle is yours that's
[1:29:59] why I'm willing to fight is because
[1:30:00] you're fighting with
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:06] me I'm willing to fight because I know
[1:30:08] the thoughts that you have towards
[1:30:10] me I'm fighting Lord because of the
[1:30:13] promise that you
[1:30:15] made Lord as I've encouraged the people
[1:30:17] to invert the
[1:30:20] battle what it's what has been
[1:30:24] so heavy upon my heart is how that you
[1:30:26] have
[1:30:28] attacked that how that people have felt
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:33] attacked and how the devil tries to work
[1:30:35] in that realm to discourage like oh it
[1:30:38] seems so much harder now and I didn't
[1:30:40] know it'd be like this and man it was a
[1:30:43] lot easier when we were just kind of
[1:30:44] bubble dancing and oh man I I don't know
[1:30:47] are we doing something
[1:30:49] [Music]
[1:30:51] wrong and I felt impressed
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:58] to take the word of God and open up our
[1:31:00] understanding to
[1:31:01] see that we as Believers are fighting
[1:31:04] this fight because we're going forward
[1:31:05] not going
[1:31:07] back if he would have just stayed where
[1:31:09] we were there would have been no fight
[1:31:11] we have just kept the status quo there'
[1:31:13] have been no fight if we hadn't made a
[1:31:14] stand for the word there' have been no
[1:31:16] fight but Lord we're fighting today
[1:31:18] because we drew our swords and we made a
[1:31:20] stand for truth we said Lord we're going
[1:31:23] forward
[1:31:24] and father if this be true then Lord I
[1:31:27] put my shoulders back and if I I must
[1:31:30] fight if my I must rain increase my
[1:31:33] courage Lord and then I want to take the
[1:31:35] fight to the bully who's trying to steal
[1:31:37] my joy
[1:31:39] today rob me of my peace take my
[1:31:43] family tear down the things that you're
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:48] doing devil you are
[1:31:52] exposed re reason why you're scurrying
[1:31:54] the reason why you're fighting is
[1:31:56] because light has advanced to your
[1:31:59] hideout and the fall of Petersburg has
[1:32:02] come and now the armies of God have
[1:32:04] advanced to Richmond and now the
[1:32:06] believer takes their sword it says today
[1:32:09] I take the
[1:32:11] capital today I possess
[1:32:14] it and Lord may we do
[1:32:17] so Lord we do not do so presumptuously
[1:32:20] to venture without Authority thinking
[1:32:22] that somehow after this afternoon there
[1:32:24] will be no fight no Lord we're going
[1:32:26] forward we expect a fight but the battle
[1:32:30] is
[1:32:31] yours we're going forward that's why you
[1:32:33] gave us a sword and no armor for our
[1:32:36] backs we're going forward therefore we
[1:32:39] know there's more fights there's more
[1:32:41] victories and Lord let us win victories
[1:32:44] save Souls hurting Hearts sick bodies
[1:32:49] may we advance Lord in the promises of
[1:32:51] God and see every enemy
[1:32:54] defeated that's our
[1:32:58] prayer may the believer take the sword
[1:33:02] today say my strength
[1:33:05] is the joy of the
[1:33:07] [Music]
[1:33:09] Lord fight every demon out of
[1:33:13] hell we ask it in the name of the Lord
[1:33:15] Jesus Christ amen
