[0:02] I'm continuing on a matter of Faith
[0:04] tonight the subtitle is a kind of a
[0:07] question human or Divine and so it's a
[0:11] still on that subject of a matter of
[0:13] faith and in the question human or
[0:16] Divine it is kind of pointing back to
[0:18] whether it is a matter of human Faith or
[0:20] a matter of divine faith I think that's
[0:22] a lot to just explore in that question
[0:24] this is running parallel to the series
[0:27] on Christ my healer and there's been
[0:30] three parts already and the first part
[0:32] was looking at how the faith is a state
[0:34] of being and if it is a matter of Faith
[0:37] to that person then it is a matter uh it
[0:40] because that becomes the ultimate
[0:42] brother Brown pointed out in the
[0:43] absolute it's they becomes the thing
[0:45] that they rest everything on that
[0:47] barometer what they judge everything by
[0:49] and we kind of uh
[0:51] wrapped up that particular part on how
[0:55] faith is ecstasy and that it's
[0:56] transcending normal human experience and
[0:58] it's something that lifts the individual
[1:00] up and then part two in augmented in
[1:02] reality we looked at how that faith is a
[1:04] higher way of viewing the world and that
[1:06] with the lens of faith we can enhance
[1:08] our experience in the world and have
[1:10] access to some information and a layer
[1:13] of information or data if we want to put
[1:15] it that way that kind of augments or
[1:17] supplements our experience and what
[1:19] we're perceiving and it's a benefit to
[1:21] us to have that kind of faith and then
[1:23] that tied into the next part on
[1:25] invisible Dimensions or invisible Realms
[1:27] how that our faith is anchored in a
[1:30] Divine Dimension that's higher that's
[1:32] invisible it's not something we
[1:34] necessarily see with our eyes and that
[1:36] with that lens of Faith or with that
[1:39] Faith being Anchored In Those higher
[1:40] Dimensions we can watch the influence
[1:43] from those other base dimensions and
[1:45] those lower Dimensions that have that
[1:47] Humanity's tapped into and the humanity
[1:49] is tied to in humanity is influenced by
[1:51] so it really approached Faith from a
[1:53] particular perspective but today
[1:55] in this question of human or Divine
[1:58] we're really looking at how Faith
[2:00] operates on a person or in a person and
[2:03] certain measures or processes that may
[2:05] re uh that may be at work in a person
[2:07] and the results that come from faith and
[2:11] and it's just going to be kind of
[2:13] introductory laying some things out and
[2:15] I have to be very it's going to be I
[2:17] think it's going to be thought provoking
[2:18] because there may be some things that we
[2:19] mention and point to that are going to
[2:21] cause us to ponder and think about
[2:23] certain things but I'm not necessarily
[2:25] going to try to resolve anything there's
[2:27] some things I think that are worth us
[2:29] acknowledging that it's a paradox
[2:30] there's some things worth acknowledging
[2:32] that I can't explain that and and and I
[2:36] don't understand this and maybe it goes
[2:38] without saying but I'll state it so it's
[2:40] on record I am not going to do a series
[2:42] on faith and attempt to explain faith
[2:46] right it just wouldn't make much sense
[2:48] so this is not this is just taking the
[2:50] word of God as it relates to Faith and
[2:52] put it in a place where your faith can
[2:54] reach out and grab it and your faith can
[2:56] make more sense to it and brother random
[2:59] in the sermon faith is the substance we
[3:00] were listening together as a family and
[3:03] it's all it's a service that's really
[3:05] good to go back and visit to me it is no
[3:07] coincidence that at least to this point
[3:10] the first sermon that we have of brother
[3:12] Branham recorded so that we know and
[3:14] first time we have his words
[3:15] memorialized on tape to know exactly
[3:17] what he said is Faith is the substance
[3:20] knowing that his ministry is to bring us
[3:22] to a place of rapture and Faith or turn
[3:24] our hearts back to an original faith and
[3:26] a very first statement he makes is
[3:27] they're setting up new gadgets here so
[3:29] it's really appropriate how it starts
[3:30] and when you listen to that service
[3:33] it is very very thought-provoking how he
[3:36] treats faith
[3:37] in in a way that's really kind of
[3:40] shocking and jarring a little bit he
[3:42] knows it when he's talking about it that
[3:44] he's presented it in a way that maybe
[3:45] they hadn't considered before and he
[3:47] says at the very beginning of this
[3:48] sermon there's so many people speaks of
[3:50] faith and doesn't have one principle
[3:53] doesn't know one principle of Faith so
[3:56] many people can talk about faith speak
[3:58] of Faith but don't know one principle of
[4:00] Faith so it tells me that there's
[4:01] different principles of faith and
[4:04] they're kind of missing them all not
[4:05] maybe just one singular principle of
[4:07] Faith but many different principles
[4:09] there's a lot of things that we could
[4:10] think about faith but what we want to
[4:12] know at the end of the day are the
[4:13] principles of faith and as I as you look
[4:17] at Matthew chapter 21 we'll begin
[4:19] reading there in our text I will say
[4:21] that as we provoke your thoughts tonight
[4:23] I need to be very deliberate in what I
[4:26] say and not kind of venture even beyond
[4:29] what I have before me I want to be very
[4:32] very careful because it's uh this is
[4:33] just the beginning of a thought that I'd
[4:36] like to present hopefully next Wednesday
[4:37] day night on this particular subject
[4:40] that relates to human or Divine so we're
[4:42] just kind of getting some of the puzzle
[4:43] pieces on the table flipping them all
[4:45] over and hopefully getting a little bit
[4:47] of a border together tonight
[4:48] and I won't tell you how many pieces the
[4:50] puzzle is we'll figure that out as we go
[4:52] Matthew chapter 21 I want to read
[4:54] through it again just so we could kind
[4:56] of be in this Channel and pick up
[4:58] together and I think in terms of faith
[5:00] faith as a all the things we've talked
[5:02] about so far and when we know Jesus
[5:04] living in a world of his own but let's
[5:05] just look at this so in the morning he
[5:07] returned to the city and he was hungry
[5:09] he's a fig tree found nothing there on
[5:11] so he says in verse 19 let no fruit grow
[5:13] on thee hence Forward Forever it says in
[5:17] this instance the presently the Fig Tree
[5:19] withered away and then the disciples in
[5:21] verse 20 are marveling at how his words
[5:23] had such an immediate impact in other
[5:26] words it's not time for this tree to
[5:28] wither uh had it been in a certain time
[5:30] of season or so many months passed maybe
[5:32] they'd be like oh well that's that's to
[5:34] be expected by natural course so it's
[5:36] kind of showing us he speaks this word
[5:38] to this fig tree and they're marveling
[5:41] because this fig tree ought not to have
[5:42] withered but it did exactly what Jesus
[5:44] said
[5:45] and then what he says to me is uh
[5:48] opening up something to us he says
[5:51] verily I say unto you if you have faith
[5:53] and doubt not
[5:54] you shall not only do this which is done
[5:56] to the Fig Tree and the key there is if
[5:58] you have faith and doubt not so it tells
[6:01] us right away that doubt
[6:03] can become a barrier to Faith a doubt is
[6:06] certainly not a boundary to Faith but it
[6:08] becomes a barrier to Faith that needs to
[6:10] be removed so you can have faith but the
[6:13] presence of Doubt just is a limiting
[6:15] factor to What Faith Can accomplish it
[6:17] says you shall not only do this which is
[6:18] done to the Fig Tree but also if you
[6:20] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[6:21] removed and be thou cast into the sea it
[6:24] shall be done
[6:26] and all things whatsoever you shall ask
[6:28] in prayer believing you shall receive
[6:31] and
[6:32] there's I kind of have a little bit of a
[6:35] nature sometimes to in just in personal
[6:37] conversations or talking to the kids or
[6:39] kind of give extreme examples sometimes
[6:42] just to make the point you know of
[6:44] course not or absolutely and so you just
[6:47] kind of go to the extremes and says I
[6:49] don't care if you had all the money in
[6:50] Europe you're not buying yourself an
[6:51] iPad or something like that and so
[6:53] there's just statements you make
[6:55] sometimes just to be extreme and you
[6:57] realize they're outside the realm of
[6:59] possibility
[7:00] so Jesus says that if you had faith and
[7:02] didn't doubt not only could you curse a
[7:04] fig tree but you could speak to a
[7:06] mountain and ask it to move itself into
[7:09] the sea and it shall be done
[7:14] and Jesus is identifying the capacity of
[7:18] Faith to do something that seems
[7:19] physically impossible
[7:22] but yet he's telling us that there's
[7:23] something about faith or the elements of
[7:26] faith and the principles of faith that
[7:28] some a person who could speak with faith
[7:31] without any doubt could speak to not a
[7:34] mountain of sin not a figurative
[7:36] Mountain but speak to a literal Mountain
[7:39] Mount Everest or whatever Mountain you
[7:41] want to mention Mount Humphrey and
[7:43] Flagstaff or something and say all right
[7:45] I want you to move yourself and cast
[7:48] yourself into the sea and Jesus is
[7:50] saying if we believe what Jesus says
[7:52] he's saying it would happen
[7:54] and then he says a companion statement
[7:56] in terms of whatsoever you shall ask in
[7:58] prayer believe and you shall receive and
[7:59] I think that's a companion uh to what he
[8:02] says but I'm separate from what he's
[8:04] talking about
[8:05] and Jesus to say that faith without
[8:08] doubt so this kind of unfettered faith
[8:10] for him to say that it could literally
[8:12] move a mountain which is what we believe
[8:14] he was saying it touches on this
[8:16] mysterious uh if I could say this the
[8:19] mysterious part of humanity and the
[8:21] capacity of humanity when it when it has
[8:24] Faith or when it believes
[8:27] and this is something that science still
[8:29] grapples with and maybe I'm kind of
[8:31] foreshadowing a little bit where I want
[8:32] to go with this but it could even be
[8:34] said of the placebo effect have you ever
[8:37] heard of the placebo effect it is it's
[8:40] an absolute within science they accept
[8:42] it and they believe in it they believe
[8:43] that it's not just a theory but it's
[8:44] something that's been proven uh the
[8:46] placebo effect that I could give you a
[8:48] pill for a certain sickness and if you
[8:51] believe that it would be effective on
[8:53] whatever your element was you take it
[8:55] and you actually get better and have
[8:57] measurable results
[8:59] and then science comes back later and
[9:00] says we gave you a water pill
[9:03] but because the person thought they were
[9:04] taking a pill that would actually treat
[9:06] that particular ailment or that
[9:08] particular problem it's the power of the
[9:11] human mind to believe in something and
[9:13] then in believing it it actually brings
[9:16] measurable results to pass this has been
[9:18] measured across many different
[9:20] disciplines in many different ways to
[9:21] where science is acknowledging they
[9:24] can't they can't say it for certain in
[9:25] certain ways and there's no fact that
[9:27] they can derive but they're looking at
[9:29] certain things and saying why is it that
[9:31] someone can do this and it's something
[9:33] paranormal something they can't explain
[9:35] and I would say that if if we were able
[9:38] to speak to a mountain and cause it to
[9:39] move and that literally happened then in
[9:42] a literal sense everyone say well the
[9:45] mountain moved right and science
[9:48] wouldn't argue with that and science
[9:49] could say yeah it used to be there it's
[9:51] not there anymore and we all the webcams
[9:54] caught it walk in itself to the Sea it
[9:56] happened and they would say we're not
[9:58] sure but we'll try to figure it out
[10:00] and who knows they might say Well it had
[10:03] been moving incrementally over a real
[10:04] long period of time and this was just
[10:06] the Tipping Point we didn't really catch
[10:07] it or the wind just kind of drives it
[10:09] and causes to do that be interesting to
[10:11] hear how they would try to describe it
[10:12] but Jesus is saying that that would have
[10:15] been an Act of Faith
[10:17] now in Matthew chapter 17 verses 19 to
[10:20] 20 we this is a different instance but
[10:22] he he's making a statement about the
[10:24] power of faith and I'd like to maybe
[10:29] taking a greater examination of this
[10:31] particular passage and this happening in
[10:34] a different sermon but the disciples had
[10:36] had difficulty casting out a demon he
[10:39] says then the disciples to Jesus came to
[10:41] the disciples to Jesus apart and said
[10:43] why could we not cast him out why was
[10:45] this demon so stubborn that we couldn't
[10:47] cast them out because they will arrive
[10:50] here a little bit as to where they had
[10:51] that power they've been given that
[10:52] Authority and Jesus said to them because
[10:54] of your unbelief or because of the doubt
[10:57] that was present it wasn't in the
[10:59] language it's not that they had no faith
[11:01] but it was Faith mixed with a little bit
[11:03] of doubt and there's some some
[11:05] resistance there and they weren't able
[11:07] to do it he says severely I say unto you
[11:09] if you have faith as a grain of mustard
[11:11] seed you shall say unto this mountain
[11:14] remove hints to Yonder place I like that
[11:16] yonder place and it shall remove and
[11:19] nothing shall be impossible unto you now
[11:22] in each one of these instances Jesus
[11:24] isn't giving us very many qualifiers
[11:26] he's not saying that if you go to the
[11:28] right church and you pay your tithes and
[11:30] you participate in feet washing and
[11:32] communion just kind of referring to
[11:34] these elements of Faith or these
[11:35] principles of faith that if someone
[11:37] believes and and does that not have
[11:39] doubt that there's the capacity of Faith
[11:41] to do something that we know is
[11:43] scientifically or at least physically
[11:45] impossible or has never been done to our
[11:48] knowledge something that kind of works
[11:50] against our human thinking and so it was
[11:52] because he says of their unbelief that
[11:55] it didn't happen it says but faith of
[11:57] the grain of a mustard seed and and it's
[11:59] kind of trying to orient it to something
[12:01] that is very very small or minuscule and
[12:04] it's not meant to berate them in terms
[12:06] of not having faith he's just saying
[12:08] faith unfettered faith that doesn't have
[12:10] the resistance and the barriers of
[12:12] unbelief even if it's just the size of a
[12:15] mustard seed is powerful enough to move
[12:17] a mountain
[12:18] and then it says nothing shall be
[12:20] impossible unto you so it's expressing
[12:23] this element that that kind of faith
[12:25] moves a person into a realm of where
[12:28] everything is possible
[12:30] and and so it puts it it's shifting it
[12:32] to a Divine realm because they say with
[12:34] man this is impossible but With God all
[12:36] things are possible so we could say that
[12:38] on some level God has designed our our
[12:42] existence in this realm of life and even
[12:45] Humanity to where there's this law this
[12:47] law that science can't prove a law that
[12:49] science does not accept that if a person
[12:52] could tap into this this faith and
[12:55] believe it all it gives them unlimited
[12:57] potential because of the way that God
[13:00] has planned it the way that God has
[13:01] designed it it's not the man that does
[13:03] it but it's God that has has given
[13:05] mankind access to a power through faith
[13:08] and again I'm trying to be very careful
[13:10] in how I phrase this knowing where we're
[13:12] wanting to go with this and what we're
[13:14] wanting to present to you tonight
[13:16] that's just looking at Faith and I
[13:18] appreciate the real uh the attentiveness
[13:21] in the pool tonight it's tremendous
[13:23] those are just mentioning of the power
[13:26] of faith and kind of catch the I've been
[13:28] saying capacity because I'm not wanting
[13:30] to confuse Faith with power
[13:32] but so this is the the principle of
[13:34] Faith or an element of Faith to be able
[13:35] to accomplish something like that
[13:37] and I guess I'll I'll go ahead and say
[13:39] it now
[13:40] that this this power is not this power
[13:43] says there's nothing shall be impossible
[13:45] to you but yet it's not an absolute
[13:47] power owned by by man because God's the
[13:49] one that controls and will either allow
[13:52] or not allow according to his program
[13:54] so there's there's a in program talks
[13:56] about the law of faith in terms of us
[13:57] being able to a Son of God have enough
[13:59] power to create which is a Divine
[14:01] characteristic not just move creation
[14:02] but a Divine characteristic to create a
[14:05] world and go live on it he says but it's
[14:06] controlled by a law and so that same law
[14:09] operates on these parameters where
[14:11] someone's just believing without any
[14:12] hindrance they couldn't do something
[14:14] that would work against God's perfect
[14:16] will
[14:18] and so this I think that hopefully that
[14:21] kind of adds some more context to what
[14:23] we're what God's put in my heart then in
[14:25] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 wanted this
[14:28] just to kind of um hit you with this
[14:30] thought of just how but profound faith
[14:33] is how important it is if that with
[14:36] faith the size of a mustard seed you can
[14:38] move a mountain nothing would be
[14:39] impossible to you and if you have faith
[14:41] and not doubt not only could you curse a
[14:42] fig tree and it would wither immediately
[14:44] but again you could speak to a mountain
[14:45] it could be removed this is two
[14:47] instances where Christ is relating to
[14:49] this El this these elements of faith
[14:51] that could move something in a manner
[14:53] which is contrary to Nature human
[14:55] history and experience then it says in
[14:57] Hebrews 11 6 but but without faith it is
[15:00] impossible to please God that's the hymn
[15:02] that is referenced here but without
[15:04] faith it is impossible to please him so
[15:06] God cannot be and will never be pleased
[15:08] without faith for he that cometh the God
[15:11] must believe that he is and that he is a
[15:13] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[15:15] Him sets forth then a formula or a
[15:17] principle with God that if one has faith
[15:21] and can seek Him believing that he is
[15:23] and that he's a rewarder he'll give to
[15:25] one who seeks kind of it gives us this
[15:28] principle of God to where he loves faith
[15:32] and he will honor faith and he
[15:34] recognizes faith and and it tells us
[15:37] that as Christians and as Believers that
[15:39] the only way that we can ever please God
[15:41] Is by faith and nothing else
[15:43] we don't have some sort of it's not that
[15:46] there's a we're trying to build our
[15:47] resume in high school and doing a lot of
[15:49] extracurricular and I'm part of this
[15:51] society and I'm doing this and I'm doing
[15:52] that because we want to kind of Pat our
[15:54] resume with a lot of extracurricular
[15:56] activities so that when it come to
[15:57] submit something to God he's like well I
[15:59] mean I see here that they believe but
[16:01] whoa look at this over here and
[16:04] impressed with all your extracurriculars
[16:06] no it's just faith is what pleases God
[16:09] and so this faith is in this category
[16:12] faith can move mountains it can do the
[16:13] impossible faith is what pleases God
[16:16] that Faith becomes a very extraordinary
[16:19] as we've used the term in the few
[16:21] Services an extraordinary sense
[16:24] extraordinary capacity if five senses
[16:27] contact this realm five senses of the
[16:29] spirit and we're wanting to delve into a
[16:31] lot more than this Faith realm this
[16:33] Faith element is extraordinary
[16:36] now with that let's kind of
[16:39] rip the needle off the Record and read
[16:41] First Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 2
[16:43] because now we see faith is if I have
[16:46] faith that pleases God and with faith
[16:47] and not doubt I can do all these
[16:49] tremendous things and then Paul says
[16:50] something that just is so on the nose to
[16:53] what we've just read and we know he's
[16:55] speaking about the gift of charity
[16:57] and he says and I know I'm taking this
[16:59] out of a lot much larger reading but I
[17:01] think it it stands on its own tonight
[17:02] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[17:05] understand all Mysteries and all
[17:06] knowledge
[17:07] and though I have all Faith so that I
[17:10] could remove mountains and have not
[17:13] charity I am nothing
[17:16] immediately this acts to me as a
[17:19] boundary to Faith
[17:21] maybe not so much a barrier but a
[17:23] boundary because Paul is saying I could
[17:25] have all the faith but if I don't have
[17:27] charity then I'm nothing
[17:30] all right and when I say boundary it's
[17:32] it's it's it's showing us where Faith
[17:34] ultimately must reside or where it has
[17:36] its perfect placing
[17:38] and and so this kind of becomes this
[17:40] qualifier to win Faith counts and when
[17:43] Faith really matters because he says I
[17:45] can have all faith and then says
[17:47] something that ties us right back to
[17:49] Matthew 17 right back to Matthew 21 and
[17:52] says if I don't have charity then I am
[17:54] nothing
[17:55] so there's some there's some heading
[17:57] there's some proper placing that would
[18:00] take Faith from the place to where it
[18:02] can accomplish so many things in the
[18:05] flesh but then become something
[18:07] substantive and eternal this party says
[18:10] I am nothing he he's saying that I mean
[18:12] I could have the gift of Prophecy and
[18:13] prophesy but that's going to cease and I
[18:15] can have knowledge but that'll cease and
[18:17] I can have faith to move mountains but
[18:19] at the end of the day what have I done
[18:20] I've just maybe raised the sea level and
[18:21] cause a lot of people to lose their
[18:23] beaches
[18:24] right he's just recognizing that what
[18:27] would all that mean at the end of the
[18:28] day if I could have some sort of
[18:30] Supernatural power to do things and it
[18:32] not be governed by a higher power or
[18:35] working According to some other vision
[18:38] because remember how that agape love and
[18:40] you guys are just pulling me right into
[18:42] next Wednesday night but how Agape Love
[18:44] Is Love of a higher intelligence so it's
[18:47] connected with purpose it has something
[18:50] to it and when we're 17 years old and we
[18:52] have a crush and we love somebody we
[18:55] don't we don't think about even what
[18:56] that means or what the consequences are
[18:58] and says all right you love them you
[18:59] want to be with them what does that even
[19:00] mean what's your goal what's your vision
[19:02] I don't know
[19:03] all right it's one talk to him I just
[19:06] love them but I just want to write their
[19:08] name on something hey
[19:10] there's there's no higher intelligence
[19:12] to it it's those base Natures it's just
[19:14] it's a feeling that's related solely to
[19:16] the flesh without really a vision or or
[19:19] some sort of guiding principle that
[19:21] gives it an eternal quality
[19:23] and so he's when he says I am nothing
[19:28] this
[19:29] he's showing that there's there's more
[19:31] to it than just this element of faith
[19:33] that could operate in a way to move a
[19:34] mountain we hope we can see that then in
[19:37] James chapter 2 verses 19 and 20 James
[19:40] puts it in a little bit different
[19:41] perspective he says Thou believest that
[19:43] there is one God thou doest well and I
[19:46] don't think he's being snarky as
[19:47] sometimes we like to say it like good
[19:49] for you what do you want a sticker I
[19:50] think you're saying that's good that's a
[19:51] great start because he that cometh to
[19:53] God must first believe that he is and
[19:55] what you'll find is at least whatever
[19:57] believing this is you do well because
[19:59] you got to have that first
[20:01] if I was if I found somebody who was
[20:04] sick and I asked them if did they
[20:05] believe in Divine Healing and they say
[20:07] I'm not sure what that is and I said
[20:09] well do you believe in God and like no I
[20:11] wouldn't go okay well anyways there's
[20:13] this way I could lay my hands on you and
[20:16] pray for you like I would just kind of
[20:19] skip over the most important part
[20:22] right I'd say well if you don't believe
[20:24] in God let me share with you the the
[20:26] principles of God and things of God and
[20:28] so I hear he's saying that you believe
[20:30] that's good the Devils also believe in
[20:33] tremble
[20:35] now what do I do with this
[20:38] it's not it's not using some other base
[20:40] word about belief it's not saying the
[20:42] devil's suppose or the devil's thing the
[20:44] Devils also believe and tremble uh
[20:47] supposing that there's even a greater
[20:48] depth of understanding with their belief
[20:50] that causes them to fear God and be
[20:52] reverential to God because you believe
[20:54] in God and yet you don't fear him but
[20:56] these believe and tremble at the
[20:58] awesomeness of God
[21:00] and he says but without no obey man that
[21:02] faith without works is dead
[21:04] I realize James chapter 2 is kind of
[21:06] drawing us into a larger understanding
[21:08] of being justified by faith and being
[21:10] justified by works and he says it
[21:13] without uh without any ambiguity and he
[21:16] says it more than once that Faith with
[21:18] no Works
[21:20] ought to be considered dead faith
[21:23] if I could say this way what James is
[21:26] saying is you tell me you say that you
[21:28] believe but absence absent any fruit of
[21:32] that belief I have every right to
[21:33] believe that your faith is not a living
[21:35] faith and that's James is putting it in
[21:39] that way but for him to say this to me
[21:42] it becomes one of these things we're
[21:43] beginning to understand wow there's
[21:45] maybe a lot more to Faith than just well
[21:46] just you know play and Obey right
[21:48] there's more to it than that saying the
[21:50] Devils also believe
[21:52] and that without works faith is dead
[21:54] those are two different statements to me
[21:56] that kind of add to if I have faith all
[21:59] Faith to move mountains and have not
[22:00] charity I'm nothing so there's three
[22:01] different statements related to Faith
[22:03] that kind of add this color to it it's
[22:05] like wow there's a lot to this
[22:08] and so there's some level of believing
[22:11] or some level of faith
[22:14] taking this from James chapter 2 that is
[22:18] not Anchored In
[22:20] an eternally sealed soul
[22:22] again I'm being very deliberate the way
[22:24] that I say this because if Devils can
[22:26] believe and Devil's incapable of of
[22:29] Salvation incapable of being sealed but
[22:31] yet they're capable capable on some
[22:33] level of belief uh and conviction of
[22:36] something and Paul saying that I can
[22:39] have all Faith to move mountains and
[22:40] still be nothing and he talks along that
[22:43] lines in a number of different places it
[22:44] this is maybe I'm saying it knowing that
[22:47] this is true that there's a level of
[22:49] faith that is not necessarily anchored
[22:52] in a soul that has been sealed by the
[22:54] Holy Ghost
[22:55] can we recognize that
[22:58] and so faith can operate in Supernatural
[23:01] healing
[23:02] faith can operate in manifestations
[23:04] faith can operate in demonstrations but
[23:07] be on a different level than the faith
[23:10] that Paul is talking about that could be
[23:12] joined with Charity or the faith that
[23:15] James is talking about that would be
[23:16] Faith with works
[23:18] and and and even the faith the ultimate
[23:21] faith of divine faith
[23:24] and with respect to Faith and I'm sure
[23:26] and if you have thought of this you
[23:28] could you could throw a hand in there
[23:29] you could give me a hearty amen the more
[23:32] that we read our Bibles the more that we
[23:33] listen to the word of God we find that
[23:35] Faith operates in different ways in
[23:37] different instances
[23:39] and that there are different processes
[23:41] that achieve similar results and yet
[23:43] it's coming from different perspectives
[23:44] and there's different ways that Faith
[23:46] Works and so there's a way that faith
[23:48] can work on one person and then faith
[23:51] can work a little bit differently on
[23:53] another and achieve the same results and
[23:55] we maybe can try to compare and say well
[23:57] what's our takeaway is there anything we
[23:58] could take away from this and you might
[24:00] find yourself saying that well the way
[24:02] this happened here and the way that
[24:03] happened there I can't even reconcile it
[24:06] but at the end of the day what you
[24:07] realize is that there was some promise
[24:09] that was made there was some Faith
[24:11] directed towards that promise and each
[24:13] one received what they wanted on the
[24:14] other side of it
[24:16] but different processes and different
[24:18] ways that it works
[24:20] now in Matthew chapter 10 verses 1 to 4
[24:23] this is taking a step forward now
[24:26] in this
[24:27] examination of Faith this is in Jesus
[24:30] calls his 12 disciples and when he had
[24:32] called unto him his twelve disciples he
[24:34] gave them power against unclean spirits
[24:37] this is Matthew chapter 10. you know how
[24:39] many chapters are in Matthew this is
[24:40] this is not in the book of Acts this is
[24:43] early on when Jesus is Calling his
[24:45] disciples you'll see how early it is
[24:46] he's doing this before we know their
[24:48] names in in total it says he gave them
[24:51] power against unclean spirits to cast
[24:53] them out and to heal all manner of
[24:55] sicknesses and all manner of diseases
[24:57] this is power given to the 12 disciples
[25:02] who have not been regenerated by the
[25:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[25:07] now the names of the 12 apostles are and
[25:09] it gives us these 12 Apostles
[25:11] and I will skip in case my lisp raises
[25:13] its head to verse 4 and it says in verse
[25:16] 4 Simon the Canaanite and Judas Iscariot
[25:19] who also betrayed him thanks Matthew
[25:21] thank you for letting us know for sure
[25:22] this is who it is
[25:25] kind of like what John does they all
[25:27] kind of throw Judas under the bus real
[25:29] early on you know the one who was betray
[25:31] him this guy
[25:33] but what's clear is that he is included
[25:37] in the twelve that have received power
[25:39] against unclean spirits to cast them out
[25:42] to heal all manner of sicknesses and all
[25:44] manner of diseases
[25:46] so this we know that the Bible says that
[25:48] to want a gift of faith to another gift
[25:50] of healing and so there are and I and I
[25:53] could say this confidently according to
[25:55] way the brother Branham teaches this
[25:56] that there are those who can have
[25:58] measures of gifts and this is where
[26:00] gifts as we said on Sunday gifts are
[26:02] different than signs but these gifts can
[26:06] be operated in a person's life and it's
[26:08] a god-given gift it's a gift that's
[26:10] there but yet due to a lack of
[26:12] sanctification or a lack of an
[26:14] experience or even a lack of placing
[26:16] that gift can be used but yet that
[26:19] person themselves ultimately as Paul
[26:21] says be a Castaway
[26:23] ultimately uh end up in ruin and and
[26:27] unbelief but yet can be used to do many
[26:29] powerful things Judas would be a
[26:32] tremendous example of this in that he
[26:35] has given power over Uncle spirits to
[26:37] cast them out heal all manner of
[26:38] sicknesses in all manner of diseases
[26:40] now based upon the reading of the
[26:43] scripture anybody could argue well it
[26:45] never says that Judas actually did it
[26:48] and so if you just if that's the
[26:50] approach you want to take that's fine
[26:52] but your name's actually not in the
[26:53] Bible either so
[26:56] in Luke chapter 9 it says this and then
[26:58] he called his 12 disciples together and
[27:00] gave them power and authority over all
[27:03] devils and to cure diseases now again
[27:07] this is this is the companion scripture
[27:09] to that whether or not Judas ever
[27:12] actually did it he had the power because
[27:13] the scripture is unequivocal about it
[27:16] Judas had been given the power to heal
[27:19] to have authority over devils and to
[27:21] cure diseases he's included in that in
[27:23] Matthew chapter 10 power against unclean
[27:25] spirits to cast them out to heal all
[27:26] manner diseases and sicknesses this is a
[27:29] language that looks a lot like what it's
[27:31] going to be like whenever that he gives
[27:33] the signs to the church right and we'll
[27:36] find this again in just a moment in
[27:37] another place in Luke where he's in just
[27:39] the very next chapter here after Luke
[27:41] chapter nine he's speaking a language
[27:43] that's that shows the same kind of
[27:45] manifestations in a group of people that
[27:48] believe if I could say believe with the
[27:50] air quotes Believe In Christ or near
[27:52] Christ being commissioned and given the
[27:54] authority of Christ go forward to do
[27:56] many wonderful works but on another
[27:58] level it's not that Soul faith that we
[28:02] would want to have for our lives
[28:05] and so in verse Luke chapter 9 verse 1
[28:07] they've been given power verse 6 and
[28:09] they departed and went through the towns
[28:11] preaching the gospel and healing
[28:14] everywhere
[28:15] Luke chapter 9 verse 6 and they departed
[28:17] went through the towns preaching the
[28:19] gospel and healing everywhere what
[28:21] happened they did it
[28:23] the Bible's telling us as it says in
[28:24] Matthew 10 he gave him the power now in
[28:27] Luke chapter 9 verse 6 they went through
[28:29] towns preaching the gospel and healing
[28:31] everywhere so they preached the gospel
[28:33] signs were Fallen this is a pattern that
[28:35] is operating within the lives of the
[28:38] disciples who've been called by Christ
[28:39] and this is this has to be according to
[28:43] and and I know if you say well brother
[28:45] Aaron you're making some assumptions
[28:46] there if you're students of the message
[28:48] you know exactly where we're drawing
[28:49] these things from there's some
[28:51] acceptance by these disciples there's
[28:54] some Faith to whom would we go and
[28:56] there's some Awakening of a greater
[28:58] desire and a supernatural and they
[28:59] become his disciples and they're willing
[29:01] to take him at his word and to go
[29:04] forward believing that they have
[29:05] authority and they accept that they have
[29:07] this Authority and they accept that they
[29:08] can cast out devils and they accept that
[29:10] they can cure diseases and guess what
[29:12] the Bible says they went through towns
[29:13] preaching the gospel healing everywhere
[29:16] so it's not just Jesus that's getting
[29:18] the crowd stirred up at this point
[29:20] very next chapter it's not just the 12
[29:22] that have it but in Luke chapter 10
[29:23] verse 1 and after these things the Lord
[29:25] appointed the other 70 also and sent
[29:29] them to and two before his face into
[29:30] every city and place whether he himself
[29:32] would come
[29:34] so he points
[29:36] the 70 to do the same thing I thought
[29:39] maybe I had another scripture here so I
[29:40] just need to check and make sure I
[29:41] didn't accidentally uh
[29:44] strip out some of this there's they had
[29:46] so much I apologize if I'm not really on
[29:50] point today it's been a very difficult
[29:51] week as a family dealing with this
[29:53] sickness
[29:55] and and so Jesus now in Luke chapter 10
[29:59] is sending for 70 more laborers into the
[30:01] field in the same way that he had
[30:03] commissioned the disciples to do it and
[30:05] so we're not
[30:07] um what they say now if you want to look
[30:08] at verse 17 this is where we'll find
[30:11] this statement and I think it becomes
[30:13] very clear to us that they had been
[30:15] given the same power that the disciples
[30:17] had in Luke chapter 10 verse 17 he
[30:19] appointed seven so you have the 12 now
[30:21] you have a 70 and some places I read
[30:22] where they say they're 72. uh they
[30:25] joined the 72 to it it says 70 return
[30:27] again with Joy saying Lord even the
[30:30] devils are subject unto us through thy
[30:32] name
[30:33] so it's not just the 12 disciples it's
[30:36] not just like the original Clique right
[30:38] the guy it's not just the guys in the
[30:40] upper crust and Christ cast system that
[30:42] we try to we try to impose in churches
[30:44] now it's not like well you got the 12
[30:46] and they're the Legacy families and and
[30:48] they're they're but now even the 70
[30:51] right the late comers
[30:53] they're able to do the same thing and
[30:54] maybe they're like
[30:56] we're doing it too just like these other
[30:58] guys and that's their Testament devils
[31:00] are subject unto us through thy name so
[31:03] never get in your mind that this was a
[31:04] kind of a one-off show where they were
[31:06] out invoking some other name or
[31:08] operating According to some other power
[31:09] but it's Christ commissioning them
[31:11] giving them the authority them operating
[31:14] in some sort of conviction and belief
[31:16] that this is the correct Authority and
[31:18] then they can invoke his name and use
[31:20] the name of Christ to cast out demons
[31:24] and now this is Jesus now amplifies what
[31:29] was happening from verse 1 to verse 17
[31:31] because he tells us what was taking
[31:33] place even though they had yet as it
[31:35] bragged about it and again remember
[31:36] Matthew chapter 7 meaning will come unto
[31:38] me on that day and how it it espoused
[31:41] many great exploits of what they
[31:43] accomplished but yet they're not known
[31:44] by him
[31:46] so he says in verse 18 I beheld Satan as
[31:49] lightning fall from Heaven
[31:52] it's like wait what you know we're out
[31:55] there Cashing Out Devils I behold Satan
[31:58] fall from Heaven as Lightning verse 19.
[32:02] did you guys ever hear back when Barack
[32:04] Obama was elected president I think I
[32:07] was actually
[32:07] uh tricked into saying it over the
[32:10] pulpit by somebody but the the actual
[32:12] reading in there is I saw in one of the
[32:14] languages is I saw Satan fall from
[32:17] Heaven as Barack Obama
[32:20] I'm not saying it is
[32:22] but could it be
[32:24] it's just interesting how people can do
[32:26] stuff like that Lord forgive me
[32:29] and it says in verse I mean I wasn't
[32:30] serious when I shared it but it was just
[32:32] an odd coincidence I didn't believe it
[32:34] now it says in verse 19 it says behold I
[32:38] give unto you power to tread on serpents
[32:40] and scorpions
[32:41] and over all the power of the enemy
[32:44] and nothing shall by any means hurt you
[32:47] this this is what had been demonstrated
[32:49] to them and this is the power that's
[32:51] being conferred upon them he says I give
[32:53] unto you power to tread on serpents and
[32:55] scorpions and overall power of the enemy
[32:56] and nothing shall End by any means hurt
[32:58] you what does that sound like you shall
[33:00] take up deadly serpents you shall drink
[33:03] deadly things and it shall not harm you
[33:04] there's this idea that man there's a
[33:07] power that he's giving the believer
[33:08] giving these disciples that there's
[33:10] there you may have attacks you may have
[33:13] things that come against you and there
[33:14] may be pitfalls and trials and things
[33:16] that you come against and preach in the
[33:18] gospel but I'll look out after y'all
[33:19] care for you
[33:21] but then he says notwithstanding in this
[33:24] Rejoice not even though this may be
[33:26] within your ability because I give it
[33:29] unto you I give you power
[33:31] but don't Rejoice that the spirits are
[33:33] subject unto you verse 20
[33:34] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not
[33:36] rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[33:39] unto you do not rejoice because you can
[33:41] tread on serpents and scorpions do not
[33:42] rejoice that you can handle snakes do
[33:44] not rejoice that you have power of the
[33:46] enemy do not rejoice at Nothing by any
[33:47] means can hurt you but rather Rejoice
[33:49] because your names are written in heaven
[33:54] Jesus breaks open these levels of faith
[33:57] and introduces election
[34:01] he's just completely he he's basically
[34:03] told us this that as he's already
[34:06] expressed and he does express it as
[34:08] Ministry that a lot of people can
[34:10] operate in a realm in this natural realm
[34:12] where these lower I say lower but these
[34:15] Powers these influences from beneath are
[34:16] actually higher powers in terms of human
[34:18] strength but the coming from beneath
[34:21] that a person could take their faith and
[34:23] move themselves above these demon powers
[34:26] and draw make them subject and he's
[34:28] saying to rejoice and that alone will
[34:31] miss the mark because the real place of
[34:34] rejoicing is that your name is written
[34:35] in heaven
[34:38] and so Jesus is showing us that there's
[34:41] levels of Faith or even if we can put it
[34:43] this way areas where God can operate
[34:45] because I give you power you can tread
[34:48] on serpents you can do these things
[34:51] and Judas as we go back to Matthew
[34:53] chapter 10 and Luke chapter 9 Judas and
[34:56] the 70
[34:57] could operate the power of Christ
[34:59] through a faith
[35:02] believing that they had it they could go
[35:03] forth and exercise it but then Judas was
[35:06] a son the son of perdition
[35:09] the 70 eventually we know walk away
[35:13] right
[35:14] so then what faith did they have
[35:17] what faith were they operating under or
[35:19] or what's upholding their faith and
[35:22] what's keeping their faith afloat and uh
[35:24] how is it that Peter with seemingly no
[35:27] other uh qualifications or abilities
[35:29] than Judas or even these other seventy
[35:31] when the seventy walk away and he says
[35:33] are you going to go awesome Peter's like
[35:34] where am I going to go
[35:37] there's something this faith is still
[35:40] holding in a different realm for peter
[35:42] than it did for these other 70. now
[35:44] before we get too crazy with Peter's
[35:46] Faith he then just a little bit later
[35:48] tries to kill a guy with the sword and
[35:50] then denies Christ completely
[35:53] all right
[35:54] but there's still something about this
[35:56] faith that uh that Judas had and these
[35:59] 70 had that begs the question what kind
[36:01] of Faith do they have
[36:03] in Blasphemous names I'm just I'm going
[36:06] to draw a few statements from this
[36:07] sermon
[36:08] to make this point because I think even
[36:11] despite or without the greater picture
[36:15] that he's painting with respect to the
[36:17] Statue of a perfect man in certain
[36:18] virtues and building up that person
[36:20] either as a a human image of those
[36:24] things or a Divine image uh these
[36:27] principles stand the same so I think I
[36:29] can just kind of pull these out because
[36:30] they he makes these statements in
[36:33] different ways other places and
[36:34] blasphemous names he says you see there
[36:36] are two kinds of faith
[36:38] there are two kinds of virtue as I had
[36:41] the other day two different kinds of
[36:42] knowledge two different kinds of
[36:43] temperance what is he referring to what
[36:45] we call the statue of a perfect man add
[36:47] to your faith and he's building these up
[36:49] now he's acknowledging that there can be
[36:52] a whole nother a whole nother statue
[36:56] not a stature but a whole other image
[36:59] having a form of godliness that is not
[37:03] the kind that we ultimately want or
[37:05] should have but he's acknowledging that
[37:08] it's there a faith a virtue and
[37:09] knowledge Temperance there's different
[37:12] kinds he's saying
[37:13] in the message of the Queen of Sheba he
[37:15] says there is a genuine faith
[37:17] and this will this kind of gives pulls
[37:19] back the curtain a little bit on how my
[37:21] mind is thinking about processes and how
[37:23] faith can work in one channel faith can
[37:25] work in another Channel but there's an
[37:27] ultimate Channel where the believer is
[37:29] he says there's a genuine Faith but you
[37:31] must come into the real channel of God
[37:33] to have that genuine Faith so there's a
[37:35] way to come through a channel he said
[37:37] there's human Faith then there's Faith
[37:39] Of God I think we could look at that in
[37:41] the scripture even in Romans it says it
[37:43] doesn't make the faith of God of no
[37:45] effect so there's a faith of God there's
[37:46] a faith of Jesus Christ there's the
[37:48] faith of God's elect those are
[37:50] designations about faith that have
[37:52] achieved something different if I could
[37:54] even say on a higher level
[37:55] than just kind of a believing or
[37:57] acknowledging something so there's a
[37:59] human faith and then there is Faith Of
[38:01] God he says and you must have a Godly
[38:02] Faith to believe now then to have Godly
[38:05] Faith you must have the mind of Christ
[38:06] in you so Godly faith in that way is the
[38:09] mind of Christ it's speaking speaking of
[38:12] something
[38:13] very particular a genuine faith and then
[38:16] a human Faith so we could say there's a
[38:18] human faith and there's a Divine Faith
[38:20] there's a there's a genuine faith that
[38:22] God we say is the faith of God but then
[38:24] yet there still is a human faith
[38:26] and if I could say this I'm being very
[38:28] careful tonight there's still something
[38:31] powerful about human faith
[38:35] so there's two different kinds of faith
[38:37] if I could just throw some terms out
[38:38] there there's a human faith we might
[38:40] find it to be a mental Faith an
[38:42] intellectual Faith or emotional Faith
[38:43] that's a human faith that would have and
[38:46] I guess I am going to have to go a
[38:48] little bit further than I wanted to
[38:49] tonight but maybe it's just kind of
[38:50] present the image and we'll reinforce it
[38:52] later with the statements from the
[38:54] message of the hour in the scripture
[38:55] that there is a faith that one could
[38:57] have that would merely be one that would
[39:00] be in their mind or their Spirit their
[39:02] emotions of well I believe
[39:04] and and that can reside in that realm
[39:07] alone and that would be mental Faith
[39:08] intellectual Faith an emotional faith
[39:12] but then there's a soul faith that
[39:14] speaks of a faith that has been sealed
[39:16] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[39:18] that sense and if you want to kind of
[39:20] dig into these things on your own and
[39:22] begin to just Ponder these things and
[39:24] pray about them and and really seek a
[39:26] perfect understanding of these things
[39:28] that Faith that's in the soul it's in a
[39:30] soul that's been sealed off to where
[39:32] there is only one Channel One Source in
[39:36] the soul in that's faith
[39:38] faith alone
[39:40] so then what is how does a person who
[39:43] has not the Holy Ghost who does not have
[39:45] the new birth experience which is the
[39:46] Seal of God which is the baptism that
[39:48] goes upon the soul because the baptism
[39:50] goes is the Seal of your faith believing
[39:52] the word of God what does a person who
[39:54] does not have that seal who can actually
[39:57] operate faith and Achieve results what
[40:00] faith are they operating
[40:05] take the name of Jesus don't want to
[40:08] know what it is I'm not just going to
[40:09] end there but it's good to think about
[40:10] it
[40:12] Judas was not elect
[40:15] so the only faith that he had or could
[40:18] have ever had was a human faith in
[40:21] Divine things in a Divine promise
[40:24] in something that God Jesus said that
[40:26] you had so he could take this
[40:27] intellectual faith and there's certain
[40:29] alignment and there's a certain
[40:31] alignment that he could have that forese
[40:33] and he could operate in that channel but
[40:35] that that's not that's not the kind of
[40:37] faith that can stand on its own
[40:39] because after all it's human
[40:41] and so if you can have two different
[40:43] kinds of Faith a human Faith which is
[40:44] mental intellectual emotional
[40:47] and then you can have Divine faith
[40:51] these are different faiths
[40:53] they work in different measures they
[40:54] work in different processes they can
[40:56] achieve the same but ultimately they
[40:58] achieve different results
[41:01] you could have someone who has
[41:02] intellectual faith and could seem to
[41:04] have a life that is much more dynamic
[41:08] than that of one who has Divine faith
[41:10] and one comes up in the resurrection and
[41:13] the other one's left for judgment
[41:15] in Romans chapter 12 verse 3 and 2
[41:17] Thessalonians chapter 3 verse two two
[41:19] scriptures just to show us that God
[41:21] deals out measures of faith it says for
[41:24] I say through the grace given unto me to
[41:26] every man that is among you not to think
[41:27] of himself more highly than he ought to
[41:29] think but to think soberly according
[41:31] Romans 12 3 according as God hath dealt
[41:34] to every man The Measure of Faith if we
[41:37] look at this within the body of Christ
[41:38] we could accept that there's some that
[41:40] have greater measures of Faith they work
[41:41] in that realm it's a gift of faith it's
[41:43] a gift of prayer I think I mentioned
[41:45] this before but brother Andrew your
[41:46] grandfather brother Fulcher uh has a
[41:48] tremendous gift of prayer and a gift of
[41:50] faith even to where brother Berry told
[41:52] me one time if he was ever sick he'd
[41:53] tell brother Fulcher and he'd want that
[41:55] man to pray for him because he gets
[41:56] results when he prays and I'll say this
[41:59] I brother Andrew to me has demonstrated
[42:01] someone who has that kind of faith to
[42:03] where I've found in my life he says he's
[42:05] praying for me there's there's results
[42:06] that are immediately achieved and people
[42:08] can have that they have a certain
[42:10] measures of faith and so God deals to
[42:12] every man The Measure of Faith so we
[42:14] realize measures there's there's certain
[42:16] anointings or gifts or callings and they
[42:18] all have to operate within this
[42:20] particular certain ways and certain
[42:21] processes so that says God gives Every
[42:23] Man a measure then Paul says in second
[42:26] Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 2 and that
[42:28] we may be delivered from unreasonable
[42:30] and wicked men for all men have not
[42:33] faith
[42:35] and so there are those who are faithless
[42:38] they have no faith they there's no faith
[42:40] within them at all if I could just kind
[42:42] of seed your thoughts a little bit there
[42:44] are believers make Believers and
[42:46] unbelievers the unbelievers don't really
[42:48] have any semblance of Faith whatsoever
[42:51] at all and then a make-believer has
[42:53] Faith but it's in a different realm than
[42:56] the believer who has faith
[42:59] and so this is the Bible's just shown us
[43:01] there can be measures and there can be
[43:02] those who don't have any faith at all
[43:05] now coming back to Blasphemous names
[43:08] and I'm trying I'm trying a new approach
[43:11] I don't I don't know what time it is
[43:13] a totally new approach probably not a
[43:16] good idea to do it on a Wednesday but
[43:18] um I don't know what time it is and
[43:19] don't tell me
[43:21] so in the sermon Blasphemous names
[43:23] says in the biggest part of our faith is
[43:25] mental Faith so there is a mental faith
[43:28] and I think it's been good for me to
[43:30] recognize and reading all these
[43:32] instances where brother I was talking
[43:33] about faith to see that there's ways
[43:34] that he refers to the faith a faith same
[43:37] way we would take it in the Bible and
[43:39] then that same word can be used in a
[43:40] different context and we know it's not
[43:42] talking about the same thing
[43:43] and so there is a mental faith and that
[43:46] would be your own faith it'd be human
[43:48] faith not just something that you
[43:50] possess has been that has been given to
[43:53] you by God in the soul realm but it
[43:54] would be this emotional intellectual
[43:56] mental Faith he says the biggest part of
[43:58] our faith is mental faith and then this
[44:00] is so beautiful by hearing the word it
[44:02] brings us to a mental recognition of God
[44:05] so that's what the preaching the word
[44:07] first is to do we don't sit here in in
[44:10] the pews and then we're kind of
[44:11] hypnotized and then the word bypasses
[44:14] all sensory input as far as the mind the
[44:17] hearing the emotions and all those other
[44:19] channels and we just kind of get in this
[44:21] state of hypnosis and then we say
[44:23] receive the word and your soul goes hey
[44:26] hey
[44:27] right it's not how it works there's a
[44:30] wrestling that takes place in the mind
[44:32] the ears hearing the mind is wrestling
[44:34] with it and the preach and the word of
[44:35] God kind of swings your mental mind your
[44:38] mental thinking your mental believing
[44:39] your mental recognition it swings your
[44:42] mind to accept and to believe the things
[44:44] of God
[44:45] remember that that's what the preaching
[44:47] the word does it's going to swing your
[44:48] mind so he says the preacher word brings
[44:50] us to a mental recognition of God but if
[44:52] this this Holy Spirit now this Capstone
[44:54] coming from above brother if it ever
[44:57] strikes this then there's Godly
[44:59] spiritual faith
[45:01] that wouldn't be in this this realm
[45:03] necessarily it's in a different place it
[45:05] says then what does faith do that Faith
[45:07] recognizes only the word no matter what
[45:09] anything else says it only recognizes
[45:11] the word that's when faith has gone from
[45:13] the head to the heart or the spirit to
[45:15] the soul sealed in there by the baptism
[45:17] he goes and then now that faith is
[45:20] beating and the only thing that can give
[45:21] it life is the word
[45:23] only the only the only thing that can
[45:25] come in there is the word the devil
[45:26] can't even get to it he's going how can
[45:28] I get in that Soul how can I get in
[45:30] there he doesn't know it he can't do it
[45:32] he can't bring the word he can't
[45:33] impersonate the word he can't touch that
[45:35] soul brother Brandon kind of amplifies
[45:37] through scripture in the beginning there
[45:38] was a word and the Word was with God and
[45:40] the Word was God and the word is still
[45:41] God the word was made flesh and dwelt
[45:43] Among Us and when the word itself is
[45:45] poured into our faith our mental Faith
[45:47] becomes a spiritual Revelation and upon
[45:50] that this Foundation I'll build my
[45:51] church you don't get the Revelation in
[45:54] here you get the Revelation down here
[45:57] not upon a mental conception of church
[45:59] joining a mental conception of that but
[46:00] upon the Revelation when them streams of
[46:03] Grace is poured into that mental faith
[46:05] that you've got
[46:07] so there's a place where our mental
[46:09] Faith becomes anointed in the soul Realm
[46:12] by the powers of God and he says he
[46:15] continuing the same sermon this is
[46:16] skipping quite a bit here though so I
[46:18] put it in a different slide that Faith
[46:20] only knows the word that's real
[46:21] spiritual Faith you see that's right it
[46:23] only knows the word that's that Soul
[46:25] faith
[46:26] it's a Divine faith that that was number
[46:29] one number one coming to your mental
[46:31] Faith right here comes the Holy Spirit
[46:34] coming down in your mental Faith making
[46:35] it a spiritual Faith then the spiritual
[46:37] Faith only recognizes the word now
[46:41] kind of this uh recognizing that someone
[46:44] could try to build themselves in a
[46:45] particular image but it's not until the
[46:46] word comes that you actually have that
[46:48] real faith
[46:50] Foundation Faith otherwise brother Bram
[46:51] said when he preaches statue of perfect
[46:53] man you're a blackbird putting peacock
[46:55] feathers in
[46:56] because you don't have the life you're
[46:58] this what he's talking about here it's a
[47:00] mental conception of Faith trying to
[47:01] build yourself up into the image having
[47:04] a form of godliness but having not
[47:06] having the power of Revelation to
[47:08] transform mental faith into the Bedrock
[47:11] of spiritual revelation
[47:14] so that's another way of putting it
[47:15] where brother Brown is saying that
[47:16] there's a mental Faith but then there is
[47:18] a Divine there's a spiritual Faith
[47:20] that's not built up in the head but
[47:22] built up in a soul
[47:25] and
[47:28] these are kind of just pieces that I'm
[47:30] putting out there
[47:31] so in first Timothy chapter 5 verse 12.
[47:36] and there's a number of different
[47:37] statements that we could have pointed to
[47:39] tonight especially scriptures just to
[47:42] see kind of the whole the vast
[47:45] uh
[47:47] survey of faith in the different ways
[47:49] that it's referred to
[47:51] but in first Timothy chapter 5 verse 12
[47:55] just want to focus on this phrase having
[47:57] damnation as he refers to these women he
[47:59] says because they have cast off their
[48:02] first faith
[48:04] now if you if you have some initial
[48:07] faith
[48:08] and you have a belief and you have a
[48:10] conviction and if Paul says there's a
[48:12] certain pattern behavior or certain
[48:13] things that can happen where you could
[48:15] take that faith and cast it off you have
[48:18] an ability to cast it off immediately
[48:19] puts it within the Realms that you have
[48:21] control over
[48:22] it puts this faith in a place to where
[48:24] it's something that was temporary
[48:27] something that was not permanent
[48:29] I'm realizing now I did
[48:31] um
[48:32] I did kind of chop chop my notes up a
[48:34] little bit and cut them very very short
[48:36] and so I thought I had some references
[48:39] some scriptures and references to the
[48:41] temporary nature of this intellectual
[48:42] Faith but maybe we'll have to pick it up
[48:44] later it says having damnation because
[48:46] they have cast off their first Faith
[48:48] what faith would that be
[48:50] that mental faith the emotional Faith
[48:53] the intellectual faith that faith will
[48:55] fail that faith is temper that Faith was
[48:57] exists within the ability of man and
[48:59] man's fortitude and discipline and
[49:03] whatever factors can work Upon A man
[49:04] mentally and physically
[49:06] and then in second Timothy Chapter 2
[49:08] Verse 18 again he says who concerning uh
[49:11] the truth have aired saying that the
[49:13] resurrection is passed already and by
[49:15] means of this false Doctrine it says and
[49:18] overthrow the faith of some
[49:21] so you have some that can cast off their
[49:23] first Faith their first believing their
[49:25] first convictions their first uh um uh
[49:28] confidence and then there's others who
[49:30] by means of a wind or false Doctrine can
[49:33] have their faith overthrown now what
[49:36] faith was that was it a human Faith or
[49:39] was it a Divine faith
[49:44] they have cast off their first phase
[49:46] Faith or their faith has been overthrown
[49:49] this would be clearly I say clearly but
[49:52] I think it's and I'm not trying to just
[49:53] use the The Logical conclusion here
[49:57] but it's not one that's sealed
[50:00] right it's their own faith
[50:02] if it was their own faith that they had
[50:04] in the faith of God their own faith that
[50:06] they had in a faith the old Faith they
[50:07] had in real Supernatural things what was
[50:10] undone is not the faith of God or the
[50:12] faith of God's elector the faith is
[50:14] being that life or that ecstasy that
[50:16] augmented reality that invisible
[50:18] Dimension uh and that Sixth Sense this
[50:20] is another sense altogether that has
[50:23] been overthrown that was of the
[50:25] humankind
[50:26] he says our biggest part of our faith is
[50:28] mental faith that component is what they
[50:31] had initially but it had never been by
[50:33] Revelation transformed and galvanized
[50:37] into Revel real faith
[50:39] and so faith in the Bible
[50:42] is that that Greek word pestis is
[50:44] translated to assurance
[50:47] to believe to Fidelity to believe
[50:50] so this is what faith is it's the
[50:52] conviction of the truth of anything
[50:55] it's a belief
[50:57] it's trust or confident confidence
[51:02] so we can say faith and we could talk
[51:04] about confidence and we could talk about
[51:06] assurance
[51:07] and faithfulness
[51:09] and that believe can merely can be
[51:12] merely mental
[51:14] that assurance that conviction that
[51:17] conviction of a truth that belief that
[51:19] trust that confidence can be
[51:20] intellectual
[51:22] towards the word
[51:24] it's just uh as brother Madam says a big
[51:27] part of our faith is mental we hear the
[51:29] word it brings us into recognition of
[51:31] God he said well we didn't even know
[51:33] there was such a thing as that or I
[51:34] didn't know this and so there's this
[51:35] part where in the head the head kind of
[51:37] says okay yeah I didn't know that they
[51:39] can accept that they could believe in it
[51:41] if somebody never believed in the
[51:43] Supernatural and they witnessed the
[51:45] supernatural take place whether cancer
[51:47] fall off and and I remember having
[51:50] friends of mine uh testify of their
[51:54] their their parents or their
[51:55] grandparents being in meetings and
[51:58] witnessing they remember in particular
[52:00] this one brother saying my grandfather
[52:01] was in at a meeting and the Brother Band
[52:05] told everyone to Bow their head and and
[52:07] he he kind of just was peaking because
[52:09] this boy had come up with a mangled limb
[52:12] and and he said he said I was looking I
[52:15] was looking right at he said he said his
[52:17] grandfather said he closed eyes and
[52:19] looked right at it because he wanted to
[52:20] see whether or not this was real or not
[52:21] he said he watched with his own eyes
[52:23] brother banham pray for him and the leg
[52:25] straightened out swell out turn around
[52:27] and go straight
[52:29] now if you didn't believe in a miracle
[52:30] and you didn't believe in Divine Healing
[52:32] and you believed your senses you'd say
[52:34] well you can't tell me that ain't real
[52:37] because that's real
[52:38] you know the story of even the the the
[52:41] um the I want to say Infidel but I think
[52:43] there's maybe another way brother
[52:44] Brandon referred to him how under that
[52:45] tree that day and he was talking about
[52:47] it wasn't really much of a Believer but
[52:49] he wanted to know what was it that told
[52:51] that man what was wrong with that lady
[52:52] say there's something that happens that
[52:54] get inside the mind you start waking up
[52:56] to these things and you want to kind of
[52:57] figure him out and so that can still yet
[53:00] be in that intellectual Realm
[53:02] now let me lay something heavy on you
[53:05] then
[53:06] believe then can be towards the right
[53:09] things and still be intellectual
[53:12] therefore belief can be towards the
[53:15] wrong things and be intellectual
[53:18] and you can have a mental faith and a
[53:21] lot of different things that have
[53:22] nothing to do with the word of God
[53:23] that's what a lot of people place in
[53:25] science their faith is in science
[53:28] you have to have faith to believe that
[53:31] whenever they found something or
[53:32] whatever and they put out this big huge
[53:34] Journal article saying we found out now
[53:36] that T-Rexes actually had purple
[53:39] feathers
[53:40] in the absence of anything that
[53:43] demonstrates that they actually had
[53:44] purple feathers and all the scientists
[53:45] are like they had purple feathers
[53:48] right they believe it then it's like yes
[53:51] purple feathers and they all accept it
[53:53] how old is the world well it's billions
[53:55] and billions of years old where did you
[53:57] find the clock
[53:59] if there's a there's a measure of faith
[54:01] that they use to accept those things and
[54:04] that's intellectual faith
[54:07] this kind of that kind of believe in
[54:09] that kind of faith can be even the
[54:10] carnal things
[54:12] and so this is I'm going to end on this
[54:14] so a sinner
[54:16] someone who is not a Christian someone
[54:18] who is not even before necessarily a
[54:19] Believer can intellectually believe
[54:22] enough to come to a place of healing
[54:25] intellectually believe enough to come to
[54:27] a place to receive an anointing to feel
[54:29] the power of God have an experience and
[54:33] that experience be felt physically and
[54:35] emotionally and even be demonstrated in
[54:39] physical healing Divine Healing God is
[54:41] the Healer and they experience healing
[54:43] and it all come up from a place of
[54:46] intellectually believing enough
[54:50] and you'll have to if if you're familiar
[54:52] with statements brother Branham says
[54:53] about intellectual faith and mental
[54:55] believing and those things just if you
[54:58] could
[54:59] uh I mean have faith in me
[55:03] that that there'll be there'll be some
[55:04] things that could be added to that to
[55:06] realize what realm that's operating in
[55:08] and how the person can believe
[55:11] and God will honor that faith
[55:13] and he honors that alone
[55:15] he hasn't sealed the soul he's not conf
[55:18] he's not vindicating anybody he's not
[55:20] given any sort of approval to lifestyle
[55:23] or theology or doctrine it's just
[55:25] something that God has said and it's put
[55:26] it in Motion in this world that a human
[55:28] being can tap into it and get results
[55:30] from it
[55:33] even to the point to where there are
[55:35] those and there's different ones that
[55:37] were so dynamic in Divine Healing they
[55:40] were called Divine Healers
[55:42] because they could take a group of
[55:44] people and so convince them over a
[55:45] period of time that the word of God was
[55:47] true and he was a Healer that there
[55:48] could be spontaneous healings in a
[55:50] congregation and people be healed
[55:52] instantly and they received their
[55:54] physical healing by someone who's
[55:56] tapping into an element of faith and
[55:58] principles of faith and they would go
[56:00] right out and who know who knows how
[56:01] long they would remain healed but there
[56:03] was discernible evidential measurable
[56:07] results that took place in a realm that
[56:11] was in the body or the spirit
[56:14] so this is the quote that we started
[56:15] this entire sub series on this a matter
[56:18] of faith and question and answers
[56:19] brother Brandon says
[56:21] and healing is based upon faith
[56:24] not upon now righteous how righteous you
[56:27] are
[56:29] how good you are
[56:31] how much you keep the Commandments or
[56:33] whatever it is it's based solemnly on
[56:36] faith
[56:38] all things are possible to them that
[56:40] believe
[56:41] it's not based upon how good you are and
[56:44] this is a statement he makes in a number
[56:45] of different ways
[56:47] to make this point I've seen prostitutes
[56:51] come to the platform
[56:53] this person is not sealed with the Holy
[56:54] Ghost he's using prostitute to refer to
[56:56] the fact that this individual does not
[56:57] have the Holy Ghost they're Sinners I've
[56:59] seen them come to the platform and be
[57:00] instantly healed
[57:02] and a sainted woman brother Brahm
[57:03] another place tells a real Christian
[57:05] real genuine Christian with faith saying
[57:07] a woman come across the platform and
[57:09] miss it and he says to me the most
[57:11] amazing statement sure is based upon
[57:14] faith if thou can'tst believe not upon
[57:17] righteousness
[57:19] so if you could give me
[57:22] if we could just draw this conclusion
[57:24] together as a way to try to explore this
[57:26] as we close there's a prostitute that
[57:29] can come up in a prayer line and not
[57:31] have the Holy Ghost not have a life a a
[57:34] a a virtue not even being a Christian
[57:37] but it's come by faith through the come
[57:41] through this process believing I'm here
[57:43] to be healed
[57:45] heard your Divine healer heard you had a
[57:47] gift of healing I'm sick I need to be
[57:49] healed that's all it is to them
[57:51] I need to be healed I want to be healed
[57:53] and they stand there with faith and
[57:55] brother Branham is able to pray for them
[57:56] or whatever the other laying hands of
[57:57] the sick using discernment whatever it
[57:59] might be and that person genuinely
[58:01] received their healing instantly be
[58:03] healed and then you have a sincere
[58:05] God-fearing Christian has the Holy Ghost
[58:08] stands before the same gift has
[58:10] seemingly come up through the same
[58:11] process and is not able to receive their
[58:14] healing
[58:16] and brother Brown says oh it's because
[58:18] of Faith he said well then you tell me
[58:20] the prostitute had Faith the faith that
[58:22] can move mountains the face of the faith
[58:24] that pleases God the faith that we the
[58:26] ultimate Faith or did she have a human
[58:28] faith that could operate in this channel
[58:31] to bring the results whereas the one who
[58:33] has the faith on the inside has his
[58:36] faith in the soul realm comes up through
[58:38] the line and doesn't get the healing
[58:40] they need
[58:42] it's two different processes
[58:44] Billy Rams referring to Faith and I
[58:46] think it's in faith of the substance
[58:47] says it's another element altogether
[58:51] it's an element in other words somebody
[58:53] can have that element
[58:56] and it's been something that's been it's
[58:57] something that they can use the power
[58:59] the energy of but it's just that element
[59:02] and if I could put it this way I'm just
[59:04] going to create this picture and then
[59:05] we're going to close
[59:06] the center
[59:08] as brother I'm saying it I'm just
[59:09] looking here at the statement he's
[59:11] saying it's based solemnly on faith it's
[59:13] based on faith so healing is based on
[59:15] faith so the the the the the center now
[59:18] I'll just have to amplify this more next
[59:19] time maybe even visually The Sinner
[59:21] comes up to the prayer line
[59:23] intellectually believing
[59:26] in the promise of God and believe in it
[59:29] enough
[59:30] for when it hits against the free moral
[59:32] agency and The Unborn again soul
[59:35] free more agency accepts it
[59:37] and what does God do heals them
[59:40] they believe that intellectually enough
[59:42] here
[59:43] that when it finally came down to the
[59:45] soul because they're not born again
[59:47] they've got faith and doubt they've got
[59:49] the three more agency to open up to
[59:51] choose to accept it or to reject and it
[59:54] comes down there and they've got enough
[59:55] intellectual faith for the the soul even
[59:57] the the human mind the human now not
[1:00:00] necessarily A Divine realm but human
[1:00:02] Faith come down and say well my I
[1:00:04] believe and there's this temporary
[1:00:06] alignment and God says you're healed
[1:00:09] come on and does brother but I'm not say
[1:00:11] that healing will last as long as the
[1:00:13] faith lasts
[1:00:14] but then break that get that
[1:00:16] discontinuity
[1:00:17] through some way and what happens it
[1:00:19] comes right back again right
[1:00:21] but as long as that channel as long as
[1:00:23] that person can intellectually believe
[1:00:25] and then in that Soul open up and accept
[1:00:28] it because what their faith is projected
[1:00:30] to is Divine Healing God honors it
[1:00:35] but a Christian
[1:00:37] who's got nothing but the word here
[1:00:38] right the soul is sealed it's the Holy
[1:00:41] Ghost the only thing that can come and
[1:00:42] hit that faith that seal of faith is the
[1:00:45] word of God and as they come up their
[1:00:48] soul has enough power in it power in it
[1:00:52] to create a world and go live on it
[1:00:55] and they're standing in line and brother
[1:00:57] bear says if you had that kind of Faith
[1:00:58] you wouldn't be standing here why
[1:00:59] because not in the soul but now in their
[1:01:02] spirit
[1:01:04] right
[1:01:05] that the soul has the word
[1:01:07] the soul has the faith but they're
[1:01:10] wrestling with their healing
[1:01:11] intellectually
[1:01:13] in the spirit realm they're wrestling
[1:01:15] with it and what happens the promise
[1:01:17] that he's a Healer can't get past the
[1:01:20] spirit to strike the soul
[1:01:22] and give them the healing right
[1:01:25] and so that's where the battle is for
[1:01:27] the believer not if I I'm almost
[1:01:28] starting to preach now because you guys
[1:01:30] are just kind of in this channel
[1:01:31] that's where the devil wants to use that
[1:01:34] to get you to start doubting in the soul
[1:01:35] Realm and listen no matter how much you
[1:01:38] try to doubt you can't doubt if you're
[1:01:39] sealed it's sealed so he tries to cause
[1:01:42] the confusion in the mind he tries to
[1:01:44] cause this wow I'm not so sure and then
[1:01:47] what are you thinking well maybe I'm
[1:01:48] sick because I made a mistake and maybe
[1:01:50] he's doing this to cause this and it's
[1:01:52] only happening listen you're doing the
[1:01:55] Choose Your Own Adventure in your spirit
[1:01:56] it has nothing to do with the soul has
[1:01:58] nothing to do with the word it's the
[1:02:00] wrestling you have in your spirit so
[1:02:02] when you begin to pray and now this is
[1:02:04] when Jesus says it's even in that
[1:02:06] Matthew 17 where they said well we
[1:02:08] couldn't cast this devil out he said but
[1:02:10] he says because if you have doubt he
[1:02:12] says but if you believe nothing shall be
[1:02:14] impossible he says but some things only
[1:02:16] come out with much prayer and fasting
[1:02:19] now that has nothing to do with faith
[1:02:22] that has to do with the spirit being
[1:02:24] aligned
[1:02:25] has something to do with preparing the
[1:02:27] human part to get to the place or say
[1:02:29] yes I believe yes I believe and to get
[1:02:32] your mental Faith to line up with the
[1:02:34] soul faith that you have so that now
[1:02:36] that Revelation strikes and it is divine
[1:02:41] that's why you can have a a sinner come
[1:02:44] to the line and be healed because
[1:02:45] they've allowed their intellectual Faith
[1:02:47] to be received by their soul their free
[1:02:50] moral agency and they receive their
[1:02:51] healing and then the believer struggles
[1:02:53] so much
[1:02:55] because brother bear said they've been
[1:02:56] drugged through so much
[1:02:58] we almost know too much about it
[1:03:01] right
[1:03:02] you're gonna tell me you're gonna come
[1:03:04] up you need you're gonna need healing
[1:03:05] and all of a sudden you're going to hear
[1:03:07] there's there's a prayer line you're
[1:03:09] going to come up in the prayer line
[1:03:09] you're gonna be coming up believing
[1:03:11] you're gonna get healed and all of a
[1:03:11] sudden you're like oh wait a minute what
[1:03:12] was it brother Aaron preached on Christ
[1:03:14] my healer about prayer lines laying on
[1:03:16] of hands am I doing something wrong
[1:03:18] should I not be here is my faith not
[1:03:20] mature enough and you're going to come
[1:03:21] right up there and just gonna be like
[1:03:22] you know I don't even know what I'm
[1:03:24] doing here because I'm not even sure
[1:03:25] brother Bram said if you have faith you
[1:03:27] wouldn't even be here so you think I
[1:03:28] have faith
[1:03:29] right
[1:03:31] and the backslid messenger behind you
[1:03:34] like man I just wanted man I just wanted
[1:03:35] just want the Holy Ghost get out of the
[1:03:37] way you're taking too much time you're
[1:03:38] talking too much I'm just I just believe
[1:03:40] I just need it whether they get besides
[1:03:42] what God I just need Jesus just to be
[1:03:44] delivered without any kind of shouting
[1:03:46] or Screaming it's just you can have it
[1:03:47] in the name Lord lay their hands on them
[1:03:49] boom a life's completely changed and
[1:03:50] you're walking away going so which part
[1:03:51] was it was it was it part six where he
[1:03:53] talked about the hands being laid on was
[1:03:55] it
[1:03:56] right got too much going on up here
[1:04:00] than to just take God in his word and
[1:04:01] the moment that you need it lay hands on
[1:04:03] me I need to be healed
[1:04:05] this is what I need for the moment that
[1:04:07] I'm in really in some ways you look at
[1:04:09] perfect Faith perfect faith is the faith
[1:04:11] that you need in the moment to meet the
[1:04:12] challenge of the moment
[1:04:17] that's that's uh if this was part four
[1:04:20] that's part three and a half there's
[1:04:22] still more God bless you let's stand
