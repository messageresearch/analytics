[0:00] 1 Peter chapter
[0:02] 1 verses 14 and 16 to 16 as obedient
[0:08] children not fashioning yourselves
[0:10] according to the former lust in your
[0:11] ignorance but as he which hath called
[0:14] you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner
[0:17] of conversation because it is written be
[0:20] ye holy for I am Holy amen he's called
[0:25] us he who has called us is Holy so we
[0:28] are to be holy in all manner of
[0:31] conversation says because it is written
[0:32] drawn from scripture be holy for I am
[0:35] Holy you can take your seats you can see
[0:38] from our slide that we're going to be
[0:40] speaking on sacred Symmetry and this
[0:44] will you might be playing with that
[0:46] phrase a little bit and trying to figure
[0:47] out in your mind what it means uh but
[0:50] we'll come to it here in just a moment
[0:52] but if you could turn in your Bibles to
[0:53] Psalms
[0:55] 103:7 I'm going to use this just to
[0:58] connect what we were ministering on
[0:59] Wednesday night to this morning service
[1:01] says of the Lord he made way he made
[1:04] known his ways unto Moses his acts unto
[1:07] the children of Israel the ways there is
[1:09] a road or path it would speak of maybe a
[1:12] direction or just a journey and it's
[1:14] also used of manner a habit or a course
[1:18] of Life a moral character and he says he
[1:22] made known his ways unto Moses and we
[1:25] can say this but only his acts unto the
[1:29] children of Israel
[1:30] so his ways were made known to the
[1:32] prophet made known to Moses and this was
[1:34] his character his who he was and his
[1:37] habit as course of life and what the
[1:40] children of Israel saw were things that
[1:41] God had done and we use the example
[1:44] Wednesday night on the difference
[1:45] between the artwork and the work of art
[1:48] whereas one is the product that would be
[1:50] the artwork or you look at it and you
[1:52] could view it and then the the work of
[1:54] art would be the process or skill of
[1:56] creating art as was fellowship with
[1:59] Brother Scott my our local Latin expert
[2:02] on how to properly pronounce the Latin
[2:05] um RS and that's what the root is for
[2:08] art and it basically begins to uh
[2:10] emphasize that fun foundational aspect
[2:13] of creative skill that's what that word
[2:16] means art it's a skill and it's that it
[2:18] forms the basis of someone if they're an
[2:20] artist or art kind of refers to this
[2:23] aspect of a creation or a skill in
[2:25] creating and the artistic process if
[2:28] we're thinking about a work of art the
[2:30] product of a process but the process
[2:33] itself is the ability to express and to
[2:36] innovate and to create through various
[2:38] mediums and so there's we've been
[2:39] focusing maybe a lot on painting and the
[2:42] visual arts but there's other ways that
[2:44] art can be expressed uh it involves many
[2:47] different facets of the Mastery of
[2:48] certain techniques and the application
[2:51] of that creativity I can tell you I
[2:53] could dream up a million things in my
[2:55] mind but to be able to put it on paper
[2:57] and make it happen that takes real skill
[2:59] or an artist and there's this continual
[3:02] honing of those
[3:04] abilities an artist can be a musical
[3:06] artist is someone who could be talented
[3:08] or learned or gifted in certain ways but
[3:11] there's a if you're the process the
[3:13] artistic process is the continual honing
[3:15] of those gifts and those particular
[3:17] traits and these things work together
[3:19] and they produce these works that will
[3:22] resonate uh with people and there it
[3:25] causes a contemplation and it has some
[3:27] sort of effect on the viewer so of the
[3:29] things we pointed out if there's a uh in
[3:31] the artistic process artistic process
[3:35] that there is a way of perceiving
[3:37] there's this discernment of abilities
[3:38] there's this recognition of slight
[3:41] differences which give something their
[3:43] character and their expression sometimes
[3:45] you hear somebody who's able to
[3:46] impersonate voices and uh uh and sound
[3:49] like someone else what they do is they
[3:50] can perceive some particular distinction
[3:53] in someone's tone or the way that they
[3:55] speak and all you do is emphasize that
[3:57] it kind of brings it to life oh you
[3:58] sound just like that person or that you
[4:00] act just like them and that's that skill
[4:02] that someone could have an art to
[4:04] perceive a character and expressions and
[4:06] that's all part of the artistic process
[4:09] but the artwork itself is just the
[4:11] outcome of that skill of creativity it
[4:14] is the it is the actual expression of
[4:17] that
[4:18] Innovation and when we look at that in
[4:21] that vein if we look at the Psalms 103:7
[4:25] he made known his ways unto Moses in
[4:26] other words God revealed to Moses the
[4:28] work of God the mind the process uh the
[4:32] inspiration of God whereas the children
[4:34] of Israel only saw God's work I think
[4:37] it's very simple but you see the
[4:38] distinction that's being made when one
[4:40] would show you their mind or show you
[4:42] their their process this would involve
[4:44] some sort of inspiration or Revelation
[4:46] it's a deeper Insight whereas the other
[4:48] one could just merely be emotion oh wow
[4:50] that's beautiful oh that's that that's a
[4:52] gorgeous painting and so to know the way
[4:54] of God is greater than just to see the
[4:57] works of God Jesus chastised himself
[4:59] saying you see my works but you don't
[5:01] know who I am I can do all these
[5:03] wonderful things and all you come is you
[5:04] come for the bread and you come for the
[5:06] Miracles but you haven't really heard me
[5:08] you don't really know me so in Psalms
[5:11] 25:4 this is our prayer show me thy ways
[5:14] oh Lord teach me thy paths I show me the
[5:17] way and teach me your path I want to
[5:19] know the right way to walk I want to
[5:20] know the right manner of life I want to
[5:22] know the right way to live amen uh
[5:25] brother Reggie shared a quote uh early
[5:28] Thursday morning from the sermon be
[5:30] certain of God that just fit perfectly
[5:33] with this I thought it would just be an
[5:34] outstanding statement to share today
[5:36] Lord as brother BR is praying at the
[5:38] very outset Lord bless Thy word as it
[5:40] goes forth and may the Holy Spirit
[5:42] capture our minds and our thoughts and
[5:44] prepare us for his visitation as we have
[5:46] asked him to come for we do not come to
[5:50] the house of the Lord to be seen or to
[5:52] see but to learn of thee and to know of
[5:55] thy nature and thy way and thy causes
[5:59] think of just how how rich that is we
[6:00] don't come to church just to see and be
[6:02] seen but we come to learn from the Lord
[6:05] and in learning we want to know his
[6:06] nature we want to know his way and we
[6:08] want to know his causes we want to know
[6:11] what he's for we want to know what he's
[6:13] doing it says that we might be able to
[6:15] face the problems of life with a real
[6:17] Assurance being certain of god notice
[6:20] how if we're facing something going
[6:22] through something whatever it is that we
[6:24] might have as our our real burden right
[6:27] now that what we want to know is his
[6:29] nature his way and his causes and
[6:32] that'll give us greater courage and
[6:33] wisdom to face the problems of life when
[6:37] you have an assurance of who God is
[6:38] truly the more you would know about God
[6:40] the less you'd worry about everything
[6:42] else that's going on right I mean the
[6:44] more that you knew him and knew his love
[6:45] for you and knew his nature and knew how
[6:47] kind he's been the more you could just
[6:49] remember how he's never failed you and
[6:51] everything has always worked together
[6:52] for the good the less you would probably
[6:54] worry about the problems of life so we
[6:58] come this morning to learn of the Lord
[7:00] to know his nature his ways and his
[7:02] causes which brings us to the subject
[7:05] this morning of sacred symmetry when I
[7:08] use the term sacred it's drawing from
[7:11] some of the elements that we spoke on
[7:12] last month but those things which are
[7:14] holy if something sacred it's set apart
[7:17] uh the Sabbath was to be kept uh sacred
[7:20] that means they set it apart just a
[7:21] regular day uh for for the Jews but then
[7:24] once they set it apart it became a holy
[7:26] day so something set apart so sacredness
[7:29] is something separate and I'm using the
[7:31] word symmetry to speak of some
[7:33] harmonious Arrangement where there is
[7:35] these uh uh these balanced proportions
[7:39] and if there's any artist here whether
[7:40] it be musically or or uh painting or
[7:44] writers um even within math if there's
[7:47] any mathematicians here or maist
[7:49] whatever they're called uh they'll be
[7:51] they'll recognize this that there's this
[7:53] beauty of form and that there is a as
[7:56] it's called Divine proportion
[8:00] that exist maybe it's it's debatable and
[8:02] different people argue it so I'm not
[8:03] leaning into it too much but it's this
[8:05] idea that beauty is expressed in these
[8:08] balanced proportions uh that when
[8:10] something has symmetry to it and that
[8:13] certain form uh there's a way that it
[8:15] just catches the eye and it draws the
[8:17] viewer in and so there is a sacred or a
[8:20] holy Beauty and that's what we're
[8:22] looking at is this this Holiness that
[8:25] conveys and presents an engaging Beauty
[8:28] in First Peter chap 1: 14 15 and 16 as
[8:32] we read it uh
[8:34] earlier says as obedient children not
[8:37] fashioning yourselves according to the
[8:39] former lust in your ignorance so there's
[8:41] some fashioning some making some uh
[8:44] outworking that's taking place and when
[8:45] we were ignorant we looked like the
[8:47] world we lived like the world we did
[8:49] worldly things but now being obedient to
[8:51] the word of God and having been born
[8:53] again we now are not fashioned the same
[8:56] way so there's a different life that we
[8:58] begin to live and so he puts it in these
[9:01] terms but as he which hath called you is
[9:03] Holy so be ye holy in all manner of
[9:06] conversation because it is written be ye
[9:09] holy for I am Holy it's a the one who
[9:14] called you God who is Holy has called
[9:16] you and he having called you it's we
[9:19] must also be holy as the one who's
[9:22] called us and it says in all coners
[9:25] manner of conversation now that includes
[9:27] our literal conversation it includes the
[9:30] things that we talk about but it speaks
[9:32] all to all that would Encompass your
[9:34] manner of life it's your daily Behavior
[9:37] we could say in all our conduct and
[9:40] conversations so it kind of draws in
[9:42] that there's this responsibility that I
[9:44] have in every fa facet of my life to not
[9:47] convey the wrong picture to not uh
[9:50] present the wrong things and to do my
[9:52] best to uh to express the nature of
[9:55] Christ and the Holiness of
[9:57] God when he says because it is written
[10:00] be ye holy for I am Holy Peter is
[10:02] pulling from this principle that God is
[10:04] Holy and he points to the context of the
[10:07] law in Leviticus 11:44 for I am the Lord
[10:10] your God you shall therefore sanctify
[10:12] yourselves and you shall be holy for I
[10:15] am Holy neither shall you defile
[10:18] yourselves with any manner of creeping
[10:20] thing that creepeth upon the earth now
[10:22] God has giving these instructions under
[10:24] the law and he's actually giving them
[10:26] away that they can meet the requirements
[10:28] of the law though as difficult as it
[10:30] would be he's telling them that you're
[10:32] to sanctify yourselves to separate be
[10:34] set apart avoid certain things because
[10:37] I'm holy and being holy you need to be
[10:40] holy as my people and then it says then
[10:42] do not defile yourselves with any manner
[10:44] of creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[10:45] Earth speaking of avoiding things that
[10:48] are unclean and if some of you want to
[10:50] get maybe ahead of where I'm going I've
[10:53] been looking at if something's unclean
[10:55] it's impure and you'll find that's
[10:56] connected with things that are
[10:58] abomination in the scripture there's
[11:00] different ways that it's an Abomination
[11:02] there's different things that can be an
[11:03] Abomination it's quite a a lengthy study
[11:06] but that's what he's dealing with here
[11:07] is those things that are an Abomination
[11:10] saying uh you you want to avoid those
[11:12] things that are unclean avoid those
[11:14] things that are impure so that you can
[11:16] be separate as God is separate and he's
[11:19] drawing a parallel of the Holiness of
[11:21] God a and how it was demonstrated in the
[11:25] law that in the law God has given them
[11:27] very specific things to do so that they
[11:30] can guard their sanctification so that
[11:32] they could stay pure now I I will say
[11:36] this
[11:37] that the the the laws and the things
[11:40] that were given and even those things
[11:42] that were called an Abomination it's not
[11:44] just making a list and saying all these
[11:46] things are evil and if you do these
[11:47] things you don't have the Holy Ghost but
[11:50] God was specifically governing their
[11:52] lives with very detailed things that
[11:54] they were to avoid and abstain from and
[11:57] it didn't necessarily make make those
[11:59] things in themselves evil or impure but
[12:02] it was ways that they could sanctify
[12:04] themselves and keep themselves pure then
[12:07] when we come into the New Testament as
[12:08] hopefully we'll find uh later on or we
[12:11] can get more in depth that there's
[12:12] things that are directly related to the
[12:14] nature of God that remain in Abomination
[12:17] even after the
[12:19] law and so there God's nature and
[12:22] character the this Holiness of God is is
[12:24] there's a an maybe this is a bad word to
[12:27] use but there's an attempt or there's a
[12:29] symbolism and a type of God's holiness
[12:31] that's demonstrated in the law and
[12:33] Peter's using that as an example of the
[12:36] Holiness that we ought to have now so
[12:39] God is Holy we must be
[12:41] holy in Malachi chapter 3 starting with
[12:44] verse 5 and we'll read verse 6
[12:48] also God says I'll come near to you to
[12:51] judgment and I will be a swift witness
[12:54] against the sorcerers and against the
[12:56] adulterers and against false swearers
[12:58] and those that oppress the hireling in
[13:00] his wages the Widow and the fatherless
[13:02] and that turn aside the stranger from
[13:05] his right and fear not me saith the Lord
[13:08] of host now there's
[13:11] quite a bit here and I I I'm hoping that
[13:13] at some point maybe today I uh this
[13:16] morning in this service I can come back
[13:18] to this but notice he says I'm going to
[13:20] be a swift witness I'm going to judge
[13:23] Sorcerers I'm going to judge adulterers
[13:25] I'm going to judge those who falsely
[13:28] swear and those that oppress the
[13:30] employees that oppress the widows and
[13:32] the fatherless and that turn away the
[13:34] stranger from his right and he's saying
[13:36] that in doing these things now God says
[13:39] he's going to judge these these are all
[13:40] things that maybe might be good for us
[13:42] to think about Ponder a little bit and
[13:44] ask ourselves why would God judge people
[13:46] who do these things and then he says in
[13:49] verse 6 for I am the Lord I change not
[13:53] that's right says therefore ye sons of
[13:55] Jacob are not
[13:56] consumed this is something that I'm
[13:59] wanting to emphasize now that the Bible
[14:01] says be ye holy as I am Holy and we're
[14:04] looking at a god whose nature does not
[14:07] change I am the Lord I change not it
[14:10] kind of has a root to be repeated or to
[14:12] repeat again or to do again but it also
[14:14] means in the emphasis here is I do not I
[14:17] am not
[14:17] altered I do not it even speaks to I do
[14:20] not disguise myself so he's not trying
[14:22] to deceive uh he he is not a a
[14:26] dissimilation where he does things one
[14:28] way and it has a particular nature and
[14:30] then he acts contrary to his nature I am
[14:33] the Lord and I change not and he's
[14:35] saying just because I have not executed
[14:37] judgment on the wicked does not mean
[14:39] I've changed my ways this is to me this
[14:42] is a a key because we say well they get
[14:45] away with this I got away with this this
[14:47] keeps happening this keeps happening
[14:49] this is the way things are just because
[14:51] things have changed and things are
[14:53] accepted and a a way of life seems to be
[14:56] continuing on without any sense of
[14:58] judgment God says I am the Lord and I do
[15:01] not change my attitude towards this I
[15:04] have an unchangeable hatred of sin a a
[15:08] and I am going to judge these things the
[15:10] very fact that I have not executed
[15:12] judgment upon it does not mean I've
[15:14] changed my opinion but at the same time
[15:18] my longsuffering has not changed either
[15:21] I am the Lord I change not I will judge
[15:23] that sin but I since I don't change the
[15:26] sons of Jacob are not consumed because
[15:29] long
[15:30] suffering God never changes in his
[15:33] nature he's always doing his work the
[15:36] same now the work may look different but
[15:39] it's got to be in continuity with his
[15:42] nature he he he he does these great
[15:44] works he does things he accomplishes
[15:46] things but it's all according to his
[15:48] nature as I've been drawing from those
[15:50] sermons in
[15:51] 1964 uh on the Masterpiece identified
[15:54] Masterpiece which were all preceded by
[15:56] the identified Christ of all ages and
[15:58] God being identified in his
[16:00] characteristics he says and the
[16:01] identified Christ of all ages you see
[16:04] all these things just portrayed Christ
[16:06] Old Testament prophets and David and
[16:09] these ones he was a part of it God does
[16:11] not change his nature does not change
[16:15] his character does not change thank God
[16:19] ours
[16:20] does he is still the word and Malachi
[16:23] 3:6 proves that what is it I am the Lord
[16:26] and I change not he just changes his
[16:28] form form for each age now catch that
[16:31] how that uh that can strike us well he
[16:33] changes his form we think well it would
[16:35] be better if he always appeared as a
[16:37] triangle uh that was on fire and there's
[16:40] this hovering orb of a triangular fire
[16:42] and we'd say well that's God that's the
[16:43] form that he holds but yet he's saying
[16:45] no I don't do that I I'll change my form
[16:48] but to know me you have to know my ways
[16:50] and recognize a
[16:52] form that is revealing or exhibiting my
[16:55] nature or my character each age he has
[16:58] allotted a part of the word which has
[17:00] been prophesied would happen in certain
[17:02] days and as that age comes along God
[17:04] just moves in another form it's God all
[17:08] the time the word the word made flesh
[17:10] and dwelt among us as we live in this
[17:13] 21st century then there's going to be a
[17:15] 21st century word that's going to take
[17:17] on form in this hour and it's going to
[17:20] be the way nature and character of God
[17:22] the same as it's always been in that
[17:25] form the Bible says in Hebrews 13:8
[17:28] Jesus Christ
[17:29] the same yesterday and today and
[17:34] forever when the word was made flesh in
[17:36] Jesus Christ his divine nature his
[17:38] Divine personality did not change by
[17:40] becoming flesh in Jesus Christ even
[17:43] though he took on a form of a man and
[17:45] maybe took on a form in a way that he
[17:47] had not done previously he did not
[17:49] change his nature he was the same as he
[17:52] ever was
[17:54] before that's why Jesus could say I've
[17:56] been with you this long you've seen me
[17:58] and and through seeing me in this form
[18:00] in this life that I've lived you've been
[18:02] seeing the
[18:05] father brother brandham writes this in
[18:07] the church age book chapter one and I
[18:09] think it's
[18:10] very uh it's part of that where Satan
[18:13] hates Revelation and he knows when the
[18:15] chur true church gets the true
[18:16] revelation of the of herself that she'll
[18:18] be an invincible Army but this this
[18:20] paragraph precedes it let me show you
[18:22] another reason why Satan hates this book
[18:24] of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[18:26] church he knows that Jesus Christ is the
[18:30] same yesterday and today and forever and
[18:32] he changes not th this is such a
[18:35] critical uh thing to understand he's the
[18:38] same yesterday today and forever and as
[18:41] I've been this is what I've been kind of
[18:42] looking at this whole year on this
[18:44] thought is that we could then take God
[18:47] and put him in a particular image and
[18:49] force that image and say this is the way
[18:51] that it would be because God never
[18:53] changes and try to carry that through
[18:55] every age but God is saying no my nature
[18:58] never changes the image may change but
[19:01] the image will not be broadcasting
[19:03] something that's contrary to my nature
[19:06] may come in a different expression or a
[19:07] different form but I'm the same
[19:09] yesterday today and forever and I change
[19:11] not the devil would want you to think
[19:14] that God does change I had a friend who
[19:16] preached a sermon one time called the uh
[19:19] unchanging yet everchanging God and it
[19:22] was shown that there's certain things
[19:23] that will never change but then there's
[19:25] a way in that that unchanging nature is
[19:29] shown he says he knows a whole lot more
[19:32] than the 90% of the
[19:35] theologians he knows that since God is
[19:38] immutable in his nature then he is just
[19:41] as immutable in his
[19:44] ways it's in his nature in his character
[19:47] if he's immutable in his nature then the
[19:49] way that his nature is expressed it's
[19:50] also
[19:52] immutable it's that Telltale sign that
[19:55] it's God sometimes I express it this way
[19:58] I I love looking into my life and seeing
[20:00] the Fingerprints of God all over it and
[20:02] to maybe the world or the critic would
[20:04] think well why does that look like God
[20:06] to you wouldn't have God just kept it
[20:08] from
[20:09] happening why why would that how is that
[20:11] God wouldn't it just been better if if
[20:13] if this would have never happen or if it
[20:15] happened this way but there's a way that
[20:17] God's nature when you could see that
[20:19] he's doing
[20:20] something so God is
[20:24] unchanging in his nature he's immutable
[20:26] in his ways that's that principle of God
[20:30] and so God is Holy he is sacred this is
[20:32] one of those immutable characteristics
[20:34] this is part of his unchanging nature he
[20:36] is sacred he's set apart there's this
[20:38] this apartness this consecration this
[20:40] Sanctified God is Holy and it's hard for
[20:42] us to think that God is Sanctified but
[20:44] he is in essence
[20:46] originally no evil inside of him no
[20:48] darkness no lying God is Holy and
[20:53] unchangeable in Exodus chapter 15 ver1
[20:56] it says who is like unto thee Oh Lord
[20:57] among the gods who is like thee glorious
[21:00] in Holiness fearful in Praises doing
[21:03] wonders he's Majestic in his sacredness
[21:06] in his
[21:07] separateness in the most simple way to
[21:10] look at it something holy is something
[21:12] that's set apart I know we attach a lot
[21:14] of things to what Holiness is and we
[21:17] might begin to ascribe a certain piety
[21:19] or maybe some rigid construct in our
[21:21] minds and it's certainly fine because
[21:23] it's the way that we understand what
[21:25] holy means but something's holy it's set
[21:27] apart God God is Holy he's sacred he's
[21:31] aart he's he's not like human beings
[21:33] he's not the way he he is not sinful
[21:36] flesh he's higher he's greater he's
[21:40] holy he's Majestic in his
[21:43] sacredness and in Hebrews 12: 10-15 and
[21:47] we'll read a number of scriptures that
[21:48] speak to
[21:50] this there is a call to be one with God
[21:55] in this Majestic sacredness in this
[21:57] glorious holiness
[21:59] in Hebrews 12: 10-15 for they verily for
[22:02] a few days chastened us after their own
[22:04] pleasure who's that our fathers who
[22:06] spank us who correct us who chastised us
[22:09] but he God corrects us for our profit
[22:12] that we might be partakers of his
[22:14] Holiness so God uses correction and
[22:17] chastisement for our benefit for our
[22:19] edification that we might be a partner
[22:22] or these Partners in his Holiness
[22:25] Holiness here is that sanctity this
[22:27] moral purity and it's this idea of this
[22:30] absolute Holiness this absolute
[22:31] sanctification so there's a continual
[22:34] work of uh chastisement and instruction
[22:37] and teaching that we might become
[22:40] greater Partners in his Holiness I we
[22:43] can say partakers but I wouldn't want
[22:45] you to think of it just like you taste
[22:46] it and you kind of involved or
[22:48] interacted with but now you're a partner
[22:50] in his Holiness says now chaste no
[22:53] chastening for the present seeth to be
[22:55] joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[22:57] afterward it yith the Peaceable fruit of
[22:59] righteousness unto them which are
[23:01] exercised thereby so as God uses his
[23:04] word to instruct us to discipline us to
[23:06] teach us his ways and to show him show
[23:09] us his paths then it may not feel good
[23:12] at the time and sermons that are very
[23:15] direct and address certain things that
[23:16] are lacking in our lives we may not like
[23:18] it at the time and it's important to
[23:21] recognize that if somebody starts
[23:22] getting into your home a little bit and
[23:24] pointing out things that are wrong as
[23:26] the word Goes Forth and the Holy Spirit
[23:27] begins to discern things that are
[23:29] lacking in your life you might
[23:30] immediately get uh uh offended by the
[23:33] person that's saying it I know you all
[23:35] thinking he's conditioning us it's
[23:37] coming well I don't know it might
[23:39] be and and it's it's understandable that
[23:42] you might first get offended you might
[23:44] try to figure out well they just said
[23:45] that because of this or even think well
[23:47] that doesn't really matter and and that
[23:49] kind of initial reaction is fine because
[23:50] it's kind of that working out of that
[23:53] grieving but when we take it and we
[23:55] begin to Bear it and we say I'm not just
[23:57] going to run because I've been corrected
[23:58] or I'm not just going to throw it away
[23:59] I'm going to really take this to heart
[24:01] and it'll find that as it begins to work
[24:03] in your heart it yields that fruit that
[24:05] God was looking for because the teaching
[24:08] the instruction the discipline the
[24:09] chastening was exercised it was fruitful
[24:12] and profitable in your life so he says
[24:15] wherefore lift up the hands which hang
[24:17] down and the feeble
[24:20] knees and this is a key scripture here
[24:22] and make straight paths for your feet
[24:26] now notice this it's not it's not so
[24:28] much
[24:30] uh correcting the record of things
[24:33] ped a and and making sure everything is
[24:37] right in your past but it has something
[24:39] to do with going forward there is a a
[24:42] statement uh brother Eli I don't know if
[24:43] you're familiar with this but there's a
[24:44] statement that us Cowboy fans have that
[24:47] the owner Jerry Jones is only interested
[24:50] in being right not winning it's all that
[24:52] matters to him is being right he's not
[24:54] interested in winning and when we think
[24:56] about teaching and correction and Chas a
[24:58] lot of times our initial reaction is we
[25:01] want to wrestle with it so that we can
[25:02] be perceived to be
[25:04] right in our prior conduct but we're not
[25:08] thinking about future conduct in other
[25:10] words if we respond to the sense of well
[25:11] this was okay that was okay I was I
[25:13] wasn't really wrong then we're actually
[25:15] saying I'm going to continue to do the
[25:17] things I've always been doing in the
[25:18] future and will'll keep making the same
[25:20] mistakes and doing the same thing
[25:22] getting the same results so Paul says
[25:25] make straight paths for your feet lest
[25:28] that way which is lamed be turned excuse
[25:30] me that which is lame be turned out of
[25:32] the way but let it rather be healed what
[25:36] a beautiful statement you make the path
[25:39] straight for your
[25:40] feet so that the lame will be
[25:44] healed it's one way of reading it they
[25:46] won't be turned out of the way so it
[25:47] says in verse 14 follow peace with all
[25:49] men and Holiness without which no man
[25:52] shall see the Lord looking diligently
[25:55] lest any man fail of the grace of God
[25:57] lest any root a bit is springing up
[25:59] trouble you and therefore thereby many
[26:01] be
[26:02] defiled so a lot that we could go
[26:04] through in this it originally had a much
[26:05] larger reading Here If You Can Read More
[26:07] in Hebrews chapter 12 you'll find that
[26:09] these things fit together very nicely
[26:11] but he says as we are to be partakers or
[26:14] Partners in his Holiness that we ought
[26:16] to in light of these things follow
[26:19] Holiness in other words we're to be
[26:21] continually putting on Holiness through
[26:24] a process of continued sanctification
[26:26] through this process of separateness
[26:28] and let me say this this is our primary
[26:32] objective as it says follow peace with
[26:34] all men and Holiness it's not saying
[26:36] that we are to follow peace with all men
[26:39] and therefore it's necessary that we
[26:41] compromise following peace with all men
[26:43] is not permission to compromise with or
[26:46] become wi one with the world or become
[26:49] in harmony with the world oh follow
[26:50] peace with all men well I become this to
[26:53] this person I become that to that person
[26:55] and use this as that that's our primary
[26:57] objective is to be at peace or in
[26:59] harmony with all men that's not what's
[27:02] being expressed Paul says in Galatians
[27:04] 1:10 for do I now persuade men or God do
[27:08] I seek to please men for if I yet
[27:10] pleased men I should not be the servant
[27:13] of
[27:14] Christ so when it the instruction is to
[27:17] follow peace with all men and
[27:20] Holiness it is not a harmony with the
[27:23] world but it is a there is this thought
[27:26] that's being expressed that we're to not
[27:27] be fighting and contentious and
[27:30] continually engaging uh uh in this
[27:32] acrimony with men and the world and even
[27:34] Believers but we're to follow peace with
[27:36] all men and primarily to follow
[27:40] Holiness and this is done to fulfill
[27:43] verses 13 and 15 that if we're not
[27:46] following Holiness then we're not going
[27:48] to be able to accomplish the scriptures
[27:51] here in verse 13 and 15 Romans 14: 19
[27:55] let us therefore follow after the things
[27:57] which make for peace
[27:58] and things wherewith one may edify
[28:02] another we are we are not called to be
[28:07] compromisers we're not called to fit in
[28:09] with the world but we're not called to
[28:12] make war with people we're not called to
[28:16] make war with other people who have
[28:18] different ideas and so there is this
[28:20] Holiness there is this righteous
[28:22] indignation that would come with that
[28:23] there is this separateness but in all
[28:25] this separation and all this Holiness
[28:27] where there's there to never be this
[28:29] looking down upon there's to never be
[28:31] this arrogance or I'm better than you or
[28:32] this persecution I say it many times uh
[28:36] that the the you say the elect won't
[28:40] persecute elect is the statement that we
[28:42] believe and and the thing to me that's
[28:44] at the heart of that when we say elect
[28:46] will not persecute elect that is an easy
[28:49] conclusion since the elect will not
[28:51] persecute
[28:52] anyone and if I'm not in the habit of
[28:55] persecuting everyone else then I'm
[28:57] certainly not going to make the mistake
[28:58] of persecuting the
[29:00] elect but there is a another side to
[29:03] this wherein if we're going to follow
[29:06] peace with all men we can kind of create
[29:09] this caricature of a Christian who kind
[29:11] of just fits in he's kind of cool he he
[29:13] he he kind of he's embraced he's
[29:16] accepted but we are to not make that
[29:19] kind of Peace but follow after things
[29:22] which make peace and things which will
[29:26] edify why vers 13 make straight paths
[29:29] for your
[29:31] feet looking diligently lest any man
[29:34] fail the grace of
[29:35] God Holiness then is a way of
[29:39] life and it's a it Holiness is making
[29:43] our way of life
[29:46] plain you say you have the nature of
[29:48] Christ inside of you you're Christians
[29:50] his it's God that dwells on the inside
[29:52] of you then this Holiness this
[29:55] separateness now there's very specific
[29:58] things that relate to that but if we
[29:59] could just think of it in this General
[30:00] context that this uh name that's given
[30:05] that we're using is Holiness but now let
[30:08] me look at it the other way there's this
[30:09] way of life that a Christian begins to
[30:12] engage in this manner in this pattern
[30:15] that begins to take on a certain nature
[30:18] that shows a certain character and that
[30:21] is what Holiness
[30:23] is it's not so it's I'm wanting to look
[30:25] at it maybe from the top uh from the
[30:27] bottom up it's saying well these are the
[30:29] things that we do and this is this is
[30:31] that process of Holiness we're not
[30:32] beginning with Holiness we're not
[30:34] beginning well we're holy well no
[30:36] there's our righteousness is filthy rags
[30:38] there's nothing inherent in humanity
[30:40] that's holy but the spirit of God is
[30:43] Holy and now what it begins to do is
[30:45] work inside of us and those fruits that
[30:47] it begins to produce and this manner of
[30:49] life that it begins to produce when it
[30:51] is the holy spirit that is
[30:56] holiness though our
[31:00] paths is a it's a way of
[31:03] life our way of life should be
[31:07] identifiable our paths are to be made
[31:09] straight it says so that the lame or
[31:12] those that are weak in faith are not
[31:15] stumbled our path our life ought to be
[31:18] identifiable it ought to be clear it we
[31:21] say it should be a holy life but it
[31:23] should be a life that indicates an
[31:26] apartness a separate
[31:29] so that those that are weak in faith and
[31:30] even the unbeliever the lame and
[31:32] different ones could see and say that is
[31:35] different that is set apart
[31:38] Amen in Proverbs 4: 26 and 27 it says
[31:43] Ponder the path of thy feet make my path
[31:45] straight so some of the septu I think
[31:48] maybe renders it in a different some
[31:50] translations Ponder the the path of thy
[31:52] feet and let all thy ways be established
[31:54] think about where you're going have the
[31:56] Lord teach you his paths show you his
[31:59] ways that you might walk in a plain path
[32:02] make straight the paths of your feet
[32:04] turn not to the right hand nor to the
[32:06] left remove thy foot from Evil remember
[32:11] how God says in Malachi 3 that he would
[32:14] bring judgment upon those that oppress
[32:16] and that turn aside the stranger from
[32:18] his
[32:19] right that there is a manner of Life
[32:21] which can cause others to turn aside
[32:24] that the lame be turned out of the way
[32:26] if our path isn't straight great if we
[32:29] as Christians and and uh Believers this
[32:32] is something I've thought of and if this
[32:34] sounds like an indictment of myself
[32:35] that's fine uh confession is good for
[32:38] the soul but I think find it remarkable
[32:40] sometimes when the longer that we serve
[32:42] God the less AP part we
[32:45] become the more comfortable we kind of
[32:47] get in our call in our election and we
[32:49] feel really confident that we're
[32:51] Believers and so that that line that
[32:53] used to be so distinct we just kind of
[32:55] move it a little bit move it a little
[32:56] bit because we've contined in this we're
[32:58] still serving God I'm still here we've
[33:00] made it through all these ups and downs
[33:01] and abusive Ministries and people
[33:03] falling away I'm still here but yet our
[33:05] part and our separateness is becoming
[33:07] more and more
[33:11] blurred and what is that to indicate to
[33:13] our
[33:14] children what does that indicate to the
[33:17] the the the one that's weakened their
[33:18] faith and they're pining for Holiness
[33:20] they're Desiring deliverance and you're
[33:22] over there saying man I'd get over that
[33:24] that doesn't really matter that
[33:26] much there's just a way that worldliness
[33:28] can begin to seep in I was thinking
[33:30] about it here recently and um there is a
[33:34] a lot of academic research a lot of
[33:36] numbers crunching there's a lot of test
[33:38] and studies that are being done to
[33:40] determine uh what's the best way uh to
[33:45] to fight drug trade and drug
[33:48] trafficking and
[33:51] the and there is an argument and and we
[33:54] may defer to our uh local expert on this
[33:57] later
[33:58] to where it would be better with certain
[34:00] drugs to just legalize them regulate
[34:03] them and make them readily available
[34:05] number one you could get tax dollars off
[34:07] of it you could then regulate it and you
[34:09] could Mo uh moderate certain things and
[34:12] and in my mind I wonder well where do
[34:15] where would some Believers go who've
[34:17] always used this rationale that it's not
[34:20] illegal to
[34:23] indulge H how many preachers are going
[34:26] to be doing a line of coke before they
[34:27] come out to preach right because they've
[34:29] been able to justify all these other
[34:31] things in their lives because it was
[34:34] legal this is legal it's it's it's not
[34:38] illegal to do this and so there's this
[34:40] blurring of lines think about the paths
[34:42] of your feet think about the way that
[34:43] you're going don't turn to the right or
[34:45] to the left remove thy foot from Evil
[34:48] these are very general prescriptions
[34:50] we'd say well okay that we want to
[34:52] follow a plain path and then the debate
[34:54] is what is a plain path we want to avoid
[34:56] evil then what is evil
[34:59] it says make straight paths for your
[35:00] feet that actually the word is the wheel
[35:03] the Wheel
[35:05] tracks the tracks that a will is to
[35:08] follow
[35:10] in make
[35:12] straight the paths of your feet it's a
[35:15] firm walk in the right direction and
[35:17] when you do that you establish a plain
[35:20] way the way that you're living isn't
[35:24] deviating and confusing and hypocritical
[35:27] you're not super legalist about this and
[35:29] it doesn't really matter H and then
[35:32] completely full-blown Freedom over here
[35:35] in something that does matter and so
[35:37] someone who's trying to follow you is
[35:38] like I don't even know which way to go
[35:41] one minute this is wrong and then you
[35:43] say that's right I'm thinking that's
[35:44] what really looks wrong but then you're
[35:47] and it's just this wandering back and
[35:49] forth make plain your way of
[35:54] life it it's a different Wheel track
[35:56] than the world
[35:58] there may be points of intersection
[36:00] there may be times when it appears as if
[36:01] you're traveling the same direction we
[36:03] hop in our cars and we drive to work and
[36:05] we travel down the same road that
[36:07] everyone else does we show up at an
[36:08] office with a lot of other people and
[36:10] our lives in so many ways have these
[36:12] parallel tracks to the world but what
[36:14] ought to make us difference is the
[36:16] nature and the way that we're living
[36:18] that there's a life that I can live even
[36:20] amongst my Associates at work or in
[36:22] school and in my family and and the
[36:24] larger world and the community as we
[36:25] engage in others on vacation or at the
[36:27] mall whatever it might be that my life
[36:30] my nature and my way indicates and shows
[36:33] a different
[36:35] path and notice how it says this follow
[36:40] Holiness without which no man shall see
[36:42] the
[36:43] Lord we could take them together follow
[36:45] peace with all men and Holiness without
[36:47] which no man shall see the Lord let me
[36:49] say it this way and just think about
[36:51] this I think we're getting pretty close
[36:55] uh pretty close to the Finish see my
[36:57] second
[36:59] page it says without Holiness no man
[37:02] shall see the Lord I want to put it that
[37:04] way without Holiness no man shall see
[37:05] the Lord the Hebrews have a saying to
[37:07] see God is to enjoy
[37:09] him here's just a moving phrase to see
[37:12] God is to enjoy him so if you have see
[37:15] if you thought you saw God but didn't
[37:17] there wasn't some pleasure and enjoyment
[37:19] from it then you didn't see him you
[37:22] might have seen a fearful work you might
[37:24] have seen a Wonder but to see God is to
[37:26] enjoy him amen amen and I want to take
[37:28] this statement and just use it in a
[37:30] little bit different way we know that
[37:31] without Holiness no man will be meeting
[37:33] the Lord in the air we know that without
[37:34] Holiness that uh we cannot uh we cannot
[37:37] enter into the New
[37:39] Jerusalem but look at this from a little
[37:41] bit different perspective I don't
[37:43] believe it to be a stretch but unless
[37:44] the sacred is being lived in US unless
[37:47] the Divine is being lived in this
[37:48] profane then no man will ever be able to
[37:51] see
[37:53] God if we were to uh hypothetically say
[37:57] that the only Christians that existed in
[37:59] the world today were sitting on the
[38:00] front
[38:02] row then there would be there would be
[38:05] God's design in nature there would be
[38:07] certain things that would maybe indicate
[38:10] a a divine plan and design it would be
[38:12] things that we could look at and say God
[38:14] has revealed in these things that are
[38:15] seen But to see God today would be the
[38:20] life that he would be living in these
[38:22] two brother Joel brother Rowan would be
[38:25] the ones through which we would have the
[38:27] greatest
[38:28] opportunity to see God and if their
[38:31] lives were not in the nature and the way
[38:34] of God which is holy and if their lives
[38:37] weren't lived in a way where there was
[38:38] some apartness there was some
[38:41] separateness then we would never see
[38:45] God so there must be a separate way of
[38:48] life there must be a separate way of
[38:51] thinking and acting and talking and
[38:52] responding that gives some indication
[38:55] that Divine Nature's present amen
[38:59] amen
[39:03] unless
[39:05] Christ is living in someone
[39:09] today then no man no one will see the
[39:25] Lord oh oh I'm going to quickly go
[39:28] through maybe several scriptures here so
[39:29] we could wrap up um as soon as
[39:33] possible in Isaiah chapter 35:8 it says
[39:37] and a highway shall be
[39:39] there and a way and it shall be called
[39:42] the way of Holiness the unclean shall
[39:45] not pass over it but it shall be for
[39:47] those the
[39:49] elect the Holy One uh some translations
[39:52] take it to say the Holy One will be with
[39:54] them walking in the way
[39:57] but it shall be for those and it says
[39:59] the wayfaring men though fools should
[40:01] not he
[40:03] therein it's a lot to process in this
[40:06] statement and as it speaks to even more
[40:08] perfectly future times this says there
[40:10] will be a highway it's elevated it's
[40:13] above a way of Holiness again that's
[40:16] that distance this course of Journey but
[40:19] then it speaks of manner of life and
[40:21] habit moral character
[40:24] Direction when we say something is
[40:26] trending down we usually go oh no that's
[40:28] not good right because there's this
[40:30] directional association with things that
[40:31] are going up things that are going down
[40:33] and so here it says the way a direction
[40:35] a way of life a course of conduct a a
[40:38] habit there's going to be a habit of
[40:41] Holiness there's going to be a way of
[40:44] Holiness a separateness the unclean the
[40:46] defiled the impure will not be able to
[40:49] pass it's a separate way in Acts 24:14
[40:53] Paul says but this I confess unto thee
[40:55] that after the way which they call
[40:56] heresy
[40:58] so worship I the god of my fathers
[41:00] believ in all things which are written
[41:01] in the law and in the prophets this way
[41:04] may be foolish to the
[41:06] world this way that we're going may seem
[41:08] to be wrong but in order for the world
[41:12] to perceive it is wrong it must be
[41:14] undeniably
[41:16] plain think of that it must be as the
[41:18] Bible says and I think it's something to
[41:20] really wrestle with uh that you know
[41:22] that that the wayfaring men though fools
[41:24] should not air therein a language
[41:25] suggests that it's going to be so PL
[41:27] that not even a fool could miss it it's
[41:29] going to be so obvious that not even a
[41:31] fool would would know would think it was
[41:34] the same way as everything else so
[41:36] whether or not the fool would take the
[41:38] way is not the question or whether or
[41:40] not the world thinks you're a fool for
[41:42] taking it the qu the the idea that's
[41:44] being at the minimum presented is that
[41:46] there's a way of life that is so
[41:48] distinct and different from the human
[41:50] way of life that others recognize that's
[41:53] aart that is separate amen there's a way
[41:58] of Holiness that we're called to that
[42:01] ought to be
[42:04] plain so undeniably
[42:07] plain that even the lame can walk in it
[42:11] and be
[42:12] healed that the weak in faith will see
[42:14] the Wheel
[42:15] tracks so that the believer will not
[42:18] falter even though they may be called a
[42:20] fool though it may be a way that's
[42:21] called heresy again there's what's
[42:23] become uh what's I've been helped with
[42:26] personally over the last few months in
[42:28] studying this is to recognize
[42:32] that because there's this idea that if
[42:34] it's if the world is gonna if the world
[42:37] hates you you know you're doing you're
[42:38] doing something
[42:41] right and then yet there's this other
[42:43] side where it's like the world needs to
[42:44] see and they will know and they will
[42:47] recognize but those things as it relates
[42:49] to the time that we're living in now and
[42:50] the scriptures that are applicable to
[42:52] the time we're living now it doesn't
[42:53] mean that in recognizing it they're
[42:55] going to be like wow this is the way we
[42:58] all want to
[42:59] be so there is but there must be a
[43:03] distinction and a separation that even
[43:04] the fool could say yeah that's
[43:09] different they're not like the
[43:11] world brother Bram in the sermon sir we
[43:14] would see Jesus says our citizenship is
[43:16] of above he uses this phrase citizen
[43:19] quite a bit when he's using this
[43:20] principle and that's a habitant of a
[43:23] particular City so we're not Phoenicians
[43:26] we're not prian uh we're not Glend
[43:29] delians we are Christians meaning we're
[43:33] citizens of a holy
[43:35] city our citizenship is above and above
[43:39] is
[43:40] Holiness and Purity and Power in
[43:43] Revelation therefore we are citizens of
[43:45] the kingdom of God there shall be a
[43:50] highway this this just means something
[43:53] elevated something above so we think
[43:55] directionally if it's above this is
[43:58] something my ways are higher than your
[44:00] ways my thoughts are higher than your
[44:02] thoughts this is something above and
[44:04] where the above is it's holy it's pure
[44:06] it's powerful that's where Revelation is
[44:09] there shall be an elevated path and if
[44:12] that gets into some sort of hierarchy
[44:14] and tries to make ourselves humanly
[44:15] better than somebody else then we could
[44:17] just say it's a parallel path but it's
[44:19] distinctly different it's
[44:23] separate in 1 Thessalonians 4:7 for God
[44:26] hath not called us to unto uncleanness
[44:29] but unto Holiness sanctification
[44:32] consecration purification of our hearts
[44:35] of our thoughts of Our Lives he has not
[44:37] called us to impurity to mixing but to
[44:40] Holiness in 1 John 3:2 to three beloved
[44:45] now are we the sons of God and it doth
[44:47] not appear yet appear what we shall be
[44:50] but we know that when he shall appear we
[44:52] shall be like him for we we shall see
[44:54] him as he is what a promise what with a
[44:57] great precious promise and to those of
[44:58] us who have this promise every man that
[45:01] ha hath this hope in him purifieth
[45:03] himself even as he is pure it's another
[45:06] way of saying put on Holiness as he is
[45:09] Holy it purify it means to cleanse or to
[45:12] make pure from carnality to become
[45:14] chased or
[45:15] modest even suggest to be immaculately
[45:20] clean so listen
[45:23] Brothers there's a way that we can clean
[45:25] house in our
[45:28] minds honey clean the house and the wife
[45:32] and the daughter would look at him be
[45:34] like you're joking right like you really
[45:36] didn't clean the house did you like oh
[45:39] you do that no you do that no that's
[45:40] what goes into this and you begin to
[45:42] realize there there's a clean in in the
[45:45] ways of men and there's a clean in the
[45:47] ways of women who are primarily tasked
[45:50] with that and it's fine if we become
[45:54] more engaged in that as men I even
[45:56] bought a book on
[45:58] it like there's things that are just
[46:00] intuitive to women and you're
[46:02] like I need to read up on this and so
[46:05] there is the same thing with God there's
[46:08] this CLE cleanliness that he desires to
[46:11] see in our lives that there's a way of
[46:13] loving there's a way of living there's a
[46:15] way of correcting there's a way of of
[46:17] going about life that he wants to see
[46:19] and it's a cleanness I know that there's
[46:21] a way that we can view Christianity
[46:23] that's very auster and rigid and harsh
[46:25] and cruel but don't make make the
[46:27] mistake that Holiness is fearful and for
[46:29] boing and and damaging and cruel and
[46:31] imposing that's not it at all there's a
[46:34] way that God wants you to live a
[46:36] separate life that is actually attracted
[46:37] to those who are looking for God looking
[46:40] for love looking for something they can
[46:42] belong to and it's that wrong image of
[46:44] Holiness that has caused many to run
[46:46] away and has become abusive because they
[46:48] saw the works but didn't know the
[46:51] way and if we knew his way that we could
[46:54] understand how we can live apart from
[46:56] uncleanness and aspired to Holiness and
[46:58] pure ourselves purify ourselves as he is
[47:01] pure Ephesians 4:24 and that you put on
[47:04] the new man this new man is like God
[47:06] he's created by God which after God
[47:09] which like God is created in
[47:10] righteousness and true Holiness God
[47:13] having not been created when he brought
[47:14] you forth as a new creature and New
[47:16] Creation in Christ Jesus he brought you
[47:18] forth in righteousness and true
[47:22] Holiness not the artwork but in the
[47:24] process of the art with the nature the
[47:27] life the
[47:28] character 1 Thessalonians 3:13 to the
[47:31] end he may establish your hearts
[47:32] unblamable in Holiness before God even
[47:35] our father at the coming of the Lord
[47:36] Jesus Christ with all his
[47:39] Saints the word Saints there is often
[47:42] it's from the same derivative of
[47:44] Holiness the Holy One is translated to
[47:47] the the word for Holiness is translated
[47:49] the Holy One to Saints this is some
[47:50] people who are separate and set
[47:53] apart and to
[47:55] establish that he may to this purpose to
[47:58] this goal establish your hearts
[48:01] unblamable in Holiness before God and we
[48:05] all said well great I
[48:07] quit but listen Holiness comes by the
[48:11] Holy
[48:13] Spirit and this Holy Spirit which God
[48:15] has created You by this baptism of the
[48:18] Holy Ghost he's created you in
[48:20] righteousness and true Holiness and this
[48:22] Holiness comes by the Holy Spirit but
[48:24] it's interrupted by
[48:25] influences it's interrupted by the
[48:27] influences of humanity and the world and
[48:32] Satan and so he's saying that we want to
[48:34] be established in this unblamable in
[48:37] Holiness so where there's this continual
[48:39] putting on the new
[48:42] man this is how it says in Romans 1:4 I
[48:44] think this will help us in terms of
[48:47] understanding how we're our hearts are
[48:48] be unblamable in Holiness and declared
[48:50] to be the Son of God with power speaking
[48:52] of Jesus Christ he's declared to be the
[48:53] Son of God with power according to the
[48:55] spirit of holiness
[48:58] the spirit of Holiness is his divine
[49:00] nature in ourselves we do not as humans
[49:03] have a spirit of
[49:05] Holiness we do not have divine nature by
[49:08] natural birth or by discipline but the
[49:10] spirit of Holiness which is divine
[49:11] nature is power it is the spirit of
[49:14] Holiness it's the author of The Holiness
[49:16] in the Holiness of in The Believer it's
[49:19] the beginner of that creation it's the
[49:22] beginner of your faith it's the spirit
[49:24] of Holiness and as he is Holy and he has
[49:26] given you the Holy Spirit the Holy
[49:28] Spirit wants to operate to bring into
[49:31] you this continual expression in manner
[49:34] of life which is separate and apart from
[49:37] the
[49:45] world
[49:48] I I think we're doing I think we're
[49:50] doing okay on
[49:51] time I I'm going to say this I ask God
[49:54] to give me to help me
[49:58] uh with expressing this when I began to
[50:01] look at these things the Lord began to
[50:02] do with my heart some time ago maybe
[50:04] it's been over the last couple years uh
[50:07] there was and it probably goes back
[50:08] further than that even in starting a
[50:10] church from scratch there's a lot of
[50:11] things you begin to uh look at and ask
[50:15] yourself well you know how many things
[50:17] do we do just because this is what
[50:18] somebody else did and is this the way
[50:21] that it ought to be done which way did
[50:22] brother brandham actually teach it so
[50:23] there's a lot of growing in that process
[50:27] and I began to try to look I was looking
[50:29] into the word of God to
[50:31] find uh you know what are the things
[50:33] that we can hold on to as absolutes that
[50:36] tell us how to live and how to act and
[50:38] what that would look like
[50:40] today and in my mind I don't believe I
[50:42] ever approach this with the thought that
[50:44] I will be able to look into this and
[50:46] immediately begin to justify playing the
[50:48] lottery or being able to go to horse
[50:50] races and my goodness there's so many
[50:51] good casinos around here and you know
[50:53] Vegas is just a short drive there wasn't
[50:55] like this idea that if I could somehow
[50:57] get to the core of things I could
[50:59] justify a lot of uh carnal things in my
[51:03] life or somebody else's life or give
[51:05] reason to say hey guys just love Jesus
[51:07] and uh and then let's just come back
[51:08] here next Sunday that I I didn't
[51:11] approach it with that idea but I
[51:13] realized the more I read this the more
[51:15] narrow my
[51:17] view of what liberties we should take
[51:21] became that the more I began to think
[51:23] wow there's there this is there's not a
[51:26] lot of attitude to just do as we want
[51:29] and say that this is kind of the gray
[51:31] area or that well what's good for you is
[51:34] not necessarily good for me and that's
[51:36] okay if your family does that but as for
[51:37] me in my house we don't believe in that
[51:40] that you'd realize there's this dividing
[51:42] line The more I've studied The more I've
[51:43] looked at it the more I've realized wow
[51:44] there is a nature and a way of God that
[51:46] presents itself and manifest itself and
[51:48] there's clear deviations from
[51:52] that and if we're not walking in the
[51:55] truth the beauty of God has never
[51:57] seen there's something that's dissimilar
[52:00] there's something that's not symmetrical
[52:01] in the way that we're living according
[52:03] to the
[52:04] word in Psalms 29:2 now I got to hurry
[52:07] give unto the Lord the glory due unto
[52:09] his name Worship the Lord in the beauty
[52:12] of Holiness this had in the Hebrew it's
[52:15] this adornment or
[52:18] Glory it comes from this some Splendor
[52:21] and Majesty so it's a beauty which is
[52:23] intrinsic when it says the the beauty of
[52:25] Holiness that means this beauty is not
[52:29] shallow it's not the Holiness of the the
[52:32] Pharisees that could act in a way that
[52:35] set them apart but that's not that's not
[52:38] a beauty that's kind of a forced
[52:40] contrived separateness that's what
[52:43] cultist behavior is and that's where we
[52:45] could say brother Joel and brother Rowen
[52:47] were the only two that had God inside of
[52:49] them and so the only way we can see God
[52:51] is through their lives and they're like
[52:53] man we're the only two on Earth let's go
[52:55] in the middle of nowhere off the land a
[52:58] and just get a satellite and we could
[52:59] code from here and make a lot of money
[53:01] and we never need to go into the world
[53:02] and guess what the world is going to be
[53:03] pure
[53:05] dark no faith to Faith No No shining of
[53:08] the
[53:10] light so the beauty of
[53:13] Holiness that Holiness is apartness
[53:16] sacredness
[53:19] separateness comes from the Hebrew
[53:21] kadash to consecrate to sanctify to
[53:23] prepare to dedicate to be Sanctified or
[53:25] to be separate
[53:27] to show oneself
[53:30] sacred carries the idea of majesty or
[53:33] Royal it's a distinguishing
[53:34] characteristic which signifies Great
[53:37] Value not just
[53:40] shallow but deep there's a beauty of
[53:44] this world which is only skin deep
[53:46] there's a beauty of this world which is
[53:47] Vanity there's this beauty of the world
[53:49] which can literally be washed
[53:53] away there's this Christian comedian
[53:57] I guess he was at a youth camp might
[53:58] have been a Pentecostal Youth Camp I
[53:59] remember uh some friends of mine playing
[54:01] it for me that he's at a youth camp and
[54:03] he said that he was describing that date
[54:05] with the girl and he said uh that
[54:07] they're sitting at dinner and she rolled
[54:09] his eyes her eyes at him and he rolled
[54:11] them right back her eye she didn't have
[54:14] an eye and they're driving and her hair
[54:16] was blowing in the wind as he drove in
[54:17] the convertible he had to turn around
[54:18] and go pick it back up and everything
[54:20] was basically just this there was
[54:22] nothing to this woman she was her eyes
[54:25] weren't real her hair wasn't real you
[54:27] know it just kept going on down the line
[54:28] someone's laughing hard enough I think
[54:29] they've heard it before maybe it was
[54:31] Louisiana Youth Camp I don't know but
[54:33] there's a there's is there's a fake
[54:35] Beauty to put on that you could just
[54:36] take all the parts away but
[54:41] right but there's this beauty of
[54:43] Holiness Psalms 969 oh Worship the Lord
[54:46] in the beauty of Holiness fear before
[54:48] him all the Earth this is that sacred
[54:51] symmetry that I'm thinking about is
[54:52] there's a beauty symmetry speaks of
[54:54] beauty and things are proportional
[54:56] things are right and things are true and
[54:58] and that's a real Beauty and there's a
[54:59] holy Beauty it's the actual beauty of
[55:03] Holiness to where we can say instead of
[55:05] a a a Holiness that is beautiful or that
[55:08] there's a h h the
[55:10] beauty a holy Beauty the beauty of
[55:14] Holiness Holiness has a symmetry
[55:17] Holiness H has a has something it's
[55:20] expressing that is greatly
[55:23] beautiful now if I could just take a few
[55:25] more moments
[55:26] I'd like to read Deuteronomy 17 ver
[55:29] excuse me Deuteronomy
[55:31] 17:1 I have just one more scripture and
[55:34] a couple more quotes to read to
[55:37] you Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the
[55:40] Lord thy God any bulock or sheep where
[55:42] in his blemish or any evil
[55:45] favored if you're looking in your Bible
[55:47] you'll find that my slideshow is not
[55:50] lacking for spaces that is one word evil
[55:53] favored
[55:56] for that is an abomination of the Lord
[55:58] thy
[55:59] God now pick up on that evil favored is
[56:04] an Abomination to the lord it's not
[56:07] being prescribed that this is something
[56:09] I'm telling you by the law that you
[56:10] should avoid I'm telling you that as God
[56:11] this is my attitude as God this is my
[56:14] nature this is what I value evil favored
[56:16] this is something that lacks Beauty the
[56:18] beauty of symmetry evil favor is
[56:20] something that's deformed or
[56:23] ugly an Abomination is something that's
[56:25] disgusting detestable something that God
[56:30] abhor evil favored an unpleasant or
[56:32] unattractive condition or
[56:34] appearence in a moral sense it'd be
[56:36] marked by moral or spiritual corruption
[56:39] so it's an outward expression of
[56:40] unbelief or wickedness that Mar God's
[56:43] image in
[56:45] humanity that so in the sacrifice if one
[56:48] was bringing a bulock or a sheep that
[56:49] had a blemish or had some sort of birth
[56:51] defect say this is to be a sacrifice
[56:54] it's to be expressing something
[56:56] something it's foreshadowing something
[56:58] and that wouldn't be that's not
[57:00] according to my image that's not what
[57:02] I'm wanting this whole this thing to
[57:04] present I mean think about God in terms
[57:07] of the temple the Tabernacle the
[57:10] sacrifices even the construction God
[57:13] didn't just tell Moses L listen just
[57:17] build a just build something in a place
[57:20] where you can
[57:21] sacrifice and and that that would be
[57:23] easy just build a place that you can
[57:26] sacrifice and man could do the best they
[57:27] can but God says I want you to I want a
[57:30] Golden Triangle I want you to use this
[57:33] these ratios I want you to use this here
[57:35] I want you use that and he's so detailed
[57:36] and particular about all of it because
[57:39] it conveys something about
[57:41] God evil favored then is this outward
[57:45] expression that changes the image of God
[57:49] in the
[57:52] person evil favored is an Abomination to
[57:55] the Lord just as it is in the sacrifice
[57:58] of a bulock and a sheep it is in the
[58:01] sacrifice of our
[58:03] lives in what we're offering to him the
[58:05] way we're living the way we're talking
[58:06] the way we're
[58:08] dressing the way we're
[58:11] indulging and identified Christ of all
[58:13] ages it says beauty is of the devil
[58:14] always it's a false conception of the
[58:17] devil admits the beauty of the Lord in
[58:19] Holiness and power so there's a beauty
[58:21] of the Lord in Holiness and power not in
[58:23] paint and powder and shorts and
[58:24] everything else that they're trying to
[58:25] wear and do do it I think we've read
[58:28] that uh sometime recently there's a
[58:30] beauty of the Lord which is in Holiness
[58:31] and power not paint powder shorts and
[58:34] everything that tries to use a
[58:37] perversion of beauty an
[58:39] enticement woman in the garden saw
[58:41] something as beautiful but it was a
[58:42] perversion of the original design it
[58:44] wasn't as it was originally intended to
[58:46] be viewed but she was caused to be
[58:48] deceived to perceive something is
[58:50] beautiful and desirable that
[58:52] wasn't it's in the beauty of Holiness
[58:55] and righteousness we are not of this
[58:57] world we are from a kingdom that's above
[59:00] where dwelleth righteousness within and
[59:03] he says they the world they don't Adorn
[59:05] themselves with that too much television
[59:08] and so forth I'm glad for the so forth
[59:09] because TV doesn't exist
[59:12] anymore too much influence and
[59:16] Interruption that we're to have our
[59:18] hearts established unblamable in
[59:21] Holiness according to the spirit of
[59:23] Holiness because we've been created in
[59:25] righteousness and true Holiness and
[59:27] we're to be putting on the new man and
[59:29] purifying
[59:31] ourselves and being holy as he is
[59:34] Holy but in comes the interruption of
[59:37] influences of humanity the world society
[59:39] events you name
[59:41] it and it's robbing us of the beauty of
[59:44] Holiness the power of Holiness he says
[59:48] speaking of America in the sermon God
[59:49] identifying himself by his
[59:51] characteristics anybody who's kind of
[59:53] taken the lead on listening to some of
[59:55] these sermons I have uh I have a choice
[59:59] when I say if you want a listening list
[1:00:02] uh let me know I have a choice to
[1:00:03] believe that only the these are the only
[1:00:05] ones that want to listen to it the ones
[1:00:07] that ask or everybody got else got it
[1:00:09] and they know exactly what I want to
[1:00:10] listen to these are the only ones who
[1:00:11] didn't know and had to ask so it's a
[1:00:14] kind of a litmus
[1:00:17] test he's speaking of America he said
[1:00:20] it's supposed to be a Christian Nation
[1:00:21] but the spirit of this nation is not
[1:00:23] Christian it might be called a Christian
[1:00:26] but it's a million miles from it in
[1:00:29] characteristic don't believe the
[1:00:32] hype to quote flavor flave don't believe
[1:00:35] the hype I'm telling you no matter how
[1:00:37] much it may seem that there's some sort
[1:00:39] of moral correction taking place in
[1:00:41] America it's a false Beauty it's a False
[1:00:45] Image he's speaking of a conversation he
[1:00:47] had with his wife she said well we
[1:00:48] aren't we all Americans I said no we
[1:00:51] live here this is our country we stay in
[1:00:53] it we love it it's the best nation in
[1:00:55] the world
[1:00:56] but yet we're not Americans wow what
[1:00:58] does this do to the Maga
[1:01:00] movement so are you saying we're
[1:01:06] aliens I mean we we can be documented
[1:01:10] Americans but where's your documentation
[1:01:13] that you're citizens of a holy
[1:01:16] city some of us are undocumented aliens
[1:01:20] in church
[1:01:21] Glory where's your holy documentation I
[1:01:25] need a ham and be three behind me
[1:01:29] now it's the best nation in the world
[1:01:31] but we're not Americans I said we are
[1:01:32] born from above the Holy Spirit come
[1:01:34] down and we belong to a kingdom it's not
[1:01:38] of this
[1:01:40] world I said that's the reason our
[1:01:43] sisters wear dresses wear long hair
[1:01:45] don't wear makeup their characteristics
[1:01:48] identify them as Holiness unto the Lord
[1:01:51] from above I will say this these things
[1:01:55] are in aable characteristics of the
[1:01:58] Sacred in women today we can trifle with
[1:02:01] it we can argue with it we can say well
[1:02:03] this applies and this doesn't apply but
[1:02:04] let me say there is a way of God in the
[1:02:07] word which is immutable and it never
[1:02:09] changes and no matter how long we live
[1:02:11] there must be Holiness in the way that
[1:02:14] we dress and the way that we present
[1:02:17] ourselves and he says sisters wear
[1:02:19] dresses wear long hair don't wear makeup
[1:02:21] their characteristics identify them as
[1:02:23] Holiness unto the Lord from
[1:02:27] above you may read that and say well is
[1:02:29] there some Spectrum upon which we can
[1:02:32] navigate these things okay well there
[1:02:34] these things are are are worth your
[1:02:36] prayer and your
[1:02:37] consideration but know that there's a
[1:02:39] way being expressed in these
[1:02:42] things I'm kind of maybe getting into my
[1:02:46] uh more in the details but if I could
[1:02:48] say this why does God ask that you dress
[1:02:50] a certain way in in clothing for men too
[1:02:54] there's ways that we dress as men men
[1:02:56] that is uh uh that is signaling the
[1:02:58] wrong things how is it that we ought to
[1:03:01] present ourselves men even with our hair
[1:03:03] women with their long
[1:03:04] hair and even with makeup and these
[1:03:07] different things and all these different
[1:03:08] ways men and women can adore themselves
[1:03:11] how is the world ever going to know
[1:03:13] there's Holiness apartness and
[1:03:16] separateness if there's no way your life
[1:03:19] ever looks any different than the guy in
[1:03:21] the cubicle next to
[1:03:22] you it's one of the things we've been
[1:03:24] robbed of with the Advent of all these
[1:03:27] apps and if anything God might the devil
[1:03:28] might have given in and said look look
[1:03:30] look look there's certain people that I
[1:03:32] know are are in the body and and I can't
[1:03:35] I can't stop it but what I can do is
[1:03:37] maybe keep them from bringing their
[1:03:39] Bible to
[1:03:40] work because when people see a Bible
[1:03:42] they know they're reading the Bible and
[1:03:43] I'll just let them take an iPad to work
[1:03:46] and they won't know if they're you know
[1:03:48] on substack scrolling through somebody's
[1:03:50] newsletter or if they're uh reading the
[1:03:53] news they won't know the difference they
[1:03:54] say well this is you're really getting
[1:03:56] into this weird area brother and I'm
[1:03:58] only suggesting that there is a nature
[1:04:00] and character of God that needs to be
[1:04:02] expressed and the more ways the devil
[1:04:04] can take away from
[1:04:05] us the separateness and the apartness
[1:04:08] the L Christ or the Lord is being
[1:04:11] seen these are things to really think
[1:04:14] about their characteristics identify
[1:04:17] them as Holiness unto the Lord From
[1:04:18] Above therefore we are seeking a kingdom
[1:04:20] we're seeking a king to come and receive
[1:04:22] his subjects to his kingdom and they are
[1:04:24] identified by their character
[1:04:25] characteristics their Treasures are not
[1:04:27] of this Earth or this nation it's of
[1:04:29] above Glory they look for a city whose
[1:04:32] Builder and maker is God they're
[1:04:34] citizens of that City that's me
[1:04:35] interjecting we are citizens we are
[1:04:37] habitants of a holy Jerusalem our
[1:04:40] habitation is not this Earthly home it's
[1:04:42] not whatever zip code we may be in we
[1:04:44] have a spiritual present tense
[1:04:46] habitation and we're citizens of another
[1:04:49] law of another kingdom of another way
[1:04:51] it's a highway it's a separate way it's
[1:04:53] a holy way he says they are properly
[1:04:56] identified we ought to challenge
[1:04:58] ourselves brothers and sisters young
[1:05:00] people all of us need to have a wakeup
[1:05:02] call and a little bit of a check to say
[1:05:03] Lord what is it I'm doing in my life
[1:05:05] that can signal and to broadcast And to
[1:05:08] clarify that we are separate amen sir oh
[1:05:12] God help us to do it he says they're
[1:05:14] identified by its characteristics thank
[1:05:17] you Lord Brothers you could come to your
[1:05:20] instruments maybe brother Michael if he
[1:05:22] could just be ready to help in the post
[1:05:25] in 2 Corinthians chap 7:1 this is a
[1:05:28] phrase that has so much depth having
[1:05:32] therefore these promises dearly beloved
[1:05:34] let us cleanse ourselves from all
[1:05:36] filthiness of the Flesh and spirit
[1:05:39] notice how closely that Associates with
[1:05:41] first John that we who have this hope we
[1:05:43] purify ourselves having these promises
[1:05:47] let us cleanse
[1:05:48] ourselves now this isn't our this isn't
[1:05:51] a pre- sanctification that we do in
[1:05:53] order to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:05:58] the the soul is sacred it's
[1:06:01] sealed I don't know if I've ever I've
[1:06:04] never really quite tried to calculate it
[1:06:07] but if the sum and substance of the
[1:06:10] Gospel
[1:06:11] was you must be born again which is the
[1:06:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're
[1:06:15] sealed into the kingdom and then
[1:06:18] next next person right you need to be
[1:06:20] born again then I mean the Bible would
[1:06:23] end like in Matthew 3 it it it'd be a
[1:06:25] very short short scripture reading or
[1:06:28] maybe we'd have more to say go into all
[1:06:29] the world and baptize people and get
[1:06:31] them born again but so much of the word
[1:06:34] is is is likened unto this whereas God
[1:06:38] created the Heaven and the Earth and
[1:06:39] creation and came to a perfect Eden and
[1:06:41] placed his son or daughter there son and
[1:06:43] daughter there in that perfect Eden
[1:06:45] through a process of seven days which
[1:06:47] included a day of rest God is doing the
[1:06:49] same thing in our lives where there's
[1:06:51] this process of perfection that is being
[1:06:54] expressed
[1:06:56] and that it's not just a matter of us
[1:06:58] having our seal a seal of God upon our
[1:07:00] souls but now having been sealed let us
[1:07:02] cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of
[1:07:04] the Flesh and
[1:07:06] spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear
[1:07:09] of God perfecting Holiness if there is a
[1:07:14] Highway and a way and a way which is
[1:07:16] called Holiness a way speaks of manner
[1:07:18] of life it speaks of travel it speaks of
[1:07:20] Direction it speaks of
[1:07:23] progress and God is a God of a process
[1:07:26] just as much as he is the god of the
[1:07:29] product and sometimes we say well it's
[1:07:32] not just a matter about getting to the
[1:07:33] destination it's a matter of enjoying
[1:07:35] the journey and there may be some real
[1:07:37] hipster ways to describe it where we
[1:07:39] don't make the mistake of just wonder
[1:07:40] lust but we say well uh it's all about
[1:07:43] the journey doesn't matter if you get
[1:07:44] there well no that's not
[1:07:46] right we want to get there but God gets
[1:07:49] us there through a process so that when
[1:07:50] we arrive we fit there amen we can enjoy
[1:07:54] it while we're there
[1:07:56] we can be what he's called us to be when
[1:07:58] we're there in it's a way of Holiness
[1:08:01] it's a life of putting on the new man
[1:08:02] it's a life of continually purifying
[1:08:04] ourselves it's a life of perfecting
[1:08:06] Holiness in the fear of God that means
[1:08:09] Holiness this process that can bring
[1:08:11] something to Perfection
[1:08:14] completion it's even performing and
[1:08:16] accomplishing the purpose of Holiness
[1:08:18] this finish the purpose of moral Purity
[1:08:20] this modesty that we're to have this
[1:08:22] Immaculate cleansing has a purpose and
[1:08:24] an intent
[1:08:26] if we could try to draw from the several
[1:08:27] scriptures we used already today that
[1:08:29] we're to be carrying in on this course
[1:08:31] of righteousness and Holiness
[1:08:33] continually to live soberly and
[1:08:35] righteously and godly in the
[1:08:38] now says cleansing ourselves from all
[1:08:41] impure and unclean habits putting away
[1:08:43] anything that's an
[1:08:44] Abomination so that we can complete the
[1:08:46] purpose and fulfill the goal of
[1:08:50] Holiness Holiness is the character the
[1:08:54] characteristic of being set up apart for
[1:08:56] God not just set apart cuz some of us
[1:08:58] are in the sense of being
[1:09:01] different some of us are just set apart
[1:09:03] by birth right and we wouldn't make the
[1:09:06] mistake of saying that's the Holiness
[1:09:07] God wants they're just different right
[1:09:10] The Ugly Duckling was
[1:09:12] different and we're not just called to
[1:09:14] be different and be contrarians and go
[1:09:16] against the grain and fight everything
[1:09:17] and We're Not Making Peace at all but
[1:09:19] Holiness this Holiness we're talking
[1:09:21] about is a separateness this
[1:09:22] characteristic of being set apart for
[1:09:24] God in order to reflect his
[1:09:26] character and in doing so I want to be
[1:09:28] circumspect about the things that
[1:09:29] interrupt his expression that would
[1:09:32] Mar the image of God In My
[1:09:35] Flesh that would bring any evil
[1:09:39] favored because as we pursue Holiness
[1:09:42] God is
[1:09:43] unveiled God is made
[1:09:45] known by this sacred symmetry in your
[1:09:50] life have you ever noticed that in the
[1:09:52] word of God that as you read and and as
[1:09:54] you go through go through the word of
[1:09:56] God and you read no matter what you read
[1:09:57] and how much you read there's just
[1:09:58] always this beautiful picture that just
[1:10:00] keeps
[1:10:01] unfolding and it same with the message
[1:10:03] of the hour as you get into it and you
[1:10:05] open up your heart uh in sincerity
[1:10:07] before the Lord in prayer and and you
[1:10:09] just want to you want to learn of the
[1:10:11] Lord and learn of his nature and
[1:10:12] character you just realize there's this
[1:10:13] beautiful
[1:10:14] Symmetry and then sometimes something
[1:10:16] comes up and you're like well that I
[1:10:17] don't even know what that I don't even
[1:10:19] know what that means how can anyone know
[1:10:20] what that means this is this is
[1:10:22] different and then as you keep reading
[1:10:23] you just realize it becomes part of this
[1:10:25] picture picture you're like
[1:10:27] wow why because God is a god of divine
[1:10:30] proportion it's a god of beauty and
[1:10:32] really at the end of the day beauty is
[1:10:34] what
[1:10:36] inspires and if if we are going to be
[1:10:38] his voice if we're going to be his
[1:10:41] people we want to have an inspirational
[1:10:43] Beauty in our
[1:10:45] lives and I'm very I'm being very
[1:10:47] deliberate in the way that I express
[1:10:49] this because I having been raised in the
[1:10:51] message and uh and not that I was part
[1:10:54] of this particular not that my parents
[1:10:56] were this way I found my parents in a
[1:10:58] lot of ways uh extended a lot more grace
[1:11:00] than I think maybe they should have uh
[1:11:03] but being raised in the message you
[1:11:04] witness it you could be close to
[1:11:06] situations and scenarios where there's
[1:11:07] this really strict legalistic
[1:11:09] enforcement of
[1:11:12] parameters and I know I've been
[1:11:13] emphasizing this a lot over the last
[1:11:15] couple years so that at first glance
[1:11:18] when you look at it it looks
[1:11:21] holy but when you look at the way the
[1:11:23] picture is created
[1:11:25] that's not the way of God that's not his
[1:11:29] nature and I I implore anyone who may
[1:11:32] hear this anyone here today who's been
[1:11:34] resistant to the holy spirit because
[1:11:36] they don't like the image they saw when
[1:11:39] its work was attributed to a certain way
[1:11:41] that's not the way of
[1:11:43] Christ yes he's a god of Holiness yes
[1:11:46] he's a God that comes into your life
[1:11:47] will turn things upside down he's a God
[1:11:49] that's going to correct you when you do
[1:11:50] things wrong he's a God that doesn't
[1:11:52] make excuses for uh immorality and
[1:11:54] impurity it and all sorts of fornication
[1:11:56] and lust he doesn't make an excuse for
[1:11:58] that if you see others who haven't been
[1:12:00] judged and even you yourself haven't
[1:12:01] faced the punishment of it that's not
[1:12:03] because God's attitude towards it hasn't
[1:12:05] changed and if it's not preached as much
[1:12:08] even over this Pulpit or other places
[1:12:10] and now certain things are more
[1:12:12] emphasized than others that doesn't mean
[1:12:14] God's attitude has ever
[1:12:17] changed as sister Rebecca saying we've
[1:12:20] got to come back to an
[1:12:21] absolute and our absolute if I could
[1:12:24] just phrase it this way it is the word
[1:12:25] of God and and the the the absolute is
[1:12:29] is this scripture but the word the
[1:12:32] scripture reveals to us his nature and
[1:12:35] his way not just the
[1:12:37] artwork we want to enter into the
[1:12:40] process oh God I want to fully engage in
[1:12:43] your process as a
[1:12:45] Potter and I want to be a clay that
[1:12:48] fills your fingers and I want to
[1:12:50] experience your the your loving hand in
[1:12:52] the water and I want to know those
[1:12:54] moments when you tear me down only to
[1:12:56] experience those moments when you begin
[1:12:58] to build me back up Lord I don't want to
[1:13:01] just be a a vas set upon a shelf I don't
[1:13:04] want to just be some finished product
[1:13:05] that you just immediately put through
[1:13:06] the K but oh God I want you to take out
[1:13:09] anything that's insincere I want you to
[1:13:11] perfect this work
[1:13:13] amen God help us to
[1:13:17] be
[1:13:19] holy perfecting
[1:13:22] Holiness that's a living phrase isn't it
[1:13:26] perfecting
[1:13:27] Holiness God help us to do
[1:13:30] that amen if we could bow our heads in
[1:13:32] prayer and you stand with me let's
[1:13:37] [Music]
[1:13:53] pray let me emphasize this to all of us
[1:13:56] there's a standard of living that God
[1:13:58] desires of
[1:14:02] us and with I don't want to make the
[1:14:05] mistake of tending
[1:14:06] to
[1:14:10] uh give an excuse to anyone to continue
[1:14:12] to live in
[1:14:14] impurity but if the Bible is telling the
[1:14:16] believer that they're to put on the born
[1:14:18] again to put on you're created in
[1:14:20] Holiness and in
[1:14:22] righteousness uh you to you're to purify
[1:14:26] yourself you're to cleanse yourself and
[1:14:28] these things are all post salvation post
[1:14:33] seal then it could be said that there
[1:14:37] is this greater measure of separateness
[1:14:40] that we can achieve not as a means of
[1:14:43] gaining our salvation but as a means of
[1:14:46] pleasing the Lord and fulfilling his
[1:14:47] purpose in our
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:52] life and
[1:14:57] therefore there is the
[1:15:00] danger of us being completely
[1:15:03] [Music]
[1:15:05] muted HD under a
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:09] bushel fitting in with the
[1:15:14] world how many of your friends and your
[1:15:17] Associates outside of your immediate
[1:15:18] family and I'm not talking about H
[1:15:20] school but at school know you're a
[1:15:23] Christian
[1:15:25] [Music]
[1:15:29] a Christian perhaps different than the
[1:15:31] other
[1:15:33] [Music]
[1:15:35] Christians God help us gracious heavenly
[1:15:39] father today Lord as we close this
[1:15:41] service we desired to Worship in your
[1:15:43] presence and Lord I extended beyond the
[1:15:45] time frame that I had originally
[1:15:47] allotted to minister within but I just
[1:15:50] felt such a beautiful pull from the
[1:15:52] people and an openness to continue to
[1:15:53] hear
[1:15:55] in this I I'm grateful for their
[1:15:57] attitude and expectation to allow me to
[1:15:59] come to the end of my
[1:16:01] notes and so Lord I pray that you could
[1:16:03] just take it from here and I do want to
[1:16:06] impress upon the people so Lord I pray
[1:16:08] that you de with their hearts that we
[1:16:10] must give examination of any uncleanness
[1:16:13] or impurity seen or
[1:16:15] unseen and that women are to dress dress
[1:16:20] modestly and Lord we don't take out the
[1:16:22] tape measure and we don't try to figure
[1:16:24] out out you know who's wearing the
[1:16:26] highest heels and who has the the most
[1:16:28] dangerous uh skirt
[1:16:30] length but Lord It's incumbent upon the
[1:16:32] individual to examine themselves and ask
[1:16:34] is this a way that's pleasing to the
[1:16:36] Lord is this a is this an expression of
[1:16:40] beauty that can be attractive
[1:16:43] to the the the lost and the lame and the
[1:16:45] weak would this stumble the
[1:16:49] weak and Lord I know that the legalistic
[1:16:52] agenda and motivation of decades past is
[1:16:55] maybe put a Scarlet Letter and a bad
[1:16:56] taste in our mouths in terms of things
[1:16:59] that we dress and things that we do and
[1:17:01] whether it be sports or Recreation or
[1:17:03] entertainment there's this distaste for
[1:17:06] this unnecessary ugliness and legalism
[1:17:09] that bound people by
[1:17:11] fear so Lord I pray that you just
[1:17:13] liberate our hearts give us a sense that
[1:17:16] we're safe in your arms and that we're
[1:17:18] secure in your
[1:17:20] love and reteach
[1:17:22] us these paths
[1:17:26] so Lord that my way as a father could be
[1:17:28] plain for my son
[1:17:32] Elliott that my way as a man could be
[1:17:35] even plain for my daughter
[1:17:37] Eliza that my way as a
[1:17:40] friend oh Lord just how much we love to
[1:17:42] joke around and be witty and laugh and
[1:17:46] have a good time but Lord I I I want my
[1:17:49] life to be plainly
[1:17:52] holy that no matter what things we could
[1:17:54] enjoy joy in the world and what
[1:17:56] Recreations we can engage in and if we
[1:17:58] wear branded gear or we like a baseball
[1:18:00] hat or a sports team or sisters dress
[1:18:02] fashionably that no matter what it is
[1:18:04] there's some symmetry to the way that we
[1:18:07] live some moderation to those things
[1:18:10] that show yes we're human but we're
[1:18:13] sacred we're set apart we're
[1:18:17] Sanctified wake us up oh God I pray to
[1:18:21] recognize those things that defile deep
[1:18:23] within and set us at Liberty to pursue
[1:18:26] Holiness with everything that is in us
[1:18:29] for that is what the scripture is asking
[1:18:30] us of us to cleanse ourselves and to
[1:18:33] perfecting Holiness it's the pursuit of
[1:18:36] Holiness continually every day of our
[1:18:40] life it's the process we're in Lord and
[1:18:42] I want to fully submit and I ask that
[1:18:43] you bless the people that have been
[1:18:45] gathered here today those that may
[1:18:47] stream anyone on the archives Lord or
[1:18:48] live now Lord I pray that you would in
[1:18:51] your special way touch and awaken them
[1:18:54] to you your presence and your desire for
[1:18:56] Holiness in our lives we love you we ask
[1:18:59] this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:02] Christ amen oh God help us
