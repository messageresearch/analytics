TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my theme tonight is where is my place I'd like to start once again with the testimony it could be the second part of what we spoke of last time Cristiano I believe that for a Christian to a body what part of that body are we okay what role should we unveil says at least that was one of the most difficult questions that I asked myself at the beginning of my Christian walk if I'm a part of that body okay then what part am I okay importante I believe we'd all like to be an important part of the body but you know there's some parts that you don't even see is so important just like any vital organ esposa the other day I was talking to my wife the last company what's one of the simplest parts of the body she said the nail yeah I said yeah possibly but that nail if it's not there if we were to just rip it off possibly a deadly infection can enter in so that has an important role too to protect the rest of the entire body by simply allowing for deadly infection to not get into the body because it can reach your heart you can reach your mind it can reach any other vital organs without caring of how important it is and that vital organ depends upon that nail or any part of our skin does its purpose of not allowing any infection to enter in as he is that's how it is in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ also I mean yes and even going back to my childhood the omis Padres well my parents when they accepted the Lord Jesus Christ in Mexico they started in the Pentecostal Church in Mexico back in the 80s foreign and that was back in the times where they still believe you had to speak in tongues and all those things were a sign of the Holy Ghost s so then every time there was a service I remember that there were people that would just speak in tongues and I was never able to speak in tongues and that traumatized me because I I was I believe for a very long time that I could never receive the Holy Ghost because I couldn't speak in tongues and that took me for a long time to ask myself this is why can't I receive the Holy Ghost and then afterwards what is my place in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ I remember that there'd be evenings and I'm talking about my adolescence that I'd wake up in the middle of the night and I go and see because in the denominations they would teach that the Rapture would be from one moment to the next that at any moment it would happen and my worry was so much did I remember I'd wake up in the middle of the night to see if Mama was still in bed and it was a real trauma that I had in my adolescence but thanks to God that he sent a messenger to clear up all these things but the most beautiful thing is or at least the way that I see it para me for me it's that he chose me to believe what that messenger has brought us I would have been the same thing many times just to the simple things we don't give it the importance that's necessary just see each and everyone's place or at least this helped me out we've got to study e and entender understand the three stages of Grace when brother Aaron was preaching last weekend when we left when we exited church because I already knew I was going to preach this Wednesday I said brother Aaron already preached the theme that I was going to preach I believe in my heart Brethren okay everyone can unveil it in a different way and it could be of a help for the people well that's the way I see it I see it this way if we would put up a picture Nosotros in front of us and we ask every single person to describe that picture possibly the most outstanding thing in the picture we'd all mention is but you'll find that within that description there'll be very different details within that picture the angle in which we're looking at it that's why I understand my brother Branham says that doctrines should not separate us because each and every one of us look at it from a different angle but we should all be tolerant with one another I believe that we come to get to that point like the first Pentecostal Church Holy Ghost to come down I believe that's our intention as a group to get to that point because to get to that point we've got to take all of our ideas all of our beliefs and get to the point of the word of God I was even talking with our brother Marcos there in the back with about this precise thing about this church and I said look um and I don't remember the exact topic we were talking about but I said even in the first Pentecostal Church just notice how it describes that church the way they were so perfect it was like they're already in the Millennium it says that they had so much love they'd bring all of their goods foreign but I said but notice and you continue reading if you keep reading that church didn't last too long it says that the complaints began right away that's why we've got to be careful Brothers and I believe it's Our intention to get to the point of that description of the first church before the murmuring begins amongst us but unfortunately the murmuring always comes first but we keep on walking Anton says so then for me to be able to stand position what is my position in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ I have to understand the three stages of Grace [Applause] and understand what stage am I standing in because the three stages they can pass depending on the person God can do a Miracles and send you from justification unto the new birth but there's people that we struggle more there's people that stay behind in justification others that stay in sanctification and sometimes and we're going to read it right now in a little bit I Believe In My Heart ification that even in sanctification it's the most dangerous stage why is I like to read in the church order the museum 1958 brother Branham says the following is it's simply like many many times that I've talked it's like picking up a cup out there in the chicken coop eration justification is like picking it up being ready to use it for a purpose in the heart sanctification sanctification we know okay it's the stage where the person accepts the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior he comes they get baptized but they continue to be filthy yeah and that's where we sometimes make mistakes with those people because we want to see them walking like people that have the Holy Ghost s that they're in a process of being cleansed and we sometimes make the mistakes that if we see them make a mistake who criticize them instead of helping them ano if the brother in justification we see him smoke or any other thing we need to help them he's in the process of sanctification then follows sanctification and I think they're the devil for me personally he kept me in that place for a long time brother Branham says I really like the example he gives here in this preaching because he Compares it to a cup or a glass crucification is justifications when he picks it up sanctification is when it's washed it's about so that cup is washed it's no longer dirty then he's cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a word is a compound word that means cleansed and set apart for service and that's sometimes another mistake that we make okay or that I have committed because we think that God's already taken everything away from us yes and we're ready to go confront the devils or many times because we think that we're cleansed and washed that's when we start to feel Superior to the rest of the brethren that's the most dangerous stage because that's when the devil can make us believe that we've reached the goal nasimiento of the new birth but we still haven't gotten there yet you're cleansed but we've got to keep on walking the serpent is still there and justification the serpent is still there in sanctification and in sanctification the serpent isn't there nor is the the dove there we're going to read in Matthew 12 43. foreign when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none then he says I will return into my house from whence I came out and when he has come he findeth it empty swept and garnished Anton says primero then go with he and take it with him seven other Spirits more wicker than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of the man is worse than the first that's sanctification Brothers you're clean but that vessel it's got to be filled yes and it can't stay empty for too long something's got to fill it up and that's where we go to the example of brother Branham when he talks about the two dogs depend upon it depends upon what that heart's going to be filled with what are we going to fill it with and even to me the devil deceived me for a long time in that stage instead of going forward he made me believe that I've reached the point of receiving the Holy Ghost because I no longer had any vices del mundo no more attraction for the worldly things but it took me to the other side unto the religious yes and that anointing it's very heavy because you spend your time judging everybody pensando thinking that I had already received the Holy Ghost and I remember that I'd ask myself then when and where am I going to know that I've received the Holy Ghost and how will I know well now I know how soon experiencia it's an experience Unforgettable is it's like when a child is born you know something happened but you don't even know what happened [Music] Johnny Alvarado preached it stayed recorded in my mind and he said this phrase he said you won't know he won't know if the experience you had on Sunday was of God or no or not until Monday comes around yeah and at that moment I didn't understand that but now I do understand it when we get to work oh even before when we've got to wake up our kids for school that's when you have to start to manifest that experience that we had on Sunday at church or you had in your bedroom or wherever it is that you received that new birth and we know to enter into the mystical body of our Lord Jesus Christ we need that new birth Brothers we can't be apart of the mystical body of our Lord Jesus Christ until you and I have been born again but you know even just thinking about that in receiving the new birth is many times the question still lingers well then what should I do now no predico I Don't Preach that's what I would say to myself no Kanto I don't sing I don't play music I'm not good with public relations well then what role do I play here I don't know if you've ever asked yourself that same question that Joshua gave the position to every tribe then the Holy Ghost comes and to every one of us he gives us our position and even meditating on it brother Branham says even the way we compose ourselves just thinking and meditating and speaking about what we have to unveilation I was talking with my wife and I was telling her did you know that if we read the Bible and the message there's four bodies that we pertain to Primera first of all this body that God has given us that we've got to take care of foreign because it's a temple of the Holy Spirit that's the first body she says well what's the second body Bueno well if you go and we go to the Bible the Bible says that man is the head of the woman so for the man there's a second body because I don't think there's a head without a body right and then the Third the local church and then the fourth is the mystical body of our Lord Jesus Christ and every one of them depends upon us because like we were talking we've got to present esta cuerpo this body limpio clean and even one of those bodies depends upon every one of the members foreign but even going back to the three stages of Grace why is it important to know what stage we're in because in that manner we can go forward the Holy Spirit remember that there's a very common phrase I thank God okay I might not be what I want to be pero United but I'm no longer what I used to be as I meditate upon that is then I asked myself another question thank you because I'm not what I used to be but why am I not yet what I'm supposed to be possible possibly I know that I am not what I'm supposed to be hace but why haven't I gotten to the point of being what I'm supposed to be if you've given us everything you've given us the message you've given us teachings he if he is importante and if you notice what's important why we should know our position this is in adoption to teach the Bible is usually a bit delicate you know it's more or less like walking on thin ice but we know that in reaching this point and at this time so it could be good to bring the church to the point of what I'm thinking to a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus sometimes I believe the preaching it's something marvelous and the teaching goes further than that is like it's especially for the church and here you wanna I wanna stay here just for a moment I believe this is where we should thank God because God's given us a man with my heart that he's a good teacher that brings teachings we're privileged and having a man that worries to bring teachings to bring us a teaching places every one of us but sometimes when things become common is we forget how valuable that which God has given us is but the teaching the teaching coloca alombre it locates the man positionalment is positionally in what he is I believe that we're on our way to that I believe we receive good teachers every time we come to church what we are Mente what we are well and I'm going to say this is and I heard it and I also believe it I believe the devil Devil's scared that someone comes and gets baptized the devil's not scared of someone going through sanctification I think sometimes the devil is not even scared when we receive the new birth I believe that he starts to worry cuando when you and I receive we receive departed that revelation of what we are is what we're going to unveil God reveals to us what our post is there's nothing that can hold us back yes and the devil knows this is already lost that battle meter I know that the devil plays a lot with our mind I was telling my wife because she would tell me it's difficult to understand okay [Music] because brother Branham says that from our composure depende it dependsion the blessing or the curse in the local body is and then you go and he gives the example the Josue of Joshua cuando Khan when can cerebellum took the the mantle of Jericho nombre but first by one single man that committed a mistake many people died and brother Brandon brings that to us he says many times that's why there's no beers that's why many times we don't see the Holy Spirit operate in our group because our composure it's not the right one is k Dios de Manifesto that God manifests and it's because many times I don't know if we just don't understand or we're scared of the responsibility because there are people that are scared of their responsibility it is a great responsibility well first we need to understand if we consider ourselves members of this local body Ramos and if we do consider ourselves even the things we do in the most private part of our homes they can come and jeopardize the next service that's the responsibility we all have as members of everybody Marcos I was telling the brother Marcos and I was telling them he was telling me how they're in the church that he attends he does all that they ask of him any little thing he's like a spare tire and I said well that's the position that God loves the most because once we receive a title yeah we don't want to do anything else that we think that doesn't pertain to the title that we've got I believe that the best position is that one obreros is a laborer God needs laborers and if we go to the definition of a laborer and labor is the one that's willing to do any job he possibly might not be the best one but he's willing to do it just see the devil tortured me for a long time I felt and I still feel that's what I was telling the brothers I don't consider myself a good speaker but since God revealed to me and let me understand yeah okay no es for Mis abilidades it's not because of my abilities is because of what he can do through me I would tell him if I was here 10 years ago brother Aaron would have asked me to preach the most probable thing would be I wouldn't preach because that whole time I just be comparing myself to him and that's true brother yes and that sometimes what impedes us from doing the job for God that we think and we can't do it the way another person we think is better for us but I would tell the brother God let me understand okay that is if he wants me to do a job that's because I'm the best to do that job at that moment AR without caring how many better there are or especially or Specialists there are at that moment at that place put over the ncil because I'm standing out of obedience to him he's got to back me up that's when one can understand when you understand your position is and this scripture in First Corinthians 12 27 helped me understand the scripture took away many traumas it made me understand my position in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ is one of the scriptures that has helped me the most in my spiritual walk and it raises First Corinthians 12 27 and 28. in particular now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and we are what miembros members Del cuerpo de Cristo of the body of Christ IA and God had set them set some in the church Primera first apostolis apostles I said up no I'm not an apostle secondarily Prophets tampoco not that one either I can't see things I can't discerno Maestro thirdly teachers just to understand things much less to teach them after that Miracles and the gifts of healing forgive me Lord for not being able to reach this faith yet I told the Lord at that moment tampoco and I also haven't reached that Faith where you do Miracles and you heal no no no no internet I don't fall in any of these days these categories of those that I just read don't understand me me position then where's my position helps and there God gave me one of my best experiences those that help not soy Apostle not an apostle Maestro I'm not a teacher so it's in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ my position to help it's one of the biggest spiritual feasts I've had because I'm going to show any kind of anything is Supernatural but I said anything outstanding to be a part of the body of Jesus Christ those that help but hello but then afterwards those that help but you've also got to observe the attitude I believe that when we've got the Holy Ghost when God reveals to us the position in every body that we pertain to no neces we don't have to be something extraordinary we need to be we need to have the will to be someone that can help because many times I mean when I was cutting hair we had a client OS he told us the same he said notice always what helps the least is what bothers the most and that applies to any part of life what helps the least and look at Massachusetts bothers the most I said Lord I believe I've taken that position for a long time in church forgive me help me I said to be someone that can help investorbe and not bother because always to be helped us but when are we willing to help now remember one thing God's pleased more lower than sacrifice he embasses and sometimes it must possible it's easier just make a sacrifice then give obedience because obedience many times goes against what we want to do right and sometimes we've got to obey embassies without even understanding it a and we always want to understand it first no no obedient obedience give me that just see I also learned another thing once you've got the Holy Ghost you've got that confidence that you have the Holy Ghost I stopped being scared to obedience why has given us a filter well it depends upon everyone's filter he's given us a filter of the word of God to take anything and pass it through that filter but I believe that we've got a good leader and thank God he's not here right now for many times we want the leaders to tell us what we want to do but once you're in position in the body of Jesus Christ you've got the Holy Ghost you know hombre that another man with the Holy Ghost isn't going to send you to do something wrong and if he sends you to do something wrong I believe it with my heart and if you comment to him he's willing to change our composure once again it's very important not just because we give a testimony to the rest of the world to our families but because there's many brothers that they're blessings in the Church isos of our actions and our Acts and this is sometimes espesado I've expressed but it's the truth that's why what is our position what do we desire S I believe that the best thing we can desire obviously it's the new birth and he'll take us onto our position our vediencia to obedience ASE and then Corazon I believe it in my heart it's a former group Santo where the Holy Spirit can manifest in every service Brothers take us into a Unity where there's love because it seems like ultimate lately amongst the people of the message or the people that believe in the message every day there's more divisions and when when on the contrary we should be more united what do we listen to who are we listening to por que podemuses because sometimes we can bring a curse onto our group our composure that's why it's important to know what is our position because the rest of the body depends it depends upon every one of us this evening
