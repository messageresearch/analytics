[0:00] I know there's a lot that is expressed
[0:02] in this uh this phrase here and even to
[0:05] the point to where it might be
[0:07] um you know thought provoking and in
[0:09] large degree as far as Wonder lust and
[0:11] wonder lost
[0:13] um my thesis statement is finding the
[0:15] Wonder of Christ in an age of wonderlust
[0:18] in an age where the things of Christ are
[0:20] so devalued and the value of the word is
[0:22] being smothered over the things of God
[0:25] are being lost in
[0:27] um in apathy or just the agnostic
[0:29] there's a lot of uh even as it said I
[0:33] think it's the agnostic that just admits
[0:35] that you're just being lazy they don't
[0:36] want to wrestle with the real questions
[0:38] but there's a there's a lot that this
[0:40] age is characterized by that I feel that
[0:43] Christ has just lost its Grandeur it's
[0:46] kind of lost that attraction because
[0:47] we've allowed ourselves to be pulled in
[0:49] these other directions and so my whole
[0:51] thought in this is that we would be
[0:53] awakened to the glory of Christ and just
[0:56] be thrilled with him and excited about
[0:58] the things of God
[1:00] and so with Wonder lost and we're just
[1:02] going to track uh what we were on
[1:04] Wednesday night we're just going to kind
[1:05] of back up and go over this so with
[1:07] Wonder loss what we're looking at is
[1:09] when we lose our sense of all for the
[1:11] things of God uh even to the point if
[1:13] somebody was to testify and say um you
[1:15] know I this happened or I was healed of
[1:17] this or God did this and God did that
[1:19] that we kind of get jaded which the
[1:21] sense of Jade it is like did you see it
[1:23] so much it just kind of that's no big
[1:25] deal been there done that and kind of
[1:27] loses the thrill and so Wonder loss is
[1:29] when we lose our sense of all and even
[1:31] our respect and reverence
[1:33] um for God where we're not fearful of
[1:35] him and we're not thinking about him and
[1:37] reverencing the fact that he is a just
[1:39] God or we don't reverence the fact that
[1:41] he's a God that wants our praise and
[1:43] wants our fellowship and it kind of
[1:46] encompasses a loss of excitement for the
[1:48] things of God and maybe Wonder lost I'm
[1:50] wanting us to consider whether or not
[1:51] there has been some uh watering down of
[1:55] our amazement of Christ uh brother bam
[1:58] uses the statement in the church age
[1:59] book I wonder for efficiently impressed
[2:01] with the word that is in our midst so we
[2:04] may be impressed but if you're not
[2:06] impressed to the sufficiency in other
[2:08] words does what it's supposed to then
[2:09] there's some amazement that's been lost
[2:11] there's some benefit that we're not
[2:13] receiving we used Isaiah 9 6 on
[2:15] Wednesday night as our text and our
[2:17] opening scripture and how it says about
[2:19] Jesus Christ that his name Shall be
[2:21] Called wonderful it says his name Shall
[2:23] be Called It means he will be and I can
[2:26] say He is wonderful to be wonderful it
[2:29] means he's full of wonder and if Christ
[2:32] is full of wonder then there's wonder
[2:34] that you can experience if he's full of
[2:36] wonder and we're to see Jesus Christ in
[2:38] every verse then there should be wonder
[2:40] that we're experiencing if he's if he's
[2:42] revealing himself today and we see the
[2:44] revelation of Jesus Christ and he's
[2:46] making himself known to us then that
[2:47] should be full of wonder and and as
[2:50] wonderful speaks of something that is
[2:51] marvelous or a Marvel and even the word
[2:54] marvel itself is a miracle so Christ is
[2:56] a miracle Miracles ought to excite our
[2:58] faith Miracles vindicate God's presence
[3:00] and there's a lot that we could say
[3:02] about what a Marvel is it's something
[3:04] that causes astonishment it is something
[3:07] that would strike us with wonder to be
[3:10] shocked to be amazed that's what I'm
[3:12] thinking about in terms of this all or
[3:13] this Wonder of Jesus Christ and brother
[3:15] Brahm says about Christ and the word he
[3:18] said it shouldn't thrill us
[3:20] should be fresh every day just new to us
[3:23] all the time just Thrills us to feed and
[3:26] feast on the word of God
[3:30] and the way that this has struck me and
[3:32] I would say even the way that the word
[3:33] of God has been striking me is there's
[3:36] uh there's a way that and I can say
[3:38] let's just put it on ourselves and not
[3:40] accuse anybody who handles the word of
[3:42] God of doing this but we use the word as
[3:44] kind of a a a caudible to beat ourselves
[3:47] or some kind of hammer to inflict wounds
[3:49] and we're just constantly beating
[3:51] ourselves and we read this and say all
[3:52] the words should thrill me it doesn't
[3:54] then something's wrong with me or I'm
[3:56] not a Believer I don't have the Holy
[3:58] Ghost there's a way that we use the word
[3:59] of God to kind of measure ourselves
[4:02] short as opposed to using the word of
[4:04] God as a measure of what God's promised
[4:05] and so what I've taken to do and when I
[4:08] look into the word of God is if he says
[4:09] that you shall be born again that I
[4:11] don't lament that I'm not born again I
[4:13] just believe hey there's a promise of a
[4:14] new birth if I if I see that the new
[4:17] birth carries with it certain promises
[4:18] and I'm not experiencing them I don't
[4:20] say oh great I'm never going to have
[4:21] them I just say that's what I ought to
[4:23] believe for him and so when he says it
[4:25] should thrill us I don't believe that
[4:27] this is Judgment if it doesn't it's just
[4:29] it's opportunity Unity for us to
[4:31] experience the thrill of Christ on a
[4:33] daily basis and if it's not fresh every
[4:35] day it's something that you can wake up
[4:37] every morning and when you two you put
[4:38] your two feet on the ground you say Lord
[4:40] make it fresh
[4:41] I want it fresh today my brother Matthew
[4:43] was known at a restaurant in the Dallas
[4:45] Fort Worth area he was literally known
[4:47] as fresh fries and there was a manager
[4:50] of a barbecue restaurant that said he
[4:52] was looking through a phone book one day
[4:53] and there was my brother's picture and
[4:55] he goes Hey look it's fresh fries
[4:56] because my brother always says I want
[4:59] fresh fries wherever he's ordering it
[5:00] even if he's not ordering fries he says
[5:02] if you don't know I want fresh fries and
[5:04] that's something that he expects it's
[5:06] something that maybe you asked for when
[5:07] you go to fast food establishments on a
[5:09] daily basis is you want it fresh that's
[5:11] what we have every right to ask God for
[5:13] is it as it fresh it should be fresh
[5:16] every day and just thrill us to feed and
[5:18] feast on the word of God this is a
[5:20] promise and so this is what we're
[5:22] looking at is Awakening The Wonder of
[5:24] Christ something that Thrills us to be
[5:25] thrilled by him to find him exciting and
[5:29] maybe in the way of analogy for a young
[5:31] you know a young couple when they get
[5:33] they meet first meet and they first fall
[5:34] in love everything's new and exciting
[5:36] and every notification that comes
[5:38] through causes some sort of excitement
[5:40] and it used to be that you would run to
[5:42] the mailbox or you'd see the Western
[5:44] Pony or whatever it was the Pony Express
[5:46] coming by or the train would pull up to
[5:48] the train depot and you'd be out waiting
[5:49] for the mailbag off the train and
[5:52] waiting for that letter from the girl
[5:53] you like or the boy you like and there
[5:55] was always this excitement and these
[5:57] butterflies and this thrill to talk to
[5:59] him to hear him to see him and and it
[6:01] went through time love can mature
[6:03] towards not that type of love but there
[6:05] still should be an excitement there
[6:07] there should be still it should be a
[6:09] thrill I think that's the way it should
[6:10] be with Christ that we still find him
[6:12] exciting we still find him engaging it's
[6:14] wonderful to go out to dinner and you
[6:16] see a a couple that has been married for
[6:18] many many years or maybe there's ones
[6:20] that you know and you've watched them
[6:21] could be your parents or some Associates
[6:23] they've been married for 50 60 years but
[6:26] they still just they hold one another's
[6:27] hands and they still talk to each other
[6:29] and they still share things and it's
[6:31] it's like man they've been together in
[6:33] the same room for 70 years and they
[6:35] still have things to talk about
[6:36] and I think that's a beautiful thing
[6:38] when there's still something about
[6:40] somebody that intrigues you and you find
[6:42] exciting and that's when I'm wanting to
[6:43] capture with the thought of Wonder loss
[6:45] is let's not lose the Wonder of Christ
[6:48] now with wonderlust
[6:50] that were their Wonder lost it's that
[6:52] combination has the Germanic Roots it's
[6:55] a strong longing for impulse that would
[6:57] be the lust part for wondering and
[7:00] wondering it's this is not I'm not using
[7:03] wonderlust in the sense that you enjoy
[7:05] travel or you like going on Hikes and
[7:07] just seeing which way it'll take you I'm
[7:09] looking more to this just inclination
[7:11] and this Lust For pointless uh roaming
[7:15] for this aimless wandering aimless
[7:18] travel to where it's like I just feel I
[7:20] just want to meander I just want to go
[7:22] it doesn't matter to me what what the
[7:24] end point is I just I just want to be
[7:26] just Journey it's kind of a restlessness
[7:28] and one way I definitely want to capture
[7:30] this it's a fruitlessness to where all
[7:32] they're measuring is the journey and not
[7:34] the destination and so wonderlust uh is
[7:38] being used to look at all the different
[7:40] Pursuits the aimless Pursuits that we
[7:43] have in our lives and the things that we
[7:45] engage in and the wonderlust is is
[7:48] referring to things that we just kind of
[7:50] are driven to do things that we like to
[7:52] do that are aimless that are pointless
[7:54] that are fruitless that are causing the
[7:57] loss of Wonder for the things that are
[7:59] real and of God
[8:00] the things that are actually that are
[8:03] simple and and not extravagant in a
[8:06] worldly sense it's not the glitter but
[8:07] it's something that's glowing and so
[8:09] that's what's encompassed in the phrase
[8:11] wonderlust for me and we touched on this
[8:14] Wednesday night and I'm really just
[8:15] building right off of this
[8:17] is that there are many meaningless
[8:19] Pursuits that are uh that are driven by
[8:23] dopamine as well maybe come back to that
[8:25] towards the end it says dopamine cycle
[8:27] it's a chemical release in the brain
[8:28] there's things that we are doing that
[8:30] are triggering triggering a release of a
[8:32] chemical in our brain and it's causing
[8:34] us to kind of get into this cycle that
[8:37] is robbing us of The Wonder of God
[8:39] because we're kind of caught in this
[8:41] this Loop this addictive Loop in our
[8:43] flesh and in our minds and so restoring
[8:46] Wonder begins with identifying those
[8:49] influences that have stolen The Wonder
[8:51] of Christ
[8:52] that's where we're wanting to begin is
[8:54] looking at the things that have stolen
[8:56] The Wonder of Christ that's how we begin
[8:58] with restoring it so today is very very
[9:00] practical uh and and in that it might
[9:03] seem very simple and you'll be able to
[9:05] identify so quickly with everything that
[9:07] we share today but I really want you to
[9:09] focus because I wouldn't want the
[9:10] Simplicity of it to kind of lose its
[9:13] gravity oh well that's simple because I
[9:15] think this is very very heavy very very
[9:17] significant
[9:18] and my title today is the death of
[9:21] patience and for the doctors in the room
[9:23] that might make them Flinch a little bit
[9:24] but it's a different patience uh the the
[9:28] death of patients is my title
[9:31] and I want to give you an outline at the
[9:33] outset so as you consider this title
[9:35] write that down the death of patients I
[9:37] want to give you my outline and we're
[9:39] going to begin first by going back
[9:42] through what we've ministered on reward
[9:44] in rewards because uh I thought I was
[9:46] done with the subject of rewards uh it's
[9:48] not up to me and I think it's largely up
[9:50] to you and what your desires are and I
[9:52] had a lot of feedback from one saying
[9:54] man I really enjoyed that series on
[9:56] rewards we're excited about the next one
[9:57] but I saw God just bring it right back
[10:00] into view so we're going to be carrying
[10:01] on some themes from the series on
[10:03] rewards but patience the first thing I
[10:05] want to look at is patience leads to
[10:07] Rewards we're going to build this
[10:09] through scripture and you can keep that
[10:10] title slide up there
[10:12] um we'll come to this next brother
[10:13] brother Mitch I know I didn't give you
[10:15] much Direction but patience leads to
[10:17] rewards and what I want to look at is
[10:19] how that there's this process of
[10:20] creating motivation that God has and
[10:23] that he has a way of reinforcing certain
[10:26] things this is God's way this is a
[10:28] scriptural way this is God knowing how
[10:29] the human works and he's using this
[10:32] principle the principle of patience is
[10:34] used in the context of attaining to
[10:36] blessings and rewards and certain things
[10:38] and the next part will be patience in
[10:41] this morning hopefully we can get to it
[10:43] this morning is that patience is an
[10:45] essential attribute of God it is
[10:47] something that is intrinsic in him it's
[10:49] part of his very nature God is patience
[10:51] and as a result it's a necessary
[10:53] attribute as a child of God
[10:55] so their patience is essential to the
[10:58] nature of God and as his children it's
[11:00] essential to our nature as a Believer by
[11:03] birth patience is in US
[11:05] and then what I want to wrap up with
[11:06] today so I'm just kind of giving you
[11:07] this outline so you can kind of look at
[11:09] this outline to know where we're at in
[11:11] terms of whether or not we're close to a
[11:12] close
[11:13] uh and then the last part I want to come
[11:14] back to the death of patience and it's
[11:16] the death of patients that has resulted
[11:18] in wonderlust and wonder loss
[11:22] and if I could just say this at the
[11:24] outset before we go on to the next
[11:25] patients leads to Rewards I want to
[11:29] generalize the age that we're living in
[11:31] and maybe generalizing some of our
[11:32] experiences I would say that if you're
[11:34] not finding this experience God bless
[11:36] you it's wonderful but I believe that we
[11:38] can be characterized in this age as
[11:40] becoming increasingly impatient
[11:43] and whether it be this restlessness to
[11:46] experience the thrill uh this uh you
[11:49] know just one particular emotion it's
[11:51] got to be changed it's got to be some
[11:52] sort of pattern interrupt there's got to
[11:53] be something uh to where we want to
[11:55] experience a new emotion a new
[11:56] experience we want to do something else
[11:58] do something different and we're
[12:00] constantly needing something
[12:02] uh to kind of keep us engaged and we
[12:04] just easily become impatient it's kind
[12:06] of just the nature of the world we're
[12:08] living in where everything needs to be
[12:09] quick and needs to be ready right away
[12:10] and we want to experience things with
[12:12] the on an increased timeline I think
[12:14] that ties into wonderlust this
[12:16] impatience I just want to meander I just
[12:18] want to go I feel restless and to be
[12:20] impatient it means to be restless under
[12:22] existing conditions
[12:24] so considering existing conditions or
[12:27] where we're at now is someone someone is
[12:29] impatient and this is kind of giving the
[12:30] definition of Patience by inversion
[12:32] someone who cannot bear or endure their
[12:36] current state
[12:38] so when things are a certain way they
[12:39] just can't bear it they just can't stand
[12:41] it and it's just impatience they want to
[12:42] change things they want they don't want
[12:44] it to be the way that it is and so
[12:45] that's what is thought of in patience
[12:47] and that I see in the death of patients
[12:49] it results in the resurrection of
[12:51] impatience
[12:52] so now in patience leads to rewards now
[12:55] we're going to develop this part for a
[12:57] little bit here we've already covered a
[13:00] lot uh in terms of rewards so what I
[13:02] would say is as we look at the same
[13:05] scriptures look for a deeper connection
[13:07] instead of just saying this is review
[13:09] sometimes I do and maybe some of you may
[13:11] be kind of used to me going over review
[13:13] and tying things in so you might be like
[13:15] I got that I got that you're just kind
[13:16] of waiting for me don't do that look for
[13:19] a deeper connection and and for deeper
[13:21] understanding of these scriptures
[13:22] because I'm not just going over them to
[13:24] review them I'm going over them now
[13:26] because we've already gone into it I
[13:29] want to go deeper and if it's not deeper
[13:31] I just want to turn the side over and
[13:32] say now look at this side of it and so
[13:34] rewards are earned through patience and
[13:36] so there's a patience that leads to
[13:38] rewards it's through patients that we
[13:39] earn rewards and this being patient now
[13:42] this is where we're starting to get into
[13:43] the definition of patience and being
[13:45] patient is the process as as we are
[13:48] patient it builds in it inspiration and
[13:52] as patient leads to rewards it's this
[13:54] process of motivating us to the reward
[13:56] and so God has a way that patience is so
[13:59] critical to motivating us to rewards and
[14:02] so really I'm asking that you
[14:04] concentrate with me this morning it's a
[14:06] very very uh um you know concentrate and
[14:09] I'll say that brother Lupe I kept
[14:11] thinking about your amens as I was
[14:12] studying I was like I'm gonna need I'm
[14:14] looking forward to his amens I'm looking
[14:15] for a hit to him dragging me through
[14:18] this material tomorrow I was just
[14:19] thinking about that so it's nice just to
[14:21] sit right next to you there and so I'll
[14:23] say this draw on what you know God is
[14:26] already these are things you understand
[14:28] as a Believer we've been covering these
[14:30] through 10 Services 11 Services now this
[14:32] very similar subject you already know
[14:34] these things so start drawing on that
[14:36] for to bring you deeper into an
[14:38] understanding of Christ
[14:39] Hebrews chapter 6 verses 10 to 12 and
[14:42] hopefully I can just go through about a
[14:44] half a dozen scriptures or so or maybe a
[14:46] dozen real quick
[14:48] on this it says for God is Not
[14:50] unrighteous to forget your work and
[14:52] labor of love we've Amplified that so
[14:54] God is mindful of your work and labor of
[14:56] love which you have showed towards his
[14:58] name and that you have ministered to the
[15:00] Saints and do Minister and we desire
[15:03] that every one of you do show the same
[15:05] diligence to the full Assurance of Hope
[15:07] unto the end so God knows your labor he
[15:09] won't forget it so everyone ought to
[15:11] show the same diligence diligently stay
[15:14] laboring and working and be perseverant
[15:17] because to the full assurance that you
[15:19] might receive the hope that is at the
[15:21] end so he says that you be not slothful
[15:24] but followers of them who through faith
[15:26] and patience inherit the promises so
[15:29] this has been a theme through all the
[15:31] sermons on rewards and a theme about
[15:33] earning rewards is through faith and
[15:36] patience you might inherit what God has
[15:38] promised as a reward to those who work
[15:40] in labor of love
[15:42] and what Paul is doing here as he says
[15:45] this and shares this with them he's
[15:47] promoting the virtue of endurance
[15:49] and this is a particular word here for
[15:52] that's translated to patience and it's
[15:54] combining the the Macross which is long
[15:57] uh when it speaks of of a place it's
[16:00] something that's remote or far off if it
[16:02] speaks of time it's something that's
[16:03] Long and Lasting and then it's thumas
[16:06] which is Passion or wrath so it puts
[16:08] passion or wrath off it's something that
[16:10] puts uh emotions at Bay so this patience
[16:13] is long uh of enduring and long with
[16:17] passion and along with anger like you
[16:19] put off uh things that might move you or
[16:21] cause you to be unsettled it says that
[16:23] through patience through faith and
[16:25] patience you might inherit the promises
[16:27] this use of this word patience speaks of
[16:29] one who's able to regulate their
[16:31] emotions so that you're not quick to
[16:33] satisfy some urge or some desire to do
[16:35] something through faith and patience
[16:38] there's some restraint there there's
[16:39] some either the Motions there's a
[16:41] certain emotion that you want to last
[16:43] and to endure a desire a diligence that
[16:46] is long lasting the perseverance that is
[16:48] long lasting and then the this not being
[16:50] quick to satisfy other urges it's really
[16:52] a beautiful word picture that's painted
[16:54] the way that it's used in Scripture
[16:56] but recognize how that Paul and I'll
[16:59] call it this the marriage of faith and
[17:01] patience there's a union of these two
[17:03] principles
[17:04] and it's a necessary Union in order for
[17:06] Faith to be expressed and for our faith
[17:08] to be rewarded you have faith but
[17:10] without the patience
[17:11] faith cannot be expressed you have faith
[17:13] but without patience your faith will
[17:16] wither your faith will wither under
[17:18] Triumph so Revelations chapter 13 verse
[17:21] 10 it says he that leadeth into
[17:22] captivity shall go into captivity he
[17:24] that kills with the sword must be killed
[17:26] with the sword and everybody goes that
[17:28] escalated quickly and so as it is
[17:31] speaking of the judgments that will come
[17:33] upon those that lead into captivity they
[17:35] will be led into captivity he that
[17:37] killed the sword will be killed by the
[17:38] sword it says this here is the patience
[17:41] and the faith of the Saints so the faith
[17:44] of the Saints says that God is a
[17:45] rewarder that God will judge and as the
[17:47] enemy has done unto me that my faith
[17:49] tells me that God is a God that rewards
[17:51] and God will judge the enemies by the
[17:53] measure that they met out but it's not
[17:55] just the faith of the Saints but it's
[17:56] also the patience of the Saints Faith
[18:00] would be the ability and the capacity to
[18:02] believe something and to believe that
[18:04] it's true patience would then be the
[18:06] ability or the capacity The Virtue to
[18:09] endure unto it
[18:10] you believe something and that's great
[18:12] but patience is what's going to lead you
[18:14] Faith then is what's going to hold you
[18:17] and keep that Faith kind of as a
[18:19] marriage it's a union faith and patience
[18:20] working together so that you can see
[18:22] what your faith believed in
[18:24] and so these two are working together
[18:26] brother Abraham says in the Statue of a
[18:28] perfect man you could go back and look
[18:29] at how he uses this that if you have
[18:31] real genuine Faith you have real genuine
[18:33] patience
[18:34] if you have real genuine Faith then you
[18:35] have real genuine patience because they
[18:37] work together something that they are
[18:39] combined
[18:40] so in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 36
[18:43] this is looking again at this how
[18:45] patience leads to rewards as it said
[18:48] that their God is a not he will not
[18:50] forget your work in labor of love so
[18:51] show diligence unto the end to receive
[18:53] your reward and that look to those as
[18:55] examples who through faith and patience
[18:58] have received their reward and faith in
[19:00] patience now married together we see in
[19:02] here in verse chapter 10 verse 36 for
[19:04] you have needed patience that after you
[19:06] have done the will of God which would be
[19:08] Faith after you've done the will of God
[19:10] you might receive the promise
[19:12] and this is another another term for
[19:16] patients that is used it's the same
[19:18] patient's Greek word in Revelations 13.
[19:20] but this is something that is used
[19:22] that's translated to endure to preserve
[19:24] it speaks to something sustaining
[19:26] something that um is it speaks to to
[19:29] preserve and also to persevere that's
[19:31] the thought behind it and this is you
[19:34] have need of patience that after you've
[19:35] done the will of God doing the will of
[19:37] God is faithfulness doing the will of
[19:39] God is being faithful that you might
[19:40] receive the promise so notice you need
[19:42] patience
[19:44] that so if you look at this as you do
[19:46] the will of God and as you believe you
[19:47] need patience so that you can receive
[19:50] the promise brother Brandon says
[19:52] specifically now faithfulness and
[19:53] patience go together
[19:56] faithfulness and patience go together
[19:57] and now when the Bible speaks of this
[19:59] character of patience here and one way
[20:02] there's a Greek word that's translated
[20:03] to patients and it speaks of having
[20:05] something that endures and lasts but
[20:07] then also to where you're slow to wrath
[20:09] you're slow to the negative things
[20:10] you're you're long on the positive
[20:12] things maybe one way to speak of it but
[20:14] then it speaks this patient speaks of
[20:16] one who's not easily deterred speaks of
[20:18] one who doesn't swerve from his
[20:21] deliberate purpose and his loyalty to
[20:22] Faith despite the circumstances so if
[20:25] someone has patience they stay the
[20:27] course regardless of the opposition
[20:29] speaks of one who's not easily swerved
[20:32] from what their purpose and their
[20:33] loyalty is that's what patience then is
[20:36] this continuing of faith not being
[20:39] swerved from my faith not being tossed
[20:41] to and throw and that to and fro and
[20:43] that was kind of the thought behind
[20:44] wonderlust this that you have need of
[20:45] patience so you can remain deliberate
[20:49] that you could be preserved and
[20:51] persevere
[20:52] now in Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to 3
[20:54] wherefore seeing you are also compassed
[20:56] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[20:58] which Paul can say be followers of them
[20:59] that through faith and patience have
[21:01] inherited the promises he says with with
[21:03] this cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[21:04] every weight and the sin which doth so
[21:07] easily beset us and that would go back
[21:09] to chapter 10 you have need of patience
[21:12] because you have things that try to
[21:13] beset you and you have things that try
[21:14] to hinder you and let us run with
[21:17] patience the race that is set before us
[21:18] Paul does not say just run and he says
[21:21] run that you might obtain and in order
[21:22] to obtain you must run patiently this is
[21:25] an important characteristic and there's
[21:27] so many different scriptures the the
[21:29] real gift was being actually this past
[21:31] week was just finding the right ones
[21:33] that could be anointed and quickened
[21:35] because there's dozens and dozens and
[21:36] dozens of scriptures on long-suffering
[21:38] and patience and enduring that all come
[21:40] from the same root it's run with
[21:42] patience the race that is set before us
[21:44] having this example looking unto Jesus
[21:46] the author and finish of our faith who
[21:49] for the joy that was set before him
[21:51] endured now that word endured there is
[21:53] the same word that's translated to run
[21:55] this race with patience
[21:57] it's the same word and you have need of
[21:59] patience now if this is important
[22:00] principle here I think maybe my my
[22:02] energy and my enthusiasm is causing me
[22:04] maybe just to uh uh to go to go quick
[22:09] uh it's I've I believe that God can
[22:12] impress upon us a better understanding
[22:14] of patience today
[22:16] and and enduring because it's the same
[22:18] word you have need of patience and it
[22:21] says he endured the cross and I know
[22:23] what we immediately begin to think when
[22:24] he endured the cross is we think in
[22:26] terms of the blood and the Affliction
[22:28] and the weight and all the nationalists
[22:30] and all the physical suffering and I
[22:33] think that we need to have a much
[22:34] broader more daily view of what it means
[22:37] to suffer as we've touched on before and
[22:38] what it means to be patient
[22:40] he says he who for the joy which set
[22:43] before him was patient
[22:45] endured the cross
[22:47] despising the shame for the joy set
[22:48] before and speaks of the reward what was
[22:50] to come despising the shame and is set
[22:53] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[22:54] God for consider him that endured same
[22:57] word for patience
[22:59] such contradiction of Sinners against
[23:01] himself lest ye be wearied and faint in
[23:04] your minds which would speak against to
[23:06] the endurance the faithfulness that you
[23:08] would not give up that you would not
[23:09] lose hope that you would not uh stop
[23:12] pressing that you would not as he said
[23:14] in chapter six show the same diligence
[23:16] to the full Assurance of the Hope in the
[23:18] end be like those who through faith and
[23:20] patience inherited the promises go
[23:22] through says you have need of patience
[23:24] that you might receive the promise goes
[23:25] through the Hall of Fame by Faith by
[23:27] Faith by Faith by faith and then says
[23:29] that we ought to run this race with
[23:31] patients thinking of the ultimate
[23:33] example Jesus Christ who used patience
[23:36] to be to in order to carry the cross
[23:38] which is his burden and to sit down at
[23:40] the right hand of God so he says look at
[23:42] this example of patience lest ye lose
[23:45] your patience
[23:47] look at this example of patience unless
[23:49] you be wearied in faint in your minds
[23:50] and so that being weary and fit in your
[23:52] minds would be your your patience giving
[23:54] out
[23:55] so Paul is creating motivation
[23:58] and this might be maybe a unique unique
[24:00] way to say it and I don't know hopefully
[24:02] that this will make more senses to go
[24:04] forward he's created Motivation by
[24:06] establishing expectations
[24:08] full Assurance of the Hope under the end
[24:10] inheriting the promises uh that you
[24:13] might receive the promise and looking
[24:15] unto Jesus who for the joy was set
[24:17] before him he's trying to establish some
[24:19] expectation not immediate expectation
[24:22] but this expectation that for now you
[24:25] need to endure for now you need to be
[24:27] patient for now you need to be long on
[24:29] uh on waiting now you need to be long on
[24:32] perseverance you need to be long on
[24:33] diligence you need to be long On
[24:35] Believing you need to be long on faith
[24:36] and that needs to be your long position
[24:39] for all the day Traders
[24:41] then in Romans Chapter 2 verses 6 to 7
[24:43] and I got to go quickly through these
[24:45] different ones on patience leads to
[24:47] rewards speaking of the nature of God
[24:49] who will render to every man according
[24:51] to his deeds this is what God's going to
[24:52] do to them who by patient continuance
[24:56] enduring
[24:58] patient continuance in well-doing seek
[25:00] for Glory and Honor immortality
[25:02] eternal life so it's going to reward
[25:04] them in eternal life going to reward
[25:06] them with life abundantly to them who by
[25:08] patience in doing well
[25:10] seek for Glory and Honor immortality
[25:13] now it's telling us it's okay to seek
[25:16] for this
[25:17] right now I know that it's certainly
[25:19] qualified within the context of
[25:20] scripture but by patient continuance
[25:22] it's not just seeking Glory not just
[25:25] seeking honor and immortality you can
[25:27] only do it by patient continuance Paul
[25:29] is attaching the receipt receiving of
[25:33] God's reward to the character of
[25:36] patience
[25:37] that when you believe that there's this
[25:39] patience that's going to draw you and
[25:41] lead you to your ultimate reward
[25:44] in James chapter 1 verses 2 3 and 4 it
[25:47] says my brethren counted all joy when
[25:49] you fall into diverse Temptations
[25:51] knowing this
[25:53] that the trying of your faith worketh
[25:55] patience
[26:00] but let patients have her perfect work
[26:03] that you may be perfect an entire
[26:04] wanting nothing
[26:08] now I want to see where we're at in this
[26:10] I had some things
[26:11] that okay we'll be coming to it here in
[26:13] a moment so I just we'll be able to move
[26:15] a little bit quicker here the trying of
[26:17] your faith so you have faith remember
[26:19] the marriage and the union of of faith
[26:21] and patience it's the trying of your
[26:24] faith that works patience that gives
[26:27] patients an opportunity
[26:28] if this if you think the trying of your
[26:31] faith gives patience a job to do
[26:34] right trying of your faith excites
[26:37] patience the trend of your faith means
[26:38] it's your turn patience I believe I
[26:41] believe I believe opposition opposition
[26:44] faces it's my turn patience says it's my
[26:46] turn let me step in let me step in now
[26:49] as a companion uh to Faith if you've got
[26:52] real genuine Faith you've got real
[26:53] genuine patience so faith cannot be
[26:55] Faith unless it has something up against
[26:57] it
[26:58] and so with that up against it I don't
[27:00] have to have faith that there's mud out
[27:01] there right
[27:03] the condition of my children's shoes
[27:05] tells me that there's mud out there but
[27:08] it's faith in order for it to be faith
[27:09] it has something against it so in the
[27:11] face of something against it if you have
[27:13] real genuine Faith you have real genuine
[27:14] patients that kind of steps up behind
[27:16] that faith it says don't worry I got
[27:18] your back
[27:20] and I'm going to hold you up I'm going
[27:22] to Bear you on and I'm going to keep you
[27:23] from swerving and I'm gonna I'm gonna
[27:25] make this Faith last
[27:27] I'm long on this I I'm going to make
[27:30] this Faith last and so then it says but
[27:33] let patience have her perfect work
[27:36] so now if the trying of your faith Works
[27:39] patience we might think oh I'm trying
[27:40] I'm trying oh I'm impatient be impatient
[27:42] don't get impatient
[27:44] patience has a perfect and complete work
[27:46] let patients have her perfect work in
[27:49] other words the trying of your faith
[27:50] gives patients a job let her finish your
[27:52] job
[27:53] let it finish that you may be perfect an
[27:56] entire wanting nothing what a beautiful
[27:57] couple
[27:58] faith and patience working together to
[28:01] see that we are made complete perfect
[28:03] and entire lacking in nothing
[28:06] what a com what a connection to the full
[28:08] Assurance of Hope unto the end and a
[28:10] full reward and receiving the promises
[28:12] that you might find yourself perfect and
[28:15] entire wanting nothing
[28:17] says there's absolutely no other way in
[28:19] which to gain patience it has to come by
[28:21] the trial of our faith
[28:25] there's no other way for it to announce
[28:27] itself there's no other way to have it
[28:28] there's no other way for it to be
[28:30] utilized except that our faith be tested
[28:34] and tried
[28:35] use this statement already this is where
[28:37] we're I think you could see the
[28:39] connection so easily with rewards from
[28:41] the church age book chapter six brother
[28:43] Brown says God's will for us is
[28:44] perfection
[28:46] and that Perfection is patience
[28:51] waiting on God and waiting for God
[28:54] this is the process of character
[28:57] development you have faith you're born
[29:00] again still with the Holy Ghost same
[29:02] thing you have it you're a Son of God
[29:04] you're in the family and now you with
[29:06] that Faith there's the patience God's
[29:10] will for us is perfection and you have
[29:11] to have patience and patience is the
[29:14] process of character development
[29:16] now this is what brother Brandon's
[29:18] amplifying when he makes that statement
[29:19] and this is applies to us God's will
[29:21] first says Perfection waiting on God
[29:22] Waiting for God this is the process of
[29:24] character development how highly God has
[29:26] commended these Saints of the Dark Ages
[29:27] the theatorian church age how he
[29:29] commends them I think maybe we'll get
[29:31] into it uh in a later service patience
[29:33] is Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly
[29:35] Faithfully they serve God that is all
[29:37] they wanted out of life just service to
[29:39] their lord how great was to be their
[29:42] reward
[29:43] this is in the context again of faith
[29:45] and patience working together to the
[29:47] fullness
[29:48] and so patience is Central to our
[29:51] Perfection faith is Central uh faith is
[29:55] Central to Faith in patients working
[29:57] together uh forming this Union and this
[30:00] Alliance uh one supporting the other
[30:03] and we see that patience is perfection
[30:06] is patience and that's the process of
[30:09] character development
[30:11] now with all these many scriptures and I
[30:13] can use dozens more and you those of you
[30:15] have already flipped your concordance to
[30:16] check off all the ones I'm using no so
[30:18] many more scriptures that we could use
[30:21] and if patience and maybe maybe it's
[30:24] just not as much color to it as I would
[30:26] have wanted maybe I wanted to go deeper
[30:27] in this but I have to press on if
[30:30] patience is this critical to character
[30:32] development brother bam says Perfection
[30:34] is patient so this
[30:37] you know the mark of this age is
[30:38] perfection you think of the weight be
[30:39] therefore perfect as your heavenly
[30:41] father is perfect so patience is
[30:42] critical to this process of character
[30:44] development if patience is critical to
[30:46] perfect Faith then what what would be
[30:49] the hindrance
[30:51] like what would hinder that process of
[30:54] character development or maybe another
[30:55] way of putting it is if if the devil
[30:58] just by reading the quotes realizes that
[31:01] patience is necessary that faith is the
[31:04] gift of God and and that's more precious
[31:07] than gold and then he finds out that the
[31:09] trial of your faith is more precious
[31:11] than gold and so the devil feels like
[31:13] well man I can't win because the faith
[31:15] is they've already got faith that's the
[31:16] gift of God and then if I try their
[31:18] faith and and try to hinder their faith
[31:20] that's even more precious than gold and
[31:22] he's thinking so beware can I devalue
[31:25] their gold and he realizes ah patience
[31:28] if I could get if I could throw a monkey
[31:30] wrench into their plans it's going to be
[31:32] through this Avenue and this channel of
[31:34] being impatient or that's the way to
[31:37] interrupt the process on put it in the
[31:40] mind of a conspiring devil who's making
[31:42] due use of every opportunity walketh
[31:44] about seeking whom he may devour now if
[31:47] patience is that important think about
[31:49] what the devil would want to attack
[31:51] and now consider this and this is where
[31:53] it's very very practical as I believe
[31:55] Wednesday night was ultimately and as we
[31:57] probably will be through the remainder
[31:59] of this particular series consider how
[32:02] Modern Life
[32:03] thought about all the different ways I
[32:05] want to say Society the world whatever
[32:07] how Modern Life by Design is
[32:10] manipulating our Humanity
[32:12] by Design
[32:14] uh and and you should you should think
[32:16] in terms of economics when you think of
[32:18] the design of anything
[32:20] why are um uh Coke bottles round and
[32:25] milk carton square right
[32:28] someone's going
[32:30] I prayed about that yesterday
[32:33] and we're asking the real questions
[32:34] somebody's like I I was hoping he would
[32:37] get into this and the reason nice it's
[32:39] cheaper dry room temperature shelf
[32:42] storage is cheaper than refrigerator
[32:44] storage do you want to be able to fit
[32:46] more is this is this practical today or
[32:47] what
[32:48] right those of you been wanting to work
[32:50] at Fry's you're gonna have a leg up on
[32:52] the competition and so you want you want
[32:55] to maximize your space in the
[32:57] refrigerated compartments because of
[32:58] Economics because the cost
[32:59] why is there a light in the refrigerator
[33:01] not one in the freezer
[33:03] right
[33:04] asking the real questions
[33:07] it's economics it's money
[33:09] and so since money is a driving Factor
[33:11] economies economics is the driving
[33:13] factors fellowshipping on Wednesday
[33:15] night that if you're getting something
[33:16] for free then you're you're the
[33:18] commodity
[33:19] right you're you're the one you're the
[33:22] one that's being used in that process
[33:24] and so there's that we want to consider
[33:26] how life by its own design is
[33:28] manipulating our humanity and in doing
[33:30] so it's perverting our patients
[33:33] it's all for economies now I have to
[33:35] just want to refer to this very very
[33:36] quickly
[33:38] and this is not me just taking Liberty
[33:41] uh and kind of shoehorning this in to
[33:44] fit my narrative the original sin was
[33:46] the result of impatience
[33:48] there's a lot of things that are working
[33:49] but there's this idea that Eve is
[33:52] perfect everything's right Perfection
[33:54] Beyond Perfection it's Sublime and the
[33:56] Satan used this draw on her emotions
[34:00] and to cause her to try to act on
[34:03] something for an immediate gain
[34:05] as opposed to waiting on God in his
[34:07] promise brother man said Adam's bride
[34:09] could not wait
[34:10] so Satan's gospel enticed her into
[34:13] impatience she ought to have had faith
[34:16] and patience she ought to been long on
[34:18] the promise that it's an oncoming
[34:19] promise an oncoming thing as brothers
[34:20] said and brother bam says God promised
[34:23] to multiply them but they had to wait
[34:25] until God's time
[34:27] notice that seed of wonderlust
[34:30] took her out of that position of safety
[34:33] and caused her to be pulled into
[34:36] this through impatience drawn into an
[34:39] activity into something that was not a
[34:41] faith
[34:42] so there's if patience is this critical
[34:45] think about how things are designed to
[34:48] warp the quality and character of
[34:50] patients let patients have a perfect
[34:52] work right
[34:53] and if patients if you could get out of
[34:55] the way patients and let her do her
[34:57] thing right you're going to be perfect
[34:58] in the entire wanting nothing
[35:00] so then the whole goal is now if we
[35:03] could just get patients to work in
[35:05] perfectly you could just muddy the
[35:06] waters about patience then that keeps us
[35:09] from the Perfection I think this makes
[35:11] sense
[35:12] at least it does from my vantage point
[35:13] how do those those in the balcony
[35:16] excellent they're getting it there
[35:19] now
[35:20] this role of patients even the
[35:22] definition of patients as the bible
[35:24] translated to continual and enduring and
[35:26] suffering all those different terms that
[35:28] are kind of used as a companion to it
[35:29] the role of patients in Perfection I
[35:32] believe is to easily misunderstood and I
[35:34] won't accuse you of misunderstanding
[35:36] I'll just say it's easy to misunderstand
[35:37] in case you do
[35:39] and I want to be very blunt about this
[35:41] and this is drawing from another a
[35:43] parallel study that I'm doing right now
[35:44] on revisiting the history of the church
[35:46] and the history of Catholicism and
[35:48] reading in great detail through each of
[35:50] the centuries different things that have
[35:52] happened and
[35:54] we do not want to use Catholic theology
[35:59] and the shadows of that that exist in
[36:01] modern Christianity whether it be
[36:03] Protestant or message
[36:05] we do not want to use that to understand
[36:07] patience and endurance and suffering
[36:10] because the Catholic Church would want
[36:12] you to think that suffering is giving
[36:14] all your money to the Catholic church
[36:15] and suffering is you being burned at the
[36:17] stake because you're a heretic and all
[36:20] the atrocities that the Catholic Church
[36:22] imposed upon the Believers upon
[36:24] Christians where poverty was a mark of
[36:26] Christianity and being austere and not
[36:28] having things and and they wanted to use
[36:30] this principle of suffering so that the
[36:32] believer gave everything away and let
[36:35] the priest Live lavishly and Let the
[36:36] church accumulate the wealth and it was
[36:38] all political and they were all
[36:39] Hypocrites and they did not live
[36:42] according to things that they were
[36:43] wanting to impose upon the people and so
[36:45] if I could say this there's almost this
[36:47] fat this DNA within Christianity to turn
[36:50] ourselves into Catholics to where we
[36:52] deserve a Purgatory we deserve to be
[36:54] dark to punish ourselves we that we need
[36:57] to have this suffering and patience is
[36:58] is poverty and patience is physical
[37:01] suffering impatience is crawling on our
[37:03] knees up hundreds of steps in order to
[37:06] be absolved of our sins and we want to
[37:08] think about what patient means in a more
[37:09] practical way way
[37:11] and if you misunderstand patients
[37:15] and you think it means means to suffer
[37:18] then no wonder so many men just threw
[37:21] themselves on a bed of nettles and into
[37:23] thorns and just caused themselves to
[37:25] experience physical pain because they
[37:26] thought this is what brings perfection
[37:29] and that's not it
[37:31] patience leads to rewards now patience
[37:33] is an intrinsic character of God
[37:37] it is something we could say God is
[37:40] patience I think I have a prompt there
[37:41] on the slides patience is an essential
[37:43] characteristic of God it is an attribute
[37:46] of God and an essential attribute for
[37:49] the believer something that The Believer
[37:51] by birth
[37:52] if you're born again today patience is
[37:54] in you
[37:55] right that that we could just say it's a
[37:58] virtue that is in that Soul it is a part
[38:00] of that it's one of the fruits of the
[38:01] spirit
[38:02] and so now what we want is that to be
[38:04] placed right we want it to come to the
[38:07] Forefront we wanted to work out in the
[38:09] manifestation of the Statue of a perfect
[38:10] man and so patience is essential to the
[38:14] nature of God it is part of his inherent
[38:15] nature and the Bible says in second
[38:17] Peter chapter 3 verse 9 the Lord is not
[38:19] slack concerning his promise as some
[38:22] meant count slackness but his
[38:23] long-suffering this is that that where
[38:25] they get long suffering it's almost a
[38:27] direct translation of long and suffering
[38:31] uh to us word not willing that they
[38:33] should should perish but that all should
[38:35] come to repentance there's a number of
[38:37] scriptures I wanted to use but God is
[38:39] patient
[38:40] this is what God is God is patient I
[38:42] mean he says he's not slack his patience
[38:45] is not the result of him being dull
[38:47] his patience is not the result of him
[38:49] being inactive he says God is Not slack
[38:52] how men count slackness in other words
[38:54] God's not slow to appreciate what is
[38:55] happening and that's why he doesn't act
[38:58] right some of us are just dull I was
[39:00] like man he has so much patience he just
[39:02] waited to the very end to grab that he
[39:04] just waited the last minute to do
[39:06] something you notice how he held on to
[39:08] that investment to the last minute and
[39:10] finally sold it's like I couldn't
[39:11] remember my password
[39:12] right there's things people give you
[39:14] credit for being patient or someone just
[39:16] slack and you're lazy and you're lazy
[39:18] and you're lazy you don't do it that's
[39:19] not patience don't confuse laziness for
[39:21] patience I said that's not how God is
[39:23] God can fully appreciate the situation
[39:25] and he's not quick to judge it he's not
[39:27] quick to intervene he's not quick to do
[39:29] something but God knows what is
[39:31] happening so I want to say this his
[39:33] wisdom is manifested in his waiting his
[39:36] wisdom is manifested in him being a
[39:37] little bit hands off his wisdom is
[39:39] manifested in his patience so God is
[39:41] patient and it's through his patience
[39:43] that his wisdom is made manifest
[39:45] God says this in Exodus 34 6 of himself
[39:48] and the Lord passed by before him verse
[39:50] 5 is a doozy you should read that one
[39:51] and the Lord passed by before him and
[39:54] proclaimed the Lord the Lord God
[39:55] merciful and gracious I don't even know
[39:58] what doozy means really but what I mean
[40:00] is it's awesome it's Wonderful Merciful
[40:02] and gracious long-suffering and abundant
[40:04] in goodness and Truth this is what he
[40:06] says himself the Lord the Lord God
[40:08] merciful and gracious long-suffering and
[40:10] abundant and goodness and Truth merciful
[40:12] and gracious abundant goodness and truth
[40:14] and the meat is long-suffering
[40:16] where would his mercy and graciousness
[40:18] and his abundance and goodness and Truth
[40:20] be unless it could last
[40:22] unless it was long-lasting
[40:24] long-suffering
[40:26] Peter even says it this way in second
[40:28] Peter 3 5 he's just jumping 3 15.
[40:31] after he said that God is long-suffering
[40:33] towards us and not slack he says an
[40:35] account that the long suffering of Our
[40:37] Lord is salvation
[40:39] his patience is what gives us the
[40:41] opportunity
[40:42] that that had God not been patient
[40:45] patient there's no salvation
[40:48] so it it says in such a way that you
[40:50] would almost say uh a equals b equals c
[40:53] so a equals c but he says in the account
[40:55] of the long suffering of the Lord is
[40:56] salvation it's put in his equals but
[40:59] it's his patience that allows for
[41:01] salvation and makes an opportunity for
[41:02] salvation
[41:04] look at First Corinthians chapter 13 I
[41:06] have Verses 4 and 7 here
[41:08] this is the beginning of the
[41:10] descriptions of Charity charity
[41:12] suffereth long
[41:14] and then in verse 7 endureth all things
[41:17] these the the patience is the beginning
[41:19] of love and the end of love
[41:21] because it says in the next verse
[41:22] charity never faileth it's it's just
[41:25] summarizing all these characteristics of
[41:27] Charity Charities suffereth long that's
[41:29] the one word used of patience that's
[41:30] translated that macrothumas and then it
[41:33] says and endureth all things it uses
[41:35] both words that are used in the New
[41:37] Testament for patience it uses it when
[41:39] describing love
[41:40] and patience then is the bookends of
[41:42] love
[41:43] it's forming the boundaries of Charity's
[41:46] character
[41:48] that whatever other essential attributes
[41:50] it might have that it's kind and Envy's
[41:52] not it vaunteth not itself it's not
[41:53] puffed up it Bears all things believes
[41:55] all things hopes all things and it's
[41:57] only able to Barrel things believe all
[41:58] things and hope all things because it's
[42:00] endurance it's endurance it's faith can
[42:02] allow it to its patients can allow it to
[42:04] Bear it can allow it to believe it can
[42:06] allow it to hope it can allow it to be
[42:08] kind and not be jealous in other words
[42:10] it doesn't run out
[42:13] it's such a beautiful picture about love
[42:16] charity suffereth long charity endureth
[42:18] all things this patience is just God is
[42:21] love God is this charity and notice it's
[42:25] bookings it's clothings it's boundaries
[42:27] to say it is patient
[42:30] and love is patient and it is kind
[42:33] and so patience is essential
[42:35] and I think it was at this in my notes I
[42:38] think I had
[42:39] um several
[42:41] several scriptures I wanted to use just
[42:43] to show the repetition
[42:45] and how that the importance of patience
[42:47] is highlighted by its emphasis
[42:49] and if you're Bible readers which I hope
[42:51] you are it would be hard not to read
[42:53] your Bible this week and not come across
[42:55] this principle of patience
[42:57] it's in so many different places
[43:00] and so I want you to recognize its
[43:02] importance as we're talking about it
[43:03] being an essential to the nature of God
[43:04] and to the Christian notice its emphasis
[43:06] how often it's emphasized in Scripture
[43:10] and how the purpose of suffering in
[43:12] patience is to bring us to Perfection to
[43:14] full maturity and full reward so James
[43:16] deals with it this way in James chapter
[43:17] 5 verses 7 and 8. or actually we'll go I
[43:21] will go to verse I don't maybe hopefully
[43:23] I have the slides or we'll go to verse
[43:25] 11. it says be patient therefore
[43:26] Brethren unto the coming of the Lord so
[43:28] there's your patience behold the
[43:30] husbandman now the principal be patient
[43:33] until that day that we meet him in the
[43:34] air
[43:36] he says this is the principle he uses to
[43:39] encourage this patience behold the
[43:41] husbandman the one that looks after a
[43:43] Vineyard that watches after a garden
[43:44] waited for the precious fruit of the
[43:46] earth and hath long patience for it till
[43:48] he receive the early and latter rain
[43:50] looking at the process of one who
[43:52] cultivates the ground and sows seed and
[43:54] has to wait until the Harvest even after
[43:57] the rains are given in order to receive
[43:59] the precious fruit so be patient until
[44:01] the day that you'll meet the Lord in the
[44:02] air and receive your reward he says just
[44:04] as a husband waits for precious fruit of
[44:06] the Earth have long patience
[44:08] verse 8 be ye also patient establish
[44:11] your hearts that means strengthen and
[44:14] fix your hearts render it constantly and
[44:17] and and have it to be firm and fixed
[44:20] be patient
[44:22] fix your hearts let your heart be fixed
[44:25] and I want you to recognize how it's
[44:27] patience that causes our hearts to be
[44:29] firm and our hearts to be stable be also
[44:32] patient establish your hearts for the
[44:33] coming of Lord drawth nigh Grudge not
[44:35] one against another Brethren lest ye be
[44:36] condemned at that day behold the judge
[44:39] standeth before the door taken I know
[44:42] that we Amplified this together already
[44:43] in Rewards
[44:46] take my brethren the prophets who have
[44:48] spoken in the name of the Lord for an
[44:49] example of suffering Affliction and of
[44:52] patience
[44:54] behold we count them happy which endure
[44:56] that word their endure is also
[44:58] translated to patience and it's used
[45:00] patience in the next phrase you have
[45:02] heard of the patience of Job we count
[45:04] them happy which have patience you have
[45:06] heard of the endurance of job could have
[45:07] easily been translated that way it's the
[45:09] same word and have seen the end of the
[45:11] Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and
[45:13] of tender Mercy
[45:14] so we're wanting to pay close attention
[45:16] to the relationship between patience and
[45:18] suffering
[45:19] and how that patience leads to reward
[45:21] and how this is a characteristic that
[45:23] Paul says we ought to admire in the
[45:24] prophets count them happy which have it
[45:27] you want to be patient just as the
[45:29] husbandman is patient and he works and
[45:30] labors with the field and the toil and
[45:33] this patience which allows him to toil
[45:34] is ultimately rewarded
[45:37] so if I could say this way and maybe
[45:39] this is putting in crude terms patience
[45:41] is a god-given ability to endure to the
[45:44] payoff
[45:47] it's the power to stick to something
[45:49] this is establish Arts fix your hearts
[45:52] on something yeah
[45:53] set it Go and stick to it
[45:55] yeah that you're looking out on Tien
[45:57] brother bam says if we just live for
[45:59] today we'd be miserable but live out to
[46:00] the end look out to the end so there's
[46:01] something that we fixed our hearts on
[46:03] this there's a prize that we stand to
[46:05] obtain we're keeping our eyes on the
[46:07] prize we're not looking down at
[46:08] everything around us and we keep rising
[46:10] and my heart's fixed to that and so
[46:12] patience is the powers to stick to
[46:14] something
[46:15] and to not vary from it
[46:17] notice how Jesus says in Luke chapter 8
[46:19] verse 15 this is where we see the
[46:21] repeated emphasis but that on the good
[46:22] ground the word is the seed the word
[46:25] that fell on good ground he says they on
[46:27] the good ground are they which in an
[46:29] honest and good heart having heard the
[46:31] word keep it
[46:32] and bring forth fruit
[46:35] with patience
[46:36] that's the only way that it can bring
[46:38] forth fruit
[46:39] in other words the word that went into
[46:41] the ground it's not boom
[46:45] right it's not the Sea Falls boom fruit
[46:48] comes up it's like I did it I made it
[46:49] yay right it explains the process of how
[46:52] that first the seed in the on the on the
[46:55] hard ground it came on the Wayside in
[46:57] the hard ground it can't ever go through
[47:00] the process of getting Roots down deep
[47:01] and getting the light and the nurture
[47:02] nutrients something comes and gets it
[47:04] and snatches it or works against it even
[47:06] in the good ground that has other things
[47:07] in it it impedes the process it becomes
[47:10] a hindrance to patients
[47:13] cares of Life interrupt choke out impede
[47:16] the progress of the seed and he's saying
[47:18] they that are in good ground hear the
[47:20] word keep it and with patience bring
[47:23] forth fruit
[47:25] the fruit doesn't come overnight
[47:27] it's a process that takes time that's
[47:28] what James is referring to James Chapter
[47:30] Five have patience just like a
[47:32] husbandman Waits
[47:33] because this is a process second Timothy
[47:36] Chapter 2 verses 9 10 11 and 12
[47:38] wherefore I suffer trouble as an
[47:39] evildoer even under bonds but the word
[47:41] of God is not bound therefore I endure
[47:45] endure there's patience all things for
[47:46] the elect's sake that they may also
[47:49] obtain the Salvation which is in Jesus
[47:50] Christ with
[47:52] eternal glory so Paul has rewards in
[47:53] mind when he speaks of patience it is a
[47:56] faithful saying for if we be dead with
[47:58] him we shall also live with him
[48:01] if we suffer we shall also reign with
[48:05] him
[48:06] and the believer cut themselves
[48:09] and the Believers sold all their
[48:10] possessions and walked to church in in
[48:13] Birkenstocks that they got at the
[48:14] Salvation Army and and get got rid of
[48:18] all their things and took to themselves
[48:20] some Monk or some uh Catholic priest and
[48:23] they're just going to live in in poverty
[48:25] in this suffer and suffer that's what it
[48:27] means if we suffer we'll Reign uh
[48:29] anybody want to guess what that word
[48:30] suffer there is translated to patience
[48:33] all throughout the New Testament
[48:35] it's the same word used of the character
[48:38] of one who does not swerve
[48:41] from their deliberate purpose it's the
[48:43] same word that's used of Charity that it
[48:45] endureth all things it's the same word
[48:46] referring to patients of job it's the
[48:48] same word that's used about Happy with
[48:50] which those that endure it's the same
[48:51] word that's used of Jesus who endured
[48:53] the cross it's the same word users let
[48:55] us run with patience it says here is the
[48:56] patience and the faith of the Saints you
[48:58] have need of patience and faith worketh
[49:00] patience and patience have a perfect
[49:01] work it's the same word if we suffer
[49:04] means if we have patience
[49:07] you know what you guys should be doing
[49:09] speaking in tongues
[49:11] you mean I don't have to bleed I don't
[49:13] have to cry I don't have to be in pain I
[49:15] don't have to be poor amen
[49:20] you should be getting crazy excited
[49:22] about it thinking that suffering doesn't
[49:24] mean I have to break my leg I have to
[49:25] lose an arm I have to go bankrupt I have
[49:27] to lose my family well you may have to
[49:32] but it's certainly not saying that the
[49:35] suffering is merely physical pain
[49:38] broken hearts the loss of blood and the
[49:41] loss of life and the loss of everything
[49:43] we love now God may call you to a
[49:46] suffering like he did job he may call
[49:48] you to death like he did Paul but he
[49:49] does it all with the purpose and as we
[49:51] might have the extremes of suffering and
[49:53] death and suffering but and the extremes
[49:56] of patient being patient we must realize
[49:58] that there must be a more simple
[50:02] daily application of this lest we forget
[50:06] to fully lean into and accept God's
[50:10] process
[50:12] I were waiting around for suffering for
[50:15] our Perfection when he's putting up
[50:16] before us if we're patient we shall also
[50:18] reign with him
[50:20] you know what rain means possess
[50:21] supremely
[50:23] to possess Supreme Liberty honor and
[50:26] blessedness to Reign means possess
[50:30] if we suffer we'll possess if we're
[50:32] patient we'll possess
[50:35] suffering here is simply be impatient
[50:37] waiting on God and waiting for God
[50:41] in other words it's daily opportunities
[50:43] it's something that we can do daily and
[50:46] we don't have to seek for heartache we
[50:48] don't have to work up conflict it comes
[50:50] on its own
[50:52] it'll be here this summer you better
[50:54] believe it
[50:57] better get that airlock in
[50:59] it says if we suffer if we're patient
[51:03] I don't know if you realize every day
[51:05] you have a hundred opportunities at
[51:07] least to be patient
[51:09] why haven't they fixed this why didn't
[51:11] they do that why is it this way what
[51:14] about this what about that you have so
[51:16] many opportunities to belong
[51:18] right to endure to put up with to wait
[51:22] to not be judging daily opportunities
[51:26] and so
[51:27] let me try to turn a little bit of a
[51:29] corner here I've made it a habit to no
[51:31] longer look at the clock I don't know if
[51:32] it's a good habit or a bad habit
[51:35] but
[51:36] what I want you to recognize in this is
[51:38] that God has ordained that things of
[51:40] value come at a price
[51:42] uh that's why any more if I'm shopping
[51:45] for something on Amazon I do two things
[51:46] I rank by price and I look for the most
[51:48] expensive one and then I use those
[51:50] websites that check for fake reviews and
[51:53] now I think we need a website that
[51:54] checks websites that check for fake
[51:56] reviews
[51:57] uh and so you look for something that's
[52:00] expensive because in your mind you're
[52:01] thinking that's where the value is if
[52:04] the market establishes a high price it
[52:06] may be related to Quality it may be
[52:08] related to Value don't just adopt that
[52:11] as a policy that's just me
[52:12] talking Off Script here about my Amazon
[52:14] habits but
[52:16] it's true that it's things of value come
[52:19] at a price
[52:21] part of our human psychology even that
[52:24] they they've tested this on a number of
[52:26] levels that if you have something that
[52:28] you've created just there's a certain
[52:31] way to attach value to it and you assess
[52:33] uh and it creates attachments to it and
[52:36] that's yours and this is how much it's
[52:38] worth or this is yours and keep it for
[52:40] so long this is yours and you can keep
[52:42] it here and they found that people who
[52:44] had possession of something or who
[52:45] people who paid more for it there were
[52:47] certain ways that people assessed and
[52:48] attached a greater worth an effort into
[52:51] certain things but God is saying and as
[52:54] we look at this if we have patience
[52:55] we'll possess
[52:57] God there's things if something has
[53:00] value if something has power then it has
[53:03] to come with the price and maybe I'm
[53:05] just failing to use the right words
[53:06] there and I apologize but if we know
[53:09] that power without character satanic
[53:12] so we understand that principle if you
[53:14] have power without character it's it's
[53:16] unfit to rule it's unfit to possess it's
[53:19] it's on you it's not the right use of
[53:22] opportunity and Power
[53:24] and we find that character cannot come
[53:27] without patience without suffering
[53:29] and so it's that process of suffering in
[53:32] this process of patience that causes us
[53:34] to be fit to rules the process of
[53:36] character development and so since power
[53:38] is so precious
[53:40] and since power is so powerful
[53:43] it says I'm losing my vocabulary but
[53:46] since power is what it is
[53:49] and it has and it carries with it uh the
[53:52] ability to change things and to judge
[53:55] and I just I want you to bring in the
[53:57] whole scope of power and authority
[53:58] because it is what it is God does not
[54:01] allow that to be easily attained to
[54:05] honor without suffering gain without
[54:09] enduring is dangerous
[54:11] this is where I'm moving into a little
[54:14] bit different area now
[54:16] that if you get honor without suffering
[54:19] and you get
[54:21] praise or you get gained you you receive
[54:23] reward without enduring or patience it's
[54:26] dangerous because of our Humanity
[54:28] because we're humans
[54:30] and if I could say this we need patience
[54:33] we need perseverance we need that we
[54:36] need to preserve we need to persevere we
[54:37] need persistence
[54:39] because it's part of God's process for
[54:41] us as his children
[54:43] and it's part and the way that I want to
[54:45] make this relevant if you could turn to
[54:46] Second Corinthians chapter four
[54:48] it's necessary for in order for us to
[54:50] experience his Wonder
[54:52] if we're going to know him
[54:54] in a in a greater measure continually we
[54:57] need patience
[55:00] if you knew that
[55:02] you could just look over a fence and see
[55:04] God anytime you wanted how often would
[55:07] you look over the fence
[55:11] that was just the example that came to
[55:12] my mind
[55:13] but
[55:15] I think that it's When Things become so
[55:17] available to us and so common
[55:20] say oh
[55:21] great you know look what I got look what
[55:22] I got oh you can get those anywhere like
[55:24] really I've only ever seen them at my
[55:25] store one time yeah they're everywhere
[55:27] everywhere
[55:29] and it loses its value when it's
[55:31] everywhere when it's just so easy to see
[55:33] and so easy to experience
[55:35] second Corinthians chapter four this is
[55:37] where our text was and he's talking
[55:38] about the glory of God abounding for
[55:40] which cause the glory of God being
[55:42] abounded and praise being given for
[55:43] which cause we faint not
[55:46] but though our outward man perish yet
[55:49] the n-word man is renewed day by day
[55:55] the outward man would be the human part
[55:57] mind the the body and the spirit
[56:01] but though our in our outward man perish
[56:03] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[56:05] for our light affliction
[56:07] which is but for a moment but for now
[56:09] notice what Paul idea Paul is drilling
[56:12] into it's just so amazing how Paul could
[56:15] be so contextual based upon who he was
[56:17] talking to
[56:18] and there may be some people who hear me
[56:21] preach and they might be like oh that's
[56:23] not for me and and I realize if I felt
[56:25] that way I'd be the most depressed
[56:26] preacher in the world right because
[56:28] we've got room right you'll be like man
[56:30] not everybody's here today why wasn't
[56:32] there six million lining up and down the
[56:34] 101 to get in here today
[56:36] but you realize it's the way that God
[56:38] would deal with the man it's contextual
[56:40] to his audience
[56:41] and that's why sometimes you may stream
[56:43] a preacher like not my cup of tea ain't
[56:44] your cup of tea is right was a serving
[56:47] that to you it's contextual to the
[56:48] audience and Paul is just so amazing to
[56:50] draw on the classics and draw from
[56:53] philosophers and draw from things that
[56:54] would be relevant to the Corinthians and
[56:56] he says our light Affliction is just for
[56:59] now what we're going through now but
[57:01] it's working for us a far more exceeding
[57:04] and eternal weight of Glory so what
[57:06] we're going through now and we may
[57:08] suffer now we're having to be patient
[57:09] now and we're not seeing the benefits
[57:11] and the relief and the full blessing now
[57:13] but we will one day is what he's saying
[57:16] it works a far more exceeding Eternal
[57:17] way to Glory while we look not on the
[57:19] things which are seen which with outward
[57:21] man is so connected to but the things
[57:23] which are not seen which the inward man
[57:24] is drawing from for the things which are
[57:26] seen are temporal which is what the
[57:28] outward man wants but the things which
[57:30] are not seen are Eternal which is what
[57:32] the inward man is searching for looking
[57:33] for
[57:35] so now as we get into the after hour
[57:38] how many are familiar with the concept
[57:40] of delayed gratification
[57:42] very very large and Rich body of study
[57:45] and thought and a proven principle on a
[57:47] number of different layers but that's
[57:48] exactly what Paul's preaching
[57:50] I could show you in so many different
[57:52] areas in scripture walking out after the
[57:53] flesh walk after the spirit that you not
[57:55] fulfill the Deeds of the the scripture
[57:57] is constantly enforcing the principle of
[57:59] delaying gratification
[58:02] and that's what Paul's talking about
[58:03] here
[58:04] what we're suffering now is but for a
[58:07] moment we're delaying gratification
[58:09] because we know that it's working for a
[58:11] much greater reward delayed
[58:12] gratification is the act of resisting
[58:14] and impulse to take an immediately
[58:16] available reward in the hope of
[58:18] obtaining a more value valuable reward
[58:20] in the future
[58:22] catch that delayed gratification is the
[58:25] act of resisting the desire to satisfy
[58:28] to receive an immediately available
[58:30] reward
[58:31] in the hope of getting something greater
[58:34] later on
[58:35] like I'm going to forego a return now
[58:37] being long you may have to bleed out
[58:39] right until my day trading you might
[58:42] have to suffer daily pay but if you but
[58:46] you're hoping for that time there might
[58:47] be some certain things I'm waiting for
[58:49] the payoff I'm waiting for the path I
[58:50] guess it works and being short too but
[58:52] it's the act of holding off
[58:55] hold it I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get
[58:57] I'm not gonna dip now I'm not gonna take
[58:59] it now I'm not gonna do it now I'm gonna
[59:01] resist I'm gonna delay gratification
[59:02] knowing that something greater comes
[59:04] later
[59:05] we used it last Sunday in Hebrews
[59:07] chapter 11 verses 24 to 26 Moses
[59:09] patiently endured by refusing the
[59:12] present Pleasures in light of the future
[59:14] game delayed gratification is what Moses
[59:17] did he says you know what I could give
[59:19] in now and become take advantage of all
[59:21] my opportunities as a son of Pharaoh's
[59:23] daughter that I could get it now and I
[59:26] could gratify myself now according to
[59:28] the outward man but he delayed receiving
[59:30] glory honor and Prestige for the future
[59:33] honor that would come through Christ
[59:35] it was delayed gratification we just
[59:37] read it in Hebrews 12 Christ patiently
[59:39] endured by refusing present Pleasures
[59:41] for future gain
[59:43] he even in the Temptation the Wilderness
[59:45] was offered all the kingdoms without
[59:47] suffering without death and he said I
[59:50] will delay the glory I will delay the
[59:52] honor because the future Glory and Honor
[59:54] will be much more precious if I receive
[59:55] it through suffering you catch on the
[59:57] principle that I've been building to I
[59:59] hope it's starting to make a lot of
[1:00:00] sense they resisted temptation of the
[1:00:03] immediate pleasure
[1:00:04] in the hopes obtaining a future lasting
[1:00:07] more lasting Eternal reward
[1:00:09] and so as we mentioned already patience
[1:00:11] involves the regulation of emotions
[1:00:14] to where we're not quick to indulge in
[1:00:15] the desire for something we're not quick
[1:00:17] to want to get immediate return in other
[1:00:19] words the outward man perishes every day
[1:00:21] why because Paul wasn't simply
[1:00:23] interested in making sure that guy was
[1:00:24] always sensitized
[1:00:26] he's letting it die a little bit
[1:00:28] the flesh was bored he's like you should
[1:00:29] be bored
[1:00:30] he said he beat it he brought it under
[1:00:32] subjection he treated he treated it
[1:00:34] roughly because he didn't want it to
[1:00:36] rule him
[1:00:39] this is a critically important principle
[1:00:42] the ability to delay gratification is
[1:00:45] essential to self-control
[1:00:47] it's essential to perfection
[1:00:49] and so God has created us
[1:00:53] to experience rewards after effort
[1:00:56] God will not reward us unless there's
[1:00:57] been effort God will not pay us unless
[1:01:00] there's been labor he's created this in
[1:01:03] such a way the concept of rewards not
[1:01:04] the gift but God has created the
[1:01:05] experience in his own in his word and
[1:01:08] his promises that he rewards us after
[1:01:09] effort after discipline after striving
[1:01:11] after applying ourselves that's how man
[1:01:14] is let me go quickly Ecclesiastes 3 22.
[1:01:16] wherefore I perceive that there is
[1:01:17] nothing better
[1:01:19] then that a man shall rejoice in his own
[1:01:21] works for that is his portion
[1:01:23] this says in Ecclesiastes 2 4 that he
[1:01:26] should make his soul enjoy good in his
[1:01:27] labor this is God's design for Humanity
[1:01:30] this is the preacher who observed
[1:01:31] everything under the earth and the one
[1:01:33] thing that he could observe that was
[1:01:34] true that there was nothing better than
[1:01:36] that labor precede rewards he didn't say
[1:01:40] there's nothing better than for a man to
[1:01:42] win the lottery it's nothing better for
[1:01:43] a man than to steal the crops from his
[1:01:45] neighbor's plot he said there's nothing
[1:01:47] in that that's vanity
[1:01:49] it's vanity to get fruit without labor
[1:01:51] it's vanity to eat without working it's
[1:01:53] vanity to receive a portion unless
[1:01:54] you've strove for it he's saying that
[1:01:56] God designed for Humanity labor comes
[1:01:59] before Rewards
[1:02:00] said this to Adam when he thrust him
[1:02:02] from the garden from the sweat of thy
[1:02:04] brow you'll eat bread I know there's a
[1:02:06] way that we looked at as a curse upon
[1:02:08] the ground but Adam himself was not
[1:02:10] cursed it was telling Adam that if you
[1:02:12] sweat you'll earn a reward if you work
[1:02:14] and you labor you'll get the fruit you
[1:02:16] need you'll get your daily bread in
[1:02:17] other words he was telling man this is
[1:02:19] how I made you in the beginning I made
[1:02:21] you to till the ground so awaken
[1:02:23] something inside of you that'll satisfy
[1:02:25] you as a man if a man Works he's worthy
[1:02:27] of eating if a man labors he deserves
[1:02:30] the fruit and there's nothing better for
[1:02:32] man to work to strive and then enjoy the
[1:02:34] fruits of that labor it's part of the
[1:02:36] design
[1:02:37] God's in sin of God's reward for the
[1:02:39] believer comes after Labor in the end
[1:02:41] this is the way God's designed it
[1:02:43] and God designed it that way because it
[1:02:45] provides for the necessary development
[1:02:48] of the person and the proper motivation
[1:02:51] to the end
[1:02:52] Ecclesiastes 7 8 better is the end of a
[1:02:55] thing than the beginning thereof and the
[1:02:57] patient in spirit is better than the
[1:02:59] proud in spirit better to be patient
[1:03:01] than arrogant
[1:03:03] better to boast of all the uh temporary
[1:03:06] benefits and Pleasures you have now it
[1:03:09] better not to do that better to be
[1:03:10] patient than to boast
[1:03:12] oh look what I got look at this look at
[1:03:14] that I remember I remember one time
[1:03:15] right when we moved I remember we moved
[1:03:17] to Phoenix years ago and uh and
[1:03:20] everybody was bragging about how much
[1:03:22] their houses were and how little they
[1:03:23] paid for it
[1:03:24] and like we're moving in at a time when
[1:03:26] it's like yeah I bought my house for 200
[1:03:28] 000 it's worth 800 000 now and one
[1:03:30] percent I bought it for 375 it's worth
[1:03:31] 7.50 it's like you should get in on this
[1:03:34] I said
[1:03:35] anymore you think it's going to go to
[1:03:36] 1.5 million hey
[1:03:38] like I think maybe I'm in the wrong time
[1:03:40] and before we left people their houses
[1:03:43] were worth less than what they'd paid
[1:03:44] for it 15 years before
[1:03:46] better be patient
[1:03:48] right
[1:03:49] better to be patient than arrogant at
[1:03:51] saying better is the end of the thing
[1:03:54] than the beginning thereof
[1:03:56] God unfolds this truth in creation the
[1:03:58] principle want you to catch us the pr
[1:03:59] the design of God the principle of
[1:04:01] patience God is the all-powerful
[1:04:03] all-knowing he could do whatever he
[1:04:05] wants and as the as the hippies often uh
[1:04:09] conjectured can God is God's so great
[1:04:11] that he could create a rock so heavy
[1:04:12] that even he can't lift it right and
[1:04:14] they engage in these these weird debates
[1:04:17] but God could have if he wanted to just
[1:04:20] spoke and everything come into being
[1:04:24] he didn't do that
[1:04:26] start small
[1:04:27] God works six days to make creation then
[1:04:31] he rests
[1:04:32] what's the principle that God is looking
[1:04:34] at that the point at which rest is
[1:04:37] appropriate
[1:04:38] that God worked and labored and saw that
[1:04:41] it was good
[1:04:42] that this is God's design this process
[1:04:44] unfolds that he unfolds this truth in
[1:04:46] creation it was a process he unfolds
[1:04:49] this truth still yet in nature the law
[1:04:51] of conception the law of gestation the
[1:04:53] long of late the law of Labor all these
[1:04:55] things things show that things with life
[1:04:57] things with value take time
[1:05:01] and the process is just as important as
[1:05:03] the product
[1:05:05] and that patience is a necessary part of
[1:05:07] perfection
[1:05:09] this is important and if it gets lost
[1:05:11] somehow in the length of this list of
[1:05:13] this and the denseness of it uh I I'm
[1:05:17] I'm happy being able to get it out
[1:05:19] because I think it needs to be said and
[1:05:21] if you're if you're getting a little bit
[1:05:22] weary be patient
[1:05:25] just stick with this
[1:05:27] if that's God's process and and I know
[1:05:30] we're covering a lot of ground and I'm
[1:05:31] making a just a very direct point if
[1:05:34] this is God's process what's the price
[1:05:36] if we bypass it
[1:05:38] if God himself would take six days to
[1:05:41] create creation then take a rest before
[1:05:43] he enjoys it essentially then how much
[1:05:45] is it uh then how important is the
[1:05:48] process
[1:05:49] what if if God wants gain to come after
[1:05:52] Labor if there's nothing better from
[1:05:54] ending to work and work and then enjoy
[1:05:55] the fruits of it if God has ordained
[1:05:57] that the it's bet the end is better than
[1:05:59] the beginning it's better to be patient
[1:06:00] than to be arrogant if all these things
[1:06:02] point to Faith in patients working
[1:06:04] together and that it's that there's
[1:06:06] something to where man has to be
[1:06:07] deliberate and to be pressing what
[1:06:10] happens
[1:06:11] if God's process is otherwise
[1:06:13] manipulated and we try to get the reward
[1:06:15] before the labor
[1:06:16] we try to get the payoff without the
[1:06:18] patients are you with me I'm just
[1:06:21] looking for some eye contact some
[1:06:22] nodding uh you don't offend me if you
[1:06:24] fall asleep it's part of human nature
[1:06:27] it happens and I know that we we uh have
[1:06:32] long hours we got a lot of Demands and
[1:06:34] I'm I'm very empathetic uh when it when
[1:06:36] it comes to to sleeping in church
[1:06:38] because I did it for the first 12 or 13
[1:06:40] years of my life
[1:06:43] now
[1:06:46] it may be 17 or 18 too
[1:06:54] I hope you can just
[1:06:55] uh just ready yourself because this is
[1:06:57] the this is the real thrust now
[1:07:01] if things come too easily
[1:07:03] it short circuits God's plan
[1:07:06] if things come too easily it it
[1:07:09] interrupts God's process because of the
[1:07:10] way that he's made us
[1:07:12] think about how God works in nature
[1:07:14] think about Jesus think about Moses
[1:07:16] think about all these things do I need
[1:07:17] to go back over what I've just preached
[1:07:18] because now this is momentum building
[1:07:20] this is all built hopefully it's just
[1:07:22] accumulated Community including if you
[1:07:24] could get something too easily
[1:07:26] right power apart from character satanic
[1:07:28] if you get power too quickly
[1:07:30] it's not fit doesn't work so in Proverbs
[1:07:33] chapter 20 verse 21 an inheritance may
[1:07:35] be gotten hastily at the beginning but
[1:07:37] the end thereof shall not be blessed
[1:07:40] in other words if it comes too easy
[1:07:41] without hard work it's wasted
[1:07:44] right if you're given something too soon
[1:07:46] then this quick wealth is not blessed in
[1:07:49] the end
[1:07:51] if a father has an inheritance and he
[1:07:53] gives it to you too quickly it's wasted
[1:07:55] just as quick
[1:07:57] an inheritance may be gotten quick
[1:08:00] but if it doesn't follow the process of
[1:08:02] character development if it's not
[1:08:03] following the law of God's adoption
[1:08:06] the end is not blessed
[1:08:08] these are the rules by which men govern
[1:08:10] themselves when it came to raising their
[1:08:11] children it may be theirs but if I give
[1:08:13] it to them too quickly the waste it
[1:08:17] Proverbs chapter 28 verses 20 then 22 a
[1:08:20] faithful man shall abound with blessings
[1:08:21] but he that maketh haste to be rich
[1:08:23] shall not be innocent
[1:08:25] trying to get rich without patience is
[1:08:27] what it's saying but he says he that
[1:08:29] hastes to be rich shall not be uh
[1:08:32] shall not be innocent saying the
[1:08:34] faithful faithful man shall abound with
[1:08:36] blessing the one that wants to do right
[1:08:38] and do it the right way will be blessed
[1:08:39] but he that wants to get rich quick will
[1:08:42] fail
[1:08:44] he hasted verse 22 he hasted to be rich
[1:08:46] hath an evil eye and considereth not
[1:08:48] that poverty shall come upon him he's
[1:08:50] pervert he has a perverted understanding
[1:08:52] not realize if he gets things too easily
[1:08:54] he doesn't know how to hold on to it if
[1:08:57] he gets things too easily he can lose it
[1:08:59] just the same it's such a beautiful
[1:09:00] principle that's presenting the the
[1:09:02] notion and the truth that if things come
[1:09:04] too quickly or too easily then we
[1:09:07] haven't honored God's process and we
[1:09:09] haven't really gained
[1:09:12] it says if we're patient we'll possess
[1:09:14] if you get it too quickly it's just
[1:09:16] temporary
[1:09:18] it's really not in your possession if
[1:09:20] you try to get rich without patience
[1:09:21] without the testing the trial the
[1:09:23] suffering to do it to get rich without
[1:09:24] the testing the trial and the suffering
[1:09:26] is saying is evil
[1:09:28] and leads to the loss of it
[1:09:30] you may get it but you won't hold on to
[1:09:32] it
[1:09:34] so God ordains the pressure
[1:09:36] God ordains the resistance God ordains
[1:09:38] the suffering God ordains the delayed
[1:09:41] gratification for a purpose Romans
[1:09:43] chapter 5 verses 3 to 5 and not only so
[1:09:45] but we glory in Tribulation also knowing
[1:09:47] that tribulation worketh patience and
[1:09:50] patience experience
[1:09:52] you know what experience there is there
[1:09:55] Greek for proven character
[1:10:00] tribulation
[1:10:02] you know what tribulation means
[1:10:04] yeah it means burning I mean it means
[1:10:06] bleeding it means pressure
[1:10:09] stress actually word if you look up
[1:10:11] distress stress tribulation is pressure
[1:10:14] oppression or distress this is God's
[1:10:17] ordained process
[1:10:19] it's even the way he's ordained for a
[1:10:20] baby to come forth
[1:10:21] stress pressure it activates certain
[1:10:24] things in the immune system it's healthy
[1:10:25] for the baby to come that way
[1:10:27] the Natural Way says and tribulation
[1:10:30] Works patience tribulation gives
[1:10:32] patients a job to do
[1:10:33] right and patience
[1:10:37] experience or proven character and
[1:10:39] proven character hope which means for
[1:10:42] good the ACT hope there's the
[1:10:44] expectation of good
[1:10:46] it's the process of character
[1:10:47] development and being rewarded for good
[1:10:49] character summed up in one sentence a
[1:10:52] patience experience experience hope and
[1:10:54] hope make it not a shame the expectation
[1:10:56] of good maketh not a shame because the
[1:10:58] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:11:00] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[1:11:01] in other words we know that he loves us
[1:11:03] and we're not ashamed because his love
[1:11:04] is shed abroad in our hearts we're
[1:11:06] confident in his love so we can engage
[1:11:07] in this process of pressure stress
[1:11:09] tribulation because it's going to give
[1:11:11] patients a job to do and if patience has
[1:11:13] a job her job is what a perfect work and
[1:11:16] so I need pressure I need stress I need
[1:11:18] opposition to be working against me in
[1:11:20] order to give patients a job because if
[1:11:22] she doesn't have a job she can't do a
[1:11:23] perfect work and if she gets she has
[1:11:25] enough stress enough pressure her job
[1:11:27] will be working to make me perfect an
[1:11:29] entire wanting nothing
[1:11:32] so God uses the combination of pressure
[1:11:34] or stress and rewards to motivate our
[1:11:36] behavior and regulate our emotions
[1:11:39] behavioral economics and sociologists
[1:11:42] and psychologists and all the latest uh
[1:11:45] within the realm of psychology
[1:11:48] has not discovered this the Bible's been
[1:11:51] telling us this from the beginning
[1:11:53] that God is using pressure and stress
[1:11:57] and the and the receiving of a reward to
[1:11:59] motivate our behavior and to regulate
[1:12:01] our behavior and our emotions because
[1:12:03] Paul says but if we hope for that which
[1:12:04] we see not if we have the expectation of
[1:12:06] good and if we don't see it then we do
[1:12:08] with patience wait for it
[1:12:10] partaking in the good that you expect
[1:12:13] after you've endured and patiently
[1:12:15] waited for it is glorious
[1:12:17] it's a glorious Delight it is it's
[1:12:19] euphoric it's exciting it's enthusing
[1:12:22] and so
[1:12:24] patience
[1:12:26] I'm running out of time
[1:12:28] I just need to be patient
[1:12:31] I just have to fit I have to finish this
[1:12:33] if I'm still just growing as a pastor in
[1:12:36] the length of these things you uh
[1:12:39] be patient with me as I grow
[1:12:42] patience we we recognize that patience
[1:12:45] is a conscious Act
[1:12:47] that were put into a situation and
[1:12:49] therefore Paul is saying be patient be
[1:12:51] patient be patient and so there's a way
[1:12:53] that we can look at patients that is
[1:12:54] this deliberate conscious Act of the
[1:12:57] individual to endure
[1:12:59] but patience is also part of an
[1:13:01] unconscious brain process
[1:13:04] in the human and I think there's a
[1:13:05] spiritual type here but even in the
[1:13:07] spiritual type it's working off of the
[1:13:08] way God has made us that in the human
[1:13:10] brain
[1:13:11] let me show that slide I think I have a
[1:13:13] slide that just shows the human brain
[1:13:15] they're they're circuits that run
[1:13:17] through it
[1:13:18] and there's actually called the reward
[1:13:20] center of the brain a reward circuitry
[1:13:22] in the brain
[1:13:23] and so there's this circuit that runs to
[1:13:25] the prefrontal cortex there there
[1:13:27] there's and what's being demonstrated
[1:13:29] here is maybe just crude drawing of it
[1:13:31] what I want you to think about is this
[1:13:33] neural network this circuit runs through
[1:13:34] your brain
[1:13:35] and it acts as it monitors the the
[1:13:38] brain's Reward Center
[1:13:40] and it acts like a switch
[1:13:43] now I hope you could stay with me
[1:13:46] please don't let death die on a chair
[1:13:48] today
[1:13:49] that this brain this is the way God is
[1:13:52] everything's built up to this idea of
[1:13:53] patience now and this is the process and
[1:13:56] the the physical way that God has
[1:13:58] designed us there's a switch
[1:14:00] in our brain and this is just an
[1:14:02] overview if the Lord leads maybe we'll
[1:14:03] get into a little bit more details later
[1:14:06] so there's a switch in your brain that's
[1:14:08] monitoring Rewards
[1:14:10] and the way that that switch works and
[1:14:11] I'm just using very crude language to
[1:14:13] try to describe it to you in a way
[1:14:14] that's not technical if you want it
[1:14:16] technical we'll have the doctors brother
[1:14:17] Andrew Brother Scott we'll have the
[1:14:18] doctors explain it to you
[1:14:20] and what this switch does is when
[1:14:22] there's no immediate reward and this is
[1:14:24] the direct link
[1:14:28] switch prompts the brain
[1:14:30] to be patient
[1:14:32] a reward is coming
[1:14:35] there's a part of our brain that wants
[1:14:36] to get something wants to be stimulated
[1:14:38] wants to be excited and when it doesn't
[1:14:40] see it there's a part that says hold on
[1:14:42] buddy it's coming it's called patience
[1:14:45] it's a trigger it's a brain function
[1:14:47] that's there that keeps reminding your
[1:14:49] desire to have something to have
[1:14:51] excitement to have a frill thrill to be
[1:14:54] rewarded keep saying you don't need the
[1:14:56] reward now it's coming so patience Works
[1:14:59] to tell the reward that the reward part
[1:15:01] of the brain the pleasure sent to the
[1:15:03] brain don't worry it's coming
[1:15:06] and when the reward comes it comes in
[1:15:08] the form of dopamine
[1:15:11] it's the chemical reward for success
[1:15:14] and so the way that this and the reason
[1:15:16] why the way dopamine works the reason
[1:15:18] why you get such an excitement out of
[1:15:20] certain things is it's the complementary
[1:15:21] systems of stress adrenaline
[1:15:24] and Rewards
[1:15:25] the dopamine that produce your
[1:15:27] excitement
[1:15:29] that produce your Wonder
[1:15:31] that produce the feeling of satisfaction
[1:15:33] but this is where you might be thinking
[1:15:35] man you're out in the weeds brother
[1:15:36] Aaron you're out in the weeds
[1:15:38] but the right balance is necessary
[1:15:42] there must be patience
[1:15:44] that that part of the brain that says
[1:15:46] hold on hold on a reward is coming that
[1:15:49] has to be working
[1:15:51] there has to be perseverance there has
[1:15:53] to be stress meditate on this I want you
[1:15:55] to think about this
[1:15:56] use your
[1:15:59] that even just use that to ponder this
[1:16:03] patience is only built
[1:16:05] and patience is only will only work
[1:16:09] through intermittent reinforcement
[1:16:12] like a patient has a perfect work then
[1:16:15] you you have to have stress you have to
[1:16:16] have tribulation in order for patients
[1:16:18] to be working
[1:16:19] so in order for patients to have a job
[1:16:21] you can't always be rewarded
[1:16:25] this makes a lot of sense to the guy
[1:16:26] who's standing up with the balcony
[1:16:28] behind the future balcony behind them
[1:16:29] makes a lot of sense to me and I and I I
[1:16:32] want to make this very very clear so I'm
[1:16:33] not afraid to labor on it and until I
[1:16:35] kind of get the feedback that it's clear
[1:16:37] and the front row said hey man we get it
[1:16:40] but patience is only Built it's only
[1:16:43] working through intermittent
[1:16:44] reinforcement not constant stimulation
[1:16:47] if patience if we get rid of patients
[1:16:49] and the reward centers
[1:16:52] right patience is out of the picture
[1:16:54] don't have anything to do with it
[1:16:57] if we get rewards too often or too
[1:16:59] frequently
[1:17:00] then we quit
[1:17:02] when rewards aren't present
[1:17:05] if we get excited if we get happy if we
[1:17:07] get thrilled if we get the endorphin
[1:17:08] rush if we get the dopamine if we get
[1:17:10] that too often then we get begin to lose
[1:17:12] patience when we don't get rewarded soon
[1:17:15] enough is it starting to click
[1:17:18] the death of patience
[1:17:20] it's exactly where we are
[1:17:22] the death of patience has resulted in
[1:17:24] the wonderlust and the Wonder lost
[1:17:26] why because the world has reversed
[1:17:28] engine reverse engineered
[1:17:30] God's process
[1:17:32] that God has designed for our Perfection
[1:17:35] and his purpose
[1:17:37] it's the death of patience that's
[1:17:38] resulted in that aimless wondering if
[1:17:41] the death of patience that resulted in
[1:17:42] the Lost Wonder of Christ
[1:17:45] because the world has recognized the way
[1:17:47] that we are wired and the way that we
[1:17:49] work
[1:17:50] and they've engineered a process for us
[1:17:51] to experience gain without suffering
[1:17:55] and daily we're provided with the
[1:17:57] feelings of success and rewards without
[1:17:58] any real patience without any really
[1:18:00] real effort without any real development
[1:18:03] and many of our information and
[1:18:05] communication Technologies to use a
[1:18:08] technical term ICT
[1:18:10] that's your cell phones your tablets
[1:18:12] your computers it's your MP3 players
[1:18:14] anything that's going to use for
[1:18:15] information conveying information or
[1:18:17] communication they manipulate our minds
[1:18:19] many of our systems of this give us the
[1:18:23] magical effect of achieving something
[1:18:25] the magical effect of overcoming
[1:18:28] all by bypassing real patients
[1:18:31] and they've created the illusion now
[1:18:34] that you've gained something
[1:18:36] through some effort it's completely
[1:18:39] empty
[1:18:41] you can log on to Clash of Clans you
[1:18:43] could log on to Minecraft you can and
[1:18:45] find that someone's hacked you and
[1:18:47] stolen all of it all everything can be
[1:18:49] gone in a moment and say well how do I
[1:18:51] get it back you don't
[1:18:52] the server failed I had my whole life on
[1:18:55] that well it's gone now
[1:19:00] these systems have created the magical
[1:19:03] literal physiological feeling of success
[1:19:08] by bypassing the natural process
[1:19:11] our games our programs our social media
[1:19:14] interactions are all increased this
[1:19:16] dopamine give us an increase of dopamine
[1:19:18] and adrenaline in our brains
[1:19:21] right whenever there's a buzz whenever
[1:19:24] you get a notification let me say this
[1:19:26] to the 50-somethings when you heard you
[1:19:27] got mail what happened
[1:19:30] right whoa
[1:19:32] right and you went to find out to who's
[1:19:34] it from
[1:19:36] AOL wants me to renew I am but it
[1:19:39] created tension
[1:19:40] it created some stress at one point
[1:19:42] right that's the whole sound of the
[1:19:44] modem
[1:19:45] for those who had Prodigy what did it do
[1:19:47] it created this Pavlov's dog
[1:19:51] you hear that honey it's connecting to
[1:19:54] the web you were conditioned you knew
[1:19:56] something new was coming
[1:19:58] it's the way these all of these things
[1:20:00] create this to check your WhatsApp
[1:20:02] status to see how many have viewed it to
[1:20:04] look for notifications emails all these
[1:20:07] things to open up games to check the
[1:20:08] brackets all these things and and and
[1:20:10] running all the it's even the very thing
[1:20:13] that creates why Sports is so uh gets
[1:20:15] such a lock on people because it has the
[1:20:17] right balance between stress and Rewards
[1:20:20] unless you're a Browns fans it's just
[1:20:22] always stress
[1:20:27] but this is I brother Mitch if you could
[1:20:29] show this statement
[1:20:31] this is what they conclude your brain
[1:20:33] chemistry is just being fooled into
[1:20:34] thinking you're accomplishing something
[1:20:37] foreign
[1:20:39] I just put it as a quote just to say it
[1:20:41] exactly the way the author wrote it
[1:20:43] you're being fooled into thinking you're
[1:20:45] accomplishing something so your brain
[1:20:47] gives you a dopamine rush and you get
[1:20:49] the sense of satisfaction praise honor
[1:20:52] glory I've accomplished something isn't
[1:20:55] that great I I am now on level 12 and I
[1:20:58] am now I have now accomplished this and
[1:21:00] I've been able to line all these colors
[1:21:01] up and I've been able to do this and
[1:21:02] I've been able to do that and and we
[1:21:04] make sure that we accumulate and we keep
[1:21:05] the score going and I've done this and
[1:21:06] I've done that I'm a genius in spelling
[1:21:08] bee and I'm I'm able to get the the
[1:21:09] world done in three tries every time and
[1:21:11] you get this feeling of oh my goodness
[1:21:15] Graces killing it today what have you
[1:21:18] done did you close a major merger and
[1:21:20] acquisition did you pass some sort of
[1:21:22] certification no I passed a level and
[1:21:25] you know you know I finally won in Smash
[1:21:27] Bros or whatever it is
[1:21:29] I finally learned how to download
[1:21:30] fortnite on my phone
[1:21:32] there's there's things that we consider
[1:21:34] great and why do we feel that way we
[1:21:36] feel it
[1:21:37] can I get a witness
[1:21:41] and all the while patience is dying
[1:21:46] the world is destroying patience
[1:21:49] and with the death of patients
[1:21:50] impatience is born
[1:21:52] how
[1:21:53] because now you can do things a thousand
[1:21:56] times a day that give you the immediate
[1:21:57] dopamine Rush
[1:21:59] if you don't like the video you're
[1:22:01] watching don't worry it's going to end
[1:22:02] it's just a tick tock right
[1:22:04] YouTube's going to be overrun with
[1:22:06] shorts right where everything's just
[1:22:08] short little Snippets sound bites you
[1:22:10] don't have enough time to listen to a
[1:22:12] podcast you just need the sound bites
[1:22:13] right there's that's the way we're
[1:22:15] getting everything's in short
[1:22:16] everything's quick if you don't and we
[1:22:18] have enough at our disposal now but if
[1:22:19] you're watching listing or trying to
[1:22:21] read something if it doesn't get your
[1:22:22] attention and you don't get that stress
[1:22:24] and that tension working and you don't
[1:22:26] get that reward coming you just move on
[1:22:27] to the next one
[1:22:30] and what's happening our attention spans
[1:22:31] are shrinking
[1:22:33] our capacity to focus is wasting away we
[1:22:36] don't have the we don't have the
[1:22:37] patience to endure we don't have the
[1:22:39] patience to press how appropriate that
[1:22:41] I'm preaching an hour and a half this
[1:22:42] morning why because what's happening is
[1:22:44] all of our press and all of our patients
[1:22:46] is just dwelling our attention span is
[1:22:48] dwindling
[1:22:49] I wanted to use a title called chasing
[1:22:51] the dragon I wanted to allude to not the
[1:22:54] way that some would do heroin but
[1:22:55] actually allude to the the thing that
[1:22:57] the way that people get enamored with
[1:22:59] the high
[1:23:00] and the reason why they keep doing the
[1:23:02] things that they're doing is they're
[1:23:03] trying to recapture the magic
[1:23:05] they want to have that experience they
[1:23:06] want to have that feeling and you felt
[1:23:07] it through some sort of interaction or
[1:23:09] engagement one of these processes has
[1:23:11] created this dopamine effect and you're
[1:23:12] you're looking you're chasing that high
[1:23:14] you're chasing that stimulation and
[1:23:16] you're pursuing a reward but the reward
[1:23:18] is empty
[1:23:19] it's vanity
[1:23:21] because what happens and I'm talking
[1:23:22] about very very practical things in our
[1:23:24] lives whether it's your cell phone
[1:23:25] whether your tablet whether the gaming
[1:23:27] system you use whether it's the systems
[1:23:29] you're using whether it be on Pinterest
[1:23:30] or social media whatever it may be
[1:23:32] there's some gamification to it and
[1:23:35] there's some way that some Mark
[1:23:37] Zuckerberg somewhere has realized that
[1:23:39] you're the commodity and if they could
[1:23:41] just get you in that cycle of ping
[1:23:44] reward status recognition honor
[1:23:47] elevation points or whatever it'll get
[1:23:50] you in an addiction it is an addiction
[1:23:53] where now you get a dopamine rush and
[1:23:56] your dopamine gets you searching and
[1:23:58] you're searching gets you the dopamine
[1:24:00] and it puts you down the path to where
[1:24:02] now you just begin to chase more and to
[1:24:04] chase more and Chase more and then it
[1:24:06] becomes difficult
[1:24:07] becomes an addiction
[1:24:09] becomes absent-minded
[1:24:12] you could tell someone hey can you catch
[1:24:14] can you give me so-and-so's phone number
[1:24:15] and they'll grab their phone and without
[1:24:18] even thinking about it they've opened up
[1:24:21] some other app
[1:24:23] and check so many other things and
[1:24:25] they're like are you going to get that
[1:24:25] number for me like oh oh yeah
[1:24:28] and you think how do you know this
[1:24:30] brother Aaron
[1:24:31] discernment
[1:24:39] somebody's standing here right now
[1:24:44] with The Gingham tie on
[1:24:46] who's done this before and I'm talking
[1:24:48] to you
[1:24:50] You Know Who You Are
[1:24:52] see him with The Gingham tie getting
[1:24:54] ready for church
[1:25:00] so you say well how is this relevant how
[1:25:02] is this relevant I want to bring it down
[1:25:03] to home now
[1:25:05] with the death of patience
[1:25:07] our desire for Christ and our motivation
[1:25:09] for Christ is dying
[1:25:12] because our minds are being conditioned
[1:25:13] for cheap Rewards
[1:25:15] our body our mind we're craving it's an
[1:25:16] addiction we're in the cycle and we
[1:25:19] become we're we're being conditioned for
[1:25:21] substitute rewards
[1:25:23] the the dopamine Rush of a text
[1:25:26] right a like or a follow
[1:25:29] a new achievement unlocked in games
[1:25:32] and we and we have and we have all these
[1:25:34] substitute cheap rewards and they come
[1:25:36] so easy
[1:25:38] and now we're applying ourselves to all
[1:25:39] these empty Pursuits instead of The
[1:25:41] Wonder of Christ
[1:25:43] and the Bible says in Philippians 2 5
[1:25:44] and 6 let this mind be in you which was
[1:25:47] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[1:25:49] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:25:51] with God God likeness is not something
[1:25:52] easily grasped
[1:25:54] thought it not Robert to be equal with
[1:25:56] God not only does it carry the context
[1:25:57] that it was he had equality a God
[1:26:00] against which there was no law but it
[1:26:02] also means it's not something easily
[1:26:04] grasp or acquired
[1:26:06] you can't just grab perfection
[1:26:08] you can't just and listen if you think
[1:26:12] if you think that you're actually
[1:26:13] achieving the things that you achieved
[1:26:15] with these games and these things that
[1:26:17] have been developed it's intentionally
[1:26:19] done a certain way to create a certain
[1:26:21] balance between stress and reward they
[1:26:24] want you to fail so many times but they
[1:26:26] also need you to succeed enough times so
[1:26:28] that you keep coming back and you think
[1:26:30] you're actually good at that game and
[1:26:32] you're the one being played
[1:26:39] and and there may not be anybody in this
[1:26:41] church that plays games I don't know
[1:26:43] so apply it to whatever is applicable
[1:26:46] but we get it's when we are too easily
[1:26:49] when it's too easy to enjoy the
[1:26:51] pleasures of sin for a season
[1:26:53] when it's just too accessible and too
[1:26:55] easy to get the dopamine Rush from our
[1:26:57] devices from the programs from the shows
[1:26:59] from the podcast from the books from all
[1:27:01] these other things that we like to
[1:27:02] digest when it just becomes that too
[1:27:04] easy
[1:27:05] to enjoy the pleasures of the Mind
[1:27:07] then it's harder to patiently endure
[1:27:11] and in fact it says you can only know
[1:27:12] Christ through patience
[1:27:14] you can only known through enduring
[1:27:17] in Genesis chapter 15 verse 1 it says to
[1:27:19] Abraham after these things the word of
[1:27:21] the Lord came to Abram in a vision
[1:27:22] saying fear not Abram I am thy shield
[1:27:24] and thy exceeding great reward after
[1:27:26] what things you know what happened in
[1:27:28] verse 14 he fought against Kings he went
[1:27:31] after and saved his nephew lot and he
[1:27:33] restores him he's fighting to rescue lot
[1:27:35] and then just immediately before this
[1:27:36] chapter turns it turns to the next
[1:27:38] chapter He Turned Down The Spoils of
[1:27:40] Sodom
[1:27:42] he thought he'd labored and and he had
[1:27:45] fought things out and he had an
[1:27:46] opportunity he saw him say Hey you could
[1:27:48] keep this you can have this he says I
[1:27:49] don't want anything from your hand he
[1:27:51] turned it all down and after he turns
[1:27:53] down these spoils after he spot and
[1:27:55] after he's labored God says I am thy
[1:27:57] covering and I am thy exceeding great
[1:28:00] reward
[1:28:01] it was only after the battle that
[1:28:03] communion was served it was only after
[1:28:05] the fight it was only after resisting it
[1:28:07] was only after enduring that God could
[1:28:09] actually be the reward and we Christ has
[1:28:11] lost his Wonder because we want him to
[1:28:13] come as easy as everything else does in
[1:28:15] this life
[1:28:17] you don't even have to be a chef and you
[1:28:19] can cook four-star meals just order it
[1:28:21] in a box it'll show up it'll tell you
[1:28:23] how to cook it how to do it and it's
[1:28:24] perfect
[1:28:26] you don't you you don't have to be you
[1:28:28] don't have to have an expensive smoker
[1:28:30] anymore and know all the science of
[1:28:32] smoking and the Mildred reaction and
[1:28:33] everything all you need is just buy the
[1:28:34] right Machine push the red button put
[1:28:37] the meat on perfectly smoked brisket
[1:28:42] all right write that down somebody I
[1:28:45] know the channel next time right
[1:28:47] that's exactly how easy it is anymore
[1:28:49] and even things that we enjoy now get it
[1:28:51] comes so easy
[1:28:53] but Christ is not that way
[1:28:55] it says of Abraham in Hebrews 6 5 and so
[1:28:57] after he had patiently endured he
[1:29:00] obtained the promise
[1:29:02] let me say Christ is still our reward
[1:29:04] I'm closing with this Christ is still
[1:29:06] our reward
[1:29:07] but our minds are being hijacked
[1:29:10] our brains are being hacked
[1:29:12] and we've got this outward man that's
[1:29:14] not perishing
[1:29:17] the outward man's not perishing enough
[1:29:19] it's being kept Alive by all the
[1:29:21] adrenaline and dopamine
[1:29:23] and meanwhile The Wonder of Christ is
[1:29:25] being lost
[1:29:27] and in order to restore The Wonder of
[1:29:28] Christ you have to recognize the
[1:29:30] influences
[1:29:32] that have tilted the scales
[1:29:35] because I promise you it's not a matter
[1:29:37] of trying to keep this outward man fully
[1:29:39] vitalized and then somehow have a
[1:29:41] healthy spiritual man and I just want to
[1:29:43] dip in and out
[1:29:45] that's the danger of how that we've
[1:29:46] redefined religion religion is a part of
[1:29:48] a person's life whereas when Paul talked
[1:29:49] about the gospel it was their life
[1:29:52] to a Jew it was their life their
[1:29:53] religion was their life their something
[1:29:55] they revered in reverence there was
[1:29:57] something they were in all this God who
[1:29:58] manifested himself and gave him these
[1:30:00] precious promises so there was much the
[1:30:02] temple itself was a representation of
[1:30:04] Heaven on Earth everything to them was
[1:30:05] so literal and so real it's got to be
[1:30:08] the same way for us as a gentile bride
[1:30:10] he has to become the invisible has to
[1:30:13] become more real to us and more
[1:30:14] wonderful to us than everything the
[1:30:16] outward man sees and feeds on and enjoys
[1:30:18] and the only way we're going to reawaken
[1:30:21] The Wonder of Christ is to cause the
[1:30:23] outward man to perish
[1:30:25] and recognize the influences that are
[1:30:28] keeping our brain in this
[1:30:30] dopamine-induced Loop
[1:30:32] and the cycles of addiction that we're
[1:30:35] all feeding into that have caused us to
[1:30:37] forget just how wonderful Christ is
[1:30:40] brother Randall I believe it's in Christ
[1:30:42] as the mystery God revealed he says why
[1:30:43] do you hunger Church why do you thirst
[1:30:45] it's the father trying to reveal this
[1:30:47] hidden secret to you but you let so many
[1:30:49] things get it out of you Christ is
[1:30:51] wanting to reveal to you him his wonder
[1:30:54] and it's there the appetites there the
[1:30:56] desires there the inward man is built
[1:30:59] and designed to experience that and it's
[1:31:02] going to take patience to see his glory
[1:31:04] it's going to take patience to see it
[1:31:05] but we get caught in the Cheap Thrills
[1:31:07] they come too quickly they come too
[1:31:09] easily oh God help us
[1:31:11] I say that if the if the majority of you
[1:31:14] have not entered into that let me say it
[1:31:16] as a proclamation to defend against it
[1:31:19] ever happening and to protect our
[1:31:22] children's Hearts from it
[1:31:24] my how we should be so
[1:31:26] respectful of how easily the world can
[1:31:29] begin to train our young children's
[1:31:31] Minds
[1:31:32] brother bam said rock and roll rock and
[1:31:34] roll music will catch their attention
[1:31:35] that quick that was with the record that
[1:31:37] might be playing on a jukebox in a
[1:31:39] restaurant now what does the world do
[1:31:41] with all the devices that are available
[1:31:43] behind a closed door
[1:31:47] in Revelations chapter 2
[1:31:50] verses one to five I'll close this
[1:31:52] because this will be a good
[1:31:56] you say brother Aaron why are you
[1:31:58] closing I'm running out of notes
[1:32:00] I could go to the next one but
[1:32:03] this is all I have slides for but I want
[1:32:04] to read this because I think it'll
[1:32:05] provide a nice touch point for the next
[1:32:07] service maybe we'll pick up on some of
[1:32:08] these things on Sunday
[1:32:09] unto the angel the Church of Ephesus
[1:32:11] right these things saith the he that
[1:32:13] holdeth the Seven Stars in his right
[1:32:15] hand now keep in mind the end
[1:32:18] of laodicea crisis on the outside
[1:32:20] knocking
[1:32:22] what is he wanting to do
[1:32:24] awaken you to the Wonder
[1:32:27] that's what he wants he wants you to
[1:32:29] come into fellowship with him
[1:32:31] he walketh in the midst of the seven
[1:32:32] golden candlesticks and this is what he
[1:32:34] says
[1:32:35] I know that works and thy labor and thy
[1:32:38] patience
[1:32:40] how that cannot bear them which are evil
[1:32:43] and thou has tried them which say
[1:32:45] they're Apostles and are not and has
[1:32:47] found them Liars
[1:32:48] and it's born and has patience
[1:32:50] it comes later to the thyterian age and
[1:32:52] gives them a similar comment of the
[1:32:53] compliment of their patients he comes to
[1:32:55] Philadelphia compliments them on their
[1:32:56] patients patients has born and has
[1:32:58] patience and for my namesake has labor
[1:33:00] and has not fainted
[1:33:02] nevertheless
[1:33:04] I have someone against thee
[1:33:06] because thou has left thy first love
[1:33:09] it was the dying of patience
[1:33:11] so he says remember therefore from wince
[1:33:13] Thou Art fallen from what the works the
[1:33:14] labor and the patience from the bearing
[1:33:17] and the patience remember therefore from
[1:33:18] one start following and repent and do
[1:33:20] the first works
[1:33:23] or else I'll come to unto thee quickly
[1:33:25] remove thy Candlestick out of his place
[1:33:26] except thou repent without the patience
[1:33:28] there's no reward
[1:33:31] what did the death the patients result
[1:33:32] in the cooling off of their love
[1:33:36] and as love waned so did The Wonder of
[1:33:38] Christ
[1:33:39] that's what I want us to be awakened to
[1:33:41] that's what I want us looking for every
[1:33:43] day
[1:33:44] I want us to be living for that I want
[1:33:46] us to do it as a church I want us to do
[1:33:47] it in our families I want us to do it as
[1:33:49] individuals that I want to be less
[1:33:51] enthused and enamored with the things of
[1:33:53] this world
[1:33:54] and More in Wonder of Christ
[1:33:58] that's what I want
[1:34:01] Brothers if he could come to your
[1:34:02] instruments
[1:34:05] brother Branham writes this about this
[1:34:07] very word verse in the scripture
[1:34:09] he says who walketh in the midst of the
[1:34:11] seven golden candlesticks
[1:34:13] how meaningful are those words when
[1:34:15] viewed in light of the scripture
[1:34:18] which describes him as Christ
[1:34:22] who's in who is our life
[1:34:27] for Christ indeed is the life of the
[1:34:30] church
[1:34:31] she has no other life
[1:34:34] right now catch this on the death of
[1:34:36] patience watch how he says this without
[1:34:37] him she's simply religious Society a
[1:34:41] club a meaningless gather of the
[1:34:43] Gathering of the people
[1:34:44] a corpse Bejeweled and dressed is still
[1:34:47] a corpse
[1:34:49] so the church no matter what her
[1:34:51] programs and her gracious efforts might
[1:34:52] achieve without Christ she is a corpse
[1:34:56] also
[1:34:59] and what this is the next phrase
[1:35:01] before we get to it I want you to look
[1:35:03] at this without Christ in us we're just
[1:35:06] a corpse
[1:35:08] without the Wonder of Christ alive with
[1:35:10] that Vitality we're just corpse
[1:35:13] with the death of patience comes the
[1:35:15] death of of Wonder for Christ we just
[1:35:18] become Corpses
[1:35:19] no matter what kind of club we have no
[1:35:21] matter what kind of gatherings no matter
[1:35:22] how Bejeweled and dressed we might be
[1:35:24] you're still just a corpse
[1:35:26] no matter how many rewards you can gain
[1:35:28] and how much dopamine and adrenaline you
[1:35:30] experience on a daily basis no matter
[1:35:32] how much you may feel that you're
[1:35:33] blessed if Christ isn't your life you're
[1:35:35] still just a corpse
[1:35:39] but then he says but with or him
[1:35:41] intermitted
[1:35:44] with him motivating her
[1:35:47] that calls right back to God's process
[1:35:49] of character development it goes right
[1:35:51] back to God's way of patience and
[1:35:53] incentives and you hold out an incentive
[1:35:56] this is God's way with him and her midst
[1:35:58] with him motivating her she becomes the
[1:36:01] wonderment of all
[1:36:04] is it that we become the wonderment of
[1:36:06] all his body the fullness of him that
[1:36:08] filleth all in all when he becomes the
[1:36:10] wonderment to us when he becomes our
[1:36:13] wonder when he becomes our life when
[1:36:15] it's him that is in US motivating us
[1:36:18] when he becomes our motivation when we
[1:36:21] allow him to find the right balance of
[1:36:23] tribulation and re-blessings and the
[1:36:25] right balance of pressure and rewards
[1:36:27] the right blessing of stress and honor
[1:36:30] and and pressure in Praise let God find
[1:36:34] the right balance in our lives then
[1:36:37] we'll find that he is a Wonder
[1:36:41] and then we can become
[1:36:43] the wonderment of all
[1:36:45] Christ is still our Wonder
[1:36:48] and I hope that you can see it in a
[1:36:50] picture today that there is a death of
[1:36:52] patience
[1:36:53] and it has happened in a society that
[1:36:56] knows that we're looking for a a a
[1:36:59] chemical the reward in our brains we're
[1:37:01] looking for it and we're experiencing it
[1:37:04] in every single phase of life we're
[1:37:06] experiencing it without patience
[1:37:11] without patience
[1:37:13] and because of that
[1:37:15] whenever we do in have to endure we quit
[1:37:18] way too easily
[1:37:21] because we haven't learned to wait for
[1:37:22] it
[1:37:23] we haven't learned to wait haven't
[1:37:24] learned to wait haven't learned to wait
[1:37:27] and patience is waiting on God and
[1:37:29] waiting for God
[1:37:30] and perfection in his patience
[1:37:33] I pray that God would help us help us to
[1:37:36] to keep patients alive
[1:37:39] and awaken the Wonder of Christ in our
[1:37:41] lives
