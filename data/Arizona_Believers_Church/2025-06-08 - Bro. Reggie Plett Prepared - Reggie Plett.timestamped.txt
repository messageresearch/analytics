[0:00] I just want to read verse five though I
[0:03] would encourage you to read the entire
[0:05] chapter. Um I have a Scofield study
[0:09] Bible and I think Dr. Scoffield does a
[0:12] really nice job um
[0:17] with his study Bible here. He shows how
[0:20] that Psalms chapter 22 chap chapter 23
[0:24] and 24 he says are are like a trilogy.
[0:28] And
[0:30] he just kind of highlights how that
[0:32] chapter 22
[0:34] um is the good shepherd giving his life
[0:37] for his sheep. And then chapter 23 is
[0:43] this same shepherd
[0:46] that is brought to life again from the
[0:49] from the dead, tenderly cares for the
[0:52] sheep. And in chapter 24, he appears as
[0:55] king in glory to own and reward the
[0:58] sheep. So when you read these chapters
[1:02] together, it's just a beautiful picture.
[1:04] You get to see the whole picture of of
[1:06] our great shepherd. We're just going to
[1:08] read in Psalms chapter 23 and verse 5.
[1:12] It says, "Thou preparest a table before
[1:16] me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou
[1:19] anointest my head with oil. My cup runth
[1:24] over."
[1:27] Amen. Let's bow our heads for a word of
[1:30] prayer. our precious heavenly father.
[1:34] Lord, it's so good to come into this
[1:37] place that's Lord been dedicated and
[1:39] consecrated for your service, Lord.
[1:43] Lord, we come here expecting, Lord, to
[1:46] see and to hear from you, Lord. As we
[1:49] gather here, we come with many needs on
[1:51] our hearts, Lord. And
[1:55] we've all come realizing that we're
[1:58] human and Lord, we fail. so many times.
[2:01] And Lord, we need you to be our guide.
[2:05] And Lord, as
[2:07] we open up these this book called the
[2:12] Bible, Lord, we realize that these are
[2:14] your eternal thoughts that are being
[2:17] expressed to us. And we just ask, Lord,
[2:19] that you would quicken it now, make it
[2:21] alive to us. that Lord it would uh
[2:25] inspire us Lord to leave this place
[2:28] better than what we came and Lord we are
[2:32] just asking that this word would not
[2:35] only inspire us but God it would change
[2:37] us would make us better
[2:40] Lord it would make us uh better in our
[2:44] homes in our lives and Lord uh to all
[2:48] mankind Lord we would be as our pastor
[2:50] said lately a billboard for Christ.
[2:54] Lord, we pray for our pastor. We ask God
[2:57] that you would be with him and his
[2:58] family that God may the people that he's
[3:01] around and that he's ministering, God,
[3:04] may they receive from the gift that
[3:05] you've given our pastor, Lord, we ask
[3:07] that you would bring him and his family
[3:09] back to us safely. And God, may we as a
[3:12] body here, may we uh be our hearts knit
[3:17] together, Lord, in Christ, that God, we
[3:21] could catch a great catch of fish, Lord,
[3:23] for you, Lord. We want to be of service
[3:26] for you. And we just commit the service
[3:29] and every portion of it, every member
[3:31] here, we commit ourselves to you, Lord,
[3:34] asking and inviting you to be our guest
[3:36] of honor to speak to us. For we ask it
[3:39] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And God
[3:42] bless you. You can have your seats.
[3:45] My title today is prepared.
[3:50] And I want to just kind of overview
[3:53] Psalm 23 here so that we're all
[3:56] comfortable and on the same page. And I
[3:59] pray that you are comfortable today.
[4:01] That today we look at this service as uh
[4:04] each of us as children of God and guests
[4:07] at a feast. and we're just going to pull
[4:09] up to the table and we're going to take
[4:11] the this bread of life and we're all
[4:14] going to enjoy ourselves from the good
[4:16] things that God has given us. Amen. As
[4:19] we look in Psalms chapter 23, David
[4:23] starts with the Lord is my shepherd. I
[4:27] shall not want. So David's taking a
[4:29] perspective of he himself being a sheep.
[4:33] That the Lord is my shepherd. I am a
[4:36] sheep and he is my shepherd. And he he
[4:41] he he continues on with what the Lord
[4:43] does for him as a sheep. He maketh me to
[4:46] lie in green pastures. He brings me
[4:48] beside still waters. In other words, the
[4:51] Lord knows how to um make the
[4:54] circumstances around me uh a benefit to
[4:59] me in my life. And he says he restores
[5:03] my soul. He leads me in the paths of
[5:06] righteousness for his name's sake. All
[5:09] for his glory. That in everything that
[5:12] happens to us in our walk in life that
[5:15] God may receive the glory in all of it.
[5:18] And I think every Christian says,
[5:20] "Amen." Lord, that's truly my heart is I
[5:23] want you I want the world to know Jesus
[5:26] Christ is our Lord and our Savior. And
[5:30] he is the same yesterday, today, and
[5:32] forever. And he's still changing lives
[5:36] for the better. Amen.
[5:40] He says that though I walk through the
[5:42] valley of the shadow of death, I will
[5:44] not fear. That even in the times of life
[5:47] that are scary, that are uncertain, that
[5:51] shake us up, that feel like, is this the
[5:53] end? Or what what have I gotten myself
[5:56] into? We don't have to fear. The Lord
[6:01] being our shepherd, we're trusting in
[6:03] him and his ability.
[6:06] Now, he gets to this fifth verse and he
[6:08] says, "Thou preparest
[6:11] a table before me in the presence of
[6:14] mine enemies." And I think that's an
[6:17] interesting scripture for a sheep that
[6:20] the Lord is preparing a table in the
[6:22] presence of his enemies. That David is
[6:24] recognizing that while we're on this
[6:27] journey, that while we're in these
[6:29] pastures, that there are enemies around.
[6:32] That there is an enemy that would like
[6:34] to take and hurt the sheep. David's well
[6:38] aware of that. And we are as as
[6:40] believers are well aware that in this
[6:43] life the enemy and the enemy is don't we
[6:46] don't want to put faces to that that
[6:48] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know the guy.
[6:50] We don't want to put faces to that. But
[6:52] we realize that there is an unseen force
[6:56] that works against the purpose of God.
[7:00] The leading the leadership of God. and
[7:03] he would love nothing more than to
[7:06] tarnish your testimony as a Christian.
[7:14] And so he's saying that he that the Lord
[7:17] is preparing a table in the presence of
[7:20] his enemies
[7:22] and that while in the presence of his
[7:24] enemies and and and and while this table
[7:26] is prepared, the Lord is anointing his
[7:29] head with oil. Now, the imagery here
[7:33] takes me to
[7:35] you you're in a you're in a room. You've
[7:38] been invited to a feast. You've been
[7:40] invited to a party. You've been invited
[7:43] to a very important party where the Lord
[7:47] he he's the Lord of all and everybody
[7:49] recognizes who he is. And he owns this
[7:53] party. He owns this place that he's
[7:55] inviting us all to. And when you come to
[7:58] this party, you recognize that everybody
[8:02] else at this party is your enemy
[8:07] and that you've been invited to this
[8:09] party and you start getting a little bit
[8:11] antsy knowing who's at this party with
[8:15] you, who's been invited. And in the
[8:18] midst of recognizing that everybody else
[8:21] around you is not here there the eyes
[8:25] that are gazed upon you are not eyes of
[8:28] aw, it's so nice they're here. It's what
[8:32] is he doing here? What is she doing
[8:34] here?
[8:37] And while you're at this feast and while
[8:40] you're at this party and you're just
[8:41] honored to be invited to this L the
[8:44] Lord's party, the Lord in front of the
[8:47] presence of your enemies is anointing
[8:50] your head with oil. In other words,
[8:53] saying you're the reason for this party,
[8:57] Jesus. That the Lord is recognizing you
[9:00] especially in the presence of your
[9:03] enemies. It's your head that's being
[9:06] anointed and you're being recognized as
[9:10] the guest of honor at this party.
[9:15] Now you say, "Wow, what a privilege.
[9:17] What an honor." But at the same time
[9:19] recognizing
[9:21] that the eyes that are upon you are not
[9:23] so thrilled with with what's going on.
[9:29] But the Lord nonetheless
[9:32] is anointing your head and has prepared
[9:36] a table and a feast before you in the
[9:40] presence of your enemies
[9:44] that it was the Lord that prepared this
[9:46] feast for you. And in all of that, you
[9:50] don't feel threatened because the Lord
[9:54] has your best intention in mind. Amen.
[9:57] Amen. That he's saying, "You're my guest
[10:01] of honor. I've got you. I've got you
[10:04] covered. I have you. You are under my
[10:08] protection."
[10:10] That this party, you in other words, you
[10:13] belong to me and nobody's going to
[10:16] nobody's going to hurt you while in my
[10:19] presence. Amen.
[10:33] I think we'll get into that, a little
[10:35] more of that as we go on. But keep that
[10:38] in mind
[10:40] as we're talking about being prepared.
[10:44] And what is prepared?
[10:48] In Exodus chap 23:es
[10:51] 20- 23, the first part of 23, the
[10:55] scripture says, "Behold, I send an angel
[10:58] before thee to keep thee in the way,
[11:02] and to bring thee into the place which I
[11:05] have prepared.
[11:06] Beware of him, and obey his voice.
[11:09] Provoke him not, for he will not pardon
[11:12] your transgressions, for my name is in
[11:15] him."
[11:17] But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice,
[11:19] and do all that I speak, then I will be
[11:23] an enemy unto thine enemies, and an
[11:25] adversary unto thine adversaries, for
[11:28] mine angel shall go before thee. Now,
[11:38] I think that's a little bit of a
[11:39] highlight to exactly what we were just
[11:42] saying is that the Lord is telling
[11:46] Moses, he's speaking to Moses. And this
[11:49] is his instruction to to go and to
[11:52] deliver the children of Israel.
[11:57] But the Lord is saying, "I'm gonna send
[12:00] an angel before you, Moses." That that
[12:02] that I'm not sending you
[12:06] alone, but I'm sending an angel to go
[12:08] before you. Now, this isn't just an
[12:10] angel. And we'll we'll get into that a
[12:13] little bit later, but he says, "My name
[12:14] is in this angel. The angel that I'm
[12:16] sending, my name is in him."
[12:19] And he says, "Obey his voice. Don't
[12:21] provoke him."
[12:24] So, that perks your ears a little bit.
[12:26] And he
[12:27] But he says that if you will obey his
[12:30] voice and obey him, I'll become an enemy
[12:34] to your enemies. In other words, I'm
[12:36] that great shepherd. I I will protect
[12:38] you. You won't you don't have to worry
[12:40] about that. You if you can find
[12:43] obedience to the word of God. God's got
[12:46] the rest covered.
[12:50] It's like it's like telling a child like
[12:53] just if you'll just obey me. It's like
[12:56] you you know you tell your children if
[12:58] you'll just listen to me.
[13:01] And it's like is that so hard?
[13:08] And we're all like,
[13:11] "Hallelujah."
[13:14] kind of.
[13:17] So, Brother Brandon preaches so many so
[13:20] many services with this scripture. He
[13:22] opens with this scripture and he he's
[13:25] got so many different titles. But in the
[13:28] in the message, my angel shall go before
[13:30] thee in 1953,
[13:32] brother Brandham explains explaining
[13:34] these scriptures says and that pillar of
[13:37] fire or the angel was the angel of the
[13:39] covenant. I believe all ministers would
[13:41] agree with that that that was the angel
[13:44] of the covenant. Okay, so that angel
[13:47] that he sent before him was the angel of
[13:48] the covenant. Okay, what does that mean?
[13:51] If it was the angel of the covenant,
[13:52] then it was the Lord Jesus. It was God,
[13:55] the Holy Spirit. So, we're understanding
[13:58] that this angel that God sent before
[14:00] Moses, Brother Brandham's saying that
[14:02] was the Lord Jesus, but it wasn't the
[14:04] Lord Jesus because the Lord Jesus hadn't
[14:06] come yet. So, Brother Brandham's trying
[14:08] to qualify and say it was the Holy
[14:10] Spirit. It was the spirit of God. So,
[14:13] we're all recognizing that, oh, okay,
[14:16] Brother Brandham's tying, you know, like
[14:19] there's not a trinity. It's all the same
[14:21] God. So, he's tying that together for
[14:23] all for for everybody. It says, "For
[14:26] Moses,
[14:28] uh, for Moses chose to suffer the
[14:30] reproach of Christ and counted it
[14:32] greater riches than the treasures of
[14:34] Egypt." Now, he backs up. I'm I'm
[14:36] backing up. I'm going to a couple
[14:38] paragraphs before what I just read. Same
[14:40] message. Brother Brandham says, "God in
[14:42] all ages has had someone to deal with
[14:45] here on earth." So God has not just uh
[14:49] dealt uh spoken out of clouds or uh out
[14:52] of lightning bolts, but God's always
[14:54] used men. Man's always been his
[14:56] instrument. So brother Brandham is going
[14:57] into that God in all ages has had
[14:59] someone to deal with here on earth. Ever
[15:01] since he's had an earth he started has
[15:04] never was a time but what he had someone
[15:07] that he could his hands on to send them.
[15:10] And during this time that we're speaking
[15:12] of here, I just read on was he had sent
[15:16] Moses to deliver the children of Israel.
[15:21] He says, "Now it was not Moses that was
[15:23] sent. Moses was just the instrument."
[15:28] Okay. So then who was sent? It was God.
[15:31] God was sending himself. That's the
[15:34] angel he was saying. That's that's what
[15:36] he was saying. I'm going to send an
[15:37] angel before you, Moses.
[15:40] and and and and and and that's me. I'm
[15:43] the one that's gonna go before you. I am
[15:46] that angel. I'm the one that's going to
[15:48] go before you and prepare a way for you,
[15:52] Moses.
[15:53] But he's going to use Moses as an
[15:56] instrument.
[15:58] That's the man he's going to use for the
[16:00] deliverance of his children. But Moses
[16:04] was saying, "Look, it's not me doing
[16:07] this, right? that that it it's God. He's
[16:10] pointing to God. He's pointing to God.
[16:12] And God's messengers that if they're a
[16:14] real true messenger, that's what they
[16:17] do.
[16:22] Now, in my heart, I have believed that
[16:24] God has always been the same all through
[16:26] the ages. In every age, he's been just
[16:28] as he was at the beginning. He was
[16:31] manifested in the fatherhood. He was
[16:33] manifested in the sunship. He's
[16:35] manifested now in the dispensation of
[16:38] the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[16:42] We believe that.
[16:45] So God is saying, "I've prepared
[16:50] an angel to go before you, Moses." And
[16:53] he's also saying that he's preparing
[16:56] Moses. So he's not only prepared a way,
[17:00] but he's also prepared the man
[17:04] and he's prepared a place for them to go
[17:07] to. And and that's what he told Moses.
[17:09] I've prepared a place for you to go to.
[17:14] But as we see God preparing his men, his
[17:18] messengers, God, we we we we when we
[17:22] read our Bible, when we see the men of
[17:25] God that God has used down through all
[17:27] time, we see God preparing certain men
[17:32] certain ways and in different ways, all
[17:35] kinds of different ways. I this is where
[17:38] we love looking back in history and
[17:41] seeing God using men with different
[17:44] temperaments
[17:45] enable to for a movement to to to
[17:50] inspire God's children to call them and
[17:54] catch their attention. Amen.
[17:57] So in Malachi 4:es 5 and 6, and I know
[18:00] we can all quote this, but we'll have it
[18:02] up here for those
[18:05] who have yet to quote it. So he says,
[18:07] "Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[18:10] prophet." So God is saying, "I'm
[18:12] preparing Elijah the prophet to be sent
[18:16] to you before the coming of the great
[18:19] and dreadful day of the Lord. And he
[18:20] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[18:22] the children and the heart of the
[18:23] children to their fathers lest I come
[18:25] and smite the earth with the curse. And
[18:28] in the church age book in the Leodysian
[18:30] church age,
[18:32] brother Brandham says, "Now this
[18:33] messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations
[18:35] 10:7 is going to do two things.
[18:39] One, according to Malachi 4, he will
[18:42] turn the hearts of the children to the
[18:44] fathers.
[18:46] Two, he will reveal the mysteries of the
[18:49] seven thunders in Revelations 10, which
[18:51] are the revelations contained in the
[18:53] seven seals. It will be these divinely
[18:55] revealed mystery truths that literally
[18:58] turn the hearts of the children to the
[19:00] Pentecostal fathers. Exactly. So,
[19:04] so we see God preparing
[19:07] Malachi 4 for this last day. He's got to
[19:12] prepare this messenger
[19:16] for a purpose to turn the hearts of the
[19:20] believers. So he's got to prepare him
[19:23] and to be able to turn the hearts of the
[19:25] children. If you can get the people to
[19:27] believe you, nothing will stand before
[19:29] your prayer, not even cancer. But you've
[19:32] got to get the people to believe you.
[19:34] Amen.
[19:46] in first kings chapter 17 in verse 9.
[19:51] I'm only reading verse 9. Again, if you
[19:53] read the whole chapter, it would really
[19:55] benefit you in this story. Says, "Arise,
[19:58] get to Zerapath, which belongth to
[20:01] Zidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have
[20:04] commanded a widow woman there to sustain
[20:07] thee." This is the story of Elijah.
[20:10] being called to this widow woman. Now,
[20:13] he's been out in the wilderness. God's
[20:15] had ravens to feed him, but now God
[20:20] says, "Enough of that. No more ravens to
[20:23] feed thee. You need to get up. I've
[20:26] prepared
[20:27] a widow woman to sustain you."
[20:36] It's during the time of the drought.
[20:38] Elijah gets up. He goes to this widow
[20:40] woman's home.
[20:42] She's gathering two sticks. She's
[20:45] gathering sticks together. It says the
[20:47] scripture declares two sticks.
[20:50] Brother Brandham shows us that was the
[20:52] cross that she was preparing to die. It
[20:55] was self-sacrifice. She said, "I've when
[20:58] when Elijah gets to her, he says, uh uh
[21:01] uh what are you doing?" She says, "Well,
[21:04] I'm gathering sticks so that I can make
[21:06] a meal. I've just got a little bit of of
[21:08] oil and a little bit of meal and me and
[21:10] my son, we're going to eat this last
[21:12] meal and then we're going to die. Elijah
[21:15] says, "Okay, go and do it, but make me
[21:18] some meal first."
[21:24] She's like, "I don't have a lot left."
[21:26] He says, "Yeah, but nonetheless, do go
[21:28] and do this. Go and do it." Brother says
[21:31] she recognized he was different. There
[21:34] was something about him that he was a
[21:36] man of God.
[21:38] Amen. She recognized that.
[21:44] And he says, "And if you do this, the
[21:47] oil won't run out. Neither will the meal
[21:50] run dry until the time that God sends
[21:53] rain on the earth."
[21:59] The message be certain of God. I don't
[22:02] know how many of you remember when Voice
[22:04] of God put out the CDs. That was the
[22:06] first one they put out and
[22:08] I put it on every night and I had the
[22:11] first 15 minutes memorized.
[22:14] It was like,
[22:17] hallelujah. I could I could repeat it
[22:19] over because it was the only one I had.
[22:20] It was the only CD I had. You know, I'd
[22:22] just given my heart to the Lord and it
[22:23] was the only one I had. It was just that
[22:25] one over and over and over.
[22:29] Brother Brandham said, 'How that this
[22:31] little woman must have been of the
[22:33] caliber of Elijah
[22:38] because usually your action shows what
[22:40] you are. And again, she had been chosen
[22:43] to entertain God's prophet. Remember,
[22:45] she was a gentile, not a Jew.
[22:50] He says, "And the land was burning up."
[22:52] And no doubt that this little woman
[22:54] being of that caliber, being of the
[22:56] believer type, for we see that God would
[22:59] not have called to her if she hadn't
[23:02] have been a worthy one to entertain
[23:04] God's prophet. For he wouldn't, for he
[23:07] would have never sent his prophet to a
[23:10] house that was unworthy.
[23:14] Now, that is quite a statement. And I my
[23:18] heart just swells because I think, okay,
[23:22] here we go. Let's put these pieces
[23:24] together. She's not a Jew. She's a
[23:26] Gentile. God sends his prophet to her.
[23:29] Brother Brandham says she must have been
[23:30] of the same caliber. Now, for the men,
[23:33] the gun-loving men that are in this room
[23:36] here, we know that the same caliber. So,
[23:40] you have different calibers of of guns
[23:42] and bullets. And the caliber is the size
[23:45] of the bullet. It's it's it's how big
[23:47] the bullet is. It's and and how big the
[23:49] hole is in in the barrel of the gun. And
[23:52] you don't have an uh you don't shoot a
[23:55] 50 caliber bullet through a 9 mm meter
[24:00] gun.
[24:01] It won't fit. It won't fire. And so if
[24:05] there's a 50 caliber gun, it shoots a 50
[24:09] caliber bullet. And brother Brandham is
[24:12] saying that if you believe that Elijah
[24:15] was a 50 caliber prophet. Now I don't
[24:18] know what caliber of prophet you say
[24:19] Elijah was. Maybe you say I he was that
[24:21] he was a 40 caliber.
[24:24] Or if you say no he was a you know he's
[24:26] a major prophet. Elijah was a major
[24:28] prophet in the Bible. If he was a 50
[24:30] caliber prophet he's saying this widow
[24:32] woman was a 50 caliber believer.
[24:45] I mean, it just makes you feel good.
[24:53] He would have never sent his prophet to
[24:55] a home that was unworthy.
[25:03] Just consider your home.
[25:08] And consider I I realize I I think we
[25:11] all do this that God, why me?
[25:14] Why me? Why? Why do I get to hear this?
[25:20] Why Why did I get to hear this message?
[25:23] Why am I so You must be a 50 caliber
[25:28] believer.
[25:30] And you don't even know. You don't even
[25:33] you don't even realize what caliber you
[25:35] are until you start looking at the
[25:38] caliber of the prophet and you start
[25:42] thinking well hey all right
[25:47] God's prepared all that. Now let's keep
[25:50] reading because again this is the next
[25:52] the next uh paragraph and I should have
[25:54] read that says it was not his choosing.
[25:57] In other words wasn't Elijah's choosing
[25:59] it was God's choosing. Amen. It wasn't
[26:02] her bidding. It wasn't the widow woman's
[26:03] bidding. It was God bidding him.
[26:08] It wasn't your choosing. It wasn't It
[26:10] wasn't your And it wasn't Brother
[26:12] Brandham's choosing either that it that
[26:14] it would be him that was sent to this
[26:16] day. But it just so happens that you
[26:19] were chosen to live in this day. and
[26:21] that you were chosen to live in a time
[26:24] that God would send a man that that that
[26:26] that whose purpose was to turn the
[26:30] hearts of the people, those that could
[26:32] believe, those that could hear the
[26:34] message, that they could hear the good
[26:36] things that God has sent in this last
[26:38] day, that divine healing is not just for
[26:41] the apostles, that divine healing, that
[26:44] God is still a healer. That if you need
[26:46] healing, you don't have to rely upon
[26:48] science alone. God is still a healer.
[26:51] God is still able. And that God has sent
[26:54] men in this day to show that God's not
[26:57] dead. God's still moving. That when the
[27:00] doctor can't do when the doctors can do
[27:02] all that they can with the marvelous
[27:05] technologies that science has given us,
[27:07] but even when that doesn't do the job,
[27:11] there's somebody higher you can go to
[27:13] that your faith can touch.
[27:17] Amen. And you say, "God, I need that."
[27:20] There was something in your heart that
[27:22] says, "God, I have to have more than
[27:25] what science can offer. I have to have
[27:27] more than what theologians have to
[27:29] offer. I have to have more than what the
[27:32] seminaries are producing. I have to have
[27:35] more than a feel-good church experience
[27:39] every week that just gets us together
[27:42] for social events. I have to have more
[27:44] than that. God sent a message that would
[27:48] turn your hearts back to the Pentecostal
[27:51] fathers that you could have the same
[27:53] experience that Peter had, that Paul
[27:56] had, that James and John had. That when
[27:59] you read these scriptures and you think,
[28:01] "I wish I could have known those men. I
[28:04] wonder what their lives were like," they
[28:06] would say, "Men just like yours."
[28:09] That's right. We believe just like you.
[28:13] You believe just like us. We're the
[28:15] same. And the messenger that was
[28:17] prepared for this day came and and men
[28:21] around him and brother Brandham never
[28:23] even took all that kind of credit. Now
[28:26] we're able to identify
[28:29] the that that God sends one in an age.
[28:32] We're able to do that. But but brother
[28:35] Brandham said, "Look at what God has
[28:37] sent. Look at the gifts that God has
[28:39] sent." And all of it was to point
[28:44] to the truth.
[28:50] So we see God
[28:52] preparing us these these men down
[28:55] through time.
[28:58] It was a Moses.
[29:00] We see a David.
[29:03] We see the Elijah. We see Elisha.
[29:07] We see John. we see John the Baptist and
[29:11] and and there was a group that caught it
[29:13] and and they were like this is different
[29:15] this man's different
[29:17] and ultimately we know that that
[29:20] keystone that everything was pointing to
[29:22] Jesus Christ
[29:25] everything all the promises from Genesis
[29:27] through was all pointing to that
[29:30] promised seed Jesus Christ
[29:34] and in Hebrews chapter 10 verse Five,
[29:38] we believe Paul is the one who wrote
[29:40] this. Says, "Wherefore, when he cometh
[29:42] into the world, he saith, sacrifice an
[29:45] offering, thou wouldest not, but a body
[29:49] hast thou prepared me."
[29:54] That God was preparing a body for
[29:57] himself.
[29:58] that that the spirit of God,
[30:03] the one that pillar of fire that led the
[30:05] children of Israel,
[30:08] that that that spirit that
[30:12] that that spoke to Elijah, that
[30:17] that that would appear
[30:20] supernaturally from time to time in the
[30:22] Old Testament and the and and even the
[30:25] people like the people of Jericho and
[30:27] And they they they they recognized it.
[30:31] They said, "Man, whoever this God is
[30:33] leading these people, he's God for sure.
[30:36] That's the one true God." And they
[30:39] recognized that.
[30:44] But now God's prepared a body,
[30:47] an actual physical tangible body that
[30:50] walked amongst us. And that's what John
[30:52] said. In the beginning was the word. The
[30:54] word was with God. The word was God. And
[30:56] in verse 14, and the word became flesh
[30:59] and dwelt among us, and now he's
[31:01] prepared a body,
[31:04] that that that great spirit, the creator
[31:07] of all heavens and earth, is now
[31:10] dwelling in a body. And no wonder people
[31:14] missed it because you're thinking if
[31:15] God's gonna be in a body,
[31:20] you know, I mean, I think that's that's
[31:22] this is where you get like, you know,
[31:24] Greek mythology, you know, thinking
[31:26] like, yeah, it'll be like Zeus, you
[31:28] know, like some some jacked bodybuilder
[31:32] or something. But it wasn't. It was so
[31:35] frail and so humble that that everybody
[31:37] overlooked it.
[31:43] And we recognize that body that God
[31:45] prepared. But
[31:49] but this isn't just speaking about that
[31:51] body. This is speaking about a many
[31:56] membered body.
[32:01] that this body that God has prepared
[32:08] is that body that that on the day of
[32:11] Pentecost there was 120 that he broke
[32:14] apart and they were all filled with that
[32:18] same spirit of God that was in Jesus but
[32:21] now it's in many members and then they
[32:24] come out of that upper room and it
[32:26] begins spreading ing 3,000 and then
[32:28] 5,000
[32:30] then and and and and and Peter's like,
[32:33] "This promise is to everybody that would
[32:37] believe." Now, we know that that God
[32:40] says that, you know, I would not that
[32:42] any would perish, but that all should
[32:44] come to repentance. But we know not all
[32:46] will come to repentance. We know that
[32:49] not all will. But for those that do, the
[32:52] promise is that you those that do
[32:56] believe, those that that that do
[32:59] recognize and repent and and repenting
[33:02] is is recognizing I'm going the wrong
[33:04] direction in life. I'm going the wrong
[33:06] way. And and and and it's a military
[33:09] word. Repent means about face. Turn
[33:12] exactly opposite of where you're going.
[33:15] And and so that's what repenting is. is
[33:17] recognizing in life I'm going the wrong
[33:21] way. I'm following my own ideas, my own
[33:24] thoughts, or or or or I'm being
[33:27] manipulated by by whoever else around me
[33:30] to direct my course. And I know that
[33:33] there's something else
[33:36] that's bigger than me that I would like
[33:39] for him to order my steps. And it's this
[33:42] surrender and saying, "God, I'm sorry.
[33:47] Amen.
[33:49] I'm a sorry human being.
[33:53] That's really when you say I'm sorry,
[33:55] you are saying I am sorry,
[34:04] right? Like we just casually say I'm
[34:05] sorry. It's like you know what you just
[34:07] said, right? You're you are sorry.
[34:12] That's what repentance is. says is God I
[34:15] am sorry
[34:16] which means I can't do this on my own
[34:20] and and and and he says that's good now
[34:22] be baptized with the spirit be immersed
[34:25] in it not just sprinkled once uh once a
[34:28] week with that spirit in the service
[34:31] like oo I'm so glad I go to church cuz
[34:33] woo I get a good sprinkling of the
[34:35] spirit every week it's like no you need
[34:38] an immersion
[34:40] in that spirit so that it it's not a
[34:43] once a weak thing. It carries you over
[34:46] and over and over. That's the body he's
[34:49] prepared is a body of people who've been
[34:52] immersed in the spirit who who who are
[34:54] not leading themselves anymore. They've
[34:57] become like David. They've become sheep
[34:59] who say, "I'm not leading this thing.
[35:02] It's God leading me. God's preparing my
[35:04] way. It's not me preparing my way
[35:06] anymore. It's God preparing my God
[35:09] preparing my steps.
[35:12] Hallelujah.
[35:15] Brother Brandham says in the end time
[35:16] evangelism, the end time message
[35:19] the end time message that that that
[35:22] message that is to be that is is is in
[35:25] Revelations chapter 3 that that is to
[35:28] that Leodysian age to that last age. The
[35:31] end time message is to get the bride or
[35:35] that body that God has prepared to get
[35:39] the bride called the bride ready and
[35:42] prepared for the rapture.
[35:46] That's what we're getting prepared for.
[35:48] You say, you know, God's been preparing
[35:50] me. God's preparing me for what?
[35:54] Is there a quiz or like what's he
[35:56] preparing you for? For the rapture.
[35:58] Amen. That's one of the great I feel
[36:01] like the probably the greatest uh uh uh
[36:05] if you want to call it a mystery to that
[36:07] that whole rapture message is that it's
[36:09] not everybody that says Lord Lord is
[36:12] going to enter the kingdom.
[36:14] But those that do the will of my father,
[36:15] that's what Jesus said. Not all that
[36:17] saith the Lord, Lord will will come into
[36:19] that kingdom, but those that do the will
[36:20] of my father. Not that that that that
[36:23] not everybody that says I'm a Christian
[36:25] is part of that bride.
[36:28] And so that's what the the great one of
[36:30] the great mysteries is that that rapture
[36:32] is reserved for a specific people called
[36:36] the bride. This body and he's preparing
[36:40] this message is to prepare us for the
[36:43] rapture. What can it do according to
[36:45] Malachi 4 is bring them back to the
[36:47] faith that was once delivered to the
[36:48] saints. Bring them back to the faith of
[36:50] the fathers. The Pentecostal part in the
[36:52] restoration time. I will restore sayeth
[36:55] the Lord. That's real event end time
[36:57] evangelism.
[37:10] Do you believe that God prepares men
[37:15] to get his people ready?
[37:23] And we all I believe every believer is
[37:25] all looking for a preparation
[37:31] for a place we're going.
[37:34] There's a destination.
[37:37] Jesus says in St. John chapter 14:es 2
[37:40] and 3, "In my father's house are many
[37:42] mansions. If it were not so, I would
[37:45] have told you. I go to prepare a place
[37:50] for you.
[37:53] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[37:56] I will come again and receive you unto
[38:01] myself, that where I am, there ye may be
[38:04] also. Praise God.
[38:07] And all believers
[38:10] from Pentecost on, that's we we're all
[38:14] waiting for that for him to come back.
[38:16] so that we can all go and and when we
[38:18] hear uh brother Brandham who said, "I
[38:21] was so worried. I'm so I was so worried
[38:23] about what happens when you die. I
[38:25] thought that you know I couldn't get
[38:27] shake brother Neville's hand again. We
[38:28] would just be two two clouds passing
[38:30] each other." And and the angel says,
[38:32] "Would you like to see beyond the
[38:34] curtain of time?" He said, "It would
[38:36] help me so much." And he goes over there
[38:39] and he comes back and he tells us it's a
[38:42] real place.
[38:45] whatever you do, don't miss that.
[38:51] He says they're perfectly in you.
[38:53] They're youthful and and and and the men
[38:56] and the women, they're they're they just
[38:58] got beautiful white teeth and and and
[39:00] the the sisters have long hair and the
[39:03] men are so so vibrant. And all of us are
[39:06] going, "Praise God,
[39:10] I can't wait.
[39:13] Amen.
[39:15] And he says, "Man, I mean, the feeling
[39:17] over there, I mean, supreme and and and
[39:20] and all of those words, they don't even
[39:23] touch it."
[39:25] It's like it's real. It's a real place.
[39:29] And Jesus saying, he's saying, "Yeah,
[39:32] I'm going to prepare that place. And if
[39:34] I'm going to prepare a place, do you
[39:36] believe I'll come back to get you to
[39:39] take you to that place?" Amen. And the
[39:42] believers say, "Yeah, I do." Hallelujah.
[39:45] Amen. In Revelations 21 and verse two
[39:49] says, "And I, John, saw the holy city,
[39:52] New Jerusalem, coming down from God out
[39:55] of heaven prepared
[39:58] as a bride adorned for her husband."
[40:00] John says, "I can confirm that when
[40:03] Jesus made that promise, he's telling
[40:06] the truth." Amen. He really was going to
[40:09] prepare a place and he's done it. There
[40:11] is a place that is prepared for you.
[40:19] And then we all get together for
[40:22] lunches. We go all go to each other's
[40:24] homes and we all start talking about
[40:28] what is it going to be like? What's
[40:31] heaven to you?
[40:34] And some say, "Oh, I just want there to
[40:36] be a beach."
[40:38] Some say, "I just want a mountain. I
[40:41] just want mountains around me. I want a
[40:43] cabin isolated in the middle of nowhere.
[40:45] That would be heaven for me." And some
[40:48] say, "I just need the desert. I need
[40:50] that dry." And we and we all start doing
[40:53] this. We all start doing this. What will
[40:56] What is it going to be like?
[41:00] Brother Brandham said, "There's going to
[41:01] be a choir of angels over there." And he
[41:03] says, "And then there'll be a stream.
[41:05] This the the the the the river of life
[41:08] will be flowing through it." And he
[41:09] said, "And you'll hear somebody in the
[41:11] distance singing, Amazing Grace, how
[41:13] sweet the sound that saved a wretch like
[41:15] me." He said, "That'll be me. Go look
[41:18] for me. You'll find me there."
[41:24] And we all start talking about heaven,
[41:27] heaven, heaven. The place that God has
[41:29] prepared for you. What will it be like?
[41:31] And in the message, the future home of
[41:35] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[41:36] bride, brother Brandham says, "Oh, what
[41:38] will it look like?" Did you ever think
[41:41] now, bride, what what it will look like?
[41:44] It is prepared and designed by the
[41:47] divine architect.
[41:49] What will that city look like? Now,
[41:51] we're going to talk about it for a few
[41:53] minutes. The divine architect has
[41:54] prepared it, designed it, and look, he
[41:57] has designed it with tender hands for
[41:59] his beloved bride. what's it going to
[42:02] look like? And we're all like, "Yeah,
[42:04] what?" And he says, "Could you imagine a
[42:07] man marrying a wife that's able? How he
[42:11] builds and puts every little thing just
[42:14] exactly to her touch,
[42:17] just what she would like."
[42:20] Amen.
[42:21] Now the divine architect has designed
[42:24] the new city where he will live with his
[42:27] bride just to her touch.
[42:39] So it's going to be
[42:43] just touchscreen iPads and phones
[42:46] everywhere.
[42:50] I remember when the iPhone came out and
[42:52] I thought, "Oh, that look at there just
[42:54] to her touch." You know, it's
[42:56] ridiculous. What a ripoff.
[43:05] He's prepared it for you.
[43:09] He's prepared this table in the presence
[43:12] of your enemies
[43:15] and anointed your head with oil. It's
[43:17] for you.
[43:20] just for you.
[43:27] Now what gave me the inspiration to this
[43:30] servant to this sermon servant service
[43:34] sermon
[43:36] was I was reading the book of Jonah and
[43:42] there's only four chapters this short
[43:43] book
[43:46] um
[43:48] and you know you start thinking about
[43:50] the things that God has prepared for you
[43:52] and and the good things that God has in
[43:55] in preparation for you and and and we
[43:58] and we get all bubbly and we you know we
[44:00] just really enjoy that.
[44:05] But there's something else that we have
[44:06] to look at and that's called reality.
[44:10] And uh you know, my father-in-law always
[44:13] says
[44:15] uh you know, before we start talking
[44:17] about the buy and buy, we're still
[44:20] living in the nasty now and now.
[44:24] And
[44:26] as I was reading in the book of Jonah,
[44:29] once again, our good friend, brother Dr.
[44:32] Scoffield has highlighted some things
[44:35] that are really nice, and I want to
[44:36] share them with you. And I want to read
[44:39] Jonah chapter 1 verse 17 and then jump
[44:42] over to chapter 4 and read verses 6
[44:44] through8. And I've got it here for for
[44:46] us all to read together. I want you uh
[44:49] Dr. Scoffield notice notes four things
[44:52] that prepared
[44:54] in the book of Jonah. And I want to show
[44:57] those four things that God prepared. So
[44:59] verse 17, now the Lord had prepared a
[45:02] great fish to swallow up Jonah. And
[45:05] Jonah was in the belly of the fish three
[45:07] days and three nights. So the first
[45:09] thing we see is this great fish that God
[45:12] has prepared to swallow Jonah. The next
[45:16] we go to verse six 6-8. And the Lord God
[45:20] prepared a gourd and made it to come up
[45:24] over Jonah that it might be a shadow
[45:26] over his head to deliver him from his
[45:28] grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of
[45:32] the gourd.
[45:34] But God prepared a worm when the morning
[45:37] rose the next day and it smoked the
[45:39] gourd that it withered. And it came to
[45:41] pass when the sun did arise that God
[45:44] prepared a vehement east wind. And the
[45:48] sun beat upon the head of Jonah that he
[45:50] fainted and wished in himself to die and
[45:54] said, "It is better for me to die than
[45:57] to live."
[46:01] So we know the story of Jonah and we
[46:04] realize that God
[46:07] had had
[46:09] desired there was the city of Nineveh
[46:13] and this was a gentile city. these were
[46:15] gentile people and Jonah being a an an
[46:17] Israelite a Hebrew uh
[46:22] wanted nothing to do with those
[46:24] heathens, filthy Gentiles.
[46:28] And but God says, "I need you to go and
[46:30] to preach to them." Because that's
[46:33] remember God uses men. Those are the
[46:35] vessels that God uses. He could have
[46:37] used something else, but God chose men
[46:39] to use. He and and he prepared men
[46:45] to help prepare the people. So he's
[46:48] prepared Jonah and he says, "I need you
[46:50] to go to Nineveh and I need you to
[46:52] preach to the people of Nineveh
[46:54] repentance to turn away from this way of
[46:58] life that they're going and to turn to
[47:00] the one true and living God."
[47:03] Jonah says, "I don't want to do it." So
[47:05] he says, "I'm taking a different boat
[47:07] going a different way." God says, "No
[47:09] problem. I prepared a fish."
[47:12] God prepared a fish knowing
[47:16] Jonah and his mistakes and his
[47:21] own his his his smart how smart he was
[47:25] his intellect.
[47:27] God was a little bit smarter. Prepared a
[47:29] fish.
[47:31] And God prepared this fish. And while in
[47:34] the belly of this fish, God Jonah
[47:36] remembers a promise that if anybody
[47:40] would turn toward the temple of God and
[47:43] would cry out and would repent and ask
[47:46] anything of God, God would give it to
[47:48] them. So Jonah positions himself in the
[47:51] belly of the whale, knowing the word of
[47:53] God and knowing the promises of God are
[47:56] sure. They're true. And he holds on to
[47:59] that because that's what you do when
[48:01] you're in a dis desperate situation.
[48:05] It's unfortunate that it takes
[48:07] desperation for a lot of times for us to
[48:10] get to that point, but it works.
[48:14] That's right. And so then Jonah
[48:19] comes up and he heads his way over to
[48:21] Nineveh and he preaches to the people of
[48:23] Nineveh. And they and and then the
[48:26] instrument that God used was so good.
[48:30] Hallelujah. That the people said, "We
[48:32] repent.
[48:34] His words are true. We believe him." And
[48:37] they repent and they give their hearts
[48:39] to God and God is pleased. And Noah goes
[48:41] up on a hill or Jonah, I keep saying
[48:44] Noah. Jonah goes up on a hill and he's
[48:46] weary after the the job that God gave
[48:49] him. He's weary. So God prepares a gourd
[48:54] to give Jonah
[48:56] reprieve.
[48:59] Jonah is so grateful for the blessings
[49:02] of God.
[49:08] So grateful
[49:10] for the cool shade.
[49:12] When you go and you read or listen to
[49:16] the restoration of the bride tree,
[49:17] brother Brandham says the leaves of the
[49:19] tree are for you to cool down,
[49:23] to have fellowship under. And he even
[49:26] says that it's the Pentecostal blessings
[49:28] of clapping your hands and the music and
[49:30] the shouting and the joy. That's what
[49:33] the shade is for.
[49:36] It's for fellowship. And and Jonah's so
[49:38] thankful for it. But God prepares a worm
[49:44] to eat up the shade.
[49:49] And then he prepares an east wind to
[49:53] vehematly blow and the sun to beat down
[49:56] on Jonah.
[49:59] And Jonah's so mad. I wish I was dead. I
[50:03] wish somebody would just I'd be better
[50:05] off dead. Would I'd be better off.
[50:11] And God says, "Jonah,
[50:16] did you prepare the gourd? Did you grow
[50:19] the gourd?" "No,
[50:23] Jonah, did
[50:26] did you grow did you create the worm to
[50:29] eat that?" "No, I didn't do that." He
[50:31] says, "Look, Jonah,
[50:37] those people are my people. I desired
[50:42] I was I desired that they would
[50:46] receive repentance and the word of the
[50:48] Lord. I desired that
[50:54] and you're upset about it and you didn't
[50:57] have nothing to do with this
[51:00] and we see these things that God
[51:02] prepares
[51:05] that it's God's preparing
[51:19] We say, "Wow, that's really neat, those
[51:21] four things." But the whole story of
[51:24] Jonah
[51:26] is God preparing Jonah.
[51:34] and God preparing a people.
[51:38] It's God doing the preparing. And so we
[51:41] say, "Oh, praise God for him preparing a
[51:45] fish." That when we're going the wrong
[51:47] way, God's got a a way for us to go
[51:50] around. Really?
[51:53] When you're in the belly of the fish,
[51:55] are you like, "Oh, thank God for this."
[51:59] No.
[52:03] But then you'll get a little shade and
[52:05] it's it's all oh God is so good. He just
[52:10] he blesses us and I tell you we're
[52:12] blessed above everybody. The the just
[52:14] we're just so blessed above every and
[52:17] then the winds beat and you're out there
[52:20] and believe me when I tell you this as a
[52:22] landscaper. You're out there and your
[52:24] job is to dig a ditch and the wind is
[52:26] blowing and you're throwing the dirt and
[52:28] the wind is blowing it right back in
[52:30] your eyeballs
[52:32] and you're like
[52:39] the wind.
[52:43] I hate the wind.
[52:48] Hallelujah.
[52:53] Brother Brandham said, "You know, God
[52:56] sends wind to shake the trees to loosen
[53:00] the roots so the roots will go deeper."
[53:06] And then you're like,
[53:08] "Where's my foot?"
[53:11] Like,
[53:14] we love it that God is preparing a place
[53:17] for us. We love that. Hallelujah.
[53:21] We love it that God has prepared men
[53:25] to speak through to help us. Hallelujah.
[53:28] We love that.
[53:30] We love the ultimate picture of what we
[53:35] will be. We love that. We love that God
[53:39] has prepared that and that he's ordained
[53:41] that that uh uh you know, he's prepared
[53:45] our footsteps and he's ordered them and
[53:47] we love that. We love that. But when
[53:50] we're in it,
[53:54] we have to recognize God prepared this.
[54:00] That even the trials, God prepared
[54:03] those.
[54:15] And
[54:20] Look,
[54:22] most of the time I'm sitting right back
[54:24] there. Okay? So if I know a lot of times
[54:27] it's this idea for like yeah yeah yeah
[54:29] get up there and say those words and and
[54:31] and
[54:33] you know and point the fingers
[54:36] but I promise you I feel like you feel
[54:41] like
[54:43] this so easy to talk about but I know
[54:47] what's coming tomorrow
[54:50] and it's like oh God please make this
[54:54] alive and applicable.
[55:01] So,
[55:02] I'm closing with this. And when I say
[55:05] closing, you know, so I don't have to,
[55:08] you're like, "Oo, good. Two minutes."
[55:12] So, please don't get mad at me.
[55:16] I don't know if you've seen this or not.
[55:17] Brother Brandham, Brother Brandham,
[55:20] Brother Eddie Biscll, uh there's a video
[55:23] or a couple videos on YouTube from a
[55:25] different churches where brother Eddie
[55:27] is uh talking about the brown bear, the
[55:30] vision of the brown bear. Has how many
[55:32] how many know what I'm talking about?
[55:34] Okay. So, so I would say at least half.
[55:36] I would say half. Okay. So, Brother
[55:39] Brandham, you know, he has this vision.
[55:41] I say you know, maybe you don't know.
[55:43] Brother Brandon has a vision of a a
[55:46] silver tip grizzly that he's going to
[55:47] kill. 9- foot silver tip grizzly that
[55:49] he's going to kill and a 42inch caribou
[55:53] that he's going to kill. And he does it.
[55:55] Boom. He goes up to Canada and brother
[55:56] Eddie Biscll uh is with him and and some
[55:59] other brothers and and in the vision,
[56:01] Brother Brandham says, you know, I see
[56:02] my hand on it. I can see my hand. I can
[56:05] see the the span and the I can see I see
[56:08] 42 in with for this caribou and I see
[56:10] the silver tip grizzly. All of this
[56:12] happening at the same time and these
[56:14] brothers are up hunting with brother
[56:15] Brandon. They're like, "Well, he he
[56:16] kills the I think he kills the caribou
[56:18] first." And they're like, "Okay, well,
[56:19] Brother Brandham, you said you said
[56:21] there was going to be this bear like
[56:23] with it." But I'm looking around. I
[56:25] could see everywhere. I'm up on this
[56:26] vista. There ain't no bear around here.
[56:28] He's like, "Hey, do you believe that
[56:30] when it's thus sayeth the Lord, it will
[56:32] be th I believe. I believe I believe,
[56:34] brother, I believe. I believe." Sure
[56:36] enough, boom, here comes this bear.
[56:38] Boom. Here's there's bear. He goes, "But
[56:40] you know there was this in in the vision
[56:42] I saw this this somebody with a green
[56:44] checkered shirt on in there and they're
[56:46] like that. Well, none of us have that."
[56:47] And brother Eddie Biscoll looks down and
[56:49] he's got this green checkered shirt that
[56:51] he didn't know. His wife had packed it
[56:54] for him just in case. And he didn't even
[56:57] realize he put it on, but he was like,
[56:59] "Yeah, none of us have a green checkered
[57:00] shirt." And he looks down. He's got this
[57:02] green checker shirt because we men don't
[57:03] even care what we look like. Our wives
[57:05] dress us. They pick out the outfits we
[57:08] wear. And that's what brother Eddie did
[57:09] was he put on this shirt that his wife
[57:11] gave him. Good thing. And there it is.
[57:13] Boom. Fulfilled. Okay. But then he says
[57:15] later, I saw another vision of a bear
[57:18] almost twice that size of that silver
[57:20] tip that I'm going to kill. And he says
[57:22] in May of 1962, he says, I saw this
[57:25] bear. It will happen. It'll happen. It's
[57:28] going to happen. Like it will it will
[57:29] be. It will be.
[57:32] And and and so then uh we you you're
[57:36] going and you're you know it's like 1999
[57:39] or whatever. I'm just making up a date
[57:40] like I'm going to the den room and I'm
[57:42] looking for this brown huge grizzly and
[57:44] I'm not seeing it and you know where's
[57:46] that brown I remember he talked about a
[57:48] brown bear you know and I'm thinking
[57:49] like I I remember brother talking about
[57:51] another bear some other bear. Where's
[57:53] that bear? Nothing. And and I you know
[57:56] it comes and it goes and you you realize
[57:58] oh yeah there was a bear. What happened
[58:00] to that? Well, then these critics come
[58:02] along and they create this website to
[58:03] disprove everything brother Bram said so
[58:05] that you don't believe he's a prophet
[58:06] and you're going to have I've got proof
[58:08] and you're going to believe it and it's
[58:09] going to blow you out of the water and
[58:10] you'll never follow this message again.
[58:13] And there that's one of the things.
[58:15] Well, where's that brown bear? Never
[58:16] happened. There was no brown bear. So,
[58:18] brother Eddie Biscll says, "Okay, I was
[58:21] there and I'm going to tell you what
[58:23] happened."
[58:25] So he takes us to this
[58:28] the this message and and we'll read it
[58:30] but um it's in countdown in 1962. This
[58:35] is after the hunt brother Brandon but I
[58:38] won't read that yet. But I want to tell
[58:40] you what in the video this is what
[58:42] brother Eddie So you have to believe
[58:44] brother Eddie now and I do
[58:48] he said he's on that hunt and he said
[58:51] they're that brother Eddie, brother
[58:54] Billy Paul and Blaine Southwick are the
[58:58] young guys and then there's brother Bud
[59:00] Southwick and brother Brandham and
[59:02] they're the older guys and brother Bud
[59:04] had angina so he struggled to do a lot
[59:07] of uh hikes and stuff because of his
[59:10] condition. So he they get to this place
[59:14] and brother Bud says, "Blaine, you and
[59:17] you take Eddie and Billy Paul and you
[59:20] guys go up this way and me and brother
[59:22] Brandham are going to go up this way."
[59:24] So those of you that have seen this,
[59:27] just bear with me because there was
[59:28] people that haven't seen this. Okay. So
[59:31] he
[59:33] So they go up and and the boys go up.
[59:35] They said they go up this ridge and
[59:37] they're hiding behind these little
[59:38] willow bushes and they said across this
[59:41] ridge
[59:43] they said uh brother Eddie says this
[59:45] bear comes down and he goes I talked
[59:48] with brother Blaine who who guides and
[59:51] hunts gri or hunts bears all the time.
[59:54] He said he'd never seen a bear like that
[59:58] and that big
[1:00:00] it being just a brown bear. Not like a
[1:00:02] Kodiak but a brown bear. And he said it
[1:00:05] had this gold like wheat gold ripe wheat
[1:00:09] gold band that came down from the back
[1:00:11] of his hump down and in front of him. He
[1:00:14] said, "I've never seen a bear like
[1:00:15] this." And his bears turning over rocks
[1:00:17] to look for berries and roots to eat.
[1:00:20] And he said, "And they're across and and
[1:00:22] the boys Blaine and and brother Billy
[1:00:24] Paul are telling brother Eddie, shoot
[1:00:26] it. Shoot the bear." He's like, "No, I'm
[1:00:28] not going to shoot. Brother Brandon
[1:00:30] hasn't even shot. Hasn't even got a shot
[1:00:32] off. I'm not going to shoot it." And
[1:00:33] they keep telling like shoot it. You
[1:00:35] know, you can imagine young guys, that's
[1:00:38] just what we did. Shoot the thing, man.
[1:00:41] He's like, "No, I'm not going to shoot
[1:00:43] it. I want Brother Brandon to shoot it."
[1:00:45] He said, "And the bear is like sniffing
[1:00:47] and said all of a sudden it wins him and
[1:00:49] it looks right at him like it, you know,
[1:00:51] they don't see good, but they're smells
[1:00:52] really good and it wins them and it like
[1:00:55] dialed on where they're at." And then it
[1:00:58] turns around and like just goes up and
[1:01:01] over this mountain and it's gone. They
[1:01:03] go back to the camp
[1:01:06] and they're telling brother Brandon, "We
[1:01:08] saw this bear. It's massive." Blah blah
[1:01:10] blah. They're telling them all about it.
[1:01:12] And he said that night it starts raining
[1:01:15] and he said, "And then it rained nonstop
[1:01:17] on and off but but never clear like it
[1:01:20] rained steady and then heavy and steady
[1:01:22] and heavy for four days. like no
[1:01:26] sunlight, just rain four days, just
[1:01:29] soggy.
[1:01:31] And
[1:01:33] and then brother Bud Southwick comes to
[1:01:37] Brother Eddie at one point and Brother
[1:01:38] Eddie's like 27, 28 years old, so he's a
[1:01:41] young guy, but Brother Bud goes,
[1:01:43] "Brother Brandon wants to go home." And
[1:01:46] brother Eddie like goes to Brother
[1:01:47] Brandon, he's like, "What?
[1:01:50] You kidding me? Like you haven't even
[1:01:53] shot a shot yet. Like you can't go home.
[1:01:55] home or just But he's like, "I can come
[1:01:58] back next year, you know, cuz then I can
[1:02:00] come back and hunt next year."
[1:02:03] He's like, he starts doing the math.
[1:02:05] He's like, "Yeah, I get it." Like
[1:02:06] they've all got cabin fever because
[1:02:07] they've been stuck in this wall tent,
[1:02:09] you know, for four days with each other.
[1:02:11] And that gets rough
[1:02:15] and and he's like, "Yeah, brother
[1:02:17] Brandon, by the time it's over, he'd be
[1:02:19] gone from his family two weeks. So, it
[1:02:21] makes sense. He wants to go home." So
[1:02:23] they're packing up, getting ready to go,
[1:02:26] and brother Brandham goes, "Uh, Brother
[1:02:27] Bud, how much longer we got?" And he's
[1:02:29] like, "Oh, you got all kinds of time.
[1:02:30] It's going to take us hours to get
[1:02:32] packed up on the horses and get out of
[1:02:35] here. You got all kinds of time." So,
[1:02:37] Brother Brandham's like, "Where'd you
[1:02:38] guys say you saw that bear?" And brother
[1:02:40] Eddie's like, "Oh, you just go up this
[1:02:41] way and we're up on that first bench."
[1:02:43] And so, Brother Brandham takes off,
[1:02:46] takes his rifle, goes through the
[1:02:47] willows, and he's off.
[1:02:49] said he comes back and he said, "Brother
[1:02:52] Eddie's sitting on the horse and he
[1:02:54] said, "Brother Brandon came up and stood
[1:02:56] by him and he said, "Brother Ed, I'm the
[1:03:01] Jonah in this group."
[1:03:05] He said, "There's only two times I know
[1:03:08] I've disobeyed a vision. The one was
[1:03:10] when I went with those ministers in
[1:03:12] Africa when I shouldn't have and he got
[1:03:15] real sick. got that amieba, got really
[1:03:18] sick and almost died. And he said, "And
[1:03:20] this is only the second time I know of
[1:03:23] that I've disobeyed a vision." He said,
[1:03:26] "I'm the Jonah in this group." He said,
[1:03:28] "But," and he said, he pointed up and he
[1:03:31] said, "It's going to be okay. Uh,
[1:03:35] it's it's all it's all good or it's all
[1:03:37] going to be okay." And he said, "And
[1:03:40] we'll and to show you, we'll ride out of
[1:03:43] here dry."
[1:03:45] Brother Eddie was like, "You, that was
[1:03:47] the most unbelievable thing you could
[1:03:49] hear
[1:03:50] after it had been raining for four days
[1:03:53] straight." Now, we in Arizona are like,
[1:03:55] "What?
[1:03:56] We don't get it." But four days,
[1:03:59] nonstop. So, Brother Eddie said it was
[1:04:02] soggy, soggy, soaked, soggy, wet.
[1:04:07] Again, I don't know what that even
[1:04:08] means. I'm a sunshine baby,
[1:04:13] but I get it. four days of rain. That's
[1:04:16] like death to Arizonans. And so he's
[1:04:19] like,
[1:04:21] he was like, I couldn't believe he said
[1:04:23] that, but
[1:04:24] you know, he's like, you hear when you
[1:04:26] were with brother Brandham stuff,
[1:04:28] supernatural stuff happens all the time.
[1:04:30] He goes, but I wasn't thinking of
[1:04:31] visions or anything like that. That that
[1:04:33] wasn't they didn't know he didn't know
[1:04:34] about all that. He didn't know all about
[1:04:37] the the vision of the bear and stuff. He
[1:04:38] knew about visions and all that.
[1:04:41] So he said that he sit on the horse and
[1:04:42] he said within a little bit of time a
[1:04:44] warm puff of air comes around and then
[1:04:47] he's like, "Oh, that felt good." Then a
[1:04:49] little while later it was just a little
[1:04:50] bit of air current, a little bit warmer,
[1:04:52] warmer. He said and the next thing he
[1:04:53] knows there's this big beam of sunlight
[1:04:56] coming through the clouds. He said he
[1:04:57] looks up and there's a big hole in the
[1:04:59] sky, blue sky, first blue sky he'd seen
[1:05:02] in four days. And he said after a while
[1:05:05] it just opened up. And he goes, "By the
[1:05:07] time we left," he goes, "By the time the
[1:05:09] horses took their first step out, there
[1:05:12] was nothing but blue sky and I was I
[1:05:16] rode out of there in a short sleeve,
[1:05:19] we were dry." And he said, "If it w if I
[1:05:22] wouldn't have ridden out of there dry, I
[1:05:24] wouldn't be standing here today." In
[1:05:26] other words, he be a false prophet. Like
[1:05:29] that, why would I believe him? He's a
[1:05:32] liar. But he wasn't. He told the truth.
[1:05:36] So I want to read you now in countdown
[1:05:39] in September 1962. This is right after
[1:05:41] the hunt. Brother Brandham, these are
[1:05:43] the words he says
[1:05:46] right after that hunt says so I in these
[1:05:50] 30 going on 32 years of ministry I've
[1:05:54] tried to stay true to the word.
[1:05:57] I don't know of one thing I've ever had
[1:06:00] to alter on because I just read it out
[1:06:02] of the Bible. Said just what the Bible
[1:06:06] said and let it go like that. And so I
[1:06:10] haven't had to take back or rearrange
[1:06:14] because I just said it the way that the
[1:06:16] Bible says it. And I find out if God has
[1:06:20] spoken anything, then we must go with
[1:06:23] that word in order to make it be
[1:06:26] fulfilled.
[1:06:27] When we see that, as I told you last
[1:06:29] night of a vision just recently, see
[1:06:31] that it I had to be there and warning to
[1:06:35] be there and telling me six months
[1:06:38] before to be on that spot and stand
[1:06:41] there and saying go down there three
[1:06:44] times with them. Brother be brother
[1:06:47] Eddie says I was the them, you know, me,
[1:06:51] Billy Paul and Blaine. and I just walked
[1:06:54] on with the other men and the vision
[1:06:58] passed right through exactly God's part
[1:07:03] and I was left standing. So, we want to
[1:07:07] remember,
[1:07:09] you've got to stay on the word. Just
[1:07:12] stay right with the word and where the
[1:07:16] word leads, you go right with the word
[1:07:20] and it'll bring you out. All right. I'm
[1:07:23] sure.
[1:07:35] And I think about that
[1:07:45] and it causes me to realize that God
[1:07:48] could even allow a vision
[1:07:52] and show exactly how the vision's going
[1:07:54] to happen and God will do his part of
[1:07:58] that. uh you still are able or I say you
[1:08:01] still certainly in this case we see
[1:08:04] brother Brandham was able to by not
[1:08:07] following through with his part miss the
[1:08:11] outcome
[1:08:13] God bring bring the bear you know the
[1:08:16] bear existed and bring the bear but he
[1:08:19] wasn't there to fulfill his part by not
[1:08:22] following through and when I hear that I
[1:08:25] know you're thinking exactly like I'm
[1:08:27] thinking right now is that oh God,
[1:08:34] you've given us your word. You've gi you
[1:08:36] you you you you've
[1:08:39] laid out instructions for us and a and a
[1:08:42] road mapap and and and
[1:08:47] God, we know you're faithful. We know
[1:08:50] that. But Lord, teach me to be faithful.
[1:09:00] so that I can fulfill my part. Whatever
[1:09:03] that is. It's not like we have, you
[1:09:06] know, the instructions written out here
[1:09:08] like, you know, this is your next step
[1:09:10] when you wake up tomorrow. It's by faith
[1:09:13] that we're operating. But but but faith
[1:09:16] is trust knowing because God has proved
[1:09:20] himself over and over and over again. So
[1:09:23] then it's it's as David as a sheep
[1:09:27] saying, "Though that he sets this table
[1:09:30] in the presence, I won't fear. Though I
[1:09:33] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:09:34] death, I won't fear for I know he's with
[1:09:38] me.
[1:09:39] I know he's with me. And if Lord, if I'm
[1:09:44] so stupid and I'm so insensitive to the
[1:09:48] leadership of your spirit, God, would
[1:09:51] you be merciful enough to prepare a way
[1:09:56] like Jonah, prepare a fish or or
[1:09:58] whatever the circumstances are? And I
[1:10:01] realize that when we pray that, when
[1:10:02] we're asking God that,
[1:10:08] then when we're when we come through the
[1:10:10] trial, when we come through the thing
[1:10:12] that is set before us, and we realize
[1:10:17] here we were like Jonah, kicking the
[1:10:20] dirt and cursing the wind and the and
[1:10:22] the worm that eats the gourd, and then
[1:10:24] realizing, oh man,
[1:10:27] that was God the whole time.
[1:10:32] That was God in all of that.
[1:10:36] And I thought it was just bad luck. Or,
[1:10:39] you know, a lot of times we give the
[1:10:41] devil credit where we shouldn't. That
[1:10:43] was the devil. The devil did that. The
[1:10:45] devil made them do that. And it's like,
[1:10:47] ah, sometimes,
[1:10:50] you know, I think it's just you,
[1:10:53] you know, like don't don't give the
[1:10:55] credit credit to the devil. like you
[1:10:57] know the devil's like thanks for the
[1:10:59] credit but uh
[1:11:01] man that one's all you on that one buddy
[1:11:04] but thanks
[1:11:07] I just I'm like Lord please please God
[1:11:15] you you've you've been you've been more
[1:11:18] than gracious to us you've been more
[1:11:20] than good to us it's by by by by
[1:11:25] allowing ing a a prophet of that caliber
[1:11:28] to come across and enter our homes,
[1:11:32] that voice to come into our homes and
[1:11:34] and and and and allow us to read the
[1:11:37] books or whatever it is. It's like, God,
[1:11:40] you
[1:11:42] please,
[1:11:44] I don't want to let you down as a
[1:11:46] believer.
[1:11:49] I I I want to be a faithful son. I want
[1:11:54] I know
[1:11:56] you feel the same way. It's
[1:12:02] like, God, I believe you've got good
[1:12:04] things prepared, but whatever
[1:12:07] whatever trials you have prepared, I
[1:12:10] want to be an overcomer.
[1:12:20] Let's stand together. The musicians
[1:12:22] would come.
[1:12:27] I want to pray with you. And I pray,
[1:12:30] this is my prayer every time that I'm
[1:12:32] afforded an opportunity to come and to
[1:12:35] speak before you.
[1:12:40] This is my prayer
[1:12:43] is that we can take these things,
[1:12:47] not the things that I said, but the
[1:12:48] things that we see in the word of God
[1:12:50] and and and we can take them to lunch
[1:12:53] with us.
[1:12:57] And we can chew on it while we're
[1:12:59] chewing our burgers. We can chew on
[1:13:01] these thoughts in in our hearts. And
[1:13:05] when we get home
[1:13:09] and it and when we see when something
[1:13:12] presents itself, when a trial presents
[1:13:14] itself, when a when a struggle presents
[1:13:17] itself, when a when something comes
[1:13:20] within our home, amongst our family,
[1:13:25] that God will quicken these these things
[1:13:28] to our to our minds, to our hearts, that
[1:13:31] we will be able to say those weren't
[1:13:34] just words. There's something real in
[1:13:36] that
[1:13:40] and that maybe God would give somebody a
[1:13:44] mama and daddy
[1:13:46] child in the home will give them wisdom
[1:13:50] like Solomon or will give them
[1:13:52] discernment
[1:13:54] to know hey God is in this
[1:13:59] God is in this and he'll take us through
[1:14:02] this or he'll take us around it or he'll
[1:14:05] take us over it or under it. But God is
[1:14:08] in this. Let's not fly off the handle.
[1:14:12] Let's not
[1:14:15] let's not try to figure this out even on
[1:14:17] our own.
[1:14:20] Let's go to God and let's see if we
[1:14:23] can't find what God's desire is so that
[1:14:26] we don't miss it.
[1:14:29] We don't blow it and and go, "Well, God
[1:14:31] did his part, but I really ruined that."
[1:14:38] That's my prayer. That's my prayer every
[1:14:40] time is that this becomes real in our
[1:14:43] lives, in our workplaces, in our homes,
[1:14:47] at lunch with each other, that we could
[1:14:49] encourage each other, not with words,
[1:14:58] but with the moving of the spirit of
[1:15:00] God.
[1:15:02] Let's pray together, will you? Heavenly
[1:15:05] Father,
[1:15:07] Lord, we're so thankful, God, for your
[1:15:09] word.
[1:15:11] God, we're so thankful for this message.
[1:15:12] And God, we're so thankful, God, for the
[1:15:15] men that you've sent in our lives and
[1:15:17] the men and women, Lord.
[1:15:22] God, I know that
[1:15:28] Lord, the testimony of my own mother has
[1:15:30] helped shape my life.
[1:15:33] I'm so thankful for that.
[1:15:36] Lord, we
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:40] we don't want to just focus on
[1:15:43] on the flashy things and the good things
[1:15:45] and just all the good times, but God,
[1:15:48] reality hits us.
[1:15:52] And Lord, there's there's real trials
[1:15:54] and there's a real enemy who would
[1:15:56] desire to sift us.
[1:16:00] God, when that happens, when those
[1:16:02] trials come, trials that you have seen
[1:16:05] fit through your
[1:16:07] wisdom
[1:16:10] to come into our lives. Lord, our
[1:16:13] prayer, my prayer, Lord, for these my
[1:16:16] brothers and my sisters, my friends here
[1:16:20] is that God, you would help us, Lord, to
[1:16:22] be sensitive to your the moving of your
[1:16:25] spirit, that we could be quiet, to
[1:16:27] listen, to know when you're speaking to
[1:16:30] us, to know how to handle something. And
[1:16:32] God, when we don't hear anything, God,
[1:16:35] when we don't feel any certain move, I
[1:16:38] pray God that
[1:16:40] Lord, you would just allow us, Lord,
[1:16:44] that faith that we have, that trust we
[1:16:46] have in you would allow us to take the
[1:16:48] next step. And Lord, we want to do it
[1:16:50] prayerfully and cautiously because we
[1:16:53] want it to be in your perfect will. Not
[1:16:55] in a permissive and not in our own will,
[1:16:58] but God, we want it to be in your
[1:17:00] perfect will. So God, I'm asking that
[1:17:02] you would direct us. God, I believe that
[1:17:04] that is your full intent, that you've
[1:17:07] given us the tools to do it, the ability
[1:17:11] to do it. I just pray Lord that you
[1:17:13] would help us as believers that we would
[1:17:15] mature that we wouldn't just remain the
[1:17:18] same and we wouldn't just rely upon the
[1:17:20] things we have but that God you would
[1:17:22] actually have preeminence to change our
[1:17:26] lives to be able to as we get older
[1:17:29] maybe we get stubborn maybe we get set
[1:17:32] in our ways but God I feel like it's
[1:17:35] such a a a dishonoring
[1:17:38] uh uh proverb to say that that an old
[1:17:41] dog can't learn new tricks, God. If I'm
[1:17:44] an old dog, Lord, help me, God, to be
[1:17:48] teachable.
[1:17:51] Lord, you could change me that my
[1:17:54] children could say, "Wow, God has really
[1:17:56] changed dad. God has really made him
[1:18:00] different. He's sure helped him out."
[1:18:02] [Music]
[1:18:04] Lord, that's my desire is that until
[1:18:06] that day that you call us home, that
[1:18:09] Lord, we would be moldable.
[1:18:12] We would be in your hands and that we
[1:18:14] you would be so pleased to shape us into
[1:18:18] what you want us to be. Oh God, grant
[1:18:22] it.
[1:18:24] Grant it, Lord. We ask in Jesus Christ's
[1:18:28] name. Amen. Amen. Sing this song with
[1:18:31] me. The goodness of God.
