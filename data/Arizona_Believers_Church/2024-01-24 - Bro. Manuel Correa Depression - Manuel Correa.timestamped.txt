[0:00] tonight I have a small
[0:05] thought I hope that I don't take too
[0:11] much I was talking to the brother uh
[0:14] there in the
[0:16] back when I am
[0:19] uh down uh uh not in the
[0:27] Pulpit I feel like 45 minutes is not
[0:31] that long of a
[0:36] time but when I'm on top of the pulpit
[0:39] here it it it just seems like it's hard
[0:42] the time just went
[0:44] away
[0:50] ER now this evening I want to speak over
[0:54] something that I've been meditating
[0:58] on
[1:02] and although this uh month is almost the
[1:06] first month is almost
[1:10] gone of this year and but just let me
[1:13] tell you
[1:16] something uh a few years
[1:22] back I I would uh resist from believing
[1:27] in
[1:28] depression you
[1:36] and I would have a hard time
[1:38] understanding why people would be
[1:40] depressed or maybe I didn't understand
[1:46] them even though I had already gone
[1:48] through an episode of
[1:52] that and
[1:58] depression
[2:00] it is is it's such a sickness that it's
[2:03] already uh doing this this uh in
[2:07] humanity these end
[2:14] times and it's one of the uh spirits
[2:18] that is it's really attacking
[2:23] humanity and and it's a very deceiving
[2:28] spirit
[2:32] because it is uh creeping in little by
[2:39] little and it's making uh oneself
[2:48] believe
[2:49] that uh yourself is nothing you're not
[2:53] worth
[2:54] anything not believing in
[2:58] yourself
[3:00] uh believing that no one loves
[3:05] you it is a very uh astute
[3:13] spirit and it begins to
[3:17] create or it makes us uh to
[3:21] create that
[3:24] atmosphere in our
[3:28] homes uh in our room
[3:31] at
[3:38] work so that it can become a a real
[3:41] strong
[3:43] uh in in our
[3:49] spirit now if you look at a person
[3:52] that's falling into
[3:55] depression uh if you just go into h
[4:00] room one of the first things that you
[4:04] will
[4:07] notice that that room will be completely
[4:15] dark the other
[4:18] thing it will be
[4:24] disorganized and that Spirit BEC uh be
[4:28] starts to create that atmosphere
[4:33] every Spirit has a
[4:38] personality that we should know
[4:42] ourselves our our our very
[4:46] self that it is a
[4:49] spirit that begins to separate us from
[4:52] other
[4:57] people uh I'm not a
[5:02] psychologist and I'm not against
[5:08] psychology but I believe that God has
[5:10] given us a
[5:13] message uh so
[5:17] powerful and with better
[5:20] knowledge than from any
[5:25] psychologist
[5:28] so
[5:30] so we could know every
[5:33] Spirit every
[5:38] anointing uh one time we went to a
[5:49] home and they had they had asked for
[5:52] prayer for a young lady that wanted to
[5:54] commit
[5:57] suicide and speak
[6:00] speaking to
[6:07] them I I would see that the young lady
[6:10] would avoid what we were talking
[6:19] about and normally when there's a
[6:24] depression it's because something
[6:26] happened in their
[6:28] life
[6:31] maybe a
[6:36] deception perhaps some sort of trauma
[6:40] psych uh
[6:46] psychologically and you have to go to
[6:48] the
[6:54] origin but the only thing they would say
[6:57] is that just pray for her because she
[6:59] wants to commit
[7:01] suicide yes we are going to
[7:04] pray but thanks to this
[7:07] message that has taught
[7:13] us how to go and look for that origin of
[7:17] that
[7:20] problem until I asked
[7:25] them now is there something that
[7:28] happened uh during uh the time of her in
[7:31] her
[7:34] family and they all just looked out at
[7:38] each
[7:42] other until a person finally
[7:47] spoke they she said they said yes
[7:50] somebody committed suicide in this
[7:55] home
[7:58] okay
[7:59] all right so then I've I've asked the
[8:01] young
[8:02] lady what kind of music do you listen
[8:07] to heavy
[8:14] metal uh what posters do you have in
[8:16] your
[8:20] walls and she told me uh you know about
[8:25] this
[8:28] music
[8:32] uh I asked her does your room is it
[8:37] lighted no she said
[8:44] no so then we begin to
[8:49] speak we can pray for
[8:52] you and that spirit will
[8:57] flee but if you don't change that
[9:01] atmosphere that spirit will come
[9:06] back and it's not going to come back
[9:09] just by itself
[9:16] again to begin with you have to change
[9:19] everything that you are
[9:24] doing to cast out this
[9:28] devil
[9:32] take this power that it has over
[9:37] you because
[9:40] us the Bible
[9:46] says that we are children of a God
[9:51] that's
[9:54] orderly uh God loves order
[10:00] and and the devil
[10:09] disorder and we prayed for that
[10:15] person and we recommended that she
[10:18] makees some changes in her
[10:21] life a person in
[10:24] depression just look at
[10:27] them or look at
[10:34] yourself you become and start to be a
[10:39] person that's
[10:43] disorganized little by
[10:48] little now why do I comment on
[10:52] this about two years
[10:58] ago
[11:00] I applied for uh my license as an
[11:04] instructor um for barbering school in
[11:09] Texas and as I was studying this
[11:14] course I found
[11:17] out how
[11:19] important
[11:21] is to have a
[11:27] purpose
[11:29] and normally every time there is a cycle
[11:32] that is being
[11:33] [Music]
[11:35] closed uh every time that a year is
[11:43] ending we always make plans and uh
[11:47] purposes of what we're going to do for
[11:49] the next
[11:52] year and in this course I
[11:56] learned get by
[12:00] that for
[12:05] motivation it is good to have a purpose
[12:08] for it it doesn't matter what age uh you
[12:14] have it is always good to have a purpose
[12:18] that would motivate
[12:22] us because
[12:25] depression is really something
[12:27] else now a person that's
[12:31] depressed doesn't have any purpose in
[12:34] its
[12:39] life what purpose do we have for this
[12:44] year do you have
[12:46] one you should have one it's
[12:51] good as uh children of
[12:57] God
[12:59] we we have a lot to choose from whatever
[13:02] purpose we
[13:05] want you know I went to the
[13:12] dictionary and I really love the
[13:15] definition in Spanish in the
[13:19] dictionary and it says that purpose
[13:26] is is that is is that action or
[13:29] intentions to not do
[13:34] something uh to do
[13:37] something or do or for not to do
[13:43] anything because even uh a
[13:48] purpose if you say well you know what I
[13:50] don't have any
[13:52] purpose that's a
[13:57] purpose
[13:59] because you're going to have to reject a
[14:01] lot of things in order for you not to do
[14:06] anything but but then that's going to
[14:08] take you to a state of
[14:16] depression and not having anything that
[14:19] is worthwhile in your
[14:24] life what is your purpose for this
[14:27] year
[14:32] I believe as Christian families that we
[14:34] believe in this
[14:37] message we should have a an individual
[14:41] purpose uh
[14:44] individually and as a family
[14:49] also for which we all must do
[14:53] something and that it would keep us
[14:57] United
[15:02] all of us all of us are striving for a a
[15:07] a goal in our
[15:11] life what is your
[15:20] purpose now what is your purpose in
[15:23] coming to
[15:26] church uh to do something or not do
[15:32] nothing because if you don't do
[15:38] anything is there is a prophecy that
[15:40] must be fulfilled every time you come to
[15:44] church or you you come in better or you
[15:48] exit
[15:52] worse every time you come to church that
[15:55] has to be
[15:57] fulfilled
[16:00] that's going to depend on that day that
[16:02] you're going to come to church it's
[16:04] going to be
[16:06] fulfilled what is your
[16:09] motivation what motivates
[16:15] you what is your desire for this
[16:24] year when a year begins or starts
[16:29] uh the
[16:30] purpose or
[16:34] goal at least in Spanish is some of the
[16:37] words that you hear the
[16:40] most a lot of us ask
[16:44] ourselves what is your
[16:46] purpose or in other
[16:49] words what motivates you for the next
[16:57] year
[16:59] what is it that makes you feel
[17:05] alive what is it that you desire or want
[17:08] for the next
[17:14] year A lot of times we just don't have
[17:22] anything or a lot of times it's just
[17:26] well I'm just gonna live and that's it I
[17:29] don't
[17:30] believe that if you and I are God's
[17:36] children we believe in this
[17:43] message we should have uh purposes that
[17:47] should be coming uh like is it right off
[17:52] right right away or maybe in the middle
[17:55] of the year or perhaps until the year
[17:57] it's over
[18:04] because we have a God that planned
[18:06] everything before the foundation of the
[18:12] world he didn't leave anything to see
[18:15] well see what
[18:21] happens and we are his
[18:26] children and we should take his
[18:31] example brother brandham
[18:35] said plan like you're going to live for
[18:38] a hundred
[18:42] years but live like you're going to
[18:45] encounter God
[18:53] today but at times we don't even have a
[18:57] purpose
[18:59] I believe that it would be a good
[19:02] thing
[19:09] and it would be good to
[19:12] plan a
[19:14] purpose that would motivate
[19:21] us we uh I know that sometimes we're
[19:24] going to very difficult
[19:27] times
[19:32] that at times we just don't want to do
[19:37] anything but it's right there and then
[19:39] when that purpose should come
[19:45] out I've
[19:50] noticed that one of my purposes of last
[19:56] year was
[19:59] to start doing something for my
[20:05] family and I begin to uh do services at
[20:09] my
[20:13] home and believe
[20:17] me that uh the atmosphere at my home
[20:21] really changed quite a
[20:26] bit and I we did was just get together
[20:31] uh there in the living
[20:33] room that's what we
[20:36] do I'm not saying that you should do it
[20:38] that
[20:40] way I'm just saying what and sharing
[20:43] with you what we
[20:47] do and we're beginning to uh read book
[20:52] by book of the
[20:55] Bible we read a
[21:00] chapter uh each
[21:02] one then we
[21:05] pray and that
[21:09] purpose that God permitted us to fulfill
[21:12] last
[21:14] year even my
[21:19] character it helped me to control my
[21:25] character the atmosphere at my home now
[21:28] is
[21:29] different uh a lot of tensions have gone
[21:35] away just by doing
[21:40] something it's having a purpose as a
[21:45] family a
[21:48] goal what is a
[21:53] goal it is a terminology that it's uh
[21:58] that is
[21:59] for the purpose for is to have a career
[22:03] or a or a
[22:07] goal uh the
[22:10] term uh for uh a
[22:14] purpose and or a
[22:17] go they're almost very
[22:19] similar it's the same
[22:24] thing and we should have it
[22:34] and I really like this uh quote from
[22:37] brother brandham I'm going to read a
[22:38] quote from Brother
[22:42] brandham uh on this on on the on the
[22:46] book I am the resurrection and the
[22:53] life uh last year I had really really
[22:57] beautiful experi experiences with the
[23:00] Lord but my
[23:02] goal my
[23:05] purpose
[23:08] is that after reading this quote from
[23:12] Brother
[23:13] Bram it's not to uh lean on these
[23:20] experiences uh to look for new
[23:22] experiences with God this year
[23:26] Brothers brother Bron
[23:32] says uh today uh people depend on the
[23:37] experiences that they had like 20 years
[23:46] ago how many times do we uh remember all
[23:50] these experien that we had way before
[23:53] and then we depend on those
[23:56] experiences a lot of times we have an
[23:58] experience for example on a
[24:01] Sunday and then it's it's good enough
[24:04] for
[24:05] us and then a week goes by and then two
[24:09] weeks three
[24:13] weeks and then we don't have the desire
[24:16] to keep looking for these experiences
[24:18] with the
[24:18] Lord because we already had
[24:23] one I want a better year than the
[24:26] previous year this
[24:28] year I don't want the
[24:31] devil uh play with my
[24:34] mind and take me to that uh to to be
[24:38] happy with
[24:40] that of this experience that I had uh
[24:43] the previous
[24:47] year I want new experiences this
[24:50] year and better ones with
[24:56] him
[24:58] but then if we don't even have a
[25:03] purpose if if we don't even know what we
[25:05] want we're not going to go
[25:12] there look I'm I'm I'm going to with
[25:15] with this little uh piece of quote or
[25:18] this
[25:23] book as as I read as I read it it it
[25:27] happened to me like a a
[25:36] joke uh and it relates that there there
[25:38] was a a a boy that his father was living
[25:42] with
[25:45] him and this young man had some uh some
[25:49] people were going to come and visit
[25:52] him but his father was a
[25:56] Christian
[26:01] and and this young man was always
[26:10] yelling and every time he he'd make a
[26:13] fuss about he said oh praise God glory
[26:16] be to
[26:19] God and he or he would listen to
[26:21] something he would just shout
[26:26] amen and this young man didn't want his
[26:29] friends to listen to
[26:33] that so then what he planned he said
[26:35] well I'm just going to uh send my dad to
[26:39] the second
[26:42] floor that way when uh the visitors come
[26:45] in the friends they they won't even
[26:48] listen to
[26:53] him and then I'm going to put Discovery
[26:55] Channel on him that way he won't see
[26:56] nothing religious
[27:04] and that won't motivate him to yell or
[27:06] say anything about
[27:10] religion and then in this channel it
[27:13] just so happened there were uh uh there
[27:16] there was something like about to
[27:20] see and on this program they began to
[27:26] say
[27:30] and they would say that no one had even
[27:34] gone down to the very bottom of the
[27:39] sea the brother began to
[27:41] yell glory be to
[27:44] God blessed be
[27:48] God because no one has has found my sins
[27:53] the because that's where God sent
[27:56] them
[28:00] and see that's what happens to me at
[28:04] times when I was uh uh reading this
[28:09] book I identified as a
[28:12] Christian and what I want to
[28:17] be as one of my purposes for this
[28:24] year and it says on one of these
[28:26] paragraphs of this
[28:33] book and it says on this on this book uh
[28:38] a bar a barber an instructor for for
[28:41] being a
[28:47] barber now you tell me if a Christian
[28:50] should have this characteristics of what
[28:53] it says
[28:56] here he says as my career as an
[28:59] instructor uh in in barber in being a
[29:06] barber you will find yourself in the
[29:09] role of being a
[29:15] motivator
[29:16] uh an instructor Mentor a mentor amig
[29:23] friend
[29:24] disciplin uh someone who disciplines
[29:28] paciic a
[29:30] pacifier nego
[29:35] negotiator um refere a
[29:40] referee and also to take care of someone
[29:43] or to animate
[29:46] someone then I started to
[29:51] Rejoice I I don't only have to just do
[29:53] this as an
[29:56] instructor
[30:00] I should have had this characteristics
[30:02] as a Christian for a long time
[30:05] ago we were
[30:08] called if me and you have the Holy
[30:14] Spirit that we should have these
[30:19] characteristics we should be
[30:21] pacifi we should correct things with
[30:26] love
[30:30] we should guide
[30:36] someone even if we find
[30:40] someone that doesn't have a
[30:46] motive a lot of times what a person
[30:49] might need is that for someone to listen
[30:51] to
[30:56] him
[30:58] perhaps that person just wants to be
[31:00] listened to without someone judging
[31:04] him and that's going to help him a
[31:13] lot a lot of times you need to approach
[31:16] someone and just tell him you know be a
[31:20] comfort to
[31:22] him and I'm not talking about someone uh
[31:26] that's unknown or that you don't
[31:29] know a stranger but maybe our own very
[31:37] home a lot of times our
[31:48] children I am uh
[31:54] learning to uh gain the conf confidence
[31:57] of my
[32:00] son because when he makes a
[32:05] mistake I can correct him with
[32:08] love and uh maybe chastise him or punish
[32:16] him but with
[32:19] love without me getting
[32:23] upset I'm on my way to that
[32:30] because before I was quick to just get
[32:36] upset I wouldn't pacify the
[32:40] situation I want to calm the
[32:45] situation I'm not saying that everyone
[32:47] should just run all over
[32:52] me but but have the
[32:56] knowledge to know
[32:59] when
[33:02] how I don't think it's wrong for me to
[33:04] get
[33:06] upset when when it's wrong is how I
[33:09] react when I get
[33:13] upset because brother brandham
[33:17] says that when we get
[33:21] upset it is uh the beginnings of going
[33:25] crazy or insane
[33:31] if me and you get
[33:34] upset and we don't and we lose
[33:37] control we are going towards
[33:54] Insanity says here to have a
[33:59] motivation I really love
[34:03] this because when you have a
[34:08] motivation you don't permit anxiety for
[34:13] example to take a hold of
[34:17] you you don't let
[34:25] depression
[34:28] it says to have a fruitful uh
[34:35] modification you you must find a
[34:39] need a
[34:42] goal or a specific uh something that you
[34:47] need for that
[34:50] motivation remember one
[34:55] thing
[34:59] a lot of times we're doing the death
[35:01] walk just running around in
[35:05] circles and we say that we are
[35:10] believers and that we believe this
[35:13] message but then where are you
[35:16] going uh where God wants
[35:20] to no God already told you what he
[35:25] wants
[35:27] what is it that you
[35:29] want what is your
[35:32] goal what is the
[35:49] end it says here if you feel like you
[35:53] need a personal
[35:55] motivation
[36:04] there is some things that you can do so
[36:05] you can be uh positively
[36:12] motivated one of those
[36:15] things is do things that you like to
[36:21] do and right here I ask
[36:25] myself do I like to come to
[36:35] church is it a motivation for me to come
[36:38] to
[36:44] church because if it's not then I'm
[36:47] going to exit out of here worse than
[36:49] when I came
[36:53] in another the thing that it says here
[37:01] associate yourself with people that are
[37:04] you know
[37:06] uh positive they're they're positive and
[37:10] they actually have accomplished
[37:11] something in
[37:16] life uh associate yourself with
[37:20] persons that that that have accomplished
[37:23] something in their
[37:25] life do you want me to tell to you uh
[37:28] the Christian
[37:31] way uh associate yourself with persons
[37:34] that have the Holy
[37:39] Spirit because those persons are going
[37:42] to take you to
[37:46] succeed and a lot of times that's where
[37:48] the Christian fails the Christian
[37:53] fails that we don't want to leave our
[37:56] Social
[37:59] Circle that are dragging us to places
[38:02] that we shouldn't be
[38:06] there see that's
[38:10] right uh look at
[38:13] Abraham he was not
[38:17] blessed
[38:20] until he
[38:22] left of all his Kindred Family
[38:29] now he was called out to be by
[38:34] himself but he he he he brought with him
[38:37] a
[38:39] lot no I'm not saying that you know you
[38:42] should just uh go by yourself and just
[38:45] be
[38:48] alone but I hope that God will reveal to
[38:51] you what I am trying to
[38:55] say
[39:05] now it says here another
[39:11] thing it says eliminate the I can't do
[39:16] this from your
[39:22] vocabulary that's one of those things
[39:24] that's going to help us to reach our
[39:29] goals and me myself as a Christian
[39:32] that's what I lack most and I am
[39:35] defeated of
[39:38] that because it affects the faith of the
[39:42] Christian uh
[39:45] unbelief I
[39:49] can't just eliminate
[39:53] it because it's not what you are
[39:57] are it is not for what I
[40:01] am it is who is in
[40:13] me look there's there's another one the
[40:16] next
[40:17] one it says
[40:21] change the
[40:24] desire for the desire of I'm going to do
[40:33] it and brother Bram
[40:36] says H A lot of people just uh uh don't
[40:41] uh or don't
[40:45] know misunder misunderstand a lot of
[40:50] people the
[40:52] hope uh with
[40:55] faith
[41:00] change the
[41:03] desire or the
[41:05] hope for
[41:09] Faith and you you will see how marvelous
[41:12] things will
[41:16] happen it is not the same Faith and
[41:23] Hope principal and the main
[41:30] one
[41:32] identify the main principle
[41:36] goals of your
[41:42] life what is it that you want for your
[41:47] life in
[41:50] everything what is it that we
[41:53] want what is it that you want
[41:58] what is it that you
[42:00] desire do you have a
[42:16] goal I'm going to read a
[42:25] quote a quote then I'm going to read a
[42:27] scripture I'm going to try to
[42:38] hurry there are righteous people walking
[42:41] in the light of the
[42:45] Lord that's the kind of a home that God
[42:48] can get
[42:54] into now if you're serving bring all
[42:56] kinds of
[42:58] parties and
[43:01] beer and everything that's in your
[43:04] home God will never visit you
[43:08] there that's
[43:13] right but if you got a clean a a a home
[43:17] that's cleaned up and living for
[43:23] God with the prayer and Bible
[43:29] open and a few tear stains on
[43:33] it God can visit
[43:38] you and maybe we can say
[43:42] also I don't go to parties and I don't
[43:45] drink
[43:49] beer but there is other things that we
[43:52] need to clean from our
[43:54] homes we all know know
[43:58] that
[44:00] listen listen sometimes we
[44:06] forget let's read 2
[44:10] Samuel 9
[44:25] one
[44:28] [Music]
[44:48] second
[44:49] Samuel chapter 9 verse
[44:54] one I think this should identify every
[45:03] Christian and with this scripture we
[45:05] should take out any
[45:08] depression whatever thing that is WR
[45:11] wrong that is making us feel
[45:18] bad God says in this
[45:22] manner and David
[45:24] said
[45:29] is anyone here in the house of
[45:31] Saul here in the House of Mercy for
[45:50] Jonathan is anyone here in the serf in
[45:52] the house of of of God where Saul is
[45:56] called
[45:57] siba for whom you which are called in
[46:00] David the the the king said is it you
[46:04] siba and he responded
[46:23] you yes sir the king then asked him is
[46:27] anyone still alive from Saul's family if
[46:30] so I want to show God's kindness to
[46:44] them CRA replied yes one of Jonathan's
[46:48] son is still alive he is crippled in
[46:51] both
[46:54] feet
[47:01] where is he and the King asked in loar
[47:04] Zeba told him at the home of mck son of
[47:07] Amel so David sent for him and brought
[47:10] him for mck's
[47:11] home and his name was
[47:24] meth
[47:31] his name was m and he was Jonathan's son
[47:34] and Saul's grandson when he came to
[47:37] David he bowed low to the ground in deep
[47:40] respect David said
[47:54] GRE
[48:02] Don't Be Afraid David said I intend to
[48:04] show kindness to you because of my
[48:06] promise to your father Jonathan I will
[48:08] give you all the property that once
[48:10] belonged to your grandfather saw and you
[48:12] will e here you will be with me at the
[48:15] king's
[48:21] table May soet bow respect and exclaim
[48:24] who is your servant that you should show
[48:26] such kindness to a dead dog like
[48:32] me

[48:40] him he
[48:43] was he was the son of a
[48:47] king meib said was was going to be the
[48:53] king he was the son of of a
[48:59] king maybe he wasn't treated as a son of
[49:03] a

[49:09] arrived he had mercy on
[49:13] him he called him to his
[49:17] table so he could eat everything that
[49:19] was on his
