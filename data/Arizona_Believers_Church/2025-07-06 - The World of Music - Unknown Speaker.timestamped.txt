[0:00] turn to Psalms 119 verse 133. We did use
[0:04] this scripture on Wednesday. There'll be
[0:07] a brief tie-in
[0:09] uh and then we're just going to get into
[0:11] a number of scriptures today. It's going
[0:13] to look at kind of an overview of a lot
[0:16] of different things. I don't believe
[0:17] that it's academic or just merely uh you
[0:21] know like reading the newspaper, but
[0:23] it's going to be a lot of lot of things
[0:26] to absorb. Psalms 119 verse 133. Order
[0:30] my steps in thy word and let not any
[0:33] iniquity have dominion over me. I think
[0:36] those two statements belong together.
[0:39] The desire to be ordered is so that
[0:41] there would be no power of sin, no power
[0:44] of iniquity over him. Order my steps in
[0:46] thy word and let not any iniquity have
[0:49] dominion over me. You can be seated. My
[0:54] title today is the world of music. I
[0:57] thought about titling it the most
[0:59] comprehensive, extensive, and absolute
[1:02] complete uh history of music just for
[1:06] clickbait title. Uh but we're just going
[1:08] to use the phrase the world of music.
[1:11] And I did deliberate quite a bit on how
[1:13] to title it. I think there's a lot of
[1:15] meaning in titles. I know for a lot of
[1:16] us as message believers, you can just
[1:18] mention a sermon title and it strikes
[1:20] something in your heart and you know uh
[1:23] what the scripture is, what the emphasis
[1:24] is and even some of the relationships uh
[1:27] to the day and age that we're living in.
[1:28] So I think there's a lot that goes into
[1:31] a title and I'm just using this the
[1:33] world of music. Now, if you'll turn to
[1:36] Psalms 19:E14,
[1:39] going to look at some of the internal
[1:42] things that we discussed Wednesday night
[1:44] and how that flows out into a song just
[1:47] using that phrasing. It says, "Let the
[1:48] words of my mouth and the meditation of
[1:51] my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O
[1:54] Lord, my strength and my redeemer." We
[1:56] could look at this and say that the
[1:58] order could certainly be reversed in the
[2:00] sense that whatever's in a man's heart
[2:02] is what flows out and by the things in
[2:04] his heart, that's how he speaks. And so
[2:07] it's not just the words of his mouth
[2:08] that he would be hypocritical, but that
[2:10] also the meditation of his heart be
[2:13] acceptable to the Lord who is his
[2:15] strength and his redeemer. We know what
[2:18] the words of our mouth would be in a
[2:20] very literal sense. But it meditation of
[2:22] our heart is actually in the Hebrew it
[2:24] could mean resounding music. Let this
[2:27] music in my heart. Let this uh this
[2:30] musing in my mind. My thoughts, my
[2:32] meditation be acceptable in thy sight, O
[2:35] Lord. One way of thinking about it is
[2:37] our thoughts kind of perform maybe we
[2:39] could say a soundtrack, but our musings
[2:41] form a musical score for our lives.
[2:43] There's a thought process that something
[2:45] in your mind that's going through why
[2:47] you do certain things and why you live
[2:49] your life. And you might find that
[2:50] there's a certain rhythm to it. There's
[2:52] a certain cadence and a revisiting and
[2:54] cycles and circles in the way that you
[2:56] think. So it's good to think about what
[2:58] you're thinking, but don't overthink it.
[3:01] And so in that there's a way that we
[3:03] were talking about ordering our thoughts
[3:05] because this what is what our thoughts
[3:07] give us. And what they do is they
[3:08] motivate us. They inspire us. uh it's
[3:11] what causes us to things to flow out of
[3:13] our mouth and even interaction. So he
[3:14] says our our thoughts are a resounding
[3:18] music. It's it's a song. It gives us
[3:20] energy. It inspires us. In Proverbs 15
[3:23] 28 it says, "The heart of the righteous
[3:27] studyth to answer, but the mouth of the
[3:30] wicked peth out evil things." As the
[3:32] psalmist said, "Let the words of my
[3:34] mouth be acceptable there." Now, the
[3:36] words of the wicked mouth, they just
[3:38] pour out evil things, things that God
[3:40] does not find acceptable. But the heart
[3:42] of the righteous, those that are
[3:43] pleasing to the Lord, those that are
[3:45] upright, they study. That means they
[3:47] muse, they think about, they they
[3:49] consider things to answer. And that
[3:52] answer there is not just to have a word,
[3:54] but it speaks of a rhythm, a beat. It
[3:57] speaks of something that's going to
[3:59] resound. They they do it to speak in a
[4:02] way that harmonizes.
[4:04] And so our heart should muse to sing in
[4:06] tune with God. Our heart should be
[4:08] thinking, I want to be harmonious. I
[4:10] want to work together. I want to be in
[4:11] the right melody. And so Psalms 119
[4:14] verse 133 speaks of the very same thing.
[4:17] Order my steps in thy word. And let not
[4:20] any iniquity have dominion over me. In
[4:24] order to live free from sin, in order to
[4:26] live outside of the works of the flesh
[4:28] and the influence of the world, our
[4:30] steps need to be ordered according to
[4:32] the word of God. Order there means to
[4:35] arrange or to compose. It's to direct
[4:37] direct my steps. You could even see one
[4:40] the the words of a composer who's going
[4:42] to arrange music and he's going to write
[4:45] out the the the sheet music in a certain
[4:48] way. And then when it comes time for
[4:49] that to be played, there's someone there
[4:51] who's directing, who's orchestrating. So
[4:53] there's order my steps. That's that
[4:55] stroke. It's a beat. It's that even that
[4:57] that timing. Order my timing. Order my
[5:00] stroke. Order order the way that I'm
[5:03] performing within your word of God. So
[5:06] we want to follow his beat. We want to
[5:08] follow his rhythm, his tune, his melody,
[5:10] his meter, whatever it is that we're to
[5:12] do. We want to perform our part. Music
[5:15] itself,
[5:17] as we uh used on Wednesday night, it's
[5:19] the art of combining notes. It's art of
[5:21] music is even in the phrase, the Latin
[5:23] phrase. And so, it's the art and
[5:25] technique and the skill to be able to
[5:26] combine harmony and rhythm and melody
[5:29] together. And on this subject today, the
[5:33] world of music, I want to look
[5:35] scripturally at the origins of music,
[5:37] the character of music and its different
[5:39] uses. And I believe that it should serve
[5:41] as
[5:43] um maybe an initial way of probing your
[5:46] thoughts to consider
[5:49] uh the place that music has in our lives
[5:51] and the place that it has in the world
[5:53] and how that it can be manipulated, how
[5:55] it can be used, and even how it can be
[5:56] used for God's glory. And there's a lot
[5:58] of there's a lot of power in music. In
[6:01] Job 38 4-7, this is where we're going to
[6:04] start. If I was going to do the history
[6:06] of music, a complete history of music,
[6:09] an exhaustive and complete history of
[6:11] music, then I you need to start before
[6:13] time. And so here in Job chapter 38,
[6:16] which was the oldest, they believe it to
[6:18] be the oldest written book in the in the
[6:21] Bible. Where was thou when I laid the
[6:24] foundations of the earth? It's God that
[6:26] is speaking. And so now it's in the
[6:28] Genesis in the beginning when God is
[6:30] creating by his word. He's saying,
[6:32] "Where were you?" And we could even
[6:33] phrase it this way. Where were you when
[6:36] things begin to come forth that weren't
[6:38] yet in existence? Declare if thou hast
[6:41] understanding. Who hath laid the measure
[6:43] thereof if thou knowest? Or who hath
[6:44] stretched the line upon it? Whereupon
[6:46] are the foundations thereof fastened? Or
[6:49] or who laid the cornerstone thereof?
[6:51] Now, God's not trying to make a point
[6:54] that he needs answers to this and he
[6:56] wants to know whether or not he was. But
[6:58] these are rhetorical questions to get
[7:00] Job to consider the greatness of God and
[7:02] the way that they were having their
[7:04] discussion. He says, "When the morning
[7:06] stars sang together and all the sons of
[7:09] God shouted for joy." So in the
[7:12] beginning when God be to bring forth and
[7:16] God be to create the scripture is
[7:17] expressing that there was a singing at
[7:21] that time the stars morning stars sang
[7:23] together that singing is a ringing cry
[7:26] to sing out so it isn't uh we you could
[7:29] translate it to shout or noise but it
[7:31] has a musical connotation to raise a
[7:34] sound so music is present in the very
[7:37] beginning when God begins to bring
[7:39] things forth in Isaiah
[7:42] 6:ES 1:3 it says in the year of that in
[7:45] the year that King Uzziah died I saw
[7:48] also the Lord Isaiah is expressing these
[7:50] things I saw also the Lord sitting upon
[7:53] the throne so he's having this vision in
[7:55] heaven high and lifted up and his train
[7:57] filled the temple above it stood the
[8:00] seraraphims each one had six wings with
[8:02] twain he covered his face and with twain
[8:05] he covered his feet and with twain he
[8:07] did fly and one cried unto another and
[8:12] said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
[8:14] hosts. The whole earth is full of his
[8:16] glory." Now, notice how it phrases that
[8:21] these saraphims that are there hovering
[8:24] uh by the throne and their wings are
[8:28] covering their face and their feet and
[8:29] with one they're hovering there and they
[8:32] cried to each other. So, there's these
[8:34] saraphims who are now singing to each
[8:37] other and to cry to one another. It's
[8:39] this alternate praise and the way that
[8:42] it would alternate. It has the structure
[8:43] of singing. Holy, holy. Maybe it's holy,
[8:47] holy, holy. And the other one's
[8:48] repeating and they're singing it back
[8:49] and forth. They could have been singing
[8:51] in a round. I don't know. But it kind of
[8:53] has this cadence to it, this rhythm to
[8:55] it of this alternate praise in the
[8:58] structure of a liturgy or a singing, a
[9:00] musical chant.
[9:02] Revelations 5:es 8 to10. and when he had
[9:06] taken the book, these are really
[9:08] beautiful scriptures, but we're just
[9:09] zeroing in on some very specific
[9:12] components to it. So, if you can in your
[9:14] own minds take a step back on some of
[9:15] these and recognize the context and see
[9:18] that in each one of these here
[9:20] initially, these are things that relate
[9:21] to God, very uh wonderful happenings in
[9:24] a supernatural realm. And when he had
[9:26] taken the book, the four beasts and four
[9:28] elders fell down before the lamb, having
[9:30] every one of them harps and golden vials
[9:33] full of odors, which are the prayers of
[9:35] saints. And they sung a new song. So
[9:38] every one of them had a harp. This is a
[9:41] it's associate this is the song this the
[9:43] word harp is associated with praise and
[9:45] worship. Things that are sung to God in
[9:48] heaven could even imply that musical
[9:50] instrument of a liar, something that
[9:52] could be played. They all had a harp.
[9:55] And they sung a new song, saying, Thou
[9:56] art worthy to take the book, and to open
[9:59] the seals thereof, for thou was slain,
[10:00] and hast redeemed us to God by the blood
[10:03] out of every kindred and tongue and
[10:04] people and nation, and hast made us unto
[10:06] our God, kings and priests, and we shall
[10:09] reign on the earth. Some of you may have
[10:11] sung uh songs before uh that are just
[10:14] this exact wording and they're done in a
[10:16] way that is has tone and harmony and it
[10:19] may come across more as a a chant or a
[10:22] musical uh uh just using musical notes,
[10:25] but these are it's being characterized
[10:27] as them all having harps and singing a
[10:30] song at the time that the lamb takes the
[10:33] book.
[10:36] And so worship in heaven,
[10:39] I could, if I could say this, well,
[10:41] maybe I could just say it. It seems to
[10:44] be inherently musical.
[10:47] They sang together. They shouted for
[10:49] joy.
[10:50] These elders with their harps and they
[10:52] all be to sing
[10:56] in Revelations 14:es 2 and three. And I
[10:58] heard a voice from heaven as the voice
[11:00] of many waters and as the voice of a
[11:01] great thunder. And I heard the voice of
[11:04] harpers harping with their harps. That
[11:06] seems a little bit redundant, but the
[11:09] voice of harpers harping with their
[11:10] harps. It kind of combines all the the
[11:12] conjugations of that phrase and the use
[11:15] of that root word. They're the harpers
[11:16] harping with their harps. This is
[11:18] musical. These are instruments. It
[11:20] connotates this musical worship. And
[11:22] they sung as it were a new song before
[11:25] the throne and before the four beast and
[11:27] the elders. So now it's not just the
[11:30] four beasts and the four elders that are
[11:31] associated with this worship in this
[11:34] singing and and the and the praise and
[11:36] the harping, but now there's a voice of
[11:38] harpers harping with their harps. And
[11:40] they sing a new song before the beast
[11:42] and elders and no man could learn that
[11:45] song but the 144,000 which are redeemed
[11:48] from the earth. So again, in the context
[11:50] of very great things and scriptural
[11:52] things, there are the voice of harpers
[11:54] harping with their harps. They're
[11:57] singing a new song. There's this above
[11:59] the throne or the seraraphims on the
[12:01] throne are singing back and forth one to
[12:04] another. This shows that music is in
[12:06] heaven.
[12:08] There's worship and praise, but it's not
[12:10] just worship. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It
[12:12] has some sort of it has a a musical feel
[12:15] to it. It has some sort of harmony and
[12:17] structure to it. as I believe Isaiah 6
[12:21] implies that the shouting that antifonal
[12:23] back and forth that resounding one to
[12:26] another alternate praise it's musical
[12:30] now in Ezekiel chapter 28
[12:36] as it says in Isa in Job it says the
[12:39] morning stars sang together and the sons
[12:42] of God shouted for joy so there's that
[12:44] the morning stars singing but here in
[12:46] Ezekiel 28 8:3 it's Lucifer who is
[12:50] associated with that light that morning
[12:52] star. It says thou hast been in Eden the
[12:54] garden of God. Every precious stone was
[12:57] thy covering the sardis, the topaz and
[12:59] the diamond, the burl, the onyx and the
[13:01] jasper, the sapphire, the emerald and
[13:03] the carbuncle and gold. The workmanship
[13:07] of thy tabrets and of thy pipes. The
[13:10] pipes here uh in the wording does not
[13:13] necessarily refer to an organ or an
[13:15] instrument. It speaks of a kind of a a
[13:18] place, a divot, a hole, a socket for a
[13:22] gem or a jewel to be put in. But brother
[13:24] Brandham takes the scripture, he uses
[13:25] this very scripture. He says, "Pipes or
[13:27] organs are instruments." And he he looks
[13:28] at it in the sense that it continues the
[13:31] phrasing of tab. So there's this idea
[13:33] that even if it reads to be like a
[13:35] socket, that could even imply, you know,
[13:38] even a musician wants to be in the
[13:40] pocket. And so that's even what the word
[13:42] would mean. The workmanship of thy
[13:43] tablets and thy pipes were prepared in
[13:45] thee in the day that thou was created.
[13:48] So God in creating Lucifer makes him
[13:50] very beautiful with a lot of adornment.
[13:53] And part of that adorning is musical.
[13:56] The workmanship of thy tab thy tabits.
[13:59] It doesn't say specifically what that
[14:01] might have been. It could have been tamb
[14:02] boots, brother loyal. We don't know. But
[14:04] it's a timberal or a tambourine.
[14:07] Something that's made in him to play the
[14:09] sound. It means to play the sound of the
[14:11] timal to beat. It comes from that word
[14:13] to beat to play upon to drum. And those
[14:16] who hate drums are going, "That's right,
[14:18] brother Aaron. Lucifer was a drummer."
[14:21] But it is it is the tablet speaks of a
[14:24] playing, the sound to beat, to play upon
[14:26] a drum, a tambourine or a temple. So
[14:28] Lucifer in the beginning was made
[14:30] inherently musical.
[14:32] When the sons of God were singing
[14:34] together, it implies this musical
[14:36] composition being poured forth. In
[14:39] Isaiah 14:1 again speaking of Lucifer,
[14:42] Satan, the that old serpent, the dragon,
[14:45] the pomp, thy pomp is brought down to
[14:47] the grave. I'll acknowledge again, these
[14:50] are within the context of scriptures
[14:51] that are visited frequently that we know
[14:53] very well, but I'm just trying to zero
[14:55] in on very granular part of this wherein
[14:57] these tablets were in him. Now, here it
[14:59] says, "And the noise of thy vials, the
[15:01] worm is spread under thee, and the worms
[15:03] cover thee." But the noise of thy vials,
[15:05] the vials is that harp. It's a It speaks
[15:07] of a loot or some a guitar a musical
[15:11] instrument.
[15:13] Now again, in looking at Lucifer, not
[15:16] only does he have these tablets or pipes
[15:18] and and these the the tambourine or the
[15:21] drum, but here now there's a harp,
[15:23] there's a guitar, there's some musical
[15:25] instrument that's being associated with
[15:26] him, the noise of thy musical
[15:28] instruments.
[15:31] So we can see then even in the beginning
[15:33] as we pull the curtain back and we look
[15:35] at eternity through Job and Isaiah and
[15:37] Revelation or we look in heaven through
[15:39] revelation uh we could see that there is
[15:42] also Satan nearby
[15:45] as some could say a worship leader in
[15:48] heaven.
[15:48] Right?
[15:51] Then in Genesis chapter 4
[15:54] vers 16 to uh 22 we'll just kind of
[15:57] touch through it here. It speaks of how
[15:58] Cain went out from the presence of the
[16:00] Lord. And in verse 17, it says that he
[16:03] knew his wife and conceived and bare
[16:05] Enoch. And he built a city and called
[16:07] the name of that city after his son
[16:09] Enoch. So this is the beginning of
[16:11] civilization. This is the beginning of
[16:13] man's attempts to sustain himself and to
[16:16] overcome the curse. And so science
[16:18] begins here. Science not so much in the
[16:22] uh search for knowledge, but science in
[16:24] the sense of trying to self-preserve and
[16:25] to self-discover. And so there's
[16:28] beginning a lot of uh cultivation and
[16:31] creation. Brother Brandham says a lot
[16:33] about these verses and he emphasizes
[16:35] quite a bit uh civilization, education
[16:39] and music.
[16:41] And in verse 21 it's going through the
[16:43] lineage. It says, "And his brother's
[16:44] name was Jubel. He was the father of all
[16:48] such as handle the harp and organ.
[16:51] He's the father of those who play the
[16:53] liar and pipe. the it speaks kind of
[16:55] more of string and wood instruments even
[16:59] uh he's credited with being kind of the
[17:00] inventor of musical culture to now maybe
[17:03] it's not just something that's done uh
[17:06] one one humming or one composing
[17:08] individually but now there's a an
[17:11] identity that comes he's the father he's
[17:13] the inventor he's the one that kind of
[17:14] begins to bring it together and form
[17:17] something
[17:18] as a combination of those that handle
[17:20] the harp and the organ jubel even from
[17:23] is from the Hebrew word yabal which
[17:25] means to lead or conduct. So here he is
[17:28] he's a conductor. He's a composer. He's
[17:31] one that's starting to become more
[17:33] organized with respect to music. That
[17:36] yabal even uh the conjugation of that is
[17:38] used in yobel which is a ram's horn with
[17:41] the idea of a sounding a celebratory
[17:42] sound. So it has his name itself is
[17:45] connected with music. In verse 21, it
[17:48] tells us about Tubalcane
[17:50] uh and how he began to forge and use. He
[17:53] was an alchemist and he began to forge
[17:54] metals and learn how to uh uh combine
[17:57] metals and he so he was a metal smith.
[17:59] He forged the Bible says brass and iron
[18:03] and brother Brandham in many different
[18:05] places associates that tubcane
[18:07] specifically with making instruments of
[18:10] music.
[18:12] In the early 1900s, they discovered some
[18:17] uh clay tablets are very very ancient.
[18:19] They had a it was included an ancient
[18:21] text that is very close to Hebrew. And
[18:24] I've been reading through some of it and
[18:25] it's really really really interesting.
[18:27] And a lot of the different things that
[18:29] uh you find out about very very old
[18:31] words and things that confirm things in
[18:33] scripture. And there was one in there
[18:34] who was a smith who was honored as the
[18:36] leader and builder and an artisan or the
[18:38] patron of musicians. And so Tubalcane
[18:42] was most likely combined metal work and
[18:45] music and cultural creativity and
[18:48] they're working together with family and
[18:49] jubil. They were they were uh inspiring
[18:53] more work and providing more resources
[18:56] in music. But again, we're kind of
[18:59] watching how this unfolds. This
[19:01] development of music and the instruments
[19:03] connects with Lucifer through Cain to
[19:06] humanity.
[19:09] Unable to create an original,
[19:12] Satan has to work with what God has
[19:14] already manifested, what God has already
[19:16] used. God created things within him. And
[19:19] and and in creating these things within
[19:21] him, he's now able to use and influence
[19:26] uh fallen man, this degraded humanity.
[19:29] And music is part of civilization.
[19:32] Metalwork, it's not just metal working
[19:34] in the sense that they're making
[19:35] weapons, but they're also making uh
[19:36] instruments, musical instruments.
[19:40] In Daniel 3:7,
[19:43] as they're being these Hebrew children,
[19:45] Haniah, Aariah, Misha are being
[19:47] commanded to bow before an image of
[19:49] Daniel. says, "Therefore, at that time
[19:51] when all the people heard the sound of
[19:53] the cornet, flute, harp, sacklet,
[19:55] sultry, and all kinds of music, all the
[19:58] people, the nations, and the languages
[19:59] fell down and worshiped the golden image
[20:01] that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set
[20:03] up." Notice how all nations and
[20:06] languages can understand music. They may
[20:09] not have spoke the same language
[20:11] linguistically as far as a tongue, but
[20:14] now there is this inherent innate
[20:16] ability to understand and relate to
[20:18] music. And the sounding forth of the
[20:21] cornet, cornet, the flute, the harp, the
[20:22] sack, but the salt sultry and all kinds
[20:25] of music signifies to everyone from all
[20:28] sorts of different backgrounds and
[20:29] cultures and nations and languages to
[20:31] worship this false image that the king
[20:33] had set up. So we can see that even
[20:36] music and uh and its development and and
[20:40] it's combining together different
[20:41] instruments
[20:43] and sounds and tones is present in
[20:46] Babylonian worship.
[20:48] Acts chapter 13 10 teaches us as we
[20:51] mentioned how the devil's not able to
[20:52] create. He can only pervert what God has
[20:54] already used, manifested or created.
[20:56] says, and Paul says, I, "Oh, full of all
[20:59] subtlety and all mischief." And then
[21:02] just taking this phrase, "Thou child of
[21:03] the devil,
[21:05] thou enemy of all righteousness." And
[21:07] here's this characteristic of Satan.
[21:09] Wilt thou not cease to pervert the right
[21:12] ways of the Lord? So, it's the it's the
[21:15] devil's nature to pervert God's nature.
[21:18] It's the devil's nature to pervert the
[21:20] right ways of the Lord. Amen.
[21:24] Now, if you're if you're starting to get
[21:25] a little bit tense thinking, "Oh my
[21:27] goodness, Brother Aaron is showing that
[21:29] music is satanic and we just had a song
[21:31] service wherein we played." Just relax.
[21:34] I just read a bunch of scriptures in the
[21:36] beginning. I should have clued you in on
[21:38] the fact that there's something that was
[21:39] before.
[21:40] It's an original before there's a
[21:41] perversion. Right.
[21:43] So we can see that there uh there is
[21:46] music in the beginning music on earth
[21:49] but in the its beginnings at earth we
[21:51] only begin to glimpse it in the sense
[21:52] that it's already being taken over
[21:54] through fallen mankind and humanity and
[21:57] now it has this prominent position
[21:58] within Babylon.
[22:01] But if you look at Psalms 149:es 3 to5
[22:05] I want I want to look at a group of
[22:08] scriptures here.
[22:10] I've got a number of them here that will
[22:15] kind of emphasize on the same thing of
[22:17] what
[22:19] what music means to God.
[22:23] In Psalms 149:es 3,4 and 5, let them
[22:26] praise his name in the dance. Should we
[22:28] do a series on dancing? Let them praise
[22:31] his name in the dance. Let them sing
[22:34] praises unto him with the timberal and
[22:37] harp. Now though you could see a harp in
[22:41] Babylonian worship and Lucifer himself
[22:43] with these timberalss made within them.
[22:46] Now the psalmist is saying praise God
[22:49] with the timber and harp for the Lord
[22:52] taketh pleasure in his people. I'll come
[22:55] back to that. He will beautify the meek
[22:57] with salvation. Let the saints be joyful
[22:59] in glory. Let them sing aloud upon their
[23:02] beds. So there is that musing, that
[23:05] meditation. Even in the night time, even
[23:07] as they're reclining, let them sing. Let
[23:09] them rejoice. Let them praise. Praise
[23:11] has a musical connotation to it. But it
[23:14] says, "For the Lord taketh pleasure in
[23:16] his people. But the Lord is not just
[23:19] delighting in his children, but he
[23:21] enjoys the music that they offer to him
[23:24] in praise. The Lord taketh pleasure in
[23:28] his the singing of praises. The Lord
[23:30] taketh pleasure in the temporal and harp
[23:32] in them singing aloud on their beds.
[23:34] When it says the Lord taketh pleasure in
[23:35] his people, it forms kind of that spoke,
[23:38] that middle of the will that informs
[23:41] all the praising that goes to him and he
[23:45] enjoys that.
[23:46] He enjoys the musical praise, this
[23:49] worship that is offered to him.
[23:53] In Revelations 15:es 2 and three, again,
[23:56] just zeroing in on some very specific
[23:58] aspects of this scripture. And I saw, as
[24:00] it were, a sea of glass mingled with
[24:02] fire, and them that had gotten the
[24:04] victory over the beast, and over his
[24:05] image, and over his mark, and over the
[24:07] number of his name, stand on the sea of
[24:09] glass, having the harps of God,
[24:14] and they sing the song of Moses, the
[24:16] servant of God, and the song of the
[24:18] lamb. So now Moses has a song. The lamb
[24:22] has a song. They're all singing it
[24:23] together. Great and marvelous are thy
[24:25] works, Lord God Almighty. Just and true
[24:27] are thy ways, thou King of saints.
[24:30] There was some melody to that, some
[24:31] harmony to that, some meter and rhythm.
[24:33] There was it was a singing.
[24:36] If someone just said, "Great and
[24:37] marvelous are thy works, Lord God
[24:38] Almighty. Just and true are thy ways,
[24:40] thou King of saints." You say, "Oh,
[24:42] that's Sith. That's the beginning.
[24:43] That's synth. That's the beginning.
[24:45] Sith, synth. That's the beginning of
[24:46] house music or something." Well, maybe
[24:48] somebody could begin to put a beat to it
[24:51] and just and then the drop and then
[24:53] everybody's like Jesus. But it's it's
[24:55] musical. It's coral. It has a it would
[24:57] have had a sound to it. Even some of the
[25:00] most ancient singing was just a voice, a
[25:03] beautiful voice hitting the right tones
[25:05] and notes and and building tension even
[25:08] through the vocalization. But it says
[25:10] here the harps of God
[25:14] having the harps of God. These are God's
[25:16] harps
[25:18] as God made and created Lucifer with the
[25:21] timberals within them, the noise of his
[25:23] vials, his his guitars, his musical
[25:25] instruments. Uh uh God had made them in
[25:27] him. Now there's this restoration or
[25:29] reclamation of music and its purity and
[25:32] its greatness. And they have the harps
[25:34] of God here in the context of
[25:35] Revelations 15. And they're playing and
[25:37] singing Moses's song. and the song of
[25:39] the lamb.
[25:42] So we see that God takes pleasure in
[25:45] worship, musical worship and music of
[25:47] his people. God has harps. Zephaniah 3
[25:51] 14-1 17. Sing, oh daughter of Zion.
[25:53] Shout, O Israel. Be glad and rejoice
[25:56] with all the heart. Oh daughter of
[25:58] Jerusalem. The Lord hath taken away thy
[26:00] judgments. He hath cast out thine enemy.
[26:03] The king of Israel, even the Lord, is in
[26:04] the midst of thee. Thou shalt not see
[26:06] evil anymore. are beautiful scriptures
[26:09] worthy of our of consideration of their
[26:11] context and their meaning and what these
[26:12] things point to. But again, we're going
[26:14] to zero in on how he says, "Sing, oh
[26:16] daughter of Zion. In that day it shall
[26:18] be said to Jerusalem," fear thou not and
[26:21] to Zion, let not thine hands be slack.
[26:24] The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is
[26:26] mighty. This one who loves to hear his
[26:28] people sing. He will save. He will
[26:31] rejoice over thee with joy. He will rest
[26:33] in his love. He will. He will rejoice
[26:36] over thee with joy. He will rest in his
[26:38] love. He will joy over thee with
[26:42] singing.
[26:43] The scripture here speaks specifically
[26:46] of God singing.
[26:48] He will rejoice over thee with singing.
[26:53] God rejoicing over us. Is that slideshow
[26:56] froze up there? Did I give the wrong
[26:58] Maybe I didn't have it there. Maybe I
[27:00] messed up. I could put the wrong
[27:02] scripture reference there. Disregard the
[27:04] top one. That's kind of giving you a
[27:05] little bit of a heads up where we're
[27:06] going next. I'm going to learn just to
[27:08] trust you, Brother John. I'm going to
[27:09] know if it's not up there, it's my
[27:10] mistake.
[27:12] He will joy over thee with singing. God
[27:15] sings over us.
[27:17] So God has harps. He's the first
[27:19] instrument maker,
[27:21] not Jewel or Tubalcane. They were
[27:24] perverting what God did. He's the one
[27:25] that made these in the beginning. He'll
[27:27] join Jeremiah 31:es 3 and 4.
[27:31] This is a a little bit different meaning
[27:33] here. And this speaks to the things
[27:35] we've been saying in these few verses
[27:36] here. The Lord hath appeared of old unto
[27:38] me, saying, "Yay, I have loved thee with
[27:40] an everlasting love." The God that's in
[27:42] the midst of thee. He will save you,
[27:43] rejoice over thee. He'll rest in his
[27:44] love. He loves with an everlasting love.
[27:46] Therefore, with loving kindness have I
[27:48] drawn thee. Again, I will build thee,
[27:52] and thou shalt be built, oh virgin of
[27:54] Israel. So, God's building, God's
[27:56] creating. Thou shalt again be adorned
[27:59] with thy tabs, and shalt go forth in the
[28:02] dances of them that make Mary. So he's
[28:05] speaking here in Jeremiah 31. It's in
[28:07] Zephaniah that God rejoiced over us with
[28:09] singing. But now in Jeremiah, it's
[28:11] saying, I'm going to build you, you will
[28:14] be built, and when I build you, I will
[28:16] adorn you again with instruments. I will
[28:19] adorn you again with music's tablets.
[28:22] uh these musical instruments, these
[28:24] tablets that would maybe be used for a
[28:26] beat a a and and for rhythm
[28:31] and shall go forth in the dances of them
[28:33] that make Mary
[28:38] in Psalms 22:3.
[28:47] This scripture I quote quite often after
[28:50] a song service because I just think of
[28:52] how much of a promise this is to us.
[28:56] But thou art holy. Oh thou that
[28:58] inhabitest
[29:00] dwells in abides in the praises of
[29:03] Israel. This particular conjugation or
[29:06] translation inhabitist only takes place
[29:08] I think one time in the scripture. Thou
[29:10] inhabitest the praises of Israel. the
[29:14] praises. It's a song or hymn of praise.
[29:17] It's a musical boasting of God's glory
[29:20] and goodness. Thou inhabitest the
[29:22] praises. It's not just an intelligible
[29:26] uh shout. It's not just a noise, but
[29:29] there's something musical to it. He
[29:32] inhabits, he lives in, he abides in the
[29:36] praise of Israel. God himself is a
[29:40] builder and creator of instruments. One
[29:42] who has harps, who loves to sing. He
[29:45] takes pleasure in those who use those
[29:47] instruments to sing back to him, to
[29:50] praise him, to express love back to him.
[29:53] In Ephesians 5:1 19, this has been
[29:55] featured prominently as of late, Paul in
[29:58] instructing and placing this church that
[30:00] could be placed in this time of
[30:02] adoption, speaking to yourselves in
[30:04] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs as
[30:07] those seraphones resounded this
[30:08] antifonal uh chant, this liturgy back
[30:11] and forth, this song of praise, holy,
[30:13] holy, holy, that they begin to say, now
[30:15] it says, speak to yourselves one to
[30:17] another in psalms and hymns and
[30:18] spiritual songs. So we sing to each
[30:21] other but then also singing and making
[30:22] melody in your heart to the Lord.
[30:25] So we have a song internally that
[30:27] informs the song that we sing
[30:30] externally.
[30:32] Hebrews chapter 2:12.
[30:36] This is quoting a scripture.
[30:40] The writer here says I will declare thy
[30:43] name unto my brethren. This is Jesus
[30:45] speaking or this is the prophecy of the
[30:47] Messiah. In the midst of the church will
[30:50] I sing praise unto thee.
[30:53] The word not only commands us to offer
[30:56] praise, to offer boasting, to offer
[30:58] singing,
[31:00] but here there's this prophecy in Psalms
[31:03] of Christ singing in the middle of the
[31:05] congregation.
[31:07] So he's not it's and it's not just a
[31:09] solo. He's the leader of the choir.
[31:12] Amen. I will sing in the middle of the
[31:14] church. I will sing praises unto thee.
[31:18] And in Psalms 22:22, this is the
[31:21] prophecy Paul's building off of. I will
[31:23] declare thy name unto my brethren. In
[31:25] the midst of the congregation will I
[31:27] praise thee. So, we are commanded to
[31:29] offer praise. We're commanded to sing.
[31:31] We're commanded to boastfully uh praise
[31:34] God in music and worship and and these
[31:36] songs and these melodies and these
[31:38] instruments that are used, they're to be
[31:39] used in praise of God. Jesus himself
[31:42] standing up in the midst of the church
[31:44] singing as God sings over us. Now the
[31:46] Messiah sings even in the image of God
[31:48] as a choir leader encouraging us all to
[31:50] join in the chorus
[31:53] in Psalms 33:es 1:3.
[31:58] Maybe transitioning a little bit just to
[31:59] see how that God commands this praise.
[32:04] The scripture ask of this praise. If we
[32:06] bog down there just and begin with
[32:08] Ezekiel 28 and we went to Isaiah and
[32:10] then we went to uh uh Daniel, we say,
[32:12] "Oh, well music is of the devil. Music
[32:14] is of the devil." There is a devil's
[32:16] music. We could say that. And we all
[32:19] know what it is, right?
[32:22] I'm just kidding. I'm just trolling you.
[32:26] In Psalms 33:es 1-3 says, "Rejoice in
[32:29] the Lord, oh you righteous, for praise.
[32:31] Praise again, it has a musical note to
[32:34] it. Praise is comely for the upright.
[32:36] Praise the Lord with the harp. Sing unto
[32:38] him with the sultry and an instrument of
[32:39] 10 strings. Sing unto him a new song."
[32:42] Now look at this. Play skillfully with
[32:45] the loud noise.
[32:47] This is something where there you should
[32:49] desire to do it well, to do it
[32:51] skillfully, not to have a trained voice
[32:53] and not necessarily just to master
[32:55] technique, but play skillfully.
[32:58] It implies that it's not just noise.
[33:01] It's not just for attention. It's not
[33:03] for clamor, but it's it dovetales.
[33:07] It it it harmonizes. It's melodic. It's
[33:10] tuneful.
[33:12] And he says, "Praise him with the harp.
[33:14] Sing with a sultry, an instrument of 10
[33:16] strings. Sing unto him a new song.
[33:20] Play skillfully with a loud noise."
[33:23] That's again, it's not just a racket,
[33:26] but it's a sounding song. Psalms 150:es
[33:31] 3-6. Praise him with the sound of the
[33:33] trumpet. Praise him with the sultry and
[33:35] harp. Praise him with the timber and
[33:37] dance. Praise him with stringed
[33:39] instruments and organs. Praise him upon
[33:41] the loud symbols praise him upon the
[33:42] high sounding symbols. Let everything
[33:45] that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise
[33:48] ye the Lord.
[33:51] Here in the Psalms it's encouraging
[33:53] again. Trumpet, sultry, harp, timberal,
[33:56] dance, stringed instruments, organs,
[33:58] loud symbols, high sounding symbols. And
[34:00] then everything that has breath
[34:03] is you. If you can't play an instrument,
[34:05] if you don't play the harp, if you don't
[34:06] play the drums, if you don't play the
[34:08] organ, whatever it might be, then you've
[34:09] got a voice that you can lend not to
[34:12] sing your own tune, but to blend
[34:14] with others who are playing.
[34:17] Let everything that hath breath sing
[34:19] skillfully.
[34:20] Let everything that can play, let it
[34:22] play unto the Lord.
[34:25] You finding brother Brandham often when
[34:26] he addresses the subject of worldly
[34:28] music, his biggest complaint is how it
[34:30] slipped into the church and that many of
[34:31] the musicians who were playing in church
[34:33] were playing in the bar the night
[34:34] before.
[34:35] And so the gift wasn't being yielded to
[34:38] the Lord. It was just being used uh used
[34:40] whenever.
[34:42] So there's a sanctity, there's a skill,
[34:44] there's a set sanctification to these
[34:46] things. Psalms 81:es 1:3
[34:52] to the chief musician upon getth a psalm
[34:55] of Asaf, one of the song leaders, one of
[34:57] the worship leaders. It says, "Sing
[34:59] aloud unto God our strength.
[35:03] Make a joyful noise unto the God of
[35:05] Jacob. Take a psalm and bring hither the
[35:07] templant harp with the sultry. Blow up
[35:11] the trumpet and the new moon." That
[35:12] doesn't mean like make it explode. But
[35:15] at this season, at this time when we
[35:17] have these festivals, when we have these
[35:18] gatherings, when we are honoring these
[35:21] feast days, when we come together to
[35:22] worship, sound the trumpet in the time
[35:25] appointed on our solemn feast day. Bring
[35:28] the song that was written. Bring the
[35:30] music to accompany it. Let us rejoice in
[35:33] the Lord in this time, this convocation,
[35:35] this gathering together.
[35:39] In Isaiah 30 29, ye shall have a song,
[35:42] as in the night when a holy simity is
[35:44] kept, and gladness of your heart, as
[35:47] when one goeth with the pipe to come
[35:48] into the mountain of the Lord, the
[35:50] mighty one of Israel.
[35:53] When there's this, when there's
[35:56] redemption, when there's deliverance,
[35:58] you shall have a song as one who's
[36:01] piping to the house of the Lord, a
[36:03] music, one that's carrying you on. My
[36:06] son Elliot and I there's we we when
[36:08] we're listening to music together every
[36:10] once in a while we'll hear one like this
[36:11] is a road trip song like this is a song
[36:14] just to put drop to top on that
[36:18] convertible and just ride out into the
[36:20] mountains and you could just listen to
[36:21] it because there's a certain sounding
[36:23] that goes forth kind of as one who's
[36:25] walking journey into Zion
[36:28] even as we sing the song we're marching
[36:30] to Zion it has a rhythm to it where you
[36:33] could just say throngs of people with
[36:35] that song or that melody moving in their
[36:37] heart to a goal.
[36:39] In the scripture, we see that music is
[36:41] found in times of victory. It's found in
[36:43] times of deliverance, times of war, in
[36:45] times of the manifestation of God's
[36:46] presence. Music is there. In Exodus
[36:50] 15:es 1 and two, after God has
[36:53] manifested himself mighty in battle and
[36:56] and deliverance and pers uh preservation
[36:58] of Israel, then sang Moses and the
[37:00] children of Israel this song unto the
[37:02] Lord and spake, saying, I will sing unto
[37:05] the Lord, for he hath triumphed glorious
[37:08] gloriously the horse and his rider hath
[37:10] been thrown into the sea. The Lord is my
[37:12] strength and song. Again, God even
[37:17] himself is now the Lord is my song and
[37:20] he has become my salvation. He is my
[37:22] God. I will prepare him in habitation,
[37:25] my father's God, and I will exalt him.
[37:30] There is an exaltation through praise
[37:32] and through singing and through the
[37:34] offering of talents and gifts and
[37:35] instruments. The Lord is not just my
[37:38] strength, he's my song.
[37:41] They sang Moses.
[37:44] Moses and the children of Israel sang.
[37:47] It could be that this is a similar song
[37:48] that was sung of God's servant. Moses
[37:51] having the harps of God begin to sing.
[37:55] It's at this time of this Exodus. God
[37:57] has vanquished their foe. What happens
[37:59] when it there's this instinct of praise
[38:05] and it's not just screaming and
[38:07] shouting, it's musical.
[38:10] 2 Samuel chapter 6:5 as the ark is being
[38:13] restored back to Israel.
[38:16] This going to intervene a little bit
[38:18] here. We know it's not according to
[38:20] God's will. As it's be done, death
[38:22] results as a part of it. But we can see
[38:23] here this this habit in Israel, this uh
[38:28] this Judeaic instinct, it's part of
[38:31] their worship. and David and all the
[38:32] people of Israel played before the Lord
[38:34] on all manner of instruments made of
[38:36] furwood even on harps and on sulties and
[38:38] on timbals and on cornets and on symbols
[38:40] they're praising before the ark
[38:43] as as it's coming back to its place in
[38:46] these initial stages there's a there's a
[38:49] celebration and it's musical
[38:53] and then in verse 14 and David danced
[38:55] before the Lord with all his might and
[38:56] David was girded with the linen ephod so
[38:58] David and all the house of Israel
[39:00] brought up the ark of the Lord shouting
[39:02] and with the sound of the trumpet.
[39:05] There's songs of deliverance, songs of
[39:08] praise, songs of of rejoicing and
[39:11] boasting, music that boasted of the
[39:13] goodness of God.
[39:15] It wasn't, you know, the wheel on the
[39:17] wagon goes round and round.
[39:20] Uh it it it wasn't uh take one down and
[39:23] pass it around, but it was songs that
[39:25] lifted up the Lord.
[39:29] Now, this this is a little bit of a a
[39:31] shift in in
[39:33] uh kind of the momentum, but in the
[39:36] service of God and the service of God's
[39:38] people in the temple, you'll see in the
[39:40] scripture that the Levites were the ones
[39:42] that were gifted, instructed, and
[39:43] ordained for music. And and I'm sharing
[39:46] this just to show the closeness that
[39:49] music has to
[39:52] the types and shadows of what was
[39:53] offered in the temple in all those
[39:55] sacrifices and all the cleanliness and
[39:57] all the the ceremony was foreshadowing
[40:00] the house of the Lord, the bride and and
[40:02] Christ himself portrayed in the
[40:04] sacrifice, the high priest and all these
[40:06] different elements that are that are
[40:08] shown in there that there's a m there's
[40:10] music that's ordained as part of that.
[40:12] So, if I could just show you how that
[40:14] music is so closely associated with that
[40:16] precious symbolism in the Old Testament
[40:19] and the way that God commanded them to
[40:20] worship, you'll see why how important it
[40:23] is to us, how important it is to God,
[40:26] but then also how much Satan would like
[40:28] to take it for his own. In 1st
[40:31] Chronicles 15:16, and David spake to the
[40:34] chief of the Levites to appoint their
[40:36] brethren, so Levites, Levites are
[40:38] appointed to be singers with instruments
[40:40] of music, sulties, and harps and symbols
[40:42] sounding by lifting up the voice with
[40:45] joy. So it's the Levites who are
[40:47] appointed to be the song leaders and the
[40:49] musicians. They're the ones that are
[40:51] going to play instruments. They're the
[40:53] ones that are going to be singing
[40:54] together, and they would work to
[40:56] harmonize. I know in my experience, I
[40:58] could be wrong about this, but to me,
[41:00] the best harmony most often is within
[41:02] families. It's just I don't know if it's
[41:04] the time to practice or just their
[41:05] certain tone and the resonance that they
[41:07] have that they just can harmonize and
[41:09] have really tight harmony and vary
[41:11] beautifully. And here you see Levites,
[41:13] brethren of the same tribe are going to
[41:15] be the ones who play the instruments and
[41:17] going to be the ones who sing. Not that
[41:19] they would be the only ones, but they
[41:20] would be leaders in that. In 2
[41:22] Chronicles 25:es 1:7,
[41:26] I'll just maybe uh jump through here for
[41:29] time sake. It says
[41:31] 1 Chronicles 25:es 1-7. Moreover, David
[41:35] and the captains of the host separated
[41:36] to the servants of the sons of Asaf and
[41:40] of Hean and of Jedithan, who should
[41:43] prophesy
[41:45] with harps, with sultreies, with
[41:47] symbols, and the number the workmen
[41:49] according to their service was. And then
[41:51] it's going to list these workmen. But
[41:54] now in this ordaining these captains,
[41:56] David and the captains of the host
[41:58] separated to the service of the sons of
[41:59] Asaf and these and these ones that they
[42:01] would prophesy with harp sultry symbols
[42:04] and these workmen with these instruments
[42:07] now are going to be elicited in these
[42:08] next few verses. And it gives these it
[42:11] says which prophesied according to the
[42:13] order of the king. What was the order?
[42:14] They would prophesy with harps, sulties
[42:16] and symbols. It says, "And they
[42:18] prophesied with a harp to give thanks
[42:20] and to praise the Lord." All these were
[42:22] the sons of him and the king seer in the
[42:24] words of God to lift up the horn. You
[42:27] catch what's happening that the Levites
[42:29] part in ministry included music and and
[42:34] it's now not just music, but it's even
[42:37] being associated with prophecy
[42:39] with an oracle from God. It's been
[42:41] associated with uh with things related
[42:44] to God. All these were lifting up the
[42:46] words of God with the horn and all these
[42:48] were under the hands of their father for
[42:50] song in the house of the Lord with
[42:52] symbols sulties harps for the service of
[42:54] the house of God.
[42:57] Verse 7 it says so the number of them
[42:58] with their brethren that were instructed
[43:00] in the songs of the Lord even all that
[43:01] were cunning was 20 for score in 8. 288
[43:05] skilled musicians. We're not even
[43:07] halfway there yet church.
[43:10] 288 skilled musicians trained and
[43:13] organized into 24 divisions. And so
[43:16] these Levites through music had a part
[43:18] in prophetic ministry, not just
[43:20] musicians.
[43:22] This wasn't a a get together. They're
[43:24] just going to jam. And and it wasn't the
[43:27] Levitical Garage Band. And they weren't
[43:29] producing bides and mixtapz. These they
[43:31] had a specific use. They were not just
[43:34] musicians, but now they have this part
[43:37] in even it seems to be and I don't fully
[43:40] quite understand how it would how it was
[43:42] used, but it's they had this part in the
[43:45] Bible says prophesying according to
[43:47] their calling.
[43:50] They would prophesy with these
[43:51] instruments. They would prophesy with a
[43:53] harp to give thanks and praise to the
[43:55] Lord.
[43:57] Seers in the word of God to lift up the
[43:59] horn.
[44:01] Musical worship is ordained by God.
[44:04] It's not just uh something that you're
[44:07] gifted in or something that's just
[44:09] innate alone. It's not a creation of the
[44:11] human or human tradition. It's not
[44:14] ordained by God uh because man has a
[44:18] tendency to it, but it's ordained solely
[44:20] by God because he loves it. It's
[44:21] something part of him. It's not man or
[44:22] culture
[44:24] that has spawned it. In 2 Chronicles
[44:28] 29:es
[44:30] 25-30. And he set the Levites in the
[44:34] house of the Lord with symbols, with
[44:35] sulties, and with harps, according to
[44:38] the commandment of David, and of Gad the
[44:40] king seer, and Nathan the prophet. For
[44:42] so was the commandment of the Lord by
[44:44] his prophets.
[44:46] What is that Levites in the house of the
[44:48] Lord would have music?
[44:51] And I know you're all asking right now.
[44:52] You, this, you've been thinking this
[44:53] over and over again. What does brother
[44:54] Aaron play?
[44:56] How could he even be up there if he
[44:59] can't play an instrument?
[45:01] Well, not all Levites were called to the
[45:04] priesthood.
[45:08] No, that's not where I was going to go
[45:09] with that. I can I can strum a guitar a
[45:11] little bit. Strummer boy is what they
[45:12] called me.
[45:16] There is in the Levitical calling, a
[45:19] calling to music, symbols, sultry with
[45:21] harps. says, "And Levite stood with the
[45:23] instruments of David and the priest with
[45:25] the trumpets." I did play the trumpet uh
[45:28] in middle school, too. Says, "And
[45:30] Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt
[45:32] offering upon the altar. And when the
[45:33] burnt offering began, the song of the
[45:35] Lord began also with the trumpets and
[45:37] with the instruments ordained by David,
[45:39] king of Israel." Over and over again,
[45:40] this ordination
[45:42] to the singing. It's a component of
[45:44] worship. Now, in this great moment, the
[45:46] Levites and the house of the Lord gather
[45:47] their instruments. The worship the the
[45:49] offering begins to come forth by the
[45:51] prophet's command. A and the and these
[45:54] things are happening and the Lord is
[45:57] worshiped the song of the Lord with the
[45:58] trumpets with the instruments and all
[46:00] the congregation worshiped. Verse 28
[46:02] very important here verse 20. And all
[46:04] the congregation worshiped and the
[46:06] singer sang and the trumpeters sounded
[46:09] in this tabernacle in this worship. They
[46:12] all participated
[46:14] and all this continued until the burnt
[46:15] offering was finished. And when they had
[46:17] made an end of an end of offering, the
[46:19] king and all that were present with him
[46:21] bowed themselves and worshiped.
[46:23] Moreover, Hezekiah the king and the
[46:24] princes commanded the Levites to sing
[46:26] praise unto the Lord with the words of
[46:27] David and of Asaf the seer. And they
[46:30] sang praises with gladness and they
[46:33] bowed their heads and worshiped.
[46:39] What a awesome picture here in this
[46:43] moment of praise.
[46:46] The Levites stood with those things that
[46:47] they were commanded to stand with. As
[46:49] David had appointed them, brethren of
[46:51] the Levites, to be singers and to be
[46:53] players of instruments. Now, we can see
[46:54] in this setting that as the sacrifice is
[46:57] being offered, they sing the song of the
[46:59] Lord. There's trumpets being played. All
[47:01] these instruments ordained by David and
[47:03] all the congregation worships and all
[47:06] the singers sang and the trumpeters
[47:08] sounded. So you had those on their
[47:09] instruments, you had ones singing as
[47:11] leaders, and then you had everyone that
[47:13] joined in together and they sang praises
[47:16] with gladness. They bowed their heads
[47:18] and worshiped.
[47:21] This is
[47:23] Israel's part of Israel's god orained
[47:27] service to the one true God. So my last
[47:31] thought before we close or before we get
[47:34] to my close, and I'm not trying to be
[47:36] cryptic with that. I just have a
[47:37] statement from birth painans I'd like to
[47:39] read in close, but I want to just sum up
[47:41] some of these things looking
[47:42] specifically here at Israel. But even in
[47:44] the restoration of the temple, music is
[47:47] present. It's part of full redemption.
[47:49] If we see music at the time the seals
[47:51] are open, we see music at the time of
[47:53] the 144,000 praying. We see music in
[47:55] Revelations 15. We see music at these
[47:57] different junctures. And God says, "Even
[47:59] in the beginning when I created, there
[48:00] was singing, there was rejoicing." God
[48:02] has is the creator of music, the creator
[48:05] of instruments, he himself uh having
[48:08] harps, he himself singing and full
[48:10] redemption includes the restoration of
[48:13] music. In Nehemiah 12 27 28 and 29 and
[48:17] at the dedication of the wall of
[48:19] Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of
[48:22] all their places. Why? Because the
[48:24] Levites, those brethren had not only
[48:26] been ordained, part of them ordained to
[48:28] the priesthood to offer up physical
[48:30] sacrifices of blood a and to maintain
[48:33] the temple, but they also were part of
[48:36] the worship in playing instruments and
[48:38] singing. So they sought out the Levites
[48:41] who were called to that to bring them to
[48:42] Jerusalem to keep the dedication with
[48:45] gladness, both with thanksgivings and
[48:48] with singing, with symbols, sultries,
[48:51] and with harps.
[48:53] And the sons of the singers gathered
[48:55] themselves together. They were in the
[48:57] lineage. They were in that calling both
[48:58] out of the plain country round about
[49:00] Jerusalem and from the villages uh
[49:02] Netafati and also from the house of
[49:04] Gilgal and out of the fields of Gea and
[49:06] Azmth. For the singers had builded them
[49:09] villages round about Jerusalem. They
[49:12] were the singers. They were close by.
[49:14] They were called the singers because
[49:17] they were part of that Levitical line
[49:20] who were called to singing, to playing
[49:22] instruments. And now as they have built
[49:24] the wall, they're calling them together
[49:26] to sing. Later on in that chapter and at
[49:29] the first and at that time were some
[49:31] appointed over the chambers of the
[49:32] treasures for the offerings for the
[49:34] first fruits and for the tithes to
[49:36] gather into them out of the fields of
[49:38] the cities the portions of the law for
[49:39] the priests and Levites. for Judah
[49:41] rejoiced for the priest and for the
[49:43] Levites that waited. So again, this is
[49:45] the Levites inheritance and their
[49:47] portion was through this giving. And
[49:49] both the singers and the porters kept
[49:51] the ward of their God, their calling,
[49:53] their office, and the ward of the
[49:54] purification according to the
[49:56] commandment of David and of Solomon his
[49:58] son. The singers are part of this, these
[50:00] instrument players. In the days of David
[50:02] and Asaf of old, there were chief of the
[50:05] singers in songs of praise and
[50:07] thanksgiving unto God. They're
[50:08] hearkening back to this initiation, this
[50:10] beginning when God ordained these
[50:12] offices and these parts. And all Israel
[50:13] in the days of Zerubel in the days of
[50:15] Nehemiah gave the portions of the
[50:17] singers and the porters every day his
[50:20] portion. So this is their giving to
[50:21] sustain this. And they sanctified holy
[50:24] things in the Levites and the Levites
[50:25] sanctified them under the children of
[50:27] Aaron
[50:29] because see even when God is going to
[50:31] build back the temple the part of that
[50:34] even before they get to this full
[50:36] restoration they begin to bring back the
[50:38] singers bring back those that play
[50:40] instruments. They didn't view it as well
[50:42] if we could just if we could just uh
[50:44] maybe sacrifice the lamb on the grounds.
[50:45] They wanted to get everything restored.
[50:47] They get wanted to get everything built
[50:48] up. And part of that was bringing the
[50:51] singers, the musicians, the players
[50:54] back to the temple. This is all part of
[50:58] the world of music.
[51:02] Now, I want to read a statement.
[51:05] Uh it was it's in a book. It's been
[51:07] translated out of the original tongue.
[51:10] It's a it's a fictional account of this
[51:11] dialogue between the king of the
[51:13] Khazars. It's a a region in Asia and a
[51:16] rabbi. And it's a kind of an exposition
[51:18] of medieval Jewish philosophy. Some view
[51:21] it as a defense of Judaism. It's the
[51:23] Kitbat Alcazari.
[51:25] And in it, the king Al Khazari is in
[51:29] speaking with this rabbi, he says, I
[51:31] perceive that your law comprises all
[51:33] sorts of profound and strange scientist
[51:36] sciences not to be found in other codes.
[51:38] All right. It's it was it's a good
[51:40] question. As I've been reading in that
[51:42] book, there's a lot of really
[51:43] interesting rich stuff. He says, "I
[51:45] perceive that your law to a Jew, his law
[51:47] is very precious, ordained by God,
[51:49] included a lot of profound and even
[51:51] different unique sciences not found in
[51:53] other codes or laws." And so, it's kind
[51:55] of provoking this rabbi to speak in
[51:58] particular about their law and their
[52:00] codes. And I I may I may use it on on
[52:04] Wednesday or maybe next Sunday. There's
[52:06] he begins to talk about their different
[52:08] sciences and what they're versed in and
[52:10] how it was necessary in order to keep
[52:12] the law. He even speaks about the
[52:14] diversity of seeds. You had to know what
[52:16] was which so you didn't transgress in
[52:18] the law. So that it's through that there
[52:20] became a lot of knowledge and uh the
[52:22] seeking of knowledge. But then he comes
[52:24] to this part and the rabbi says and I
[52:26] have it quoted here. Music was the pride
[52:28] of a nation which distributed their
[52:31] songs in such a way that they fell to
[52:33] the lot of the aristocracy of the people
[52:35] the Levites who made practical use of
[52:37] them in the holy house in the holy
[52:39] season. So in this view and though we
[52:42] could say well this is just a this is a
[52:44] book that was written it's a fictional
[52:45] account but yet you could see in a lot
[52:48] of these things and this would be this
[52:49] this attitude and this thought that it's
[52:52] the music is the pride of the nation.
[52:55] I think there's even a a sound today
[52:58] that we would say is a Hebrew sound.
[53:01] There's a certain arrangement maybe even
[53:03] to music that we might associate with
[53:05] Israel. But music was the pride of the
[53:08] nation. And it was such a pride of the
[53:09] nation to where it wasn't there was this
[53:12] and it's not necessarily exclusive, but
[53:14] they entrusted this special class of
[53:17] people, the Levites, to use it properly
[53:21] in the house of the Lord. And during the
[53:22] holy season, music was a special thing.
[53:25] It was the pride of the nation.
[53:28] There might be certain family recipes
[53:30] that you don't mess with. And someone
[53:32] says, "Well, I I made goulash." and they
[53:34] come to find out that it's noodles and
[53:36] and tomato sauce and like that that no,
[53:38] you can't do that. That's blasphemy
[53:41] or stuffing with cornbread or whatever
[53:43] it might be. There's certain sanct
[53:45] sanctified things or sacred things
[53:47] within family tradition that you want to
[53:49] keep this a certain way. This is the way
[53:50] that it is. Well, in a similar sense,
[53:52] music was sacred to Israel. It was the
[53:55] pride of the nation. They had songs.
[53:58] They had hymns.
[54:01] They could sing them together. One could
[54:03] just begin to sing and then another
[54:06] would fall in with them. And it might
[54:09] not even have words that you could
[54:10] understand, but yet to them they knew
[54:13] what it hearkened to. Oh, that's the
[54:15] song of this deliverance. That's the
[54:17] song of this.
[54:19] Music was the pride
[54:22] of a nation.
[54:25] And I close with this statement. And I I
[54:27] encourage you to go into the message of
[54:28] the hour and and maybe go and read this,
[54:32] listen to this sermon, the schol at the
[54:34] beginning of 64. Excellent uh to look
[54:37] at. There's some things just even prior
[54:38] to that. A lot of a lot of ways that
[54:41] brother Brandham in uh in the message of
[54:44] the hour is talking about music.
[54:46] But listen to this. And I have a few
[54:48] things summarized here kind of maybe in
[54:49] my own words, but this is what I'm
[54:51] wanting to draw off of this. He says
[54:52] he's speaking about that moment when he
[54:54] had and he goes into more detail in the
[54:56] summer of 64 in this what we call the
[54:59] preview of the bride and the bride will
[55:00] come in preview and he sees the church
[55:02] then there's a succession of other
[55:04] church he says the bride and there's
[55:06] this discouragement on brother
[55:07] Brandham's part and he says the bride
[55:08] will come into view again and he says I
[55:10] was to have a preview of the church this
[55:12] is very familiar there's a lot of things
[55:15] that we can bring out of this and really
[55:16] love and enjoy but like I said
[55:17] throughout this I'm zeroing in on one
[55:19] particular component so we can just say
[55:21] ah Yeah, that's there. I was to have a
[55:24] preview of the church and I was taken by
[55:25] someone who I could not see and was set
[55:27] up on a stand and I heard the sweetest
[55:30] music I ever heard.
[55:33] And I looked coming and a bunch of
[55:36] little ladies looked to be oh some age
[55:38] around 20, 18, 20 and they all had long
[55:42] hair and were fixed in different
[55:44] dresses, different types of dresses. So
[55:46] what was that? That national garb that
[55:48] different nationality.
[55:50] So they had maintained maybe some
[55:51] uniqueness to how they looked and he
[55:53] could identify by the way that they
[55:55] dressed where they were from but there
[55:58] notice it's music that introduces them.
[56:01] He says and they were marching just as
[56:02] perfectly in step with that music as it
[56:05] could be. So there's music that
[56:07] introduces them. It's music that they're
[56:09] walking to. They're perfectly in step
[56:12] with that.
[56:14] And they went from my left going around
[56:16] this way. And I watched them and I
[56:19] looked then to see who was talking to me
[56:20] and I couldn't see no one. You catching
[56:22] this now? The bride
[56:25] that comes forth is identified with
[56:27] music. Introduced with music and he says
[56:29] it's the sweetest music. Over and over
[56:31] again you'll find when brother Brandham
[56:33] is calling for even at the end of a
[56:34] service in a prayer line he says play
[56:36] sweetly sweet music. And he said let I
[56:40] heard the sweetest music I ever heard.
[56:42] They're marching perfectly in step with
[56:43] that music. This is a main main theme
[56:45] for me. I want you to see this. The
[56:47] bride walking in step with the music.
[56:52] And he said as they went, they went and
[56:55] he said he watched them go by. Then I
[56:58] heard a rock and roll band coming.
[57:02] Notice music. First he hears music, then
[57:06] he sees the bride. Now he first hears
[57:08] music. And when I looked over to my
[57:10] right side, coming up this way, coming
[57:12] back here from the churches of the
[57:13] world, each one carrying their banner
[57:15] from where they were from, some of the
[57:18] dirtiest looking things I've ever seen
[57:19] in my life. And when the American church
[57:22] come up, it was the awst I'd ever seen.
[57:24] Heavenly Father's my judge. They had on
[57:26] those tattletail gray skirts like one of
[57:28] them barroom girls with no back on it up
[57:30] here holding up like a gray looking
[57:32] piece of paper and like a hoola dancing
[57:35] paint short bobbed hair smoking
[57:37] cigarettes and twisting as they walked
[57:40] to rock and roll.
[57:44] I hope you can catch the symbolism.
[57:47] Okay, you see the picture, brother's
[57:49] seeing this in a literal vision. And the
[57:50] vision is not just playing out in the
[57:52] sense that he sees things and it's
[57:55] imagery, but now there's music to it. It
[57:57] has a theme to it. It has a sound. It
[57:59] has a score. And he hears sweet music
[58:01] and he the sweet music. As he looks, he
[58:04] sees a holy group of people coming, the
[58:07] bride marching perfectly step with that
[58:09] music.
[58:12] And then when the scene changes, he
[58:14] first hears rock and roll
[58:17] and then it introduces and it brings
[58:18] forth, he says, the dirtiest looking
[58:19] things he's ever seen in his life. And
[58:21] they were twisting and moving to that
[58:24] rock and roll.
[58:26] It's not just a challenge to be on beat.
[58:30] You got to you want to be on the right
[58:31] beat.
[58:33] In other words, it's there's a certain
[58:35] rhythm to the word of God. There's a
[58:37] certain sound. There's a certain climax
[58:39] to it.
[58:41] something that God's trying to
[58:42] accomplish. And you can't just take you
[58:45] can't just have music a as the place of
[58:50] the music that God desires.
[58:54] You can't just have church
[58:56] to say that we had church.
[59:00] It's something important.
[59:02] M music is a very important thing.
[59:07] All of you might, some I say all of you,
[59:08] some of you might have your jam, right?
[59:10] Your hype song, particular song you
[59:12] really like. You have your favorite
[59:14] songs. You have your top 10. You have uh
[59:19] you have your playlist for work. You
[59:20] have your playlist for working out. Is
[59:23] anybody listen? I mean, it's it's 11:33.
[59:26] I've read some real bangers. I've I've
[59:29] dropped some really really good stuff
[59:30] today, and I just haven't really gotten
[59:31] a lot of amen. So, I don't know. I'm
[59:33] trying to find a like, yes. Yes. I've
[59:36] got a workout playlist. You know, maybe
[59:38] just one amen, but you know, who knows?
[59:40] Maybe none of us subscribe to Spotify
[59:42] Premium and we can't stand the
[59:44] commercials.
[59:46] Let's stand to our feet. I'm done. And I
[59:49] get an amen.
[59:53] Amen. Musicians, as you come,
[59:57] play skillfully today.
[1:00:03] With God's help, we will continue to
[1:00:05] explore
[1:00:08] the themes of music. I am not going to
[1:00:11] endeavor to elicit a playlist
[1:00:15] or a certain meter or rhythm or style
[1:00:19] that you ought to adhere to.
[1:00:22] I think if there's
[1:00:24] if there's a takeaway from this today,
[1:00:26] you'll find that music can be totally
[1:00:29] and completely God.
[1:00:31] and music can be totally and completely
[1:00:34] the devil
[1:00:36] and that there's there can be such a an
[1:00:38] overlap and such a gray area and really
[1:00:40] what we need according to the message of
[1:00:42] the hour is the Holy Ghost
[1:00:44] because if we could just use a phrase to
[1:00:46] describe the kind of music that
[1:00:48] motivates the world we could say rock
[1:00:50] and roll and whatever that might be
[1:00:53] there's even even amongst musical uh
[1:00:56] historians and academics and musicians
[1:00:59] there's an argument as to where it
[1:01:00] started and what it is purely. So, leave
[1:01:03] that to the academics if we could just
[1:01:05] say as a phrase, there's a rock and roll
[1:01:07] that is the sound of the world. And then
[1:01:10] there's a a music that resonates with
[1:01:13] God. That's a it's pleasing to the Lord.
[1:01:16] [Music]
[1:01:17] And brother Ram says, "Rock and roll
[1:01:19] music will catch if you don't have the
[1:01:20] Holy Ghost, it'll catch your attention
[1:01:22] that quick." So, what is it we need? We
[1:01:25] need the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:27] We need the Holy Ghost to navigate the
[1:01:29] minefield of music. You don't need
[1:01:30] someone to sit there and tell you, well,
[1:01:32] it's only songs sung by brother Brandham
[1:01:35] between these years.
[1:01:38] Like, we know this is when Leodysia
[1:01:40] ended and this is when the bride age
[1:01:41] began. So, you can only sing songs that
[1:01:43] he sang during this time because he gave
[1:01:44] his uh explicit approval to them. I
[1:01:47] mean, that's you're just going to you're
[1:01:49] going to drive yourself crazy.
[1:01:52] What we need is the Holy Ghost to
[1:01:53] navigate these things. Song leaders and
[1:01:55] musicians, they should take their lives
[1:01:57] seriously, their sanctification. a a
[1:02:00] pastor even in his and how that he works
[1:02:02] together with the song leaders and
[1:02:03] musicians for the song service and the
[1:02:05] songs we sing. We should take these
[1:02:06] things seriously because God loves it
[1:02:10] and we want it to be sweetness to him.
[1:02:13] Let's let's pray today. Our gracious
[1:02:14] heavenly father, we thank you for the
[1:02:18] preservation of the word of God. This
[1:02:20] Bible so complete
[1:02:23] covering so many things that we could
[1:02:25] take a study of music even in the
[1:02:27] context of human history and we could
[1:02:30] use only scripture
[1:02:32] and build a great knowledge of music.
[1:02:37] And Lord, we could see that music was
[1:02:39] there with you in the beginning in a
[1:02:41] pure form. That even when you created
[1:02:43] Lucifer,
[1:02:45] this star,
[1:02:47] he had musical instruments associated
[1:02:50] with him in his creation within his
[1:02:51] skills and talents. And there was
[1:02:54] worship in heaven.
[1:02:58] But after the fall, Lord, we see that
[1:03:00] it's the the seed of Cain.
[1:03:03] They begin to develop and cultivate
[1:03:05] musical culture and fashion instruments.
[1:03:08] We see it featured prominently in
[1:03:10] heathen worship and in Babylonian
[1:03:12] worship. But yet, Lord, you never did
[1:03:14] forsake it. For we find music present in
[1:03:18] the deliverance of Israel. We find music
[1:03:21] in the establishment of worship in
[1:03:23] Israel. We find that you have harps. We
[1:03:25] find that you sing. We find that when
[1:03:27] you redeem, when you build again, you
[1:03:30] will build us with instruments.
[1:03:33] And father, in the end, we sing singing
[1:03:35] and we worship and praise. Even in the
[1:03:37] eternities where the seraraphim sing,
[1:03:39] it's an endless chorus.
[1:03:42] I pray, Father, that you could help us
[1:03:45] in this greater spiritual sense that I'm
[1:03:47] pointing to. Lord, be that bride who's
[1:03:49] in step with your word. And we use this
[1:03:52] concept of music maybe to understand
[1:03:54] better what it is you're doing in this
[1:03:56] hour in arranging and composing and
[1:03:58] directing. May we endeavor to know the
[1:04:01] sheet music. May we pray for revelation
[1:04:03] to know our turn and our part. And also
[1:04:06] Lord, as an extension of this, may we
[1:04:09] use music appropriately.
[1:04:11] Lord, I I don't believe that there's
[1:04:15] I believe that we have to be very very
[1:04:17] careful
[1:04:18] with the overt
[1:04:21] [Music]
[1:04:22] separate
[1:04:25] and secular worldly music that's out
[1:04:27] there.
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:31] Lord, there's musicians and artists and
[1:04:33] themes and genres, Lord, that we could
[1:04:36] put under this banner of Leodysian, a
[1:04:40] Leodysian score.
[1:04:43] Lord, may we not be seduced into
[1:04:48] the melodies of the world to take on its
[1:04:50] maladies because of tick tocks and
[1:04:53] soundtracks.
[1:04:55] Just take inventory, Lord, of our lives
[1:04:56] and our hearts. keep our hearts clean
[1:04:58] and pure because it does water our soul.
[1:05:02] These musicians and these artists, Lord,
[1:05:04] it waters our soul. Help us, I pray. I
[1:05:06] ask all this in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:05:08] Christ. Amen.
