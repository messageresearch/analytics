TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so again in this introductory sermon on the subject of the joy of salvation of the subtitle is the first principle you might notice it's spelled a little bit different than the principles we see here in the scripture and that's because I'm wanting to look at something as far as a principle but the first principle we're drawing a little bit here from when Paul says that you need to be taught again the first principles of the Oracles of God here in Hebrews chapter 5. and I know that's a very familiar scripture I know even for myself as I look back at the number of things that we've ministered in the different times we've ministered throughout the entirety of our ministry this is a scripture that we've looked at quite a bit leading into chapter six it has a tremendous amount of weight for me personally I think it has tremendous relevance to the message and the things that brother Branham was teaching us especially if you look in terms of the revelation of who is this Melchizedek and his tie-in to Christ and so these are very familiar scriptures even today as we add some layers to this and can be extremely familiar scriptures and precepts so I don't believe that there's necessarily anything new or mysterious that you should be looking for just if anything just some reminders of the things that we believe and some encouragement and I want to start with uh Psalms 51 verse 12 just to kind of build this uh this subject of the joy of Salvation And it says in Psalms 51 verse 12 restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit now this is again a very familiar scripture to us we know that it's uh of David's exclamation and his his prayer and his cry after the time of his failure with Bathsheba and this he even speaks of how these let these bones that you have broken Rejoice again let joy and gladness return unto me and he prays this prayer and he cries his heart is crying out restoring to me the joy of thy salvation now we could just take this scripture within its context and preach almost endlessly on David's attitude David's sin David's attitude repentance um and and all that what's meant in this idea of the joy of salvation but what I'm wanting to introduce at the beginning just so that you uh maybe it's only just to help me but I want to share this in the beginning that Joy Godly Joy is connected with his salvation when David says restore unto me the joy of thy salvation we can certainly take from this that the psalmist is writing and it's expressed to us that this Joy can be interrupted that this Joy can be lost as it were and so there's a there's a there's a joy that comes with salvation there's a joy that comes with the deliverance and whatever it is that we could take David's joy to uh that God had done he associated with God's Deliverance with his salvation and he says whatever enthusiasm that brought whatever joy that brought I've lost it for a season it's been interrupted it's been taken away from me so part of David's prayer and his repentance was not just merely to know that whatever judgment was passed and that he could move Beyond this but there was something that he had lost and it tells us that the joy God's joy that comes with his salvation is something that can that can be taken away from us and I'll say just for a season but the the main thing I'm wanting us to look at and identify is that God's salvation produces Joy that when you are enjoying his salvation when you're participating in his salvation uh God's salvation produces joy and one thing I found in the scripture that was I kind of I said new to me I just had never thought of it this way is joy is a characteristic of God and and you look through the scripture and there's a few different places where God is rejoicing and it's interesting to see that God rejoices in obedience and then at the same time he says I'm going to rejoice in punishing you so I it's it's a characteristic of God that God rejoices and and God has joy and he says in different places in different places I Will Rejoice Over You So This Joy Of This Joy that David This Joy of thy salvation it's not just the Salvation that's of God but the joyous of God and in Luke chapter 15 verse 10 Jesus and giving the parable of that which has been restored and and that lost sheep being restored back he says likewise I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one Center that repenteth and so this it just at the outset just very briefly there's this strong connection between God and joy and even here it's connected again with salvation David says restoring to me the joy of thy salvation Jesus and give you this parable of this lost sheep he says that when one sinner repents there is joy in the presence of the angels of God just as David desired Joy at the time of his repentance Jesus saying when there is repentance when there's a heart that's turned to him when there's a soul that is saved not only is there Joy on Earth but it resounds in heaven and so there's a strong connection between Joy God and salvation and now in the uh on the subject of the joy of Salvation I will in doing in looking at this subject we will actually I'll kind of we'll be tying it in maybe if the Lord would lead to the Christmas season uh you may be able to be able to tell by my color scheme uh that there may be some ties into the Christmas season we'll forgo Christmas this year but we will we will look at the thoughts uh that we associate with Christmas hopefully bring a greater love and appreciation for the things of God through it but this is a series that's about salvation now not maybe in a traditional way of when you think of well being saved and being saved and maybe some of the real uh it not a series on salvation where we're just going to keep visiting the same thing of being saved being saved being saved but really taking a step back and asking ourselves even though it may not be in depth it may just be looking at it to cause ourselves to think and to ponder but it's a question of what is salvation uh there's things that maybe we don't actually think about we just know that it's happened to us and we go forward but we haven't really looked back and thought what were the consequences of this uh event in my life and even ask ourselves what is salvation what does it produce and but mainly my focus will be on its connection salvation's connection with joy so we could ask ourselves what is salvation how is it that I am saved how are we saved what do we save from they say I'm saved I'm saved I'm saved from my sin well what are we safe from how what am I saved for what's the purpose in my salvation it says a lot of questions we can ask about salvation and as I move forward in this I would say that I'm not I'm wanting you to be an examiner with me today I just want you to invite you to stand with me in my shoes as we look at the word of God and let's look at it together and and in doing so it's not so much that I'm trying to preach something at you for you to receive but I want us to all together look at the subject because I feel that I'm preaching to mature Believers preaching to those who have these things understood and are Fellowship in these things have experienced salvation so we're just together as uh participating this together looking at the subject so I'm not preaching it to you we're looking at it together does that make sense and in this uh as a thought as I've been mulling over it on the the joy of Salvation that phrase just really stuck with me and just felt like it clicked so I wanted to use that as the title uh it is there's so much to be said about salvation there's so much that could be ministered on it but there's so much about salvation that we take for granted and there's a lot about salvation that we just assume based upon things that we've heard and based upon things that have been presented and I find that this is maybe a little bit of an aside but trying to use it as an example that there's things that I've heard preached and I've heard that's been that brother Bradham said and when I've when I've heard it I've it sounded really good to me and I liked it and you could see kind of this connection to the scripture and then you might even find yourself repeating it and quoting it and then you go back and you want to find exactly where it's at and you can't find it it could just be matter be a matter of being a poor research researcher but there's things that you realize I never even took time to I just have built a lot of assumptions on this I never went back and looked at the foundation of it I never even considered what the implications were and so this is something that even on the subject of Salvation there's a lot of things that we not only take for granted but there's a lot of things based upon it the truth of it that we just assume not that our assumptions are wrong but what we've done is we've just kind of adopted that thinking and it's true and it's and it's real but we've never taken time to get it down to its real core to understand it and maybe even more more importantly I'll say this about salvation there's a lot of ways that salvation is diminished and you think well how can salvation be diminished well if I could say that whatever salvation is then it's for it's for someone in particular and if there's a way that you define salvation to where it loses its its particularity to that group or to that person and you begin to attach it to a lot of other things and a lot of other people it really loses its value for the person that it's intended and so I'm using I I guess I just need to come right out and say it I don't I'm not necessarily trying to hold it back but I just don't want to get pulled down this this channel that we use the phrase saved and we even use it in the sense to identify a group of people that we would say Well they're not they don't actually have the Holy Ghost or they're not actually uh the bride but they're saved and we take the category of Bride and everyone else who saved and if you if you're not careful what you've done is you've created this hierarchy or these categories that if they're not absolutely accurate and scriptural you've devalued something somewhere and you take the real truth to Salvation you say well well these are all saved and these all have it and these are all this and then this category over here you create this category of bride I think the way I've used it before is like the the super saved or something and they're and they're they're saved like everyone else is saved but they just they're just bride right and we don't we almost begin to lose the real significance of Salvation when we so quickly attach it to all sorts of different categories or Define it to try to fit some model where we're trying to make sense of things and so I believe that the greatest mistake we can make is diminish what salvation is or misplace it scripturally in terms of where it actually resides and who it's for in Romans chapter 1 verse 16 I share this to express how that we ought to never diminish salvation Paul says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek so he said he's saying there's no dishonor in the gospel of Christ on no level is there any dishonor is there any uh any part of it that we ought to be ashamed of nor is there any disappointment in the gospel of Christ for the believer Paul is saying I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ the gospel of Christ will not disappoint you the gospel of Christ will not let you down and there is no dishonor in the gospel of Christ and Paul says for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth so it's to the Believers that there is no disappointment or shame in the gospel it is to the believer that it's the power of God unto salvation and then he breaks down that barrier of distinction between Jew and Gentile uh it is it is the power of God but look at it from this perspective when he says it is the power of God it's God's power that accomplishes salvation so the gospel of Christ is the power of God what does the power of God produce it's if we can look at it from this senses God has power God's had power what but what is its first result what does it produce what is Paul saying that is so beautiful about the gospel of Christ that we ought not to be ashamed of it because it produces salvation if that's what the power of God produces we do not want to ever diminish or devalue salvation because it's the first result it's the first fruit of the power of God makes this statement I'm just sharing it out outside of the context of the larger point he's trying to make says what more what could you achieve that would be greater than your salvation what is greater than salvation he even uses the example of if God could give a man something better outside of a wife then salvation than he would have done it and so he said the greatest gift out of Salvation is a Godly wife so that means the greatest gift the greatest thing is salvation that places it on this level that if you're going to be and if I could say this that that that very statement joins very beautifully true salvation and marriage because that is that is what that is the real the real depth of the fullness of Salvation as it relates to the bride but what more could God do or what more could you achieve that would be greater than your salvation nothing it is the greatest and the sermon is shamed the brother says in any disciple of Christ who has come in contact with him in Redemption and salvation and those are those are in Redemption and he says and salvation has come into his heart Redemption and salvation are two principles that are joined together he says Redemption and salvation is coming to his heart he is the possessor of God when salvation is coming to your heart you are a possessor of God when a person is saved that means they possess present tense eternal life and cannot pass into cannot go into judgment do not even go into the same category of death as the unbeliever to be saved is the utmost it is the greatest it is the greatest thing God could give you a person who has where salvation is coming his heart says he is a possessor of God very hard to think of a greater way to play salvation than to say that someone who has been saved now possesses deity and in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 9 we looked at this here very recently I believe he says but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak we're going to touch on the beginning to hear of Hebrews chapter 6 as it flows from chapter 5 into chapter six Paul didn't structure it with chapters but in the convenience of references it's been written out chapter 5 chapter 6 but in this larger thought of Paul said I have more to say about Melchizedek I have more to say about Christ but I can't do it we need to revisit the first principles and he's saying let us go on to Perfection he says now for you and he kind of drops down into what happens to those who can't go forward he says but I'm persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation uh the phrasing that is used it's things that are linked in the chain of salvation things that are joying to it things that are connected to Salvation so we have salvation and there's things that are in the chain of Salvation now if there's things that are linked to and connected to Salvation in the chain of Salvation what we don't want to do is break the chain and say well you have salvation over here and you have all these other things over here some as some sort of accessories to Salvation and that we can just swap Out Accessories or this accompanies it and we can add this and we can have that but the way that Paul is saying is that it's linked to they're in the chain of Salvation so if you have salvation there's a chain in things that are connected to it that works itself out we read this uh I think in the series on Divine Healing this is again just lift looking at this salvation from a of valuing it he says in the message of paradox he says the church has become just growing up just like I was going to speak tonight upon the unveiling of the one true God so in the idea of a church maturing and growing he says but I think it's a little too long he says I noticed the people after nine o'clock they get Restless I thought I would just wait until sometime at the Tabernacle I got something else on my mind maybe for tonight to bring a message of Salvation that's what we're trying to do here now you Minister Brothers we missed Divine healings right and and you could see that from this I think what we talked about before is they put so much emphasis on the Divine Healing part and they left out the other parts he says this old Dr Bosworth who just went home to Glory down here recently he used to say Divine he owns a bait that you put on the hook you never show The Fish Hook you show them the bait he hits the bait and gets the hook so that's the way it is Divine Healing just draws the attention and he says and then salvation is what we are after and this particular uh sermon here is he says that we're trying to we want to bring a message of Salvation tonight as he refers to it as tonight as this is in the the businessman's breakfast he says I'm going to bring a message to Salvation he says salvation is what we're after anyways we're after the strength of the body of Christ now what what is the strength of the body of Christ it is salvation the strength what makes the body of Christ who she is is that she has this designation of having been saved from sin having been saved from Darkness saved from something there's been a separating out that's what salvation speaks of he says we're after the strength of the body of Christ so if I could just add this Romans 1 in Hebrews 6 and these other statements together let me just say this salvation is a beautiful thing that ought not to be diminished and we're better knowing more about it and understanding it more clearly so in uh now taking us to the title for today the first principle let me visit for a little bit the first principles and the and the concept of first principles anybody ever heard of the concept the first principles anybody here no no somebody was scratching their ear almost drew me offside so well we're going to introduce something then today uh anybody read Aristotle Descartes any of the philosophers okay a little bit some well you'll find it and I think it's Aristotle who's given the credit for kind of introducing this thought process it's kind of a way of thinking about things uh Descartes also used it you'll find it in philosophy but you also find a lot of other branches and disciplines mathematics and other things where you have to kind of come back to this idea of the first principles and let me Define it this way the first principle is the basic assumption that cannot be deduced any further so you could have something and you could have like a body of ideas or some sort of system and if you want to understand it and you want to take a look at it you begin to kind of pick things apart and find out what is it at its core and how can I distill this down and break it down to the point where I can break it down no further so this becomes the basic principle or the first principle that there's all these things that happen afterwards or these all these things that are a part of it but if I'm going to Define it in its most simple way what is the basic most basic as we could say assumption or or a fact of it's a that cannot be further distilled down I think Aristotle put it this way the first basis from which a thing is known and so this is what first principles is the first upon what basic element is something known it's the primary cause of something or the basic elements so when you have this concept the first principles and you look at it you establish you want to establish this fundamental truth that stands on its own that's what a first principle is it stands on its own no matter what's been added to it no matter what assumptions we make the first principle something that stands on its own so you want to establish this fundamental truth and then separate from it all the assumptions that you've you've made about it so that instead of instead of it being surrounded by a bunch of assumptions you get down to the core and say this is the first principle this is this is the basic elements so it's a matter of identifying foundational truths or fundamental truth that stands completely by itself that we do we have not added in our subsequent knowledge or added in our subsequent experience or added in our subsequent assumptions we just come back to the root to the core to the principle if I could uh maybe make the mistake of using an example as a few examples I'm thinking of but the one I thought of the most yesterday was the example of music when it comes to music in Western and music all melodies basically are typically are built from 12 basic notes I got a nod from the musician here so we're it was more kind of like are you sure you want to say that brother Aaron I took it as a nod but let's just say for sake of discussion today that there's 12 basic notes that uh western music is typically arranged from and so you could say that these 12 notes are um the the the fundamental elements the the basic material building blocks of music and so identifying these 12 notes and understanding them and learning how to use them and we may call it music theory is is kind of the it's how Melodies and music are written and these and and understand identifying understanding it using these 12 basic notes would be I would say that's the idea of I'm trying to suggest is the ideas of first principles that when it comes to music if you want to understand music You Want To Know music you want to write music you want to play music if you take the concept of first principles you learn the 12 notes and you find the building blocks of music and when someone understands it knows it understands it and can use it they can write music they can play music because they've got all the Legos of music and they know how they work together but someone can play music and write music using Melodies that have already been written or notes that they've just merely learned and they can write beautiful music and they can play Beautiful music but they're not using first principles they're just playing Melodies they've already learned or Melodies things that have already been written they're singing something that's already been sung and so this is what Aristotle would say that someone has learned by analogy they've learned by the assumptions they've learned by the thing that has already been built the composite that's already there but when someone wants to be able to write music and understand music and play music and you really want to elevate your game as it were get to the first principles does that make sense brother Micah okay good he's I get a thumbs up now that's not really ambiguous that's good and you could even use this when it comes to cooking there's people who know how to follow a recipe and they're absolutely amazing cooks and I'll just say it right now I admire anybody that can follow a recipe and especially somebody who's just learned it to the point where you know you got to do this and you got to do that and there's people that are very very very good at cooking because they know how to follow a recipe but then there's other people that understand food and ingredients and the science of cooking and they know what's happening when you do this and they know what's happening we do that I look back in my life and all the times as a kid I love to cook I still love to cook and and sometimes my family says my dad loves to smoke and I go meat me I love to smoke meat and the uh and I look back in the things that I used to do to food when I was cooking it I was absolutely destroying the food because they're you're breaking down the the structure and you're you're handling this too much and you're mixing this too much and you're adding that at the wrong time and all the things that I thought is what went into cooking went against the real science and the real against even the basic ingredients like this is why this is being added and this is why you do this if you don't understand that you can put together a recipe but if you don't understand first principles you're always going to need a recipe but when you understand first principles you can have all the ingredients and put build something yourself and put something together yourself that is going to remain true to the fundamentals that's what can happen when someone understands first principles anybody ever seen and I know this is just I'm taking a flyer here the cooking shows that exist today where they give people a box of ingredients and it's jelly beans and it's fish slime and it's a and it's a shoe shoe leather and they're like make something and they go I know exactly what I'm going to make and I'm going I mean I would probably just put it out there and be like this is deconstructed whatever right and this is and you look at people and they know how to do it and I I know for me when I've seen it I Marvel at how they can take these ingredients and put something together and they can bring something out of it and why because they understand they look at the ingredient go oh this has this kind of quality this is how I can prepare this and they understand the first principles of cooking it's not just what recipe is there in my Betty Crocker cookbook that has these ingredients they understand the first principles of cooking and the ingredients and therefore they know how to work with it this is the idea of first principles is that making sense first principles then is understanding the building blocks in order to build a greater knowledge in order to build a greater experience we read recently in Isaiah 33 6 I think it was last Sunday and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of Salvation the fear of the Lord is his treasure there's a strength I want definitely want you to kisses there's a strength that arises from salvation but where is it manifest in wisdom and knowledge wisdom and not shall be the stability of thy times and strength of thy salvation there's a strength of salvation but it's the subsequent wisdom and knowledge that pours forth from it that is our stability that is our foundation that become our building blocks upon which we can begin to build our experience in Jesus Christ we read this again multiple times the last two Services no True Believers any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God what are the building blocks of a healthy Christian Life what are the building blocks of spiritual strength it is our knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God to me there's something that's pointing back to First principles it's pointing back to understanding things at their basic element it's it's being able to take any assumptions that we have in any subsequent experience and be able to bring it back to its core to its fundamentals to its beginning so that we can be like the musician we could be like the chef who understands the ingredients who understands the principles understands the science behind it I I kept I put it in my notes I don't know how many times I put it in and deleted it but his brother man makes this statement and I've had I've never preached on it but something stood out to me I've kept it for all these years I'm going to reveal it today right now brother Branham said he'd been compiling material in order to preach the second coming of the Lord scientifically and and he says he somehow I want to do it I want to prove it scientifically this coming to the Lord scientifically and I was going to read it just to get us all to ponder how can you preach the second coming scientifically how could he gather research and principles and all these things together and put together in order to preach the second coming scientifically now I think I've said enough that if you want to just start researching it it's fascinating I was going to start singing Take the name of Jesus with you but the song that came to my mind was bring them in and that would have really confused all of us now if we can look at Hebrews chapter 5. I hope that I've been able to establish two things the importance of Salvation or maybe more than two but the importance of Salvation and the concept of first principles and then you know in that strength and joy and these other principles that have kind of being laid around there spiritual health strength being alive this Vitality in in Hebrews chapter five we'll start with verse 11 we'll read our text again uh we mentioned Wednesday night I think it was that the Hebrews were trying to be pulled away from the mystery of Christ uh there was things truth that they had been introduced to there was an experience that they had had in the word of God and now they're being met with all these the these elements of Judaism and all these elements of of the law and these physical tangible things there's something very beautiful uh to the human to be able to know that they can light a candle that they can rub a rosary that they can say a prayer it's nice to be able to kind of check the box right it's nice to know when when things can be completed and you know you can do certain things and so that's one thing about the law that afford that kind of met this human need to be able to say I know that I went and I did this and I did that and there's this the safety and knowing that I've accomplished these particular responsibilities as articulated by the law but then you have this mystery of Christ that in knowing him this one that you have not handled you have not touched this one who is now really the substance of the law that you're to believe upon him they were being drawn back into denying the reality of Christ for the for the the legalism and the physical law that you that their religion the former religion offered them and so they're being enticed by the the carnal laws and by these these physical precepts and so uh that maybe that's an overview of kind of maybe the real thrust of the whole book of Hebrews but now in chapter 5 verse 11 he's wanting to say more about Christ who's called to God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek the Son of God and and these beautiful things he's saying in chapter five is being perfected by the things which he suffered such incredible uh truths that he's laying out in this book of Hebrews he says now of Christ and this mystery of Melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing your Dole of hearing so now he is we want to grasp this here at the start as we read this is they were not able to comprehend and grasp the things that Paul wanted us to say and he says for when the time you ought to be teachers this is really amplifying the Dole of hearing or or him describing the consequences now your dull of hearing and say hey it's a time when you ought to be teachers yourself you ought to understand the material well enough now to where you can teach it he says but if I could go back to the piano lessons this or the music he's saying you guys still need piano lessons when you ought to be piano teachers that and and really anybody who understands you don't have to be a piano teacher but when you find somebody who knows music and they understand the 12 notes and they can play they can play those chords they have something that they can teach anybody about learning music and learning the piano and saying that when you ought to be music teachers I'm needing to teach you again music theory then to come back to the basic elements of things you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and to become as such as have need of milk and not of strong meat now Paul is giving us mouthfuls of things that we could chew on that we could talk about that we could preach about this little little principles of milk principles of meat principles of maturing and being a babe for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belonged to them that are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil I was at all in View and we'll we'll move on to chapter six as we read this but he says that you need to be taught again the first principles of the Oracles of God the first principles are the beginning elements the first thing from which others in a series arise and he says the first principles of the Oracles of God the Oracles of God have a special significance and especially as it relates to what he's telling teaching the Hebrews he says you need to be taught at the beginning elements begin with the first things from which others in a series arise so when you see a series of things and you see things that have happened when you look at first principles you come back to find the first when it comes to pandemics it's patient zero right you come back to that and then even once you got there you want to find out where they got it and it's coming all the way back to the source to the origin the thing that began it all the first that others in a series others in a change arise from so if there's things that accompany salvation when he says there's things that accompany salvation he's using a language that ties back too the first principles of the Oracles of God because these are the things that arise in a series from these first these first principles the first principle is the Oracles of God this phrase first principles of the basic elements from which a composite arises or from which a whole comes to be if I could use the example of speech is you have speech or language the letters of the alphabet are the elements of language and when you begin to you want to teach a child to read you teach them the alphabet first am I getting that right okay I'm just the principal the the bill those are the building blocks those are the first principles of writing those are the first principles of reading is to know the letters their sounds right to your vowels and then you take it a step further and you take those building blocks and you begin to use in some disciplines phonics right and you look at a particular way and there's ways that you approach it but when you break it all down the alphabet is the building blocks it's the basic uh elements from which language or speech or reading and writing comes to be and so when he says the first prince was the beginning elements and that implies basic or Elementary elements of something now think about what Paul is saying then in this he's saying that because he says your Dole of hearing and I need to teach you again the first principles recognize what the consequence the cause and effect their failure to grasp the first principles their failure to fully appreciate the first principles and and to have them really establish kept them from understanding more of God's word if I come back to the example of music there's times when and I realize even maybe in our own families our children are taking piano lessons that they want to be able to play I want to play that song and I want to play that song and I want to be able to play this and I want to be able to play that and you know what they could do they could sit down and they could clunk it out and they could learn to play by ear and bang out though that particular Melody by plate because you could hear the notes but if you really want to be able to play that song let's start all over and learn whatever it is they learn right learn where C major is learn the hand position learn the posture learn the the scale and how things work together that's when you can really begin to learn a song because you'll be playing and instead of just done done done done done done and you're 65 years old they listen to what I can play right and you've been that's all you ever learned to do but then you you according to go wait wait what is that right there that goes somewhere that's right that's that right and they know just exactly how to hit it because they understand the building blocks and Paul is saying I we can't go further you're not just always supposed to be babes right Chopsticks and whatever it is we like to do there's this one song the Entertainer or something and it's like this there's this part and it's like anybody could do that if you really want to play learn the first principles this is what Paul is looking at it's what he's examining their failure to grasp the first principles kept them from really being able to mature in their gifts kept them from really being able to use salvation at its fullness kept them from really being able to grow and mature and they he said I want to share with you the mysteries of God I want to break open things to you but I can't because if I did it would be a mess to you because you don't understand first principles he says these things belong to them that are full age in other words they've matured they mature I'm just using some air some summary language they mature in their revelation of Jesus Christ they've matured to a greater understanding of Christ they have a higher revelation of the Mysteries so what what's been happening the they're using first principles right the understanding of it in their experience and it's not if there's it's not so much assumptions anymore it's not reasoning by analogy it's not this uh just plain music by ear it's not just saying what somebody else said it's not just oh brother Branham said this that sounds good I'll repeat it but it's going back to find what he actually taught maybe that's just a lesson to me as a minister you're going back to First principles then once you understand first principles you don't have just to re-preach what you hear other people preach when you understand first principles then you can really really get into knowing and understanding what God's word is what this message is for not careful all we will ever become as message Believers is an echo chamber of other people's ideas and even an echo chamber brother Branham but we want to understand the first principles have an understanding of these great truths and how they work you base if we could by deduction he's saying if they could grasp the first principles then they would be capable of understanding these deeper things that if you could if you had learned these and placed them if you understood these 12 basic notes if you had the right posture and hand position if you understood the science of cooking if you knew what ingredients you had to do this if you knew what temperature you had to do that if you could understand the basics right there's even things to understand about which way to cut meat and which cuts of meat you need to cook longer and which ones you need to do this and there's a science behind it twitch muscles and everything else that teach you how to understand the piece of meat the the thing that you're cooking okay so the the what I'm wanting to say we could deduce from this is that if we can have the first principles understood then you can understand deeper things that's when you can really really understand and know the deeper things now you can not have maybe the first principles down just right but start making a lot of assumptions and play the Mysteries by ear right and and there's there's still a beauty in it a reasoning by analogy isn't bad there's a lot of power that can come from that there's a lot of deducing that we can do there's a lot of assumptions we've made about the word of God and things that we kind of take and and have benefited us but don't you really want to be built up in the Oracles of God I've really built up in these things and so at the start the the Hebrews were very jealous excuse me very zealous for Christ they had this uh they were Earnest about things but now he's saying they have become dull there was a lot of enthusiasm at first but it began to wane and now they failed to advance they weren't in a place now where Paul's saying man the way you started out had you really laid the right foundation had you really grasped these first principles then you would be in a place now where I could open up to a further mystery but we kind of need to go back up and revisit these things because in the passage of time Your Enthusiasm has waned and you become dull of hearing and now I gotta feed you again milk to build you back up again and I will say that we will fail in possessing the full benefits of Salvation benefits of Salvation by not fully appreciating these first principles if we make the mistake at all of diminishing salvation in any way we can we're going to devalue Redemption if we redefine salvation it means something that it's not if we take it and we add other things to it if we don't really fully understand it and start building assumptions upon it we may be building false assumptions we may be building on the wrong kind of foundation and we may need to revisit it deconstruct it get all the pieces say you got all the pieces to the puzzle you're working in the right Fields you've got everything you need but you need to come back to First principles and look back at the word of God and identify the first principles because we cannot devalue salvation why because it is the power of the Gospel it is what the gospel produces it's like oh well that just sounds like a good Baptist message and all that just seems so simple and Elementary listen you're never going to get past it it's all salvation just Ponder the phrase Plan of Salvation and examine over these next few weeks considered even in the light of the the season that the the majority of the world is is having this Christmas season and if you research it back you'll find it has its roots and acknowledging the coming of Christ and the birth birth of Jesus Christ there this is this is something to think about during this time so Paul continues and it continues in Hebrews chapter 6. verses one to three therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on on unto perfection not Landing in the foundation of repentance now we recognize these first principles it says leaving therefore the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on into Perfection so Perfection according to Hebrews 6 9 is in this chain of salvation things the company salvation let us go on to Perfection it's not you have salvation we're going to leave you here and and now medal in Perfection no perfection's in that chain that chain of Salvation he says not laying again the foundation of repentance so if there's a foundation that's upon which something else is built your Perfection is built on this Foundation we can't separate it out and say well this is just fodder for this group and this is for this is but this is for the bride no the the elect of God the saved of God are built upon this Foundation the foundation of repentance from dead works and a faith toward God so you have repentance Faith doctrine of baptisms baptism laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will be due if God permit so in the book of Hebrews Paul is taking the fundamentals of the law even the very fundamentals of their first principles and showing how Christ fulfilled them something he's doing in each chapter he's taking things that were part of their elements part of their belief part of their faith and he's showing now the very fundamentals of the law point to Christ and Christ fulfilled him and so when he's talking here what he's showing is that these are the principles of the doctrines of Christ and these are the initial basic teachings of Christ you can actually go back and find that repentance Faith baptism laying out of hands resurrection and judgment all of these are the first principles of the doctrine of Christ and all these things Christ taught Christ in his teaching is going back to the building blocks of the law he's going back to the fundamental principles of Law and he's teaching on repentance and faith and baptisms laying out of hands the resurrection and judgment these are all basic teachings of Jesus Christ things that Christ taught but also the teachings of Christ and this going on into Perfection requires an understanding of these first principles of Christ the the idea of faith repentance Faith baptism laying on of hands Resurrection judgment these are all fundamental things you'll even find these very fundamental elements are part of in the book of Acts in Acts chapter two just refer to it real quick I'm going to be skipping some things brother John that and and I want to come back I'm coming back to Philippians so I'll just I'm just going to refer to Acts chapter 2 real quickly when Peter's preached on the day of Pentecost he begins after he establishes who Jesus is according to the very Prophecies of David he starts with the resurrection he says him have God raised up Jesus has raised him up and then as he preaches this sermon the men are perked in their heart and he says what what must we do in other words what must we do to be saved from this damnation that's to come he says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ every one of you and he says save yourselves from this untoward generation what is he preaching judgment and they that gladly received there's the belief there's the faith we're baptized and so you'll find these very building blocks which are part of the building blocks of Jesus ministry when he says go you into all the world preach the gospel he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned he said verily verily except the man be born again he cannot enter the kingdom of God these are all the first doctrines of Jesus Christ and these are the very things that Paul is lifting up in Hebrews chapter six he's saying you need to come back to the first principles of the doctrine of Christ because he preached repentance he preached Faith he preached baptism he preached Lana hands he preached Resurrection he preached Eternal judgment these are all things that are there in the book of Acts at the Genesis of the church the very building blocks of Christianity if I could say this the first principle of the Pentecost or the first principle of the book of Acts as salvation through Jesus Christ and some people don't even have that right but they want to write a book of Acts but you don't have the building blocks for a book of Acts if you don't have salvation if you don't have salvation right you cannot Cobble together by ear a book of Acts it's just going to be an impersonation there was in music there was I think it was in Italy back in the Disco days and I I didn't have the eight tracker box set or anything but it's just something that in music theory I think is where it comes up is that I think it was in Italy a real popular Italian singer knew that the people in Italy would just fall for anything that sounded American and wrote an entire song that was just random English words and it became a major Billboard top number one hit in Italy and it was just nothing nothing made sense it was just English sounding gibberish and it became a huge hit I've just decided just described modern Christianity just a bunch of Christian sounding gibberish message sounding gibberish and it makes the number one billboard hit why because people don't understand the language they just like the sound they want to know that it came from Brother Branham they want to know that it came from the Bible they want to believe it's this Rambo idea of Jesus or whatever it is and it doesn't make sense whew but the very first principles of the book of Acts is salvation through Jesus Christ brother Brown says in Revelations chapter 4 part 3 says after Pentecost they wrote a book of what acts of the Holy Ghost acts a-c-t-s is that right what does the Act start off with the first thing to enter into salvation Acts 2 38. there's your first principle where does the book of Acts begin Acts 2 38 where does it all start Acts 2 38 this is what Paul is pointing to in Hebrews chapter 5. this is what Paul is pointing to in Hebrews chapter 6 the first principles I and I believe that though Paul is saying it to the the Hebrew church this is something that would be instructed to the individual Hebrew because these are things that we must be certain of as we're looking at this together and we're identifying this together in such a way towards not I'm not trying to preach to you a message to Salvation in order to get you saved but we're standing together as Believers arm and arm heart together we see eye to eye we're standing together in this and we're looking down into the word of God together at this beautiful subject of Salvation And The Joy that's connected with it and we're asking ourselves we're questions to look at it and understand it better in Philippians chapter 2 verses 12 and 13. Paul says wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling it it strikes me I say even more so now than I had earlier how that this is what the Hebrews ought to been able to do Paul is saying when you ought to be teachers in other words you don't need me anymore but you can teach you've arrived at that stage now where you can even help others Advance he is telling the Philippians that I won't be there so now in my absence you've got to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling you're now at this park that this ready to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it as God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure out maybe it didn't strike me this way when I was putting uh these things together last week but now now maybe it there's this part where there's this really really hard pivot but I'm still wanting to go down this line of considering salvation on its basic level but he says work out your own salvation with fear and trembling salvation is an individual affair with man and God Alone this is something that you have to have anchored this is something that you have to have the first principles it's not enough to just be able to go to the church website and look up the mission statement and see the first principles of the church and say oh they believe in God the Father they believe in God the son they believe in the Holy Ghost and these three are one and just make sure that the catechism's all right and make sure everything's just lettered just right not not enough you can't find safety in the church you're not gonna be able to find safety in a denomination there's only one place where God has put his name and that's and that's under the shed blood it's in Jesus Christ and only individuals can enter therein this church as a as a local congregation cannot be put under that in such a way toward if you manage to walk in through these doors at 3736 West Walhalla Phoenix Arizona now you got the address then there's a way there's no way that in just doing that do you come under the token this is something individual this is something that you've got to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling secure the Salvation which Christ has purchased and aim at the destiny of it so Paul is saying I think it's so awesome work out your own salvation with fear and trembling it's not just merely make sure you're saved but it's work it out let it be something that comes forth let it be something that you not only have secured I've secured my salvation but now aim at the destiny of it aim at the fullness of it implore yourselves on the things which accompany salvation what is it for it is God which work is in you both too willing to do of his good pleasure working out your salvation with fear and trembling is not in itself just making sure you're saved yeah you better do that you better be sure of it you better have that anchor but once you know you're saved don't lose your Edge once you know you're saved take that salvation and get to the first principles of it want to really know how it works what it is what is it for and Paul gives us this beautiful secret he says for it is God which worketh in you I need to work out my own salvation that doesn't mean you're going to earn it doesn't mean you're going to somehow figure it out but now that you are possessors of it now that it assured that no that in order to work it out it's God that works in you both the willing to do it is good pleasure God working in you his will this is the this is what a company salvation biller Brandman the sermon identification says but this Plan of Salvation is an individual affair with you speaking in tongues as a gift of God dancing in the spirit is the presence and glory of God but for you to let your character be mold into the image of God that he projects himself and you are his Idol walking on the earth the expressed image of him The Plan of Salvation is not tongues it's not dancing in the spirit but your character being molded in the image of God toward you are the expressed image of God now there's things there's tongues they're a gift of God death in the spirit is the presence and glory of God but the Plan of Salvation is an individual Affair where your character is molded into the image of God where he projects himself the expressed image of him he says you're his Idol walking on Earth this is where we can see that the first principle of Pentecost first principle of the book of Acts of Salvation through Jesus Christ foreign Acts Chapter 4 verses 10 to 12. I'll try to go very quickly here I don't want to keep you long I know it's already been a long week and it's Sunday the first day of the week Acts Chapter 4 verses 10 to 12. I think I'll be able to get to everything though today brother John thanks for keeping up with me there in Acts Chapter 4 verses 10 11 and 12. here's Peter once again coming back to these first principles the very things that Paul pointed back to we often speak of the Rivalry between Paul and Peter but the Paul spoke things and taught things that come right back to the things that Peter's teaching in the book of Acts it says be it known to you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified him God raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you whole now there's some that have taken in learning Christianity by ear they've made it the name of Jesus of Christ of Nazareth to where it's just this nomination or appellation it's just the name of Jesus Christ and so it's just Jesus right just Jesus Christ and they just and their their whole idea of speaking Jesus is just literally saying the name and they think that that's that's what does it but he when he says that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth there's to get to the fundamental elements of that the core of that and the first principles of that is not just to say the name but to know the nature behind it the power and the authority of it he says this is the stone which was said it not of you Builders which has become the head of the corner now that would be a shocking statement to the Jews but he says this is the foundational principle this is the first principle of the law this is the beginning and this is what you rejected but now he's becoming the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other any other than Jesus Christ for there's none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved you talk about first principles there's no other name under Heaven whereby men can be saved whereby we must be saved we can put it this way Jesus Christ is the only way to be saved it is exclusive salvation there is no salvation outside of Jesus Christ this is the these are the first principles now we could even pose these questions and we'll just pose them as we close uh hopefully run through these last few things pretty quickly here but if Jesus Christ is the only salvation who is Jesus Christ how much thought do we even give to that if it's the only name whereby we must be saved what does save mean we've talked about it already a little bit like what does it even mean at the end of the day how how is it that I am saved and they these may be a lot of the questions that we begin to ask ourselves when we're confronted with this truth that salvation is only through Christ but these are the foundational first principles that Paul is pointing to salvation by Christ he says in Romans 5 11 and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement we joy and God where is our joy come from where is our rejoicing in God it's through our Lord Jesus Christ because it's through Jesus Christ that we have received the atonement for a Jew to be writing this is saying that all that the law spoke to all that the law pointed to is now in my possession through Jesus Christ and that is my joy that is my rejoicing through Jesus Christ salvation by Christ and Christ Alone these are the first principles these are the things that we must have as President says it's an individual Affair between you and God to understand these first principles to work out our own salvation through fear and trembling is to know that it's been secured through Jesus Christ and then aim at the product of it I came across this statement last week that uh just I didn't know where exactly where we'd fit in this morning I just I just put it in because I wanted to end with this brother in the message third says oh are you enthused about your experience with Christ oh are you enthused about your experience with Christ when you become dull of hearing maybe it's through the repetition of things when you become dull of hearing maybe the melody doesn't excite you anymore you ever had a song that gets played too much and you really really loved it at first but by the time you heard it for the umpty time you don't like it anymore but man at one time you really really loved it you've lost your enthusiasm for it it's just become background noises become too common there's a lot of things that we have to realize that maybe we've allowed the echo maybe we've allowed the assumptions maybe we've allowed all the plane by ear uh to bother us if I I just feel I should be better at music and understand this better but there's things that you listen to as a layperson there's things that you hear and you really really love a song and you really think it's great and you really like that hook but let a musician listen to it and sometimes I'll be like oh that's bad that's not good at all I had somebody say one time we really really new music and a very very talented gift and said all Christian artists are just those who aren't good enough to make it in in the secular world and so you start listening yeah maybe this is kind of crummy music right but I mean they're getting more and more talented more and more gifted but the point is there's things that you listen to and you just kind of like the Rhythm or the hook right but then to a musician they could hear something be like what do you notice what they just did they're like yeah no no just said you know join to the world yeah but then you hear something different Arrangements different Melodies different notes it means something to somebody who understands the first principles of it that understands what's behind it and the thoughts behind it says are you enthused about your experience with Christ if we're not maybe it's because we don't really understand the first principles maybe we just learned it by ear and after a while it gets old to us and we're no longer able to use the same basic truths to keep producing beautiful melodies because we only learned the recipe all we're able to do is keep making the same thing over and over and God said a prophet God said a prophet God said a prophet or Jesus is coming one day Jesus is coming one day and all we can ever do is cook the same meal over and over again but we never got to the real core the real fundamental ingredients of it so that we could begin to put together things when I preach red here in a rainbow trout it didn't say that we only needed to eat rainbow trout I got a text message but Philip asked how the trout was I never responded because I didn't have trout but it's there's so much more to be enjoyed now when we say that it doesn't mean you're going to run out and find a new ingredient somewhere but with what we've been given if we could understand better the first principle understand what we've been given it's endless what this beautiful combination can be in melody in music and Harmony and a Great Masterpiece whether it be music or whether it be feasting think about all the things that we have when we can understand the first principles and then you begin to say I'll never lose my taste for that I'll never lose it why I will always remain enthused because that's the beauty of understanding something in its truth in its fundamentals and that and and therefore in its depth toward now I will never how can I lose my enthusiasm for something that's endlessly enthusiastic that's endlessly inspiring that's endlessly enthusing and if I could say this coming to the title for today the first principle Christ is the first principle this is our Bedrock this is our fundamental foundation in Revelations chapter 1 verse 8 he says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty whether we're talking about music whether we're talking about food within uh as ways of example there's things that'll always be the core elements you ever heard of the Holy Trinity and cajun cooking yeah ever had it isn't out and I said these are the three main ingredients they have to be there and it's the same in certain things where you have to have certain ingredients they're always fundamental it's not this like in Texas they got this bravado that if it has a bean in it it can't be chili right I used to be that way I'm not So Much legalistic Anymore but there's these ideas not chili yeah you can't have a peanut and chili and if this is you you call that this you call this that why because there's these rules and these constructs now when it comes to the word of God there's fundamental truths and there's things he says that I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and ending which is which was which is to come here he's at the center of it all that if you can begin to understand him and see him this is how you can see Christ in every verse of the Bible this is how you can look up and begin to see Christ in your brothers and sisters when you begin to understand the first principles when we just picked up somebody else's personality when we're just following a man and a man's ideas then we're always looking for that man that idea of the man this idea of the person this idea of the symbolism and the ideology and that's what we're looking for and if we don't see that particular makeup in somebody we just reject them but when you come to know Christ then you can begin to see Christ in so many other places but the Brandman referring to verse 11 he says the first and the last the Alpha and Omega that's all of it that's the one true God the voice and the word of God reality and Truth is at hand let me say first principle that when it all comes when you're going to whittle it all down let's just we look at our lives today and say all right let's just start now and let's break it all down if we're really going to get aggressive it's going to go all the way back to in the beginning was the word and you come all the way back that's the one thing that we can say we know is truth the Alpha and Omega the begin and the end the first and the last that's all of it reality and Truth is at hand and in the same chapter John writes I think it's verse five and he hath made us Kings and Priests this is the introductory Revelation that's coming that's coming forth at this yep verse 5 verse six Revelations 1 6 and he hath made as Kings and Priests unto God and his father here's here's the the bubbling forth of seeing this great image of Christ and brother bam takes this in chapter one of the church age book he says he hath made us oh there are certain truths that we need to emphasize and this is one of them he he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord I believe this is part of the truth that must be emphasized he says oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them what is it he hath made us what does it mean what are we what does it come down to Salvation is his duty when it says he hath made us if they get down to First principles we're going to say he hath it's his doing salvation it's his doing salvation is of the Lord salvation is the Lord's that's what the scripture says to us that salvation is the Lord I I took some things out just even and maybe I'll just sow the seed for the future service when when Jesus what does it mean Jehovah is salvation that's what even that's what it means Jehovah is salvation this is who that the Lord's salvation is the Lord's salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for purpose oh I love this getting down to the root getting down the core of the first principles he's redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for purpose in other words it's just not well I'm saved well you're saved what are you saved from oh I'm saved well I'm safe from this well what for why he's done it for a purpose we are King spiritual Kings oh we're going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom notice the emphasis on the first principle it's God himself he's the immutable truth he's the foundation musicians if he'd come what is it nehemiah's claims a beautiful story of the books being opened the revealing of the word restoration of the word back to the Jews he says the joy of the Lord is your strength at the open of the word when there was weeping there was sadness there was despondency there was this horror at what had transpired but he says the joy of the Lord is your strength I'm wanting this to be before us as we venture into these next few Services I have I kind of have a little bit of a road map laid out I'm just open to however the Lord would lead open to whatever opportunities there are so you just keep praying but maybe over these next several services this is something as we build up to the to the this Christmas Even Christmas time that there's the joy the joy of salvation he says the joy of the Lord is your strength the mess of the token let this be before you and in your hearts whether it be a dark time sister Elizabeth was sharing with me just the difference in prices this year over Thanksgiving we see it in gas prices maybe we don't notice it in other places but she says usually this time of year she can find a 10 pound bag of potatoes for 98 cents and she had to buy a five pound bag for five bucks and it I've not it wasn't a moment of weakness but I felt this horror of how difficult things can be now how hard it is on a lot of us when they've counted on potatoes being 98 cents for 10 pounds and now they're getting half as much for five times as much how that can kind of creep in and people are looking at the income and they're looking at the outgo and they're wondering how are we going to make it work right how are we going to how are we going to make things work how are things going to go forward what does the future look like don't find your joy in those things brother Brandon said God is your joy message the token God is your strength knowing the message knowing the truth that's our sufficiency he's my all-sufficiency and him all things I have need of is in him that's our strength My Help Cometh From The Lord you Christians Look to Him for your joy Look to Him for your strength look for him for your happiness he is my peace he is my joy he is my love he is my life could you even Echo that from your own heart today could you even I didn't just even invite you now to repeat this refrain yourself from where you sit today find something in here that you can say he is my peace can you say that he is my peace he is my joy he is my love he is my life that that's what I'm gonna derive in this time when they're saying peace on Earth and Joy to the World he is my joy he is my peace he's my love he's my life and that's the joy of salvation oh Hallelujah he is my love he is my life [Music] hallelujah hallelujah the first principles do we have them is there more we can learn about them there's more that I could understand about them is there a way that I could take just this thought kind of escapes me but just this picture somehow God was showing me to where there's just God is God wants to bring himself into our view [Music] and I'm so glad that he has allowed himself and how great he is to be manifested in certain basic fundamental truths that if we could know them and understand them and and be able to properly place them then it's just it begins to enrich and further places in the body of Christ and just as a way of I'm not trying to backtrack on anything but it's just point of emphasis whether it be Aristotle's use of analogy to understand things you can know truth that way there's things you can learn through that plane by ear there's a lot of people who play by ear and they're phenomenally gifted and you'd never know they just play by ear but there's certain limitations right anybody play by ear no certain limitations and so in referring those things it's no way it might Terry not that there's no good there's no good in that there's no good in this but but there are things that God wants us to know told us to play by ear [Music] personally and be familiar with it and if there's a lot of things in our lives and maybe this is just echoing some of the similar burdens that we've had in some of the recent services that you whether it be the kind of the thrust behind red herring or rainbow trout maybe there's a lot of things that we've kind of just quickly we haven't really mastered we haven't really we've just kind of moved on from we've made a lot of assumptions and we find ourselves this great big huge economy and it's way too fast for us and we're not able to keep up maybe we just need to slow down a little bit in this economy of God because there's great truths there's things happening beautiful season to be living in It's a Wonderful the greatest of all ages this is our golden hour this is our golden this is a bright age but if it all doesn't seem to make sense and there's all these different voices just take a step back and kind of come back to First principles kind of get built back up in these things again we remind ourselves of them so that we can begin to look out and with an eye of understanding begin to experience things that maybe we've thought we've always understood let them become more vibrant and More Alive surely this is something we could do together [Music]
