TRANSCRIPT
========================================
above the things of the world and we in this the condition is moab but now we're looking at the opposition and i'm wanting to use orpah as a type of the opposition that you face in coming to the living bread of life that you face when feeding on the living bread of life remember that opposition in john chapter 6 where they came looking for the loaves and they wanted to eat so their natural belly could be filled and jesus starts preaching doctrine that's like well hey you know just feed this bread but jesus was actually sharing things that would be that would be the ultimate for the believer to accept the word the word of god to take him at his word because jesus knew i'm not always going to be breaking bread one day this body is going to be broken and and do you have a revelation that's going to cause you to stay faithful to this when those things happen so we're using orphan now as a representation of the opposition that we face and so this is in the in the book of ruth and i'll i'll point this out here in a moment i we're just taking from verse 14 uh and and 15 a little bit maybe we'll read verse 15 here in a second as well but when ruth makes her decision says ruth clave under naomi and orpas now take kissing her mother-in-law this is this is the opposition and the contrary example and the pressure that ruth would have been facing in the moment that she makes her clear-cut decision and it would even maybe be something that is following her as she goes further with naomi so i want you to think of this orpah represents opposition and it represents opposition to us there's something embodied in the example of orpah that represents the type of challenges that we face or the opposition that we face as believers who are pursuing christ with everything that's in us now i'll go back over these uh maybe some more statements here in a moment let me just say again orpah is a type of that lukewarm laodicean make believer i know that sounds really really aggravating and maybe a pretty good uh put down but it's not meant to be that way it's just to characterize a particular attitude a particular mindset kind of lukewarm neither hot nor cold a make believer in that they can profess and say all the right things when it comes to truth but yet they don't go all the way there's not a total surrender to the things of god so it's important for us to recognize now that if ruth represents us as the bride of christ this characterization of orpah is relevant to us can we just agree right there in relay and a few principles from before so now verse 14 and i guess i'd like to read verse 15 as well because i i think it helps give some of the context and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed her mother-in-law but ruth clave unto her here's this difference now between ruth and orpah ruth cleaves to naomi we're going to see here in a moment what ruth says beginning in verse 16. but now naomi characterizes orpah's uh kiss behold thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister-in-law so even though the scripture just says she kissed her mother-in-law there's something very clear that is signaled in doing this and naomi says she's gone back under her people and unto her god so there's a separation now from what naomi is doing and what ruth is going to purpose to do saying hey you know your god will be my god so we know there's this great contrast in that so this is some of the statements that brother braddah makes about orpah she's a type of the church normally the church formal so we can say maybe the nominal church the formal church she's a type of the church he says in another place she's a type of the modern church so think about some of these characterizations of orpah the formal church nominal church the modern church he says a type of the lukewarm church that once started out a type of the church that won't go all the way so this is this is express this is something that we could see in the scriptures that paul talks about and peter talks about and different ones talking about people who start in the faith they begin they they're professing they're believing in jesus christ they're claiming you know we really believe and we want to go all the way but certain things come up and they don't go all the way in so this is a type of the nominal church a modern church a lukewarm uh church experience and he says what a sad thing remember it never spoke her name anymore she was excommunicated because of her decision so orp is not mentioned again and he's using a unique phrase he's saying orpah is excommunicated because of the decision she makes in verse 14. now ruth and naomi don't say oh well we'll never mention her again never never never breathe her name again it's something that nao uh orpah's own decision excommunicates her he says the lukewarm church the lukewarm believer as each believer represents the church and he talks about the different representations and this is a statement we didn't get to last time he says this about orpah but because of popularity orpah will kiss the church where he says kiss the message kiss christ goodbye and go back to where he was hollowed out of orpah lukewarm excommunicated so orpah being lukewarm she's excommunicated she exit communicates herself from the promise of god by kissing the message goodbye kissing christ goodbye and going right back to the place that they were called out of and could you imagine that god calls you away from somewhere and you start out this is what god wants me to do and you know that god is calling you out of but then you come to this place this is because of popularity but you can put any kind of personal pressure in there any kind of temptation or weakness and money women popularity anything that you want to put in there it'll cause a person to kiss the message kiss christ goodbye and go right back to the place they were called out of and he said this is a lukewarm condition that would cause somebody to do that now this is at this point now i'm wanting to take a step further i think those things for those of us who are here together last wednesday those would be things that would be uh kind of reviewed to us and i want you to take some uh just some dramatization in your mind to think about the relationship that not only naomi would have had to ruth and orpah as daughter-in-laws but the relationship that ruth and orpah would have had together uh they marry brothers and in marion brothers they fight who's whose dad was had passed away i'm sure that there was some care that they gave to naomi and then in the passage of time as each one lost a spouse i i could imagine that these three became very close together i had a lot in common and as even naomi expresses it that you have dealt kindly with me you've dealt kindly with me in the passing you've dealt kindly to my husband or my chi my sons you've dealt kindly with me and she says i would that god would deal kindly with you as you've been kind to me so i'm wanting you to think about how close they would have been personally and how they they were family and they would have been we say family by marriage but then through the difficulties that they faced it would have bound them even closer together i i remember it causing me to remember one time for mother's day my sister got our mom her mom our mom got her a mother's day card that said you were like a mother to me and i thought mal isn't that profound that your mother is is like a mother to you and you say success mom you did it you were a mother and you're like a mother and so sometimes i'll say that about my own family somebody will ask me about david or matthew and i say well they're like a brother to me and you can read into that however you want but it's uh there were they were more than just uh related by marriage this would have been something that something would have bonded them together to the point to when the mother-in-law says hey i'm going back to israel their instinct would say we're going with you whereas some daughter-in-laws might be like about time no finally so there was a closeness there and i want you to consider that but now there comes a separation this is a part that i really want you to think about two different decisions are made ruth as her decision begins to get expressed and what it means to cleave she begins to express these things in verses 16 and 17 and even to uh in verses 16 and 17 it kind of expresses ruth's prayer in cleveland and desire in cleveland to naomi and all we hear is orpah kisses her mother-in-law and naomi says she's gone back to serve her gods and back to her people so different decisions are made that place ruth and orpah in two different categories now although the bible is silent as to the the what would have happened in this moment in the relationships that would have existed or even the opposition that made it may have been expressed at this time i want to take the type based upon what orpah types the word the word expresses to us and shows us how orpah becomes the opposition to ruth now the bible is silent to it and i wouldn't want to try to read into the story till we go away from here saying well did you know that orpha said this about ruth the bible doesn't tell us what she said but we're what we recognize that orpha types the modern church the nominal church the former church the lukewarm church the make-believing church and so since that's what orpah types then we can look to the characteristics of the modern church the laodicean church the lukewarm church the make-believe in church and look at their characteristics to begin to understand how the orpah condition and the orpah attitude works against ruth that must have been really profound because i could just see heads exploding you know figuratively i need to write that down i need to post that on instagram later so i'm going to begin with the statement from the church age book now notice how he writes this in particular and i'm relying very heavily have a few scriptures in here but relying very heavily on the characterization of the modern church the lukewarm church as orpah types and then you've got to recognize the bride as ruth it says there's a true church and a false church so where you can say orpah and ruth the true church being roof the false church be an orpah there's a true vine and a false fine again there's our categories but of course that false church false vine body will always try to usurp the position of the true church and contend that she and not the elect are the real and authentic right i mean the false vine doesn't say hey we're the false vine yes we are we're just better than you all right that's not what they say they say we've got spirit yes we do we've got spirit how about you right and then like we got more spirit we got more spirit and that's what the false vines always get they believe that they are the true vine and they believe that they are the true church and and so it's not like from this position of where the fall is fine we just like to be this way i i think i remember someone shared a tweet with me one time it said something about this church of satan and um and the kind of the response was you know these this church of satan you know they lit you know what do you call people that literally believe in satan and i think was the church of satan that responded with christians i mean christians are the ones that literally believe in satan not necessarily the church of satan and so this uh with respect to the false vine and the false church and i'm church they don't they don't call themselves false fine tabernacle that that wouldn't that wouldn't make uh that's not where that that's not what the characterization is so as he's bringing this out he says the false vine will try to kill the true remember it doesn't have to be physical though it wasn't ages past the false fine the false will try to kill the truth so this is a characterization of the false church false vine that is how it was in the book of acts so you can go in the book of acts and find all the different instances where the disciples were persecuted killed right and lives threatened so he says it was that way in the book of acts that is how it is set forth in the seven ages and that is how it is declared in the various epistles and we can see that without needing to go into the bible could you agree tonight being bible readers we know in the epistles in the book of acts these are the things that the true church faced this is how that has been that is how it is now that is how it will be it can't change so this false vine and true vine and what seems to be a competition what seems to be a conflict it is a false vine wanting to kill the true vine not because they believe that as the false vine they're better than the true but it's because they believe they're the true vine and these others are the false vine now we we need to be honest with ourselves when we begin to think about uh christianity and the history of christianity and and the uh different uh words that were used for the campaigns of the churches throughout church history where they literally went out seeking to gain converts to the church and if they didn't believe they would commit genocide like this this is part of the history of churches this is part of the history of the catholic church this is part of the the inquisition the conquering of north america was you would show up at the doorstep of an indian civilization and say you need to accept christ except they weren't saying it in their language and if they didn't seem to agree with this christ that they were preaching they would kill all of them and why did they do that not in the name of the church of satan not in the name of the false vine not in the name of the antichrist they did it in the name of the church or in the name of christ in the state of christ and and so this is how that spirit acts and he says that's how it was then that's how it is now if you could just take that and begin to ponder that that spirit is alive today then it's very sobering to think that way and then he gives the example of in genesis chapter 4 and the process of time abel and cain bring different offerings and how that came out in being wrath that god vindicated abel's offering killed abel he says but one cain was evil being the fa his father being of his father that wicked one while abel was righteous before the lord so here's one that's wicked by birth and here's one that is righteous by revelation again there were two children from the flesh of same same parents they were the twins of isaac and rebecca so now it's not just in embodied in cain and abel now think of how close this gets between jacob the the twins of isaac and rebecca one was the elective god and the other was reprobate remember romans 9 according to election both worshiped god in every single case there was worship of god involved true vine false fine cain abel uh jacob esau in each instance there's worship that is is offered in every case the evil hated the righteous and persecuted the righteous in some cases the evil destroyed the righteous now this is i want you to ponder these characteristics now true church and false church you say well brother aaron he's not saying anything about modern church or lukewarm church well we'll get to where this is tied more closely together but i want you to recognize that there is a there is anointing of a false church that will try to kill the true in every case the evil hates the right just persecutes the righteous in some cases the evil destroyed the righteous he says but notice they were planted together they lived together they both made claims upon god and worshiped god with respect to the relationship between ruth and orpah and we both married brothers and they both have the same mother loan they both are starting out to go back to israel it's not that either one of them could have claimed to have been more righteous than the other but they're starting out together they're making claims upon god together they live together they plant they're planted together and now there comes a point to where we recognize there's a different anointing on the false vine and a different life in the true vine now brother branham in referring to and i took the scripture out in revelations chapter 2 i believe he says he's talking about the synagogue of satan and how they blasphemed and then it says it but this is what your opposition is and what you're overcoming how they'll kill you and they'll persecute you so he's looking at this um these dynamics of persecution and opposition as it says let me just read it real quick i know thy works in tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and they are not but are the synagogue of satan fear none of these things which shall you shall suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation ten days but be thou faithful unto death and i'll give thee a crown of life so it's talking about tribulation persecution opposition and it says it's not that some that say they're jews but they're not they're of the synagogue of satan and notice how this is characterized i think this is very enlightening these of satan's synagogue were not blaspheming god in this instance though that goes without saying but they were blaspheming the true church isn't that interesting to think that well i'm not i'm not blaspheming god per se but because of who they were persecuting and who they were trying to kill they're blaspheming the true church and in doing so they blaspheme god and they're called blasphemers and of the synagogue of satan in doing so certainly as cain persecuted and killed abel because he cain was of that wicked one and as the dead formal judaic followers jesus said they were of their father the devil tried to destroy the christians in the first few years of the first age now this same group he says the false vine is even more strongly attempting to destroy the true believer in the second age so it's not just ardent zealous jews that are now trying to kill the church but now it's hybrid into the christian church and now they are intermingled in as a false and true vine begin to overlap and get mixing together and he says they're strongly attempting to destroy destroy the true believer in the second age that antichrist now catch this spirit i really really want you to identify that this is a spirit this is anointing that antichrist spirit is growing the group that inched its way ever so slowly in the church by its deeds nicolaitanism no longer fears exposure but is openly organized in a group remember that characterized moab of its own assembling and is coming against the true church in undisguised hostility it's not even disguised anymore like once you once you're comfortable with your group once you're comfortable with your organization once you feel that you've got strength in numbers in your assembly it doesn't have to be subtle anymore it doesn't have to be disguised hostility say now it's just open open undisguised hostility towards the true believer now i want you just to begin to ponder this because i'm intentionally holding something back so we kind of have this uh moment in the end where it kind of all clicks and makes sense realize oh okay now that makes sense so now that i kind of got your attention it took me 20 minutes but i did it uh 30 minutes actually now that i'm looking at the clock what if you if you notice this dynamic that's taking place where people get to the point where they're so comfortable in their organized group in their assembly that they can be openly hostile uh be hateful and mean and spiteful and and vindictive and oppressive so this is a spirit that could come upon people and they're not saying i renounce christ and the nature of christ and i don't believe that christ i don't believe in christ so therefore i can be mean and angry towards you they they will take the nature of christ and pervert it and say that they are being christ in this unbridled open hostility towards the true believer again let's not lose sight of the fact that i'm using this description and these terminologies that describe the modern church the lukewarm church the formal organized church which is which is more associated with the spirit and not any particular structure organization it's a spirit and how they will kill the true hate the true persecute the true try to destroy the true attempting to destroy the true believer even coming against the true church in undisguised hostility continuing in the same chapter of the sumerian church age this last age now now it's coming to the laodicean age this last it started with the fires of a pentecostal revival which was genuine and true okay never forget that that was genuine and that was real it says they organized it right back instead of taking the word they took their own ideas and did just what every age has done substituted the manual for the word they had a manual they had they had something written down they had their doctrine had their theology they had it all kind of tidied up and figured out and they had their compendium they had their their works they had everything together and that became their uh their truth and their authority and they used the manual instead of the word just you step outside the manual and see what happens so now as we picture this a real genuine move of god as god begins to move people kind of extract from that a particular ideology a certain system a certain order and they kind of sum it up in a body of something that they call a manual and now he's saying now you now that the manual's been uh put together if you step outside of the manual watch what happens you're out brother and they'll persecute you and blame it on god huh can i get a witness yes this is exactly what happens you step outside of their framework outside of their ideology outside of their doctrine outside of their manual they you're out brother and they will persecute you so this is their nature this is nc they're going to persecute and when they do it they're going to blame it on god either blame it on god or they're going to say you know god made me do it or this is god that's causing me to do it and how they love their organization this is moab again how they love their organization no wonder they are second generation pentecostals and since god doesn't have any grandchildren they're just children of their fathers known by their creeds in form of worship and i don't think this that the independents will escape this don't think as message believers we don't escape this you have got to have your own personal experience with christ does not have grandchildren if you are born into a perfect message church you are not by default a perfect message believer you must be born again you've got to have your own experience and your own birth he says and this is heavy i was actually not wanting to read this far or read this much i wanted to end with they blame it on god but when i read this i was like well we got to read this they can talk about what used to be but they can't produce it once they had the lightning but about all that is left is the thunder my once they used to have something they had lightning but now all that is left is noise thunder and this is the condition of what he calls second generation pentecostals second generation believers second generation anyone who has not experienced the genuine themselves and just comes along afterwards after a pattern's been laid down a move of god has happened and things begin to take place and all you do is kind of fit within the framework of the manual and you operate within the parameters what the manual says and everything is organized and everything is assembled together and everything everything seems to be functioning correctly he says if you step outside of that they'll persecute you and blame it on god and he's saying the problem is these are second generation people they're operating in the carnal dynamics and they may even be able to talk about what used to be and how god used to move but really they can't produce it and when they do it's just thunder and thunder's still a lot to scare people now brother branham is making reference to revelations chapter 13. he's making reference to a lot of different things in this portion but i wanted to narrow it down in the fourth seal bible is talking about this false church this organized church and and the modern church he said that's what they do just persecute do we just think about the bullet points that we're listing now about this church persecutes kills destroys undisguised hostility persecute and blame god he says that's just what they do they just persecute them could you imagine a church being called persecutor fellowship you know that's just what we do and that's like their tagline you know come persecute with us come be a part of persecute fellowship that's just what we do you're either with us or you're against us and if you're not with us we're going to persecute you and that's kind of how they get people to get on board i don't want to be persecuted let's go to that church he said that's just what they do just persecute just the same thing the churches makes just as fun of the true bride of christ as rome ever did think at the very time listen march 21st 1963 think about at the time when this separation is taking place at the time when the word of god is going to be coming forth in a way to really show how christ has been rejected and denominations have taken hold and ideologies have confused the true nature of christ and muddied up the scripture he's saying the churches today churches make fun of the true bride just as much as rome ever did how did rome make fun of her well they didn't just sit there and kind of wag their tongue at him and laugh at him they persecuted him to death so they will do they do the same thing they persecute the churches make just as fun of the true bride of christ as rome ever did now this is a great point i realize now just how much easier it is for me to make this transition rome persecuted the church to literal death and when i say literal i'm not using it figuratively though that's how we use it today right literal is figurative i literally lost my mind where'd it go you know i literally died when i heard that that's figurative now i'm using literally literally in that they literally took the lives of christians if they professed christ they didn't believe the way of the church if they did things that were contrary to the manual they would kill them the spirit is alive today but they won't kill you physically they'll kill you in an assassination of your character ostracization from the fellowship they'll there's things that they can do to try to destroy you and kill you and there's even a consequence that is a spiritual death that could take place within this as we can maybe go a little bit further in it but i want you to begin to recognize that as they make fun of the true bride of christ it's spiritual persecution the continuity with what we've been ministering on sundays and how these 200 million million demons that have been loosed at the river euphrates that worked in a political realm to persecute the jews during the second world war now works in an ecumenical religious realm to persecute the true church right so this is this is the angle and and this is i want you to catch it if it's in that way as a spirit and it's not a literal death i want you to begin to think more spiritually about this and catch this this is very very important if if we have preached this in such a way to where now you have gotten to the point where you begin to arm yourself against orpah and you actually have a list of orpas in your notes like oh that's definitely brothers so-and-so and you're getting a list together stop for a moment it's not a person it's a spirit okay i i want you to pause a little bit and ask yourself what how how how is this going to be expressed how is it going to be made manifest it isn't the person it's the system it isn't the person it's the organization so it's an anointing not a person so we begin to talk about orpah we should not think about any particular person we should not think about any particular organization we should not think about any particular church because in doing so you could be acting like an orpah and you can start criticizing and persecuting and running down who you call orpha but you're the popcorn the kettle black because you're the one with the critical spirit you know i don't like them they're critical and and you know what they'll just sit there and they'll talk about you and they're just critical that i guarantee right now they have their hands on their hips right now talking about how critical we are all right and not for a moment recognizing the irony so it's not the person it's the spirit when we when we take this that's orp we talk about rejecting the word not going further in truth it represents a way of thinking it represents a way of acting it represents a way of justifying carnal actions it represents a way of justifying excuses and justifying decisions and justifying the lack of morality and and giving reasons as the way they are and then an attitude that tries to make a distinction between why you're doing things and why they're doing things and a way to to complicate a person's uh thought process that cognitive dissonance to make themselves feel all right it's not the person it's a spirit and if a person is caught up in a move to where there's there it's hostile and it's persecuting it and it's aggressive and it's trying to tear something down even some kind of move that would try to defile the truth of god and tear down the truth of god's prophets and and change history and and try to explain away the bible and explain away vindication you have to recognize that's a spirit and though it may be embodied in a group or an assembly or even have a name attached to it remember it's a spirit it's not the individual it's not the person it's the organization it's the system it's an anointing and this is this statement here is going to going to help us to look at this a little bit differently brother brahman kinsman redeemer now in kinsman redeemer he's where he says orp is a type of the lukewarm church that started a type of the church they won't go all the way it's a sad thing she was excommunicated because of her decision lukewarm church lukewarm believer who kisses the message kisses christ goodbye orpah lukewarm excommunicated so notice all those very very heavy difficult statements about orpah in the message kinsmen redeemer and now he says you are sons and daughters of god who have received the holy ghost now if you're orp a bunch and turned away but if you went on through the holy spirit you become sons and daughters now it's maybe a little bit of a garbled statement if you're the orpa bunch and turned away now he's done something and i want you to catch this even though it may seem to be somewhat of a a thought that got cut off you are sons and daughters of god because you've received the holy ghost but orpah is characterized as having turned away he says you've went on through the holy spirit and become sons and daughters of god so nobody can claim that they are truly sons and daughters of god unless they've been born again so the distinction and the categorization now is not so much well you're an orphan you're a ruth but you have a group that are know that their sons and daughters of god buy a new birth experience and then those who've turned away from it or who have not yet gone through the baptism of the holy ghost so we can say that the difference between ruth and orpah is the new birth and don't miss this this is very very important i want you to catch this in galatians chapter 4 verses 28 to 31 paul is bringing out these similar things as we've already seen kind of the distinction betweens and distinction among parents and children he says now we brethren as isaac was are the children of the promise paul is saying that isaac was a child of the promise and abraham's other son through hagar was not a child of the promise ishmael was not a child of the promise you have isaac who is a child of the promise you have another son that came from that father but he's not a child of the promise and he says but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now so you have those who are born after the flesh we'd have an ishmael a product of a union a child of if we could say of the church a second generation this is not a child of the promise and he's making the distinction one is born after the flesh one is born after the spirit and the one who's born after the flesh still has the ability and has the capacity to persecute and who do they persecute people who are born after the spirit because he's saying just as it was then a child of the flesh persecuted him that was after the spirit being isaac even so it is now it says nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bond moon shall not be heir with the son of the free woman and he can he continues says we are children of the promise so we who are elected of god and receive the baptism all like oh she's saying you are children of the promise you have been baptized into christ you have been put onto christ put on christ so by election you are a child of the promise if somebody is not born again they are living after the what the flesh and all they can do is walk in the flesh and he says it very clearly they that are born after the flesh persecute those that are born after the spirit and he picks this up and the sea does not air with the shock he says just like paul said here and he's referring to galatians 4. did not the seed of the bondwoman persecute the seed of the free woman and so does the seed of the denomination persecute the genuine grain it's always got to be that way they'll not be heirs together they'll not associate it together they're absolutely two different promises two different times two different peoples all together one is the bride the other one is a church no comparison at all with them how do you become part of that bride by election what gets you into that body by being baptized by one spirit that's what puts you into that fellowship that's what puts you into that body but notice the characterization now and i'm i'm using it in particular about orpah and the opposition that ruth is going to face is that seed always persecutes the genuine grain so it's got to be that way why because they're two different promises two different times two different peoples one is the bride the other one is the church so you have the bride ruth you have the church orpah orpah is the opposition to roof just as the church today is the opposition against the bride the opposition in the same way that moab called to israel to get them to compromise and come together the same way that we can begin to dramatize taking the example of what the modern church does today how that orpah is represented today as having this attitude and this animosity in this bitter hostility towards the elect where it says they persecute that's what they do they persecute they make fun of the bride they hate the righteous they persecute the righteous they destroy the righteous they will kill the true they blaspheme the true church they attempt to destroy the true believer and they come against the true church in undisguised hostility again the difference is election but i want you to catch this those of us who are when are all of us when we are born we are born after the flesh right it should have been my biggest amen all night when we are born we are born between a man and a woman that that is that is that gives us our nature of our parents and then we're raised in the nurture of our earthly parents and the society and the culture that we're raised in and this produces the natural being and in doing that it is not that's not what manifests sonship that's not what manifests our relationship to christ if you are born and you are ordained to life there is a predestinated seed in you even from the moment that you're born but you do not manif you do not become you do not come into relationship as a son until you're born again and that's that's when there's a division that takes place so whatever happens from the moment that you're born after the flesh to the moment that you're born again we live lives that look a lot like the children of disobedience now what paul taught us we're in times past we walked like in the course of this world we acted like the children disobedience we were like the children of wrath but yet we weren't ordained to that you couldn't tell our lives any differently so this is just kind of the attitude check this is the point point where we kind of check ourselves and realize that we do not want to make the mistake of acting like orpah and acting like the lukewarm laodicean believer by using the language of the laodicean believer i had some friends one time that would tell me that when they first came to the lord and began to serve god that they would see somebody in the world and they would actually make the comment revelations 3 17 that's what they would say about people and and it was just it was misguided zeal and that their lives were completely changed and they recognize wow look how lukewarm the world is and look how sinful they are and look how they're acting and they're rich and increased with goods and and they're but they're blind miserable poor wretched and so they had a phrase that they used to talk about how blind and miserable and wretched these people on laodicea were not realizing that that is the dominant characteristic of somebody in laodicea to look at somebody and call them out on it like that what kind of this arrogance and this this air of superiority and they had their reckoning that they're humbling and they realized it so we have to check ourselves that the word the nev the word the truth never arms us to be the persecutor the truth never arms us to be hostile and so in the church age book brother branham writes this now we can see why there were two vines one true and one false now we can see why abraham had two sons one after the flesh that persecuted isaac and one after promise now we can see how that out of the same parents two boys came forth as twins one knowing and loving the things of god and the other knowing much of the same truth but not the same spirit hence persecuted the child that was elect now it's embodied in jacob esau now we see here even in the promise as he brings it out even in a more deeply one after the flesh one after the promise though they may seem to be a part of the same church believing the same thing how there can be a division amongst them where one is born after the spirit the other one after the flesh but not of the same spirit and hence persecuted the child that was elect notice this characteristic of one that is not born of the spirit they persecute the elect they are they are prone to they have the tendency they have the unbridled capacity they can engage in undisguised hostility they can actually persecute you and blame it on god and this is very profound god did not reprobate for the sake of reprobation he reprobated for the sake of the elect it's a very very profound statement reprobation was not for the sake of reprobation but it was because there was an election then this is a statement i know you all heard this before elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm elect we often use it this way bride cannot persecute bride we heard it that way too this is where it comes from elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm you like it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect all those reprobates are religious they are smart they are of the cane line the serpents they build their babels they build their cities they build their empires and all the while calling on god they hate the true seed and they will do all they can even in the name of the lord to destroy god's elect ones and i i left this in here because i think it's important but they are needed what is the chaff to the wheat no chaff no wheat but at the end what happens to the chaff it's burned with fire unquenchable and the wheat where is it it's gathered in his garner it is where he is the wheat has its day coming just as much as the shuck does the wheat has its ultimate vindication she's going to end up in his presence while there's judgment that awaits the the rest of the wheat plant so there's a ultimate rest that the believer must have that the wheat must have that one day it's going to be gathered into his garner it is where he is but then there's a judgment that awaits those that what hate the true seed do all they can to destroy the elect ones and he characterizes them they persecute the child that's elect they that one after the flesh persecutes isaac and he says elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm like it's the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect i'm just wrapping this up here i'm just finishing i have just one quick scripture to read but i'm just making my final point the difference between and orpah as we said before was the new birth not the first birth but the new birth because by first birth they're both moabites by first birth they they have an attitude they have a way of worship they have systems and organizations and the difference now as as we have been trust that we've been very deliberate in kind of following the same line of language we can begin to see this difference and you begin to see how orpah becomes the opposition to ruth but remember it's a spirit it's not the person it's a spirit it's the system it's an organization and notice in galatians chapter 1 verse 13 could have read also in corinthians where paul makes reference to it in another place but just one verse to make this point galatians chapter 1 verse 13. for you have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that this is paul speaking all right this is paul do we believe he's a christian we believe he was caught up in the third heaven believe he's the apostle of god he's a prophet of god he's in the body of christ listen how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it here's paul being so bold as to say i beyond measure persecuted the church i beyond the measure destroyed the church i i went so far as to hunt them down and persecute them he even says later on in the book of acts i was holding the code of stephen while he was stoned he is openly declaring he even says one place he blaspheme he says but i did it ignorantly right so here's paul now if any one of us would have seen paul if we would have lived in that they would have been a lot like the other uh the believers that the day says well isn't this the same guy that is killing us and they're a little bit reluctant they had to break out of this mindset that it's the person and not a spirit and realize that despite his blasphemy despite his persecution despite his destroying if there's an election on the inside of him it breaks the hold of that spirit and he became a son of god and it shows us it's not the person we never hate the person we hate the sin don't hate the sinner hate the sin don't hate the individual hate the organization don't hate the person hate the system don't get all mad at a church in the name of the church of the people in the church realize there's there's attitudes and anointings and there's deep histories sometimes that make people the way they are and we should be a people like paul who can be empathetic when other people can be very angry and very bitter and very hostile the statement is elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm you like we say bride will not persecute bride bride will not harm bride you know why do you know why the elect don't persecute anyone you realize that when it says not persecute bride or elect cannot persecute elect it doesn't mean but oh man just wait till you see what they do to the non-elect tell me do elect persecute non-elect no do we sometimes yeah what does that tell us i'm not walking in my election elect do not persecute elect because they don't persecute anyone that's not what elect do they don't need to show hostility don't they don't need to waste they don't need to blaspheme the false church or tear it down or run it down to the individual's in it so elect do not persecute anyone but as individuals without the birth we can do it as individuals who walk after the flesh we can do it amen this is our challenge for us because maybe in some ways i just want you to ponder it maybe in some ways orp is our flesh maybe orpah isn't the neighbor next door maybe orpah isn't this church or that system or that organization maybe orp at the end of the day is just how much our carnal minds sometimes fight and resist against how god deals with our souls and the opposition is right within ourselves and we have to realize at some point wait a minute orpah doesn't have my best in mind or does it want me to succeed orpah doesn't want me to overcome orbit doesn't want me to grow orpah doesn't want this this truth to be made manifest in my flesh and you realize the opposition sometimes is so close it's not even without it's within ponder it tonight and think about this opposition and i'd want you to take away this as the bride we're not hostile towards anyone as the bride we don't persecute anyone we stand for truth and we live we live truth truthfully and we're honest with ourselves so you know sometimes maybe i don't walk in my election sometimes i don't have the right attitude and sometimes the orp is in me we want to overcome it let's stand together tonight you can come musicians but a little bit of micah let's bow our heads in a word of prayer if you need prayer tonight i believe that you can lift your hand before the lord and express what's in your heart to him by lifted hand it it may be lord i need an attitude adjustment my flesh my orpah is very robust right now it's very strong my my critical nature getting the best of me we could be honest is to say lord help me in my bitterness help me my hurt and my pain and he'll help you i know he'll help you so with hands raised tonight before i'm asking god to help you say lord i want to take the way with your despised few lord i want to do what i know a believer ought to do no matter how hard it is on my flesh no matter what the circumstances and consequences may be the opposition i may face lord i i want to go all the way with you i want to do what's right you just ask god to help you tonight heavenly father as we stand in your divine presence tonight with hands lifted up we're using honesty tonight not instinctively to ask that you would heal us of the wounds that we have received at the hands of orpah but lord first we're asking that you forgive us for being we're doing as your scripture as it wanted us to do to remove the beam from our eye because perhaps lord it's our being our orpha beam has caused us to see a sliver in someone else we realize lord that if we're ever going to be able to endure persecution and rejection estrangement and hurts at the hands of others and false anointing then you need to we need to have you resolve our own bitterness if our spirit's going to remain clean if we're going to have a clean conscience if we're going to be able to experience the full liberty that we ought to as christians we need to be honest with you tonight lord there's times when i have a language of a carnal believer i have the attitude of someone who's born only after the flesh the lord may we in confidence knowing that we're children of the promise be able to like be like naomi speak a blessing [Music] but i know it's hard i know it's difficult i even know lord there's times when the anointing requires that sin is called out there's times when we must be able to stand on principle and tell someone with plainness of speech that they're making a mistake or that they're an error lord and we can never compromise truth for the sake of making someone feel good but truly lord that never gives us the right to have the wrong spirit towards somebody else and then we never justify a nasty attitude by saying it's our righteous indignation may we never justify persecution and hostility and blame it on you so give us clean hearts lord purge us lord of these things these dynamics try to make us to belittle and run down but even in our particular hurts and pains that we experience at the hands of others it seems it would be so easy to just be able to say oh well that's just because they're an unbeliever that's because they're unregenerate and that's because they're reprobate but still be able to intercede for them say lord forgive them for they know not what they do lord help me if there's anything lacking in my approach and my attitude and my service lord help me to wash them of their own pain help me to wash them of their own blindness lord help me lord [Music] i think that's what love would do [Music] all right it's the very unique thought that overwhelms my heart how people sometimes have a hit list names of people that they don't care about or wouldn't bother them if this happened to them people maybe that they're convinced that they're not elect or convinced that they're this that or the other oh god we just we get rid of that thinking lord we love truth we stand by truth if one is a defile of the truth if one is an enemy to truth we're taught that that man who opposes truth and hates truth that that person is our enemy but the bible teaches us to love our enemies may we not forget the other part tonight lord just cleave to you as ruth did bless us tonight i pray it seals something necessary in our hearts and brings a healing i pray granted in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
