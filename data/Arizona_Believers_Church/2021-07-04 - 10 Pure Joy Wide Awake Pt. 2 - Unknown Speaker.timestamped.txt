[0:00] nehemiah chapter 8 verses 1-12
[0:03] nehemiah chapter 8 verses 1-12 i am
[0:06] excited to be able to
[0:08] come to this as our text we're
[0:09] continuing on the subject of wide awake
[0:12] in the context of pure joy but this had
[0:14] been my
[0:15] part of my inspiration from the very
[0:16] beginning and it just seemed like it was
[0:18] eluding me but
[0:19] god just placed it right before me
[0:21] yesterday and i just got so excited
[0:23] um couldn't sleep so this is i'm really
[0:26] really happy that you're that we'll be
[0:28] able to fellowship together around this
[0:30] nehemiah chapter 8
[0:31] verses 1 to 12 bear with me as i list my
[0:34] way through some of these names
[0:36] and all the people gathered themselves
[0:38] together as
[0:39] one man into the street that was before
[0:42] the watergate so many beautiful
[0:44] types here and they spake unto ezra the
[0:46] scribe to bring the books of the law of
[0:48] moses which the lord had commanded to
[0:51] israel so these books are coming into
[0:53] view
[0:54] and ezra the priest brought the law
[0:56] before the congregation
[0:58] both of men and women and all that could
[1:01] hear
[1:02] with understanding so this is important
[1:04] all that could hear with understanding
[1:06] so these are ears that can hear and
[1:07] understand
[1:09] and he says because we know that to see
[1:11] the kingdom of god is to understand so
[1:13] this speaks of an election and a birth
[1:15] upon the first day of the seventh month
[1:18] the first day of the seventh month
[1:19] corresponds with the feast of trumpets
[1:21] and the day of holy convocation leading
[1:24] in as you would continue to read into
[1:25] the feast of tabernacles that's a
[1:26] beautiful
[1:27] beautiful things and he read therein
[1:31] before the street that was before the
[1:33] watergate from the morning which is the
[1:35] rising of the sun
[1:37] until midday before the men and the
[1:39] women and those that could understand
[1:41] and the ears of
[1:42] all the people were attentive unto the
[1:44] book
[1:45] of the law so beautiful and ezra the
[1:48] scribes stood upon a pulpit of wood
[1:51] which they made for the purpose
[1:53] and beside him stood matathia
[1:57] and shema and ananiah and uriah and
[2:00] hilkiah
[2:01] and messiah on his right and on his left
[2:04] hand padaya and mishael
[2:06] and malkaya
[2:11] zechariah and meshalam and ezra opened
[2:14] the book
[2:15] in the sight of all the people for he
[2:18] was above
[2:19] all the people and when he opened it all
[2:22] the people
[2:23] stood up the opening of the book it
[2:25] caused the people to rise
[2:27] he opened the book it caused a raising
[2:29] of those who could hear and who could
[2:31] understand
[2:32] and ezra bless the lord the great god
[2:35] and all the people answered amen
[2:37] amen with lifting up their hands and
[2:39] they bowed their heads and worshiped the
[2:41] lord with their faces to the ground
[2:44] now it was ezra and uh is standing there
[2:48] but now it says
[2:49] and jeshua and binay and sherabiah
[2:53] and jamin and akub and shevathai
[2:57] hodadaya messiah kalita azariah
[3:00] josephad hennan pelaya and the levites
[3:04] caused the people to understand the law
[3:07] and the people stood in their place
[3:10] notice all these people working together
[3:12] just wasn't the one maybe standing there
[3:14] but it was all these people working
[3:15] together
[3:16] for those who could hear and understand
[3:19] to
[3:19] know the words of this book to
[3:21] understand the law and it caused the
[3:23] people to stand in their place
[3:25] so they read in the book of the law of
[3:26] god distinctly
[3:28] and gave the sense and caused them to
[3:31] understand the reading and nehemiah
[3:34] which is the ter
[3:35] tershatha and ezra the priest the scribe
[3:38] and the levites that taught the people
[3:40] said unto all the people
[3:42] this day is holy unto the lord your god
[3:44] mourn not nor
[3:46] weep this is why they said it for all
[3:48] the people wept when they heard
[3:50] the words of the law so with the the
[3:53] words of the law
[3:54] came and when this was at this opening
[3:55] there was a pricking of their conscience
[3:57] and there was this conviction
[3:59] but so then the ministry says hold on
[4:01] now don't weep
[4:02] then he said unto them go your way eat
[4:05] the fat drink the sweet send
[4:07] portions unto them for whom nothing is
[4:09] prepared for this day is holy unto our
[4:11] lord
[4:12] neither be ye sorry for the joy of the
[4:16] lord
[4:16] is your strength this is where we get
[4:18] this statement the joy of the lord is
[4:20] your strength
[4:20] so the levites stilled all the people
[4:23] saying so now this is
[4:24] this is the same message being repeated
[4:26] after it's been spoken by ezra and that
[4:28] it's been repeated so the levites
[4:30] stealed all the people saying hold your
[4:31] peace for the day is holy
[4:33] neither be aggrieved and all the people
[4:35] went their way
[4:36] and to drink and to send portions and to
[4:39] make
[4:39] great mirth because they had understood
[4:42] the words
[4:42] that were declared unto them praise the
[4:46] lord god bless you you could be seated
[4:53] oh my i trust that we'll be able to get
[4:55] to these things
[4:57] this morning and have a lot that we'd
[4:59] like to express
[5:00] i do want to take just a few moments at
[5:02] the outset just to kind of reset
[5:04] where we were last time kind of carry
[5:06] some things over from
[5:08] um to where we ended um and kind of had
[5:11] to cut off in the middle of something
[5:12] last week but
[5:14] brother randa makes the statement in the
[5:16] church age book how a christian's joy is
[5:18] purely on the lord her her
[5:20] attention her pleasures and her joy is
[5:22] purely on the lord
[5:24] and so he's talking about the believer's
[5:26] spirit and their emotions different from
[5:28] the world
[5:29] he says our spirit is clean it is fresh
[5:33] it is real it is sober and serious and
[5:36] it's that phrase that really has caught
[5:37] our attention
[5:39] but nonetheless full of the joy of the
[5:41] lord so this soberness and seriousness
[5:43] is not a somberness or a sadness
[5:46] or uh you know a you know a lack of
[5:49] being thrilled it means something else
[5:51] and brother branham is showing us that
[5:53] the lord's joy is expressed
[5:54] in a spirit that is fresh real and clean
[5:58] and so this it kind of helps us when
[6:01] he's describing this how it's
[6:02] it's clean it's fresh it's real sober
[6:04] and serious it's
[6:06] something to where the flesh is not
[6:08] intoxicated
[6:09] inappropriately it's not something
[6:11] that's just been stimulated for carnal
[6:13] reasons and so it brings us to the idea
[6:15] of soberness
[6:16] in that there's no foreign substance
[6:18] that is instigating some sort of
[6:19] hallucination or causing you some sort
[6:21] of emotional
[6:22] frenzy and we spent a few services on
[6:25] the subject of a clean
[6:26] conscience and how a clean conscience is
[6:29] one that is
[6:29] liberated by the truth and that our
[6:32] conscience holds this place within our
[6:33] spirits to admonish us when we have
[6:35] done something wrong or affirm when we
[6:37] have done something right
[6:39] and we saw in the bible how that a clean
[6:41] conscience a pure conscience and a free
[6:43] conscience
[6:44] is one that the word can deal with to to
[6:47] set a right the rest of the person's
[6:49] emotions and and attitudes and
[6:51] apprehensions and fears and affections
[6:53] and it's one that the the word of god
[6:55] can guide and direct
[6:57] and then we looked at how conscience as
[7:00] even being a part of our overall spirits
[7:02] and that there's a difference between
[7:03] between your conscience and your
[7:05] consciousness
[7:06] and how consciousness would be your
[7:08] awareness of the surroundings and we're
[7:10] conscious of
[7:11] uh the fact that it's maybe a little bit
[7:12] more humid today and uh and because
[7:14] if you're conscious of that then you can
[7:16] react accordingly and you can put more
[7:18] hairspray on your hair or
[7:19] whatever it is you do when it's when
[7:21] it's muggy and humid but it gives you a
[7:22] sense of
[7:23] i'm conscious of certain things and then
[7:25] our conscience tells us the right way to
[7:27] act within
[7:28] the the reality that we are aware of
[7:32] so in the the subject of wide awake
[7:34] we've been taking the the terms
[7:36] sober in serious and how sober we
[7:39] related it to how you're not overcome
[7:41] by emotion and if you're sober then you
[7:43] have the appropriate response to
[7:45] stimulus
[7:46] and that you are you it's not just your
[7:48] emotions that take control of you and
[7:49] you hear some news
[7:51] and i'm even reminded of how the the
[7:53] woman who went and uh
[7:55] was going after the prophet because her
[7:57] son had died and when the
[7:58] messenger came and said how are things
[8:00] she said all is well
[8:02] that was one that was sober she she knew
[8:04] that her son was dead but she was not
[8:06] overcome with emotion to the point of
[8:08] despair but she could actually
[8:10] have be moderate and temperate and say
[8:12] all is well
[8:13] so to be sober is to have the right kind
[8:16] of response
[8:17] to be serious it's not just serious
[8:20] minded the sake of
[8:21] not enjoying anything but it really
[8:22] means no nonsense
[8:24] there's a sincerity there's an earnest
[8:27] there's an earnestness there to where
[8:28] you're doing things soberly and
[8:30] seriously it's sincere it's earnest
[8:33] and just trying to find some words maybe
[8:35] to capture
[8:37] what our thought was on the subject of
[8:39] wide awake last time
[8:41] but if you're wide awake then you're
[8:43] conscious
[8:44] if you're wide awake then you're
[8:46] understanding so you're not only you're
[8:48] aware but you're understanding and then
[8:49] with your awareness and then your
[8:51] understanding of
[8:52] those things that you're aware of you
[8:53] can be engaged in the situation and you
[8:55] can act the right way and behave the
[8:57] right way
[8:58] so if you're wide awake your conduct and
[9:00] your attitude
[9:01] will reflect the moment appropriately
[9:04] you're
[9:04] you're not half asleep you're not kind
[9:06] of oh clueless and oh i didn't realize
[9:08] that but you're
[9:08] you're sober it means there's an
[9:10] alertness there's an awareness and when
[9:12] we talk about being wide awake
[9:13] your senses are in tune and you're
[9:16] you're identifying certain things and
[9:18] all your faculties are unaltered and
[9:20] they're not
[9:20] stimulated by the wrong things and your
[9:22] discernment hasn't been corrupted and
[9:24] you
[9:24] haven't let certain things kind of muddy
[9:26] the waters and confuse you that's what
[9:28] we mean by being wide awake
[9:29] is all my senses are properly channeled
[9:32] all my senses i know how things are i
[9:34] recognize how things are going
[9:35] and yet in the midst of even knowing
[9:37] that things can be chaotic
[9:39] with that kind of consciousness that's
[9:41] when you can have real joy
[9:42] because we we ended last time and we're
[9:45] going to amplify this time
[9:46] the bride's joy is not based on
[9:48] ignorance as long as i can just go in
[9:50] the basement and
[9:51] convince myself everything's fine or
[9:53] stick my head in the sand and convince
[9:54] myself everything's fine
[9:56] that's not the bride's joy
[9:59] now now i'm just going to jump right
[10:01] into it if this seems like kind of a
[10:03] hard turn
[10:04] i'm still learning how to drive so be
[10:05] patient with me first corinthians
[10:07] chapter 15
[10:09] verse 33 and and i want to come back to
[10:12] this this was going to be my text
[10:15] originally and then the lord just really
[10:18] moved
[10:19] uh yesterday in my heart it was just a
[10:21] thrilling afternoon
[10:23] so we're very familiar with this
[10:25] statement and i kind of have a unique
[10:27] approach maybe here for a little while
[10:28] and i hope you can just stay real close
[10:30] to my thought in my heart
[10:32] and not maybe try to vary from it it
[10:34] says be not deceived
[10:35] evil communications corrupt good manners
[10:39] now he's saying this within the context
[10:42] of something very very powerful and
[10:43] profound
[10:44] and you realize this is a chapter that
[10:45] deals with the rapture
[10:47] and so in the resurrection and he makes
[10:49] this statement like don't deceive
[10:50] yourselves
[10:51] evil communications will corrupt good
[10:53] manners
[10:55] now it's widely held that this passage
[10:57] was taken from
[10:58] a play an athenian comedy uh written by
[11:01] menander it's called the theaters
[11:04] and paul is actually quoting from a a
[11:06] work of literature
[11:08] and he's using a phrase that can be
[11:09] tracked back to you like oh my goodness
[11:11] there's no way you would attribute
[11:12] something paul said
[11:14] to something he read well if we believe
[11:16] the message we don't have a problem with
[11:17] that
[11:18] miller brandon was very well read and i
[11:20] thank god for a prophetic filter
[11:22] to be able to take things and put them
[11:23] in context and help us to understand
[11:25] to even be able to take a a a slogan on
[11:28] a cigarette
[11:29] box and bring a message through that
[11:32] that is very relevant and profound
[11:34] and is applicable today so paul
[11:37] takes something that he knew of within
[11:39] classic literature
[11:40] and this athenian comedy that was
[11:42] written and it was one that would have
[11:44] been performed within a um
[11:47] the context of drinking and gaity and
[11:49] you know kind of having a good old time
[11:51] and laughing and
[11:52] and kind of yucking it up and paul says
[11:54] be quotes from this be not deceived evil
[11:56] communications corrupt good manners and
[11:58] i will come to that
[11:59] in its context but i want you to notice
[12:01] a couple other places in the scripture
[12:03] in acts chapter 17 verse 28 paul quoted
[12:06] your own pro
[12:07] your own poets and when he quotes their
[12:10] poets he's quoting eratis and clianthus
[12:13] who are grecian poets and he's quoting
[12:15] from them
[12:17] and when he speaks to him because he
[12:19] knows and if i'm going to quote
[12:20] one of your your poets i'm going to
[12:22] quote someone you're familiar with and
[12:23] paul would have been familiar with them
[12:25] uh knowing where he was from he quotes
[12:27] it to him knowing that using this will
[12:29] have an impact on their thought process
[12:32] using this and being able to bring this
[12:34] into the subject will be something that
[12:35] kind of
[12:36] engages them and it gets their attention
[12:38] and then in titus
[12:40] chapter one verse 12 he says he refers
[12:42] to one of themselves or your own
[12:44] prophets
[12:45] and he quotes the epinedes paradox which
[12:48] is
[12:48] epinedis being a creation said all
[12:50] creations are liars
[12:52] so figure that one out him being
[12:55] accretion
[12:55] if he says all christians are liars and
[12:58] that prophecy
[12:59] is true then what he's telling you is
[13:01] false
[13:04] right this is just how clever paul was
[13:06] he actually is quoting
[13:08] this paradox of this this creation
[13:12] how does it resolve itself and you know
[13:13] what he says i'll resolve it and tell
[13:15] you
[13:15] it's true they're liars and they're and
[13:18] they fill their bellies up
[13:19] but paul is actually using uh these
[13:22] poets and these philosophers and citing
[13:24] these other writings
[13:25] and he used familiar classic literature
[13:28] to get the attention of his audience
[13:30] in order to make a point and so
[13:33] last week i just mentioned a couple
[13:35] phrases and i realized maybe the lord
[13:36] just had me stop
[13:38] and end it where we were so i could kind
[13:40] of give some of that background
[13:41] but i want to take a phrase from a poem
[13:43] that says where ignorance is bliss tis
[13:46] folly to be wise
[13:47] anybody ever heard that phrase before
[13:50] and
[13:50] paul doesn't necessarily give the title
[13:52] of these works or give them any
[13:54] credibility
[13:54] beyond just quoting them so i'll do the
[13:56] same today there's this poem that says
[13:58] where ignorance is bliss tis folly to be
[14:01] wise
[14:02] and it was this statement ignorance is
[14:04] bliss that kind of began to form
[14:06] the thought of wide awake because i was
[14:08] thinking pure joy
[14:10] can only be found in being wide awake
[14:12] god was dealing with me
[14:13] in the message of the hour brother ma'am
[14:15] so i'm like wake up being wide awake and
[14:16] these different principles and i realize
[14:18] that the message of the hour is a
[14:20] message that wakes the bride up
[14:23] it she's not going to be half asleep
[14:25] this is not something there's going to
[14:26] be a people who do not sleep
[14:28] right there's going to be a bride that
[14:29] is translated and she does not sleep
[14:31] so there's so many things that were
[14:33] fitting with this uh where our joy is
[14:35] connected to
[14:36] and this thought of ignorance is bliss i
[14:39] thought well that just
[14:40] runs counter and contradicts what real
[14:43] joy is
[14:45] and so this thought where ignorance is
[14:46] bliss just followed to be wise
[14:49] uh was kind of coming up against what
[14:52] being wide awake in its connection to
[14:53] pure joy
[14:55] now in the context of the poem i'll
[14:57] share it with you so you don't have to
[14:58] google it later and read it i'm not
[15:00] going to read the whole poem i'll just
[15:02] kind of share the context with you
[15:04] but it's talking about it essentially
[15:06] means this and it's talking about
[15:07] young men going off to college and how
[15:10] this one who had graduated from this
[15:11] college notices these guys going to
[15:13] school
[15:13] and he's like man they're going to have
[15:16] fun and they're going to do this and
[15:17] they're going to do that and he's
[15:18] basically saying you know what
[15:19] let the children enjoy not knowing
[15:23] let the student enjoy his time together
[15:25] with his pals
[15:26] let them let them enjoy this time that
[15:28] they have in their youth and in their
[15:30] innocence
[15:31] because it won't do them any good to
[15:33] know and so in that context you might be
[15:35] able to realize well you know in that
[15:36] sense you know just let them enjoy their
[15:38] time while their children uh it would be
[15:40] folly to make them wise to the things
[15:42] that are coming
[15:43] but the poem definitely takes these
[15:45] things of the world and the trials that
[15:47] are coming and the sufferings that are
[15:48] coming and the
[15:49] and the challenges that face adulthood
[15:52] and saying oh ignorance is bliss
[15:54] when you don't know the responsibilities
[15:56] then you don't know what's coming you
[15:57] can just kind of live ignorantly
[15:59] and live blissfully unaware of the
[16:02] things that are to come
[16:03] so let them play let them have their fun
[16:05] because one day their day is coming
[16:06] there's gonna be suffering there's gonna
[16:07] be toil there's gonna be consequence
[16:09] but what struck me is to say ignorance
[16:12] is bliss
[16:13] is astounding because bliss in its
[16:16] etymology means perfect happiness
[16:19] and it speaks of great joy and because
[16:21] of its closeness to the word bless
[16:24] it kind of begin to take on this
[16:25] connotation that bliss
[16:27] is a spiritual joy and bliss is a
[16:30] heavenly joy
[16:31] and that bliss is a perfect happiness a
[16:33] perfect joy
[16:34] that's connected with eternal things and
[16:37] in the church age book brother branham
[16:39] in referring to revelations chapter 2
[16:41] verse 11
[16:42] it says he that hath an ear let him hear
[16:44] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[16:46] he that overcometh shall not be hurt of
[16:49] the second
[16:50] death and in reference to that scripture
[16:53] brother branham makes this statement
[16:55] why will this overcomer this believer
[16:58] escape
[16:59] and go into the realms of eternal life
[17:02] and bliss so the the the bliss
[17:05] bliss is something that's associated
[17:07] with eternity a perfect happiness
[17:09] doesn't happen outside the context of
[17:11] god's perfect will
[17:12] that the bliss when it says ignorance is
[17:14] bliss i wanted to kind of get into
[17:16] striking them and say
[17:17] well that's a little bit deceptive
[17:19] that's a little bit misleading this idea
[17:21] that ignorance is bliss because bliss is
[17:23] related to the realms of eternal life
[17:26] he says in one other place but above all
[17:28] things we're thankful for the sunlight
[17:30] of god
[17:30] that gives us the shining of eternal
[17:33] bliss
[17:34] so the sunlight of god gives the shining
[17:36] of eternal bliss
[17:38] he says in another place we believe in
[17:39] the physical resurrection of the dead to
[17:41] receive a body
[17:42] not an old and wrinkled one as we go
[17:44] into the grave but a new one
[17:46] in the very bliss of youth to live
[17:48] forever
[17:50] so bless is not something associated
[17:52] with just
[17:53] being ignorant or unaware but bliss is
[17:55] associated with eternity
[17:57] if bliss is identified with an eternal
[17:59] realm then it's something that is
[18:01] that is all-encompassing and all-knowing
[18:04] and this is this is what true bliss is
[18:06] so ignorance is bliss
[18:08] just in looking at what bliss is starts
[18:10] to say well i don't know if i could
[18:11] actually
[18:12] accept that as an absolute truth
[18:15] but then when you consider what
[18:16] ignorance is
[18:18] and then really the whole statement
[18:20] falls apart because ignorance is a lack
[18:21] of wisdom
[18:23] ignorance is a lack of knowledge and
[18:26] that's not the bliss that the word
[18:27] promises
[18:28] the word doesn't say hey just go to
[18:30] sleep and ignore everything
[18:32] you know it'll all be all right when you
[18:33] wake up that's not what the word wants
[18:35] you to do
[18:36] that's not how the word deals with your
[18:37] hearts so when it says that ignorance is
[18:39] bliss tis folly to be wise it
[18:42] actually causes us to accept the
[18:44] principle that in the scripture the
[18:46] worst thing you could be is foolish
[18:49] and to say tis folly to be wise is
[18:51] contradictory
[18:52] because the opposite of a fool is one
[18:54] who is wise and so how could it be folly
[18:57] to be wise it just
[18:58] it just doesn't make any sense to say
[19:00] that ignorance is bliss just followed to
[19:01] be wise it's contradictory
[19:03] and then to think that ignorance is a
[19:05] lack of wisdom and the lack of knowledge
[19:07] the bible says in habit 2 14 for the
[19:10] earth
[19:10] shall be filled with the knowledge of
[19:12] the glory of the lord as the waters
[19:14] cover the sea
[19:16] now this is a prophecy clearly about the
[19:18] earth saying that the earth shall be
[19:20] filled with the knowledge of the glory
[19:23] of the lord as the waters cover the sea
[19:25] so it's wanting to describe it in a way
[19:27] that as it the seas are completely
[19:29] covered with water
[19:30] and i kind of pondered a little bit and
[19:31] said well what in the world does that
[19:32] mean waters cover the sea
[19:33] the seas are water and so it's pervasive
[19:36] it's complete
[19:38] it covers all the earth shall be filled
[19:40] with the knowledge of the glory of the
[19:42] lord as the waters cover the sea
[19:44] now ponder this if the earth is going to
[19:46] be filled with the knowledge of the
[19:48] glory of the lord
[19:49] then also consider that what god does to
[19:52] the earth he does to the individual
[19:55] right are we not taught that that in the
[19:57] three the stages of the redemption of
[19:58] the earth we see that god does the same
[20:00] thing with the individual
[20:01] and if in the ultimate outcome of the
[20:03] redemption of the earth is the earth is
[20:04] going to be filled with the knowledge of
[20:06] the glory of the lord
[20:07] then therefore we must believe that we
[20:09] ourselves
[20:10] are coming to a promise where we can
[20:13] somehow
[20:14] someway be filled with the knowledge of
[20:17] the glory of the lord
[20:20] and so this ignorance is bliss is
[20:22] certainly seeding something in your mind
[20:25] to cause us to think that well if you
[20:26] just don't know it won't hurt you if you
[20:28] don't know you won't worry about it and
[20:29] i recognize that there's some carnal
[20:31] truth to that but let me just say
[20:32] that the peace that god wants to give
[20:34] you is not one that's ignorant
[20:39] now whereas the poem this poem says
[20:41] ignorance is bliss there's a novel in
[20:43] our literature
[20:44] well-known literature to those who would
[20:46] be well-read
[20:48] and especially maybe those who like to
[20:49] burn books i don't care if this is one
[20:51] that got burned quite a bit but
[20:53] i won't give the title but there's a
[20:54] statement in the book
[20:56] and i'll kind of amplify it a little bit
[20:58] that ignorance
[20:59] is strength now again pondered this
[21:04] it was a slogan of this part of this
[21:07] government
[21:07] in this book and and it was a slogan of
[21:11] the ministry of truth and the ministry
[21:13] of truth in this book was one of four
[21:14] different govern
[21:15] government ministries up with what was
[21:17] called the party
[21:19] so instead of getting kind of bogged
[21:20] down in the specifics i want you to
[21:23] think about the form
[21:26] and the dynamics of this and how that
[21:28] paul would even tell one well just like
[21:29] one of your poets said
[21:31] and just as quoted by one of your own
[21:33] prophets and then he quotes from this
[21:35] athenian comedy
[21:37] and paul is using it now to make the
[21:39] point that maybe they were onto
[21:40] something
[21:42] maybe you should ponder this maybe you
[21:43] should think about this i want to i want
[21:45] to represent this
[21:48] that that there is a truth and an
[21:50] assessment being made about human nature
[21:53] and an observation being made about how
[21:55] satan's kingdom works because this is
[21:58] written in response to
[21:59] these totalitarian regimes that came up
[22:02] in world war ii
[22:03] and whether it be nazism or communism
[22:05] and socialism that began to rise up
[22:07] and he began to identify these certain
[22:09] characteristics of how someone could
[22:11] demand absolute complete unquestioned
[22:14] obedience to somebody
[22:16] and the things the links that they had
[22:18] to go to to make sure that that regime
[22:20] would
[22:20] be successful in subjugating the people
[22:23] in taking away their free moral agency
[22:25] and making them do and say and do things
[22:27] that were unthinkable
[22:29] and so we know that there was demons
[22:31] that were loosed
[22:32] uh under and that were poured out upon
[22:34] the world
[22:35] and and then these these pre-tribulation
[22:38] things that were being poured out upon
[22:39] the jews with eichmann and hitler and
[22:41] mussolini
[22:42] and it was physically persecuting the
[22:45] jews
[22:45] and then we see it manifested in these
[22:47] regimes we see it manifested in these
[22:49] governments
[22:49] and now we know they have been loosed
[22:51] spiritually on the bride
[22:53] is that right so now i'm going to take
[22:56] this this this novel and i'm by no means
[23:00] endorsing it but this
[23:02] writer this classical writer makes these
[23:05] observations
[23:06] about how these governments were working
[23:09] and then i want you to think that if
[23:11] that's the observation of how they
[23:12] worked in the political realm
[23:14] think of how it works now in the
[23:16] spiritual realm
[23:17] quote some of my favorite preachers come
[23:19] on somebody
[23:21] this is really good just to ponder now
[23:24] so there was three different slogans of
[23:26] the party you could put whatever you
[23:28] really want to do that if you've got
[23:30] something you want to write down in your
[23:31] in your notes you go for it but it was
[23:33] called the party
[23:34] and there was three slogans upon her
[23:36] this war is peace
[23:38] freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
[23:42] are those starting to sound a little
[23:43] weird to you war is peace
[23:45] freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
[23:48] and this is what it says the ministry of
[23:49] peace concerns itself with war
[23:53] the ministry of truth concerns itself
[23:55] with lies
[23:56] the ministry of love concerns itself
[23:58] with torture
[23:59] and the ministry of plenty concerns
[24:02] itself with starvation
[24:04] so they called themselves a ministry of
[24:06] peace but yet if only engaged in war the
[24:08] ministry of love and it only engaged in
[24:10] torture the ministry of truth and all it
[24:11] did
[24:12] was engage itself in lies so you notice
[24:15] now there is a deliberate
[24:17] contradiction it's a deliberate
[24:20] contradiction in the ministry of peace
[24:22] concerning itself with war so it says
[24:24] war is peace and freedom is slavery and
[24:26] ignorance is strength
[24:28] now this is this is a statement i took
[24:30] from this book
[24:31] if one is to rule now think about
[24:34] satan's kingdom
[24:35] now we're not just talking about the
[24:36] success of political parties and and uh
[24:38] wow brother aaron you really gave
[24:40] mussolini are working over this morning
[24:41] no i want you to think in a spiritual
[24:43] realm
[24:43] how these powers try to work on us as
[24:45] the bride to keep us from exercising
[24:48] our faith in the word of god he says
[24:52] if one is to rule and to continue ruling
[24:55] one must be able to dislocate the sense
[24:58] of reality
[25:00] so the governing party the dictator the
[25:02] one that wants to demand
[25:03] absolute and complete unquestioned
[25:05] obedience has to dislocate one's sense
[25:08] of reality
[25:09] now you ready for this i think this is
[25:11] pretty rich for the secret of willership
[25:14] is to combine a belief in one's own
[25:18] affaliability
[25:20] with the power to learn from past
[25:22] mistakes
[25:27] you have to first believe that you're
[25:28] infallible
[25:30] and then you have the ability to learn
[25:32] from past mistakes
[25:34] it doesn't even make any sense but yeah
[25:36] this is what one has to accept and one
[25:38] has to believe you have to
[25:40] combine this belief that you were
[25:42] infallible
[25:43] and still able to learn from your past
[25:46] mistakes
[25:50] and so with that contradiction
[25:53] existing within the ruler
[25:57] the citizens are forced to repress truth
[26:00] and if there's any any truth it's
[26:02] repressed and to accept
[26:03] lives and there i believe the language
[26:06] that was invented or
[26:07] used in this book i think the the nation
[26:09] was oceana
[26:11] and uh in its location of its capital
[26:14] was in london and it had these
[26:16] pyramid shapes for the ministries 300
[26:19] meters high
[26:20] and on the minister the facade of the
[26:22] ministry it had these slogans you know
[26:23] war is peace and freedom of slavery
[26:26] and they had this concept called double
[26:29] think
[26:30] i'm not losing you all right i mean i
[26:31] won't quiz you at the end of this
[26:33] we won't be passing out scantrons you
[26:36] won't have to write a thousand word
[26:37] essay
[26:38] i'll buy you the cliff notes if you get
[26:40] nervous we'll take the test together
[26:44] we're just wanting you to think about
[26:45] these principles for a moment
[26:47] double think this is what double think
[26:49] is it's the ability to hold
[26:51] two opposing ideas in one's mind
[26:54] simultaneously
[26:55] and accepting both as true
[26:58] and this is what you've got to get
[26:59] people to do hold two opposing ideas in
[27:02] one's mind
[27:04] at the same time in believing that both
[27:07] are true and one of i think the phrase
[27:09] was black white
[27:11] and to not only believe that it's both
[27:12] black and white
[27:14] and know that that's contradictory but
[27:16] to actually believe that that's true
[27:19] and the goal was this process of double
[27:22] think is meant to produce
[27:24] an in to kind of induce a lack of
[27:26] consciousness
[27:28] that you're just constantly bombarded
[27:30] with this inconsistency
[27:32] that the person begins to lack
[27:34] consciousness
[27:35] and therefore lacking consciousness
[27:37] engages in self-deception
[27:39] and the goal ultimately stated of the
[27:41] party is to induce an insanity
[27:44] so that the people are actually given
[27:46] into insanity
[27:48] and are no they're hypocritical but
[27:50] believe they're not hypocritical
[27:53] it seems like a stretch this is exactly
[27:54] what's being proposed
[27:56] and so to have complete control in order
[27:59] to do this and to get them to do the
[28:00] double think and in order them to become
[28:02] insane
[28:03] and to become lack this consciousness
[28:06] the party constantly engaged in
[28:08] suppressing knowledge
[28:10] didn't want you to know the truth spread
[28:12] propaganda wanted you to believe it and
[28:13] in doing so
[28:14] the citizens were never actually aware
[28:17] of how oppressed they were
[28:19] just always keep them from the truth
[28:21] always keep them from the reality
[28:22] always make them feel that are in
[28:23] bondage always make them feel like they
[28:25] need to be baptized again always make
[28:26] them feel under condemnation
[28:28] always feel like they're sick and broken
[28:30] and you're the only one that can fix
[28:31] them
[28:31] this is how they operate in such a way
[28:34] to keep you in
[28:35] behold into the government and and uh
[28:38] numbing you down and causing you to be
[28:40] unconscious so if the sins are never
[28:42] aware of how oppressed they are they're
[28:43] just thinking
[28:44] well isn't this great isn't this
[28:46] wonderful
[28:48] and so this phrase now ignorance is
[28:50] strength
[28:53] we're specifically used to overthrow the
[28:55] people's consciousness
[28:58] of contradictions it was used to
[29:01] allow them to engage in this double
[29:03] think to accept lies and not be
[29:05] conscious of what the truth is but to
[29:07] accept these things that were lies
[29:10] now let me let me kind of after we've
[29:14] kind of belabored that and we'd all make
[29:15] an a minus in
[29:17] uh in our literature course in college
[29:19] now
[29:21] the world society and even man
[29:24] if you could catch this these very
[29:26] dynamics we've been mentioning
[29:27] they'll try to manufacture a happiness
[29:29] through ignorance
[29:32] and and try to manufacture a contentment
[29:36] through dullness
[29:38] so everyone needs to be kind of dumbed
[29:40] down and dulled and numbed and
[29:42] accept that this is the right thing and
[29:43] this is the way we all live and this is
[29:45] the way things ought to be
[29:47] and ignorance of strength if you don't
[29:48] know it won't hurt you ignorance the
[29:50] less you know the stronger you are the
[29:51] less you know the stronger you are
[29:53] just accept what we're telling you and
[29:54] accept how we say it and accept the way
[29:56] that it is
[29:56] and there's a certain way that they
[29:58] wanted to use lies not
[30:00] truth to get the people just kind of
[30:02] dumb down and live in this fallen
[30:04] reality and actually a perversion of
[30:05] reality
[30:06] and wanted to keep them from the full
[30:08] reality
[30:10] i mean really the attitude is as i begin
[30:12] to study this where ignorance is bliss
[30:14] and
[30:14] ignorance is strength if you're not
[30:16] concerned with truth then you never need
[30:18] to be reflective
[30:20] begin to ponder how the world and
[30:22] society and even ourselves sometimes
[30:24] try to produce a synthetic happiness
[30:27] through contra you know denying
[30:28] contradictions and through
[30:30] ignorance and through being dulled and
[30:31] having our discernment deadened
[30:33] and our awareness deadened if we're not
[30:35] worried about truth then we never have
[30:36] to examine ourselves by it
[30:38] if we're not worried about truth and
[30:40] we're never we're never reflective or
[30:42] introspective we just kind of have this
[30:44] contentment that how i feel is what
[30:45] matters what i see is what matters
[30:47] and there's really no absolute truth i
[30:49] can just say and do whatever i want and
[30:50] i don't ever need to be examined i don't
[30:52] ever need to be introspective
[30:54] and think about it if that happens you
[30:55] can be an absolute to yourself
[30:58] right no truth then i can be an absolute
[31:00] to myself
[31:02] or you ready
[31:05] you can give that place to a personality
[31:09] what they did in this novel they gave it
[31:11] to a party
[31:13] you can give that place to a person or a
[31:14] demagogue
[31:16] a leader who gains power by appealing to
[31:18] your desires and prejudices rather than
[31:20] the word
[31:23] now think about this be very honest with
[31:26] yourselves
[31:26] that this is how what we can do we can
[31:28] forfeit our liberty in christ
[31:31] forfeit maybe we do not become absolute
[31:34] to ourselves but we take our faith and
[31:36] we place it in a person
[31:37] who gains power not through the word of
[31:40] god or not because the word is lifted up
[31:42] but they appeal to your desires and they
[31:44] appeal to your prejudices
[31:46] so therefore they gain your support and
[31:48] you're willing to let them
[31:49] lead did that escalate too quickly for
[31:53] some of y'all
[31:56] and brother branham says this in
[31:57] christianity versus idolatry
[32:00] he says you've got to know the word
[32:03] think about how sinister ignorance is
[32:06] bliss is
[32:07] and how contradictory to the word is but
[32:09] now even more sinister is this idea that
[32:11] ignorance is strength
[32:12] and then it's used in such a way to
[32:14] cause us as believers
[32:16] to forfeit our liberty and christ in the
[32:18] re and be held back from the full
[32:20] reality of the word of god
[32:22] because of this kind of spirit that's
[32:24] let loose against the bride
[32:27] i don't want you to miss that connection
[32:29] the reason why this is relevant
[32:31] is what we saw politically working
[32:33] against the jews
[32:34] now works ecumenically and religiously
[32:37] and spiritually against the bride
[32:38] and if this is the assessment of a
[32:40] classical writer with regards to
[32:42] political regimes
[32:43] in the 1900s and how it worked within
[32:45] socialism communism and nazism
[32:47] then we must recognize that these
[32:49] dynamics are at work now
[32:51] to keep the bride from rapturing faith
[32:55] and there's so much more how this could
[32:57] be amplified using these terminologies
[32:59] but i've done more than paul did because
[33:00] paul just said it really quick and moved
[33:02] on
[33:03] there's got to be a third corinthians
[33:05] somewhere where he take as much time as
[33:06] i did talk about these poets and these
[33:08] philosophers
[33:09] but let me let me just kind of bring it
[33:11] to this because i hope that this will
[33:12] help
[33:13] uh seal this in you've got to know the
[33:15] word stay
[33:16] on the word the greatest battle is at
[33:20] hand what is it going to be with these
[33:22] 200 000 thousand demons
[33:25] he says now we've played church for
[33:27] years and years
[33:29] but the hours come now that when genes
[33:30] jefferson jennings will withstand moses
[33:32] as the bible said they would
[33:35] and it's going to be spiritual battle
[33:38] conflict
[33:40] uh if you're thinking in your mind ooh
[33:42] yeah i'd like to see that
[33:44] kind of like you you go and you watch
[33:46] nascar because you want to see the
[33:47] wrecks
[33:49] and if you think you're going to see it
[33:51] it's not going to look like you think
[33:52] it's going to look probably
[33:53] ooh i love a good fight let me see this
[33:56] it's going to be a spiritual battle
[33:58] conflict
[33:58] there'll be some just continue on
[34:03] they never actually recognize the
[34:05] conflict
[34:06] the denominational church will just move
[34:09] right on into
[34:10] domination
[34:13] now think about that that's just the way
[34:14] that i found it everywhere i could find
[34:16] it
[34:16] domination not into denomination it's
[34:20] already denominated but it's going to
[34:21] move into domination
[34:24] we know into a demagogue into a these
[34:26] these governments and these systems that
[34:28] are man ruling the people
[34:30] and go on the way it goes but i mean the
[34:33] real true believer is coming to
[34:35] that battlefield so it's only the real
[34:38] true believer that's going to wake up to
[34:40] the fact that we can't play church
[34:42] anymore
[34:43] going to recognize janice and jamborees
[34:45] that are withstanding moses as the bible
[34:47] said it would
[34:48] and they're going to be the ones that
[34:49] engage in the spiritual battle and the
[34:51] conflict
[34:52] while others just move on and are
[34:54] dominated the real true believers coming
[34:56] to that battlefield
[34:58] and he says you better be versed
[35:01] what does it mean verse you better know
[35:03] you better understand you better be
[35:05] better be well equipped
[35:06] and know what you're doing you better be
[35:08] versed and know what you're doing
[35:10] or you can take an evil spirit so easy
[35:13] and not know
[35:15] so what is our defense against taking on
[35:18] an evil spirit
[35:19] being well versed and knowing what we're
[35:20] doing because if you're not well versed
[35:22] and you don't know what you're doing
[35:23] it's very easy to take on an evil spirit
[35:25] and never even know it so he says if
[35:27] it's contrary to this word
[35:29] don't believe it stay with that word
[35:33] he's telling us if it opposes this
[35:35] message if it's contrary to this message
[35:37] if it doesn't
[35:38] harmonize with the voice then leave it
[35:40] alone
[35:42] then i want to know what it says i want
[35:44] to know the word
[35:46] i don't want there to be some part of my
[35:48] understanding that lacks
[35:51] i don't want to have some part that's
[35:52] not well versed i want to know what i'm
[35:54] doing because i don't want to take any
[35:56] evil spirit very easily so as i was we
[35:59] were making this point last time
[36:02] and and we're still kind of not
[36:04] completely finished where we were
[36:07] but pure joy is found in being
[36:11] wide awake
[36:14] it's it's wherein you have a very
[36:16] healthy conscience it's one that's
[36:18] seared it's one that's not encumbered
[36:20] it's one that's not defiled or weak
[36:22] but it's a healthy conscience and then
[36:24] you are fully
[36:25] conscious okay so it's not just
[36:29] having a conscience but there's a
[36:31] there's an alertness there's an
[36:32] awareness now
[36:33] and i i know i realize that there might
[36:34] be some how they're synonymous and it
[36:36] may seem to be semantics but
[36:38] there's a there's a reality here that we
[36:42] find in the message
[36:43] as we looked last time in luke chapter
[36:45] 15 verse 17 about the prodigal son
[36:48] he had he was driven by a desire to take
[36:52] his inheritance
[36:53] go into the world squander it then join
[36:55] himself as a slave into a foreign
[36:56] country
[36:57] and lose all of his friends and he's an
[37:00] exhibiting
[37:01] uh inappropriate conduct for a son of
[37:03] his stature and he
[37:04] and he made very poor decisions for a
[37:06] son who was raised the way that he was
[37:08] and he finds himself in this deplorable
[37:10] condition the bible uses the phrase
[37:12] and when he came to himself jesus says
[37:16] when he came to himself almost as if
[37:18] he's waking up from an amnesia
[37:20] he came to himself it means he came to
[37:22] his senses you know
[37:23] he sobered up whatever lust had
[37:27] intoxicated him whatever desires had
[37:29] intoxicated him whatever ambition and
[37:30] dreams had driven him to do the wrong
[37:32] things
[37:32] now he sobers up and now he's thinking
[37:34] clearly
[37:36] wait a minute what am i thinking and we
[37:39] pointed out how that the joy of
[37:40] redemption was out of reach
[37:43] until he woke up to the reality of his
[37:45] sin
[37:47] the joy of redemption the joy of
[37:49] forgiveness the joy
[37:51] that he was to receive in restoration it
[37:53] was out of reach until he woke up
[37:56] because he couldn't show back up at the
[37:58] father's footsteps
[37:59] and drunk he couldn't show back up i i
[38:02] still intoxicated by the same lust that
[38:05] drove him away
[38:06] so he had to be fully awake and it
[38:07] wasn't just waking up to the reality of
[38:09] his sin
[38:10] when he came to himself he recognized
[38:13] his condition
[38:14] but then he also recognized the love of
[38:16] his father
[38:17] and he recognized that his father held a
[38:19] remedy for the condition that he was in
[38:21] and with the right kind of mind he said
[38:23] i won't go back and demand
[38:25] anything i'll go back willing to be a
[38:27] slave
[38:29] and so he when he came to himself he
[38:31] came to his senses
[38:32] he somebody was thinking clearly and let
[38:35] me say this
[38:37] and and this may be the mouthful that
[38:38] kind of signals
[38:40] uh what what i my heart has been
[38:42] indicting and even every single one of
[38:44] these services so far
[38:45] the bride's joy is found in waking up to
[38:48] the present realities of god's word
[38:52] that's that's the bride's joy it's not
[38:54] going to be in winning the lottery it's
[38:55] not if the sun's sweeping for
[38:57] the the bride's joy is found in waking
[39:00] up to the present realities of god
[39:04] the word of god teaches us that it's the
[39:06] manifestation of god that stirs the
[39:08] bride up
[39:09] it's the revelation of god's word that
[39:11] is the bride's
[39:12] stimulation of joy the stimulation of
[39:14] satisfaction
[39:15] listen you will not find it anywhere
[39:18] else if you've lived your life all these
[39:20] different decades feeling like something
[39:21] was missing
[39:22] and things don't ever seem to work out
[39:24] and you're always living behold this
[39:26] threshold of joy that you feel you have
[39:28] the potential for
[39:29] let me say it is the revelation of the
[39:31] word of god that can fill your tank
[39:34] it's a revelation of god that will give
[39:36] that completeness and satisfaction that
[39:38] you longed for
[39:41] how am i it's this statement that to me
[39:44] is so important they have not recognized
[39:49] the awakening of the bride
[39:54] well who was he talking about
[39:58] talking about a church world that was so
[39:59] close to the truth
[40:01] church the world that was entertaining
[40:03] the truth and hosting the truth and
[40:05] and very close and very near it but he
[40:07] says they have not
[40:08] recognized the awakening of the bride
[40:12] but instead of taking that statement and
[40:15] laughing at brother moore or
[40:17] laughing at life tabernacle or saying
[40:19] these things about these other people
[40:20] are you wide awake
[40:24] if they have not recognized the
[40:26] awakening of the bride has the bride
[40:27] recognized her awakening is she coming
[40:30] alive is she waking up
[40:31] then this is something realized if
[40:33] there's an awakening i want to be awake
[40:36] and we went through a number of
[40:37] scriptures that dealt with this
[40:38] principle of watch and be sober
[40:41] the bible says be sober be vigilant and
[40:43] we saw that how it meant
[40:45] let us be calm wise in one translation
[40:49] wide awake and when the bible said watch
[40:52] it speaks it speaks it comes from the
[40:54] root to raise up to
[40:55] cause to stand up to arouse from sleep
[40:59] and so when the bible says watch and be
[41:01] sober watch and be vigilant
[41:05] you have to rise from a slumbering state
[41:09] it says watch it's a recovery it's a
[41:10] waking up it's recovering
[41:12] from a dullness it's actually recovering
[41:14] from a disorientation
[41:16] well i'm not so sure what it is it
[41:18] doesn't seem clear i'm not sure but when
[41:20] you wake up
[41:20] you recover from that dullness you you
[41:23] recover from that
[41:24] that lack of sensitivity
[41:27] and so now if you would just turn to
[41:29] look at nehemiah chapter eight with me
[41:31] we'll start with verse five and i have
[41:32] the verses here on the board
[41:35] and i think what i'd like to do is maybe
[41:36] go through this rather quickly
[41:38] but i want you to kind of catch these
[41:41] things
[41:46] because and lord willing we could spend
[41:48] more time on it later
[41:50] but he says ezra opened the book in the
[41:53] sight
[41:53] of all the people and i was they could
[41:56] see it
[41:58] and it was done in such a way he's
[42:00] standing up above the people says for he
[42:01] was above the people
[42:02] he's standing on a pulpit and he opens
[42:04] the book inside of all the people and
[42:06] when he opened it all the people
[42:08] stood up this was something that caused
[42:11] the people to arise
[42:13] it caused them as you'll notice to come
[42:14] to attention and they're going to listen
[42:16] intentively they didn't have all their
[42:18] pic blankets laid out they're just kind
[42:20] of sitting around
[42:21] and coloring and doodling and all kind
[42:23] of entertaining themselves it's just
[42:25] kind of background noise
[42:26] no when this one stood up in this place
[42:29] all kids all those who could hear and
[42:31] who could understand
[42:32] notice that the book was open and the
[42:34] open book caused them to stand up
[42:36] and ezra blessed the lord the great god
[42:38] and all the people answered amen amen
[42:40] with lifting up their hands
[42:42] and they bowed their heads and worshiped
[42:43] the lord with their faces to the ground
[42:46] so here's ezra who is above all the
[42:48] people
[42:49] and he's the one that opens the book and
[42:51] causes the people to stand up and
[42:53] everyone can see this
[42:54] but then it says also jeshua and benai
[42:57] and sherabaya and jaman
[42:59] and akub and shabbat thai and hodahe
[43:02] and messiah and khalida and azera and
[43:04] josephat and hannah and pelia
[43:06] and the levites notice it says cause the
[43:11] people to
[43:12] understand the law and the people stood
[43:15] in their place
[43:17] so there was one that opens it and
[43:19] there's one that's giving this law
[43:21] but then there's others that can take
[43:23] this law and even translate the
[43:25] languages of the others who are gathered
[43:27] take the meaning that it's being said
[43:28] and then share it with the people
[43:30] and now they're giving it to the people
[43:32] and everyone has caused
[43:33] to the people to understand the law each
[43:36] one doesn't have his own interpretation
[43:38] they're all understanding exactly what's
[43:40] in that book that ezra opened up
[43:43] and they caused the people to understand
[43:45] so levites now in their place causing
[43:47] people understand and what is it doing
[43:48] it's
[43:48] placing the people positionally the
[43:50] people stood in their place
[43:52] no so they read in the book of the law
[43:54] as they so they read in the book of the
[43:56] law
[43:57] of god notice these words distinctly
[44:00] which means to make clear to clarify and
[44:03] gave the sense that means
[44:05] insight and wisdom and caused them to
[44:09] understand
[44:10] the reading those that were there with
[44:13] ezra
[44:14] didn't change the meaning didn't muddy
[44:17] up the understanding
[44:19] they they spoke in such a way to where
[44:21] they're not interfering with the truth
[44:24] and brother bottom even makes this
[44:25] statement in birth pains i hope that's
[44:27] simple enough that you can understand it
[44:29] these men if they pick this up
[44:32] pick up this and goes out with it they
[44:35] can make more
[44:36] sense to it bring it to a place you
[44:38] would
[44:39] i just want to lay this seed then hope
[44:42] they
[44:43] make it come to life
[44:46] now that doesn't change the life of it
[44:48] doesn't change the meaning of it
[44:49] but it brings it into manifestation it
[44:52] brings it to where
[44:53] you would do it you can understand it
[44:55] they make more sense to it doesn't mean
[44:57] they change it
[44:58] they don't add to it they don't change
[45:00] the life of it but they bring it to a
[45:02] place where you would
[45:04] this is the fidelity and faithfulness
[45:06] that god requires in this dynamic
[45:08] and so now they're reading it cause them
[45:10] to distinctly give sins
[45:12] cause and understand and nehemiah which
[45:13] is the trishafa and ezra the priest the
[45:16] scribe
[45:17] and the levites taught that taught the
[45:19] people
[45:20] said unto all the people they got the
[45:21] same thing to say
[45:23] this day is holy unto the lord your god
[45:25] mourn not nor weep
[45:27] for all the people wept when they heard
[45:28] the words of the law
[45:30] it caused a brokenness it caused a shame
[45:32] let me know how short we are
[45:34] think of all the things we've forsaken
[45:36] they can't believe for decades we've
[45:37] done this and we've done it wrong
[45:38] but it says then they said unto them go
[45:41] your way
[45:42] eat the fat and drink the sweet and send
[45:45] portions unto them for whom nothing is
[45:47] prepared oh my
[45:48] what a challenge to those of us who are
[45:50] the elect who've heard the words of this
[45:52] book
[45:53] to go and eat on it and feast on it and
[45:55] give a portion to those who don't have
[45:57] it
[45:59] for this day is holy unto the lord
[46:01] neither be you sorry
[46:04] for the joy of the lord is your strength
[46:07] don't cry don't weep john
[46:10] for the lion of the tribe of you to have
[46:12] propelled prevailed
[46:14] to loose the seals and and john's
[46:18] mourning is turned into joy this is the
[46:21] very basis for their
[46:22] they though they may have mourned and
[46:24] though they would be weeping he said the
[46:26] joy the lord is your strength
[46:28] and this being the message now from
[46:30] nehemiah and ezra it says the levites in
[46:32] verse 11. so the levites stealed all the
[46:34] people saying
[46:35] hold your peace for the day is holy
[46:38] neither be he grieved reinforcing the
[46:40] message that has gone forth reinforcing
[46:42] the conviction
[46:43] reinforcing the fact that they shouldn't
[46:44] be beat up with this truth they're not
[46:46] to be bound down
[46:47] they're not to be woe as me and feel
[46:48] sorry for themselves
[46:51] let me just say i feel like one of the
[46:52] most and i've maybe mentioned this
[46:53] before already
[46:54] that one of the most abused quotes in
[46:56] the message is the bride is one of the
[46:58] sickest bodies i know of
[47:01] that was true then but what he says in
[47:04] that context is there's more to this
[47:06] ministry
[47:06] than just physical healing in other
[47:08] words this ministry heals the sickness
[47:11] of the bride's body that ministry has
[47:13] been loosed
[47:14] the bride has received it she is risen
[47:18] she's no longer the sickest body there
[47:20] is why because she's received her
[47:22] ministry of healing
[47:24] and so here again it's the levites are
[47:26] reinforcing this hold your peace the day
[47:27] is holy neither be he grieved
[47:29] and all the people went their way to eat
[47:32] and to drink
[47:33] and descend the portions and to make
[47:36] great mirth
[47:37] why because the joy of the lord is your
[47:39] strength
[47:41] and how is it notice this at the end of
[47:43] verse 12 how is it they could make great
[47:45] mirth
[47:45] because they had understood the words
[47:49] that were declared unto them
[47:52] not just because they heard them
[47:56] and not just because they believed they
[47:57] were true but they understood them
[48:01] they could not have gone their way to
[48:02] eat to drink and to send portions
[48:04] and to enjoy the joy of the lord which
[48:06] is their strength
[48:07] until they had heard the words and
[48:10] understood the words
[48:11] that were declared to them let me say
[48:14] this
[48:15] this is the awakening we need
[48:18] this is the bride's awakening right in
[48:20] this context
[48:21] they understood the words that were
[48:23] declared unto them
[48:25] and in understanding the words the
[48:27] message was the joy of the lord is your
[48:29] strength
[48:30] the joy of the lord is your strength not
[48:32] ignorance and not just in mourning not
[48:33] just in repenting
[48:34] not just in grieving listen the
[48:36] laodicean church age does not end
[48:38] in the admonishment to repent but the
[48:40] laodicean church ages brought to a place
[48:42] of behold
[48:43] i stand at the door and knock
[48:49] john chapter 8 verse 32 this is what
[48:52] jesus says i believe you referenced this
[48:54] last time and this kind of
[48:55] provides this basis for
[48:58] how direct we could be in this context
[49:02] he says ye shall know the truth and the
[49:06] truth shall make you free
[49:08] the great mirth of the people the joy
[49:10] the lord which was their strength
[49:12] came upon understanding the words that
[49:14] were declared unto them
[49:16] in christ saying you shall know the
[49:18] truth and the truth
[49:20] shall make you free therefore our
[49:23] joy is filled by understanding
[49:26] our joy our happiness is informed by
[49:29] knowledge not by putting blinders on not
[49:31] trying to
[49:31] dumb ourselves down but it's fueled by
[49:33] understanding it's informed by knowledge
[49:37] if you're going to know you must be
[49:38] awake
[49:42] if you're i mean this is just obvious
[49:43] even brother adam was reading yesterday
[49:45] how he makes
[49:46] talks if you're dead all your senses are
[49:48] gone
[49:50] even talks about the different levels of
[49:52] dreams and different things he says well
[49:53] this is this happens when you're
[49:54] completely unconscious
[49:58] if we're going to know we must be awake
[50:04] if our senses are dull you can't see
[50:07] you can't learn you can't understand
[50:11] now and not just making that up just to
[50:14] kind of make a point
[50:15] if that's the case then god has an
[50:16] answer he has a remedy
[50:20] if we're talking about clean conscience
[50:21] it can only operate perfectly within a
[50:23] full consciousness
[50:26] what good would a full healthy
[50:28] conscience be if you weren't awake
[50:31] how could a conscience a pure conscience
[50:34] allow you to navigate correctly
[50:36] if you are not conscious of what you're
[50:38] navigating we can't have a clean
[50:40] conscience and a robust conscious
[50:42] and have this conscience that is pure
[50:43] and connected with the soul realm and
[50:45] boy we've got this
[50:46] we got this connection and my conscience
[50:47] is clean my sins are forgiven
[50:49] i i'm justified and then not be aware
[50:53] now be conscious not be fully awake
[50:57] and and this scripture is quickened to
[50:59] me yesterday in a very unique way and
[51:00] i'm going to admit on the outside that
[51:02] this is a different
[51:02] looking at it differently and taking a
[51:04] different attitude a different avenue in
[51:06] luke chapter 22
[51:08] verses 31 to 32 the lord said simon
[51:11] simon behold
[51:12] satan hath desired to have you that he
[51:15] may sift you as wheat
[51:17] i want you to remember again how satan's
[51:18] kingdom is built upon lies and deception
[51:21] satan use the double think satan uses
[51:23] the contradictions and wants you to
[51:25] believe both of them are true at the
[51:26] same time
[51:27] say it's trying to get you to a place
[51:28] where you're wore down and you dull your
[51:30] consciousness
[51:31] and he wants you to accept lies as the
[51:33] truth that is satan's kingdom
[51:36] and he says satan hath desired to have
[51:38] you that he may sift you as wheat
[51:41] and it struck me i thought well that's
[51:43] very odd
[51:44] because there's a principle in the
[51:46] scripture where that's exactly what god
[51:48] does
[51:50] that there's a separating out of the of
[51:52] the wheat the germ the life the seed
[51:54] from the shuck and the chaff
[51:56] and and i thought well that's that's
[51:58] interesting that satan would desire to
[52:00] sift us
[52:00] as wheat and how that his process of
[52:03] sifting us as wheat
[52:05] must be vastly different from the
[52:07] process when where the seed is not air
[52:08] with the shuck
[52:11] how there's a separate life moving on
[52:13] into the grain
[52:15] and he says but i have prayed for thee
[52:18] so i one hand satan wants to sift him as
[52:20] wheat
[52:21] but now christ prays for peter as a
[52:24] whole person
[52:25] satan's wanting a system christ prays
[52:27] for him and he says that thy
[52:29] faith fail not and when thou art
[52:32] converted
[52:33] strengthened thy brethren and in doing
[52:36] so
[52:37] it's this beautiful way of describing
[52:39] peter's conversion
[52:41] that satan wants to do one thing to
[52:43] peter but jesus prays differently for
[52:45] him
[52:46] just as paul said i pray that your whole
[52:48] soul mind and body be preserved
[52:50] blameless
[52:51] your soul spirit and body be preserved
[52:53] blameless satan wants to sift you as
[52:55] wheat but i
[52:56] prayed that not only would your faith
[52:57] fail not but that you'd also be
[52:59] converted which is the baptismal holy
[53:01] ghost
[53:02] that your soul would be sealed because
[53:04] of your faith
[53:05] right the new birth is the sealing of
[53:06] your faith you believe that god gives
[53:08] you the baptism the lord goes
[53:09] as a seal of your faith and then that
[53:10] puts him into action to where now
[53:12] he is able to strengthen the brethren
[53:17] his faith has led him to a ceiling and
[53:19] now he can now function
[53:20] as a person as a being with all the
[53:23] passions that kind of made him
[53:25] a unique and peculiar within the
[53:27] disciples and always the one that was
[53:29] even here he's like no i'll kill
[53:30] somebody for you jesus
[53:33] god is able not to take the person and
[53:36] take who peter was
[53:37] and through his faith his sealed faith
[53:39] in his conversion
[53:40] he's now going to strengthen the
[53:42] brethren
[53:44] so now this is this is how it struck me
[53:47] satan wants to separate you he wants to
[53:49] sift you as wheat
[53:52] now i i realize that that that's used in
[53:55] the context of
[53:56] you know stress you out and pound you
[53:58] and to beat you and to winnow you and
[53:59] put you on the threshing floor and
[54:00] there's a way that you're just getting
[54:01] beat up but what's his goal to separate
[54:03] you
[54:04] shift you and now the saint wants to
[54:07] separate the wheat the seed the soul
[54:09] from the shack in you
[54:13] right because you're you're a three-part
[54:15] person
[54:16] so what he want to do is get in there to
[54:18] where he can begin to divide you up
[54:21] where you have a soul but then you have
[54:23] the flesh and he wants to sift you to
[54:26] separate those things
[54:27] and in order to separate as he begins to
[54:29] separate them you begin to feel well i'm
[54:31] one person in my soul
[54:32] but i'm another person in my flesh and
[54:36] in separating that he creates this
[54:37] distress
[54:39] and it causes this disharmony in the
[54:41] mind which begins to wrestle with
[54:43] and fight against that rest that is in
[54:46] your soul
[54:47] and i've got this rest in my soul but i
[54:49] got this mind that's being bombarded
[54:50] i got this truth in life in my soul but
[54:53] i got this mind that has memory
[54:54] conscience reason and affection
[54:56] and imagination and he wants to kind of
[54:58] divide that
[55:00] and if he can separate that he puts us
[55:01] in a state of constant agitation
[55:03] and what he wants to do ultimately is
[55:05] put you in this place where you believe
[55:07] that you can have the rest of christ in
[55:09] your soul but not enjoyed in your spirit
[55:13] and he wants to sift you as weak to
[55:15] where now you're a divided person with
[55:16] double think
[55:17] i'm saved sealed delivered born again
[55:21] set free justified filled with the power
[55:24] of god in my soul
[55:25] but i'm bowed down in my spirit and
[55:28] that's a nasty trick of the party
[55:30] it's a nasty trick of the devil it's a
[55:32] nasty trick of a demagogue
[55:34] because god wants to take the life
[55:36] that's in your soul
[55:38] and harmonize your spirit to it
[55:43] just trying to weaken the influence of
[55:44] christ in your soul over your body
[55:47] do you realize the power in your soul is
[55:50] strong enough to say
[55:51] body get back in shape right now
[55:54] and have to obey it the soul has the
[55:57] ability to begin to place an
[55:59] image of a well body upon you
[56:02] and what does the devil try to do sift
[56:04] you as wheat
[56:06] all right fine she really believes she
[56:08] saved all right she really believes
[56:09] she's bribed fine i'll just let her be
[56:11] bride
[56:11] but i'ma separate out her flesh her mind
[56:14] and her body from her soul
[56:16] and i'll just let it live like that
[56:20] that's not how we're supposed to live
[56:26] but the brandon makes this statement in
[56:28] future home
[56:32] is that real to you i'm admitting it's a
[56:35] different look
[56:38] in message future home or the earthly
[56:41] bride in the heavenly bridegroom
[56:43] he makes the statement i'm trying to get
[56:44] the plan of redemption to you
[56:47] and that describe his ministry i mean
[56:50] that it's like what what was his mention
[56:52] he he delivered the plan of redemption
[56:54] to us
[56:55] he describes it and this is so beautiful
[56:57] in this very very rich
[56:59] rich sermon i'm trying to get the plan
[57:01] of redemption to you before
[57:03] if i don't get nothing else see
[57:07] if i don't get nothing else get the plan
[57:10] of redemption to you
[57:12] get your plan of redemption he says the
[57:15] baptism of fire on it
[57:17] he's talking about the earth only is to
[57:20] cleanse it
[57:21] and make it a meek fit place for his
[57:23] meek to live in
[57:25] so then he says like he did us his
[57:28] creation
[57:29] to live in what he does to the earth he
[57:32] does the individual what he does
[57:33] individually does the earth and it's the
[57:35] the sanctification the justification
[57:38] sanctification baptism the holy ghost
[57:39] the water
[57:40] the blood the spirit you know those
[57:42] different realms that he breaks that up
[57:43] in
[57:43] before he could come in it he had to
[57:46] give us the baptism of the fire
[57:48] then the holy ghost come in and live
[57:50] baptism of fire
[57:51] then when you get that baptism of the
[57:53] fire then the holy ghost can come in
[57:55] as it does now notice what it does hey
[57:58] let that fire go
[57:59] children this is what it does and if it
[58:02] hasn't
[58:03] just let it right don't question it just
[58:06] let it
[58:07] it burns up everything contrary to the
[58:09] word out of you
[58:12] burn burn lord
[58:15] let it burn if i've gotten in your way
[58:18] if i've dug trenches if i've done some
[58:19] remediation
[58:20] so that the hedges wouldn't burn large
[58:22] just burn it out of me whatever it is
[58:23] burn it out of me
[58:25] he says it won't believe nothing else
[58:27] but the word because it is the word
[58:29] now that's what we was talking about the
[58:31] other day the evidence of the holy ghost
[58:33] and i could find
[58:34] where earlier he was really hammering on
[58:36] this a few months earlier
[58:38] notice what he says the evidence of the
[58:40] holy ghost is
[58:41] the we were talking the other day of the
[58:43] evidence of the holy ghost the evidence
[58:44] of the holy ghost
[58:45] is when you can receive the word
[58:50] not some system not a demagogue
[58:54] not a party not a church not politics
[58:57] not preset pretense not cult of
[58:59] personality
[59:00] anybody want to throw something else out
[59:02] there think about
[59:04] it it can't be in any of that he says
[59:06] when you
[59:07] can receive the word not some system but
[59:10] have a clear understand
[59:14] i i often try to conjugate it in a way
[59:17] that
[59:18] it doesn't seem like a fragment but have
[59:19] a clear understand
[59:21] clear understanding is that maybe how i
[59:23] would think it might need to be
[59:24] ended but he says but have a clear
[59:26] understand how do you know the word is
[59:28] clear
[59:29] understand it watch
[59:33] catch that watch it vindicate itself
[59:37] that's how you know the word is clear
[59:39] what's the watch it vindicate itself we
[59:41] must see
[59:41] the vindication is the interpretation
[59:43] the interpretation is the vindication
[59:45] the manifestation of the promise that
[59:48] that's the vindication he says
[59:50] watch it vindicate itself he says well
[59:53] you say
[59:54] i see this do it and that oh yes weeds
[59:57] live the same way
[59:58] but it's got to be the entire word to
[1:00:02] the bride you have to be part of him he
[1:00:04] is the word
[1:00:05] and what a part of him is it the word
[1:00:08] that's promised for this day
[1:00:09] when he calls his bride be a part of
[1:00:12] that you get it
[1:00:13] now don't lose that now
[1:00:16] that's the plan of redemption he's
[1:00:18] trying to get to us he's saying
[1:00:20] and this is this is maybe i included all
[1:00:22] that in there because i'd really like to
[1:00:23] emphasize this
[1:00:24] maybe to try to connect it to in a later
[1:00:27] part
[1:00:28] the word that's promised for this day
[1:00:30] it's got to be the entire word
[1:00:32] that's what we're watching vindicate
[1:00:35] itself
[1:00:37] he's saying watch it you've got to see
[1:00:39] it you've got to understand it because
[1:00:41] he says the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:00:44] is not just merely say the holy ghost in
[1:00:46] you
[1:00:47] saying amen to every word but he says
[1:00:49] it's when you can receive the word
[1:00:51] and have a clear understand brother
[1:00:55] branham does not
[1:00:56] just leave us in this place where we're
[1:00:58] just believing
[1:00:59] and our believing kind of stunts us and
[1:01:01] we're just kind of dull and we're dim
[1:01:03] with it and we're just simpletons
[1:01:04] but our simply only believing loses us
[1:01:08] to a place
[1:01:09] where we can understand and i believe
[1:01:12] it's the bride's inheritance
[1:01:13] to see and to understand and to know the
[1:01:16] plan of redemption
[1:01:19] to have a clear understanding that's
[1:01:22] where satan would want to sift you as
[1:01:23] wheat
[1:01:25] to somehow have this well my soul knows
[1:01:29] but my mind i have no idea
[1:01:34] but my soul knows but boy this body boy
[1:01:36] it sure
[1:01:37] it sure is a lust demon you know what i
[1:01:38] mean no that that's that's incongruent
[1:01:41] that's disharmony
[1:01:44] but a clear understanding so
[1:01:47] going back to the beginning i'm not
[1:01:48] starting all over so don't get nervous
[1:01:51] but in first corinthians chapter 15
[1:01:52] verse 33
[1:01:55] be not deceived evil communications
[1:01:58] corrupt good manners
[1:02:00] if you keep company with the wicked it's
[1:02:02] saying you'll lose even the intelligence
[1:02:05] you have
[1:02:07] if you keep in the wrong company what
[1:02:09] you know and what you believe and what
[1:02:11] your convictions are
[1:02:12] can ultimately be watered down and
[1:02:14] you'll even lose the manners the
[1:02:16] intelligence you have now be not
[1:02:19] deceived evil communications corrupt
[1:02:21] good manners
[1:02:22] awake to righteousness and sin not for
[1:02:25] some
[1:02:25] have not the knowledge of god i speak
[1:02:27] this to your shame
[1:02:30] so he's taking these things together
[1:02:32] awake to righteousness and sin not
[1:02:33] return to soberness of mind
[1:02:35] return from drunkenness
[1:02:39] and he's talking about the doling of one
[1:02:40] senses the deadening of one's
[1:02:42] sensitivities he's talking about the
[1:02:44] lack of
[1:02:44] understanding he's referring to the
[1:02:47] intoxicating influences of myth truths
[1:02:50] where there would be these lies and
[1:02:51] these contradictions and this
[1:02:53] deadening down to where well i don't i
[1:02:55] just i don't really want to know i don't
[1:02:56] want to know i don't want to know i
[1:02:57] don't know don't understand or
[1:02:58] understand do we just get to this place
[1:03:00] where you're not really awake you're not
[1:03:01] really alert you've been lulled to sleep
[1:03:06] and he's identifying when he says awake
[1:03:08] to righteousness and i realize now
[1:03:11] that there was a lot of scriptures that
[1:03:12] we had used last time that this was
[1:03:14] following
[1:03:15] and so now as it kind of wells up within
[1:03:17] my heart i hope it doesn't seem to be a
[1:03:18] little bit disjointed
[1:03:20] but the the scriptures we read about the
[1:03:22] sleepiness
[1:03:23] and i'd taken out the parts even today
[1:03:25] where jesus is saying will you pray will
[1:03:27] you watch with me and pray
[1:03:28] and what do they keep doing the
[1:03:29] disciples keep falling asleep
[1:03:32] and the the sleepiness and the
[1:03:34] drunkenness
[1:03:35] is this apathy towards serious things
[1:03:39] this drunkenness this intoxication and
[1:03:41] this where this as brother brown
[1:03:43] identifies it
[1:03:44] plain church
[1:03:47] i was just playing church and listen
[1:03:51] playing church can look really really
[1:03:52] fun playing church can look really
[1:03:54] really serious
[1:03:56] playing church could look like wow this
[1:03:58] must be it but it's just a game
[1:04:00] why because there's this apathy to
[1:04:03] serious things
[1:04:04] there's this apathy towards things that
[1:04:06] are important things that are
[1:04:08] spiritually
[1:04:08] important and here in first corinthians
[1:04:11] chapter 15 paul is defending the truth
[1:04:13] of the resurrection
[1:04:16] he's standing for the truth that there
[1:04:17] will be a resurrection
[1:04:19] and he's going to arrive in first verse
[1:04:21] 51 on the mystery of the translation
[1:04:24] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[1:04:27] all
[1:04:27] sleep but we shall all be changed
[1:04:32] that's bride scripture we're not all
[1:04:34] gonna sleep
[1:04:36] we're not all gonna be lulled to sleep
[1:04:37] we're not all gonna be dead in our
[1:04:39] senses
[1:04:39] we're not all going to see partly and in
[1:04:42] part and have this dead and that dead
[1:04:44] we're not all going to sleep but we
[1:04:46] shall all be changed
[1:04:48] he's talking about the mystery of the
[1:04:49] translation he's defending the truth of
[1:04:51] the rapture
[1:04:53] he says in verse 32 if there is no
[1:04:55] resurrection of the dead
[1:04:56] he says let us eat and drink for
[1:04:59] tomorrow we die
[1:05:02] and what is he referring to these
[1:05:03] customs
[1:05:05] the creation the the athenians
[1:05:08] to their ways and that's why he quotes
[1:05:11] this athenian comedy immediately
[1:05:12] afterward be not deceived evil
[1:05:14] communications corrupt good manners
[1:05:16] he actually identifies this certain way
[1:05:17] of thinking in their political realm
[1:05:19] a certain way of living within their
[1:05:20] entertainment realm a certain way of
[1:05:22] articulating things and believing in
[1:05:24] things and enjoying things that's what
[1:05:25] they did they just said hey
[1:05:27] we're here to eat and drink for tomorrow
[1:05:29] we die and he calls it out he says don't
[1:05:30] be deceived
[1:05:33] evil communications corrupt good manners
[1:05:37] so he's referring to this drunkenness
[1:05:41] of let us eat and drink what is it
[1:05:45] ignorance is bliss just eat drink for
[1:05:48] tomorrow we die
[1:05:50] you realize just how short of your
[1:05:53] promise you would live
[1:05:55] if that's what you believed as a bride
[1:05:56] member
[1:05:58] just eat and drink because we're all
[1:06:00] going to die anyways
[1:06:03] ponder that a little bit we went through
[1:06:05] the scripture before how he says
[1:06:07] be not deceived evil communications
[1:06:09] corrupt good manners
[1:06:10] and so much your ethos your moral
[1:06:12] character
[1:06:13] how bad company the fellowship and
[1:06:15] around the wrong things will ruin your
[1:06:16] sentiments it ruins your
[1:06:18] nature it defiles who you are
[1:06:21] so paul's answer
[1:06:25] i i'm asking this individually so feel
[1:06:27] free to answer individually are you
[1:06:28] still with me to this point
[1:06:30] it's 11 38 we can all be conscious of
[1:06:32] the time
[1:06:34] i i don't feel pricked in my conscience
[1:06:36] that i'm too long
[1:06:38] so everything seems to be in a really
[1:06:39] good state of harmony right now
[1:06:41] but he's defending the resurrection he
[1:06:44] said if there is no resurrection live
[1:06:46] however you want
[1:06:48] he says if there's no resurrection then
[1:06:50] hey you know let us eat and drink
[1:06:53] for tomorrow we die but he's saying hold
[1:06:55] on the wrong kind of
[1:06:57] attitude the wrong kind of belief the
[1:06:58] wrong kind of approach
[1:07:00] is going to ruin your nature it's going
[1:07:02] to defile your spirit
[1:07:04] so he says awaken or come to
[1:07:08] a sober in right mind
[1:07:13] have your eyes opened to have your mind
[1:07:16] enlightened
[1:07:18] awake he says to righteousness that
[1:07:20] means what's proper and just
[1:07:22] but it also means to that which is right
[1:07:24] to that which is in harmony with the
[1:07:26] word
[1:07:27] in other words paul is looking at these
[1:07:29] to the in the corinthians
[1:07:30] and he's saying there's a mystery i want
[1:07:32] to show you a mystery
[1:07:34] this is a beautiful truth this is a
[1:07:36] reality we will not all sleep
[1:07:38] but we shall all be changed he says if
[1:07:40] there's not going to be a rapture
[1:07:42] we might say well then let us eat and
[1:07:43] drink for tomorrow we die
[1:07:45] but don't be deceived the wrong kind of
[1:07:47] attitude the wrong kind of awareness
[1:07:49] the wrong kind of understanding will
[1:07:51] ultimately defile your character
[1:07:52] and you'll not be living correctly so he
[1:07:54] says shake yourself
[1:07:56] from your complacency stop playing
[1:07:58] church
[1:07:59] shake yourself from your lethargy that's
[1:08:02] what paul is saying to the church
[1:08:04] awake to the true knowledge of god awake
[1:08:06] to righteousness
[1:08:07] and sin not
[1:08:12] let me ask you this do you know what
[1:08:14] wakes the bride
[1:08:16] have you been in this message have you
[1:08:17] been reading it do you know what the
[1:08:18] brethren said wakes this bride up
[1:08:21] and he says some have not the knowledge
[1:08:23] of god
[1:08:24] some do not know the truth
[1:08:29] some are ignorant of the mystery and
[1:08:32] listen nothing is more shameful
[1:08:34] than i think it's wesley that said it
[1:08:35] than the sleepy ignorance of god
[1:08:39] the sleepy ignorance the lethargic
[1:08:42] the unconcerned the dull
[1:08:46] ignorance of god
[1:08:51] bill abraham says in the indictment
[1:08:54] he says today men walk ignorantly
[1:08:58] they don't know that's the truth
[1:09:02] what tremendous parallel is he bringing
[1:09:04] the first crucifixion
[1:09:06] with another crucifixion he says today
[1:09:09] men walk ignorantly they don't know
[1:09:11] that's the truth
[1:09:12] they think it's some kind of ism they
[1:09:15] don't dig
[1:09:16] down deep enough to get into the spirit
[1:09:19] of revelation now you don't have to be
[1:09:23] the one who's saying crucify
[1:09:25] to become subject to an ism
[1:09:28] right you don't have to be the one
[1:09:30] saying it's wrong it's a called crucify
[1:09:33] to come subject to an ism he said as
[1:09:36] long as you don't dig down deep enough
[1:09:38] and get into the spirit of revelation
[1:09:40] then you can just be walking in it as
[1:09:42] some kind of ism
[1:09:44] he says they don't pray enough they
[1:09:45] don't call on god enough they just
[1:09:47] lightly take
[1:09:48] it notice oh well i believe there's a
[1:09:49] god sure
[1:09:52] go ahead and take this to the nth degree
[1:09:53] the devil believes the same thing
[1:09:55] the devil believes it more than some
[1:09:56] people claim to believe it the devil
[1:09:58] believes it and trembles
[1:09:59] people just believe it and go on
[1:10:03] oh come on can't you see how paul is
[1:10:05] saying awake awake to righteousness
[1:10:08] he says but the devil trembles no and
[1:10:10] his judgment is coming
[1:10:12] and people believe it and don't pay no
[1:10:14] attention
[1:10:15] the judgment is coming and he says
[1:10:18] guilty
[1:10:18] of crucifying him he says today men
[1:10:22] walking ignorantly
[1:10:23] guilty of crucifying him sure he says i
[1:10:26] indict
[1:10:27] this generation finding them guilty by
[1:10:30] the same word that found them guilty at
[1:10:32] the beginning
[1:10:33] that's right jesus said who can condemn
[1:10:36] me
[1:10:36] he was the word made flesh and today the
[1:10:39] same word
[1:10:40] is made flesh that's heavy i can on i
[1:10:44] can't hardly lift that
[1:10:46] that's heavy what is he building around
[1:10:49] today men walk ignorantly
[1:10:52] i i feel like maybe there's
[1:10:55] i'm not being a very good
[1:10:58] brick mason today and there's like maybe
[1:11:00] some gaps and stuff that we're not quite
[1:11:02] filling in
[1:11:03] but this is this is where you're this is
[1:11:05] where you're placed
[1:11:09] and let me try let me just bring this
[1:11:11] too a close i have a statement i'd like
[1:11:13] to read i didn't know if i'd be able to
[1:11:14] get to it but it's
[1:11:15] it's amplifying on that they have not
[1:11:17] recognized the awakening of the bride
[1:11:20] and it'll just make a wonderful platform
[1:11:21] to go forward
[1:11:23] you know i just kind of pondering this
[1:11:26] in closing that people
[1:11:29] people can claim to be happy right
[1:11:32] you ever find somebody who's who is in
[1:11:35] this particular state where they're
[1:11:36] saying i'm the happiest i've ever been
[1:11:37] but it's very obvious
[1:11:38] they're really the most miserable
[1:11:39] they've ever been
[1:11:43] and so at best they're just unaware
[1:11:47] but ponder this at worst they're
[1:11:48] willfully ignorant
[1:11:51] and brother man says today men walk
[1:11:53] ignorantly
[1:11:55] and there's a standard in the law where
[1:11:56] one is willfully ignorant
[1:11:58] and that's a decision in bad faith to
[1:12:01] avoid
[1:12:02] becoming informed about something
[1:12:06] so that you avoid having to make
[1:12:07] decisions that that information might
[1:12:09] prompt
[1:12:12] you thinking about that trying to find
[1:12:14] somebody whose face lit up
[1:12:16] so i can just look at you get me home
[1:12:20] will for ignorance is don't tell me
[1:12:23] because if i know
[1:12:25] then i'll probably have to act according
[1:12:27] to that knowledge
[1:12:29] and i really don't want to i'd rather
[1:12:32] not know because if i knew
[1:12:34] then it might make me responsible i
[1:12:36] might be accountable so in other words
[1:12:38] in bad faith i will just i choose not to
[1:12:41] know
[1:12:41] so i can remain as i am so that i don't
[1:12:44] have to make decisions
[1:12:45] based upon the information that's
[1:12:47] presented to me
[1:12:49] let me say this to you as the bride of
[1:12:51] jesus christ there should be nothing
[1:12:53] that you're afraid of knowing
[1:12:55] nothing that you should be afraid of
[1:12:57] knowing why because we can say that
[1:12:59] there's nothing
[1:13:00] in the will of god i fear and there's
[1:13:02] nothing out of his will that i want
[1:13:05] therefore i am not afraid to know his
[1:13:07] will
[1:13:11] this willing ignorance will ignore the
[1:13:15] truth just to find some place of
[1:13:16] contentment
[1:13:19] just so that well if i knew then that
[1:13:20] might change things
[1:13:22] if i find out then that might change
[1:13:24] things
[1:13:25] and so they become willfully ignorant in
[1:13:27] order to find rest
[1:13:28] in today's chaos and if you're elected
[1:13:31] this you'll never find it
[1:13:34] until you come to know
[1:13:38] the bride will only find joy and truth
[1:13:41] nothing else and
[1:13:44] and if i can say this the greater
[1:13:45] understanding of the truth the greater
[1:13:47] joy
[1:13:50] musicians if you could come wide awake
[1:13:55] it's not ignorance it's not double think
[1:14:00] it's a sound mind it's being wide awake
[1:14:03] so you don't miss it
[1:14:05] wide awake so that when the word is
[1:14:07] opened you stand
[1:14:10] and then you your tension is drawn to
[1:14:12] the book
[1:14:14] and then it's distinct and there's sense
[1:14:18] given to it
[1:14:20] and the mystery is removed to you
[1:14:24] and then you know you know how to run
[1:14:26] with it
[1:14:28] you know how to walk in it and that
[1:14:30] becomes your source of joy
[1:14:34] brother branham says in recognizing your
[1:14:36] day and its message he says everywhere
[1:14:38] now there's no revival
[1:14:40] everyone is complaining ministers crying
[1:14:43] i was reading one of the outstanding
[1:14:44] papers that comes here to the church a
[1:14:46] very fine paper i know the editor and i
[1:14:47] know the people
[1:14:48] and they're godly people verifying
[1:14:50] brother and sister more of the herald of
[1:14:51] his coming
[1:14:52] one of the finest papers on the field
[1:14:54] herald of his coming i think it's in the
[1:14:56] third seal brother brown's making
[1:14:57] reference to this very same thing
[1:14:59] but they can hardly they'll hardly print
[1:15:02] anything unless
[1:15:03] it's about fast pray
[1:15:06] fast pray sounded trumpet he says how
[1:15:09] many
[1:15:10] reads it you know you see it all the
[1:15:12] time fast pray
[1:15:13] fast pray it's all you hear
[1:15:17] fast pray we're gonna have a great
[1:15:19] break-in of the day there's gonna
[1:15:20] a great thing going to happen and you
[1:15:22] pray pray pray we're not too late yet
[1:15:26] i don't believe he's being cynical i i
[1:15:29] don't believe that he's being
[1:15:30] condescending at all
[1:15:31] he's just identifying that here's a
[1:15:33] magazine called the herald of his coming
[1:15:36] and all they're telling you is to pray
[1:15:37] pray pray fast pray and he says why do
[1:15:39] they do that
[1:15:41] why do they do that and this is sincere
[1:15:43] they want a great awakening
[1:15:46] they're crying believing there will be
[1:15:49] awakening
[1:15:51] they're good people why is it what have
[1:15:54] they done
[1:15:56] they have not recognized
[1:15:59] the awakening of the bride they're
[1:16:03] they're still calling for fast pray fast
[1:16:05] pray sound to trumpet
[1:16:07] oh we're going to have a great breaking
[1:16:08] of the day there's going to be a great
[1:16:10] thing happened
[1:16:11] oh hopefully we're not too late and what
[1:16:13] does brother branham point to
[1:16:14] he says what they're missing is the
[1:16:16] awakening of the bride
[1:16:18] that's what they're looking for that's
[1:16:19] what they're trying to herald that's
[1:16:20] what they're trying to pray for that's
[1:16:22] what they're fasting for and they've
[1:16:24] missed what they're crying for
[1:16:26] what they want is happening right before
[1:16:28] them they have not recognized the
[1:16:30] awakening of the bride
[1:16:31] oh let me say may none of us miss it
[1:16:34] this is our awakening i don't want to
[1:16:37] miss it
[1:16:39] i want to recognize it he says by being
[1:16:42] a christian they feel the pull of the
[1:16:44] hour
[1:16:46] so there's something they feel something
[1:16:48] right there's some sense
[1:16:50] there's some part of them that kind of
[1:16:52] it feels something
[1:16:55] he says but they feel the pull of the
[1:16:56] hour but they haven't recognized what's
[1:16:58] been done
[1:17:00] that's what's making them feel that way
[1:17:02] they know something is supposed to
[1:17:04] happen
[1:17:05] but see they're looking for way off in
[1:17:07] the future
[1:17:10] he says when it's already happened right
[1:17:12] by you
[1:17:14] now we can actually think about our
[1:17:16] neighbors in the apartment next door
[1:17:17] right
[1:17:18] it happened right by him and they're
[1:17:19] missing it he says when it's happened
[1:17:22] right by you that's the same thing they
[1:17:25] did in the old days
[1:17:26] draw on this parallel again like you did
[1:17:28] in the indictment
[1:17:30] they was believing in the coming messiah
[1:17:33] they believed that there would be a
[1:17:34] forerunner come
[1:17:35] but it was right on them and they didn't
[1:17:37] know it how obvious is this right
[1:17:41] how obvious is this to us
[1:17:46] they didn't recognize it they believed
[1:17:49] there would be
[1:17:50] come a forerunner that would fall around
[1:17:53] the messiah and they cut his head off
[1:17:56] and killed their messiah because it was
[1:17:58] prophesied
[1:17:59] that they would be blinded so they
[1:18:02] killed the they cut off the head of the
[1:18:05] forerunner
[1:18:06] and killed their messiah because it was
[1:18:08] right
[1:18:09] on them and they didn't know it
[1:18:12] and brother branham is now trying to
[1:18:13] bring this very this very same thought
[1:18:15] we're just trying to be very faithful to
[1:18:16] the way that he says it
[1:18:18] and says they too have not recognized
[1:18:21] the awakening of the bride
[1:18:24] she's received her stirring she's
[1:18:27] received her
[1:18:28] message that raises her up she's
[1:18:30] received her word
[1:18:32] that wakes her up and he's saying today
[1:18:34] men walk ignorantly
[1:18:35] what are the ignorant men doing they're
[1:18:36] crucifying the lord
[1:18:38] again crucifying him is afresh
[1:18:42] and then recognizing your day in its
[1:18:43] message he says they killed the
[1:18:44] forerunner they killed the messiah
[1:18:48] and it happens right by him and they
[1:18:50] miss it
[1:18:51] that's a lot to ponder isn't it that's a
[1:18:53] lot to think about let's stand
[1:19:00] lord i don't want to walk ignorantly
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:03] lord i don't want to miss it
[1:19:10] [Music]
[1:19:16] let's bow our heads
[1:19:22] [Music]
[1:19:26] gracious heavenly father
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:35] i know that i'm just leaning deeper into
[1:19:39] a thought that
[1:19:40] certainly merits
[1:19:43] more time and attention as it relates to
[1:19:47] the fulfilling of the word of god in
[1:19:48] this last day
[1:19:50] [Music]
[1:19:52] but lord i realize that i'm not speaking
[1:19:54] to novices i'm not speaking to people
[1:19:57] who have not heard but those who have
[1:19:59] heard
[1:20:00] [Music]
[1:20:01] and those that have ears to hear and
[1:20:03] eyes to see
[1:20:07] and as it was expressed in the book of
[1:20:08] nehemiah those who've seen the book open
[1:20:10] have stood on their feet
[1:20:13] lord i want to be faithful as a levite
[1:20:15] to say
[1:20:17] what is in that opening of the word
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:22] and lord there's a
[1:20:27] there's a juncture lord that i see
[1:20:33] that as the bride of jesus christ our
[1:20:35] our contentment our satisfaction and our
[1:20:37] joy is going to be a knowing
[1:20:41] and seeing and watching the word
[1:20:44] vindicated
[1:20:46] the bride in the days of nehemiah heard
[1:20:49] the word and maybe at first it seemed to
[1:20:51] them to be a fearful thing and
[1:20:54] kind of disconcerting and it caused them
[1:20:56] to be sad but
[1:20:58] as it was rehearsed further they were
[1:21:00] told that this
[1:21:01] is their strength
[1:21:06] that the lord's joy his will his
[1:21:08] satisfaction his word
[1:21:12] is their strength lord i pray that we
[1:21:15] would as the bride of jesus christ
[1:21:17] recognize how satan's kingdom tries to
[1:21:20] use
[1:21:21] subtly ignorance is bliss and ignorance
[1:21:24] and strength to cause us to be bound by
[1:21:26] lies and contradictions
[1:21:29] but it's your word that liberates us
[1:21:33] sets us free so i pray lord that today
[1:21:36] in this
[1:21:40] in this gathering that that would be our
[1:21:41] takeaway
[1:21:43] that there's a word lord not even
[1:21:45] realizing now father just some of the
[1:21:47] things that were left out that
[1:21:48] this word wakes us up
[1:21:52] there's a voice that wakes us up
[1:21:56] there's a message that moves the amnesia
[1:21:59] there's a water that washes not only our
[1:22:02] souls but our spirits
[1:22:05] there's a word that is taking satan's
[1:22:08] agenda to sift us
[1:22:10] as wheat and is gonna separate us
[1:22:14] out as a person complete in redemption
[1:22:18] to be preserved body spirit and soul
[1:22:21] in eternity and i pray lord that we
[1:22:25] would
[1:22:27] not be distracted
[1:22:30] that we would stay attentive to the
[1:22:32] voice
[1:22:34] that we would stay focused upon the word
[1:22:39] and recognize that truth makes us free
[1:22:43] and that our joy is not connected with
[1:22:45] ignorance our joy is not
[1:22:48] in this as the bible even derides this
[1:22:52] simplicity this willful ignorance and
[1:22:55] this dumbing down
[1:22:57] lord may we avail ourselves to
[1:22:59] revelation and the stimulation of it may
[1:23:01] we seek you
[1:23:02] may we desire to know and to understand
[1:23:04] it
[1:23:06] i i know that may seem lofty and maybe
[1:23:09] just to think in terms of wow all the
[1:23:11] revealing of the word and the
[1:23:12] manifestation of god and the indictment
[1:23:14] and the crucifixion and
[1:23:16] all these different things lord it's the
[1:23:18] same language of
[1:23:20] repent and be baptized
[1:23:24] that must be done through an awareness
[1:23:26] and an acknowledgement
[1:23:29] the people on the day of pentecost were
[1:23:30] pricked in their hearts
[1:23:32] lord may the words still prick today
[1:23:36] and may we be faithful to walk in the
[1:23:38] word as it's made known to us
[1:23:40] bless your people today in the name of
[1:23:43] the lord jesus christ
[1:23:45] amen
