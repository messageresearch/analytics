TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hebrews chapter 1 verse one. God who at sunundry times and in diverse manner spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds. Who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power. when he had by himself purged our sin, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high, being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. For under for unto which of the angels said he at any time, thou art my son this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten in the world, he saith, "And let all the angels of God worship him." And I guess verse seven, I don't think I I do go to verse nine. And the angels he say of the angels, he saith, who maketh his angel spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. But under the son he saith, thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever. The scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity. Therefore, God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. Amen. God's son is better than the angels. He has a scepter of righteousness. Speaks to Jesus Christ. What glorious uh verses we've read. You could be seated. I'm going to give the title this evening of portrait of humanity. Portrait of humanity. And if you could take in just a little bit uh this title slide because I want to revisit it here in just a little bit. I'm very excited about tonight's topic and um and I just believe that there's something very simple that's revealed in this. It's very straightforward, but it should be thoughtprovoking. I don't expect it to be very lengthy, but I'd really like you um just to focus in the short little time we have together and think of this portrait of humanity. On Sunday, we spoke on portrait of a perfect man. And in looking at that, we're drawing from uh the stature of a perfect man and how that in Jesus Christ uh was expressed this image of God and we're using this idea of a portrait. At the very beginning, we talked about how that art has power to influence our belief and that the way things are portrayed in verse or poems or in literature and even in the visual arts that it can influence culture and cultural values because it has great ability to embed itself in the mind. It's for this reason. I don't know if people are getting distracted. Maybe brother Mitch, we should maybe take that down. I'm starting to get to think I want to People are thinking about what in the world did he just show us? But something to think about. And um but [laughter] I maybe some of us haven't even considered this, but there's a reason why many people believe the wise men were at the manger scene when Jesus Christ was born. And the reason why they believe that often is because that's the way it's portrayed in picture. It's portrayed that way in art. It's it's sung that way in songs. And so we just in our minds imagine the wise men being at the manger scene. But scripturally, the wise men were not there at the manger scene. They came later when he was a child. And we used to have this joke in our family growing up that uh whenever we'd set up the manger scene, uh there was actually wise men that went along with it and we always said they should be in the front yard or we should put them in the backyard cuz they're still on their way there. But it's that image of the wise men being there that causes many just to assume they were there or to have that belief. And that's the power of art. And so as uh art has the ability to or and has been used to reflect uh cultural values, if its representation is not true, then instead of mirroring reality, it can change reality. Just like that image of the wise men, it can actually shape culture because you present an image that you want that you think is right. But if it's not right, then instead of it reflecting culture, it can actually have great power to shape culture. So art has that ability to embed itself in our minds. And we're we're using this thought that the scriptures speak to us and paint the picture of Jesus Christ. If we want to know who Jesus Christ is, we can start with this Bible. The New Testament tells us his story and it paints the picture of Jesus Christ. And so therefore, that picture must be accurate. It must be portrayed. And we covered a lot on Sunday that we're not going to get into tonight, but we're we're definitely drawing from that. Now in this sermon portrait of humanity, I'm asking really what is the image of man that's painted by the life of Jesus Christ. We know that we believe that he was the son of God. He was uh born of a virgin, but he was not conceived by man. So that we say that he was a man, a god man that he was both all man and all god. And so there's a there's this humanity to Christ otherwise he could not have died. Uh there's a humanity. So what is this image of man that's painted by the life that Christ lived? Hebrews chapter 1 verse one it says God who at sunundry times and in diverse manner spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he hath made the world. So, that's a lot that's being said in that statement. And we see that Jesus Christ is uh who had come in the flesh, who had most recently walked upon earth. He says that's what he's referring to. He's spoken to us by his son through Jesus Christ. Verse three, who be the brightness of his glory in the expressed image of his person. Jesus Christ is the expressed image of God. Covered a lot of those scriptures on Sunday. He and we're going to see here he's endued with power over all things and and the express image of his person upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins. We see the lamb of God in that sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. So now he's that in that position of power and authority being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. A lot of lot of words in here, a lot of phrases, a lot of truths that are being packed together. But he's made higher than the angels. And he secured an inheritance of all power, all honor, and all glory. And he had a calling to be a sacrifice for sins. He has purged sins by the sacrifice of himself. He's not just an angel, but he is the son of God. And he's obtained this inheritance. Says in Colossians 1 19, for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell. Fullness of God dwells in the Son. Colossians chapter 2:9, for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily. &gt;&gt; This is who Jesus Christ is. He is the express image of God. &gt;&gt; When you've seen me, you've seen the father. &gt;&gt; He is the heart of God. He is God in flesh. He is the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; The fullness of God dwelt in him. The fullness of the Godhead bodily is manifested in him. In John chapter 17:es 1:7, these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come. Glorified thy son that thy son also may glorify thee, as thou hast given him power over all flesh." This is what has been committed to Jesus Christ. He has power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. Look at this incredible role that the son has now as being the express image of God has been given power over all flesh. Uh it says in in John in one place just before the uh the last supper that knowing that all things have been given into his hands that he came from God and went to God. Says and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent. Verse four says I have glorified thee on earth. I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. So think of this expression of the son. He is God in flesh. He has power over all other flesh. He was given a work to do. He says he's finished it. And now, oh father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. I have manifested thy name. This is what a son does. He manifest his the father's name. I've manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world. Thine they were, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. This is uh there's more words that we could share. There's a lot of scriptures that we could use in these instances that speaks of Christ in Hebrews 11 and also in Colossians and now in John 17 about Jesus Christ having this role. He only does what the father tells him to do. He acts and speaks according to the directions that God gives him. Therefore, he's manifesting God's will and God's desire. And he says, and we see here that God's son had a commission to do God's work and to declare or manifest his name. So, as the gospels tell the story of Jesus Christ, they're painting a picture of God. We can read that he was the express image of his person. He upheld everything by the word of his power. That he finished the works that he was given to do. that whatsoever things you gave me or of thee, the disciples know this. How h how h how what are these things? It's that which is portrayed in this short window to his life. We see him at his birth. We see him at 12 years old. Then we see him at his baptism. And we see this brief look into his life and his ministry of those three and a half years we often say and that is a picture of God unfolding himself. So, in this portrait of Jesus Christ, it expresses the image of God. I looked at um well, there's different ways that you can number it. Some say 40, some say 30 or 31, but I looked at all these different miracles in Jesus Christ's ministry. And let's just I I I want to go by way more of summary than turning to the different scriptures. I thought about maybe turning to some and reading them, but I think we're well verssed on a Wednesday night. I feel very comfortable just referring to them. But we know that Jesus had dominion over nature &gt;&gt; when he was in the boat there on the sea and it was being tossed about and he they said he sleeps. He said they they woke him up and what did he do? He spoke to the winds and the waves and he said peace uh be still. And what happened? He calmed the storm. He stealed the waves. Waves. So he had dominion over nature by calming the storm. And then if we can see in this picture that I gave you at the beginning, he had he upset even those those laws of nature. Brother Mitch, if we could get that uh that slide up there. I think it's the next one on there. Yeah, there we go. That he calmed that he had power over the laws of nature by walking on water. You're not you're not supposed to be able to do that. What is that? That's defying natural laws or he had power over them. that he was not just subject to law, the law of na nature. He but he had power over it. And as you look at this picture, it might seem odd to you, but this was a painting done by a Christian uh a Korean Christian artist, and he did a series of 31 paintings, and I was able to uncover all of them. It was quite a work just to find the digital rep um reproduction of it. And he painted the life of Jesus from the enunciation to Mary all the way to his ascension and these different instances in his ministry. But he painted him how he might have looked in traditional Korean dress. And I thought it was good because when we think about the portrait of Jesus Christ, uh that this this would be what he perhaps would have looked like had he been a Korean messiah. &gt;&gt; So I'm not I'm not sharing it maybe uh to to for humor, but this is him walking on the water, Peter in the waves, and he's he's being characterized just as a normal man. And of course, the the halo kind of gives them that aura of deity, but this is Christ now walking on the wave supernaturally, having power over gravity, over nature to walk on the water. And Peter steps out and he starts doing it, too. And it's represented in this picture. Think of all these instances where not only does he have dominion over nature, but he turns water into wine. &gt;&gt; Again, that that has some power over the elements. He multiplied the bread and the fish. In the next slide, this is a a representation of him multiplying out creation, taking bread and multiplying, taking fish and multiplying it. This is what this is God being expressed amongst the people. He caused uh and in some instances they call it a miraculous catch where he said, "Cast your net over here." And they brought in a a catch that was miraculous. He able to place a coin as it were into a fish's mouth. In the next slide we see him healing the sick. He healed the sick in multiple instances. The blind received their sight. The lepers were cleansed. The crippled could walk. The deaf heard. The mute spoke. Talks about one with dropsy. Those with blood issues. God did all these Christ did all these things. And what was he expressing? The father. &gt;&gt; And each one of these instances he was expressing the father. And the reason why I chose to use this type of artwork is because if this is it would have just looked like maybe a normal scene, &gt;&gt; but yet something supernatural is unfolding. &gt;&gt; He restored that uh soldier's ear when he had been cut off. He took a withered hand and restored that back. See, in many different instances where he controlled the spiritual realm by casting out demons. &gt;&gt; This is all done by Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had power over life to curse a tree. He had power over death to raise the dead. &gt;&gt; He did all this in manifesting the father. So, uh, if I could say this without spending a lot of time on that, I do want you to think about all these supernatural miracles that he did. Raising the dead, multiplying creation, walking on water, stopping the storm. these uh from the moment that he turned water into wine to where he healed the noble man's son to where he spoke and at that same hour this person was healed where he he said things without even touching them and they were healed a blood issue was healed just by someone touching the hem of his garment all these different things were the an expression of God &gt;&gt; but this is where I'm turning it just a little bit not just an expression of God but also a portrait of humanity &gt;&gt; in Philippians chapter 2:ES 6-11 it says who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God speaking of Jesus Christ but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men so we see where he was the express image of his person made in the likeness of God he had the name image and likeness of God but now he's found in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. We see how this is mirrored also in Hebrews. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Amen. &gt;&gt; God was in, excuse me, God was in Christ, the Bible tells us, reconciling the world to himself, but Christ came in the form of a man. And when you look at the story of Jesus Christ in the Gospels, the painting of Christ paints the picture of man that he came as a man. And when they looked at him, you being a man not over 50, you being the son of Joseph, he he had these he wept. He hungered. There all these different characters about him where he was made in the fashion of fashion as man. But when he was performing these miracles, I've I've I've offered that that was a portrait of humanity as well. He controlled nature. He he had power over life and death. But look at man in the beginning because it says he was made in the likeness of man in Genesis 1:es 26-30. And God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion. So this is man as he was originally intended to be. God was made man was made in the image of God &gt;&gt; in the likeness of God and given the power of God as a God on earth. He had dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image. In the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. So we could say that man originally was in the image and likeness of God. Not a begotten son but a created son in the image of God. And God blessed them, and said unto them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." Do you see the parallel now to when Jesus Christ has power to say, "Cast your net over here," and there's a miraculous catch. He has a coin in a fish's mouth. When he's able to take creation and multiply it out, he's able to command to the winds to be still. He's able to walk on the water. He's expressing something that was innate in man in the beginning. God said, "Behold, I've given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the earth as he multiplied out that bread." He had power over that grain originally, over everything I've given it to you. Over every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth, every tree which is the which is the fruit of the tree yielding seed. He could curse a fig tree. Jesus could. But man was originally given that power. To you it shall be for meat. to every beast of the earth and to every foul of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the earth where then there is life. I have given every green herb for meat and it was so. We could say Adam was God on earth. We say that about the second Adam, he was God in flesh, the word made flesh. He was the son of God. But Adam was a created son of God as God on earth &gt;&gt; endued with power and authority with this dominion. As a son, he was heir to all the father's work to his creation. And he God had created it up to that point. He said, "Here it is. It's yours. Finish the work." &gt;&gt; He was to further the father's vision. In the Hebrew, son means a builder of the family name. Says in 1 Corinthians 1:7, excuse me, 11:7, "For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God." &gt;&gt; This is this is humanity. This is man. He is in the image and glory of God. Now, I know that there's uh maybe some of you your thoughts are really running here, but think of how that that Christ came and bypassed any human means of blood cell and sperm and egg. And he didn't come forth through anything that would be hybrid, anything that would be mixed. So he's not the genes of Mary and the genes of Joseph, but he comes and he bypasses that. And having bypassed that kind of conception, though he's born of a woman, he steps forth as in in a way as the first Adam did &gt;&gt; without any kind of mixing or hybridity. No, no this gene or this ethnicity or nothing nothing mixed in. Adam came stepped from God by the spoken word. His flesh made out of uh the elements of the earth. Now Christ comes forth and we could say that he is the last Adam, the second Adam &gt;&gt; as a as a restoration of Adam's race and Adam and man in the beginning was in the image and the glory of God. &gt;&gt; So when we look at these supernatural miracles of Jesus Christ, I just take me just uh I don't want to say humor me, but consider it this way. It's not a portrait of divinity. It is a portrait of humanity. &gt;&gt; Because when we READ IN GENESIS 1, MAN WAS GIVEN POWER. &gt;&gt; Man could have walked on water. Man could have multiplied creation. Man could have subdued all the fish and the foul. Man could have turned water into wine. Man man could have done all those things. And now Christ is doing it not as this, oh wow, LOOK WHAT GOD could do, but oh wow, look what man can do. John 5:36 he says, "But I have greater witness than that of John." This is Jesus speaking, "For the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that I do." He bear witness of me that the father hath sent me. Jesus said, "I am finishing the father's works." The works that I do are to finish a divine work. What was it that Adam was to do? To carry out and fulfill a divine work. But it was the work of humanity. It was the work of flesh. Do you realize that God is not doing something unseen in heaven? The lamb was slain before the foundation of the world, but it had to be manifested here. It had to be manifested in flesh. So God's just not happy. And God's just not one that has all these things in another dimension. And he's happy being God and just every once in a while he messes with our minds by doing something in the world that upsets things and things get turned upside down and I cause the world to flood. Woohoo. Look what happened. Everybody doesn't know what. No, God wants to be seen and to known and be expressed. And he does that through flesh. So Christ on earth is the father made flesh. And he says, I'm finishing the father's works. The same works I do. Then in John 14:12, verily, verily, I send to you, he that believeth on me. The works that I do shall he do also. And greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my father. &gt;&gt; Now the works that Christ did, you'll do. the very same works &gt;&gt; as he was able to have dominion and power, heal the sick, raise the dead, cast out devils, and all these things that Christ portrayed the Messiah did in the flesh as a man. He's saying, "These works shall you do also." Now, if he had been an apparition and just a ghost or we're just kind of uh uh trying to read the tea leaves as it were and things are happening and we're just kind of suspicious that this must be God, this must be the Messiah, uh then it would be something unattainable that we would just be submitting ourselves to some sort of sorcery or witchcraft, some divination to make things happen. But yet, this was God in flesh doing these things. And now we believe that if the same God is in us, &gt;&gt; not only will he quicken our mortal bodies now, but then he'll give us power over death. He gives us power to raise the dead. Gives us power to go create a world and live on it. &gt;&gt; Because that's what God can do in man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he could do it on his own without man. But God uses man. &gt;&gt; In Romans chapter 8 14 to 21, for as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba, father. Brother Steven Coffee used this verse uh on Wednesday night last week. It was just very beautiful. I thought that service was extraordinary. I meant to mention it, but uh he said that I if we are not if we are not able to express Christ to the community and he said, "What good is church?" Right? &gt;&gt; I thought it was just so so profound the things he expressed in that service. He said, 'The spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was the son of God. What does the Bible said? The firstborn among many brethren. So there's some sort of there's this equality that we begin to have with Jesus Christ. And what I'm wanting you to recognize is the things that we most often would say are godlike and supernatural. OH, THAT'S GOD. THOSE are human. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the sons of God and if children then hes of God and joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together. So there's the we're children of God. We're heirs of God. We're joint airs with Christ. We've been elevated to the same role in this position through the blood of Jesus Christ with Christ. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad that there is a promise of glory for all the things that we suffer. And so we know then that whatever it is we endure, persevere through, whatever it is that's most difficult for us, that pain we could say is expectant and it must deliver glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. for the earnest expectation of the creature. Notice this, the earnest anticipation, the hope of creation waits for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; All of creation, &gt;&gt; the waves, the wind, the the the grass, the the all the herb. Go back and read in Genesis 1. All these things that man was given to be uh have dominion over and it was given to them. every herbbearing seed, all the fish and the foul and all the beast and all those things that creepeth. Man was placed to rule over it. So when man lost this glory in the fall and as man be to be hybrid and and weakened a a and now steps forth degenerate through his natural birth, creation has been longing for this restoration of everything that was lost in the fall for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by the reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope. Because the creation, the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Sons and daughters of God will step back in their rightful position again over all nature. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this in a number of places. I'll just take it from the unfailing realities of the living God. This is in paragraph 112. But man was put here with dominion over the earth. He had everything under his control. That's Adam in the beginning. He says what Adam lost, Jesus proved that he had restored. &gt;&gt; He stopped nature. He raised the dead. He did everything. &gt;&gt; He says it that what Adam lost in the fall, Jesus is proving that it's being restored back to mankind. &gt;&gt; In other words, this is a a man who's doing things that humanity was originally supposed to do. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, by walking ON WATER, BY MULTIPLYING BREAD AND FISH, BY RAISING THE DEAD, BY UNSTOPPPING DEAF EARS, BY LOOSENING MUTE TONGUES, BY OPENING THE EYES OF THE BLIND, BY HEALING THE CRIPPLED, BY LAYING HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEIR RECOVERING, HE WAS SHOWING WHAT HUMANITY IS CALLED TO DO. &gt;&gt; Told you to be very, very straightforward. And we may set records tonight. I'm giving you a new challenge. I might I might give brother Ellie Ezer a new benchmark to beat until you guys start pulling on me and I get all long-winded again. I remember one of the first times I ever preached. The pastor said, it was brother John La Fontaine. He told this church, "Bring a pillow. Brother Aaron's longwinded." I said, "I've only preached one time." And so I just told the church, I said, "Well, the bishop must be blameless. So you better I guarantee you one thing. I'm going to be long tonight. Wouldn't want to make your pastor a liar. Matthew 28 18 to20. Notice what he says. Because Jesus proved it's not he's when he does these supernatural miracles, he's not proving that God can raise the dead. God had done that, &gt;&gt; right? He He's not proving that God's a creator or a multiplier. That doesn't necessarily need to be proved. But he's proving that what man lost he could be restored back too. &gt;&gt; In Matthew chap 28 18 to20 it says and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. &gt;&gt; Go ye therefore and teach all nations. This is preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. In the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. When they obeyed this they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. teach them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I'm with you always even unto the end of the world. Amen. Jesus now is commissioning the disciples to observe to teach others to observe what he's commanded. So as the father hath sent the son he said so I send you [snorts] &gt;&gt; and as the father was in me I will be in you and you in me. So now there's this continuation of this ministry of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And if we took the time just as we did with the works of Jesus Christ, we could look into the book of Acts and we see that the disciples performed the same miracles of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The crippled were he were healed. The dead were raised. Demons were cast out. They defied nature. They performed many wonders. The Bible says there's many instances of the power of God working and moving in the disciples lives in the book of Acts doing these supernatural things. And in Acts 4:13 it says, "Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, the lame were healed and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus." there's some symmetry to what they're saying and what they're doing and their boldness and the way that they're conducting themselves and they're they're not born of a virgin. &gt;&gt; But yeah, now the same works that Christ did, they're doing &gt;&gt; showing that WHAT CHRIST CAME TO do is to restore and uh to restore what mankind was rightful, a rightful heir to and to bring forth a new race, new creatures in Christ Jesus. It's not Adam's race passed up, but it's a new IT'S THAT THE SEED THAT WAS TO come &gt;&gt; and now they're doing these things that they had been with Jesus. It's because now they're doing these works that Christ did. &gt;&gt; In Acts 11 26, and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people. Notice this, and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. They were called followers of Christ. As I often say, it doesn't imply that they gave themselves that name. They didn't register a don or they weren't the first to get the handle at Christians or Christians@gmail.com. They were called that by others &gt;&gt; because they were followers of Christ. &gt;&gt; They were following this great commission. All power is given to me in heaven and earth. So go and teach. And as they went out, they the the lame could walk again. The dead were raised. And it wasn't it was God in them. It was the Holy Spirit in them. It was the acts of the Holy Spirit in the apostles, but it was a portrait of humanity. In Galatians chapter 16 15, excuse me, Mark chapter 16, you're like, "Brother Aaron's writing a new Bible." Mark chapter 16 15 to 18. This is the the great commission now recorded in the book of Mark. And he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned." So here's the commission. Preach the gospel. Preach Jesus Christ. What is the gospel? It's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What is the gospel? It's power. &gt;&gt; It's life. &gt;&gt; It's living. &gt;&gt; Something that we're not ashamed of. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're to preach the gospel to every creature. &gt;&gt; He that believes and is baptized is saved. He that believeth not. If even if he's baptized, it doesn't matter because faith is the ultimate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is an outward sign that you have faith. In the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the seal of faith, not the baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says in verse 17, "And these signs shall follow them that believe in my name. They shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues." Jesus said, 'I come in my father's name and the works that he do has me to do, I do. I finished his work. I've manifested thy name. I've glorified his name. And now he's basically telling us to do the same. These signs shall follow them that believe in my name. Now again, as we are sent in his name, we cast out devils. We speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents, and they shall they shall drink any deadly thing. If they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. Yes, &gt;&gt; these are the works that Christ did. &gt;&gt; These are the very things that he did. These are the SIGNS OF THE GOSPEL and it IS IT'S GOD, BUT IT'S SIGNS OF GOD IN HUMANITY. &gt;&gt; It's a portrait. It's a painting. It's a picture. When I read that Christ did these things, I I don't want to say, "Oh, that's divine." I want to say that's what God looks like in flesh. This is what man with God all things is is possible. What all things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; SO NOW IT'S GOD IN HUMANITY. It's a painting. It's a picture. When we think of the humanity of Jesus Christ, think of him walking on water. &gt;&gt; We think about the humanity of Jesus Christ. Thinking about him multiplying bread. Think about the humanity. Think about all these different things that he did. That's the humanity of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we know God is not man that he should lie. Jesus Christ was the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; So, he may not present in the way that we might expect a man to present, but yet as a man, he's doing these things. This is what man can do. &gt;&gt; So, we read on Sunday in Galatians chapter 1, I I'll use start with verse 15. It says, "But when it pleased God who separated me from my father's, excuse me, my mother's womb and called me by his grace." So this is according to the will of God, he's done this, pleased the father as it so it seemed good in thy sight. So this is the will of God to elect him, to ordain him. And he says, "From my birth, I had this calling in my life &gt;&gt; and it pleased God verse 16 to reveal his son in me. Christ was not revealed to Paul. He says, "Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? He saw the light. He heard the voice." There's a lot of ways that there was this visible manifestation. But revelation doesn't come from without. The manifestation does. The revelation came from within. Christ was revealed in Paul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't stop there. That &gt;&gt; he was revealed in me so that I for the purpose that I so because I was too that I might preach Christ among the heathen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to him was not just to take him and set him on a shelf and say, "All right, let's go find the next one." But he was commissioned &gt;&gt; just as Jesus told the disciples, I and you and you and me and told them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel and these signs will follow you. All power is given unto me. Now go teach all nations. Teach them to observe all these things that have commanded you." Paul is saying he revealed Christ in me that I might preach him among the Gentiles. So Christ was revealed in Paul for the purpose of manifesting himself. Christ through Paul. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS IN CHRIST reconciling the world to himself. Brother Brandham says all that God was he poured into Christ. All that Christ was he poured into the church. So there's still this ministry as Paul says he's committed to us this ministry of reconciliation. IT'S IN PAUL. &gt;&gt; HOW? BY THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. SO NOW PAUL IS A MAN, but he HAS THIS DIVINE CALLING IN HIS LIFE TO REVEAL JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT PREACH HIM among the heathen &gt;&gt; to be the manifestation of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Notice this. I think this is very good so that we could recognize this is how God works. God, he says God, it pleased God to reveal his son in me that I might preach him to the Gentiles. God chooses his servants &gt;&gt; that he will reveal himself in in order to preach himself to others &gt;&gt; should not stumble anybody if God chose a vessel in this day to reveal himself in that he might preach Jesus Christ to others. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God chose Paul to preach the revel revelation of Jesus Christ given to him revealed in me so that I could express him. &gt;&gt; And no matter how much Paul could be the manifestation of the gospel nor how much he could be a prophet or a messenger, it's not the external manifestation that saves anyone. It's not the external manifestation that gives a revelation. The spirit's got to do it inwardly. &gt;&gt; That's what Sunday really focused a lot on the portrait of a perfect man is revelation comes from within. spirit has to reveal what you're seeing when you see the portrait. &gt;&gt; So, this is why I was all excited to to share with you that. &gt;&gt; Musicians, you could come to your instruments, but I want to end it with this a few statements here as I just collect myself. Please come. I know I I joke so often that nobody nobody knows whether or not I'm being serious when I say please be seated or stand up or if the musicians would come. But if that's true for Paul, it's also true for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; The great commission has not been taken away from the church. And the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you, but it is Christ revealed in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. And so Christ reveals himself in us so we can be the depiction of him &gt;&gt; to others. &gt;&gt; That's why he does it. &gt;&gt; That's why when we're born again, we don't just we're gone. Wouldn't that be awesome? You know, I'd have left here at 21, right? Boom. Gone. And then maybe there's some kind of vapor that still exists so that people know, oh well, Aaron wasn't kidnapped. He got saved and so he's in heaven now. But he leaves us here because we have a work to do. &gt;&gt; The message teaches us that all that Jesus did in the days of his earthly ministry that he did not fulfill will be completed will be fulfilled by the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; So just as Christ was God in flesh and the word was made flesh, now flesh is being made word for the same purpose of fulfilling the great commission. Performing and doing this great work of Jesus Christ. As Adam was put on earth to to do a great work. Now the bride will fulfill all. And brother Bam even teaches that Christ and the bride will fulfill all that Adam and the woman didn't fulfill. He reveals himself in us so that we can be him to others. &gt;&gt; So what I'd like you to consider for a little bit, chew on the gospel of Christ, those four gospels as we read them, they describe the image of God because it tells us the story of Jesus [music] Christ. Then as God revealed himself in Paul and Paul essentially writes the New Testament, I think these other writers, we also see it in [music] in in Peter's writings in John. So it's not just limited to Paul itself, but the New Testament paints continues to paint the picture of Christ in his church. So as believers, we search the scriptures. We're searching the picture that the painters had painted. This Bible, this word is Jesus Christ. We should see Jesus Christ in every verse. &gt;&gt; So, we search the the picture as painted by the writers of the Bible. You are not, as I've said many times before in the last few weeks, you are not the painter of the portrait. &gt;&gt; We're not the writer of the scripture. &gt;&gt; And we're not to be critics of it either. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that are critics of it, but we're not called to be critics. But what we do is we read the portrait. We read the scripture so that the spirit will reveal the reality and the truth of it to us. And so what I've tried to do tonight is to take all these miraculous things that Jesus Christ did. And I'm I believe that could show by scripture that at least in some way that's how the human the man was originally called to be is a God on earth with all these different powers and all these different abilities. Man lost that through the fall. Humanity did. But now [music] Christ comes born of a woman in flesh found in the likeness of man in the fashion of man. And he starts doing all these things that Adam was called to do. &gt;&gt; So it was a portrait of humanity. all these miracles, all these supernatural instances. Yes, it's it's God telling Jesus to DO IT. IT'S GOD IN CHRIST. YES, I I'M not disavowing the deity, but these are portraits of humanity. And if that's the portrait of humanity, I really want you to think then what's the portrait of divinity? What are the acts, the attributes, and the qualities, and the characteristics in Christ that are really, really divine? God walking on water. GOD RAISING THE DEAD. GOD MULTIPLYING out the BREAD AND FISH. GOD DOING THIS. GOD DOING THAT. But that's humanity. What's really divine? What is it that really really speaks to these attributes and characteristics of God that please God so much that Christ exhibited that we are also called to? Amen. &gt;&gt; I know I know you're thinking we have a lot of time to get into it, so why don't we just get into it? But I want you to think about it. What is the portrait of divinity? What characteristics in the Messiah are the portrait [music] of divinity that he wants you to now express? &gt;&gt; I want to WALK ON WATER. WELL, THAT'S JUST HUMAN. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO MULTIPLY FISH. WELL, THAT'S JUST HUMAN. NOW, I'm not talking about man born of a woman, but the born again part. the new creature in Christ Jesus. Those are things that's that's God. That's what God can do in flesh. But what more has he called us to? What expresses the divine? Something to think about. Trust that you'll do it. Maybe God will give us the grace next Wednesday to pick this subject up. If we could stand together this evening, please don't take what I've said to mean that these [music] these attributes and characteristics aren't of God or not godly, but it's God in humanity. But these are things that were associated with mankind in the beginning. Now we realize that in the beginning Adam couldn't have healed the sick because there was no sickness. So God allows these things to transpire, these things to take place [music] so that his attributes and his characteristics can be expressed. And so just if I could even put it that way, put it this way. Okay, the miracles are the portrait of the divine, but that's only half the picture. There's another part that we play. And in all the things that we want to do, I want to do the miracles. I want to do the miracles. I want to do the miracles. I want to do the divine. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do. Let's pray. Our gracious heavenly father, tonight as we are in your presence and through this short service, I know I covered a lot, maybe went pretty quick, but I it's not it's not really being clever, Lord, but I did want to phrase it in such a way to where we take the miracles that you did through your son and we put them in the category of this is what flesh can do when the Holy Spirit is inside of them. that this is what you had called Adam to do with respect to nature and creation and that you'd called him to [music] be that originally in the beginning. So then Jesus Christ, as we're taught according to the message of the hour, was proving that what man lost, what humanity lost in the fall was being restored by Jesus Christ. So humanity restored through your blood [music] being restored through the new birth. It does those things. God working the acts of the Holy Spirit portraying these very very supernatural things. And I believe that sons and daughters of God today can lay hands on the sick and they recover. I believe Lord if it was required they could walk on water because Lord what other evidence do we need that it was humanity than when Peter himself did it without the Holy Ghost stepped out by faith and walked on water because there's things that are in [music] us that we're called to do that faith unlocks. It's who we are. It's what we're called to. And Lord, I wrestled very quite a bit in terms of how to categorize it and order it, what's divine and what's human. And Lord, I just felt to to put these things in the category of humanity because I can tie it back to Adam. But I want to know this divine portrait, too. You humbled yourself. You became obedient. [music] You can say, "Those are things man does, but it's exactly what deity did." Lord, there's a portrait of divinity that I desire in my life, too. Yes, I I want the Holy Spirit to do these these things we've talked about tonight, but Lord, the other part, the full picture, the fullness, the full stature of a perfect man. Lord, what are those attributes that need to be kindled in me and made real in me? Bless your people tonight. We do have heavy hearts amongst us. We have a lot of anxious spirits. But Lord, I believe that you can just calm us now just as you do the storm. Lord, calm our spirits. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those of us that are hungry, feed us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let our hearts not be troubled. We believe in you. &gt;&gt; You do all things well. All things are working together for good. &gt;&gt; Lord, we even believe that the lost will be saved. That those who have wandered far can be found. &gt;&gt; We will not fret. We will not despair even in the midst of a stormy gale. Anchor the anchor holds Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I can do as a human filled with the Holy Spirit. I can walk on water. I can trust in the midst of a storm. Lord, bless your people tonight and commit them to you. And I pray that you just take control of even the worship, Father, as we're soon dismissed. go with us. I pray in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
