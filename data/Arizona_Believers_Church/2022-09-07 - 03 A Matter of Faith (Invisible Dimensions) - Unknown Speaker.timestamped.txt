[0:00] but our title
[0:01] is a matter of faith and our subtitle is
[0:04] invisible dimensions and i really just
[0:06] want to take this opportunity
[0:08] tonight to visit uh some of the ways
[0:10] that brother branham lays out these
[0:12] dimensions and then just get us to
[0:14] consider just how much faith uh relates
[0:17] to that and even how some of these
[0:19] dimensions are contacted through certain
[0:20] means and that's the same way that our
[0:22] faith is working so this series we know
[0:25] is kind of working together with what
[0:27] we've been teaching on divine healing
[0:29] it's been on sunday mornings
[0:31] and i
[0:32] would like to maybe pick up some other
[0:34] things that we discussed on augmented
[0:36] reality but i just i don't want to
[0:38] belabor it too much but we've been using
[0:41] the principle that faith is a greater
[0:42] way of seeing the world it's a different
[0:44] way of interacting in the world
[0:46] so we're in this world with natural
[0:48] abilities but yet faith is a
[0:50] supernatural ability to conduct
[0:53] ourselves within the same natural world
[0:56] and using that sense of augmented
[0:57] reality we
[0:59] and how with augmented reality
[1:01] technology imposes another layer of
[1:03] information over what you're seeing or
[1:05] experiencing and faith enhances our real
[1:08] world experience by adding a layer of
[1:10] information from divine sources
[1:13] and that's a beautiful way to live with
[1:15] augmented reality and there's a lot of
[1:17] different types and examples and
[1:19] different ones have shared with me
[1:21] tools that they utilize within their
[1:23] practice or their line of work that kind
[1:26] of augment their reality to help them do
[1:28] certain things that they otherwise
[1:29] wouldn't be able to do
[1:31] with their five senses and i think
[1:32] that's that's what the sixth sense faith
[1:35] is to do
[1:36] now if we'll just look back at the
[1:38] scriptures we read as it says in
[1:40] ephesians chapter 3 verse 17
[1:43] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:45] faith so this must be an indwelling by
[1:48] faith the dwelling by the new birth that
[1:50] ye being rooted and grounded in love so
[1:52] there's a foundation there's a basis
[1:55] and this is his prayer this is what he's
[1:56] praying that ye may be able to
[1:58] comprehend with all saints this is the
[2:01] comprehension this is the grasping this
[2:03] is an understanding
[2:05] what is the breadth and that word speaks
[2:07] of the extent of something just how
[2:09] large it is and then he describes and
[2:11] length and depth and height and could it
[2:14] could appear to be describing four
[2:16] dimensions but this word breadth there
[2:18] is just just how vast it actually is so
[2:20] maybe it speaks to context
[2:22] and length and depth and height and to
[2:24] know the love of christ and so i think
[2:27] the phrase in here is beautiful he wants
[2:29] us to know the love of christ which
[2:32] passeth knowledge
[2:34] so it's even a paradox and what he wants
[2:35] he wants us to know something that
[2:37] really can't be known he wants us to
[2:38] know the love of christ which passeth
[2:40] knowledge that ye might be filled with
[2:42] all the fullness of god and so this must
[2:45] be something beyond human intellect
[2:47] beyond human understanding and a
[2:49] fullness
[2:50] that relates to the strengthening of the
[2:52] inner man and christ dwelling in our
[2:55] hearts by faith
[2:57] now in verse 18 i want to i
[2:59] provided a slide just to highlight these
[3:01] words the length depth and height
[3:03] in verse 18. and we touched on this in
[3:06] the first part i think we've alluded to
[3:07] some of these things in the second part
[3:09] and so tonight we're just repeating
[3:10] ourselves and adding more to it in a way
[3:13] just to make this part of the record and
[3:16] there's things that i i desire to things
[3:18] that come up in inspiration and you want
[3:20] to preach and go oh well i've preached
[3:21] that already or man i really preached i
[3:23] did a whole series on this a few years
[3:25] ago and in my carnal mind these things
[3:27] being very uh
[3:29] things that are very well known or that
[3:31] we understand and i know different ones
[3:34] who know these things we fellowship on
[3:35] these things know people who've been
[3:36] faithfully taught these things and you
[3:38] kind of want to just maybe not revisit
[3:40] it but then you realize there's a whole
[3:41] generation of young people who may have
[3:43] never heard it
[3:44] and it doesn't take but just a few years
[3:46] before there's a young people who are
[3:48] listening and understanding
[3:50] who need the principles of the word of
[3:52] god taught to them
[3:53] and so i would ask if there's at any
[3:55] point any man of god that stands behind
[3:57] this desk we believe we have confidence
[3:59] in the holy spirit
[4:01] and so if they're ministering something
[4:03] and speaking on something like wow
[4:04] that's you know that's really simple god
[4:06] sent a prophet or wow we already know uh
[4:08] that of this part and that part realize
[4:11] there's those who all there's always
[4:13] someone who needs that
[4:14] and there's things to be taught and
[4:16] brought to our remembrance
[4:18] and
[4:19] i think even sometimes things are
[4:20] preached just to challenge us in our
[4:22] response and so we let's always have
[4:24] confidence that god is dealing with our
[4:26] hearts
[4:27] and so this length depth and height
[4:29] describe the three dimensions that all
[4:31] physical things exist within as you see
[4:33] here in verse 18 the length the depth
[4:36] and the height we can pull that slide up
[4:39] and and just hold it there as we
[4:41] consider paul describing this
[4:43] and
[4:44] we may have used this term a few weeks
[4:46] ago on spatial dimension that what paul
[4:48] is doing he's actually describing things
[4:50] in a scientific way or in a way that you
[4:53] might have heard in your physics class
[4:55] where length depth and height describe
[4:58] space
[4:59] and they would define from any any point
[5:03] any particular point a physical point
[5:05] there are three directions that we can
[5:07] move within and that's called space you
[5:09] move within space and it's up down left
[5:11] right forward backward and you say well
[5:13] that sounds like more that's just one
[5:15] direction up down left right and forward
[5:18] backward and movement in any direction
[5:20] can be defined or described expressed in
[5:23] these terms and so paul's saying the
[5:25] length and the depth and the height he's
[5:27] describing our three-dimensional
[5:29] existence
[5:30] and things that would exist within space
[5:33] and it is our five senses that give us
[5:35] the ability to perceive
[5:38] or give us this existence within this
[5:40] space and we could highlight different
[5:42] senses we could actually type show this
[5:44] in slides just to emphasize this but
[5:46] tonight we'll just make reference to the
[5:47] fact that we have these five physical
[5:49] senses that are helping us and make our
[5:52] way through this spatial dimension this
[5:54] three-dimensional space
[5:56] and then time is another element that's
[5:58] added to length and depth and height
[6:00] that's another element that is called in
[6:02] some ways called the fourth dimension
[6:04] uh and it's uh we added to the
[6:06] dimensions of length depth and height
[6:08] are added to those three dimensions of
[6:10] space so it kind of creates a four
[6:12] dimensional existence and time dimension
[6:14] which is very i think it's very awesome
[6:17] scientifically they call it the temporal
[6:18] dimension and it uh and it only moves in
[6:22] one direction
[6:23] and it doesn't exist just at any one
[6:25] singular point but it only exists uh at
[6:28] it exist in this continuum only moving
[6:30] one direction and so scientifically
[6:33] right now they have not been able to
[6:34] prove that you could time travel
[6:36] so that whenever something whenever an
[6:38] object moves and it moves through space
[6:40] it also moves through time
[6:43] so as i as i move i can't i'm moving
[6:45] within time so time is just moving on in
[6:47] one dimension or one continuum and then
[6:50] i can move in all these different ways
[6:51] it kind of creates this four-dimensional
[6:53] model of the time that we live in
[6:56] and one thing that i find interesting
[6:58] from a scientific perspective
[7:00] is that they say that an object uh moves
[7:03] through space and as it moves through
[7:04] space it moves through time
[7:06] and that they call that as it moves
[7:09] through time
[7:10] that's when you perceive changes
[7:12] so they say that time
[7:14] they kind of summarize it this way that
[7:16] time appears to be the force that
[7:18] changes the way things are
[7:20] that time through time is the is the one
[7:22] thing that that that demonstrates uh
[7:25] something to change
[7:26] and and i i was really pulled i was
[7:29] wanting to maybe personally spend a lot
[7:30] more time on this particular aspect but
[7:32] these are very scientific terms
[7:34] and they refer to this time that we're
[7:35] living in science refers to these
[7:37] dimensions as space time
[7:40] and it's a space time is a mathematical
[7:42] model which combines these three
[7:43] dimensions of space the length depth and
[7:45] height and then also time which i think
[7:48] we all understand time so everyone here
[7:49] understand what space is
[7:51] it's what we're in right now what time
[7:53] is it's what you're wanting to go by
[7:54] very quickly maybe for the service to be
[7:56] over
[7:57] and and that's that becomes the four
[8:00] dimensional time the one dimension of
[8:01] time in the three dimensions of of
[8:04] height width and depth or however else
[8:05] you want to describe it scripturally
[8:07] here it's length depth and height
[8:08] that is the essence that forms the space
[8:12] and the dimensions that humans exist
[8:14] within
[8:15] and it's really these things that the
[8:17] human sensory perception is is grasping
[8:19] or catching there's even the sensory
[8:22] perception of time which is part of this
[8:25] which can be a very unique sense but
[8:27] this is how we we get the sense that
[8:29] time is passed we understand movement
[8:30] and travel within this space and so
[8:32] space time describes what science can
[8:35] prove to be our dimensions of existence
[8:38] and then brother branham they call it
[8:40] space time but then brother branham uses
[8:42] a language that describes time space and
[8:45] he says in one place this is just a
[8:46] phrase i grabbed while it's daytime
[8:48] while it's earth and while we are in
[8:50] time space
[8:52] this is brother branham describing it
[8:53] while it's daytime or why it's why we're
[8:55] on earth and while we're in time space
[8:57] he's referring to existence now we're
[9:00] all breathing and we're existing on the
[9:02] earth in time space this time space
[9:05] forms human existence
[9:08] and so that's i i wanted to establish
[9:11] that principle
[9:12] um at the outset
[9:14] now in revelations chapter 2 verse 24
[9:17] and i'm wanting to
[9:19] use just a phrase from this is but i say
[9:21] unto you and under the rest of thy torah
[9:23] as many as have not this doctrine and
[9:25] which have not known the depths of satan
[9:27] as they speak i will put upon you none
[9:30] other burden so this is a compliment
[9:32] that there are those who have not held
[9:33] to this wrong doctrine nor known the
[9:35] depths of satan
[9:36] now when he refers when this scripture
[9:39] refers to the depths of satan
[9:41] it implies
[9:43] something that they had not known that
[9:44] maybe others do know or are experiencing
[9:48] but it implies a dimension that's not
[9:50] evident to the five senses alone
[9:52] that just by looking at something you
[9:54] wouldn't think oh that i'm staring into
[9:56] the depths of satan or there's a
[9:58] wormhole into this other dimension uh
[10:01] but so it's referring to a knowledge or
[10:02] experience that maybe is not just uh
[10:06] contacted or understood as paul talks
[10:08] about knowing
[10:10] and and these different things it's not
[10:12] just something on the surface but it's
[10:14] something that has depth the depth of
[10:16] satan
[10:18] and here's two scriptures just to
[10:21] start adding layers to our existence in
[10:24] proverbs chapter 16 verse 2 all the ways
[10:26] of man are clean in his own eyes but the
[10:28] lord wayth the spirits
[10:31] so what our senses perceive are not
[10:33] always
[10:34] the the full reality of things that man
[10:38] looks at something and says oh my ways
[10:40] are clean but then there are spirits
[10:42] that attach to it but that means behind
[10:44] everything there's a spirit motive and
[10:45] objective
[10:46] and that may not be evident on the
[10:48] surface so there's something beneath the
[10:50] surface or below the surface
[10:52] and man's only looking on the exterior
[10:55] but there's something else that god
[10:57] takes into consideration remember the
[10:59] primary example we used in revelations
[11:01] chapter three that were rich were
[11:02] increased with goods and have need of
[11:04] nothing and that was a vantage point of
[11:06] humanity but god had another vantage
[11:09] point that changed their entire
[11:10] condition
[11:11] and proverbs 14 verse 12 there is a way
[11:14] that seemeth right unto a man but the
[11:17] end thereof are the ways of death if it
[11:20] seems right to a man he probably doesn't
[11:22] think it's going to end in his death so
[11:24] this seemeth right it means on the
[11:26] surface it seems correct or level or
[11:28] straightforward it seems i i'm
[11:30] perceiving there's something there on
[11:32] the surface yeah this looks fine yeah i
[11:35] i can do this but it says that that it
[11:38] is there's a way which seemeth right
[11:40] into a man but then thereof are the ways
[11:43] of death
[11:44] and so it may seem to be one way
[11:46] but there's many different ways that it
[11:48] may lead you to death and so these are
[11:50] things that are not obvious on its face
[11:53] that the bible is speaking to a couple
[11:54] other verses that touch on this proverbs
[11:56] chapter 7 verse 27
[11:58] speaking of this adulterous woman her
[12:00] house is the way to hell
[12:02] going down to the chambers of death
[12:05] and so her house is a way to hell and it
[12:08] says going down to the chambers of death
[12:11] so it's describing the chambers of death
[12:13] as a downward descent it's describing a
[12:16] way and it's a way that may not you're
[12:17] not going to look at her house and
[12:18] there's there's actually stairways down
[12:20] to a basement called hell it's nothing
[12:23] literal but it's implying something at
[12:25] least an allegory or symbolic language
[12:27] that there's a way to help going down
[12:30] proverbs 15 verse 24 the way of life is
[12:33] above to the wise that he may depart
[12:36] from hell beneath
[12:38] so notice what these scriptures are
[12:40] creating they're creating these
[12:42] different levels
[12:44] are other ways of viewing things that we
[12:46] might we might try to categorize or
[12:48] chart out because we're maybe as human
[12:50] beings the way that we understand things
[12:52] is within this height depth and length
[12:54] and we understand height and width and
[12:56] depth and we understand time so we do we
[12:58] want to understand something we try to
[13:00] put it within our dimension
[13:02] and look at it within that framework of
[13:04] time and
[13:05] length and depth and space the same
[13:08] thing when it comes to
[13:10] if i told you that the lord the lord was
[13:12] coming tonight you would start thinking
[13:14] about time what time
[13:16] and then the fact that he's coming you'd
[13:18] think of some poor point of departure
[13:20] and that he has to travel some distance
[13:22] to come because that's just the way if i
[13:25] told you i was coming to your house
[13:26] tonight then you would know that that
[13:28] would take time and i would have to
[13:29] travel distance to do it
[13:31] and so that's just immediately how our
[13:33] minds think but realize god's not bound
[13:35] by those things
[13:36] those things do not
[13:38] limit nor do they fully uh help us to
[13:41] understand what it would mean for the
[13:42] lord to appear to make himself known or
[13:44] to come
[13:45] and so the bible
[13:47] and there's so many different scriptures
[13:48] we could have used i think these are
[13:49] just the most obvious that i think we'd
[13:51] be familiar with to start to realize
[13:53] that there's things that the way of life
[13:55] is above
[13:56] to the wise it's something higher the
[13:57] way of life to the wives is a higher way
[14:00] it's something they they catch or they
[14:01] ascend up into and in doing so they're
[14:04] departing from something that's beneath
[14:07] so a person exists here and the way of
[14:10] life is above to the wise but then the
[14:12] way of hell is from beneath the way to
[14:14] hell is beneath
[14:16] now this is something that that when a
[14:19] statement i'm making i think it's very
[14:20] scientifically sound
[14:22] and yet
[14:23] and though it may need to be proven to
[14:25] some scientist
[14:26] but humans lack the biological ability
[14:29] to perceive higher than three spatial
[14:31] dimensions
[14:33] our human perception is limited to the
[14:36] three-dimensional space
[14:38] and and that's that's our biological
[14:40] limitation
[14:42] now what science is theorizing about and
[14:44] a lot of what comes forth from this
[14:46] fourth dimension of time
[14:48] uh which we could think einstein and
[14:50] that particular time in generation uh
[14:52] for these advancements which that the
[14:54] whole thought on how what science is
[14:55] tapping into brother branham's come
[14:57] along and show it in a spiritual way
[14:59] they're taking things that only exist in
[15:00] a three-dimensional level
[15:02] and they're and they're surmising that
[15:05] well just because we can't perceive it
[15:07] on a biological level maybe there's some
[15:09] way that we can tap into what it really
[15:12] is through some other means
[15:14] and they would argue this by saying that
[15:17] just look had we only limited ourselves
[15:19] to our five senses to what we can
[15:21] biologically perceive with our five
[15:22] senses we would never been able to
[15:24] discover discover an atom
[15:28] which
[15:28] and these things that exist on a
[15:30] molecular level and they exist within
[15:32] space they exist within these three
[15:34] dimensions but it's just so minuscule
[15:35] you need something else
[15:37] you need to harness the energy of
[15:38] something else to magnify that in order
[15:40] to see it and they say so there's things
[15:42] that may not be biologically we can
[15:44] perceive biologically but maybe there's
[15:46] things that are out there that exist in
[15:49] other dimensions that we don't know
[15:50] about
[15:51] and i'm like you think
[15:54] and they say that about dark matter and
[15:56] just how vast the universe is had they
[15:58] had they just relied only on what they
[16:00] could perceive now with their senses
[16:01] they never would have come to understand
[16:04] these other dimensions
[16:06] now i want to go to these slides brother
[16:08] chris if you could just put the first
[16:09] slide up
[16:10] and
[16:11] and i'm just looking at this i apologize
[16:13] if this was hastily put together
[16:15] and so some of our graphic artists and
[16:17] our more
[16:19] uh skilled
[16:20] uh computer people maybe they could
[16:23] start elevating my uh slide game
[16:26] but so i apologize if this is not really
[16:28] uh done well i may try to tilt it just a
[16:30] little bit can you all still see over
[16:32] there
[16:33] uh so brother branham described our
[16:36] realms of existence in different ways
[16:37] and one way he described it as seven
[16:39] dimensions another way he just described
[16:40] it in a trinity above and a trinity
[16:42] below and i'm just going to look at what
[16:44] my slide so yeah the next slide
[16:46] um has that brother branham refers to
[16:49] and in the message the countdown he
[16:50] actually gets into these dimensions so
[16:51] if you've been following up and some of
[16:53] the services have been preached here
[16:54] maybe you've already listened to some of
[16:55] these services that describe this but
[16:57] the realm of mortals are these first
[16:59] three dimensions
[17:01] and they're the dimensions that we exist
[17:02] within right now we exist within light
[17:05] matter and time and we'll we come into
[17:07] some scriptures in a moment to kind of
[17:09] click these things together it's very
[17:10] beautiful but we exist within light
[17:12] modern time that's just uh these are the
[17:14] words that brother branham used uh
[17:16] science uses a similar vernacular when
[17:19] describing kind of what we exist within
[17:21] uh and the concepts of time
[17:23] and even how they're trying to use light
[17:25] uh e equals m c squared relates to a
[17:27] light
[17:28] creating matter
[17:30] and so that we exist within light matter
[17:32] and time but then there's a fourth
[17:33] dimension which we have here which is
[17:35] called science
[17:37] and that's uh the a realm that we don't
[17:39] we can't taste it
[17:41] right we can't really feel it but you
[17:43] can utilize
[17:44] technology to transmit waves unseen
[17:48] waves in that realm and then also
[17:50] receive it and replicate pictures that's
[17:52] what television and radio and the
[17:54] internet and all sorts of wireless
[17:56] technology right now i'm using a
[17:57] wireless mic it's not it's not wired and
[18:01] so it's taking my voice and it's
[18:03] transmitting it to a receiver it's
[18:05] transmitting from here to a receiver
[18:07] that's all taking place in another
[18:08] dimension
[18:10] now that science is pretty awesome
[18:12] right and i still can't get my head
[18:15] around a a record a vinyl disc
[18:18] i mean i i can't understand that let
[18:20] alone some of this other stuff that
[18:21] takes place how they can put grooves
[18:24] in a vinyl disc and then use a needle
[18:26] and it's gonna and record
[18:29] sound and then you could play it back
[18:31] by running a needle over those grooves
[18:33] don't we all agree that that's like
[18:35] witchcraft or something
[18:37] it's sorcery on a science i guess but
[18:39] that's what this realm is it's a
[18:41] scientific realm in a realm that we
[18:43] cannot see feel taste or imagine but
[18:47] it's real it's here
[18:48] and maybe help us understand that again
[18:51] it's like for there's things that
[18:53] when um
[18:54] when the piano was played that's it's
[18:57] sending out sound waves
[18:59] and you hear that and what are you doing
[19:01] you're picking up an invisible wave
[19:04] and that's what creates
[19:06] our our sensory perception of hearing
[19:09] there's some people that can taste
[19:12] chords
[19:13] you ever heard that before
[19:14] go to a piano right now and you can give
[19:16] them a certain chord and they'll tell
[19:17] you by taste what it is
[19:20] and again i don't know if that's
[19:22] sorcery or what it is but
[19:24] uh my brother told me one time that he
[19:26] heard a white van drive by so i guess
[19:28] there's ways that you can actually
[19:30] hear colors
[19:32] and so they
[19:34] just to see how that there's things that
[19:37] our senses pick up on taste is one
[19:39] dimension in a sense one channel
[19:41] hearing's another channel eyesight's
[19:43] another channel feeling is another
[19:44] channel and these are all things that
[19:46] the senses are declaring these things so
[19:48] we have by virtue of science and trust
[19:50] can you see that you can see it here i
[19:52] don't know if my hand motions are adding
[19:54] any greater clarity to anybody who can't
[19:56] see it but then with science this is
[19:58] this again it involves the realm that
[20:01] we're living within and this is usually
[20:02] something that brother brahm teaches we
[20:04] have these four dimensions then he takes
[20:06] us to a fifth dimension he calls it hell
[20:09] and in that dimension would be the souls
[20:11] of the unjust
[20:12] and the wicked and those that are damned
[20:14] they exist within that dimension along
[20:15] with demons and demonic spirits
[20:18] and when when the bible's saying that
[20:20] there's things from beneath you you
[20:22] could even picture hell as being
[20:23] something that's debased it's lower
[20:26] and that it has an influence there's
[20:27] demonic influences and sure hell wants
[20:31] to influence
[20:32] the fourth dimension and these
[20:34] dimensions of time matter and light like
[20:36] it's a becomes a dimension of influence
[20:38] demonic influence the souls of the
[20:40] unjust you can even say that if there's
[20:42] ghosts
[20:44] right
[20:45] brother ram describes in one place how
[20:47] there was this uh this this image of it
[20:49] he was even in tucson where does that
[20:51] come from where does that apparition
[20:53] come from it's something that's bleeding
[20:54] through from a dimension and then he
[20:57] describes the sixth dimension as a place
[20:58] we call it paradise here is a place of
[21:00] theophanies where um there's theophanies
[21:03] there's the angels it's another
[21:04] dimension in christ
[21:06] uh where it's uh it's something from
[21:08] it's above it's more heavenly
[21:10] and then in the seventh dimension which
[21:12] is just using this uh using this pyramid
[21:14] just as a way of categorizing it which
[21:16] is a symbol that's very familiar to us
[21:18] and in the seventh dimension
[21:20] we have god
[21:23] god existing in this seventh dimension
[21:25] all by himself it's a god dimension it's
[21:27] a god realm
[21:28] now that would be when that's how
[21:30] brother branham describes these seven
[21:32] dimensions
[21:34] of
[21:35] these just calls them seven dimensions
[21:36] then in another place he describes this
[21:39] realm of it's a trinity above and a
[21:42] trinity below
[21:46] there we are
[21:47] and
[21:48] this is and i used the same image just
[21:50] to describe it or just to present it
[21:52] visually i call it this zero zero level
[21:55] here is life
[21:57] it's where we all exist right now that's
[21:58] light matter and time it's the realm of
[22:01] mortals it's his channel of life and and
[22:04] it's what we exist in with right now
[22:05] brother brahman even described it as a
[22:07] massive darkness and every once in a
[22:09] while you see lights that's this
[22:11] existence it's us right now we're all
[22:13] living within this realm of life
[22:15] light time matter it's that realm that
[22:18] one dimension we described in those
[22:20] first three before
[22:22] and then he describes descending a
[22:24] trinity from below and then ascending a
[22:27] trinity from above
[22:28] and so in life beneath us there's the
[22:30] realm of the unjust the souls of the dam
[22:33] the wicked the place of waiting uh when
[22:35] they pass away they go into this place
[22:37] of holding a place of torment and then
[22:40] in another dimension brother m described
[22:42] lower than that is the realm of demons
[22:44] and then he describes the devil himself
[22:46] or even hell in this other dimension
[22:48] because it's a trinity from below so
[22:49] this is the beneath that the scriptures
[22:51] talk about
[22:53] and then from above you have the holy
[22:55] ghost is in another realm above us and
[22:58] then the angels and then god that would
[23:01] be the trinity above that's just way a
[23:03] way that brother branham and we could
[23:04] get very very legalistic and very rigid
[23:06] about this and try to make it some sort
[23:08] of template to understand everything but
[23:10] it's brother branham using two different
[23:12] ways to get us to understand that what
[23:14] we perceive with our five senses here
[23:17] isn't just isn't all that's out there
[23:21] that there's more to things there's
[23:22] things from beneath and there's things
[23:24] above
[23:25] and you'll find that when people reject
[23:28] god they usually reject the devil at the
[23:30] same time
[23:31] i always find i think i've mentioned it
[23:33] before one of the most the funniest
[23:34] tweets i've ever seen was somebody said
[23:37] something about you know the satanist
[23:38] the church of satan that they literally
[23:41] believe in hell or believe in a devil
[23:43] and the reply from the church of satan
[23:45] was no actually it's christians who
[23:47] believe
[23:48] in a literal devil and it's like that's
[23:50] right i forgot yeah we're the ones that
[23:52] believe in a literal devil but if you
[23:54] begin to reject
[23:55] the unseen right that's what the the
[23:57] phallus one of the biggest errors in
[23:59] communism is if it does there's nothing
[24:01] that exists beyond what is seen and what
[24:03] is tangible the god of communism is
[24:06] science
[24:07] and so this is just a way of
[24:08] understanding there's more than meets
[24:10] the eye
[24:12] in john chapter 8 verse 23 jesus now
[24:15] touches on this he sayeth unto them year
[24:17] from beneath i am from above ye are of
[24:19] this world i am not of this world
[24:22] i think we use this in this series
[24:24] already
[24:26] but jesus is pointing out pointing to
[24:28] these dimensions
[24:32] i am
[24:33] from above
[24:35] if i've come i've come from above
[24:38] you are from beneath
[24:40] and what what is demonstrative in this
[24:43] is christ is influenced from above and
[24:45] everyone on earth is being influenced
[24:47] from below
[24:48] heaven is pressing in hell is pressing
[24:50] in and one of the first i can still
[24:52] remember
[24:52] one of the first times i ever preached
[24:54] on this is how this becomes this realm
[24:56] of pressure
[24:57] and brother lucas i even think you you
[24:59] did uh
[25:00] something in html for me that would
[25:03] showed all these things moving all these
[25:05] things i'd created he kind of added some
[25:07] movement to it i mean it's 20 years old
[25:09] now
[25:10] and works in flex or something
[25:13] but it uh
[25:14] it demonstrated it demonstrated how
[25:16] these things are pressing in making this
[25:18] a realm of pressure this channel of life
[25:20] that we're living in christ is from
[25:22] above he says you're from beneath and
[25:24] what he's laying out is dimensions of
[25:26] origin and dimensions of existence
[25:29] here he is in the realm of mortals but
[25:31] he said i'm from above and there here
[25:33] they are they're also in the realm of
[25:34] morals be saying you're from beneath and
[25:36] brother branham said he lived in a world
[25:38] this is christ he lived in a world to
[25:40] himself
[25:41] and it's this phrase i want us to pick
[25:42] up on he was born outside the realm
[25:46] of the natural man amen he's born
[25:48] outside the realm of the natural sinful
[25:51] man
[25:52] and just by saying that i
[25:55] i want all of us to now just look right
[25:57] back to the beginning
[25:58] to understand how that these people that
[26:01] christ is talking to
[26:03] were born by a woman
[26:05] they're born through this through this
[26:07] this act and christ bypasses that so
[26:10] when he's born he's born outside the
[26:12] realm of a natural man though he's in
[26:15] that in this world he has sensory
[26:18] perception beyond it
[26:21] and so he's born outside the realm of
[26:23] man and by he's when he says you're from
[26:25] beneath i am from above and brother
[26:27] branham says he's born outside his birth
[26:30] his conception and birth departs from
[26:33] the way that all other men and women are
[26:36] procreated
[26:38] and now i know that we have as a church
[26:40] spent a lot of time in the book of
[26:42] genesis
[26:43] and so i i i'm very i feel very uh i'm
[26:48] personally reluctant to get into great
[26:49] deal detail on this but knowing on a
[26:52] wednesday night you're speaking to
[26:54] very mature believers who've heard a lot
[26:55] of good teaching
[26:57] from whatever their backgrounds were i
[26:59] know that you understand these things so
[27:01] in genesis chapter 2 verse 25 it
[27:03] describes
[27:05] kind of describes all of creation after
[27:06] god has created man in a spirit being
[27:08] then he's gonna place him within flesh
[27:10] and he defies divides them and now it's
[27:12] man and a woman there in the garden of
[27:15] eden to paradise the place of god's
[27:16] delight the bible says they were both
[27:18] naked the man and his wife and were not
[27:21] ashamed
[27:22] and we realized that this existence was
[27:24] one of perfection
[27:26] and so man is existing
[27:29] brother chris if it's possible just
[27:31] zip back to that first slide that we had
[27:34] on that with that uh pyramid
[27:36] mankind is now in the beginning god
[27:39] created uh god created the heavens and
[27:41] the earth and the first act of creation
[27:43] we have is god said let there be light
[27:46] and there was light and then he brings
[27:48] forth matter so man is existing within
[27:51] light and matter
[27:53] and in all of creation is
[27:57] uh
[27:58] in harmony it's all unified all the
[28:00] different kingdoms are subject to one
[28:02] another and offered an imperfect
[28:04] functionality and so this is where
[28:07] mankind
[28:08] is described into chapter two
[28:11] and it's a perfect existence and the way
[28:13] that i have been thinking about over the
[28:15] last few weeks is this this may be one
[28:18] of the best ways to describe
[28:21] a life of faith
[28:23] because adam didn't have history
[28:27] he didn't have science he didn't have
[28:29] experience
[28:30] he just had a relationship with god
[28:32] and a knowledge of the divine and there
[28:34] was no fear because this was a life of
[28:36] faith there was no fear what's the first
[28:38] thing that begins to creep in after sin
[28:40] it's fear
[28:41] and so they were they were in this realm
[28:44] where they fellowshipped with
[28:46] the things of god and had relationship
[28:49] with an eternal invisible god amen
[28:54] they're in the realms of light and
[28:56] matter and they're having fellowship
[28:58] with a god
[28:59] who
[29:00] not isn't not necessarily seen
[29:05] is not necessarily felt
[29:07] but it's a god who we know made himself
[29:09] known by his voice because they heard
[29:11] the voice of the god walking in the
[29:13] garden speaking and so their existence
[29:16] then may not be unlike what we're trying
[29:18] to achieve now is to have a relationship
[29:21] with an invisible god because we have
[29:23] perfect harmony with one who cannot be
[29:25] comprehended or understood
[29:28] and so that's their existence
[29:31] and we can say that in the beginning god
[29:33] this is this realm of faith this god
[29:35] kingdom this god-existence that mankind
[29:38] in matter and light and matter is
[29:40] existing with this an eternal realm and
[29:43] then once sin comes it's after the
[29:45] beginning
[29:46] jesus refers to from the beginning it
[29:48] was not so there's this part of the
[29:50] beginning which was eternal
[29:53] and i know this is
[29:54] uh
[29:55] it's a very it's uh
[29:57] it's very unique uh
[30:00] way that god overlaps these things
[30:04] and so after the beginning in the
[30:05] beginning
[30:06] has an eternal quality to it it's not
[30:08] until there's sin that there's going to
[30:10] be a ceasing so timing comes enters into
[30:13] it
[30:14] and it's after the beginning once
[30:15] mankind falls
[30:18] that
[30:19] it says in genesis chapter 3 verse 23
[30:21] the lord sent them forth from the garden
[30:23] of eden to till the ground from whence
[30:25] he was taken
[30:26] so what is this humanity is cast out of
[30:28] this paradise
[30:29] and when they're cast out of it they
[30:31] lose a connection to the invisible
[30:34] and it's not that the whole earth it's
[30:36] not their
[30:37] they weren't tossed off another planet
[30:38] and thrown down here
[30:40] and it's not that god just kind of dug
[30:42] up the garden of eden and shot it back
[30:44] up a shoot into back into heaven
[30:46] it was a realm it was an existence it
[30:49] was some perception and knowledge that
[30:51] was lost because these channels became
[30:53] clogged and now man is thrust into this
[30:55] existence where the only
[30:58] realm he lives in now is matter
[31:00] in light
[31:02] at that very moment
[31:04] existence is thrust into time to where
[31:07] now man lives in
[31:09] light matter and time
[31:11] god said let there be light then he
[31:13] brought forth matter and then after the
[31:15] fall now time becomes this fourth
[31:18] dimension that all that all humanity has
[31:20] to move within
[31:24] and so brother bram says you are in a
[31:26] time space
[31:28] and the only thing that's eternal is
[31:29] something that had no beginning or no
[31:31] end
[31:33] this is i think this is something that
[31:34] einstein would have enjoyed
[31:37] because it's so it's it is such a
[31:40] full description such a scientific
[31:43] technical definition you are in time
[31:46] space as einstein might have said space
[31:48] time this is what we exist in these
[31:50] three dimensions of space and this
[31:52] dimension of time that defines all human
[31:55] existence but the only thing that's
[31:56] eternal has no beginning or end so
[31:59] brother bram now is taking it in
[32:00] swallowing up now
[32:03] our existence with something beyond it
[32:05] that envelops it that has no beginning
[32:07] or end
[32:08] and this is exactly how science starts
[32:10] to try to understand these extra
[32:12] dimensions because they draw a cube and
[32:14] they say well let's move these points
[32:15] out further and they have this other
[32:17] space around that cube
[32:19] which exists now in another dimension
[32:21] and that's that's science trying to
[32:23] figure out
[32:25] what else exists
[32:27] i can't remember what's called a euclid
[32:29] cube or something that they tried
[32:31] they're looking at these other uh
[32:33] dimensions
[32:34] and
[32:36] there's also
[32:37] there's uh
[32:38] this is coming back to my mind that if
[32:40] you just drew a point
[32:42] there's that's a zero level existence
[32:45] this just one little dot nothing else
[32:48] and then and then you would take
[32:49] something that's on a surface on a piece
[32:50] of paper
[32:52] when you have a piece of paper something
[32:53] exists in this it's two dimension
[32:56] and so there's only one way that you can
[32:57] chart that out and then this is
[32:59] three-dimensional
[33:01] and science is starting to get this
[33:02] feeling that there's something more
[33:04] beyond
[33:06] these four dimensions
[33:08] and so time space as brother ben calls
[33:10] it it's only partial reality but that
[33:13] which is eternal and has no beginning or
[33:15] end is full reality
[33:18] and it's only from that that this
[33:20] reality can fully be apprehended and put
[33:22] into context because it's the eternal
[33:24] that's given birth to this spatial
[33:26] existence and given birth to this time
[33:29] and it's for purpose and for reason
[33:33] now in john chapter 8 verses 41 to 44.
[33:38] g this is um
[33:41] this is in the same passage where he
[33:42] says you're from beneath i am from above
[33:45] and i am not of this world but you are
[33:46] of this world
[33:48] and he says you do the deeds of your
[33:49] father now these jews he knew exactly
[33:52] what he was talking about then they said
[33:54] to him we be not born of fornication
[33:56] we have one father even god so where did
[33:59] they go right back to the beginning
[34:01] so he says i am from above you are from
[34:03] beneath you're of this world i am that
[34:04] of this world our minds ought to have
[34:06] gone right back to the beginning and so
[34:07] when he says you are you do the deeds of
[34:10] your father they go right back to the
[34:11] beginning with cain who was born of
[34:14] fornication who is of that wicked one
[34:15] said no we are not of that wicked when
[34:18] we are of our father even god
[34:21] so jesus said unto them if god were your
[34:23] father you would you would love me
[34:25] for i proceeded forth and came from god
[34:28] what is this a descending from above
[34:31] neither came i have myself but he sent
[34:33] me why do you not understand my speech
[34:36] even because you cannot hear my word now
[34:39] if we debate at that point
[34:42] why can't you understand my dialogue
[34:44] dialect
[34:45] my manner of speaking he says it's
[34:47] because you cannot hear my word now
[34:49] audibly just with the the power of
[34:51] hearing the sense of hearing they say i
[34:54] hear you
[34:55] you just said i did the deeds of my
[34:56] father that's why i entered answered you
[34:59] but christ is now taking what seems to
[35:02] exist only within this realm of sound
[35:05] waves and has now just done something to
[35:07] it
[35:08] pops it out to say no there's more that
[35:10] you could hear in the transmission and
[35:12] you're not getting it
[35:14] there's more to what's being said
[35:16] there's more to pick up there's more
[35:17] information available but you're not
[35:20] picking it up so he says you are of your
[35:22] father the devil
[35:23] and the lust of your father ye will do
[35:25] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[35:28] abode not in the truth because there is
[35:29] no truth in him it's going all the way
[35:31] back to where their objection we are not
[35:33] born of fornication and christ is not
[35:35] like oh okay they knew exactly what i
[35:37] was saying i thought i was being a
[35:38] little bit more subtle there know
[35:40] exactly what i'm talking about let me
[35:41] ease up no he's just going to reinforce
[35:43] it even harder he's going right back to
[35:45] cain in the beginning
[35:47] bode not in the truth because there's no
[35:48] truth in him it's speaking of the devil
[35:50] where he speaketh a lie he speaketh of
[35:52] his own for he is a liar and the father
[35:56] of it what is the light's truth
[35:58] perverted
[36:01] it's something that's real and true now
[36:02] turned upside down
[36:04] twisted turned around deformed
[36:06] and so satan is
[36:08] the cause of a perverted reality
[36:12] and
[36:13] when you come to a statement here in a
[36:15] little bit hopefully
[36:17] and
[36:18] uh
[36:19] and i realize maybe i failed to present
[36:21] this the right way
[36:22] that faith existence of the man and the
[36:24] woman the beginning that that would be a
[36:27] way for us to conceptualize the way that
[36:29] god had placed adam and the woman on
[36:31] earth
[36:32] and given them that whatever abilities
[36:34] they might have had whatever senses they
[36:36] might have had whatever powers they
[36:37] might have had it was to be governed by
[36:39] the knowledge of god through revelation
[36:41] this could be an existence of faith in
[36:43] existence of faith the life of faith and
[36:46] satan
[36:47] stepped in to destroy that
[36:50] and sold the seeds of modern religion
[36:53] he sold the seeds of civilization and
[36:55] science and education and that's what
[36:57] was sewn into mankind's existence and so
[37:01] on the other side of that once time
[37:03] enters in and the god part is stripped
[37:05] away from man's reality now he exists
[37:08] only within these four dimensions but
[37:10] eternity still exists
[37:13] and brother branham says in the message
[37:15] perfection he says now this great chain
[37:17] of perfection was broken by time space
[37:20] this sounds like this is this is like
[37:23] deep stuff
[37:25] what are you saying here this great
[37:27] chain of perfection if you just wanted
[37:29] to picture that emblem of eternity is
[37:33] broken by time space what is it it's not
[37:35] just it's not light it's not matter but
[37:38] it's when this dimension of time
[37:40] fully allows it to clunk down into its
[37:43] own thing
[37:44] he said time came because of sin
[37:47] let's draw a picture of time let's see a
[37:49] perfect circle now you have to imagine
[37:51] this in your minds
[37:52] perfect circle forever forever and then
[37:55] all at once sin dropped in
[37:58] and put a little hickey or a little drop
[38:00] in the chain so it comes down now
[38:03] eternity continues on he says but it's
[38:06] not in its perfect condition
[38:08] there's a little gap comes down
[38:11] breaks over this way goes out this way
[38:14] god had to do that because satan caused
[38:17] it
[38:19] and it dropped down to a space of time
[38:23] for the trying and the perfecting
[38:25] and for the purging of the lost that god
[38:27] by his sovereign grace might someday
[38:30] lift that little hick your gap back into
[38:32] the perfect circle
[38:34] so i didn't draw it out but if you
[38:36] imagined a circle and just a little loop
[38:38] dropping down
[38:39] that's what we're living in now but one
[38:41] day it's got to come back into
[38:42] perfection
[38:44] and that's why it's this loop here
[38:46] within this loop here that god deals
[38:47] with sin
[38:49] hell
[38:50] the devil and all his angels and then
[38:52] once we loop back into eternity that
[38:54] little hickey is gone
[38:56] whatev whatever came under that whatever
[38:57] can't loop back in that's why there is
[38:59] no eternal hell
[39:02] and so
[39:03] it says then she rolls on just the same
[39:05] talk about this eternity now time is
[39:07] this little loop that loops down
[39:10] jesus was from eternity to eternity he
[39:13] stepped into time spaces
[39:16] made flesh came through in here in order
[39:17] to sanctify her put a streak of blood
[39:19] across this place to redeem it and
[39:21] connect it back within with god again
[39:23] for all eternity that's all time is
[39:26] then when god then god when it started
[39:29] here to the end of the little kink in
[39:32] the perfect circle but made it a little
[39:34] kink in it when god started there he was
[39:36] perfect everything he said was perfect
[39:39] everything he does is perfect
[39:42] so this whole time existence we call it
[39:45] a little loop a little kink or whatever
[39:46] it might be
[39:47] that is this exhibit the human existence
[39:50] on this world and that's the only thing
[39:52] that we really know and man's trying to
[39:53] reach out beyond himself to understand
[39:56] worlds beyond
[39:57] and as science advances and they're able
[39:59] to take tremendous photos of things far
[40:01] far far away
[40:03] and years and years and years away and
[40:05] these images come back and science is
[40:07] just wrestling with these dimensions and
[40:09] these shapes and these lines and these
[40:11] things being birthed and these things
[40:12] being born and just how expansive the
[40:14] universe is
[40:16] and they
[40:16] they they realize that this is something
[40:18] beyond this world and again it's hard
[40:21] for them to grasp it why because they're
[40:24] just an anti-type of what what the word
[40:27] of god is
[40:28] what the knowledge of god is but it's
[40:30] describing things this great chain of
[40:32] perfection is broken out because of
[40:33] satan
[40:34] and it puts us in time space
[40:39] but he says god is perfect
[40:41] there's still this eternal perfect being
[40:43] that exists he hasn't ceased to exist he
[40:45] hasn't just been sucked into this loop
[40:47] but he still exists above it all
[40:50] in acts chapter 17 verses 28 and 29
[40:54] says
[40:55] speaking of god for in him
[40:57] we live and move and have our being
[41:03] for in him we live and move and have our
[41:05] being a certain also of your own poets
[41:08] have said if we are also his offspring
[41:11] for as much then as we are the offspring
[41:13] of god we ought not to think that the
[41:15] godhead is likened to gold or silver
[41:17] stone graven by art and man's devices
[41:21] i want to touch on two principles in
[41:23] this and i think this is very often
[41:25] what's visited in these verses
[41:27] but in him we live we breathe we enjoy
[41:30] life
[41:31] it means to be strong it means to pass
[41:32] our lives it's a manner of living in him
[41:35] now
[41:36] this is describing how that we ought to
[41:39] sense our
[41:40] actual existence as being in god
[41:43] not just in the dimensions of light
[41:46] matter
[41:47] in time
[41:49] but in the in the dimension of god in
[41:51] him we live and move and have our being
[41:53] that i have my existence in something
[41:55] that is beyond this
[41:58] i enjoy life in him i live i move it
[42:01] means to cause to go to be set in motion
[42:03] motion which is evident of life it
[42:05] speaks of to excite in him i live i have
[42:07] my existence but in him i'm also
[42:09] motivated that's in him i have my
[42:11] motions of life it's what excites me in
[42:13] him i have my being it's to be to be
[42:16] present to exist in him i live and have
[42:19] life and him i move and have motion in
[42:21] him i have my existence
[42:26] it's it's giving this credence too
[42:28] that
[42:29] it's giving this even if you wanted to
[42:31] look at it just in a
[42:33] a purely historical context all of
[42:36] creation must realize we're only here
[42:38] because the divine
[42:40] and he's allowed us to drop down into
[42:42] this loop and that the only reason why
[42:45] we all are in things are is because he
[42:48] has set these things in motion
[42:51] it's a rebuttal to an atheist it's a
[42:53] rebuttal to the agnostic it's a rebuttal
[42:54] to those who think that god just stands
[42:56] afar off with his arms crossed its
[42:58] rebuttal to any other way than the the
[43:01] the knowledge that god created the
[43:03] heavens and the earth and set things in
[43:05] motion to fulfill his great plan
[43:09] and so this is
[43:10] and then
[43:12] on this other way of thinking about it
[43:13] that when this when this thing is
[43:16] when this loop is comes back into
[43:18] eternity how do we fit in because we
[43:21] exist within this eternal realm
[43:25] and he says then we if we are the
[43:26] offspring of god if we've come from him
[43:28] we ought not to think of the god head
[43:30] the godhood the god person
[43:32] the existence of god like gold silver
[43:34] stone or graven by art and man's devices
[43:37] now this is a much larger thought to an
[43:39] idol worshiper
[43:41] but let me look at it in a way that we
[43:42] could put it to all that would be
[43:44] applicable to anyone that god is not a
[43:46] matter of our physical senses
[43:49] so he's not a matter
[43:51] of our physical senses nor is he a
[43:53] figment of our minds
[43:56] he is not a god that can be handled or
[43:57] conjured in that way
[44:00] and so this is paul
[44:02] again describing
[44:04] in a beautiful way the how we ought to
[44:07] be the knowledge ought to be coming into
[44:09] as sons and daughters of god and to
[44:11] recognize that god is beyond this realm
[44:13] this box this cube
[44:18] so then if this is
[44:21] with that image in mind of a faith
[44:23] existence of the man and the woman
[44:25] this little
[44:26] and maybe this at this kink and things
[44:28] drop down now we've we've fallen into
[44:30] this time element because of sin
[44:33] and and there's a ways there's ways to
[44:35] chart it out that when
[44:37] sin entered into the heart of uh
[44:39] satan in the beginning or in heaven and
[44:41] was cast down to earth so many different
[44:43] ways to look at this from different
[44:44] dimensions
[44:46] but once if we could just
[44:49] achieve this dichotomy between our
[44:50] existence now as humans
[44:52] and this existence of the eternal
[44:55] and then look at the moment where satan
[44:57] comes in
[44:58] and he's going to try to force this
[45:00] divide
[45:02] and in genesis 3 5 he says for god doth
[45:05] know
[45:06] that in the day you eat thereof this is
[45:08] him talking to the woman who exists
[45:10] within light and matter and is not
[45:12] subject to death so there is no time he
[45:14] says then your eyes shall be open and he
[45:17] shall be as gods knowing good and evil
[45:20] he proposes to her that a higher
[45:22] knowledge could be attained by something
[45:25] natural
[45:27] that that there could be this attainment
[45:30] to spiritual knowledge and it says you
[45:31] shall become as gods and knowing good
[45:33] and evil your eyes shall be open in
[45:35] other words he's insinuating there was
[45:37] something beyond the realm that she's
[45:39] existing in
[45:40] and that she's only living in a partial
[45:42] reality everything you see is not what's
[45:44] real and everything you feel is not
[45:45] what's real and there's more beyond what
[45:46] you're experiencing and he proposes to
[45:49] her another reality beyond what she was
[45:51] experiencing as a woman in god's
[45:54] perfection and he suggests and what he
[45:57] proposes is that that can be experienced
[46:00] through physical means
[46:02] now if you could if you could take this
[46:04] to your heart so lord how could i make
[46:06] this applicable
[46:07] there there are ways that people can
[46:09] work themselves into a state of euphoria
[46:13] through physical exertion and through
[46:15] hysteria and make themselves think that
[46:18] they've entered into a divine realm
[46:20] where they're experiencing the divine
[46:22] and it's no different than the practices
[46:25] of an occult or some sort of pagan
[46:26] religion where they've worked themselves
[46:28] physically into something
[46:31] and have gotten no closer to god
[46:35] and we have to we have to realize that
[46:37] there's all sorts of ways that anything
[46:39] that exists within these dimensions can
[46:40] be impersonated
[46:43] but he says
[46:45] you can attain a higher knowledge
[46:47] through a physical act
[46:49] when the only way that they could know
[46:51] more of god in more reality was by
[46:53] divine knowledge
[46:57] adam couldn't figure it out
[46:59] adam couldn't feel it out it was going
[47:01] to come by this
[47:03] this divine connection that a son had to
[47:04] his creator
[47:08] because god is not a a matter of our
[47:09] physical senses or figment of our minds
[47:11] he's a it's a he's a matter of faith
[47:15] and that's why even this thought of a
[47:16] matter of faith it needs to be i want to
[47:19] enforce this
[47:20] uh with with great effort
[47:23] that we're built on faith
[47:26] all you are and every uh all you ever
[47:27] will be as a christian is is is
[47:29] according to faith in god's word
[47:32] it's our existence as a christian is
[47:34] defined by faith
[47:36] we have no other we don't have any other
[47:38] means of conviction and and vindication
[47:42] at the end of the day it's by faith
[47:45] there's not going to be a vault that's
[47:46] unearthed
[47:48] that's going to be able to vindicate us
[47:50] and we're just we just can't wait till
[47:51] they find the historical record to do it
[47:55] it's by faith
[47:57] paul says in second corinthians 5 7 for
[47:59] we walk by faith not by sight
[48:01] we walk by a sixth sense
[48:04] that's that that senses another
[48:07] dimension
[48:09] it's not faith that tells me this
[48:11] pulpit's here
[48:12] it's not faith that's telling me you're
[48:14] here
[48:15] because those are things that the senses
[48:17] declare but we walk by faith not by
[48:19] sight it's by a sense
[48:23] of another dimension
[48:25] sensing things that are divine sensing
[48:27] things are eternal sensing things that
[48:29] are promised by god
[48:30] that we use this scripture to some
[48:33] degree on this uh on
[48:36] blind uh trust bad faith
[48:38] by faith were influenced
[48:42] guided
[48:43] and and governed controlled by an unseen
[48:46] god god that cannot be seen
[48:50] right
[48:51] it's not a god you say well i want to
[48:52] know what you guys believe we'll go see
[48:54] god
[48:55] go talk to god go talk to our our
[48:58] our sage the one who has all the wisdom
[49:00] the one that we're trusting completely
[49:01] in and to some people they have their
[49:04] sources that become their god on earth
[49:06] it's this natural inclination
[49:08] to whatever they believe to be the most
[49:10] important
[49:12] they have their gods but we
[49:14] by faith are controlled by an unseen god
[49:16] we by faith are governed and we are led
[49:18] by and we are guided influenced by an
[49:20] unseen god
[49:22] it says for we walk by faith not by
[49:24] sight that sight does not refer to the
[49:26] act of vision
[49:28] but to
[49:29] more or less the whole thing and the
[49:31] whole perception of that which is seen
[49:33] by the shape or the appearance we're we
[49:35] don't we're not guided by the way things
[49:38] appear what we perceive
[49:40] it's in that that series i think we
[49:42] mentioned how that this world is only
[49:45] only functions according to what can be
[49:47] seen
[49:48] and taste
[49:49] what they taste and feel and smell and
[49:51] hear
[49:52] science is impacted only by that which
[49:55] it can observe
[49:56] it's changed only by that which you can
[49:58] observe
[50:00] world is influenced by the scene
[50:03] the world cannot science cannot in the
[50:06] the worldly in the worldly mind it
[50:08] cannot accept a reality beyond what is
[50:10] seen touched
[50:11] tasted and heard
[50:13] but faith
[50:15] all right i know i'm repeating myself
[50:16] through these three services faith goes
[50:19] beyond that
[50:20] and believes in existence of unseen
[50:22] realities
[50:25] and
[50:26] it's influenced by them
[50:29] we can find a lot of people who believe
[50:30] in things that we don't see
[50:34] come on somebody
[50:35] right find a lot of people who believe
[50:38] in these other things but we believe not
[50:40] only do we believe in the unseen but
[50:42] we're influenced by it
[50:48] and as we mentioned before
[50:51] i think express it this way science even
[50:54] admits this the fact that they can't a
[50:56] human can't perceive higher than three
[50:57] dimensions doesn't preclude its reality
[51:02] they cannot they cannot disprove it
[51:06] just because
[51:07] you cannot perceive higher than these
[51:09] three dimensions does not mean it's not
[51:10] there and so what is it what does faith
[51:12] become the reality to us
[51:14] of that reality
[51:16] that they're theorizing about because
[51:18] faith transcends all our biological
[51:20] restrictions
[51:23] by faith you may not be by human ability
[51:26] you may not be able to do it with man
[51:27] this is impossible
[51:29] but with god all things are possible
[51:32] in the church age book
[51:34] i have a few more i had several other
[51:36] quotes here just that i might perhaps
[51:38] read
[51:41] let me just let me just run through
[51:43] these real quick i could just do them
[51:44] because these they really spoke to me
[51:45] and helped me
[51:47] and this
[51:48] little billabong's talking about man
[51:50] has five senses
[51:53] and he says but there's actually a sixth
[51:55] sense he's talking about faith faith is
[51:57] the substance that things hope for
[52:00] the evidence of things you do not see
[52:01] taste feel smell or hear i think maybe
[52:03] this is is this what is this the last
[52:05] slide i have on there is a question to
[52:06] answers part one
[52:09] okay then i'll i'll come back to that
[52:11] brother brad i'm is praying this is the
[52:13] message speak to the rock he says when
[52:15] anointed the holy spirit gets upon us
[52:16] then we seem to forget that we're still
[52:18] earthly
[52:19] that's what i want
[52:21] all right let's talk about get in the
[52:22] spirit
[52:23] a lot of people do a lot of stuff to get
[52:25] make things happen right
[52:27] work ourselves into a healing no get in
[52:29] the spirit and then watch things happen
[52:31] he says when we get in the spirit we
[52:33] seem to forget that we're earthly there
[52:34] seems to be a deeper sense of something
[52:36] more real
[52:40] and he says it makes us do things that
[52:41] are hard to understand by the carnal
[52:42] mind
[52:44] and proof of his resurrection he's
[52:45] referring to
[52:46] discernment of spirits and they said
[52:47] they misunderstood it they didn't know
[52:49] what it meant it blinded their eyes
[52:50] miracles and things blinded their eyes
[52:52] and so it is today
[52:54] he says because the human mind can't
[52:56] understand it right and when the human
[52:58] mind can understand it what does the
[52:59] scientific human mind do just rejects it
[53:02] says you've got to get out of your own
[53:03] human mind and be born again by the holy
[53:05] spirit and get the mind of god in you
[53:07] then you can believe those things then
[53:08] it becomes a reality
[53:14] it says in another place how that you
[53:16] know when he that heareth my word and
[53:17] believeth on me has everlasting life not
[53:19] a make-believe it's absolutely something
[53:22] that's happened a conversion of the
[53:23] heart that's changed you and brought you
[53:25] into another realm
[53:27] men misunderstood christians women
[53:30] christians women men boys and girls that
[53:32] misunderstood
[53:33] who lived in those places
[53:36] people who live in those places in that
[53:37] other realm are misunderstood because
[53:39] it's contrary to the natural run of life
[53:41] among people of the world
[53:43] this natural run of life
[53:45] the the demonic has become accepted
[53:48] right
[53:49] the demonic is accepted and it's they're
[53:51] assimilated into it because it's by
[53:52] design by satan's interruption it's they
[53:55] accept these things as oh well they can
[53:56] feel that way and though they can be
[53:58] biologically in every single way be this
[54:00] they can be something else that doesn't
[54:02] actually exist only by nomenclature by
[54:05] name those things have become real but
[54:07] they can't grasp the above part
[54:11] because when man fell it sold that e
[54:13] that beneath into the channel of life it
[54:16] sewed that into the realm of mortals so
[54:17] now it's the divine that cannot be
[54:19] comprehended it's the divine that cannot
[54:21] be understood and it's contrary to the
[54:23] natural run of life among the people of
[54:25] the world
[54:27] and simon hear you him that's the reason
[54:29] today we find people so against the
[54:30] supernatural and against the things of
[54:32] god because they've been disobedient
[54:35] if they lived up in that realm where
[54:37] they should be they'd recognize these
[54:38] things
[54:40] so there's a there's a place to live to
[54:42] recognize
[54:43] and in the church age book chapter 6
[54:47] thy tareen i just i know i veered off a
[54:49] little bit there he says now according
[54:51] to these verses now when he says these
[54:53] verses he's referring to the depths of
[54:55] satan but more particularly
[54:58] ephesians 3
[55:00] that we may be able to comprehend with
[55:02] all saints was the breadth and length
[55:03] and depth and height this is what he's
[55:04] referring to this is how he amplifies
[55:06] ephesians 3 17 to 19.
[55:08] now according to these verses
[55:11] when a man experiences the depth of god
[55:13] in his life because how is it that
[55:15] brother brahm treats the phrase the
[55:16] depths of satan he says all theologians
[55:19] historians no one ever really touches
[55:20] this because they don't know what it is
[55:22] he goes well he gives a simple formula
[55:24] if you want to understand the depths of
[55:26] satan just understand the depths of god
[55:28] and satan will be the opposite
[55:31] so it wherever god goes satan's going
[55:33] this other way and it kind of forms this
[55:35] mirror image and that's where you see
[55:36] the trinity above the trinity below this
[55:38] realm of pressure then squeezed in the
[55:39] middle he says when a man experiences
[55:42] the depths of god in his life
[55:45] it is an actual personal experience of
[55:47] the spirit of god indwelling in him
[55:51] now i hope you catch this because
[55:53] there's a way that the spirit of god the
[55:54] holy spirit coming in from another realm
[55:56] can anoint everyone in the realm of
[55:58] light time and matter
[56:00] everyone could be impacted by it and
[56:02] it'd be just as temporal as time to time
[56:04] is
[56:05] and just be a baptism that kind of
[56:07] touches the flesh and then that leaves
[56:09] but now when he says once you've
[56:10] experienced the depths of god it's an
[56:13] actual experience of the eternity as my
[56:16] words now eternity indwelling in you
[56:20] so now if it's as if i'm just trying to
[56:23] use language to describe something
[56:24] that's
[56:25] divine and endless
[56:27] if time is looped out of eternity this
[56:30] person who exists within
[56:32] time light matter and time or these this
[56:35] realm of space
[56:36] height width and depth and this and we
[56:38] have this continue a long time it's as
[56:40] if now inside of me is eternity
[56:45] time kind of droops down like this and
[56:47] now it's kind of exist as this subset of
[56:48] eternity but now within me is eternity
[56:52] total different reality totally
[56:53] different sense totally different
[56:54] something greater and it's illuminated
[56:56] his mind is illuminated by the wisdom
[56:57] and knowledge of god through the word
[56:59] that's the that's our life
[57:02] this is how we ought to be living our
[57:03] lives is that i've been born again by
[57:05] the word of god and i want to experience
[57:07] god by my not by being illuminated by
[57:10] the wisdom and knowledge of god through
[57:12] the word every day of my life
[57:16] but the depth of satan will be in that
[57:18] he will attempt to destroy this
[57:21] so what's the depth of satan keeping you
[57:23] from walking in this illumination
[57:25] keeping you from living by that eternal
[57:28] dimension that has now been birthed
[57:30] inside of you
[57:32] he will always attempt to make a
[57:34] substitute for this reality of god
[57:37] and that's what he was doing in genesis
[57:39] 3
[57:40] trying to make a substitute for this
[57:42] reality of god produce this fallen
[57:43] reality how will he do it
[57:46] he will take away the knowledge of the
[57:47] truth of god
[57:48] destroy the word by the putting forth of
[57:50] his own yea hath god said so he comes
[57:53] right back to genesis 3. he will then
[57:55] substitute the personal christ in our
[57:57] spirits
[57:59] this is what he has to do so that
[58:01] mankind now only exists within four
[58:03] dimensions
[58:06] as influence from the trinity below
[58:09] as held under if you want to use the one
[58:11] the one trinity of the
[58:12] of light matter time
[58:15] and then a science and then hell that's
[58:17] all he wants you to live in
[58:19] we're capped at the fifth
[58:21] we're in bondage of this we're under
[58:22] this this this this influence of
[58:25] everything dark brother the scripture is
[58:27] described as coming from beneath so you
[58:29] can just kind of flip it around and
[58:30] describe it a different way but he says
[58:31] he wants to substitute the personal
[58:33] christ in our spirits because that
[58:35] personal christ in our spirits is what
[58:36] tethers us back into the eternal loop
[58:40] so it permanently puts us there with our
[58:42] identity
[58:44] not just church services where the
[58:45] blessings can fall we feel good but it's
[58:47] by that new birth experience the soul is
[58:49] now locked back into the eternity again
[58:51] and that's what that's how you possess
[58:53] faith
[58:54] that allows you to be controlled in this
[58:56] realm by something greater
[58:58] he will substitute the personal christ
[59:00] in our spirits he will do it as he
[59:01] caused israel to do the same by a human
[59:04] being reigning as king instead of god
[59:07] i've run out of time when there's so
[59:09] much more to amplify do you recognize
[59:11] how that god was the one that had been
[59:13] rejected when they requested the king
[59:15] not samuel
[59:17] because samuel wasn't their king but
[59:18] what did they not want to be governed by
[59:20] an invisible god
[59:22] they didn't want an invisible god they
[59:24] wanted a literal king that they could
[59:26] kneel to they could hear they could
[59:27] touch and so that's how god was deposed
[59:30] as king over israel that's why god said
[59:32] they've rejected me not you samuel
[59:35] because i was the unseen that was
[59:37] governing them and that's what elevates
[59:39] the bride's faith
[59:41] because she's willing to make the lord
[59:43] her king who cannot be seen will not
[59:46] accept the pope will not accept a bishop
[59:48] will not accept a man as the husband of
[59:51] the church but she only accepts her
[59:53] headship as the word
[59:58] the born-again experience will be
[1:00:00] rejected in favor of church joining
[1:00:02] better not make this mistake
[1:00:04] the depths of satan had been entered
[1:00:06] into in that age and the fruit of that
[1:00:08] depth of satan which are lies murders
[1:00:10] and horrible crimes came forth
[1:00:12] from it because the depths of satan is
[1:00:15] what's produced all those things in the
[1:00:17] world today
[1:00:24] is that
[1:00:25] that does do these things kind of shed
[1:00:28] maybe more light or just go back over
[1:00:29] what you already knew a little bit just
[1:00:31] to refresh these things in my of these
[1:00:32] invisible dimensions and how that faith
[1:00:34] relates to them
[1:00:36] because it's not taking faith
[1:00:38] for people to be influenced from beneath
[1:00:42] because it's been hybrid into the
[1:00:44] existence
[1:00:45] but if you want to if you want to live
[1:00:46] above it you got to connect to something
[1:00:48] greater
[1:00:50] the message when brother man is doing
[1:00:51] his question and answers part one this
[1:00:53] was the first in this four parts there
[1:00:54] in august of 64. he says when you're
[1:00:56] awake in other words you're operated by
[1:00:58] five senses
[1:00:59] see taste fill smell and hear
[1:01:02] them were only given to you to contact
[1:01:04] your earthly home
[1:01:06] and they were not given to you to
[1:01:07] contact your heavenly home
[1:01:10] when god made man and
[1:01:12] he blessed them with his senses
[1:01:15] they could contact the physical eden
[1:01:17] through these senses but they had
[1:01:18] another one that allowed them to operate
[1:01:20] within the eternity the eternal realm
[1:01:22] and the eternal part of their existence
[1:01:24] and that's that channel these channels
[1:01:26] that brethren talks about being clogged
[1:01:27] relate to this he says these are given
[1:01:29] to contact your earthly home there's
[1:01:31] another sense to contact our heavenly
[1:01:32] home that's actually six senses in the
[1:01:34] body because he is the number
[1:01:37] six in the bible he was created on the
[1:01:38] sixth day he is the number six as a man
[1:01:40] is
[1:01:42] and he's got seed taste feel smell here
[1:01:44] and faith
[1:01:46] his faith sets his destination where
[1:01:49] he's headed for
[1:01:51] just like a gps uses coordinates
[1:01:54] and it's those coordinates that
[1:01:56] determine where we are within space
[1:02:00] and they're using different readings
[1:02:02] coordinates
[1:02:03] to say you could give
[1:02:05] you could give somebody a coordinate
[1:02:07] i don't know if anybody does geocaching
[1:02:09] here and and uses these coordinates to
[1:02:11] find something and they're saying if you
[1:02:13] go on these coordinates and you could
[1:02:15] even do it out not necessarily even
[1:02:16] using gps you can use maps and different
[1:02:18] things to arrive at a very precise point
[1:02:21] and it's using three space spatial
[1:02:24] dimensions to identify where somebody is
[1:02:26] and that man can only do that within
[1:02:29] this
[1:02:30] and as time moves on
[1:02:32] gives if something only existed at a
[1:02:34] particular point in time man has to be
[1:02:36] there at that moment in that time to
[1:02:38] identify with otherwise it keeps moving
[1:02:40] on
[1:02:41] again this is why people perceive things
[1:02:42] differently and things here you hear
[1:02:44] something you see something it's all
[1:02:46] because of what man exists within but he
[1:02:48] says faith sets his destination where
[1:02:50] he's headed for faith can put
[1:02:52] coordinates in
[1:02:54] and put man on a course that's not bound
[1:02:58] within this sphere
[1:03:03] as the
[1:03:05] i wish i guess there's just ways that
[1:03:07] you could present this graphically
[1:03:09] but i just want you to see it by faith
[1:03:14] faith sets his destination where he's
[1:03:16] headed for now faith is the substance of
[1:03:18] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:03:20] you do not see taste feel smell or hear
[1:03:22] this is i think just great summary
[1:03:24] statement but by faith when he catches
[1:03:26] the word
[1:03:27] it sends him into a dimension that makes
[1:03:29] it so real to him
[1:03:31] until he's just as good as he's got in
[1:03:33] his hands he knows it's going to happen
[1:03:37] and instead of taking that in the sense
[1:03:39] of oh i'm believing for a new job i'm
[1:03:41] believing for a new job you pop into
[1:03:43] this other dimension where you see
[1:03:45] yourself you wearing the uniform and you
[1:03:46] know it and you see it and you kind of
[1:03:48] describe what might be actually a vision
[1:03:51] we then have this look at it in the
[1:03:53] sense of every day i want to live my
[1:03:54] life in such a way to where it sends me
[1:03:56] into a dimension that makes god's word
[1:04:00] so real to me
[1:04:02] that i'm i'm living in another world i'm
[1:04:04] living in another realm
[1:04:07] that's good
[1:04:10] and he knows it's going to happen
[1:04:14] what help me out here all you call of
[1:04:16] duty fans and everything what is it npcs
[1:04:18] what are they called when they're not
[1:04:19] the main character
[1:04:22] non-playable is it an npc
[1:04:24] yeah so there's i'm sure there's a
[1:04:27] sermon in there somewhere
[1:04:30] but when
[1:04:31] and and i i didn't i haven't played
[1:04:33] games in the
[1:04:34] the day and age now where every game you
[1:04:36] play you're playing against somebody
[1:04:37] else in india and china and everywhere
[1:04:39] else
[1:04:41] but there's a certain concept of reality
[1:04:43] when you're playing um these games
[1:04:45] that you're the main character
[1:04:48] and everything's revolving around you
[1:04:51] and you know you're the only one and
[1:04:52] again you know you're the only one real
[1:04:54] controlling it and it's just something
[1:04:55] simulated that's controlling everybody
[1:04:56] else
[1:04:58] am i going am i am i getting anywhere in
[1:05:00] this
[1:05:01] i'm testing you guys out for a future
[1:05:02] sermon come on you're my test group
[1:05:05] but
[1:05:06] there has to be and there's and we often
[1:05:09] sit in this world and we try to we try
[1:05:11] to i know how my life feels but if you
[1:05:13] want to start feeling funny just start
[1:05:14] trying to imagine how other people feel
[1:05:17] and man to me my life is just when i see
[1:05:19] this person uh that's how they come into
[1:05:21] my life but then you start thinking
[1:05:22] right now you know how you go some of
[1:05:24] young kids you go and you visit grandma
[1:05:25] and grandpa you go to virginia and you
[1:05:27] visit your grandma and grandpa and and
[1:05:29] it's all new and it's fun and it's neat
[1:05:30] when you walk into their house but
[1:05:31] that's going on right now
[1:05:34] wherever that is it's going on right
[1:05:35] those feelings you would get the smells
[1:05:36] you would smell the the activities all
[1:05:38] the it's still those places still exist
[1:05:40] right now and you only know when you
[1:05:42] step into them and you're there within
[1:05:44] uh light matter and time but listen
[1:05:47] whatever that whatever we're
[1:05:48] experiencing here faith now is on a
[1:05:50] whole other level
[1:05:52] and it would be wonderful if we could
[1:05:54] just press ourselves to live into that
[1:05:56] live in that faith live in that realm
[1:05:59] recognize there's things that are more
[1:06:00] real there's a reality greater than this
[1:06:03] one i'm experiencing right now
[1:06:07] and say oh god let me let it let it send
[1:06:10] me
[1:06:11] into an invisible dimension
[1:06:14] and let me walk by that living that
[1:06:16] god bless you trust you're doing well
