TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I would like to say at the beginning that uh Christians they are more than they think you can be lost in your way of thinking unless the word of God will come and capture your mind completely you know um and I will say also at the beginning you know just I trust you'll understand my English I never went to school and learned English never in my life but when I was young I asked the Lord for help and I promis him when he will help me to uh understand English and speak English I will serve him the best possible way also by this language so if something is not there perfect I if I will not use academic uh English this morning please understand but I'm sure I'm 100% sure the holy spirit will give you uh meaning understanding between the lines even the great prophet like brother branam when he was preaching the seventh seal he was not depending on the on his vocabulary and the abilities of Express himself he said Lord just these cut words or sentences you can put together as a picture in the hearts of the Believers in fact we all believe that God was on the scene when he was preaching the seventh seal he was trying to hide himself before the unbelievers and show himself before the Believers that's the reason he used the vessel as he wanted to have and Jesus Christ the same yesterday to and forever uh we are very blessed people we are are more than we think you know in the school they taught us that we are Homo sapiens am I right probably they teach the same in Arizona as they taught us in Poland but I I I'm here to tell you that you are more than you think you are more than Homo sapiens when you look on the street on um our cities wherever we are we can see some people they are Homo uh they are Homo definitely but you know uh not very many are sapiens uh when you look precisely around you can just realize that some of the people they are not acting even as a homo but you know as a Christians we have a promises we had a great precious promises and by these promises we became a partakers of the new nature you are a new creation in Christ Jesus so that's the reason I believe we are more than Homo sapiens because what we can see we are humans yes am I I I'm right you you right if you think like this but if you allow the Holy Spirit come inside of you you are more than Homo sapiens God is using your skin he is putting on your jacket of your Humanity but God is living inside God is living inside with a new nature with a new Thoughts with a new spirit with a new creation with a new language new vocabulary you are becoming a voice for the final generation so you are more than you think and brother Bram here taught us you know exactly what he meant because you heard that hundred of times he referred to Mark 11:22 he said whatever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass you can have what you have said because when God and the man is in unity God is omnipotent am I right God is omnipotent but if he is living inside of you if he has chosen you if he has revealing himself to you you are also omnipotent that's that's that's plainly written in the Bible maybe not the way as every member of every denomination or or religion uh religious club uh thing like that but Jesus he said whatever you will ask believing in your heart you will receive it whatever it means a man filled with the Holy Spirit subject to God and under supervision of the holy spirit is omnipotent it means whatever two or three Gather in his name wherever two omnipotents are coming or three omnipotents or maybe 100 or more than 100 if they are coming in the name of Lord Jesus Christ coming together all things are possible God is omnipotent man is omnipotent subject to the Holy Spirit when the two or three got in his name the omnipotence of God is coming down as he promised that I I am pretty sure you believe it when we are inviting not the Creed this or the but when we are inviting the word of God Among Us my friend the omnipotence of the holy spirit is here right now I don't know your needs I don't know uh what you are looking for your expectation but trusting that you are expecting something from God if we are coming to the position that we don't uh expect anything uh we are losing many things we can be a Christian we can be a Bible believing Christians but if we are not under expect ation any time when we are coming together in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we are missing something God is here and he's a god rich in Mercy yes he he's able to uh to bless you abundantly uh above the uh your expectation and the things you can ask according to the power that is working already in you that's what the Paul said in the in the book of Ephesians that there is a power of God working already in you whatever you ask looking up looking uh even uh to the direction of the Heavenly places you must understand the the answer will come from inside of you because he will respond you according to the power that works already in you what is laying in you then the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ that is not in heaven but is on the earth amen God opened my eyes many many years ago I was raised I would say uh my parents they told me uh come to church any time time I was raised as a Lutheran but I I when I was 14 I said no I became really a Protestant I said I will no not come to church anymore because I see the people that are living a double life and you know I I I I was only partitional right because that's what my saw uh my my eyes saw it was right but it didn't um justify me in those days being a teenager to Cease the coming and listen the word of God even on that portion that I had probably I would stay there I would just know more maybe it would be on a Crums from the table of the Lord but I would just grow better but since I became a real Protestant and I became a pro Protestant against this system you know I landed completely in the world and I didn't have a Christian education and so forth I was uh telling the people uh those things are not existing you know and so forth I was a really really tough guy but uh when I I was 18 Lord was very gracious to me when I was 18 he opened my eyes uh it was a miracle it was an absolutely Miracle because I'm coming from the little town 20,000 people and when I became a Christian you know everyone was talking about my conversion and the people they were split some of them they said it's possible some of them they said no the it's impossible you know but whatever they say whatever was their opinion I'm still on this blessed path yes I never change it God revealed to me this message beautiful message of Malachi 4 revelation of the son of man and I'm so blessed you know that I could just believe it I brought my wife uh I met her in the kindergarten she was five I was five but uh we've been on the different pages she was a very nice young lady very very uh uh faithful beautiful and so forth I was a troublemaker but the Lord just opened my eyes and then when he opened my eyes I brought my wife wife it is a long story but I brought my wife to the Lord Jesus Christ uh and I married her and we are very very blessed and our children are blessed serving the lord and the Lord is very gracious so I encourage you I don't know your your your mind I don't know your attitude but this message there's nothing on the face of the Earth you can compare with this message I was in the 70 countries I met many people I met there people that believe and met people that are really against it you know I always say the same you know I am the fruit my marriage is the fruit my family is the fruit of the pure word of God I I I took a stand for this word for all these years and I'm going to do it for the rest of my life and I encourage you my friend we have to recognize who we are and don't look back don't look back even if you read the story or or or or the life story of the Great Men of God I appreciate all of them if they preach the truth in their age they were tremendous great people but I would like to say something greater than this that was in the past God stored for you and me and don't look back look on the hour look on the on the moment of the history we are living right now and please recognize who you are Lord is so gracious to Us Praise the Lord hallelujah and uh even when I'm talk to you about uh we have to recognize our position we have to recognize we are super church we are uh by the grace of God of course super race we we are omnipotent and our father is omnipotent some people they don't believe it but this is very simple if there is a fox if the fox will bring forth what kind of spe will bring forth foolx will bring forth folks elephant will bring forth elephant definitely horse horse cat cat human will BR bring forth human God will bring forth amateur Gods that's what he promised you know we can believe it or not but if you will believe it it will just put you on the on the higher level in the spiritual understanding but this is not all just to say around I I I know who I am I'm the message is not enough if you'll be in the message then still the message must be in you still you have a have to have a testimony personal testimony like Jesus he said in the St John 14 20 at this day yes you shall recognize as I was in the father father in me I am in you you are in me so it's not enough to say I'm in the message message must be in you amen what's the purpose why why we have to recognize who we are it's just to be puffed up just to think that we are better than the other churches or something like this forget it if God shows you who you are there's always a purpose behind there is a job to do this is the reason that's what I I I would like to share with you something that is on my heart they are Greater Works give them eternal life we want to deal with this if you if you know who you are there is a job to do yes to you have to understand exactly why why I am the way I am you know uh in the story that we read from the book of Esther chapter 7 you have to spe speed up I know that uh the customs in the States you know that uh they told me when I was some years ago I think was a North Carolina certain uh nice evangelist great brother and faithful worker on the on the God's Vineyard he told me you know when you are traveling in the United States uh evangelist uh it's it's it's a specific time given to the Evangelist is not more than one hour and the pastors they have uh 1 hour 15 minutes if this is in the midweek meeting and maybe uh maximum 1 hour and 30 minutes on Sunday so I'm trying I'm trying to do the best I don't want to offend you uh also I don't want to offend the holy spirit so we we we we talk a little with the pastor be before the meeting I'm trying to uh stay stick to the golden middle that's what the Brad BR he told us in 1965 I stay with the golden middle not too short not too uh not too long I'm watching you constantly as I'm watching go a holy spirit if I will see you you you're falling asleep or just not not everyone but maybe majority or or do that you are tired you know sometimes this is this is a problem of evangelists that are so in fire you know they are never tired you know but the congregation is tired so I'm not trying uh to to follow the idea I'm watching you if you'll be very tired and you I will see on your face that you are not pulling you know I will slow down I will slow down and finish but bear with me please you know this is a big thing big subject big thought not because of me but something I I would like to show you something to encourage you that you will realize there was a never hour like this hour there was a never possibilities like we have there are potentials laying in you that you never imagine Enoch he couldn't imagine Paul he couldn't imagine my friends even brother branam in his time he was prophesying predict many things you know but the the the on the uh on the clock God's clock let's say the clock of etern Eternity oh no the clock of humanity or the clock of the church he the further he saw it was a 1977 he said beyond this is a Darkness I cannot believe the Christians can live here this is the the the the the firstest point I can see because he was a messenger to the seven Church age but we are under influence of the mighty one the mighty Angel he's the messenger to his wife to the bride that's the reason we are living in a Bright's Age We supposed to always realize that we we are uh connected and brought to the Eternal age Bright's age the Bright's coming of Christ so the Book of Esther chapter 7 we read you know uh you know there was a great woman but we have to just see a little background of this woman how she was elevated on a certain position how she took a stand but it was not from uh uh uh from day to day she was in the process of preparation she was the process she was chosen she was elected not by herself she found the grace in the side of the king but she was prepared by the two great uh uh persons one was morai he was a pastor he was giving advices for Esther what to do do what not to do how to act in a wise way and um and also uh hegi hegi was a type of the messenger that was taken up to the mind of King and he knew exactly what the king lik it and what he didn't like so these two persons shape her but first of all she was uh in the Covenant she was a Jew she was she was without the mother without the father that is showing also the hour we are living right now she was a orphan she was not Guided by the father or mother not by the fleshly arm of the fleshly wisdom but she she was prepared uh in a special way for the hour that she didn't realize that was on the scene we know how the everything looked in the book of uh uh Esther that uh it was a king and there was vashy the the queen and everything looked nice until a certain day when the king wanted to present the queen and the queen she was ashame of him exactly like today the churches Beautiful People beautiful churches as beautiful as never before they're ashamed of the king who is the word they're not ashamed of the singing uh worshiping uh lifting up hands and uh the creas and having a big Bible and everything but I ashame of the word and the beginning was the word and the word was with God the Word was God right and our King our King is the word of God yes right so we know there was a big uproar in the kingdom and finally a seven Elders uh you know Wise Men was called To Take decision what to do with vashi and the one was telling like this the other was telling like that but there seven one mukan which means the the noble one the noble one he said no no no no no the problem is not only the problem of uh of the king and the queen but this is a problem of the Kingdom yeah because this woman she was ashamed uh of the king the the the husband and having a um you know another Revival another Feast you know uh along with the uh with the Feast of the king and she didn't want to come to the to the party of the of the king but you know it was like a too much feminis yeah she she was only surrounded by other ladies and so forth but the mukan the noble one he said no this is a serious case because when we will accept it All the Troubles will come to the families so you can see how the what's going on with the king and the attitud of the king and the attitude of the church you know how it is reflected finally in the families but mukan means the noble one no wonder the brother branam when he was uh uh being in Arizona and thinking all his life having a certain questions in his heart one day when he met the constellation of the Seven Angels right here in this land my friend when he was taken up to the constellation of seven angels he met the seven one he said I was thinking all my life I have a question but I I felt a special connection with a seven one and he said was a noble one in this constellation it was a mukan of the hour my friend he received a revelation something that just went around the world even they reaching Poland which is a Catholic country 97% of population of my country almost 40 millions of people they are Catholics we are very very few but this message went and sweep around the earth very quickly without a headquarter without the efforts of the man he was the Holy Spirit and still does the great work my friend yes so when the mukan the noble one he gave the Revelation to the king and this Revelation came to the to the elders and he was coming to the every man of the Kingdom beautiful time of the hour we are living right now praise the Lord and finally we know there was a man his name was a Hamman he was a very very evil person and we know that hamon he was a center of the hatred towards uh God's people in that time and we know that Hamman uh it was a problem that the King Saul didn't solve in his time and he uh he was a very religious person but didn't have a determin what to do what not to do and he didn't realize that you have to kill sin you have to uh really deal with the wrong seat in your kingdom in your kingdom in the church in your kingdom in your home in your kingdom in your personal Kingdom because you are the kingdom of God on the Earth but he was a compromiser he was a big he was a very intellectual he he was a fair in the eyes of the people great king great Soldier Mighty General but he made a mistake by sparing a life on the wrong King so that's how the the wrong seed was transported from the age to age from the age to age until the kingdom of Ash feros came with the queen Esther so we see that now uh do you believe and I know that you believe but according to Genesis 1:26 Bible teaches us right at the beginning that God gave Dominion for the human being God Gave You Dominion Authority and power to rule over your kingdom over the animals wild animals peaceful animals and different occasions situations circumstances God gave you dominion and we can see the problem is that uh you know many spiritual people from the spiritual lineage you know they kind of struggling through all the Bible all the history of the humanity to catch really what kind of dominion God gave us the reason is unbelief the reason is the the Adam he forfeited the access to the Dominion to the full awareness of who he was who is a real man all of them they were just drop on the level of homo sapiens and very few realize that they are more than Homo sapiens some of them they fall even lower but the Dominion was given to the humans Dominion is given to the church that's what Jesus he said whatever you will do you will say on the earth in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the manifestation of the word of your hour if church built on the rock of Revelation whatever you will say the Heavenly say Amen whatever you bind here on the earth will be bound in heaven whatever you lose here will be lost in heaven this is dominion and I have a question when Jesus took it away from the church yeah he gave it yes it belongs to us but the problem is then we see through the history that this Authority somehow landed in the hands of the wrong people that's the reason we can see in the Book of Esther there was a king with a royal Ring The Ring of authority and Dominion was on the finger on the of the king but somehow the Bible teaches us that the hamon rise up with the wrong plot to destroy God's people to wipe away the God's seat from the face of the Earth in those days be with they full of hate IES typing the Antichrist that he doesn't play there's a one purpose one goal to destroy the kingdom of God on the earth so when the king he gave to Hammon the Ring Ring of dominion and uh Authority we can see how this Dominion landed in the hands of the wrong person that's exactly what happened for last 6,000 years the Dominion that belongs to God's Church God's people somehow we can see how the people of this Earth they don't have a problem to subject this Earth subject certain land you know how the kings of this Earth Kings of the Nations how they are ruling and doing different things you know they are just uh practicing what they found in the Bible even if they question that it's coming from God they are acting really on the power and authority God gave to a man so for a certain time you know the the king uh the king's U uh uh you know Authority the the king's ring was in the hands of Hammon Hammon was a really bad person we know it but the spirits don't die Spirits don't die don't expect that you will meet today person with the name hon uh showing expressing the hatreds towards you no no it's hidden is a the name is changed the character is the same the evil is even deeper is more visible ruling exercising the power but should be in the hands of the church amen we supposed to recognize who we are you know uh so we can see how between the fifth and seventh chapter Book of Esther how God cannot sleep how uh King cannot sleep God cannot sleep he cannot sleep today until the word of God will be fulfilled the king as Pharos he couldn't sleep the Sleep went away from him sometimes you have a problem I don't know about you but sometimes you cannot sleep by night and you're a little nervous why I cannot sleep you know and sometimes there is a little mosquito is coming disturbs your sleep and your anger that happens with me sometimes I need some minutes to realize that God sent this mosquito in the middle of the night to take away the sleep from me because he want to have a fellowship in the quietness of the time amen so we can see that between the fifth and the seventh chapter of Book of Esther there was a two Banquets in the fifth chapter seventh chapter the queen she organized banquet in the both occasions the King was invited in the banquet of the great Revival H spiritual food uh natural food spiritual food you know and it was a great great feast in a both occasions hamon was there it was very important that he would be there I believe according to Psalm 23 that God said I I give you if the Lord is your Shepherd I give you certain uh reward that sometimes you go through the Valley of the Shadow sometimes you you you think where I am why I facing such a Temptations troubles opposition resistance in my life why why why why this is the reason God is leading you sometimes through a valley of Temptation tempting Temptations are coming to prove who you are even if you are coming through the valley of the shadow of death he said I will cause that the enemy that is fighting against you tempting you he will sit not around the table you will sit you will sit with the King Psalm 23 but your enemy will look at it when you are feasting with your husband with the word you are feasting we are feasting now because seven course many Seven Seals are revealed since many many years and God open our eyes to see the full Redemption not only salvation full Redemption for a purpose why he saved you why you Christian why you a Son of God why a daughter of God for a purpose and the and the reason why God sends fivefold Ministry the voice of God right to your heart under the seven messenger is to Quicken you to the high understanding and conscious what God requires from us look at the Esther Esther at the beginning she was just a uh she was she was without the father without the mother but she was like from another civilization she was like a special special lady but when she was born as a baby God didn't speak to her about the serious things she didn't understand the calling until she was chosen by King she was in the palace she was clothed properly she was announed properly exactly like a king likes amen there's a is very important how we look what what kind of a smell is around us you know uh Paul he said that about the right kind of smell I don't know this is the right word maybe odor or whatever what is better yeah both yeah thank you Pastor amen so wherever we go we supposed to bring impact influence being Assa of this Earth that's what the she was but she didn't know it from the beginning finally she was Queen as we say I'm the bright I'm the bright what the next I am the bride brother don't you know it yes I know why why you are the bride why you are the Queen of Heaven why why why she didn't know it until she was adopted until she was mature and until she was placed on the position and everyone could see who she was even in the ring of King was circulating somewhere even in the king the Power Authority it looks like was in their wrong hands still she was adopted she was Queen she was on the position and if someone would like to see the king it was even enough to see the queen even if the King was absent and the Esther was appearing she was revealing what was in the king that's what the true bride she's doing today even the physically Jesus is not on the earth and won't be until this Earth will be purified by fire he will come down he will put his precious feet on the Earth but now who can see the bride can see the bridegroom this is the time for the true Revival this is the time to really realize who you are brother where's the Revival we came to make a study great theologians came from United States to see the wel Revival where this you found it friends you found it friends there was a policeman just uh moving his uh police stick he said you you arrived don't look for the building I am the wedge Revival I am the priz Revival I Am The Voice yes I am the life I am the resurrection yes I am I am I am the Revival bride's Revival so between the fifth and the seventh uh chapter of Book of Esther between the first and the second banquet of the queen you know you'll say what it has to do with me a lot a lot honestly if you want to get something from the king from your husband you have to prepare atmosphere even the Bible teaches us that God dwells in the uh Praises of his people so it means that you cannot bring down the presence of the king in your life if you are complaining constantly if you are uh not happy brother are you happy yeah my faith feels happy not always my flesh feels happy not always my spirit is happy but I'm trying to not to be focused on the outer Realms I'm interested what God invested inside of me that's the reason I'm happy I'm really happy and I trust you are happy too you will say this is not so easy I don't say this is easy brotheri said I will have to neglect and I neglected many things in my life in 1965 because being a minister not always I dedicate children the way I should not always I bury the old as I should I neglect my duties but I'm faithful to the third pool which is my mind focus on the word so it it shows us friends that we the churchianity churchianity is not our uh our goal maybe you will neglect something in your life probably you have to if you want to have a third pool if you want to be focused if you want to come to maturity to adoption you have to put off some things and that people will blame you if you are Christian why you are not doing this why not doing that you will have to sacrifice something in order to get something that's what the Malachi for Prophet did he said this is the third pool of my Ministry my mind Focus constantly on the word amen so now that's what happened with Esther between the fifth and the seventh uh chapter between the first and the second Feast big thing is going on big thing is going on King cannot sleep his peace his rest is interrupted and now he said just bring me some Chronicles we would say which kind of Chronicle the first Chronicle or the second Chronicle of the Bible maybe the third one once I preach for the young people in our church about the third Chronicle of the Bible and there is a first second Chronicle this is history but what about your church what about your life there is a third Chronicle of the Bible very personal you can look back at five years ago you can look what happened in your life your family in the church you know the 10 years ago there's so many things it this description of the battles and uh lost battles and uh you had the victories you've been sick maybe the church was a little sick many people were sick you know everything is written there but the king he said bring me a a a Chronicle bring me the books because I cannot sleep and I started to read for him and he discovered by listening think the Chronicles someone was telling him you know happened this happened that do you know King there was a plot against you oh he didn't know it he said he was rewarded the person that discovered the plot against me no no no what is his name they said is written in the book his name is in the book his name is mordai bring him here I want to reward this man my friend be between the the first feast and the second Feast something really great essential was going on morai that was hated by someone that have a Dominion a ring of the king and a power authority over mordai the scenaries change there is a shift of the power and slowly morai is brought on the scene because he was the teacher he was the pastor of this chosen lady that she was born for certain purpose not only to say I am the queen but there was a work to do we are born friends we just we cannot realize completely the reason of our birth we know sometimes the reasons of our natural birth but the Bible says that the that the younger one will rule over the older your second birth is more important we know so less so small about who really we are we are coming to the place of satisfaction for a while we think I understand yes I see yes I see but I want to see myself see the situation my family the church my pastor five Ministry I want to see the circumstances around and myself the way God can see me that's my desire really it can change your life that's what happened with the morai because he was placed finally on the horse and the greatest enemy was leading him God was showing where the power is my friend do you know you have a you have a horse your horse is ready amen not like one brother I don't want to men mention his name but in one of the dreams you know he had a great dream and he came to brother branam and he said brother branam in that dream I had a horse I had a great horse which is a power I believe there's those horses we can see in the Revelation 19 he telling us that power is coming back Dominion is coming back according to Revelation 19 on the face of the Earth will be Way Beyond the Kings all of them they will be against the King of Kings and the Lord of lords but this man he was a pastor but he saw the great horse a beautiful but he was looking at the horse and the horse is not given to you just to look at it you must be identified with the power that God destinated for you is your power is your gift your position we cannot exchange it we cannot buy it we cannot sell it this is your position but this man was looking on the horse too long and he looked back and he he started to talk with his wife typing that Church brother bam said he was started to talking and uh and uh and negotiate and whatever being focus on the church instead of on his position because the the horse represented the word personal revelation personal power is given to you when he started to talk with his wife too long he looked back and the horse was not there my friend don't do this mistake don't think that we can do whatever we want because we are we are this or that I have a position brother I know who I am me too but what we do with this yes this is the Urgent hour and the Esther she didn't know it until morai he came how you know you think that you your life will be spurred you you will be your head will be chopped off you you will be killed murdered because you are part of the Jewish lineage and there is a sentence already Doom over this race how you know don't you know that you are born for the moment like that for the time such like this what about us friends she was Queen already but she was in danger like today you know when when you see sometimes God help us not to be unaware help us to be aware who we are not just say I'm the bride Hallelujah we can sing nice songs about being a bride being a bride's coming of Christ bride's Revival and on and on and on we have to recognize and act upon the word of God yes here recognize and act upon the every promise got Quicken to you amen you will say I'm young man I was also many years ago young man I thought you know when I was 18 maybe a 15 16 I met the people on the street they were giving testimonies singing preaching spreading uh some tracks and always I I sto with them because I wanted to discuss I want to argue I want to prove them they are wrong so somehow you know they they told me Faithfully some scriptures that you know you you you cannot forget it even if you don't believe it you say I don't believe it it's so powerful amen if you speak the word to any person they can say I don't believe it how you know what's going on in the heart but I always said when I will be 50 or 60 or 70 I will consider but first I want to live my life I want to touch it I want to smell it I want to just really use my opportunity when I will be an old man old grandpa maybe I will serve the Lord that's what I said being a 15 or 16 or 17 but being 18 He he came across of my life he didn't pay attention to my words zero value zero value my words you know sometimes we are meeting people they are so much against and they are mean you don't know what's going on in their heart be faithful pray bless these people even if they curse you you don't know what is behind Okay I have to speed up you know speed up really you know we can see how the whole situation was changed because the name of mordai from the book was revealed spoken by the king reward this man for many else he was not rewarded When you pray you say oh but God didn't respond today it it it changes nothing God will never fail the Bible teaches us even the Book of Revelation when the seventh seal was open in Revelation chapter 8 right after revelation of the seven seal that was mute in heaven but not on the Earth right after that the the the the the the prayer of the Saints was poured it means he was collected for many many years and situations but when the seventh seal was open Redemption was real yes effectual amen real my friend in the right time God will respond have faith so we can see now God is giving Authority the the ring that was with the King finally was with a hamon but for a certain period of time Dominion of the kings of this Earth is almost over the ring came to mordukai and the King he said write whatever you want ask whatever you

was a one of the deacons from bran Tabernacle the Brad bran he said when he was telling about the creation of the SCS he said brother can you dismiss our house meeting with prayer and this man the one of the deacons from Tabernacle he was praying Lord if this is truth if this is truth what bra said and he mentioned also about the forth scr may he will be able to find the forth Forth One it sounds uh Innocent but it was a prayer of unbelief and when the Holy Spirit heard that there was a deacon in the church questioning the testimony of the creation first time in the history of the mankind creation out of nothing three scrs God inspired a little simple lady had toite kaps he said he said when we were attending the BR Tabernacle we've been always afraid of this woman because not always you know her her uh hairstyle was perfect and other things and we just kind of avoiding the meeting with the hatti right but God has chosen very poor lady a widow not very attractive for the eye and inpired her she said quietly in a house meeting this is nothing but the truth brother branam and it brought down to the little room the dance presence of the Holy Spirit br br he call it super super anointing he said I never experienced that in my life because there is that if there is a challenge of unbelief expect the Holy Spirit Come on the scene he will use a man or woman whosoever is able

fold Ministry is having the same voice come back stay in line come back to the word but you know that bradan said to the sister she was part of the his own congregation she said I don't know know what
