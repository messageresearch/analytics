[0:00] 1 John chapter 3 verse 9 that I'm going
[0:03] to skip to chapter 5 and read verse 18.
[0:06] My title is anti-faith. And there's a
[0:09] lot in this thought, maybe even a lot
[0:11] that's meant to be conveyed by this
[0:14] title, but anti-faith. First John 3:9.
[0:17] Whosoever is born of God doth not commit
[0:20] sin, for his seed remainth in him, and
[0:24] he cannot sin because he is born of God.
[0:29] And then a similar uh statement in
[0:31] chapter
[0:33] 5:18. We know that whosoever is born of
[0:36] God sinnth not. Love just how matterof
[0:38] fact he states it. But he that is
[0:40] begotten of God keepeth himself and that
[0:43] wicked one toucheth him not. Amen. We
[0:47] are wanting the Lord to bless these
[0:49] things. Not just read them and say that
[0:51] we fulfilled or check the box of a text,
[0:53] but we want God to quicken these things
[0:54] to us. God bless you. You can take your
[0:57] seats as you look at this title
[0:59] anti-faith. There's a lot that I'm
[1:01] trying to convey even in the symbolism
[1:03] that we have here. The uh anti- we know
[1:06] means against or opposed to. So it's
[1:09] something that is against faith or
[1:11] opposed to faith, an enemy of faith.
[1:13] I've been looking at uh the subject of
[1:16] anarchy. And if you want to go down a
[1:19] rabbit hole and that is certainly one to
[1:22] investigate through the ages, even going
[1:23] back to the philosophers, uh there's a
[1:26] lot to investigate on it and even see
[1:28] how these things type and relate to our
[1:30] scriptural princ scriptural principles
[1:32] and things that we believe. But anarchy
[1:35] is against rulers, something that's
[1:37] against a rule of law. There was a
[1:39] modern phrase that came to be known as
[1:42] uh for the anarchist movement is no
[1:44] gods, no rulers. And there's a way that
[1:46] you could use anarchy in a positive
[1:49] sense. There was a lot of rich theology
[1:50] through the Middle Ages that God was the
[1:53] ultimate anarchist in that he has no one
[1:56] greater than him and no one above him.
[1:58] But my thought was those things that
[2:00] oppose order, those things that oppose
[2:03] uh God and that are against God. And I
[2:05] see Satan as being one who in the
[2:07] negative sense of anarchy was against
[2:10] God and trying to topple God. And we saw
[2:12] that um as we went through it very
[2:13] deliberately on Sunday on the original
[2:16] sin. But if you'll take John 16:es 8 and
[2:19] 9, I'd like to pick back up on the
[2:22] thought that sin is
[2:23] unbelief. And but our title tonight is
[2:26] anti-faith. It says, "And when he has
[2:28] come, the spirit of truth, he will
[2:30] reprove the world of sin and of
[2:33] righteousness and of judgment." These
[2:35] things, three different things that he
[2:37] will reprove the world of. And it says
[2:39] he will reprove the world of sin because
[2:42] the world did not believe on me. Now we
[2:46] know that there's a lot of different uh
[2:48] attributes of sins. We might say
[2:50] characteristics of sins, fruits of sin.
[2:52] Brother Brandham taught that sin is
[2:55] unbelief and that smoking and drinking
[2:57] and these other things are an attribute
[2:59] of unbelief. And I believe it's very
[3:01] simple to look at it that way that uh if
[3:04] one was to say that the word of God says
[3:06] that this is so and someone doesn't
[3:08] believe it then they're likely to act
[3:11] contrary to it. And so unbelief here
[3:15] Jesus calls unbelief sin. And he says
[3:19] they reprove the world of sin because
[3:20] they believe not in me. So sin is
[3:24] unbelief. Unbelief could be described as
[3:26] disbelief. could be uh defined as a lack
[3:30] of trust or a lack of confidence in God.
[3:33] So very simply, if we look at faith,
[3:35] which we're going to do tonight, sin is
[3:38] anti-faith.
[3:40] And I was appreciated just even some
[3:42] fellowship I was able to have within my
[3:43] own family and some of the feedback on
[3:45] the service on Sunday and just how much
[3:48] of an impact it had. It seemed like it
[3:49] was uh received with quite quite an
[3:52] impact on just how simple it is to see
[3:54] how Satan seduces us away from faith and
[3:58] trust in God. Sin is anti-faith. So if
[4:01] we think of sin as smoking and drinking
[4:03] and fornication and pornography,
[4:05] indulging and those things, then it puts
[4:08] us in a particular arena where we view
[4:09] ourselves, we view the sin, and it's a
[4:12] wrestle in those things when really what
[4:13] Satan's trying to get to get you to do
[4:15] is not believe in God.
[4:18] And so sin is anti-faith. And you really
[4:21] cannot examine sin as we're wanting to
[4:23] and did last service just to
[4:25] substantiate this truth that sin is
[4:27] unbelief. You really can't examine sin
[4:29] without looking into faith or looking at
[4:32] faith. Hebrews
[4:35] 11:6, you can almost quote it without
[4:37] turning to it. But without faith, it is
[4:40] impossible to please him. For he that
[4:42] cometh to God must believe that he is
[4:45] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[4:47] diligently seek him. It's not just
[4:49] merely uh some sense that he's real. Not
[4:52] even a belief in his existence, but in a
[4:55] belief in his character. Because it says
[4:57] believe that he is and that he is a
[4:59] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[5:01] him. It says but without faith. That
[5:04] faith there in the Greek is conviction
[5:06] of truth. And it has with it the primary
[5:09] idea of trust or confidence. And so
[5:13] there is without trust or confidence
[5:15] it's impossible to please God. For he
[5:18] that cometh to God must believe. That
[5:20] means to commit to or put their trust in
[5:24] God. These are the elements that are at
[5:27] the fabric of uh of our relationship to
[5:29] God. It's a fabric of Christianity that
[5:32] we have faith which is a conviction of
[5:34] truth and there's this trust and
[5:36] confidence wherein we commit ourselves
[5:38] to God we put our trust in God. So let
[5:42] me read it this way. Instead of saying
[5:43] without faith it is impossible to please
[5:45] God. With sin it is impossible to be
[5:48] accepted by God. With sin it is
[5:50] impossible to please God. And that's the
[5:53] way that we could read this is not just
[5:55] well I must have faith to please him,
[5:57] but as long as there is sin, I cannot be
[6:00] fully accepted by
[6:04] him. Come on, you're going to have to do
[6:06] better with your amens tonight. Only if
[6:08] you agree. You guys all have your minds
[6:11] on your brackets. Have you finished your
[6:12] brackets? Have you gambled and waged a
[6:15] paycheck on these office pools for the
[6:18] tournament? It's called madness for a
[6:20] reason.
[6:22] The eyides of March are upon you. Wake
[6:26] up. With sin, it is impossible to please
[6:30] God. When we looked at the original sin
[6:31] on Sunday, we saw that at its inception,
[6:34] it was the work of painting a picture of
[6:38] God that was inongruent with his
[6:40] character. It was repainting God, a
[6:43] portrait of God in a way that would
[6:44] erode the woman's trust. Oh, hasn't God,
[6:48] just Elohim, this great one, this
[6:49] distant one said, and then cause the
[6:52] woman to lose trust. And we see that
[6:54] what Satan's goal is to seduce us away
[6:56] from God. It's not showing us something
[6:59] pleasing, as sin is always a mirage. And
[7:01] sin always promised itself as gain, but
[7:03] it's always lost. And so, it's something
[7:06] that's enticing us, but it's not to have
[7:08] us actually partake of what was enticing
[7:10] us. It's only a bait to draw us away
[7:12] from God. Amen. So, Satan's agenda is to
[7:15] always, this is my simple thought, this
[7:17] is my thesis. Satan, Satan is always
[7:19] wanting to weaken your faith in God. He
[7:22] wants to erode your belief in God. He
[7:24] wants to destroy your trust in God. He
[7:26] is after your faith in God. It's the
[7:30] it's the primary subject in the Bible.
[7:32] It is it is that which pleases God.
[7:36] It it's the thing that we all must have.
[7:39] in Mark chapter 4 11 and 12. Just using
[7:42] a number of scriptures tonight that I
[7:44] believe you'll find extremely familiar.
[7:46] I'm wanting to show you how that sin is
[7:50] anti-faith. So the antidote to sin is
[7:53] faith.
[7:55] If I could if you can get the people to
[7:57] believe, brother Brandon was told,
[7:59] nothing will stand anyway. Not even
[8:01] cancer. So that's the ultimate. So, if
[8:03] we could encourage your faith, if we
[8:04] could feed your faith, if we could put
[8:06] faith in perspective to where you just
[8:08] wake up and realize, no, I just want to
[8:10] believe God's word. I just want to take
[8:12] God at his word, it will liberate you.
[8:15] And so, when he was speaking in
[8:16] parables, he's asked the question, why
[8:18] why do you use these parables? And he
[8:19] says, and he said unto them, unto you it
[8:21] is given to know the mystery of the
[8:24] kingdom of God. So, it's kind of
[8:25] revelation or disclosure of these deep
[8:28] truths. But unto them that are without,
[8:30] all these things are done in parables.
[8:33] That seeing they may see and not
[8:37] perceive. So they can see and hear,
[8:40] he'll say, hear, but there's no
[8:41] revelation or depth of understanding as
[8:44] to what they're seeing and what they're
[8:45] hearing. Seeing they may see and not
[8:48] perceive, and hearing they may hear and
[8:50] not understand. What does the perceiving
[8:53] and understanding accomplish? You got to
[8:56] catch how the principle he's building
[8:57] off of. lest at any time they should be
[8:59] converted and their sin should be
[9:01] forgiven them.
[9:04] This revelation and understanding
[9:06] conquers sin. And that if they were able
[9:09] to have faith in the word of God,
[9:11] believe it and accept it, faith and
[9:13] understanding would overcome disbelief
[9:15] and therein would lie their conversion,
[9:18] their change, and their sins would be
[9:20] forgiven them. So the inability to
[9:22] perceive and to understand would keep
[9:25] someone from having their sins forgiven
[9:28] and them their souls converted or their
[9:31] experience
[9:33] converted. Take these uh principles as
[9:36] little building blocks so they could
[9:37] paint a picture for you this evening in
[9:39] Romans chapter 6 17 and 18. But God be
[9:43] thanked that ye were the servants of
[9:46] sin. So you were in bondage under the
[9:48] taskmaster of sin. You were under the
[9:50] bondage of sin. But ye have obeyed from
[9:52] the heart. This is belief from the
[9:55] heart. This is conviction from the
[9:57] heart. You have obeyed from the heart.
[9:59] That form of doctrine which was
[10:00] delivered you. So there's a doctrine, a
[10:03] teaching. The word has come. You've
[10:05] obeyed from the heart. True faith in
[10:07] something results in action. So it's a
[10:10] speaking of faith. Being then made free
[10:13] from sin. You became the servants of
[10:15] righteousness.
[10:17] Freedom from sin is only through
[10:19] believing.
[10:20] Freedom from sin is not you grabbing
[10:22] some sword and or or gnawing at your arm
[10:25] until your arm falls off and the chains
[10:27] with it. No, that's not how you do it. I
[10:29] remember a Baptist preacher when I went
[10:31] to a private school doing a Wednesday uh
[10:34] uh chapel service and he was uh it's
[10:37] actually the older brother of a a guy at
[10:39] the high school and and was a football
[10:41] player and he was preaching and he
[10:43] talked about fighting the devil and
[10:45] punching the devil till his hands fell
[10:46] off and then nubbing him until his arms
[10:48] fell off and kicking him till his feet
[10:50] fell off and his legs fell off and chew
[10:52] him to death till his teeth fell out and
[10:53] then gum him to death. And boy, that was
[10:55] kind of exciting in that in those old
[10:58] cold uh chapel services we had and
[11:01] everybody was all all excited, but you
[11:03] know, you you couldn't even gum the
[11:05] devil to death. All it takes to overcome
[11:08] sin is faith.
[11:11] You were in bondage to sin. And what
[11:13] liberated you from sin was that you
[11:15] believed and being made free from sin.
[11:18] Now, it's not just merely you've
[11:19] believed in anything. We'll see later
[11:21] just what this is tied to. But made free
[11:23] from sin having obeyed from the heart.
[11:25] Only through faith can you be made free
[11:27] from sin. John 5 24. Verily, verily I
[11:31] say unto you, he that heareth my word
[11:33] and believeth. So there's those that see
[11:36] but do not perceive. There's those that
[11:38] hear but do not understand. So here it's
[11:40] not just the sound waves, but he that
[11:42] heareth my word, just like except you be
[11:44] born again, you cannot see or understand
[11:47] the kingdom of God. He that heareth my
[11:49] word and believeth on him that sent me
[11:51] hath possesses everlasting life and
[11:55] shall not come into condemnation,
[11:57] judgment, damnation, but is passed from
[11:59] death unto life. So if you hear the word
[12:02] and believe, then you'll come into
[12:05] life because unbelief is overthrown.
[12:09] When you believe, unbelief has been uh
[12:11] overcome. It's been overthrown. The
[12:14] price has been paid and through your
[12:15] belief in the word that you heard and
[12:17] your belief in the sacrifice it it enols
[12:20] the sin it overcomes the unbelief and
[12:22] therefore you pass from death into life.
[12:26] Romans 5:1, therefore being justified by
[12:29] faith, that's that conviction, that
[12:31] trust, we have peace with God through
[12:33] our Lord Jesus Christ. That means and as
[12:36] Paul teaches further, the wrath of God
[12:38] has been satisfied through the sacrifice
[12:40] of Jesus Christ and the shedding of
[12:42] blood. There has been a price paid for
[12:44] your sins. Therefore, by faith in that
[12:47] blood,
[12:49] the pace of God is upon us because we're
[12:51] not subject to judgment. Amen. Mark
[12:53] chapter 16 15 and 16. And he said unto
[12:56] them, this is the great commission. Go
[12:58] ye into all the world and preach the
[13:00] gospel to every creature. He that
[13:02] believeth and is baptized shall be
[13:05] saved. There's the obedience from the
[13:07] heart. If you believe and the word
[13:09] teaches you to repent and be baptized in
[13:11] the name of Jesus Christ, then you are
[13:13] believing and will be baptized. And
[13:16] notice it says, "But he that believeth
[13:17] not shall be damned." The reason why it
[13:20] doesn't mention baptism is because if
[13:22] you don't believe, it doesn't matter how
[13:23] wet you get. It's the faith. It's the
[13:26] belief that matters the most. He that
[13:28] believeth and is baptized shall be
[13:30] saved. But he that believeth not,
[13:32] baptism or not, shall be damned.
[13:36] Now, think of this. Despite the fact,
[13:38] and I realize there's maybe the order of
[13:40] this may be uh uh my maybe my order is
[13:43] not very efficient tonight, but we're
[13:44] going to get to it in Romans chapter 3.
[13:47] But despite the fact that the blood has
[13:49] been shed, the price has been paid.
[13:52] There's been a sacrifice because of
[13:54] unbelief, they're still guilty. So, we
[13:57] know that there's been a sacrifice.
[13:59] There's been a shedding of blood. But he
[14:00] that believeth not shall be damned. But
[14:03] there's a sacrifice. There's blood. But
[14:04] if you don't believe, it can't cover
[14:06] you. This is why only believe is so
[14:09] important. Christ sacrifice is
[14:12] appropriated to us for the remission of
[14:13] sins only by faith. It's not by osmosis.
[14:17] It's not by a parent's prayer. It is by
[14:20] faith that Christ's sacrifice is then
[14:22] placed over us so that we're identified
[14:24] with his shedding of blood. By faith
[14:27] alone
[14:28] in Romans chapter 3 23 to 26. For all
[14:32] have sinned and come short of the glory
[14:34] of God, being justified freely by his
[14:38] grace, the redemption that is in Christ
[14:39] Jesus, whom God hath set forth to be a
[14:42] propitiation, the mercy seat through
[14:45] faith in his blood. It has to be through
[14:48] faith in his blood. There has to be
[14:50] believing to declare his righteousness
[14:53] for the remission of sins that are
[14:55] passed through the forbearance of God.
[14:57] to declare, I say at this time his
[15:00] righteousness, that he might be just and
[15:02] the justifier of him which believeth in
[15:07] Jesus. But blood paid the price. But
[15:11] without faith, there is no remission.
[15:13] There's no redemption without belief.
[15:17] Now, we know there's no redemption and
[15:18] no remission without the sacrifice.
[15:21] Could not have it. You could not just
[15:22] believe in God and get to God and get
[15:24] redemption except through the sacrifice.
[15:26] So the blood has paid the price. There's
[15:28] no redemption without the price. But now
[15:31] you need faith because without faith,
[15:33] the stain of unbelief still rests upon
[15:35] the soul. And it means you're still
[15:37] subject to judgment. You're still deemed
[15:40] in the presence of God as a sinner. You
[15:43] could be, I guess you could say, you're
[15:44] guilty of unbelief if you don't have
[15:46] faith. Amen. Acts 10:43. To him give all
[15:51] the prophets witness, speaking of Jesus
[15:52] Christ, that through his name whosoever
[15:55] believeth in him shall receive remission
[15:58] of sins.
[16:00] If you take some time to run it through
[16:02] your concordance or just do a search on
[16:03] your apps on your phone or your laptop,
[16:06] your iPad, whatever it is you use, your
[16:07] Blackberry, you'll find that I am not
[16:10] using even probably a tenth of the
[16:12] scriptures that substantiate how that
[16:14] it's faith in Jesus Christ that avails
[16:17] to us salvation and how important faith
[16:20] is and belief in this end
[16:22] time. And here again it's through his
[16:24] name and by whoever believes in him will
[16:27] have their sins
[16:28] remitted. Paul describes it this way to
[16:31] the Galatians in Galatians chapter 3 22
[16:33] to 24. But the scripture hath concluded
[16:36] all under sin. That's every single one
[16:39] of us. That the promise by faith of
[16:42] Jesus Christ might be given to them that
[16:45] believe.
[16:48] Does it sound like I've just asked AI to
[16:50] keep repeating the same thing over and
[16:53] over again and just say it differently
[16:55] each time? Well, the answer is no
[16:57] because you guys are all familiar that
[16:58] these are well written scriptures, well
[16:59] understood, but it keeps saying the same
[17:01] thing over and over again. There's a
[17:03] reason for this repetition. You know,
[17:06] you'll find there's absolutes in the
[17:08] Bible that we know just by just a couple
[17:10] scriptures, some that maybe even one
[17:11] scripture, but yet we know it is the
[17:13] absolute. It is the word of God because
[17:15] it is God's God breathed. It is in the
[17:17] Bible. But then there are some things
[17:19] that are repeated over and over again
[17:21] that unless you have this foundation,
[17:23] those singular scriptures that hold
[17:26] great truths to us and hold unlimited
[17:28] power cannot be effectively used unless
[17:31] it stands upon the foundation of those
[17:33] things that have been repeated over and
[17:35] over again such as faith in Jesus
[17:37] Christ.
[17:40] Brother Brandham talked about, you know,
[17:41] challenge. Why don't you teach them more
[17:43] spiritual things and and give them
[17:45] greater tools and greater gifts? And he
[17:47] says, "How can I teach them algebra if
[17:49] they don't know their ABCs?"
[17:51] Arizona Believers Church, right there.
[17:53] Right there in the message. Get
[17:54] spiritual. Wake up.
[17:57] Always believe Christ.
[18:00] That's the That's the fundamentals.
[18:02] Those are the That's the
[18:04] basis. And you know, I'll say this. I
[18:06] don't know if this is just personal all
[18:08] of a sudden me just saying it, but I'm
[18:10] not afraid to be criticized for saying
[18:12] only believe. I'm not afraid to be
[18:14] criticized by for saying the word only
[18:16] or just take God at his word and
[18:18] believe. And there might be a lot of
[18:19] people say, "Well, that's just real
[18:20] shallow or that's real this." I know
[18:22] where I stand. I know exactly where I'm
[18:25] standing. I know what this message has
[18:26] opened up. I know the power of God that
[18:28] is that's behind it. I know the devils
[18:30] that we're all facing. And I don't want
[18:32] to trick you into getting all hooped up
[18:33] and excited running out there think
[18:35] you're going to beat devils and not have
[18:36] any faith.
[18:38] And so this is where we're standing.
[18:40] We're standing on something that's sure
[18:41] a sure foundation. It's Jesus Christ
[18:43] revealed to us. The revelation of Jesus
[18:46] Christ faith of God uh faith in the word
[18:48] of God restored in this
[18:50] hour. Says all are under sin that the
[18:54] promise by faith of g of Jesus Christ
[18:56] might be given to them that believe. But
[19:00] before faith came, we were kept under
[19:02] the law, shut up unto the faith, which
[19:04] should afterwards be revealed. So the
[19:06] law was there as a taskmaster, as the
[19:08] one that would govern them. That was the
[19:09] ruler. That was the law to keep them in
[19:11] their place before this faith came. But
[19:14] when this faith was revealed to the
[19:16] Jews, it says, "Wherefore the law was
[19:17] our school master to bring us unto
[19:20] Christ once Christ comes that we might
[19:23] be justified by faith."
[19:25] Faith there is again that's that
[19:26] conviction, that confidence, that
[19:28] belief. It is that which is the opposite
[19:31] of doubt. It's the opposite of
[19:33] skepticism in unbelief. You couldn't
[19:36] just be skeptical and say, "Well, I'll
[19:38] say the saying just in case this Messiah
[19:40] character is actually the Messiah or
[19:43] I'll try to get around it. I I'll see if
[19:45] I can use his power." No, it had to be
[19:48] through belief and trust in Jesus
[19:51] Christ.
[19:55] In acts chapter 13:es 38 and 39 be it
[19:58] known unto you therefore men and
[19:59] brethren that through this man that's
[20:01] Jesus Christ is pre or through this man
[20:03] is preached unto you the forgiveness of
[20:05] sins and by all by him all that believe
[20:09] are justified from all things from which
[20:11] you could not be justified by the law of
[20:13] Moses. The law of Moses had its place.
[20:15] It was a school master. It was a teacher
[20:17] to bring you to Christ. And now through
[20:19] faith in Jesus Christ, you can be
[20:21] justified. Only through Christ is there
[20:23] forgiveness of sins. That by him all
[20:26] that believe are justified from all
[20:28] things. This is not something you could
[20:30] get in religion, not something you can
[20:32] get in Judaism. It's not something you
[20:34] could get at the temple or through the
[20:36] sacrifices of the Old Testament. It's by
[20:38] faith in Jesus Christ
[20:40] alone. No groundbreaking revelations
[20:43] tonight so far.
[20:47] John chapter 3 17 to 21. For God sent
[20:50] not his son into the world to condemn
[20:52] the world, but that the world through
[20:53] him might be saved. He that believeth on
[20:57] him is not
[20:58] condemned. It it's it's just one of
[21:00] these ratios or these sure things. If
[21:03] you don't believe, there's condemnation.
[21:05] Where there is unbelief, there's sin.
[21:07] Where there's sin, there's condemnation.
[21:09] And where there and this is just a
[21:10] condemnation even of ourselves, but we
[21:13] know there's a judgment that's
[21:14] ultimately inferred to here. He that
[21:16] believeth on him is not condemned. But
[21:18] he that believeth not is condemned
[21:20] already. Why? Why is he condemned?
[21:22] Because he hath not believed in the name
[21:23] of the only begotten son of God. That's
[21:25] it. Nothing else. The lack of faith. And
[21:30] this is the condemnation that light is
[21:31] coming to the world. And men love
[21:33] darkness rather than the light because
[21:35] their deeds were evil. What are these
[21:38] deeds born from? Unbelief.
[21:40] All the deeds of unbelief uh we would
[21:43] call sin. and it's rightly so to call
[21:45] them sin. But these are things that we
[21:47] could say are attributes of this fact
[21:50] that they do not believe. For everyone
[21:53] that doeth evil hateth the light,
[21:55] neither cometh to the light, lest his
[21:57] deeds should be reproved. But he that
[21:59] notice this unique phrase, doeth
[22:02] truth, cometh to the light, that his
[22:05] deeds may be made manifest, that they
[22:06] were wrought in God, should be no fear
[22:09] of the believer to be examined by the
[22:11] Son's light. should be no uh fear in the
[22:14] believer's heart to be examined, to be
[22:15] judged. But he that doeth truth, you
[22:18] have those that hate the light. They do
[22:20] not come to the light because their
[22:21] deeds are evil and therefore they're
[22:23] condemned because they believe not. But
[22:26] he that doeth truth, there's some action
[22:29] to that. John 6:es 28 and 29. Then said
[22:33] they unto him, "What shall we do that we
[22:36] might work the works of God?"
[22:40] And Jesus answered and said to them,
[22:42] "This is the work of God that ye believe
[22:46] on him whom he hath sent." Doing truth
[22:49] begins with belief in truth. I wasn't
[22:51] sure if I wrote that down. Isn't that
[22:54] good? You like that? Doing truth begins
[22:57] with believing
[22:59] truth does not work in reverse. You
[23:02] don't you don't you can't do truth to
[23:04] work your way into faith. All that
[23:07] happens when you do uh when you try to
[23:11] do good or do righteousness or do truth
[23:13] without believing in truth. It's an
[23:16] impersonation. This is where a lot of
[23:18] people make their mistake. And not that
[23:19] they're unbelievers or they're not elect
[23:21] or they're serpent seed or all the harsh
[23:23] criticisms maybe one would allege, but
[23:25] they're just getting things out of
[23:26] order. It's belief in the truth and then
[23:29] doing truth starts with believing in
[23:32] truth. You want to work the works of
[23:34] God. He says the work of God is this,
[23:37] that ye believe. That's it. God's desire
[23:40] is that you would believe in him. So
[23:43] much power that's loosed to the believer
[23:45] by believing.
[23:48] And so where we do not believe in God,
[23:50] that's where we can try to do truth, do
[23:53] righteousness, and it's of our own
[23:55] accord.
[23:57] Now, that's a lot of foundation to get
[23:59] to where we were in 1 John chapter 3 and
[24:02] work our way to 1 John chapter
[24:07] 5. In 1 John chapter 3:1, let's just
[24:10] start here and walk through this if we
[24:12] could together. Behold, what manner of
[24:14] love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
[24:17] that we should be called the sons of
[24:20] God. Therefore, the world knoweth us
[24:22] not, because it knew him not. Beloved,
[24:25] now are we the sons of God, and it does
[24:28] not yet appear what we shall be, but we
[24:30] know that when he shall appear, we shall
[24:32] be like him, for we shall see him as he
[24:34] is. And every man that hath this hope in
[24:37] him purifith himself, even as he is
[24:40] pure. Now, we've covered this uh in some
[24:42] detail as of late. Whosoever committh
[24:44] sin transgresseth also the law, for sin
[24:47] is the transgression of the
[24:50] law. Sin is disobedient. Sin is
[24:52] transgression. It is error. We can say
[24:54] sin is unbelief and it's through that
[24:56] unbelief that one would act or do evil.
[24:59] That's the pattern in the beginning. Uh
[25:01] the woman was not fully believing in the
[25:02] promise of God and then made the
[25:04] mistake. There was some credibility
[25:06] issues painted by Satan. There was a
[25:08] there was distance that was established
[25:10] between the woman and God and it gave
[25:12] her enough room to work. Doubt gave her
[25:14] the wiggle room to
[25:15] act. And so in acting she transgressed
[25:19] by unbelief. And ye know that he Jesus
[25:22] Christ was manifested to take away our
[25:24] sins and in him is no sin. Jesus Christ
[25:28] is the only one that was called the holy
[25:30] one. When it was told of Mary the one
[25:32] that she was going to conceive would be
[25:33] the holy one, the sinless one. Why?
[25:36] Because he was not conceived in sin.
[25:38] Iniquity did not shape his members. He
[25:40] was born apart from the fruit of the
[25:43] original sin. He was not conceived by
[25:46] the in the in the image and the
[25:48] similitude of the original sin.
[25:50] Therefore, in him he was free. What was
[25:54] that freedom? That freedom to not by
[25:56] nature sin. We mentioned that on Sunday.
[25:59] I feel like maybe I didn't go into that
[26:00] in more detail that the liberty to the
[26:02] man and the woman had had with it was
[26:04] freedom to not sin by nature.
[26:07] But we are not born with that kind of
[26:09] liberty. We are born with the motions of
[26:11] sin already in us. And we don't have
[26:13] that liberty. We are sinful creatures
[26:16] being driven to sin all the more. And
[26:18] that's why you need the change of nature
[26:21] so that you can operate into this
[26:22] liberty. In him is no sin. Therefore,
[26:25] verse six, whosoever abideth in him
[26:28] sinnth
[26:31] not. We read last time it said,
[26:33] "Whosoever sayith he doesn't sin is a
[26:35] liar." And now this is there's an order
[26:39] to this. Notice just how uh he's not
[26:42] shying away from this to in whom
[26:45] whosoever abides in Christ does not
[26:48] sin. Whosoever sinnth hath not seen him
[26:53] neither know him known
[26:55] him. Notice this key to not sinning is
[26:58] seeing him, knowing him, perceiving,
[27:01] hearing,
[27:02] understanding. And it resolves sin. That
[27:06] he that says he has no sin is a liar.
[27:08] says he has not need of a revelation,
[27:10] has not need of this Christ, has not
[27:12] need of this one that was manifested to
[27:13] take away sin. He's a liar and the truth
[27:15] is not in him. But to him to whom the
[27:18] truth is in that abides in Christ, sin
[27:20] has been taken away from him because he
[27:22] has seen him and heard him and knows
[27:24] him. So it says, "Little children, let
[27:26] no man deceive you. He that doeth
[27:28] righteousness is righteous, even as he
[27:30] is
[27:31] righteous. He that committh sin is of
[27:34] the devil, for the devil sinnth from the
[27:36] beginning." We could take this all the
[27:38] way back to the war in heaven where sin
[27:41] and iniquity was found in Lucifer.
[27:43] Lucifer created by God. In him did this
[27:47] evil arise. This doubt, the suspicion,
[27:50] this war that was w uh uh waged in
[27:52] heaven. He sinned from the beginning. He
[27:55] that commits sin is of the devil's will.
[27:58] For this purpose the son of God was
[28:00] manifested that he might destroy the
[28:03] works of the devil.
[28:06] Notice these two different things. This
[28:07] is the work of God that you believe on
[28:09] him whom he hath sent. What are the
[28:11] works of the devil? Anything that
[28:14] results from you not believing in God.
[28:17] Because the works of the devil were in
[28:19] the beginning to lie, to cause
[28:21] suspicion, to repaint God, all those
[28:23] things that I'd like you to go back and
[28:25] think about in the original sin there in
[28:27] the beginning. And Jesus Christ was
[28:29] manifested in order to destroy the works
[28:32] of the devil. The destruction of the
[28:35] works of the devil comes through the
[28:37] revelation of Jesus Christ which
[28:38] instills in you belief in faith in
[28:42] conviction in God. So he visits it
[28:45] again. Whosoever is born of God doth not
[28:48] commit sin for his seed which is from
[28:51] God remainth in him and he cannot sin
[28:54] because he is born of
[28:57] God. And then this beautiful uh phrase
[29:00] which is very holds a lot of depth to it
[29:03] but kind of summarizes this in this. The
[29:05] children of God are manifest and the
[29:07] children of the devil. The children of
[29:10] God who do the work of God by believing
[29:13] and then the children of the devil who
[29:14] do the works of the devil through
[29:16] unbelief. Whosoever do not doeth not
[29:18] righteousness is not of God neither he
[29:20] that loveth not his brother. And then it
[29:23] gets real right there.
[29:26] Now what we could say to amplify this,
[29:29] there's a lot of things that uh run
[29:31] through my heart to share because it's
[29:33] very plain. Whosoever abideth in Christ
[29:36] does not
[29:36] sin, but he that commits sin is of the
[29:39] devil. So whosoever is born of God does
[29:42] not commit sin. Bible says he cannot
[29:46] sin. Now the only way that you are able
[29:49] to sin or the only way that we do sin is
[29:51] by rejecting the word of God. Go back to
[29:54] the beginning. the woman by rejecting
[29:55] the word or casting aside the word of
[29:57] God, getting rid of the word, forsaking
[29:59] his presence, rebuffing the word. That's
[30:01] the only way that you could even act to
[30:03] do something
[30:05] sinful. And here, one who has received
[30:07] the truth, it's saying that a child of
[30:09] God cannot
[30:12] sin. And I know that that leads that
[30:15] puts us in a
[30:17] quandry. Okay? So, none of that sin.
[30:21] this is the best Wednesday night service
[30:23] I've ever been at. How come I didn't
[30:25] hear that sooner? Or we're like, "Oh my
[30:27] goodness, I'm not I'm not one of his.
[30:30] I'm not a child of God because if I was
[30:32] a child of God, I wouldn't do those
[30:33] things." Kind of puts us in that light.
[30:36] But if you could think of it only
[30:38] initially as this, that sin is unbelief.
[30:42] That a true child of God cannot sin. In
[30:44] other words, you are at your core who
[30:46] you are incapable of unbelief.
[30:51] because you have been born again, it's
[30:52] impossible that unbelief would be laid
[30:54] to your charge.
[30:57] That you cannot sin because there's been
[30:59] something finalized already for you. In
[31:02] Hebrews chap 10:es 1 to2 it says, "For
[31:05] the law having a shadow of good things
[31:06] to come and not the very image of the
[31:08] things could never with those sacrifices
[31:10] which they offered yearby year
[31:12] continually make the comers there unto
[31:14] perfect. These were a shadow of Christ
[31:16] who was to come. That would be the
[31:18] perfect sacrifice. And through that
[31:20] perfect sacrifice, you could be made
[31:22] whole, rendered whole, made perfect.
[31:25] Verse two uh kind of gives us something
[31:28] to uh invert and find. For then would
[31:31] they not have ceased to be offered
[31:33] because that the worshippers once purged
[31:35] should have had no more conscience of
[31:38] sins.
[31:40] When you have by faith accepted Jesus
[31:42] Christ and have been regenerated by the
[31:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost, the sin
[31:46] question is settled. There's no longer a
[31:49] question mark on you. It's been settled
[31:51] in the eyes of God. There is not uh
[31:53] you're not subject to penalty. You're
[31:55] not subject to the second death. You're
[31:56] not even subject to come up in a
[31:58] resurrection in the general resurrection
[32:00] to stand before white throne. The sin
[32:02] question has been settled. Amen. And if
[32:06] that is true, you cannot be a sinner
[32:09] upon whom the wrath of God is destined
[32:11] to fall on and the saint who has
[32:13] inherited eternal life at the same time.
[32:17] Are you following me? If you are a child
[32:20] of God, you cannot be a sinner and a
[32:22] saint at the same time. There it is
[32:26] impossible.
[32:28] You are by faith in Jesus Christ. And
[32:31] I'm not just I'm not trying to teach a
[32:32] theology that says, "Well, when you
[32:34] believe, you've got it." No, there has
[32:35] to be the experience of the baptism of
[32:38] the Holy Ghost as a seal of your faith.
[32:42] And now the wor worshipper is purged.
[32:46] The blood cleanses the soul of sin. It
[32:48] purges you permanently.
[32:51] So that there is this no longer this
[32:53] this mind or consciousness or obedience
[32:57] to sin in your soul.
[33:00] You may look like a sinner to the world,
[33:02] but if you're in Christ, he views you as
[33:05] sinless
[33:07] and incapable of
[33:09] sin. Says you cannot commit
[33:12] sin. Hebrews chap 10 12
[33:18] to18. If you if you remark that if you
[33:22] make note that I'm not reading quotes,
[33:25] uh you'll find that I'm using every
[33:27] scripture I could find where brother
[33:28] Bradom addresses this scripture,
[33:30] substantiates it, answers it in question
[33:31] answers to the 50s and 60s. He's even
[33:33] asked the question, can a Christian sin?
[33:36] And his answer is
[33:37] no. And we could either say yes or we
[33:41] could say there's there's a deep truth
[33:43] that if I can catch a greater revelation
[33:45] of it, I believe I'll fall more in love
[33:46] with God. I believe it'll free me from
[33:49] these kind of church systems and
[33:51] man-made systems and condemnation and
[33:54] the ways that we demoralize oursel. As
[33:56] we said before, there's an image of sin
[33:58] that if we accept it can cause a lot of
[34:00] false pride. But there's also an image
[34:02] of sin that if we accept it can
[34:03] constantly defeat us and bring us down.
[34:06] And the true trajectory of one who
[34:08] accepts the truth of Christ and
[34:10] understands what sin is, it's not that
[34:12] they never make a mistake, but when they
[34:14] do, they can repent of it. Amen. They'll
[34:16] say they're sorry.
[34:19] You saw a license plate on the way to
[34:20] church today and the license plate
[34:21] simply read sorry. So I rolled down my
[34:24] window with the light, got them to roll
[34:25] down their window. I said apology
[34:27] accepted and kept going. And there's
[34:31] there's a repentance that we have in our
[34:33] hearts and we say we're sorry. So it's
[34:35] not it does not stand for the
[34:37] proposition that you never make
[34:38] mistakes, but your mistakes are not born
[34:41] from an unbelieving soul. It's not born
[34:44] from an unregenerated heart. If
[34:46] anything, it's born from muscle memory
[34:48] in your natural spirit.
[34:52] Something that the devil can manipulate.
[34:53] So, Hebrews chap 10 12 and 18. Brother
[34:56] Brandham identifies Hebrews 10. Hebrews
[34:58] uh verses 1-2. Hebrews 12:18. But this
[35:00] man, after he had offered one sacrifice
[35:02] for sins forever, sat down on the right
[35:04] hand of God from henceforth expecting
[35:07] till his enemies be made his foottool.
[35:09] For by one offering he hath perfected
[35:12] forever them that are sanctified.
[35:16] We're not running on a parallel track to
[35:18] Judas who could believe, be justified,
[35:20] and sanctified, but never come to the
[35:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost. He was only
[35:24] believing unto. He could potentially
[35:26] come to it, but having not truly
[35:29] believed.
[35:30] He that he has justified, he has already
[35:33] glorified.
[35:35] So true justification is connected
[35:37] permanently and without fail to
[35:39] glorification. And now the Bible's
[35:41] teaching us that true sanctification is
[35:43] connected with perfection. So he who has
[35:46] truly believed, justified by faith, has
[35:48] the promise of glorification. He that
[35:50] truly is sanctified by truth is
[35:53] connected with perfection. Amen.
[35:56] Forever. Amen.
[35:59] And if that seems to be a difficult
[36:01] proposition for you to handle, the
[36:03] scripture says, "Whereof the Holy Ghost
[36:05] also is a witness to us. For after that
[36:08] he had said before, this is the covenant
[36:11] that I will make with them after those
[36:12] days, sayeth the Lord. I will put my
[36:14] laws into their hearts, and in their
[36:17] minds will I write them, and their sins
[36:20] and iniquities will I remember no more."
[36:24] God does not remember your sin.
[36:28] it it's taken care
[36:31] of for by one offering he's perfected
[36:34] forever them that are sanctified. I can
[36:36] remember as a very very young Christian
[36:38] feeling that I needed a sermon that
[36:39] would just rip my height off. I was here
[36:41] in uh in Arizona maybe in 96 97 or so
[36:44] just visiting family and I found the
[36:47] tape perfection. I was like, "This will
[36:49] be the one that'll really scour me out."
[36:51] And it's in there that Brother Bram's
[36:52] reading from this and he says, "He hath
[36:53] perfected." He spells it
[36:56] ped
[36:58] forever. Forever them that are
[37:00] sanctified. Brother Bram's just almost
[37:02] in tears. And this saying, "Think about
[37:04] it." And he says, "Until the next time
[37:06] you make a mistake, to next time you
[37:09] tell a lie to to the next time you're on
[37:12] the outs with your neighbor." He says,
[37:13] "No, forever." Amen. And then he says,
[37:15] "He that hath this hope, he brings it to
[37:17] first on. He purifies himself even as he
[37:19] is pure." The true revelation of
[37:22] justification, the true revelation of
[37:24] sanctification only drives us further to
[37:27] achieve our glorification and our
[37:28] perfection. It's through the
[37:30] misunderstanding of those things that we
[37:32] justify. Backbiting, lying, stealing,
[37:34] cheating, fornication, you name
[37:36] it. And their sins and their iniquities
[37:39] will I remember no more. Now where
[37:41] remission of these is, there is no more
[37:43] offering for sin. You cannot
[37:47] sin. The the offering has been accepted.
[37:50] The price has been paid. Unbelief can
[37:53] never be attributed to you again. Amen.
[37:58] First John 5:es 1:5. Whosoever believeth
[38:01] that Jesus Christ, Jesus is the Christ,
[38:03] is born of God. and everyone that loveth
[38:06] him that begat loveth him also that is
[38:08] begotten of him. By this we know that we
[38:12] love the children of God when we love
[38:13] God and keep his commandments. For this
[38:16] is the love of God that we keep his
[38:19] commandments and his commandments are
[38:20] not
[38:22] grievious. For whatsoever is born of God
[38:25] overcometh the
[38:27] world. There you go. If you are born of
[38:30] God, you overcome the world. Greater is
[38:32] he that is in you than he that is in the
[38:34] world. And he has already overcome the
[38:38] world. Recognize the devil and his
[38:40] seductive uh tricks and the way that he
[38:42] tries to trip us up. And once we
[38:45] recognize that he uses the art of
[38:47] seduction, we also recognize that Jesus
[38:49] Christ has already overcome it.
[38:52] And by through faith in him, we are more
[38:55] than a match to the devil.
[38:57] And then it says, "And this is the
[38:59] victory that overcometh the world, even
[39:01] our faith." Faith is the victory. Amen.
[39:05] Then he asks the question that to me
[39:06] really get leads us to this answer. Who
[39:08] is he that overcometh the world? But he
[39:10] that believeth that Jesus is the son of
[39:12] God. Where is your secret? Where is the
[39:15] clue? Where's the where's the uh the
[39:17] power that mystery to overcome in the
[39:19] world? Believe it in Jesus Christ. How
[39:22] can I overcome the world? Believe in
[39:23] Jesus Christ. If there's anything that
[39:26] you're wrestling with, anything that
[39:27] you're struggling with, anything that
[39:28] seems seems to be holding you back, the
[39:31] real secret is to feed your faith in
[39:33] Jesus Christ. We don't need a seance. We
[39:36] don't need to rub our hands the right
[39:37] way. We don't need to change our parking
[39:38] spots. What we need to do is we need to
[39:41] dig down deep in the word of God to feed
[39:43] our faith because because faith is the
[39:46] victory.
[39:48] Who is it that overcomes the world? The
[39:50] one that believes in Jesus Christ.
[39:55] This isn't easy
[39:57] belieism. This is the
[39:59] truth. I'll I'll say it this way. The
[40:02] devil is the one that wants to make
[40:05] believing
[40:06] easy and turned it into easy belieism.
[40:09] The devil's also the one that points at
[40:11] your faith and says it's easy belieism.
[40:13] Isn't that something? The devil's the
[40:16] one that created easy belieism so that
[40:18] he could have a scarlet letter to put on
[40:20] people who take God at his word. can
[40:23] have a scarlet letter to put on people
[40:24] who say from now on it's the word and
[40:26] the word only. He could have a bad name
[40:28] to put on believers,
[40:31] a bad stain to put on the message that
[40:33] lifted up only
[40:34] believe. Don't fall for his tricks.
[40:41] It's amazing how
[40:43] they they they build that straw man just
[40:45] to burn him down. But that's not
[40:47] us. Take your stand in the word of God.
[40:52] If if if if you're challenged in your
[40:54] life to whether or not you're a
[40:56] Christian, whether or not you're a
[40:57] believer, you go by your faith in
[40:59] Christ. Go by go by faith. Go by what
[41:02] you believe. If the devil says, "Well,
[41:04] how high do you jump?" Say, "Well, this
[41:05] isn't a bride
[41:07] combine." We're not You don't need
[41:09] metrics on how fast I can run and what
[41:11] my vertical is and how much I can bench
[41:13] press and deadlift. Jesus Christ already
[41:16] did the combine for me.
[41:18] He He's the one that did it all. He's
[41:20] the one that paid the price. I'm I'm I'm
[41:22] with him.
[41:24] 1 John 5 17 to 21. All unrighteousness
[41:28] is sin, and there is a sin not unto
[41:31] death. I know that we visited this last
[41:33] service. We know that whosoever is born
[41:35] of God sinnth
[41:37] not. But he that is begotten of God
[41:39] keepeth himself, and that wicked one
[41:42] toucheth him not. That means you never
[41:45] get sick, right? Never have a moment
[41:47] where you doubt, don't get jealous, you
[41:48] never lose your temper, right? Never
[41:50] gotten angry, right, brother Joshua?
[41:51] Right? I mean, hey, you should see us.
[41:54] We hang out with just even kill, right?
[41:56] Never told a lie. Never made Never said
[41:58] we would be there at 10:30 and showed up
[42:00] late, right? Never forgot an
[42:03] appointment, paid every bill on time.
[42:06] Think of this way that you can begin to
[42:07] paint the picture. When he says that
[42:09] wicked one toucheth not, he has no
[42:11] access to your soul. He has no access to
[42:13] stain your reputation. He before God,
[42:16] you're sealed. The devil can't get
[42:18] there.
[42:21] You've been begotten of God and the
[42:23] wicked one cannot stain you with
[42:25] unbelief. I believe that it is an
[42:28] absolute sure experience that when one
[42:30] is born again, they can't be unborn
[42:32] again. They can't be lost. You cannot be
[42:36] saved and lost in the same state. But
[42:38] yet there is a body that's subject to
[42:40] sin. There is a body that's subject to
[42:42] sickness. What is it? Those are the
[42:43] things that would take place in the
[42:45] spirit. Things that would take place
[42:46] place in our flesh. We can grieve the
[42:48] Holy Spirit is one way we can look at
[42:49] it. In Ephesians
[42:51] 4:30, it says, "And we know that we are
[42:54] of God and the whole world lith in
[42:56] wickedness. And we know that the son of
[42:58] God has come and hath given us an
[43:00] understanding that we may know him that
[43:02] is true and we are in him that is true,
[43:04] even in his son Jesus Christ. This is
[43:07] the true God and eternal life." Little
[43:10] children, keep yourselves from idols.
[43:13] What a commandment to those who are
[43:15] unable to sin. The only sin would be
[43:18] subjecting yourself to that which is
[43:20] powerless.
[43:22] The sin would be to cast aside your
[43:25] protection of the word of
[43:27] God. Whosoever is born of God sinnth
[43:29] not. The devil cannot touch him. So it's
[43:32] only the members that we would yield
[43:34] again to the uh to sin the things that
[43:36] we would yield and forfeit our liberty
[43:39] to. So he says keep yourselves from
[43:41] idols.
[43:46] Romans chapter 4:es 1
[43:49] to8. And from here we just have a couple
[43:51] more
[43:57] scriptures. I think one of the
[44:00] uh I think we should examine this. One
[44:03] of these tropes that's always dragged
[44:04] out there is the habit of a preacher
[44:06] saying in closing and they went, you
[44:09] know, and there's a but is is is there a
[44:12] list of guys that are always violating
[44:14] that principle or is it something that
[44:15] still happens? I don't know. I don't
[44:17] think I do that. I joke about it, but I
[44:19] tell you I'm going all night, baby.
[44:22] Right? I'm just I get I put you under
[44:23] the impression that this is going to be
[44:25] a long one and then all of a sudden
[44:27] stop, right? It's better to stop and
[44:29] keep the people wanting more than to,
[44:31] you know, kind of keep going and going
[44:32] and going and wishing they hadn't
[44:33] stayed. But I only have a few more
[44:35] scriptures. I'll leave it up to you how
[44:37] long it takes. In Romans chapter 4:es 1
[44:40] to8, what shall we say then that Abraham
[44:44] our father as pertaining to the flesh
[44:46] hath found? For if Abraham were
[44:48] justified by works, he he hath whereof
[44:51] to glory, but not before God. For what
[44:54] saith the scripture? Abraham believed
[44:57] God and it was counted unto him for
[45:00] righteousness. So God attributes
[45:03] righteousness to Abraham because of his
[45:05] faith. What's the inversion?
[45:08] Unrighteousness because of
[45:11] anti-faith. Unrighteousness because of
[45:14] unbelief. So when the Bible says you
[45:16] cannot sin, it's not attributed to you.
[45:20] It's not reckoned to you. Now to him
[45:22] that workketh is the
[45:24] reward, not reckoned of grace, but of
[45:28] debt. But to him that workketh not, but
[45:31] believeth on him that justifith the
[45:33] ungodly, his faith is counted for
[45:37] righteousness. If your faith is counted
[45:40] for righteousness or correctness, it
[45:41] means because of faith, sin is not
[45:43] reckoned unto you. It's not counted unto
[45:46] you. Therefore, you're sinless.
[45:49] You cannot sin. there's no sin being
[45:51] attributed to you. And now he quotes
[45:53] Psalms 32, but he says, "Even as David
[45:55] also describeth the blessedness of the
[45:57] man unto whom God imputth righteousness
[45:59] without works, saying, blessed are they
[46:01] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[46:03] sins are covered."
[46:07] Covered. Now, it's not to imply that
[46:09] they're buried or put in the closet like
[46:11] some skeletons and someone can dig them
[46:13] up. They're taken care of. They're
[46:15] remedied. They're gone in the sea of
[46:17] God's forgetfulness. He will not
[46:20] remember
[46:21] them. I still remember the first time I
[46:23] ever heard brother Doug Mchuse tell the
[46:25] story of a young lady who was wrestling
[46:26] with her past a and was trying to tell
[46:29] brother Doug the sins that she had
[46:30] sinned. And he said, "Sister, I tell you
[46:33] right now that if you told God
[46:35] everything that you're talking about,"
[46:36] he'd look in the eye and say, "I don't
[46:37] know what you're talking about."
[46:42] They're covered. So he says, "Blessed is
[46:44] the man to whom the Lord will not impute
[46:47] sin. Sin is gone." You're not a sinner.
[46:51] This is how a Christian cannot sin. This
[46:53] is how a believer cannot sin. Not that
[46:55] you won't make mistakes, but where
[46:57] there's faith, it's that it is against
[47:00] unbelief. It is against sin.
[47:03] Quotes from Psalm 32. If you could just
[47:05] read this, brothers, if you could come
[47:07] to your instruments. Psalms 32:es 1 and
[47:10] two. Blessed is he whose transgression
[47:12] is forgiven and whose sin is
[47:17] covered. Blessed is the man unto whom
[47:19] the Lord imputeth not
[47:22] iniquity. It says in whose spirit there
[47:24] is no
[47:26] guile. This lack of guile in one spirit
[47:28] is you don't have some false estimation
[47:30] about
[47:32] yourself. It's not your own works. It's
[47:34] not your own righteousness. But there's
[47:36] this not this false estimate about
[47:38] yourself nor God.
[47:40] in whom there's no guile. It means
[47:42] you're sincere before God. There's a
[47:44] sincere trust in
[47:46] God. And because you have been honest
[47:49] about yourself and accepted the penalty
[47:52] or accepted the the price paid for your
[47:54] penalty and whose spirit there is no
[47:57] guile. Your sins are
[48:00] forgiven,
[48:02] covered, and sin cannot be imputed to
[48:05] you.
[48:09] In terms of this no false estimation
[48:13] about yourself, I read a statement by CS
[48:15] Lewis recently where he said he said
[48:17] those who do not think of their own sins
[48:19] make up for it by incessantly thinking
[48:22] about the sins of
[48:25] others. We all know who we're talking
[48:26] about, right? That you know that one
[48:30] person we can just think about
[48:31] ourselves. Sometimes the reason why we
[48:33] think incessantly about others mistakes
[48:36] and what they're doing is because we
[48:38] don't want to think about our
[48:40] own one in whom there is no guile. I can
[48:43] say with confidence that if you are of
[48:46] the truth, you're not afraid to come to
[48:48] truth and be examined by that
[48:51] light so that anything that is not right
[48:53] can be made right.
[48:55] [Music]
[49:01] Romans chapter 14:es 22 and
[49:05] 23 he asked now is this is the context
[49:08] of eating uh meats and meats being
[49:10] offensive. So there's a lot of uh very
[49:12] important context to this but yet
[49:14] there's something that he's using a
[49:15] principle that I think we could take uh
[49:18] in itself. Do you have faith? Have it to
[49:21] thyself before
[49:23] God. Have keep that faith between you
[49:26] and the Lord. Don't use your faith as a
[49:29] means of condemning somebody else. If
[49:31] you have faith, that faith, that
[49:32] conviction, that confidence is between
[49:34] you and God. Happy is he that condemnth
[49:36] not himself in that thing which he
[49:39] alloweth. In other words, a person who's
[49:41] free from doubting or a doubting
[49:44] conscience is truly
[49:45] happy. The one that has the conscience
[49:48] that's always doubting, he's the one
[49:49] that's not happy. But happy is the one
[49:51] who's not condemned in the thing that he
[49:53] does because he's always doubting
[49:55] whether it's right. And he that doubtth
[49:58] is damned if he eat, because he eateth
[50:00] not of faith. Truly, this scripture is
[50:02] speaking that you're damned if you do,
[50:04] and you're damned if you don't, if it's
[50:06] not by faith. He that eats not of faith
[50:10] condemns
[50:12] himself. He that does not eat and it's
[50:16] not faith between him and God condemns
[50:18] himself. Because it says, for whatsoever
[50:20] is not of faith is sin.
[50:25] Now this principle
[50:28] is we could say this as a statement on
[50:31] its own. Whatsoever is not of faith is
[50:34] sin. In this context he's saying that
[50:37] unbelief or doubt is what condemns our
[50:39] conscience. And it's in that powerful
[50:41] context as it relates to abstaining from
[50:42] something or and that uh this not not
[50:48] indulging in
[50:50] something or
[50:52] complying or
[50:55] indulging. Neither one of them are he
[50:57] said are wrong to eat. That's not wrong.
[51:00] To not eat that's not wrong. What would
[51:01] be wrong is to act in a way that
[51:03] condemns your conscience.
[51:06] And he uses this principle and and again
[51:08] maybe I'm just kind of pointing to
[51:09] something that merits a lot more
[51:11] discussion or consideration on our part.
[51:14] It really does relate to us as believers
[51:15] and how that we're to live our lives
[51:18] conscious of others and where they are
[51:19] in their walk with
[51:21] God. That is in abstaining from
[51:24] something nor complying with something
[51:26] being wrong. But that that unbelief in
[51:29] itself is anti-faith.
[51:35] Sin is against
[51:41] faith. Whatsoever is unbelief is
[51:47] sin. Whatsoever is anti-faith is
[51:51] sin. Where's the victory?
[51:55] Believing. Why do we go? Why do we get
[51:58] cold? We're not feeding our faith. Why
[52:00] do we find ourselves wrestling in
[52:02] certain situations? we're not trusting.
[52:04] It's okay to have questions. It's just
[52:06] when those questions become uh we use to
[52:09] cast suspicion on
[52:11] God. It's okay when we go through
[52:13] situations that we're not quite sure why
[52:15] and what the outcome is going to be.
[52:17] That those things are going to happen to
[52:18] us. We're even going to make mistakes.
[52:19] We're going to get cold. People will
[52:21] backslide. But ultimately, the sin is in
[52:23] not trusting God.
[52:26] The sin is allowing that to uh bury your
[52:29] faith and tell you that there's nothing
[52:30] to
[52:31] it and to allow an idol of your own
[52:34] imagination to worship that to lift up
[52:38] yourself. Unbelief is
[52:40] anti-faith. And I express this to you
[52:42] tonight. It's in its brevity, its
[52:45] simplicity with a number of
[52:47] scriptures in this thought that Satan is
[52:50] attack wants to attack
[52:53] faith and his works. He's got a number
[52:55] of different works that he's going to
[52:56] use in order to try to erode that faith.
[52:58] God only has one way to build up your
[53:01] faith. One the the that it's through the
[53:03] word of God. That's a multifaceted tool,
[53:06] but it's the word. You hear the word,
[53:09] you receive the word. The word uh
[53:11] empowers you. It strengthens you. It
[53:13] builds you up. Faith cometh by hearing,
[53:15] hearing by the word of God. That's what
[53:17] God wants to do to build your faith in
[53:19] this hour. To overcome everything, to be
[53:21] healed, to to to find answers to life's
[53:25] questions, to get leadership, to uh
[53:27] measure a situation and find out whether
[53:29] or not it's the right thing to do, to
[53:30] even be able to handle the family
[53:32] dynamics. It's all through faith in the
[53:34] word of God that we want to live by. So
[53:37] then Satan's entire agenda, his entire
[53:39] system is to try to attack that
[53:42] dynamic, to try to fight against that so
[53:44] that we can have our own ideas of what
[53:46] we think the word of God is or have our
[53:48] own ideas of what we think God is. To
[53:50] try to build up a Christ that we can
[53:53] worship, but yet have that in a way to
[53:56] try to quiet that condemnation we feel
[53:58] in our
[53:59] [Music]
[54:01] hearts. And if God will allow allow us
[54:04] to maybe on Sunday
[54:07] I I really do want to take some time to
[54:08] look at how Satan has tried to remake
[54:11] faith into something that it's not. And
[54:14] it really is a matter of taking God at
[54:17] his
[54:19] word. Amen. Let's
[54:21] stand like what are you
[54:25] playing? Are you in
[54:27] seat? I think that'll be a nice way to
[54:29] sing. He has forgiven me.
[54:34] It's it's a truth. I was thinking in
[54:37] terms of
[54:38] uh the question we asked on Sunday, what
[54:42] is
[54:43] sin? And and in one sense that you could
[54:47] ask God, what is sin? And he would say,
[54:49] what's
[54:50] sin? Because to him, it's
[54:53] gone. And that's what I want in my life.
[54:56] The believer's victory is found in in
[54:58] believing God. And really one thing I I
[55:01] believe very strongly that our what's
[55:03] one of the things that's connected to
[55:05] the change of our bodies is this
[55:07] continual unfolding of the revelation of
[55:10] justification that the only reason why
[55:12] there's death to this physical body is
[55:14] because of sin. And when we fully
[55:16] understand that you never did it in the
[55:18] first place that you're justified and
[55:20] there's this innocence you realize that
[55:22] even death has no right to you.
[55:26] A lot of power, a lot of deliverance, a
[55:28] lot of victory in that. if we could pray
[55:29] together. Our gracious heavenly father,
[55:31] tonight as we close this service and
[55:34] Lord, just even in the lateness of the
[55:36] hour, my own weariness and things, we
[55:38] may not lead worship for much longer,
[55:40] but Lord, we are thankful that we've had
[55:43] this opportunity to be in your
[55:45] presence. Lord, I I'm grateful for a
[55:47] congregation that listens to the
[55:50] word. They're very welcoming in their
[55:53] spirits. They give me They're very
[55:56] patient, Lord, with my delivery.
[55:59] patient with the way that I am very
[56:02] maybe deliberate and much breath place
[56:06] these scriptures in
[56:08] there. Lord, I I love how they're
[56:11] they're not just catering to the
[56:13] preacher to try to make them feel good
[56:15] with a bunch of shouting and amens.
[56:16] They're processing it. They're thinking
[56:18] about it. They want to catch it. And I
[56:21] believe it's because they did not come
[56:23] to church
[56:24] tonight so that they could get some good
[56:27] out of a Wednesday night and have
[56:29] something to fill their schedule. I
[56:31] believe those who are here tonight are
[56:34] concerned
[56:35] greatly about their personal
[56:38] lives that their families, their wayward
[56:42] loved ones, their future.
[56:46] Lord, they're they're concerned about
[56:47] the atmosphere in their home on a
[56:49] Thursday. That we're not here just to
[56:51] play church. We're not just keeping
[56:53] things together until we have our
[56:55] special meetings and we can hoot and
[56:56] holler and run around for a few days.
[56:59] Lord, they're serious about
[57:01] this. And Lord, I believe the simplicity
[57:04] of the message of the hour is faith and
[57:07] a Christ who's revealed himself again to
[57:10] us. He's being made known through the
[57:13] word of God. He's being made known
[57:15] through by revelation of
[57:19] scripture. And Lord, if there's a way
[57:21] that we could even summarize the message
[57:22] of the hour, I believe it was pointing
[57:24] to
[57:25] Christ. Lord, we can make a lot out of
[57:27] it. There's a lot of ways that we could
[57:29] describe that fingerpointing. There's a
[57:31] lot of ways that we can type it. There's
[57:32] a lot of ways we could emphasize it. But
[57:34] I truly believe in the end it was you
[57:37] getting our attention to take you at
[57:39] your word, to trust you. There's so many
[57:42] voices and so many definitions of Jesus
[57:44] Christ and so many false Christs in
[57:47] simplicity. We were told that you are
[57:49] revealing yourself through your
[57:51] word. That we are to take you at your
[57:53] word. That we can trust
[57:56] Jesus. That we should believe all things
[57:58] are
[57:59] possible. That we are justified by
[58:02] faith. We are sanctified by the
[58:04] truth. that the new birth is the Holy
[58:07] Ghost quickening a gene seed to life in
[58:09] our souls as a seal of our faith.
[58:12] Nothing we worked ourselves into,
[58:13] nothing we beat our chest and convinced
[58:16] you to
[58:17] do. And Lord, no wonder the devil tries
[58:20] to get in the mix of it and befuddle us
[58:23] and confuse us and cause us to
[58:25] misunderstand good teaching or cause it
[58:27] to be taught
[58:29] wrong. And Lord, if it seems like I'm
[58:31] trying to fight a million devils tonight
[58:34] a a and and stand against a billion
[58:36] mistruths, Lord, maybe in some ways I
[58:38] feel the weight of it. But I know where
[58:41] your elect stands. I know your word has
[58:43] victory over every single one of them. I
[58:45] know you're real, Lord. Despite mistakes
[58:47] and wonderings and sicknesses, and
[58:50] sometimes we find ourselves just racked
[58:53] with doubt and anxiety. Lord, we know
[58:55] that when we can see for a moment the
[58:57] light shining, we know there's a real
[59:00] God. We know there's truth. We know
[59:02] there's light. Though we may find
[59:04] ourselves in the shadow, it's only
[59:06] testifying that light is shining. And
[59:08] Lord, we believe in you. And not only do
[59:11] we believe in you, but we believe in
[59:12] your character. We believe in your love.
[59:14] We have a deliberate confidence in you,
[59:16] even if we don't understand your ways,
[59:18] but we trust in your
[59:20] character. We believe that you're a good
[59:22] God.
[59:25] We trust in you, Lord. Bless the
[59:28] faithful that are here tonight. May
[59:31] those who are present in our midst
[59:33] receive a special blessing. Not trying
[59:35] to short change you, Lord. Those who so
[59:37] desire to be here, trying to work every
[59:39] channel to make it work that they can be
[59:41] in the house of the Lord in the midweek
[59:42] and even be locally so they can have
[59:44] more fellowship. Lord, I pray you bless
[59:45] them. Give them the desire of their
[59:48] heart. And I say it without any gile,
[59:50] Lord. if it be that you would put them
[59:52] somewhere else. Give them the desire of
[59:54] their heart that they could be present.
[59:55] They could be
[59:56] laborers. They could be faithful to a
[59:59] body. Lord, make a way for them. That's
[1:00:01] their desire. Lord, I pray you make a
[1:00:04] way. Lord, we love you tonight. We feel
[1:00:07] your presence. We thank you for your
[1:00:08] goodness towards us. We ask all this in
[1:00:11] the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
