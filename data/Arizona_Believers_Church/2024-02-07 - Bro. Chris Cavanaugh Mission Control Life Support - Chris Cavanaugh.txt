TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so I want to just read a quick quote um from the adoption series and brother Rand says this when God in his labor pain was bringing forth um bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or to be that so I understand that like everyone in the room we've got all kinds of different people right so we we read about the spiritual gifts we read about the callings in the church but then there are things that you do in life so a farmer isn't a calling that's in the Bible right it's not something that says you're going to be called to be a farmer and this is what you're going to do although there are farmers in the Bible right right and so mechanics that they're in general I guess they're mechanics actually we'll talk about a little bit about uzzi and and I guess you could say he was mechanical and some of his nature but and you have preachers but which actually that's their job is to be a preacher um we've got Dental people I guess we've got people that do occupational therapy you've got people that are it people which I can't understand that stuff I can't even get like print to to work for me but there's all and you got people that work on feet so podiatrist you got things like that going on you so all kinds of different things that we do and all of those things are are special to each person and the interesting thing is and I'll I'll use Dental because I couldn't be a dental person because I don't want to look in my own mouth much less anybody else's mouth that walks in the door Brother Scott I couldn't be a p atrist cuz I'm out on toe funus like it's I it's not me yeah but I'm a firefighter and then so I see things that other people they just can't handle and I'll give you a quick example I won't go into detail but one time we had an accident up on the i7 and uh there was a it was a group of young people they were probably in their 20s and thankfully no one was majorly hurt and by majorly hurt I mean they were all going to live um one of the guys needed transported to the hospital and he had had a basically a a wound that his scalp he it looked like the you know if you if you play Cowboys in Indians an Indian got him like it just ripped it back well it's it bleeds a lot it looks really bad it's like wow this is horrible but he was well like um well speaking from a medical standpoint and that pretty much they're just going to sew that thing up he he was he was there he never lost Consciousness he just caught something and it ripped him so what happened on this particular evening is that our battalion chief had this brainy idea of like we needed extra hands so he saw some some Wildland firefighters and he said hey you guys come help us on this scene well they're Wildland firefighters we're firefighters they're Wildland firefighters were thinking okay awesome we got some extra hands it was a disaster because the instant that they saw this bleading person they lost it we had people in the highway pan you know just freaking out and now we've got a patient and other patients that we have to deal with and all this so everybody's made different that's the whole part of it right everybody has these different things that they have to do everybody has a different way that they need to go and so everybody's just different and you just settle into what it is that you I mean I don't did when you were a young boy Brother Scott did you want to grow up and be a podiatrist maybe I don't know like you know what you thinking that Dental assist I don't know you lawyer I don't know you know but you settle into those things and you think it's like well I've I've got all this plan or whatever and it's really God's put something into you to be exactly what it is that you're ending up being you've got something already in there to be that and to draw you into that and he's positionally placing you not just with the gifts that we read about in in the scripture or not just with the callings that we read about in the scripture but in all of life he's placing you into something and he's doing that for a particular purpose so as we go along here this evening I I I'm going to do a disclaimer just before I announce my sermon title because um I am not an expert on space travel uh I am not an expert on astronauts uh uh I actually am like pretty much every other American I paid almost no attention to what astronauts were doing until some civilians went into space and then it just triggered something to to go back to the countdown and to look at that and and from then on it's been like okay there's things there and so I'm not an astronaut but anyway this evening we're going to talk about mission control and life support and I I want you to to think of it in this way I'm not talking about life support is and the person is dying but I want you to think of it as life support and is there's a need in life in fact there are many needs in life and the whole Christian experience brother brandom told us the whole Christian experience was to live for others so what you're doing is you're supporting life very good everything that you're doing is to support life so it's not life support in the fact that this person is going to die well it could I mean it could be between life and death but at the same time it may just be that they just need a hand up they just need some support they need something to be there something to help them something to get them through and so that's kind of I want you to have that in the back of your mind and so uh what I wanted to talk about and where I got this idea from is there was a mission called Apollo 13 and the Apollo 13 mission was a mission to the moon and uh some of you may have heard of it and it was called the a Successful Failure and I thought that's not a really good title to me because does that mean they set out to fail and they were successful because they failed like is that a Successful Failure I don't know but what was striking about this particular situation with Apollo 13 is it's a group of three astronauts are sent to go to the the moon they're Apollo 13 there's a bunch of 13s that are associated with this thing and I'm going to go kind of fast because I've got a lot to get through um so everybody thinks this is cursed from the beginning except the astronauts they're like no big deal because they're not superstitious now God's astronauts I would hope we're not superstitious right like fingers crossed nobody's superstitious right right we're not superstitious no we're not okay just making sure so they here they've got this trip to the moon they they go off they take off on a date and the time that they left had added up to 13 there was all kinds of like everything's 13 everything's 13 and so they get into this flight and um they had a couple um problems but one of the things that ends up happening is they go to stir tanks and I'm not going to go into the details of it cuz it just takes too long but they have to stir certain tanks they have hydrogen and oxygen and they have to stir these tanks and when they flip a switch an explosion happens and they realize that they have a problem so if you've ever heard Houston we have a problem that's where it came from and actually the the actually what they did say was Houston we've had a problem but they changed it to Houston we have a problem for poetic license and that's kind of what came into the vernacular because pretty much if you tell anybody Houston we have a problem you know what they're saying right there's a situation so that's where it came from is actually Apollo 13 so now you know that there's a connection between you and what I'm preaching on it's Houston we have a problem yeah so very good they they have a problem and and in this particular problem what they find out is that they've had a a a thing that actually occurred before so there was a situation with some wiring in the in the ship that actually was damaged before they didn't know it they send them up into space and when they flip this switch in other words a trigger there's a trigger that happens they flip that switch and boom something goes goes wrong and now they've got a situation that they have to fix so getting through all the details just really quickly what they find out is they they have an area where they can stay but they can't stay there because they need power and they don't have power because the oxygen that they just lost that was part of what blew out um operates the batteries they got to switch the batteries so they have to go into a capsule that's only designed for two people for a short period of time and now they have to put three people in it and try and get these three people back to Earth so the interesting part about this is they end up with in the capsule that they're supposed to stay in it has Square filters that filter the air for carbon dioxide that we breathe out and they're called scrubber filters and in the thing that they have to go into it has round ones so they have to go from putting a square thing into a round hole and that's the situation and it made me start to think about this because they have a whole team of Engineers Mission Control has got this big group of people you've got a mission Commander you've got all kinds of people they're under the direction they've got all these people working to make sure that something is is those guys are going to stay alive that this we're going to support their mission we're going to make sure this is life support for them right now we have to do everything we can to make sure that they're okay so they're up there with this life support and trying to figure that out and what they're going to do and one of the guys comes and figures out that hey if I take this Square thing and I put this plastic that's up in there and I take some duct tape which is awesome cuz he's got duct tape and and and they put duct tape around it everything's going to be good and they they take a hose and connect it and sure enough they take a square thing and basically put it into a round hole and because they've been able to do this this mission is able to come back and I thought you know that's just like the Lord he puts everything everything that we need brother brandom said everything that we need is in us already so everything that the church needs everything that you individually that you need is in US already so but we aren't aware necessarily of what it is that we need at the time that we need it but at some point in time it becomes known to us what it is what do I need what what is this need that I need to fill and God knows exactly what we have need of so um one of the things if you know from the last time that I um well not the last time but one of the times that I preached is I I um actually gave a little bit of a uh a riddle and if you had asked me years ago if I'd ever do a riddle in church I would have said probably not in fact about 99.99% sure I wouldn't now I'm going to do a second one so for those of you that weren't here the first time I'm going to give you the what the riddle was and this was it was a malleable finite cylindrical coil Rod of parallel axes with as athal terminates now many people know what that is in the in the congregation today right some of you don't so I'm going to give you the answer because this this one's already we've already done this one okay it's a paper clip sounds pretty important but it's just a paperclip so um forgive me if I uh if I if I'm giving you something you know if I'm using a riddle in church it's for a purpose okay so there's there there's a reason behind what I'm doing so uh here's your first clue um this thing or things um has inspired Nations and individuals so it's an inspiration to both Nations and individuals okay so that's your first clue so one of the things that um when I was thinking about the the folks that are on this particular mission is there's a thing called Mission creep and I you know when Reggie was preaching about dragons and ghosts and stuff like that and it's like now I'm going to preach on creepers and it's like so I I didn't want to do Mission creep as my title so so cuz I didn't know how well that would go over um but Mission creep is is basically where a person has a particular position they're they're in a position or something and they in that particular position they they get pretty successful at it and so then they're like hey you know I was pretty good at that I think I'm going to try and my hand at the next thing and it's not that actually their position to do it um but they're like you know I'm going to try it so what here's the definition it says Mission creep is the gradual or incremental expansion of an intervention project or Mission Beyond its original scope Focus or goals a ratchet effect spawned by initial success so things are going good and Mission creep is usually considered undesirable due to how each success breeds more ambitious interventions until a final failure happens stopping the intervention entirely so you have these astronauts and all of a sudden they've got a problem and the problem has to be fixed right you've got no choice you've got to fix the problem and and that's the way it is in life you have problems and you have problems that are going to maybe interfere with your relationship with the Lord or interfere with the people that are sitting next to you or the people in your home uh or people at work you you have these different situations that come up and you've got to deal with these particular situations and I'm thinking well these astronauts everybody had a job right you you've got specific jobs that you're supposed to do one is a payload specialist one is the pilot you know everybody's got a job and everybody at Mission Control everybody's got a job but when you find out that there's a situation that has to be fixed it's not Mission creep to fix the problem okay so let me give you an example of what mission creep is that we would know from the Bible Uzziah he's a king right he's a really good King 16 years old he's made King everything's off to a good start the the Bible said he built all kinds of stuff he builds eloth he he he he's while he's working he's reigning he reigned 50 and2 years in Jerusalem he's what uh he did those things that were right in the sight of the Lord everything is going along good he's seeking the Lord and God makes him Prosper so he's going along uh he you know he fights against the Philistines God helps him there he fights against Arabians God helps him there every time the ammonites are bringing gifts to him his name is spread abroad everything's going good for Uzziah he builds Towers he builds Towers in the desert he builds them in Jerusalem at the corner Gates he's digging Wells he's doing all kinds of things because he's the king he can do a lot of stuff and things are going good he's got a host of fighting men he's got Mighty Men of Valor he has 2600 of those guys and then he's got an army of 37,500 guys that are really good at fighting his army is amazing they it says they made war with Mighty power so they weren't just your average Fighters these were Mighty Fighters so he's he's commanding these armies he's got all these things happening everything's going great he's a guy that is a mechanic actually so he helps to prepare Shields and Spears and helmets and different uh weapons that they do and along the way he um the the scripture says this in um this is be second chronicles um it says he made in Jerusalem engines and invented by cunning men so he puts these into towers and they're shooting arrows and they can shoot great stones with these engines so he's got like there's a lot of stuff going on in his kingdom things are going great but then one day he's like everything's good everything I've done to this point has been awesome I've wiped out my enemies I've dug Wells I've built Towers I've doing this I got guys that listen to me everything I say everybody does everything's going great and then he gets lifted up and because of that he he creeps into somewhere that he shouldn't have and he tries to go into to somewhere else that he shouldn't have and he tries to operate in the office of the priest which wasn't his thing to do he needed to stay on task and on Focus so the interesting thing is here now I'm going to switch this because yeah he he he did Mission creep that's what it was and let's let's say if we we had somebody in a church so and this is not a church anywhere that you know this is just a composite that I'm making up okay so and I don't think it's going to happen here or anything like that but I want to switch this because we've all heard about getting out of our lane and brother brandham talked about it and like you know don't do what Billy Graham does you need to do what you do so we all understand that we all we all know like hey you need to do this but and and brother Manuel was preaching on this with the depression and anxiety and one of the things about depression and anxiety and that is the last place that we should come to get it is church yeah if you're going to have fear the fear shouldn't be in church unless it's fear of the Lord and that fear of the Lord is just an awesome respect to God it shouldn't be placed into the church in church that is something that you're going to get from reading the news or seeing people or something out there that's where the fear comes from right but somewhere along the line people got from church and I'm not saying any specific church I'm not saying anything like that but from church something happened so let me give you an example you have a person in church who say is a Sunday school teacher and they can sing pretty well so then somebody says you know would you be the song leader and they're successful at at at the Sunday school teacher role and they become the song leader and as the song leader they start to you know throw out a few things here and there and look hey you know this is really good brought the Sunday school lessons from the kids put it behind the Pulpit it's coming along pretty good people start to like him and then he feels I'm I'm led to preach why don't you let me preach and so and it's fine has a calling gets up there because you can tell he's got a calling gets up there to preach and then pretty soon he's like you know what I'm pretty good at this I can I got it down like I got it going on here I think I should be the pastor and the only problem is is that he never had a heart for the people so all it was was he was successful at each thing and then you get so successful you're thinking I I should be the pastor and then they start going around you know what you should make me the pastor I'm the guy and you start to try and convince the people and try and make that person the pastor and what ends up happening is now in this church probably a church split but guess what happens somebody in another church hears about what happened and they hear about Mission creep they hear about somebody that got out of their lane and then they're like worried because what if that happens here yeah and so they start to perceive everything that starts to to work in a direction to help them is this could be Mission creep this this person could be getting out of their Lane and in the person's heart all they're really wanting to do is to help somebody they're just there to to to be a support system they're there for life support that's all they're there for they're not actually trying to become the the leader of the group they're doing whatever is necessary for the group to help the group to prosper because that from the message that's what we're supposed to do if there's something that we can do to help others Prosper that's and by Prosper I'm not meaning money I I'm talking about in the Lord prosper in the Lord if there's something that we can do to help somebody Prosper that's what we're to do but what happens is somebody hears that and then they start to get on guard and that on guard starts to to get it and it doesn't just take the person that's the leader it starts to spread to other people and then as it spreads to other people then people think oh this person could be getting out of the line so then pretty soon the deacons are looking for like everybody that's not where they're supposed to be like wait a second are you getting out of your lane like are you a creeper we don't want creepers in our church and pretty soon there's a fear that comes on the people and when that fear comes on the people there's a real situation that you have that you have to deal with because we have a life support issue that we have going on and when you start to put fear into the people then people don't know what to do so not only do they not take so the the places that we talked about here they won't take those places they're afraid to do anything because I could be getting out of my Lane I could be a creeper I don't want to be a creeper as Believers we don't want to be creepers so uh right I think that's true yes sir okay I'm just making sure you don't want to be a creeper so or a dragon or a ghost is right we don't want to be that either want the Holy Ghost though so we're okay with that one so um so I got to thinking about this particular thought and I thought well let's take the other side of this and um start to talk about that one and the other side of it is is that if a person has an issue with Mission creeple there's another thing that that you may need to happen is that in an emergency situation or in a situation where there's someone that can't fulfill the role you may have to step in and do something yourself so you you may be the one that has to step up to the plate and so I was thinking about in in the scripture um that uh well let's just read it in Hebrew Hebrews um 11:32 it says this and what shall I more say for the time would fail to tell fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of jeffa of David also and Samuel and the prophets so the first ones here that we're talking about um are in the Book of Judges and one of the interesting thing about the Book of Judges is that you have all these different ones and we could go into the lives of these different people but here in this particular scripture you you find that that Barack Barack or Barack however you want to say it is is a person that's named as this person of Faith so let's go to um judges the 4th chapter and the 1st through the 6th verse and it says this and the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord when Ehud was dead and the Lord sold them into the hands of jabin king of Canaan that reigned in hazor the captain whose host was CIS which dwelt in herth of the Gentiles and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord for he had 900 Chariots of iron so this is pretty serious like you know this is a day when they didn't have tanks like if you had a chariot of iron that was a serious thing wasn't made out of wood this thing is is built to take care of business so he's got Chariots of iron he's got in 20 years he's he's oppressing the children of Israel and in verse four it says and Deborah A prophetess the wife of lipido she judged Israel at that time so here we have a situation in and now if you know anything about the the israelies or Jews if you want to say if you know anything about it one of the things that they didn't normally have was a woman that was the head of something it just it just wasn't common now in our American history that's fairly common for us now you go back a few you know decades even and it wasn't common right but so for them this was not a common thing so anyways uh so we got Deborah the propheus and she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Rama and bethl and Mount Ephraim and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment and she sent and called Barack the son of abinoam out of Kesh nephal and said unto him hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded saying go and draw toward Mount tabore and take with the 10,000 men of the children of naal and of the children of Zebulon okay so just before I get going here here's your second clue it can stop a weapon of mass destruction okay that's your clue number two so here we have a woman that's now the person that is and I've chosen her for two reasons and I'll I'll tell you that in a moment so we now have a woman that is a propheus um and so propheus is female version of a prophet she can see into the future or see things the Lord reveals to this person what is happening and uh because she can see actually what is taking place just like if we saw Samuel Samuel saw into the future other prophets have seen into the future we we know that um you know Eagles are what we talk about or what we say oh by the way you know that first clue that I gave you that you know nations were inspired and individuals it's not an eagle okay it's not Eagles it's not the Chiefs it's not the Rangers yeah there's none of those right it's not golf in case anybody here is worried about that one and it's not hunting or fishing so just get those out of the way okay but it's not an eagle so but so here you have Deborah that is able to the Lord is able to speak to her she's sitting under a a basically a a a palm tree and she's the one that people are coming to now for advice and Direction because this is the time of the judges when they needed somebody and you would say listen it should have been a man and I'd be like yeah I'm not disagreeing with that statement maybe it should have been a man but the reality was they had Deborah they had somebody that could fulfill this role now one of the reasons I chose her is because right now if youve seen in in contemporary things that's going on there are some religious people that are trying to use this for their political agenda to say look at here's Deborah and so the Lord obviously uh you know he he's more fluid than we think he is and Deborah was not operating as a priest she wasn't going into the temple she was not doing any of the things that that a levite would do she was there to guide an army and was a political and and basically a Warfare figure that was what she was doing so she wasn't out of her Lane because she wasn't doing the office of a priest she was doing something that God required somebody to be able to battle against the enemies that were coming against Israel and she was the one available to do it so she's the one there so she's the one that that that can do these things and so brother brandom said this said and and there's not a lot on her I mean that you're going to find in the message there's just there's just not much but he said a few years before this had been the propheus so he's just talking about the time of the judges and different judges that are going through the propheus Deborah and Barack and how that she had prophesied and told them what to do and it was just exactly right so here's a person that it seems like maybe she shouldn't be the one there but yet the Lord is telling her exactly what to do and what she's doing is exactly right so Barack the great warrior and how that they made a song of the triumph over the enemy but as soon as they got out of the twist right straight back into the rut they went again so for the sake of time I'm not going to go too much into the whole life of what happens there for Deborah so we're almost to burn through our first 30 minutes so we we so I've got another 30 minutes after the first half hour is up so just just saying so but what we take from this is that here's a person who in probably everybody's View at that time maybe shouldn't have been that person but yet the Lord's using her as life support the Lord has placed her into position as life support and cis's got you know 900 iron chariots and Deborah says listen uh you need to um come baric and what I want you to do is grab 10,000 guys and you know the Lord's told me this is how the battle's going to go you need to climb up to mount tabore this is how what you're going to do here's our battle plan everything's going good and the interesting thing is is Barack when he hears this he's like you know what I'm willing to do this but you got to go with me and I want you to see the heart of Deborah because I think it's real important to see what the person's heart is because it's what the person's heart is is where you get out of a lane or stay in one because Deborah's heart was like I'll go with you but if I do this battle is not going to be to your glory it's going to actually fall to a woman and if you read the story a woman I'm not even going to tell you what she does but anyway she knocks off the the the CIS uh uh but Barack has this whole battle and he ends up chasing CIS and he gets into somebody's tent and in the tent you know they're they're dispatched the the person is knocked off and um and you can the story it's it's it's pretty amazing what she's I mean I I just can't even imagine it personally but uh but they're dispatched so taken care of and so I just thought it was real interesting this this is an interesting thing to me is Barack is the one that's mentioned in Hebrews Deborah wasn't and you know Saints a lesson to us sometimes you don't get get credit that's good you're not always going to get credit and the reality is you don't need the credit now now Deborah and and Barack and they wrote a song I mean she got to write her own song and she got a whole a whole chapter singing her song so that was her reward was like she got a whole chapter in the Bible of the song of this battle and everything that happened and what went down but you don't always get the reward that you would expect now I would have I mean I'm thinking if I know this story and I'm the guy writing I'm probably writing about Deborah not Barack but that's not what the Lord did so when we're in a situation where we're the life support for something you may be the person that provides all the support all the direction you may do everything that's necessary for that person you may get zero credit for it and it's just fine exactly because we're not here to take credit for anything the the reality is the only reason that we're gathered in this building is the grace of God there is nothing else that gathered us here but God's grace nothing else because he's chosen you from the very beginning to be a dental assistant or a podiatrist or an IT person or a lawyer or a preacher or whatever it is that you or a janitor or a farmer mechanic I don't whatever you do to make great coffee I mean you know that's to me that's an awesome thing and I'm not even a coffee drinker but you know he's chosen you for these particular things and that's all is Grace so it the credit going to someone doesn't matter and that was one of the things that Uzziah ran into is he started to think I can do more than what I'm doing and he was wanting to take credit for stuff that he shouldn't have done right but in her heart and in Deborah's heart that wasn't the case she was like hey I'll go with you but her intent wasn't going she didn't say coming right out of the gate you know what I'm going to lead this battle you're going to do the fighting but I'm going to be out there in the Forefront everybody's going to know who I am everybody's going to see me that wasn't her heart from the very beginning her heart was to just Lord told me what to do here's what I need to do I'm going to move on and and that's the way she played it Psalms the 20th chapter and the 7th verse says this some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God yes so as Believers we understand this that there are natural things that some people trust in and there are man-made things that some people trust in but if you're placing your trust in either no matter what it is you'll always be disappointed Nature's awesome you know we talk about eagles in message churches a lot you know in fact brings up a good point you know what's interesting about eagles is you can pretty much go to any church it doesn't matter what their belief is their system is if you say bless God brother you're an eagle or bless God sister you're an eagle they say Glory hallelujah amen any message church now if if you say I'm an eagle they like wait a second I don't know about that but you do have a revelation about me and you got it right no matter where you go you can go to the Philippines you can go I don't care where you go Canada doesn't matter you can go to the southern tip of Africa if there's a message believer there I'm an eagle now they might be an African eagle or a Philippine eagle or American bald eagle or a brown you know whatever Eagle there's 60 some varieties of eagles so but it's a universal thing right I'm an eagle everybody's an eagle in my group but they don't always you know they don't always think that you're an eagle and that's one of the interesting things about the way things go is that some at some point in our mindset we have to get off of the idea that I'm the eagle and everybody else is chickens because you're not going to support any any life doing that there's no way to support it you just can't because you're always going to have an attitude it's your heart again right it's the heart of the person and what they're doing okay third clue it can provide sure Direction okay so we three Clues now got two more to go so we're almost we're getting there so um this is going to be a lengthy quote that I'm going to read in fact I have two and they're going to sound very familiar to you but I just to me this really brings out um in in in the life of the Prophet something that I think is a really good lesson for us to learn so um this is from when uh Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes its place it says the house had been full all day and I went out and my little children little Sarah and Rebecca at least this congregation you've heard this just recently so but we're going to repeat it anyway so uh and Rebecca were fighting over some play blocks little Joseph the baby sitting in the floor screaming to the top of his voice wife in the kitchen with her face buried into her hands of weeping and when I finally got the house emptied some in this room and some in that room some in the basement I walked in I thought oh what a confusion she put her arms around me and she said Billy I'm going crazy said I haven't been able to get the children's any dinner and I this is astounding to me in this particular thing that brother Brandon is recounting he says sometimes raging maniacs and saying it reverently so he's trying to say it poly a bunch of sometimes Fanatics so you can't even imagine what it was like in his home running back and forth the house saying the Lord said this and the Lord said if I ain't your manager and the Lord said this and so he's dealing with all these people that are coming through the home and just spouting off just crazy stuff and which he has no revelation of but they have a great revelation of it it's amazing uh how much they really caught this Revelation and he says this now if the Lord wouldn't talk to me about that if he had something to say but you can't help it it's just in the human line and that's what we're always dealing with right it's the human line that we're having to to to get through and she said the children hasn't had anything to eat and I don't know what to do well I thought now there's just one thing to do now I'm tired but I'm going to do this now heavenly father in my heart you help me to to be what you would have me to be on this scene you folks that remember the sermon to help me to be what I would be on this scene and I thought now if I can get just get her quiet so I said Sweetheart would you rush out with me for dinner oh I have to clean up the children and this and that and you could hardly hear yourself think little Joseph just to beat in the floor as hard as he could so I slipped over and I got an apron okay is he getting out of his Lane here because brother Brandon's slipping over and putting on an apron now some of the sisters are saying amen Brothers listen to what he's saying think about that apron right now but in that era of time you have to understand what he's doing because the housewife had a particular role and her role was to take care of the home right to do the dishes you did do certain things and so all of a sudden he's going right out of his laying as a husband and AE of a household in that era of time and I'm putting on an apron right I slipped over and got an apron and put it around me and I began to help her and I said honey you know what I saw the prettiest dress the other day I just so wanted to get it for you and it was in a certain city just here close and we'll go get it and all the time in my heart praying so again where's his heart right cuz it certainly looks like he slipped out of the lane as a husband of of the 50s like what is he doing right you have to understand now I I understand For You Young Folks it's difficult to to to understand what what that era was like but in that era children were seen and and not heard I don't know how many times I heard that growing up children should be seen and not heard nowadays children love to be seen and heard all the time but in that day you did not if you were in a group of adults you you were quiet that was the way it was discipline was a very straight way of doing things the role of of husband and wife was a very set like this was the way it was so now here you see what his heart is cuz he's he's saying all the time in my heart praying Heavenly Father quiet in this dear little woman and I put my hand on her not knowing her not knowing what I was doing I'd say yes honey oh it was beautiful oh Lord quiet in this little woman and just kept on you know her not knowing what was I doing was projecting creating a different atmosphere says so he says this walk in the love of God and have Fellowship so his wife at that moment needed life support right so he had to get out of his Lane of the day he wasn't a creeper do you understand he had to get out of the lane of that day to get into a lane where he could actually help her to get over this particular situation not just her but the whole family because the whole family was in turmoil the house was in turmoil everything is in turmoil all kinds of things are happening right now and this problem needs to be fixed it needs life support and in his heart it wasn't I'm going to put an apron on every day I'm sure sister Brandon would have loved that but that wasn't and he it wasn't like I'm going to take over your job and show you how to do this right he wasn't telling her honey you just don't know what you're doing with the kids let me make dinner I'll show you how to do the dish is I can run this house that wasn't his heart his heart was to step in and support her in her hour of need still being a prophet still having all these other things that he was having to deal with all the you know all the crazy maniac people that were in the house and coming in and saying oh you you're you're Christ you're something and I want to I want to be the guy that manages you know Jesus Christ in the flesh today uh he's dealing with all these different things but he steps out to get into her area to help her to support her now we understand this and I don't know if I said it at the beginning but the Lord will never do anything that's against his word we know that that's right so when Uzziah got out of his Lane he was going against what the word of the Lord was but when Deborah was doing what she was doing she was in the will of God she was still in the lane that that the Lord had created for her she was the one that could do that and brother Brandon's doing the same thing here okay fourth clue it can change technology so this next quote's going to be a little bit lengthy but I I think when we get to the end of it you'll understand why I have this one on here as well so again this is Brother brandom this is what is the works of God he says just reminds me one time I believe it was down in Georgia there was a little lady and it was very crowded in the auditorium this should be a familiar story to everybody and there was a little woman setting on the front seat just a typical little Southern mother and she had compassion on a woman rocking around with a little baby in her arms and there was not even hardly standing room so she thought that's the reason she was feeling so sorry for the little woman and so said the holy spirit said to her go pray for that baby oh she said back ever what was that spoke to me I will not pray for that baby now just to stop there for just a second you know brother brandom said and I I think it bears repeating is that one of the things you don't want to say is I will never do that one one time he's like he saw a woman dancing in the spirit and he said oh that's ridiculous I can't believe it I will never do that if you want to dance in the spirit just say I'll never do it because it could happen to you so don't say I will never do it because you don't know what God has in store for you or what you need so bear in mind at this particular time so and let's put it to to you this way brother random had the most prolific Healing Ministry since the time of Jesus Christ thousands upon thousands are healed of all kinds of manners of diseases dead are raised to life I mean this this hasn't happened in thousands of years so here's this woman she's in a meeting with a man who is known to be throughout the United States and other parts of the world of faith healer is what they called them and has the most prolific Healing Ministry around now I I've run into people personally so this is one of my personal things that you would think that they were the people that walked on water like like they had accomplished so much in their life and it's you know and they they love to tell you about all the things they've accomplished in their life here's someone that's really accomplished something but it's not him because what did he say over and over again I was just there when he came right when he showed up I'm not a faith healer God does the healing I was just there when he showed up I was I just happened to be the one that he used in this situation and that's one of the things that why we can't take credit for this thing because God's just using Uzziah the reason that he had so much success the reason that all those things were working for him is because he kept the Lord at the Forefront he kept his eyes on the Lord and the Lord was giving him success because of that Deborah same situation her eyes were on the Lord the Lord's telling her what to do and that situation is righted in fact they had 40 Years of Peace after she led that battle with with Barack because she had her eyes in the right place and as long as eyes are in the right place they're doing the right thing right so as long as you're there that that right thing is taking place so here's a little woman sitting in the church service with a man praying for the sick and and people being healed of all kinds of cancers and other things all this is happening right now that Mother's holding a prayer card that she just received so she sees that this woman has got a prayer card so not only is she in the service now she's got a prayer card and she's got a good chance of going up there and she said that Mother's holding a prayer card that she just received and brother Brandon will be praying for that baby tonight if it's called in the prayer line so this is the woman's thinking and said I would never go pray for that baby there you go Don't Say Never and the Holy Spirit said go pray for that baby and it kept upon her heart so strong that she couldn't get away from that conviction so after a while she thought well I will give that woman my seat so she can sit down with the baby and that'll give me an opportunity to get it off my mind and so you know it's always best to obey what the holy spirit says do and I think we can say Amen sometimes it's not like Pleasant because it may not be something that you enjoy doing but if you're doing what the Lord is telling you to do it's the right thing to do um lost my place there uh where was I at sorry don't talk back oh don't talk back thank you don't talk back just obedience you might not understand why but do it anyhow if it's the Holy Spirit God is always right yes God's always right right so so then when that little woman passed by again she raised up and said sister pardon me he said I see you've got a sick baby there she said yes it's very bad something and he says I forget what it was wrong with it just at the time now she said it's very ill and said we brought it uh for maybe perhaps that brother Brandon would pray for it and she said I see you're holding a prayer card she said yes I'm hoping that it'll be called in the prayer line tonight and she said honey you got to love Southerners honey would you be seeing that you are a Christian would you just give me the opportunity to relieve my soul of a burden that the Holy Spirit has put upon me she said why go right ahead what is it and she said the Holy Spirit wants me to pray for that baby said would you mind if I just prayed for it to get it off my mind and said I've been watching you for about half an hour said if you'll let me do that I'll give you my seat here and she said why you don't have to give me this seat dear said certainly pray for the baby and the little mother laid her hands on the little baby and she said just a few words of simple pray prayer and she gave her the seat and she went she went up into the balcony so balcony people there you go now unfortunately you're not as good as this balcony because it says maybe something like this around two three balconies high so we've got a ways to go we got two or three more to add on and there was a gentleman up there oh by the way brother Freddy that's our balcony yeah so if you want to sit in the nose bed section that's it it's about 8 inches higher than down here so and there was a gentleman up there who had just seen the lady and said take this seat Well about 5 10 minutes from them I come in and spoke for a few moments and I said we will call the prayer cards now and I I like the way he says I spoke for a few moments because that's what I'm doing I'm speaking for a few moments okay just a few moments and I said we will call the prayer cards now and I said now last night we called at a certain place until T night we'll call at another place and so whatever the Lord put upon my mind where it was and most of you are acquainted with the meeting and that's where I called and it happened to be that little mother was so happy because her baby was about second or third in line so here she is she gets called she's like right at the beginning of the line this is awesome because the people at the start of the line definitely got you know they get the discernment they get they get the full treatment like you might if you're at the end of the line you might just get hey everybody you know here you go we're going to say the prayer of faith amen but this was like you got you're so and so you lived at this place you get the full you know the full in lot is coming and it happened to be that the little mother was so happy because her baby was second or third in line so as she come up before the platform to be prayed for of course the only way I catch it is on tape you see because it's a vision so he's saying here's where he's telling you who's in control who who's the one running this show after it's over I mean that's how I understand it then the holy spirit said to the little woman told her who she was and said you have your baby for a certain cause and that was right and she said but said the baby's already been healed Imagine This the blessing is on the baby and he says there was a little woman that's got a certain colored hair wearing a little Checker dress and said that's her setting up in the balcony this is this is striking to me I yeah I it's it's so you know that's her sitting up in the balcony there she is there's the person sitting in the balcony right there and right up there and the Lord has just healed baby and you see how the Holy Spirit works that woman thought because I was the Evangelist he's the prophet faith healer if you want to say that prolific Ministry but she thought cuz I was the Evangelist oh I had the powers to do the healing well he definitely had power because it was being evidenced right in front of her and had been multiple times over and over again and she thought it should be me but see I couldn't have compassion on that baby like that mother mother could now that mother may have never prayed for another person and another person got healed in her rest of her life but at that moment in time she was the one that the Lord saw fit to step out of her Lane if you want to say she got maybe she didn't have a gift of healing we don't know I I don't know her history anything maybe brother Aon maybe you know I I don't know or brother Freddy I I don't know what her history was but I do know one thing on this particular day it was her that had the compassion that was necessary for that baby's healing because if brother brandom had been the one that was supposed to do it he would have been the one that did it so somebody else stepped into that role for a time for life support that was their job life support so they became that channel just for that moment in time yes and the Lord does this all the time so I want just finish with this and the Holy Spirit Spirit didn't choose for me to pray for the baby it chose the little mother to pray for the baby how about that the Holy Spirit made a choice I've got a Prophet this is a prophet from his birth all these different things have happened to this Prophet you've got a light shining outside his window all these things this preaching these different Revelations are coming I know what he's going to do in the future all these things are going to happen I haven't chose you sis I chose you amen and some people think she got it she was cre a creeper she was getting out of her Lane but she wasn't it was life support that's what she was doing this was life support that was happening right there and God honored and healed that baby and it got absolutely well we received its testimony see it pays to obey what the spirit says do do it quickly amen what the spirit says do do it quickly so just going back to to to kind of the Genesis of this fear gets in the church it shouldn't but because people hear things or they have a perception of something what sometimes we forget is God has placed Us in the position just like kingdoms and rulers and everything else if God's placed somebody in a position to be a deacon or a pastor or whatever God's placed them there and if God wants them out of there God will move them out they don't have to worry about brother Aaron doesn't have to worry about his position as Pastor brother Freddy you don't have to worry because God has placed you there when you're placed in a position don't worry about the position that you've been placed in that somebody's going to take it away you know one of the things that's happened in the message and it's a really sad thing is competition has become a thing yes amen it has become something that has overwhelmed the church yes and this is a contest and in the contest every everybody that enters wins it's amazing it's not a beauty contest where there's first second and third prize if you enter the contest whether you enter late or at the start doesn't come in the middle it doesn't matter everybody wins because all you got to do is finish the race and at the end the prize is exactly the same everybody receives eternal life it's an amazing thing but you wouldn't know in the church that that's the case because there's a competition there's a competition between ministers who's the better Minister how can I preach it better you know you know I need to pull these people cuz people need to understand how good I am at doing this it's like that's wonderful guess what if you're really good at doing that who gave you the gift to begin with yeah right it wasn't you right I don't know maybe they're standing in front of the mirror practicing a lot and getting really good at public speaking me personally I hated public speaking I never thought I would be a public speaker because if there was a part in the play that I had to do in school I took the part where nobody spoke like I was the guy that just moved through but you never know what God's going to place you in so who gave me the ability definitely wasn't me cuz I didn't even want it but there you go it's the Lord that does these things it's the Lord that raises people up and so what the spirit says do do that cuz that's always going to be right with and he'll never go against his word so if you're worried about it check it with the word does this does this take me out where I'm supposed to be is am I a creeper now no just look at the word look in the message if you're worried about it just look in the message but don't be so worried about the fear and and depression and anxiety that might come from people in church because that's not to be there if you're going to get relief from it you should be coming to church that's where you can get relief this is the place to get it from it shouldn't ever be put upon the people number five it can unlock secrets so this is your last clue can unlock secrets so let's just read a quote from the God of this evil age says this and when the entire word of God incomplete was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ and there God made me pay for my sins in him there then he rose me Raised Me Up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil oh if you could only believe what God has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it right but here's a key to what he's saying but if you are seated there yes you will use it for you're ordained to do it yes do what you do so what's he saying look at you're seated there and you don't believe it so some of us have doubt sometimes right and then he also says and you're afraid to move move some of us have fear sometimes sometimes it's ourselves putting the fear on ourselves and sometimes it's other people putting it on us you know it's all satan let's face it right it's all the enemy that does it he's just using you you or or somebody else because he's working through humans right we're not we're not fighting a battle we're fighting against principalities and powers and and spiritual wickedness in high places and there's no higher place than the human heart Saints so that's what we're battling we're not battling the people we understand it's a spirit that's behind it whether it gets on you or it gets on somebody else that gets on you that fear is coming there but I want you to pay really close attention to what brother Ram says but if you're seated there you will use it for you're ordained to do what you do so what's he telling you if you have unbelief sometimes or if you have fear sometimes don't worry because you're ordained to get rid of that at some point in your life it may not be this moment in time when I'm speaking or brother Aaron or brother Freddy or somebody else's but at some point in your life God's going to get a hold of you and the Holy Ghost is going to come and settle upon you and whatever doubt that you have it'll go away and whatever fear that you have that's going to go away as well because that's going to be moved out of the way because God has ordained it to be so do you know what believers do they believe it's an amazing thing it's like who would have thought Believers believe astounding right but that's what we do cuz you're created for that purpose whether you're a farmer or a dental assistant or you're a podiatrist or an IT person or what or your a housewife or whatever you do you were created for that purpose and you orain to it and you can do things that maybe a housewife doesn't normally do so this is a a person remember that story we just read it was a housewife right right not a faith healer right but God placed her and chose her to do what she needed to do for life support and just continuing on with that particular quote and when the entire word of God incomplete was headed up and oh did I repeat that I did sorry skip that one again I need an editor okay so there's going to be a big reveal it's very exciting I'm glad you're sitting down because so did anybody want to offer a guess of what the particular thing or things I was talking about is it's okay you don't have to guess I'm just asking if anybody wants to to to offer a guess so no but that's awesome answer yeah it's definitely an inspiration to Nations and individuals it unlock it does all those things yes no but that's a good answer too you're going to be really disappointed when I tell you what this answer is because those are those are awesome a paper it is it is a paper clip so Brothers if you could open the the thing that says pic on it and just go to the first picture there is suspense now some of these pictures aren't as good as I would have liked to them to be but so you have a paperclip go to the next picture so you can use a paper clip to unlock a diary where secrets are contained yeah so it can unlock Secrets boys don't do that to your sisters or other siblings sisters to sisters or anybody else just stay out of people's Diaries so the purpose of this picture is like so I can use a paperclip to unlock that lock but what works better the thing that was design designed for it so if the thing that's designed for it is there and that's what you have available to you use it but there's a lesson here in in all these things so if you got the thing designed great but if you don't you might need a paper clip go ahead to the next so this is a compass it's actually made with a paper clip take a magnet put it on the tip and we're going to actually show you something in just a little bit here but let's come go to the next slide so would you rather have a compass or a paperclip but the reality is if you're in a pinch and you don't got a compass and you got a paper clip and a magnet you can make one and if you need to find your way North you can find it yeah because it's magnetized to it go on to the next one changing technology right changes technology it's what you do you didn't even know you were changing technology when when you mess with your phone but you're changing technology go ahead to the next one but what works better is the thing that's designed for it but in a pinch guess what I use a paper clip I'll I do because that's what I do go ahead to the next one so this I I don't know if you can tell but that's actually a missile and I'm sorry this is off of YouTube so the picture is not so great go to the next one so this is a man named mcgyver which was a a show taking a paperclip and diffusing a bomb because this is a weapon of mass destruction and yeah he could probably make one too he he made stuff out of a lot of stuff it was amazing but what would work better than that go to the next picture is to actually have the thing that programs the missile to begin with right but in a pinch if I don't have the thing to program it you bet I'm going to disarm it with a paper clip go to the next one so and this one it's used to mark your place and the thing about a paperclip it works great I wouldn't say don't use it for a book but one of the things that's a danger to it is if you have really thin Pages it'll catch and rip those pages so what works better so a bookmarker because it marks your place in history right paper clips Mark your place in history that's what they do they can but a bookmarks better right but doesn't mean you can't use it right uh go to the next one so during World War II a paper clip was a symbol of Norwegian resistance go to the next picture so this is a picture of Norwegian Fighters I could not find a closeup of where you could see a paper clip on them but what they would do is actually clip it to the lapel and what it was a symbol of um was to show that they're they're bound together they're United go to the next one so the Norwegians took this really seriously and this is in Norway that giant paper clip and that's also a paper clip bench and so this is an interesting thing about the paperclip that you see there uh a Norwegian man was credited with having designed the paperclip only the problem was is that he didn't actually Design This paperclip he designed a different paperclip and it was never actually used it was never put into production but because somebody wrote that he was the one that designed it that became actually something that inspired a nation and the the women would wear it as a bracelet spit around their their wrist and in fact not just them but the French did something similar with a paper clip so here it is something that's an inspiration to a nation so the paperclip was designed to hold papers that was its original design and your original design is whatever it is that God has intended for you but in that original design it doesn't mean that you can't do something in a role of life support for the bride it doesn't mean that you can't be life support for your neighbor or for your family now paperclip does a wonderful job of holding a group together and that may be what you do maybe you have no other role but to to hold a group together maybe you're the housewife mother that's holding a group together that's where you really Excel but don't be surprised if God uses you for something else if you could open the next um little folder it'll say video on it so we're coming to a close I know everybody loves to hear that we're almost there I'm into my second half hour sorry we're we're we're but we're almost there so you you almost get to stretch shortly so one of the things that that um I did with this particular thing was actually made a compass and um uh I took um Josh there actually loan me his one of his compasses from his Wildland class and uh so I I tried to make a video I'm hoping it plays if not I'll explain to you if you can just play it and I I don't have a gift of photography for like sister Morgan or some of you other ones so I apologize but this the the one that's spinning here it's a that's the whole paper clip and I'm just marking to where it is and you see how this one so this is an actual compass pointing North you see how this one's already North and it's holding that line now eventually this this one here is going to start affecting it and pulling it but what this is to do is come right back into where it's going to Point North to so this one I had the magnets on for hours this when I put the magnets on for three minutes is that it brother brandom said that we had to be magnetized I want you to think of it this way within your system in your natural system you have blood everybody sees blood it burns it's red right and that red comes from Iron and iron is one of the things that is magnetic and it magnetizes you so we understand that this this um the paper clip which is made out of steel it has iron in it and that's what allows it to be magnetized to something and brother Ram said that we're magnetized by the Holy Ghost and I want you to think of it this way the blood that Jesus shed his natural blood went into the ground but the Holy Ghost token that comes back on you is magnetic because that blood token has the iron in it that's necessary for you to be magnetized to True North and True North is the word and it's always going to pull you to that word um you know what for the sake of time we'll just we'll we'll we'll skip reading the the um the the rest of that but anyways it's going to pull you to the word yes and it will always pull you to that because it's always going to be magnetic true north and the point of that three minute versus all those hours is if you're a person that's just exposed to the Holy Ghost you have the same ability to get swung to the right right direction and to get to the right place as a person that's been under that influence for years because magnetic north and the magnetics of the Holy Ghost work the same way and it's always going to pull you in the right direction so don't be upset if you're young and new and you know the the that experience with God has just started with you that's okay right because what's necessary in you is already there so if the musicians could come what's necessary in you is already there it's all that you need is already there everything just like those astronauts they they didn't even know what they needed but when they needed it there was somebody there to supply Supply the support to bring it out to show them in Mission Control God's in control of all of this that that mission he's on is is to get you to where he had an a mind for you in the very beginning you know brother brandom said he doesn't do it just because he wants to he does it because he said he would he said look at I'm going to make you you know into this bride I'm going to do this I'm going to make you with spot wrinkle and blemish I'm going to bring these things into your Forefront in your life I'm going to get you to where you need to do now he didn't have to do it he chose to do it and he said he would do it and therefore he's going to do it cuz that's what he promised to do and that's what his word promises to do so tonight Saints if you get nothing else out of this just have the idea that God might need you for life support and it might not be don't be afraid of what he's doing or where he's trying to get you to if somebody's put fear or depression or anxiety on you step away from that and understand that God can take you in a direction and he can point you to that true north and he always will point you to True North he'll always get you there amen and so and and just remember you're magnetized to him amen through the blood of Jesus Christ you are magnetized to him and you'll always as Believers you're always going to get there you might have some doubts you might have some fears but at some point you will get there so don't be afraid to pick up what God has for you and use it for his glory god bless you brother Aaron why don't you come please
