[0:00] my title is barriers and boundaries
[0:03] and there's a lot that is weighing in my
[0:07] heart to express on this subject matter
[0:10] and tonight we're just giving an
[0:11] introduction and laying a foundation but
[0:13] there's a lot of different ways that we
[0:15] can express this
[0:16] on barriers and boundaries
[0:19] and i want to approach it very
[0:20] elementary in the word of god just to
[0:22] recognize some characteristics of
[0:24] boundaries so that we can just start
[0:25] thinking along a particular lines and as
[0:28] you have needs in your heart or as you
[0:30] pray and seek the lord throughout the
[0:31] week and as you're praying for our
[0:33] services which i trust that you are and
[0:35] i know that you are because we can sense
[0:36] that pull as we go into the word of god
[0:38] and we sense it in our family that there
[0:41] is a weight there
[0:42] that is impressed upon us for your
[0:44] benefit
[0:45] uh you can be in prayer that god could
[0:47] tailor this for whatever needs you might
[0:49] have in your life whatever situations
[0:51] you're facing so there's a lot of
[0:52] different ways that this word can fit
[0:54] your life but we want to
[0:56] do it very introductory very
[0:58] foundational tonight
[0:59] and so again the subject is
[1:01] titled barriers and boundaries genesis
[1:04] chapter 1 verse 1
[1:06] is thinking of just how much we've used
[1:08] these scriptures in the genesis of this
[1:11] church in the beginning god created the
[1:13] heaven and the earth and the earth was
[1:16] without form and void and so it's a
[1:18] chaotic
[1:19] mesh an amalgamation of just different
[1:21] things and darkness was upon the face of
[1:23] the deep and the water the spirit of god
[1:25] moved upon the face of the waters
[1:28] and god said let there be light and
[1:30] there was light and god saw the light
[1:33] that it was good and god divided the
[1:34] light from the darkness and god called
[1:37] the light day and the darkness he called
[1:39] night and the evening and the morning
[1:40] were the first day
[1:43] and god said let there be a firmament in
[1:44] the midst of the waters and let it
[1:46] divide the waters from the waters now
[1:49] notice in the first day there's a
[1:50] division of light and dark now there's a
[1:52] division
[1:53] among waters and he says and god made
[1:55] the firmament and divided the waters
[1:57] which were under the firmament from the
[1:58] waters which were above the firmament
[2:01] and it was so
[2:02] and god called the firmament heaven and
[2:04] the evening and the morning were the
[2:06] second day god bless you you can be
[2:09] seated
[2:11] notice in this god is
[2:13] dividing things and setting things in
[2:15] their place
[2:17] and arranging the heavens even light and
[2:20] darkness and that's kind of the image
[2:21] that we'd like for you to hold
[2:23] in your in your mind as we approach this
[2:25] subject on barriers and boundaries
[2:27] that's the title um the subject maybe
[2:30] could be amplified in different ways but
[2:31] we're just introducing this tonight
[2:34] and as i've pondered it and as god has
[2:36] weighted me with this i've realized that
[2:39] this subject will uh help us to
[2:42] understand our relationship with god
[2:44] there's principles in this that'll
[2:46] that'll encourage us and liberate us in
[2:49] pursuing
[2:50] god's presence and desiring to see his
[2:52] promises fulfilled in our lives and so
[2:54] there's just a lot that we can gain from
[2:56] looking at this principle that'll
[3:00] ease us into a deeper relationship with
[3:01] the lord and then also there's a lot of
[3:03] ways that looking at this and maybe we
[3:06] could just automatically understand that
[3:08] a better relationship with christ will
[3:11] improve our relationships with each
[3:12] other
[3:14] right i mean wouldn't we agree that if
[3:15] christians are deeply in love with jesus
[3:17] christ that that ought to just translate
[3:20] to a better personal relationships
[3:22] whether it be among one another in the
[3:23] house of god or within our families uh
[3:25] but it also there's principles that help
[3:27] us in personal relationships
[3:29] and and as i have just this liberty
[3:31] tonight to speak uh
[3:34] freely with you and i can just relax
[3:37] i it to
[3:39] begin just to ex
[3:41] in our minds
[3:42] ponder the thought of these principles
[3:45] if you just think about your daily life
[3:47] what you do when you get up in the
[3:48] morning and whatever it is you would set
[3:50] forth to do maybe this is more relevant
[3:52] to us as adults but yet we could put in
[3:54] a language that children could certainly
[3:56] understand but from the very time that
[3:58] you get up you're navigating boundaries
[4:01] and you are respecting certain limits
[4:03] you're abiding by different rules and so
[4:05] our lives can be defined really our
[4:07] lives can be defined by rules and limits
[4:10] and boundaries and these different
[4:11] things
[4:12] and maybe just ways i've just pondered
[4:14] in my mind just ways to express it to
[4:16] you by way of example or analogy that
[4:18] can kind of get you thinking in the
[4:20] sense that we're uh i'm pondering it but
[4:23] after service a lot of our boys like to
[4:25] gather over here on the football field
[4:28] and they like to play a game of football
[4:30] just on this hard concrete parking lot
[4:32] pavement it's a wonder that we haven't
[4:34] set up triage
[4:35] for all the potential bumps and bruises
[4:37] and scrapes but they've done extremely
[4:38] well over the last year and a half in
[4:40] playing football uh fairly injury-free
[4:43] but one of the things that you learn we
[4:45] begin to play football is there has to
[4:46] be boundaries
[4:49] and and it's always interesting find
[4:50] someone who's just playing football for
[4:52] the first time they'll grab the ball
[4:53] just take off any way they want just try
[4:56] not to get tackled like ah well you're
[4:57] out of bounds
[4:59] and so you have to have a boundary you
[5:00] have to have lines and you have to have
[5:02] lines of scrimmage in ways that make
[5:03] sense to relate to certain things oh you
[5:05] can't be across that and you can't go
[5:07] this far you have to catch it before
[5:08] this line or you have to get it across
[5:10] this in order for there to be a
[5:12] touchdown that's that's the sense of
[5:14] boundaries or lines
[5:15] and one thing that can be extremely
[5:17] frustrating is when you're playing a
[5:18] game and you don't understand all the
[5:20] rules but the person you're playing does
[5:22] and the rules are not expressed to you
[5:25] until the moment in which that rule
[5:27] benefits the one who knows the rules the
[5:29] most it's like oh
[5:30] you can't make that move you're like
[5:33] really you made that one earlier oh yeah
[5:35] well i just forgot you're not allowed to
[5:36] make that move and so you want to know
[5:38] the rules you want to know the limits
[5:40] you want to know the boundaries when
[5:41] even when you're just playing a game
[5:42] because it's it's important to succeed
[5:45] to understand what the limits are in
[5:46] order to win the game you want to know
[5:48] what the rules and the boundaries are
[5:50] and one of the examples i was pondering
[5:52] and thinking to today of
[5:54] is that when it comes to just being able
[5:56] to drive a car
[5:58] and to make it from point a to point b
[5:59] and e to legally be able to drive and to
[6:02] safely drive um you have to understand
[6:05] boundaries and recognize signs and know
[6:08] that this is a one-way street that means
[6:09] you don't go the wrong way on this and
[6:11] this is what this light means and this
[6:13] sign and these even these lines in the
[6:15] road
[6:16] i don't know if it's so here and maybe
[6:18] by nod or show of hand you could kind of
[6:20] correct me but in the dallas fort worth
[6:22] area a double line in the hov which
[6:25] elliot calls a hover lane you weren't
[6:26] allowed to cross
[6:28] you couldn't cross a double line so it's
[6:29] signaling to you this is a this is a
[6:31] boundary that if you cross there's
[6:32] consequences i don't know if the double
[6:34] line means the same thing in phoenix
[6:36] ignorance is bliss in my case so don't
[6:38] tell me
[6:39] but there's things that you have to
[6:40] recognize as a boundary as a limit this
[6:43] is something that is set in order to
[6:45] moderate behavior to cause traffic to go
[6:48] a certain direction allow us to drive
[6:50] safely and if someone does not
[6:52] appreciate those or respect those then
[6:54] things can get chaotic
[6:56] and it seems that in the valley here on
[6:59] a regular basis there's a death or
[7:01] terrible accident from wrong-way drivers
[7:04] it seems to be almost
[7:06] endemic to our our area where there's
[7:08] always someone going the wrong way and
[7:10] that that for that to happen
[7:12] even signs or barriers can be confusing
[7:15] our boundaries aren't articulated very
[7:16] clear and you just all it takes is just
[7:18] a simple miss of a sign and you find
[7:20] yourself going the wrong way into
[7:21] traffic and so these are just ways for
[7:24] us to begin to think about the subject
[7:25] matter that i'm presenting to you this
[7:27] evening
[7:28] and in the sense that we've just
[7:29] expressed it let me put it this way it's
[7:31] very difficult to navigate the word of
[7:33] god without understanding boundaries
[7:36] very difficult to fully appreciate and
[7:38] understand the word of god if we do not
[7:40] uh appreciate barriers and know what
[7:42] they are so this is true also when it
[7:44] comes to driving or playing a game or
[7:47] sports or different things in life that
[7:49] have boundaries
[7:50] the same is so about the word of god how
[7:52] can i truly be successful in the word of
[7:54] god or make my way through it and get
[7:56] the full benefit of it if i don't
[7:58] understand boundaries and i'm not able
[8:00] to recognize barriers
[8:02] and really i know this is putting it and
[8:05] and i have the benefit of being able to
[8:06] speak tonight so i can really put it in
[8:08] how a way that uh maybe a suits that way
[8:11] i'm impressed by this but you truly
[8:14] can't even be successful in god's will
[8:16] for your life without understanding
[8:18] boundaries
[8:19] and for some of you might think well
[8:20] that's you're really putting in a weird
[8:21] way well maybe it's semantics maybe it's
[8:24] terminology but i want you to think
[8:25] about it that way we cannot fulfill
[8:27] god's will for our lives without
[8:28] identifying boundaries and also being
[8:30] able to identify barriers
[8:32] and
[8:33] maybe you're already kind of you'll be
[8:35] sensing that i am using them separately
[8:37] barriers and boundaries separately
[8:39] now in genesis chapter one in the
[8:41] beginning god is establishing if we
[8:43] could put this way the bounds of
[8:44] creation he says in the beginning god
[8:47] created the heaven and the earth so we
[8:49] can see these things as coming into
[8:50] existence
[8:52] and then as god as these verses continue
[8:54] to unfold these first eight verses in
[8:56] particular if you read them
[8:58] god is bringing a division and placing
[9:00] where the heavens are where the earth is
[9:03] and and also the elements uh that make
[9:06] up these two uh these two distinct
[9:08] things the heaven and the earth
[9:10] and god is using he's putting in place
[9:13] certain laws
[9:14] um it may not be evident as we read it
[9:16] uh from genesis chapter one but science
[9:18] has examined creation and has been able
[9:21] to very accurately determine that there
[9:23] are laws that bind creation the creation
[9:25] itself is operating by certain rules and
[9:28] there's actually an order or hierarchy
[9:30] even to creation to where science can
[9:32] look at it and even identify
[9:35] what seems to be some sort of scheme of
[9:37] evolution all because of the order and
[9:39] the arrangement of god's creation
[9:42] and so in god in these first few verses
[9:44] that we've read and as these subsequent
[9:46] verses we're going to be reading god is
[9:48] establishing a specific framework that
[9:50] humanity's to exist within
[9:53] and and it just is so this is exactly
[9:55] the way that god arranged it i've heard
[9:57] it said here recently i was listening to
[9:59] something it may have been i'm a song or
[10:02] i may have been reading something and it
[10:03] was expressed well god could have done
[10:04] it this way but he chose to do it that
[10:06] way and i thought well we don't know
[10:08] that he could have done it this way
[10:10] because god does things in such a way to
[10:13] where he's expressing something about
[10:14] his nature and his character so he could
[10:16] say all day long well he could have just
[10:17] done this well we're maybe speculating
[10:20] in terms of what god could have done
[10:21] because there's certain things that god
[10:22] cannot do
[10:23] if that kind of locks you up a little
[10:25] bit he can't lie
[10:26] so there's certain things that god will
[10:28] not do or that he cannot do and so when
[10:30] god is creating he's establishing this
[10:33] framework for us to live in and to uh to
[10:35] is will we well we won't get into it
[10:37] tonight but he expresses to creation
[10:40] of man humanity mankind that this was
[10:43] the realm that they were to exercise
[10:45] dominion within and that they were going
[10:47] to have power over and so god is
[10:49] arranging things and ordering things and
[10:52] it says in first corinthians chapter 14
[10:54] verse 33
[10:56] and i and i for i meant to say it and
[10:59] and i uh forgot so i'll just say it now
[11:02] we were thoroughly blessed this past
[11:04] sunday with the two services that we had
[11:06] i enjoyed having an evening service i
[11:07] thought it was wonderful i enjoyed the
[11:09] word of god as brother jason watkins
[11:11] ministered to us i thought it was could
[11:13] be made applicable wherever we were in
[11:15] our lives and i greatly appreciated that
[11:16] and i i'm very grateful for the ministry
[11:18] that we had this weekend i meant to say
[11:20] that somehow it just popped in my mind
[11:22] just now
[11:23] don't let that stumble you i can
[11:25] multitask
[11:27] but in first corinthians chapter 14
[11:29] verse 33 it says for god is not the
[11:31] author of confusion
[11:33] but of peace that's harmony accord
[11:35] confusion speaks of instability god is
[11:37] not the author of disorder instability
[11:40] but of peace as in all churches of the
[11:42] saints
[11:43] so this is god's inherit character he is
[11:46] not the author he is not the creator he
[11:48] is not the progenitor of confusion but
[11:51] he is the author
[11:52] and the creator of peace where there's
[11:54] harmony and accord where things fit
[11:56] together and are arranged
[11:58] in a harmonious way for a benefit for
[12:01] something beautiful that's what god does
[12:03] but he does not offer confusion
[12:05] now paul is dealing with something in
[12:07] particular here in chapter 14 but let's
[12:10] just take from that a characteristic of
[12:12] god and we see it in genesis chapter one
[12:14] that god brings order out of chaos in
[12:17] the beginning the world was without form
[12:19] and it was without void the earth was
[12:21] and there was darkness and then god's
[12:23] spirit begins to move upon the face of
[12:25] the water so though there was chaos that
[12:28] existed god's spirit moving is now going
[12:30] to arrange things and bring things out
[12:32] of the chaos in the voidness the
[12:35] emptiness the disorder the disconcordant
[12:37] things and the lack of harmony god's
[12:39] spirit is going to bring harmony so god
[12:42] his spirit moves upon something and then
[12:45] it remarkable that god moved upon the
[12:47] face of the waters and he's going to
[12:49] speak and from these dynamics order's
[12:51] going to come
[12:53] because this is god he is the author of
[12:55] peace and not confusion which is
[12:56] instability and disorder so when you see
[12:59] that um that share that brother jason
[13:02] was even talking about how you're
[13:03] supposed to be going one way you're
[13:04] supposed to be in continuity with the
[13:06] spirit it's when we go against that that
[13:08] the billows form and what was it called
[13:09] an instability experiment where it's
[13:12] expressing how things become unstable
[13:14] god doesn't author that you have added
[13:16] the agreed ingredient for instability
[13:20] then just seven verses later in verse 40
[13:22] paul expresses this again let all things
[13:24] be done decently
[13:26] in the right manner let all things be
[13:28] done decently and in order
[13:31] let it have a particular arrangement
[13:32] it's fixed it may have a post it speaks
[13:34] about being at a post or a particular
[13:36] rank uh in a post of duty that
[13:39] everything be done decently and in order
[13:43] why because that's the spirit of god
[13:45] if it says god is not the author of
[13:47] confusion but of peace then paul is
[13:49] saying then we likewise must be
[13:51] expressing this attribute and
[13:52] characteristic even with respect to our
[13:54] church services
[13:56] with respect to church order and the in
[13:58] the operation of gifts as paul is
[13:59] identifying him here things must be done
[14:02] decently in order in order that it might
[14:04] be expressing the spirit of god which
[14:06] itself is orderly which does not offer
[14:09] confusion which does not gender strife
[14:12] and cause things to be out of out of
[14:15] harmony with one another he's saying let
[14:16] us be in our positions and in our place
[14:20] and brother branham addressing a very
[14:22] similar subject matter in greater than
[14:24] solomon is here
[14:25] he says pentecostal people let me say
[14:27] this with love so you know it's going to
[14:28] sting a little bit that's the reason
[14:30] you're not getting anywhere
[14:32] see you've got gifts you baptist the
[14:35] same way now think about this how we
[14:37] talked before about how the power is
[14:39] still in the church but we get out of
[14:40] practice with it
[14:42] and so there's still power but when you
[14:43] don't use it you lose it you forget
[14:45] about it and it's a kind of a similar
[14:46] thing here the gifts that's in the
[14:48] church god give the church the power but
[14:51] he never took it away from the church so
[14:54] there's power available i can show you
[14:56] where he give it to the church you show
[14:57] me where he took it away you've got the
[15:00] power but you don't know how to use it
[15:03] and he says you're not reverent enough
[15:06] this is speaking directly to confusion
[15:08] and disorder and chaos and things just
[15:11] being done to promote themselves
[15:12] especially with the operation of gifts
[15:14] within the pentecostal ranks he said
[15:16] that's the reason you all speaking with
[15:17] tongues you just use it anyway some be
[15:19] speaking in tongues other doing this he
[15:21] says in just like a babylon
[15:24] a babel a confusing thing he says don't
[15:26] do that put those things in their places
[15:30] put all your gifts in there your
[15:31] teachers your apostles and this is a
[15:33] principle that we can apply into any
[15:35] area of our lives
[15:37] put everything in its place and then
[15:39] operate in decency and an order
[15:43] so put everything in its place a place
[15:44] for everything and everything in its
[15:46] place that's the best way to organize
[15:48] it's the best way to keep clean is have
[15:49] a place for everything and then put
[15:51] everything in its place he says put
[15:52] everything in its place and then operate
[15:54] in decency and in order and this is what
[15:56] really drew me to this statement you'll
[15:58] find god is a god of order
[16:01] and he will bring it the right thing up
[16:03] then so god is a god of order god is a
[16:06] god of arrangements he's a god of
[16:07] boundaries he's a god of even
[16:09] limitations
[16:10] he's a god of being able to put things
[16:12] in relation to one another so that they
[16:14] bring out the best in each other that
[16:16] god knows just where to fix something
[16:18] and put it next to something else so
[16:20] that this thing operated in its place uh
[16:22] brings out a benefit and this thing
[16:24] operating it's a place brings out a
[16:25] benefit but them operating in proximity
[16:27] to each other amplify and bring
[16:29] something greater out of it god knows
[16:31] how to do that
[16:32] and there's things that we might be able
[16:33] to do with our gifts and with our
[16:35] talents with our desires and our motives
[16:37] and objectives and there's things that
[16:38] we feel like i can accomplish this i can
[16:40] do this and you can set forth to do that
[16:42] and have some measure of success in it
[16:45] but god can look at and say oh if i can
[16:47] just get you placed here in this right
[16:49] place you can be exponentially more of a
[16:52] benefit and a blessing
[16:54] and we are we are called to to thrive we
[16:56] are called to have a fruitful bow and to
[16:59] live overcoming lives and not just
[17:01] survive and not just be those who are
[17:03] just barely getting by so there's a way
[17:05] that we can live where we're just
[17:07] getting by and we're happy with that
[17:09] right some of us pat ourselves on the
[17:11] back when we just survive
[17:13] just just making it hallelujah brother
[17:15] aaron we're surviving but listen god
[17:18] wants you to be more than a conqueror
[17:21] i mean he wants he wants you to excel
[17:24] above difficulties he wants you to to
[17:26] see things as challenges and overcome in
[17:28] them and be victorious so
[17:30] there is a there is a blessing and
[17:32] there's a praise when we get by there's
[17:34] a blessing and there's a praise when we
[17:36] just eke out a victory but let's build
[17:38] on that victory and go forward to
[17:41] greater victories
[17:43] to overcome things that seem to be
[17:44] insurmountable to to arise above them in
[17:47] a more victorious way because i believe
[17:49] that god wants to place us in our
[17:52] positions and then exercise us in those
[17:54] places so that we can get a hundred
[17:56] percent out of our lives
[17:58] i believe that's what the hour that
[17:59] we're living in is a hundred percent and
[18:01] so god is a god of order and that's what
[18:03] we begin to see unfold in genesis
[18:04] chapter one as we read these first eight
[18:06] verses god is a god of order very
[18:08] meticulous
[18:09] god even in creation just to say in the
[18:12] beginning god created and so we just had
[18:13] we had i just it kind of just allude to
[18:16] everything very quickly there's actually
[18:18] a process where god says i'm going to
[18:19] put this here i'm going to put that
[18:21] there
[18:22] we've even heard it dramatized brother
[18:23] brown talking about how he breaks a
[18:24] little clinker off he says all right go
[18:26] go stop right to a point where god's
[18:29] watching out over these things now verse
[18:31] 9
[18:32] and this is after the the second day it
[18:34] says and god said let the waters under
[18:36] the heaven be gathered together unto one
[18:39] place so now the waters are going to go
[18:41] to one place and let the dry land appear
[18:43] and it was so it this image that strikes
[18:46] the
[18:47] your mind is that there's
[18:48] uh
[18:50] i think you could even look at it in the
[18:51] beginning there was just
[18:53] voidness and there was maybe land and
[18:55] mass and things mixed together even to
[18:57] where some speculate might have been
[18:59] kind of muddy and just a heavy substance
[19:01] but here god is like almost like sifting
[19:03] out and separating land and water in dry
[19:06] land appears
[19:08] it's not covered over with water it's
[19:09] not muddy it's not boggy but dry land
[19:11] appears and every and the water is
[19:13] gathered to one place and god called the
[19:15] dry land earth
[19:17] and the gathering together the water
[19:19] called he sees and god saw that it was
[19:21] good
[19:22] in doing this i want you to catch this
[19:24] at the very beginning and regardless of
[19:26] just how much this dry land and these
[19:28] seas have changed through tectonic
[19:30] shifts and floods and things i want you
[19:32] to recognize that god is putting
[19:34] together the very basic elements of
[19:35] boundaries
[19:37] that god is putting together the
[19:38] elements of borders and so the end and
[19:40] he's putting things in such a way to
[19:42] where they relate to one another so
[19:43] these things this arrangement is
[19:45] essential to life
[19:46] so it's not arbitrary and god god didn't
[19:48] just kind of spin the earth around and
[19:50] kind of see where everything's
[19:51] splattered
[19:52] and say oh we got land here and we got
[19:54] this there no god is doing it to be for
[19:56] essential to life
[19:58] and and just to identify this and
[20:01] if i seem to be
[20:03] if i'm not as uh
[20:05] precise as i should be tonight and it
[20:08] seemed to be
[20:10] and i don't quite convey this to your
[20:11] hearts i i have 100 confidence the holy
[20:14] ghost can just make up the difference
[20:16] but i want to just take a little bit of
[20:17] a shift here because i want you to
[20:19] recognize that in creating and god
[20:20] creates the seas and the dry land god
[20:23] knows he's going to use this
[20:26] so he's very intentional the way that
[20:27] he's arranging these things and these
[20:29] are the elements of borders i don't want
[20:31] to get too deep in this but in exodus
[20:32] chapter 23 verses 30 and 31 by little
[20:36] and little i will drive them out from
[20:37] before thee until thou be increased and
[20:39] inherit the land
[20:41] so this is something god's going to give
[20:43] israel as a possession says and i will
[20:45] set thy bounds from the red sea even
[20:48] under the sea of the philistines and
[20:50] from the desert unto the river
[20:52] for i will deliver the inhabitants of
[20:54] the land into your hand and thou shalt
[20:56] drive them out
[20:58] before thee
[20:59] this is god establishing the borders of
[21:02] israel
[21:03] and in very simple language he's saying
[21:06] i'm i'm going to give you this land to
[21:08] inherit i will set your bounds
[21:11] this is god saying he's going to do it
[21:13] and if you pondered a little bit the
[21:14] whole earth is god's
[21:16] right so the whole world is at god's
[21:19] disposal and god but yet god is not
[21:21] saying to israel
[21:23] that everything is yours i'm going to
[21:24] give everything to you could possess the
[21:26] entirety of it you can have it all but
[21:28] he's telling them that i'm going to set
[21:30] your borders and your boundaries and we
[21:32] could look at him and say well that was
[21:33] very limiting
[21:35] this is a very precise border i mean why
[21:37] didn't he give it to all the way to uh
[21:39] to the himalayas and why didn't he give
[21:41] it all away to this sea and why didn't
[21:42] he give it all the way to the the ocean
[21:44] and give it all the way to this pole or
[21:46] this coast but yet he confines it very
[21:48] narrowly and if you read in other places
[21:50] in numbers 34 there's a lot more detail
[21:53] to it in such a way the precision of the
[21:56] details of this land that god's going to
[21:57] give him when god expresses it through
[22:00] his prophets and it's expressed in the
[22:01] word even in in numbers 34 and ezekiel
[22:04] 47 you can actually outline the borders
[22:07] of israel
[22:08] you say i'm going to go from here to
[22:10] here i'm going to go from here to here
[22:11] and this is how precise god is he's he's
[22:13] a map maker and he's saying these are
[22:16] the bounds these are your boundaries
[22:17] that i'm going to set for israel you
[22:19] even find in the book of joshua i think
[22:21] maybe even around chapter 13. joshua's
[22:23] giving specific divisions within these
[22:25] borders to different tribes
[22:28] he said you're going to have this part
[22:29] and they can look on a map and say this
[22:31] is my boundary this is your boundary
[22:32] this is how far we're going to go this
[22:34] is how far we're going to go and it's
[22:35] all speaking to something that's within
[22:37] god's heart that he looks at the entire
[22:39] earth and instead of telling israel hey
[22:41] now that you're out of egypt you could
[22:43] just have it all and eventually get back
[22:45] over there and take over egypt he set
[22:46] parameters for him
[22:49] and and he never you'll find and maybe
[22:50] get a little bit ahead of myself
[22:52] but god once god is
[22:54] once god gives israel
[22:57] its boundaries
[22:59] he's not directing them to set forth to
[23:01] go out and tear other people's
[23:02] boundaries down
[23:04] he actually tells them to respect the
[23:06] boundaries of edom the different ones as
[23:08] he's passing through like you're to
[23:09] honor this year to respect us i'm giving
[23:11] you land and it never says now that
[23:12] you've got this figured out let's go
[23:14] over here and take care of the syrians
[23:16] and let's go over here and take care of
[23:17] the germans and there was this uh
[23:19] manifest destiny in israel that they
[23:21] were just to increase until they
[23:22] completely took the entire earth and
[23:25] every it was conquered um by god on
[23:28] behalf of israel or by israel on behalf
[23:30] of god we don't find that conquest
[23:33] narrative within the boundaries that god
[23:35] is setting for israel
[23:36] i think in some ways i might i might be
[23:38] given a lot of not that i'm hiding
[23:40] anything but just giving a lot to you to
[23:42] ponder giving a lot away in terms of how
[23:43] god's dealt with me so that says in
[23:46] psalms chapter 33 verses 6 and 7
[23:49] again we're still wanting to bring up on
[23:50] this image of god gathering the seas to
[23:53] one place and the dry land to another
[23:55] this is the word of god
[23:57] now establishing a sea and then creating
[23:59] dry land and then god comes later and
[24:00] tells israel your land is going to be to
[24:02] this sea to this other sea and to this
[24:05] river and you're going to possess this
[24:06] land
[24:07] and psalms 33 verses 6 and 7 by the word
[24:10] of the lord were the heavens made
[24:12] and all the host of them by the breath
[24:14] of his mouth that's how we believe the
[24:16] earth and the the heavens have come into
[24:17] existence by faith we believe that and
[24:19] then verse 7 he gathered the waters of
[24:21] the sea together as a heap he layeth up
[24:23] the depth in storehouses
[24:26] so this is god's word that even lays up
[24:28] the depth of water that would be um
[24:29] subterranean that would be in the uh but
[24:32] beneath the earth it is the word of god
[24:34] i want you to catch in verse six it is
[24:35] the word of god that has done this it's
[24:37] the word of god that has gathered the
[24:39] waters of the sea together as a heap
[24:40] it's the word of god that has gathered
[24:42] together the lands it's the word of god
[24:43] that holds the water beneath it is all
[24:45] by the word of god
[24:47] so god's word when it was spoken
[24:49] separates light from darkness god's word
[24:51] when it was spoken begins to bring land
[24:54] forth out of water and it's the word of
[24:56] god then that established those
[24:58] boundaries it's the word of god that
[24:59] established the bounds of the people of
[25:01] israel it's the word of god that
[25:02] establishes boundaries within creation
[25:05] and it's the word of god that
[25:06] establishes boundaries among his
[25:07] creation
[25:09] so we see it in creation things that are
[25:10] physical but then those of us be in his
[25:13] creation and among his people it's the
[25:15] word of god that establishes boundaries
[25:16] among us
[25:19] i'm very disciplined to use that word
[25:20] because i think it's important to look
[25:22] at it in the context of a boundary
[25:24] so continuing on i think i have it on
[25:26] the slide verse 14. but then as we you
[25:29] could just read how that god then speaks
[25:31] to the earth and the earth is bringing
[25:32] forth grass and herb yielding seed and
[25:34] the fruit tree yielding fruit after its
[25:36] kind the earth brings forth grass the
[25:38] trees bring forth fruit the seed is in
[25:40] itself
[25:41] and god sees that it's good and that's
[25:44] the third day now in the fourth day in
[25:46] verse 14
[25:47] we'll read to verse 19
[25:49] and everyone's happy tonight right
[25:52] so good to see all of you tonight
[25:54] appreciate each one of you miss those
[25:56] that aren't here genesis chapter 1
[25:57] verses 14 to 19 continue on notice how
[26:00] beautiful this is and there's some words
[26:02] he's using here that speak to god's
[26:04] nature and god said let there be lights
[26:07] in the firmament of the heaven to divide
[26:09] the day from the night this is something
[26:11] that god does it divides using lights in
[26:14] the heaven to divide the day from the
[26:15] night and let them be these lights in
[26:18] the heavens let them be for signs and
[26:20] for seasons and for days and years this
[26:22] is god's intent in the beginning
[26:25] that i am not just going to have one
[26:27] endless season or one endless day or one
[26:30] endless time but i'm going to have
[26:31] things that can be set
[26:33] be indicators of signs and seasons in
[26:35] light days and years and let them be for
[26:38] lights in the firmament of heaven to
[26:40] give light upon the earth and it was so
[26:42] so there's intent and purpose to the way
[26:44] god's arranging these things and god
[26:46] made two great lights the greater light
[26:48] to rule now notice the language now you
[26:51] have to divide now you have to rule this
[26:53] is a very important
[26:54] to rule is to set limits and to have
[26:56] boundaries and to enforce order to rule
[26:59] the day and the lesser light to rule the
[27:01] night he made the stars also
[27:05] and god set them in the firmament of the
[27:06] heaven to give light upon the earth and
[27:09] to rule over the day and you could say
[27:11] to rule over the night and to divide the
[27:14] light from the darkness and god saw that
[27:17] it was good and the evening and the
[27:18] morning were the fourth day
[27:21] so god now as moses is writing this
[27:25] narrative of god creating
[27:27] he's speaking
[27:29] and and there's things that's taking
[27:30] place to bring a division and in the
[27:32] division and the creation of lights in
[27:34] the heavens it's to be for sign seasons
[27:37] days and years to be it's to be for
[27:39] light to the earth and they're going to
[27:41] have certain characteristics in order to
[27:43] rule
[27:44] the sun is going to have a particular
[27:45] characteristic to rule the day the moon
[27:47] is going to have a particular
[27:48] characteristic to to rule the night and
[27:50] they're there in order to bring a
[27:51] division from light and darkness
[27:54] and this is very natural this is even
[27:56] very scientific and very
[27:58] uh physical these things that god is
[27:59] doing and so
[28:01] this is god doing this
[28:03] in job chapter 26 verse 10 it says he
[28:05] compasseth the waters with bounds until
[28:08] the day and night come to an end maybe
[28:10] he seems to be somewhat of a cryptic
[28:12] saying by job but he marks out the
[28:14] horizon on the face of the water is for
[28:15] a boundary between light and dark
[28:18] and that's what we see when we look out
[28:20] and we know that the earth isn't flat
[28:22] right
[28:23] you just never know these days ideas
[28:25] that people come up with
[28:27] but we know that the earth is there's
[28:29] curvature to the earth
[28:32] right we believe that here right we
[28:33] believe the earth okay
[28:36] you just never know right captain you've
[28:38] seen it on the you know the earth is
[28:39] around and you're so
[28:41] he's identifying on the horizon that as
[28:43] you look out
[28:45] it's almost as if when we look we can
[28:47] see a division we see sometimes even
[28:48] when the sun is setting what do we think
[28:50] as soon as that sun goes down it starts
[28:52] to get darker we can almost imagine what
[28:55] the whole world is
[28:56] now slipped into darkness because the
[28:58] sun has disappeared but it at that mark
[29:01] is sun it's sunrise to somebody else
[29:04] the setting sun to us is a rising sun to
[29:07] somebody else and this is what job is
[29:09] actually talking about he marks out the
[29:11] horizon on the face of the waters and
[29:12] that's what sets the boundary between
[29:14] light and day
[29:15] and god is doing this in genesis he's
[29:17] saying there's going to be a setting of
[29:19] a sun there's going to be a horizon and
[29:21] this is going to form a distinction and
[29:23] a boundary between night and day and
[29:25] this is how we're going to know when the
[29:26] sun sets when a day is ending when a day
[29:29] is beginning when the sun is rising he
[29:31] marks out the horizon on the face of the
[29:33] waters to be a boundary between light
[29:36] and dark
[29:38] it says in psalm 74 verses 16 and 17
[29:42] the day is thine the night also is thine
[29:45] this is god speaking of god the nature
[29:47] of god the character thou has prepared
[29:49] the light and the sun
[29:51] thou hast set all the borders of the
[29:54] earth thou hast made summer and winter
[29:58] this is god creating
[30:00] and god is not just being random with it
[30:02] and saying all right we're just going to
[30:03] throw my words out into the abyss and
[30:06] then whatever begins to form and
[30:08] whatever begins to coagulate together
[30:09] and whatever begins to take shape that's
[30:11] just the way that it's going to be or
[30:13] some people actually think god is that
[30:15] way he's just kind of arbitrary just
[30:16] kind of throws all our names in the air
[30:18] and god just kind of starts grasping and
[30:19] whatever he grabs and pulls out those
[30:21] are the ones that he's elected and some
[30:22] think that even god spoke and then
[30:25] things just have been colliding ever
[30:26] since he spoke and this is just the
[30:28] randomization of atoms colliding
[30:30] together what we're experiencing today
[30:32] is just the lottery of evolution
[30:34] and but god is not that way he is not
[30:36] off in the distance just watching things
[30:38] collide and everything take place and
[30:40] take shape but he is a god that set the
[30:42] borders of the earth he's a god that
[30:45] made summer in winter he's the one that
[30:47] prepared the light and the sun
[30:50] this is just very simple tonight
[30:52] boundaries are of god
[30:55] it's part of his character it's part of
[30:57] his nature
[30:58] he he
[30:59] god is being very deliberate when he has
[31:01] set things in in motion he says i will
[31:04] let the sun do this to accomplish the
[31:06] person
[31:07] purpose i'll let the light the moon do
[31:09] this to accomplish a purpose and i'll
[31:11] actually allow things to revolve and to
[31:13] move and to orbit in such a way where
[31:15] there's always a boundary always a
[31:17] circuit there's always an order that
[31:19] they follow that can be timed
[31:22] that can be observed
[31:24] and so these are things that are
[31:26] inherent in god's nature he is a
[31:28] boundaries are of god
[31:30] and boundaries in creation and i know
[31:32] i'm doing maybe a very uh simple job of
[31:34] identifying them tonight in these few
[31:37] scriptures
[31:38] but boundaries in creation and god's use
[31:41] of boundaries in creation reflects god's
[31:43] use of boundaries in his word he
[31:46] established him in genesis 1. he never
[31:48] leaves it
[31:49] he doesn't make everything very very
[31:51] strict and in order i'm going to put
[31:52] this here i'm put that there and
[31:54] everything is in its place and
[31:55] everything's in a particular line and
[31:57] you're this seed and you bring forth
[31:58] this way you're that seed you bring
[31:59] forth that way god is establishing
[32:01] certain boundaries in the beginning say
[32:03] you're this stay that way you're that
[32:04] stay that way
[32:06] and god doesn't vary from that
[32:09] as a matter of fact we could say this is
[32:11] genesis is the seed chapter of the bible
[32:13] or the seed book of the bible
[32:15] the
[32:16] from this point on god said these are
[32:18] the boundaries of my word this is what i
[32:20] want you to do and the rest of it is a
[32:22] story of man finding its way beyond
[32:24] those boundaries fighting with those
[32:26] boundaries trying to tear down those
[32:27] boundaries and the consequences when man
[32:29] leaves those boundaries
[32:31] because god is a god of boundaries and
[32:33] then god then establishes this pattern
[32:34] in the beginning
[32:36] and i know you could you could argue
[32:38] that well that you're just being very
[32:39] self-serving brother aaron to use that
[32:41] terminology in that language about the
[32:43] creation story to suit your purpose and
[32:46] speaking about barriers and boundaries
[32:49] and i'd say is it that obvious
[32:53] and i wouldn't argue with it okay but i
[32:55] think we can look at and say yes this
[32:57] these scriptures are speaking to the
[32:59] nature of god to set a boundary the
[33:01] nature of god to establish borders the
[33:03] nature of god to set rules and divisions
[33:05] and limitations uh
[33:07] and do this and do that these are all
[33:09] things that he puts in his word and as
[33:11] god does that in genesis chapter one as
[33:13] it unfolds in the subsequent chapters
[33:15] god maintains this characteristic as a
[33:18] god of order
[33:20] a god of peace he offers peace not
[33:22] confusion he instructs us in the new
[33:24] testament to do everything decently and
[33:26] in order and so these this is a
[33:28] principle that god does not leave when
[33:30] it comes to christianity
[33:33] it is not a principle that god leaves
[33:34] when it comes to his son
[33:36] when christ was on earth there's things
[33:38] that you can recognize in jesus christ
[33:40] and his ministry that god is still very
[33:42] clearly following parameters
[33:45] jesus even goes so far says i don't do
[33:47] anything unless god shows me first
[33:49] do you realize that's jesus christ
[33:51] respecting a boundary
[33:55] now continuing on this this visual image
[33:58] of creation
[34:00] and genesis chapter 1 as we have read
[34:02] these several verses in the message
[34:03] paradox
[34:05] because again that what has really
[34:07] connected these things together for me
[34:09] is god
[34:10] taking the moon i just go ahead and read
[34:12] it again he sets them the sun to rule
[34:15] the day
[34:16] and the moon to rule the night
[34:19] and and it says in verse 18 to rule over
[34:21] the day and to rule over that and to
[34:22] divide the light from the darkness
[34:25] and so these are bounds these are
[34:26] borders these are things that are set in
[34:28] creation so we could use the sun
[34:32] as an example but i want to use
[34:34] i want to use the moon to recognize that
[34:36] in this characterization of the moon
[34:38] that it speaks of boundaries and it
[34:41] speaks of an agent that enforces
[34:43] boundaries
[34:44] in the message paradox this is god's
[34:47] creative hand
[34:49] it says in god brother braham says that
[34:50] god has put the moon over the tides and
[34:53] set the boundaries and they cannot pass
[34:56] that boundary where god draw the line
[34:58] nice
[35:00] and anyone who's been near tidal waters
[35:02] or lived on the coast
[35:03] we can be
[35:04] it maybe it becomes common but i'm
[35:07] amazed at how they can time the tides
[35:10] and just how precise they could be they
[35:12] say oh no you got to just build it to
[35:14] here
[35:15] and they and they know exactly how they
[35:17] need to build it in order to be in
[35:19] harmony with tides
[35:21] with the waters moving in and out and
[35:23] what does it it's the moon
[35:25] it's the position of the moon that is is
[35:27] dictating uh and there's a lot that goes
[35:29] into it but that is just really a
[35:31] simplification of the process that this
[35:33] the moon is ruling over the tides and it
[35:37] sets these boundaries and they cannot
[35:39] pass the waters do not pass that
[35:41] boundary where god draw the line and
[35:42] said see you can come this close but you
[35:45] cannot take the rest of it for i've put
[35:47] my guard over you now we'll get into
[35:49] some other scriptures that brother
[35:51] brahms identifying to where the moon is
[35:53] operating one part and god's word is
[35:55] operating the whole
[35:57] and this is well you can only come that
[35:59] far he says that moon he says millions
[36:01] of miles from the earth i believe it's
[36:02] closer to maybe 300 000 miles
[36:05] from the earth but he says millions of
[36:06] miles from the earth calls to that sea
[36:08] and it sets its boundaries and controls
[36:11] it he says incredible
[36:14] by by god placing the moon where he did
[36:17] it sets boundaries it controls certain
[36:20] things he says it's incredible he's
[36:21] calling it a paradox what is on that
[36:23] moon when just a few miles off the earth
[36:25] all gravitation all air everything else
[36:27] leaves goes out into space where there's
[36:29] not even air for millions and millions
[36:31] and multiplied millions of miles
[36:34] this just this expanse of the universe
[36:36] no oxygen
[36:38] a vacuum but yet the moon is held right
[36:41] there and it controls he says yet it
[36:43] controls it
[36:45] so the moon being tethered to the earth
[36:48] and you could and signs can say well
[36:49] it's it's gravity
[36:51] right just arbitrary right it just
[36:54] happened that way
[36:55] but yet god has arranged these things
[36:58] god has put these things in their places
[37:00] and allowed them to be in a particular
[37:02] way even the size of the moon in
[37:05] relation to the earth is incredible when
[37:06] you look into science and the universe
[37:09] and he says it controls it said you can
[37:12] go so far but you can't go any further
[37:14] for i'm the guard of god i'm the
[37:16] watchdog that sets here you cannot pass
[37:19] these boundaries
[37:22] in a very positive sense
[37:24] the moon is is ordered by god to be a
[37:27] gatekeeper of the tides he is ordered to
[37:29] be he calls it a watchdog that's going
[37:31] to set there and make sure the water
[37:33] moves in a particular way according to
[37:36] certain times so it can accomplish god's
[37:38] will or the ecosystem the purpose of it
[37:40] on earth
[37:42] and so according to genesis chapter one
[37:43] the moon was given was created and made
[37:46] to give light during the night and this
[37:50] moon in its position in relationship to
[37:52] the earth is reflecting the light of the
[37:54] sun
[37:56] and so the sun it being reflected by the
[37:58] moon is what gives us the the light at
[38:00] night and the moon does a tremendous job
[38:03] ex of radiating and expressing
[38:05] and radiating the light of the of the
[38:08] sun to give us light at night now it's
[38:10] not a greater light it's a lesser light
[38:12] so it's not trying to take the place of
[38:14] the sun but the moon is there to give
[38:16] light at night but then we also see that
[38:19] the moon was given for seasons
[38:21] for days and years but then also seasons
[38:24] this is the moon the moon plays this
[38:26] critical role in even the seasons that
[38:29] we experience
[38:31] and i believe it's a full from new moon
[38:33] from moon to new moon this the full
[38:36] phase of a full moon to a new moon takes
[38:39] 29 and a half days
[38:41] i think the the for the the full
[38:43] uh um
[38:44] orbit is around 27 days but for the
[38:47] phase of the moon to go from full moon
[38:50] moon to new moon is 29 and a half days
[38:53] and then you begin to recognize why the
[38:54] hebrews keep a calendar a very strict
[38:56] calendar of 30 days
[38:58] and then in our a gregorian and a
[39:01] calendar it's a little bit different
[39:03] but you can see god said it there that
[39:05] it could actually help us time
[39:07] seasons days and years
[39:10] that's why it's there
[39:12] and brother branham begins to identify
[39:13] something about the moon this nature god
[39:16] put it there and hung it there it wasn't
[39:17] by chance it wasn't this gigantic uh
[39:20] star hurling through the galaxy and it
[39:22] just got too close to the earth kind of
[39:25] kind of got sucked there and it kind of
[39:26] been rounded off over time that's not
[39:28] how it got there but the grab god placed
[39:31] it there and the gravitational pull of
[39:33] the moon actually helps hold the earth
[39:35] in its place
[39:38] by the moon being where it's at and the
[39:40] the the force that it exerts upon the
[39:42] earth it actually holds the earth in its
[39:45] tilt it holds the earth in its place
[39:48] and they speculate and i think they do
[39:50] so uh reason for great reason and maybe
[39:53] i say speculation but uh they have never
[39:55] actually tested it to see whether or not
[39:58] this would actually happen
[40:00] in other words they haven't moved the
[40:01] moon
[40:02] uh
[40:03] the the power of the moon without the
[40:05] moon stabilizing power the earth's tilt
[40:08] would shift
[40:10] and they say well it could shift in such
[40:11] a way to where we have no seasons at all
[40:13] just one season maybe it could be very
[40:15] mild
[40:16] season they speculate but then also
[40:18] it could shift too far to where you have
[40:21] extreme seasons
[40:23] so the moon in its place is what gives
[40:25] makes earth
[40:26] a place of habitation
[40:28] and though there could be a lot of talk
[40:29] of global warming and extreme heat and
[40:32] things getting hot and things getting
[40:33] very cold the tilt of the earth is is
[40:36] moderated and held in place by the by
[40:38] the moon and without the moon we
[40:41] wouldn't have seasons
[40:43] or we would have seasons so extreme that
[40:45] life could not inhabit either too hot or
[40:47] too cold to where life could not inhabit
[40:49] this globe
[40:51] these are things that the moon does this
[40:53] is god's purpose of hanging the moon
[40:55] there and placing in relation to the
[40:56] earth and brother brahms identifying how
[40:58] the moon is important in controlling the
[41:01] tidal waters of the earth
[41:04] and even in controlling the tidal waters
[41:06] of the earth
[41:07] it's vital to the balance of the
[41:08] ecosystem that exists along the coast
[41:11] that exist within the waters without it
[41:13] you wouldn't have a cleaning you
[41:14] wouldn't have a purging without actually
[41:16] tidal waters you wouldn't be able to
[41:17] have the the the life
[41:20] uh the systems of life and the ecosystem
[41:22] that exist within waters
[41:24] some of them would go completely barren
[41:26] there'd be no fish there'd be no
[41:28] uh ecology that could be enjoyed or
[41:30] things that could be taken from the
[41:31] water that man could use these are
[41:33] things that god sets in there and so the
[41:35] moon is vital in establishing and
[41:38] honoring and making boundaries fruitful
[41:42] can you can you catch this
[41:44] god is doing this he's very deliberate
[41:46] is he wanting to see these things
[41:47] expressed in relationships moons stay in
[41:49] your place you've got to stay in your
[41:50] place so that waters can do their job
[41:52] and they got to work with a certain
[41:53] circuitry and everything in its place is
[41:55] operating in such a way to create life
[41:58] on earth
[42:00] it says in proverbs chapter 8 verse 29
[42:02] and brother bam seems to be referring to
[42:04] this verse quite often when he talks
[42:06] about this when he gave
[42:07] when he gave to the sea his decree and
[42:10] who's speaking here his wisdom says i
[42:12] was there when he did this
[42:14] the word of god was there the wisdom of
[42:16] god was there when god created when god
[42:17] formed he was there in the beginning
[42:18] even before there was anything it's this
[42:20] beautiful picture and this chapter about
[42:22] wisdom and he was there wisdom the word
[42:24] of god was there when he gave to the see
[42:26] his decree so he's decreed to the sea
[42:28] that the water should not pass his
[42:30] commandment when he appointed the
[42:32] foundations of the earth
[42:35] what binds it together god's word
[42:38] and science can say oh no no no that's
[42:40] not it what's doing it is the force of
[42:42] the earth's
[42:43] rotation
[42:44] and gravity of the moon and of the sun
[42:46] and all this is actually holding the
[42:48] word and it's the water in its place and
[42:50] that's what keeps the water where it was
[42:52] and so it's science that does it
[42:56] and like well no science is explaining
[42:58] it
[42:59] you're using science doesn't do anything
[43:00] science is explaining it science is
[43:02] telling us how it happened science has
[43:04] broken to god's great laboratory listen
[43:07] don't always be so negative and harsh
[43:09] against science
[43:11] they broke into god's laboratory you
[43:13] could just slow down enough to listen
[43:14] say oh if science is saying that's fact
[43:17] let me filter it through the truth and
[43:18] the word and sometimes you could come
[43:20] away with some really invigorating
[43:22] energizing things because science is
[43:24] just playing with the materials god gave
[43:25] them
[43:26] and so scientists said no no this is
[43:28] actually what do it is this force and
[43:29] that force and this and that and we're
[43:31] like right the word of god
[43:33] because the word of god actually is
[43:35] putting causing things to be and putting
[43:36] them in their place so whatever
[43:37] explanation science wants to give us as
[43:39] to how the waters are staying where they
[43:41] are and it just doesn't flow all over
[43:42] the globe and everything turned upside
[43:44] down in every which way we're saying the
[43:46] word of god told the sea and gave it a
[43:49] decree to not pass this place
[43:52] when he appointed the foundations of the
[43:54] earth this is god's word that did this
[43:57] and the sermons show us the father and
[43:58] it will satisfy us
[44:01] billy graham says look at the world how
[44:03] it folds around
[44:05] every 24 hours it turns like this and
[44:07] every 365 days it goes around the
[44:10] equator
[44:14] i guess
[44:15] there's a lot here that he's alluding to
[44:17] in terms of our circuitry around the sun
[44:20] and then even the rotation
[44:22] the earth itself rotating in a 24-hour
[44:24] period
[44:26] what in the world hold it up there
[44:29] what is it what keeps it there
[44:32] because god said so
[44:35] god said so so it's there
[44:38] god's word put it there and it remains
[44:39] there now science tries to figure out
[44:41] why
[44:42] and they come up with some great
[44:43] explanations right
[44:45] but what put it there
[44:47] god's word did
[44:48] he set the moon yonder and said moon i
[44:51] want you to watch over. now this is god
[44:53] now being very deliberate when he
[44:54] creates earth everything is in its place
[44:57] even the timing of earth to where we can
[44:59] wrote we could time the rotation of the
[45:01] earth
[45:02] and it's 24 hours and then the circuitry
[45:04] around the sun so many days why because
[45:06] god in the beginning timed it it's god's
[45:09] watch it's god's timepiece god timed it
[45:11] put everything in place creation is so
[45:13] remarkable that they can say just all
[45:15] right just wait there's gonna be a
[45:16] meteor shower at a particular time right
[45:18] here where we're standing
[45:20] let's say just wait in so many years
[45:21] you're going to see a comet pass by and
[45:23] they can tell you how long it's going to
[45:25] take to see it again why boundaries
[45:27] powers limits orders cycles seasons all
[45:30] these things put in their place he's
[45:31] appointed the foundations of the earth
[45:33] he's given his commandment that things
[45:34] would be where it is and god said so and
[45:37] he tells the moon watch over so the moon
[45:39] has a responsibility for honoring and
[45:41] watching over being a watchdog over
[45:43] something and it has a responsibility of
[45:46] exerting a force to keep god's word
[45:49] effective or in its place
[45:51] i'm skipping just a little bit on this
[45:53] next slide to this statement
[45:54] brother bam just kind of amplifying a
[45:56] little bit about the the moon he says
[45:58] god said moon you watch
[46:01] and set its boundaries and it can't pass
[46:04] and then notice this god sets his
[46:08] boundaries
[46:11] how do you know your boundary this gets
[46:13] this escalates real quick how do you
[46:14] know your boundary line
[46:16] not setting tonight to make your
[46:18] decision for christ or turn away from
[46:19] him turn away for your last time
[46:24] i thought we were talking about the
[46:25] solar system brother branham
[46:27] moon you watch set its boundary that it
[46:30] can't pass god sets his boundaries
[46:33] god has limits god has boundaries
[46:36] we could argue oh god is long-suffering
[46:38] and god does this and but then god is he
[46:40] brother ramsay's even say listen god is
[46:42] long suffering god is merciful his
[46:44] mercies are renewed every morning but he
[46:46] says there's a boundary line that
[46:47] someone could cross and turn away from
[46:49] christ for the last time
[46:52] that certainly would get our attention
[46:56] actually i i've marveled at as i've
[46:58] pondered this subject and said in this
[47:00] subject for for some time now just how
[47:02] that in one sense and again i just have
[47:04] such liberty to share these things
[47:06] knowing that i i hopefully would have
[47:08] time to amplify it later in one sense
[47:10] god is boundless
[47:13] there's no bounds there's no limps
[47:15] there's no boundaries and there's a way
[47:16] that i want to emphasize it hopefully in
[47:18] the future to look at this boundless god
[47:20] and this limitless aspect but yet
[47:22] somehow god reduces himself and
[47:26] constricts himself but then he's
[47:27] operating this limitless god is
[47:29] operating within a certain capacity to
[47:31] express that limitlessness
[47:34] he has to otherwise we would never
[47:36] fathom him at all
[47:38] do you realize that that where we're
[47:39] existing tonight and where we are today
[47:41] as a people that if god existed in the
[47:43] eternities as an eternal god without
[47:45] bounds and without limitation and yet
[47:47] somehow we came here as we are today
[47:50] unless god would confine himself and
[47:52] restrict himself and operate by certain
[47:54] parameters we would never know him
[47:57] so it's actually his boundaries that
[47:59] make god oh god if he could help me see
[48:02] the love of god that god is actually
[48:04] using boundaries so that we could know
[48:06] him and relate to him
[48:10] god sets his boundaries how do you know
[48:12] your boundary line's not set tonight to
[48:14] make your decision for christ or turn
[48:16] away from him for your last time he says
[48:18] there's a line drawn a plumb line says
[48:20] it again god sets his boundaries god is
[48:24] in his nature
[48:26] can we say a man to boundaries are of
[48:27] god
[48:29] god set his boundaries and we see his
[48:31] boundaries are in nature
[48:33] that god set boundaries in nature for
[48:35] specific purposes
[48:37] then unless there was a particular
[48:38] boundary he had to place the earth here
[48:40] he had to allow the earth to do certain
[48:42] seasons and cycles in order that the sun
[48:44] could provide the appropriate light to
[48:46] earth and there could be the right
[48:48] mixture of oxygen and the right mixture
[48:50] of these things god had to do it in such
[48:51] a way to where life would come forth
[48:55] and things it wasn't just uh
[48:58] it's not in a way of saying it's just
[49:00] survival of the fittest and whoever
[49:02] strongest prevails and
[49:04] and first come first serve and this that
[49:06] and it's not just this anarchy and
[49:09] and might rules right and and all these
[49:11] different ways that we try to conjure up
[49:13] god is a god of order
[49:15] a god of boundaries
[49:17] god is in his nature nature expresses to
[49:19] us order
[49:20] and semblances and arrangements and
[49:23] continuity and circuitry and harmony
[49:25] harmony it's beautiful when you see
[49:26] something even if you use mathematics
[49:29] math is in everything
[49:31] and the way that god has created earth
[49:33] and the and the way that math can i be
[49:36] come up in everything and how you can
[49:37] use math or solve just about any problem
[49:39] don't get scared school kids it's it's
[49:40] okay math is a good thing
[49:42] but it's everywhere when am i ever going
[49:44] to use this use it every day you just
[49:45] don't realize it
[49:46] because it's in there it's part of god's
[49:48] nature it's part of god's program
[49:50] the boundaries are of god
[49:53] in job chapter 38 verses 8 to 11 i have
[49:55] it from the living bible
[49:58] he says this who decreed his job his
[50:01] answer to job where were you
[50:04] and getting job to understand in some
[50:06] way
[50:07] his significance
[50:09] contrasted by his insignificance
[50:12] to understand where his significance is
[50:14] derived
[50:16] and where his limitations are so he
[50:18] could properly understand and give glory
[50:19] to god and recognize himself and value
[50:22] himself in the light of the position he
[50:24] has in god and not in his
[50:26] accomplishments on earth
[50:28] who decreed the boundaries of the seas
[50:30] when they gust from the depths
[50:33] god did
[50:34] who decreed the boundaries of the seas
[50:36] when they gushed forth from the depths
[50:38] and the king james speaks of as one
[50:40] giving birth he says who clothed them
[50:42] with clouds and thick darkness embard
[50:44] them by limiting their shores
[50:47] and said thus far and no farther shall
[50:50] you come and here shall your proud wave
[50:52] stop
[50:54] who does that god does
[50:57] he didn't tell the waves well if you're
[50:58] strong enough and you could do it just
[50:59] take over didn't tell the winds if
[51:00] you're strong enough you can do it just
[51:01] take over you didn't tell the sun if
[51:03] you're strong enough you could do it
[51:04] take over god set things decreed the
[51:05] boundaries of the seas it says and he
[51:07] barred them by limiting their shores
[51:11] barred them
[51:12] you can go thus far and no farther shall
[51:14] you come this is god that's now speaking
[51:16] it's god that's established god is a god
[51:19] of boundaries
[51:22] god expresses in his creation
[51:24] by his own word setting up boundaries
[51:28] for those of you taking notes and being
[51:30] very astute to consider our subject you
[51:32] might recall that the title was
[51:35] barriers and boundaries
[51:37] and to this point you might be wondering
[51:39] well are they one and the same are we
[51:40] talking about the same thing when are
[51:41] you going to talk about barriers
[51:44] but i'm using this language and i
[51:45] realize it could just be terminology and
[51:48] you may use something different you
[51:49] might borders boundaries barriers and uh
[51:51] whatever you might want to come up with
[51:53] it's just a it's just a language we get
[51:54] on the same page using this terminology
[51:57] so that the truth can be conveyed to you
[51:59] not that we would walk away from here
[52:00] saying now you realize there's a
[52:01] doctrine of barriers and we got to get
[52:03] that right
[52:04] i'll just catch the truth the truth that
[52:06] i'm trying to express to the principle
[52:08] and a barrier is i'm using it in
[52:11] boundary i'm recognizing as two
[52:12] different things
[52:14] and it's important in the context that i
[52:16] will place it in
[52:18] to recognize the difference i'm just
[52:20] going to share some very succinct short
[52:22] definitions to you as i'm closing
[52:24] tonight
[52:26] and i'll pick up on these later
[52:28] a boundary indicates the limits of
[52:30] something
[52:32] so a boundary is a limit of something
[52:35] as a scripture saying you can only go so
[52:37] far
[52:38] that's a limit
[52:39] that's a boundary
[52:41] to decree something and say i'm going to
[52:42] let you go here but you're going to have
[52:44] to stop you can't go any further
[52:46] god taking children of israel and saying
[52:48] i'm going to the land we get it all we
[52:50] get it all do we get mount everest do we
[52:52] get russia do we get china do we get
[52:54] japan oh do we get it no no no no i'm
[52:56] going to limit you
[52:58] a boundary indicates the limits of
[52:59] something a boundary is a dividing line
[53:02] we recognize a it's a boundaries a
[53:04] dividing line between two things and
[53:06] then a boundary can also express the
[53:08] furthest point of something
[53:11] to what from one boundary to another in
[53:13] america we say from sea to shining sea
[53:15] what have we established east and
[53:17] western boundaries
[53:19] the furthest point the furthest stretch
[53:21] of these contiguous states of the uh
[53:24] of america that this from seed to
[53:26] shining seed that this establishes a
[53:27] border it establishes a boundary that's
[53:29] what a boundary is
[53:32] think of it indicates the limits of
[53:33] something it's a dividing line it marks
[53:36] the furthest point that's a boundary but
[53:38] a barrier
[53:39] is something that it strucks
[53:42] a barrier is an obstacle
[53:44] a barrier is something that would block
[53:46] an entrance to something
[53:49] in that simple way it's easy to see a
[53:51] difference between a barrier and a
[53:52] boundary
[53:54] you could have in the united states you
[53:55] could have from sea to shining sea
[53:58] there's from border to border here's our
[53:59] borders here's our boundaries these are
[54:01] the bounds of these these united states
[54:03] but then if you're trying to get from
[54:05] one side to another you may you may come
[54:07] up against a barrier called the rocky
[54:08] mountains
[54:10] so i want to go from one side to another
[54:11] see well that's within your limits
[54:13] that's within your rights this is
[54:14] something this is indicates the furthest
[54:16] point this indicates the limits of
[54:18] something you're within your rights
[54:19] within your limits but yet there can be
[54:21] a barrier to it
[54:22] a barrier is an obstacle
[54:25] a bear is something that obstructs an
[54:27] entrance it's something that's available
[54:29] and if i could put it this way and i
[54:30] think this will just help us to sum it
[54:31] up
[54:33] and i'll have my introduction my
[54:34] foundation laid god uses boundaries
[54:36] satan uses barriers
[54:40] god is a god of boundaries
[54:42] satan is one of uh barriers
[54:47] he said well god does have limits
[54:49] right
[54:51] he has and and
[54:53] he has he has something he just said in
[54:55] his word
[54:56] and we begin to see these parameters
[54:58] that god says he gives us a commandment
[55:00] to baptize but he doesn't just say hey
[55:02] as long as you get wet
[55:04] right
[55:05] there's a boundary
[55:07] there there's something that is to be
[55:09] observed god is one that sets boundaries
[55:11] he's one that indicates the furthest
[55:13] point of something but satan is not one
[55:15] that honors boundaries nor is he one
[55:17] that has the right to set boundaries
[55:19] satan can only use barriers
[55:24] and let me express it to you this way
[55:26] and i think this will um
[55:28] this will be a way of
[55:30] sharing it with you that it can be
[55:32] applicable in your lives immediately
[55:35] some of us see a boundary
[55:37] and mistake it for a barrier
[55:39] and want to blow right through it
[55:43] it's actually a boundary it's a limit
[55:45] it's the furthest point it's something
[55:47] god said we see it as a barrier and we
[55:49] want to tear it down
[55:51] we want to go past it we could even
[55:53] sense resistance we could sense oh maybe
[55:55] this shouldn't happen or maybe this
[55:56] shouldn't be done or uh we're sensing
[55:59] but in our minds
[56:00] and i was having this conversation with
[56:02] the brother this week on how sometimes
[56:04] people do things in faith but really uh
[56:07] uh really what they're doing is they're
[56:08] just faking it
[56:11] and they really don't have the faith and
[56:13] they're setting forth to do something
[56:14] and just
[56:15] they're really in now they're really
[56:16] just trying to make something up and
[56:17] they're really not operating with
[56:18] perfect faith they're just pretending
[56:20] and it's all pretense it's not really
[56:22] faith and we have to be very careful
[56:23] that when we see something and we
[56:25] recognize that there's some kind of
[56:27] something limiting something obstructing
[56:28] we say oh oh that's just a barrier i'm
[56:31] just going to push that down i'm just
[56:32] going to get that out of the way you
[56:34] better be better be careful that may be
[56:35] god's boundary
[56:38] we might be sensing that and feeling
[56:40] that and we might have some sort of
[56:41] discomfort we might be recognizing them
[56:43] we just wanna say well bless god let's
[56:44] just plow right through it let's just
[56:46] mull that down let's just get through
[56:47] that by the by the the grace of god
[56:49] we're just gonna tunnel right through
[56:50] and say hold on god set a boundary
[56:53] could you imagine if moses said well
[56:55] god's already given us this land let's
[56:56] go get the other land that's ours let's
[56:58] we can take that later but let's go over
[57:00] here and get this there's a lot of oil
[57:01] out down here in saudi arabia there's a
[57:03] lot of a lot of silk over here in china
[57:05] and they're just going to go out on this
[57:06] conquest to get everything else and god
[57:08] wait a minute when i gave you the
[57:09] borders that was for a reason
[57:14] sometimes we see a boundary we think
[57:16] it's a barrier and we want to tear it
[57:17] down
[57:19] let's just let's just invert take that
[57:20] the opposite
[57:22] sometimes we see a
[57:24] we see a barrier
[57:26] and we think it's a boundary
[57:29] and what satan's trying to do is limit
[57:30] you
[57:32] obstruct you and keep you from fully
[57:34] possessing all the bounds of god's word
[57:36] now can you see why it'd be very
[57:38] important to be able to recognize the
[57:39] difference between a barrier and a
[57:40] boundary
[57:41] god's telling you on one hand it's not
[57:43] yours to take
[57:45] that's a boundary
[57:46] you want to respect that
[57:48] but on the other hand
[57:50] the devil's saying stop you can't have
[57:51] it
[57:52] that's a barrier
[57:54] you want to move past that
[57:57] in the masterpiece brother rams about
[57:58] the masterpiece family in the garden of
[58:00] eden so we could continue to read
[58:02] genesis chapter one we'd find that god
[58:03] created man and he placed them he set
[58:05] them there in the garden
[58:07] brother man called it a masterpiece
[58:09] family how beautiful it was he says the
[58:11] masterpiece was walled by the word god's
[58:14] word
[58:16] walled
[58:17] marked off in other words god's word
[58:19] formed a boundary
[58:21] there was a very literal boundary
[58:24] that god placed adam and the woman
[58:26] within
[58:28] and one sense you could say that it was
[58:29] a word boundary that they were to honor
[58:31] and observe rules that applied to the
[58:33] eating and partaking of something
[58:35] but it's very very vast and very
[58:37] beautiful when you look at even how god
[58:39] created the garden within eden and the
[58:41] symmetry and the location
[58:43] and the way that he would have arranged
[58:44] it but in this very real sense there
[58:47] might not be a literal wall that eve
[58:49] could have went up to and oh wow look at
[58:51] this
[58:52] and observe the beauty and the grandeur
[58:54] of a physical wall but there is a
[58:56] literal wall a boundary parameters
[58:58] limits
[59:00] right isn't that what walls
[59:01] ex mark out
[59:03] that's why you know that we we have
[59:05] walls we have borders we have boundaries
[59:07] they have physical bear uh boundaries
[59:09] that are marked as barriers to keep
[59:11] people within certain confines because
[59:13] it's marking out space
[59:16] he says the masterpiece was walled by
[59:18] the word god's word and the masterpiece
[59:20] itself of the family the masterpiece
[59:21] family was fortified by this word
[59:25] so now if we begin to think of god in
[59:27] terms of boundaries a lot of times what
[59:29] if we're negative or we always see the
[59:30] glass half full then what we begin to
[59:32] think is ah well this just limits me i
[59:34] can't do this i can't do that but listen
[59:36] the boundary becomes fortification
[59:39] it's not so much to keep you from going
[59:42] so far it's to keep other things from
[59:43] coming in
[59:45] the boundaries aren't necessarily just
[59:46] something to limit you but rather to
[59:48] fortify you to give you strength the
[59:50] masterpiece family's walled within
[59:52] certain boundaries and parameters and
[59:54] that is her fortification he says but
[59:56] the broken part speaks to the woman that
[59:57] was broke off the original the woman
[59:59] went out beyond that wall
[1:00:03] god set a boundary
[1:00:05] and the woman eased around that boundary
[1:00:08] she stepped over that boundary and as
[1:00:11] soon as she went beyond the boundary it
[1:00:13] gave satan a chance to mar creation
[1:00:17] he says it will not be on that wall it
[1:00:18] gives satan a chance to mar it
[1:00:21] the masterpiece family
[1:00:23] properly placed within the borders
[1:00:25] within the boundaries of god's word
[1:00:28] remain there safe
[1:00:31] but it's not until the woman went beyond
[1:00:33] the boundary that satan had a chance to
[1:00:34] mar her
[1:00:36] he could always just look in
[1:00:38] and so what would be his goal right just
[1:00:40] kind of look
[1:00:41] he wants you to move the boundary
[1:00:44] you know if you just you can actually
[1:00:45] come this way a little bit
[1:00:47] oh yeah
[1:00:48] by all means please
[1:00:50] right the devil's saying if the devil
[1:00:51] ever tells you
[1:00:53] after you
[1:00:54] right
[1:00:56] stop turn around go different door you
[1:00:57] know find another way to go because if
[1:00:59] the devil wants to get after you there's
[1:01:01] a catch
[1:01:02] and so satan will make it seem as oh no
[1:01:04] by all means please do this but what's
[1:01:06] he trying to do get you to go beyond the
[1:01:07] limits of something
[1:01:10] i've i've studied the message of the
[1:01:11] hour i think i've read every place where
[1:01:13] brother brown says boundaries boundary
[1:01:15] reading through all the places brother
[1:01:16] bam talks about barriers to understand
[1:01:18] how brother brown used this vernacular
[1:01:20] this terminology with respect to the
[1:01:22] word of god and i can say very very uh
[1:01:25] with great confidence today god has a
[1:01:27] boundary and satan's always trying to
[1:01:29] obscure it
[1:01:32] he's always trying to block it
[1:01:34] trying to get you to go beyond it and as
[1:01:36] long as you stay within the boundaries
[1:01:37] of god's word you're in a place that god
[1:01:39] can bless you
[1:01:42] but when god's boundaries are violated
[1:01:44] we leave this place of safety
[1:01:47] when boundaries are violated we leave a
[1:01:49] place of peace
[1:01:52] wait we're removing ourselves from the
[1:01:53] place because this is where you'll
[1:01:54] thrive this is where you'll grow this is
[1:01:55] how you can grow this is how you can
[1:01:57] live this is how you can live as an
[1:01:59] overcomer this is where my my power is
[1:02:01] available to you perfectly and the
[1:02:03] satan's job then is to violate
[1:02:05] boundaries and tear things down and to
[1:02:06] obscure the truth and to put us in a
[1:02:08] place where we're no longer in that zone
[1:02:10] that god can bless us in
[1:02:12] it's when we leave boundaries when
[1:02:14] boundaries are tore down and boundaries
[1:02:16] are violated this is a rich language
[1:02:17] that you could search through scripture
[1:02:18] and find that there's many different
[1:02:20] applications and support for this
[1:02:22] let's begin to ponder them ourselves as
[1:02:24] a church
[1:02:26] what it means to have boundaries with
[1:02:27] respect to the word of god what it would
[1:02:29] mean to have boundaries within the
[1:02:30] church of god
[1:02:31] why do we have boundaries when it comes
[1:02:33] to how service operates for a reason
[1:02:35] why would we have boundaries within uh
[1:02:37] within the church of god in terms of
[1:02:39] offices and who can serve in those
[1:02:40] offices and what gifts are expressed
[1:02:42] it's not because it's barriers to you
[1:02:44] being a christian
[1:02:46] it's boundaries to the word of god
[1:02:47] having preeminence
[1:02:52] brother mike if you could come by the
[1:02:53] michael tube
[1:02:54] i want to close with this statement
[1:02:58] but the man says for instance
[1:03:00] the moon if the moon would ever move out
[1:03:02] of its place the earth would be filled
[1:03:03] with water in a few moments
[1:03:06] the moon is rather like a watchdog of
[1:03:08] the sea
[1:03:09] he said it's bounds that it can't pass
[1:03:12] now this is this is going to take a
[1:03:14] different turn i think in the way that
[1:03:15] he expresses it
[1:03:17] and it's um
[1:03:24] i hope that you can um
[1:03:26] see the see it in the thought of
[1:03:27] barriers and boundaries because brother
[1:03:29] brown's using the moon being its
[1:03:30] position and when the moon turns from
[1:03:32] the earth here comes the tides and if
[1:03:34] the moon didn't catch it around the
[1:03:35] other side it would cover the earth so
[1:03:37] the moon stops and he turns his back to
[1:03:39] look around the other side of the world
[1:03:41] he's kind of just describing maybe in a
[1:03:43] storytelling way of how the moon in its
[1:03:46] rotation the earth and its and and how
[1:03:48] these things are working
[1:03:50] uh how they work together to where we're
[1:03:52] always seeing
[1:03:54] this one side he says here comes the
[1:03:56] waters coming in real fast
[1:03:58] and then he turns again
[1:04:00] he is jehovah's servant
[1:04:03] c stops and goes back to its place
[1:04:05] because it sees the perfect moving of
[1:04:06] jehovah
[1:04:08] this is something that's evident in
[1:04:10] creation
[1:04:11] the perfect moving of jehovah
[1:04:13] brother graham's identifying entitled
[1:04:15] waves and tidal waters and the ebbs and
[1:04:17] flows of rivers and tributaries and
[1:04:19] oceans
[1:04:21] and how the moon doing its part and each
[1:04:23] one of these things that god has said in
[1:04:25] creation he says it's the perfect moving
[1:04:27] of jehovah
[1:04:30] and what is what are they operating
[1:04:32] within their line
[1:04:33] they're operating within their
[1:04:36] uh
[1:04:37] within their order
[1:04:39] he says oh
[1:04:41] if we in the church as the members of
[1:04:43] the body of christ
[1:04:44] could only work in harmony like that
[1:04:48] you would say a great and mighty church
[1:04:50] of the living god
[1:04:51] all in one array filled with the holy
[1:04:54] spirit he says wouldn't it be wonderful
[1:04:57] every member of the body functioning
[1:04:58] just exactly to its place
[1:05:01] every member of the body functioning
[1:05:03] just exactly to its place remember every
[1:05:05] measure
[1:05:06] every part every gift to its place every
[1:05:09] gift helping the other every every
[1:05:12] member helping the other that would be
[1:05:14] wonderful that's what we want to see
[1:05:18] now in reading that
[1:05:21] we could read it and say oh the shackles
[1:05:23] are off i've been loosed
[1:05:24] let me operate
[1:05:26] let me let me do this let me do what i'm
[1:05:28] good at let me let me uh i want to be a
[1:05:31] blessing i oh every member of the body
[1:05:33] using every gift and helping in every
[1:05:35] way and every member helping the other
[1:05:37] slow down
[1:05:39] tap the brakes
[1:05:41] we all work together
[1:05:43] right we all we all work together
[1:05:46] if when there is a when there's there
[1:05:48] are meals that need to be prepared for a
[1:05:50] family in the church whether it be
[1:05:52] uh um you know the blessing of a child
[1:05:54] being born into the family or the loss
[1:05:56] of a family member or something happens
[1:05:58] and a meal meals need to be prepared not
[1:06:00] just one person takes the burden on and
[1:06:02] cooks all the meals right
[1:06:05] even though there may be one here who is
[1:06:07] more than capable of doing it
[1:06:09] and you could cook all the meals and you
[1:06:11] could plan the minion you could do
[1:06:13] everything for them but that's not how
[1:06:15] god's body works
[1:06:17] praise god
[1:06:18] that it doesn't work that way not one
[1:06:20] person is called to do it all
[1:06:23] you realize just even within the the the
[1:06:25] church of god like that the kind of the
[1:06:27] little this little bit of spin sometimes
[1:06:28] it's placed on
[1:06:30] the the role of a pastor within a church
[1:06:32] is that the pastor is a spiritual
[1:06:34] husband no not so
[1:06:36] your husband is a spiritual pastor
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:06:39] because the pastor within the church
[1:06:41] doesn't fulfill all the duties that a
[1:06:43] husband does in a family
[1:06:44] you need deacons and trustees to finally
[1:06:46] round out the picture yeah that's what a
[1:06:48] husband does within a family and it
[1:06:50] takes other offices to perform those
[1:06:52] roles within a local church because it
[1:06:54] doesn't all become the burden of one
[1:06:56] person
[1:06:58] so you have to realize that yes there
[1:07:00] may be things that you can do there may
[1:07:01] be ways that you can be a blessing but
[1:07:03] don't to think that you're the only one
[1:07:04] that's going to do it
[1:07:07] don't think you're the only one that has
[1:07:08] to do it or the only one that can do it
[1:07:10] there's a way that we've all got to work
[1:07:11] together and what i'm describing and
[1:07:13] what i'm alluding to what i'm talking
[1:07:15] about is the only way that we can all
[1:07:17] work together functioning just exactly
[1:07:19] in its place every gift in its place
[1:07:21] everyone helping the other every member
[1:07:23] helping the other the only way we can do
[1:07:25] that is to stay in our lane
[1:07:27] to stay within the confines that god has
[1:07:29] called us to to stay within the bounds
[1:07:31] and the limits of god's word and to do
[1:07:34] it in respecting the boundaries of that
[1:07:36] gift respecting the limits of how god
[1:07:38] wants me to use it and respecting one
[1:07:40] another's gifts and callings
[1:07:44] brother mikey you might be able to
[1:07:45] attest to this that sometimes you can
[1:07:46] get a platform full of really really
[1:07:49] good talented gifted musicians
[1:07:51] but until they work learn how to play
[1:07:53] together it's just a muddled mess
[1:07:56] if this was trying to play lead this was
[1:07:58] trying to play lead this was trying to
[1:07:59] play lead this was trying to keep rhythm
[1:08:00] play lead and do the bass notes and
[1:08:02] everyone's just off trying to show
[1:08:03] everybody how good and talented the runs
[1:08:06] they can do and the licks they can do
[1:08:07] and is when everyone else is trying to
[1:08:09] show off on the platform you're never
[1:08:10] going to get that synchronization
[1:08:13] and that blending and that harmony so
[1:08:15] sometimes the greatest gifts are the
[1:08:16] ones that know just to stay in their
[1:08:18] place
[1:08:19] and to do their part
[1:08:22] knowing having confidence that i may
[1:08:24] never get mentioned my name ever may
[1:08:26] never get called i may never get
[1:08:28] any recognition at all but if i don't do
[1:08:30] my part
[1:08:32] then that person will never get to do
[1:08:34] their part
[1:08:35] and yeah that part may get all the
[1:08:37] attention that part may get all the
[1:08:38] accolades and all the all the praise and
[1:08:40] all the glory may go to some but what's
[1:08:43] important is you do your part
[1:08:45] it's blended so well with the sermons we
[1:08:47] are preaching on practice
[1:08:50] i think it's a wonderful opportunity to
[1:08:52] segue into this different subject of
[1:08:53] barriers and boundaries
[1:08:56] let's be inspired to do our part
[1:09:00] and realize you'll never be able to do
[1:09:01] your part until you recognize the
[1:09:02] boundaries that god has placed within
[1:09:03] your life
[1:09:05] and you'll never free someone else to do
[1:09:06] theirs if you're constantly
[1:09:07] disrespecting their boundaries
[1:09:10] it's important
[1:09:11] to know the difference
[1:09:13] between barriers and boundaries
[1:09:15] let's stand together this evening
[1:09:18] [Music]
[1:09:28] god bless you let's pray tonight with
[1:09:30] your heads bowed
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:35] there is a a a wonderful presence
[1:09:39] here tonight
[1:09:41] and i believe that you can
[1:09:43] in this moment at this time
[1:09:46] just lift a hand to the lord and say
[1:09:47] lord this is what i need
[1:09:51] say lord i need this from you
[1:09:55] and in doing so
[1:09:57] humble yourself
[1:10:01] to his will for your life
[1:10:05] so i have this ambition i have this
[1:10:06] dream i want to go here i want to do
[1:10:08] this i want to do that i want to
[1:10:09] accomplish this i want to see this we
[1:10:11] have our bucket list as it were and the
[1:10:13] things that we want to accomplish the
[1:10:14] things that we want to do but wouldn't
[1:10:16] it be much more beautiful if you could
[1:10:17] just do what he wants you to do
[1:10:20] and say lord i've got ambitions i've got
[1:10:22] dreams i got things i know i can do and
[1:10:24] yeah it can be very frustrating i feel
[1:10:26] like i've got so much that i can add so
[1:10:28] much i can do so much i can give but
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:34] don't you want to see it the way god
[1:10:35] sees it
[1:10:37] don't you want god to use it the way
[1:10:38] that he could use it
[1:10:41] [Music]
[1:10:47] my mind is
[1:10:50] suddenly becoming very conscious of
[1:10:51] different things even conversations i've
[1:10:54] had and desires and wishes that are
[1:10:56] expressed
[1:10:58] and
[1:11:00] i believe that god is speaking to us in
[1:11:02] a way to
[1:11:03] put us in a right path
[1:11:07] to accomplish his will and see great
[1:11:08] victories in our lives
[1:11:10] that's not an empty phrase i really
[1:11:12] believe that what we're looking at in
[1:11:14] the word of god
[1:11:16] to recognize god's will for our lives
[1:11:18] and what he has for us
[1:11:20] is going to lose the power in our lives
[1:11:25] and help us in so many different areas
[1:11:29] with our heads bowed let's pray
[1:11:31] the needs you've expressed by uplifted
[1:11:32] hand by a
[1:11:34] a pleading heart may you bring these
[1:11:36] needs before the lord in your own way
[1:11:38] tonight
[1:11:39] our gracious heavenly father
[1:11:42] barriers and boundaries
[1:11:45] are recorded throughout your word
[1:11:47] [Music]
[1:11:49] barrier after barrier of the enemy
[1:11:52] barriers man-made satan inspired
[1:11:56] have for thousands of years tried to
[1:11:58] keep man from walking within the borders
[1:12:00] of your word
[1:12:02] we see examples of men of god being
[1:12:05] enticed beyond limits and being called
[1:12:07] beyond borders and being called beyond
[1:12:10] boundaries that your word set
[1:12:13] being coaxed out of a place of safety
[1:12:15] into
[1:12:16] a place of fear and worry and doubt and
[1:12:19] vulnerability
[1:12:20] all because the devil
[1:12:23] wants us to override a boundary
[1:12:27] and lord there's times in our lives we
[1:12:29] find ourselves on the wrong side and
[1:12:30] we're groping and we're meandering and
[1:12:33] we see that there's something in the
[1:12:34] word of god that we can possess and that
[1:12:36] we can't have and we we set forward to
[1:12:38] try to achieve it or to walk in and to
[1:12:39] receive it and satan's so quick to throw
[1:12:41] up a roadblock
[1:12:42] and put barriers in our place
[1:12:46] lord i do not want one person under the
[1:12:49] sound of my voice tonight
[1:12:51] to slump their shoulders and kick a can
[1:12:55] at the foot of a satan's barrier
[1:12:57] thinking that god's word is not for them
[1:13:01] but may we recognize the barriers that
[1:13:03] satan has put in our lives and the
[1:13:04] things that are keeping us from
[1:13:06] possessing all the promises
[1:13:08] and with shoulders back and eyes of
[1:13:10] faith we can begin to ascend above or
[1:13:12] tunnel beneath or plow through or
[1:13:13] whatever it's going to take to get
[1:13:15] beyond the barrier into your promises
[1:13:17] lord may we begin to have that eagle
[1:13:19] eyesight
[1:13:21] to see beyond the barrier
[1:13:23] and pursue the truth
[1:13:26] lord as a young church
[1:13:28] we're just
[1:13:30] barely scratching the surface or there
[1:13:32] is not any depth even that has been
[1:13:35] reached in terms of what we can do as a
[1:13:37] church
[1:13:39] whether it be gifts or offices and
[1:13:42] whether it be the ministering of the
[1:13:44] word
[1:13:46] salvation in our families
[1:13:49] the deliverances of bondage
[1:13:52] lord i speak plainly as a pastor i see
[1:13:54] ones that are bound by things and they
[1:13:56] have become
[1:13:57] borders and boundaries and barriers that
[1:14:00] are simply the shackles of the devil and
[1:14:03] people are living their lives within
[1:14:05] those constraints and those confines and
[1:14:07] by cognitive dissonance people can tell
[1:14:10] themselves oh this is fine this is great
[1:14:12] everything's wonderful but oh god i
[1:14:14] would that your word once again as it
[1:14:16] spoke out in genesis 1 could speak out
[1:14:19] over people's lives and they could be
[1:14:20] loosed from these barriers that are
[1:14:22] keeping them from doing the things that
[1:14:24] they know that they ought to do as
[1:14:25] christians from being in fellowship in
[1:14:27] the house of god from exercising the
[1:14:29] faith that you have given them oh god
[1:14:32] may all the barriers of the enemy be
[1:14:34] destroyed
[1:14:35] [Music]
[1:14:38] lord not that there be no holds barred
[1:14:40] and anything goes and that we would just
[1:14:42] be this rampant fancy free footloose
[1:14:45] church but lord may we walk within the
[1:14:47] boundaries of your word knowing that
[1:14:48] within it is anything we need
[1:14:51] and everything we want
[1:14:54] i pray father that we could take a step
[1:14:56] forward as a church to go a little bit
[1:14:58] deeper
[1:14:59] lord if we're operating at six and a
[1:15:01] half percent
[1:15:03] may we take a step further lord and our
[1:15:05] goal to operate at 100
[1:15:08] i commit us to you lord
[1:15:10] bless those that raised hands and
[1:15:12] offered a prayer and expressed things in
[1:15:14] their heart
[1:15:15] may they be benefited by this principle
[1:15:18] we ask this in the name of the lord
[1:15:20] jesus christ
[1:15:21] amen
