TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Isaiah chapter 7 I'm just going to read one verse it's a maybe a cliche for a Christmas season uh but it is probably the most outstanding prophecy of his coming it's a paradox and it says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel that's quite a statement a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son and his name Shall be Called Emmanuel amen you can be seated trust that the Lord will be your portion this evening as the word is ministered and that each one of you regardless of your age or where you're at uh in your experience with the Lord there just can be something that you could jump out and grab a hold of uh this is part two on the gift of Christ's presence and we did mention on Sunday how we're just taking advantage of the Christmas time maybe in a little bit of a play on word and not gifts or presents but the gift of Christ's presence and using this statement from the Queen of Sheba God gives gifts in all generations a gift of his presence that's something that uh we ought to Value something that we ought to Aspire to experience and to promote and to lift up the gift of his presence and we're using this Christmas theme to highlight an aspect of the house of the Lord and that aspect is the presence of God in the house of the Lord and as Sunday as we looked at it the with the Ark of the Covenant the greatest asset was God if you took God out of it you just look at salvage value it's it doesn't have it can't go it can't function it has no purpose and so in the house of the Lord and as it pertained to that Arc of the Covenant which you know had over $6 Million worth of gold just in that in itself uh without God there it loses its real value and every single detail in the house of the Lord and everything that was uh whether it be the materials that were used and its arrangement structure everything was pointing to God's presence uh there was types and shadows and the curtains and everything the way that it was arranged was to lead us to that place and to emphasize his presence between the cherubims and in 1st Samuel chapter 4 as we saw that God had established Samuel as a prophet and the word of Samuel was being spoken to Israel as the voice of God and they immediately went into battle without consulting the prophet and when they went into battle lost they didn't return to the Lord to try to uh find out what was wrong but they went and talked to um the sons of the high priest who were evil and were worthless and they brought the Ark of the Covenant on the battlefield thinking that the presence of the Ark would be enough to bring them Victory and it showed that there's this danger in Tradition and Superstition where with the where there's a lack of obedience to the word of God a lack of faith or an understanding of what the Ark of the Covenant represented he say well the Lord's going to dwell between those cherubims Above The Mercy Seat I I wouldn't want to take the Ark of the Covenant and think that that had some magical power without the god that would dwell between those uh mer between those cherubim so there was a lack of understanding a lack of relationship uh with God and it was a warning to us that we cannot make the same mistake in this hour where we just substitute ritual for the presence of God you going to say well the presence of God there's ways that we could look at it's his word uh it's his will the presence of God it is even a person and so we cannot substitute a verbal confession of the message of the hour just the ritual and tradition of church order and observing things in the message we need that experience with the word of God or we will be just as powerless as Israel was that day before the Philistines and the Proclamation was kabad uh the name of the child was ikabod to indicate that the glory of God had departed from Israel and it wasn't just solely because the Ark of the Lord was taken but the Ark of the Lord being taken indicated and showed that God was no longer there the glory the shikina glory was no longer being manifested in Israel and the benefits of that the the power that came with his presence they were missing out on now I think that's maybe um enough there just to summarize some of the things that we were touching on Sunday in the gift of Christ's presence now if you turn to Psalms chapter 27 and I'm going to read verse four we know it begins with the Lord is my light my salvation he is the strength of my life so there's no fear I'm not afraid and we are circling back to the very first service we preached this year on the house of the Lord and we're kind of trying to wrap up this whole series we've done this year on the house of the Lord the different ways that we looked at it so we're going to go back to the beginning where we started and David says one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after and we recognized in the very beginning that real living is the process of identifying value in recognizing things that have worth and that are important so your as we live life should be about determining real value a and True Value and in doing so simplifying Our Lives um to let those things have preeminence and give those things place in our life so this real living is a process of determining things of value and then in doing so simplifying our life so it leads to Simplicity one thing have I desired the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life so we can say perfect Simplicity here would be living in the house of the Lord and this is kind of a begins to describe what he means by this he says to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple so he's seeking God's presence he's seeking God's Beauty this isn't an air BNB where you want the host to be gone when you get there this is a situation where he says I want to go to the house of the Lord and the Lord better be there I I I want him to be there I want to see his Beauty I want to know him more I want to experience his goodness and the scriptures familiar and we probably mentioned this on a regular Cadence that brother bam took psalms 27 veres 1 to5 when he preached the Rapture message in December of 65 and he was very open about my scripture is not typical he said this is not a Main Street scripture uh and so he was taking I believe a prophecy of the Rapture when he identified Psalms 27: 1 to5 and so this to me is a very important text these words here have application to the very moment you're living in right now in in in in the in the reality of the Rapture and he says one thing have I desired I want to dwell in the house of the Lord to behold the beauty of the Lord so the house of the Lord is a place of God's Beauty that word beauty mean speaks of kindness which we could think of his Mercy it speaks of pleasantness and favor which would even maybe indicate a Grace So to to behold the beauty it's to be pleasant and beautiful sweet and lovely and isn't that what we all are we're all just so sweet and lovely and the house of the Lord was a place where he could inquire it's to seek or to consider to reflect on but these things can only be so by his presence if you're going to inquire after the Lord he in his Temple you're you're looking for him you're seeking him you're wanting them to have preeminence we take these words that David expresses just very succinctly even in this one verse David is longing for deeply personal relationship with God where he feels his presence and he's empowered by it and it's real he just doesn't want to go worship he just doesn't want to go sacrifice he doesn't say one thing have I desired of the Lord is is to go offer sacrifices one thing have I desired is to be able to praise and to sing and to dance he says no I want to be able to experience his presence and have a a personal relationship with him to behold the beauty of the Lord this requires the presence of God in Proverbs 16:1 15 it says in the light of the king's countenance is life and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain I'd like for you to think about end time prophecy signs in the heaven of a cloud the king's sword and all these different elements that begin to collide just even in one one scripture in the light the Lord is my light my salvation in the light of the king's countenance is life here's the living here's the empowering here's the quickening power and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain it's in his face when you can see his face when you see one's countenance that's maybe sometimes the problem uh with texting and chatting and sometimes even on the phone is you can't see the person's facial expressions and so we try to use emojis and different things maybe to convey what we're saying but then sometimes you're using an emoji uh there's an emoji that I use and it's just like like someone's clenching their teeth and it's kind of like to me it's kind of like an e right and I think somebody said some one time why are you always wincing or why you know what are you afraid of I like that's not what that means right and and and whether or not this is actually praying hands or high five and so sometimes even in that we're confusing we're not really conveyant but if someone could see your face I want to see your eyes I want to see your face it declares favor we declare whether God was angry with us or declare whether or not he was pleased with us or there's a Grace to come to us and so in the light of the king's face in his face there is life in his favor from that countenance is as The Cloud of a latter rain this is what David wanted to see he wanted to see his face as he says in verse 7 of Psalms 27 verses 7 89 here oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me so this is this is kind of unpacking verse four one thing have I desired what does he want when thou said us seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek now what what a what a request from God seek my face and an answer from David when God had already told Moses no man can see my face and live but yet this is something that God is inviting him to do seek my face and my heart said I will seek it hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in AER thou Hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation he wanted that nearness that closeness he wanted to see his face and his face not to be veiled or obscure or turned away he wanted to look at me let me know how you feel about me let me see your eyes let me see your truth and your reality hide not your face from you this is what David is longing for is the face of God in Psalms 89: 14-6 we use this scripture a few times in the subject to Mercy Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy Throne that's his Dwelling Place there in the throne is Justice and judgment but not just Justice and judgment but mercy and Truth why because mercy and Truth Shall go before thy face in your presence yes there's Justice in his presence yes there's judgment but in his throne it's a mercy Throne it's a judgment throne and there's mercy and Truth before his face notice he says blessed is the people that know the joy ful sound that's a cry that's a shout blessed are the people that know the joyful sound coming from that Throne the voice of judgment The Voice of Truth blessed are the people that know the joyful sound they shall walk O Lord in the light of thy countenance in his face in this shining in this brightness in this understanding and knowing who he is and seeing him face to face we know that when the seals are open brother BR refers to this as the as the complete M the complete secret is being revealed said the Bible becomes a new book and so when the the he says earlier in his ministry when you're looking into the word he's quoting God child of I when you look into the Bible you're looking at me face to face so when the Bible the seals are opened and this Bible becomes a new book book then we are beholding him clearly as in a glass we're seeing him face to face in the light of the king's countenance is life in the light of his countenance we can walk when we've heard the joyful sound in thy name shall they Rejoice all the day because it's shalom it is the rising of the sun it is a new day and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted it's in his righteousness that we're walking it's in the light of the word that we're walking and brother Bram said the beginning of righteousness is God's revealed truth so in order for us to uh uh be exalted in his righteousness there has to be revealed truth that makes him known that declares uh his his face that makes known the path that we should walk it's the light of his countenance these are things that relate to the gift of his presence the his provision and pleasure that comes with his presence a place of safety a place of beauty so David saying this one thing have I desired I'm going to seek after it I I want to dwell in the house of the Lord I want to behold his Beauty he said to seek his face so I'll seek it where is he going to find it in that secret place so he says in verse 5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me now think of this idea of being hid hide me in his Pavilion they seem to be a strange word he shall hide me in his Pavilion and he essentially is amplifying it more with this phrase in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me so again David is emphasizing this that the wicked and his enemies have gathered themselves around him to eat up his flesh which is a type of this physical death and when they tried they stumbled and fell so there's your very image of the climax of The Rapture change of our body defeating death he says in this time in the presence of my enemies in this time of trouble I'm going to be hid in God's Pavilion he's going to hide me in the secret of his Tabernacle he shall set me up upon a rock Pavilion could have very well been translated to Tabernacle there in the first part of this verse it's that a den a booth uh it implies maybe some sort of covert something that's out of the way Tabernacle could have been translated to tent there it's a dwelling it's a home it's a habitation and the secret this covering this shelter it's a hiding place it's for protection when it's secret it's concealed and it's something that's hidden it speaks of hiding something carefully so it's not publicly known it's not obvious it's not something that you would just be able to uh figure out and see I think of even brother George Smith telling uh talking about that cave that brother Bron would go to in Green's Mill and just how hidden it was and how obscure and there's things in our lives when we hike and we we go certain places and we do certain things it's like oh they said there was this place right here be looking for it real careful and you'll miss it and you never see it you never find it look it's right there it's over there I can't see it I can't and you could do it several times and always miss it because it's not obvious it's concealed the secret place of the Tabernacle we know was behind that Veil in the holiest of holies the most holy Place The Secret of his Tabernacle is where his presence was that's that's that singular place not outer Court not inner court but in Behind the Veil The Secret of his Tabernacle is where he wanted to be for in a time of trouble he'll hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle if all else fails that's the one place I know I can be and be safe right want to use the scripture in the Song of Solomon 2:14 as a language a poetic language that describes what David is describing oh my Dove Thou Art In The Cliffs Of The Rock in the secret places of the stairs in the protection place of the stairs a step it's a a way leading to place the secret places of the stairs not the steps of the stairs but the place that's hidden beyond the steps let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely it's beautiful this is a poetry that would describe that place that David wanted to be I know where the entrance is I know where the court is but Lord I want you to hide me uh in that place as the Bible says a man will be a hiding place he will be a rock in a weary land he will be a protection he'll be a shelter hide me in the secret place of the stairs there in the secret place I'll behold your face I'll see you as you are and I'll be able to hear hear your voice for it is sweet and your your countenance is beautiful so David describes in this time of trouble this place in the house of the Lord there where there's a hidden Beauty it's secluded it's secret it's safe where he beholds his face and hears his voice I'm amplifying right now just this thought in the scripture that he shall hide me in the secret of his Tabernacle where his face is and so Psalms 91: 1:4 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty this would be an illusion to the house of the Lord where the Lord dwelleth between the cherubims he that dwells in the secret place of the most high would be dwelling where the Lord dwell under the shadow of the almighty that implies in his presence there under his covering secretly hidden him I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress he is become my salvation he is the one in whom I hide he he is my protector my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he will deliver the in a time of trouble he will protect you you can go and read more in Psalm 91 and read in other places that we've got to have a confidence in this end time with all the pestilence with all the threatenings with all the rebellions with all the conspiracies with all the diseases and all the economics and everything that seems like it could change in a moment we have to have confidence in one thing that he will deliver us he will protect us and all the noisome pestilence should be a phrase that we could probably recognize on a daily basis the noisome pestilence all around us and where will he hide Us in his presence under the shadow of the almighty a secret place of the most high amen he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wing shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler what does that what does that bring to mind what does that look like The Mercy Seat where there's mercy and Truth under the shadow of the almighty and what is it it's his feathers under his wings he will hide you the truth is going to be your shield and buckler there hid in his presence he covers you he's he's inviting you to that place that at one time would have been death that no other man could enter in except the high priest once a year but Christ having forever consecrated a away he said this is where I want us to be this is where I want us to dwell even if you see God they dwelling in uh in between those cherums and you have these two cherums that are together over that you could even see an image of Christ and his bride being the embodiment of God himself he's going to hide you brother bam uses the phrase the secret Rapture of the supernatural bride and these SCP script are describing that whether it be in type or even in Prophecy these scriptures are describing the secret Rapture of the supernatural bride wherein God is hiding Us in the secret of his Tabernacle Psalms 31:20 takes a very similar language to what David uses in Psalms 27:5 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence that that's the real tonight my my main emphasis was to show The Secret of his presence uh and whenever it's gift giving time you try to keep it a secret well you can't really do that anymore because I get uh emails from the post office for mail that's coming and I anything that's sent by UPS I get that and everything we buy is on our debit card at our bank so I can see everywhere that's being Sho I don't get surprises there are no secrets so you have to learn how to act surprised my mom told me one time Aon you just need how to learn to play dumb I was like well it just doesn't come natural like it does for you Mom I'm kidding I didn't say that uh I'm I'm joking I really am joking but we there's a we'd go to Great Links to try to uh uh hide things and be secret well it's the same thing the secret of his presence Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man the pride of man now as I was thinking about this today the plots the schemes the lies in all the ways the pride of man identifies itself in the hour that we're living in all the arrogance and all the pleasures and all the entertainments he's going to hide Us in the secret of his presence and from the pride of man so the pride of man is still seemingly compassion itself about you you're still in the presence of your enemies as Psalms 23 would say but yet you're still feasting at the king's table he hasn't dropped the Veil Down and put you in another dimension you're right there and TOA but raptured up quickly to meet the Lord in a spiritual sense feasting on spiritual mana and it's hiding you from the schemes and the plots and the lies of men Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from The Strife of tongues when we look at the whole Secret Of God being revealed the whole Secret Of God is revealed for the rapturing of the bride and as God begins to reveal his Secrets he's he's bringing you into himself he's protecting you with divine revelation he's revealing his secrets to you and that's where your pleasure is that's where your power is that's where your protection is in this end time and it's no curious thing that this scripture is applicable to a Rapture season in the secret of thy presence will you hide me from the pride of man and kept secretly in that Pavilion that Tabernacle that covert from The Strife of tongues brother banham says when he preaches the Rapture he says we're warned that the doctrine of this in the last days will be scorned at what's the doctrine of this his return to catch his bride away the the the secret of his presence the doctrine of this the teaching and the truth of the Rapture will be scorned at and in other words there will be The Strife of tongues there will be the pride of man that even is very directly attributed to the Rapture and the teaching the truth of the rapture in 2 Peter 3: 3 and 4 this is the scripture brother bam uses and was pointing to and he said the doctrine of this in the last days will be scorned at knowing this first and I was even thinking about reading second Peter three as our text tonight because I'm drawing a lot from this second Peter whether it be chapter 2 and chapter 1 even and chapter 3 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers there's your the the being scorned at these scoffers they mock they delude they or they try to deceive am know their mockery deludes the truth of of this their their sarcasm their lies all their efforts fight the truth of this and what is it the truth that the last days these scoffers walking after their own lust say this in verse four where is the promise of his coming now we can say oh well I'll just tell you right now where the promise of his coming is well turn there and tell you what the promise is but that's not what they mean CU notice he says for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of Creation in other words nothing's changed everything's the same nothing seems to have occurred because everything just keeps going along just the same as it always have so when they say where is the promise of his coming it's not that he has promised to return or it's not that he's promised uh to do do something but where how can you say anything has happened because nothing seems to have changed the word their promise means where's the message or the announcement of his coming the word that's used come from the Bas meaning of angel or messenger where's the one that where's the announcement where's the promise of his coming where's the announcement even of it coming there it it's been a controversial word for decades in the message but just in the simple Greek peris perisa that that's described there where is the promise of his presence where is the promise of his presence you say well it's a it's a the Bible says it's secret well where's the change where's the difference the word uh presence here is joined from a root of Peri which means to be alongside of or to be present with sometimes we just think that certain things happen it it's just a flash it just happens come and go but this is a an arrival this is a coming and then this ter together with where is the promise of his presence we can say his coming here in the scripture where is the promise of his coming we can say where is the promise of his appearance where is the promise of his presence not just a brief uh uh revealing but an arrival and a presence with and scoffers Will Mock his coming they'll mock his presence they'll try to delude it to try to water it down in the same way that they would have in the days of his first coming right is in Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel and the Hebrew Emmanuel means god with us or with us is God Matthew chap 1: 23 when the scripture says that it might be fulfilled as is written by the prophet Isaiah his name shall be called imanuel he says which being interpreted is God With Us in other words Jesus Christ was to reflect God's presence on Earth he was now the new Most Holy place he was the mercy seat that was where God would dwell this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell he was a bear of God's presence and the Bible says that it was fulfilled Mary received having not been touched by man but the child conceived into her was conceived by the Holy Ghost something that she kept secretly in her heart God had to give Joseph A Vision to know that this child which is going to be born of her is from God you go back to the prophecy Behold a virgin shall conceive we understand it in the Fulfillment that it was a woman that had never known a man but to a Jew and a Hebrew they go back and say well no that word there says Behold a young Maiden will conceive could be a young married woman it could just be a woman newly married but it doesn't necessarily mean that she has never known a man but yet when God interpreted his word by bringing it to pass a virgin conceived and so what was the what was the scoffing what was the mocking oh he's an illegitimate child and mo Joseph had to do this to cover this up they they they weren't satisfied with God's interpretation but they mocked it and they they scorned it but it was God with them Christmas in itself is we said Sunday we're not endorsing the celebration of it nor would we discourage it we just trust that the leaders in the own home will observe it as they feel led but in general at this time of year the idea Christmas celebration and it celebrates the arrival or the coming of Jesus Christ God with us some of the most moving uh Christmas songs are those that speak of Emmanuel coming word that was used and used quite often to Signal the uh Christmas time is advent and all the children know by the Advent calendars that have a chocolate for every day and I think ours were empty a week ago short quick work but the Advent means presence it it speaks of an arrival and that's that's what is That's What Christmas represents as the coming and then all the nominal world is looking for the second Advent right the magical quotations they're they're looking forward to that the Bible says in 2 Peter 3:10 though but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night this day that's being described there will begin and will begin to settle in and these events that take place it's not going to all of a sudden be a a chapter break and there's a great scroll in the sky or a crawl on the television screen and people like Oh look The Day of the Lord has started and we all get notifications right an amber alert and now everybody's been informed now it's going to come as a thief in the night I think I've probably said this before little a word of the wise to the thieves don't announce that you're coming right you know you don't say hey I'm going to rob your house tomorrow night be looking for me back door it's where I'm coming right through the back door but a thief comes veiled he comes hidden he uses the phrase as a thief in the night Peter does to describe how it would come secretly or undetected Jesus even in what time went up to the feast uh uh hidden in secret veiled as it was and we know that when a thief comes veiled and hidden he does not announce his arrival globally doesn't uh tell you beforehand exactly when it's happening but afterwards those that have missed it comes with great sorrow and loss Thessalonians 52 1 Thessalonians chap 5:2 for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night brother BR said the Rapture will be a secret in the sermon Lord just once more he says it's a secret coming the Rapture is comes to steal away like that book I read that time of Juliet and Romeo we always say Romeo and Juliet has the order been corrected Juliet and Romeo he come at the night time when the people were sleeping in worldliness and the church all in worldliness he comes as a thief in the night it's a secret coming the Rapture is to steal away to catch away he wants to bring his subjects to him he wants to gather his elect Revelations 3: 2 and 3 at the announcement to the sardan church age Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee we could just see how uh Rich these phrases are to other prophecies and things in the scripture says I will come to thee as a thief in this hour we know that in Revelations chapter 3:20 he comes and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me but if you can't if you do not know the voice if you do not hear him if you're not on watch to those who look for him will he appear a second time why because he comes as a thief in the night now if I could and I guess I'm saying if I could I'm going to try to just transition some here that if we could in our Mind's Eye imagine a time of trouble a day great day of darkness and sin and depravity the way that we could describe it in Revelations 3 the parallels we could draw to uh men in the last days walking after their own lust with scoffers and and those who say where is the promise of his coming and the wicked and our enemies gathering around us and all the assaults from every angle and we know that we need God and we feel that our days are being pressed and it's a terrible Dreadful time it's a dark time and God says well in the secret of my presence I can hide you and we would say I want to know the secret I want to know where the secret is and as Peter has written about the day of the Lord coming as a thief and the mockers and scoffers in the end time they say where is the benefit the promise of the protection of his coming cuz nothing's changed he opened his letter in verse 11 2 Peter chapter 1:1 saying for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for so an entrance the word there is translated to coming in one place for so a coming shall be ministered unto you abundantly it's the ACT of entering behold I stand at the door and knock If any man will open up this entrance be administered a way leading into his presence a way leading into a relationship not uh not uh a Superstition not ritual not tradition not denominationalism not the form and structure of the church ages that go brother bam is showing us very clearly there's been an indictment to it we being called out of it but a a coming shall be ministered unto you a door opened in heaven I was called up higher an entrance ministered a message if I could say it this way a message revealing the secret of his arrival a message pointing us to the gift of his presence I would challenge you that if there has been any Scarlet Letter placed upon these things if there's been any scarecrows that have been erected through many decades that have pared some of the same scriptures and said some of the same things I challenge you to get serious with what was taught in the message of the hour and ask yourself you said it what does it mean to me really what is the reality of it if brother Bron was so adamant about these things if his ministry very consistently especially at a certain juncture begin to point us to the Fulfillment of certain things Lord I don't want to just bury my head in the sand and say the sun's not shining the sun's not shining Lord I want to know what does this mean in a very real practical way to me not get weird with it not get superstitious not become ritualistic not become cultish Lord I want to know if there was going to be if there is a coming that's been ministered to us if there's a message that is revealing the secret of the Rapture Lord I want to receive the gift of your presence in this hour thank you Lord in the sermon the identified Christ of all ages he says the trouble with people today we find them living in the glare of another age this ain't no April Fool's message he says just like Jesus found when he come he found them living in the glare of the law and ignoring what was take to take place in his his age I love this you know what's the matter today I'm not I'm reading let me just say the same exact thing and he says it dozens of ways especially during this time period that he's saying what happened then is repeated itself again what was the matter with the Lutheran I want you to focus on this very very intently I I'm I'm going to be finishing up here pretty soon but there's a a phrase here that I believe is not accidental we must catch this you know what's the matter today what was the matter with the Lutheran well because they were living in the glare of the Lutheran age when John Wesley found the secret of sanctification now pick up on that when God had revealed justification to Luther they stayed back in that Revelation and didn't go further in the light of God's word when John Wesley found the secret of sanctification they couldn't go because they were living in the glare of Luther's age what happened to the Pentecostals why Wesley was so organized until he was living in the glare of another age they were in Wesley's age when the baptism of the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostals or when the secret of that has been found been discovered or brought back to the church they were living in that Wesley said Wesley said sanctification it was hard for them to believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit the restoration of the gifts they were living in a glare of another age and that's what they were doing when Jesus come so I ask you what day are we living in now it is not a time for the secret of justification it is not a time for the revealing of The Secret of sanctification it's not the time for the secret of the restoration of the gifts but it's the time of the secret of his presence where it's time where he himself steps into it it's a time where he who has guided this and watched out over it all the way down it's a time when the Holy Ghost itself is made known just as Wesley found the secret of sanctification there had to be a messenger that found the secret of his presence in Amos chap 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets he could not just come along and bring to pass these things I I there's a there there's so much that must be expressed in this moment I just trust God could give this just begin to Quicken some things to you the truth of justification had been lost and Luther restored it the truth of sanctification watered down Wesley restores it the gifts had been mixed and mingled and there was a lot of gifts in in the Methodist you say well shouting and praising and those things is Pentecostal well they were doing that the the Wesleyan age and with the restoration of the gifts though God is restoring certain truths and God's bringing back that birth the new birth comprised of those three things now but when we come to certain aspects in the end time God is going to do things he hasn't done yet he's going to be fulfilling scriptures that had not been fulfilled yet he's going to come now and he needs a restoration in order for these things to be fulfilled so when he does that he has he's going to revealing this secret he's got to do it through a prophet right no there couldn't just be this uh there couldn't just be a global uh Zen or Chi right that we just all kind of had where we we're fully enlightened to the fact that we are now in fact God and now I have this conundrum about who I pray to because I am God and I have become one with God so much that I am God and really what you become is a message Buddhist right I'm a Buddhist and you are expressing things that just kind of like this Collective Enlightenment that we've all come into but this is God had to send a voice God has said this is how I'll do it I'll do it by means of a prophet and I believe that this is so plain and rooted in Scripture that this is how God does things that no matter how strange it might seem and no matter how unfamiliar it might be this is how God said he would do it that means that God said in his Bible there would come a time when he had have to raise up a voice to speak truth to bring people back to the Bible and it would be in an age when the whole world could be reached and contacted say really in the end time in billions of Christians there'd be one voice it's just the way God's done it and brother brandham says in the sermon calling Jesus on the scene I believe we must really uh uh wrestle with these statements but there's always a gift that manifests the presence of God and through there you yourself have to believe it a gift that manifests the presence of God John Wesley found the secret of sanctification this end time there's going to be a prophet that's going to find be given granted the secret of his presence and we had on earth a gift that manifested the presence of God and we had to believe it in the sermon and I have heard but now I see that if there ever is a secret comes out from God to be made known to the people it'll never come through a seminary it'll never be never come through a group of people it never did it always will has and will through one individual a prophet when we talked Sunday I believe it was on the premise I think these things we revisit these things themes quite a bit because no matter what we preach must have the context of what's been given and the purpose of it right you lose if you lose the narrative you lose the plot then later on you could just be like well you know maybe our Prophet didn't say that right we just erase it and we just take the Book of Mormon and we kind of massage it around and we change it into something else year after year after year and we have the prophets who kind of update the word of God if if you lose sight of the plot if you lose sight of the premise if there was value in it then if there was intent if there was purpose understand what it was to know whether or not that is a glare another age are relevant today and if you lose sight of the premise amen we'll fall right back into the trap to where there's no Redemption out of this is the age of the finished cycle so in other words if you don't go into the finishing of the cycle and it moves into that particular cycle if you don't go into that it is death with no Revival you will come up before the white Throne judgment there is no Redemption cuz God comes to the place where I'm done I'm finished this is everything I've been trying to do this is what I've been trying to accomplish so brother bam says in the first seal at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me tonight to show you through here that we are to receive a messenger that'll take all the Loose Ends out there and I believe there's a Ministry of tying up the Loose Ends and then according to the various statements he makes to that effect there's this other part and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church amen this is a message pointing us to Christ because he's pointing us away from ritual away from tradition away from the Creeds of man away from Superstition away from himself he even went so far as to say as John the Baptist said I must decrease he must increase brother BR put himself in the same pattern he was a voice with his finger pointing us to the revealed word if a secret was ever going to come from God it would take a prophet to point us to it if I could just dramatize it as if brother brandom came and knew where that Clift was in The Rock he could said behold this is where it is what does he say when he looks at the cloud he said that's our Lord up there things he pointed us to said well then is that literally then Christ doing certain things it was a sign given in the Heavens to show us the supreme authority the wigged one certain things are happening oh they become a a maybe a a a a stain to some people people in a controversy I'm not afraid of the controversy this controversy of the bride God is going to vindicate it God is going to settle it and it took a prophet a messenger to begin to identify these things he says don't all go to Jeffersonville what did he say about moving to Tucson don't do it for me don't follow me he said you better find the mind of God you you better be following the will of God that was the message that was follow God's voice follow God's will have thus sayith the Lord or keep still dress yourself in the word my goodness we've made it as easy as just all of us changing our last name to branom right staying at home and writing a python script that'll just play the message on repeat in perpetuity so all we have to do is push play once and talk about an interesting Paradox that'll be through python but there's a way where we're try and we we could just disal it down to things that are such lwh hanging fruit so easy to to accomplish well let's just all move to Jeffersonville let's just all move to Lima whatever it might be or Johnson City that's that would be the easiest thing we could do but to seek his face to fight through all the the the voices and the crowds and the controversies and the lies to be rooted in faith to believe God's word is true this Bible is correct no matter how much overwhelming evidence they want to come up with well guess what we just found a manuscript to where these things were were written of Before Time in this civilization so many millions of years ago and we found an alien craft with a copy of a Bible from some other planet we can prove it through carbon dating I'd say oh well isn't that neat that God did that there must have been some aliens somewhere else that God wanted to do this with it's not going to stumble me because God when he reveals himself personally to you and God has Vindicated his presence amongst us and said you can take me at my word we read the King James version and we and we We Believe well this is God's Bible this is his love letter to us but you realize King James I I remember when people were like that's blasphemous that they're calling LeBron James King James like you do realize that King James is just like a king in England right I mean it was it wasn't like God's secret name and Jesus in English is James it was it's not that at all but we have a Bible that was translated for some interesting reasons King James but yet he got the Bible and we read that and we believe it's an accurate translation but do you realize other believers in other countries are having to read translations that are not necessarily King James and they may not be as accurate as we believe ours is but that God is obligated and God has promised that I will make myself known to you in every tongue in every culture my voice will be lived throughout the world because God has made this an end time transaction with his bride oh my Dove Thou Art in the cffs of the Rock in the secret place of the stairs I want to see your face I want to hear your voice that's where we are today and brother brandham said and God's only provided place of worship he says when Once the genuine word comes into you the word Jesus then brother the message is no secret to you then you know it brother it's it's all lit up before you there's our Christmas lights when Jesus the word comes into you the message is no secret to you then no secret to you then why because he's promised to make his secret known hide you in the secret of that truth it's the secret coming these are beautiful truths when Once the genuine word comes into you the message is no secret it's all lit up before you good some of the statements of brother brandham that I've been thinking about a lot over the last few weeks is brother BR says if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word I believe that holds true today more than it ever has before we're living in a time and an age where our lives can be so saturated moment to moment in a time when it seemingly the task that we otherwise would be accomplishing and doing we no longer have to do but we found other ways to make ourselves busy and create other problems and it's drawing us away from his presence it draws us away from welcoming and receiving the word so that we can have deity in our midst and that's why you asked the question I wonder if we are sufficiently impress impressed I'm going to say it this way with his presence go and study the message of the hour when he preaches the seals and how much he talks about the seventh seal being a great secret great secret a great secret find where he talked about the seventh seal the third pull and even these Visions as being a secret not a public show and how careful he remained in being true to that don't explain it too much this secret this great secret brothers you could come to your instruments here in the sermon Christ is mystery God revealed I could literally read an hour's worth of statements from the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed just bouncing through it even just on this theme but this is such a familiar theme to you I just want to read it it's a little bit lengthy but it says what was once God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer the body of Christ think of this secret now we're talking about the gift of Christ Christ's presence and this gift of Christ's presence it's from the bosom of God into your bosom into your heart the very Mind Of God into your heart and there's not a lot of witnesses sitt there going whoa whoa look at that what just happened right they all can just see it God just took something took his hand out from his bosom and deposited something into that sister's heart and everyone's talking about it these things are secret God's Great secret that was in his mind is in the hearts of the believer what was God's once great Secret in his mind before the foundation world is now made manifest great secret great secret think of it oh my I'm sure we don't we don't get it well I can't see it the way ought to and I'm sure you don't and I say Amen but God's great mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ then given right down to his church what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church his bride Whispering secrets to her in the secret place of the stairs that's not a public show in a private place I want to see your face I want to hear your voice I want to whisper secrets to you and this is quite a statement making love to the church might have some devotion material there for the families going forward he says you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you tell just tell the secrets and get her up next to you and you love her and everything you know how it is I think he clarifies this very specifically about your wife he says that's what Christ is doing to the church he's letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these flirters I mean his wife by having the revelation of his secret made known to them by his grace a gift that's manifesting the presence of God those are my words a gift that's revealing the secret how the grace of God and then just to know this statement here just reinforces what brother bram's trying to express that bedroom that private place the most holy place he says how the grace of God I hope you don't think this sounds personal to a bunch of people or this that but the secret that God is sharing with the whole church if they would just receive it in a crowd I hope I'm not just being too plain he said I hope this doesn't sound personal to so many people but God is now Whispering love secrets to his [Music] bride that's the day and age we're living in that's your that's your strength to Fly Above leod deia that's the joy you need in the face of so much Melancholy it's the power of God you need in the face of so much sickness and depravity this world's absolutely insane I sometimes wonder if my thinks I'm going crazy because we talk about political events and things that are happening and I just engage in it from a political perspective and kind of engage in an intellectual Academic Way and it's kind of like there's no way in the world you could justify killing somebody I'm like oh well that's not what I'm doing you I'm just kind of getting in the mind of it from a legal standpoint and intellectual standpoint but we just need to take a step back say this world's insane right absolutely insane if very could well could be somebody named after a Mario Brother's character could change the Health Care system by murdering the CEO like that was wrong you shouldn't do this the world's insane they've gone absolutely insane there's no peace anymore my sister Elizabeth and I were fellowshipping on how there there there's a there's sometimes there's a really clear minded thinking for some people in the world as they take a step back and recognize the dangers of social media the the the debilitating corrupting nature and power of pornography and how life is becoming such degraded and unreal and people are acting upon the impulses and influences of a mob and it's taken away their agency where now we're just all being driven around like dumb cattle and they recognize and it seems so clear-minded but then their solution is to 3D print a gun and put a bullet in somebody's head it's like well that's just as insane you're you're you're part of the mob you're you're part of the mind you're you're succumb to it because there's no sanctuary in Christ to look at all go oh my goodness the horrors of social media what's my boy going to do as he keeps growing what what's going to happen to my daughter how what's our excape I'm so glad to know there's a place I'm so glad to know there's a presence I'm so glad to know that there is a power of Christ in this end time that can clean that can wash that can deliver that can set free where I can lay my hands on a Son of God and say there's liberty from pornography there's liberty from sickness there's liberty from these addictions and know that it's real and in the sermon God's gifts always find their places think of that sermon I think I I think I might have included this slide hope I did because I wanted you to see that title God's gifts always find their places and his presence wants to find its place its rightful place in this hour and he says may the great Christmas gift the great Christmas present rather Christmas present the first and the only and original and the only one there is Jesus Christ be a fresh in your heart tonight it's what I want I want to be fresh something about life that just you just begin to feel a heaviness fellowship with brother Matthew Watkins earlier this week and there like we we find ourselves sometimes just thinking oh whatever whenever this happens right be the reset the freshness will come and that's when things will change and once you get there it's something else and it's always wow if I could just fix this if I could just do that if I could just move if I could just pay this off I could just that then then we'll kind of get around the corner and I feel like I live my life from one hump to the next to it's like ah if I can just get over that one and you get over it and it's like okay well there's another one coming but if I could just have him be aesh I've been thinking a lot about Christmas dinner [Music] I'm cooking the prime rib in the sense that in this hour we've been invited to a feast remember the statement right there full Square Mill it's all seven courses for all seven seals are open we are feasting on the unfailing body word of the son of man the fresh kill and we begin to find over and over again where it speaks of his presence it talks about where the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered I will come in and suck I will dine I will commune this is an hour where it's fresh that's what the believer wants he wants it fresh I pray the same prayer that brother bradam prayed here in God's gifts always always find their places May the gift of Christ's presence be a fresh in your heart tonight may the great Christmas present or the Christmas presents the first and only original one there is on that day when that baby was born of a virgin Jesus Christ may he be fresh to us tonight let's stand and pray together let's pray this prayer Lord May the the Christmas present Jesus Christ be a fresh in our heart tonight if there was a voice in this hour that declared to us a secret of God then Lord I want to I I want to identify that place I want it to find its place in my life and I I go so far as to say this as we've already been touching all around this this gift that has manifested the presence of God you become a gift of his presence as you welcome and receive the word let's pray Heavenly Father tonight as we have brought forth this word and shared these things and there's an intensity behind it Lord there's things that were read in the scripture and events referenced in history recent history and that pertain to brother brandham and statements that he made that I believe we must be confident in sharing so that the hearer can be accosted even if it is a confrontation with the word because you spoke of how there would be a voice to attract and to call out and your presence beckons us it calls to us there's a come away my [Music] love Lord even as the song was sung recently I believe even here quiet me let let Peaceful Waters Flow may I learn to be still I want to hear you and feel you Drawing Near I want to see your face I want to hear your voice and help us Lord in the business of this life through our hurts our complexes our scars Lord I know that there's things preached and I that can cause us even to begin to hold our breath and just seize up because it's it's getting so near to things that maybe we've been told are wrong or we've seen it misused and abused and we just begin to tense up and we're worried and we're anxious I say oh God may we just trust that your spirit will lead us and guide us that you'll bring the balance you'll you'll make things clear that Lord if a man of God wants to put a period on it father you've taught me well enough as a Believer to just leave the comma and walk in the light and watch more unfold not try to interpret it myself but believe the word of God say Amen to it and pray for Revelation and so Lord is there so much that might cause us to be anxious and bound up it could very well be keeping us from a deeper walk with you so father we pray as David prayed show me your face let me see you in your word May the Bible continue to become a new book to me that when I read the letters when I read the chapters when I read the verses you could speak to me in a present tense voice that when I I listen to the message of the hour Lord I'm able to get past all the scarecrows that have said it's just neuroticism I can get past all the scarecrows that have made it bromism I can get past all the scoffers and mockers and I can recognize that you are revealing yourself back to you your personal presence in your bride for a Rapture in the Rapture age in the bride age and yes it's a secret because father we can't go to a convention at some address and find this presence just because it's in that building we can't just go to some headquarters and believe we're in it we can't just identify ourselves with some church or shake shake a preacher's hand there must be a personal revelation of you to ourselves individually and we must come into Union with you oh God help us in this L deyan age in this this this way that will please you and be an accurate reflection of your presence father help us to overcome Lord of having many conversations in my family and with other brothers how do we appropriately apply a standard in our home when years ago it just would have been as easy as keeping something out but now Lord we we have the state paying for iPads and Mac computers and screens and all sorts of things that we could use not just for school but for all sorts of things and Lord just playing house or digging a hole and building castles in a sandbox Lord those things just don't seem to work anymore for children and so there's just always so so many things that just invite connection points to the world and father we need to know we need to know how to lead our children to protect our hearts so we can do it in a way that our lives become a signal to others who are raising kids who need to find a way hungry Hearts who are hurting the last seed that's living in 2025 in this coming year not looking for an agrarian cult who's moved off the grid and no longer uses electricity and surviving so after solely off off a bee pollen or something and that's going to be a voice Lord we got to have a way to live it in Leo DEA that others would see the beauty of this masterpiece and long to know the creator of it so help us to give the right expression to it father pray we pray for each one I pray that that I ask tonight Lord that this church would pray more for me my family and Lord give us a Grace now in light of these truths in light of these things give us a Grace to know you to hear your voice to recognize modern events made clear by prophecy our day in its message what is the attraction on the mount who is this mzc it is the rising of the sun we love you and we ask all this in the name of the Lord Lord Jesus Christ amen
