TRANSCRIPT
========================================
If you could just give the title there, brother John, for a moment before we uh begin with the statement from Satan's Eden, but this is the title is descriptive for a reason. It's vulnerability and our need for security. Um I wrestled a lot in terms just exactly what title to use. I felt being descriptive was important and even each word is was critical just expressing this to you at the outset in addressing vulnerability and our need and the necessity uh for security. And we chose security for a very specific reason. We hope to uh amplify that a little bit. But uh if you want to jot that down and keep this in mind, vulnerability and our need for security is what we're looking at under the the umbrella of perfect love. And as we've already read these scriptures here, we're wanting to address God's perfect love for us and even our love that is being perfected. And so I think there's just a lot of meat there for us to chew on and a lot of things to fellowship on. And I wanted to begin by reading a quote that I think we've referenced in every service in this series so far. Speaking of Adam and the woman, they were holy veiled. They were behind a holy veil. God had placed them behind the word and that was a protection and a barrier for them. and a boundary. And they said they were safe in God's pavilion. And so safety um is kind of a little bit of a kinship to security. And these is this is how God uh was dealing with me in this. They were safe in God's pavilion. They were alive. They had no death around them. They had perfect love one for the other. So that was to each other. Perfect life forever. They had perfect love, perfect understanding of the love of God. They had God's word and kept it. So we can see that they understood God's love and had a perfect love for God because it manifested in obedience. And then he repeats uh what he said just a few moments before. And they were alive and safe in God's Eden with no death at all around them. And what I want to draw from this very specifically and looking at they were safe in God's the secret of God's presence. They were in the security of God's pavilion and where there was safety. It was preserving life. And so this perfect love is kind of the middle of this that they have for each other that they understand of God. And this perfect love created a place of safety for them. And it was a place of perfect trust and confidence in God. And those are themes we'll just kind of continue to emphasize of trust and confidence. Now, this is going to be maybe a um a hard turn here. And I I want and it's just I this was maybe I can't remember just exactly where initially I was going to have it. It was going to be maybe at the end, but I'm wanting to move it now uh to the beginning despite all this perfection in the Garden of Eden. And we could read about how sublime it was and how perfect it was and uh and everything in order and everything working in harmony. Despite the perfections of the Garden of Eden, there was still a vulnerability that existed. Though there was they were safe and they were secure and they were alive and they had perfect love one for the other and a perfect love for God. Despite all the perfections, there was still a vulnerability. And so God had warned Adam and the woman of the dangers that were lurking in the garden. He had told them there there's things that you must obey. There's things that you must heed. And we know that when God placed them in this place of perfection, and I referenced this because I hope to come to the unconditional part maybe here in the future, he had specifically placed them on a conditional covenant. Now, that doesn't mean the perfect love was conditional. doesn't mean God's favor was conditional, but there was conditions to that uh given to them in that setting that they were in and there were certain promises given and there were certain uh things that were made available to them, but they couldn't bypass the provisions of God. They couldn't work outside of the protection that God afforded and then feel that it was without consequence because after all, it's perfect love. And so I'm just acknowledging that despite the perfection of it, there was a devil that was present, there was a serpent that was going to be possessed by that devil. And so there was dangers that were lurking there in the garden. And I would even go so far as to say because I think this is part of the burden that I have uh today. Despite the one flesh that the man and the woman shared in this wonderful union that steps forth in chapter two, their union was, and I'm just stating the obvious because we know the outcome of the story. Their union was obviously vulnerable to deception. Their union was obviously vulnerable to unfaithfulness. So this is something I want you just to think in the outset. It was perfect love. It was they were safe. There was safety in God's love. There was safety in love one to another. But yet despite that, there's some vulnerability. And even their union was susceptible to or vulnerable to unfaithfulness. Now, just to hopefully say something that uh qualifies that or conditions that enough to where you can move on with me and not just get hung up on that. And I think this is a key. For love, for full love, for true love, for charity, for God who is love to be fully manifested, God had to make humanity vulnerable. So perfect love just could not be God by force. And perfect love could not be God by constraint or by barriers and boundaries and all sorts of things just kind of cage man up. And so here he is, he's just kind of locked in a cage of perfect love. A and he's an involuntary love slave and he's there he is in the garden just on autopilot. uh doing things that pay honor to God and fulfill his word. God had to place man on the basis of self-will and and he did that in order that true love would be made manifest. Now, not only his love for us, but a love for him. He couldn't just program it and bake it into creation. He had to put it upon a basis where there would be those that not only did he cho choose, but they choose him. And so, for love to be fully manifested, there had to be vulnerability. there had to be uh um the susceptibility to unfaithfulness. And brother Bam even in the church age book says when Satan had worked out that which was necessary to God's plan. So this was necessary. Now uh to refocus us on our subject today, vulnerability and our need for security. We're we're using we're wanting to understand God's perfect love better. That's at the heart of all this is understanding God's perfect love better. And what we're looking at in some of these very specific things is removing the barriers. Uh you know how that perfect love removes the barriers so that our love can be perfected. That God's love is committed and and it's going to work and going to move. And perfect love is removing barriers to perfect our love. That maybe that's just the thesis statement through even this service today. these four services and at the core of this if I somehow get away from this and and you start looking more at uh you know a different dimension of this love everything that I'm saying is intended to understand his love better and that's at the heart of this and so I want to I want to say this at the outset make this part of the foundation the love of God and we'll look at the love of God from two aspects this is just me using a language so that I can understand it and hopefully this helps you to understand it that the love of God is vertical in the sense of the love of God is his love for us and our love to him. And so we're wanting to look at the love of God that way. How does how do we understand God's love for us? How do we show our love to him? And so there's a vertical relationship of the love of God. But then there's also a hor horizontal aspect of the love of God and that would be the love among us, the love from me to others, the love between us and other people. So there's a horizontal uh aspect and relational aspect of the love of God, a vertical, but then there's also a horizontal and in the uh like I say this, our love is imperfect in the vertical. Probably should have had a little bit more hearty amens there, but maybe the self-awareness is just too strong. But there is a imper our love in the vertical is imperfect. His is perfect in the vertical. His love is perfect. Our love is imperfect. And our love is imperfect in the vertical and even more imperfect in the horizontal. So the love of God is shared between us and the Lord. But then there's also a love of God that is horizontal between us and others. And it's even more imperfect in the horizontal. Now we use this phrase vulnerability and our need for security because I'm wanting to look at two related elements that are critical factors both in the vertical and the horizontal. And the most important I think is the vertical. his understanding his love for us and the love that we have for him back. But then it it manifests in the horizontal as well. And so there's two very critical elements in the horizontal and vertical love of God. Now I want to define vulnerable and uh so that in a way that kind of comes to the root of the phrase because to me it was so perfect for how the Lord had burdened me. The the word vulnerable comes from in the late Latin the word meaning wounding. So think of how vulnerability speaks about pain. It's from the Latin to wound, to hurt, to injure, to maim. I it means to strike or to wound. So to be vulnerable uh it speaks of a wounding. It speaks of pain. And I want to say this at the very very beginning. As human beings, we cannot love without experiencing on some level pain. It is impossible to love without there being some injury as a result of loving. And so it is no uh surprise, it should be no surprise that if you're going to be looking at love, at some point you have to begin to look at wounding and injury. And as we experience the wounds of love, this is I'm saying it at the outset. I'm just going to hammer this home for the rest of the service. As we experience the wounds of love, we might desire to never love in order to avoid the pain. Because we we recognize this isn't correlation. This is causation. That in my capacity to love or even in the sense of being loved that there has been in that some wounding, some injury. I've been strick stricken by it and I've experienced pain as a result of loving. I've experienced pain as the result of being loved. And it may be because of this wounding an instinct to say, well, I would just assume never love again to avoid the pain of love. And so when we use the phrase vulnerability and and and I I sense and know that this will be very real and and and if some of you are thinking this would be very real for someone, you might as well just own it that you're that one and you know who I'm talking to, right? And you can all say amen. Someone someone say amen. There we go. So vulnerability means the susceptibility to physical or emotional attack or harm. And and and that's maybe the phrase is just obvious. If someone's vulnerable, they're open to attack. If someone is if there's a vulnerability, it's this susceptibility to injury, susceptibility to harm. And and I think that we can all agree instinctively we don't like it. Instinctively we don't like vulnerability. that it we don't like being open to attack. We don't like being subject to harm. If there's any kind of susceptibility to physical and emotional harm, uh we instinctively don't like uh that feeling. And vulnerability uh runs against our desire for security and the human need for safety. And those are two different phrases uh really that have different implications today. I'll use them in different ways. But if there's in our if we're vulnerable that kind of works against this base instinct as a human to be safe that I if we sense some vulnerability there's this human instinct to want to guard against vulnerability uh just from a a survival instinct. And I would even say that security and safety implies some protection from danger that you are vulnerable to. So, I I'm reminded of a story I heard one time where a guy was sitting on a street corner here in Phoenix and he was flipping a coin and whistling and some guy came by and said, "Uh, what are you doing that for?" He said, "I'm keeping the elephants away." The guy said, "Man, there ain't a elephant within 2,000 miles of you here." And he says, "It's doing a really good job then, isn't it?" And so, THERE MAY BE SOME things that we're we're doing because we're trying to protect ourselves, but there's no threat. There was really no vulnerability. So, that isn't necessarily keeping you safe. So even security and safety really are only relevant if there is an actual danger. Safety and security only mean something if there is a legitimate vulnerability. Now safe as an adjective just means free from danger. If you're safe, you're free from danger or I think more appropriately as we mean it today, not exposed to danger or pain. One might say like a safe investment. Someone might say if it's safe, they're what they're talking about is well there's really no risk here. there's really no risk of loss or injury. And that's maybe the idea we think in terms of being safe. And safety is that freedom or immunity from harm or danger. So it's not saying that it doesn't exist, but there's some immunity from it. Doesn't mean that it's not looming, but there's some freedom from it where you're not exposed to that danger. You're not uh you're not at harm uh uh uh placed in harm's way. So safe and safety kind of speak of the the harm or the injury, the safety or the immunity from it. But security a as we'd like to define it is similar in the sense that it's a condition of being safe from danger or harm. So these are kind of related phrases and and I don't want to get too deep into this but our need for security and our desire to be safe in instigates many actions cause us to act on many different levels and and to do many things to save ourselves from loss to save ourselves from injury. So this base human need for safety and this desire to be secure uh causes us to act in a number of different ways and this is very important. If you're taking notes I'd find some way to jot this down. This base human need a this human condition and even if you want to call it a human weakness is at the heart of God's design for love and faith. This base human need is at the heart of God's design for love and faith. It is a it it is a necessity that that uh faith and love are a necessity as a result of our human need for safety and security. in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5:es 8-9 and I'm reading this uh kind of to or to re-emphasize how we're taught in the message how that faith and love are relation and we'll see them here married together but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for in helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Notice how the breastplate is of faith and love. That they are forged together as one thing. And that together they form protect the for they form the protection of our hearts and our life. That is is symbolic of even our emotional state and our well-being and our our our physical state of being. That there is a forged together. Faith and love form the protection of our hearts. and love which is speaks of affection and faith which speaks of trust and confidence are working together. That is the the it's the breastplate of faith and love. It's not just the breastplate of faith. It's not just the breastplate of love, but this is something that's used to show the relationship between the two and they're forged together to make one piece that together they form a protection. and and this faith and love working together, love which is affection, uh faith which is trust and confidence, they work together to protect us. A and to protect life. But now if you want to think about the opposite would be fear and doubt. And fear is a withdrawal, some a repulsion, a turning away. And doubt is a a distrust. So those are the opposites to faith and love, fear and doubt. And we see here in this scripture that faith, hope, and charity are working together. And we could take not a number of scriptures now in the in the view of faith, hope, and love. And how that they're all working together using scriptural terms to make us not ashamed. Amen. That they're working together to cause us to not be fearful of judgment, TO NOT BE AFRAID OF REJECTION. Because he says the breastplate of plate of faith and love and the helmet of the hope of salvation. Why? We have these things for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation. So we're saying these things are our shield and they work together from US EVER FEARING THE WRATH of God. Amen. I hope this helps us with in the vertical and there are a number of scriptures that are constantly if maybe constantly is not the word it's only if you keep reading it but it's consistently the Bible's consistent in addressing our human complexes about fear uh complexes and fear about love and trust it's this isn't psychology uh in in a negative sense and I'm very careful to use the word in a positive sense too. I know what can happen if you do that. But there's the scriptures consistently address our our human condition and and human complexes, human fears and human perceptions about love and trust. And if you want to begin to look there, we're not going to come to it just yet, but in First John chapter 4, I I want to say this before we read it again because I'm wanting us to look at this. If I could say even from the standpoint of vulnerability and and recognize that the need for emotional security and the need for emotional safety is at the heart of affirming God's love. Amen. That that God is affirming his love not so much that it's just something to do, but it's done because it meets a need. Right. Amen. And that the emphasis and even the way that God chooses to express his love to us and repeat it and affirm it is as a result of our need for emotional security and emotional safety. And within a relationship, emotional uh safety would just speak of a relationship that's open uh where both people are open among each other uh where you're vulnerable to each other. you're trusting and and and if there if it's NOT IF THERE'S NOT EMOTIONAL SAFETY where we're vulnerable, we're honest, we're trusting. Uh then if there's not that emotional safety, then it's distrust and suspicion. And that's that would be the condition of an emotionally safe uh relationship. And I'm not afraid maybe to use modern parliament. Maybe parliament isn't a modern word to use uh modern slang or language or phrases or buzzwords. Uh uh a as we huddle here as a church. I'm not afraid to use these phrases because there's a certain way that maybe the world talks about these things, BUT THE BIBLE'S TALKED ABOUT IT LONG BEFORE THE world did. And science is still just stumbling around in God's great laboratory. And so this emotional safety is one thing to where it things are open and trusting and we understand one another. But then there is a emotional security which ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT THE SAFETY of the relationship but emotional security. This is critical I think for me and trying to express this. These are things I've been wrestling with for some time TO MINISTER ON THAT EMOTIONAL security would be you being at ease with being vulnerable. that a a relationship there can be emotional safety and there's openness and there's honesty and you recognize you're vulnerable and you're YOU'RE SUBJECT TO ONE ANOTHER AND THERE'S MUTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY but security EMOTIONAL SECURITY BEING I'M at ease with that because there are situations where the opposite of that is insecurity and insecurity is I'm not at ease being vulnerable there are certain dynamics and things and structures and relationships and phrases and things that trigger me and I feel I feel uneasy AND I FEEL VULNERABLE AND I'M INSECURE WITH BEING VULNERABLE. And so to use a phrase I think that would be kind of the uh the the trendy word would be psychological safety. And I believe the Bible is addressing psychological safety. It's the state of reduced interpersonal risk. And I know you all understand that. So I'm just going to define it for myself. I'm just going to say, "Hey Google, if you could define for me what in the world is interpersonal risk." but has to do with your feelings of selfworth. So if there's psychological safety, it's your emotional well-being. It it's the way you view yourself. A and the reduced interpersonal risk is I I am not afraid of the loss of one's favor. I I I'm not afraid of be respect being lost. I I I'm not afraid of losing my social standing that I can and it's more of a buzzword within corporate structure that we want to create an environment uh that fosters creativity and hard work and allow people to try a a and to be ambitious and so you don't create AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE IF somebody makes MISTAKE EVERYBODY'S LIKE [screaming] RIGHT AND everybody's laughing at the dude in cubicle 4 who just messed everything up but everybody's like hey we like it when you try we like it when you ask questions and and so psychological safety means that I can I can try. I I CAN DO MY BEST and and I can ask questions and I and I'm not afraid UH TO BE MYSELF UH BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IF IF I DO make a mistake OR IF SOMETHING'S WRONG, I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE FAVOR. I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE RESPECT. I'm not going to lose social standing. So when someone FEELS THAT THEY'RE IN A PLACE OF emotional safety or even they're emotionally secure, IT HAS TO DO WITH THE person's self-esteem and and their own value and the resulting FEAR OF REJECTION OR the resulting FEAR OF BEING SHAMED FOR MAKING MISTAKES. I I think we should we should be thinking very hard about this just how easy just how instinctive shame is as a tool. And and I believe that if you have a relationship with shame, you ought to break up right now. And so the reduction of interpersonal risk as it relates to emotional security and being an emotionally safe relationship in the vertical and even in the horizontal. This is important to realize that just to be emotionally safe or even emotionally secure to be in a place of psychological safety does not imply the lack of consequence. It does not uh require the lack of consequence. There is where there is emotional safety and emotional security in a relationship. It means that there's no fear of rejection, no fear of shaming, but it doesn't mean that there's not a consequence that may need to be addressed or worked through. But it's about creating an atmosphere of trust. Amen. Where we're not shamed. We're not rejected for failure. We're not subject to embarrassment for doing something wrong. And I've used a language that hopefully some of you can relate to because it's exactly what John is addressing in 1 John 4:16 to18. He says, "We have known and believe the love that God hath to us. God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him." He's wanting to affirm the love that God hath to us. And on the basis that we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. He says herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment. Remember that phrase because as he as he is so are we in this world. There is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment. I want to I'm wanting to unpack this. We've been doing it slowly and hopefully incrementally to where it's more impactful with each step. And I think today we're going to take another step that is liberating. A and if you haven't fired off that miss up to shame yet, you're you're going to maybe be able to form just the right words to say, "Shame, it's time for you to leave because I'm not subject to it anymore." He said, "There's no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear BECAUSE FEAR HATH TORMENT." JOHN'S JUST BEING RAW ABOUT THIS. WHY DOES PERFECT LOVE CAST OUT FEAR? LET'S JUST BE HONEST. FEAR HATH TORMENT. HE THAT fearth is not made perfect in love. Now focus on this. And I say focus intently, not so much in the sense that we would ponder it a and just dwell on it, but really try to grab a hold of this. The fact when he says there is no fear in love, it's specifically referring to not fearing God when it comes to his opinion of you. That's good. because it says that we might have boldness in the day of judgment. Right? There is no fear in love. SO WHEN HE SAYS there is no fear IN LOVE, I KNOW WE JUST immediately think in general. Now when it comes to love, there is no fear in love. And if there's ANY FEAR OR DOUBT, THEN I DON'T HAVE LOVE AND and it kind of causes that cycle of questioning and that litmus test. But he says there is no fear in love. And he's SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO JUDGMENT, WHICH IS GOD'S OPINION OF YOU. And so he says, "BECAUSE FEAR HATH TORMENT." AND THIS TORMENT HE'S REFERRING TO IS THE ANTICIPATION of deserved punishment. Please just uh UNBBURDEN YOURSELF OF ANY SUSPICIOUS intent on my part. and and and even if you would QUESTION MY MOTIVE, TRUST IN A GOD THAT CAN STAND BETWEEN me and you and give you what you NEED BECAUSE I WOULD SAY THAT THE REALITY IS YOU NEED him to speak to you and you NEED HIM TO SHARE THESE things with you AND I WOULDN'T WANT EITHER OF US TO GET IN THE WAY. AMEN. AND SO HE'S SAYING THAT FEAR HATH TORMENT. AND SO THERE IS THIS TORMENT is this anticipation of deserved punishment. And we know this is true that if you anticipate punishment, it's a foretaste of it. Come on, kids. Where's the amens? Right? When you know a SPANKING IS COMING, IT'S JUST AS BAD AS THE SPANKING. AND and to the child protection services by spanking we mean grounding you from IPADS WHEN YOU KNOW it's coming YOU IT IS ALMOST AS BAD AS IT AND SO PAUL IS SAYING FEAR HAS TORMENT AND FEAR OF PUNISHMENT COME ON LISTEN FEAR OF PUNISHMENT IS ALMOST THE EQUIVALENT OF THE PUNISHMENT SO GOD WOULD [screaming] NOT WANT YOU HE DOESN'T WANT TO PUNISH YOU NOR WOULD HE WANT YOU TO BE IN A STATE OF ANTICIPATED IT BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT EVEN THAT EVEN THAT ITSELF IS A FORETASTE OF THAT WHICH you don't deserve. And therefore fear is self-punishing. It is as if we lock ourselves in a cage that we beat our own heads against. And if we fear God, this is what this is what John is addressing. If we fear that God will shame us, if we fear THAT GOD WILL REJECT us or abandon us, then John is saying his love is not perfected in you. Right? So, do you recognize that when we use the litmus test that there's no fear in love and we think of the horizontal or we even think of this part of the vertical, we're looking at it wrong. He's saying that when it comes TO HIS LOVE FOR YOU, you ought not TO FEAR HIS LOVE. YOU OUGHT NOT TO BE AFRAID OF HIS OPINION OF YOU. THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF GOD AND HIS OPINION OF YOU, THEN CLEARLY HIS LOVE HASN'T ACCOMPLISHED ALL THAT IT CAN and will accomplish for you. It's not even evidence. You can't even use it as evidence he doesn't love you. You can't use it AS EVIDENCE THAT YOU DON'T LOVE HIM OR YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT JUST MEANS YOU HAVE NOT YET FULLY benefited from this perfect love. So he is not referring to doubt and fear and anxiety in general. But when he says THERE IS NO FEAR IN LOVE, HE'S SPECIFICALLY referring to his love for us and our love for him. I almost feel that we could just start the griddle. You know, Go ahead. Please sit down. Don't Whatever you do, stay in your seat, Mother Michael. But fear and doubt now again they are related. And so God is recognizing this. He doesn't want there to be any fear of his love. Amen. And and no fear of your love for him in that because the opposite fear and doubt are related. And just as you cannot have faith without love, you cannot have doubt without fear. Fear without doubt. And so the word is addressing our own complexes and fears when it comes to love. John is using a language that's honest about vulnerability. He's using a language that's honest about security. AND SO IN FIRST JOHN CHAPTER 3 verse 20, this is in the prior chapter. And I think this is this is connected with John is kind of reinforcing in the next uh the next verses in the next chapter in and and I want let let me reset that recognize how the word is addressing right security vulnerability safety trust and the trust issues that arise and the and the suspicions and fears that humans have and even how we have fight orflight responses or freeze and and there are certain things kind of baked into us by evolution and BY GENETICS THAT WE'RE GOING TO ACT INSTINCTIVELY in certain ways and when we perceive threats or when we see things that are triggers that human beings JUST HAVE A A WAY OF ACTING A CERTAIN WAY AND SO GOD is kind of approaching us in a way saying look I get it right being very cautious I understand these are things you're going to have to wrestle with and so John says in 1 John 3 20 to 21 remember there is no fear in love and perfect love cast out fear IT'S TO CAST OUT THIS FEAR OF GOD so recognize Is it that we could be under this slavish fear and this self- BONDAGE AND THIS SELF-PUNISHING A AND this tormenting fear that I deserve punishment. I I deserve to be rejected a as a way of being conditioned through all the narcissistic relationships we're SUBJECTED TO THROUGHOUT OUR LIFETIMES. WE COULD ALMOST TAKE ON THE MENTALITY THAT WELL I HAD IT coming and so I have it coming. 1 John chapter 3 20- 21 says, "For if OUR HEART CONDEMNTH, GOD IS GREATER THAN OUR HEART and knoweth all things." So he's wanting to loose burdened hearts WHERE IT'S THE SELF- CONDEMNING HEART. IT'S THE HEART THAT HAS A HARD TIME MAYBE LOVING GOD. IT'S THE HEART THAT HAS A HARD TIME ACCEPTING GOD'S LOVE FOR US. HE'S SAYING, LISTEN, IF YOUR HEART'S CONDEMNING YOU, IT'S NOT GOD THAT'S CONDEMNING YOU. THAT'S YOUR HEART CONDEMNING YOU. THAT'S FEAR WHICH HAVE TORMENT CONDEMNING YOU. AND GOD KNOWS ALL THINGS. AND HE PREFACES GOD'S LOVE FOR YOU AND HIS A AND HIS GREATNESS IN THAT IT'S NOT THAT YOU KNOW SOMETHING GOD doesn't like man if he only knew the thoughts I had I know you love me but if you only knew what I did last week right AND WE THINK THAT SOMEHOW UH WE'VE HID SOMETHING FROM GOD THAT HE'S not aware of and AS SOON AS HE FINDS OUT UH WHAT KIND OF SKELETONS WE HAVE IN OUR CLOSET BOY HE'S DONE AND HE'S OUT BUT HE SAYS BELOVED IF OUR HEART CONDEMNEST NOT THEN WE HAVE CONFIDENCE TOWARDS God condemn it means to find fault with TO BLAME OUR HEARTS ARE ACCUSING ourselves and IT'S LIKE THIS SELF-PUNISHING FEAR FROM EXPECTING HARSHNESS EXPECTING REJECTION AND EXPECTING TO UH TO BE SHAMED FOR DISAPPOINTING God if a heart condemnth God's greater than a heart and he states the obvious and think if your heart's not condemning about God and you're not worried that he's going to reject you. He's going to shame you. He's going to be harsh. He's going to be brutal and he's disappointed in you and we're disappointing God. Says, if you could if your heart can be unburdened from that, then you can have confidence towards God. Amen. Because you're not letting your incorrect perception of his love keep you from trusting him. And if I could say this, God knows that love and having that unbburdened free love and have this confidence, this trust towards God, he knows that this kind of love makes us feel vulnerable. So he's speaking directly to it. He is telling us that if our hearts do not condemn us, then we have confidence. Confidence that we will be heard because he speaks about then your make your request known. And we have confidence that he'll hear you. We have confidence to ask. WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT WE'LL BE HEARD IN NOT SHAMED OR JUDGED or or rejected in and and we when coming to HIM IN BEING OURSELVES WITH HIM. And a condemned heart is just simply one that doesn't feel secure. The heart that says, "Well, I deserve punishment or I don't deserve this love. Well, this is what I have coming to me. I I guess this is what I I'll suffer with." And and I I'm always remissed to share maybe my personal testimony. But it took me a long time as a son of God to to fully recognize that in my relationship with God, I always had this fear that I would be abused and uh rejected by him in the same way that I was by others that I loved or loved me. Right? I might have never consciously said it, but yet there was this instinct of you're going to get what you deserve or you don't deserve this. And it's this shadow that can haunt you. And God had to bring me to a place to realize that if he loved me, if he's ever loved me, HE WILL ALWAYS love me. AND THAT GOD IS NOT A NARCISSIST. AND THAT GOD IS NOT PLAYING WITH MY EMOTIONS. AND GOD ISN'T TOYING WITH ME IN ORDER TO manipulate me. BUT THERE'S NO GUILE. THERE'S SUCH A PURITY AND HE'S SAYING, "LOOK, I I MAY HAVE SHOWED MY HAND PRETTY EARLY ON, AARON, but I love you and I'm committed and I mean, I've given YOU THE WEDDING BAND OF PREDESTINATION AND I'M I'M COMMITTED TO YOU AND I'M NEVER GOING TO GET UP GIVE UP ON YOU." AND SO, I MEAN, MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE KIND OF SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD THAT TO YOU. SO, MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED BY FEAR TO SERVE ME ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE. BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW IN THE HOPES OF MAYBE MOTIVATING YOU THAT HEY, GET UP. TRY. SAY YOU'RE SORRY. DON'T STOP FIGHTING BECAUSE I'M WITH YOU AND I'LL NEVER GIVE up on you. YOU MAY QUIT ON ME, BUT I'LL NEVER QUIT ON YOU. YOU MAY STOP AND WALK AWAY, BUT GUESS WHAT? I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU AS A SHADOW BECAUSE I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU OR FORSAKE YOU. EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE DAVID SAID, "IF I MAKE MY BED IN HELL, THERE YOU ARE SAYING." AMEN. I got you. I'm with you. We know that there's no greater pain in life than that of unrequited love. We know that probably nothing leaves a greater stain or scar or wound than an unconditional love that is unrecrocated. probably no greater betrayal than a trust that is not mutual. And when we love unconditionally in in the horizontal and we're rejected or rebuffed or it's not returned, it wounds the human spirit. God knows this. Amen. And he knows we've had these experiences in love. And so he reminds us over and over again that this is not so with mine. Romans 8:35-39, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" I want you to think about these words from the standpoint of one who's wanting you to be emotionally secure, emotionally safe, wanting you to be in a good place mentally and emotionally. He's wanting to address complexes and fears. Let's look at this not so much of the truth of it, but why God said it, why he would address us this way. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword. As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. He's using the language of one who is wounded by love. He's using the language of one that knows rejection. He's using a language of one who understands that we can have complexes when it comes to commitment. That we can be a little bit suspicious like, "Yeah, I know you promised. Pinky promised, crossed your heart, swore, whatever it was, you know, blood brothers, whatever it might be. We've we've swore ON THIS COVENANT. YEAH, I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE. I I've heard till death do we part. I I've seen THE PROMISES. I'VE I'VE HEARD THE VOWS. I I'VE BEEN THERE, DONE THAT. I I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE FOR THOSE THINGS TO BE SAID. AND SO THERE'S THIS AFFIRMATION OF GOD'S LOVE WHERE HE'S SAYING, LISTEN, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE LOVE OF GOD. It is IMPOSSIBLE TO BE DIVORCED FROM THE LOVE OF GOD. AND HE'S USING A LANGUAGE THAT MIGHT BE IN A LANGUAGE THAT SEEMS TO SPEAK OF MORE OF MEDIEVAL TIMES OR SOMETHING, BUT IT'S A LANGUAGE OF ONE THAT'S BEEN WOUNDED BY LOVE. IT'S THE LANGUAGE OF ONE WHO'S BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN COMMITMENT. IT'S A LANGUAGE OF ONE WHO KNOWS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IT LIKE TO BE REJECTED. And these are things in the vertical. But in 1 John 3:1 for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another. To love God adequately is difficult enough. I would say complex and we make it complicated. So to love God in itself, that's a that's a tall task for a human. But to love one another with the perfect love seems unreasonable. And yet that's what John's concluding. We've known and believed the love that God hath to us. And fe there is no fear in love. And perfect love cast out fear. And there's this there's this washing and conditioning and qualification and centering of the horizont the vertical relationship of God's to us and us TO GOD. BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT. SAYS, "THIS IS THE COMMANDMENT you've heard from the beginning, that we should love one another." Faith and love to God have the power, just kind of maybe backing up to to set this love to one another. Faith and love have the power to release us from the prison of fear and doubt of loving him. So faith and love are washing us, freeing us, delivering us from fear and doubt of loving him and his love for us. Amen. And if I CAN SAY THERE'S NO RISK IN LOVING GOD. AMEN. So I was looking at the words of safety and security. There there's there's no risk in loving God. HIS LOVE IS A SAFE LOVE. It is a love that is true. It is a love that will not disappoint you. It is a love THAT WILL NOT BETRAY YOU. It is a love THAT WILL NOT REJECT YOU. IT IS A LOVE THAT WILL NOT SHAME YOU. God's love is corrective, but it is not shaming. Amen. God's love MAY REBUKE US, BUT IT'S NOT EMBARRASSING US. But our hearts can be hardened by the wounds of love. And we can be fearful of trusting. We can be reluctant to risk trust. And so to command us to love one another is not a riskless act. And God knows this. He's constantly affirming our love, his love for us so that we would be safe in loving him. and that there's no risk in his love. BUT NOW TO ASK US TO LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE, WE RECOGNIZE THAT MAKES US FEEL VULNERABLE. TRUE. Can I get a witness? To love God. MAYBE WE COULD BE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, YEAH. ALL RIGHT. I can love God. I I can do this." And his love, the Bible says it's unconditional. And the message tells me I'm justified. AND WE COULD KIND OF GET KIND OF AMPED UP TO ACCEPT HIS LOVE. AND I THINK I'M GETTING THERE. I can receive his love. I think I'm going to get there. I think I'm get there. And it's like, and you've got to love him. And you're like h yes Jesus loves me right this this part makes us vulnerable but this is why loving one another is predicated on loving God us loving him and him loving us that HE IS NOT ASKING US TO LOVE ONE another unless we have first known and believed the love that God has to us That's good. And that we KNOW HIS LOVE FOR US AND THAT WE ALSO LOVE GOD. And that loving one another is an extension of love we have to God. Otherwise, love isn't love. Amen. I I I I'm going to read a scripture to you very quickly. I don't even know if I'll explain it. I'm not going to say anything more than read it, but I'm going to throw this out there lest anyone twist what love is into something that it's not. Because Jesus said, "If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and his wife and children and brethren and sister and yay and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple." We cannot avoid the duty to love one another. And I this I'm saving this for the sermon on love hate, but There's many who might find it easy to hate their dad. It might find it easy to hate their mom but very difficult to love. And therein lies a problem because we cannot avoid the duty to love one another because we must love as Christ loved us. John 13:34 as it is written in first John how this is the commandment you've heard from the beginning and even the new commandment that John is referring to. He says, "A new commandment I give unto you." Jesus says, "That you love one another as I have loved you, that you also love one another. As he loved, we are to love." So, IT'S NOT SO MUCH JUST SAYING LOVE one another. And so, we could have OUR VISION OF LOVE AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND what brotherly kindness is. And there's kind of this love that we have, but yet there's A LOVE THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE ONE FOR ANOTHER. And I would say that it is an act of love and it is a submissive love because it is a LOVE THAT WAS BOUND BY GOD'S WILL FOR HIM AND FOR THE PERSON AND EVEN GOD'S DESIRE AND PERFECT will for the others. So it's not something that's UNRESTRAINED AND SLOPPY. WE REALIZE that love has limits just based upon what the scripture teaches us. But this is a love. The love that he has for us is a love that we ought to have for others. Couple chapters later inif chapter 15 12 and 13. This is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you. So he's giving some sort of qualification to what this love ought to look at like. AND HE SAYS, "GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN than this that a man lay down his life for his friends." Amen. Remember how that perfect love to a to a Jew carried with it the idea and the love of God. And this kind of love carries it with the idea of loving when it's hard to do so. It means loving when you're at the risk of rejection. Loving when you're at the risk of hurt and pain. And that's why Jesus tells us that we're to love our enemies, to do good to them that despitefully use us. And Paul says, "What good is it if you do good to them?" Jesus teaching, "What good is it if you do good to those THAT LOVE YOU? WHERE'S YOUR REWARD FOR THAT? WHAT WHAT IS IT LOVE?" RIGHT? WHAT'S WHAT'S LOVE IF YOU SAY, "WELL, I REALLY LOVE THIS GUY, AND MAN, ISN'T THIS GUY AWESOME, AND ISN'T HE GREAT? MR. BILLIONAIRE WHO LIKES TO GIVE ME STUFF, RIGHT? And everybody's kind of like, I don't I don't know if he really loves him. I mean, the guy's kind of ugly, right? I mean, and we're like, it must be love or money. I had a friend one tell me one time that his wife married him that she wanted a man that was funny, good-looking, and rich. AND HE SAID, "ONE OUT OF THREE AIN'T BAD." And I said, "I didn't know you had a sense of humor. [laughter] But perfect love when he asks us to love one another, it's not just with this, it's not a fantasy. Love is ugly and chaotic. And it would be easy to instinctively recoil from love for our own protection because love in in the in asking us to love one another. John knows IT'S A NEW COMMANDMENT. JOHN KNOWS THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. IT WAS EVEN KIND OF THE CRUX a with the argument with Jesus AND THE LAWYER TO WHERE IT'S LIKE, WELL, WHAT'S THE GREAT COMMANDMENT? WHAT ARE THESE GREAT and all the law and the prophets? Hang on. Uh, love thy Lord thy God with all thy soul, heart, and mind. LOVE THE LORD THY GOD, AND THY NEIGHBOR, love thy neighbor as thyself. There's the key that you can't love your neighbor properly if you love yourself improperly. And so THERE THERE IS THERE'S something there even in as you love yourself, BUT EVEN IN THIS LOVE. AND SO WHAT WAS THE LAWYER'S RETURN? WELL, who's my neighbor, right? You you'll force me to love somebody I don't want to love and and I want to pick and choose who my neighbors are. AND SO THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME SENSE that it's a recognition that to love somebody else is a is is a UGLY OR IS A HARD thing in Colossians chapter 3 19. I I I'm just introducing this into the record as we'll be able to call back to it later. BUT PAUL SAYS, "HUSBANDS, LOVE YOUR wives and be not bitter against them." That means angry or irritated. Don't be harsh. AND SO PAUL, IT MIGHT SEEM ODD, let let me just play um devil's advocate or let me just kind of take the other side to say that if HE HAS TO TELL you to love her, then you don't love her, right? I mean, haven't you been told that before? Like, if I have to tell you how to treat me good, then you just don't love me. And if I have to tell you what to do, and you should just know how to do it. And you know how people talk to one another, right? That's how Elliot and I go at it. Well, if you RESPECTED ME, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK. HE'S LIKE, WELL, IF YOU LOVE ME, you wouldn't. No, there there's just a WAY THAT WE TALK TO ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE WE LIKE TO WE KIND OF LIKE TO SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO tell you, right? AND, YOU KNOW, IN SOME WAYS, IT'S KIND OF like actually you do, right? Help me out here. I love you. I want to make you happy. How can I do that? And it's not like, no, if you if you love me, you'd know exactly you'd know exactly what I want. You know what they're going? Oh, God help me. AND SO PAUL IS PAUL IS SAYING IT JUST FROM THE PLACE OF HONESTY. Husbands love your wives. And husbands like yes that's right. I SHOULD LOVE MY WIFE. BUT PROBABLY THE MOST TELLING PART IS HE SAYS AND BE NOT BITTER AGAINST THEM. PAUL is acknowledging THE TEMPERAMENTAL NATURE OF HUMAN EMOTIONS. THAT WITH THE SAME HEART THAT WE LOVE IS THE SAME HEART THAT GETS JEALOUS. AND WITH THE SAME SPIRIT WITH WHICH WE LOVE IS THE SAME ONE THAT GETS FRUSTRATED. IT'S THE SAME ONE THAT CAN GET BITTER AND HARSH AND IRRITATED. SO PAUL IS ACKNOWLEDGING THE TEMPERAMENTAL NATURE OF EMOTIONS. AND IF I COULD SAY THIS, HE SAYS, "LOVE YOUR WIVES AND BE NOT BITTER." HE'S SAYING, "HEY, I KNOW IT'S not easy. Not just to love your wife, but to love your spouse. If I could say this, maybe there's a reason to be bitter." But here he offers no way out or excuse. HE HE IS ALMOST ASSUMING HUSBANDS LOVE YOUR WIVES AND MAYBE YOU HAVE CAUSE TO BE BITTER, BUT DON'T BE. I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EXCUSE TO BE BITTER. I'M NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO JUSTIFY YOUR BITTERNESS. I AM NOT GIVING YOU ANY ROOM TO SAY, "WELL, THEY DID THIS OR THEY DID THAT." HE SAYS, "LOVE DOESN'T MAKE ROOM FOR BITTERNESS TO TAKE ROOT." He's saying you got to love when it's when it is easy. You got to love when it's not hard. LOVE DESPITE THE HURT. LOVE DESPITE THE PAIN. HUSBANDS LOVE WHEN IT'S NOT EASY. If I could say this, as I hope to come to it as we continue in this, he's saying because it's worth it. And and if I could say, isn't that why we even have it? Isn't that what the love is there for? That the love isn't there necessarily when things are going good. I I mean, the love isn't there when what's being cooked is awesome because you would eat anything from anybody who cooks something awesome, right? The love is there FOR THE TIMES WHEN THINGS ARE GOING WHEN THINGS ARE ROUGH. LOVE IS THERE FOR THE TIMES WHEN TRUST IS BEING CHALLENGED. LOVE IS THERE FOR TIMES WHEN YEAH, MAYBE I AM A LITTLE BIT UPSET AND MAYBE THINGS HAVEN'T WORKED OUT THE WAY THAT I WANT THEM TO IN THIS MOMENT. BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHEN LOVE THAT'S WHAT LOVE IS FOR. AMEN. So he says, "Husbands, love your wives and be not bitter against them." And then in Ephesians 5:25 and 26, husband, love your wives. And then here's the great qualification. Even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it. This is where you can see that love is messy. And I don't want you just to think that this is speaking to the husbands. I'd say this to all of us. Spouses must embrace the hard side of love. The vulnerability of it, the risk in loving, the risk and the commitment. Because it says, "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church." church and then it just doesn't kind of let it float out there in the ether for us to interpret it. He says and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word. Paul is acknowledging again that love is hard that loving is difficult that it comes with pain. It comes with commitment. It can come with loss. Just as Christ suffered loss for his for love's sake, he is saying that we also must risk the loss because it's giving, it's sanctifying, it's cleansing, it's in other words, this is it's something that you work at that if it's if it's easy and and I recognize this that in in any relationship that I I think we've said this before that a a spouse should never say to the other one, uh, well, if you had my job, Right? Because trust me, you don't want hers. And so whenever if you say, "Well, I have to go to work every day. Go. I have to go to work every day." And it's like famous last words, right? That it's at that point maybe you've started the blame game and it just gets ugly from there. There's something to realize that in in this in this this working in this labor and the suffering that we might say, well, well, the husband has to love his wife as Christ loves the church. And so the husband always has to be Christ, right? And so then we can always say, you need to be Christ. And we can always say, well, you need to be the church, right? And so it almost just kind of creates this re we're repulsing one another. So if it if I could say this at all to understand and recognize the duty maybe some of the washing and cleansing are the very things that we've caused that realize that we have to be dedicated to cleansing and to washing and make a commitment to but Paul is acknowledging that even in love it's work and that we got to embrace the hard side of love even as Christ suffered for his own love's sake. Bible says in Isaiah 53:3, he is despised and rejected of men. Is despised and rejected of men. A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised and we esteemed him not. These are not the actions of one who trusts. We hid our face. This is fear. This is doubt. This is the distrust. This is the distancing. This is not the affection AND THE DRAWING TO. This is the turning away from. This is the fear. This is the doubt. THIS IS THE REPULSION. HE IS DESPISED AND REJECTED A MAN. HE IS A MAN OF SORROWS AND ACQUAINTED WITH GRIEF. BUT DESPITE ALL THESE OTHER EMOTIONS THAT HE HAD AND BROTHER SAID EVEN THE OF ALL THE HUMAN EMOTIONS THAT HE DISPLAYED THE MOST, HE DISPLAYED THE WEEPING. Thank you Jesus. A man of sorrow acquainted with grief. IF ANYTHING THAT OUGHT TO DESTIGMATIZE SORROW AND GRIEF. But though he was characterized AS A MAN OF SORROW, BEING DESPISED AND REJECTED, the Bible says, "The Father loveth the Son and giveth all things into his hands." There's a love, there's the trust. And I want to point out THAT THOUGH GOD LOVED HIM AND COMMITTED all things to him, God's love did not protect him from heartache. It's maybe the paradox that the love of God required a sacrifice of his own life. And in God's love to him and his reciprocal love to God, he willingly laid his life down, but he trusted that God would raise it up. Amen. GOD'S LOVE DID NOT PROTECT HIM FROM HEARTBREAK. GOD'S LOVE DID not protect him from the pain of loving. Nor did the rejection release him from love. THAT THOUGH HE WAS DESPISED AND REJECTED. Though he was CAME TO HIS OWN, HIS OWN RECEIVED HIM NOT, JESUS did not COULD NOT REFUSE THE ACT OF LOVE. JESUS COULD NOT SAY, "WELL, I CAME AND AND THEY HAD A VOTE AND GREATER THAN 51% VOTED against me and and and THEY DON'T WANT ME ANYMORE IN THEIR ASSEMBLIES AND THEY'VE KICKED ME OUT OF THEIR SYNAGOGUES AND THEY THEY'VE TURNED THEIR BACKS AGAINST ME." The rejection did not release them from the love's obligation. help us even to where when he came to his crucifixion in John 13:1 said having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end. Jesus having derived his confidence from God's love for him was confident and loving and even despite the agony and pain of the cross where even there on the cross he cried my God my God why hast thou forsaken me. Do you realize we cannot use the excuse of rejection and loss and pain in the wounds of love to avoid loving? Because even in this act he recognized that there would be a forsaking from God. But he trusted in a God who raises the dead. He was so confident in the love of God that no matter what he faced, what he went through, what he endured, love was worth the risk of the pain. It was worth the risk of loss. in Proverbs chapter 31:1. I'm I'm coming to my closing uh my closing uh focus here. In Proverbs 31:1, it's speaking of a virtuous woman and it uses a phrase I believe that is very remarkable. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil in the flow of the chapter. Her resourcefulness and her ingenuity and her faithfulness puts the husband in a place where he does not need to res resort to thievery or or uh fraud or deceit or easy gain. that he's not being overworked and he's not worrisome. He knows that with what provision he has and and her faithfulness and how she can use it. He just he trusts her with what is what it has and what she can do. And it says the phrase is safely trust in her. It adds this other element of that whenever there is trust in another person, does not the Bible caution us that we put confidence in no man? But yet the challenge is if you can get the people if you can get the people to believe and have confidence in you and how important confidence is in the horizontal relationships. He says the husband's heart safely trusts. And why does it say safely trust? Because anytime there's confidence there's the risk of broken trust. Anytime you trust somebody, and I hope I'm not pulling the curtain back on trust, but anytime you trust somebody, you make yourself vulnerable to being deceived. Right? That's how some of the best that's that's at the heart of what people call the best pranks. At the end of the day, all the person simply did is trust you. Haha. Right? I just all I just believed you. You told me and I just took you at your word. And so it's that act of trust. If you trust somebody, it makes there's a risk of being deceived. And when the Bible SAYS IN HIS HEART DOTH SAFELY TRUST IN HER, IT USES THIS PHRASE TO SHOW THAT LOVE IS NOT WITHOUT RISK. THAT LOVE IS NOT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. THAT WHEN THERE IS TRUST PLACED IN SOMEBODY THAT THEY'RE PUT IN THE POWER OF YOUR TRUST. THEY'RE PUT IN THE POWER THERE THERE'S SOME VULNERABILITY that you're exposing yourself to. And I would say that there WHAT WE'VE COME TO ANYMORE is that people want things related to love without the risk of love. They want to experience love without the consequence. THEY WANT TO HAVE IT WITHOUT THE RISK. And I would even go so FAR AS TO SAY THAT many of us through innocence and through the things we've endured experience may tell us that it's better not to trust so that we're not deceived. And we might say, WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST BETTER NOT TO TRUST LESS WE BE DECEIVED. I WOULD EVEN ASK THE QUESTION, WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER THAT TO OFF BE deceived and to know real trust than to never know trust at all? And so our experiences may tell us that, you know, I there's no such thing as safe trust, but in that there's a danger of constructing a means of protection against God's commandment to love. THAT I'M I'M I'M FINE WITH WORKING ON THE VERTICAL. I'M FINE WITH YOUR LOVE FOR ME AND MY LOVE FOR YOU. AND AND I WOULD LOVE TO GET VERY CULTISH ABOUT THIS where uh we could just HAVE THIS PERSONAL LOVE AFFAIR AND BE ABLE TO LOOK DOWN UPON EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT this and they're not ordained to it and they're NOT ELECT AND AND THEY'RE ENEMIES OF THE CROSS AND THEY HATE THE WORD AND THEY'VE REJECTED THE MESSAGE. AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE JUST TO ENJOY THIS. BUT it's in this PART THAT WE REALIZE SOMETIME OR WHAT WE DO SOMETIMES IS WE CONSTRUCT THE MEANS OF protecting ourselves against God's commandment that we love. In Proverbs 25 19 says, "Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint. If we let's just say the Bible's saying the pain of betrayal is real that when you count on somebody and you trust in somebody and they let you down, it hurts. Confidence in an unfaithful man, it's not to say that you knew he was unfaithful beforehand. It's just confidence in one and maybe I safely trusting and all of a sudden things turn around and and this is when I need you and this is when things are important. It's like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint. NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH SAYING THAT UNFAITHFULNESS uh um IS THE PROBLEM, BUT IT'S AT THE TIME YOU NEED IT THE MOST. When there's unfaithfulness, it's a broken tooth. It's a foot out of joint. That when you you need it to perform a function, when you need it in the moment that it counts and the betrayal is there, the pain is real. And when it once it fails, you'll be reluctant to use it again. Just as it is with those who've experienced chronic pain, they find that they favor. If it's a broken tooth, you you're not going to rely on that side of your mouth, you're going to chew on the other side. If it's a foot out of joint, you're going to favor the other one because you've experienced the sharp pains. And maybe you've done it more than once. I'm not going to make that mistake again. It kind of builds to this place to where one is reluctant to rely in trust because the memory of the pain. If I could say this, I'm hoping to be winding this down to a close. And again, this kind of points to the the the the way that Christ says that we must hate. If you hate not and come after me, you're not worthy. That there it's it speaks to where how strong love is. And the stronger the love, the stronger the confidence, the greater the capacity for pain and betrayal. I mean, let's just be honest. If you go you everyone here, if if Brother Mike and Sister Maddie were trusting me to give them a million-dollar check as a wedding gift, I mean I mean I'm I'm pretty sure they're not going to be really hurt. I mean, like too terribly hurt. You know, they don't get anything from me. Like, I mean, I shouldn't have done it anyways, right? I should have never trusted, you know? I didn't have any reason to believe that he had a million dollars. You know, there's a there there's some something there that when the it's the magnitude of trust. It's the magnitude of confidence. It's it's ONLY BEC IF I COULD SAY THIS FOR some grace in our relationships we have with one another. We only HURT EACH OTHER BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH other that much. The stronger the love, the greater the capacity for pain. But then also the greater capacity of of pain when we are betrayed. When we are betrayed by love, we retreat from it as a means of protecting ourselves from it. It's a means of safety that it's within this framework of trusting that I find myself hurt. It's in this framework of making myself vulnerable, that I find myself being taken advantage of. It's in this framework of trying to work on love and and loving and and GIVING OF MYSELF AND AND and trying to forge this union and this is any any kind of relationship that might BE IN THIS HORIZONTAL THAT WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES BEING HURT IN THAT, WE JUST AS SOON RETREAT from it and say, "Nope, not doing that again." as a means of saving ourselves. And I would say that sometimes it's necessary for us to heal. It's necessary for us to catch our breath. It's necessary for sometimes to disengage a little bit and get some distance to learn, GET OUR FOOTING BACK underneath us. But listen, if you retreat for too long, the idea of loving again can be very scary and our our idea of what it means to be safe can become very very distorted. this it was from these studying these things that I was struck with how that whenever religion and whenever church loses sight of God's love it becomes very unsafe and we can retreat into church service and we can retreat into service to one another and we can retreat to all the elements and the accutrants of church service and church function all without the love of God and without service to God and so our idea of what is safe can become very distorted Ed, you know, they say, and I'm sure that some have seen this and experienced this, that an animal that is caged for a short period of time cannot wait to be escaped from it, to escape from its prison. That cage for a short period of time that once loosed, it runs out. But take an animal and cage it long enough and you can open the door and they'll stay trembling in a corner, fearful of what what is in store for them outside the cage. And I believe that even for us sometimes who retreat from loving or being loved, we find ourselves in that cage. And if we stay too long, even with the door open, we're fearful of leaving it. And the wounds of love can cause scars, complexes that we hide behind. And we say we're doing it to protect ourselves, but we're doing it to our own harm. This is wonderful pregame talk right before we eat burgers and hot dogs. just working up a great appetite. Man, I've just never been more hungry in my life. Such levity and such lightness. And what a beautiful sermon for newlyweds. I don't know if it's dawned on either of them, but there is a moment when you recognize that marriage makes you vulnerable. The mutual commitment and trust. I could even say this. Your pastor went to great lengths to let me know you weren't moving here for me. She's move. She moved sister Mattie moved here for brother Micah. And when when when brother the more brother Micah realizes that, the more he realizes how vulnerable his wife is and how important his love for her is and how how strong it needs to be. This is just being unaware, self-aware of our commitment to one another, our mutual dependency, and these things. And so I'm sorry if it's not maybe not the uh the right kind of sermon to feed on before we want to enjoy lunch together, but it's very real what we experience as human beings, our vulnerability and our need for security. In the book CS Lewis's book, The Four Loves, he makes these statements that I just couldn't find any other way to express it than just to read it. I hope you can listen to this. It's very, very impactful. There is no safe investment. To love it all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will certainly be rung and possibly be broken. If you WANT TO MAKE SURE OF keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies AND LITTLE LUXURIES. AVOID ALL ENTANGLEMENTS. LOCK IT UP SAFE IN THE CASKET OR COFFIN OF YOUR SELFISHNESS. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It'll not be broken. It will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. THE ONLY PLACE OUTSIDE heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perputations of love is hell. You don't think loving is risky? You don't think the risk of love has caused some of us to retreat. And what happens is we get hard and we say, "I'm not going to get my heart broke again." Come on. Is anybody going to back me up on this? Don't be afraid just to own it. We know that in life, and this doesn't have to necessarily be in our marriages, it can be before our marriage. And we come into marriage with a lot of bad relationships with our parents or with our siblings and with other people and other relationships and uh uh infatuations and dependencies we had in through our adult life. AND A LOT OF THESE THINGS AND WE CARRY EVEN OUR CONDUCT in engagement AND COURTSHIP. WE CARRY OVER THESE COMPLEXES AND FEARS and we've come to have these real iron dispositions AND WE'VE HARDENED OURSELVES AND WE DO IT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT OURSELVES. WE DON'T WANT TO BE VULNERABLE AND WE THINK THAT SOME WAY MY HEART'S NOT BEING BROKEN AND WE'RE LIKE, "YEAH, YOU CAN'T BREAK MY HEART. YOU CAN'T BREAK MY HEART." YEAH, MAYBE IT'S NOT BROKEN. THAT'S TRUE. BUT IT CAN'T EVEN be penetrated. It can't be moved. And we think, "Well, I JUST WANT TO BE SAFE." The only place outside of heaven you can be safe from loving is in hell. It's what CS Lewis said. And if I could close with this thought, the wounds of love will never heal heal without love. Only love can heal the wounds that have been caused by love. Both in receiving his unconditional love for us, the love we have to receive his unconditional love for us and then also his absolute forgiveness. But then also the wounds of love cannot heal without love even in our loving and forgiving others. Does not the Bible teach us how is it that we can accept his forgiveness and then hold unforgiveness in our heart towards others? Hatred, bitterness, unforgiveness can never heal or erase the scars from a vulnerable love. Can never heal or erase the scars and the wounds from being taken advantage of by trust. If I can say this, I just have a one more scripture I'd like to read because of vulnerability and and if I haven't made this clear in you have to embrace vulnerability at some point. Security is being at ease with vulnerability. It's not the absence of danger. It's not the fact that there is no danger. It's the fact that you recognize the risk. You acknowledge the danger. But I'm good with it. I'm at ease. And and I would say that God even recognizes that his love is pretty scary when you think about it. And what he asks us to do and he asks us to trust and he he kind of lays out the future and we don't know exactly how it's going to happen, but he just wants us to trust. He's he's on the other side of it saying, "I know from your vantage point, this is scary, but maybe you need to kind of accept the risk and the vulnerability because if you don't kind if you don't if you DON'T WRESTLE WITH THAT AND AREN'T WILLING TO ACCEPT IT, you're never going to get to where you want to be in my love." But it's because of this vulnerability and the insecurity that we have. I hope that you can catch this. Because of the sense of vulnerability and our insecurity, there's parts of your heart that have never been loved. That's just a summation of doors and door. Brother Brandon preaches about these doors of the heart and how THAT THERE'S PARTS TO our hearts the doors closed off limits. And we don't realize it, but we have these compartments, these places in our lives, these areas in our lives to where WE HAVE CLOSED IT OFF. AND BECAUSE YOU'VE HID BEHIND THE VULNERABILITY BECAUSE YOU'VE HID BEHIND THE PROTECTION OF NO, NO, UH, I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE AGAIN. I'M afraid to do it. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. I've been there. I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE. I'VE SEEN HOW THIS ENDS. I DON'T WANT TO DO IT. BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE THAT. LISTEN, there's parts of your heart that HAVE NOT BEEN FELT THE LOVE OF GOD BECAUSE THE door shut. And if I could say this then if THERE ARE PARTS OF YOUR HEART, YOUR MIND, YOUR THINKING THAT JOHN IS SAYING, HEY, IF YOU STILL FEAR GOD AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HIS OPINION OF YOU THAT HIS LOVE HASN'T COMPLETELY WASHED YOU AND PURGED YOU, IF THERE'S PARTS OF YOUR HEART THAT HAVE NOT BEEN LOVED, THEN THERE'S PARTS OF your heart that have not loved. And I express that in a way of encouraging you. And I'm encouraged, I'll say this, a a as a father, I'm encouraged to know there's parts of my heart that can experience the love of God so that I know there's greater depths of love that I could show to my children. To know THAT THERE'S PARTS OF MY HEART THAT EXPERIENCE the love of God SO THAT THERE'S MORE LOVE THAT I CAN SHOW MY WIFE. I'M HAPPY TO KNOW THAT IF THERE'S A PART OF MY HEART, A DOOR THAT I'VE SHUT BECAUSE OF THINGS I'VE EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE, IF I COULD JUST TAKE THE COURAGE TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND LET THE LORD IN, THAT THERE'S A PART OF MY HEART THAT CAN LOVE IN A WAY THAT I'VE never loved before. If you invert the wisdom of Proverbs 29 25:1 19, confidence in an unfaithful man in a time of trouble is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint. If we end inverted that, I think there's an inversion to this that the power of love and trust really shows itself in times of trouble and loving GOD AND TRUSTING God in this kind of reckless abandonment. I know that there's uh I think we've all heard the the song that Brother Maverick City or whoever it is, Brother Bethl wrote on reckless love. And uh that and I think initially I mean some people are kind of changing it to precious love and it's just funny how sometimes we try to sanctify some of these songs you like when heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss. I mean they couldn't even play that on contemporary radio stations and now I'm hearing cuss words in Christian songs and BUT YET TO ME IT'S LIKE YEAH YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT IS RECKLESS. I love you and nothing you can ever do will change that. really nothing. How fast you say the Audi could go, right? Nothing. Nothing I can do. Yeah. And that FROM A CERTAIN STANDPOINT, YEAH, IT'S RECKLESS. AND AND THEN TO LOVE HIM IN THE WAY THAT HE WANTS US TO LOVE HIM BACK. I KNOW THAT WE REALLY RECOGNIZE just how much he loves us. The more that we realize he loves US, THE MORE INADEQUATE OUR LOVE TO HIM BEGINS TO FEEL. BUT IT'S RIGHT THERE WHERE HE BEGINS TO TELL US, "OH, NO. YOU don't understand how much that means to me. Said, "BUT LORD, YOU LOVE ME. You did this for me. YOU DID THAT FOR ME. YOU DID THIS FOR ME. You did that for me." It's like, "Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't understand the how much it means to me that you love me back." Amen. YOU DON'T YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. JUST YOU JUST THAT THAT CONFESSION, THAT DESIRE, I KNOW YOUR HEART. YOU YOU CAN NEVER DO FOR ME WHAT I DID FOR YOU. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. DO WE NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THE PARABLE OF THE OF THE ONE WHO FOUND THE TREASURE THAT WE'RE NOT THE ONE THAT FOUND IT? WE'RE the treasure. YES. LIKE THAT'S HOW HE FEELS ABOUT US. HE'S LIKE, "LISTEN, LISTEN. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN LISTEN JOSHUA. I SOLD EVERYTHING TO HAVE YOU. WOULD YOU HAVE ME?" AND YOU'RE LIKE, "YES, I DO." AND HE'S LIKE, "YES, YES." Like he HE HE WANTS TO HEAR THAT FROM US. WE'RE LIKE, "I DO. YOU'RE GREAT. YOU'RE GOD. IT just doesn't MAKE MUCH SENSE." AND SO I REALIZED THAT FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT, loving him and trusting him makes us feel very vulnerable in times of trouble. And in times of weakness, we don't feel that way when everything's going great, but it's in times of trouble. But it's in that moment, in the time when we're wanting to kind of uh hide. It's in the moment when we want to withdraw, that's when his love pays off. Amen. It's in that moment of I'm kind of I'm in that in that in between when it's like, well, everything's going great, BUT NOW EVERYTHING'S FALLING APART. AND IT'S IN THAT MOMENT, IT'S LIKE WE START TRYING TO RETHINK things like, "Wait a minute. Where's all this trust got me? What's happening? I I I I was trusting the Lord in this, AND I WAS TRUSTING THE LORD IN THAT, AND NOW EVERYTHING'S FALLING APART." AND AND AND GOD'S LOOKING AT YOU SAYING, "YOU'VE trusted my love all the way to this." Why would you why are you getting nervous now? And he's saying the the FACT YOU YOU TRUSTED MY LOVE AND IT'S GOTTEN YOU THROUGH ALL THESE THINGS AND GOT THAT'S WHY YOU'VE ENJOYED ALL THESE THINGS. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE. YEAH. Things are starting to maybe get difficult and hard and things are LOOKING REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT AND NOW YOU'RE STARTING TO DOUBT. NO, THIS IS THE PAYOFF TIME. AMEN. Like this is the moment when you need MY LOVE THE MOST. THIS IS WHEN YOU NEED TO TRUST me the most. My one of my working titles was full send. I don't know if it's just those who snowboard would know or skaters, right? The skaters get it. There's that. In other words, IT'S IT'S THIS idea of I'm risking it all. I'm just going to do the jump. I WHATEVER THE CONSEQUENCES ARE, I'M ALL IN. AND IT'S AT THAT MOMENT HE SAYS, "NOW DON'T ABANDON YOUR CONFIDENCE NOW. THIS IS THE PAYOFF TIME. THIS IS THE moment when you need it the most. THIS IS WHAT LOVE IS FOR. If you if you were only in IT FOR THE GOOD, IF YOU WERE ONLY IN IT FOR THE THILLS, IF YOU WERE ONLY IN IT FOR THE POPULARITY, you're only IN IT FOR THE BLESSINGS, YOU WERE ONLY IN IT FOR ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT I COULD PROVIDE. IF YOU WERE JUST IN IT FOR THE MONEY, NOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE HARD PART, YOU'RE LIKE, "NOPE, I'M GONE." RIGHT? But if there's love there, it's like, you know what? This is what love is for. Oswald Chambers said, "Faith is the deliberate confidence in the character of God whose ways you may not understand at the time." That's what why love speaks so much of confidence and trust. That's what faith is. And so if I could bring this around to there is no fear in love. We're acknowledging our vulnerability. And because we're vulnerable, we ought not to create our own means of protection that keep us from being loved and love loving. And in Psalms 56:3, I think you ought to read this as forever truth. Not just the words of one in the Old Testament or one who didn't know the love of God, but just read it as one as a permanent truth. What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. Fear isn't the absence of perfect love. It is what perfect love is for. At what time I'm afraid? I'll trust in you. In other words, I know this is the paradox and maybe it's just why in preparing this for these weeks. It's I wrestled with how to express it. There's so much paradox to this. We think there is no fear in love. No, there is no fear in love. So that if we have fear, there is no love. But if I could say it in a way that maybe doesn't make a lot of sense, if there was no fear, you wouldn't need perfect love. So the one the one has not nullified the other, it has given it a purpose because there is fear. God has a perfect love. If there was no fear, maybe love would be enough. There was no punishment. IF THERE WAS NO TORMENT, LOVE WOULD BE ENOUGH. BUT GOD KNOWING WITH THE SPECTRE OF FEAR, KNOWING WITH THE SPECTRE OF DISTRUST, KNOWING WITH ALL THE WOUNDS AND SCARS THAT WE WOULD GO THROUGH, HE KNEW LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH. ACTUALLY, PERFECT LOVE. This is what we need is this PERFECT LOVE. AND AT WHAT TIME I AM AFRAID? IT HAS NOT NULLIFIED YOUR LOVE. IT HAS GIVEN LOVE A PURPOSE. AT WHAT TIME I AM AFRAID? IT HAS NOT DIMINISHED MY LOVE FOR YOU. AT WHAT TIME I AM AFRAID? IT HAS GIVEN MY LOVE AND TRUST IN YOU. reason just as we pre HAD PREACHED BEFORE IN HOW THAT THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT GIVE PATIENCE A JOB to do. This fear gives perfect love a purpose. And if I could say this, even in the idea of the full sin in the moment whenever there's doubt, this is what the woman ought to have done in the garden. At the very moment she felt betrayed through the lies of the devil. At that very moment, that's when she should have trusted in him. At that very moment, at that very moment, he says, "Well, God may be hiding something." She should have said, "Then it must be for a reason. If he hasn't showed me, maybe I don't need to know yet. If he let this happen, he's only doing it for my good. At what time I am afraid, I'll trust in him. At what time things are going, I'll trust in him. And no matter what is true about what IS SAID, NO MATTER WHAT IS TRUE ABOUT WHAT IS DONE, THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF TRUSTING NOT NOT NECESSARILY THIS DEVIL, NOT NECESSARILY ADAM OR SOMEBODY ELSE, BUT IT'S TRUSTING HIM. THIS IS WHAT THE WOMAN COULD HAVE DONE IN THAT MOMENT OF QUESTIONING. I MAY NOT UNDERSTAND HIM. I MAY NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S DOING. BUT IF HE'S ALLOWING THESE THINGS TO COME TO PASS, THEN I'M GOING TO TRUST THAT HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. AMEN. AMEN. And listen, IT'S THAT VERTICAL THAT I'M TRYING TO EXPRESS. IF I IF MAYBE I BEGIN TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON THE HORIZONTAL, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH WE HAVE SO SUCH GREAT DIFFICULTY TRUSTING GOD BECAUSE OF OUR HORIZONTAL RELATIONSHIPS. AND HE'S CONSTANTLY HAVING TO address the misunderstandings caused by the horizontal so that we don't misunderstand the vertical. And I would say if trusting is something very hard for you to do. I know this is where people get nervous. They think that to forgive is means a certain thing and trusting means a certain thing. But I can say that it could be said, well, I mean, if you don't care, you don't care. If you're numb, you're numb. But if trusting and loving feels beyond you, then just fall into his love. Amen. Go full sinned. Risk it all. Because you'll never heal by running from love, but by just diving deeper into his love. Amen. And I acknowledge how scary it looks. Because even in natural relationships, commitment is scary. It's what makes different decisions in life uh so uh so hard and we wrestle with it whenever we're proposed with the risk-free transaction. Try it out. You know what? Don't even pay me. You just take it. Keep it. If you like it, just come back and pay for it. You know what we would do? Thank you very much. Right. Do you know my name? No. Do you know where I live? No. You have any cameras? Nope. Okay. I'm going to come back and pay for this. Right. Risk-free transaction. kind of like all you did with those loans the government was giving out, right? Never had a payroll in your life, but you had SEVERAL PPOS, RIGHT? YES. WOOHOO. KACHING, RIGHT? They're going to forgive it anyways. When it's risk- free, RIGHT? YOU JUST YOU JUST ENJOY IT. YOU JUST TAKE IT. AND WHAT MAKES DECISIONS DIFFICULT? The commitment, the cost, the risk. And so, EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE THINGS OF THE LORD, WE LOOK AT IT. WE recognize that it can be scary. But he calls from beyond the scariness. Even in that picture, right, Bre talks about that it looked like clouds and it looks chaotic and it looks dark, but then when you get closer, it's angels. And I know sometimes God's love looks really messy and chaotic. You're looking at it the wrong way. Because his voice calls you beyond it. He says, "You can trust me." I think maybe we've been the victim of too many trust falls that have become trust fails and we instinctively when it comes to love and it comes to trust even if we're not recognizing it we're operating under a complex or a scar or a limp and it keeps us from trusting God. And you won't heal by
