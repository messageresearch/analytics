TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 22 verse 4. i just want to read verse 4 and then jump right into it i'm uh supremely excited tonight i'm super excited to be ministering and so i'm so grateful for this opportunity that i have tonight genesis 22 verse 4 then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place so far off we know that god had told him to go into the land of moriah and now on the third day of travel then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place of far off let's pray our heavenly father we're grateful to be gathered together this evening as family the most precious family that we could think of the family of god and lord we share a common dna we share a common blood to be a part of this family we have to share a common experience and i'm grateful that we have this privilege as family together tonight and as you would be dealing with hearts even to become a part of that family lord we welcome those who seek a new birth experience without open arms lord we welcome those who are in search of healing we welcome those who have minds plagued with doubt and have questions and even those that just have uh perplexions in life and they're just seeking truth lord we welcome them because we know that in your word there's an answer for any need that a man would have any question that a person would have so father tonight we commit ourselves to you desiring that you take the bread of life and break it to us take this gathering though it may be humble in the eyes of man we believe in heaven this is a significant gathering and may we may that realization dawn upon us tonight as we feel your presence and your nearness to us now we take take these things father which we've read the things that will be shared and just harness them lord use them be in them father is a a power to set free and a power to encourage we ask this in the name lord jesus christ amen you can be seated our subject continues to be supreme faith revealed in abraham this is just the third service in this thought supreme faith revealed in abraham and i'd like to say at the outset that uh what i'm preaching tonight i would say if things kind of unfolded the way they normally would when i preach a series this is where i would end because often times when something's inspired to me i kind of see the end and then once i start studying it things start opening up to me and sometimes i never get to the end things just keep coming up in front of him but i'm usually chasing something that the lord has shown me a vision maybe that i have of a thought or a revelation that comes to me and then i just start digging into it and just thought after thought keeps building to it maybe at the end it just kind of completes this picture but as brother brennan made that statement about supreme faith and how to have supreme faith you have to know perfectly what you're doing and we've been preaching on a blind trust and bad faith when god dealt with me in the life of abraham and i started looking into his life what i'm preaching tonight was really what uh was the clincher for me and stood out to me in terms of what supreme faith is in this hour so i'm very excited to kind of preach this as maybe coming to the the punch line as it were or pulling back the curtain and say this is what we're talking about this is this is what ought to inspire us about the faith of abraham and then it just made a lot of sense to me this week and looking at it that if we could see that this is ultimately what god wants us to see in the life of abraham and then back up and start looking at his life it'll just help us to relate so much more to the supreme faith that abraham had he realized that if we just live a life that we're called to live and walk in truth and stay in the light then the supernatural things that are prophesied to take place in this hour will just happen as you're walking and as you just go forward in your daily life so we've been looking at the subject of supreme faith we've mentioned how that when we use the term supreme faith it might seem to be out of reach for us like oh well supreme faith that seems impossible it seems unreachable unreachable but really that's going to stem from a misunderstanding of what supreme faith is the way that we characterize faith and what faith looks like and we feel like well if you can't put your hands on a dead body and raise them from the grave then you don't have faith or if you can't if you can't create something by faith if you can't do certain things or speak in tongues then you don't really have faith and i would say that's faith being misunderstood to put your hands on a dead body and pray for them come back to life that's faith but if you've never had that chance to do so doesn't mean you don't have faith and so um it's something that is often misunderstood and i think this might be a perfect opportunity to mention that brother loyal has it in his will that if he ever dies that you have to first lay hands on him and try to bring him back to life again and so that's i don't know if that gets cut out of the will if you don't do it uh so but he told me that he has this clause in his uh estate that if you'd someone has to at least lay their hands on him when he's dead and believing in the resurrection and so we let the church know as our legal duty to honor that in case we come across loyal slumped body we want to lay hands on them and pray them back but we would say that if we were unsuccessful in calling loyal back from the dead that would not be because we don't lack we because we don't have faith oftentimes faith is just misunderstood that it has to present a certain way or supreme faith has to present a certain way but the example of abraham shows that supreme faith let's say a supreme faith is exhibited in laying hands on someone who's dead and bringing them back to life we don't go hunting dead bodies to try to manifest faith we just live a life of faith and if we ever come across a body that needs resurrection you're in the you're in the best place to do it and so we really see in the the faith of abraham the supreme faith the example of abraham shows that supreme faith will come by daily acts of faith brother bram says you're just in the routine of trusting god and you trust god and he fulfills his word so often that you just expect him to do it and that's really what abraham demonstrates his daily acts of faith to where god was constantly keeping his word and communion with him so it became a routine to expect the supernatural to see god keep his word and so using the phrase supreme faith revealed in abraham we're looking at how his faith is an example of rapturing faith and so supreme faith rapture and faith perfect faith those are all terms that we could use to create this upper echelon of faith and then we might feel like well i'll never get there it's only for certain people and and only for preachers that was only for the prophet and you're really selling yourself short because the reason why it was demonstrated in the life of a prophet is so that the bride could come to that that place of faith it may not reflect itself in this the specific gifts and the public ministry that he had but there was things demonstrated in his life and things that are left for us to read in great detail so that we could have faith to believe in the same god that we too by following the word of god can see the life of christ unfold in our lives so this rapturing faith is is the the faith that abraham is an example of and we know that as we looked at sunday how that abraham believed in a god that was personally revealed to him it wasn't a god his dad told him about it wasn't a god of ham sham or japheth of his relatives it was a god that made himself known uh to abraham and you'll notice that whenever they talk about the god of israel as a nation it's the god of abraham isaac and jacob and they don't say that god of terror they don't say the god of of nimrod they don't go and they don't say the god of adam it's the god that revealed himself to abraham and this is what makes his faith so distinct is that he had this very simple and and i'd like to even use the phrase pure faith it was a pure faith simple and pure faith towards god and he believed in god and so it was faith in the word this is something i think is so important to catch it was faith in the word that moved abraham when he left from earned the land of the chaldeas from the valley of shinar he he moved by faith he didn't move because his family was moving though his family went with them he didn't move because there was an opportunity for wealth though he did come into great possessions as god blessed him he didn't he didn't go as an explorer and as one who who was restless to see what was on the other side of the seas or one that heard of some fantastic sights to be seen in another land it wasn't exploration it wasn't adventure it wasn't curiosity it wasn't family it wasn't fame it wasn't wealth it wasn't um it wasn't some sort of position that was available to him it was faith alone and it's remarkable the way that god allows the story to unfold he says i want you to get up and i want you to leave your land your family and go to a place i'll show you later so that it's not the appearance of the place that causes you to get go if you'd shown them a land flowing with milk and honey and well watered planes and everything very beautiful and gorgeous you might have said well that makes a lot of sense i'll go there i kind of like i'd remark to my wife after we went and visited uh jackson wyoming a couple weeks ago and said well i think there's a reason why god waited till we had moved to phoenix and started a church there before he went to jackson because i probably said well jackson would be a great place to start a church and where two or three are gathered together and we just make sure that elizabeth i always made it to church and we'd have two or three gather together and a jackson whole church sounds he has a nice ring to it but uh it wasn't the appearance of canaan that drew abraham there it was god telling them to do it and then you look at the example of abraham and i'm i'm backgrounding this uh not not to add fluff to the to the message but just so that we're all kind of falling in these same tracks as god has dealt with my heart over these last few weeks that if you looked at abraham and we see what brother branham taught about him and even what the scripture says joshua's saying your fathers even tara on the other side of the flood worship strange idols and were idol worshipers and abraham himself not being a jew since the nation of the jews comes from the children of abraham he was an idol worshiper himself and that all of the world everyone having just re you know in the i say recent but just in the chronology built a tower to avoid the judges of god or dispersed throughout the earth due to and separated according to their different languages from the tower of babel and are worshipping false gods setting up false systems and false ways of worship and denying the true god and in our in in these uh uh false idol worship and so ma all of mankind and even abraham's family we say even himself are worshiping idols that can be seen building groves and erecting altars and worshipping the moon and worshipping the sun and fashioning images of things that would be idols that they would lay down before in worship and these were things that were to be seen and now all of a sudden abraham has a revelation an unction that cannot be seen by others he can't share it with them materially he can't express it to him in such a way to where they can see what he saw but god speaks to him through divine declaration and god has a revelation a way that he reveals himself to him whether it's dream or vision or some appearance he begins to worship a god that can't be seen and to me that's something that's very important to recognize about abraham's faith that matured to supreme faith is that in the midst of idol worship where people are bowing to the senses what could be seen and what could be felt he bowed to an invisible god and he worshipped the invisible supreme brother makes the statement in the masterpiece he's talking about how the bride is another masterpiece in the making she is the new testament as christ is the old testament and he makes this statement in the context of the seed being sown and coming to manifestation he says as a as he started in abraham after the fall of the first masterpiece he talked about god now started in abraham on a foundation to build another masterpiece so in looking at the life of abraham i just this to me stood out so tremendously that he is the foundation of the masterpiece christ and he's the he's the foundation of he's the mast he is the beginning of that masterpiece he uses abraham as the foundation of another masterpiece and so he uses the language of a seed being sown so the seed promised to abraham and we're taking from a lot of scriptures in the new testament that we haven't even looked at yet but the seed sown or the seed promised to abraham culminated in jesus christ because that's who this seed was that seed is jesus christ and just as jesus christ was the culmination of what began in abraham the bride is the culmination that began on the day of pentecost god birth in his church there's a culmination there's a climax to that this other masterpiece in the making so when we look at abraham as the foundation to build another masterpiece he is the seed then he's the seed that god sows or if you want to look at it as the seed of faith being sown in abraham reaching this ultimate manifestation in christ we have you look at the character of abraham of being associated with or holding that seed of another masterpiece and the seed is what holds the mystery of the plant so the things that are sown into abraham the faith that abraham has results in jesus christ the manifestation of jesus christ and so we can begin to look at the life of abraham and the promises given to abraham and see how god dealt with abraham the promise that god gave to abraham the experiences that abraham had and we begin to see that he held the mystery of christ and i'll come to something in the end very scriptural that just is very very evident in terms of how abraham holds this definite connection to jesus christ and he demonstrates something to us when we say we want to be like christ we want to live the life of christ we want to be christ-like christ is going to be born into manifestation in this hour and the full word is born into manifestation and we use these terminology you can go back to abraham to see the genesis of this we see tremendous examples unfold in his life now james chapter 2 verses 21 and 22 it says was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar these scriptures really solidified my use of the term supreme faith related to abraham because james looking at it from a different perspective than paul but yet both of them showing the truth in its full spectrum together is saying that abraham was justified by works when was he justified fully vindicated made made righteous by his works when he did this specific act when he offered isaac upon the altar so abraham always had faith he didn't find faith the day that he offered isaac up he always had faith but there's some justification some vindication confirmation that transpires in the time and it's the manifestation of the faith that had always been hidden in abraham or the faith he always professed the things that he always believed there was some something that stepped forward and manifested itself in abraham's faith so that anyone looking at his faith would say well he had the goods he believed what he said in this act as we see that his justification is from maybe the the works or the outward appearance and then he makes the statement seeing thou how seest thou how faith wrought with his works so there is faith that was wrought with his works and there was a working together and by works was faith made perfect he's asking us do we see this and so we could say that by works his faith was made perfect and faith made perfect it's a phrase that it's meaning reached full fully consummated development and one of the phrases used in the translations is supreme expression that abraham's faith had reached its full and supreme expression so by by this work it was a supreme faith expressed it had reached its full expression and it's remarkable that it would be in that work that his faith is justified or that we could say his faith reached its supreme expression so this is the question that i'm i'm going to answer tonight not not maybe uh exhaustively but the question is what is it about this act of offering up his son isaac upon the altar that justified abraham's faith how how was this an act of supreme faith how is it that james could say that in offering abraham upon the isaac upon the altar abraham's faith was made perfect so what is it perfect faith supreme faith and and so we're pondering that at this juncture now i want to read genesis chapter 22 verses 1 to 14. i this is maybe an exercise where i have to read it so that it's entered into evidence so this is being entered into evidence so that i can refer to it later because if i don't if i don't read it i'm always gonna feel like i'm lacking some key component here so this is one of the exhibits that's being offered into evidence by reading it i can just say you know here and after referred to as genesis 22 and everyone will be on the same page so in genesis chapter 22 verses 1 to 14 i i'm going to be i know you're going to pull on me to stop and want to connect things and bring things out of this but again i'm just entered into the record and we'll go into more closer examination and future questioning and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham of course he doesn't tempt him like satan does and said unto him abraham and abraham said behold here i am here i am that's the way it ought to be right he said and he said take now thy son this is an important phrase thy only son isaac and what is what is ishmael saying like brother randy likes to say hey what am i chopped liver i mean here's ishmael over there going you know what about me i thought i was his first son he says thy only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him therefore burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of you notice how this happens so often with abraham i want you to start doing something but i'm not going to tell you exactly where you're going yet and so there's an example from the very first time he calls him in genesis 12 now all these years later 30 something years later to where now he's actually uh saying you know what i want you to do this and i'm not going to tell you exactly where yet but you need to start walking and he says unto upon a mount which i will tell thee of and abraham rose up early in the morning saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went under the place of which god had told him so he's going to a place then maybe thereafter once he'd begun these certain things god tells him so there's a lot of activity there's actually at least two days of travel preparation and travel that are referred to there in verse three then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off the place that god had told him of and abraham said to his young men abide ye here with the ass so now he's going to be a separation from the servants and i and the lad will go yonder in worship and come again to you and we know that even in the language that he uses he doesn't he's not implying that he's going to come back by himself but he's told to go to the top of a mountain sacrifice isaac but yet he says i am the latter going up and we'll come back down again verse 6 and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and noticed the imagery that's being portrayed here and laid upon isaac his son the very wood that he was going to be sacrificed on isaac's carrying up the hill already pre-figuring what christ would do carrying his cross up mount calvary and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering isaac knew enough about sacrifices to know that the lamb was to be offered to the lord and he says and abraham said my son now this is such a tremendous statement god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering the offering was going to be to god and he's saying god will provide what is necessary god will god will provide jehovah will provide the required offering so they both of them they went both of them together and they came to the place again to the place which god had told him up so abraham's being very purposeful god tells him to do something he begins to do it god reveals it to them the rest it just unfolds as he walks and he comes with a place that god told him to go and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand i in just reading it even now it's it's it's then that you wish maybe they could have given a little bit more detail like i i want to know what's going on i want to know if there's anything being said i you know did abraham have to finally pull i'm the dead you just do what i say thing with isaac eventually like look dad i'm stronger than you if i'm not gonna let you do this and he just had to say trust me i know what i'm doing but he just it seems to have happened with such ease builds an altar ties his son up puts him on the altar and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said notice it third time here am i such a mellow guy right god says abraham here i am lord isaac says dad he goes here i am son and here he is he says here i am and he and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him notice this phrasing for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns now i i'm fairly certain that in all the commotion and the struggle with isaac they didn't just miss the ram over here tussling around in the thicket but god had created a ram something had been placed there in the moment the time that they needed it and here's this ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son notice the image that's being portrayed here's a god seemingly pronouncing judgment upon his the son of abraham he must die but then his son carries this wood up the hill to be sacrificed upon it and then god cr creates a sacrifice provides a sacrifice fulfilling what abraham already said would happen god will provide a sacrifice and then it says he's offered this is an offering instead of his son there's such beautiful imagery being portrayed here on this mount that is signifying jesus christ and it says and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and i'd love to just get more into this phrasing tonight but i i purposely removing some of these things that are inspired to me and quicken to me in this jehovah jireh is the name of the place and the throt the phrase the prophecy associated with it in the mount of the lord it shall be it shall be seen and this is tremendous phrasing because it's in this place in the mount of the lord it shall be seen the places that god had showed him and told him the lord spoke to get thee into the land of moriah so this was a place chosen by jehovah that's what it actually means a place chosen by jehovah and he's told by god to go upon one mountain that i will show you so the place that abraham comes to is a place chosen by god that god discloses that jehovah discloses to one man abraham he didn't get up there and there's a bunch of you know social media influences up there trying to get selfies in front of this uh famous ram thicket uh because everyone knew about it and there's a great alternative good shot and the lighting is just perfect at this particular time and everyone's clamoring to get up there no abraham alone goes to mount moriah a place chosen by jehovah upon one mountain that he said i will show you that's revealed to abraham and so this place in the mount of the lord it shall be seen this is the prophecy the lord inhabiting something and being seen in a particular place and this mount is on the eastern edge of jerusalem where solomon built the temple the place that god would dwell the place that he would make his permanent home and remember that's only a type of what you are and so in verse 4 it says on the third day after isaac had carried the wood of his sacrifice up the mount god appears to abraham provides a substitute sacrifice according to verse 8 saying my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering and then it says abraham named the place jehovah jireh which remember it means jehovah sees i i someone had come on my heart i think it was back in march somebody come on my heart while i was preparing for service and they came on my heart and i said brother i just the lord put something on my heart for you and i just said it's he sees and the brother was like oh great what have i done wrong like am i trying to expose something in his life and i kind of had to explain myself well what i meant by that is he sees what you're going through and i was like you know what just never mind come to church tonight but he says jehovah sees now we know we say jehovah jireh is my provider jehovah provides and that's what in the septuagint it talks about how jehovah provides and it's answering to the lord will provide himself a sacrifice so it's answering to that but it's more than just and i say more than god provides it all it's also that jehovah sees he's mindful he knows and insane he will provide and the phrase that he calls the place jehovah jair and to this day it said in the mount of the lord it shall be seen in other words as he has provided for me so will he provide to all for all those that trust in him this is the faith of abraham and the promised abraham seed just as he has provided for me father abraham he will provide for everyone else who trust in him like i do this is this is what he's declaring when he said name the place jehovah jireh this is the father of our faith signaling something to us this is a virtue that you ought to have trust in him because he sees and if you trust in him he'll do exactly for you what he did for me and when he says in the mount of the lord it shall be seen it's a prophecy of the messiah who would come and be the supreme sacrifice because here is a ram caught in a thicket provided by god the innocent that is slain in the instead of his son so it's prophecy that cro of the messiah it's prophecy that god would appear to his people in times of difficulty it's prophecy that god would appear in it to his people in a time of trouble it's prophecy that god would veil himself in flesh so these things that are spoken of in genesis 22 are very precious things and now in just looking at that and i wanted to continue on in the preceding verses as the angel begins to speak back to him and there's more that's disclosed on this mount moriah experience brother madam in referring to genesis chapter 18 and how he made himself known to abraham in in veiled in flesh and disclosed himself to when he came to him discerned the thoughts of sarah in the tent behind him brother is referring to that instance it says one day when god seemed that his servant was determined to be an example for people of today now we might we might that might hit each one of us a little bit differently and maybe just in one or two different ways that abraham was determined to be an example for his day in other words it was abraham's determination and god saw his determinations like wow he's determined to be an example of faith for two people today and i'm not wouldn't object to that at all but i also want you to think of it this way that god saw that abraham had been determined beforehand he himself had been selected and chosen to be an example for people today so when he says this in 1964 i want us to begin to tune in that he he had determined when he said abram get yourself out of ur in the land of the chaldees and away from your father's house and away from your kindred into a land that i'm gonna show you because he's saying you are being set forth to be an example of the bride in the end time who's going to be in a third exodus and coming out of a church to go in a rapture he said you are going to be determined you are determined to be an example of end time faith and so when we look at genesis chapter 22 this is when his faith is made perfect and he is determined to be god determined him to be an example of rapturing faith i realize those are my terminologies but determined to be an example for people of today end time bride what expressed the example of the faith for the bride in the last days what what is it then if we look at this if we begin to say all right we're gonna have a breakout session so everybody arrange ourselves by zip code and uh and we're gonna we're gonna talk about this and we're all gonna get together at the end and we're gonna talk about well what it what is it that expressed his faith and we kind of get together and go i don't know we have to like at least try to sacrifice our firstborn or you know what does this all mean do we need to build altars oh i know we need we all go to pilgrimage to mariah right and and we try to kind of figure it out well i i it's it's it's staring us right in the face because abraham's vision is connected with something beyond and i'm talking about in his this is where i'm transitioning now and maybe it's going to be very quickly to the uh very precise to the to the end of the service tonight notice i disavowed quickly very quickly but abraham i want you to catch this in the life of abraham and how god dealt with him his vision was connected with something beyond his natural life and so when we look at genesis chapter 22 and we we see these literal events unfolding child sacrifice god tempting him sacrifices firstborn and we start just looking at the wood and the mountain and the fire and the ram and the thicket and all these different things happening and we start looking at the different details and maybe something gets lost in the details all of a sudden if we don't take a step back and think about abraham's entire life and realize that abraham's vision was always connected to something beyond his natural life or beyond his days remember it's it's abram the hebrew sister sandra told me brother aaron i've got a new name i'm like oh great i've heard this before she said you can call me sister sandy the hebrew and i was like i like it that's how we all ought to identify we begin to understand what it means to be a hebrew abram the hebrew what it he had crossed over one from beyond and abraham could truly be described now in the dimension of time the dispensation of time and the realm of time in genesis chapter 12 that what he stepped out and began to do no one else is doing nobody else is doing it god isn't speaking to anybody else god spoke to one man abram get out of earth the land of counties i want you to go to canaan and he has this this pathway that he takes to canaan and abraham now is someone from beyond he's someone who's crossed over into another realm he's living by faith he's walking in another room he's living in the faith dimension and we have to recognize this about abraham living in the faith dimension he's not operating under the same metrics and the same callings and the same parameters and the same goals and the same attitudes and the same visions that everyone else is living under he has a calling and this calling that comes upon him he is now worshiping an invisible god so now beginning to worship to an invisible god and the invisible god having made himself known to him abraham is drawn into a different dimension and he's living in a realm differently than everybody else complete different reality for him and so this this is where abraham now his life is not it's not just connected with physical mountains and physical sacrifices and physical children there was something deeper about what was inspiring him because he's the hebrew though his body was still here faith by faith his sight had been translated and crossed over and now he's looking at things totally differently and he looked he's as we've been reading through the first couple services he searched for a city not made by man he searched with a city that had an eternal foundation had foundations that means permanence eternal and who made by god so there was something now if the bibles tell us that he searched for a city not made with hands that had foundation a city made by god that there is this means he's not so much looking for a natural place to put up his tent but there's something supernatural that he's craving for and looking for so abraham's vision now is connected beyond his natural life now let's be let's just look at a few scriptures that speak of the promise that's given to him genesis chapter 17 i'll read in chapter 13 and chapter 21 genesis chapter 17 verses 3 to 8 and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying this is god speaking as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name be any more called thy name anymore be called abram but thy name shall be abraham which is father many nations it says for a father of many nations have i made thee and i said have i made thee he's talking in past tense and if someone was walking by and hearing this conversation between god and neighbor abram and new abram they'd be like right you know the guy had to use a servant just to get one son and now he's gonna say he's gonna be a father of many nations then now notice the pr the covenant being proceeded now from because my covenant is with him in this unconditional covenant and i will make the exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee quite a prophecy and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations and knows the language for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee it's important to the kind of pawn to this now like we're not thinking in terms of everlasting in its use being an indeterminate amount of time that oh well he was just saying it would be it's only me in the years that we couldn't quite determine in this context he's talking about eternal he said i'm going to be a god unto thee not just for a period of time and thy seed after thee and i'll give unto thee and to thy seed seed after the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god. now these are the things that god is speaking to abraham and the faith that abraham has the revelation that abraham is getting is not hey i'm going to build you a house and you're going to have it until you die and then when you die it's going to revert back to the original owner because there's a way that you can have a particular deed to a property where i'm going to deed this property it to you and you can live in it until you die when you die it's going to revert back to my family or revert to the prior owner he said hey i'm giving it to you free and clear it's all yours and you're going to have it and he said i'm going to be your god forever everlasting in an everlasting possession everlasting covenant and everlasting possession it's ever during or eternal is the meaning intended there it says in genesis chapter 13 verse 15. for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed forever again to you and your seed will eternally have this land your seed will stand forever by the power of god and notice how he says that i'm going to be a god to you under this everlasting covenant and it's not going to use a language that i can i'm only going to be a goddam for an indeterminate amount of time that said i'm going to be a god to you for a really really long time but i just can't quite tell you how long that's going to be he said i'm going to be a god to you forever eternally so there's if this word is not being used in the context we're going to talk about something that may endure for a very very very long time in a space of time that may be very very lengthy and it's wanting to convey this great breadth that may not be numbered but yet there's an ultimate end this is it's not true of this prophecy god is specifically saying everlasting possession everlasting covenant i'm going to be your god forever as he spoke to in genesis 21 33 and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god remember there's a revelation here i'm just going to allude to it and lord one will speak on it sunday that he's a god of the living not the dead and so i'm going to be a god unto thee forever so abraham's catching a revelation he's not saying wait a minute so i wonder how long my father lived and i had a brother that died early and trying to figure out just how long he's going to enjoy this god or how long do how long is this going to be abraham's catching the revelation that he's an eternal god and he said he's going to be my god forever abraham started it's starting to dawn on abraham that the revelation that's coming to him transcends this natural life so abraham's actions and specifically now i want you to think of his entire life as this revelation is progressively unfolding to him but especially in genesis chapter 22 abraham's actions are testifying of a deep conviction of eternity his actions are testifying of a deep conviction of an essential attribute of god in the nature of god and not just merely the nature of god but the nature of god's promises specifically to him and so he is he is having this revelation unfold to him that this prop that god is is being revealed to me and it's bringing him he's crossed over his faith as he entered into another dimension and now in that realm death and life and food and land and everything begins to lose its hold and power upon abraham but god now begins to connect eternity with his possessions and abraham is seeing something to come together in something very beautiful so his vision transcends the flesh it's going beyond the calendar it's going beyond this life now let me just kind of drop a couple statements in the here for you to uh ponder on before sunday service the seed of abraham was christ he's the son of abraham abraham's faith i want to say this abraham's faith was jesus christ it was it was a he his faith was in jesus christ the word his faith was a revelation of this this redeemer and this redemption he was he was catching a vision beyond the depravity of the world and the time that he lived in the the chaos of genesis chapter 12 and the idol worship of his family and the chaos of the counties and even the chaos of all the lands he was going into and and the the famines and the travels and everything he was doing there was something that abraham's faith was connected to so i'm wanting to kind of connect abraham with jesus christ now so if we could just say that this is there as this undercurrent in abraham's faith abraham then was willing to offer sacrifice offer isaac as a sacrifice because of an understanding of the god that he believed in so if if i could just say it this way the first vision that abraham had he wasn't laying there just stretching on a really nice morning and earth and also this voice says kill your wife you know your half sister sarah the one you married yeah just go ahead and kill her take a knife he's like well voices are talking got to do what the voices say right that's not what abraham does it's not day one kill a family member but here's a life lifetime of where by the time he this is what you have to catch we sometimes look at abraham like oh my goodness god tempted abraham and we get this real dramatic ethical discussions about well what if god let him kill him you're like what would that mean and how would that topple our faith and we don't even look at abraham as being he's the father of faith guys he had confidence in the character of the one that's asking him to do this i'm about to get excited i'm glad there's there's a wide aisle today i'll just say it this way if there was pews i'd run the tops of them right now because this is it don't get pushed anytime soon i'll probably change my you know my desire to run the tops of pews but he's willing to offer up isaac as a sacrifice because he trusted and understood and knew the nature of the god who asked him to do this and so abraham's actions directly testified directly testified and were evidence that he believed god had power over death we can't look at this activity in this action in genesis chapter 22 any other way other than god i trust you i know you every promise every vision everything you've been doing in my life to this time testifies to a power beyond this life and so he walked in that journey i i'm not trying to get too dramatic and dramatized to the point where i leave the truth of the scripture but i i just i'm not seeing tonight that abraham was depressed being dragged for three days going oh my goodness and trying to hide from isaac and i was like man i wonder what's going on with dad he's really depressed i have never seen him like this and he's just over there going i can kill my son abraham's probably going man i don't know what's going to happen on mount moriah but this is going to be good like he must have just felt like that i know the god i'm trusting he's proven himself from genesis 12 to genesis 22 to all these things that have happened he's a god i'm personal with the god i'm intimate with the god has made promises and backed him up i'm in a situation now where it seems like this is a big ask this is a big ass to sacrifice my son but i'm not looking at a god of death i'm looking at a god of life i'm not looking at a god of the dead i'm looking at a god of a living and he's testifying that he believed in a god that had power over death he had a faith in god that could bypass death or he could raise isaac from it why because he's the god of the living not a god of the dead why does it say in verse 4 then on the third day then on the third day he goes up that hill to sacrifice his son then on the third day god appeared to him as jehovah jireh why was it the third day why was it the first day why was it the second day it was on the third day because that's the day of the resurrection it's on that day because he's testifying abraham's walking in these steps and he's willing to offer up isaac as a sacrifice not because he just believed god so much like well if he wants me to kill my son then i'm just going to kill my son he's like well you already told me that everyone in the earth is going to be blessed by him you've already demonstrated to me you're a god of the living and not of the dead you've already told me everlasting covenant going to be your people forever i already know i'm going to live forever so then i know that isaac is included in that promise and death can't have me death can't have my son because this promise is eternal and abraham was willing not because he believed god and it was going to be obedient irrationally unto death but he did it understanding power and promise he did it believing that he was a god an eternal god that could resurrect and the message jehovah jireh brother man says you've got about 2 800 years of experience to look back through others and see what he's done and if the old testament provided that how much more does the new covenant a better thing that them without us would not be made perfect god has provided he says i trust that you'll believe with all your heart as we pray and he says now father we thank thee for being jehovah jireh the lord's provided sacrifice now i ask you today lord jesus that you will give grace abundantly to all the people that are here and let them know that he's preaching jehovah jireh he's preaching genesis 22 you provided a resurrection in a form there for isaac this is what happened on mount moriah you provided a resurrection informed there for isaac who had come to the end of his road but you provided a way for him what was provided on mount moriah resurrection what was it abraham was going to the top of that mountain believing in a resurrection he might not have known everything because it was god's nature to show him some things but not show him everything but he had this vision this understanding that if isaac dies he must live again and here's brother brown saying you provided a resurrection this ram caught in a thicket is signifying representing resurrection why because isaac under the sentence of death is by bypasses death and and now i realize i'm going to read hebrews chapter 11 verses 17 18 and 19. and some of you probably already thought about it and said i don't know why brother aaron's getting all excited about this i've been reading like this in my bible since i could read but it says in hebrews chapter 11 verse 17 by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac so when he offered up isaac it was a trial it was a testament it was approving and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called so it brings us back to the promise so it says accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from which also he received him in a figure he said that he actually in parable or in time receives isaac from the dead because he's under the sentence of death take your son your only son and sacrifice and kill upon an altar on mount moriah the place that i have chosen the place that i'll show you but what does abraham do he reckons and accounts that god is able to do what raise isaac from the dead so whenever isaac is receives the resurrection and form the scripture actually says in parable or pre-figure isaac was resurrected for abraham and that's what he experienced it's actually telling us that he reckoned god was able to raise him up so the faith of abraham was very purposeful that in going up this mount moriah this mount moriah experience this mount moriah showdown in coming to this apex coming to this climax of his faith coming to this place of supreme expression it was not that he was up there guessing but he reckoned and believed god would raise him up counting that god was able to raise him even from the dead and my redeemer liveth brother adam says abraham said and notice this phrase it's kind of just a lengthy expression several sentences here i've had the same kind of vision rip yonder on the mountain when christ god met me and give me his redemptive names as jehovah jair is kind of answering to job and he's dramatizing this give me his redemptive names of jehovah jair jehovah raph and all those see in the death burial and resurrection what does he see and giving these redemptive names jehovah sees he's not just expressing that faith is being able to accept whatever circumstances come your way and that faith is able to accept that if god wants me to sacrifice this then i'm willing to let it go and we have this if you love it you let it go it'll come back to you and just some kind of mushy gushy weird new age way of believing god faith was an understanding for abraham he's very purposeful in god the way god revealed himself to him it was a progress progressive revelation and he says it was death burial and resurrection abraham already saw it he says seeing it and i offered it in my own son when i seen little isaac when i took him on the hill let him pack his own wood up this is abraham speaking the top of the mountain and there i laid him on the altar and was going to take his own life catch this i purposely haven't asked the musicians to come i just want you to focus on this very diligently now knowing that i'd received him as one from the dead even in figure of what sarah's womb being dead this was one that he couldn't have i believe that he would raise him up again and through this great hope that beats in my heart i know he said he could raise them up and then brother says it was a foresight even if it's abraham speaking this is what you've got to catch it was a foresight of the resurrection abraham's faith had he had a vision of the rapture he had a vision of the resurrection he did not wasn't willing to offer isaac as a sacrifice just as some sort of dumb blind trust or bad faith but he was willing to offer isaac knowing the promise believing the promise believing in the character and the nature of god and he had a vision he had a foresight he had a revelation of the resurrection he said the same thing job had job said i know my redeemer liveth and in the end i will stand on the earth said abraham had the same vision he's seen the same thing job had so abraham has a faith to believe in his position beyond the flesh he has a faith to believe in a power beyond natural things this is the faith of abraham as he walks up that mountain one last scripture i'm stopping just right in the middle of this thought but john chapter 8 verse 56 i want to leave this with you jesus says your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad what did abraham see what was abraham's faith and then how is his faith akin to our faith you see the same thing and you're glad you cross over other people don't see it looking at looking at the same things well i listen to that i read that i studied that you're looking at it look at you looking at me look at you and you're kind of like it's awesome isn't it isn't this good good isn't it they're kind of like well i mean why because you see something by election jesus said abraham rejoiced to see my day it might have seemed like he looked forward to seeing my day and jesus says and he saw it and hear abraham on mount moriah his life is patterning even god offering up his son but then it's at that last moment god creates in a second something that wasn't there he creates it and it's there and what ought to have been isaac's death it's bypassed in a resurrection that it's appointed unto men wants to die but all of a sudden in a moment god cancels the appointment you see how abraham's faith is determined to be the faith of the people today let's stand to our feet tonight what a faith what a supreme faith abraham saw the day of jesus christ and was glad he had a foresight of the resurrection he provided god provided a resurrection in form for isaac abraham accounted reckon god was able to resurrect from the dead why because he was an everlasting god and he couldn't be an everlasting god unless there was an everlasting people and so faith is so far beyond what's happening naturally and it's in that faith of abraham when he when he offered up isaac as a sacrifice james says his faith reached its full and supreme expression and brother van says abraham's faith was an example of faith this is this is the pinnacle this is the peak but so then i'm saying we have to have rapturing faith and we see it in abraham so then we can look we can go back start over in genesis 12 and see the steps that abraham went through to where he could have that kind of faith to believe have a vision beyond this flesh let's bow our heads in prayer gracious heavenly father it is a pleasure to be able to minister this word especially lord of pleasure to minister to people who believe these things and are hungry for these things lord we're living in an hour in a time where many people are in bondage they're bound by personalities they're bound by false doctrines they're bound by fears bound by blind loyalty led by bad faith and there's only one that can set him free that's you i believe in the same way that abram was set free in genesis 11 and genesis 12 it begins by you calling their name and what i pray tonight lord what you would do is just whisper their name in whatever manner that you disclose yourself to your people or whatever personal way you have of speaking to someone and beckoning them beyond themselves and even helping them to realize that this is not what's taking place even in in this last days it's not just even what's being preached at this church is just not a another reiteration of the good news and the gospel that's been denominated and not just another branch off of another of different bible church but lord it's something that we believe is direct from heaven very pertinent for the age that we live in it's different than religion lord it's different than denominationalism it's different than just the fanaticism and charisma that exist in the world today but this is something deeply personal and just as you revealed yourself to abraham you're wanting to reveal yourself to the seed of abraham in this hour not just become part of a collective not become part of a movement not become part of a broad group but lord individually find ourselves communing with you walking in the routines of the scripture in the plans of god for our life and lord i believe that there's individuals that will attain to this rapturing faith people that possess the seat of it right now and they too will have a mount zion show down in a very personal and intimate way on a mountaintop with their isaac with their christ in a way that's personal and intimate and then as we all come to this climax we come to this highest part of the mountain we all are walking these steps of faith together may we encourage one another pray for one another be there for one another lord i as i am moved by this example in genesis chapter 22 and how abraham acted with the rapturing faith he acted with a perfect faith hey we just take a step back and ask ourselves lord how did he get there and then understand that you'll take us the same way you'll give us the same experiences so that we too can experience what abraham looked for what abraham believed in i pray for the people tonight lord as we have needs in our midst we pray for them we believe that your word is sufficient we believe in the power of divine healing we believe in the power of casting out devils we believe in the power of deliverance from sin father we believe your word now is enough we pray for anyone bound by sickness bound by sin bound by disease bound by foul spirits lord whatever it might be we pray that you would bring a deliverance acts of repentance lord save souls being baptized in the name of jesus christ lord we pray for those that we know are sick father i failed to mention at the beginning but brother tim cho the pastor of a church in northern missouri passed away this week because of cove lord another pastor that's just three pastors in missouri in this past year alone lord lord we're saddened by this i pray that you comfort your people comfort the family sister joanne lord i pray that you would have grace upon us as we as a church and his families navigate the continued challenges lord of a pandemic may we never shriek back in fear act and fear act suspiciously lord but be deliberate in our actions father be confident in our behavior and our demeanor and i pray lord that you help us to do all things well as you do commit the people to you tonight in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
