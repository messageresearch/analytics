TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and this is Jesus praying he begins praying for himself and for the disciples and then as he's praying for the disciples he then expands this neither pray I for these alone not just the disciples there present but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that the word of the disciples so this is Faith to Faith this is how this body is going to be built that they may they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou Hast sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved me as thou Hast loved me father I will that they also whom thou Hast given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world Amen man we desire that God would just bless these things to us tonight you may be seated my my title tonight is art for God's sake and it's uh something that I think will make a little bit more sense as we go forward and I know that I ended uh Sunday morning sermon right in the middle so I'm actually trying to finish it but do so in a way that it doesn't leave too many people stranded who weren't here on Sunday morning and and I'm going to begin uh from the from the art side the natural side that perspective we've been looking at through these first few Services of the year and just mention that in the 1800s and the the 19th century there was a movement that began to hold the opinion or and teach that art should be appreciated only for its beauty and its form and so I want you to think about that that the work of art itself should be appreciated solely for how beautiful it looks and it art did not need to serve any other purpose whether it was political or social or religious or moral or scientific uh had it didn't need to have any other value other than as you looked at it you thought it was pleasurable or it was beautiful and I think it's good for us to think back to Genesis chapter 3 how that in the beginning when man fell the most beautiful creation that has ever existed the most beautiful woman that was ever brought forth and this uh tapestry of God's creation this masterpiece family this woman is presented with a different definition of beauty and Satan was able to sell Eve on Beauty for pleasure sake and that's it not necessarily any other utility other than he caused her to see that it was beautiful and that in it in itself it was pleasurable and so this movement which is called the aesthetic movement it sought to free art from moral constraints and it wanted to liberate art from practical constraints in other words it didn't need to be useful and of not being useful it was essentially useless and so they this is what they kind of their thesis would be art exists purely for its own Beauty not to convey any moral message or practical message I want you to think about this and I was just curious as I was uh preparing even over last year and looking at some of these things is well how do you use art uh and God as a Creator and as an artist and begin to look at these things and explore these things when you see things in art that are so anti- good and anti-christ and this is where I believe it stems from is this idea that art doesn't need to convey anything real it just merely needs to be beautiful so art was not a tool for Morality it was not a tool for moral instruction or education shouldn't be used to convey a specific message it was as they called it Art For Art's Sake and when it's Art For Art's Sake you they just wanted to evoke emotions that when one was view viewing the art or reading it as it was a literary uh movement as well they wanted it to your senses purely through its form as we mentioned it on Sunday uh the uh life imitates art from Oscar wild he was one that championed this notion that art should exist for Art's Sake and he believed that art the beauty of art Justified the art so Beauty was the excuse for lying right as long as it's beautiful the decay of lying the decay of The Art of Lying was decreasing Beauty in the literary world and in the art world and these realists were sh taken away art he felt that we should be able to tell beautiful lies that would please the people and cause them these imaginations and so his theory was if it was beautiful or evoked emotion who cares if it's a lie let alone useless just enjoy itow I want to give you an example of this and this might delay here this is a um an abstract painting by the artist Mark Rothco I believe it was painted in the 1950s it was Untitled so it's been titled uh yellow and blue and it sold for 46.5 million I understand the color combination certainly would invoke high value the scarlet and gray was useless but this one sold for $ 46.5 million and really it doesn't look like anything different than what we would create if we were trying to make a color palette for our baby's bedroom right we're just going to put this together see if these colors go together but yet this thing sold for $ 46.5 million this you could see is a banana duct tape to a wall there's no frame there's no other nothing behind it it's just the wall of the art uh the museum and this was entitled comedian and the joke's on you right I was an Italian artist and it was entitled comedian it sold for $6.2 million I want you to consider how much value was placed in this work of art for $46 million and this work of art for $6.2 million when it was a banana that was bought for pennies right outside the exhibit and duct tape to a wall I believe these examples of Modern Art reflect modern religion that when you look at it this religious life is imitating art and the art that it's inspired by this is L to see in a nutshell that we would value something like this for $ 46.5 million that anyone would pay $6.2 million for this even if it is just a joke and they're flush with money so something's being lost and and something is no longer valued in this picture here it's by a James Whistler this is called nocturn in black and gold or the falling rocket I failed to remember I failed to recall just how much this piece of art is worth but this is one that represents this movement of Art For Art's Sake that you don't necessarily need to know what this is to enjoy it but just stare at it and imagine certain things and and see some beauty in it and it's called the Falling Rock ET if I recall this is a painting of what's supposed to be fireworks over a lake or some water scene and this this artist Whistler was a huge proponent of Art For Art's Sake that art solely needs to excite your senses and be pleasurable and move you in some way to some emotion even oh that's scary or for boing or that's repulsive or I don't even know what this is and this is interesting that's all it needed to do and there was an art critic that uh criticized him and uh wrote up a piece that was uh criticizing his art and so as this artist did or Whistler followed the lawsuit and in his lawsuit he claimed this that the value of art lies in its ability to evoke an emotional response and provide visual pleasure that that's all that's all you need for art is for it to evoke an emotional response and provide some visual pleasure he argued for the independence or the autonomy of art that it should serve no other purpose than to entertain you that believed that art was complete in itself because it was art for art sake and if you'll notice this we none of us recognize what this is this is just pure gibberish to everyone here but NG GM this is their logo this is the updated one if you'll notice on the crest it's ARS gratia artist art for art sake that that's all you need to do is if its art within itself it's complete doesn't need to convey a message doesn't need to be used for moral educ ation doesn't need to you don't need to gain any knowledge but you by interacting with it and observing it and imagining different things and allowing it to influence your spirit on some level you can look at this art whether it be this or or that or that and look at it and say to yourself This is this moves me in an emotional way and it doesn't have to have any more value beyond that I was thinking about it and came to this conclusion this is The Emperor's New Clothes right that what is happening is and in that particular telling by Hans Christian Anderson which is an interpretation of one that was written in Spain and then de uh then demonstrated again in England and they found copies of Indian ones uh back in the 1100s so it's just kind of a it's a tale for a long time of this idea that you can be tricked into believing something and accepting something through social pressure some of the earlier tellings of this story predating Hans Christian Anderson was that anybody who was an illegitimate child would not be able to see the clothes so it was used uh to determine adulterous paternity and so if somebody walked by naked you would be like wow that's a great suit right Dad and and you wouldn't want to be the one that was found to be an illegitimate child and in the telling of Hans Christian Anderson some swindlers come by and they convince the emperor that they're weaving the most beautiful garment in the world and that and tricked him into believing that it was there weaving their tails and their lies and eventually the advisers to the emperor pretended to see the beauty so they didn't look foolish and everyone was in on the game to our now you have a society that exists where people will stand around looking at yellow and blue and saying it's just remarkable right the duct tape have you seen duct tape like that and they're so enamored with it and because it's art for art sake there's no other purpose behind it in Proverbs 31:20 it says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the Lord she shall be praised in the empress knew clothes it was fear that caused people to conform uh they weren't even trusting their own senses and surely some eventually begin to believe their own lies and imagine that there was a beautiful garment and could convince themselves after the fact that I saw it it was gorgeous it was beautiful but yet it was a child with these innocent eyes that said Mom the emperor is naked he has no cloth on sir and so it is through fear that we begin to be deceived it's through that fear that we begin to accept something that's very shallow is beautiful but favor is deceitful and beauty is vain amen what we could see in art for art sake and what we could see in these different examples of art that are valued at millions and millions of dollars is the failure of discernment the failure of proper judgment the inability to Value things and have the appropriate worth for them and it's a prideful fear that one who does not for this says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain that puts it in this realm of art for art sake is in that realm of vain Beauty because all it is is it Beauty for beauty's sake and others would be afraid to acknowledge its beauty uh for beauty's sake they would therefore kind of Co coales into the whole and say yeah that's fine that's beautiful and be deceived because they want favor with people am so it's a prideful fear it's that Conformity I don't want to be perceived as different so I'll say yeah that's amazing what we find is it's a lack of light it's darkness that is set it over the people and so groping in darkness they they they can't perceive correctly whereas the True Light would expose the vanity of that beauty so there is this idea that art should merely exist for Art's Sake and all that it should do is excite the senses but I want to turn it around seeing that we've looked at life imitating art and created to create and these different things that we've beun with this year on how that you are the art of God in the beginning when God created he brought forth a beautiful Earth that in itself was not just Beauty for beauty's sake it's not just creation for creation's sake so I want to look at it from the standpoint of art for God's sake art for God's sake created for a purpose existing for a reason and what God wants from you in terms of Holiness and demonstration of the life of a Believer and proper discernment and putting the right value on things is he wants to use that not for the sake that it would be beautiful in itself but for his sake in Isaiah 28: 1-6 I believe it just beautifully describes and I say beautifully but just exceptionally and really on the nose the L desen age woe to the crown of Pride to the drunkards of Ephraim whose glorious beauty is a Fading Flower it's just temporary it's shallow it's not Everlasting which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine behold the Lord hath a mighty and strong one which is a tempest of of hail and a destroying storm as a flood of Mighty Waters overflowing shall cast down the Earth with the hand the crown of Pride the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trotted under feet and the Glorious Beauty which is on the head of the fat Valley shall be a Fading Flower and as the Hasty fruit before the summer which when he hath that look he that lookth upon it seeth while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up there's your there's your picture of it all that the beauty is consumed at the desires of the flesh as a woman an adulterous woman when she eateth she wipeth her mouth and says she has done no wrong she's acted on impulse and animal Instinct in the beginning when Satan deceived the woman she was acting with that same sense she couldn't wait it was an oncoming promise and the Very power that Humanity was given and Mankind was given to create themselves brother Bram said that's where they fell because it changed to Art For Art's Sake it wasn't in God's time or God's purpose and as that Fading Flower he says here these drunkards their glorious beauty is as a Fading Flower and their crown of Pride will be destroyed remember on Sunday we talked about life imitates art and how it's but the supposition is that people mod model their actions and their attitudes based upon the art that inspires them it's art for art sake that when they see something that is merely for the the the demonstration of pleasure to excite the senses that's what they're modeling themselves after Isaiah 60:2 says for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people now this is the time that we're living in of gross Darkness it's the darkest age there's ever been the world is groping in darkness and Paul said if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost 2 Corinthians chapter 4 now verse 4 in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is at the image of God should shine unto them this is the blinding upon the minds and the hearts of the people in this day and age so that they can see something that has no value in it and believe that there's True Value they can see a false light they can see a perversion they can see something mangled they can see a banana taped to a wall and be willing to spend $6.2 million regardless of the rationale regardless of how someone say well that amount that was spent by this uh Tech billionaire or whatever it might have been uh it's such it's just like you going to buy a coke uh uh after after school or something now forget all those kind of metrics and those analogies $6.2 million for a banana that was worth pennies in tape that had no value is ridiculous yes sir but we live in a day and age where content is made for the sake of the content to merely entertain and make people uh happy and it's become a reflection it is a reflection of the spiritual condition of Leo DEA Modern Art reflects modern religion Modern Art reflects modern Christianity yes Amen to whom the gospel has been hid they're groping in darkness they have been blinded they're blind leaders of the Blind and the gospel's been hid to them to them that are lost because if the light of God's gospel ever shined into their hearts they wouldn't give into the Performing of Arts their services wouldn't just be uh for show in the message Shalom brother bram's talking about the day we're living in now and he makes a comparison to what it was like in Genesis 1: 2 he said it's just like it was in the beginning where there was gross darkness of upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and said let there be light and God separated the light from the darkness and I believe that we're living in that hour again the hour where it is dark it's chaotic it's grotesque it's just a blob a mass it's UND discernable what we see and the world says this is beautiful but then God says God brother says the hour when God is separating light from Darkness and it's pre he's pressing into the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest and whatsoever do make manifest is light it exposes it's what shows true beauty and Symmetry and form and shape and purpose and as we continue there at Isaiah 28 as it says The Fading Flower the crown of Pride and this glorious Beauty will fade but it says in that Day verse 5 in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a Crown of Glory and for a diadem him of beauty at a time of darkness and despair and destruction a time when the crown of Pride upon the drunkards of Ephraim I is causing their beauty to fade and their false Beauty exposed there will be a light in that day the Lord of hosts will be a Crown of Glory he shall if this is the crowning achievement of Christ his bride he's going to be a Crown of Glory not a crown of Pride but a Crown of Glory and a diadem a crowning of beauty judgment this discernment of beauty under the residue of his people because it says in verse 6 and four a spirit of judgment to him that sth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate in this hour God's restoring true beauty he is going to be a crown of beauty a Crown of Glory Glory this diadem of beauty it's a crowning of discernment it's a crowning of proper Judgment of what's valuable and what's right in Isaiah 42: 5 and 6 it says thus sayith the Lord thus sayith God the Lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it in spirit to them that walk therein I the Lord hath called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will give thee and will keep thee and give thee for Covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles when Jesus was in the world he said I am the light light of the world as long as I am in the world I am the light in the world but yet this light was not just to the Jews it was a light to the Gentiles and so just building off of your Rich knowledge already of the history of the church and God bringing forth the body of Christ which is the Gentile bride in Ephesians 5:8 it says for ye were sometimes Darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of the light this goes back to verse one where H he said be ye dear followers of be ye followers of God as dear children children imitating the model of the father and not imitation in art for art sake or not just modeling an attempt to mimic it but rather you are children of God with his life and his nature bone of his bone flesh of his flesh therefore imitate his life imitate his character as his children so that your life will imitate him amen we're to be followers of God as dear children because we were sometimes Darkness but now we are light in the Lord you are characterized as light so therefore we should walk as children of light verse 13 now just enhancing what it means to be a Child of Light and all but all things are reproved that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light it's light that brings you to life and now it's your life that is the light of the world as Jesus Christ came into the world and the life was the light of men now it's your light which is the light in the Lord your life is the light of men therefore Our Lives should reveal the order of God's word the proper symetry of God's word the proper composition and beauty of God's word that we should reflect true beauty not be bananas taped to a wall in Matthew 5: 14-6 he says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house Jesus drawing upon these very simple principles that a uh City in that day and age not lit up by these lights that we have but candles and other means of natural means of fire would uh light up a Hillside and you would know that the city is there he saiding in the same sense that as a city on a hill can be seen round about and a candle lit is lit only for the purpose of light to others he's saying you are that light you realize that when we are holding light it's not necessary that we're illuminated for our own purposes but when you hold a lantern you are in darkness but the path is illuminated you are not a candle for your own sake but for the sake of those that are beholding the hill that are beholding the candle amen CU he says let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven we are that city of God come down out of Heaven you are a bride adorned for her husband the bride hath made herself ready with that those things that God has given her she's adorned in Beauty Psalms 50:2 out of Zion the Perfection of beauty God hath shined where is God shining not in the halls of art not in denominational churches not in the the in attainment venues it's not even properly seen anymore nature as it's constantly changed and misused but it's out of Zion not in Utah but right in the body of Christ out of Zion the Perfection of beauty God shines out of her is light and her light is beautiful and clear Psalms 149:4 for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation he's going to be his Beauty it's his Beauty Beauty the Perfection of beauty that shines in you to beautify he going to Adorn you in true beauty to be glorified it means with salvation which is Victory and deliverance therefore it's that that light that we see when we see him as he is therein we see true true beauty and that's what ought to inspire us that ought to give us some inspiration then to be light I am the god who is the father of light in him there's no Shadow or variableness or shadow of turn therefore I as a child of the light I am light therefore I I'm inspired by my Creator I'm inspired by the one who brought me forth and his characteristics Lord beautify me with salvation Lord I want to make myself ready Lord out of us may the Perfection of beauty shine Isaiah 60: 1 to5 arise Shine for thy light is come this day this scripture is fulfilled and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for it is the rising of the Sun for behold Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people now notice this but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee now it's not just that we're all beholding a risen son but to those who cannot discern the Risen son it should be reflected in your countenance it should be part of your disposition in your character that his glory should be seen upon you why the word world do grow up in in darkness why they are deluded with these modern arts and therefore modern inventions and modern religion you ought to be the true beauty that can begin to shine and cause someone to wonder is there still Beauty in this world Glory that out of you the Perfection of beauty God who is the Perfection of beauty Zion who is representative of her will shine that he will beautify the bride with salvation brother eler this is just fits marries perfectly with good morning bride this is where we're living this is the time that we're living and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and the Kings to the brightness of thy Rising she's begin to rise he says and there will be Gentiles that come to that light the message that's rejected anymore it's not that people would name the name of William bradam and say he's a false prophet and therein reject the message they can just simply reject the reflection of Christ in you that's the Christ that's being rejected the Jesus whom they persecute therefore we understand according to the teaching of the message that the bride from around the world must be the word expressed to those who can see Jesus Christ when he prayed he said I pray not just for them alone but all them that would believe through their word therefore when we look at this if you want to turn to our text and I'll just try to bring a few things out before we close the glory of the Lord is risen upon you so that his glory can be seen upon thee amen that when your G the glory of God would be seen in you and I know that there's this way that we want to paint that picture to where it's like oh wow you got to come see this but it's it's not religion for religion's sake it's not church for church sake it's not art for art sake if God's going to show his Beauty in you it's so that his light shining into to and through you would bring others to the light not to you but to the light it's art for God's sake John chap 17: 20- 24 neither pray I the pray I for these alone but with them also which Shall Believe on me through their word it's from Faith to Faith God was going to use his body and their as his voice to preach the word we've seen these Dynamics so clearly in scripture we have we were saved by the a similar Dynamic the very same thing that they all may be one as thou father art in me I feel Vindicated there's art right there do you see it you catch that and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou Hast sent me how is it the world is going to believe that he was sent when we become one with him it is not merely through the Oneness of Christ with the father that brings salvation but when we can begin to recognize that we are also in him and he in us when we can believe on his word and he says this this to me is just the real gold and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou H has sent me and has loved me as thou Hast sent me and Hast loved them as thou Hast loved me notice that when he's calling out for this shared glory and this Oneness it's that the world would see and believe through you father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world this Glory that Christ desires for you to share in is not glory for Glory sake or as I'm using the term art for art sake art for heart sake is vain self-serving it evokes only pleasure it just does something to your senses woo that was a good service and all that looks beautiful and this is fun that's great but this is Beauty for God's sake this was shared glory for your sake Christ is saying I have been glorified and the father has glorified me and he will glorify it again and there's a lot of things is saying about his own Glory but he's not just saying that this glory is a glory that he shares but now it's a glory he wants to give this is how real this art that I'm have been pondering and thinking about it's when there's some value that someone can take away for themselves I can look at a banana tape to a wall and say that's sold for $6.2 million I wish I had have thought of that I got some other I I'm going to glue some asparagus to a wall right maybe maybe the people who really into that the green stuff they'll like that and that what it does is just this selfishness and this vanity nothing to take away from it but just so horrible questions but when there's some art that's moving it brings you to something that has utility something that has a purpose Beyond itself Art For Art's Sake is Art is uh complete within itself that within itself it needs nothing else to give it beauty or color or purpose that it's achieved some Symmetry and it moves upon your flesh and you think it's glorious and beautiful but Jesus says the glory that I have the beauty that he had that the world couldn't see he wanted to share it with you there's uh a book that I had I I bought just recently it's a it was published and printed in 1896 and I was able to find a first edition copy and it's uh these concise devotions that were given at Harvard College to the Seminary school and my son jack and I were doing a devotion this morning and not we were reading this together and he's speaking of this very scripture he says this one who gave this devotion he says it was not his capacity to receive which glorified him now thinking of Christ now it was not his capacity to receive that glorified Christ it was his capacity to give the beauty of Christ was not merely in what he held but what he was willing to share it was not the beauty that we could behold ourselves but it was the beauty that we could get from what we beheld in most of the great pictures of the glorified Christ there is a Halo of light encircling and Illuminating his face and he says that is the fictitious Glory the glory of possession there was a theory a principle within art especially within the Renaissance and some of the influence of the church that art that depicted the the holy family and depicted Christ to the church it had to be sacred it had to have Grandeur it could not evoke Earthly things it you had to see be like that never seen anything like that right you had to look at and say I could never afford that there's churches like Christ look like that there's always a Halo just imagine the cherubs they all look like that babies with rosy cheeks and there's things that it was things that were unworldly that's how it had to be presented even the Dutch reformist would not allow you to paint the holy family so that a throne was painted with it as an empty chair and you were to imagine that was the Throne of God what was it they were producing in their art were things that were sacred that really had no earthly utility except to tell you this isn't you you can never be this and the Catholic Church forced poverty on an entire continent making them feel contrite and broken and needy and and presented this idea that opulence and Grandeur was the power of God and they could never attain to it because they were Sinners subject to purgatory wow it's a fictitious Glory the glory of possession and if it's a glory that was merely possessed it was one that was to Christ alone as he's depicted with Halos he says in a few such paintings the light streams from the Master's face to illuminate the other figures of the scene that is the real glory the glory of transmission the glory of transformation I'll put it in those words that when artists begin to express Christ in more human ways so we were showing the the the head of Christ through Rembrant and how he showed a Meek man a humble man a human that you could see this and say oh well who might have this been during that time frame and who is this depicting and you would have believed that that would have been human but the alien looking Christ who always had a Halo and there was always this otherworldly Look to Him that's not what Christ was the Glorious beauty of Christ is the glory that can be given to us and it's that that should be seen in us the glory he wanted to share the glory that he had wasn't one that was Vain and selfish and glory for Glory sake but it was glory for your sake so we are we must be Christlike now in the sermon images of Christ brother Bram makes this statement he says now that doesn't mean that we're to grow a long beard as the artist pictures have him him having this is a a CIO uh I think it's painted in the 1600s or 1500s and it's actually at the Getty museum in La currently under threat of fire almost this is a very old ancient painting that paints Christ and is supposed to be reflecting uh his image that was impressed within a veil but this says it doesn't mean that we're to grow a long beard and Artist as the artist pictures him having where we would wear crown of thorns and grow our hair long and try to look like this he says neither does it mean that we grow long hair as the artist pictures him having or wear a robe as he wore for we're living in another day this isn't the day we're living in we're not living in the in the day when it looked like this he says we don't necessarily have to be that to reflect his physical image but we must in our souls reflect his Spirit image and his manner of life I may not have that highlighted but it's worthy of it in our souls we must reflect his Spirit image and his manner of life we do not see the work of and see him rendered in a certain image and say I want to be like that I want to dress like that I want to look like that but rather you've got to have his spirit and reflect him now as a creation of God in this hour his spirit and his manner of life he says I do not believe that Christians consist of joining churches or Creeds I believe it's a reflection of Jesus Christ and a human being that's what it ought to be the glory that I have I've given to you the glory of transmission which we now share that we now have is Christ in human beings for we are his members the members of his body and we bear His Image the scripture says now what kind of image was he isn't that the question what kind of image was he listen how easy would it be for us to find the the the full photo of Hoffman's Christ at 33 or Christ and the Rich Young Ruler and be able to take all those garments and those colors and perfectly match them and just dress that way and we all show up and we all look like you know Burger King in here and we're all with long beards and we're all wearing gowns and we're all just trying to look the part and we feel that we've achieved some sort of sacredness or some sort of Glory but he says that's not that would be easy it' be easy to do that oh I wish that just growing a measly beard like this would make me more Christlike but it has nothing to do with it what kind of image was he now ye are light ye are the light of the world we could ask what kind of image was he and I believe that your life should be the answer amen it may not be the complete and total answer but if somebody wants to know what Christ is today and what image he's in today your life should be reflecting that not not in a snapshot not in a self-portrait not just in an image where we quickly view you but something about your life is declaring The Narrative and the story of the nature and character of God we could all look the part in church and we could all say well they were really Christlike and God had his way but it's your life that begins to unfold and it answers the question what kind of image he is in this hour amen sir I'm part of the mystery unveiling the nature of Christ Colossians 1: 12-13 giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light again it's that disposition of light without light there is no beauty without light there is no color light is intrinsic in art and even in darkness there should be a great deal of light that falls on everything until the bride is taken out of the way there's no more color there's no more life there's no more Beauty because we are partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness you were sometimes Darkness but now are you light we have been delivered from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom the kingdom Reign this Kingdom of Light of his dear son that we too could be like him I had considered entitling this uh painters of light I had kind of a dig at Thomas concade who is the self-professed painter of light nobody ever called him that he called that he called himself that and then Trey marked the term so I didn't want to got a didn't want to get a copyright strike or something from his estate but brother bam says and Christ identified the same in all generations there's even a connection of those titles he was using to works of art he says now remember don't forget our theme is and our text that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now my my text subject for tonight is Christ identified the same in all generations he's identified by his characteristics he he's identified in his word Christ revealed in his own word is another way of uh putting these sermon titles Christ identified the same in all generations now the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever and we want to know how he could be how we'd recognize him are we looking for a Rembrant are we looking for a Hoffman what are we looking uh for a Leonardo uh Rafael what is it what's the image we're trying to find to see Christ if he's here just as he was any other time then we'd like to know how he is recognized Among Us amen there's so many people have so many different ideas about him each one as an individual try to draw up our ideas about Christ what he was what he looks like and how the psychologist has painted the picture this is a Salman Salman head of Christ probably recognize this many of you probably recognize this type of art brother it says like Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 or Salon in different ones but we see we don't know he looked like that think of the the exercise of one trying to characterize this and it's not belittling if I could say this that when men rendered images like this it wasn't art for Arts sake they're trying convey a parable there's works of art that spelled uh like seven Works of Mercy H and these and some of these paintings that in the very image there's a sermon after sermon and scripture after scripture and there's a lot of symbolism and details trying to convey a moral message is trying to trying to share something it has usefulness beyond the the talent and the technicality of the art itself amen he says no matter how much this would even capture his physical image he says we don't know that he looked like that so we could never understand what he looked like by just painting a picture sir if somebody would come to the platform among us and have scars in his hands and nail prints and Thorn prints on his forehead and bleeding that wouldn't be Christ because when he comes every eye shall see him and every knee shall bow when that body returns to Earth again but what why could he be the same yesterday today and forever then we have to learn now what he is we have to learn what he is and the whole world now if I could say this about modern religion modern Christianity and if we're not careful it becomes a very the the message of the hour is just right lock in step with it maybe just a little bit of behind or message churches just a little bit behind schedule and they become art for art sake and you'll never see what God is in that sir you'll never see who Christ is you can never learn who Christ is Sir when it's art for art sake amen we need to learn what he is in order to know what he looks like today Jeremiah 13:16 give glory to the Lord your God notice how there's this urgency to it give glory to God before he caused darkness and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains and while you look for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross Darkness this is a great warning to give glory to God Amen give him the glory turn your eyes to him yes sir before he cause the light to be taken away and your Candlestick to be removed give glory to God seek his face before your feet stumble in darkness when you're looking for light and he turns it all to the shadow of death and makes it gross Darkness I say this with some with some Authority based upon the message of the hour religion and Christianity have all become mausoleums of Art yes sir or modern museums of Modern Art amen where all there is is abstraction and false Beauty and people are falling for it wow isn't this amazing isn't this beautiful and it's nothing more than false Beauty amen but there is on earth a living exhibit it's not Arizona Believers Church but it's those who are beholding the beauty of the Lord not a duct tape banana to a wall not comedians that was the name of that piece to Art you know uh comedy is art for the purpose of amusement that's what that's what it's become is a comedy brother Reggie shared this quote with me on Sunday I just feel It just fits perfectly here as we close this service when I was uh looking at life imitates art I had found many of those places where brother bam said that when he saw something he imitated it and he wanted to be uh you know would act out these scenes and that was the basis of the phrase originally life imitates art because the the author witnessed his own Sons reading these old stories and then acting them out in life and so brother bradam says when I was a little boy I read Edgar Rice's Burrows Edgar Rice Burrows Tarzan of the Apes I cut my mother's fur rug up to impersonate arzan this is a first edition this is what it would have looked like way back then with the time that brother Brandon may have read it they started coming out with subsequent editions but it says I remember reading Tarzan of the Apes and I cut my mother's fur rug up to impersonate Tarzan what would cause him to do that what he read what inspired him what he begin to imagine in his mind what it would be like and what it would feel like when I read the Lone Star Ranger I rode a hobby horse everywhere I went and there's the the book that he would have read what what was it that he read something that was maybe art for art sake and yet had inspired him but what did he represent what he had read but there was no truth in it but one day I picked up the Bible one day I picked up the Bible since then my desire is to be like him God let me let his life so flow through me may I clean myself away professing to be dead for 31 years now that Jesus might reflect himself only way I know he can do it is by his word just to be like Jesus oh yes just to be like Jesus what is it we're beholding I'm telling you right now there's a lot of art for art sake there's a lot of entertainment for entertainment sake that we spend a lot of our T time amusing ourselves with listen I love a good meme any time of the day but what is it for it's to amuse us it's caus us to laugh it's for volty it's art for art sake and the more we look at that the more that we're going to reflect that and unless we can get our eyes back to the word of God beholding that we'll never be the light Bringers that we are called to be thank you Lord one day I picked up the Bible and that's when the desires changed yes sir yes sir what God has written in his word what he has spoken in his word in this hour he wants to be displayed in flesh this the phrase that you should constant remember a life lived by the word would be the word expressed our life should imitate art and that your life would reflect the beauty of the Lord Brothers you could come to your instruments tonight if we can behold his Beauty in the word we'll learn his principles of beauty because it's not just art for art sake we're not just going to look at like wow that's a that's a banana and that's duct tape and people like this and everybody's wondering what this is but you're going to see something something in it because the word of God the Bible the scriptures given by inspiration brother Bram said it's the art of God he's the artist he's the author and it's it's for reproof and instruction it's profitable it's not just word for word sake it has a meaning and a purpose and intent to mold you as we read his word as we listen to the message of the art we're learning true principles of beauty it's art for God's sake where he wants to use your life not for the purpose of you bragging about how Christian you are but so that it would draw others to Christ I think we get super defensive sometimes when we hear criticisms of of the message and some of the ways that it's run down and dragged through the mud and they could go on a a two- week long series of articles that hit the front page of a newspaper just dragging the message through the mud and we might get our Gander up about it but you know if you're honest with yourselves you said some of the same things about people people in the message about church experiences and I'm not saying you were necessarily right but some of us have seen nothing but art for art sake and it it didn't attract us it didn't draw us if anything we just kind of bared it and just wanted to see the clothes so that we didn't appear to be unbelievers and we wanted to pretend it was right and it was good like yeah it's okay if we get beat up by the deacons right right it's okay this is good this is good right they're going to beat the devil out of us people endured things for the sake of Conformity and fear and everyone blending in and looking the same and what what what did that do it pushed people away and were honest for good reason but God is calling us to be the kind of light that others can see not everybody's going to see it but they'll see it and it'll draw them to him when he says now you are light and he prayed that we would share Glory it was not that we would that our life would be seen or that our light would shine but it would be his light his glory and it's actually that that hides your life that the more of him that could be expressed the less of you that is seen and the more that you exhibit Christ this life is light for the world today I want to finish from reading that devotional I just read to you a moment ago or this collection of morning devotions at this Theological Seminary in the 1800s he writes this way I'll try to express it in a way that doesn't seem to be too uh too much anent language but indeed there's rarely much that is glorious or great about so slightly or evanescent of a thing a thing as a human life in other words human life in itself isn't really glorious and nothing really radiant or evanescent about it he says the glory of it lies in it being able to say the glory that thou Hast given me I give them this is the real glory the real light of a human life is to be able to say its real powers and be able to say the glory that I have received I give them the worth of life is in its transmissive capacity in your ability to shine light in your ability to reprove and make manifest in the wonderful system of the telephone I love this this is great written in the 1800s uh 1890s or so in the wonderful system of the telephone with its Miracle of intercommunication there is as you know at each instrument that little film of metal which we call the transmitter into which the message is delivered and whose vibrations are repeated scores of miles away real brother Bram uses the same example in some of his sermons about a microphone and a transmitter he says every human life is a transmitter take away from it its transmissive purpose and what a poor insignificant film a human life may be yes sir but set it where it belongs in the great system where it has its part and that insignificant film is dignified with a new significance it is if it is as if it said to its God the message that thou givest me I give to them and every word of God that is spoken into it is delivered through it to the lives that are wearily waiting for the message as though it were far away I know it may describe it in a language that children can't understand today and some of us have gotten so far away from but perhaps another analogy could be given to the very technology that exists within our computers and our phones and our iPads to say that that peace in itself is insignificant but once it's incorporated into the great system that insignificant peace is dignified with a new significance as if it has said to God the message which you are giving me I give them and every light that you shine into me every word that you speak into me I will deliver it through my life and to the lives of those those that are eagerly and wearily waiting for the message even though they may be far away oh God let me be light for your sake notice when we read it that we might be glorified that men might see let your light shine so that men would see your good works and in doing so go my that brother Michael's quite a guy isn't he they would glorify their father your father which is in heaven we're to we are to be art for God's sake not for the church's sake not for your Pride's sake if it's for yourself you're complete in yourself you're art for art sake if it's merely to give pleasure to other people to impress other people that's art for Arts sake but when you can be a light for their sake and for God's sake that's light let's pray tonight you could stand to your feet thank you for your attention the feedback has been encouraging though I realize that maybe in some ways it's a unique way to approach the word but there's a lot in here for us to be encouraged by step into our place and our position in this hour our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we believe that the whole world is groping in darkness and that as long as we are HID as long as we are allowing the word World itself to shut out our light and to keep us covered up with complexes and insecurities and as long as we're hiding behind pretense and vanity This Little Light of Mine is never going to shine and if it shines not Lord then who's going to see you who's going to know you I pray Lord that you would let my life be a reflection let it be a voice Lord as a song is sung ain't no stone going to sing in my place as long as I'm alive I'll glorify and praise your name I want it to Lord I need it to so Lord I know nothing else but to ask that your light would shine on me Let It Shine into my heart let the light of this glorious gospel shine into me that I might see and know this glorious image of you that I would not just behold your beauty but understand that this is a sh shed in transmuted mitted beauty that there is a Transfiguration again in this hour where I am coming into your image and the flesh is becoming word as unorthodox as that may seem and as unreal as that may seem that is the realism in this hour is that as the word impresses us there is this new Renaissance Lord there is this new Revolution of faith and belief where God is being expressed in flesh again and Lord I pray that we would not let Art For Art's Sake and that movement that wants to stoke our imaginations and our emotions to Thrill us in our minds either to intellect or emotion may it not sway us from this godsent truth that you're here in our midst revealing yourself the same yesterday today and forever and revealing to us through your word who you are that we can manifest you your nature and your character thank you Lord and Lord I pray that we would not find Value in things that are lies things that are untrue and things that exist merely for art sake or the abstract or the false Beauty and where Lord we can't seem to make sense of the picture and things aren't clear may you shine your light on it so that your beauty could Inspire us to Greater Beauty and more Beauty in our lives bless your people tonight I pray be with us as we are dismissed and you encourage us greatly Lord in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
