[0:00] Isaiah chap 11 verses 9 and 10 and I'm
[0:03] jumping into the middle of this reading
[0:05] I've been studying from verse one even
[0:07] on uh through the whole chapter actually
[0:10] and there's a lot there if some of you
[0:11] want to go back and read through this
[0:13] you'll be able to steal some of my
[0:14] thunder to kind of catch the full
[0:16] picture for this but I'm just going to
[0:18] focus on one portion of verse 10 today
[0:21] but there's a lot of context here in
[0:23] this that you need that you need to
[0:25] really understand the full thrust of
[0:27] what's being expressed here they shall
[0:28] not hurt nor destroy and all my Holy
[0:30] Mountain for the Earth shall be full of
[0:34] the knowledge of the Lord as the waters
[0:36] cover the sea and in that day there
[0:39] shall be a root of Jesse which shall
[0:41] stand for an ins sign of the people to
[0:44] it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest
[0:47] shall be glorious amen God bless you you
[0:50] can be
[0:51] seated just pray for me tonight as we
[0:53] get started it's still just feeling
[0:55] pretty weak in my body tonight maybe a
[0:57] little bit my voice in my throat but we
[0:59] trust that by God's grace we'll be able
[1:01] to deliver what's in our
[1:03] hearts my title is uh anointed by
[1:07] accepting him hopefully going to come to
[1:09] a statement later on in the Christ is
[1:11] the mystery God revealed that kind of
[1:12] gives some context to that was wrestling
[1:15] with uh just exactly how to title this I
[1:18] sometimes want or most of the time I
[1:19] want you to be able to look at your
[1:21] notes or hear the title and it kind of
[1:23] give you some idea of where we're at in
[1:25] the scripture and and itself speak to
[1:27] you uh this kind of was quickened to me
[1:29] this afternoon
[1:30] really fitting for this introductory
[1:32] part of going into Isaiah 11 anointed by
[1:35] accepting him now if you look at
[1:37] Revelations chap 21 I'm just going to
[1:39] jump right into a lot of places we've
[1:41] been lately so I feel that we can do
[1:43] this says in verse three and I heard a
[1:45] great voice out of Heaven saying this is
[1:47] after we see the New Jerusalem the city
[1:50] of God descend Out of Heaven from God
[1:52] and come to the Earth the new Heaven and
[1:54] new earth the Tabernacle of God is with
[1:57] men behold the Tabernacle of God God is
[2:00] with men and he will dwell with them and
[2:02] they shall be his people and God himself
[2:04] shall be with them and be their God and
[2:07] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[2:09] eyes and there shall be no more death
[2:12] neither sorrow no crying neither shall
[2:13] there be any more pain for the former
[2:16] things are passed away if you think
[2:18] about uh the sermon we ministered on no
[2:21] more Shadows we saw that God used things
[2:24] throughout uses things throughout time
[2:26] and on Earth to signify something to
[2:28] foreshadow something and then when the
[2:30] substance comes maybe there's no use for
[2:32] the shadow anymore and we could say the
[2:34] same about sorrow and crying and pain
[2:37] that God uses those things to perfect
[2:39] our character he uses them to get our
[2:41] attention and godly sorrow leads to
[2:42] repentance and a lot of these things
[2:44] that are here in this scripture that God
[2:46] has used during time he'll have no need
[2:49] for them anymore they'll have no purpose
[2:50] in God's economy so all the former
[2:53] things even death which is just used to
[2:54] bring a Believer into the presence of
[2:56] God that will have no use anymore so
[2:58] there'll be no more death no pain no
[3:00] sorrow no crime as he wipes all the
[3:02] tears from her eyes and all the former
[3:04] things are passed away and it says that
[3:07] God the Tabernacle of God will be with
[3:09] men and he will dwell with them and so
[3:12] here we see that God is now fully
[3:14] tabernacled not just in Shadows or types
[3:17] not just in Spirit uh not just in in in
[3:20] measure but he is fully tabernacled in
[3:22] this New Jerusalem he's reached his
[3:24] expression he's achieved what he's
[3:25] wanted to achieve his purpose is
[3:28] fulfilled so now the new Jerusalem
[3:30] Christ and his bride uh in that place
[3:33] become the habitation of God it's where
[3:35] God is dwelling where God is manifesting
[3:37] as brother B uses the term God is
[3:39] resident with man and that takes place
[3:42] here as we read it in Revelations 21
[3:44] want you to get this thought of now God
[3:46] is saying here is where I dwell on earth
[3:49] now for all eternity and in the sermon
[3:52] the future home of the Heavenly
[3:54] bridegroom and the Earthly bride we've
[3:55] been mentioning how that brother brandom
[3:57] connects the Redemption of the
[3:59] individual to the world's Redemption so
[4:01] as we look at this stage of of Eternity
[4:05] or this setting of Eternity God comes
[4:08] down to dwell and he's going to be
[4:09] dwelling in the earth and God's
[4:10] habitation is be upon the Earth and so
[4:13] this is the Earth's Redemption and the
[4:15] stages that God goes through to redeem
[4:17] the individual he goes through to redeem
[4:19] the Earth and that's been an important
[4:20] parallel that we've been tracking and so
[4:22] brother M makes this statement God has
[4:24] tabernacled in Man by redeeming him by
[4:27] these three processes we know that's
[4:29] justification sanctification baptism of
[4:31] the Holy Ghost we see that as we kind of
[4:33] break it out that's the new birth he
[4:36] says that God has tabernacled Man by
[4:38] redeeming him through this process now
[4:40] God is going to redeem the Earth in
[4:42] Tabernacle in the Earth this is what we
[4:44] read in Revelations 21 God is going to
[4:46] redeem the Earth and Tabernacle in the
[4:48] Earth with his subjects of the earth
[4:50] which he brought forth from the earth
[4:52] and through sin it fell he had to let he
[4:54] let it go had to let it go on but now he
[4:57] sent Jesus to redeem that Fallen Earth
[4:59] Earth which we are a part of now this uh
[5:04] these steps to me are important to uh
[5:06] just really anchor this down in our
[5:07] hearts because to me this is the real
[5:08] key from this sermon future home what
[5:11] God does to redeem the individual so
[5:12] that he can Tabernacle in the individual
[5:15] God's going to do the Earth so you see a
[5:17] parallel what God does to the Earth he
[5:18] does to the individual God does to the
[5:20] Earth he does to the individual and now
[5:22] God is going to come and dwell or
[5:24] Tabernacle in the earth and brother B
[5:26] says well what he does to Tabernacle in
[5:28] the earth he's already for shadowed it
[5:30] by doing that to you amen brought you
[5:32] through a process of redemption so he
[5:34] could dwell in you he says it again in
[5:36] another place in future home to redeem
[5:37] the earth now it's been Justified it's
[5:40] been Sanctified called and claimed now
[5:42] it's to receive its baptism of fire and
[5:44] be cleansed for Jesus and his bride and
[5:48] you are these other parts that's draw up
[5:50] out of the earth the earth your he says
[5:53] the Earth that you're a part of the
[5:55] earth your body so as he said that he
[5:58] sent Jesus to redeem the Fallen Earth
[5:59] which we are a part of he comes back to
[6:01] or maybe I'm a little bit earlier in
[6:03] this he says he's going to redeem the
[6:05] Earth your body is a part of the earth
[6:07] so this was something someone shared
[6:08] with me that some of the things just
[6:10] really anchored in their mind about
[6:12] eternity uh when they realize that's
[6:14] right we're we come from the earth these
[6:16] bodies are redeemed and this Earth is a
[6:19] is part of God's Plan of Redemption so
[6:20] God's going to give Redemption to the
[6:22] Earth and it really connects things to
[6:24] see that so to redeem the Earth it's
[6:26] been Justified Sanctified and it's going
[6:28] to receive the bap ISM of fire which is
[6:30] the three processes that we go through
[6:32] for God to Tabernacle in US says it
[6:35] again now now compare what we see with
[6:37] our own eyes what God has done to redeem
[6:39] this world he's done the same plan to
[6:41] redeem his people we're using this again
[6:45] repetition just to kind of anchor this
[6:46] in our hearts what God does to the
[6:48] individual he does to the Earth and if
[6:50] there's a three-part process to redeem
[6:52] us there's a three-part process to
[6:53] redeem the Earth and and that's the
[6:56] process of redemption now I say that and
[6:58] there's a lot that comes with Redemption
[7:00] Beyond just saying he Tabernacles or
[7:03] he's resident because it's going to take
[7:05] all eternity once the Earth is redeemed
[7:07] to unfold what that Redemption really
[7:09] means so we know that he says is the
[7:12] same Plan of Redemption is used to
[7:13] redeem both the world and the persons
[7:15] that live in it he says in the sermon
[7:17] who is this mezic the stages of Eternal
[7:19] purpose he had in his secret has now
[7:21] been revealed there's still three stages
[7:24] to Perfection just like he redeems the
[7:26] world the same way he redeems his church
[7:28] he redeems the people in three
[7:34] stages so with giving some of that
[7:37] background tonight some of that
[7:39] Foundation we notice that this Plan of
[7:41] Redemption for the Earth parallels The
[7:44] Plan of Salvation for the individual now
[7:47] we've read in Numbers chapter 14: 21 and
[7:50] this is where I'm uh building off of
[7:52] this thought this process of redemption
[7:54] what God does to the individual he does
[7:56] to the Earth says but as truly as I live
[7:58] the Earth shall be filled with the glory
[8:00] of the Lord and the last two sermons we
[8:03] preached was to show that if the Earth
[8:04] is going to be filled with his glory
[8:06] then there's a measure of Glory in my
[8:07] life that's going to fill me that this
[8:10] my life is going to be filled with his
[8:12] glory this Earth is going to be filled
[8:13] with his glory I'm going to manifest my
[8:15] measure of Glory his glory is to fill us
[8:18] I may not have all the fullness of God
[8:20] in the way that Christ had it but all
[8:22] that I have can be fully God that he's
[8:25] to dwell in me he's to take full
[8:27] possession and I I kind of held off on
[8:30] this statement but I think it just has a
[8:31] lot of weight to it tonight in the
[8:33] sermon oness brother R says he's talking
[8:35] about how that some of you got just
[8:37] enough anointing enough Holy Ghost to
[8:39] quit you're lying and cheating and
[8:40] stealing quit smoking a and sometimes
[8:43] you have just enough of an experience in
[8:45] church with God to where we stop doing
[8:47] certain things but God just doesn't want
[8:48] to challenge us and move within the
[8:51] emotional realm to Quicken us to some
[8:53] sort of discipline or putting things
[8:55] away but he really he wants to Anchor in
[8:57] our hearts a a and give us the Holy
[9:00] Ghost down in our souls and then once
[9:01] we've received that in our souls now he
[9:03] says God wants to fill every fiber of
[9:05] his church he says he wants to fill your
[9:08] thinking he wants to fill your mind he
[9:09] wants to fill every bit of you just make
[9:12] you completely totally dead to yourself
[9:14] or to your thinking just so surrender to
[9:16] God till his word is just living right
[9:19] through you this is God's plan this is
[9:21] his objective the very ultimate
[9:23] objective of God is to declare his glory
[9:26] now where is it going to be declared
[9:27] it's going to be declared in you it's
[9:29] going to be declared in flesh and God
[9:30] wants to not just feel your soul but he
[9:32] wants to F every fiber of your being
[9:35] where that Christ that's down on the
[9:36] inside who has who in all the fullness
[9:38] of God dwells he wants to just radiate
[9:40] out from that place pulsating through
[9:43] you living through you governing your
[9:45] thoughts and your responses a and
[9:47] manifesting himself through your person
[9:50] so I'd say that as God has taken will
[9:53] take the Earth through these three
[9:55] processes and it says that his glory
[9:57] will fill the Earth then I'm saying that
[10:00] if the glory will fill the Earth then
[10:01] the glory of God can fill
[10:04] you then Isaiah
[10:07] 11:9 just thank you for your help this
[10:09] evening you're being very attentive and
[10:11] Isaiah
[10:13] 11:9 he says they shall not hurt nor
[10:15] destroy in all my Holy
[10:19] Mountain
[10:21] there's some references there that you
[10:24] could go back and read and kind of pick
[10:25] up the full picture of what he's looking
[10:27] at but they shall not hurt nor destroy
[10:29] in all my Holy Mountain it gives the
[10:31] image of Zion there gives us this image
[10:34] of of some Perfection some uh the the
[10:37] the the Zion Kingdom it says for the
[10:40] Earth shall be full of the knowledge of
[10:42] the Lord as the waters cover the sea now
[10:45] if you stayed with me just through these
[10:47] first uh 15 minutes or so that should
[10:50] click right there already what I'm
[10:52] aiming at that if the whole earth is
[10:53] going to be full of his glory and then
[10:55] we're g we need to be full of his glory
[10:57] the Bible says the Earth shall be full
[10:59] of the knowledge of the Lord as the
[11:01] waters cover the sea and this parallel
[11:03] process we see to the Earth then we're
[11:05] seeing this parallel process for us as a
[11:07] Believer I hope it's adding layers to
[11:09] your life or gives you some meaning and
[11:11] sense and purpose sometimes well you
[11:13] need the Holy Ghost you need the Holy
[11:14] Ghost and you need the Holy Ghost we
[11:16] need to be born again you must be born
[11:17] again and there's just this little
[11:19] disconnect sometimes in our minds we say
[11:21] well now that I've received the Holy
[11:22] Ghost now that I've been born again uh
[11:24] what's next and it can just kind of have
[11:25] this idea well you just need to buy time
[11:27] until we can find that last soul and
[11:29] they're all going to leave no this is
[11:31] that's when it all starts that's when
[11:33] the real sweetness begins and the
[11:34] journey with God and Walking with God
[11:36] and things getting greater and God said
[11:37] I want to fill every fiber of your being
[11:39] I'm living in your soul that I can live
[11:41] in every every part and aspect of your
[11:43] life so here it says the Earth shall be
[11:45] full of the knowledge of the Lord as the
[11:47] waters cover the
[11:49] sea it's describing a time when the
[11:52] knowledge of the Lord is going to fill
[11:53] up the Earth entirely there going to be
[11:55] some uh dominance of the knowledge of
[11:58] the Lord so some filling up I try to
[12:00] give some more color to that here in a
[12:02] moment I want to focus on this phrase as
[12:04] the waters cover the sea quite a
[12:08] statement uh actually I guess if you
[12:09] read it it might be kind of confusing I
[12:11] thought the W Seas were Waters but the
[12:14] the phrasing there though it might be
[12:15] obscured by the way that they translate
[12:17] as the waters cover the sea it's
[12:20] dividing between the waters the actual
[12:23] substance of the H2O and the salt water
[12:25] and the depths and the bottom of the sea
[12:28] so the sea is just not merely comprised
[12:30] of water with endless depth but there's
[12:32] some depth to it and so it says that the
[12:35] knowledge of the Lord shall fill the
[12:38] Earth as the waters cover or fill the
[12:42] sea and I want you to uh uh really take
[12:45] this picture in your mind as some of the
[12:47] tallest I guess you say tallest
[12:48] mountains on Earth are below water and
[12:50] some of the deepest valleys are are
[12:52] below below the surface of the water but
[12:54] the ocean water covers every crevice
[12:56] every trench every cap spreading out to
[12:59] all sorts of inlets a a and the the Sea
[13:02] and the Sea Flor and every cave it's all
[13:06] filled up with the
[13:08] water and water we know will flow
[13:10] downhill naturally from the highest
[13:13] point to the lowest point a and and
[13:15] that's what governs the the the
[13:17] direction of of water but ultimately
[13:19] it's gravity which is the Ultimate Force
[13:22] that's working upon the water and it
[13:24] it'll it'll follow this is the part if
[13:26] you could just kind of catch this L to
[13:28] me when I was just kind of arranging
[13:29] where these scriptures going to be I was
[13:31] like I could stop right here I know who
[13:33] wants me to but it's going to depend on
[13:35] how hard you amen when don't we make
[13:37] this point but it's going to follow the
[13:39] path of least resistance that water is
[13:41] going to wherever there'll be a yielding
[13:43] to it the water is going to cover it up
[13:45] wherever there's going to be an opening
[13:46] up to it the water's going to cover up
[13:48] and it's going to flow downhill that's
[13:50] why sometimes your neighbor can be in a
[13:51] flood plane and you may not be because
[13:53] you're on a higher level than for many
[13:56] miles or a long stretch cuz the water is
[13:58] not going to going to rise first it's
[13:59] going to flow downhill and fill
[14:01] everything up before it gets higher if
[14:04] we want to go higher maybe we going need
[14:05] to go a little bit deeper and let our
[14:07] experience get a little bit richer and
[14:09] that water that's going to cover every
[14:11] all the part of the earth gravity is
[14:13] this Force upon it and it's going to
[14:15] take the path the path of least
[14:17] resistance I say let's not resist the
[14:20] floods not resist the
[14:22] water let it
[14:24] flow so it's as the waters spread
[14:27] themselves over the bottom of the ocean
[14:28] of the Seas and entirely fill all the
[14:31] channels of the sea so shall the
[14:34] knowledge of the Lord spread like that
[14:36] until the Earth is completely covered so
[14:39] as the water we look in the ocean and
[14:41] they don't find a little pocket dry
[14:43] pocket in the bottom of the sea they
[14:46] don't find a dry trench and they just go
[14:48] well we sent something down there and we
[14:49] finally got to a spot where it's dry
[14:51] just nothing was down there I it it's it
[14:55] pervades it it flows it fills everything
[14:58] up and so that's a quite a picture that
[15:00] this writer is wanting us to see in our
[15:02] minds that just as the oceans are filled
[15:05] up so God's knowledge is to fill the
[15:08] Earth completely cover
[15:10] it now another point that we want to
[15:13] look at tonight is that the knowledge of
[15:14] the lord it's God's
[15:17] knowledge and it's not necessarily
[15:20] speaking of our knowledge of
[15:24] him because even as we read last service
[15:27] I believe it was that there's there's a
[15:28] knowledge that passeth knowledge a
[15:31] wisdom or understanding that passeth
[15:32] knowledge in other words it's like it
[15:33] can't really be
[15:35] known like this isn't something you
[15:36] could just learn this is just something
[15:38] you could pick up and read and figure
[15:39] out so this knowledge that we have
[15:41] passes knowledge and that it's not
[15:43] really something you just figure out or
[15:44] no it's got to be something divinely
[15:46] revealed and if we could look at it from
[15:48] this perspective I think it kind of
[15:49] helps click in a lot of ways that when
[15:51] it says the knowledge of the Lord is the
[15:54] Lord's knowledge or God's knowledge and
[15:55] it means his opinion it means his
[15:59] judgment it means his discernment so
[16:02] it's not just that everyone's like God
[16:04] oh yeah I know him but God I know him
[16:06] completely know him inside out know
[16:07] everything about him well it's going to
[16:09] take eternity to reveal him well I
[16:10] already know it it's all there got it
[16:12] all figured out no it means God's
[16:13] knowledge is his judgment his opinion
[16:16] his discernment in 1st Samuel chapter
[16:19] 2:3 I think this scripture will help
[16:21] bring this
[16:24] out Hannah's
[16:26] praying and
[16:30] it the this part here may be the
[16:33] boasting of the other wife that she's
[16:35] rorting to who was so proud of how many
[16:38] children she had Hannah having none but
[16:40] she says talk no more so exceeding
[16:44] proud let not arrogancy come out of your
[16:47] mouth and then she makes this statement
[16:49] that I believe stands regardless of who
[16:51] she's directing it too it fits for all
[16:53] time and purpose for the Lord is a god
[16:56] of knowledge and by him actions are
[17:00] weighed doesn't mean that God's just
[17:02] really really smart and and got a really
[17:04] big brain and a high IQ it's God is the
[17:07] Lord is a god of knowledge and by him
[17:10] actions are weighed no it's Hannah is
[17:13] declaring that God knows the heart God
[17:16] knows the ways of man God knows what
[17:18] motivates man God knows what makes man
[17:20] click he knows what is his motivation
[17:22] and his ambition God judges a man's
[17:25] motive and objective when he says that
[17:27] God is a god of knowledge that the Earth
[17:29] will be full of the knowledge of the
[17:30] Lord it speaks of a discernment and a
[17:33] recognition of things in the heart and
[17:35] maybe we'll come to this in a future
[17:37] service and and this has some thrust if
[17:39] I can just go ahead and say it now that
[17:41] as you read uh chapter 11 there's
[17:44] something about this judgment and this
[17:46] discernment and this knowledge where it
[17:48] says they shall not hurt nor destroy in
[17:50] all my Holy Mountain it's the knowledge
[17:52] of the Lord that's somehow holding that
[17:54] at
[17:55] Bay and if I'm wanting to bring a
[17:57] parallel for us that we can have the
[17:59] knowledge of the Lord that fills up our
[18:01] being it's going to be the very thing
[18:03] that knows motives and objectives and
[18:05] influences in detours and all sorts of
[18:08] things that can try to happen to an
[18:09] individual and through the knowledge of
[18:11] God we can say whoa buddy that's enough
[18:14] that's right I was listening to a sermon
[18:18] just uh such an incredible testimony
[18:20] that I could share personally I began to
[18:22] listen to it last
[18:24] night and then I I I I I at a certain
[18:29] point I had fell asleep and so this
[18:31] morning I went back to the part I
[18:32] thought I was about at when I'd fallen
[18:34] asleep and um Elizabeth had finished
[18:37] listening to it I hadn't finished
[18:38] listening to it yet and she said did you
[18:40] finish listening to that and I said I I
[18:43] I hadn't yet she said it's just so
[18:45] profound and so spot on to some things
[18:47] in our lives and she said I thought
[18:48] maybe you picked it out just for those
[18:50] very reasons said I I hadn't even
[18:52] listened to that part yet I fast
[18:53] forwarded to the very end to listen to
[18:55] it and brother Bram it just it was so
[18:58] personal for me so wonderful and but he
[19:00] talks about in a particular instance he
[19:02] says he mentions the meanness of Satan
[19:05] and just how mean the Devil is a and
[19:08] this is and how cruel the world is to
[19:10] people how mean the devil is to people
[19:13] and I believe that God's knowledge is to
[19:14] recognize Satan's how he tries to take
[19:17] advantage of us and recognize the devil
[19:19] and every one of his tricks that's what
[19:21] it means to have the knowledge of the
[19:25] lord it's something that knows the pride
[19:27] of man and the heart of man the Lord is
[19:30] a god of
[19:32] knowledge this is what the knowledge of
[19:34] the Lord means in Jeremiah 17:9 and 10
[19:36] the heart is deceitful above all things
[19:38] and desperately wicked who can know it
[19:40] wouldn't you want to know it when even
[19:43] ourselves sometimes our hearts work
[19:45] against us and motivate and influence it
[19:47] us in a way and we're pretty sure about
[19:49] it and we think we know but our hearts
[19:51] are even deceiving us now if we really
[19:53] just took a moment to ponder that we
[19:56] might get locked up tonight be like oh
[19:57] my goodness this is
[19:59] scary I can't believe I'm even trying to
[20:01] live this thing out can't even trust my
[20:03] own heart but he says I the Lord search
[20:06] the heart I try the Reigns that's the
[20:10] seat of emotion and
[20:12] affection even use that word of the
[20:14] kidneys or something that it's bound up
[20:16] in that I the Lord search the heart I
[20:19] try the Reigns even to give every man
[20:21] according to his ways and according to
[20:23] the fruit of his
[20:27] doings
[20:30] this is the knowledge of the Lord so
[20:33] when it says that for the Earth shall be
[20:34] full of the knowledge of the Lord it
[20:36] shall be full of a correct understanding
[20:38] of things right is that
[20:41] awesome I I hope that's awesome to you I
[20:43] built a whole sermon around
[20:45] that just maybe a whole portion of this
[20:48] series around that thought that the
[20:50] knowledge of the lord it's going to be
[20:51] full of the correct way of seeing things
[20:54] amen it's gonna there's going to be the
[20:56] correct view there's going to be the
[20:59] Earth is going to have some fullness of
[21:01] the the the understanding of God's
[21:03] Perfections and his plan and the claims
[21:05] of God what God wants done how things
[21:09] ought to be operated how things ought to
[21:11] be the Earth is going to be full of the
[21:13] correct understanding of
[21:16] things so as we read that and we get
[21:19] this picture in our minds as the waters
[21:21] cover the sea the Earth shall be full of
[21:23] the knowledge of the lord well I've been
[21:25] told not to apologize so I don't know
[21:28] how I can phrase this without
[21:30] apologizing but as a lawyer I could
[21:32] probably figure it
[21:33] out I hope you're not sorry for coming
[21:36] tonight if you felt that I oversold the
[21:42] sermon but the infinite wisdom of God
[21:45] this eternal wisdom of God will prevail
[21:47] pervade the whole
[21:50] earth and it's not just again it's not
[21:54] that the everyone on Earth is going to
[21:56] be like got it all appear not every it's
[21:59] not that the whole earth is everyone
[22:00] everything's going to have the knowledge
[22:02] of God or the knowledge of the Divine I
[22:04] don't think that's the right way to look
[22:05] at this but there's
[22:07] some if I could even use this by way of
[22:10] analogy this is pointing to a time I
[22:12] want you to have that in your mind it's
[22:13] pointing to a time when the whole earth
[22:15] is going to be full of the knowledge of
[22:16] the Lord and even now it's being filled
[22:19] with the knowledge of the Lord as the
[22:20] word is preached as the word is
[22:22] expressed a a and the world is without
[22:24] excuse that's right creation itself is
[22:27] declared God's glory declares declaring
[22:30] the mind of God and creation speaks of
[22:32] something Divine and eternal so that the
[22:34] Bible says they're without excuse as we
[22:37] read already in Psalm 19: 1-6 I know we
[22:39] read all these verses earlier I want to
[22:41] read them again in this context so we
[22:43] could recognize how the knowledge of the
[22:45] Lord is going to fill up the whole earth
[22:48] it has one through whom it's being
[22:51] expressed there's something declaring it
[22:54] something radiating it it's not that
[22:56] everyone on the earth had any given time
[22:58] or animal life and plant life and all
[23:00] those things we're going to say are
[23:01] going to have some actual knowledge of
[23:03] God but there's going to be some justice
[23:06] and judgment in the people of God that's
[23:08] unhindered unrestricted not governed by
[23:11] a deceitful heart not influenced by the
[23:13] unkindness of man and it's going to
[23:15] Reign and Rule throughout the entire
[23:17] world the Bible says the heavens declare
[23:20] the glory of God and the firmament
[23:22] showeth his handiwork day unto Day utth
[23:25] speech and night unto night showeth
[23:28] knowledge now this is where we can just
[23:31] see in the heavens that the sun and the
[23:33] moon and the stars they're speaking
[23:35] they're declaring God's glory then it
[23:37] says there's no speech nor language
[23:39] where their voice is not heard so now
[23:42] it's showing that there's some
[23:43] expression in the heavens of God's glory
[23:46] to the Earth says their line has gone
[23:48] out through all the Earth and their
[23:50] words to the end of the world notice
[23:53] that image of how these these lights are
[23:57] filling up the Earth Earth it's
[23:58] broadcasting things expressing things
[24:00] showing things and maybe not everything
[24:02] on Earth is that light not everything on
[24:05] Earth is is reflecting that light but
[24:08] the light's there right says in them
[24:09] hath he set a tabernacle of the for the
[24:11] sun which is as a bridegroom coming out
[24:13] of his chamber and rejoices as a strong
[24:15] man to run a race his going forth is
[24:17] from the end of heaven and his circuit
[24:18] under the ends of it and there is
[24:21] nothing hid from the heat
[24:24] thereof the whole world is not the son
[24:29] nor does the whole world and all that in
[24:31] it have it the have that light but all
[24:33] are under its influence true that has
[24:37] some impact in some way this chain
[24:40] reaction of the sunlight upon the
[24:42] elements of the earth impacts everything
[24:45] within
[24:46] it and is is I would even say if that if
[24:49] the skeptic says oh yeah but what about
[24:50] those things that live in caves and and
[24:52] never see the sunlight whatever's there
[24:55] that they're feeding on originated from
[24:58] the the nutrients and the life and the
[25:00] water and everything else that makes its
[25:01] way there is under the influence of that
[25:04] so sunlight that's you in light it's
[25:07] under the influence of that it's under
[25:09] its shadow so to say so to speak and so
[25:12] in the same way that we see the
[25:14] influence of the heavens and the of the
[25:16] firmament in the heavens and the light
[25:18] Isaiah prophesies that the knowledge of
[25:21] the Lord will fill up the Earth as the
[25:23] waters cover the
[25:24] sea it's going to have preeminence it's
[25:27] going to have influence it's going to
[25:29] have
[25:30] control it speaks if you if if you're
[25:33] just maybe a little bit there missing
[25:34] for you as where the direction I I
[25:37] wanted to come I'm not wanting to get
[25:38] into a lot of these details I just feel
[25:40] like I wouldn't have the
[25:41] time that how is that going to be set in
[25:44] that
[25:45] time where there's going to be a rain A
[25:48] Reign of righteousness and a reign of
[25:50] light and a reign of peace and Universal
[25:52] peace and it's going to be because the
[25:55] knowledge of the Lord Reigns Supreme and
[25:57] there's a yielding of everything to that
[26:00] knowledge to that Justice to that
[26:03] discernment not that everyone has to
[26:05] have their head filled with
[26:07] his with with with a knowing him and
[26:09] knowing everything about him but it's to
[26:11] be full of his knowledge which
[26:14] is his
[26:17] discernment now I want to read a lengthy
[26:19] statement to you and just as a little
[26:21] bit way of a pivot
[26:24] here just sensitive to time especially
[26:27] on Wednesday
[26:30] night
[26:32] and and just see how this the concept of
[26:36] knowledge I'm wanting knowledge not to
[26:38] be far from you but this is going to
[26:39] fill uh fit in a lot too with the
[26:42] fullness and we're speaking on of Glory
[26:45] now I says what was Jesus manifested for
[26:48] to show
[26:49] God he was God he had to
[26:52] be he said no man could die no Prophet
[26:55] could die he was God he was the god of
[26:57] the prophets he was the prophets he was
[26:59] the Kings he was the history he was he
[27:02] that was to come he that was he that is
[27:05] and he that's to be in this
[27:08] day the same yesterday today and
[27:11] forever he was manifested for that
[27:14] purpose now it just brings Christ right
[27:16] into our view in him dwell the fullness
[27:18] of the godhead
[27:22] bodily now he's going to show us come
[27:24] back to the purpose and through that
[27:26] purpose he achieved a church
[27:28] that he the fullness of God might bring
[27:31] to pass every promised word of God in
[27:33] these last days when he gets the pr
[27:36] pinenes preeminence in the church the
[27:39] position his place in the church this is
[27:43] Christ who is the fullness of the
[27:45] godhead bodily being placed in the
[27:47] church that means the fullness has to be
[27:50] there Christ to is the fullness having
[27:52] preeminence brings the
[27:54] fullness he says Jesus said he that
[27:56] believeth on me The Works that I do
[27:58] shall he do also even more than this
[28:01] shall he do for I go to my father see
[28:03] that was his purpose there was the
[28:06] manifestation and now
[28:09] today he wants to get somebody that can
[28:12] see it that they can let the
[28:16] word think of how he's phrasing that
[28:18] they can let the word Jesus so seen it
[28:22] so was so perfectly born for the day
[28:25] until God expressed every move that he
[28:28] made he was God's revelation God
[28:31] revealed now he he he's not going back
[28:36] just to describe Jesus he's trying to
[28:37] amplify that somebody that he can get to
[28:39] see it somebody that he can get to see
[28:42] it and let the word manifest so they can
[28:45] let the word he says Christ was so
[28:48] perfectly born for the day until God
[28:49] expressed every move that he made he was
[28:52] God's revelation God revealed now he
[28:54] Sanctified with his spirit and blood a
[28:57] church
[28:58] that he might make every promise in this
[29:00] last day be
[29:02] revealed think of this he wants to get
[29:04] somebody that can see it so that we who
[29:07] are born perfectly for this day God can
[29:10] express himself by every move and we can
[29:14] be God's revelation we can be God
[29:18] revealed make every promise in the last
[29:20] day be revealed now he could go back and
[29:23] pick up what these other fellas had left
[29:24] off here in the last days and by his
[29:27] holy spirit reveal all the mystery of
[29:30] the Seven
[29:32] Seals that brings us to quite a
[29:35] climactic moment in scripture and what
[29:38] it would mean for these seals to be open
[29:40] and these to be revealed his holy
[29:41] spirit's revealing the mystery of the
[29:43] Seven Seals through the Revelation comes
[29:45] knowledge comes un some understanding he
[29:47] is expressing
[29:49] himself that is his purpose that's why
[29:51] he died that's the second fold of his
[29:54] three-fold manifestation first to
[29:56] express himself s in Christ then Express
[29:59] himself to the church and the same thing
[30:02] Christ was the word and the church
[30:04] becomes the word when it lets the word
[30:07] go through them right I I I kind of
[30:10] understand looking at it now I'm not
[30:12] feeling sorry for you but maybe it's
[30:13] going to take a little bit of work
[30:14] tonight maybe it's not fair on a
[30:15] Wednesday night this late to make you do
[30:17] the work but just as the waters cover
[30:20] the sea and as it fills up it's flowing
[30:24] downhill Gravity Force in it and it's
[30:27] going to fill up wherever it yields
[30:28] wherever it relents the path of least
[30:30] resistance at the opening of the seals
[30:32] there's been a pouring out and a
[30:34] revealing of Christ coming down from
[30:36] heaven this great his revelation of his
[30:38] person as it comes down and it's wanting
[30:40] to fill every fiber of this church and
[30:43] to fill it up fully and completely but
[30:46] but it's not just sitting there coming
[30:48] and and and moving upon one without uh
[30:50] without some yielding on your part cuz
[30:52] it says when it lets the word go through
[30:55] them they say Lord fill up these depths
[30:58] why don't you take I have preeminence in
[31:00] my heart and in my life the church
[31:02] becomes the word when it lets the word
[31:04] go through them Hallelujah beautiful but
[31:08] when they accept a hybrid
[31:10] denomination how can they how can the
[31:12] word go through it that would make a
[31:14] good name for a hybrid card call it
[31:18] denomination he says it's grounded then
[31:20] it causes a short and blows ause but
[31:22] when the current is Flowing
[31:24] freely the word of God it expresses
[31:27] itself there's that free the Earth is
[31:30] going to be full of the knowledge of the
[31:31] Lord what I'm wanting you to see
[31:32] yourself is see yourself in that picture
[31:34] see yourself in that picture I we we
[31:37] hopefully inspired you to manifest your
[31:39] measure of Glory now there's some
[31:41] connection then that there's some
[31:43] knowledge of the Divine there's some
[31:45] revelation of Christ that we have to
[31:48] give ourselves to that we have to let uh
[31:51] let flow through us let it go through us
[31:53] let that current flow freely in order
[31:55] for the word of God to EXP Express
[31:58] itself says the works that I do shall
[32:00] you do
[32:01] also he says here that ye shall ye be
[32:04] also yes and in the last days it shall
[32:07] come to pass brings this right into
[32:09] Malachi 4 because there's so much of a
[32:13] there it's such a critical fundamental
[32:15] part of what we believe that God sent a
[32:17] prophet and listen the message has been
[32:20] given we're we're GNA never mature out
[32:22] of the
[32:24] message and that's one of the things
[32:25] that's really striking
[32:27] uh when when when people come uh to try
[32:30] to tell you that you're wrong one of the
[32:32] most important things when you tell
[32:34] somebody that they're wrong is to show
[32:36] them how they can be right but most of
[32:38] the people that'll come to you and tell
[32:40] you that you're wrong for believing the
[32:41] message just want you to feel wrong like
[32:44] they feel wrong because they can't show
[32:46] you anything
[32:47] right there there's no truth that
[32:50] they've come to because this message
[32:53] fulfills Malachi 4 The Turning of the
[32:55] hearts of the children back to the faith
[32:57] of the fathers behold I send you Elijah
[32:59] the prophet and he shall turn the hearts
[33:01] of the children back to the faith of the
[33:03] fathers and he says in there now I want
[33:06] this to have I want it to hit I want to
[33:09] have some punch I want you to feel a
[33:11] little bit it's not so much just
[33:13] believing that God sent a prophet and
[33:14] Vindicated the message but it had a
[33:16] purpose cuz he says and there in that
[33:20] turning back of our hearts in that
[33:22] enlarging in our hearts in giving us
[33:24] this revelation of his person and in
[33:26] there be a Time come forth when he could
[33:29] express himself in the fullness of his
[33:31] godhead deity through his church have
[33:34] the preeminence is in his church through
[33:36] that he's going to have preeminence in
[33:37] you through this message he's going to
[33:39] have preeminence in you oh if you stop
[33:42] listening to the word if you haven't
[33:44] yielded yourself to the voice of this
[33:45] hour he can never have the preeminence
[33:48] in you that's how movements and man kind
[33:51] and Humanity get in the way and Lead You
[33:55] astray but it's in there there comes a
[33:57] time when he can express himself in the
[33:59] fullness of the godhead deity through
[34:01] his church and have preeminence in in
[34:04] this church he says oh
[34:09] my I don't know if you're reading ahead
[34:11] of me here but the anointed
[34:14] man now the anointed people he says
[34:18] again oh my I could have titled this oh
[34:21] my oh my to bring back the anointed
[34:23] bride and the bridegroom now pause there
[34:26] just think of that in there there'd be a
[34:29] time to come forth time come forth a
[34:31] timing a dispensation of the fullness to
[34:34] express
[34:35] himself and it was the anointed man now
[34:37] the anointed
[34:39] people the anointed man was the
[34:42] revelation of God the anointed man was
[34:46] manifested for a purpose now it's the
[34:48] anointed
[34:52] people and with the anointed people it
[34:54] brings the bride abely with the anointed
[34:58] bridegroom and he says
[35:01] anointed by accepting what Eve turned
[35:05] down and
[35:07] Adam anointed by accepting
[35:10] something he said he's expressing
[35:13] himself and the Christ was the word and
[35:16] the church becomes the word when it lets
[35:18] the word go through them when the
[35:20] current is Flowing freely the word of
[35:22] God expresses itself so how is it that
[35:24] we become the anointed people by
[35:27] accepting he says what Eve turned down
[35:29] he says and Adam they both turned it
[35:31] down coming back with the anointing of
[35:34] the word because he said my word is
[35:37] spirit that's a huge key there because
[35:39] it says not by power not by might but by
[35:41] my spirit sayith the Lord so it's not by
[35:44] human knowledge not by human power not
[35:47] by human ability but by his spirit and
[35:50] his word is spirit my word is spirit he
[35:53] says see Anointed with the word
[35:57] I catch this what Eve turned down he
[36:02] comes back and we
[36:05] accept it's not a
[36:08] something it's not an
[36:10] it his his preferred pronouns he him
[36:15] it's a he it's a person it's Christ he
[36:19] comes back and we accept so we're
[36:22] anointed by accepting him you're
[36:25] anointed by accepting his re reation as
[36:28] as the word comes forth and you receive
[36:30] it you're anointed by the word you
[36:32] receive as the word is preached and you
[36:35] receive it you're anointed by the word
[36:37] that is received listen if Divine
[36:40] Deliverance is preached receive it if
[36:43] the word preach preaches peace then
[36:45] receive it because you'll be anointed by
[36:48] the word that you
[36:51] receive anointed by accepting
[36:55] him because he come comes back and we
[37:00] accept now to connect this back in
[37:03] Isaiah Isaiah chapter 11:
[37:06] 10 the whole Earth shall be full the
[37:08] knowledge of the Lord as the waters
[37:09] cover the sea and in that day there
[37:12] shall be a root of
[37:14] Jesse what a what humble description now
[37:18] doesn't mention David it mentions the
[37:19] root of
[37:20] Jesse which shall stand for an inside of
[37:23] the people who is this one it's
[37:28] Christ and it says he's an ins sign a
[37:31] super sign not just to the Jews now to
[37:35] it shall the Gentiles
[37:37] seek and his rest shall be glorious now
[37:40] what does it say it says to it shall the
[37:43] Gentiles
[37:45] seek doesn't mean to it shall the
[37:47] Gentiles just kind oh that's
[37:50] cool you or it's just going to kind of
[37:54] happen oh whoa oh
[37:57] ah cool yeah yeah that that's pretty
[38:01] cool they said they're going to seek
[38:04] it going to be something stand
[38:07] out something to get their
[38:09] attention some revelation of Christ he
[38:12] says the Holy Spirit Will Reveal all the
[38:14] mystery of the Seven Seals expressing
[38:16] himself that's his purpose and what is
[38:18] it the living bread of life bringing
[38:20] forth a gentile bride and to it shall
[38:23] the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be
[38:27] glorious I want to maybe end tonight I
[38:30] still got a few more minutes left I
[38:32] think I'll be able to go a little bit
[38:33] further but I want you to In This Way
[38:36] think of it this way that there's got to
[38:38] be some
[38:40] seeking there there's got to be a
[38:42] hungering and the thirsting after this
[38:44] right and it's not this isn't
[38:48] a I I I I think I think just maybe the
[38:52] things that I have here before me making
[38:53] maybe maybe it's making just more sense
[38:55] to me as I come to it
[38:57] there's there's a lot of ideas that we
[39:00] have in terms of power and manifestation
[39:02] and what it's going to feel like and
[39:03] what it's going to look like and there's
[39:05] a lot of things said about Revelation
[39:06] knowledge re uh understanding teaching a
[39:10] a and the like to where you kind of
[39:12] think wow learning is bad and
[39:14] understanding is bad and knowledge is
[39:15] bad and wisdom is bad and all these
[39:17] things are bad it's like yeah if they're
[39:19] all human they're bad in the same way
[39:22] that tongues and dancing and shouting
[39:25] and blood pouring out of your hands and
[39:27] sweating and falling out P if it's just
[39:29] all human it's not any good right and so
[39:33] there's there's such a balance in the
[39:34] word of God that we have to come to an
[39:36] understanding that what we want is we
[39:37] want the truth that's what we want we
[39:40] want the truth we want the truth of it
[39:42] it says in Proverbs 2: 1-6 my son if
[39:45] thou will receive my
[39:47] words what did Brother bam say as we
[39:50] read this he wants somebody that can see
[39:51] it that they can let the
[39:54] [Applause]
[39:55] word and and someone who can uh become
[39:59] the word when it lets the word go
[40:01] through them when the current is Flowing
[40:03] freely and so now it's expressing it in
[40:06] this
[40:07] way that if th will receive my
[40:10] words and hide my Commandments with
[40:13] thee so that thou incline thy ear unto
[40:17] wisdom and apply thine heart to
[40:20] understanding I don't think it'd be
[40:22] wrong for us to pray for these
[40:25] things
[40:26] you were to call upon the Lord for
[40:28] Revelation more than anything that
[40:30] that's knowledge of the Divine that's
[40:33] understanding God and His program that's
[40:35] that's that's the correct view of things
[40:37] I want to Incline my ear into wisdom
[40:39] apply my heart to understanding y if
[40:42] Thou criest after knowledge and liftest
[40:45] up thy voice for understanding if you
[40:47] cry for it if you cry after knowledge if
[40:51] your supplications and your prayers
[40:53] you're lifting up your voice for
[40:55] understanding if thou th seekest her as
[40:58] silver maybe that doesn't resonate so
[41:01] much with us the these days because we
[41:03] don't think in terms of silver or Hidden
[41:06] Treasures but if you seek after wealth
[41:09] popularity Fame whatever it might be
[41:12] that some some sort of resource if you
[41:14] seek her as silver in searches for her
[41:16] as for hid
[41:18] Treasures the things that we mind for
[41:20] the things that we search for the hours
[41:22] we'll spend researching something and
[41:24] Googling something and trying to get the
[41:26] the bottom of something if you'll seek
[41:27] after her like you do a paycheck if you
[41:30] seek after her like you would for hid
[41:31] Treasures if you seek after her like you
[41:33] do for some
[41:34] answers as it says the Gentiles will
[41:37] seek after
[41:39] him he comes back and we accept him
[41:42] we'll seek after
[41:44] him then Thou
[41:46] shalt understand the fear of the Lord
[41:50] and find the knowledge of
[41:52] God maybe we'll break into it a little
[41:54] bit in the next service where this
[41:56] knowledge begins that's right here in
[41:58] these scriptures Thou shalt understand
[41:59] the fear of the Lord and find the
[42:02] knowledge of
[42:03] God for the lord giveth wisdom out of
[42:07] his mouth cometh knowledge and
[42:09] understanding if he's speaking there's
[42:11] knowledge there's speaking there's
[42:13] understanding think of that no matter
[42:15] what it is in the whole spectrum of
[42:17] things if we try to pit the
[42:18] fundamentalist against the uh uh the
[42:20] Pentecostals or however that uh that
[42:23] that dichotomy is sometimes if it's in
[42:26] the word of God it's knowledge and
[42:29] understanding whether it be the gifts
[42:31] and Divine Healing and the manifestation
[42:32] of the spirit or it comes to knowledge
[42:35] and Revelation and wisdom and
[42:36] understanding or teaching on certain
[42:37] things and whether it be Church order
[42:39] and other things it's all that the
[42:40] Lord's speaking from his mouth cometh
[42:43] knowledge and
[42:46] understanding these are things that we
[42:48] ought to seek
[42:50] after because by accepting him we become
[42:55] anointed
[42:56] the sermon here you him brother B's
[42:58] talking about the misuse of gifts he
[43:02] says we saw misuse these things just
[43:03] letting it go
[43:10] freelance that could break out into a
[43:12] series on
[43:15] freelancing we got too many people
[43:18] trying to
[43:19] Freestyle with the
[43:23] message we misuse these things just let
[43:26] to go
[43:28] freelance that's just as good as the
[43:30] devil would want to that's
[43:33] right if them gifts had been set in
[43:36] order and put in its place it takes
[43:37] teaching we know to do that those gifts
[43:39] have been set in order and put in place
[43:41] there' have been a Revival sweep this
[43:42] land today that's never been
[43:46] exceeded now this comes back to the
[43:48] statement we read a couple Services ever
[43:50] present water from the rock similar
[43:52] statement we don't lack power we lack
[43:55] knowledge that's an interesting way of
[43:57] putting it we don't lack power we lack
[43:59] knowledge we lack Faith because Faith
[44:01] cometh by hearing hearing by the word of
[44:04] the Lord and the word of the Lord brings
[44:06] knowledge and understanding with the
[44:08] word of the Lord comes knowledge comes
[44:10] understanding he says we don't lack
[44:12] power we lack knowledge we lack Faith
[44:15] you've got power any man that's born
[44:17] again has the whole Heavens open to him
[44:20] think of that if you're born again all
[44:22] of Heaven's available to you if you're
[44:25] born again if you have the Holy Ghost
[44:27] down on the inside of you all of Heaven
[44:30] is available to you but the reason why
[44:32] you can't tap into the potential of it
[44:35] isn't because you don't have the power
[44:36] to it it's because you don't have the
[44:38] knowledge to access it you don't have
[44:41] the faith to access it just like if you
[44:43] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:45] you've got enough power to go create a
[44:46] world and live on it but it operates by
[44:48] the law of
[44:51] faith brother man says how can you have
[44:53] faith if you don't
[44:54] know
[44:56] and so Paul prays this for the believer
[44:58] in Colossians chap 1: 9 and
[45:03] 10 I'm not going to be satisfied there
[45:06] just going to be something left I just
[45:07] want to read the scripture because then
[45:08] I have a very long quote I want to read
[45:09] to end on he says for this cause we also
[45:13] since the day we heard it do not cease
[45:15] to pray for you and to desire that you
[45:18] might be filled with the knowledge of
[45:20] his will in all wisdom and spiritual
[45:24] understanding this was Paul's prayer
[45:27] this is at the core of Christ is the
[45:29] mystery God revealed was brother Brown
[45:30] brings it bringing it out of Colossians
[45:31] the teachings in Colossians that you
[45:33] might be filled with the knowledge of
[45:35] his will in all wisdom and spiritual
[45:37] understanding did Brother Brown preach
[45:39] the same gospel Paul preached I believe
[45:41] he prayed the same prayer for the elect
[45:43] that we'd be filled to the knowledge of
[45:44] his will and all wisdom and spiritual
[45:46] understanding that you might walk worthy
[45:48] of the Lord un all pleasing being
[45:50] fruitful in every good work and
[45:52] increasing in the knowledge of God God
[45:56] Amen to be filled with the knowledge of
[45:59] his will and all wisdom and spiritual
[46:00] understanding is how we walk worthy of
[46:02] the Lord into all pleasing this is how
[46:04] we're fruitful in every good work and as
[46:06] we do so he said increasing in the
[46:08] knowledge of God this is no just this is
[46:11] not just a onetime thing this is yeah I
[46:13] read the seals book when it came out
[46:15] haven't picked it up since this is yeah
[46:17] I listened to the church age book once
[46:18] an audio book it was good I one of my
[46:20] sons was telling me about a brother who
[46:21] said he was listening to some the
[46:23] Supernatural series and it was being
[46:24] narrated by somebody had a soothing
[46:26] voice so that's what he listened to to
[46:27] go to sleep and I'm always very careful
[46:29] to not let the messages become
[46:31] background music but there's there's
[46:33] something that you're not just saying
[46:35] wow what one time I learned it yeah I
[46:37] heard it one time but you're increasing
[46:39] in the knowledge of
[46:41] God listen when we pick this Bible up
[46:43] and read it and we should be able to
[46:45] read John 3:16 and be like OHA oh yeah
[46:50] no matter how many times we read it just
[46:52] to know there's depth to this that that
[46:55] as I will give into it this this there's
[46:57] a gravity this is water this word is
[47:00] water this word is a
[47:02] flood this word is coming down out of
[47:04] heaven and it's going to take the path
[47:06] of least resistance and so I want I want
[47:09] gravity to have its way I just want it
[47:11] to pour out and if there's a part of me
[47:14] that's been stubborn and it hasn't quite
[47:16] accepted this Revelation there's more
[47:18] depth for it to just come and to come
[47:20] deeper and to come deeper and I believe
[47:22] it can do
[47:24] that to increase in the knowledge of
[47:28] God because he says to any man that's
[47:30] been born again the whole Heaven's open
[47:32] to
[47:33] him that's
[47:35] amazing brother talks about how that
[47:38] where there's so many people accept
[47:40] substitutes he says when the Pentecostal
[47:42] skies are full of the real genuine
[47:45] article so there's a Heavens are
[47:48] full the there's a even if we could say
[47:51] it's bound up
[47:53] floods from Heaven it wants to open open
[47:55] up the windows of Heaven pour out a
[47:58] blessing the heavens are full of this
[48:00] flood that just wants to flow down but
[48:04] yet so many times we just accept
[48:06] substitutes and he says in the message
[48:08] thirst he says why would we want to take
[48:09] a
[48:12] substitute when there's a genuine
[48:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost that satisfies
[48:15] every fiber and longing in the human
[48:20] soul now if I could as we read through
[48:24] this
[48:27] he's going to use an
[48:29] example and now there is a there is a
[48:32] satisfi satisfaction that comes when you
[48:35] receive the Holy
[48:36] Ghost amen I'll amen it there's a
[48:40] satisfaction that comes but there's also
[48:41] a longing that comes with it there's
[48:44] absolutely a satisfaction that comes
[48:46] with the Holy Ghost but there's also a
[48:48] longing and when you read this that
[48:50] there's a holy ghost that satisfies
[48:52] every fiber and longing in the human
[48:54] soul that just as much as it has
[48:57] satisfied that thirst in the soul for
[49:00] life then even you everything that you
[49:04] long for everything that you're craving
[49:06] you can find an answer in
[49:08] Christ so then stand right in the face
[49:11] of death like the great Apostle Paul
[49:12] said oh death where's your stain grave
[49:15] where is your Victory thanks be to God
[49:18] who gives us the victory through our
[49:19] Lord Jesus Christ that's the experience
[49:22] breth that satisfies that Holy hush that
[49:25] Holy thirst that's in you it satisfies
[49:28] it you don't have to do anything else
[49:31] about it yay he says yeah it cleanses
[49:34] the
[49:35] lips there is also just people who live
[49:39] upon the
[49:41] emotion some people say well we got a
[49:43] lot of that in our Pentecostal movement
[49:45] and they'll go in which is fine and
[49:47] they'll pat their hands and play the
[49:49] music music stopped shoo a bucket of
[49:52] water went over
[49:53] everything now we do that we got in the
[49:56] habit of doing that it just becomes one
[49:57] of our customs let me tell you something
[50:00] when you're worshiping God in the spirit
[50:02] and the truth when it becomes a custom
[50:04] for you to do it because you think you
[50:06] ought to do it because you think if you
[50:08] don't shout or jump up and down or dance
[50:10] with the music your neighbor is going to
[50:11] think you're backslid you're drinking
[50:13] from a stagnated
[50:15] string now notice just how much it
[50:17] changes when it comes to your mindset
[50:20] what you're thinking what influence
[50:22] you're under if you're doing it because
[50:23] you're afraid you're going to be go to
[50:24] hell you're afraid not going to have it
[50:26] if you don't then there's the wrong kind
[50:27] of influence and so he's actually being
[50:29] very precise here he's not throwing out
[50:31] shouting he's not throwing out dancing
[50:33] he's not throwing out music he sh that
[50:35] there's a certain way that can corrupt
[50:37] the mindset and people get in the custom
[50:39] of things and they've got a lot of
[50:41] emotion and it's gotten to this point to
[50:43] where it's only triggered by certain
[50:45] things and you have this idea well if I
[50:47] don't stand when everybody else stands
[50:48] if I don't clap when everybody else
[50:49] claps if I'm not shouting if I'm not
[50:51] moving around when everybody else does
[50:52] then I'm backslid he says you're in the
[50:55] wrong
[50:56] flood you're in a stag You're Something
[50:58] stagnant it's not flowing it's not
[51:00] moving it's
[51:04] polluted he says right till it fills
[51:07] every
[51:08] fiber till the Holy Spirit itself
[51:11] bubbling in you I don't care whether the
[51:13] music is playing whether they're playing
[51:14] near my God to thee or whatever it is
[51:17] the holy spirit is still ringing the
[51:18] glory bells in your heart that satisfies
[51:21] that's God's P satisfying portion
[51:24] anything less than that you're
[51:29] done that's God's satisfying
[51:32] portion says you might speak with tongue
[51:35] like men and angels you might give all
[51:36] your goods to feed the poor you might
[51:37] prophesy you might have
[51:39] knowledge understand all the Mysteries
[51:41] and all and all these things and you
[51:43] will still become nothing 1 Corinthians
[51:45] 13 until that satisfying something that
[51:48] can only quench that
[51:51] thirst that's a statement what Paul says
[51:55] paradoxical statement but there has to
[51:58] be that satisfying something in the soul
[52:00] and he brings it back to his text my
[52:02] soul thirsts for the Living God like the
[52:05] heart panting for the water book unless
[52:07] I can find it I'll
[52:10] perish if you cry after knowledge lift
[52:14] up thy voice for understanding incline
[52:15] thy ear into wisdom apply thy heart to
[52:18] understanding seek for it search for
[52:21] it he wants somebody that can see it
[52:24] that they can let the word
[52:26] word let the word go through
[52:29] them let the current flow
[52:32] freely when you get to hungering for God
[52:35] like that something is going to take
[52:40] place the holy spirit is to lead you to
[52:42] those great Fountains of God it's what
[52:45] it's for there for the Holy Spirit to
[52:47] lead you to those great fountains yes
[52:49] sir now there's a there's a good thing
[52:51] to Worship in the spirit that's true but
[52:54] sometimes you have Spirit without
[52:56] truth St John 4 we worship God spirit
[53:00] and Truth Jesus is the truth that's
[53:03] exactly right and he is the
[53:08] word I believe that we should have a
[53:10] hunger for the word amen crave for it
[53:13] listen to it amen I hear from different
[53:16] ones who do devotions with their
[53:18] families they take time to share things
[53:21] out of the word of God with their
[53:23] family from the message of the hour from
[53:25] the
[53:26] Bible that's one of the best things you
[53:28] could do as a family amen is gather
[53:31] around the word one the best things we
[53:33] can do for ourselves in time of trouble
[53:35] is to get closer to that the word of God
[53:37] Amen feed our souls with the word of God
[53:40] listen to it hear it and as we hopefully
[53:43] I just put some of these things before
[53:45] you for you to chew on and to think
[53:47] about before we go further in this the
[53:49] whole Earth shall be full of the
[53:51] knowledge of the Lord what God does to
[53:53] the Earth to redeem it he does to the
[53:55] individual and if through the process of
[53:57] redemption this process of redemption if
[53:59] we had in our minds that in that process
[54:01] there's a point at which the knowledge
[54:04] of the Lord is going to fill up the
[54:05] Earth that I believe that we could have
[54:07] a desire that we could be full of the
[54:11] knowledge of the Lord amen let's make it
[54:12] a prayer tonight as we stand
[54:14] together
