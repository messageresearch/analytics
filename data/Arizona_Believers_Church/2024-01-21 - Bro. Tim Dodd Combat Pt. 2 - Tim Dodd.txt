TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I don't know if there's anybody here tonight that wasn't here this morning but just to refresh our thoughts you know we we this morning went through the scriptures and and in particular the things that brother brandham said in the fifth seal pertaining to the four anointings Around The Throne the lion the ox the man and the eagle and how that they are sent with a specific purpose into the church and brother brandom specifically laid out that the church could only operate under the power that was sent into the church as Jesus said in Acts 1 and: 8 and you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you he was telling the disciples so Terry in Jerusalem and and you'll receive the Holy Ghost and you'll receive power and so when the Holy Ghost comes and gives a person a new birth they are birthed with an with a view from God that they will be Anointed with power dependent upon the age they are birthed in in the beginning age it was the lion anointing that was upon the church and they acted as certain way but when it changed from The Lion to Ox the actions of the believer changed though the Holy Ghost was the same the new birth is always the same it's the power of the Resurrection in the believer that has quickened them that though they go into the grave yet they shall rise again in the resurrection and that we believe and know with all our hearts otherwise how are they going to resurrect they can't get the Holy Ghost after they're gone on we've been in as brother brandom likened it to the Old Testament Feast we've been in the Feast of Pentecost through seven Church ages we're coming now right up to the last Feast which is the Feast of Tabernacles and then we can talk which is a change of dwelling place and then we could talk about the Feast of atonement which goes to the Jews which is a recognizing of their atonement to which they are called by the Feast of the trumpets and it's the trumpets that call the Jews to the Feast of atonement and the atonement is not a new atonement the atonement is a recognizing of the the atonement that was already given to them so in the tribulation time when the two witnesses come to the Jews the Jews will realize that the Messiah that they're looking for in the future already came 2,000 years ago and Moses and Elijah will reveal that to them but as I've often said this message is not their message this message is a bride's message they are not the bride they the 144,000 are the Brethren a type of Benjamin in the Old Testament and and so they are to be called under a new ministry of Moses and Elijah and a message that is particular to them though the atonement is the same we preach the same Christ that Luther preached we preach the same Christ that Wesley preached we preached the same Christ that the Pentecostal preach but it's a different message or it's a revealing of Christ for the age that we're living in as we said this morning Abraham saw the same Christ in the form of me ISC he saw him on the plains of mammory Eli Ezekiel saw him as a wheel in the middle of the wheel Daniel saw him as the Ancient of Days and we could go down through the the Old Testament and the different prophetic messages throughout the Old Testament it was the same individual but God changed his mask and so as he revealed himself in different seasons to different individuals we are thankful to live in the hour that we are living in under the anointing for this day the eagle anointing bringing us into the revelation of the day that we're living in Revelation of the day that we're living in what is revelation it's Faith what is the Revelation for this day it's a Rapture it's more it's and a Rapture is not just a catching away a catching away is part of the Rapture that's why brother brandham even said about the resurrection we're already in a resurrection we've been resurrected from dark denominationalism we've been resurrected from Creeds and dogmas we've been resurrected from Death spiritually speaking and we've been brought into the life of Jesus Christ we're waiting for our bodies to catch up with that and one day we'll be changed in the moment in the twinking of an eye so each power the lion the ox the man and the eagle that is sent into the church under each every Son of God comes to the new birth and is Anointed by the power that is upon the church for their age and I quoted this morning from Brother Bram that's the only way the church can operate is the power that is sent into the church you can only operate under that so now in the message what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ brother brandham says in 1963 he says when the reformers age went out the Beast with the face like a man now remember that's Luther Wesley Pentecost he says but this or sorry he says faith like a man he says organization ensued yeah after the man anointing he says but this is the face of the eagle the Beast that went to make the challenge of today amen and then he says who would D dare to say that wasn't the inspired word of God when he foretold it here and sent out yonder he says to Arizona praise the Lord we're in a good place to Arizona and brought it right back even with the science and everything else and proved it so what was he talking about he was talking about the cloud he was talking about the angels that met him out here in Arizona and said go back to Jeffersonville and the Seven Seals will be open brother brandham did not open the Seven Seals the lamb opened the Seven Seals there was only one worthy to open the book but if God didn't have a prophet that is to say eyes to see we would not even know the lamb had opened the seals so it took a prophet being upon the Earth so that the church could see that God had turned a corner amen so under the man anointing restoration happened uh Reformation happened justification sanctification gifts of the Spirit but now the final challenge is here the final challenge to walk in perfect faith of who you are very good am very good this is what is to come in the last days because when you walk in perfect faith brother Braham says that's rapturing condition he says that's bride materialen all right and those are the keys of what we want to speak on tonight now it's the perfect faith in what the word says you are all right the word hasn't changed the word is eternal we so we know now that Isaiah spoke about Jesus hundreds of years before he was born and he said and it says in 9 and6 it says unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace that's who Jesus was that's what the scriptures spoke about him but who are you you know like the the sons of SK that went to cast out demons and they they didn't know who they were they said we adure you by the Christ that Paul teaches right and the demons answered back and says well Jesus we know and Paul we know but who are you amen they had no power because they didn't know who they were they were identified with the Jesus of Paul you know we you it's not good enough to identify ify with a Jesus that was born in a manger it's not good enough to identify with a Jesus that hung on a cross it's not the Jesus of 2,000 years ago that was the manifestation of Christ in that day but we are in another day he's the same yesterday today and forever he's alive today as he was alive yesterday and he's making himself known today and as I quoted this morning it was the word made flesh by the bridegroom then and it's the word made flesh in Bride form now amen so we've come to a time that God is calling his church to perfect faith in a perfect word which is rapturing Faith we've been called back to the fullness of the word the revealing of all the mystery of God we quote the quote in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound all the mystery of God would be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets amen we believe that is it finished yes how did get quiet in here is the mystery finished amen the mystery is finished the the seals have been revealed the cover has been taken off the the word of God has been revealed but the question is not has it been revealed generally that the opening of the seals ushered in the end time it was the opening of the seals that signified that we are in the end time as Jesus said at that day you shall know that I am in the Father the father and me I in you and you and me and so there's a declaration of knowledge of of Revelation that shall be released what is that Revelation the revelation of your position in Christ the revelation of who you are in God's thoughts so then it has to be the revealing of God's thoughts and the and the opening of that Revelation that will bring you to a level of uh I'll just say it this way a level of fearlessness that you know who you are in God for if you know who you are when the bride knows who she is then the Rapture will take place the devil doesn't stand a chance against this bride that comes to the revelation of who she is there's no other evidences spoken of this age right you know there there's no other thing spoken of well you need this or you need that no it's God's word revealed you believe what God has spoken to you brother bom says in Easter seal Jesus was so full of the quickening power he says if you can destroy this Temple that took 40 years you thought to build I'll raise it up in three days he he says why could Jesus say that why could Jesus say such a thing because he knew every word that God wrote of him he'd fulfill it and so is it in every word that God spoke of you you must fulfill it you will fulfill it it's not you it's him and it's just your faith in what he spoke of you so brother random goes on in the same quote and says do you know you're the one the Bible speaks of do you know your position is in Christ if you're in Christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like everyday living to you why sure it's yours you are an eagle yes that's your food all right let me just refer to some things that brother brandham says in the message perfect Faith now in the message perfect Faith as you have read that or listen to that message I'm sure uh if you've been a Believer for any length of time if you haven't uh you know I would encourage you to go back and study it you know there's many um things that brother Branham speaks about the eagle anointing and and in this message perfect faith brother brandham what he is doing it's a very striking message because he he's preaching something that the people need to catch and one of the things that he says in there and I have it here he says I I'll see just how advanced my church is in what we believe so he's testing the faith of the church he's testing the revelation of the people and the same message it's interesting of course because it's the same message he says if you had perfect Faith you wouldn't need a prayer line and then he has a prayer line all right what is he doing he's testing the faith of the people all right he's seeing if the people have come up to where this message is to take us to and as I said this morning that's why in The Seven Seals he couldn't show what the eagle anointing has done because the eagle anointing just came in the opening of the seals he could talk about the lion anointing the man anointing the ox anointing in a historical context but there was no historical context for the eagle anointing because it was all from then forward and everything that he was going to preach from then on was going to be the eagle anointing the Bible had become a new book to him he was seeing it from a different perspective as I said the eagle rises above and sees the same thing that the Li and the ox and the man see but sees it from on high not looking at it from an Earthly perspective all right so let's just look at a few of the things that brother brandham says I had this in slides but I thought we'll just skip the slides tonight and and just uh I'll just quotee them for you this is from the message perfect Faith he says now remember he's talking about the disciples they had the power Jesus had given them power to heal the sick to raise the dead to cast out Devils just a few days before that they had the power but not the faith to use the power remember I said this morning if you've got the Holy Ghost in you brother Brown says you've got enough power in you to speak worlds into existence and go and live on them all right that's how much power is in every holy ghost Born Again believer but he says it's governed by a law and the law is Faith and Jesus now given the disciples power to cast out Devils heal the sick raise the Dead all of that he gave them the power they had the power but they didn't have faith to use the power what was it Jesus had had uh uh they had come to this man whose boy was an epileptic and they they uh uh they tried to cast out the devil and the father could they couldn't do it and the father Jesus came by their way and the father cried out to Jesus Lord help my son if you can and Jesus says I can if you believe and and it's interesting because now remember the angel of the Lord told Brother Bram said if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand at your prayer not even cancer he didn't say if you can get the people to rep repent he didn't say if you can get the people baptized yeah he didn't say if you can get the people to shout or if you can get the people to speak in tongues or or whatever more manifestation you want he says if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand at your prayers not even cancer so now Jesus says to this man he says I can if you believe and the man's response is Lord I believe help thou my unbelief is how the King James interprets it but really the meaning in the Greek is Lord I believe help thou my lack of faith so I believe with all the faith that I have but my problem is I don't have faith because what is faith faith is a revelation how does faith come faith comes by hearing the word amen if you're not feeding on the word you're not going to get Faith because faith is a revelation that only comes to you by you receiving the word of God all right now so he said they they they had the power but they didn't not have the faith to use the power and then he says now there's the Bram Tabernacle there's the church the bride today so what is the church the bride today she has the power but she doesn't have the faith to use the power every sickness in this room is defeated every problem has a promise to overcome it every lost loved one is yours if you can believe you've got the power but the problem isn't the power the power is in the church if if if there's one Holy Ghost filled believer and I believe there's many more than that in this room if but if if there's just one even if it's just the pastor there's a power to create another Universe the same power that created this universe is in everybody that has the Holy Ghost it's the same God it's the infinite God who's infinite in all power and the only thing that holds it back is a lack of Revelation and that's why in the last days there will come a perfect Revelation an opening of the book A revealing of the word of God to loose the power in the church it's not actions it's not some f physical manifestation there will be all kinds of physical manifestation but it's not those things that loses the power it's only and I want to reiterate this tonight it's only Revelation that loses the power in The Believer there's no other way for the power to be loosed he says that's the church that's the bride today he says the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got that Faith to move it see what I mean it takes Faith to move it so you see these aren't my thoughts these are God's prophets thoughts all right a little bit later in the me same message perfect Faith he said Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was it is written of me didn't David and the Psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him I am the bread of life life that came down from God out of Heaven I am the Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am that I am and he knew with that a perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah and the spirit of God was upon him and he said now I myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him and the word made God was in him the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest for you are a Believer and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you that's what you are a Believer is not just well I'm Tim do and I believe this message is true as I said to the church at home you know there's really two kinds of Believers in the message that we know there's three kinds of Believers generally but there's two kinds of Believers in the message I said that that one of them believes the message is true and one of them believes the message I'll let that one sink in a little bit which one are you do you just believe that it's true or is it made real to you do you believe that this is God's anointed word for this age to loose the power of the Holy Ghost that has been in the church through seven Church ages in every individual that was born again right down to this last days I reject that somebody says the new birth was different in another age than it is today it's no different it's the same Holy Ghost you can't make God different either they had the Holy Spirit which is God which is divine love or they had nothing right true and if they had nothing they won't be in the resurrection right but the Holy Ghost is the same in every age and the difference is the Revelation to the age or the anointing inin in that is set upon the word for that age amen so now remember it's the Revelation not the emotion it's the Revelation not the memory it's the Revelation not the imagination it's the it's the Revelation not the reasoning all right it's the Revelation and God is a sovereign Giver of Revelation he didn't reveal to any other age what the Rapture really was that was held for this age because this is the age that needs it I asked somebody asked me one time I have 10 children I'll let you just get back to your seats now and uh I I tell the brothers I did my part and you know I I keep the tax base of the country you know with a we don't if it was up to me we wouldn't need no immigration all right and uh that's just the way it goes but nevertheless I I I had a sister come up to me one time and say brother Tim I can't imagine I I I have no idea what it would take to raise 10 children and I said to her says how many children do you have she says I have I think it was three children you have three children well let me tell you sister because you only have three children God will never reveal to you how to raise 10 children it's not for you but it's for me that's my revelation so everybody God reveals himself to you sovereignly and if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ for the last days part of your Revelation is a Rapture Revelation it's a revealing of who you are all right and so all we find this all down through yourself let me read a little bit more out the perfect faith is this all right all right brother Brown says Jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in the world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are we'd be a Mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you you see when you've when you're born again by the spirit of God and you walk by Perfect faith in the word of God you're not walking according to this world's rules the world the medical science of the world will tell you you're going to die but the word of God Says by his stripes I'm Healed it's just simple if that's made real to you it doesn't matter what the doctor says you you can find yourself in a financial we would call it maybe a financial pickle I don't know if you'd say that down here but you know in a situation where everything's all messed up and I don't know how it's going to work out but when you look to the God who owns all things the cattle on a thousand hills your provider he's Jehovah Gyra then you can look to him and say it doesn't matter what my finances look like God is a provider I'm going to make it through this amen he's my deliverer he's my healer he's my peace he's my joy he's my comfort can you say Amen to all those things it's not according to the science of this world that's why we don't need Psychology praise the Lord what we need is a walk with the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord that we have that so Jesus lived in a perfect faith in what the word said he was and he says the brother Ram says if you did that the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you'd not do that's the way it is to all believers they're Mystics the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves amen you see you cannot we cannot understand each other carnally you know we might have some things in common say one brother loves fishing another brother loves fishing but another brother might love hunting and another brother like might like cars you know and and you know uh working on cars and another brother might like carpentry and another brother might like farming and and all of those things and and you know and all of the brothers cannot understand the sisters Naturally Speaking you know we don't understand what makes them tick but we sure glad they're around right and so there's there's that this relationship we have and God made us that way cuz God took the the feminine out of the masculine right and he put the feminine in the woman and the masculine in the man and it don't change right you can't decide you're one or the other God makes you what you are all right and so as the result of that we realize that there's some things that a woman can do and understand that a man cannot and vice versa but when we become spiritually in Christ then we realize I have a position in Christ and if I understand who I am and she understands who she is then we can certainly find a place together to become one I'm talking about husband and wife in Jesus Christ amen so that that's a reality that can only happen that's why true marriage can only be understood in Jesus Christ the world tries marriage and God bless him that's the law of the land and uh uh that's uh something that's hard to preach on because of really marriage is for the elect of God the relation the true relationship between a husband and wife is for the elect of God the rest of them out there it really wasn't for them it was for Adam and Eve in the beginning the Son and the daughter of God and it's for you and you're the only ones that can really understand what marriage is about praise the Lord I this is not at all in my notes and and if you want me to leave brother Aaron you just say so all right all right amen so now he says going on in perfect Faith oh let me just finish that thought because that's how I went down that road now I realize what got me there we cannot understand each other naturally it has to be spiritually now you cannot understand brother brandom by theology right you cannot even understand why he said things in a lot of ways that that because it's divinely or orchestrated by God and it works now you want me to explain it and put it in a textbook I can't do it nobody can do it but when it's quickened to you that this is Christ revealed in our day then it becomes a living reality to give faith in you which is faith in this word alone amen all right so brother Ram says so when a man lives by faith walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material see you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor the deacons trustees that means for the leoty every individual walks in a world with God alone right and the church said amen amen that's all of us it's an individual relationship God is Not interested in the pastor holding your hand in your relationship with Jesus Christ the pastor has a very specific office to instruct the church to Shepherd over the church but it's not him that is United to you it is the word that is United to you all right he so he goes on he says you're baptized into the kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God he gives the orders you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of a doubt nowhere you walk right on in other words what he's saying is if you don't know this relationship God wants to have this relationship with you the Lord wants you to know him and him to know you in that intimate kind of relationship that's one-on-one with God Alone he wants to speak to you if you've never had God to speak to you there's more for you that's all I'm not here to say you're an unbeliever I'm here to say you haven't realized your full potentials yet if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails amen that faith never fails it can't miss the mark it is the very sovereignly given Revelation to you personally that looses the power of God God in your life it is that simple oh how do I get there brother Tim repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost which means God puts a part of himself inside of you in the book of Acts it's it's referred to as liix ofier that appeared over every one of them it was identifying that was a pie of the great Pillar of Fire that was coming to them individually and that's what the New Testament does in the Old Testament it was God in the great Pillar of Fire in the New Testament it's God in you amen God coming down into the individual by the baptism of the Holy Ghost to change your nature and put put it into the nature that you are meant to be which is a very attribute of God a a uh a very son or daughter of God in the very nature of it you don't have to teach children to be human it's in their DNA you do have to teach them what humans are supposed to act like amen we we understand those things but you ever think about why because we've come to a level of revelation as a human being that we don't tell lies we don't steal we don't beat up on our little brother or sister you got to talk to your children now brother Aon all right or we don't beat up on our big brother all right if we say that way you know these are things that we try and teach instill in our children well that's why the Bible says every son that comes to God must be chastised you are a son of God you're birthed into the kingdom of God now God's in the business of molding our character because our place is not to be slaves our place is to sit with him in the throne and he's birthed us into the kingdom to take us there know ye not that the Saints shall judge the world so you're in a process here and that God is molding your life through the revelation of the world word and the trials that he's taking you through to put you in a position of character so that he can release Revelation which will release the power of God within your life all right so we we read from the Sixth Seal the the eagle anointing versus Satan's power which is death his name is death and Hell follows after him so there's a purpose in what God is doing that purpose is a Rapture but more than a Rapture that purpose is maturity the Redemptive purpose of God has come to maturity the anointing upon this hour is to bring the church to maturity let me let me let me drill down a little bit the anointing of this hour is to bring you to maturity individually oneon-one with God to be exactly what he saw in his thoughts of you before the foundation of the world now when we come to understanding an eagle there's reason it's called an eagle so let's look at some of the characteristics of the eagle the eagle one of the things that identifies the eagle is its focus the eagle has long range vision and the eagle does not get distracted from its purpose all right the eagle is something that is not distracted from things around it it has a vision to see things as we said this morning it rises up on its wings uh it is called to rise on its wings but it does not rise on its wings by its own power the eagle knows how to set its wings on the air currents that are around it and use those air currents to rise higher I I did a study years ago on the golden eagle which which often flies up and down the Rocky Mountains in the in the western North of North America and it uses the sun shining on the exposed rock of the mountains that creates updrafts to to so it'll fly to one place and it'll rise up on that updraft to a very high height and then it'll fly on to the next mountain and then use those updrafts to fly higher and then it'll fly the eagle the golden eagle is actually a migratory bird and sorry to you Americans that love the bald eagle but the golden eagle is actually a type of the Bride more than the bald eagle cuz this bride won't cut C her hair so she ain't bald all right and gold represents deity you want me to throw them all out there you know this isn't my subject tonight but the but the eagle has certain characteristics all right and it's able to create separation brother Brandon talks about how that he was in a storm and and when the storm blew in and the Lord told him to rebuke the storm and and uh uh how that in the after that storm he was walking through the forest and and he came across a chattering squirrel chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter and he talked about all the different things that that represents but then he he thought that squirrel was chattering because of him and because he had kind of walked into that squirrel's territory but then he realized the squirrel wasn't even looking at him and so he looked at where is the squirrel looking and he saw it was looking at an eagle that had taken shelter in the storm and brother brandham had a gun and he he he he talked to the eagle he says you know I could shoot you he says the eagle didn't care he says I I could I could pull this gun faster and you the eagle he says didn't care uh about anything that brother Brandon was talking about he was getting annoyed by the chattering of the squirrel and he saw he was just testing his wings he was just getting ready to take off and he says before you could hardly bat an I says the the eagle just flopped his wings a couple times and then soar up into the Heavenly what was he doing he was creating distance between himself and the chatter there's a lot of chatter that's going on around us and we are anointed to create some separation between us and the world it's just part of the anointing that we're under in this hour and it's Revelation that creates that separation as The Sun Shines on the exposed rock and warms the ground to create an upcurrent for you you know get in the presence of the sun where the rock is being exposed where you can talk about Revelation and how that that's being revealed you get into the Revelation it's going to lift You Higher and lift You Higher and lift you higher until the things of the world don't bother you anymore you say brother Tim I have trouble with this part of the world or this Peri of my life this is where my weakness is you I hope we understand we're all weak human beings as I said this morning John Wesley said you're as likely to make mistakes as you are to breathe why because in these bodies we have to battle against the flesh all right the flesh Wars against the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit Wars against the flesh so there's a struggle that goes on the flesh wants to take you into things but the more Revelation the more of God you get in you the less room there is for the world just as I said say oh brother Tim I need Deliverance you can get deliverance from the world but if you don't get God in you the world will come flooding back in just get more of God it's a law of separation and I i' I've done this years ago I haven't done this for a while but I said it's like the world God hates the world he says the love of the world is enmity with God and so the the world is on one end of the spectrum and the and God is on the other and you cannot get closer to the world and closer to God at the same time if you get closer to God you're going to get further away from the world but if you get closer to the world you're going to get further away from God that's just the way it works it's simple I hope you you you like that simple example all right so brother Brown I'm talking about that squirrel then that storm he says he says uh the eagle has got perfect confidence in what God give him in those two wings to fly away from his enemy he didn't say fight his enemy he said just fly away he says then what ought a man to do that's born of the Holy Ghost when he feels the Holy Spirit around him and you know that you're in love with God what do you care what the devil says and how many threats he makes okay now we find in the Bible Eagles referred to in three ways number one God refers to himself as an eagle all all right Jehovah Eagle number two he Likens His prophets to Eagles okay and number three the last anointing the last power around the throne is an eagle anointing all right so it has a particular meaning to us and in order to see the eagle anointing let's look back on the anointings that were upon God's prophets and if we can see how God deals with His prophets we can s see a little more of how God wants to deal with us in the day we're living in under the anointing of this hour so we'll go to a prototypical prophet which is Elijah and Elijah was given a commission from God go and call Israel back to God and first of all he was to pronounce that there would be no rain because of the evil in Israel and for three and a half years there was a drought and there was no rain and then then Moses was or Moses Elijah was called To Go up to Mount Carmel and to bring the people back to God and and so uh he goes up on Mount Carmel he does exactly what God tells him to do now listen as he as he's up there on Mount Carmel as he's got the the word from the Lord and he knows exactly what he wants to do he says bring the prophets of Baal he says if Jehovah be God then serve him if Baal be God then serve him now that those words in the Hebrew means if Jehovah be Elohim then serve him him Elohim means the self-existing God but if ba be the self-existing god or Elohim then serve ba he says but Let The God Who Answers by fire let him be the one that is God all right so he so then he says to the prophets ba all right you do your religious ceremonies you you have do whatever you want to do and then at when you're all done he says if your God Answers by fire bail then we will serve him and if not when you're done then I'll take over and Jehovah will answer by fire so the prophets of Baal get up there and they're doing their enchantments they're dancing they're making a lot of noise they're shouting they're jumping they're cutting themselves they're doing all sorts of things and there's Elijah I don't have a chair up here you mind if I borrow a chair you got it all right here we go there's Elijah up on Mount Carmel I hate to say say it this way in church why don't you cry a little bit louder maybe your God is hard of hearing maybe he's sleeping maybe your God's busy you need to get listen they got excited they got emotional they danced they cut themselves they were doing everything they could do and Elijah says well you know work a little harder you know he didn't feel sorry for him why because he knew his God and he knew who he was as he sat there on Mount carel he called them more and more and more finally you know the the the prophets of Baal had totally exhausted themselves and Baal had not answered so then Elijah got the stones of Israel 12 Stones and rebuilt the altar of Israel one for each tribe one for Judah one for Benjamin one for isachar one for Dan he's going through the 12 he's rebuilding the altar of Israel what is he doing he's reestablishing the word of God in Israel he's turning them back turning their faith back as it were to the faith of the fathers and so he's he's he's bringing it now he says all right we're going to lay the sacrifice on here dig a trench around about here and he they dig the trench he says now pour water on the sacrifice until the trench is full of water now that doesn't seem like a very religious ceremony but he knew what he was doing and then now remember it had been a drought so the ground is dry you know how much water it's going to take until the ground is soaked with water and it actually stays in the trench you ever done that Arizona is kind of a dry place you know you can keep pouring water on the ground and it keeps disappearing you know well that's exactly like it was there on Mount Caramel and as they poured water and more water and more water I don't know where they got all the water but they brought more and more water and finally the the trench begins to fill up with water and they're going to praise the Lord this is hard work and you know they finally the trench fills up with water the altar is soaked the sacrifices laid on the Altar and now what does Elijah do he simply says this Lord let it be known that you are God and that I am your prophet yes and that I have done this at your command simple as that and the fire of God came down and consumed the sacrifice and consumed The Altar and consumed the water so mighty was the fire of God there wasn't even an altar left there was only a burnt spot on the ground and he took and he slew the emotional overwrought prophets of Baal and and and brought Israel back to God and he thought the whole nation would turn back to God but all that God had showed him is do what I show you right and I will fulfill my word it's not you fulfilling the word it's not your energy it's not your emotion you might have energy you might have emotion you know human beings are emotional right anybody know that of course men are more emotional than women right praise the Lord Brother Tim doesn't even know his human pschology but you know what God came down and fulfilled his word Mo uh Elijah didn't have to sing he didn't have to shout he didn't have to do nothing he just had to fulfill the word of God now I want to just say this for a reason because Elijah was anointed with an eagle anointing yes okay and he goes from there now and and they they slay all the prophets of Baal and Jezebel hears about it and Jezebel sends a messenger to Elijah says I'm going to kill you now God had never told him that part yeah right Elijah all of a sudden goes Lord you didn't tell me this and he started to sweat it pretty seriously was he still a prophet yes was he still the one that was sent in that hour to bring the message of God was he scared yes why was he scared because he didn't know what to do and so he ran from there brother R says had a nervous breakdown and he ran from there at the threat of a woman out into the Wilderness because of the threat of one woman and he didn't know what he was going to do and he ends up at a cave right long story short ends up at a cave here's a prophet Anointed with an eagle anointing ends up at a cave he's he's in the cave and the voice of God comes to him and says what are you doing here Elijah what doest thou here Elijah and and and God says go stand in the mouth of the cave so Elijah go stands at the entrance to the cave and A Mighty Wind goes by think about it A Mighty Wind goes by and Elijah goes praise the Lord It's A Mighty Wind no he doesn't Bible says God wasn't in the wind right a mighty fire goes through and God wasn't in the fire and Elijah was standing there saying that doesn't impress me cuz I'm not interested in outward demonstrations I'm interested in God yes and then an earthquake happens the ground shakes listen the ground shook in in the book of Acts the W Mighty Wind came down a sound of a rushing wind on the day of Pentecost nothing we're not complaining about those that I'm just saying that those things were real there but they were also real in Elijah day but Elijah just stood there because he wanted God and so now well this is glorious now he stands there and he says F and the Bible says finally a still Small Voice came to Elijah and then Elijah Mount wrapped himself in his mantle and came and stood outside the cave and he listened to the voice of God hallelujah that's what he came to hear was the voice of God I want God to speak to me I don't just want an emotional experence if I just wanted an emotional experience I'd go join the prophets of ba that's not the point I want to hear direct from God so he stands there listen now he stands there and brother Bram oh I love how he puts this and he as he's standing there God comes and speaks to him and Elijah says God says what are you doing he says listen I I I I've stood for you I only am left he says they've I've slain the prophets of Baal they threatened my life they killed all of your prophets there's nobody left in Israel that serves you I only am left in Israel what did God do brother Brown puts it this way God pulled back a seal for Elijah God opened the word for Elijah to see that there were 7,000 that had not bowed their knee to bail and that Elijah your ministry is not over I want you to go from here and I want you to go and juu and haziel and and Elisha in your stad and there's there's this is the way that's got to do now Elisha could Le Elijah could leave the cave with the commission the bride has thus saith the Lord or she stands still she's under an eagle anointing and Elijah under an eagle anointing he says I'm staying in this cave until God speaks to me I'm not interested in accomplishing something on the earth I'm interested in my relationship with God where he sends me I will go what he tells me to do I will do let him speak to me because when he speaks to me it always comes to pass exactly the way he says it amen that's an eagle anointing I'm going to take you now to the next Prophet Elisha this one's powerful if we can see this we can see a lot so Elisha we know is the next Prophet after Elijah they crossed Jordan together just Elisha comes back Elisha fulfills the commission of God and many different experiences that Elisha has there comes a time that because non the Syrian comes and gets healed and gesi misbehaves himself gesi gets leprosy and he's no longer the servant of Elisha so now there's another servant of Elisha and they're in the city of dotham all right and in this city now uh is where Elisha is is living and the king of Syria is trying to set an ambush for the king of Israel Ahab and so he he he sends um he sends armies into Israel to set set an ambush and Elisha sends a messenger that's why I said this morning if Israel today would have had a prophet they never would have had happened to them what happened to them or least if they would listen to the prophet and so Elisha sends a message to the king and the and and says don't don't go down this this certain Valley cuz the syrians are waiting for you and then it happens again and the syrians are waiting in another place for an ambush and they want to Ambush the king and Elisha sends a message be careful because the king of Syria is waiting for you over in this area over here and so all of this is happening and finally the king of Syria is getting so frustrated says somebody tell me who the Spy is amongst us and the and one of his his uh uh advisers I think it is says sorry King but it's not as a a spy amongst us Israel has a prophet and he knows your secrets in your bed Chambers and so you know you you know there's nothing we can do about it and and the King says well where does this Prophet live and he lives in dotham all right we're going to go and sleep slip down there in the middle of the night and surround the city now you don't think that if Elisha knew he was going to be here and Elisha knew he was going to be there that Elisha didn't know he is going to be surrounding the city okay so but the morning comes and his servant gets up all right he's gets out of bed in the morning and you know how it is in the morning and I got to put the coffee on and you know and just you know rubbing his eyes and he sets puts the W starts the fire puts the water on to boil and he's getting everything ready and he looks out the window uh Elisha Elisha Elisha he's scared to death he runs into the into where Elisha is says we're surrounded and Elisha's just relaxing he's waiting for breakfast to be made yeah he knows what's going on because he knows who he is yes you know when Jesus went up on the mountain and they took him on up on the mountain to throw him over the hill off the cliff and kill him the Bible says Jesus just turned and walked through their midst wasn't he didn't have to escape or fall he just knew the word did not say I'm going to die from being thrown off a mountain right the word said I was going to die on the cross so I'm Invincible until I fulfill my place in this world Amen and there was elishah and he said to his servant he said Don't Fear there's more with us than there is with them now what was going on at this point Elisha was trying to get his servant to see what he saw here's an eagle anointing now the the servant was not Anointed with that anointing but elishah was trying to get him to believe him amen you see that's why the message oh this is just brother Tim now but that's why the message had to change from man anointing to Eagle anointing because under the man anointing you'll never never see what the prophet sees but under an eagle anointing your eyes will come open to see what brother brandham saw Hallelujah God has alloted that in these last days you will be Anointed with the same anointing brother brandham was anointed as a prophet Hallelujah and so there now Elisha is standing there and and and the telling his servant there's more with us than there is with them and the servant says well okay Do You Believe Me Lord I believe help thou my lack of faith I'm I'm trying to believe with everything that that's within me but the problem is I just need more faith to loose whatever is in my life and so finally Elisha says Lord open his eyes is that what he said Lord open this boy's eyes and the boy's eyes come open and this boy that was shaken there and all upset and all fearful his eyes come open and he sees the mountains that are that are filled with f angels of fire and Chariots of Fire and swords of fire and a mighty Army of God that's there protecting God's Prophet Elijah and then you can just see the serent the servant look out the window you ain't so tough yeah you ain't so bad ah we're bigger my daddy's bigger than your daddy yeah all of a sudden this shaking quaking coward by having his eyes come open now can be a brave man now catch this now this is a vital important now if you can catch this tonight if there's the only thing you catch catch this nothing had changed nothing had changed the Angels didn't all of a sudden come from heaven and appear they were already there they were already on the scene in Elijah they were already on the seene to hold back the armies of Syria see everything that you have need of is already on the scene God just needs to open your eyes Hallelujah that's why go Jesus said to the disciples blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear for a the the sages and the prophets of old have desired to look upon the scenes that you're seeing and I'll say every Church age messenger every believer in every Church age has desired to see the things that's open to your eyes Hallelujah as desire to see the things that you're looking into as a servant of God under an anointed Eagle anointing in this hour to look into Heavens the way a prophet sees glory be to God that's why God sends an eagle anointing because the purpose of a prophet is to get to see th people to see things from God's perspective God lifts him up to see and he con the conveys the message to the people God raised brother brandom up to see things but now it's different because now he's conveying it to a people that are to be Anointed with the same anointing that he's anointed not a prophet to the age anointing don't get me wrong but an eagle anointing with eyes to see things from a different perspective you see God's purpose and his plan and his his reality has not changed he's always your healer yes he's always been your provider he's always been everything that you have need of but now is the hour that God has anointed us to see things the way he sees things glory be to God that's why brother brandham was commissioned if you can get the people to believe you that's right brother brandham could see it brother BR had no problem believing but if you can get the people to believe you but now God takes the prophet off the scene only two and a half years into the eagle anointing two and 3/4 years into the eagle anointing why because he replaces the prophet with an anointing amen he took the the prophet but send an eagle anointing upon the church that you by the revealed word of the hour can see things from God's perspective I say hallelujah I'm so glad I'm living in this day it's your perspective that the eagle anointing has come to change you always were son of God but you didn't know what that was you did you see the church down Through the Ages didn't know it wasn't revealed to them that they are entitled to everything that Adam lost but you know it's been revealed to you you've been anointed to receive that everything that Adam lost perfect Faith perfect love perfect everything you've been anointed to realize that the title deed has been put into your hands that the abstract of the Holy Ghost see here we go from another perspective now the is this okay all right the abstract oh my oh it's not that late all right give me five more minutes who give me five more minutes five more just a few of you five more minutes all right okay I think there's about 12 125s is 60 that's an hour okay okay all right when Jesus went into the tomb as far as the natural man could see a man what was what happened was there's a body laying in a tomb Jesus was in the Tomb but through the revealed word of God we know Jesus was not in the Tomb we know firstly he went to prison went to hell to preach to souls in prison amen and then he ascended Up From Hell H because the promise is I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption and so he send it up from Hell went into Paradise to empty out paradise and bring all the Believers out of paradise because they had to stay there until the atonement was made and then bringing the the Believers out of paradise there was a Resurrection on Easter morning and and many of the saints that were in the grave arose because they were coming out of paradise they were coming through the Earth and they were going off into glory amen so this is now what we understand and we see but if you were living in that day you'd be with the disciples oh we thought it was the he that would redeem Israel matter of fact a couple of them were walking on the road 20 minutes they told me I can't walk around because the video only still shows the front here but let me just walk across the front here and there's two of them walking to you there come walk with me Elliot yeah come walk with me you know oh we thought he was the man you know I can't believe we gave our lives to this gospel for the last three years and now they crucified him and he died and all of these things and oh we don't know what to do Woe Is Us he's in the Tomb he's dead now it's all over our lives are over nothing good is going to happen it's it's now the end of everything that we've ever dreamed or hoped life is a misery I don't know what's going to take place I guess we'll just go back to our old jobs of fishing or farming or whatever we were doing and oh my this is a miserable existence we had we never should have got involved with this and then one joins himself to their midst and says what manner of conversation is this that you're having oh don't you even know what's going on don't you know about Jesus of Nazareth they say to Jesus of Nazareth yeah don't you know about Jesus of Nazareth who was a mighty prophet in word and deed and they've taken him and they've crucified him and it's all over now and I'm stumbling over the stage and and all of these things it's just a it's just a miserable existence that we have now and Jesus says to them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken amen thank you and and he began to beginning at Moses and all the prophets he begin to expound to them the scriptures concerning who himself because he walked by Perfect faith in what the word said he was I am that man that came down didn't wasn't the Messiah supposed to suffer wasn't he supposed to die wasn't he supposed to isn't it say cursed it he that hangs on a tree because there's he's got to become a curse that the rest of the world could be Loos from the curse and all of these things and and as he began to explain with them their hearts begin to burn within they still couldn't see yet right but their hearts begin to burn within them oh this message sounds so good I haven't heard things like this since Jesus himself was here and as they're walking along and wondering oh if only if only yeah and so they get to him and they said and he he acts like he's going to just carry on and they said oh listen just stay with us a little while we'll buy you the you'll buy we'll buy you supper come and sit down and have some food with us and they sat down at the table and he begins to break bread like he always did and then what their eyes become open Hallelujah nothing changed nothing changed their eyes become open now they see him for who he really is now he becomes revealed in front of them the Mighty God unveiled in their midst and they recognize the day they're living in and then they he disappears out of their midst they run back to to Jerusalem and then they're there in no time and says we saw him hallelujah our eyes became open well how did you see him well never mind about that part we don't want to tell you that part but we sat in the restaurant together and we we broke bread and and he revealed himself to us hallelujah listen sometimes your heart's burning because God's trying to get something too he says Church why do you hunger why do you thirst it's God trying to get these m truths into you hallelujah it's already here amen that's why brother Bram said in the and I had this quote sitting here tomorrow I hope you don't mind if I look at it just for a moment here recognizing your day in its message he says he says everywhere now there's no Revival everybody's complaining ministers are crying I was reading in one of the outstanding papers that comes here to the church in Louisiana about a church in Louisiana brother and sister Moore of the herald of his coming one of the finest papers of the field that saying fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet how many reads it fast pray he says we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's going to be a great thing going to happen all you pray pray pray we're not too late brother Brown says that's what they're feeling he says why do they do that he says they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing they will be awakened they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride he says by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour now this is 1964 in other words they've left the man anointing the Revival's over the eagle anointing has come they feel the pull but they don't see what was happening under the man anointing and they want to reproduce what was happening under the man anointing all right and so there's they're saying now they they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done listen what he says now that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they are looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you hallelujah oh my we could spend a lot of time on that what was it they didn't see it right the eagle anointing came to the church and they didn't see it their eyes were not open to it they didn't recognize what was happening right in their midst the bride was being awakened the word was bringing the bride into position I was in a concert a few weeks ago with my wife someone bought us tickets to a classical concert called handle's Messiah anybody ever heard of handle's Messiah all right so you know what I'm talking about handle's Messiah is a is a classical Orchestra choir piece that was written in the 1700s and it has three parts to it or three movements the first part is written about the coming of Christ to Bethlehem and in a manger and the second part is about his rejection and his crucifixion and his resurrection but then there's a third part and the third part in the third part they use a lot of the scriptures that you hear about the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout they say there we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed this is right in the Concerto in the moment in the twinkling of an eye this Mortal will become immortality they're using scriptures that not only do we preach but we live and so as I'm sitting in the concert listening to them saying and their and their classical music and all those things I have to confess it wasn't that enjoyable but as I was sitting there listening to it I thought to myself this is exactly what brother bradam spoke about 2,000 happened 2,000 years ago where the Jews were sitting in the synagogues singing my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me my bones they stare at me they pierce my side all of those things that David sang under inspiration they're singing them as worship songs in the synagogue while out on Calvary it's happening right in front of them and I thought all of these people listening to this handles Messiah and they're singing about the change of these bodies and they're singing about the resurrection and they're singing about the Rapture and they're singing about the very things that we preach about they're singing about it while it's happening right in front of them their eyes are closed they can't recognize it but blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are you that has come under the anointing of this hour to recognize who you are to recognize your position in Christ because when the cover comes off the book and the Mystery is revealed of that's contained within the Seven Seals listen it's not about the symbols of black horse rider and red horse rider and white horse rider and pale horse rider and all of those things are just symbols of Revelations that are taking place in the day that there's an anointing that comes to the word that says you are the bride you are the Spotless one you are The Virtuous one you are the one that I have projected my love down Through the Ages that my Redemptive plan has been building up to this very hour to a very cresendo where you shall fulfill the very promise of the word there is a people that will not die there is a people that will catch the revelation of the word can you say Amen to that if there's only one of them I'm that one there's a people that will catch that Revelation and it causes them to rejoice it causes them to glory in their God it causes them to enter into a relationship with him because it's a revelation we could go to Esther and say how she had to catch the revelation of who she was she was already the queen but she had to catch the revelation of what that meant see the very revelation of what it means to be bride lays within this message I can't emphasize enough get into the message get into the word that has been sent to you to tell you who you are because when you recognize who you are you are an invincible Army in the in the sight of the devil he can't do anything with you you walk by Perfect faith in what the word says you are praise the Lord Brother Bram never said I walk by Perfect faith in how I feel I walk by Perfect faith in all my mistakes I walk by Perfect faith in the church that I'm a member of no I walk by Perfect faith in what the word says I am hallelujah what the word says I am that it's got nothing to do with how I feel about it I can't tell you as a minister the number of times I prayed for people and not felt a thing isn't that right brother Aon you pray for somebody and you don't feel a thing and yet you know God there's no reason that word cannot be fulfilled in that young man's life had a young man that was that had been hit with a puck in the chest he was a hockey goalie and in a lot of pain something must have been displaced or something they didn't know what to do for him and he kept getting it get worse and then better and worse and then better he comes into church on a weekday I'm in my in the office at the church there and he and I happened to be the only Minister that was there and the sister brings him into the into the Ser into the office says you know this is the problem could you pray for my son and so we go and into the sanctuary use the anointing oil pray for I don't feel a thing but in my heart I'm saying Lord I see no reason why your word can't be fulfilled at this very moment right and he goes he goes from there and as soon as he walks out of the church he's completely free now his testimony was as brother Tim prayed for me it got worse and worse and worse until finally he said in the name of the Lord Jesus he says then it left Hallelujah and what did I feel not a thing it's got nothing to do with what I feel I walk by faith in what this word says we are amen we are a people that has been called to fulfill every last promise of God in the last days hallelujah a lot of times people get confused because can I take a few more minutes all right because they feel the Deep call and they try to satisfy it with means other than the revelation of the word of God see there if you're a seed Gene of God if you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world there's something in you calling you to this revealed word in this hour it's calling you it's pushing you you cannot be satisfied with anything else that's why people even Believers that that don't know their Believers are predestinated the elect of God they get into things like alcohol and drugs and and and lust and different things because what are they trying to do they're trying to satisfy a spiritual call with a natural desire it'll never work if you're trapped in one of those things tonight you just need to say God forgive me me and set me free from this and fill me with your word you know the devil will tell you oh it'll make you feel better well it might make you feel better temporarily but it won't satisfy the Deep call there's a deep call in the elect of God that you're looking for that can only be satisfied in the change of these bodies in the in stepping into your theophany that's all that can be satisfied brother Bram says in Easter seal he says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man I just have to drop this in here before we move to the close he says they were eating drinking marrying giving in marriage as it was in the days of lot so will it be in the hours that the son of man will be revealed on Earth not Son of God no more son of man come back as the prophetic message of the last days don't gloss over that Amen brother Adam is taking the revealing of the son of man and tying it to the eagle anointing all right he's placing the two together what is the revealing of the son of man it's when the seals are broken all right the he's a son of man brother Brandon was a son of man revealing the son of man all right so he was a prophet revealing the prophet the god Prophet that's why you're Anointed with a prophetic anointing even though you're not a prophet right it's the anointing of the revealing of the son of man all right son of man come back as the prophetic message for the last day when the eagle will be flying not the lion not the ox in the sacrifice age see every time a religious power went forth now we're back to the anointings every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world when the lion raised up the Rel religious power it went to meet the Roman power and then when it come the sacrifice hour the ox went because he's a sacrifice Beast to the Lord then come the reformers down through the church Ages come the face of a man then the reformers have been since Luther Wesley Calvin on down Pentecostal age but in the last message that went forth there came a flying eagle it's Eagle time reveal time I'm quoting right amen what time is it it's Eagle time it's revealed time right all right the word of God made manifest the word of God proved and then he says oh children walk into this baptism of the Holy Ghost come in and believe it with all your heart God will fill you it's Eagle time it's not man time it's not Ox time it's not lion time it's Eagle time it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost of this day amen people try to make it to be something like a man age it is not a man age it is an eag I don't mean to harp on that I'm just saying that you've got to recognize the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to bring you into a perfect faith in what the word says you are amen amen that's exactly what other else manifests is fine if it's if it's lines up with the word of God but the goal of the eagle anointing is to bring you into a perfect faith of what the word says you are Hallelujah this this one that rides out under in opposition to the eagle of anointing is called death and the person of death as he's called Death a mixed horse spiritual death natural death death institutional death denominational death we could go to the seventh seal and brother BR says it's the end of all things all things end up under this seal which the seventh seal is the revealing of the son of man it is the coming of the lord it's the reason the Angels were quiet all heaven was quiet for the space of half an hour all of those things of what brother brandham said it's it's the anointing sent into this hour to bring us into the Rapture what is rapturing Faith perfect faith in what the word says you are that's what the Eagle anointing is set to bring so now as that comes into the church and takes its place within the church everything else has to die all right everything under the previous ages has to die Luther Wesley Pentecost is shock tossel shuck it all has to die for death anointing is upon the land the only thing that remains all the life goes into seed for form Hallelujah so the church comes back into the original image of the word or the seed that went into the ground in the beginning as the word was made flesh in Jesus Christ now the word is made flesh in the bride Hallelujah an anointing has come upon the church to give you a perfect faith in who you are amen hallelujah amen not in who the church is not even in who brother brandham is we believe who brother brandham was we believe he fulfilled his part and we're not doing away with that we would have nothing if it wasn't for brother brandham but because of that message that God sent through brother brandham an anointing is come upon the church to place me positionally in who I am and as long as I stay with who I am then I am invincible and that's the great thing about the infite Redemptive purpose of God because God's infinite I want you to notice now the difference between God's Eden and Satan's Eden in God's Eden the only thing you want is to be in your place Lord Place me in my place but in Satan's Eden the anointing is to be number one I want to be the best I want to be the greatest I want to be number one I wantan to I want to be the richest I want to be the most educated I want to be the best athlete I want to be this I want to be that that's Satan's Eden why because it's Satan's anointing because in the beginning the one thing Satan did not want was who he was he wanted I will exalt myself above the stars of God I will sit in the Mount of the most high I will be like God is that right that was the devil's Revelation and that's the Revelation in leosa that's the Revelation in s Zen but the bride when she catches the revelation of who she is in my position I have infinite power yes Hallelujah and I can't take somebody else's position nobody can take your place you are who you are that's why I love an infinite God my part may be so small in the kingdom of God but to an infinite God it's just as important as the biggest part in the kingdom of God because every part is a part of God himself if I had time that's a whole another subject he the infinite God he is an infinite God and because he's infinite the small means as much as the large that's what infinite means he's not just all powerful he's without limitation and you might feel like my little problem God doesn't really care about my little problem no your God is infinite and your little problem means just as much to God as the next person's big problem God you say well God doesn't have time to think about my little no your God is infinite amen there's no limitations on your God there's no such thing as a small issue he loves you and he cares about the least of your infirmities he's touched by the feelings of all of your infirmities he's a he's your great physici he's the one that overcomes all things and he's here to give you the Revelation that the curse of the word has already been paid for 2,000 years ago and you stand spotless in his sight because Christ died to redeem himself without spot without blemish without wrinkle or any such thing that's you amen and that's what you are in the sight of God you are a vital importance to him Lord help me to bring this home I can only I can think of a an example here in the Book of Numbers Chapter 5 we won't turn to it but there's something called The Law of jealousy and in the law of jealousy I think I have might have the scripture in these notes actually let me just fast forward to the end you see Christ has not just taken our punishment he's taken our guilt so that you stand Guiltless in the sight of God that's what justification is it's as though you never did it in the first place all right now in the in the law of jealousy Numbers Chapter 5 and I'll paraphrase it for you if a husband thought that his wife had been unfaithful he was commanded to take his wife to the priest and the priest was given a a certain Commandment that they would take some of the dust from the floor of the Tabernacle and they would put it in water and they would write the the words of a curse upon uh a piece of parchment or whatever it was and then they would take a cloth or a sponge or something and they would take the water and blot out the curse and put it back into the water but then they would make the woman drink the water okay and it was bitter Waters and so that and I'm just paraphrasing it not going into all the details but so that th the W when the woman drank this water it was commandment was given to her that if you have been unfaithful to your husband when you drink this water your stomach will will uh rot your thigh will rot you'll become basically unhealthy and your your life will be nothing but a miserable uh curse and you'll eventually die that was the law of the curse of jealousy and so she was commanded they wrote the words out they were blotted out put in the water she drank the water and she was commanded to say Amen to the word of God if I am guilty of this Amen to the words of that curse and so was a powerful powerful thing and that in itself is a terrible thing until you consider one thing no matter what we have done in the sight of God Jesus took our guilt we stand Guiltless because of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and so the words of the curse of this book are of no effect now we stand innocent as a woman who had never committed adultery and so now a woman that knows she never did anything wrong when the priest wrote the words and blotted out the words and gave her the water to drink and all of those things she knew she had never done anything wrong she could stand there and say Amen if i' done anything wrong so be it to me according to the words of the curse because she knew she stood Guiltless she knew it would have no effect on her CU she was Guiltless now all of the curse of the word of God has been eaten up by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ so that you can stand here this evening as the Bride of Jesus Christ and no matter what you have done look at Calvary and say I accept what Jesus did for me at Calvary and no matter what the devil tells me of how bad everything that I did I don't have faith in what I did I have faith in what he did I have faith in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ so I can take the book and I can eat the book hallelujah hallelujah no wonder the angel said to John take the book eat the book the book is open eat the book The Mysteries contained in the book are your Mysteries that God could reveal himself to you personally and it will become a part of your life not because of your good works but because of what Christ did for you you stand spotless in his sight and there's a scripture I'd never noticed the scripture before I was in you someone sent me a video of the of some I think it was baptisms or something in a church in Uganda and the one of the ministers had wrote this scripture on his Pulpit on his Pulpit right across the front of his Pulpit there right at the bottom it's from Jeremiah 15:16 and it says this thy words were found and I did eat them and Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart for I am called by thy name oh lord of host the word has been found and I did eat them the curse had been announced and I wasn't scared to eat it the death angel rote out and I wasn't scared to catch the Revelation this world is falling apart denomination is dying that's why the world is crumbling civilization is dying democracy is dying I hate to say this America you you've been such stalwarts of democracy and freedom around the world freedom is dying this American age is dying it's coming to an edge cuz the devil is riding out with death and I'm not scared to Proclaim that because I found that I stand Guiltless in the sight of God and well the curse is being poured out upon the world and diseases are breaking forth and man-made diseases are breaking forth things are breaking out of Laboratories you know the story things are happening on the world God doesn't kill man man kills himself all of these things are breaking forth in the world it doesn't matter to me how they happen or how they don't happen I stand here to eat the book and I say bride of Jesus Christ eat the book because you stand Guiltless in his sight every promise in this word is yours let his promises be unto you a rejoicing let them be a happiness to you let there be something that you can stand and say lord it's not because of anything I've done but you showed me you opened my eyes and allowed me to see myself like John in Revelation chapter 5 all heaven and under the Earth and in the earth heard the rejoicing oh Lord Worthy is the Lamb that was slain Worthy is the Lamb I wonder tonight if you're part of that bride are you yes why don't you be like Mary and say be it unto me according to Thy word I accept everything in the word not because I count myself worthy but because he made me Guiltless I accept what Christ has done and I can see what God has done in his church in these last days I'm not just church by God's grace I'm bride if I ask if I talked about Esther I'll just sum it up this way she had to realize she wasn't the third most powerful person in the Kingdom behind a hazus and hmon she had to come to the Revelation she was the second most powerful person you're not behind the devil you're in front of the devil you're not less powerful than the devil you're more powerful than the devil the power that will put the devil in Chains is in you Hallelujah we stand as a spotless bride of Jesus Christ can we stand to our feet
