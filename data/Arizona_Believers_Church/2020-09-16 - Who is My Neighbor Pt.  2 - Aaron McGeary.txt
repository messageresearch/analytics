========================================
wonderful name it's the name above all names lord there's only one name given under heaven whereby men can be saved the name of our lord jesus christ lord we're calling upon that name tonight we call upon it for healing we call upon it for salvation we call upon it for any need that we may have lord realize and it's not just merely a nomination but there's character behind that name it's a there's a life behind that name the word is identified with that name so lord we call upon you tonight to come and to speak to our hearts through your word lord we turn to nothing else not man's opinions not ideas not conspiracy theories lord or remedies or anything that may be in the world today lord we just push it all aside and we look to you we say father take the bread of life do what only you can as the master of the house and take this word divide it to us as bread and lord may each one of us receive our portion tonight lord we desire that you would speak to our neighbor's heart that you'd speak to my brother's heart my sister's heart you'd desire that you minister to families but lord may i just in your eyes in an honorable way be selfish tonight say lord speak to me i have need tonight lord i'm coming to you with the heart wide open i'm saying lord speak to me and i pray lord you just take the words which we read from your scripture the infallible uh a powerful word of god we pray that you'd bless it and bless your people that have gathered tonight we pray praise you lord we honor you we magnify you we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord while you're standing i want to read from luke chapter 10 verses 25 to 37 luke chapter 10 and we'll start with verse 25 and read to verse 37. i wanted to mention i was speaking with brother ted passadly today and he wanted to send his greetings to each of you and let you know he and his wife are praying for you and that you're in their hearts and he wanted to pass those greetings on and then also i'd reached out to him because i'd heard they were having special services this weekend for young people and so they're having special meetings for those of the age of accountability and it's directed to those ages 8 to 14. so on saturday at 10 30 and then saturday evening at 6 00 p.m they're having special meetings the evening time lighthouse there in dewey arizona so if you need more information you can see myself you may already have some of that information but just wanted to mention that to you all that if you're able to go and support it as i was talking to him he said he doesn't know how many to expect and they haven't had very many due to all the covet 19 restrictions so i said well if you don't want me to announce it i won't i said but at the very least i'd like to share it with our church so we could be in prayer for it so if your age is 8 to 14 and you're not old enough to drive up yet but if someone can take you up there and take part in those services this weekend that'd be wonderful but at the very least as a church let's just be praying for for that time around the word of the lord this weekend for those young people luke chapter 10 verse 25 if you could just pay close attention to the reading of this now while you're standing because i won't be able to go back over some of these verses for times sake but i want to just each element as we walk through this just be held in your mind and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him and the use of the word tempt here isn't that he was evil in his motive but rather he was testing him and seeing what answer he would give saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life and he said unto him what is written in the law how read us thou and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbor and jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an end and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him whatsoever thou spend us more when i come again i will repay thee which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves so the question is who was a neighbor to the one that was wounded the one that was hurt and he said to him he that showed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise amen you may be seated we're just picking right up with the subject of who is my neighbor and they got me a large bottle of water today so i preach as long as i have water so i hope you don't have plans on thursday but the subject we're looking at is who is my neighbor we're drawing it specifically from the question that this lawyer asked of him and in verse 30 29 and we are asking the question of ourselves trusting that each one of us could do it as believers then maybe we're asking this question as a church who is our neighbor but we're not asking to justify ourselves but we're doing so to understand our calling to understand our position in christ and even i think maybe we use the words last wednesday what our duty is what our responsibility is to christ and to others and we were mentioning at the very end that we have humanistic instincts that uh want to create cliques or create cultures that are contrary to the the nature of christ and we don't do so out of evil intent and we don't do it setting out to deviate from the standards of christ but there's just human instincts that we have whether it be tribal or whether it be familial or whether just be our longing to belong and to have a sense of acceptance we have certain uh instincts that we have in our flesh that can create groups and create identity identities around them or create a culture that we must be able to overcome as christians we can't default in any any spectrum we cannot default to our carnal base instincts because those base instincts are contrary to christ and that may be very hard for some people to comprehend especially you're good natured at heart and you just just by way you're raised you have certain integrities and you try to be decent we have to realize that our very base instincts are carnal they're fleshly and they're animalistic in many different ways and we're reading a statement where brother branham was in new york and he witnessed somebody fall down and how all the new yorkers just kept passing by him and bill abraham said that he went over there and helped pick him up and he and he helped the woman collect all her oranges or whatever it is she spilt and the woman kind of looked at him funny and i believe he kind of relayed this conversation uh maybe into a cab driver i might be mixing up statements but he related to somebody and the guy said man they would have you'd be really an oddball you'd definitely be an out-of-towner if you reach out to assist somebody who is in need because that's just not the way people act in new york and this isn't social commentary on new yorkers unless there be a new yorker here but he he the the cab driver says well you know they're good people but they just get into the swing of things and brother branham then relates that to the church he says they don't mean to be that way it's just a swing it's just a groove or a rut that they get into that's just the way that they act and he says that's how the church does he says it's just getting in the swing that's the way we do brethren in our church life we get into a swing of one certain creed or one certain thing or there we and and there we stay see we swing with the rest of them and so he's talking about how we just kind of get into a mode of thinking a mode of acting a way of doing things and he says we just swing into a certain creases or into a certain thing so it's not just an ideology it's not a theology or even a particular doctrine can even just a way of thinking a way of acting a way of perceiving a way of processing it's our values and our value judgments that we make says you just get into us the swing saying it's the swing that kept that person other people from instinctively helping out a fellow human who fell down and lost all their oranges and so that's just kind of the recap of some of the things we were mentioning last time just to go in further because what's what my burden is is church must be more than just a meeting place we're just looking for a meeting place we could find a lot of those and it has to be more than just a meeting place of people who are like-minded and to that end it's more than just a meeting place of people who believe the message or or believe in christ or even are filled with the holy ghost because we've met number of times outside of church or outside the context of a sermon being ministered but church is just not a gathering of people who identify with a certain thing because there's no identity politics there's no group politics politics has no place in a church so we don't come just as a meeting place because we have things in common but church must serve to inspire it must serve to inspire to service and how this how this has just came upon my heart very weighty as the parable of the good samaritan holds truths that must be at the core of our very being and not just our human beings but our spiritual being that what jesus is identifying in what we call the parable of the good samaritan are so many different layers to this we can identify ourselves in several different aspects some of us may instinctively identify ourselves as the one that is wounded others of us may want to identify ourselves with the good samaritan you may identify yourself with christ who's telling the story or the the levite or the priest but there's different ways that we can identify with this story and it speaks to things that ought to be at the core of how we think and how we act and how we process things as christians and i want to begin by looking at the two questions that are posed by this lawyer and i feel somewhat qualified to get into his mind and to speak about these questions that are being posed but there's two questions that are posed by the lawyer and it's important to see the connection between them because as you read it and it starts out one way and then you come down to the next questions that ask and just by the flow of it it's i find that it's easy to kind of leave what was the initial a serve and what was the initial question and you feel like you're in a different place by the time you read uh jesus's answer and the final conclusion well the one that was uh that one that showed mercy you kind of end up in a different place but they're connected together and in verse 29 it says but he willing to justify himself senator unto jesus and who is my neighbor now that's the second question that's the question that we're examining in these series of services as the lord would lead but the first question is found in verse 25 and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life so the second question who is my neighbor is not divorced from or separate from his initial line of questioning his initial line of question is what he could do to inherit eternal life so for the remainder of this discussion between christ and this lawyer we have to remember that eternal life is at the core of it it's at the center of it and eternal life is essentially an issue whether it be how you obtain it how it's expressed or what it what it involves the question is how can i inherit eternal life and then jesus is going to start from that point and and i'm saying this and i'm laboring on it right now do not divorce or separate the next stage of the conversation and the next question from the central question of what is eternal life and this phrase of inherit eternal life it would be a phrase that would have been used by a jewish jewish rabbis it was a phrase that would have been familiar in the oral tradition in the torah which is later memorialized in the talmud so the the question of eternal life and how you can inherit eternal life and even the issue of eternal life isn't foreign to a jew to a rabbi to a levite so when we read it we say well how can i inherit eternal life we think in terms of christian things wow how can i be a christian how can i enter eternal life we think of salvation that's given on the cross and how we receive eternal life this would have been a different mode of thinking prior to the sacrifice and prior to even the knowledge that the messiah would be a lamb to be slain that we might receive eternal life so this was a question that was not unfamiliar to a levite to a priest to a rabbi in daniel chapter 12 verse 2 it says and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame in everlasting contempt so it's an old testament concept and they used the phrase even of abraham and isaac and jacob and the phrases often used the world to come they believed in an afterlife they believed in eternal life and so the question is how can i inherit eternal life and the conclusion of this parable as we refer to it or this change has not varied from the original question when we get down to the end and jesus says go and do thou likewise he has not varied from the original subject of what is eternal life and how can i inherit it and it actually there's i i felt just to maybe lay this out there as i pondered it myself personally just to address maybe a difficult issue that's presented by the this conversation with this lawyer because if we look at verse 25 he says master what shall i do to inherit eternal life and he said on him what is written in the law how read is thou the law what is written therein and how do you read what are your conclusions based upon the law and jesus would have known uh that there was this this thought process of what it would take to inherit eternal life and and how valuable the law is so this is a very clever question by jesus he says and he answering him said this is the lawyer now thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and jesus says unto him in verse 28 thou has answered right this do and thou shalt live now when i read that it begs the question for me can a man obtain eternal life by merely obeying the law and that's kind of the question that you you read how can i obtain eternal life well what do you read in the law he says love thy the lord with all thy heart love with all thy soul and i strength love thy neighbor as myself he says this dude you've answered correctly you've answered write this do and thou shalt live but jesus isn't necessarily trying to answer the question in a way to where we would conclude all i got to do is keep the law i have eternal and have eternal life jesus has actually turned the question against the questioner he's actually completely he's he's led the lawyer into a box and as a lawyer when you cross-examine somebody you ask certain questions and what you're doing is building the box so that you finally ask the last question and you've impeached them and you never ask a question you don't know the answer to this is just some lessons in cross-examination for anybody who's taking the bar exam soon and going to be a lawyer you never ask a question you don't know the answer to when you're cross-examining somebody and you only ask yes or no questions regard so you already suggest something in the question and regardless what they say the jury's like he beats his wife like have you when did you stop beating your wife well there's really no way you can answer that without uh without suggesting that you did at least at one time there's a way that people can be incriminated just by the way you ask your question and i'm by no means wanting to intimidate you if i ever ask you a question but this is what jesus does in a way he builds a box and now he said well what do you read in the law and this lawyer very eager to stand up for the law which they believe jesus is just trotting all over and very eager to stand up for what they identify themselves the law that was given by moses answers but he's really led him into a corner and he says well you're right do that and you'll live and now the lawyer's got to get out of the box he's got to find a way out of the corner and that's what basically the second justifying question comes up because now he gets a little bit defensive because jesus says do this do this thou answered right do this and this is where the real hardship lays because his response surprises the lawyer and jesus according to the law is saying that eternal life was not to be had without this in other words according to the law you could not have eternal life and not do these things and so he convicts the lawyer of the impossibility of obtaining eternal life because he cannot perfectly keep the law so it's really beautiful the way that jesus just very quickly gets the lawyer to espouse his belief in the law and then jesus oh you've said very good do this and you'll live and now he has to somehow justify himself because now he's convicted have i perfectly kept the law am i able to love the lord thy god with all my heart soul and mind am i able to do these things am i able to love my neighbor as myself and so feeling this conviction the lawyer retorts well who is my neighbor and as i pondered i thought perhaps he was most conscious of his attitude and treatment of others and even non-jews and that's why he he answers so instinctively well if i must keep this part of the law to obtain eternal life i i feel blameless perhaps in my my belief that i love god with all that i am but the question of how do i treat my neighbor then it becomes well who is my neighbor he might feel very good about how he treats another jew but jesus says just in just two statements completely broke this person down and has them trying to justify themselves trying to figure a way out of this box and so the parable of the good samaritan and i this we're coming just right to the thrust of what's in my heart for this evening the parable of the good samaritan and the way that jesus answers this question he says well who is my neighbor and jesus immediately says a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and and i'm just going to scratch the surface of some of these things and i want to go very much deeper into the elements of this parable even how brother branham identified jerusalem to jericho as a downward backsliding and all these different elements there's so much depth to this question uh to this story into this this parable but when jesus begins to tell this story of the certain man who went from jerusalem down to jericho he's going right back to the question of eternal life he's not just merely answering who is your neighbor and now let's change the subject and let's begin to talk about who is your neighbor he's still looking at this concept of eternal life because he says in verse 37 as fda says and who is it that you think is the neighbor to him that was fallen upon by thieves in verse 37 and he said the answer the lawyer says he that showed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do that likewise this is still pointing us to eternal life because he says he that showed mercy the lawyer's answer he that showed mercy upon the wounded and mercy means kindness or goodness towards those who are afflicted or those who are harmed and a willingness or a desire to help them it's not just merely saying oh bless his heart or old poor soul or that poor guy or boy that person's a mess or mercy lord have mercy on them but it's actually mercy to have mercy on somebody not only requires you to recognize a weakness a deficiency a harm or them to be a victim of something but there also has to be a willingness or desire to help them in their need or in their weakness so he says he that showed mercy on him he that recognized the need and and towards the wounded and had a desire to help them and so it's the lawyer's answer that the samaritan was the neighbor to the victim jesus doesn't say so and certainly it's implied i wouldn't argue that it's not implied but it's the lawyer's answer that the samaritan the one that you perhaps wouldn't have expected to show mercy he's the one that was a neighbor to the victim and then jesus says go and if i could put it in these words go and show kindness to the hurting go and show care and kindness towards the afflicted go and you yourself show a desire to help and and as i said a moment ago he hasn't left the question of eternal life so you might be asking yourself how does this answer the question or speak to eternal life but there's a tremendous connection that's being made master what can i do to inherit eternal life well what does the law say well the law says to love the lord and to love your neighbor with all your heart and he says very good do this and you shall live and then the lawyer by this by these statements by christ and even his own answer he feels compelled to ask the question of to expand upon love thy neighbor as thyself well then who is my neighbor and jesus in giving his answer has now connected the the activity or the behavior of the samaritan to what eternal life is and and i want to start by reading a statement i say start i want to advance further in this by reading a statement on that day on calvary and i know some of you are probably already just plugging right into where i'm going with this and he's talking about our salvation and what was wrought for us on calvary in the shedding of blood and accepting of the of the sacrifice and how that after we've been uh sealed by the holy ghost and we experienced this great salvation he says but don't look to what you've done look what that day on calvary did to you it paid your price it settled the question let's just all fellowship in this today just begin to have a heart for the person that's sitting next to you behind you in front of you because the devil always tries to bring up the sin question always tries to bring up imagination conscience memory reason and affection and he tries to tie that with sin to beat us down to keep us from going forward but brother man says your skin your sins be as scarlet they're white as snow red like crimson white like wool it says then you have no sin you are perfectly sinless no matter what you've done or what you do you are still sinless oh this scares this scares some people because they're afraid that if you preach to a believer that they're sinless then all they're going to do is sin well if they just take you at your word for it and they just they want to take it carnally i could see that being a danger but a sincere hearted believer is going to hear that and say if i'm sinless then i can be sinless if yesterday's sin don't matter afternoon sins don't matter then it drives them to a greater consecration and a place of surrender to where they can live this life before christ that is that is uh that is befitting of the grace that they've received says then you have no sin you're perfectly sinless no matter what you've done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted jesus christ as your savior your sins are forgiven anything that's forgiven is remitted and forgot about that's wonderful amen he says then what does it do it gives you after that condition his spirit to follow him and do his he did for others who is following on so it's it has this rippled down effect that he what he's done for you it puts you in a condition to live for him for others who are following on because now there's others that need to be impacted so he says he's just one man the perfect man he gave his life and made an example for you now what must we do if i could connect it to how he's saying this it gives you after that condition it gives you his spirit to follow him now that i have his spirit what must we do he says now the first thing i want to say is jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life so perfectly eternal life is living for others jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others and living for others my paraphrasing there is perfectly eternal life so when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine nothing against doing good things certainly nothing against going to church or we would be maybe on some measure a hypocrite tonight but he says when you say you go to church you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come in the lamb of god he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day receiving calvary receiving the cross and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others so can you say how what jesus's answer in the parable of the good samaritan is connected with eternal life because here's the samaritan he does not pass by the wounded he does not pass by the aggrieved and the victim but he renders aid to him and the others the levi the priest may have been very busy may have had a lot of things to do but they weren't willing to stop and help but the samaritan stopped for the other person who was hurting and jesus said that's perfectly eternal life when you live your life to yourself you don't have eternal life because eternal life is living for others he says you when you receive your salvation you don't live for yourself no more you live for others so perfectly eternal life is a life that's spent for others brother branham makes this statement in revelations chapter 5 part 1 he says a few days ago i was sitting talking to my loyal little friend here in the city of medical doctor sam and dare and he said how you doing bill and i said oh pretty fair i suppose doc i said yourself and he said oh a lot of patience said i had 15 examinations this afternoon i said well that's good as long as it's just examinations and finding nothing wrong he says and you know we got to talking back when we were boys i said well doc i don't know just how long i'm going to be around we're both in our 50s that's true bill but all these years about 31 years of ministry now i've kept my heart prepared for that hour when he comes so it doesn't matter when he comes so he said that's true and i said brother brahm said this the greatest thrill i have is living for others so this is great the greatest thrill he has and he said that's what life is makes life real is not what you can do or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others now think of this this conversation now we've already witnessed one conversation between a lawyer and jesus christ now we see a conversation between a doctor and a minister and the conversation seems to be in a little bit better channel than the one that the lawyer was in and they're talking about how you can live for others and brother branson the greatest thrill i've had in 31 years of ministry is living for others and the doctors like that's what makes life real what makes life real is what you can accomplish for others what you can do for others not for yourself and then brother man says see that's your that's when you're really living and if there happens to be someone amongst us who's never did that tried to live for somebody else give that a try and just see how much more life holds for you when you will not live for what you can get yourself out of life but what you can give someone else in life why isn't that wonderful to think that if you've never tried this way of thinking before if you've never tried this as a lifestyle as a governing principle in your life don't live your life for what you can get out of life but live your life to see what you can give someone else in life he says try to live that way for once and i think that it isn't instinctive for most people in the la day and age that we live in now it's really get yours while you can even if it's at the expense of somebody else getting theirs get what you can when you can look out for yourself if the people's rights has become individual rights to where there's a point where they don't even know where to stop when my right of fringe is on your right now how are we going to mediate this is going to be rock paper scissors we're going to flip a coin if everybody's rights matter then it's just a point to where there's no way of ever having this integrity or or this line that we can say this is this is moral this is principled it's just a democracy it's like a ship without an anchor and so we have we realized then that brother branham is saying hey if you can live for somebody else that changes things when you're no longer living for yourself or you're living for other people he says this is the way to live he says you'll find that it's more blessed than riches or anything that can be thought of is what you can do for someone else to make life's burdens and and i i'm just going to inject this the way that the the conversation the state was being made you would maybe think you say make someone's burdens lighters or make somebody's burdens taken away from them but he says which life in itself is a burden and it will make it light a little lighter for someone else you don't know the joy unless you've tried it once to do something for someone else can we all just take that into our hearts as individuals tonight that what brother adam is pointing us to is the greatest thrill is living for others that's when you're really living is not what you can accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others and life holds so much more when you live to see what you can give somebody else in life and then let's just nail it down really tight perfectly eternal life is living for others so it would beg the question if you're selfish and not living for others the question would be well then do you have eternal life and then it would then our the way that we should internalize that is not to abandon our belief that we have eternal life but challenge ourselves what filters are in place that's keeping this unselfish life that we have done inside of us this nature of the lamb this nature to be self-sacrificial this nature to give this nature to serve what is it that's hindering it could be scars it could be complexes could be uh the stumbling blocks that we've seen along the way and bad examples but lord i want to free up this nature of christ to be a servant that it could exude through me and that i can no longer be looking out after my own but looking upon the needs of others because that's what eternal life is eternal life is living for others it says you don't know joy until you've lived for someone else if you are experiencing even a melancholy or depression or even anxiety you'll find that if you could come if you can identify a way that you are helpful a need that you're meeting focus on the fact that you can give something that you have a benefit that you can do to somebody else a way that you can aid or you can help you'll find that it lightens that anxiety it'll help lighten this burden of depression and melancholy and sometimes you just feel very overwhelmed but when you think about how that you can be helpful how that you're meeting the need and there's a service to give it has a way of lightening your own burdens not just those who you're going to serve but it'll actually lighten your own when you recognize that i have a need that there's a there's a need that i can meet there's a ministry that i can walk in there's a way that i can serve and then would you not realize then why the devil would want to take away those kind of confessions from you make you feel worthless make you feel useless make you feel like you don't have a place and and i don't there's nothing i can do and i have this problem and i've had that problem and i'm damaged goods or i wear a scarlet letter whatever it may be but listen you have a place within the body of christ there's a measure that you have to give out there's a hundred fold in your life that can be expressed and it does not deprive you of service you have something you can give in galatians chapter 6 verses 1 to 10 there's a there's a lot of principles here that i look forward to maybe unpacking more later but i want to hit just a few highlights galatians chapter 6 verses 1 to 10 brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted i could just see the image of this man who went down from jerusalem to jericho went from the heavenly place jerusalem now he's falling down he's backsliding his brother man said going to jericho so i could see the image of even this man of luke chapter 10 in this verse if any man be overtaken in a fault he says ye which are spiritual are to restore the one who's overtaken in the fault but you must do it in a spirit of meekness and you have a spirit of meekness because you consider yourself lest thou but also be tempted so there's so much that goes into this and if you've ever been in a situation where you made a mistake you offended somebody or you did some great harm or were accused of being do it of doing a great harm but nobody reached out to restore you or nobody else wanted to get you take you out of that fault you who are overtaken and nobody else did it and reached out to you to help you overcome it then then the conclusion i come to anymore is they're just not spiritual or they realize being spiritual they can't do it in the spirit of meekness considering the known cells but these those who are spiritual are commissioned according to the scripture in a spirit of meekness considering their own selves to see somebody who's stumbling see somebody who's overtaken in a fall and help them not beat them up not tell them and inform them they've been overtaken in a fault because a lot of times we just tell people the obvious you really messed up pal and like yeah thanks i think i figured that part out well you know what you did wrong i think i know that better than you all right just wanted to know see you later and uh maybe that's what the priest said when he walked by the guy said you should have had some mace you wouldn't be in that problem maybe the levite walks by why aren't you packing this is an open carry country you wouldn't have those problems if you'd have taken a different way and there's maybe a lot of opinions but nobody wants to offer a solution but someone who's spiritual and i trust that you're spiritual tonight you you are tasked and you're scripturally commissioned in a spirit of meekness to restore somebody who's overtaken in a fault and then it makes this statement bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ now this is uh this is very weighty no pun intended saying bear ye one another's burdens and in doing so you're going to fulfill the law of christ this can go right back to even how jesus was saying himself love thy neighbor as thyself he said you fulfill the law of christ by bearing one another's burden so he's telling you to feel for and not just feel for them but assist each other when someone has a burden assist them not just be like oh that must be heavy but reach out to him show mercy do something to help them overcome and he says bear ye another's burdens and that word bird means a heaviness or weight or trouble and the very greek word that's used there is the idea of bringing down so it says bear one another's burdens a weight that's causing someone to bow under the pressure so we are commissioned to bear another's burdens if it's weighing them down and it's causing them to be weakened or to be troubled so he says for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone in not in another for every man shall bear his own burden now if you read this and you haven't left the principle that was elicited in verse 2 immediately you feel like there's a contradiction or at least a paradox because he says you have to bear one another's burdens but now he says every man shall bear his own burden we say well paul then what is it do i need to bear one another's burdens or do i need to bear my own burdens but he's showing that in this as he said already for if he any man think of himself to be something and every man must prove his own work he's talking about us as individuals we all must answer for ourselves and we don't have to answer for our neighbors we have to answer for ourselves and so if your neighbor does something he's going to answer for it you don't have to answer for what he's done but you'll answer for your attitude towards them the answer for how you respond to that or how you treat them so your answer not necessarily for his conduct but your attitude towards it or your response to it and so he says that every man must prove his own work and then he'll have rejoicing in himself and not another for every man shall bear his own burden and this burden here means load or obligation and the greek word that used it brings up the image of loading a ship that you have a responsibility you got to take these goods from point a to point b then you load it up and you load it wherein it's capable to bear it and to transport it to somewhere else so there's burdens that you receive that are your individual responsibility every man must account for himself he must answer for himself not his neighbor and every man must bear his own burden that he's been tasked with but when you see that your neighbor is being made heavy and brought down then bear that burden because it may be greater than what they're tasked with could be a burden that you're putting on them and so these are actually two different burdens two different burdens that are being referenced here so then he continues he says let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall he also reap this fits right in with what you do in verse one what you do in verse two what you do in verse five there's a sowing that's taking place and therefore there's a reaping for he that sow up to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting he that sows to the spirit labor sowing to the spirit will reap eternal life so it supports the truth that eternal life is living for others it's not saying that if you'll just sow to the spirit you will obtain eternal life and that you can somehow win it by your own good works but this is abundant living this is how that you can live fruitfully this is how you can live abundantly this is how you can live joyously this is how you can unburden the fruits of spirit in your own life is sowed to the spirit and you'll reap of the spirit life everlasting and a fruitful life so he says let us not be wearing while doing because that's how you sow to the spirit you're doing good you're doing the things that you ought to do for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and as we therefore have opportunity let us do good i don't know if you're reading the amplified or the new translation but my bible says let us do good unto all men i don't know of any notes in the column or any commentary anything that says no that's not what he meant he meant only some men he meant only these men or men only and not women no it's let us do good unto all men all mankind there's no listen there's no qualification for doing good unto all men and i mean i mean this very seriously that that one's preferences their orientations or lifestyle does not mean you have a right to hate them and do evil towards them you're not given any license to do something that is not christ-like say oh well that's just contrary to the word of god and you're going to spite them you're going to do evil to them you're going to try to make them miserable you've abandoned the principles of scripture and we should we should live in this fear that if we do good unto all men we're somehow advocating something that's unrighteous or advocating something that's perverted no you do no more harm to the name of christ in the name of christianity by doing harm to those who don't agree with you than you ever would by doing kindness exhibit the nature of christ show that you're you can live above it that you're not intimidated by it when you see people have so much vitriol and hatred for certain things sometimes begs the question of whether or not they have a problem themselves where where's the hatred coming from where's the spike coming from that doesn't come from the word that doesn't come from the cross but he says do good unto all men then especially unto them who are of the household of faith so there's an especially that would require some discernment as to who is of the household of faith but it puts us on guard i must do good unto all men and if i'm doing good unto all men i wouldn't have to worry about doing wrong to someone of the household of faith so i at least want to start from the principle that the scripture is telling me that we should do good unto all men this isn't paul's suggestion this has been a given the the stamp and the seal of god's breath the theoph nustos has breathed these words all scriptures given by inspiration let us do good unto all men and if i'm doing that then i'm in a better position to especially do good under the household of faith brother branham says in the world has fallen apart i appreciate you you're just pulling so fervently tonight and i would like to say that it the harder you pull the longer i preach but sometimes the harder you pull the faster i preach but the message world has fallen apart the other man says i was talking to the cab driver coming down we was talking about some delinquent children up there and he said i think it's the parents and i said amen fellow i don't know who you are but you're on the right road well i must have just thrilled brother brannan wow yes i preach it's parental delinquency not juvenile delinquency he says man you're on the right road and i said that's right it's too bad that they took the bible out of the home and give them a deck of cards now this is a this is a tremendous principle because none of you might have a deck of card in your house right i mean now we just can do it online we can do it on a computer solitaire was just put on there by bill gates thank you bill gates i can play cards on my computer so we may not have a deck of cards it might seem old-fashioned sometimes we can preach against going to bowling alleys we're like bowling alleys that's the most sanctified family fun there is anymore because it meant something different at the time right it was it was totally something different so we have to think about what is the principle that brother branham's eliciting right now what does he want us to think about you've taken the word and swapped it for something else so i could i could use a lot of names but just starting out you don't want to offend everybody but you there's a lot of things that could be elicited here there's a lot of things that you could pinpoint but let the holy spirit lead you in your own life taking the word swapping it for something else then he makes this statement and that started in the church so the process of taking the word and replacing it with something else happened in the home then it happens in the church and that's the order you'll find that's the order it always happens that way the church doesn't let the bars down first the families start doing it and that's how it gets in the church if you don't have a word standard in the church just let the family start doing it and the bars will stop dropping that's why i think our mission even as a church is to inspire families encourage family equip families with the tools necessary to keep the standard in the home because the husbands they're the pastors to their wives the husbands are the shepherd in the home the wife's the associate pastor you have your own little flock that you're that you're leading that you're guiding and that that's the principle that we want to really encourage not that we just come to church to be told what to do and figure you know this is what you should be doing this is what you should be doing but trying to encourage you because you're the defense you're the health of the church you're they're the ones that keep the church clean that keep the church pure not the deacons at the door with the measuring stick but the families the fathers in the homes the mothers who are looking out after their children she says what happened in the family taking the word and swapping it out for entertainment those are my words now he said that started in the church so a process of usurping the word and flop taking out the word and the purity of the word in mixing in something else that holds people's attention and and and keeps them from being bored entertains them so he says and that's starting the church i was standing on the elevator a few moments ago and a certain woman on there talking to another said well you know this is a wonderful thing our church is given a card party and how they were going to have some kind of thanksgiving turkey affair and they wasn't going out of a protestant church he says and they was going out there was going gambling he goes lottery bunko dances all when it gets to that time that people have to do stuff like that let me just kind of read through this again he exchanges he tells us of an exchange with a cab driver he says man the problem with the world today is the parents he's like you're right the families let down the bar and then he says it's too bad they took the bible out of the home and given them a deck of cards and then brother brandon says you know what we've done the same thing in the church because i heard these ladies talk in the elevator how they were their church was given a card party and they're having some kind of thanksgiving turkey affair and they was going he says out of a protestant church and he says gambling lottery bunko dances i don't know if bunko is necessarily but i think it's some kind of card game he says when it gets to a time that people have to do stuff like that to entertain the church now again we don't even know what bunko is so we're we're not tempted to bunk oh we don't know how bunko got into church but he starts talking about gambling lottery dances it's the principle not of specifically taking the bible out and buying a deck of cards and putting it on your end table but what is it that has taken place of the word have we allowed the worship services to have more preeminence than the preaching have we allowed position to mean more than the preaching have we allowed the politics to mean more than the preaching whatever it might be it may not be bunker it may not be gambling or lottery but he says anything that binds the people to church attendance and not the word is the swapping that he's preaching against he says to entertain the church what to get their attention to be the drawing card it's amazing how quickly children to run will run to a screen if they hear something playing on it they're just like a a a a bug to a nightlight why because they're drawn to it and in the same way he's saying are we having to put up artificial light to get people to come to church is there a way that we want to get them to stick and make them come back and make them be there he says if we've taken anything in the word and we've taken the word out and replaced it with someone else he said something else to entertain the church so this is what started in the church we use other things to get people to come we use other things to get their attention and we use other things to keep them their attention he says to entertain the church he's identifying that process he says the church born again the holy ghost entertains the church with eternal life isn't that wonderful when i when i read it it struck me the holy ghost entertains the church with eternal life in other words the church's entertainment is eternal life now we could i i think that it could stand for the the the if you were to diagram it that the holy ghost entertains the church who has eternal life absolutely if you have eternal life the holy ghost entertains you but now let's think about what your entertainment is what is that once you've been put into that condition as brother brown said then what must we do those who are now have the holy spirit and you have this holy spirit inside of you and now you're following him to do as he did then what do we do next we are entertained by eternal life we have eternal life and then what do we do we live for others which is eternal life and what gives you joy what a brother says you don't know joy unless you've tried it what living for others so the holy spirit entertains the church with eternal life the holy holy spirit entertains the church by living for others that's our entertainment i mean that might be an interesting way if anybody asks you so what does your family do for fun we live for others and we're like okay all right what are you uh amish i i don't know what question they might ask you but they're certainly gonna try to figure out what makes you tick does the holy ghost desire to entertain the church he wants to entertain you with eternal life living for others becomes your entertainment living for others becomes your joy living for others becomes your becomes your motto it's kind of what makes you your family tick it's kind of this is the rule that we live by living for others if it doesn't fit within that paradigm we we question if what we're doing is right and we we examine whether or not we're doing something that would be displeasing to the lord and i'm not trying to suggest any absolutes in that but it's a principle that we can say we live by i have the holy spirit the church that has the holy spirit is entertained with eternal life so i would even ask of this church how does the holy ghost desire to entertain this church what and i'm saying this to a very very small group a very small audience but i say so it becomes the fabric of how we begin does the church does the church want to grow through programs do we want to get people's attention merely through activities but through all of it do we have a heart for people and we want to see the word touch their lives and make a difference for them even if it means they they never attend church again even if it means that they don't necessarily come and become what we would might call members of a church but do you desire to see the word touch people's hearts how does the holy ghost desire to entertain this church because the holy ghost entertains the church with eternal life eternal life is living for others so i believe we can do the math the holy ghost entertains the church with living for others that's what would keep us busy as a church that's what becomes our our guidelines and our parameters in romans chapter 15 verses 1 to 3 he says we them that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves so there's if you see a self-pleaser maybe they're weak brother tom was sharing with me a quote uh last week really really struck me i wrote it down i guess it certainly would have been applicable here but somebody who's always wanting attention he said their brother bam said they're spiritually sick and here he says when we that we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves and i would say weak or strong don't be a self-pleaser but if you are strong then you are equipped to bear the infirmities of the weak and don't use your strength as liberty to promote yourself or to do good unto yourself but but please others because he says let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edificate for his good to edification i will expound upon this more perhaps at a later time but this is very clear let us every one of us please our neighbor for his good for his edifying for his good that he might be built up we who are strong will bear the infirmities of our neighbor that we might please our neighbor for his good for his building up for even christ pleased not himself and this is exactly what brother branham identifies when he says eternal life is living for others he points to how jesus christ lived so paul now speaking to the romans if you're strong bear the infirmities of the weak don't try to please yourself please your neighbor for his good for his building up that he that is weak might be made strong for even christ please not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproach thee fell on me so he was he took on the burdens of the weak he took on the burdens of the reproach he's saying we should do likewise brother braham said in the message at thy word a person who lives their life to their self lives a selfish life we must live for others this is why the the prescription is not just to go find a a piece of land somewhere that's far far far far away from everybody else and just live his hermits because you can't have eternal life that way you say well is that all it takes to get eternal life no we're talking about living eternal life talking about manifesting it you cannot just be out on your own and be walking in this he says we must live for others bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ lord in galatians 6 2. and we've got to have a feeling for one another this is his words and we got to have a feeling for one another and therefore when you do all you know how to do then when you do lay down at night well you have the consolation knowing that you tried your best so it's not that there has to there's some perfection we're striving to attain we're everybody who has a need we have to meet it we're always stopping we're always doing this we're always just trying to go over the top to get it done he says no when you know you've done your best you lay your head down at night he says you have consolation i can't make and then he says this and i think this is very instructive to ministry but to all of us as we witness as we believe and pray for others he says i can't make everyone believe that's impossible jesus couldn't do that when he was on earth our goal isn't to try to make people believers listen if you make someone a believer then you make a make-believer all you'll be able to make is a make-believer and so we don't try to make people believe he says jesus couldn't do it brother branham couldn't do it and i know there'll be just a few that believes but if anything i can add to help the gospel that's my duty being here is to try to help somebody along the way so the goal isn't to try to make everybody message believers the goal isn't to try to make everybody perfect the goal is to do the best you can to add to help the gospel he says that's my duty i believe he's speaking to himself as a minister to try to help somebody along the way that's our commission and our calling go into all the world and preach the gospel all of us all of our families all of us as individuals are under that commission it doesn't say go preach the gospel and make them believers it just says these fine signs shall follow them that believe and so i don't have a i don't have a value system or way of judging others if they don't believe i maintain my integrity and i maintain a respectful attitude and i and i love them through their weakness and i stay patient with them as i can that i don't try to belittle and beat them up or threaten or intimidate them i do good unto all men and i do what i can as a benefit to the gospel to help somebody along the way my brother david told a testimony shortly after his conversion i believe he was living i was living i don't think he was living in a pet store but he was working at a pet store his bedroom smelled like a pet store i could say that so he was living in what smelled like a pet store but he told a story how that a buddy of his he used to do uh do stuff with came into the pet store and saul was like david what are you doing here and he's like oh man let's go do some stuff let's do some drugs and david said hey man i'm free of that completely delivered just like that god completely cleaned my life up the guy got all you know just emotionally said david i wish i could be like that david said you can be right now i can pray for you right here in this pet store let's get down on our knees let's pray let's ask god to deliver you and david prayed a sincere prayer for this young man and prayed for that god would deliver him and set him free now i just want to say now not remembering the outcome that i believe that god could set that young man free from a drug addiction because a son of god laid his hands on him and he believed that he could be delivered and i wouldn't have to say now before i do do you have you ever read malachi 4 5 oh you haven't well hold on i know this drug addiction's really getting to you right now you're a little twitchy but let's turn to malachi 4 5. i'd say the bible says you can lay hands on the sick and they'll and they'll be healed i my own self was delivered of drugs god did that for me do you believe god can do that for you and meet them on that basis without any strings attached if i don't see at church sunday it's going to come back on you no god if you can deliver somebody from drugs what an asset to that man's family what a greater benefit to our community at large if you had one less drug addict sometimes why marvel why people wonder how can can a lawyer be a christian i say so you tell me do you want all the crooked lawyers representing the guilty criminals and they're like oh well on second thought maybe we should have a few christians representing the criminals brother branham says this faith in the son of god so each day i want to live not for myself if i live for myself i live a selfish life i want to live for others give what strength i have not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that will build the kingdom of god that beautiful as paul said let every one of us please our neighbor not please ourselves brother says i want to live for others give what strength i have not for myself and to my own pleasure not to please myself but for the benefit of others that will build the kingdom of god brother branham writes this in the church age book chapter six dietary church age he says jesus said he that is greatest of all is servant to all a wise man comment on that saying here is what he said and brother man's quoting this wise man only history will prove the truth of that dictum the brother man says that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head have gone down in shame even the very rich are condemned by god when they have not used their wealth right so it's okay to be wealthy just use it right they who have demanded to be served oppressed others saw always to be at the head have gone down in shame even the rich if they have not used the riches correctly have been condemned by god but look into history and you'll find that the truly great were those who served others history can never acclaim those for whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others now let us apply that to ourselves as brother branham writing it says even as the son of man came to be ministered unto came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we are to follow that example the son of man has not come in this hour the word is not united with flesh in this hour that we can sit back and be served but rather the son of man is expressed again in the bride's body so that we likewise can follow his example and serve the ministry of the son of man is that well son of man you're here to do something for me come on buddy bless me pour out a blessing i need to raise the minister of the son of man isn't here to try to meet all of our needs and to make us feel good and to take us all of our troubles and everything but the ministry of the son of man through you through the bride's body is to serve others follow that example see him as he bows himself over the feet of the apostles and washes their tired and dirty feet he says you don't know what i'm doing now but you will know hereafter what you see me doing you ought to also do he became a servant in order that god could elevate him to the highest heights and one day in the judgment of the saints we're going to hear him say well done good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of the lord it is hard to always to be always a servant acknowledges it's hard to always be a servant but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne it will be worth it all then it'll be worth it all every effort given every prayer prayed every tear shed whatever everything you've given there should never be this point where i was in vain all it was wasted oh it didn't mean nothing listen there'll be no pain wasted your own personal heartaches your own physical pains there'll be no pain wasted god uses every twinge every ache every heartache every brokenness every tear god uses all of it in this life he uses all of it and in the life to come it'll all be worth it then paul had written this in galatians chapter 5 before he even said bear one another's burdens and he's encouraging to go to those who are overtaken in a fault and restore them he writes in galatians chapter 5 verses 13 to 15 for brethren you have been called into liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another you've been called to liver liberty don't use your liberty to satisfy yourself why wouldn't that doesn't i just put some restraint on even some of the things that we we have liberty to do well i'm free to do this i can do whatever i want but it's not just liberty to make yourself happy but he says use this liberty to by love serve one another you have time to do this you have liberty to do this you have freedom to do this all these things are lawful and you can do them well don't always just think about how you can satisfy your flesh and make yourself feel good but by love serve one another he says for if this is paul writing for all the laws fulfilled in one word even this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself this is the very crux of the parable the good samaritan it's at the very heart of even what uh what's being said to uh to the rich young ruler love thy neighbor as thyself it's the very heart of these things it's at the very core of how the uh of of how christ is wanting us to act and behave as christians love thy neighbor as thyself then notice what verse 15 says but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another this stands in stark contrast and direct uh polar opposite to don't use your liberty as an occasion to satisfy your flesh but serve one another because all of the laws fulfilled in this commandment thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself see says but if you bite and devour one another if you're not serving one another you're not helping one another take heed that you not be consumed one of another when you bite and devour somebody else you're you're being consumed but serve love one another i said i want to close with this statement we read a portion of it in the beginning on that day on calvary remember i'm talking about the sin question is settled you're perfectly sinless then once we're in that condition he gives you his spirit to follow him and to do as he did he was a perfect man and he was made an example for you he says now what must be we do he said he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for others excuse me he did not live for himself he lived for others he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others now i'm picking up where i stopped earlier someone said how can you stand and let anyone call you such bad names you don't live for yourself listen to what this answers to there's answers to so many questions sometimes we have in our lives and so many difficult things that we go through it really speaks to it that living for others is the answer go and do thou likewise and this is how you do and you shall live this is really the way to live to have this kind of attitude where even the samaritan did not look at this one from jerusalem like oh that's my sworn enemy but he he reached out to help him he says you don't live for yourself someone calls you bad names what's my resolution brother brandon what do i do if someone's calling me bad names how do i overcome it you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man the very one calling you names not the one who's not calling you names i've got a list here of everyone who's called me names and if you're on it i'm not praying for you no it that's the one he says you want to redeem then he comes to the very heart you become sons and daughters you're a child of god if we could put that before you and the trouble of it is that the church has forgot their sons you are sons you are taking christ's place you are sons so as we mentioned last week to to have this attitude where you can love others and do good to others and do good all men is not a position of weakness but it's a position of strength it's when you feel that your behavior to others will give the wrong signal or compromise your testimony in that oh he must not really be strong because he's serving them or he's doing this then he must have this when you can get it out of your head that those that being good to others is a sign of weakness when you're afraid that reaching out is going to send the wrong signal and you have confidence i'm a son of god and being kind to somebody is not going to change that then you can overcome the human mechanisms that cause us to stiff-arm people sometimes to separate to distance to cut off to not have fellowship and he's bringing it to a position of strength we're able to fellowship we're able to help we're able to aid we're able to pray we're able to be kind and not say a negative thing not because we're weak and unsure in our experience but because we're strong and we're certain of our experience the criticisms of others is often born from insecurity and complex you don't criticize because you got it all figured out you criticized because you're afraid you don't have it all figured out and i'm afraid he might know more to me so i better i better get get i got better get the word out first that that guy's an idiot and everything he says doesn't make sense so as soon as he starts talking crazy instead of saying you know what what what would you have to say brother go ahead share we can we can learn from each other right none of us has al the complete picture brother lonnie jenkins used to teach something it was it's very profound it's repeated often amongst my circle of fellowship with ministers is not no he said not one message minister has the entire picture there's not one message preacher that's got it all figured out and can turn over every angle and show all of them to you we need each other as ministers as as servants whatever we may be we all need each other for the picture to come out right because not one person has a perfect interpretation of it he says you're taking christ's place you are sons so don't live for yourself live for others it's a position of strength well brother branham i can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it are you listening everybody awake live for that man who hates you live for that person who would kill you if they could that's what they'd done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them is that not the very message on the day of pentecost you with wicked hands have crucified the lord of glory he didn't say everyone here who called for the crucifixion of christ step out because you're not included he included the very ones who crucified the lord of glory and he was saying you are the ones he died for christ who gave of himself was self-sacrificial in shedding his own blood for those who yelled for his blood he said should we not do likewise live for the man that hates you live for that person who would kill you that's what they did to him they killed him he died that he might save them that's eternal life when that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then i i will acknowledge i will admit that there's a human side to us that finds it very very very difficult that our instinct when we have been harmed is justice that what we crave many times when there's hurts or offenses or somebody hates you or would kill you if they want to you'd want to be on the phone hey 9-1-1 there's a guy who wants to kill me here and that's how you would want to address this situation but brother i said no you live for the man that wants to kill you if he could you live for the man that would want to hate you it's contrary to your human nature but let me encourage you it's right in harmony with the nature of christ which you have received none of you are beneath this or none of you are above this this is all within your capacity this is in your wheelhouse you can do this you are sons you are daughters you are able to love those who hate you you are able to pray for that man who would want to kill you if you could you're able to love the man that hates you not just the ones that are good and nice to you can we all admit that's difficult but can we also accept upon the same basis that through christ i can do this when that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then he says you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives its wool you look on towards calvary that's what we're looking at church we're looking at a sacrifice we're looking at our position in christ and it gives us a perspective of others who are hurt who are downtrodden who weak who differ who disagree and we can call him brother we can call him sister not because they agree with everything we say but we believe in a god who has the capacity to redeem the lowest and we believe in election we believe in predestination so i don't need to know that a brother lines up with everything i doctrinally believe to be able to call him brother i believe that he can see truth and i would want him to believe that i could see truth that if i didn't see it like he did he could still call me brother not because he's weak but he believes that i can also come to truth and we're not excluding anybody we're not keeping anybody out but from a position of strength we are his sons we are his daughters we are the greatest designation that can be placed upon a church the bride of jesus christ therefore we have the capacity we have the depth to live for others let's stand tonight i know the word is challenging brother tom had mentioned a song that he might have wanted to sing the love of god in the key of sea would work maybe just to sing it together tonight the love of god that's what i want should have brought in my heart that's what i want to live by i want to live by the love that he had for me have you been challenged by the word tonight let's just bow our heads and each one of you just pray individually to him asking god for his help we're asking the question who is my neighbor tonight we looked at how the question to start the whole conversation was what shall i do to inherit eternal life and what transpired was a conversation that brought us right down to the heart of eternal life what is it living for others that's my prayer tonight maybe you could make it yours lord i want to live for others i want the love of god to be shed abroad in my heart for others let us pray our gracious heavenly father lord as we've edged on in the evening it's getting late lord even some tonight we're not able to make it because they work late so father those those who have an early morning and we have demands upon our time and even things being beginning to creep into our thought process related to the demands of life lord we pause even right now we say lord we love you we thank you for your goodness towards us father we're so appreciative of the clarity of the bible and the strength of this message joined together with it that speaks to us in areas that might seem to be ecumenical in ways that might seem to be denominational in ways that might not even seem to be in line with what we think the message of the hour really promotes but lord we can from a position of strength do good to all men we can lord from position of strength love our neighbor as ourselves lord this isn't weakness it's not a sign that we haven't met you it's not a sign that we don't have truth but lord because we have truth we can do this and father i desire that you could break any chains that bind us tear down any walls that separate us lord i ask right now that you can loose this nature of christ that's within us by the baptism of the holy ghost to be able to reach beyond fear reach beyond complex reeks beyond anxiety reach beyond history and to love one another lord we know how difficult it is when we have been hurt when we've been aggrieved when we've been wounded when we scarred we've been mistreated we know how hard it is to reach out to others even if they're not the one lord we know even how much more difficult it is when there's something that resembles that looks like that very hard to reach out but lord if we could for a moment think maybe that samaritan was called some choice words by a jew maybe that samaritan was called a dog maybe that samaritan was reminded on a daily basis that he has no heir no inheritance in god but when he saw a man broken and wounded and hurt him who may have represented all the scars and wounds that he endured he was bullied with something in him reached out and though it's a parable lord we learn a great lesson that we ourselves have no excuse help us to be bearers of your nature lord help us to live the life that's befitting of the name christian and i pray lord tonight that if there be any who do not have eternal life may they seek it with all their heart through repentance and water baptism through the seal of god we lord who have received such a precious promise in this hour may this love be loosed lord may it no longer be restrained but father may you moderate it may you govern it we don't want to take our human understanding and grab a hold of love lord we'll make a mess of it again the lord may your love live out freely not with our own ambition not with our own ideals not with our own understanding but lord let it live out freely we can express you in your nature commit the people to you tonight desiring that you would touch them lord in the name of lord jesus christ we pray amen amen let's just worship the lord for a few moments before you're dismissed
