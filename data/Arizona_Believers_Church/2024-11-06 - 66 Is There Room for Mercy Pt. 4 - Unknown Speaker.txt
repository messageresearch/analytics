TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh Daniel 7:1 in the first year Abel shazar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters Daniel spake and said I saw in my vision by night and behold the Four Winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another so this is his vision of of the four Great beasts the first was like a lion and had an eagle's wings had eel's wings and I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made stand upon the feet as a man and man's heart was given to it behold another Beast a second like to a bear and it raised up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arise devour much flesh after this I beheld and L another like a leopard which had upon the back of its four wings of a foul the Beast had also four heads and Dominion was given to it so there's a representation of the four Beast he says after this I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth Beast Dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and had great iron teeth it devoured and it break in pieces and stamped the residue at the feet of it and it was diverse from all the Beast that were from before it and it had 10 horns I considered the horns and behold there came up among them another little horn before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man and mouth speaking great things so there's uh a lot of symbols a whole lot of symbols and and when you see artistic renderings of it it's a very unique uh representation of these things he's seeing now he says I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancients of days the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him and thousands thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake I beheld even till the Beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the Burning Flame as concerning the rest of the Beast they had their Dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time so you can see that there's events that are transpiring not just a single instance but there's a lot of things transpiring and again he says I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancients of days Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body and the visions of of my head troubled me I came near unto one of them that stood by and asked him the truth of all this so he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things amen God bless you you can take your seats tonight I know there's a lot there in this scripture reading in the Book of Daniel and these visions that he had there's a lot of teaching in the message of the hour on these things a lot of lot of uh images that I want to use tonight as we speak on the house of the Lord and is there room for Mercy using this question as their room for Mercy H to you know explore that in a time of judgment which I'm trying to show you by the word of God that there's this aspect of judgment that uh Shadows or or you know is kind of hovering over us in this time that we're living in now and in this time of judgment can there still be mercy and uh if there is Mercy how and what does it look like and what is where is this Mercy to be found today because there's an image that we could look at in scripture to see that certainly there does come a time where all that is left is judgment and a sentence is going to be pronounced and the question would be does that mean all flesh is condemned and there's no chance and there's no way and maybe we could say there is a time when there will be no flesh uh none saved left on the face of the Earth and those that would receive eternal life will have to be granted that at White Throne judgment and so we see these times in Scripture that definitely speak of a terrible time uh for those that don't believe and I'm using the phrase room or the term room in this question this phrase of is there room for mercy and not just is there Mercy in this age but is there Mercy in our hearts and in our homes not just is there Mercy available for The Sinner but are we merciful is there is there room for Mercy Even in our attitudes I'm just going to jump in where we were on Sunday and say that the age of the son of man being revealed as we see in Luke chapter 17 as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot that when the son of man is revealed we see that there is a change from the Throne of Mercy to a throne of judgment and in Revelations 5:5 now this is if you've listened to Sunday mornings if you were here we see that we were looking at um some very specific instances and so now we want to continue on this just to see what brother Brandon was looking at when he dealt with this subject of Mercy and it says in Revelations 5:5 and one of the elders saith unto me weep not because John was weeping because there was a sealed book that no man was able to look upon or loose the seals thereof and as he's weeping one says don't cry Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof it is this event that brother brandham looks at uh to characterize as a change of change from Mercy to judgment this moment when the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David which is Christ prevailed or comes to this moment where he goes to the father where the book is resting the sealed book is and he opens those seals and it's this very scene uh that brother brandham says is a change from Mercy to judgment so the opening this is a judgment scene because in the opening of the book there's a lot in this in the open of the book there's a sentence to be made there's conclusions there's finality there's judgment even as John weeping we could say in many ways was tied to the fact that that book contained his absolute Vindication and justification that there was some pronouncement that would be made in that book that would seal up and Grant forever and convey uh his inheritance so it's a very important scene that we see here in Revelations 5 and as it describes the line of the tribe Judah the root of David and this coming to take the book if we look in Daniel chapter 7 we're going to see a similar instance in scripture because in Revelations 5 the son Christ goes to him who sits on the throne and he takes the book and he opens the seals and that's the Christ coming to the father coming to God on the throne and it says I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him so here is the son of man which is Christ coming to the father on his throne because it says he came to to the Ancient of Days one like the son of man came with the clouds and came to the Ancient of Days so here we see an image of Christ coming to the father on his throne and in verse n it tells us who the Ancient of Days is or describes him in a particular way and it says I behold I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire the fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open as we see one whose garment is white as snow his hair is as pure wool there's this fiery flame and these wheels of fire this fiery stream issuing forth is to convey one with wisdom the Ancient of Days and here is a judgment Throne this is a time of judgment and it's a picture that he is looking at and that's described in these several verses we're looking at even to verse 13 and verses 9 and 10 it's a picture which is conveying this a lot of meaning and a lot of events over a time period because as we read later he says that as I'm beholding this this happened to this these beast and this happened to that beast and so there's a lot of things that are transpiring that this image is conveying and in verse 14 this one which is like the son of man that comes to the Ancient of Days the Ancient of Days has a garment white as snow as his head is like pure wool the throne is like a flaming fire judgment is set now the son of man comes at with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days in verse 14 and there was given him this is the son of the one like the son of man given him dominion and glory and Kingdom that all people Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away in his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed here we see a time in which the father is committing now the Judgment of this Throne the power this fierceness this tempu isness about this Throne the father's committing judgment to the son of man in a special time I say special just a unique specific time period where this this one like of the son of man comes to the Ancient of Days and the Ancient of Days is now conveying in giving dominion and glory and a kingdom and everlasting Dominion to the son of man and there's this uh this we could even say this as we read later that even the son of man is likened to the Ancient of Days or refers to Ancient of Days and it's not the father but it's now all invested in the son so in Revelations 1: 13-6 we see another phrase that's very similar to this as far as one like the son of man coming in the Clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and so here we see the son coming to the father on the throne and the Ancient of Days has a garment wi as snow AE like pure wool and fiery Flames around him and he gives Dominion to the sun now John sees this in verse 13 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man and notice how he's dressed clothed with the Garment down to the foot and G about the PS with the golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice is the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength each one of these phrases to describe the son of man from the clothing of His Garment down to his feet and G about in the PS with a golden girdle these are all symbols to convey meaning and to give us uh some sense of the son of man at this time what he's doing and as it says in John 5:22 for the son the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son we see now that as the son of man is one like un the son of man in Daniel which is Christ he goes to the father who is the Ancient of Days and who has this image and this disposition of a judge and the father gives dominion and glory and a kingdom to Christ now we see him in Revelations one one the son of man and now he is in this image because the father has committed all judgment unto the son and brother brandham goes through this when he preaches the Revelation series and it's spelled out very well in the church age book I believe it's chapter 2 in the patmas vision you'll find these things explicitly laid out and as I quote here for the next few moments I'll be quoting from those paragraphs but the white hair signifies that he's judge of all the Earth and he's been crowned with wisdom that the white hair is a crowning it's a it's a demonstration or an uh it exist ibits and presents that it's the crown of wisdom on one who has discernment and and judgment so he has he signifies that he's judge of all the Earth he's been crowned with wisdom brother bam said they saw the judge with his judgment girdle over his shoulders standing pure and holy full of wisdom fully qualified to judge the world in righteousness so that's what this hair white as wool represents and then these eyes as were flames of fire this is the eyes of the judge who repays those who reject him so when it expresses this flaming fire there is a judgment for those who reject him and he says there he stands as judge with flaming eyes to meet out judgment the day of Mercy is over now this is Brother Bram describing this in Revelations chapter 1 so immediately we start thinking whoa where's our chronology here but there's something to be expressed that is this one who is in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks which is Christ in the midst of his church through seven Church ages looking out over his church and caring for him there's this this image when John is caught up in the day of the Lord uh in the spirit of the Lord's day that he's seeing things that will be and this image convey something and so then there's almost this dropping back to hear about the church ages in Chapter 2 and chapter 3 to almost come back to four and five which is going to be given us a full understanding of why he stands here now as this one with eyes of fire and this white hair with this judgment that is going forth he had feed of brass which signifies divine Judgment of sin and I think maybe Lord willing will pick up on this next Wednesday how that Brazen serpent uh and there was judgment for unbelief and how this lifting up of this brass serpent uh symbolized Christ himself being offered for sin and so brass can even represent sin judged and that there's something in this judgment for sin that if we could be identified with it then our sins are vanquished then it has as the voice his voice was the sound of many Waters it's the sound of many Witness es of the Christ it is the gospel it is the testimony of Christ and these voices will rise up in judgment Against The Sinner who did not heed this voice of warning so there's when we see think of the voice of many Waters it's Messengers represented it's preachers of the Gospel it's a testimony of Christ and now his voice is now rep all these voices are represented there as a testimony that the gospel was preached and had been rejected and so it's a voice of judgment these voices will be there to condemn those goes in judgment then Seven Stars in his hand we know Revelations 1:20 tells us the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and as brother bam writes about it these angels in his hand though they're Messengers to the church they represent examples of God's goodness or God's mercy and care to the body of Christ that how God was treating them in that age and how he used them it's it depicts every believer so all the candlesticks represents the me the messenger who is tapped into the Holy Spirit but brother says every believer is dramatically depicted there because we all must be tapped into that Holy Spirit and then the two-edged sword it's the word that judges the hearts it's the word that judges a man's works it's a word that judges a man's motives so it's not just external things but this two-edged sword it's that word of God Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edge sword doing what piercing even to the dividedness under Soul and Spirit and the joints and arrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so this is what the word does is it doesn't just judge outwardly it judge in judges inwardly it's going to judge your works it's going to judge your motives it's going to judge your thoughts and the way the how a man's heart was set so this as a word which is a two-edged sword then as there was a streams of fire that are issuing forth before him and these Wills of burning fire we see these things now this fire before him his eyes is flame of fire feet is brass a voice of many water Waters and uh and out of his mouth went a sharp twitch sword there's a lot of connections with the word that judges and then he says his fa countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength this is connected with his coming to take his bride away in a Rapture this is connected with a a specific time when he's revealed himself and manifested himself his countenance was as the son shineth in his strength Matthew chap 17: 1 and 2 and after 6 days Jesus Take taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light so here is this depiction of Christ at his Transfiguration where he is uh there it's an expression of the kingdom of God coming in power as there's going to be given dominion and glory and power and everlasting Dominion to the son of man that Christ at his Transfiguration wherein there was Moses that represent the sleeping Saints Elijah that represents the living Saints and there's this glorified Christ gathered together to this glorified Christ it's this image of him where his face shines as the sun in his reignment white as the light it's this look of the Ancient of Days whose garment was white as snow his hair like pure wool his throne like a flaming fire and fire issuing forth before him and now as we see these symbolisms and his face is as it were the Sun and we see this at his Transfiguration in Revelations 10: 1 to3 and I I do appreciate uh your attentiveness I love it that you're um you have an appetite for the word in teaching it makes one I enjoy a gift of teaching brother Jason dears has that uh Ministry of a Teaching Ministry and I just imagine if you're uh if if you're accustomed to other ways of speaking teaching maybe sometimes would get uncomfortable or dry but I just think it's so beautiful when the Holy Spirit could come and place things not me the Holy Spirit take things and place these things so thank you for being patient as I think these things are necessary to teach in Revelations 10: 1 2 and 3 notice he says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire some of the same depictions as feet like fine brass and his hair like white wool white as snow and these things are describing a particular image and here we see the same face as it were the sun his feet is pillars of fire he's clothed with the cloud now these are tremendous images for us as Believers because Revelations chapter 10 is a message scripture brother brandom taught us that the seventh angels on Earth at the time of this coming and we all should be like whoa wait what right we should all kind of say all right I want to understand this I I want to have an understanding of these things and he says and he had in his hand a little book open now if we see the son of man coming to the father on the throne who has a book and this book is now open he opens this book and now we see Christ this Mighty angel with a book open and he had in his hand a little book and he opened and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices when the lion roars who can but respond when this lion prophesies and and and he utters forth then these these seven Thunders utter their voices it's the same one here Christ in Revelations 1 it's the same one in Revelations 5 the line of the tribe of Judah and Daniel one Daniel 7 these are all they have the same characteristics now if we were to say wait a minute wait a minute these are different times okay we won't argue that but you see the same characteristics of the same one I should tell us something brother brandham says this about this scene where we see this one like the son of man he said his service has been rendered Revelations 1 this is his conclusion the priesthood is over the days of the prophecy are finished he stands gerded as the judge Revelations 1 describes him in terms that should tell us it's judgment and so here in Revelations 10 when he Roars as a lion it's because he is the the lion of the tribe of Judah he is the root of David and these and now as he's roaring as a lion he's standing there girded as a judge his white wool it speaks of supreme authority and judge all these things are are painting this picture the symbolic picture of something about his character at this time and these representations I believe are very important to reveal his purpose at that moment what he is his office at that moment and his character the Bible says that the line of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed and in this prevailing now this line of the tribe of Judah is going to cry out and Roars as a lion he has a purpose he has an office he has a character at this moment and this Lion of the tribe of Judah we can see in Genesis CH 49 veres 8 9 and 10 it says Judah now as this uh inheritance and blessing is being passed we've seen recently how that Reuben has been disinherited and this part of the Kingdom part of the inheritance is given to Judah Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee there's this expression now of dominion it's being expressed in Judah it says Judah is a lion's welp so here's the lion of the tribe of Judah and he's a lion's welp which kind of suggests this youthfulness but then it says from the prey my son Thou Art gone up so it's alluding to a Young Lion growing up into full strength growing up in full power there's this emblem of royalty emblem of a king from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion from a lion's welp to an old lion who shall Rouse him up this lion who after he has conquered and after he has accomplished what he what he must he can now sit down he can now rest it says the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be scepter signifies dominion and power and authority so here this royal king who's viewed the lion of the tribe of Judah speaks of the Messiah these prophecies it's kingly power kingly government we know that Christ is the lion of the tribe of Judah having conquered even sin and death he ascends up on high and sits down at the right hand of the Father in heaven and it's King Jesus which is Christ that goes now to the father to take the book of redemption and when he does it's the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to take the book and so the symbolism is pointing to a change that's taking place and when brother Brandon was looking at these events when he preaches Serv is this the time when he's preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ and even when he comes to the open of seals it's when he's looking at these things what does he saying is this the end and is Mercy over why because there's a a certain characterization of Christ in this moment and in this time which speaks of judgment the lion it's not uh a judgment of sin but now it's the Judgment of Sinners it's not paying the price and God's Wrath being satisfied in Christ but now it looks as if those who've rejected him are now going to be permanently judged so listen to these statements I know you're extremely familiar with them uh you're doing such a good job of just pulling me so quick I I'm realizing I uh might sell youself sell you guys short tonight and not preach very long or to some I might be doing you a huge favor I don't know but in the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals listen to what brother brandham says now I want to read this so that you can hear how brother bam describes it what he's looking at and my desire isn't to say well he says this yeah but I'm not wanting to put any interpretation of it other than just to say this is what he said and let's just accept it that there's something in what he's seeing that he's conveying to us that God can give us understanding of amen he says he leaves the throne uh to be an intercessor as a lamb he's saying that he's leaving this place of being an intercessor he leaves the throne to be a lion king to bring the world to judgment who has rejected his message so it's once there's a rejection there's nothing left but judgment so he says he's not a mediator this is interesting now um I was studying as a part of this in intercession and Med mediator and propit those things that relate to this Mercy or this office of him being a mediator being an intercessor and this place that he has during this particular time where he's interceding and he's mediating but now he's saying that's over so if you want to pray about those things and look into those things and read those different scriptures there's a lot there to consider so now he's not a mediator so here came the lamb now now and I'm skipping some things just wanting to describe this view he has of this lamb coming to him on the this Lion King coming to take the book so here came the lamb now his intercessory days were over the mediatorial days they say ah there was a time when he was a lamb and he was a mediator and he was an intercessor but he's saying these things are over he describes it this way in the breach he says the Elder called him and said a lion because he had been a lamb an intercessor a bloody lamb but now he's coming forth as a lion his days of intercession are over yes the there's this repetition gets in our minds that brother brandham isn't just stumbling over his words he's seeing an event scripture and he sees some change of office from this time where he's mediating interceding to now there's a lion and it's not that he's mediating or interceding but now he's doing something different he says and again just a little bit later and the lamb come forth now from being a mediator between God and man you know the scriptural references to that he becomes a lion when he becomes a lion he takes the books takes the book that's his rights he was taking his rats it was his time to take the book and is are his rights and he's claiming all uh that belong to him brother B says why is he taking the book why is he opening seals he wants to gather his subjects so the open of the book is gathering the third poll is absolutely for the lost and for the bride so there's things combined in this moment that are it's the most glorious beautiful day there's ever been because the word is open and it's drawing the bride to Christ but what about everyone else who's not drawn it's a terrible day A Dark Day so in the fourth seal some of the same instances and I'm just doing this chronologically he says while I believe with all my heart the seat's still open I believe he's still on the throne of God but soon he's going to rise now and come forth to claim what he has redeemed now the breach it's kind of anticipatory he's looking forward to the events that would be and he's looking at scripture he's looking at the symbolism he's drawing these conclusions of he's using the symbols to set the scene now as he's preached the fourth seal he says I believe that the throne he's still on the throne of God and that but he's going to rise and claim what he's redeemed he's doing the work of kinsman while Ruth is waiting but soon we know that Ruth after he had promised her I will not rest until or ex actually Naomi this says he will not restle he's performed what he's promised and as she is there conversing with Naomi Ruth is Boaz goes before the Elders of the city and he does this claiming of Ruth he wants Ruth and he he does this act of a Kinsman and he says but soon you know after boas had done the Kinsman work then he come and claimed his possessions that's exactly what the Bible said he done this is Christ now what he does in Revelations 5 he come forth and took the book then intercession is over he's off the throne there's no more Blood On The Mercy Seat then what is it judgment seat so where he had been once he moves from that what he's vacated it's it's not what it was before so I do think it's important to look at in the sense that he was in he was doing something and when it says the blood is now off of that it's that something's changed something's moved we have to use language and time and space to convey ideas because we exist in time and space and we use language to communicate now if we could all just be God we would see it for exactly what it is and we wouldn't even need to communicate it we'd just be like and church service would be like we would just all know perfectly but since we have to describe it there's something in there that we want the thoughts of God to be quickened to see it how he sees it he says so what is it now it's judgment seat and then in the fifth seal says this the very next evening I'm sure that you're the same he's praying so catch this I'm sure you're the very same Lord Jesus that made the atonement for us many years ago I think that's an important element you're the same that when it said the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed brother Bram saying well he was a lamb and now he's a lion and it's this he's he's drawing us through this process where it's not like well I your your lawyer quit so now you have a new public defender and bad luck he's the judge and there's this weird rule where the one who should be representing you is now the one that's condemning you and sentence in you and it's not a different person in that way said I'm sure you're the very same Lord Jesus that made the atonement for us many years ago and by seeing those seals revealed and the great things that's taken place right here in the last few years I believe with all my heart that the door of Mercy is beginning to close just one night later if we go back to the 17th when he's preaching he says well soon this is going to happen and then he comes on the 21st he says soon he's going to rise I believe he's still on the throne but soon this is going to happen but soon but now he's saying I believe it is closing it's beginning to close and you're ready to take your journey now to redeem your people very next night on the in the six the hour is soon arriving and maybe yet this very night so he's not looking at in the same way that we might look in the scripture and read something that's symbolic and be like this is going to be a time when the son of man is judging and this is what it will be one day and this is the symbolisms but God is actually interpreting his word by bringing it to pass and brother bam sees things happen he says this is what will happen and now he's saying I believe it's already beginning to happen and now he says they arriving that there's an hour arriving I know I haven't finished the sentence but he says it may be this very night that God will completely turn from the Gentiles altogether now do you understand better okay I apologize that's maybe assuming that you didn't understand it as good as you do now before but on Sunday when we went through souls in prison now we make the connection that this is what brother Bam's thinking about when he preaches souls in prison now like when this happened I thought for sure we'd be gone but since we're still here maybe you've turned from the Gentiles altogether and the part of the third pull is a testimony and a witness to those who are going to be judged and can't be saved and that's why we're still here you pick up on that and this is why because he says I think it could happen tonight that you're not going to save anymore you're no longer going to deal with the Gentiles but you'll leave but later he says but maybe you've left the Gentile bride here to be a condemnation to all those who rejected you he said so they shall tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem until the Gentiles dispensation be finished the times are over and then let him that's filthy stay filthy let him that's righteous be righteous there's no more blood on the altar the sacrifice has been removed and there's nothing but smoke and lightning and judgment in there and that's just exactly what's poured out here tonight now you could look at this and say that this is what's poured out in the symbols of the sick seal that he's preaching but then you could also see where brother Bam's talking about the events under the six seal and he's talking about current events that are transpiring as as if to see that there's already been some temporary manifestation of those things under the Sixth Seal am already taking place in transpiring he said the that's exactly what's poured out tonight he said the our soon arriving that these things may happen he says it may be tonight the lamb has left his mediatorial work the mediatorial work has been finished from over on the throne and the sacrifice says we've typed him perfectly the kinsman redeemer the bloody lamb that come forth the lamb that had been slain a bloody one been killed bruised come forth and took the book out of his hands the days are finished now he's coming to claim what he has redeemed uh I I now to you as you read that as you hear that you could take that in the same way that John observes it in symbol in symbol form and that he comes to take the book and that there's going to be a day when he does and as you read this here you could take it to mean that brother brandham is saying that one day he will and when he does mediation is over time is finished he's come to claim and I would say that in these things you want God to reveal it to you you don't want to make any assumptions we don't want to just take something run run through the concordance or match words up and meanings and definitions and then just say I it every every place where it says that day we just say when brother man said that day is this day and then everywhere we find in the the scripture where it says that day we're like that was today and you're like well no I think that day was saying that day and and we can't just do that uh absolutely so there is a there's a risk at that even as a minister as you start to look at things that you could just start pulling every instance where you see clouds in the sun of man and say it all pertains to one but there's different times and dispensations of the same one and as he says this about these things I want you to consider them and think that if there's going to be a time when there's no more Blood On The Altar and the hour has arrived of this happening and as he sees the consequence of this happening and you see that several months later in November this year he's saying we're still here and his languages telling us that these things have happened but were not gone yeah so could it be that judgment is already pouring forth and people can't get saved right right because these events had happen and there's no more Mercy now he says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed which I would argue as a brother that this is the silence that is lifting off of that seventh seal and this is brother bradam just feeling that Liberty to say this is what's transpiring right now under the opening of this word he says now you see the seals I know there's so much I'm skipping over he says when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get his book this book that he's redeeming redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and you want to get your they them into Scruples she is him and brother brandom says this and Christ is the mystery God revealed continue he says now so there he says that when this moment happens he comes he takes the book he was redeeming back there he was doing the mediator work there but when he comes forward to take the book all that is in the book is him and and it's going to be this Union there's going to be this headship this preeminence in the most moment in this time he says now to the life in the body is ofended the Life coming to the body this Union taking place it's a Vindication that the Rapture is at hand when you see the headship and the body becoming one in the fullness of the measure of his manifestation it shows that the body is about ready to receive to the headship and he has begin to give life to his body the one that he has redeemed the mediatorial work is over he's bringing his life to the body in the Vindication for the Rapture amen quite a statement to say the mediatorial work is over when you look at it in that this is about four months after he has made these statements and the breach and the fourth seal the fifth Seal The Sixth Seal I'm just picking different places to use this and now four months later he's saying the mediator work is done he's bringing life to the body in Vindication of the Rapture and then you find four months later he's saying could it be could it be that the door is shut why is he saying that because of these things that he sees taking place in scripture because of these things that transpire under the word of opening of the word when the Seven Seals were opened and they are and all seven seals are open to them that can receive it something happens with mercy and judgment and the question is is there no more intercession is the mediat toil work over completely is there no more Mercy is there no more salvation and maybe some of you know people that are very fervent Believers in the message of the hour very fervent Believers in that God had Vindicated brother brandham to be a prophet he's the prophet of Malachi 4 and that these very events have transpired and they hold very deeply in their hearts that in 1963 after brother Bon preached the seals nobody can be saved other words they've condemned even their own children in some cases themselves and they've kind of adopted this Theology of some nominal Christianity that says well you can't be the 144,000 but maybe you can be there can you can get in another way and it's it's a perversion of of already perverted Doctrine and yet they believe the door has been shut and when they say when we say they believe the door has been shut they're not just inventing this but they're using these very things that brother brand said so I say God help us to understand who Christ is at this critical moment in scripture yes amen even to say that if in your heart you don't believe that he has taken the book in your heart you do not believe that the book is opened and he has come down fulfilling Revelations 10:1 if you believe there's yet other things to be fulfilled I do believe brother Brandon has connected these things to his ministry connected them to events that are transpiring while he was here on Earth and he was trying to convey to us something about it so that if you don't quite see these things have happened maybe you could still yet see who he is at this moment in scripture in Revelations 55 Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to take the book The Lion of the tribe of Judah one who is the son of man hair white as wool and his garments like white and the feet of brass all these images of judgment and so we take to heart this scene that as the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed it says in verse six and I beheld so John is now looking he's told the king the judge the right righteous one the supreme authority to whom all judgment has now been committed to the Sun the day of Mercy is over all this judgment and in the midst of the throne and of the four beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne the significance of this symbolism in this event must not be understated the sublime act in scripture because John is told that the judge has prevailed to take the book and John looked to see the judge he looked to sup see the supreme authority he looked maybe to see him as he's described in Revelations 1 he looked to see him as a Daniel Psalm in Daniel 7 he looked to see him in this Vis of an angry judge but what he sees is a bloody lamb this bloody lamb is the one that's seen in Acts 17:56 and said behold I see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of God where had Christ been where did he Ascend up he ascended up to the right hand of the Majesty on high as a bloody lamb as the one who laid down his life to be an intercessor to be a mediator Christ had ascended up to be what The Mercy Seat Paul even says he's been set forth to be a perpetuation which is the literally the word is The Mercy Seat and so now I want you to catch this image John says it's here don't don't cry John and and even who is Worthy is this pronouncement this this this calling p in Forth of the worthy one a summoning of the one who's ascended up to the right hand of the Majesty on high and the one who who has the rights the one who laid down his life this lamb who purchased Redemption is the same one who has the rights to claim it and now it says be weep not John Don't Cry Anymore the lion the judge the supreme authority the wigged one has prevailed to take the book and as he looks to see a king the son of man who had been at the right hand of the father this bloody lamb has now not changed his garments has now not necessarily changed his vises and put on a crown and cleaned himself up and looks all Royal but John looks and he sees a bloody lamb approaching the throne what is it that he sees he actually sees The Mercy Seat moving please catch this party he actually sees The Mercy Seat rising up here he was Christ The Mercy Seat as long as he was here The Mercy Seat was here he could intercede he can mediate he he had an office here but now when he gets up he's not so much vacating The Mercy Seat as much as Mercy's moving and now as The Mercy Seat Rises up he moves to the father and he takes the book amen and the lion of the tribe of Judah is still seen as the bleeding lamb so what is he he still The Mercy Seat the righteous judge the Supreme Authority is there now taking the book but what was he he was still has the character of a lamb sir and brother Bron makes this statement in the ark and we could find many instances where he says something very similar to this this one just struck me in a very special way last week he says and today men are stricken blind because they are rejecting God mercy and I didn't take time to listen to it but it struck me this way you could say today men are strick and blind because they're rejecting God Mercy but God Mercy I want you to think about this God is rich in Mercy amen amen the Ancient of Days Go in the scripture and find some of the essential attributes of God and you'll find that Mercy is so frequently attributed to God and God never changes his ways or changes his nature they reject God who is Mercy is what I'll put it that way that only leaves judgment left but God in his love and mercy has so appropriated a way that before Divine judgment ever strikes there is a way God makes a way of Escape for all those who desire to follow that way that's the mercies of him making a way of Escape so even when judgment is imminent even if a door begins to close God is still pointing out a way even if the time of judgment is coming God is still saying hey before it's completely over I want you to know there is a way before it's completely finished you can't say I didn't tell you amen and here is God's way his love and his mercy God who is Mercy will not send judgment before he has extended Mercy amen take some time over the next few weeks if we don't have time to get to it ourselves to mention this but notice how that after the seals are open notice the theme of judgment right in the sermons that brother Brandon preaches he could have never preached the indictment right and after he preaches the indictment he preaches the trial what is he showing us warning than judgment it goes to the whole process and it lays it all out this is the time that we're in we're in the time of an indictment and we're in the time of a trial we're in a time of a sentencing to go forth and now your mind is the jury you've got to make your decision not you want to reject the Ark in this hour you want to reject God's provided way and listen to this as he says and hear ye him and I want you to think about Christ this lamb this one God wanted to bless his children and he couldn't do it under the law neither could he under judgment and Justice now if we were to look at it as the law being judgment and the law being justice but even judgment and Justice is being these attributes of his eternal throne says God couldn't bless his children under the law he cannot bless us under Justice or judgment because if we get what we deserve he says but the only way he could do it was under the love of his son Christ Jesus and he brings us right to the adoption right to the Transfiguration this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him he says what is it all law is finished yes amen all the judgments are finished this special dispensation this time this hymn shining in the bright of his glory his face is it were the sun here's the Sun and he looks to be the lawgiver he looks to be the judge but in him all law is finished in him all judgment is finished this is my beloved Son hear you him all other things are done this is him amen so I want you to think that in him all things are finished and we can say at this moment when this happens when he begins to rise from this box he begins to rise from this place and Mercy's over as it was exhibited here and he takes his place before the father to take the book it's Christ in whom all judgment is finished yes sir in Christ who is the end of all these things and so what is John told in Revelations chap 10:8 this time of judgment his feet as pillars of fire his face as it were the sun this wigged Authority The Voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth go to him who is the judge for he is the bloody lamb in whom judgment is finished go to him who has the book because he is the bloody lamb wherein there is Mercy amen yes some may differ and disagree with how that I'm expressing it tonight that perhaps the day of Mercy is over in their own hearts and their own minds that there is no mercy so may express it this way that none of these events have actually happened there only been the symbols have been explained to us and described to us and one day it will actually happen in literal form and at that time these things will be absolutely true but I want it to express to you this way that where Christ is revealing himself he reveal he reveals himself in this time in scripture as the righteous judge and therefore you have to be in him yes amen because he's not here he's not here saying H well you know he's not here standing between but now he's gone to the father to get the sentence he gone to the father to get the get the judgment and so the only place you can find anymore is in him that's the only place there is Mercy let's stand and bow our heads Brothers you could come to your instruments our gracious heavenly father as we close this service having looked at these scriptures tonight and these statements that you've inspired your Prophet to share I believe that it would be natural as sincere Christians to wrestle with these things but not to twist them and rest them as Peter said people did of Paul's words but to try to place them and figure these things out and I pray father that you would give us an understanding that these things that were written in scripture were expressed symbolically and that Lord even brother brandom as a prophet would speak and prophesy and describe things that were still yet in symbolic form for things that are yet to be fulfilled and that you one day will fulfill your word and interpret it by bringing it to pass and then it will be understood that this is what was meant when he said this but father I pray but for those things which you have been bringing to pass or that have been brought to pass open our eyes that we may see you for who you are and Lord wouldn't it be wonderful for those that are lost and those that are groping in sin and living in air and not lining up with your word it would be wonderful for them if we were living in a day when there was just partial light and partial truth so there stood the lamb before the Throne of the father as a buffer making intercession being a mediator Lord it that role of your son is a unique office because when he died on the cross he purchased our Salvation once was Final and he entered in before heaven and presented himself as that Bloody sacrifice the atonement The Mercy Seat and that's what purchases our Salvation it's upon that basis Lord that we believe and our sins are forgiven but yet in your grace and as expressed in these sacrifices and these ministrations in the Old Testament he there yet stands there as a mediator as an intercessor but then the day comes when that one who is the bloody lamb fulfills scripture going to take possession the scene changes and Lord we could say could it be in that moment is the atonement no longer effective is there no more salvation is there no more excuse if there's no mercy what is there no mercy for anymore but Lord I see that you're still healing therefore the atonement is still in effect I see that you're still granting the fruit of the spirit and you're moving in ways that only you can you're Pro in yourself to be the same yesterday today and forever therefore I believe Lord that you have not taken your spirit off the Earth that the day of Grace is not completely over if the doors begin to close and your spirit is beginning to lift off the face of the Earth we could say that it has not completely shut yet amen so there must be some access to Mercy in this hour to your grace and Lord I pray that we would be as your children we would be full of mercy and merciful Lord that our response to the time that we're living in would be to live a life by Mercy and [Music] Truth doing good to all men and exhibiting a great grace in a time of trouble Lord may that be where we are today right now even in the shadow of recent events Lord may we commit ourselves to be lives lived by Mercy and truth that we could exhibit a great grace in a time of trouble Lord I pray that it would be you that opens eyes to see you in your word in your promised word for the hour that we're living in now and see you for who you [Music] are that you would drive away a fear and doubt Lord that we could believe all the more for our loved ones who are on the fringes Lord if there be any that have rejected you with their mouth and by their actions Lord we say God forbid Lord keep the door open for just another moment that there would be those who seem to have spit on this message that they would wake up and see themselves for what they are and come to the father asking for forgiveness and been restored amen Lord I do not cry out for your judgments I cry out for your mercy oh God and may our hearts understand better where we live today and may we be merciful oh father so have mercy on us oh God have mercy we love you we ask all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord
