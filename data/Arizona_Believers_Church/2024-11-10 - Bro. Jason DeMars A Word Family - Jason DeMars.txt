TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so sons are to be in the family under preparation to find their life mission and to be a provider and a leader and a benefactor to a wife and to children so really by definition as Fathers as husbands we need to have this Vision within our heart we don't just we're not just having fun with our kids we're not just uh making sure they eat something and and get off to school but that it's our duty that we're preparing Sons right the the uh children of one's youth are like arrows in the quiver right so in other words we're aiming them for something we're aiming them for what God has for them we're teaching them how to find God's purpose for their life and at the same time we also know within a certain realm we can tell them exactly what God's purpose is for them now the journey is is different and the outworking of that is different but most people are not gifted to be Unix for the kingdom of heaven right there is a gift and Paul speaks about that but but most people are not in that in that spot if you are may God bless you and may you serve Christ with all your heart with singleness of Mind in that state to to to be a single person if that's your gift however most people don't have that gift and so we really understand that sons are need to be prepared for broad shoulders strength to carry a load to carry responsibility for a wife and for children they're not in preparation for being top five video game players in the world not everybody's Elon Musk I guess who can do all that and be the top to a top video game player really if you if you understand it most people most young men that dedicate their lives to playing a lot of video games end up in a PL in a place where they are feminized they become effeminate because it's trying to express masculinity in a perverted way in a virtual way and when you try to express it in a virtual way all that goes along with that is taking away true and genuine masculinity that God has designed for young men to be what should young men be doing they I'm just going to I'll just go for a second and then get back to my notes what should young men be doing they should be moving their bodies they should be outside getting dirty they should be learning how to work with their hands they should be taught they should be LED under a father who's showing them how to lead a family in other words if you have family devotions your sons should start as they get older leading helping lead family devotion so that when they come and become a father become a husband become a father and that that is the right order husband and then father um that it's not a mystery to them that they don't know I grew up and that's not the life that I had I didn't know anything about it and it took many me many years of studying and reading and finally coming to a place hey why aren't you doing family worship with your family oh people do that I didn't know and so the these things it shouldn't if they're if you're listening here and you're a man and you're a husband or a grandfather even it's not too late if you're a grandfather encourage and teach your family to do that to have a time of Family Worship together daughters are to be in the family under preparation to be a helper a child Bearer and a homemaker this should be the vision that we're implanting within our daughters not you're going to have a career go after this go after no that's not God's Vision that's not the scripture that's not what it's putting forward and so we're we we are how many believe we're living under the influence of the seven voices of the seven Thunders that have uttered their voices yes right and so that seventh seal is bringing together all the mysteries of the Bible that have been hidden right the word is being has been restored into our hearts into the hearts of every believer so that that is going to bring the restoration of the Oneness of the last Adam and the last Eve that doesn't fall so the bride actually becomes comes the perfect reflection of the vision that Christ has she becomes the manifested man she becomes the she is the the the the bride is the image and Glory of Christ so then let's let that trickle down a little bit and see that our families need to to to turn to this place where we are the reflection of that same thing of Christ and his bride am and so the restoration of the word didn't just come to so that we would have a great understanding of the right Doctrine but that our lives would literally become the reflection visible manifestation of Christ yes amen so the woman is the glory of the man and the man is the glory of God is that what the scripture says right so in other words man is a a reflection of the out ring of God's nature and attributes and then the woman she was taken out of a man the woman is a reflection of the nature and attributes of the man so if we translate that down into our own lives a man must have God's vision for himself and for his family when many times when we come to marriage the the end go for a for a young man the end goal is some young lady but we're setting our goal and our vision a lot lower than we are supposed to set it because if a woman is to reflect the is the vision of a man right because that's the type so she she is the glory of man he's the glory of God so he the man is then not supposed to reflect his own idea his own thoughts his own Vision but he reflects the vision that God has for him and when he reflects that then his wife is supposed to take that same vision and reflect that to the world and so when a man looks at it and says my whole life goal is the woman this becomes an idolatrous situation where he is actually putting her first before God right very good and so then if she is to reflect that same vision then what in the world is happening in the home but self centered idolatry so you have a you this is the world we live in a a woman who is self-centered focused on self and a man who's focused on only pleasing her not concerned about pleasing God not concerned about doing what is is glorifying to God but simply wants to make her happy and she then in turn wants herself to be happy we have a we have a recipe for total chaos total disaster and so first of all the headship is Flowing down who is who is the head of the man not himself Christ is who is the head of Christ God who is the head of the woman the man so the man is not to reflect himself he is to understand what Christ is speaking to him and then that is how he needs to lead his family you're not there to do your own will what did Christ himself do not my will but thy will be done I've come not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me that has to be what every father every husband looks at the situation in his life as well that is what a Godly woman can get behind that's what she is going to appreciate reflecting to know that her husband's number one concern is doing the will of God and young ladies if you're looking for a husband this is should be your number one concern does this man fully surrendered to Christ not if his hair is nice not if he has a good smile not if he's popular but first and foremost he he needs to be reflecting Christ in his own life and that his greatest burden and his greatest concern is doing the will of him that sent him anything besides that is a disaster so we again we as the bride take the mind of Christ Christ doesn't take the mind of the Bride so must our wives take forth the Mind purpose vision of her husband and become a reflection of that so so men young men we should all have a clear picture of God's vision for us now this is we'll talk about this more and we'll lay we're lay the foundation but I can tell every one of you young men what God's purpose is for you you say how in the world can you do that because there's a general calling for every man that's created and it was told to Adam and it's for you too and I can tell every young woman this is what God has called you to right because it went to Eve and Paul clarified it and brother brandham brought brought us back to that original faith and so when when it comes down to specifically I can't tell if you're going to be a carpenter a preacher an engineer that's something only you and God can work out you know he's he's gifted each one of us differently and it's our goal to our our desire personally as individuals to understand what our gifting is and then use that for the glory of God and the furthering of the Kingdom brother brandham in the sermon doors Indo 1965 says I like a man of vision I like people that's got something they're fighting for just not just lay around well every what comes along will be all right oh be up and add it and Lincoln never let his education stand in the way he had something to do I think every Christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it every member of this chapter just not well we have a breakfast once a month that isn't it or once every Sun Saturday have a purpose in life something you're going to do God has placed you here do something about it every member of every Church there's a Revival in town that Revival is there for a purpose let's get something out of it let's do something about it all right in the sermon as the eagle stirreth up her nest 1957 Brothers you have that on the PowerPoint when I hear of a church that hasn't got any ambition to grow there's something wrong with that church the Church of the Living God has a high ambition and another thing the Church of the Living God is built high because it's got high anticipations and expectations say well we belong to the church Our Father served in the church years ago that might be fine but the Church of the Living God can't sit still its Ambitions is to go higher and further and and brother brandham skipping down says this Christian at his work is set on a hill his Ambitions is high to win his boss or somebody else to Christ that's right his expectation is high somewhere that God will give him a chance to speak to somebody amen so we should have each man should have God's vision and set his expectations High many times in life as an aside you get what you expect this isn't just in a church service this isn't just at special meetings but it's in your everyday life if you said it low you know I I'm not a lucky person I've heard people say that to me through over time I'm just not very lucky I don't I don't have many good things happen to me uh and it's like this is becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy is their life becomes ruined because everything is wo as me negative bad things happen to me no we set our Ambitions and expectations high and we keep them there no matter what comes our way right all right so looking at the importance of fathers the number one indicator of young people falling into a life of crime is that the home does not have a father in it so I think you could go on to the next screen uh keep going there we go so fatherless homes produce 63% this is in the United States 63% of used suicides 71% of high school dropouts 90% of all homeless and runaway youth 85% of all children who show behavior disorders 71% of all pregnant teenagers so the other part is when a father has a good connection with the heart of his children and is truly Walking with God statistics show that 90% of children remain faithful and continue in the faith without father's participation this percentage sinks to below 50% so when just a mother is Walking with God the chances are the children are not going to they're going to enter into the father's Vision what is the Father's Vision not to walk with God so a higher percentage is going to just say Dad isn't doing it even daughters daughters if you if you can understand it Sons and Daughters need a father to call them to maturity a mother's nature is not to call their children to maturity but to protect and guard and and nurture them that's that's how they built her if father doesn't call the children up to maturity they're going to stay immature and again if they're not if fathers aren't Walking with God the likelihood of those children not walking with God is is higher than if it if if he was so 1 Timothy 58 this always amazes me if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house he has denied the faith and is worse than an Infidel so it's it is very powerful because we realize that this is connected to a man's obedience so for for this doesn't say if any woman does not provide for her family she's denied the face and she's worse than in Infidel the the part it says about sisters is that she'll be saved in child birth or childbearing if she continues in faith and truth right and so for for man you could almost put it as he'll be saved in providing for his family if he continues in faith and truth right so why is Paul saying this this is basically a man who's refusing to be obedient to what God has called him to do he's essentially saying I don't I don't need to reflect Christ I can ju I I can just let my family deal with what they deal with this is not the attributes of a man and so it's not saying that the person is actually denied the faith but that but the fact that he doesn't provide for his family is in itself a denial of the faith he could just say no no I don't deny the faith I believe every word of the Bible I'm standing with Christ but the the verdict of the Apostle is you're you're worse than an unbeliever not just as bad as an unbeliever you're actually worse than someone that refuses to believe the word and he's saying you're an apostate no I'm not an apostate I believe the word you're not providing for your family you don't have a heart to provide for your family it means you're an apostate and you you've your status level is lower than an infidel it's very harsh but it is very it's very important to realize that God has called those who have the experience of Salvation to express that salvation in their life and men are called to express it differently than women are called to express express it now there's certain there are certain the fruit of the spirit it's not masculine fruit of the spirit and feminine fruit of the spirit at the same time there's an IM masculine expression of the same fruit of the spirit and there's a feminine expression of the same fruit of the spirit and yet there are different works that God has ordained for a man than works that he's ordained for a woman 1 Corinthians 16:13 another verse that always stuns me watch ye Stand Fast in the faith quit you like men be strong so that word quit you like men is the Greek word andrii so it's four words but in Greek it's just one word and the meaning is to render Brave or manly to show or be behave oneself like a man so essentially as I look at this he's putting the attribute of of Bravery together with being a man so if you're if you're a man there should be an amount of Bravery that you have in your in your own life and the reason is that is that is an expression of the strength that you need to have to Pro protect and take care of your family and this is directly connected to what God designed Adam for 1 Corinthians 6:9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but you are washed but you are Sanctified but you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God so Paul puts within this list of of behaviors that would disqual ify you from entry into the kingdom of God one of them is eminate so this is a man who's expressing female characteristics and this goes along with Deuteronomy 22:5 that says that it's an Abomination for a man to put on a woman's garment and for a woman to put on a man's garment this goes goes beyond that and goes to the nature that's on the inside of what it's expressing neither is that the N that you're not as a man you don't express a feminine characteristic neither should you dress with feminine characteristics and the same goes for a woman but here Paul is speaking about eminite men become disqualified so again this is how important this is an expression of Christ so if you're a man and you have the Holy Spirit that's going to lead you into a place where you're expressing masculine characteristics now don't lose hope Paul says and such were some of you some of you were eminate men but the Holy Spirit has delivered you from this captivity of the devil so that you can express Godly manliness all right modern culture does not seek to lead itself to feminization and if I can just make a commentary within that I think we've seen in this recent election a the start of a rejection of the feminization of everything and that's wonderful but there's a there's a lot of fighting and there's a lot of battling against evil spirits that needs to happen still within the body of Christ and and within real Believers Christian men need to throw off this modern culture of the feminization of everything and become real men again real leaders Real Men of Honor Real Men of strength virtue real men that speak the truth no matter what the consequences that have courage that are willing to die for the truth that are willing to stand and to die in protection of their wife and their children and their sisters and their mother all right so again we've we've we've looked at and we've seen what brother brandham has said about motherhood getting out of its place right but remember that motherhood cannot get out of its place until first manhood gets out of its place because men are the stronger vessel women are the weaker vessel and so in order for the woman she cannot overpower the man my wife can't say I want you to do this and come try to beat me up it's not going to work she's she's pretty strong I'll I'll give her that but she still can't whoop [Laughter] me and that's the same that's the same and of course my duty is to protect her not anything besides that that's what strength is that's what the strength of a man is designed for but the point being is our culture got effeminized because the men refused to lead they allow Ed the women to take the place in fact it was men who voted to give women the right to vote and so again we can we can we can uh rebuke the women for being out of place but first we should rebuke the men for letting them be out of place a woman is designed to have a quiet and meek spirit and yes there's that's perhaps a uh you know there's a a what do you call it a spectrum of meekness and quietness and some some of y'all sisters are are on the edge there but they're on the edge of the spectrum but you're still on the Spectrum praise the Lord amen we want to find balance right we don't want to be so quiet and meek that we're scared and fearful and can't take a stand for the word as as sisters and then on the other hand we don't want to be so bold that we're trampling over men and children and everyone else around us and so it's it's it's important to understand that meekness is not weakness right Moses was the most was the meekest man he wrote about himself meekest man upon the Earth what do meekness means it means the ability to be led and so God has designed kind a woman with a nature to be led so whe When a man doesn't lead her she will step up and lead and at the same time she will resent and hate that man for having to do it right we see that in a perfect expression of all these crying feminists on Tik Tok right now they're so upset because their person didn't get voted in and they hate men and now you know what they're going to do they're going to keep themselves chased they're going to protect their womb because men are horrible it's like we've been trying to tell you this for 2,000 years to protect your womb what what is it what did it take this now for you to realize because they they hate and resent men for not leading them yeah they hate their fathers they they hate the people around them because they refused to step up and be men and say no no you're doing wrong you can't act like this you can't live like this this isn't the right way and a woman is designed to be under headship so we see we see in our day that the modern world has glorified eminate men who wear skinny jeans bangs over their forehead like The Beetles and in their eyes weak sickly looking young men that's what the modern world is producing God forbid that our churches are producing the same thing if we are it is a problem not with the mothers it's a problem with fatherhood fathers are not leading their children and they're producing these Beetle looking kids with skinny jeans and don't tell me it's not happening I run I run a youth camp and so we have this situation where we we got to repent and the repentance has to produce some outward work in the lives of young men we see our sisters waiting till they're 30 years old to get married because there's no men around around there's no young men that are willing to be masculine and step up and actually lead and actually do something with their life and I'm I'm I'm sick of seeing that God is a lot sicker than I am of seeing it dads Step Up be men lead lead your family you don't need your wife's permission to lead your family right you don't ask to have to ask her can can we do this can we can I lead the kids this way you talk to God and you be willing to take a stand and even have your wife mad at you over it that's okay that's okay sit down don't be angry because she's angry don't be angry if she's trying to boss you sit down because the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God if she's kicking against the goats CU she doesn't want to follow the leadership that you're providing you pray first you sit down you pray before you talk with her and you say darling I love you I haven't LED right and I'm repenting right now we're not going this direction anymore I'm going to I'm going to lead the family I'm going to do it with love now if you've you you've not been leading properly she's going to have a season of pushing up against you because you have to prove yourself now right exactly that's okay good you must be willing to prove yourself and take the punches of anyone including your wife it's true very good because this is your job and this is your duty and again why don't we get rid of the modern world's entertainment that's pushing men towards this sissified bumbling fool that's protected and saved by the wisdom and strength of his wife this is permeating our culture culture and it is actually the opposite of the truth God has designed man to be a stronger vessel the scripture also shows us that a man is less easily deceived than a woman that might be offensive to to someone's sensibilities but that's scriptural that is why a woman is told not to teach or to usurp authority over a man because for two reasons one Adam was formed first so because of Adam being formed first he was designed to be the leader in the relationship he Not only was he Not only was created first he was given the authority to name his wife two different times first woman second Eve he also named the animals this showed his headship and Authority he had the power of naming both the animals and his own family right and so she was designed to be a helper she was taken out of the man she was made for man the man wasn't made for the woman so it's a man's duty to lead so she is more easily deceived as well that's another reason why she shouldn't teach or usurp authority over man she's not designed to be a leader in the home in the church or in Civil Society right right she is she is specifically designed to be a health ER and to a life be a lifegiver in fact that's what the very word eve means Hava means life or lifegiver she was to be the the beding grounds where the seed is planted to bring forth life into this world and and she's designed in every in every step to be the one that is the first one to nurture brother brandom calls mother The Fifth Gospel and she's the first one to really give love and security to a child all right so man so men are not to be bumbling fools right this isn't the picture that God gives us men are to have wisdom and wisdom is something that is not inherently given to us out of our sinful nature wisdom must be sought and pursued that's what Proverbs tells us in all your getting get wisdom right so what is wisdom wisdom is well let's put it this way knowledge tells us that tomato is a fruit wisdom tells us not to put it in a fruit salad so so you can get you can grow in knowledge and you can grow in wisdom and you say I haven't been a good teacher of my family that's that I'm sorry to hear that but that's irrelevant you can do it that's right I don't think I can I think God can help you and I think with time you can be very skilled at it it just takes applying yourself I promise you I I couldn't teach or speak like this the first time that I spoke I'm pretty sure no one had any idea what I was talking about the first time I spoke because I was just coming out of theology class and the Lord has helped me I think you could understand what I'm talking about I'm not sure 100% but but the devil has done everything he can to fight and to battle and to suppress and Destroy manhood and it's the time to time for us B to say enough I'm sick of this I'm not going to walk around scared of what to say I'm not going to run around and call people they them and G and all this garbage I'm going to speak the truth and whatever the consequences are I don't care I want to stand for God and I I I'm not going to be afraid of the this woke mind virus that's out there in the world the greatest thing that they want to do is silence the the voice of men put you in fear for speaking out and it's time to be done with that I'm I'm over I'm over all that garbage I'm going to speak out I'm going to speak plainly and you can put me in jail you can kill me you can do whatever you want to me but we're going to keep we're going to keep doing what God has called us to do not only not only has he assaulted Us in the the uh The Fifth Dimension we'll say the information Dimension but he's also assaulted us here in this Dimension with the F with the foods that we have you know you can't almost find any food that doesn't have some kind of plant estrogen in it what does estrogen do it's a it's a female feminizing plant phytonutrient so everything has soy in it what do you think that's going to do to men it's going to feminize them brother brandom says calls has this phrase look it up when you have a chance jellyfish look at all the things that he speaks about it what has it done this type of food has turned men into jellyfish and as society as a whole I think in in the 1960s 3% of people were obese now in today's day and age over 60% of Americans are obese it's not a mistake this is the devil's program to turn PE literally turn people into jellyfish and you can read what brother Bram said about it he prophesied it so we need to we need to get comfortable with being men whose approval do you need can I ask you men that that whose approval do you need Christ's that's that's the only person's approval that you need you don't need the government's approval you don't need another person's approval you really don't even need your wife's approval right we want to please our wives we want to make them happy but we have to understand if our only focus is our wife we're missing the fact that our only focus should be Christ and when our focus is Christ that will be sure that we'll take care of our wife and our children the right way so manliness starts with leadership and having a vision and a purpose and working with the audacity to fulfill the purpose that God has designed for you personally to fulfill without fear Without Anger without hatred without malice but having the audacity to do it no matter what anyone else says to you Ephesians 5:23 says for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body this speaks of leadership this speaks of decision making again I don't think we'll get that far in in my notes but modern our modern uh denominational Christianity's idea of headship is little more than just word service word service lip service but the biblical version of headship if you look uh into I believe it's numbers 30 and it speaks clearly that a father and a husband can invalidate any decision that his wife or daughter makes and so when we speak of ship we speak of a deciding factor husband is to be the deciding factor in the home and again that might put some women into a panic maybe that's Justified maybe that's not justified but either way as men we should be leading in such a way that our wife hears this and says thank God I never wanted to be the one making the decisions anyways and that she's so comfortable with the fact that you're her leader that it is a reason to be thankful all right let's find out what God's purpose is for us Genesis 1:26 through 2828 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the Earth so he designed man to be to have dominion and to multiply so man on his own is the stronger vessel he might have the ability to take Dominion on his own but I'm pretty sure he cannot multiply on his own and so that's when we go into Genesis 2 and we see man is God plays out this great drama man is alone he says I'll make him and help me then he brings the animals in front of him shows them male and female he names all the animals and he and he tells us that it's not good for man to be alone so out of all of this creation everything is good except for one thing and it's not that the man isn't good the man is good but it's not good for the man to be alone right and so what does God do he performs a surgery puts him to sleep performs a surgery and from the man creates a woman and she is to be a help meet him or a a help that is helper that is suitable to him so whatever the man's vision and purpose in life that means his wife is to enter into that same purpose and vision and be his helper within that purpose and vision so we see right there that this whole modern idea of dual income and careerism is of the devil it's not of God it's not a scriptural approach to life the family is to operate as a unit husbands are to provide wives are to be a helper in this process Genesis 2:15 and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it the word dress is the word Abad and it means to work or to serve or to work for another or to serve another by labor so it's really looking at the man was designed to work and again this is not after the fall this is before the fall in the very definition of him creating a man I put you here to work and then the other part it says and keep it the other part is Shamar and that means to to hedge about to guard to protect so there's two functions that every man is supposed to provide on Earth and that they are supposed to work and they're supposed to be guardians or protectors so if you wonder young men what is your what is God's vision for your life work and protect for a family this isn't just a just you yourself but the garden so to speak is not just a physical destination but it's a family Proverbs 22:6 says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart in it in our modern sensibility we take this verse to mean only in spiritual things but it's very clear that the the training that a child is supposed to have is supposed to be from in within the context of the family within the context of the home it's not just a spiritual training it's also a natural training for the things of this life show them how they're supposed to live and function in the world and again as I said before we train Sons for one duty and we train daughters for another Duty different functions within the same uh sphere of Home Genesis 18:17 through 19 the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him this always amazes me because God says I'm going to reveal my secret Mysteries to Abraham because I know that he is a man that is going to teach his family after him so maybe sometimes if we're we're lacking in spiritual Revelation in our own lives it's because a of a lack of our teaching and instructing our own families and so teaching and instruction must start with a patriarch not Abraham you brother that's that is what you're called to be patriarch simply means the rule of fathers this is God's design wh the the feminist movement says we're going to fight and throw off the patriarchy well good luck the only patriarch patriarchy that a woman can throw off is a weak one you either have a bad patriarchy or a good one we happen to live in America and have a bad patriarchy perverted patriarchy that's surrendered much of its leadership to a woman yep and it's it's a mistake that we've made but we don't have to make that in our own homes all right so brother brandham tells us in U invisible Union that a woman is given three sacred trusts and as I look at this I realize that the woman is given these three sacred trusts because they're direct directly tied to what what her Duty and function is supposed to be in life so first one brother brandom says now notice now we find that her body is the bedding ground and therefore it's a sacred trust not to defile it he also says she has a sacred Trust of virtue committed to her by her Lord a certain virtue nothing else holds it but a woman right that's committed to her by God she must def not defile that virtue and third he says now we find out she has been given this sacred trust that she must not break of Womanhood act have her character raise her children be honorable to her husband so again three three sacred trusts body virtue and Womanhood so keep your body pure amen keep keep it pure second is virtue it's it's it means strength it means your ability to say yes or no and then Womanhood that's the character and conduct that she has towards her family and so looking at looking at her uh her Duty that's committed to her from the very beginning we see this is all surrounding the family this is all surrounding the home this is all surrounding motherhood and this is is God's design right again we live in a world and in a society that devalues true Godly Womanhood and motherhood and Al almost makes fun of it but the fact is I'm going to spend the rest of my life making fun of feminism because it's not making women happier it's not bringing joy to to Womanhood it's not making homes happier it's it's glorifying in this Al this aloneness this separateness just just think think of how horrible it is short-sighted a woman grows up and goes to a public school and a university and has no father teaching her any truth has no mother teaching her any truth and she thinks the greatest thing I can do is go work in some men's office doing spreadsheets that's the greatest function I can have and really what I want to do is I want to work on some man's spreadsheets and I want to have a cat and maybe a few cats and maybe more cats and suddenly she's 65 and she's the crazy cat lady next door my goodness sisters aren't you so sad that you couldn't have such a life that you're missing all that freedom well the reality is this isn't joyful this isn't beautiful this is not a simple or easy life in that context God has called us to something different all of us want to be happy but because of our sinful nature what do we do we chase a instead of chasing after what will actually make us happy we chase after the thing itself and what do we find when we chase after the thing itself we could have just read Solomon and looked at the Book of Ecclesiastes and find that seeking it that way through the things of the world is what vanity of vanities all is Vanity sayith the preacher what does it mean it's meaningless it's purposeless it's not a it's not a a a it's not going to bring happiness what does bring what brings happiness Finding what are function and design is and fulfilling that under the authority that God has designed when we can when we fully surrender ourselves to the Lord and we find what our calling is what our purpose is it doesn't mean there's not a lot of times where you're not happy again happiness is not the end goal right Joy Joy from finding the true meaning in our life right what what does he say this is the chief end of man to obey God and to keep his Commandments right so really when when it says that the chief chief end or chief purpose something like that in Ecclesiastes what is he saying he's he's saying this is the function this is the purpose that man was created for and when we when we find that purpose and pursue that purpose that is the place where real Joy comes from that doesn't mean we're always happy happiness is something that is not a prize that we should try to grasp and retain we because we live in a fallen world there's always suffering and the fact is without suffering we can never grow in maturity we can never grow in in wisdom and so uh a joyful life necessitates suffering yes it's true very and so when we're when we're pursuing meaning which really is pursuing Christ within the context of our own lives as Fathers as husbands as wives as mothers when we're pursuing Christ in that that's the place where we find a satisfaction in our heart you know I as I get older I think I get I hope I get a little wiser and I see one of the most precious things is sitting and conversing with my own children my own flesh and blood as they get older talking about the things of God making jokes laughing just enjoying a hike out in the woods or sitting together by the coast these things where we're really Christ is at the center of our lives and we're enjoying our our one another this is where meaning is you know I've you go through lots of hard things and you have teenagers this these hard things increase but in at the same time out of it sometimes the are the out of the greatest suffering the the greatest joy comes and you know you go through those times and you think is my f family going to come to Faith are they going to really you know take hold and then you find out things are happening and you think oh my goodness All Is Lost but then you then you draw it causes you to draw closer to the Lord and then you draw closer to the Lord and Dig Down Deeper and say Satan you're not taking my family you're not taking my children I'm claiming them and I'm not only just claiming them but I'm going and running after them and pursuing them with the strength of the Lord and you see out of that God brings Deliverance God God brings healing God brings them the baptism of the Holy Ghost and sets their heart on fire I don't know about you I don't find any Greater Joy than this isn't that what the Apostle said I find No Greater Joy than seeing my children walk in the truth musicians if you'd come and I you know you can you can preach this and and paint a very uh hard picture and this world is dark and evil and it is and you see this Spirit of feminism that's that's trying to destroy the world destroy the church even to destroy the bride if it could but then you then you come to really seek the seek the scriptures and there's many you know I didn't even get to 10% of my notes but you can go through and just just do a search in the message about uh a woman kitchen just read that woman's places in the kitchen yes it's a very offensive thing to say in 2024 but look at what brother brandham says just read it yourself and you'll see that that you know that's a woman's place of course we're talking about the home it's not just she doesn't have to set up her bed in the kitchen it's in the home it's that's where God has designed that's a woman's sphere and you know as a 47y old man every time I say this I begin to tear up because the two most precious people in the world that I can think of are my wife and my mom my mom's gone onto Glory but she raised me to love the word of God yes and she prayed me into the kingdom when I was struggling and my wife his brother bandam she stands between me and the public as he said about his wife and you know she's got to put up with a lot for a traveling Minister you know I'm I'm gone last week get back Monday night start preparing to leave Friday I get home on Monday afternoon out Tuesday morning and this is the this she has she has to have faith that God is leading her husband in a lot of ways I would say our dear sisters have to have more faith than men because they've got to submit to the leadership of a fallen dude that's doing everything he can to follow Christ with all his heart and so my wife is the most precious thing to be in the world and the fact that she stays at home and she homeschools the kids and she takes care of my girls how could I not want to do everything I can to stand for her and to protect her and honor her with my whole life and so you know we thank God for mothers this wasn't a Mother's Day message but I think instead of making it just once a year Mother's Day should be every day right kids amen honor honor the women in your lives because when they really when you when together let's put it that way when together we can really enter into the place that called us God called us to be that's where we really can find joy and meaning and rejoicing within the context of our families CU really that's that's the main place that we're at I believe that's the place the that's the context where kids are raised in the atmosphere and that's going to that's that's the direction that they're going to be sent some kids might stray but I the word says if we train them up in the way they should go they'll not depart from it that make sure men let's make sure our homes are in line with God's word and that we're being true and genuine Patriarchs yes leading our families and benefactors of our families I think I think uh I'll just comment on it because it it goes It goes with this and it's important to say is this idea of this Macho uh uh rude tough guy that's always sort of harsh with his family that's not manliness that's that's a sissified thing a man that would just use his wife and use his family and discard them he he's a ultimately he's a broken and uh bruised man that would act and behave that way you know I've seen I've seen different comments from different people man I come I came home my wife and my kids were arguing they wanted me to solve it I I just went and got a hotel forget them oh that's a real expression of masculinity right no that's a man's job to come home and say all right what's going on everybody sit down let's calm down and let's pray about this let's talk about this that that's that's a a real man understands that he his duty is a provider and I'll put it this way as a benefactor of his family not just saying here's the money here's the groceries here's the clothes but looking at it as I know the hearts of my children I know the need that they have maybe this one's lacking in confidence so I got to do something specifically for this child to help increase their confidence help increase their faith or this one is lacking because they're fearful so now we got to sit down and and address that and do things that address the fear you know that that as men we have to see that and be the benefactor of our wife and of our children not just taking our wife out to on a date every once in a while this whole mentality but really understanding what's going on in our home what specifically the needs are within the context of our family and meeting them that's what a provider is it's not just a paycheck right amen any male or female for that matter or teenager right can do these things that's not true Godly manhood but it's understanding the needs and actually if you understand a provider means Vision beforehand so in other words you actually understand the need before it happens and you do something to meet it Jehovah Gyra before Abraham even looked he turned there it was already provided for him and God calls every man to be that it's a pretty that's intimidating for me know the need beforehand I'm struggling just to know it when it's when it's happening but God is calling that's the kind of prayer life that's the kind of walk with the Lord that we need to have that we actually see the need beforehand and go to meet it before it even gets there amen let's let's stand let's pray
