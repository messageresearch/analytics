[0:00] turn your bibles to john chapter six
[0:02] thank you musicians
[0:04] appreciate appreciated the worship this
[0:06] morning
[0:10] john chapter 6 verses 22 to 35.
[0:24] john chapter 6 is a very familiar
[0:26] chapter
[0:27] for us as message believers especially
[0:30] in that jesus begins to identify
[0:32] himself as the bread of life and he's uh
[0:35] it's placed in the context of now he's
[0:37] opening up the word
[0:39] and there's what is what is your
[0:41] attraction what is it you're coming to
[0:43] see
[0:44] and so there's a lot that we could
[0:45] emphasize in terms of the third pool and
[0:47] the opening of the word
[0:48] and it has that tremendous significance
[0:50] to us and
[0:52] that's kind of what has inspired me this
[0:54] today i don't
[0:55] think i'll get to into those things uh
[0:57] this morning
[0:59] uh but just i wanted to mention that at
[1:00] the outset before we begin to read that
[1:02] that's kind of
[1:03] this is the that's the context and so
[1:05] some of this is the background
[1:06] to um those things that we
[1:10] see later on in this chapter verse 22
[1:13] john chapter 6 verse 22 the day
[1:16] following when the people which stood on
[1:18] the other side of the sea saw that there
[1:20] was none other boat there
[1:21] saved that one where unto his disciples
[1:24] were entered
[1:25] and that jesus went not with his
[1:26] disciples into the boat but that his
[1:28] disciples were gone
[1:29] away alone howbeit there came other
[1:32] boats from tiberius
[1:33] nigh unto the place where they did eat
[1:35] bread after that the lord had given
[1:36] thanks
[1:38] when the people therefore saw that jesus
[1:40] was not there neither his disciples they
[1:42] also took shipping and came to capernaum
[1:44] seeking for jesus and when they had
[1:47] found him on the other side of the sea
[1:48] they said unto him rabbi
[1:50] when camest thou hithered jesus answered
[1:53] them
[1:53] and said verily verily i say unto you
[1:56] you seek me
[1:57] not because you saw the miracles but
[1:59] because you did eat of the loaves and
[2:01] were filled
[2:02] labor not for the meat which perisheth
[2:04] but for the meat which endureth unto
[2:05] everlasting life
[2:07] which the son of man shall give unto you
[2:09] for him hath god the father sealed
[2:12] then said they unto him what shall we do
[2:14] that we might work
[2:15] the works of god jesus answered and said
[2:17] unto them this is the work of god
[2:19] that you believe on him whom he hath
[2:21] sent they said therefore unto him
[2:23] we what signs show us thou then that we
[2:25] may see
[2:26] and believe thee what doest thou work
[2:29] our fathers did eat man in the desert as
[2:31] it is written he gave them bread from
[2:32] heaven to eat
[2:33] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[2:36] i say unto you
[2:37] moses gave you not that bread from
[2:39] heaven but my father
[2:40] giveth you the true bread from heaven
[2:42] for the bread of god
[2:43] which is he excuse me the bread of god
[2:46] is he which cometh down from heaven and
[2:48] giveth life
[2:49] unto the world then they said unto him
[2:52] lord evermore give us this bread
[2:55] and jesus said unto them i am the bread
[2:58] of life
[2:59] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[3:01] and he that believeth on me
[3:03] shall never thirst amen you can be
[3:06] seated
[3:14] i feel over this past week my voice
[3:16] started getting a little bit strained
[3:19] i'm not sure what it's from but pray for
[3:22] me that my
[3:23] we are able to screech out the message
[3:27] today i feel very very inspired
[3:29] to speak and my title is hungry it's a
[3:32] question hungry
[3:34] and in my mind i had um i was just
[3:36] laying before the lord yesterday morning
[3:38] and just
[3:38] wanting to know um what would be
[3:42] relevant i just feel like the word is so
[3:44] rich and so deep
[3:46] you always have something to share
[3:48] there's always something you can express
[3:49] there's always a truth that we could
[3:50] just take time to teach and it would be
[3:52] beneficial to us
[3:53] but i really i really labor and desire
[3:56] to to find
[3:57] the right thing at the right moment
[3:59] spiritual food and due season
[4:02] and i was just laying and praying and
[4:04] just would say lord just speak to me
[4:05] speak to me what specifically
[4:08] would you have me to speak on and this
[4:10] was it was just hunger this hungry
[4:12] is what popped in my head and it was
[4:14] almost as if i had seen
[4:16] in my mind i just remember seeing this
[4:19] billboard that had the question
[4:20] hungry and and it was just always
[4:23] you know just repetitive and i think i
[4:26] was somehow conflating that
[4:28] with the thing anybody seen the
[4:30] billboard for the thing
[4:32] and uh so i was uh that was kind of what
[4:35] prompted it i thought well it's not i
[4:36] don't want to preach about the thing
[4:38] um but uh yeah i wanted i even thought
[4:41] i'd be nice if i could find a picture of
[4:42] that billboard and
[4:43] uh and i don't even know if the
[4:45] billboard exists if somehow the thing
[4:46] became hungry
[4:48] uh but that's what that's what dropped
[4:50] in my heart is just ask this question
[4:52] like are you hungry
[4:53] is there is there a hunger there and i
[4:55] feel directed to speak to those
[4:57] who are ordained to crave god
[5:01] and there is uh maybe you could say it
[5:04] here at the outset that perhaps you're
[5:06] not
[5:06] uh you're not placated with the status
[5:08] quo religion
[5:10] isn't satisfying uh just you know church
[5:12] a church experience
[5:14] you know has never done it for you if
[5:16] anything perhaps maybe those experiences
[5:18] have
[5:18] only made it harder for you to seek the
[5:20] thing which you crave
[5:22] or maybe it's just a general
[5:23] unsettledness or unhappiness to where
[5:25] you just you're not really finding that
[5:27] real contentment
[5:28] despite all the things that you seem to
[5:29] accomplish and all the other things in
[5:31] life that seem to go well
[5:32] there's just deep down inside you don't
[5:34] even feel comfortable in your own skin
[5:36] because you haven't really come
[5:38] to this place of rest so you know
[5:39] there's a longing and a hunger that
[5:40] hasn't been satisfied
[5:42] and so i believe that god is going to be
[5:44] addressing some very specific things and
[5:46] needs
[5:47] and this is a matter of life i guess
[5:50] it's a matter of life or death but i
[5:52] don't know that i'm necessarily wanting
[5:54] to
[5:54] uh you know raise the specter of death
[5:56] but it's it has to be on that level of
[5:59] desperation
[6:00] that this is a matter of life this is a
[6:02] matter of peace
[6:04] and in that will be uh
[6:07] perhaps just trying to turn things over
[6:09] in your heart to cause you to ask
[6:10] yourself what really matters
[6:13] and i think this will grow apparent as
[6:15] we lay our foundation
[6:17] in terms of what is your biggest
[6:19] motivator
[6:20] what is it that's motivating you and
[6:22] driving you kind of like your
[6:23] you know governing principle in your
[6:25] life
[6:27] we'll have limited slides i'm just going
[6:28] to provide slides i think for the most
[6:30] part for these large scripture readings
[6:31] that we
[6:32] are going to have in john chapter six
[6:34] and then a little bit in john chapter
[6:35] four
[6:36] i'd like for you to be able if you could
[6:38] just stay focused
[6:40] if you're not familiar um maybe with my
[6:42] the manner in which i can preach
[6:44] i may not it may not look like i'm going
[6:47] anywhere for a while
[6:48] but i trust by the end you're like okay
[6:50] all right now it all makes sense so stay
[6:52] with me
[6:53] stay with me and i believe that we'll
[6:54] end up at somewhere special so in john
[6:56] chapter six
[6:57] and i and i i'm really laying the
[6:59] foundation to be able to go into a lot
[7:00] more different areas
[7:02] i think that'll be very exciting as a
[7:03] congregation so my title is hungry are
[7:05] you hungry
[7:06] gee that's what we might say in north
[7:07] carolina g uh
[7:09] and uh but we're wanting to ask this
[7:11] question are you hungry is there hunger
[7:13] in your heart
[7:14] so in john chapter 6 i'm just going to
[7:15] jump into it give a little background
[7:17] and just start reading through our text
[7:18] again
[7:19] in john chapter 6 it opens with jesus
[7:22] feeding over 5 000 people
[7:24] with five loaves of bread the bible
[7:26] calls it barley loaves and two small
[7:29] fishes uh they speculate that these
[7:32] would have been two little small dried
[7:34] fish or pickled fish
[7:36] and he had just fed over 5000 people the
[7:38] bible tells us in matthew chapter 14
[7:40] that it was over it was 5 000 men not
[7:43] counting the women and children
[7:45] so how's that from misogyny in the
[7:47] scripture but uh
[7:48] they they only counted the five thousand
[7:51] men and this is
[7:52] so we know they would have fed much more
[7:54] than just five thousand
[7:56] so jesus had just performed this miracle
[7:58] of taking five barley loaves and two
[8:00] fish
[8:00] and feeding over 5000 people and the
[8:03] word in the scripture when it says fish
[8:04] is the word is actually used
[8:06] in the hebrew and as it would have been
[8:08] used even in the context of this meal it
[8:10] would have been used to refer to
[8:12] anything eaten with bread
[8:14] or that part which would complete a meal
[8:16] or aid in the digestion
[8:18] of the bread and so the word fish is
[8:21] there could be used to mean more than
[8:22] just the fact that they ate
[8:24] a pickled herring or something on the
[8:26] lines but just they had bread
[8:28] and they had meat this was what a meal
[8:30] would consist of and this is what they
[8:31] had
[8:32] and it's a word that's used to refer to
[8:34] what was necessary for a man to sustain
[8:37] life they had they had bread they had
[8:38] meat these were things that were
[8:40] uh necessary for the proper functioning
[8:43] of the body these these were
[8:44] substances the bread with the meat that
[8:46] would be a combination of our carbs and
[8:48] proteins
[8:49] so that they would be able to have a
[8:51] proper functioning of the mind and the
[8:53] order
[8:54] of the body these are things that the
[8:55] scripture is saying was provided
[8:58] and it says in john chapter 6 verse 5 as
[9:00] 5 000 people had gathered
[9:02] when jesus then lifted up his eyes and
[9:04] saw great company come unto him
[9:06] he saith unto philip whence shall we buy
[9:09] bread
[9:10] that these may eat and so jesus
[9:13] in the scripture it tells us that jesus
[9:15] asked because he knew what he was going
[9:17] to do
[9:18] but jesus looking upon this multitude
[9:20] that's gathered to hear him speak
[9:22] he's mindful of the fact that the people
[9:25] need to eat
[9:26] and that that uh it wasn't this it
[9:29] wasn't this irrational thought that well
[9:31] if they're here you know listening to me
[9:32] speak then
[9:33] you know that should suffice people
[9:35] don't need to leave and go eat lunch you
[9:36] know
[9:36] what do you you know spiritually
[9:38] immature babies you can't suck it up for
[9:40] six hours and hear me preach
[9:42] he just he knew that this is a need that
[9:44] this is something that the people needed
[9:46] and he asked you philip you know how are
[9:48] we going to get bread and they
[9:49] surmised that philip would have been
[9:51] familiar with the area he might have
[9:52] known a way to procure the bread
[9:54] and he didn't ask this because he was
[9:56] clueless but he knew what he was going
[9:58] to do
[9:59] and he wanted to bring up the subject to
[10:00] the people and the bible tells us that
[10:03] jesus took the loaves and the fish
[10:05] and he distributed five loaves of bread
[10:07] and two fish
[10:08] to his disciples and then the disciples
[10:11] gave it out to the people
[10:13] and as they distributed them and gave
[10:14] them out and as we mentioned before
[10:16] matthew 14 they fed over 5
[10:18] 000 men not counting the children and
[10:20] when they were done
[10:21] feeding thousands of people the
[10:22] disciples each one took a basket
[10:25] and filled 12 different baskets full of
[10:27] leftovers
[10:29] and so each disciple you know when it
[10:32] all started none of them had anything
[10:33] just a boy carrying two uh barley loaves
[10:36] and two or
[10:36] five barley loaves and two fish and now
[10:38] each disciple would have had a bag
[10:40] for themselves of fragments that they
[10:42] took up
[10:43] and that's what has just happened
[10:47] in the day before as we read and it says
[10:49] and uh and
[10:50] the day following so what was before was
[10:53] this tremendous miracle
[10:54] and the bible tells us that the
[10:56] disciples set cell and jesus
[10:58] went into the departed into the mountain
[11:00] and so in verses 22 to 24
[11:03] the people are gathering together at the
[11:06] place of the miracle
[11:07] so where this miracle took place the
[11:09] people are gathering and they're they're
[11:11] coming and said this is where jesus was
[11:12] he took five barley loaves and two fish
[11:15] he fed over 5000 people and when he fed
[11:17] over 5 000 people
[11:18] they had baskets left over and so
[11:20] there's a lot of things that these
[11:21] people were talking about a lot of
[11:23] things that had taken place
[11:24] and so they all gathered together at the
[11:26] place of the miracle and not
[11:28] finding him there they're like well
[11:29] where is where is jesus and where are
[11:31] the disciples and where is everybody
[11:33] and they noticed and they came to the
[11:34] conclusion oh they must have left and
[11:36] gone across the sea
[11:37] so many crossed the lake to find jesus
[11:41] and again this is because he just took
[11:44] two loaves of bread
[11:45] and two little dried pickled fish and
[11:47] fed over 5000 people
[11:49] and then had enough leftovers for 12
[11:51] baskets
[11:53] and then so then in verse 25 it says and
[11:56] when they had found him
[11:57] on the other side of the sea they said
[12:00] unto him rabbi when when cameth thou
[12:02] hither they might have not we know the
[12:03] disciples left we saw you going to the
[12:05] mountain how did you come over here
[12:08] and this could have been a wonderful
[12:10] opportunity for jesus for jesus to say i
[12:12] walked here
[12:14] and then i said well uh regardless of
[12:16] how you got here that's a miracle if you
[12:18] walked around you walked across that's a
[12:19] miracle but he says
[12:21] this verily verily i say unto you in
[12:23] verse 26 i say to you
[12:24] ye seek me not because you saw the
[12:27] miracles
[12:28] but because you did eat of the loaves
[12:31] and
[12:31] were filled now this statement is very
[12:34] tremendous because
[12:35] they saw the miracle they participated
[12:38] in the miracle
[12:40] they if you even think of how jesus took
[12:43] the bread
[12:44] and took the fish distribute it to his
[12:46] disciples and then distribute it to the
[12:48] people
[12:49] the disciples would have been giving out
[12:51] this with consciousness thinking
[12:53] well you have enough bread and here's
[12:55] fish and they would have given this to
[12:56] the people
[12:57] in such a way to where there would not
[12:59] have been this expectation
[13:01] of leftovers or any kind of excess so
[13:04] whether it multiplied by the hand of
[13:05] jesus or by the disciples it may have
[13:07] very well multiplied by the people's
[13:10] own hand to where they had left over so
[13:12] they participated in this
[13:15] they ate the bread they ate the fish
[13:17] they might have even seen
[13:18] what jesus gave them never run out as
[13:20] they partook of it
[13:21] so it wasn't that they didn't act they
[13:24] didn't see what jesus had done but he's
[13:27] touching on something
[13:29] the impact of the supernatural and even
[13:31] as you read when he multiplies all this
[13:33] they say
[13:33] truly you are they confess that he was
[13:36] that
[13:36] prophet in other words surely you are
[13:39] the prophet that moses spoke about in
[13:40] deuteronomy 18 that should come
[13:43] so it wasn't that they completely missed
[13:45] the miracle it wasn't that they
[13:47] completely missed the supernatural
[13:48] but the impact of it wasn't deep enough
[13:52] because they ate of the miracle they
[13:54] even associated the one doing the
[13:56] miracle with this prophecy in
[13:57] deuteronomy 18
[13:58] but the miracles went no deeper than
[14:00] satisfying their appetite
[14:02] and fleshly need for bread this little
[14:05] part is very important for us to catch
[14:07] and just
[14:07] maybe try to personally relate to it it
[14:09] they participated they enjoyed it but it
[14:12] only went so far as the hunger that they
[14:14] would have in their belly
[14:15] in the need that they would have as
[14:17] humans to eat
[14:19] and it could be said that everyone would
[14:21] be willing to partake or receive
[14:22] temporal good from god
[14:24] just as much as every single one of you
[14:26] i don't care how conservative you are
[14:28] and how much you're against big
[14:29] government
[14:30] you all accepted that stimulus check
[14:34] right if you're willing to take it take
[14:37] it from the hand of uncle sam
[14:39] uh we would all even if you didn't even
[14:41] believe in god but somehow you found out
[14:42] he's going to be giving away an escalade
[14:44] you'd get in line
[14:46] because we're all willing to partake in
[14:48] some temporal good from god
[14:50] but jesus called out this error in their
[14:53] heart
[14:54] that everyone's happy with the free meal
[14:56] but do you really catch what's happening
[14:58] do you really see what's taking place
[15:01] and what
[15:02] what was transpiring in their heart and
[15:03] this is really at the the
[15:05] the center of what i'm wanting to lay
[15:07] out here in the beginning the foundation
[15:09] they had a greater respect for their own
[15:11] interest
[15:12] their own personal interests their own
[15:14] carnal appetites
[15:15] than they did about their own their
[15:17] spiritual reality or the spirituality
[15:19] that was taking place
[15:21] a miracle was performed they were able
[15:22] to eat we have nothing to eat what are
[15:24] we doing there's or
[15:25] we've got to bring bread and we're going
[15:26] to get hot and we're going to get hungry
[15:29] and then they eat this miracle and this
[15:31] man must be that prophet spoken of in
[15:32] deuteronomy 18.
[15:33] so jesus says you've showed up for
[15:35] another meeting
[15:37] not because you're recognizing how
[15:39] significant deuteronomy 18 is
[15:41] and not because you really fully
[15:43] understand what the messiah is supposed
[15:44] to do
[15:45] but you're only looking to what benefit
[15:47] you can get
[15:48] from deuteronomy 18 and from jesus in
[15:51] the flesh
[15:52] how it can benefit you in the flesh and
[15:56] so they regarded their own hunger
[15:58] and respected their hunger their natural
[16:00] hunger more than the word
[16:02] and the word that was being preached
[16:04] that would provide for their spiritual
[16:05] appetite
[16:07] they regarded the miracle and the
[16:09] benefit of the miracle upon their body
[16:11] more than they regarded the word that
[16:13] was being preached and what it could do
[16:14] for them in terms of eternal benefits
[16:17] and so jesus says it you did not seek me
[16:20] because you understood and comprehended
[16:22] the depth and the impact of the miracles
[16:24] your eyes were not opened by the miracle
[16:26] but you've sought me because you ate
[16:28] loaves and were satisfied they sought
[16:31] them because they ate bread and fish
[16:33] and their hunger was met their need for
[16:35] food was met
[16:36] and they were full the natural hunger
[16:38] pains that one would have the need to
[16:40] eat a meal that had been satisfied
[16:42] and so their motivation for seeking
[16:44] jesus and crossing the lake was
[16:45] connected to a great
[16:47] and deep need that's within all of us
[16:50] i it's very easy for me i don't have to
[16:53] try to pretend to have discernment and
[16:54] say i feel like someone has back pain
[16:57] and just know that the chances are some
[16:59] of one of you has got back pain like oh
[17:00] my goodness he's got a gift of
[17:02] discernment
[17:02] i i you know you don't have to play
[17:04] around with we all know what it's like
[17:05] to be hungry
[17:06] as a matter of fact i believe my
[17:08] children are perpetually starving
[17:10] there's something about when mom leaves
[17:13] that just triggers this
[17:14] they're famished as soon as she's gone
[17:16] she's they're famous they need to eat
[17:18] but we all this this this their
[17:20] motivation for seeking jesus is
[17:22] connected with
[17:22] a natural appetite a natural hunger that
[17:25] all of us
[17:26] experience that all of us feel and it's
[17:29] not
[17:30] you know it's not a hankering you know
[17:31] for seafood it's not a craving for
[17:34] for indian food it's not just you know
[17:36] some specific thing that just really
[17:38] uh catches your palate just right but
[17:41] it's just the natural
[17:42] need for meat the natural desire for
[17:45] bread
[17:46] or substance to live we have the luxury
[17:50] of saying where do you want to eat
[17:51] and what do we always say anywhere's
[17:53] fine okay let's go there well
[17:55] anywhere's fine means not there and we
[17:58] have
[17:58] we we can choose so many different
[18:00] places to go and we can or do you want
[18:02] this kind of food you want that kind of
[18:03] food and
[18:04] you can partake and eat so many
[18:06] different things and so we say i am
[18:07] hungry
[18:08] and so then the next question is where
[18:10] do you want to eat and you're not
[18:12] hungry in the sense that you have to eat
[18:14] to live
[18:16] you're hungry in the sense that i want
[18:18] something that kind of hits that spot
[18:19] i'm looking for a particular thing to
[18:21] satisfy a craving
[18:22] that's really not the hunger i'm talking
[18:24] about that's the first world problems
[18:27] that we have where
[18:28] we know we need to eat so let's eat
[18:29] somewhere luxurious and some place that
[18:31] we can enjoy
[18:32] someplace we really like but when i talk
[18:34] about a hunger
[18:35] or a desire within someone's heart we're
[18:37] just talking about the need that the
[18:38] body has to have
[18:40] substance to live the base need the
[18:42] basic need that we all have
[18:44] to eat bread and in that
[18:47] in that vein the idea that there was a
[18:50] man who could multiply bread and
[18:52] multiply meat was a very powerful
[18:54] attraction
[18:56] could you imagine if uh if you're if the
[18:59] pastor that you had
[19:01] could just somehow multiply stimulus
[19:03] checks
[19:05] right we all got teslas you know just
[19:08] just rolled off the pastor's hand that
[19:11] would be
[19:12] a very very powerful attraction like
[19:14] well
[19:15] i know where i'm going to church tesla
[19:18] tabernacle
[19:19] right you know we pay our tithes in
[19:22] bitcoin there
[19:24] and and they would just been a natural
[19:26] it'd be it'd be a very very powerful
[19:28] attraction it's like well we we need
[19:29] transportation or we need money to live
[19:31] and if you had
[19:32] a ministry that could just multiply that
[19:35] from nothing
[19:36] that would be a very very powerful draw
[19:39] and so that we really understand even
[19:42] more
[19:43] more significantly what a draw that
[19:44] would have been it wouldn't have been
[19:46] this
[19:46] uh something seemingly lustful but this
[19:50] was a man who took
[19:51] two loaves of bread or five loaves of
[19:54] bread and two fish
[19:55] and fed over 5000 people and you're
[19:57] thinking
[19:58] i work to feed my family i labor i
[20:02] i i make provision and i'm contemplating
[20:05] and we're always thinking about famine
[20:07] and we're always worried about this
[20:08] and if there's a man that could feed
[20:10] over 5 000 people
[20:11] then this is somebody saying now this is
[20:13] something significant this is something
[20:15] from the hand of god
[20:16] this is the messiah it was a very very
[20:19] big attraction to them because it was a
[20:21] solution to a great fear
[20:23] how are we going to eat it was a very it
[20:25] was a solution to a never ending labor
[20:27] of mankind why did man work
[20:29] why did man labor so that he could have
[20:31] bread to feed himself and to feed his
[20:33] family and to think that there could be
[20:35] endless bread to live
[20:37] it's almost as if existence as they knew
[20:39] it would completely change
[20:42] to know that bread would be provided for
[20:43] i'm only working and laboring
[20:45] to make sure that we have bread upon our
[20:47] table if i know that bread is going to
[20:49] be on our table
[20:50] think about the resources that are freed
[20:51] up think about how much life is going to
[20:53] change
[20:53] because now there's one that can take
[20:55] just these few elements
[20:56] and feed us you're catching how powerful
[21:00] of an attraction that would have been
[21:02] and so this is this is this and this
[21:05] need to work to labor for bread it goes
[21:07] all the way back to the beginning in
[21:08] genesis 3
[21:09] when the curse was upon the earth and
[21:10] god told adam that in the sweat of thy
[21:12] face thou shalt eat bread
[21:14] till thou return unto the ground and it
[21:17] this you're kind of the simplest way to
[21:18] describe the essential need of man
[21:20] he's got to eat to live in the endless
[21:22] cycle how he's working
[21:24] to produce bread to eat to live and the
[21:26] inevitable end how even though he's
[21:27] labored to eat bread he ultimately is
[21:29] going to die
[21:30] so this is the reality in existence in
[21:32] the most basic simple way that we could
[21:34] describe it
[21:35] over 5 000 men upon a mountaintop they
[21:37] need to eat they're hungry and all of a
[21:38] sudden miraculously every belly is full
[21:41] and there's leftovers
[21:42] and it goes all the way back to the
[21:43] falls like god told adam
[21:46] he would have to work every day and by
[21:48] the sweat of his brow
[21:49] eat bread and then perpetuate this cycle
[21:52] day after day
[21:53] until the body dies and now we're
[21:55] getting bread from the hand of god
[21:58] as it were this is a it's it's speaking
[22:01] to this
[22:02] desire and this need within mankind
[22:04] whereas jesus in matthew chapter 6
[22:06] he's telling him don't take any thought
[22:08] don't be anxious about what you'll eat
[22:09] or what you shall drink or yet for your
[22:11] body what you shall put on
[22:14] so this was something that people think
[22:15] about this is something people worry
[22:17] about
[22:18] now and i'm not wanting just to kind of
[22:20] point back and say yeah you know
[22:21] those people back in those days those
[22:23] were real vintage people they had to
[22:25] worry about what they were going to eat
[22:26] and what they were going to drink and
[22:27] what they were going to wear
[22:28] we have the same needs now we have some
[22:31] of the similar pursuits and
[22:33] the truth is a lot of us we do we are we
[22:36] are very comfortable in our ability to
[22:38] acquire food
[22:39] the our ability to pay our rent or our
[22:40] mortgage and our ability to
[22:42] be clothed with with nice clothes and
[22:45] there's people that we fellowship and
[22:46] those who are part of the household of
[22:47] faith
[22:48] who struggle to make sure that they're
[22:51] even going to get their rent paid
[22:53] wonder just exactly where how far food
[22:55] is going to go
[22:56] and it's very important that we not get
[22:58] so comfortable in how we have all these
[22:59] things that reach and forget
[23:01] that jesus and the scripture identify
[23:03] this as a real anxiety among people
[23:06] because not everyone typically usually
[23:08] you're not going to find even in the
[23:09] in the faithful and those that serve god
[23:11] opulence and riches and extravagance and
[23:13] the ability just to
[23:14] grab and eat whatever they want there
[23:16] has to be discipline there has to be
[23:17] budgeting there can be some very
[23:19] difficult times we're not sure
[23:21] sure how far this is going to go and and
[23:23] where's the next meal going to come if
[23:25] this doesn't come through we don't get
[23:26] that job or if this happens or that
[23:28] happens
[23:28] and jesus is touching on the great fear
[23:30] and anxiety of every man
[23:31] what am i going to eat what am i going
[23:33] to drink how i'm going to clothe my body
[23:35] but he says is not the life more than
[23:38] meat in the body than reignment
[23:40] now we ask it rhetorically and that we
[23:41] probably say well yeah it is yeah the
[23:43] body's more than
[23:44] uh you know life is more than just
[23:45] eating and the body is more than for
[23:47] clothing
[23:48] but if we if we if we didn't have
[23:51] clothing and food we kind of
[23:52] what are we doing here right like it's
[23:55] the most basic need that's the sum of
[23:56] man's most basic needs
[23:58] it's the sum of man's greatest concerns
[24:01] and so the physical need for just basic
[24:04] human survival so that we could have
[24:06] health and we could even reproduce and
[24:08] have proper bodily functions
[24:10] it's met in food and water in rest and
[24:12] shelter and clothing these are just like
[24:14] the basic things so that you can feel
[24:16] human
[24:17] the basic things that we would need the
[24:19] basic things that we would have to have
[24:21] on a daily basis to be able to achieve
[24:22] all the other things we want to do
[24:24] uh i remember one time i was in honduras
[24:26] with brother paul lafontaine and
[24:28] we're getting ready to leave the hotel
[24:30] and i can't remember the arc of the
[24:32] conversation but
[24:33] it kind of implying do you have
[24:34] everything you need are you ready to
[24:36] preach and i
[24:36] i'm just wanting to convey that as long
[24:39] as as long as i have you know i have my
[24:41] my tie on and my bible i know the gift
[24:44] god will use the gift and i can preach
[24:46] and i made the comment i said as long as
[24:47] i've got clothes on in my bible
[24:49] i'm good to go and he's like is the
[24:52] closed part a problem sometimes you know
[24:54] do you sometimes forget to get dressed
[24:56] when you go preach
[24:58] but really in that way if if if i can
[25:00] dress if i can put clothes on if i can
[25:02] have a meal
[25:03] and then i i've take taken those
[25:05] necessary steps to have those most basic
[25:07] needs met
[25:08] to in order to go forth and do whatever
[25:10] it else is i need to do in the day
[25:12] so these are just on the base basic
[25:14] needs of the human being
[25:17] and so when we look at hunger hunger is
[25:20] just relates to food or just the
[25:21] substance it's
[25:23] even the word that's used for hunger is
[25:25] not just our craving or appetite for
[25:27] something in particular
[25:29] that i don't want that no i don't want
[25:30] that but it actually is
[25:32] unease or pain because of the lack of
[25:34] food to be hungry it's a strong
[25:36] eager desire for survival a desire to
[25:39] maintain essential functions
[25:40] it's a craving wherein the body needs
[25:42] something because it knows if it doesn't
[25:44] have that
[25:44] it cannot even exist
[25:47] not it's not i'm not talking about oh
[25:49] that hit the spot i'm talking about that
[25:51] that keeps me alive type thing that's
[25:53] what we mean by hunger
[25:55] and there's really no plan or pursuit
[25:56] that we engage in
[25:58] that doesn't account for or work around
[26:00] our need to eat
[26:02] if you're going on if you're going to go
[26:04] on a hike have water and if how
[26:06] depending on how long it's going to be
[26:07] you might want to have something to
[26:08] snack on you might want to have
[26:08] something to eat
[26:10] every every trip every every vacation
[26:12] don't we all plan our vacations around
[26:14] where we're going to eat
[26:15] right like where might eat breakfast
[26:17] where am i lunch it's like
[26:18] where are you going i'm going there oh
[26:20] what what are you going to see well i've
[26:21] got all these restaurants picked out
[26:24] and whatever's between them that's what
[26:26] i'm gonna see and that's how we plan
[26:28] things when we
[26:29] we have these first world problems but
[26:31] if you think about it just
[26:33] anything if eating's not really that big
[26:35] to you you make contingencies or plans
[26:37] to have
[26:38] something for what so you can stay
[26:40] focused so your body could have
[26:41] the proper nutrients in order to
[26:43] continue to engage in whatever endeavor
[26:45] it is
[26:46] every plan every pursuit ought to
[26:47] account for a workaround the body's need
[26:50] to eat if not it's probably a failure
[26:54] or if not what do we call it fasting
[26:57] for the entire thing is built around the
[26:58] fact that we're not eating
[27:01] so our whole lives are going to be built
[27:03] around this condition i need to provide
[27:04] for eating or i'm not eating
[27:06] and still it has a way of coloring and
[27:09] framing our entire lives
[27:13] and this need this this need to eat and
[27:17] the power of its feeling which
[27:18] hunger is so great that being deprived
[27:22] of food and water is one of the worst
[27:23] ways to die
[27:26] in exodus chapter 16 and the children of
[27:28] israel said unto them
[27:29] verse 3 exodus 16 verse 3 would to god
[27:32] we would had died by the hand of the
[27:33] lord in the land of egypt
[27:34] when we sat by the flesh pots and when
[27:37] we did eat bread to the full
[27:39] for ye have brought us forth into this
[27:40] wilderness to kill this whole assembly
[27:43] with hunger
[27:43] in other words we would have rather died
[27:45] by some means
[27:46] in egypt with full bellies as slaves
[27:50] than to be free men in the desert and
[27:51] die because of hunger
[27:53] this is just how men this is how big and
[27:56] i'm not chiding the israelites and
[27:57] saying oh they're crazy no this is just
[27:59] how
[27:59] significant it is for someone to be
[28:01] hungry and think that they're going to
[28:03] die and their children are going to die
[28:04] because they don't have bread and they
[28:05] don't have water
[28:06] and they're going to be dehydrated
[28:07] they're going to die of starvation and
[28:08] these bodily functions that begin to
[28:10] shut down they're thinking it would be
[28:12] better if we died by some other tragic
[28:14] event
[28:15] as slaves in full bellies than to be out
[28:18] here in the wilderness and die this
[28:19] agonizing death of malnutrition
[28:21] starvation and dehydration
[28:24] in lamentations 4 9 the bible says they
[28:26] that be slain with the sword are better
[28:28] lamentations four
[28:29] verse nine they that are killed or slain
[28:31] with the sword are better
[28:33] than they that be slain with hunger the
[28:35] bible is saying to be better to be
[28:36] murdered and better to have your life
[28:37] taken away in a tragedy or
[28:39] bleeding out than to die with hunger for
[28:42] these
[28:42] pieing away stricken through want of the
[28:45] fruits of the field
[28:47] so this is within our dna as human
[28:49] beings this is part of
[28:50] our thought process and our psyche these
[28:52] things are rooted in our evolution
[28:54] how that we must eat to live we must eat
[28:57] to live we must do this for survival
[28:59] and it's and it would be the most
[29:00] horrible death to die being stricken
[29:02] with hunger and withering away for want
[29:04] of the fruits of the field
[29:05] it would be better to die a slave with
[29:07] the full belly than to die a free man of
[29:10] starvation
[29:10] this is what the bible is expressing so
[29:13] when they have said when he
[29:15] says you sought me
[29:18] not because you really are catching
[29:20] something deep and spiritual
[29:22] but you sought me really because i was
[29:25] able to feed you
[29:26] and that forms a very large significant
[29:29] thing with even your unconsciousness
[29:31] that your body needs bread
[29:33] so badly that that was enough to get you
[29:35] attracted
[29:38] that essential most basic need to
[29:40] survive
[29:41] was enough for someone to say i'll cross
[29:43] a lake i got a fear of water but i'll
[29:45] cross the lake for a guy who can
[29:46] feed me i'm willing and
[29:49] really what would the shame be you know
[29:51] hanging out in that crew right
[29:53] i mean that would be a posse that we
[29:55] wouldn't be ashamed of
[29:57] like this guy here you got some bread
[29:59] watch this
[30:00] right i mean we would say what you want
[30:02] about the guy we're all eating well
[30:05] right so there really is not much shame
[30:07] in somebody being able to put food on
[30:08] your table
[30:09] by ways of miracles so there's a lot of
[30:11] things a lot of stigmas and
[30:12] a lot of shame and a lot of reproach
[30:14] that would be completely gone when you
[30:16] have somebody
[30:17] who can give you what you need to live
[30:19] and survive and have essential functions
[30:21] so jesus then says this in verse 27 john
[30:24] 6 27
[30:25] labor not for the meat which perisheth
[30:27] but for that
[30:28] meat which endureth under everlasting
[30:30] life
[30:32] which the son of man shall give unto you
[30:34] for him hath god the father
[30:36] sealed jesus turns the entire pursuit
[30:39] upside down he turns the very hierarchy
[30:42] of needs
[30:43] he completely demolishes it not even
[30:45] turns it upside down
[30:46] he basically does away with it to say
[30:48] look you labor on the most basic
[30:50] fundamental level
[30:51] to make sure that your bodily functions
[30:53] are are running properly and orderly
[30:56] so that you can do all these other
[30:57] things that you would need to do because
[30:59] if you haven't had
[31:00] if you haven't had a good breakfast and
[31:01] you're not thinking clearly your blood
[31:03] sugar's low you're probably not gonna be
[31:04] able to put together your puzzle
[31:05] or run around the block or do all these
[31:07] other things you need to do manage life
[31:08] take care of the kids teach whatever it
[31:10] might be
[31:10] you realize there's certain basic human
[31:12] needs that have to be taken care of
[31:14] so this is how man was orienting himself
[31:16] for thousands of years
[31:17] and they're thinking this is what jesus
[31:19] gets because he was worried about
[31:20] whether or not we had eaten that day
[31:22] this is what everyone gets they get it
[31:24] that a man's got to eat and all of a
[31:25] sudden jesus says you know what
[31:27] don't labor for that
[31:30] and he turns the entire pursuit upside
[31:32] down he's saying what do you mean that's
[31:34] all that we labor for
[31:35] if we knew we were going to get handouts
[31:37] if we knew that we had a
[31:38] uh you know minimum basic income and we
[31:41] knew that we would have food delivered
[31:42] us by hello fresh every day
[31:44] i would be able to do hobbies not have a
[31:46] job
[31:47] right and they're thinking oh this this
[31:49] doesn't make it this is
[31:51] completely different he turns it
[31:52] completely upside down by saying
[31:54] don't strive and labor for meat that
[31:56] perishes but labor and strive for meat
[31:58] which endureth under everlasting life
[32:00] and he basically says you can work real
[32:01] hard for food that's perishable
[32:03] or you can labor for something of
[32:04] eternal substance
[32:07] in other words what is going to become
[32:08] the leading object of your life
[32:11] because he's not saying just in case i'm
[32:13] not i'm making a mess of this
[32:15] jesus is not telling him don't work for
[32:18] food
[32:19] right you can keep your will work for
[32:21] food signs
[32:22] but he's saying what's your chief
[32:24] anxiety
[32:27] what what is what is it you're trying to
[32:29] accomplish what's your overall objective
[32:32] do do we would we seek a religion or a
[32:34] belief system or would we try to pursue
[32:37] some lifestyle that really ultimately
[32:39] just benefits us
[32:40] in the natural and in the flesh you're
[32:42] going to try to put everything all the
[32:43] pieces into its place to achieve some
[32:45] sort of nirvana
[32:46] in this natural life or is there
[32:48] something more to it
[32:51] i mean there's it because there's it's
[32:53] not listen
[32:55] the word of god it has never been
[32:57] intended to be you know 12 steps to
[32:58] having a better day
[33:00] or or a band-aid on man's problems it's
[33:03] something entirely different than
[33:05] anything that exists
[33:06] anywhere else the true word of god and
[33:09] what's being presented to us
[33:11] through the word of god and the opening
[33:13] of scripture is not just another
[33:15] religion another belief system another
[33:17] way to order our lives and submit to it
[33:20] and make this work uh
[33:23] and just life feel a little bit easier
[33:26] brother matthew it's not another
[33:28] crossfit cult
[33:30] that's not we're trying to do just we
[33:31] all agree on certain things we're all
[33:33] going to work out together and we're all
[33:34] going to try to you know what's your bmi
[33:36] now and what are you eating like what
[33:37] protein yeah you know
[33:38] i found these pills you know we're just
[33:40] all part of this thing no this is so
[33:42] much deeper
[33:43] than any diet any exercise any belief
[33:46] system any religion
[33:47] this is something that jesus is saying
[33:50] that every other religion is going to
[33:51] try to find some way to better your
[33:53] lives through natural means because
[33:55] that's all that it
[33:56] is he says now i'm telling you don't
[33:58] labor for meat that perishes
[34:00] and don't look for just a government of
[34:02] natural things but labor for
[34:03] meat which endures to everlasting life
[34:05] which the son of man
[34:07] alone can give you
[34:10] what's your chief anxiety what's your
[34:12] main leading objective are you only
[34:14] worried about making sure
[34:15] this works and that works and this works
[34:17] and that works or are you wanting to at
[34:19] the end of the day
[34:20] find what really matters we know that
[34:23] food is required for strength
[34:25] food is required for life without
[34:28] fundamental health without
[34:30] soundness of mind and body the rest
[34:32] really has no meaning or purpose
[34:34] right what if we just even think
[34:37] logically
[34:38] if if if all of us didn't have a
[34:40] snickers this morning we'd all be here
[34:43] you know grumpy brother michael's up
[34:46] here
[34:47] give me the key of g happy
[34:51] happy happy happiness
[34:56] i i'm running us down
[35:00] i mean we just won't kind of be grumpy
[35:02] like you know what i mean if you're not
[35:03] gonna if your body's not gonna be where
[35:04] it needs to be if your blood sugar is
[35:05] not where it needs to be
[35:06] if you're if you're in pain right
[35:08] nothing feels good
[35:10] so there's this obvious need for the
[35:12] body to be aligned there's an obvious
[35:14] need to eat and have health because
[35:15] without it
[35:16] you know just can you work properly can
[35:18] you enjoy other things properly
[35:19] these things are necessary but i'm
[35:21] asking the question today hungry
[35:25] but not to leave here and go eat
[35:26] somewhere
[35:28] but the questions being asked to probe
[35:30] your heart
[35:31] are you at rest
[35:34] that even when your belly is full and
[35:36] you're finding all the choice places to
[35:38] to eat and you're able to buy the choice
[35:40] pieces of meat and you're able to get
[35:41] them smoked just right you're able to
[35:43] grill it just right
[35:44] where your wife's an excellent cook or
[35:45] baker and all these things and you find
[35:47] that
[35:47] i've got i can hike and i can eat and i
[35:50] and i'm able to do this and all these
[35:51] things can be done but yet still at the
[35:53] end of the day
[35:54] you're still hungry you're still not
[35:57] satisfied
[36:00] and jesus is trying to get them to
[36:01] recognize this say now what just
[36:03] happened is very powerful
[36:04] and has a very very strong draw upon the
[36:07] body for great for understandable
[36:08] reasons and for
[36:10] right reasons if you knew that there was
[36:12] somebody that could heal your body
[36:14] and you'd be sick your entire life
[36:15] there's no
[36:17] i i wouldn't want to weaponize that
[36:19] person's desire to be delivered from a
[36:21] debilitating illness
[36:22] like oh well my goodness gracious you
[36:24] saw jesus christ and all you got was
[36:26] healed
[36:27] that is such a huge thing in a person's
[36:30] life they're unable they can't
[36:32] think right they can't function properly
[36:33] can't be the wife they want to be
[36:35] they can't be the mother they want to be
[36:36] a man can't work like he should and the
[36:38] desire and the longing to be healed in
[36:39] their body that's not a nasty perverted
[36:41] desire
[36:42] that's a natural desire and it's a need
[36:45] that god can meet it's a need that this
[36:47] word can fulfill
[36:50] but there's something deeper than that
[36:54] and these powers and these motivations
[36:56] of our base human needs
[36:59] to in satisfying them pursue them don't
[37:01] always bring the fulfillment or the
[37:02] contentment
[37:04] so jesus continues or after he says this
[37:06] to him you should labor for meat which
[37:08] is internal
[37:09] they said unto him in verse 28 what
[37:11] shall we do that we might work the works
[37:13] of god
[37:14] now it might sound as if
[37:18] the the question is being changed a
[37:20] little bit
[37:21] or they're trying to change the subject
[37:24] but what can we do so that we can do the
[37:26] miracles like you're doing
[37:27] what can we do to really perform these
[37:30] wonderful things
[37:31] and i'll speculate that maybe they're
[37:35] thinking well jesus
[37:36] won't do it all the time maybe we can
[37:39] multiply loaves and fish
[37:42] and they said so he says jesus answered
[37:44] and said unto them this is the work of
[37:46] god that you believe on him whom he hath
[37:47] sent
[37:49] i'm sure that didn't really it didn't do
[37:51] much for them they're kind of like okay
[37:53] all right uh how does that how does that
[37:56] equal
[37:57] bread how does that equal fish so he
[37:59] says what what must you do this is the
[38:01] work this is what you must do believe on
[38:03] him whom he had sent
[38:04] they said therefore to him what signs
[38:06] show us thou then
[38:07] that we may see and believe in other
[38:10] words you said that we didn't see the
[38:12] miracle but yet we saw you multiply the
[38:13] bread we saw you do this by the hand of
[38:15] god
[38:16] give us another sign that may open our
[38:18] eyes and then we'll believe upon him
[38:20] whom you say he has sent believe upon
[38:21] the son of man that has been sent
[38:23] that is this bread who can give us this
[38:24] bread that tends to everlasting life
[38:26] what doest thou work our now this is
[38:29] their saying
[38:30] our fathers did eat manna in the desert
[38:32] as it is written
[38:33] he gave them bread from heaven to eat
[38:36] so when asking for further vindication
[38:39] they point back to the exodus wherein
[38:41] god
[38:42] answered the children of israel's hunger
[38:45] they said why did you bring us out to
[38:46] the desert to die of hunger to die of
[38:48] starvation
[38:48] we'd be better to die as slaves with
[38:50] bellies full in egypt by some calamity
[38:52] than to die of starvation in the
[38:53] wilderness and god answered their hunger
[38:56] and he and he uh and he gave them bread
[38:59] they're saying when we were in egypt
[39:01] when we were leaving egypt and we were
[39:02] in the exodus god through the hand of
[39:04] moses
[39:04] our fathers did eat manna as he gave
[39:07] them bread from heaven to eat
[39:08] they bring it back to the natural hunger
[39:11] that was satisfied in the exodus
[39:13] and the fact that moses met their
[39:15] natural hunger when they complained
[39:16] about it
[39:17] like we're in this exodus we're seeing
[39:19] the mighty hand of god and when we
[39:20] complained about our bellies not being
[39:22] full we received manna
[39:24] and the bible says in nehemiah and god
[39:27] gave us them bread from heaven
[39:29] for their hunger and brought us forth
[39:31] water for them out of the rock for their
[39:33] thirst
[39:34] nehemiah 9 15. in deuteronomy chapter 8
[39:39] verse 3 says and he humbled thee and
[39:40] suffered thee to hunger
[39:42] and fed thee with manna which thou
[39:44] knewest not neither did thy fathers know
[39:46] that he might make thee know now notice
[39:49] this
[39:50] they were hungry in the flesh right
[39:54] and god gave them fleshly food
[39:57] and it's just as the bible says if
[39:59] someone says they're cold and you say oh
[40:00] be warm
[40:02] i'm hungry we'll be thou filled that's
[40:04] that
[40:05] that yeah that's not making that that
[40:06] doesn't work right
[40:08] will yourself warm will yourself full
[40:11] like if somebody's hungry then what you
[40:13] want is you want
[40:14] they would want food to fill their belly
[40:17] if somebody's cold they want some
[40:18] source of heat or warmth in order to
[40:20] remedy that need and this is exactly god
[40:23] didn't look at the children of his like
[40:24] oh we're dying of hungry he's like well
[40:26] imagine yourselves full
[40:30] you know what you believed this far
[40:32] believe that you can survive in the
[40:33] wilderness without food
[40:35] no god gave them bread to meet that need
[40:38] but he did it that he might make thee
[40:40] know
[40:40] that man doth not live by bread only
[40:43] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[40:45] the mouth of the lord doth man live
[40:48] like there's still was something behind
[40:50] this thing you can't just take this as
[40:52] the end all that as long as we have food
[40:54] that this is this is the this is the
[40:56] desire of god to make sure that we're
[40:58] well fed and well clothed that there was
[41:00] something more greater need that existed
[41:01] within mankind
[41:02] that's only going to be satisfied
[41:04] through the word i did this so that at
[41:06] the end of the day
[41:07] man would be sick there would be some
[41:09] signal to man to believe in a god so
[41:12] supernatural
[41:13] and to take him at his word because
[41:14] ultimately man cannot just
[41:16] live by the meat that energizes his
[41:18] flesh but he's going to be
[41:20] asked to live and he can only be fully
[41:22] satisfied
[41:23] by living by the word that comes out of
[41:25] god's mouth
[41:26] so in matthew chapter 4 when jesus was
[41:28] led of the spirit into the wilderness to
[41:30] be tempted
[41:31] says he went and fasted 40 days and 40
[41:33] nights and he afterward
[41:34] hungered painful desire very very hungry
[41:38] and when the tempter came to him he said
[41:40] if thou be the son of god
[41:41] command that these stones be made bread
[41:44] now listen
[41:48] you don't ever have to clown for the
[41:49] devil
[41:52] if thou be if thou be i think sometimes
[41:54] it's the
[41:55] this this the the voice of the critics
[41:59] that we imagine that motivate us to act
[42:01] more than the voice of god
[42:02] that tells us to stand still
[42:05] oh well what would they say and what
[42:06] would they think and we're we're acting
[42:08] on these imaginary voices sometimes
[42:10] they're real but sometimes they're
[42:11] imaginary
[42:12] and we've just constructed a jeering
[42:14] audience
[42:16] well if you do that we're going to make
[42:18] fun of you well i better not do that
[42:20] but you better do this well then i think
[42:22] i'll do that and we're just imagining it
[42:23] in other words we should just
[42:24] we should just live by what god would
[42:26] have us to do if thou
[42:28] be if thou be the taunts and the
[42:30] intimidations and the bullying
[42:32] of the devil listen i i we shouldn't be
[42:35] moved by that
[42:37] god will provide god will god will do
[42:39] the things that are necessary
[42:40] jehovah sees and he'll see to it
[42:45] and and and so he says if thou be the
[42:47] son of god well
[42:48] basically if he's asking this
[42:51] supposition
[42:52] well if thou be then do this
[42:55] for jesus to even begin to try to answer
[42:58] that or do it
[42:59] is validating the question on whether or
[43:02] not he is
[43:04] oh well let me prove a teacher just
[43:05] didn't need to prove anything to the
[43:06] devil
[43:08] but he says he answered and said it is
[43:10] written man shall not live by bread
[43:13] alone
[43:14] but every but by every word that
[43:16] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[43:20] what are these scriptures emphasizing
[43:21] even the very fact the very thing that
[43:23] the
[43:24] these men they had gone across the lake
[43:26] and to capernaum the very ones that came
[43:28] and and started this conversation with
[43:30] jesus how did you get here
[43:33] and you just came because you want more
[43:35] bread they're kind of like oh well you
[43:37] know
[43:38] if we do well then what should what can
[43:40] we do to work the works of god well just
[43:41] believe on him and we said well you know
[43:44] when we were hungry in the wilderness
[43:45] god gave us bread from heaven and we
[43:47] were satisfied
[43:48] they bring it right back to that in the
[43:50] very thing that they
[43:52] identified god's basis and reason for it
[43:55] was so that they wouldn't get so
[43:56] fixated on the natural things but they
[43:58] would recognize this is something beyond
[44:01] natural and if a god can reign quail
[44:04] down
[44:05] out of heaven and a god could multiply
[44:07] bread every morning
[44:09] such that whatever we wanted to taste
[44:11] we'd taste it to the children it was oil
[44:13] to one it would be fish to another it
[44:15] would be that they all the honeycomb
[44:17] it would be whatever they wanted if god
[44:19] could do that
[44:20] then how much more should we believe for
[44:22] things that are beyond
[44:24] this like why would we relegate
[44:28] everything to just these natural realms
[44:30] and
[44:30] pull everything down to where that's
[44:32] that's the limit of it god says i
[44:33] did it so that you would know that you
[44:36] can live
[44:37] by and find true meaning in the word of
[44:39] god and jesus brings it right back to
[44:41] that when he's hungry and the devil
[44:42] wants him to turn stones into bread
[44:45] he's like well i could do that and
[44:46] satisfy the body
[44:48] but i have a greater motivator
[44:52] there's a higher pursuit bread alone is
[44:54] not the ultimate goal
[44:56] it's not by any means necessary we fill
[44:59] the belly
[45:01] right that that's not how we're living
[45:04] to where we justify certain things
[45:05] like well it's a means to an end at the
[45:07] end of the day if we can just we need to
[45:09] eat right
[45:10] so i mean why do you care if i walked
[45:12] out with an extra bag of alright of
[45:13] french fries without paying for them
[45:15] i mean if they didn't want this they
[45:17] wouldn't have self-checkout
[45:18] duh right
[45:22] and we somehow rationalize it because
[45:24] i'm meeting a base it's not like i'm
[45:25] trying to sell it on ebay and get rich
[45:29] but this has got to be a dif there's got
[45:30] to be something a different motivator
[45:32] different kind of integrity something
[45:34] else that's guiding you and jesus said
[45:35] hey
[45:36] i'm not just all about where am i going
[45:37] to get my next meal am i just all about
[45:38] whether or not my belly's full
[45:40] there's something greater a greater need
[45:41] and a greater desire above that
[45:43] and something else that i'm tapped into
[45:45] i'm feeding on that satisfying me
[45:46] and this is the real secret to
[45:48] contentment
[45:51] because hunger is so powerful that it
[45:54] actually drives man away from things
[45:56] that are most essential and things that
[45:58] are the most fulfilling
[46:00] thinking that well if i'm not i hate
[46:02] this feeling of being hungry i hate this
[46:03] feeling of being broken as long as i can
[46:05] just
[46:05] fix all these things in the mind and
[46:07] body fix all these things in the natural
[46:09] then everything will be fixed and
[46:11] everything will click and fall in its
[46:12] place but the proverb says in proverbs
[46:15] 30 verse 8 remove
[46:16] far from me vanity and lies give me
[46:19] neither poverty nor riches it's a plea
[46:21] for contentment
[46:23] remove far from me vanity remove from me
[46:25] lies removed from me i don't want
[46:26] poverty nor riches i just want
[46:28] contentment
[46:29] feed me with food convenient for me
[46:33] just give me prey as my allowance of
[46:36] bread for that day give me
[46:38] my daily bread give me my sufficient
[46:40] portion for each day
[46:41] just make sure that this base need is
[46:43] met i don't want to be greedy for gain i
[46:45] don't want it to be extravagant i don't
[46:47] need to be well
[46:48] or arrayed and things don't need to be
[46:50] luxurious and fine and supple and
[46:52] wonderful and i don't need some sort of
[46:54] status meal and i don't need some status
[46:56] clothing
[46:56] i just want what's convenient for me
[46:58] feed me with what's convenient for me
[47:02] i mean that's like a real healthy way to
[47:05] approach eating
[47:06] i live for years with the principle i
[47:09] live
[47:10] to eat in other words that's all that's
[47:12] the only reason why i was living i was
[47:13] living to eat
[47:14] so if you live to eat then when you eat
[47:16] you want to eat well
[47:18] right you know it's got to have so many
[47:20] ratings on yelp and it's got to have so
[47:22] many ratings on google and you've got to
[47:23] make sure you've looked this up and
[47:24] looked that up and it's got to have the
[47:25] right things it's got to have the right
[47:27] and you want to make sure you're eating
[47:28] well and eating right if you're living
[47:30] to eat you're probably going to die
[47:31] quicker
[47:33] right then if you're just hey i got to
[47:36] eat to live so i'm going to eat
[47:38] and i'm going to eat this there's some
[47:40] nutritional advice i could
[47:41] dish out right now not necessarily but i
[47:43] charge for that so
[47:46] i'm a professional but
[47:50] it's a little bit more healthy so you
[47:51] know what i need to eat to sustain
[47:52] function
[47:53] right and this need
[47:57] that that's kind of the just give me the
[47:59] bread that's convenient for me
[48:02] but it's still even in that desire it's
[48:05] acknowledging the fact that there can be
[48:08] such a need natural need that drives a
[48:11] man
[48:12] too far that'll cause a man to lose even
[48:15] his moral compass
[48:17] and the people in john 6 are unknowingly
[48:20] wrestling with
[48:21] how their hunger has hijacked their
[48:23] minds
[48:25] they're not they don't really they're
[48:26] not really catching it but jesus is
[48:28] basically wanting them to say
[48:29] look you're men or you're human so you
[48:33] need to eat
[48:34] and you realize you can't live without
[48:36] eating but that
[48:37] whole dynamic has become so large in
[48:40] your mind
[48:41] that you're looking that the very fact
[48:43] that god took
[48:44] natural bread this doesn't happen
[48:46] naturally he took barley loaves
[48:48] and took fish and multiplied them and
[48:49] had leftovers and you still are thinking
[48:52] cha-ching we can really eat like this is
[48:56] awesome our belly's gonna be full
[48:57] like it never dawned on you that whoa
[48:59] wait a minute
[49:01] what's going on here this is beyond
[49:04] i'm not thinking about lunch anymore
[49:07] i've lost my appetite
[49:09] i i i there's something else happening
[49:11] here i don't know what's going on but
[49:13] this is way beyond
[49:14] what we're eating for lunch
[49:18] but they're natural this thing is so
[49:20] great and so powerful it
[49:21] hijacked the thought process in proverbs
[49:24] chapter 28 verse 21
[49:26] to have respects of person is not good
[49:29] for for a piece of bread that man will
[49:31] transgress
[49:34] do you catch that we have respect of
[49:36] persons and you hold someone in high
[49:37] esteem
[49:38] there's a way that this dynamic of
[49:40] politics
[49:42] can work upon a person or if you favor
[49:44] somebody you're trying to gain favor win
[49:46] favor you want to you want to have some
[49:48] influence or you want to benefit by that
[49:50] relationship
[49:51] it can actually the fact that a man
[49:53] hungers
[49:54] and he has certain basic needs it'll
[49:56] cause him to
[49:57] transgress the bible's identifying a
[50:01] weakness in man that natural hunger can
[50:03] motivate bad behavior
[50:04] because he realizes if i fall out of
[50:06] political favor then i may not be able
[50:08] to make a living or may not get the rays
[50:09] and may not be able to provide
[50:10] and these things begin to work upon a
[50:12] person where now there's forces that are
[50:14] motivating somebody
[50:14] and the bible says that you will because
[50:16] of hunger and the natural needs and your
[50:18] base needs as a human
[50:20] transgress why it's a powerful force
[50:24] in proverbs chapter 6 verse 30 men do
[50:26] not despise it says men do not despise a
[50:29] thief now this is really heavy
[50:31] it's human nature to not despise or
[50:34] begrudge a thief
[50:35] if he's still to satisfy his soul when
[50:38] he is hungry
[50:41] in other words we can even all of us
[50:42] could relate to the
[50:44] the one who's a beggar the one that's
[50:46] stricken the one that's needy
[50:47] who doesn't know how they're gonna feed
[50:48] their kids and they go into a grocery
[50:50] store and they're trying to steal
[50:51] diapers or they're trying to steal
[50:52] formula
[50:53] and that happens and we look at that and
[50:54] we're like well you know what they were
[50:56] desperate
[50:57] and it's really hard to begrudge them
[50:58] and it's really we can have some empathy
[51:00] or maybe sympathy
[51:01] who can empathize maybe at least some
[51:04] sympathy realize hey
[51:06] the extremes that people go to to
[51:07] provide for their kids all because this
[51:09] need and this hunger
[51:10] the bible's even saying that we won't
[51:12] despise a man who steals
[51:14] because he's so hungry he needs to eat
[51:16] to live
[51:17] so it acknowledges on one hand we get it
[51:20] we know how strong this drive is and
[51:22] it's so strong
[51:23] that we're even willing to justify theft
[51:27] when it's to satisfy a hungry soul right
[51:30] in the body
[51:31] a body that is hungry in genesis chapter
[51:34] 25 i'm just wanting to identify right
[51:36] now
[51:36] how being hungry and this natural desire
[51:40] can change our thinking and cause us to
[51:42] really miss what god is doing and what
[51:43] he's trying to accomplish
[51:46] in genesis chapter 25 esau is out
[51:48] hunting and he comes back
[51:50] and he is hungry
[51:53] faint he is famished
[51:56] and i don't know if esau was a drama
[51:58] queen or if he really really was
[52:00] just that hungry but he said oh i'm
[52:02] going to die
[52:03] oh jacob make me make me something to
[52:05] eat i'm going to die and he's
[52:07] and the bible he tells a story he sold
[52:10] his birthright he sold his rights as the
[52:14] firstborn
[52:15] because he was faint with hunger
[52:18] and this is how powerful hunger is he
[52:21] says in genesis chapter 25
[52:23] 32 and esau said behold
[52:26] i am at the point to die what prophet
[52:29] shall this birthright do to me
[52:32] this is how powerful hunger is that he
[52:35] rationalizes and says well if i can't
[52:37] live
[52:39] then what good is it to be the firstborn
[52:41] what is the double portion going to be
[52:44] what is what is this right going to be
[52:46] what is that going to be
[52:47] and in his hunger he completely forsake
[52:49] really maybe what would have been any
[52:50] kind of rational thought like
[52:52] do you really think you're going to die
[52:53] because you've been out hunting all
[52:54] morning like how long have you been gone
[52:56] and maybe i i might be a little flippant
[52:58] maybe he'd been gone for three weeks
[52:59] trying to hunt i don't know
[53:01] but it's there's it's it the question is
[53:04] how could you get
[53:05] so hungry in a moment that you'd be
[53:06] willing to exchange
[53:08] everything associated with being the
[53:10] firstborn for pottage for meat
[53:13] but yet here he was disregarding
[53:17] the spiritual advantages of the
[53:19] birthright
[53:20] it's where there should have been some
[53:22] honor there should have been some worth
[53:23] enough to say
[53:25] that it's not even willing to be
[53:27] exchanged
[53:29] like this is the value of the birthright
[53:31] i have all these rights and privileges
[53:33] as being the firstborn
[53:34] and it's so valuable that it wouldn't
[53:37] even be worth
[53:38] exchanging to live i would rather die
[53:41] holding that right and holding that
[53:43] privilege
[53:44] and holding to that honor and esteeming
[53:46] and
[53:47] even thinking that perhaps providence
[53:49] would step
[53:50] in on my behalf as the one that would be
[53:52] heir to the priesthood heir to the
[53:54] double portion
[53:55] that if i providence had seen that i
[53:57] would be the firstborn
[53:58] then could not providence then uphold me
[54:01] in this moment
[54:02] and maintain my integrity and not sell
[54:05] it just for a mess of pottage
[54:08] but he didn't regard and respect just as
[54:10] these men before jesus did not respect
[54:12] the spiritual advantages that were being
[54:14] offered to him
[54:15] he did not regard the spiritual benefits
[54:17] of the birthright
[54:19] and hunger is what made him vulnerable
[54:25] in the bible in hebrews chapter 12 verse
[54:27] 16
[54:28] it says lest there be any fornicator or
[54:30] profane person as esau not that he was a
[54:32] fornicator although there is some
[54:34] jewish uh segments of the jewish
[54:38] tradition that believe that
[54:39] all in the same day esau committed five
[54:42] different evil acts
[54:45] of murder and fornication but here it
[54:47] seems to be saying that he
[54:49] is a profane person
[54:52] who for one morsel of meat sold his
[54:55] birthright
[54:56] profanely cast away spiritual privilege
[54:59] for what
[55:00] for a meal
[55:03] he cast away now to kind of get your
[55:06] mind around it
[55:08] it was he was throwing away his
[55:10] inheritance not just his but his
[55:12] children
[55:14] everything he stood to gain i mean all
[55:16] the all the legacy and
[55:17] everything that was in the will and all
[55:19] the estate and all the double portion
[55:21] i mean he basically said i'm so hungry
[55:24] and jacob
[55:24] the shyster he says well i tell you what
[55:26] let me have your birth right
[55:28] capitalizing that vulnerability
[55:30] capitalizing on one's need to eat and
[55:32] one's need to have
[55:33] a meal to sustain life and he
[55:35] capitalizes on on esau's vulnerability
[55:37] and he's his mind is so hijacked by
[55:39] hungry he's like well if i die what
[55:41] good's the birthright you can have it
[55:42] and just
[55:43] in that profaning in him not saying wait
[55:46] a minute
[55:46] are you kidding me i'd rather die than
[55:48] give that up
[55:50] and if i die you'll get it anyway so i'm
[55:52] just holding fast i'm holding to it
[55:54] and i'm not going to give it away i'm
[55:56] just going to trust god that something's
[55:57] going to happen
[55:58] but he gave it away all because he was
[56:01] hungry
[56:05] hunger it comes from the root to toil
[56:08] for daily substance
[56:10] the word hunger has the idea of a
[56:12] pinching
[56:13] toil there's a pining it means to crave
[56:16] ardently
[56:17] if you're hungry you suffer for want
[56:18] you're needy you seek it's something you
[56:20] have an eager desire for
[56:23] to be hungry there's some sort of pain
[56:26] caused by the lack of food
[56:28] and it's this primal base need that
[56:32] motivates and drives our flesh
[56:36] it's what's inspires survival instincts
[56:40] whether you've ever thought about it or
[56:42] not it's this that's at the root
[56:44] of all our labor
[56:47] as men and women
[56:51] and there before jesus in john chapter 6
[56:55] they say well our fathers hate man in
[56:56] the wilderness
[56:58] that came down from heaven and jesus
[56:59] says in verse 32 john 6 32
[57:02] verily verily i say unto you moses gave
[57:04] you not that bread from heaven
[57:07] and he's not
[57:11] rejecting that mo that bread came down
[57:13] about of heaven
[57:15] but he's saying that bread did not come
[57:16] by the hand of moses
[57:18] moses didn't give you that bread from
[57:19] him he didn't give you the bread you're
[57:21] alluding to or the bread i'm alluding to
[57:23] and even the bread that moses gave
[57:25] didn't come from heaven as it were
[57:28] and it didn't come from moses it came
[57:29] from god
[57:31] it came from the atmosphere it fell down
[57:33] but i and jesus is trying to kind of
[57:35] create this division now no no wait a
[57:36] minute that was just a type
[57:39] moses gave you not that bread from
[57:40] heaven but my father giveth you the true
[57:42] bread from heaven
[57:44] in other words moses did not pray for
[57:45] prepare and procure the bread that you
[57:47] ate in the wilderness
[57:48] god gave that bread but that bread was
[57:50] not the true bread
[57:51] that bread was just a type
[57:54] that bread was from god and it was for
[57:56] your flesh i'm not talking about a bread
[57:58] that feeds the flesh
[57:59] he's like hello that's exactly what the
[58:02] disciples did when jesus always says hey
[58:04] beware of the leaven of the scribes and
[58:05] pharisees he's like hey
[58:07] where's the bread what happened to the
[58:08] they're trying to poison us
[58:10] and they were just thinking about
[58:11] natural bread they wasn't they didn't
[58:13] connect it to something is he saying
[58:15] this because we don't have bread what's
[58:16] gotten in here is jesus
[58:17] is he on gluten-free now what's
[58:18] happening
[58:21] and it's still this mindset and this
[58:23] attitude of not catching it
[58:25] and he's wanting to identify this that's
[58:27] bread for flesh
[58:28] anybody can participate in that but i'm
[58:30] talking about god gives true bread from
[58:32] heaven
[58:32] and he's pointing to a different bread
[58:34] he's actually trying to identify
[58:36] a different and greater hunger
[58:39] we're just conscious of this body's need
[58:41] for bread because of hunger pains
[58:43] because we recognize the detriments and
[58:44] not eating
[58:45] we realize the struggle and the toil and
[58:47] the histories of famines and people
[58:49] dying and
[58:49] they have histories of famines where
[58:51] thousands of people are dying every day
[58:53] in rome
[58:54] 5 000 a day during these great famines
[58:56] these things were
[58:57] these famines were things that happened
[58:59] often during this time period this is
[59:01] something large this is something very
[59:02] substantial this is something they think
[59:04] about and jesus
[59:05] actually say as much as you think bread
[59:08] and meat is
[59:09] in water is important i got something
[59:11] that's even more important than that
[59:13] and everyone would be like jacob or esau
[59:16] or like those in the wilderness oh if we
[59:19] can't eat
[59:21] what good is all this other stuff you're
[59:23] going to do for me
[59:25] if i if i can't have my belly full how
[59:28] am i going to enjoy whatever else you've
[59:30] got going on
[59:32] jesus then brings it right back to the
[59:34] exit or actually brings it before the
[59:36] exodus
[59:37] he brings it before the fall and he
[59:39] strikes at a need
[59:41] that is greater than food verse 33
[59:45] for the bread of god is he which cometh
[59:47] down from heaven
[59:49] and giveth life into the world
[59:52] imagine just how contradictory this was
[59:55] to their natural inclinations imagine
[59:59] just how contradictory this was to the
[1:00:01] religious inclinations
[1:00:03] when he says this the bread of god which
[1:00:04] he the for the bread of god is he which
[1:00:07] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[1:00:09] unto the world he's saying there is a
[1:00:10] living bread of life that is more
[1:00:12] essential than your daily food
[1:00:14] there's a living bread of life that's
[1:00:15] more essential than daily water
[1:00:17] this is something that is greater than
[1:00:19] all these things and he's wanting to
[1:00:20] identify
[1:00:22] wanting to awaken and quicken inside of
[1:00:23] them that they have a need that's so
[1:00:26] deep within them that it transcends the
[1:00:28] need for natural food and natural water
[1:00:31] like let's go back before the exodus
[1:00:33] let's go back before the fall
[1:00:34] let's go back to how what god made man
[1:00:36] for in the very beginning
[1:00:38] and how he would have lived and what he
[1:00:40] would have been focused around
[1:00:41] and god did not make man so that he
[1:00:44] would be an animal that just hunts his
[1:00:46] next meal
[1:00:46] but he put something deep down within
[1:00:49] people where there would be something
[1:00:50] greater than the natural food
[1:00:52] something greater than the water of this
[1:00:54] world then that alone would
[1:00:56] satisfy no matter how well you eat how
[1:00:57] well you dress how well you work how
[1:00:59] much you weigh
[1:01:00] how physically fit you are how perfectly
[1:01:02] your hair lays you wouldn't matter all
[1:01:04] of that you'd still feel
[1:01:05] empty unless that other part is touched
[1:01:10] i i believe that god is addressing some
[1:01:13] very specific things
[1:01:15] that maybe some of us just simply need
[1:01:17] to be reminded
[1:01:18] that unless that's being satisfied the
[1:01:21] rest is
[1:01:21] never going to bring you happiness
[1:01:25] it's never going to work for you and
[1:01:28] and if you if you're somewhat resistant
[1:01:30] to it thank god for it it's his grace
[1:01:35] if you can't be satisfied with enough
[1:01:36] money in the bank you can't be satisfied
[1:01:38] with good e
[1:01:39] you can't be satisfied with a nice house
[1:01:41] that's paid off you can't be satisfied
[1:01:42] with the car you can't be satisfied with
[1:01:44] athletic accomplishments
[1:01:45] none of these things satisfy and you
[1:01:47] still feel empty today don't despair
[1:01:49] thank god for his grace that he's never
[1:01:52] let anything hush that hunger for him
[1:01:56] be glad that you never found the thing
[1:01:58] well crack did it for me i'm satisfied
[1:02:00] be glad
[1:02:04] be glad that nothing else is satisfied
[1:02:06] that's his grace
[1:02:08] and when he says that verse 34 then said
[1:02:11] they unto him
[1:02:11] lord evermore give us this bread
[1:02:16] and this seems to be an instinctive
[1:02:17] sincere reply this seems to be very
[1:02:19] heartfelt
[1:02:21] like well then give us the spread but it
[1:02:23] still carries the idea of bread for
[1:02:26] flesh
[1:02:27] because i and i'm so glad that i took
[1:02:29] the scriptures and i didn't have them in
[1:02:30] my notes
[1:02:31] because i wanted to go through these
[1:02:32] other scriptures to where the jews
[1:02:35] believed that the messiah would come and
[1:02:37] he would give him the best wine
[1:02:38] the best oil the best spices and the
[1:02:41] best bread
[1:02:42] i mean this would be the uber uber eats
[1:02:45] i mean this was
[1:02:46] this would be uh much better than what
[1:02:48] we could get today
[1:02:50] because that's what they expected the
[1:02:51] messiah is going to come they're going
[1:02:52] to be restored back to a garden of eden
[1:02:54] and all the heathen nations
[1:02:55] like do you see what they're eating
[1:02:59] like that's like the best olive oil you
[1:03:02] can get
[1:03:02] is that avocado toast what
[1:03:06] these guys are killing it and it says
[1:03:09] they'll feed and they'll be
[1:03:10] fed and they'll be clothed and they'll
[1:03:12] be happy but everyone else my servants
[1:03:14] will eat well and they'll rejoice and
[1:03:16] they'll have their tables full
[1:03:17] they believed that the messiah was going
[1:03:19] to come and it was just going to be a
[1:03:20] smorgasbord of good eats
[1:03:23] and that's what they thought in their
[1:03:24] mind like what else would a man want to
[1:03:26] do other than
[1:03:26] eat well can i get a witness yes
[1:03:31] that's what we want to do we want to eat
[1:03:32] well and that's how they thought like if
[1:03:34] i can eat good
[1:03:36] then i'm good and they said if you be
[1:03:40] the messiah then give us this perpetual
[1:03:42] food that'll quench our hunger
[1:03:44] and that's what they're asking for then
[1:03:46] if this is it
[1:03:47] then we believe in the scriptures
[1:03:48] according to the scripture that he's
[1:03:50] going to come and we're going to eat
[1:03:51] well
[1:03:51] we're ready for it we'll receive it
[1:03:55] but their their their response lord
[1:03:58] evermore give us this bread
[1:04:02] at least they're now desirous for
[1:04:04] whatever he has
[1:04:07] and in john chapter 4
[1:04:11] i'm going to ask this to you
[1:04:12] individually so feel free to respond
[1:04:14] anybody getting restless i'm
[1:04:15] over an hour i get it but
[1:04:18] um i'm just going slow today don't you
[1:04:21] love it when the preacher says we're
[1:04:22] just going to do a sunday school lesson
[1:04:23] today
[1:04:24] don't we all just cringe when that
[1:04:25] happens like oh great
[1:04:29] this isn't a sunday school lesson
[1:04:31] because it's gone way beyond our time
[1:04:32] limit
[1:04:34] but you're doing so well and pulling and
[1:04:36] listening i have such a great liberty
[1:04:38] just to continue in john chapter 4 i
[1:04:40] want to go through the story of the
[1:04:41] woman at the well
[1:04:43] verse three i'm going to read to verse
[1:04:44] 34 we'll just try to jump through this
[1:04:46] very quickly
[1:04:46] he left jude and departed again into
[1:04:48] galilee and he must needs go through
[1:04:50] samaria he had he needed to go through
[1:04:52] some area
[1:04:53] not for lunch not because it was a
[1:04:56] good detour because this one had been on
[1:04:58] diners drive-ins and dives
[1:05:00] and it's only an hour out of the way and
[1:05:02] it's going to be worth it so we got to
[1:05:03] go to samaria to eat at that new
[1:05:05] pizza joint then cometh heat of the city
[1:05:08] of samaria which is called cycle
[1:05:10] near the parcel of ground that jacob
[1:05:12] gave to his son joseph
[1:05:14] now jacob's well was there jesus
[1:05:16] therefore being wearied with his journey
[1:05:18] sat thus on the well and it was about
[1:05:21] the sixth hour
[1:05:23] there cometh the woman of samaria to
[1:05:26] draw
[1:05:27] water so jesus is weary he's tired he's
[1:05:30] resting on the well
[1:05:31] now comes a woman with her pot to draw
[1:05:33] water why
[1:05:34] she needs it her house needs it this is
[1:05:37] something you do naturally jesus said to
[1:05:39] her give me to drink
[1:05:40] then it gives us like a little bit of
[1:05:41] background for his disciples or gone
[1:05:43] away
[1:05:43] under the city to that new pizza place
[1:05:45] that had five stars
[1:05:46] the guy fieri had been to so they're
[1:05:49] going into the city they go to the city
[1:05:51] to buy
[1:05:51] meat why it's we need to eat we need to
[1:05:53] have water we need to eat this is the
[1:05:55] need we must do these things
[1:05:56] this is all part of this story these
[1:05:58] natural thirsts for water the natural
[1:05:59] need for meat
[1:06:00] so jesus says give me to drink then save
[1:06:02] the woman of samaria unto him
[1:06:03] how is it that thou being a jew asked
[1:06:05] drink of me which i'm a woman of samaria
[1:06:08] for the jews have no dealings with the
[1:06:10] samaritans so she's thinking very
[1:06:11] strictly
[1:06:12] that i'm a samaritan come to draw water
[1:06:14] you're a jew asking for me to draw water
[1:06:16] for you we don't talk like
[1:06:17] to each other you don't ask me for water
[1:06:19] i don't ask you for water i don't give
[1:06:21] you water you don't give me water
[1:06:22] this is how we roll and then in verse 10
[1:06:27] jesus answered and said unto her and
[1:06:29] again this is where
[1:06:30] just as jesus turned it on him before in
[1:06:32] john chapter six
[1:06:33] he's doing the same thing here they're
[1:06:36] all about that bread and he's like oh
[1:06:38] don't labor for that
[1:06:39] labor for the eternal the things that
[1:06:40] are eternal like wait a minute wait
[1:06:42] i don't need to worry about those things
[1:06:44] if thou knewest the gift of god and who
[1:06:46] it
[1:06:46] is that saith to thee give me to drink
[1:06:49] thou would us have asked of him
[1:06:51] and he would have given thee living
[1:06:52] water in other words if you fully knew
[1:06:54] who was standing before you
[1:06:55] and you weren't just caught up in the
[1:06:57] scene of a weary man at a well
[1:06:59] who you would assume needs water and a
[1:07:01] woman who's coming to the well with a
[1:07:02] pot
[1:07:03] and all these things seem to be aligning
[1:07:04] that the natural thing would be that hey
[1:07:06] let's just get our water and go
[1:07:08] he said if you really knew who this
[1:07:09] weary man was laying up against this
[1:07:11] well
[1:07:12] and why he had need to come to samaria
[1:07:14] this story would get cut
[1:07:16] short and you'd say give me this living
[1:07:19] water
[1:07:21] if you really knew and the woman saith
[1:07:22] unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw
[1:07:25] with and the well is deep from whence
[1:07:27] then hast thou
[1:07:28] that living water well living water to
[1:07:30] her just meant good water
[1:07:32] right this is substance this is what we
[1:07:34] all need this is something we have to
[1:07:35] live by
[1:07:36] water is what will help us have crops
[1:07:39] and water is what it helps us drink and
[1:07:41] water helps us do that and water helps
[1:07:42] us do that
[1:07:43] so she's still in her mind just thinking
[1:07:44] well if you can give me water you're
[1:07:46] going to need something to draw with and
[1:07:47] this is a deep well
[1:07:48] and at this point i don't see anything
[1:07:50] you can use to give me this water
[1:07:52] are you greater than our father jacob
[1:07:54] which gave us the well and drank there
[1:07:56] of himself
[1:07:56] and his children and his cattle well as
[1:07:59] a matter of fact
[1:08:02] right it's like one of those haha got
[1:08:05] you
[1:08:05] she thinks it's kind of it's like a mic
[1:08:07] drop moment and she just burned him
[1:08:09] everything oh
[1:08:09] man she got him oh my goodness she got
[1:08:12] him he's like well yeah as a matter of
[1:08:14] fact
[1:08:15] i am greater than the guy who dug this
[1:08:18] well
[1:08:21] but she's still thinking in terms of
[1:08:22] natural thirst
[1:08:24] she's still thinking in terms of the
[1:08:25] necessities of the flesh i understand
[1:08:27] the logistics here sir
[1:08:29] that if you can give me water you need
[1:08:31] something to draw with and at this point
[1:08:33] i got a pot you don't i win
[1:08:38] so who who needs who and jesus anson
[1:08:41] said unto her whosoever drinketh of this
[1:08:43] water shall thirst again here he is he's
[1:08:45] weary is that the well
[1:08:46] he said think about it ma'am
[1:08:49] if you drink this water you come here
[1:08:51] today at the sixth hour to draw water
[1:08:54] guess where you're going to be tomorrow
[1:08:56] right back here
[1:08:58] six o'clock with the same pot empty
[1:09:02] again
[1:09:02] to get water because if you're only
[1:09:06] chasing this thirst it's a cycle you
[1:09:09] always end up empty
[1:09:11] he says but whosoever drinketh of the
[1:09:12] water that i shall give him
[1:09:14] should never thirst doesn't say you
[1:09:17] won't want more
[1:09:20] he says you'll never thirst but the
[1:09:22] water that i shall give him
[1:09:24] shall be in him a well of water
[1:09:26] springing up into everlasting
[1:09:28] life that if you take of this
[1:09:31] fountain everything changes
[1:09:35] that though you would still need to show
[1:09:37] up at six o'clock
[1:09:39] at a well with an empty pot to get water
[1:09:41] for natural life
[1:09:42] there's something else greater that
[1:09:44] drives man that would be satisfied who
[1:09:46] never has to
[1:09:48] never have to thirst again and let me
[1:09:51] say this with
[1:09:51] with a desire to amplify in a greater
[1:09:54] way let me just say this to challenge
[1:09:57] maybe some of our belief systems but we
[1:09:58] can buy into belief systems that place
[1:10:02] our motivation in a lie
[1:10:05] if you just do this if you just do that
[1:10:09] if you just do these things
[1:10:10] and we take our trust and we put it in
[1:10:12] certain steps and certain disciplines
[1:10:14] certain ideas
[1:10:15] even if we just took the man's hierarchy
[1:10:17] of needs and well i just kind of i need
[1:10:18] to have these needs and these needs and
[1:10:20] these needs and if i could get all these
[1:10:21] things
[1:10:21] and we're always buying into some
[1:10:22] beliefs and some book we read some
[1:10:24] youtube video we watched or something
[1:10:25] that we think holds the secret listen
[1:10:28] christ
[1:10:29] is the secret these
[1:10:32] the principles even that we can uh
[1:10:34] adhere to and the things that we can
[1:10:36] be disciplined in listen there's things
[1:10:38] that we
[1:10:39] there's things that we are told that we
[1:10:41] should do for our own health and there's
[1:10:42] things that we ought to do for our own
[1:10:44] wealth and there's prudent things that
[1:10:45] we should do in a lot of different other
[1:10:46] disciplines
[1:10:47] and i won't say one bad thing about it
[1:10:50] but let me say if you don't have what's
[1:10:52] best
[1:10:52] none of it's good it's christ that's
[1:10:56] gonna give
[1:10:57] anything else meaning it's christ it's
[1:10:59] going to be the force multiplier it's
[1:11:00] christ going to be the one that even
[1:11:01] makes it work
[1:11:06] and maybe that's sometimes what we're
[1:11:08] forgetting
[1:11:10] is we have a god that stands near and
[1:11:12] every time we're like
[1:11:13] well i'm going to try this
[1:11:16] he makes it happen because he wants to
[1:11:19] care for you
[1:11:20] and then we think we just got some kind
[1:11:22] we got magic our kid goes to do
[1:11:24] something
[1:11:25] and we make it happen for them and they
[1:11:26] don't realize we made it happen
[1:11:28] like we're letting them win right
[1:11:32] right guys you always win jack's
[1:11:33] clapping like yeah
[1:11:36] and they think man i i can beat my dad
[1:11:40] like i'm really really good at this and
[1:11:42] you know what
[1:11:43] that's what god does with us all the
[1:11:44] time we think we're smart enough we
[1:11:47] think we were good
[1:11:48] savvy enough we think we figured it out
[1:11:50] we think we made all the right decisions
[1:11:51] and god's like no i'm just going to look
[1:11:52] out after you
[1:12:02] he says i am john chapter 6 verse 35
[1:12:07] i am the bread of life he that cometh to
[1:12:11] me shall never hunger
[1:12:12] and he that believeth on me shall never
[1:12:14] thirst
[1:12:16] if thou knewest the gift of god and he
[1:12:18] who is standing here you would ask me
[1:12:19] for living water well you don't have
[1:12:21] anything to draw with you think you're
[1:12:22] better than jacob well man as a matter
[1:12:24] of fact
[1:12:26] if you got the water i had to give you
[1:12:28] would never thirst again but you would
[1:12:30] be a well of living water
[1:12:32] you would have inside of you everything
[1:12:34] that you need for contentment everything
[1:12:36] you need for satisfaction you actually
[1:12:37] have a source of power deep inside of
[1:12:39] you
[1:12:40] that if it was necessary you could make
[1:12:41] bread
[1:12:43] if it was necessary you could create
[1:12:45] water that's how deep this well runs
[1:12:47] that's how great i am that's how much
[1:12:48] greater i am than jacob
[1:12:51] i don't have to dig it i could create it
[1:12:52] by your own mouth
[1:12:57] so you drink this water you'll never
[1:12:59] thirst again i am the bread of life he
[1:13:01] that come to me shall never hunger he
[1:13:02] that believeth on me shall never thirst
[1:13:04] what kind of bread is this
[1:13:06] think about it what what kind of hunger
[1:13:10] could this be
[1:13:11] is this like they have those pills you
[1:13:13] can take that whatever you taste taste
[1:13:15] sweet
[1:13:17] that's not what he's talking about this
[1:13:18] isn't some kind of gimmick where oh i
[1:13:20] just take a pill it's an appetite
[1:13:21] suppressant i'm not hungry during the
[1:13:22] day
[1:13:23] well how long you be able to do that
[1:13:26] right
[1:13:27] so we know this just is this isn't a
[1:13:28] magic show this isn't some kind of trick
[1:13:30] what kind of hunger is he talking about
[1:13:32] how can the very thing that has framed
[1:13:35] our human existence
[1:13:36] from genesis chapter 3 all of a sudden
[1:13:39] change
[1:13:41] our days are defined by breakfast lunch
[1:13:44] and dinner
[1:13:45] and the snack before we go to bed hey
[1:13:48] this is this is so what are you you
[1:13:50] small meals frequently no i'm three
[1:13:52] meals a day no i do one big one
[1:13:53] we're all identified but what we are
[1:13:55] what we eat
[1:13:57] i i'm all fats and no i'm all carbs and
[1:13:59] i'm i'm this and i'm that
[1:14:00] i mean how could you take something that
[1:14:02] has literally framed human existence
[1:14:05] driven societies been the very the very
[1:14:08] thing is at the forefront of fallen
[1:14:09] man's condition
[1:14:10] and you're going to change all that in a
[1:14:12] moment
[1:14:15] but he's saying that there's a bread of
[1:14:16] life that satisfies the deepest pains
[1:14:18] and hungers of pains of hunger and
[1:14:21] thirst
[1:14:21] of the broken man that's what he's
[1:14:24] saying there's something deeper
[1:14:26] you think you could have bread the rest
[1:14:27] of your life and you'll die happy no
[1:14:29] because you weren't made for that
[1:14:33] so the woman saith unto him when she
[1:14:35] says he says if you drink this water
[1:14:38] verse 15 the woman said to him sir give
[1:14:41] me this water
[1:14:42] that i don't thirst for neither that i
[1:14:44] came to draw
[1:14:45] but i want it
[1:14:49] just like what they said in john chapter
[1:14:51] 6 lord evermore give us this bread
[1:14:55] and she says in a way that well i don't
[1:14:58] really i'm not really
[1:14:59] thirsty for it uh and i didn't come to
[1:15:02] draw it
[1:15:03] but i like what you're saying i mean
[1:15:07] i'll have it she seems sincere i believe
[1:15:11] that she was sincere but to be certain
[1:15:12] that she fully recognizes
[1:15:16] the need that he's referring to watch
[1:15:18] what he says
[1:15:19] jesus saith in her john 4 16 go call thy
[1:15:23] husband and come hither
[1:15:25] oh you say you're not hungry i'm gonna
[1:15:27] show you just how thirsty you've been
[1:15:29] right think about it oh
[1:15:33] oh you're not thirsty
[1:15:37] i'll leave that alone listen to what he
[1:15:40] had what he's about to say
[1:15:41] if you can read it here john chapter 4
[1:15:43] verse 16. go
[1:15:45] call thy husband and come hither she
[1:15:46] just said i'm not thirsty for it i
[1:15:48] didn't come to draw it but give it to me
[1:15:50] the woman answered said i have no
[1:15:52] husband
[1:15:54] jesus said in her thou has well said i
[1:15:56] have no husband
[1:15:57] for thou has had five husbands and the
[1:16:00] guy you're with now
[1:16:03] and he whom thou now hast is not thy
[1:16:05] husband
[1:16:06] in that set us thou truly
[1:16:10] you said you're not thirsty look at your
[1:16:12] life
[1:16:14] look at your life young lady parents
[1:16:16] turned you out as a teenage girl
[1:16:18] and look you've been hungry ever since
[1:16:20] you've been trying to satisfy this
[1:16:22] you thought it could be in that one
[1:16:24] husband you thought it'd be in the next
[1:16:25] you thought it'd be in the next you
[1:16:26] thought it'd be the next you thought
[1:16:27] it'd be the next and you thought you
[1:16:28] know what it's not marriage it's just
[1:16:29] having someone to provide and you've
[1:16:31] been trying to make sure that you had
[1:16:33] water and bread through all these
[1:16:35] different relationships as a young girl
[1:16:37] and you're with the sixth man five
[1:16:39] husbands the one you're with now is not
[1:16:41] your husband
[1:16:41] and you tell me you're not thirsty come
[1:16:44] on somebody
[1:16:46] just to make sure she knew what she was
[1:16:48] asking for he started peeling it back
[1:16:51] saying
[1:16:51] daughter you've been hungry since birth
[1:16:56] you had unfortunate circumstances being
[1:16:58] turned out in the streets as a young
[1:17:00] girl you become a prostitute you've been
[1:17:02] married five times the one you're with
[1:17:03] now is not even your husband
[1:17:04] you've spoke the truth maybe even being
[1:17:06] a little bit evasive but hunger's caused
[1:17:08] this
[1:17:10] your thirst for this waters caused this
[1:17:12] because what have you been wanting
[1:17:14] you've been wanting to lay your head
[1:17:15] down at night happy
[1:17:16] you've been wanting to have a sense of
[1:17:17] peace when you get up in the morning
[1:17:18] you've been wanting able to face the
[1:17:20] face of society not as an outcast and
[1:17:22] not as a prostitute
[1:17:24] you that you can't outrun your past
[1:17:26] you've got the hauntings of five
[1:17:27] husbands
[1:17:27] you've got the estrangement from your
[1:17:29] family the one you're with now you're
[1:17:30] only with them now because you know you
[1:17:32] need bread
[1:17:35] and you say you're not thirsty for this
[1:17:38] you're thirsty
[1:17:39] and then something turns inside of a
[1:17:41] verse 19 the woman sayeth on him
[1:17:43] sir i perceive that thou art a prophet
[1:17:45] she didn't say did you hear my stomach
[1:17:47] growl
[1:17:47] there's something deeper now our
[1:17:49] father's worshipped in this mountain and
[1:17:51] ye say that in jerusalem is the place
[1:17:53] where men ought to worship
[1:17:54] now she's thinking more deeply because
[1:17:57] perception is not a function of her
[1:17:58] belly
[1:17:59] perception something in her feelings and
[1:18:01] her emotions she came to that place that
[1:18:03] day because she was thirsty she was part
[1:18:05] she may have needed water to cook there
[1:18:07] was a natural hunger that brought her to
[1:18:09] the well
[1:18:09] but jesus had needs to come to samaria
[1:18:12] and it had nothing to do with the
[1:18:13] weariness of his flesh it had nothing to
[1:18:15] do with the meat market in sacra
[1:18:16] it had nothing to do with natural hunger
[1:18:18] it had to do with the spiritual hunger
[1:18:20] and the heart of a young girl
[1:18:21] who needed contentment and needed rest
[1:18:24] and wouldn't find it in society wouldn't
[1:18:26] find in the synagogues
[1:18:27] she would only find it in one place at
[1:18:30] that well
[1:18:34] she was thinking more deeply something's
[1:18:36] been quick and now she's thinking
[1:18:37] she was actually kind of making fun of
[1:18:39] him a little bit hey you're a jew i'm a
[1:18:40] samaritan
[1:18:41] knock it off then he makes some kind of
[1:18:44] comment and she's like
[1:18:46] mr big shot here you think you're bigger
[1:18:48] than jacob
[1:18:49] but now the tone's changing wait a
[1:18:52] minute
[1:18:53] all right i was playing a little cute
[1:18:55] with you when i said i don't have a
[1:18:56] husband
[1:18:57] but then you just got real this
[1:19:00] escalated quickly
[1:19:02] because you just called me out on the
[1:19:04] fact that i've had five and the one i'm
[1:19:05] with now is not my husband and you just
[1:19:06] told me i was telling the truth even
[1:19:07] though i was really kind of trying to
[1:19:08] blow you off and jesus says unto her
[1:19:12] woman
[1:19:13] verse 21 believe me the hour cometh when
[1:19:16] you shall neither end this mountain or
[1:19:17] at jerusalem worship the father
[1:19:19] you worship you know not what we know
[1:19:21] you what what we know what we worship
[1:19:23] for the salvation
[1:19:23] of the jews now he's kind of really
[1:19:25] dishonored as a samaritan but the hour
[1:19:27] cometh and now is when the true
[1:19:28] worshipers shall worship the father in
[1:19:30] spirit and in truth
[1:19:32] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:19:34] him
[1:19:36] he said he must needs go through
[1:19:38] samaritan samaria
[1:19:40] whose need was he meeting
[1:19:44] father's hunger he needs he desires the
[1:19:48] father seek if he craves he's hungry
[1:19:50] for true worshipers god is a spirit and
[1:19:52] they that worship him must worship him
[1:19:54] in spirit and truth
[1:19:55] the woman said to him i know now this is
[1:19:57] getting deep
[1:19:58] i know that messiah cometh which is
[1:20:01] called christ
[1:20:02] when he has come he will tell us all
[1:20:04] things
[1:20:06] something about what he had to say made
[1:20:07] her get think you know what
[1:20:09] you're right you know i might have been
[1:20:11] sarcastic about jews and samaritans
[1:20:13] i i might have been sarcastic about
[1:20:15] jacob i might have been like well i'm
[1:20:16] not thirsty for this water neither did i
[1:20:18] come to draw but if you've got something
[1:20:19] i'll take it
[1:20:20] and i and i say that i perceive you're a
[1:20:23] prophet but i know i know these things
[1:20:25] that you're saying now
[1:20:26] has uncovered a desire deep inside of me
[1:20:29] and a longing in the craving that even i
[1:20:31] know as a samaritan that my redemption
[1:20:33] and my deliverance from bondage will be
[1:20:34] when he comes
[1:20:35] and jesus saith unto her i that speak
[1:20:38] unto thee
[1:20:39] am he
[1:20:45] and the story all of a sudden interjects
[1:20:47] this and upon this came his disciples
[1:20:49] and marveled
[1:20:50] that he talked with the woman see
[1:20:53] they weren't free from the prejudice
[1:20:58] they probably thought that jesus had
[1:21:00] needs to go by samaria
[1:21:01] because this butcher shop and cycler was
[1:21:04] not too far away
[1:21:05] and we and jacob's well i mean we've
[1:21:07] read the reviews about jacob's well
[1:21:09] right it's worth a stop and they walk up
[1:21:12] what is he doing why is he talking to
[1:21:14] this woman
[1:21:16] yet no man said what seekest thou or why
[1:21:19] talk is thou with her
[1:21:21] no one questioned them but they all said
[1:21:22] it in their hearts
[1:21:25] and as they walk up skeptical
[1:21:28] because they know what kind of woman
[1:21:29] this is who would be there at that time
[1:21:30] of day getting water
[1:21:32] like jesus come on
[1:21:35] that's his name they weren't using it in
[1:21:37] vain they're like jesus do you realize
[1:21:39] who you're talking to
[1:21:40] this doesn't look good we go to get some
[1:21:42] meat and this is what's happening
[1:21:44] and just that it's so natural it's so
[1:21:46] carnal so
[1:21:47] shallow and at this very moment he has
[1:21:50] just said i
[1:21:50] that speak unto thee am he and verse 28
[1:21:54] the woman then left her water pot
[1:21:58] she had just carried this thing to a
[1:22:00] well
[1:22:01] for one reason to get water in order to
[1:22:03] live to satisfy a natural thirst
[1:22:05] she left it went her way into the city
[1:22:08] and as a woman that was a reproach
[1:22:10] an outcast estranged from her family
[1:22:12] turned out on the street
[1:22:13] five living husbands and with the men
[1:22:15] now that wasn't her husband
[1:22:16] she had enough boldness to go into the
[1:22:18] city and say come see a man
[1:22:20] which told me all things that i've ever
[1:22:22] did is not this the christ
[1:22:27] something had been shed away something
[1:22:29] had been washed away
[1:22:30] and she was no longer ashamed to stand
[1:22:33] upon
[1:22:34] something that she knew and it wasn't
[1:22:36] her lies and cards
[1:22:37] well this happened and that happened and
[1:22:39] this happened and that happened and it
[1:22:40] wasn't about jew or samaritan it wasn't
[1:22:42] about jacob and it wasn't about wells
[1:22:43] and it wasn't about me
[1:22:44] it was come see the christ
[1:22:48] come see the christ that satisfied
[1:22:50] something in my heart
[1:22:51] i've never felt free like this i've
[1:22:53] never felt satisfied
[1:22:54] i can never face you people of the city
[1:22:57] and tell you here's the messiah
[1:22:59] because i was ashamed i was a reproach i
[1:23:01] was sinful but now
[1:23:02] forgiven and set free come see a man
[1:23:06] then they went out of the city and
[1:23:08] followed her
[1:23:11] not because she was they were promised
[1:23:12] bread
[1:23:14] not because they were promised a miracle
[1:23:17] but because there was someone who could
[1:23:19] tell them who they were
[1:23:23] brother branham says in the message the
[1:23:24] mighty god unveiled before us
[1:23:27] referring to this story now what did
[1:23:29] this this i
[1:23:30] would just i'd like to emphasize this
[1:23:34] to you and then
[1:23:38] amplify it later next week lord willing
[1:23:43] what did this he says put in the old
[1:23:46] scripture
[1:23:48] with the experience that jesus was
[1:23:49] giving to her
[1:23:52] he's taken the prom prophecies of the
[1:23:53] word and what she was experiencing at
[1:23:56] the moment
[1:23:58] what did it do it made the messiah
[1:24:08] what's been written and prophesied
[1:24:11] had now dovetailed with what she was
[1:24:13] experiencing
[1:24:15] and now the word was being quickened
[1:24:19] made alive and what did it produce
[1:24:22] the messiah what she knew would come one
[1:24:26] day
[1:24:27] what she was longing for one day it made
[1:24:29] the messiah and did you notice quickly
[1:24:31] her sins were forgiven
[1:24:33] because at the beginning she was
[1:24:35] redeemable
[1:24:38] nothing she had done in her 20 years
[1:24:40] nothing she had done
[1:24:42] in those young few years that she had
[1:24:43] lived that that wasn't what identified
[1:24:45] her that's not what qualified her
[1:24:47] that's not what gave her entrance into
[1:24:49] the club that's not what made her a
[1:24:50] candidate at the well
[1:24:51] she didn't have the the linkedin profile
[1:24:53] that that that had the headhunter look
[1:24:55] her up and say hey i got a meeting with
[1:24:56] jesus today if you think you
[1:24:58] if you think you can make it no this is
[1:24:59] something that was connected with
[1:25:01] something at the beginning she was
[1:25:03] redeemable
[1:25:04] because she was in god's thinking at the
[1:25:05] beginning so it
[1:25:07] what was it the written word and her ex
[1:25:10] what she was experiencing
[1:25:12] what she was seeing what she was feeling
[1:25:14] this this piece that she was
[1:25:15] experiencing
[1:25:16] the layers that were being uncovered it
[1:25:18] was the fulfillment of the word of god
[1:25:20] it made the messiah it revealed the son
[1:25:22] of man to her
[1:25:23] and quickly she's new she's made free
[1:25:26] she's forgiven
[1:25:27] why did that happen because all along
[1:25:29] she was redeemable
[1:25:32] all along she had a quality and a
[1:25:34] characteristic that was not just
[1:25:36] driven by a thirsty flesh she i have to
[1:25:38] have a husband i need to be taken
[1:25:40] care of no you only did those things
[1:25:42] because
[1:25:43] deep down inside of you you were
[1:25:45] redeemable
[1:25:47] and you ran this way and you ran that
[1:25:49] way and you tried to do this
[1:25:50] and you tried to do that and join this
[1:25:51] and join that but at the end of the day
[1:25:53] there was only one that would satisfy
[1:25:55] and that was an experience that would
[1:25:57] take what was written
[1:25:59] and make the messiah she was redeemable
[1:26:03] so it redeemed her and brought her back
[1:26:06] when she seen the express scripture
[1:26:08] manifested of jehovah
[1:26:09] what he was what he is
[1:26:14] hallelujah think very deeply very
[1:26:17] spiritually saints
[1:26:19] could you not just think that's exactly
[1:26:22] i believe that god is dealing with
[1:26:23] hearts to know this to see this to
[1:26:26] experience this
[1:26:27] but could we who've had this could we
[1:26:29] not
[1:26:30] praise him yes that's what's happened to
[1:26:33] me
[1:26:34] the word i read as a child the things i
[1:26:36] heard as a young man
[1:26:38] one day one day i experienced it
[1:26:41] and it made the messiah
[1:26:44] this is not this was not man this was
[1:26:46] not a meal that my mother prepared it's
[1:26:48] not a sermon my dad
[1:26:50] preached but it was the word written
[1:26:52] beforehand coming to a redeemable son
[1:26:54] and it made the messiah
[1:26:58] and it made me free
[1:27:03] this is what the prostitute did
[1:27:08] and then when god when jesus did the
[1:27:09] very things in john chapter 6 to the
[1:27:11] religious and the
[1:27:13] and the upright and the pious it says
[1:27:15] the jews then murmured at him and said
[1:27:18] because he said i am the bread which
[1:27:20] came down from heaven
[1:27:21] and they said is not this jesus the son
[1:27:24] of joseph whose father and mother we
[1:27:25] know
[1:27:26] how is it then that he saith i am come
[1:27:28] down from heaven
[1:27:29] the most religious the most pious the
[1:27:31] most put together people
[1:27:34] see the same gift and one calls it
[1:27:37] beelzebub
[1:27:39] one rejects it and the other one who
[1:27:42] looks far from redeemable
[1:27:45] is the one that makes the messiah says
[1:27:46] come see a man
[1:27:49] there wasn't a hunger for redemption in
[1:27:52] those others
[1:27:53] as they sat there and saw at mavis there
[1:27:55] was no desire awakened
[1:27:58] and listen as i speak to you today i've
[1:28:00] been an hour and a half today already
[1:28:02] as i speak to you now i'm not reasoning
[1:28:05] with your mind
[1:28:08] i'm probing your heart
[1:28:11] i'm not trying to get up in your head's
[1:28:13] face and use logic
[1:28:15] i'm wanting to use scripture
[1:28:18] to peel back layers to where you sit
[1:28:21] there and you realize you're at a well
[1:28:23] today
[1:28:25] and there's word that's being read and
[1:28:27] you start to experience something
[1:28:29] and all of a sudden it makes a messiah
[1:28:32] who's welcoming you
[1:28:33] home who's saying
[1:28:36] it doesn't matter what you've done i'll
[1:28:39] take you from here don't be worried
[1:28:42] about what the future holds what about
[1:28:43] this what about that
[1:28:44] i'll take care of you hungry
[1:28:52] hungry for more than what you've
[1:28:54] experienced
[1:28:59] a hunger for more than what you felt
[1:29:02] hunger for peace think about all those
[1:29:09] thresholds right
[1:29:12] when i get there it'll smooth out
[1:29:16] right we always thought if i could just
[1:29:20] get there
[1:29:21] and it's never there
[1:29:28] the bible says in psalm 42 as the heart
[1:29:30] pantheth after the water brooks
[1:29:34] so my soul panteth after the o god
[1:29:38] panting heart this is a strong a panting
[1:29:40] hardest
[1:29:44] it's an audible thirst it's not hey
[1:29:47] would you like a red bull yeah i think
[1:29:48] i'll take i can take a red bull
[1:29:50] you'll want arnold palmer they're like a
[1:29:51] buck over here at salad to go you want
[1:29:53] one yeah yeah i'll take one
[1:29:54] yeah i got some room for it no this is
[1:29:58] your tongue is cleaving to the roof of
[1:30:00] your mouth you it's a matter of life or
[1:30:02] death it's a motivating force it's a
[1:30:04] painful desire
[1:30:10] as the woman ran away it says in the
[1:30:14] meantime while his disciples pray
[1:30:16] prayed him saying in the meantime while
[1:30:19] his disciples prayed him saying master
[1:30:20] eat come on master we went and got meat
[1:30:24] eat time to eat but he said to them i
[1:30:26] have meat to eat you know not of
[1:30:32] what he was just telling the woman from
[1:30:33] samaritan samaritan
[1:30:35] he's still trying to get his disciples
[1:30:37] to realize it
[1:30:38] therefore say if the disciples one to
[1:30:40] another if any man brought him ought to
[1:30:42] eat
[1:30:44] they're still literally thinking who
[1:30:46] gave him a cheesesteak
[1:30:50] like which one of you snuck up judas did
[1:30:53] you do doordash i mean like we're over
[1:30:55] here
[1:30:56] standing in line trying to get our food
[1:31:00] and you're over there ordering in
[1:31:02] they're literally asking i say literally
[1:31:04] but they're asking the question
[1:31:05] hey who gave him meat because they're
[1:31:09] still thinking in this realm
[1:31:10] when he says i got meat that you know
[1:31:12] not of they're not instinctively saying
[1:31:14] that's true lord that's true that's
[1:31:17] right
[1:31:18] we need to be start we need to be
[1:31:19] thinking more spiritual we need to think
[1:31:20] beyond
[1:31:21] what this flesh craves and wants and
[1:31:22] what would look good for this flesh he's
[1:31:24] jesus said them
[1:31:25] my meat is to do the will of him that
[1:31:27] sent me and to finish his work
[1:31:29] i've got something else to live by i've
[1:31:33] got something else to live for
[1:31:35] i'm not just living to know where i'm
[1:31:37] gonna eat my next meal
[1:31:39] i'm not like some of you who are talking
[1:31:40] about where you're gonna eat breakfast
[1:31:42] while you're eating dinner i've got
[1:31:44] something else i need to do
[1:31:45] you guys came this way so you could go
[1:31:47] to that butcher shop in cycle
[1:31:49] i came over here because god needed a
[1:31:51] true worshiper
[1:31:52] and we found one that's what he's saying
[1:31:55] i have a job to do
[1:31:57] my meek my substance where i have a
[1:31:59] different drive
[1:32:00] i have a different motivator in my
[1:32:02] hierarchy of needs i've got a base and a
[1:32:04] foundation
[1:32:05] and i've got one pyramid one food
[1:32:07] pyramid and it's do what the father
[1:32:09] wants me to do
[1:32:10] that's what i want to do that's my meat
[1:32:12] that's my motivator that's my force just
[1:32:14] as job
[1:32:15] belt out i have esteemed the words of
[1:32:17] god
[1:32:18] more than my necessary food that's the
[1:32:21] very heart of the messiah
[1:32:22] saying i live by what god wants me to do
[1:32:25] i'm sir
[1:32:26] i survive i thrive i'm fulfilled i'm
[1:32:29] happy
[1:32:30] not by having bread in my belly but by
[1:32:32] doing that which pleases god
[1:32:40] we live in a time when only christ will
[1:32:42] satisfy
[1:32:43] the redeemable i i
[1:32:46] i i'm going to leave off some scriptures
[1:32:48] here
[1:32:49] but i want to emphasize that we can pick
[1:32:51] this up at another time
[1:32:52] this is a time in an hour let me say
[1:32:54] this to everyone who will hear my voice
[1:32:57] though you as the redeemable are living
[1:33:00] in a season where only christ is going
[1:33:02] to satisfy it
[1:33:03] it's it we we've we've advanced and come
[1:33:06] to the place now
[1:33:07] where it's no you cannot play games you
[1:33:09] can't fiddle around you can't fool with
[1:33:11] this
[1:33:11] it's something that you've got to come
[1:33:13] to a place to recognize
[1:33:15] this is what god is doing this is what
[1:33:17] it means this is what it's for
[1:33:19] i in this desire and hunger i have in my
[1:33:21] heart is
[1:33:22] only going to be satisfied by the word
[1:33:27] i i say with great carefulness
[1:33:31] god could give you a different disease
[1:33:32] every day and heal you every afternoon
[1:33:36] and that would be awesome wouldn't it
[1:33:40] i guess the afternoons would be we would
[1:33:42] dread the mornings
[1:33:45] but oh miracle miracle miracle miracle
[1:33:47] milk miracle but if it's not the word if
[1:33:49] you're not coming to the word if the
[1:33:51] word's not
[1:33:51] if you're not saying if there's a god
[1:33:53] that can not only get me sick but heal
[1:33:55] it every day
[1:33:56] then can't there be a god that can lift
[1:33:58] me up above every challenge
[1:34:00] is there not a god is he not a god that
[1:34:02] can take the very specter of death
[1:34:04] and place it under my feet they let it
[1:34:07] mature me let it grow me let it let me
[1:34:09] take this
[1:34:10] desire this this these instances of
[1:34:12] healing
[1:34:13] if i was to be made sick and healed then
[1:34:15] audit not inspire me to run into the
[1:34:18] city
[1:34:18] and say come taste a word that can heal
[1:34:24] not inviting people to a church
[1:34:26] experience
[1:34:29] but an opportunity to make the messiah
[1:34:35] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:34:37] thirst
[1:34:38] after righteousness
[1:34:42] for they shall be filled
[1:34:48] blessed are they matthew chapter five
[1:34:50] verse six blessed are they
[1:34:54] which do hunger and thirst
[1:34:58] it's a desperate hunger jesus saying
[1:35:01] you're hungry for it if you're really
[1:35:04] thirsty for it
[1:35:06] it's not you know if your number's
[1:35:08] called you
[1:35:10] shall it's desperate
[1:35:15] this word righteousness has a very deep
[1:35:17] meaning
[1:35:21] but it's being in this state that you
[1:35:22] ought to be
[1:35:24] real you understand that righteousness
[1:35:28] is man being in this state as he ought
[1:35:30] to be
[1:35:32] now instead of in your mind thinking
[1:35:35] that righteousness is a certain length
[1:35:36] of skirt
[1:35:37] certain length of hair certain standard
[1:35:39] in the home and we start thinking about
[1:35:41] all the metrics by which
[1:35:42] we measure clothesline gospel
[1:35:45] and what we think the token is and what
[1:35:46] holiness is those things are what they
[1:35:48] are
[1:35:50] but at the end of the day it's not those
[1:35:52] things
[1:35:54] it's being what you're ought to be
[1:35:58] that's what you're hungry for blessed is
[1:36:01] he who hungers and thirsts
[1:36:04] for being what he ought to be
[1:36:08] who desires to be who he really is
[1:36:13] musicians come please
[1:36:17] are you desperate for peace
[1:36:22] do you have a painful desire
[1:36:28] to find yourself
[1:36:36] hungry
[1:36:38] in luke chapter 15 jesus tells the
[1:36:40] parable
[1:36:42] of what we call the prodigal son
[1:36:47] prodigal's a word that we've added
[1:36:51] it's not in the scripture he's not
[1:36:52] referred to as the prodigal in the
[1:36:53] scripture
[1:36:55] but rather it's the description that we
[1:36:57] give him
[1:36:59] because he was wasteful he took his
[1:37:02] inheritance and he wasted it
[1:37:09] and he goes and joins us becomes a
[1:37:11] citizen of a strange country he's a
[1:37:13] slave he's a servant
[1:37:15] he's given a job of feeding
[1:37:19] the pigs of corn
[1:37:23] and he found himself of necessity
[1:37:28] so hungry and without food
[1:37:32] that he would eat the pig's food
[1:37:35] and it was this is the miracle of this
[1:37:37] story the
[1:37:39] the dawn the beginning of this miracle
[1:37:41] in his redemption
[1:37:44] he would have died of hunger
[1:37:48] and he's there wrestling with the pangs
[1:37:52] of hunger
[1:37:53] and to satisfy this in his belly
[1:37:58] he's wanting to eat
[1:38:02] pig's food
[1:38:05] something happens and he thinks about
[1:38:09] something else
[1:38:11] and all of a sudden for a moment he
[1:38:12] wakes up
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:14] and it says then when he came to himself
[1:38:18] how sweet that must have tasted
[1:38:21] when he remembered who he was i'm not a
[1:38:24] slave
[1:38:26] not a servant to this and he realized
[1:38:31] that even if he went back to his
[1:38:33] father's house as a servant
[1:38:36] it'd be better than what this was
[1:38:40] when he came to himself he said how many
[1:38:42] hired servants of my fathers
[1:38:44] have bread enough and to spare
[1:38:48] and i perish with hunger
[1:38:53] and then he came to himself and he was
[1:38:56] that that began to satisfy that that was
[1:38:59] a taste that was a hunger
[1:39:02] and he was hungry enough to act
[1:39:06] he was hungry enough to say work past
[1:39:08] his brother's objections
[1:39:10] this guy you're gonna let him come back
[1:39:12] to church
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:15] he was hungry enough to overcome his
[1:39:17] father's objections you've wasted all my
[1:39:18] inheritance why would i have you back
[1:39:20] he already knew he said father i know
[1:39:22] i'm not even worthy brother you're right
[1:39:24] i'm not even worthy i'm not coming back
[1:39:26] because i want anything back because i
[1:39:29] want a position i'm just coming back
[1:39:30] i'll be a servant i just want to eat and
[1:39:34] i know that you treat your servants well
[1:39:36] i'm coming back
[1:39:37] his hunger put him on the road back
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:41] but what did he find redemption
[1:39:45] he didn't come back as a servant he
[1:39:46] didn't eat as a servant of the servant's
[1:39:48] table what did his father say come
[1:39:50] put on the best meal give him a robe
[1:39:53] let's put on a face for this my son
[1:39:55] which was dead
[1:39:57] is alive what did that
[1:40:01] hunger

[1:40:20] just ponder these things
[1:40:22] [Music]
[1:40:28] this was directed at someone who's
[1:40:31] ordained to crave god

[1:40:39] it's a matter of life
[1:40:42] [Music]

[1:42:15] don't know that i came to draw this but

[1:44:12] like myself i don't even feel like i
[1:44:14] belong
[1:44:16] lift up your eyes to the one who speaks
[1:44:18] to you today
[1:44:20] say oh god if you're real oh god if

[1:44:28] lord
[1:44:30] satisfy this longing deep within my
[1:44:33] person
[1:44:35] psychiatrists couldn't do it
[1:44:37] psychologists couldn't do it
[1:44:40] pursuits haven't done it accomplishments
[1:44:42] have not
[1:44:43] allayed my fears or quenched this hunger
[1:44:47] lord i've come to church today
[1:44:51] for a lot of other reasons maybe but now
[1:44:56] now something's making a messiah
[1:45:00] and i'm hungry for that oh god i pray
[1:45:03] for those
[1:45:04] standing for more of you that you would
[1:45:06] so
[1:45:09] take this hunger and energize it that it
[1:45:12] would become
[1:45:14] the greatest motivator and their chief
[1:45:16] appetite
[1:45:18] i pray lord you take those who've stood
[1:45:20] in their
[1:45:21] initial response to this
[1:45:24] this hunger that they have now lord i
[1:45:27] realize that for some
[1:45:29] it would not be just knowing you
[1:45:31] initially are just giving their heart to
[1:45:32] you but
[1:45:33] something has stirred within the heart
[1:45:35] of these individuals
[1:45:37] and they stood as one who would say lord
[1:45:40] give me this bread
[1:45:42] lord give me this meat lord give me this
[1:45:45] water
[1:45:47] and it would not be measured in calories
[1:45:48] lord would not be measured in weight
[1:45:50] loss it would be something
[1:45:52] of spiritual significance
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:55] he said lord i've been thirsty i've made
[1:45:57] mistakes i've run i've hit i've tried
[1:46:00] i've
[1:46:01] cried i realized now it's been all along
[1:46:05] because i was hungry
[1:46:08] thank god that we could attribute all of
[1:46:12] our detours to the fact that we were
[1:46:14] redeemable
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:17] and they were detours because we could
[1:46:19] never continue down that path we had to
[1:46:22] come back to this
[1:46:24] at this well today i say lord i will
[1:46:27] come to you
[1:46:28] with an open heart to receive you i may
[1:46:31] not know anything else other than to
[1:46:33] raise my hands or to say lord i love you
[1:46:35] or god help me
[1:46:36] or just to cry out the name jesus but
[1:46:38] here we are today lord
[1:46:40] hungry hungry
[1:46:44] hands lifted and hearts open
