[0:01] we're going to be on the subject of the
[0:03] house of the Lord I don't know just
[0:05] exactly how much time we may spend on
[0:07] this as I was studying last week and
[0:10] preparing I just felt like well maybe
[0:11] maybe it's just a couple and uh we won't
[0:14] get enough distance out of this nice
[0:15] graphic that I put together but if we're
[0:18] just wanting to look at the subject of
[0:19] the house of the Lord I find myself uh
[0:23] looking at a lot of different types and
[0:24] shadows a lot of things that we've
[0:25] already ministered from here a lot of
[0:27] things that we already know from being
[0:28] well taught and instead of just maybe
[0:33] digging in deep on these different
[0:34] things uh and just set laying a
[0:36] foundation of a lot of services on the
[0:38] house of the Lord I kind of want to just
[0:40] look at the house of the Lord and then
[0:41] look at how we would look at it today
[0:43] and what it means to us today and so
[0:45] that it's more applicable and re
[0:47] relevant to us I find as I'm looking at
[0:50] these things that there's a kind of a
[0:52] this is a continuation of the Kingdom
[0:53] series uh some of those same principles
[0:55] and Concepts we'll be revisiting them
[0:58] and I find that the the word has been
[1:00] preached so anything that you preach
[1:01] you're revisiting it and I don't want to
[1:03] have too much of a complex where I feel
[1:05] that I'm just repeating myself uh but I
[1:08] do think there's a lot of things that we
[1:09] repeat for the sake of emphasis uh to
[1:12] highlight something to underline it and
[1:13] say this is something that was
[1:14] ministered quite frequently in the
[1:16] message of the hour this is a constant
[1:18] theme we see in the scripture and so
[1:21] it's something that we would even have a
[1:22] duty to emphasize ourselves so there's a
[1:25] lot of things in this that you'll find
[1:26] familiar but I'm trusting that it really
[1:28] speaks to you in a personal way
[1:30] and my title today is the place to seek
[1:33] him I I think originally I had it as a
[1:36] place to seek him and then I realized oh
[1:37] well I don't want to imply that there's
[1:39] just a bunch of ways you can find him
[1:41] but there's a place that you can find
[1:43] him and it's the place to seek him and
[1:46] that's what we want to focus on today
[1:49] now as you look at Psalms chapter
[1:52] 27:4 and we focused on this Wednesday
[1:54] night and we preached on one thing
[1:57] desired he says one thing that I have
[1:59] desired of the Lord that will I seek
[2:00] after that I may dwell in the house of
[2:03] the Lord all the days of my life to
[2:06] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[2:08] inquire in his Temple so this is that
[2:11] phrase the house of the Lord now he's
[2:14] already made references to it in the way
[2:15] what we've read about already using
[2:17] different words and terminologies for it
[2:19] but when we use the house of the Lord
[2:21] It's referring to this place that David
[2:22] is thinking about and for David this was
[2:25] a very precise and specific place it
[2:28] wasn't when he said it everyone didn't
[2:30] kind of conjure up in their idea oh I
[2:32] have my house you have your house and
[2:34] there's these many different houses of
[2:36] the Lord when David said the house of
[2:38] the Lord he's thinking of a very
[2:40] specific place and he calls it his
[2:43] Temple so it's the Lord's Temple it's
[2:45] the palace where God is King it's a
[2:47] sanctuary a place that's dedicated it's
[2:49] a holy place in Psalms 268 it says Lord
[2:53] I have loved the habitation of thy house
[2:56] the dwelling what it is what it
[2:58] represents and the the place where thine
[3:01] honor dwelleth so David talks about his
[3:04] Temple the house of the Lord and his
[3:06] Tabernacle it's the place where the
[3:07] shakina glory rests you're not going to
[3:10] find the shakina glory just anywhere is
[3:12] what he he knew he's not going to be
[3:13] manifesting himself just anywhere but it
[3:15] was a place where God it pleased God to
[3:18] make himself known and we could find a
[3:20] lot of things in the scripture and the
[3:21] message of the hour to bring that out
[3:23] but if we look in first Kings chapter 8
[3:26] we'll find that what happened in the
[3:28] Tabernacle the one in of the Wilderness
[3:30] the one that traveled the one that was
[3:32] the sole place where they would
[3:33] sacrifice and meet God that when a
[3:35] temple was built and Solomon is
[3:37] dedicating this Temple and all the
[3:38] priests are performing their service it
[3:41] says in First Kings 8: 10 and 11 and it
[3:44] came to pass when the priest were come
[3:46] out of the Holy place that the cloud
[3:48] filled the house of the Lord so that the
[3:51] priest could not stand to minister
[3:53] because of the cloud for the glory of
[3:55] the Lord had filled the house of the
[3:57] Lord this is what makes this place so
[4:00] significant is you weren't finding this
[4:03] anywhere else it was within this
[4:04] structure within this Arrangement this
[4:06] Arrangement that God had detailed and
[4:08] God had expressed to them that this is
[4:10] where the glory of the Lord fills the it
[4:13] fills up the room and so this is called
[4:15] the house of the Lord because the glory
[4:17] of the Lord fills it up you can't just
[4:19] put up a box and call it the house of
[4:21] the Lord if God doesn't come visit it if
[4:23] God's not identified with it so the
[4:25] glory of the Lord filled it and that's
[4:27] how it became to be known the house of
[4:29] the Lord God Vindicated it his presence
[4:31] was there and David's attitude towards
[4:34] this is so great that he says in verse 5
[4:37] of Psalm 27 for in the time of trouble
[4:40] now I trust that God will give me the
[4:41] grace to minister all the things that I
[4:43] have in front of me today uh that we've
[4:45] put together for this service and this
[4:49] idea of being in trouble being in need
[4:51] comes out quite a bit in some of the
[4:53] things we're going to be reading for in
[4:54] the time of trouble he shall hide me now
[4:58] this is a a remark able note here he
[5:01] says to hide me in his Pavilion in the
[5:04] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[5:06] me he shall set me up upon a rock David
[5:10] is being very poetic very descriptive in
[5:12] the time of trouble he's going to hide
[5:14] me in his Pavilion and then he says it's
[5:16] in the secret of his Tabernacle he shall
[5:18] set me up upon a rock all these
[5:20] terminologies are describing the house
[5:22] of the Lord he shall hide me in his
[5:25] Pavilion it's also translated to
[5:27] Tabernacle in other places it speaks of
[5:28] a den or a booth a covert a place of
[5:32] protection he shall hide me in the
[5:34] secret of his Tabernacle that word is
[5:36] translated to tent because it refers to
[5:38] a dwelling a home or a habitation this
[5:41] these are the things that the language
[5:43] that's being used this Den this booth
[5:45] this Co covering this dwelling this
[5:48] habitation and he calls it a secret
[5:51] because he going to be hid that's a
[5:52] covering a shelter a hiding place
[5:54] protection it means to be concealed or
[5:57] hidden uh to hide carefully so David
[6:00] knows that in the house of the Lord
[6:02] there's protection he knows in the house
[6:04] of the Lord there's covering and we we
[6:06] say he says in the secret of his
[6:08] Tabernacle it's it wouldn't necessarily
[6:11] imply that nobody knows where the
[6:13] Tabernacle is or knows what the
[6:14] Tabernacle does and wouldn't know that
[6:16] he's in it but there's something about
[6:18] it where he's hid he's safe there's a
[6:19] protection to it and it calls it here as
[6:23] we read that I want to inquire to seek
[6:25] the Lord in verse four he tells us that
[6:27] it's going to be I want to behold the
[6:29] beauty of the Lord so the temple the
[6:32] house of the Lord is a place of God's
[6:34] Beauty his kindness his pleasantness
[6:37] it's a place of his favor it speaks of
[6:40] it means to be beautiful to be sweet to
[6:42] be lovely that's what the house of the
[6:44] Lord is it's lovely it's sweet it's
[6:46] beautiful and he says that that I may
[6:49] inquire in his Temple so it's a place of
[6:53] inquiry it's a place to inquire a place
[6:55] to seek it means to consider reflect or
[6:58] as we like to say here Ponder and this
[7:00] is that place that's describing this is
[7:02] the way to describe the house of the
[7:04] Lord it's a it's a pavilion it's a it's
[7:07] a tabernacle it's a place of God's
[7:09] Beauty it's a place to reflect it's a
[7:11] place to consider it's the place to seek
[7:13] him to inquire in his Temple so when
[7:16] you're there in this place it's a place
[7:18] to seek him to ponder yourself to
[7:20] reflect on things to think about the
[7:22] future and there's a lot of other ways
[7:24] that we could describe this but these
[7:26] are defining characteristics of the
[7:28] house of the Lord
[7:30] and this is the place that David sought
[7:32] above all else it was the one thing
[7:34] desired for him and all the things that
[7:36] go with it it was the habitation he says
[7:38] that he loved it was a place of God's
[7:40] presence it's the place of God's
[7:42] protection as David is saying it's a
[7:44] place of God's provision because you
[7:45] inquired to receive so these are the
[7:47] things that describe the house of the
[7:50] Lord now I had still wrestling even up
[7:53] to the moment that we left to come to
[7:55] church today on just where to stop and
[7:57] I'm not thinking about stopping right
[7:59] here unless I get a lot of encouragement
[8:00] to do so uh a lot of bribes or something
[8:04] all oh man maybe we should open up the
[8:06] floor we get just start auctioning off
[8:08] the stop time uh set up a gofund me
[8:11] someone real
[8:12] quick I'm just not sure which direction
[8:14] to go and I'd already took out just a
[8:16] bunch of notes here already so I'm going
[8:18] to be skipping brother John a little bit
[8:21] uh to 2 Chronicles but this house that
[8:23] David desired I want to approach it from
[8:25] this angle for just a little bit it was
[8:28] not in heaven it's located in Jerusalem
[8:31] and know for some of you you're probably
[8:33] thinking well I don't know that that
[8:34] needed to be stated but I think it's
[8:36] good to recognize David's attitude
[8:38] towards something and how that its
[8:40] location was in Jerusalem one thing have
[8:43] I desired of the Lord and David's
[8:45] attitude in the midst of trials in the
[8:46] midst of difficulties he says I want to
[8:48] be there now this is I think this is a
[8:51] good point because we kind of have this
[8:54] and I want to be very careful kind of
[8:55] walking this tight tight rope and this
[8:58] is how I feel like I can call back back
[8:59] to the series on the kingdom we know we
[9:01] want to get out of this world but we're
[9:03] coming back to this world and we know
[9:05] that we want to leave uh uh uh because
[9:08] we want to go meet the Lord in the air
[9:10] but that's because it's according to a
[9:12] promise and a prophecy that's what's
[9:13] next and yet David here with the next
[9:17] promise he had of a messiah coming is
[9:19] not saying oh my enemies are about me my
[9:21] Kingdom's in danger I just want to go
[9:23] home I just want to die I've had enough
[9:27] that wasn't David's attitude I David's
[9:30] attitude is I I this is the place that I
[9:32] desire this is the place that I long to
[9:34] be it says in 2 Chronicles chapter 3
[9:37] verse one I want to nail this down very
[9:39] clearly that David is not referring to a
[9:41] place in heaven that he wants to be we
[9:43] can't say well David wanted to be at
[9:45] that temple in heaven he wanted to be in
[9:46] that Tabernacle in heaven he's talking
[9:48] about the temple in Jerusalem says then
[9:51] Solomon began to build the house of the
[9:53] Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah where
[9:57] the Lord appeared unto David his father
[9:59] in the place that David had prepared in
[10:01] the threshing floor of Orin the jebusite
[10:04] the word Mariah means chosen by Jehovah
[10:07] there's a very special place it's the
[10:09] place where that God led Abraham to or
[10:12] showed Abraham when he offered up Isaac
[10:14] in Genesis 22 this was a special
[10:17] Mountain this has special significance
[10:19] to the people of Israel special
[10:20] significance to these Jews and this
[10:23] house that David desired the house of
[10:25] the Lord was built at Jerusalem in Mount
[10:29] this very specific location so when
[10:31] David says one thing have I desired of
[10:33] the Lord that will I seek after to dwell
[10:35] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[10:37] my life he's talking about on Mount
[10:39] Mariah there was an address there was a
[10:41] zip code you could use directions to get
[10:43] there it was a it was a physical
[10:44] structure but it's in a very special
[10:47] place in Genesis 22:14 this Mount Mariah
[10:51] Abraham called the name of that place
[10:54] Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day
[10:57] in the Mount of the Lord it shall shall
[10:59] be seen in other words he sees it's
[11:02] Jehovah Gyra we say my provider but it
[11:05] it's it means Jehovah sees and in other
[11:08] words God knows your need God sees
[11:10] exactly what you're going through and he
[11:12] will provide according to that need and
[11:15] as d as Abraham is saying as he's
[11:17] provided for me so will he provide for
[11:19] all those who trust in him in other
[11:22] words I'm going to name this place
[11:23] Jehovah Gyra mount in Mount Mariah this
[11:26] is Jehovah Gyra God sees that God will
[11:29] see the Lord will appear in all ages at
[11:31] all times in all difficulties in all
[11:34] circumstances in your distress and in
[11:36] your need no don't despair God sees and
[11:39] he will respond and that's what Mount
[11:41] Mariah signified and when they build the
[11:43] temple it is said that if my people when
[11:46] they're in trouble anywhere in the world
[11:48] if they'll look to this place here
[11:50] they'll know and they offer up their
[11:52] supplication and turn their hearts I
[11:54] will
[11:56] see and I will hear and I will answer
[12:00] in Jewish Traditions they believe that
[12:02] this Temple Mount is the focal point of
[12:04] creation they even believe that there's
[12:06] a stone upon which Isaac was offered by
[12:09] Abraham that's called the foundation
[12:10] stone is the very beginning of the
[12:12] creation of the world it's there that
[12:15] Adam came into be and there where
[12:17] Abraham Isaac and Jacob served God there
[12:20] in this spot is where the first temple
[12:21] was built where the second temple was
[12:23] built the ark of the covenant they say
[12:25] is even laid upon that foundation stone
[12:28] and they look at this area this place
[12:30] this singular Place Temple Mount is what
[12:32] it's summarized as there's so many other
[12:33] scriptures in the Bible that describe it
[12:36] but Jerusalem was chosen by God as the
[12:38] dwelling place of his shikina glory one
[12:42] place in all the world it would be right
[12:44] there it says in Malachi excuse me in
[12:47] Micah 4:
[12:50] 1-5 he says but in the last days it
[12:52] shall come to pass that the mountain of
[12:55] the house of the Lord so this is Mount
[12:57] Mariah shall be establish estblished in
[12:59] the top of the mountains and it shall be
[13:01] exalted above the hills and people shall
[13:04] flow unto it what incredible language
[13:07] remarkable to think about it in light of
[13:09] the fact that there is going to be a new
[13:10] heavens and new earth and a New
[13:12] Jerusalem and here it's going to
[13:14] describe symbolically even of a
[13:17] millennium and many nations shall come
[13:19] and say come and let us go up to the
[13:21] mountain of the Lord and to the house of
[13:23] the god of Jacob and he will teach us
[13:26] his ways and we will walk in his paths
[13:29] this is what the house of the Lord
[13:30] represented the place where God reigned
[13:32] a place of teaching a place of
[13:34] instruction to walk correctly for the
[13:35] law shall go forth of Zion and the word
[13:38] of the Lord from Jerusalem from where
[13:41] the house of the Lord and he shall judge
[13:43] from where from the house of the Lord
[13:45] among many people and rebuke strong
[13:46] Nations a far off and they shall beat
[13:48] their swords into plow shares and their
[13:50] Spears into pruning hooks Nations shall
[13:52] not lift up a sword against Nation
[13:54] neither shall they learn War anymore but
[13:56] they shall set every man under his Vine
[13:59] under his fig tree and None Shall make
[14:01] them afraid for the mouth of the lord of
[14:03] the host hath spoken it for all people
[14:06] will walk everyone in the name of his
[14:08] God and we will walk in the name of the
[14:10] Lord Our God forever and
[14:13] ever now notice how the prophet is
[14:16] writing about a time of perfect peace
[14:18] and Tranquility everyone getting along
[14:20] in the house of the god of Jacob being
[14:22] established in the mountain of the house
[14:24] of the Lord being established in the top
[14:26] of the mountains they did not seek a
[14:28] place called in
[14:30] heaven something I want I I know I
[14:32] emphasize this quite a bit in this the
[14:34] kingdom series but it just seems to be a
[14:37] refrain that I want to keep repeating it
[14:39] wasn't this longing to be out of this
[14:41] Earth and into heaven a lot of that's
[14:44] built around um the U even Catholicism
[14:49] as we mentioned before that there's this
[14:50] dichotomy Between Heaven and Hell and
[14:52] all we're doing here is making our
[14:53] decision to go to heaven if you don't
[14:55] light enough candles and pay enough
[14:56] money you're going to end spend the rest
[14:57] of your life in Hell or Purgatory but
[14:59] there's a way to get out of that so that
[15:00] you could be in heaven and this Earth
[15:02] kind of is an afterthought but if we
[15:04] look at it from the standpoint of the
[15:05] Old Testament they're not asking to go
[15:07] to heaven they're not asking to go to an
[15:09] invisible habitation of God beyond what
[15:11] they could see he's actually saying this
[15:13] house of the Lord that I love it is the
[15:16] habitation of your house it is where you
[15:19] dwell I I love the habitation of thy
[15:21] house and the place where thy honor
[15:22] dwelleth that's where I want to be not
[15:24] in heaven I want to be where you are and
[15:26] I don't want to just leave this earth
[15:28] and I just want to die so I can go be
[15:30] with my Lord to the Jews there was a
[15:32] different promise that the Lord himself
[15:34] would come and be resident among men on
[15:37] Earth David sought Heaven on
[15:40] Earth David as a as a Jew knew that
[15:44] there was a place that God could be seen
[15:47] a place that God was
[15:49] present now instead of taking more time
[15:51] to amplify the house of the Lord and
[15:54] what it would mean to a Jew I could just
[15:56] fast forward a little bit here and ask
[15:57] the question where where is the house of
[15:59] the Lord
[16:01] today and we may say instinctively well
[16:05] this is the house of the Lord and we
[16:07] could be accurate in one sense except
[16:09] that you would be wrong to think that
[16:11] this was the only house of the Lord so
[16:14] was a way that we could say the house of
[16:16] the Lord that would reply imply some
[16:18] characteristics or some attributes that
[16:20] could be shared of other
[16:22] places but I I'm asking the question and
[16:24] I don't I I've even intentionally just
[16:26] left a lot of things out to where I'm
[16:28] not going to answer it
[16:30] overtly but where is it we can find him
[16:34] now where is it do we go when we need
[16:38] his help Amen in Isaiah chapter 66 ver1
[16:41] it says thus sayith the Lord the heaven
[16:43] is my throne and the Earth is my foot
[16:46] stol we think that's that's right he's
[16:48] basically saying what who can contain
[16:51] the fullness of my beauty and my glory
[16:53] that heaven is my Throne Earth is my
[16:55] foot stol there's a lot of imagery
[16:57] established in that goes where where is
[16:58] the house where is the house that you
[17:01] build unto me and where is the place of
[17:04] my rest where is it I'm going to dwell
[17:07] where is it I'm going to be made known
[17:10] where is the house of the Lord where God
[17:11] is King Where is My Sanctuary where is
[17:14] the place that the shikina glory rests a
[17:17] place of God's Beauty his kindness his
[17:19] pleasantness his loveliness a place
[17:21] where we can be taught his ways
[17:23] according to Micah a place to be judged
[17:25] but yet a place of Peace a place to
[17:28] chire which means a place where I can
[17:30] seek the face of the Lord a place where
[17:33] I can seek counsel when I have questions
[17:35] a place where I can seek protection when
[17:37] I'm in trouble I guess it would maybe
[17:40] beg the question can this be found on
[17:41] Earth today if there was a physical
[17:44] Temple Physical place of worship that
[17:46] you could run into and as long as you're
[17:48] there you couldn't be taxed that place
[17:49] would be
[17:51] packed right there's a place you could
[17:53] run where you wouldn't get covid right
[17:54] that place would be packed you wouldn't
[17:56] have to wear a mask think of that
[17:59] no no uh no distancing I think it's
[18:01] funny is all the stickers are still up
[18:03] right all the markings you know maintain
[18:05] uh uh 3ot distance from here and and
[18:07] everywhere they got all these things up
[18:09] wear mask and even in some places where
[18:11] nobody will be served unless they're
[18:12] wearing a mask and you're tempted just
[18:14] to go in there and only a mask right
[18:16] just to see how serious they are about
[18:17] it but that nobody's doing it anymore
[18:20] they they've moved on from it but could
[18:21] you imagine when it was like that a
[18:23] place where you knew you were absolutely
[18:26] safe a city of ref refuges we could say
[18:29] perhaps can this be found on Earth
[18:32] today do you have a place like that is
[18:36] there a place that we can go to inquire
[18:39] when we have questions and we need
[18:41] answers and I know you're all thinking
[18:42] that's right Bing that's what we do we
[18:44] just Bing it and we use Bing Ai and we
[18:46] ask the questions and we get the answers
[18:48] we need but I'm actually challenged that
[18:50] challenging that instinct because a lot
[18:52] of times that when we have questions
[18:54] we're we're seeking counsel and we're
[18:56] looking for help and we're looking for
[18:57] protection and we're looking looking for
[18:58] contingencies and so I'm asking you
[19:00] where is the place of your rest amen now
[19:03] this is going to escalate quickly in 2
[19:05] Kings chapter 1 veres 1
[19:09] to3 it says then Moab rebelled against
[19:11] Israel after the death of
[19:14] Ahab and haaiah fell down through a
[19:17] lattice in his upper
[19:21] chamber that was in Samaria and was sick
[19:25] and he sent Messengers and said unto
[19:26] them go inquire of belzebub the god of
[19:30] ekron whether I shall recover of this
[19:34] disease now think of this just how
[19:37] terrible this is that this king is now
[19:40] wanting to go inquire Beelzebub the god
[19:42] of
[19:43] ekron whether or not he's going to
[19:46] recover of his disease he the the
[19:48] scripture implies as we'll continue to
[19:50] read that he had heard enough and seen
[19:51] enough to know that there was a place
[19:54] that you could go right that there was
[19:57] there was a a go in Israel who knew the
[20:00] very things that were happening behind
[20:01] closed doors there was a God who looked
[20:04] out after a God who was Vindicated he
[20:06] says go inquire go seek find out whether
[20:09] or not I'm going to recover from this
[20:11] disease but the angel the Lord said to
[20:12] Elijah the tishbite arise go up to meet
[20:15] The Messengers of the king of Samaria
[20:18] and say unto them is it not because
[20:20] there's not a God in Israel that you go
[20:23] to inquire of elub the god of
[20:27] ekron
[20:32] now if you could think of that for a
[20:34] little
[20:35] bit that God thought enough of this
[20:37] situation to where he wanted to rebuke
[20:40] his instinct to go seek an answer from
[20:43] somewhere else other than the Lord
[20:45] amen that when he was sick and he wasn't
[20:47] sure how long he would live and wasn't
[20:49] sure of his prognosis his Instinct
[20:50] wasn't just to trust the Lord or go to a
[20:53] source where he knew someone was
[20:54] speaking and I know in those days there
[20:56] was maybe just a lot of reading of the
[20:58] tea leaves and a lot of black magic and
[20:59] witchery and those different things that
[21:01] still exist today trust
[21:03] me hold this and there's a lot of things
[21:06] that uh is used uh that we would call
[21:09] today quackery and maybe then without
[21:11] the the benefits of research and Google
[21:13] and things or oh well he was just trying
[21:15] to get the best information he could but
[21:17] something in this implies that he knew
[21:20] better and the question is is it not
[21:22] because there's not a God in Israel that
[21:25] you would go inquiring I'm just
[21:27] piggybacking off of those terms that
[21:28] David says one thing have I desired that
[21:31] I may inquire in his Temple that when
[21:33] I'm in trouble I'll go there when I'm in
[21:36] need I'll go there when I don't have
[21:38] answers to my questions I'll go there my
[21:40] first instinct will I'll be there and
[21:43] there I'll seek and there I'll consider
[21:45] and there I'll pray and it's there
[21:47] within that context and within that
[21:49] place I know that whatever answers I get
[21:51] can be the right
[21:54] ones and it was the king's selfishness
[21:58] and stubbornness that kept him from
[22:00] seeking the Lord he had a hard heart he
[22:03] was rebellious he was
[22:04] stubborn and and as I was reading in all
[22:06] the places I could find where brother
[22:08] bam addressed this and I just started
[22:09] coming up with quite a list of
[22:10] statements to use and was able to pair
[22:12] it down quite a bit brother BR talks
[22:14] about his selfishness his stubbornness
[22:16] and even the commentators about it talk
[22:18] about his stubborn will and and and to
[22:22] imply that shows that maybe there was
[22:24] some check in his conscience that he
[22:26] thought I should probably go to
[22:29] Elijah they said no I won't do it I I'm
[22:33] not going to do it I'm going to inquire
[22:36] of the god of ekron and brother B said
[22:39] oh there was a god there was a prophet
[22:41] but it was the king's own stubbornness
[22:44] he didn't want to line up with God and
[22:45] His Prophet let's just kind of rake this
[22:48] into ourselves today let's just think of
[22:49] how this can be applicable and that was
[22:52] the reason that the King was seeking the
[22:54] easiest way out of these things amen
[22:58] I know that there's a there's a stain
[23:01] that's put on Christianity where it said
[23:03] that faith is just a weakness and it's a
[23:05] weakness of the mind and to trust in God
[23:07] is just lazy but really to go externally
[23:11] for your help is an easier way than to
[23:13] trust in the Lord yes sir he says he was
[23:16] wanting the easy way out of these things
[23:19] he says that's the reason of it he says
[23:21] it was his own stubbornness he didn't
[23:23] want to line up with the word of God he
[23:25] wanted the easy way out now hopefully
[23:27] this can challenge a little bit we could
[23:28] have just called these last several
[23:30] Services challenges challenges part 1 2
[23:32] 3 4 5 wherever we're at now in these
[23:34] challenging things but to ask ourselves
[23:37] do I seek the easy way out or am I
[23:40] willing to line up with the word of God
[23:42] Amen the answer the answer we know and I
[23:45] believe that I'm speaking to people that
[23:46] know the ANW is in the word of God but
[23:49] we kind of look at that route and we
[23:50] think oh my to get there that's tough
[23:52] and we're stubborn about it and we try
[23:54] to find a shortcut through a god of
[23:57] ekron
[23:58] says in another place and that's what's
[23:59] the matter with Nations today in the
[24:01] world it's not because we haven't got a
[24:04] God but science is trying to rule him
[24:07] out of the
[24:09] picture so outstanding science is trying
[24:12] to rule him out of the picture and the
[24:14] people are too stubborn to stand up on
[24:16] the principles of God's
[24:18] word what he says here is so relevant
[24:22] today it I would not be surprised at all
[24:25] if he was looking at 2024 when he said
[24:27] it come on that science is getting it's
[24:30] so pushed and it leads with such a
[24:33] Forefront and it leads with a lot of
[24:35] facts that are accurate and a lot of
[24:37] things that are correct and a lot of
[24:39] dots are being connected but they're
[24:40] trying to use that to paint a picture
[24:43] that keeps God out and we need to be uh
[24:46] we need to be stubborn in this sense
[24:50] that we're not willing to move from what
[24:52] the word of God says regardless of what
[24:54] science says said now I'm not disputing
[24:56] your facts but you you can't arrange
[24:58] those facts to rule God out of the
[25:00] picture we got to keep working with the
[25:02] facts until we see him we we've got to
[25:05] keep working with what you have that's
[25:07] great I'm not disagreeing but how is it
[25:09] your truth can finally click to see the
[25:12] truth which is
[25:14] Christ but we got to recognize the
[25:16] atmosphere and the environment that
[25:17] we're living in today that science and
[25:19] even our own selfishness is trying to
[25:21] rule God out of the
[25:23] picture and we get too stubborn to stand
[25:26] on the principles of the word of God
[25:28] maybe we get a little bit too worried
[25:29] about peer pressure social clout and
[25:32] different things we're not willing to
[25:33] stand on the word of the god word of
[25:36] God and as this
[25:40] King as he defaulted to is what brother
[25:44] B called the easiest
[25:46] path why do we seek Comfort anywhere
[25:49] else outside of Christ
[25:51] on I know that that would I mean I guess
[25:54] it's my mind that the way that it works
[25:56] I know immediately what uh my maybe my
[25:59] objection would be if I was just going
[26:00] to have a
[26:01] counterargument and so even in response
[26:05] anticipating uh the
[26:07] rebuttal that seeking to seek Christ to
[26:10] be in the will of Christ to to go to
[26:12] Christ is not to do nothing else right
[26:16] but it's that whatever you do is with
[26:18] his under his leadership everything you
[26:21] do is with confidence in God that he's
[26:22] the one that's leading if God heals by
[26:25] medicine you can't say well I mean I
[26:27] don't know if God's A Healer but I know
[26:28] he heals by medicine so I'm just going
[26:29] to run off to the doctor but it's
[26:32] knowing that God's my healer that my
[26:33] Help Cometh From The Lord and I'm going
[26:35] to get help from somebody else I'm going
[26:37] to get help through this situation I'm
[26:38] going to get help through medicine
[26:39] through rest and these things it's
[26:41] recognizing that at the end of the day
[26:43] your faith and confidence isn't in the
[26:45] bottle but in the God who knows your
[26:47] need the God who
[26:49] sees and so why do we seek Beauty in
[26:52] places where Christ is not why do we
[26:54] seek peace and favor anywhere else that
[26:57] Christ is does not have preeminence Amen
[27:00] brother bman multiple sermons where he's
[27:02] preaching the sermon why and he's taking
[27:04] it from Jeremiah chapter 8 and also uh
[27:07] from this uh from this place here is
[27:11] there not a God in
[27:13] Israel he says why do we he says I
[27:15] wonder and I wonder why this is in the
[27:18] sermon why why don't they
[27:21] come they're looking for pleasure
[27:24] they're looking for peace they're subst
[27:30] substituting they're looking for
[27:32] pleasure they're looking for peace and
[27:33] he says they're substituting I would
[27:35] argue that what brother Brown is saying
[27:37] is that the pleasure and peace that
[27:39] people are looking for can be found in
[27:41] him and their substitute he says the
[27:43] devil substituting such Rowdy things as
[27:45] that to take the place of a real good
[27:47] Spirit-filled
[27:48] experience where the joy of the Lord
[27:50] could come upon them and give them peace
[27:52] and rest can you testify that that's
[27:56] true I I I know what it's like to be in
[27:58] the world seeking something that will
[28:00] plate anxiety and fear I know what it's
[28:01] like to try to find a good time out
[28:03] there in the world but there's nothing
[28:05] out there you may have fun for a moment
[28:07] but there's nothing out there that
[28:08] satisfies like Christ when you know him
[28:11] and the Forgiveness of sins and the
[28:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost that that is
[28:15] real Joy that's the peace and the rest
[28:18] that mankind craves he says they love
[28:21] the pleasure of the world more than they
[28:22] love the kingdom of God their life
[28:25] proves it it's exactly what they live
[28:27] shows it amen the things we say the
[28:30] things we think about the things we talk
[28:32] about the things we do the things we
[28:34] pursue talk about what we desire or what
[28:36] we expect to get from what we think we
[28:39] desire what we pursue tells us what we
[28:42] think what our desires are supposed to
[28:45] achieve brother R says in one place it's
[28:47] the people's own stubborn way they don't
[28:49] want to bow down
[28:52] good why is it we won't humble ourselves
[28:55] to God's provided way
[28:58] brother B uses this quite a bit in
[28:59] Jeremiah chapter
[29:01] 8:
[29:03] 18-22 he uses this a
[29:05] lot in in these sermons why in these
[29:08] different places that I was studying but
[29:11] the prophet is chastising Israel for
[29:12] their stubbornness and so you can see
[29:15] that when brother talks about the
[29:16] stubbornness it it comes from how God
[29:19] was rebuking them and God's rebuke is
[29:22] prophesying Calamity and judgment and
[29:24] death to the kingdom and it's very for
[29:26] boing and very uh judge the judgments
[29:31] are coming it's a damnation to Israel
[29:33] and so Jeremiah the prophet the weeping
[29:36] prophet the lamenting Prophet it says in
[29:38] verse 18 when I would comfort myself
[29:40] against sorrow my heart is faint in me
[29:42] this is after these judgments have come
[29:44] and these words of what's going to
[29:45] happen and the death HH uh and people
[29:48] being Scattered Graves being opened up
[29:50] and Bones being scattered not
[29:51] resurrected but things such an affront
[29:53] to Israel says behold the voice of the
[29:56] Cry of the daughter of my people people
[29:58] because of them that dwell in a far
[29:59] country because now they're being taken
[30:00] out of their homes they strangers in
[30:02] forward lands voice of the bridegroom
[30:04] the voice of the Bride is no longer
[30:06] heard just weeping is found and he
[30:09] says and they've been taken into a far
[30:12] country is not the Lord in
[30:14] Zion what a question isn't this where he
[30:18] said he would be is not her King in
[30:23] her why is it that this is happening
[30:26] isn't isn't God supposed to be here
[30:28] isn't he supposed to be available hasn't
[30:30] he made me a promise isn't his word true
[30:32] why have they provoked me to anger with
[30:33] their graven images and with their
[30:35] strange vanities the Harvest has passed
[30:37] the summer is ended and we are not saved
[30:40] for the hurt of the daughter of my
[30:41] people am I hurt I am black astonishment
[30:45] have taken hold on me is there no Bal
[30:47] and
[30:48] Gilead is there no physician
[30:52] there and
[30:54] it's it's an expression of well there
[30:56] should be cuz is not the Lord in Zion is
[30:59] not her King in her cuz then he says
[31:01] that he it anticipates this rhetorical
[31:04] question suggests that the answer would
[31:05] be like well yes but he says why then is
[31:07] not the health of the daughter of my
[31:08] people
[31:09] recovered if he's here if he's available
[31:12] if the word is here if the king is in
[31:14] her if the Lord is in Zion then why is
[31:16] the health of the daughter of my people
[31:17] not
[31:20] recovered why is the question that
[31:22] brother brandham is asking I've asked
[31:24] the question why would we seek anything
[31:26] else why would we seek a of erron why
[31:28] why would we be stubborn in our own ways
[31:30] and stick to our own ways when we see
[31:32] that things aren't working out and not
[31:33] do the things that we know that we ought
[31:35] to do and it's in Jeremiah chapter 7
[31:38] that you find the answer to Jeremiah's
[31:40] question here in Jeremiah
[31:42] 8 is there no bomb in Gilead is there no
[31:45] physician there brother Brandon would
[31:46] say or we could read from these it's not
[31:48] that there wasn't a god oh there was a
[31:50] god there was a prophet here we could
[31:53] say that oh there there's the Lord
[31:55] that's his favor in Zion this is the the
[31:57] place that God's
[31:58] chosen but this is what is said in the
[32:01] chapter preceding Jeremiah 7: 1-1 I I
[32:05] might skip a little bit here and touch
[32:07] on some things but we'll read through
[32:08] verse 11 the word that came to Jeremiah
[32:10] from the Lord saying stand in the gate
[32:14] of the Lord's House and Proclaim there
[32:17] this word and say hear the word of the
[32:20] Lord all ye of Judah that enter in at
[32:23] these gates To Worship the Lord thus
[32:26] sayith the Lord of host the god of
[32:28] Israel amend your ways and your doings
[32:30] and I will cause you to dwell in this
[32:33] place trust not in line words saying the
[32:36] Temple of the Lord the Temple of the
[32:38] Lord the Temple of the Lord are
[32:41] these now the repetition is for a reason
[32:44] there a lot of things you could look at
[32:45] to uh describe why there was repetition
[32:48] perhaps the repetition is because the
[32:50] Temple of the lord of the outer courts
[32:52] the Temple of the Lord to the inner
[32:53] Court the Temple of the Lord to the holy
[32:55] of holies and in that three p repetition
[32:58] it embodies the house of God the house
[33:00] of the Lord it could be that it was
[33:02] those three times a year that there to
[33:04] appear before the Lord in Jerusalem at
[33:06] Passover Pentecost and Feast of
[33:08] Tabernacles the Temple of the Lord the
[33:10] Temple of the Lord the Temple of the
[33:12] Lord there's a way that this repetition
[33:14] is done to call to mind certain aspects
[33:19] of this place that we come this
[33:22] three-fold place of porch inner Court
[33:24] holy of holies this place that we come
[33:27] for Passover Pentecost Feast of booze
[33:30] this place that we come there's where
[33:32] our justification lies that's
[33:36] good
[33:37] it's well the temple of the Lord because
[33:39] he says trust not in lying words that
[33:41] say well the temple of the Lord the
[33:43] Temple of the Lord the Temple of the
[33:46] Lord because Israel was being
[33:48] hypocritical in their
[33:50] worship they didn't think that God would
[33:53] destroy or allowed to be destroyed the
[33:55] temple right they thought oh well God
[33:58] identified himself here God this is the
[34:00] place that God dwells God will always
[34:02] protect it and they forgot his word that
[34:06] said letest you do these things you have
[34:10] to honor the word of God you have to
[34:11] obey the word of God so God didn't say
[34:14] well no matter what you do no matter
[34:15] what you say the temple is going to be
[34:17] preserved in Micah 3:1 it says the heads
[34:21] thereof judge for reward now notice this
[34:24] condemnation of the house of the Lord
[34:27] says the heads there have judged for
[34:29] reward and the priests there have Teach
[34:30] For Hire and the prophets there have
[34:32] Divine for money it ought not to be that
[34:34] way this was a place where you there
[34:37] would be judging there'd be teaching
[34:39] there would be knowledge things that
[34:40] would come forth but not for reward or
[34:42] for higher for
[34:44] money and it says yet will they lean
[34:46] upon the Lord and say is not the Lord
[34:49] among
[34:50] us none evil can come Among
[34:53] Us now I know the application of this
[34:58] uh you can be very strict in your
[35:00] application but I hope that you can be a
[35:01] little bit more broad or specific for
[35:04] your case however the Lord May deal with
[35:06] you but there was a certain idea that
[35:09] they believed that their ceremony and
[35:10] their tradition was more important than
[35:12] obedience that traditionally this is
[35:15] where this is the house of the Lord and
[35:17] this is where the shikina glory comes
[35:18] down and this is all the things that God
[35:20] said about it and so they could do
[35:22] whatever they want judge for reward
[35:25] Teach For Hire Divine for money and then
[35:27] just say was not the Lord among
[35:29] us is he not doing what he said he would
[35:32] do do we not have signs uh do we not
[35:35] have this do we not have that do not the
[35:36] priest go in and offer is this kind of
[35:38] Glory not
[35:40] there
[35:42] wow but
[35:45] because they were no longer
[35:48] keeping in harmony with the word of
[35:51] God and doing these things this is what
[35:53] leads Jeremiah to say is there no
[35:55] bombing Gilead there's no physician
[35:56] there's this this not the house of the
[35:57] Lord is God not in Zion and the question
[35:58] going to be like yes
[36:02] but yes well then why isn't the the
[36:04] health of my daughter
[36:05] recovered brother brandham says this in
[36:08] the sermon why he said he's and in some
[36:11] of these larger statements he's
[36:12] identifying kind of this worldliness and
[36:14] this looseness this lack of uh
[36:16] circumspect us a lack of Holiness in
[36:19] people's lives and forward progress
[36:22] maybe a lot of ways we could describe it
[36:24] but then he says because there's no joy
[36:26] in the house the
[36:27] Lord what makes a person want to drink
[36:30] and run around and act like that is it
[36:33] because we don't have any god wow is it
[36:36] because there's no joy in the house of
[36:37] the Lord anymore and here brother Bram
[36:39] is specifically talking about church and
[36:42] I I I want to use this just so we can
[36:44] challenge ourselves about uh the
[36:46] atmosphere that we're creating the
[36:48] attitude that we have towards this
[36:49] Gathering is it because the Holy Spirit
[36:51] isn't ready to bless all of us is there
[36:54] anything wrong with
[36:55] it and I would say the Holy Spirit wants
[36:58] to bless us there's nothing wrong with
[37:00] coming to church there was certainly
[37:02] nothing wrong with judging and teaching
[37:04] and divining but when it's done for
[37:05] reward and done for hire and done for
[37:07] money when it's not done for the right
[37:08] objective and the right way and to have
[37:10] this attitude was the Lord not among us
[37:13] even maybe a Cavalier attitude towards
[37:15] church or Cavalier attitude towards
[37:16] certain things it's like well God's with
[37:18] me what does all these other things
[37:19] matter on he says but because that we do
[37:22] it that's the reason we're cursed he's
[37:24] doing these other things that's the
[37:25] reason God putting this thing upon the
[37:27] church this cold and dampness that's
[37:30] quite a statement a cold and dampness
[37:32] what a day to read
[37:34] it and the reason why it's happening he
[37:37] says we're going to other places for
[37:39] pleasure instead of coming to the house
[37:41] of the Lord for
[37:43] pleasure we find it too easy to make
[37:45] time for other things instead of God we
[37:48] find it too easy to recreate and go out
[37:50] and do things for pleasure and do things
[37:51] to enjoy and the one thing desired is
[37:54] actually being told with in our own
[37:57] actions that no you can say you desire
[37:59] him but really you're being selfish
[38:02] really you only desire to satisfy your
[38:04] own desires your own flesh your own
[38:06] popularity your own power cuz he's
[38:08] saying we're going to other places for
[38:10] pleasure instead of coming to the house
[38:11] of the Lord for pleasure now you might
[38:14] say I got to go to church to be
[38:15] entertained or go to church for pleasure
[38:17] I'm I'm not trying to answer the
[38:19] question where's the house of the Lord
[38:20] but I do believe he is in some place
[38:23] there is a place you can find him and
[38:26] are we going there because we desire it
[38:29] or do we go to other
[38:31] places the house of the Lord is the joy
[38:34] of the Lord amen there was a time when
[38:38] believing families listened to the
[38:39] message of the hour as a means of
[38:41] evening
[38:42] entertainment not because it was
[38:44] frivolous and it was some sort of a a
[38:47] jolly good time but it was something
[38:49] they look forward to and something they
[38:52] valued he says the house of the Lord is
[38:54] the joy of the Lord amen the joy of the
[38:57] Lord is the joy of his people he's
[38:59] concerned about your joy he wants you to
[39:02] come to church and worship him and be
[39:04] happy and satisfied give him praise and
[39:06] honor and glory and wisdom and might and
[39:08] power to God he wants you to do that but
[39:11] it's not going to be your inheritance if
[39:14] you're going you're looking for pleasure
[39:17] in places you shouldn't be looking for
[39:19] pleasure because you can do exactly what
[39:21] they were doing here if they were
[39:23] challenged it wasn't that you found them
[39:25] at home not doing anything they right
[39:26] there in the house of the Lord they're
[39:29] right there coming to the door to hear
[39:31] Jeremiah prophesy against them they're
[39:33] there in the house but it's not what
[39:36] they're doing in the house that's
[39:37] keeping their services where they are
[39:39] it's what they're doing outside of that
[39:41] place of worship that was causing the
[39:43] cold and dampness to come upon the house
[39:45] of the
[39:47] Lord because this is how Jeremiah picks
[39:49] it up Jeremiah chapter 7 verse
[39:53] 5 he says for if ye thoroughly fruy
[39:57] amend your ways and your doings if you
[39:59] thly execute judgment between a man and
[40:02] his neighbor that means you're going to
[40:03] get it
[40:06] right if you oppress not the stranger
[40:09] the fatherless and the Widow and shed
[40:12] Not Innocent blood in this place neither
[40:15] walk after other gods to your
[40:17] hurt then will I cause you to dwell in
[40:20] this place in the land that I gave to
[40:22] your fathers forever and
[40:25] ever now that's cause us to recognize
[40:29] there's a certain character of the
[40:31] people that's not matching the Temple of
[40:34] the Lord the Temple of the Lord the
[40:36] Temple of the Lord even it says is not
[40:38] God Among Us no evil can come upon us
[40:41] because all of it has been put into the
[40:43] Vindication of the Prophet all of it's
[40:45] put into the sanctity of the church all
[40:48] of it's been put into these the
[40:49] semantics and the arrangement and all
[40:51] the logistics and there's this idea oh
[40:53] well it doesn't matter what I do come on
[40:59] then will I cause you to dwell in this
[41:01] place if you execute judgment you
[41:03] oppress not you shed not and now it
[41:06] speaks more to their character again
[41:08] here in verse eight behold you trust in
[41:10] ly words that cannot
[41:13] profit this is where we get our deficit
[41:16] we're trusting in line Words that cannot
[41:20] profit we're putting our confidence in
[41:22] and our trust in things that cannot give
[41:24] us gain
[41:26] will you steal murder and commit
[41:30] adultery and swear falsely and burn
[41:32] incense unto bail and walk after other
[41:35] gods whom you know not he says these
[41:37] things because they were doing these
[41:39] things the word was very clear even in
[41:41] these 10 commandments that they were
[41:43] given there's these the law was given
[41:45] they knew the law but they're acting
[41:47] against the law they're acting against
[41:48] their conscience standing in the temple
[41:50] Lord saying God is Among Us the Lord is
[41:52] in Zion no harm will come among us and
[41:55] then when bad things start happening
[41:56] like but wait a minute God's not going
[41:57] to allow the temple to be torn let's
[41:59] just all gather here let's gather in
[42:01] Jerusalem surely God's not going to let
[42:03] these walls be torn down God's not going
[42:05] to let his house be forsaken but it's
[42:07] you that caused it to be
[42:11] forsaken amen stealing murdering
[42:13] adultery swearing falsely burning
[42:15] incense to other gods walking after
[42:17] other gods he says and
[42:19] come and stand before me in this house
[42:22] which is called by my name and say we
[42:24] are delivered to do all these
[42:25] Abominations
[42:28] is this house which is called by my name
[42:31] become a den of robbers in your eyes
[42:34] behold even I have seen it sayith the
[42:38] Lord maybe there was another side to
[42:40] Jehovah Gyra they didn't think about
[42:43] good in this place God sees and that's
[42:46] why we come to it good amen but know
[42:49] that he
[42:50] sees he truly does
[42:53] see and the common
[42:56] theme when brother brandham addresses
[43:00] this is we know there's a
[43:03] God I wish now that maybe I would have
[43:05] brought more of these statements because
[43:06] it's just over and over again it's not
[43:08] because there's not a god it's not
[43:10] because the word's not true it's not
[43:12] because God hasn't Vindicated this and
[43:14] God hasn't made his presence known there
[43:16] is a God there is a God who made a
[43:17] promise there's a God that's
[43:19] present but he says but because of your
[43:21] own actions he says you've made even as
[43:24] Jesus borrows from this you've made the
[43:25] house of my father a dent of Thieves
[43:29] right a house of
[43:31] robbers the Lord has seen
[43:34] it they were going through the SE
[43:36] ceremony they were going through the
[43:37] tradition but they weren't seeking him
[43:40] and the contrast between David's desire
[43:42] in what it becomes is so remarkable
[43:45] because David like one thing have I
[43:47] desired of the Lord not that I would
[43:49] make money in the house of God not that
[43:51] I could oh that's a place where I could
[43:52] be hired to teach that's a place where I
[43:54] could Divine for money that's a place
[43:55] where I can I I can uh uh uh judge for
[43:59] reward like him that's who I want think
[44:04] of what we ought to be looking for when
[44:05] we come to church not the pretense of
[44:07] things what are the things we ought to
[44:09] be weighing when we think about where to
[44:11] go to church not the pretense of things
[44:13] there ought to be one thing desired when
[44:15] it comes to the house of the Lord when
[44:17] it referred to church it should be the
[44:18] word of God it should be Christ is he
[44:20] lifted up am I hearing things of Christ
[44:24] is it a place that God has pleased to
[44:25] manifest himself not in logistics of
[44:28] worship but in his word think of that
[44:31] it's not song service it's not even
[44:33] gifts and things of that but God is
[44:36] known by his word God is in his word
[44:39] that's what ought to matter more than
[44:41] anything beauti and I say this as I
[44:44] tried to enter maybe this last phase for
[44:46] this for a close today that do you
[44:50] believe you have a responsibility to
[44:52] seek
[44:54] Him the attitude was is not the Lord
[44:56] among us no evil can come upon us but
[44:59] they were no longer seeking him the
[45:01] attitude was the Temple of the Lord the
[45:02] Temple of the Lord the Temple of the
[45:03] Lord he's not going to cause this to
[45:05] fall he's not going to cause this to
[45:06] stumble surely we're not going to be
[45:08] dragged into
[45:09] captivity but do we have a
[45:11] responsibility to find the place to seek
[45:14] Him in light of the king of Samaria in
[45:18] light of these priests and teachers in
[45:22] light of the questions of Jeremiah and
[45:24] Elijah are we seeking him as we ought
[45:29] to in Psalms
[45:33] 27 the contrast
[45:36] between the David saying my heart shall
[45:38] not fear I will not be afraid to the
[45:41] next part to
[45:42] Me Maybe I'm going to start using a new
[45:45] word remarkable Ponder how remarkable it
[45:49] is that a that's a
[45:52] twofer is that some sort of parlay for
[45:54] somebody
[45:57] there
[45:58] is what he says in the
[46:01] beginning of
[46:03] what my my heart is going to be
[46:05] confident one thing I've desired now pay
[46:07] attention to the language it begins to
[46:08] use in this next
[46:10] part and and ultimately I think this is
[46:13] what really settled in my heart just to
[46:14] continue to take this direction because
[46:16] it seemed to be a lot of pieces and I I
[46:18] was so torn I want it to be encouraged
[46:21] and I want it to help I believe we have
[46:23] a positive gospel and and and and to
[46:26] share some of these scriptures sometimes
[46:28] I know that they've been used as as a
[46:30] bully thing and a three-pointed club to
[46:32] tear us down but we still have to hear
[46:34] these things we have to be challenged
[46:35] with these things uh if we could just
[46:37] keep it in the spirit that the messenger
[46:38] intended it keep it in the spirit of
[46:40] Christ it's needful for us amen and
[46:43] so I I took great comfort in recognizing
[46:46] that David first acknowledged the temple
[46:50] the house of the Lord his presence there
[46:54] and and then the next part is his
[46:57] plea so it it it it show it followed
[47:01] that pattern of We Know
[47:03] Better it show the pattern of it's not
[47:05] that we're ignorant and and we don't
[47:07] know but there's a it's settled it's
[47:09] established but now we're being given a
[47:11] template of what we ought to do to find
[47:13] what is expressed in those first seven
[47:15] verses verse eight when thou sest seek
[47:18] ye my face now the Lord said seek my
[47:20] face now we ought to think about just
[47:23] how outstanding that is for a God who
[47:26] said no man can see my face and now he
[47:28] says seek it well that's a game of
[47:29] hideand-seek that I'm never going to be
[47:31] able to win but he said seek
[47:34] it he said well we can't find it seek
[47:37] it you said we can't see it seek it am
[47:41] that's what he said seek it my heart
[47:43] said unto thee I love this thy face Lord
[47:46] will I
[47:48] seek Hallelujah when the word says
[47:51] something your mind might have a lot of
[47:52] things it starts Computing but does your
[47:54] heart say yes Lord
[47:56] when he says seek my face your mind says
[47:58] well you said that we can't see it and I
[47:59] don't know where it is no man can see it
[48:02] and live but does your heart say then I
[48:04] your face I will seek and I love how
[48:07] instinctive that is God says seek my
[48:09] face and the heart says thy face Lord
[48:11] will I seek no objection no say but you
[48:15] said well where is it how long what will
[48:18] it look like just says then I'll seek it
[48:21] so then he starts saying hide not thy
[48:23] face far from me huah put not thy
[48:27] servant away in anger in other words
[48:28] don't hide your face from me thou Hast
[48:31] been my help Leave Me Not Alone neither
[48:34] forsake me oh god of my salvation now
[48:37] comes the honesty now comes the
[48:40] recognition oh here's the enemies here's
[48:42] the promise here I am here's the problem
[48:45] here's the trouble here's the promise in
[48:47] the time of trouble he'll hide me now
[48:49] here's me and my Humanity oh don't
[48:52] forsake me don't leave me oh god of my
[48:54] salvation when my father and my mother
[48:56] forsake me then the Lord will take me up
[48:59] now he starts confessing the positive
[49:01] teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in
[49:04] a plain path because of mine enemies
[49:06] deliver me not over under the will of my
[49:08] enemies for false Witnesses are risen up
[49:10] against me and such as breathe out
[49:12] cruelty notice David does not make the
[49:15] mistake of saying well I'm in the temple
[49:17] of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the
[49:18] Temple of the Lord is God not among us
[49:20] there's no way that evil could come upon
[49:22] us he had the attitude teach me your way
[49:25] lead me because of those that are out
[49:27] there deliver me not over to them and
[49:30] all these lies that are risen up against
[49:32] me that breathe out cruelty Lord help
[49:36] me I would have fainted unless I had
[49:38] believed to see the goodness of the Lord
[49:39] in the land of the
[49:40] living faith is what sustained him he
[49:44] says wait on the
[49:45] Lord be of good
[49:48] courage and he shall strengthen thy
[49:50] heart am
[49:52] amen by saying this David has told us
[49:57] his supplications are
[49:59] successful because this is what's
[50:00] happening he says seek my face in other
[50:02] words he doesn't say see my face right
[50:04] he says seek my face so David's heart
[50:06] says then your face I'll seek and as he
[50:08] starts seeking he says don't hide it
[50:10] from me Lord amen don't put don't turn
[50:12] away from me in anger you've been my
[50:14] help don't leave me you are my salvation
[50:17] don't forsake me notice the language
[50:19] begins to use to compel God no it's a
[50:21] pleading it's and the crying out to the
[50:23] heart of God teach me your way way
[50:26] Deliver Me Not Over lead me in a plain
[50:28] path what is this this is the waiting
[50:30] this is the seeking one thing have I
[50:32] desired that will I seek after what did
[50:35] he desire him what he desire the place
[50:37] of beauty and he said then my actions
[50:39] are going to match what I said when we
[50:41] talked about one thing desired we talked
[50:43] about the matching of what we do and
[50:45] here David saying I'm going to do I'm
[50:47] going to seek your face and then he says
[50:49] it wait on the Lord give good courage he
[50:53] shall strengthen thy heart wait I I say
[50:55] on the Lord why because he made the
[50:57] promise for in the time of trouble he
[51:00] shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[51:02] secret of his Tabernacle he shall hide
[51:04] me he shall set me upon a
[51:10] rock that's a statement this my this is
[51:13] maybe it might be childish to say it but
[51:15] that's my favorite Bible verse Psalms
[51:17] 27:5 my absolute favorite Bible verse
[51:21] such a beautiful end time prophecy it's
[51:23] what we're living in right now the
[51:24] Fulfillment of
[51:26] but David we know when he says this in
[51:29] the time of trouble he's going to hide
[51:30] me in his Pavilion his dwelling in the
[51:32] secret of his habitation his tent shall
[51:35] he hide me there I'll see you yes amen
[51:38] David sought the secret place where God
[51:39] would show his face amen that's what he
[51:44] wanted and when he says this he does
[51:47] something
[51:49] that's it just the way that God does
[51:51] these things are you you feeling a
[51:53] little warm don't worry it's going to be
[51:55] chilly out there I think we finally got
[51:57] the rain to stop under the
[52:00] awning rains in Phoenix it rains under
[52:03] the
[52:04] roof I woke up and thought I was in a
[52:07] nightmare I thought I woke up in
[52:14] Texas but the language that David is
[52:19] using he's hearkening back to the
[52:22] language of Moses in the Exodus and he
[52:26] he's using these specifics because the
[52:28] the kind of the theme as we come to the
[52:29] Crux there in verse eight seek my face
[52:31] and David says well your face I'll seek
[52:33] and to behold the beauty of the Lord to
[52:35] inquire in his
[52:37] Temple it it implies this presence this
[52:40] face to face togetherness this
[52:42] loveliness and David is said in the time
[52:44] of trouble he will hide me his Pavilion
[52:45] and the secret of his Tabernacle he
[52:47] shall set me up upon a rock David is
[52:49] used in a prophetic language to go back
[52:51] to the Exodus and in Exodus 33: 18 to 23
[52:56] I'm going to skip a little bit but in
[52:57] the verses prior to this there a
[52:59] conversation going on between Moses and
[53:02] God and Moses is going well if you don't
[53:04] go with us don't send me and and how can
[53:06] we go forward and how are we going to be
[53:07] different and there's a lot of worries
[53:09] and concerns on Moses's part but once
[53:11] God has confirmed that he's with them
[53:13] and he'll go with them then Moses had
[53:15] one thing he
[53:16] desired that Moses this is what's so
[53:19] amazing this is Exodus 33 I don't know
[53:22] why I have a period after Exodus glory
[53:24] amen
[53:25] um there's the reason why that this is
[53:28] so remarkable to me is that there's
[53:31] something to to consider that his life
[53:35] for Moses it's Exodus 33 not
[53:40] three this is after God has appeared to
[53:43] him on a mountain this is after the
[53:45] tablets were written upon this is after
[53:47] he saw the plagues this is after God let
[53:50] him out by Mighty hand this is after
[53:51] striking the rock this is after there's
[53:54] no question of God greatness he's seen
[53:56] him in a pillar fire he's seen him in a
[53:58] A Cloud by day he knows who he's heard
[54:01] his voice the glory of God was seen on
[54:03] his face but now notice what he says at
[54:06] the end I beseech thee show me thy Glory
[54:11] what a hunger Moses wasn't satisfied to
[54:14] say well back then this and back then
[54:16] that and back in Pentecost and when I
[54:17] was a kid and when I was a preacher when
[54:19] this no he said now today right now in
[54:22] light of where you're taking me and
[54:23] where I'm going knowing that there's
[54:24] more show me thy
[54:27] [Music]
[54:28] Glory God says and he I will make all my
[54:33] goodness pass before thee all my beauty
[54:35] all my comeliness all my
[54:37] loveliness and I will proclaim the name
[54:40] of the Lord before thee and will be
[54:43] gracious to whom I will be
[54:46] gracious and will show Mercy on whom I
[54:48] will show
[54:50] mercy and he said thou cannot see my
[54:54] face for there shall no man see me and
[54:58] live now that notice the contrast stands
[55:02] to David now
[55:04] right behold there's a place by
[55:08] me and thou shalt stand upon a rock now
[55:11] you know what David was talking
[55:13] about you know the place that David was
[55:15] looking
[55:16] for when he said if for in a time of
[55:18] trouble you'll hide me you shall set me
[55:21] up upon a rock it brings it back to the
[55:23] language that God said David knew there
[55:25] was a place by
[55:28] him and thou shalt stand upon a
[55:31] rock and it shall come to pass while my
[55:33] Glory passees by that I will put thee in
[55:36] the Cliff of The Rock and will cover
[55:39] thee with my hand while I pass by oh now
[55:42] think of the language of the Psalms a a
[55:45] and this beautiful picture that's being
[55:46] painted in this Exodus scene and I will
[55:48] take away my hand and thou shalt see my
[55:51] back Parts but my face shall not be seen
[55:56] right but now this is in The
[55:59] Exodus but now David in Psalms 27 is
[56:02] prophesying of a command to seek my
[56:05] face David is using a totally different
[56:08] language seek my face and my heart said
[56:10] oh Lord thy face will I seek there is a
[56:12] place by me and there will be a way
[56:16] consecrated and there will be a price
[56:18] paid where you can look me in the face
[56:21] and know me and see me and not tremble
[56:25] and faint at the gravity of it but being
[56:27] Washed by the blood of the Lamb being
[56:30] justified forever we can see the truth
[56:32] of God's word we could see the plainness
[56:34] of God's word we can see the whole plan
[56:36] of God open up and we're not struck with
[56:38] fear and faint and die but we see
[56:41] ourselves in a mirror as it were and
[56:43] we're confident that he thought of us
[56:44] and he knew of us and the whole plan was
[56:46] to bring me to
[56:48] him he says there is a place by
[56:52] me and thou shalt stand upon on a rock
[56:56] and David says I want to be in that
[56:59] place that place I want to be in that
[57:03] place by
[57:04] him the Bible says in Isaiah 32: 1 and 2
[57:08] Behold a king shall reign in
[57:10] righteousness and princes shall rule in
[57:11] judgment and a man shall be as a hiding
[57:15] place from the
[57:16] wind and a covert that's the same word a
[57:19] tabernacle used in Psalms 27 and a
[57:21] covert a secret place of protection from
[57:25] The Tempest as rivers of water in a dry
[57:28] place as the shadow of a great rock in a
[57:31] weary
[57:33] land where is this place
[57:37] today David could come here's God in a
[57:41] very specific local very specific
[57:43] conversation God and Moses having this
[57:45] intimate conversation Moses's heart is
[57:47] what moved God show me thy Glory God
[57:51] says okay there's a place by me and I'm
[57:54] going to set you you up upon a rock and
[57:56] in that time and in that moment I'm
[57:57] going to allow myself to pass by and I'm
[58:00] going to as I pass by I'm going to let
[58:02] you see my backside but you can't see my
[58:04] face but now there's this this knowledge
[58:09] that there's a place by
[58:11] him and it's upon a
[58:13] rock and whatever limitations existed at
[58:16] that time David begins to speak of a
[58:18] language that I want to be in that place
[58:20] by you in a time of trouble I'm going to
[58:23] be in that place that secret place that
[58:26] place you spoke about to Moses I want to
[58:28] be in that place by you that place to
[58:31] seek you and in that place you say Seek
[58:34] my face and the Bible says a man is
[58:37] going to be a rock a hiding place a
[58:40] covert in Psalm 61: 1 to4 Hear My Cry Oh
[58:44] God attend unto my prayer from the end
[58:47] of the Earth will I cry unto you I'm
[58:50] asking you where is this rock where we
[58:52] can see him amen do we do it the king of
[58:54] Samaria do we do we try to read the tea
[58:57] leaves do we look for a dier in the
[58:59] world are we chasing after all these
[59:01] other things but do we first find the
[59:03] place by him do we first come to the
[59:06] rock is there a place that we come first
[59:08] and we sat down and I'm here to inquire
[59:11] and the Lord says what's your need well
[59:12] I've got this rash I've got this problem
[59:14] I've got this relationship issue and we
[59:16] begin to pour our hearts out to him and
[59:18] he might say well you know what you need
[59:19] to do you need to do this and you need
[59:21] to do that and we might end up going to
[59:22] the very places we would have sought
[59:24] before but now we know we're in the
[59:26] place by
[59:27] him and it's not just the Temple of the
[59:29] Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple
[59:30] of the lord it's not well God's with us
[59:32] he's not going to destroy us but you've
[59:33] come back to the one thing desired amen
[59:36] amen so he says when my heart is
[59:38] overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is
[59:41] higher than I lead me to the place to
[59:45] seek Him
[59:47] am Brothers you can come to your
[59:49] instruments for thou Hast been a shelter
[59:52] for me and a strong power from the
[59:56] enemy I will abide in thy Tabernacle
[1:00:00] forever I will trust in the cover of thy
[1:00:04] Wings amen
[1:00:07] say it's so
[1:00:10] beautiful thou has been a
[1:00:12] shelter for
[1:00:14] me a strong
[1:00:17] tower and he uses the language lead me
[1:00:20] to the
[1:00:22] Rock and the rock is where
[1:00:25] the
[1:00:26] Tabernacle the rock is where the temple
[1:00:29] the rock is where the house of the Lord
[1:00:33] amen and that's where we trust the
[1:00:36] language now the cover of his
[1:00:39] wings it even brings into view The Mercy
[1:00:41] Seat there's so much visual things that
[1:00:45] we could start looking at the Tabernacle
[1:00:47] the Wilderness the temple all the
[1:00:49] elements all the symbols everything it's
[1:00:51] God
[1:00:52] pointing a large thought that I had
[1:00:55] pulled out of this is just how that God
[1:00:56] was using the Tabernacle using the
[1:00:58] temple as a means of expressing
[1:01:00] something to us that we could look at
[1:01:03] that and then begin to understand this
[1:01:05] is what it represented this what it
[1:01:06] represented and so I'm asking you where
[1:01:08] is it
[1:01:11] today if we believed that that place
[1:01:13] today was in Jerusalem we should be
[1:01:15] there
[1:01:16] right there's some people today that
[1:01:18] believe it's in Jeffersonville and
[1:01:19] that's why they're
[1:01:23] there and
[1:01:25] got to be careful how you judge people
[1:01:28] because many are just acting upon what
[1:01:29] they've been taught and what they
[1:01:30] believe very deeply and very
[1:01:33] strongly and so I'm not preaching to
[1:01:35] them none of them are streaming
[1:01:37] this that's a play they don't
[1:01:41] push but I'm asking you who are
[1:01:44] here where is this place by him today
[1:01:49] I'm asking you this I'm I can't tell
[1:01:52] you I I it can say well it's here and I
[1:01:55] could even tell you what I think it is
[1:01:56] but still I would be using a language
[1:01:59] that could mean nothing to you unless
[1:02:01] you knew where that place was for
[1:02:03] you oh it's right here Arizona Believers
[1:02:05] Church if you're not here you're not
[1:02:07] getting it well that's a lie that's just
[1:02:09] another the Temple of the Lord the
[1:02:10] Temple of the Lord the Temple of the
[1:02:11] Lord just another lie you're trusting in
[1:02:14] in false words lying words we'd be no
[1:02:16] better off than them in Jeremiah 7 no
[1:02:18] better than the king uh Samaria that
[1:02:20] went after the god of erron that that
[1:02:22] there's nothing in that but we got to
[1:02:25] find
[1:02:27] him where's the place that you seek him
[1:02:30] maybe I could ask it that way where's
[1:02:32] the place you seek him where is the
[1:02:34] place you find him sometimes we need to
[1:02:36] stop and recognize I've left him and go
[1:02:39] back to the place that we left them and
[1:02:41] I promise that's where you'll find them
[1:02:43] every time
[1:02:46] amen because there is a God because the
[1:02:49] message is true amen it is real there is
[1:02:52] a God and he loves you your salvation is
[1:02:54] real your healing is real all these
[1:02:56] things are true they're real then why do
[1:02:58] these things befall us because we're not
[1:03:00] at the
[1:03:02] place to seek
[1:03:04] him unless there be any inaccurate
[1:03:07] picture
[1:03:08] painted if the place to seek him so
[1:03:12] there's just no magic in being
[1:03:14] there you got to
[1:03:17] wait David as he begins to plead hide
[1:03:20] not thy face from me even as Moses came
[1:03:24] came to that rock that was by him he
[1:03:26] said
[1:03:27] now I'm going to do something you're
[1:03:30] going to come to this place that is by
[1:03:31] me what beautiful language and thou
[1:03:34] shalt stand upon a rock and then as my
[1:03:37] glory passes by I'm going to put you in
[1:03:39] the Cliff of a rock and I'll cover thee
[1:03:41] with my hand while I pass by you notice
[1:03:44] that there'll be a time that he's
[1:03:46] passing by that you don't actually know
[1:03:48] it quite yet right he's there he's
[1:03:52] passing by but then he says and I'll
[1:03:53] take away away my hand at just the right
[1:03:56] moment I'll take away my
[1:03:59] hand and so he says just wait wait wait
[1:04:03] we're pleading we're pleading keep
[1:04:04] pleading keep waiting wait on the Lord
[1:04:06] just wait wait be of good courage he'll
[1:04:09] strengthen your heart wait and what was
[1:04:12] the heart the strength in the heart it
[1:04:13] matches his heart's desire thy face will
[1:04:15] I seek seek my face my heart says your
[1:04:18] face will I seek he'll strengthen your
[1:04:20] heart by giving your heart's desire amen
[1:04:22] but you got to stay in that place don't
[1:04:24] come off the
[1:04:25] rock don't climb away stay and wait
[1:04:30] because at the time that he'll remove
[1:04:31] his hand it won't be his backside you
[1:04:33] see it'll be his
[1:04:34] face and sometimes we're just too eager
[1:04:36] we're trying to we we we don't get
[1:04:38] patient enough and we don't wait to
[1:04:40] where his face is revealed amen help us
[1:04:43] Lord God Bless you that's we're just
[1:04:46] finished for this morning if you could
[1:04:48] just stand with me while we pray
