[0:00] ruth chapter one start with verse one
[0:02] read to verse two
[0:04] and we're going to be focusing on verse
[0:06] two today and uh we could have read
[0:08] maybe a little bit further but i really
[0:10] just wanna focus on
[0:11] these details that are setting the scene
[0:14] for
[0:15] the book of ruth and for this tremendous
[0:17] happening that takes place
[0:18] in it and where our subject is about the
[0:21] bread of life and how the living bread
[0:23] of life has been made available to the
[0:25] bride in this end time
[0:26] and it's feasting on that bread that's
[0:28] going to lead us to a meeting in the air
[0:29] into the change of our bodies
[0:31] and it says now it came to pass in the
[0:33] days when the judges ruled that there
[0:35] was a famine in the land
[0:37] and a certain man of bethlehem judah
[0:39] went to sojourn in the country of moab
[0:41] he and his wife and his two sons and the
[0:44] name of the man was elimelech
[0:46] and the name of his wife was naomi and
[0:48] the name of his two sons mahlon
[0:50] and kilian efratees of bethlehem judah
[0:54] and they came into the country of moab
[0:56] and continued
[0:57] there god bless you you can take your
[0:59] seats
[1:01] well you can leave them when you leave
[1:02] but you can have your seats now
[1:04] while i remain standing i in the message
[1:07] kinsmen redeem i just want to pick right
[1:09] up where we were last time
[1:11] this was the last statement that we read
[1:13] we're looking at the setting of the book
[1:14] of ruth
[1:15] and we focused on chapter verse one last
[1:18] time
[1:19] and i want to just read this statement
[1:20] again because i believe it sums up a lot
[1:22] of our emphasis last wednesday
[1:24] brother braham says this book of ruth
[1:25] was one of the outstanding books that
[1:27] they accepted
[1:28] why if it's just a love story why would
[1:31] the writers and ancient sages accept
[1:34] this book as inspired
[1:35] it's just written to kind of tell the
[1:37] story of a wonderful happening between a
[1:39] woman who was a foreigner
[1:41] and a man who uh you know had pity upon
[1:44] her and married her and redeemed her
[1:46] if all it was was a love story why would
[1:48] it be canonized in the scripture why
[1:50] would it become part
[1:51] of this the old testament he says
[1:55] because there's a hidden revelation in
[1:57] it and just that phrase there ought to
[1:59] kind of
[2:00] strike a nerve inside of us
[2:03] because we believe that god has even in
[2:05] this last days
[2:06] preserved and made available to us
[2:08] hidden manna
[2:10] hidden revelation for us who are
[2:12] feasting in this end time
[2:13] it says there's a hidden revelation in
[2:15] it and in this hidden revelation
[2:17] you catch the real meanings you've got
[2:19] to see the revelation
[2:21] and understand the revelation and then
[2:22] if you do that you can catch the real
[2:24] meaning
[2:25] and in doing so i just love this phrase
[2:27] it'll bring you real close to god
[2:29] i desire to be closer to god than i am
[2:32] right now i want to be closer to god he
[2:34] says it'll bring you real close to god
[2:35] and i pray my whole soul this morning
[2:38] that god will catch every heart so
[2:40] spellbound
[2:41] so this is something that had some
[2:42] weight and force upon brother branham
[2:44] as he's ministering it christ being
[2:47] preached as the kinsmen redeemer
[2:49] wouldn't have been a foreign subject
[2:51] but there's something that he's seeing
[2:53] and something that he's
[2:54] breaking into something that's moving
[2:56] him that he's praying with all his soul
[2:59] that god would catch
[3:00] every heart so spellbound so attracted
[3:03] and so gravitated to this
[3:04] until he'll reveal himself just what he
[3:07] is in this story
[3:09] what he is to you how to accept him
[3:12] just to see him what he is in this story
[3:14] but then not just to see him in a story
[3:16] but to see what he is to us and then
[3:18] also how we can accept him for all that
[3:20] he is
[3:20] to us he says and when you once see it
[3:22] it's so simple
[3:23] you'll wonder how you ever went over the
[3:25] top of it but it can only be revealed by
[3:27] the holy spirit
[3:29] so the book of ruth holds a tremendous
[3:32] story a great story think of all the
[3:33] statements that brother branham made
[3:35] about
[3:35] this book it's something very
[3:37] significant something very special
[3:39] that just goes beyond a history to we
[3:41] understand
[3:42] everyday life to the hebrew people it
[3:44] goes beyond the love story but there's a
[3:46] hidden revelation in it
[3:47] and i believe it contains a hidden
[3:49] revelation for the bride of jesus christ
[3:52] and if look at verse one again and i'll
[3:54] read it
[3:55] and then try to maybe make some points
[3:57] back to what we ministered last time
[4:00] it says now it came to pass in the days
[4:02] when the judges
[4:03] ruled so it's set in the time period
[4:05] where this takes place
[4:06] a time when israel had not yet entered
[4:10] into having kings
[4:11] it was in a time when men just were
[4:14] living
[4:14] loose with god and they would come back
[4:16] to god when a judge would come they'd
[4:17] swing back to god and they're going
[4:19] back and forth between serving jehovah
[4:21] serving bail serving jehovah
[4:23] serving bail and there was a a lot of
[4:25] lukewarmness and a lot of ups and downs
[4:27] during this time period it says and
[4:29] there was a famine
[4:31] in the land we saw how this famine was a
[4:33] direct result
[4:34] of the children of god rejecting the
[4:36] lord having gotten away from the lord
[4:38] god said if you get away from me
[4:40] there'll be a judgment that comes and so
[4:42] this famine was a result of their
[4:43] disobedience
[4:44] and now the focus is on a certain man a
[4:47] certain man of bethlehem judah
[4:50] went to sojourn in the country of
[4:52] mohammed or go into the fields of moab
[4:54] the plains of moab to go to a place of
[4:56] the moabites
[4:57] and he comes from bethlehem judah he
[5:00] and his wife and his two sons this is
[5:04] how the story opens there's a famine
[5:05] and a man with his wife and two sons go
[5:08] to bethlehem
[5:09] go from bethlehem judah to moab and the
[5:12] word
[5:12] soldier they meant to leave just for a
[5:14] little while but ultimately come back
[5:16] like
[5:17] the things we're just going to take what
[5:18] we have now we're going to go for a
[5:19] little while
[5:20] into uh to moab and then just stay for a
[5:23] little bit and then we're going to come
[5:24] back into bethlehem judah that was their
[5:26] intent
[5:27] and i want to pick up with verse 2 and
[5:29] there was a lot more that we
[5:31] expressed in verse 1 last time but i
[5:33] feel impressed just to
[5:34] not belabor the foundation and now it's
[5:38] going to expound upon who this certain
[5:40] man was
[5:40] his wife and his two sons and it says in
[5:42] the name of the man
[5:44] was elimelech now there's the
[5:47] the setting to this story is important
[5:49] the fact that it says it was in judges
[5:51] we already saw why
[5:52] that was important the fact that there
[5:53] was a famine in the land we saw that
[5:55] that was important
[5:56] we realized that even saying that this
[5:58] man was from bethlehem judah was quite
[6:00] striking to come from a place of
[6:01] abundance and a place
[6:02] that was very fruitful and had gained
[6:04] its name because it was the house of
[6:05] bread
[6:06] and to see that they were intending to
[6:08] souljarn and just go for a little while
[6:10] into the the country of moab and to the
[6:13] field of moab we saw that to go that way
[6:15] they'd have to reverse the course of the
[6:17] exodus
[6:18] and go right back into the wilderness
[6:20] that god had called them out of
[6:22] so each each phrase that's being used
[6:24] thus far each
[6:25] kind of image that's being brought up is
[6:27] important for us to catch
[6:29] because it's said in a story not just
[6:30] for a love story
[6:32] it's not something where if you miss
[6:34] this part of the movie you're not going
[6:35] to understand the plot
[6:36] this is not just a love story this is
[6:38] not just something with the neat plot
[6:39] this is a book that has a hidden
[6:41] revelation in it and i believe there's
[6:43] meaning in every verse and every line
[6:45] and every phrase and there's a way that
[6:47] god is trying to convey this story
[6:49] such that if you if it can catch your
[6:51] heart spellbound
[6:52] he can begin to reveal himself to you
[6:55] and and then reveal himself what he is
[6:57] not just in this story but what he is to
[6:59] you and how to accept him and so each
[7:02] one of these details is important
[7:04] and now it's not just going to say a
[7:06] certain man left
[7:07] and went and these things happen and
[7:09] came back it gives you his name because
[7:11] the name is important
[7:12] his name was elimelech that's the
[7:14] combining of two
[7:16] uh two words eli and malek elie eli
[7:19] which means my god and molek which means
[7:21] king
[7:22] his name meant my god my king
[7:26] so his name is giving reverence to the
[7:28] one true god and
[7:30] recognizing god as his king
[7:33] and the rabbis of old and even the
[7:35] teachers in the rabbinic tradition
[7:37] say that elimelech was the son of salmon
[7:39] who we know married rahab after the fall
[7:41] of the walls of jericho and so this is
[7:44] that that shows some significance that
[7:46] here this captain
[7:48] of the army this great general salmon
[7:50] who married rahab
[7:51] they say that one of his sons is
[7:53] elimelech and then it's
[7:55] here that in his name that using this
[7:59] name
[7:59] elimelech and using this man as an
[8:01] example we begin to see that him
[8:04] and his family begin to portray the
[8:06] image of or dramatize
[8:08] israel as a nation god had his prophets
[8:12] even the hosea is rife with it there's a
[8:14] lot of different places
[8:16] where god uses a a a man or uses an
[8:19] individual uses a situation
[8:21] as the image of what's happening to
[8:23] israel on the whole
[8:24] god told his prophet to go do this and
[8:26] why are you having me do this
[8:27] because it portrays what israel has done
[8:30] and israel has taken to themselves to
[8:31] whoredoms and so i'm going to cause my
[8:33] prophet to do this so that they can see
[8:35] in the image of one man the image of
[8:37] israel and so elimelech and his family
[8:40] begin to portray
[8:41] israel they're actually dramatizing what
[8:44] israel is doing so here's a man
[8:45] whose name means my god and my king
[8:49] but in judges chapter 6 verse 1 and the
[8:52] children of israel did
[8:53] evil in the sight of the lord and the
[8:54] lord delivered them into the hand of
[8:56] midian
[8:57] seven years i want to i want to gently
[9:01] make this point because i
[9:02] even realize now i thought i was going
[9:04] to go further
[9:06] in my notes tonight than i
[9:09] am and so i left some quotes at home
[9:11] that deal with
[9:12] uh naomi and and them being backslid and
[9:15] leaving
[9:16] from israel but this this
[9:19] this verse here judges chapter 6 verse 1
[9:22] speaks of how israel was doing evil in
[9:24] the sight of the lord and they were
[9:25] delivered to the hands of the midians
[9:27] as you continue to read this it says
[9:28] there was a great famine that came in
[9:30] the land there was a dearth that came in
[9:31] the land
[9:31] and the midianites would come and the
[9:33] philistines would come and they would
[9:34] take all their harvest and all their
[9:36] crops and all their fruits
[9:37] and they would be left without substance
[9:39] as a direct result of their disobedience
[9:42] now we can make this conclusion
[9:45] that elimelech wasn't necessarily this
[9:47] righteous very faithful
[9:49] prudent man who is serving god in all
[9:51] his ways and was just
[9:52] unfortunately suffering because of the
[9:54] sins of israel we could just assume
[9:57] that he was also has forsaken god and
[10:00] was doing evil in the sight of the lord
[10:01] but this is what all
[10:02] israel is doing at the time and i want
[10:04] you to see that elimelech now is going
[10:06] to dramatize
[10:07] what israel is going to do and actually
[10:09] foreshadow the direction that israel is
[10:11] headed
[10:12] it says in judges chapter 17 verse 6 and
[10:15] those days that in those days
[10:17] there was no king in israel there was no
[10:19] earthly monarch there was no man
[10:21] that was set over them to rule them that
[10:23] god told samuel that if they do this
[10:25] he's going to take their men i'm going
[10:26] to take their land and take their taxes
[10:28] and take their fruit
[10:29] in those days there was no king but
[10:31] every man did that which was right in
[10:33] his own eyes
[10:34] because of that i can safely say that if
[10:36] the bible says every man did that which
[10:38] was right in his own eyes then perhaps
[10:39] elimelech was one of those men
[10:41] that was doing right in his own eyes
[10:44] but as it says that there was no king in
[10:46] israel elimelech foreshadows the
[10:48] rejection of god
[10:51] israel's rejection of god as their king
[10:54] because here's elimelech it says my god
[10:56] my king but now he's going to leave
[10:58] bethlehem judah he's going to leave this
[11:01] place in the promised land and he's
[11:02] going to reverse the exodus
[11:04] and cross go right past the dead sea
[11:06] cross the jordan river go in the wrong
[11:08] direction
[11:09] and go right back into moab a place that
[11:11] god had called them through
[11:12] when they entered into the promised land
[11:14] but now they're he's going to make that
[11:16] journey and he does it first before
[11:19] israel manifests its own desire to do
[11:22] what reject god
[11:23] as their king elimelech whose name means
[11:26] my god and my king
[11:28] is going to leave israel foreshadowing
[11:31] that israel will reject god
[11:33] in first samuel chapter 8 verses 6 and 7
[11:37] the people have come to samuel already
[11:40] and said we want a king so this kind of
[11:42] summarizes
[11:43] what samuel's response in the lord's
[11:45] response but the thing displeased samuel
[11:48] when they said give us a king to judges
[11:51] they didn't want judges they didn't want
[11:52] prophets they didn't want
[11:54] the way that god had been dealing with
[11:56] israel at the time but they said
[11:58] we want to be like other nations give us
[12:00] the king set a king over us and let him
[12:02] rule us
[12:03] and this really hurts samuel's feelings
[12:06] samuel took it personally
[12:08] and maybe this is uh a comfort to us to
[12:11] know that god's prophets took things
[12:12] personal
[12:13] and sometimes things happen and we take
[12:15] it personal and it hurts us very deeply
[12:17] and think oh well that that wasn't very
[12:18] nice or it would have been good if this
[12:20] happened and all well that
[12:21] that kind of hurts my feelings and
[12:23] samuel was feeling a little bit rejected
[12:25] and he prayed to the lord
[12:26] and in verse 7 and the lord said unto
[12:28] samuel hearken unto the voice of the
[12:30] people in all that they say unto thee in
[12:32] others do what they said
[12:34] i see made very very staggering he says
[12:36] for they have not rejected thee
[12:39] but they have rejected me that i should
[12:42] not reign over them and many of the
[12:45] translations say that i should not be
[12:48] their king and so when god uses this
[12:50] phrase that i should not
[12:52] reign over them he's saying they have
[12:53] not rejected you samuel as a prophet
[12:56] they have rejected me as their king they
[12:58] do not want me their god
[13:00] as their king it is no longer elimelech
[13:03] saying my god
[13:04] and my king but now god is being left
[13:06] out of it they want
[13:07] another man as their king and here's
[13:09] elimelech foreshadowing what israel
[13:11] would do reject god as king
[13:15] and so elimelech's journey
[13:18] into moab is an image of israel
[13:22] desiring to be like other nations in
[13:24] other countries
[13:26] and rejecting their king which was god
[13:29] and we could see that just in his name
[13:30] elimelech
[13:32] whose name would have been given
[13:33] patronage and honor to god as being
[13:34] their king we know that eventually
[13:36] israel
[13:37] no longer wants god as their king but
[13:39] wants an earthly fleshly monarch
[13:40] and that was a tendency of the flesh and
[13:43] it's still the same today
[13:45] that even and this is this is uh i guess
[13:48] it bears
[13:48] pointing out it's remarkable how that
[13:50] israel in doing so
[13:52] rejected god but yet god still lets it
[13:54] unfold because it portrays what
[13:56] the coming king jesus christ
[14:00] that there was going to be a king and he
[14:01] actually is going to allow them to
[14:03] choose
[14:04] choose saul to be their king or he's the
[14:05] one that's chosen to be king
[14:07] but then god's choice is going to be
[14:08] david who is a man after god's own heart
[14:11] who portrays and expresses these
[14:13] beautiful things about jesus christ
[14:14] that's going to come
[14:15] so even though in their disobedience
[14:17] they rejected god
[14:18] when they wanted an earthly king it was
[14:20] something that god was going to use to
[14:22] portray
[14:23] the king of kings that was going to come
[14:28] and it also is a reminder to us that
[14:31] even when it came time to choose a king
[14:34] that it was so easy for the people to
[14:36] look upon the one who was tall and had
[14:38] broad shoulders and
[14:39] the tall dark and handsome one the rich
[14:41] one the one who looked like he should be
[14:43] a king
[14:44] that's what israel wanted why because
[14:45] they judged with their eyes
[14:47] and they saw the prestige and the
[14:49] pretense or they wouldn't necessarily
[14:51] call it pretense they saw the prestige
[14:53] and the popularity and the power that
[14:54] came with having a king
[14:56] and they wanted that instead of what god
[14:58] offered them
[14:59] god was giving them a prophet well that
[15:01] may be a little bit controversial that
[15:02] may be a little bit
[15:03] uh there may be too much stigma
[15:05] associated with that that might not that
[15:07] may not make us look good
[15:08] with our neighbors and everyone else
[15:10] around us give us a king so we can be
[15:12] like everyone else and the flesh is
[15:14] still drawn to the things that catches
[15:16] the eye
[15:17] the flesh is still drawn to things that
[15:19] are popular and can be accepted more
[15:21] broadly and look better
[15:22] but when god came time for god to choose
[15:24] a king he didn't choose the handsome and
[15:27] good-looking saul
[15:28] he chose david who was ruddy and very
[15:30] very young and on the outside
[15:32] samuel was even like well okay i guess
[15:33] this is it
[15:36] but god warned him even as he began to
[15:38] choose he said man this firstborn son
[15:40] surely this man is king god said no man
[15:42] looks on the outside but i look on the
[15:44] inside
[15:45] so remember that as we go forward so the
[15:48] man the the name of the man was
[15:50] elimelech and the name of his wife
[15:52] naomi so here's elimelech my god my king
[15:55] he's married to naomi which means my
[15:57] delight
[15:58] my pleasure together it could be said
[16:01] that god is my king and my delight and
[16:03] my pleasure here's a union a marriage
[16:05] between one
[16:06] who acknowledges god as king and also
[16:08] one who is considered
[16:10] my delight or pleasure the name means
[16:12] pleasant
[16:13] and in the talmud they believe that this
[16:16] was uh naomi was a limoulek's niece
[16:18] now before you get all nervous that this
[16:20] story came out of arkansas
[16:22] it was a lot different back in the day
[16:24] and uh
[16:25] and so elimelech married his brother's
[16:27] daughter
[16:28] and so he is marrying uh this would have
[16:30] been a limitless niece so this would
[16:32] have been a family that's very
[16:33] uh within this tribe and within this
[16:35] nation
[16:36] that's within this family a very tight
[16:38] family and naomi it signifies the name
[16:41] signifies sweet or pleasant
[16:43] it's very possible that she was a
[16:44] beautiful woman and had a very sweet
[16:46] nature
[16:48] and and and she even makes reference to
[16:50] it later
[16:51] uh how when they see her and they greet
[16:53] her and they call her naomi she says no
[16:54] no you can't call me by naomi anymore
[16:56] because i'm not the same one that you
[16:58] saw when they left
[17:00] and i was pondering this character naomi
[17:03] this week
[17:04] and just as you can find other
[17:07] characters in the bible that portray
[17:09] different sides and could be used with
[17:11] different types
[17:12] and naomi has obviously joined with her
[17:14] husband and recognized and typed with
[17:15] israel
[17:17] and in some ways has to carry the shame
[17:18] and the reproach
[17:20] uh that's associated with that type but
[17:22] naomi becomes a very sympathetic
[17:24] character because in leaving
[17:27] it's not suggested at all it was naomi's
[17:29] idea to move to moab
[17:31] but if we understand the traditional
[17:34] family and
[17:35] how they would have worked then and what
[17:36] their rights would have been associated
[17:38] with and how
[17:38] the family would have been governed and
[17:40] naomi just follows her husband as he
[17:42] departs
[17:43] from israel's promised land the husband
[17:46] desires to go and so they just
[17:48] the the family's just gonna go with them
[17:50] dad wants to go move to moab
[17:52] what can you do you have to follow dad
[17:54] to moab
[17:55] my husband wants to go here well then
[17:57] you follow your husband that's where
[17:58] he's going
[17:59] my husband wants to do this she just did
[18:02] what she knew would be right and
[18:03] pleasing in the eyes of the lord
[18:04] she went and so in that way perhaps we
[18:06] could be we could have some sympathy for
[18:08] naomi think oh wow man those dastardly
[18:11] people and elimelech and that woman
[18:12] naomi
[18:13] mai they're just awful people elimelech
[18:16] is responsible for his misdeeds he's
[18:18] responsible
[18:18] for the decisions he makes but what
[18:20] would god expect naomi to do
[18:23] he would expect her to obey her husband
[18:26] as we could see that she's a
[18:27] sympathetic character as he departs
[18:29] israel's promised land
[18:31] and leaving bethlehem we pointed this
[18:33] out last time leaving bethlehem was a
[18:35] clear departure
[18:36] and a separation from god and his
[18:38] blessings clearly going back into the
[18:40] wilderness
[18:42] and as they leave elimelech and
[18:46] and naomi they're not leaving
[18:49] impoverished
[18:50] you say well there was a famine in the
[18:51] land so we could think wow there's a
[18:52] great famine in the land maybe they left
[18:54] uh poor and and and broken but they
[18:57] didn't leave impoverished and broken
[18:59] when he departed with his family naomi
[19:02] says in
[19:03] uh ruth chapter 1 verse 21 i'm just
[19:05] going to use those first four words of
[19:06] that verse she says i went out full
[19:09] by naomi's own testimony that when he
[19:11] when elimelech and uh
[19:13] her left bethlehem judah they didn't
[19:16] leave poor
[19:17] they left full which means with
[19:19] abundance
[19:20] and so it suggests that her husband's
[19:22] actions and even the actions of the
[19:24] families they fought him were rebellious
[19:25] against god's program
[19:28] they weren't leaving because everything
[19:29] was broken they weren't leaving just
[19:31] because there was a famine but they
[19:32] might have been taking advantage of an
[19:34] opportunity sell now the market's just
[19:36] right or let's cut our losses and get
[19:37] what we have now and go
[19:39] and they actually take something with
[19:40] them and says we left out full she says
[19:42] i'm coming back empty
[19:43] but she left with abundance and here
[19:46] she's following and going with her
[19:47] husband they're leaving with abundance
[19:49] back into the wilderness they're not
[19:51] leaving alone but they're leaving with
[19:52] their two sons
[19:54] it says in the name of his two sons
[19:56] elimelech and his wife
[19:58] leave in the name of their two sons his
[19:59] two sons and muhlan
[20:01] and kill him this is where it begins to
[20:04] get very interesting in terms of every
[20:06] of the names meaning something and all
[20:08] these details fitting together
[20:10] muhlan means infirmity the name in the
[20:13] hebrew muslim would speak of one who is
[20:15] sick and weak
[20:17] so this is the this is the name for one
[20:19] that was pleasant this is the one that
[20:20] came from one
[20:21] that would seem to be strong and
[20:22] beautiful kill it means pining
[20:25] this agonizing so and it means pining or
[20:27] consumption
[20:29] and as i began to study the name it
[20:31] means to to waste completely
[20:34] so here as they're leaving this with one
[20:37] a son who means sick and weakly another
[20:39] one means consumption or fully wasted
[20:42] i this is this is the condition of the
[20:45] family as they leave with these children
[20:48] these are derived the names are derived
[20:49] from weakness and consumption
[20:52] and as we continue to read we won't read
[20:53] it tonight both seem to die young
[20:57] we'll find in ruth chapter 4 that muhlan
[20:59] was married to ruth he's the one that
[21:00] was married to ruth the moabitess
[21:02] some along was the wife of ruth
[21:06] and it was killian the wife of orpah and
[21:08] if you're reading ahead in this and
[21:10] you're pondering the different meanings
[21:11] there's a lot of things that stand out
[21:13] in those two characters ruth and orpah
[21:15] and naomi even before they depart and
[21:18] the story the narrative focuses more on
[21:20] ruth and naomi
[21:22] but these very sons their names speak
[21:26] of weakness and wasting
[21:30] and this narrative elimelech and naomi
[21:32] bringing forth
[21:34] a son named that is sick and a son that
[21:37] is wasting
[21:38] raises the image of adam and eve
[21:42] as they come towards eden as they come
[21:44] out of a place of god's provision
[21:45] and through their disobedience bring
[21:47] what sickness and waste and upon all of
[21:49] humanity
[21:50] and now we see elimelech and naomi with
[21:52] their two sons of weakness and
[21:54] pining and consumption and wasting
[21:57] leaving and leaving out of
[21:59] bethlehem judah and going into moab
[22:02] and the scripture takes care to point
[22:04] this out
[22:06] efforties of bethlehem judah
[22:11] why we we already read that they left
[22:13] from bethlehem judah but why does it
[22:14] stop
[22:16] to describe elimelech naomi mahelan
[22:19] and kilian why did it stop to say that
[22:21] these were efforties
[22:23] of bethlehem judah why does it remind us
[22:25] again that they're from bethlehem judah
[22:26] but this time
[22:27] to make reference to ephitha
[22:31] why would why would it tell us of this
[22:33] and it holds significance to the story
[22:35] unfolding as i've already said before
[22:38] it's mentioned for a reason it's
[22:41] mentioned so that we can slow down and
[22:43] ponder just these things that are
[22:45] in this book and how it's more than just
[22:47] a love story it's more than just a
[22:48] narrative it's something that you
[22:49] you're not just reading it and then
[22:51] you'll be quizzed later and see how much
[22:52] you've comprehended what you read
[22:54] but this efforties of bethlehem judah is
[22:56] to signal and raise up this thought
[22:58] of this connection to this place in what
[23:00] this place would have meant scripturally
[23:03] in genesis chapter 35 verses 16 to 19
[23:07] is speaking of jacob and his family as
[23:10] they travel and they journeyed from
[23:11] bethel
[23:12] and there was but a little way to come
[23:15] to ephrath
[23:17] and rachel travailed and she had hard
[23:19] labor
[23:20] and it came to pass when she was in hard
[23:22] labor that the midwife said unto her
[23:24] fear not
[23:25] thou shalt have this son also i what a
[23:29] what a rejoicing for rachel at this time
[23:32] what a beautiful thing for her to be
[23:34] able to bring forth another
[23:36] son and she had brought forth joseph and
[23:38] now she is bringing forth and in hard
[23:39] labor to bring forth another son
[23:41] and we know of the hardness that rachel
[23:43] endured we know the difficulties that
[23:45] she went through and
[23:46] and now for her to believe that i am
[23:48] gonna have give a son to jacob give a
[23:51] son to israel
[23:52] she says fear not you're going to have a
[23:54] son and it came to pass
[23:56] as her soul was in departing it says for
[23:58] she died
[24:01] now think of this as they've traveled
[24:02] they came to the place of ephrath which
[24:04] was near bethel
[24:05] and now in this very place at this very
[24:07] spot on the ground
[24:08] as as rachel this one that was so loved
[24:11] by jacob
[24:12] as she's giving birth to another son her
[24:14] soul is departing her
[24:16] and she's going to die from childbirth
[24:18] it says that she
[24:19] called his name benoni this is what the
[24:23] mother called him as he's been born
[24:25] but his father called him benjamin
[24:28] so the mother his life is leaving her
[24:30] and she's in tormenting
[24:32] and she's struggling in hard labor and
[24:33] she's giving birth to another son to her
[24:36] husband
[24:36] through everything that she went through
[24:38] in this great travail and sorrow
[24:40] she gives birth to a son and says he's
[24:42] going to be called benanai
[24:43] but then the father gives him a
[24:45] different name and calls him benjamin
[24:48] it says and rachel died and was buried
[24:51] in the way
[24:52] to ephrath which is bethlehem
[24:56] here rachel think of this matriarch
[24:58] think of this woman
[25:00] there and her relationship to israel and
[25:02] the sons that she bore
[25:04] and now as she's giving birth she's
[25:06] going to birth this son
[25:08] where right there in bethlehem when she
[25:11] gives
[25:11] us she's going to die where right there
[25:13] in bethlehem
[25:14] and where is she buried right there in
[25:16] bethlehem and where is it that jacob
[25:18] mourns and places a stone
[25:19] upon her grave which in the bible refers
[25:21] she says is there to this day it was
[25:23] right there in bethlehem
[25:25] from that very spot from those very
[25:27] fields and that place came the cries of
[25:29] a mother
[25:30] who is dying and she gives birth to her
[25:32] son and as she cries out and pains and
[25:35] gives birth
[25:35] she calls his name benanim which means
[25:37] son of sorrow
[25:40] this is the son of sorrow she cries this
[25:42] out in bethlehem
[25:45] but then after the son is born and been
[25:47] given this name son of saul
[25:49] it's the father who says but to me he's
[25:51] going to be benjamin
[25:53] son of my right hand and so
[25:56] in one instance in one birth in a place
[25:58] called bethlehem
[25:59] as rachel his life is expired and
[26:02] bringing forth the sun
[26:03] she calls the son a man of sorrow but to
[26:06] the father he's going to be one that
[26:08] sets in his right hand
[26:09] and a beautiful picture of christ is
[26:11] painted
[26:12] in ephrath which is bethlehem christ is
[26:16] expressed
[26:18] in the bitterness of death isaiah 53 3
[26:20] he shall be called
[26:22] a man of sorrows but then he's raised to
[26:24] what the right hand of god
[26:26] scripture after scripture after
[26:27] scripture says he is at the right hand
[26:30] of the father
[26:30] i will set you at my right hand until
[26:33] all your enemies be made a footstool in
[26:35] its expressway
[26:36] in ephrath which is called bethlehem
[26:40] what a place to see such an expression
[26:44] and how is it that this is and and i say
[26:48] this
[26:51] because again i i think it's just so
[26:52] important to recognize that this is not
[26:54] just well
[26:55] boaz boaz is kind of a nice type of of
[26:58] christ
[26:59] these are things that are placed right
[27:01] between judges and
[27:02] and joshua and placed into this placing
[27:05] of this book
[27:06] so as to understand who god is to you
[27:11] and how he thought of you if he had
[27:14] caused
[27:14] jacob's journey to come to this place
[27:16] this field and this
[27:18] this patch of glenn and this and this
[27:21] place called ephrath which is going to
[27:23] later be called bethlehem
[27:24] to cause one of such a stature of rachel
[27:28] to give birth to a son and then when
[27:30] he's dying
[27:31] when she's dying she calls out his name
[27:33] a man of sorrow but then the father says
[27:35] but to me
[27:36] he shall be the son of my right hand god
[27:38] is doing that to express something
[27:41] he's in malachi chapter 4 verses 2 to 4
[27:47] it says but thou bethlehem ephrata
[27:53] though thou be little among the
[27:55] thousands of judah
[27:58] think of all the cities and the
[27:59] populations and the churches and
[28:00] everything that would have been judah
[28:02] now the prophet speaks thou bethlehem
[28:04] ephrata
[28:06] yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
[28:08] me
[28:09] that is born to be ruler in israel
[28:13] born to be ruler in israel but what is
[28:15] he first a man of sorrow
[28:17] born to sit at the right hand to be the
[28:18] messiah that will restore the kingdom of
[28:20] israel but what will he be first
[28:22] he'll be a man of sorrow who's going
[28:24] forth had been
[28:25] from old from everlasting therefore will
[28:27] he give them up until the time that she
[28:29] which travaileth hath
[28:30] brought forth then the remnant of his
[28:32] brethren shall return unto the children
[28:34] of israel
[28:36] and he shall stand and feed in the
[28:38] strength of the lord
[28:40] and the majesty of the name of the lord
[28:41] his god and they shall abide
[28:44] for now shall he be great unto the ends
[28:47] of the earth
[28:49] who is mike a prophesying of jesus
[28:51] christ
[28:52] and this is the prophecy that spoke that
[28:54] the messiah would come from where
[28:56] bethlehem he would come from bethlehem
[28:59] ephrata he would not come from another
[29:01] mighty city in judah of all the
[29:03] thousands that were in judah he would
[29:05] not come from the one that everyone
[29:07] would have picked he would not come
[29:08] from the capital city that would later
[29:10] be established of jerusalem he would not
[29:12] come from one of these other cities of
[29:13] refuge
[29:14] he would come from a no-name place as it
[29:16] were he would come from bethlehem
[29:19] but it was a place that god had marked
[29:22] it was a place that god had allowed
[29:23] benjamin to come forth for the mother
[29:25] and her and her and her labor to declare
[29:27] him to be a man of sorrow
[29:29] the father to reclaim that and say he
[29:30] will be a man of the son of my right
[29:32] hand
[29:32] god allow that to happen and then many
[29:35] years later he's going to allow a story
[29:37] to unfold
[29:38] of my god my king being rejected in
[29:41] elimelech leaving bethlehem judah going
[29:43] into muabai
[29:44] but think of the whole story that's
[29:45] unfolding it's still a story of
[29:47] redemption
[29:52] the hidden revelation of the book of
[29:54] ruth is christ
[29:56] and you might say well we're glad you're
[29:58] catching up brother here and
[30:00] that's so good to know so we were kind
[30:02] of worried about you know
[30:04] just exactly where you were going with
[30:05] this
[30:07] is the one that's revealed in this
[30:11] christ is the one that's revealed in
[30:12] this
[30:14] but how many see them
[30:18] they can all tell you that this is this
[30:20] book speaks of jesus christ
[30:22] and they can tell you that even that
[30:24] jehovah the old is jesus of the new they
[30:26] can tell you
[30:27] that christ is the redeemer he's the
[30:28] messiah spoke of and david
[30:30] prophesied of him and this prophet
[30:32] prophesied of him and then we can look
[30:34] to the new testament say it's christ
[30:36] that comes he's the messiah
[30:37] and the whole church is built upon the
[30:39] revelation of jesus christ and it's
[30:41] jesus christ that's
[30:42] coming in these different scriptures and
[30:43] these different verses everyone can pay
[30:45] lip service to it so when i say the
[30:47] hidden revelation the book of ruth
[30:49] christ a lot of people could say well
[30:50] that's not a hidden revelation
[30:52] but to see them is a revelation just to
[30:55] be able to say well that's crisis being
[30:57] portrayed in boaz and it's this that's
[30:58] being portrayed in ruth
[30:59] and it's actually being portrayed in
[31:00] written naomi people can read just like
[31:02] they're reading the newspaper
[31:04] and come to understand some knowledge
[31:05] but if you want to know them it's got to
[31:07] be a revelation
[31:10] and so i believe that as you read this
[31:12] you should desire and pray
[31:13] that christ would be made alive to you
[31:15] by revelation
[31:17] that i do not just want to read the book
[31:18] of ruth and say yes yes it speaks of
[31:20] jesus christ but there's christ that's
[31:22] hidden in the word
[31:23] and the christ that's hidden in the word
[31:25] i want revealed to me
[31:30] someone can tell you that in this
[31:33] picture somewhere is hidden the bobcat
[31:36] and you could just trust him that it's
[31:37] in there and someone say do you know
[31:39] what's hidden that picture he said yeah
[31:41] bobcat
[31:42] because the very title of it says hidden
[31:44] bobcat
[31:46] in this picture somewhere is a bobcat
[31:48] and you can believe that there's a
[31:49] bobcat in there somewhere
[31:52] i believe it's in there and someone can
[31:55] tell you i've seen it it's in there
[31:57] and everyone can say yeah christ is in
[31:59] the book of ruth christ is in the book
[32:00] of ruth but what happens when you look
[32:02] at that picture and you see it for
[32:03] yourself
[32:04] what happens when it's quickened to you
[32:06] and revealed to you and you see it
[32:07] there's it's something different than
[32:08] someone telling you
[32:10] and what is it you do and someone wants
[32:11] to say there's a bobcat in there and
[32:12] it's right you're like no don't show me
[32:14] now
[32:15] i want to see it for myself and that's
[32:17] how we ought to be with everything
[32:18] that's in the word of god
[32:20] i don't want just somebody explaining it
[32:22] to me and telling me and trying to tell
[32:24] me this is how it is and you better
[32:26] believe it and you knuckleheads better
[32:27] just believe it
[32:28] and you better just believe it i want to
[32:30] see it for myself
[32:32] it's not enough you just take it from my
[32:33] word and just believe what brother
[32:35] aaron's trying to tell you
[32:36] no see what god's trying to show you
[32:40] i'd much rather you leave here with the
[32:42] revelation direct from god
[32:43] than understanding a word i said well i
[32:46] might not have seen what you were seeing
[32:48] brother here and
[32:48] but god showed me something very special
[32:51] god showed me something very
[32:52] supernatural
[32:53] i'll be honest i've had times i've
[32:55] preached what i thought was very
[32:56] inspired very anointed and thought i'd
[32:58] seen things
[32:58] and you're done and god blesses the
[33:00] service and someone comes up and says
[33:01] that service was amazing
[33:02] i can't believe what you brought out
[33:04] that was tremendous how this is what i
[33:06] saw and i'm going
[33:08] yeah that's exactly what i meant
[33:12] exactly what i meant siri please take a
[33:15] note
[33:17] i mean because it's like wow the things
[33:19] that god wants to reveal to you
[33:21] the things that he wants you to see the
[33:23] hidden revelation of the book of ruth
[33:25] all the nominal christians cry it's
[33:27] christ it's christ but i want to see him
[33:30] i want to see him in every verse i want
[33:33] to see him not just for what he is in
[33:34] this story
[33:35] but what he is to me and how to accept
[33:38] him
[33:40] and let me say this the hidden
[33:42] revelation of the book of ruth is christ
[33:44] but not just christ
[33:46] but also his bride because you just
[33:49] brother brown says not just see
[33:53] what he is in that story but what he is
[33:56] to you
[33:57] and how to accept him and so if you
[34:00] understand what he is to you it tells
[34:03] you what you are if he reveals your
[34:07] himself to you as bridegroom what would
[34:09] that tell you
[34:11] your bride that would have to be the
[34:13] necessary conclusion
[34:14] if he's wanting to reveal himself to you
[34:17] as bridegroom that's a man that's about
[34:19] to be married then that tells me that i
[34:21] am part of this bride this body that is
[34:23] going to be married to christ
[34:24] it is in the revealing of christ that
[34:26] that imparts to you
[34:28] his attributes and characteristics when
[34:30] he reveals himself to you as a healer
[34:32] what does that make you
[34:33] healed when he reveals himself to you as
[34:35] deliverer what does that make him to you
[34:37] make you delivered when he reveals
[34:40] himself to you what he is to you
[34:42] it has something to do with you
[34:43] recognizing who you are
[34:45] and a lot of it maybe as part of it is
[34:47] accepting him
[34:48] but another part is accepting what he's
[34:50] made us
[34:52] accepting who we are and that'll become
[34:55] a very key part later on when it comes
[34:57] to the exchange
[34:58] between ruth and boaz and then even the
[35:00] exchange
[35:01] that takes place between ruth and naomi
[35:03] in naomi's ultimate declaration
[35:05] she came to understand that she was not
[35:08] just a moabitess
[35:09] she was not just the widow of muhammad
[35:11] she was more than that but she was now
[35:14] redeemed
[35:16] and so the hidden revelation of the book
[35:18] of ruth is not just
[35:20] i i say that very delicately not just
[35:22] christ but
[35:23] maybe not just the part of christ we're
[35:25] thinking but also his bride
[35:29] as we mentioned before elimelech's dad
[35:32] was salmon
[35:36] salmon was a descendant descendant of
[35:38] judah
[35:40] through tamar
[35:44] now
[35:48] i've said this and even it was beautiful
[35:51] for me as i'm working through it
[35:54] the connections already made before we
[35:56] ever get to boaz
[35:58] right but look at now who eliminate
[36:02] is look what would be represented in
[36:04] this family
[36:06] of of judah and even tamar
[36:12] and the story of how they would go back
[36:14] into moab
[36:16] and come back naomi would come back by
[36:18] herself with ruth without the men
[36:21] without the men of the family without
[36:22] elimelech without her two sons
[36:26] because the revelation is not just of
[36:28] christ
[36:29] but of his bride in matthew chapter 1
[36:32] verses 1 to 6
[36:36] the book of the generation of jesus
[36:38] christ
[36:44] that's pretty pretty thick language
[36:48] the book of the generation of jesus
[36:51] christ
[36:53] notices the designations the son of
[36:55] david
[36:56] the son of abraham so when it's it's
[36:59] telling us the story the book the book
[37:00] of the generation of jesus christ
[37:02] is going to begin by first calling him
[37:04] the son of david and then also
[37:06] the son of abraham and so there's going
[37:08] to be a connection
[37:09] of abraham he is the son of abraham and
[37:11] he's also the son of david
[37:13] and it gives us these generations and
[37:15] these begettings abraham begat isaac
[37:19] where does it begin with abraham
[37:22] our sunday school class is beginning
[37:24] with abraham in a new in a new lesson
[37:26] here recently to teach him about abraham
[37:28] and we were fellowshipping on it
[37:30] uh the other day our families together
[37:32] with the sunday school teachers i
[37:34] believe his sister jennifer
[37:35] was sharing it and and i just expressed
[37:38] how it's a perfect place to begin
[37:40] because really in the book of genesis
[37:42] it's a really quick race to try to get
[37:44] to abraham
[37:45] i mean look at creation i mean look at
[37:47] creation now
[37:49] and to think that god covered it in just
[37:50] a few verses
[37:52] and even the fall of bands covered very
[37:54] quickly and their banishment from the
[37:55] garden covered very quickly
[37:56] and the fall of man covered very quickly
[37:58] and the flood very quickly and they
[37:59] didn't know why
[38:00] because it's just these first 10 11
[38:02] chapters are all trying to set the stage
[38:04] so god
[38:05] came god spoke to abram that's when the
[38:09] story begins the first part
[38:10] is setting the scene it's telling us
[38:12] it's like to say that there was a famine
[38:14] in the land and the time of the book of
[38:15] judges and a
[38:16] certain man of bethlehem judah left with
[38:18] his wife and two sons
[38:19] that's what genesis 1 to 11 is trying to
[38:22] say this is the setting
[38:23] for a man named abram so you can
[38:26] understand where
[38:26] abram comes from and what he's doing so
[38:28] now when the story begins to be told
[38:30] about jesus christ
[38:32] it begins with this generations
[38:34] beginning
[38:35] with abraham it says abraham beget isaac
[38:42] and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat
[38:45] judah
[38:46] and his brethren and judah beget faires
[38:50] and zara of
[38:51] tamar now kesha this is the first it's
[38:54] the first mention
[38:56] of a woman
[38:59] and there has began esron and sram begat
[39:03] aram
[39:06] should i switch mics
[40:05] that didn't work
[40:16] all right let's start over ruth chapter
[40:18] one
[40:20] this sounds better anyways let's just
[40:21] start ruth chapter one
[40:25] well we'll start we'll back up a little
[40:27] bit
[40:29] it is judah that begets two sons of
[40:32] tamar
[40:32] through these sons of tamar that's the
[40:35] lineage now
[40:36] that's coming on down to where nassan
[40:38] begat salmon
[40:40] now in verse five notice how salmon
[40:42] begat boaz
[40:44] of rahab this is the second woman that's
[40:47] mentioned in
[40:47] the book of the generation of jesus
[40:49] christ the son of david
[40:51] and the son of abraham and tamar now
[40:53] rahab
[40:54] and boaz begat obed of ruth
[40:58] and this is where the story is now you
[41:00] begin to realize well of course
[41:01] this is a very important story this
[41:03] story is revealing to us more than just
[41:04] a love story
[41:05] but now we see that it comes to this uh
[41:08] this spot where you have boaz who's
[41:10] birthed by rahab
[41:12] and it's that same bow as who's beget oh
[41:15] bed of ruth through ruth came obed and
[41:18] old obed beget jesse jesse beget
[41:21] david the king and david the king begat
[41:25] solomon of her that had been the wife of
[41:28] uriahs
[41:32] oh and what a incredible
[41:35] recitation as you would continue to read
[41:37] you'd find that these are the four women
[41:38] before you get to marry
[41:40] that are mentioned in the lineage of
[41:41] jesus christ
[41:44] and we can say what is the mystery of
[41:46] tamar
[41:47] rahab ruth and the wife of uriah
[41:50] bathsheba
[41:51] every single one of these women are
[41:53] gentiles
[41:56] every single one they were not of the
[41:57] land of the of the jews they were not
[41:59] part of the tribe of judah but these are
[42:01] ones that are brought in under
[42:02] extraordinary circumstances
[42:04] and tamar how she so desired to have a
[42:07] son
[42:08] of her own and to give seed to her
[42:10] husbands and even how she played the
[42:12] part with judah to make sure
[42:13] that there was seed of judah that would
[42:15] be come from her that would be
[42:17] conceived of her and to continue the
[42:19] lineage of judah
[42:20] and then you have the story of samoan
[42:22] taking who the harlot
[42:25] of jericho the one who had the secret of
[42:28] the two
[42:29] spies that came into her home and it's
[42:31] through her that begets the further
[42:33] lineage of one boaz who's going to take
[42:35] to him the wife of ruth who is the
[42:37] moabitess
[42:38] and then it continues to where she in
[42:40] her lineage from jesse
[42:42] comes david who is the king and then his
[42:44] son solomon
[42:45] is the one that's born of bathsheba
[42:51] the mystery that's being contained in
[42:53] the book of ruth
[42:54] is not just jesus christ but that he's
[42:57] going to have a gentile
[42:58] bride that's the mystery of god
[43:01] that's a mystery that had been declared
[43:02] to all the prophets it's the mystery
[43:04] that's still hidden
[43:05] to a lot of people today when they look
[43:06] into the word of god and say oh the
[43:08] mystery of god's going to be finished
[43:10] they don't recognize that the very
[43:11] mystery of god
[43:12] that was been preserved not just with
[43:14] christ but that christ would have a
[43:16] gentile bride
[43:17] that was a mystery that came together
[43:20] and so despite naomi's coming
[43:25] heartache and bitterness and loss they
[43:28] feel like they're leaving a pretty bad
[43:29] situation there's famine this
[43:31] the indicators don't look good to the
[43:33] housing market there's a there's a
[43:34] recession coming on and it doesn't look
[43:36] good for the economies
[43:37] let's get out of here while we can let's
[43:39] make this decision let's
[43:40] let's move and let's let's take what we
[43:42] have and let's leave out full and we'll
[43:44] come back eventually we're just doing
[43:45] this for a season
[43:48] we know what's coming
[43:51] we know elimelech is going gonna die we
[43:54] know when he's dead that their two sons
[43:55] are gonna despise even the long
[43:58] i'm going to marry two moabites women
[44:01] those two sons are gonna die
[44:03] and despite the coming heartache and
[44:05] loss for naomi
[44:06] god had a greater plan for all of it
[44:09] god knows just exactly how to allow
[44:11] things to happen
[44:13] for he's going to get the glory and his
[44:14] story is going to be the one that's told
[44:17] no matter what people try to do no
[44:18] matter how they may try to attack it no
[44:20] they may try to
[44:20] malign it try to take ownership of it
[44:23] make it their own pain make it their own
[44:25] story or make it all about them god has
[44:27] a way of bringing it around to where
[44:28] it's all about him
[44:30] it's his story and i've had this
[44:33] statement that i wanted to read it's
[44:34] very lengthy
[44:36] and we'll and we're going to close with
[44:37] this i'm just going to read to you
[44:38] several paragraphs
[44:40] of why little bethlehem was preached in
[44:43] 1963
[44:46] december 14th of 1963 why little
[44:48] bethlehem and it was preached here in
[44:50] phoenix
[44:51] and brother brown begins in paragraph 42
[44:54] and and if you could just follow me
[44:55] i think we might uh i know you don't
[44:57] trust me at this point in this regards
[44:59] but i think we might actually be
[45:00] short tonight uh but in paragraph
[45:04] 42 it says man had been fixing a place
[45:06] for the king to be born
[45:08] there was more greatest religious places
[45:10] and historical places for the king
[45:12] instead of this little bethlehem because
[45:15] they had been looking forward to the
[45:17] messiah and they had it in their minds
[45:18] even these scriptures said
[45:20] the messiah will come suddenly to the
[45:21] temple and all these different
[45:23] prophecies so they had it fixed in their
[45:24] mind just exactly
[45:25] how he would be and where he would be
[45:28] places for instance like shiloh
[45:30] shiloh was where the ark was pitched
[45:31] first we know as we come across the
[45:33] jordan to this side
[45:34] in palestine and where the ark was set
[45:36] up for its first place of worship
[45:38] worship place
[45:39] or gilgal zion zion a great place gilgal
[45:41] also
[45:42] and we'll skip a little bit because he
[45:44] begins to describe jerusalem
[45:46] some he says and when he did when he set
[45:49] it up
[45:50] instead of them fixing him a place at
[45:53] jerusalem
[45:55] this kingdom that was later this city
[45:57] that was later set up by david it became
[45:58] such a central point to their religion a
[46:00] central point to israel
[46:01] he didn't fix it put him in a place of
[46:03] jerusalem or one of these great
[46:04] historical spots
[46:06] he was born in bethlehem the smallest of
[46:09] all the cities
[46:10] art thou not least among the princes of
[46:12] judea but out of these shall come a
[46:15] governor that shall rule my people
[46:17] and this great proud jerusalem and all
[46:19] the other cities were rejected
[46:21] or maybe they could took some of the
[46:23] places places of refuge
[46:25] the great place like hebron kedus or
[46:28] ramoth gilead
[46:29] one of those great refuge cities because
[46:31] he was to be our refuge
[46:33] if we would like to try to fix in our
[46:35] own mind we might have took say
[46:38] well now if this great king coming which
[46:40] will be our refuge
[46:42] he should be born in one of these great
[46:44] memorial places of a refuge like ramoth
[46:46] gilead or kadosh
[46:47] kedis or one of those he's getting into
[46:50] the mind of the people like if god's
[46:52] gonna be somewhere
[46:53] if god's gonna have a king where would
[46:55] he come from
[46:57] where would he be what would he identify
[47:00] himself with if we're trying to
[47:01] recognize the fingerprints of god if
[47:03] we're wanting to believe that god is
[47:04] moving if you want to understand
[47:05] that god is behind something he's saying
[47:07] that we have a way of judging things we
[47:09] have a
[47:10] metrics that we use and we have
[47:11] statistics and models that we go by
[47:13] to determine whether we believe this is
[47:15] the word of god or we believe this is
[47:17] the move of god and these are the things
[47:18] that go on he says we would have tried
[47:20] to fix it like that
[47:22] in our minds that's what we would have
[47:24] tried it would have to be jerusalem this
[47:26] great city of jerusalem
[47:27] the place where solomon built the temple
[47:29] the place that david
[47:30] established the kingdom this would have
[47:32] to be the place the messiah would come
[47:34] or maybe one of these great historical
[47:35] places
[47:37] but it's little bethlehem he says but
[47:39] you see
[47:40] god has other ways of doing things
[47:43] he knows how to do things right and now
[47:46] by the mind of god
[47:48] and the help of god we try to say why
[47:50] that this happened
[47:52] because everything works just exactly
[47:54] right in god's great program
[47:57] this is how he said and now by the mind
[47:59] of god and the help of god brother
[48:00] branham is
[48:01] wanting to express this by the mind of
[48:03] god and the help of god i want to
[48:05] express to you
[48:06] why this happened he's wanting to
[48:10] cat for the people to catch why did god
[48:12] choose bethlehem
[48:15] why did he choose that city why did he
[48:18] choose that place and then he makes it
[48:20] even more personal
[48:21] as he says because everything works
[48:23] according to god's great program he says
[48:24] and i want you people here at phoenix
[48:26] and around
[48:27] to try to get this i believe we could
[48:30] take that personal those who are
[48:31] visiting from outside of phoenix tonight
[48:33] he'll be like well
[48:34] thank you we're good he says the people
[48:36] around here
[48:37] at phoenix and around to try to get this
[48:40] what is it he wants them to get that
[48:42] remember that god knows what he's doing
[48:45] and he takes simple means to do it by
[48:49] because if he does something by some
[48:50] great outstanding something then god
[48:52] never does things like that
[48:53] he never did it in all the history of
[48:54] the bible god never did deal never did
[48:57] it any time
[48:58] take any group of people to do anything
[49:01] god
[49:01] takes an individual what does that mean
[49:04] there's not one church or one
[49:06] organization or any kind of move that
[49:09] can tell you
[49:10] that they are the bride because the
[49:13] bride is made up of individuals
[49:15] it will not be a dot-com it will not be
[49:17] an ink it will not be an organization it
[49:18] will not be a mantra not be something
[49:20] you can carry a card for
[49:21] he says when god does something it's not
[49:23] an organization it's not something big
[49:25] it's not something outstanding
[49:26] in the eyes of the world god never does
[49:28] something like that god never did deal
[49:30] any time take any group to do anything
[49:32] god takes an
[49:33] individual you are the one
[49:37] you one person and god never changes his
[49:41] program
[49:42] because in his first program he must
[49:44] always remain with that program
[49:47] and this is why we could say that the
[49:49] book one of the reasons why we can say
[49:50] the book of ruth is so outstanding
[49:52] because it doesn't reveal what god is to
[49:54] a church it doesn't reveal what god is
[49:56] to a people
[49:56] it doesn't reveal what god is to some
[49:58] organization it reveals what god is in
[50:01] that story
[50:02] and what he is to you it's to the
[50:04] individual
[50:05] and how you can receive them and you're
[50:07] not being received because you go to the
[50:09] right church you're not being received
[50:10] because you're part of the right kind of
[50:12] program in the world
[50:13] you're being received because as an
[50:14] individual you see what he is to you
[50:18] god takes an individual because that's
[50:20] his first program
[50:22] he must always remain with that program
[50:25] now skip a little bit to paragraph 47
[50:27] just a little bit and now when israel
[50:29] came over the river of jordan
[50:31] now try to catch this when israel
[50:34] crossed over into the land brother
[50:35] iran's wanting you to understand why
[50:37] little bethlehem
[50:38] what does it represent what does it
[50:40] signify to us the promised land
[50:42] there was a gentile woman that we know
[50:44] is rahab the harlot
[50:46] and she asked for mercy and she received
[50:48] mercy she received mercy as long as she
[50:50] stayed under the scarlet cord
[50:52] and that's the only way she could have
[50:54] mercy it was a sign
[50:55] a token that was given her we have a
[50:58] token today
[50:59] also and we're safe as long as we stay
[51:02] under our scarlet cord the blood of
[51:03] jesus christ
[51:05] as an individual not a group an
[51:08] individual we must
[51:10] we each must stay under that scarlet
[51:12] cord
[51:13] of the blood of jesus christ
[51:19] as an individual i realized
[51:22] um that many times when a minister or
[51:25] pastor preaches
[51:27] he has to be the partaker first of what
[51:29] he's going to be speaking to
[51:31] the people and ministering on pure joy
[51:34] and being numb and and feeling and
[51:37] having some feeling
[51:39] uh what i've what i've reaped from that
[51:41] is i felt very very uncomfortable
[51:44] over the last couple weeks a lot of
[51:46] different things making me feel
[51:47] uncomfortable a lot of things maybe
[51:49] making me feel unsettled and i realize
[51:51] well i'm feeling maybe these are things
[51:52] that
[51:53] this is the way things have been and i i
[51:55] haven't been feeling this and i need to
[51:56] i need to know how god uses these
[51:58] feelings and these emotions to
[51:59] understand them
[52:00] and as i was processing it today and
[52:02] thinking about how i was feeling
[52:03] and wanting to recognize this connection
[52:06] as god deals with my heart and many
[52:07] times
[52:08] he deals with you i'll say this as a
[52:10] pastor he'll deal with your heart and
[52:11] you'll feel something
[52:12] and you think oh oh i didn't know oh and
[52:15] then you realize oh
[52:16] oh now i know that it's god dealing with
[52:18] your heart for someone else's benefit
[52:21] he's dealing he's giving you the
[52:22] feelings he's walking you through paces
[52:24] he's causing you to experience something
[52:26] for my own growth absolutely from my own
[52:28] personal experience so i could be closer
[52:30] with christ yes
[52:30] but then also to to be able to help you
[52:33] to understand what you're going through
[52:34] to find things in the word of god to
[52:36] study and pray
[52:37] and then bring something out that can
[52:38] address those very things
[52:40] that god has given you the experience
[52:42] and the burden of for the people's
[52:43] benefit
[52:45] and when brother branham says here that
[52:46] he comes to an individual
[52:49] and he says that we have the token today
[52:51] and he says
[52:52] as an individual not a group an
[52:54] individual
[52:56] i think we should all be honest with
[52:58] ourselves how that
[53:00] we have this this part of us that wants
[53:03] to be able to blend into the crowd
[53:05] and find safety in numbers
[53:08] and be able to say well i can't be wrong
[53:11] because look at so many other people
[53:13] that think the same thing and
[53:14] or well i i don't know what's right and
[53:16] i'm not sure what to do so
[53:18] i'm just gonna follow the crowd i just
[53:20] want someone to tell me what to do and
[53:21] and whatever
[53:22] headquarters says to do we'll do it and
[53:24] what everyone else is doing we're gonna
[53:25] do it
[53:26] and then you just kind of follow in that
[53:27] line and you kind of just go along with
[53:29] the crowd and go along with the group
[53:30] and everyone has this mob mentality
[53:32] and we feel very safe and comfortable
[53:34] within a message construct
[53:36] and these message structures and these
[53:37] ideas and these traditions and the way
[53:39] things are done
[53:40] and we rest not in a personal experience
[53:44] with jesus christ
[53:45] but in the structure that the church has
[53:47] provided the structure that our family
[53:49] has followed and told the line with
[53:51] and we think all the tokens apply to my
[53:53] home my family's applied the token the
[53:54] church has applied the token
[53:55] everyone's done it but listen you won't
[53:57] get by as a part of a group move or a
[53:59] church move
[54:00] you're going to get by by having an
[54:02] individual personal experience with
[54:04] jesus christ
[54:06] and he emphasizes this as to the
[54:08] individuals to the individual
[54:09] why little bethlehem just a solitary
[54:11] single little city
[54:13] because it was a message to the
[54:14] individual brother branham identifies
[54:17] rahab as being one of the things i want
[54:18] the people here at phoenix to try to get
[54:22] this
[54:24] god has a way of doing things i hope
[54:26] that god can help me he says and
[54:28] try to try to get you to see why this
[54:30] happened and he begins
[54:31] with rahab and then this rahab after she
[54:35] was spared she got all her people in
[54:36] everything that was under the cord was
[54:38] saved just like when god in egypt when
[54:40] all was under the blood was saved
[54:42] all was under the scarlet cord was saved
[54:44] and all under the blood of jesus is
[54:45] saved
[54:46] all from out from under it is lost and
[54:48] ready for destruction
[54:50] then we understand by history that she
[54:52] was courted by some general
[54:54] and he uses he comes to the name here in
[54:56] a moment but as he's saying he goes i
[54:58] don't know his name right now in the
[54:59] israeli army
[55:01] and she finally married this man they
[55:02] settled up here in this near this little
[55:04] place and her son salmon
[55:06] was one who founded bethlehem but he's
[55:09] coming through the connection
[55:11] rahab in salmon and salmon found
[55:14] bethlehem
[55:15] see a gentile is connected with it to
[55:18] begin with
[55:20] a gentile rahab the harlot
[55:23] why little bethlehem what's this
[55:26] revelation in the book of ruth
[55:27] that once you see it you'll wonder why
[55:30] you ever went over the top but what's
[55:31] this hidden revelation that when you see
[55:32] it
[55:33] it'll bring you really close to god
[55:36] not a story of a redeeming redeemer to
[55:39] israel
[55:40] to this day a rabbi or a jew could take
[55:42] you and twist you up and use the
[55:43] scripture and
[55:44] and reject the new testament tell you
[55:46] why jesus wasn't the messiah
[55:48] and and even be able to convince you
[55:49] scripturally how that they are god's
[55:51] chosen people and the messiah is going
[55:52] to come to them and we as believers
[55:54] have to say well you know you're right
[55:55] he is going to reveal himself to you
[55:56] again
[55:57] and recognize their place in the
[55:59] scripture and the prophecies to them
[56:01] but it's not just christ the kinsmen of
[56:03] israel but it's christ who in the
[56:05] beginning
[56:06] called abram not a jew but a gentile
[56:09] called him out from among the nations
[56:10] and said i would make you great
[56:12] and would give him a seed and the seed
[56:14] would be christ and then we have the
[56:15] special connection
[56:17] with christ that we are not just brought
[56:19] in after the fact because israel
[56:21] rejected it
[56:21] but god in the beginning knew god in the
[56:24] beginning knew that israel would reject
[56:26] him
[56:26] why so he could bring in his truly
[56:29] beloved
[56:30] the bride of christ a gentile
[56:34] and that's why he allows these things to
[56:36] happen even in the story of ruth
[56:38] but a gentiles connected it within the
[56:40] beginning rahab the harlot
[56:42] it says now we find out that salmon
[56:44] founded this city little city of
[56:45] bethlehem
[56:46] and he begat boaz and boaz the one who
[56:49] married ruth
[56:51] another gentile and we are following
[56:54] this lineage now
[56:55] ruth she was a moabite and she married
[56:58] boaz
[56:59] and came into this little city just in
[57:01] barley season
[57:03] and he says oh if we had the time this
[57:06] morning
[57:07] till on that i'd owe my wife six dresses
[57:10] afterwards
[57:12] it's because at the beginning he's
[57:14] having a conversation with his wife and
[57:15] he said i'm going to be out at 10
[57:16] o'clock
[57:18] and she looked at me and said if i'm not
[57:19] out and she looked at me and i said
[57:21] if i'm not out by 10 o'clock i'll buy
[57:23] you three new dresses of your choice
[57:26] so what's going to happen i owe her
[57:27] three dresses right now because it's 20
[57:29] till 10 now but i'll try to hurry as
[57:31] quick as possible
[57:34] i didn't make any promises about dresses
[57:37] so i'm not worried about the getting to
[57:39] 8 30
[57:40] or even 10 for that matter
[57:43] but he says if i and i mentioned that
[57:45] just to show that this is something that
[57:47] brother brown when he got oh if we had
[57:48] time this morning
[57:50] why because there's a hidden revelation
[57:52] in the book of ruth
[57:54] that ruth came in the barley season in
[57:56] the harvest time oh if he could dwell on
[57:58] the fact
[57:59] that this gentile woman is coming in the
[58:02] time of a barley harvest he says i would
[58:04] go so long i told my wife six dresses
[58:06] how to dwell on that subject and he just
[58:09] kind of gives us some breadcrumbs some
[58:10] little highlights
[58:12] naomi naomi representing the orthodox
[58:15] church was went away on the account of a
[58:18] famine went over into the land of moab
[58:20] like the scattering of israel
[58:21] all out among the nations and then as
[58:23] she came back she brought
[58:25] back ruth the moabite and she returned
[58:28] just in barley's season just the
[58:30] gathering in
[58:31] of the first barley that is that gentile
[58:34] church coming to god just at barley
[58:38] season again the gospel had already went
[58:41] to the gentiles the gentiles were
[58:43] already being made up through seven
[58:44] church ages
[58:45] but now brother branham sees a truth
[58:47] that's portrayed in the book of ruth he
[58:49] sees the truth and why little bethlehem
[58:51] why little bethlehem because bethlehem
[58:53] judah at the beginning
[58:55] held the mystery of a gentile wife
[58:58] held the mistress of a gentile bride he
[59:00] says that gentile bride
[59:01] coming to god again at barley season at
[59:04] harvest time
[59:05] it speaks of the living bread of life
[59:08] bringing forth the bride
[59:10] so as we begin to read this and go
[59:11] forward you'll see that in each juncture
[59:13] there's a type for you as an individual
[59:15] and as it relates to the bride he says
[59:17] what a beautiful
[59:18] picture there and then she and boaz
[59:20] married
[59:21] and their famous son obad was begotten
[59:23] there and also born
[59:25] and then his great son jesse came from
[59:27] obed
[59:28] there also he begat david his son the
[59:32] king david
[59:33] came out what a story
[59:37] what incredible story look at this
[59:40] coming up now
[59:41] from rahab the harlot her son founding
[59:44] it from that came boaz which brought in
[59:46] another gentile
[59:47] and then from boaz came jesse and here
[59:49] jesse to jesse was born david
[59:51] and david right here at this same little
[59:53] bethlehem was anointed by the prophet of
[59:55] god to be the king of israel
[59:57] all these spiritual things hid from the
[1:00:00] eyes of the world
[1:00:01] what was happening here in this little
[1:00:03] city of bethlehem
[1:00:04] see that's the way god does
[1:00:08] it's not always the big flashy
[1:00:11] ornamental things
[1:00:13] says now i trust that the holy spirit
[1:00:17] will be present now to give you correct
[1:00:19] understanding
[1:00:20] that god doesn't work out on these big
[1:00:22] things
[1:00:24] is by the spirit that's what you need
[1:00:26] for yourself individually
[1:00:28] if there's young people here that are
[1:00:30] going to camp out this weekend and
[1:00:32] brother wayne lawson was expressing
[1:00:33] as fellowshipping with him today i just
[1:00:36] expressed in his
[1:00:37] his burden his desire to see god moving
[1:00:40] a very special
[1:00:42] way for young people recognizing the
[1:00:44] need that every young person must come
[1:00:46] to a new birth experience
[1:00:48] that they've got to have that baptism of
[1:00:49] the holy ghost they got to have it for
[1:00:51] themselves individually
[1:00:52] and this is where i would say this for
[1:00:55] anyone who's going to youth camp
[1:00:57] don't nest don't be looking for some
[1:00:58] great big move
[1:01:00] or something big and flashy be looking
[1:01:02] for him to reveal himself to you
[1:01:04] make sure it's personal and not just to
[1:01:07] get caught up in something big or if
[1:01:08] something big doesn't happen
[1:01:10] what's big is if he reveals himself to
[1:01:12] you
[1:01:14] i don't need a show i don't need
[1:01:15] something fantastic i don't need
[1:01:17] a chairs being lifted in the air and
[1:01:19] things dramatic happening
[1:01:21] i need god to open up my heart i need
[1:01:23] god to open up my mind
[1:01:24] i need him to speak to me right where
[1:01:25] i'm at at the time that i'm living
[1:01:29] god doesn't work out on these big things
[1:01:30] it's by the spirit not by power not by
[1:01:33] might but by my spirit saith the lord
[1:01:36] god working in the spirit among the
[1:01:37] people see
[1:01:39] these great backgrounds he could only
[1:01:41] come to this city
[1:01:43] that's the only place he could be born
[1:01:47] god following his same line god always
[1:01:49] does that god follows the line of his
[1:01:51] word
[1:01:52] he cannot go back on his word by no
[1:01:54] means and then remain god
[1:01:56] he's got to stay with the word he can
[1:01:59] never leave
[1:02:00] that today our traditions and so forth
[1:02:04] take us from the word
[1:02:06] it's okay if you get checked by that
[1:02:09] it's okay to ponder that so brother
[1:02:10] aaron we've left denominations we're in
[1:02:12] the message now we do everything by
[1:02:13] church order and this is how we do
[1:02:15] things and this is what we believe no we
[1:02:16] should examine ourselves
[1:02:19] right we should be sure that our cod
[1:02:21] isn't the result of ocd
[1:02:24] right and we should be conscious of that
[1:02:27] we should be aware that no this isn't by
[1:02:28] tradition
[1:02:29] this isn't by you know being
[1:02:31] obsessive-compulsive this isn't because
[1:02:33] we want things to be strict and because
[1:02:34] we like the anti and the message no
[1:02:36] we examine ourselves it's not by
[1:02:38] tradition we don't want tradition to
[1:02:39] take us from the word we have creeds and
[1:02:41] things we inject into the word
[1:02:42] which pollutes the whole thing but god
[1:02:45] can never leave the line of his word
[1:02:48] his word is true always because he is
[1:02:50] the word and god
[1:02:52] and his word is the same
[1:02:56] now we see here how this little
[1:02:58] bethlehem
[1:03:00] yet being unnoticed a little place
[1:03:03] not noticed too much to the outside
[1:03:05] world just the smallest of the cities
[1:03:08] nobody paid any attention to it be it
[1:03:11] god
[1:03:12] had in his purpose that that's where all
[1:03:15] these things would
[1:03:16] happen and make this personal he says
[1:03:19] now the spiritual mind would pick that
[1:03:20] up
[1:03:21] because the prophet said here you see
[1:03:23] the prophet said thou bethlehem of judea
[1:03:25] art thou not the least among the princes
[1:03:29] but out of these shall come a governor
[1:03:31] that shall rule my people israel
[1:03:33] the prophet the mind of the prophet
[1:03:35] found it
[1:03:36] watch those spiritual holy spirit today
[1:03:39] leading those things
[1:03:41] don't make any difference what the world
[1:03:43] says in all of its tinsel
[1:03:46] watch the holy spirit in the word that's
[1:03:48] where it come
[1:03:51] don't get distracted by the world in all
[1:03:52] its tinsel he says watch the holy spirit
[1:03:55] in the word
[1:03:56] that's where it comes why little
[1:03:58] bethlehem
[1:03:59] because god had chosen it he'd already
[1:04:02] laid the framework for it
[1:04:04] it had to be there if they'd caught the
[1:04:06] hidden revelation in that book of ruth
[1:04:09] it had to be there if they caught the
[1:04:10] revelation of benjamin benoni being born
[1:04:12] to rachel it had to be there because
[1:04:16] from there would come the messiah
[1:04:18] bethlehem let's stand
[1:04:46] amen let's bow our heads in a word of
[1:04:49] prayer
[1:04:52] i invite you if you have a need just to
[1:04:54] lift your hand before the lord and
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:04:57] request his favor
[1:05:05] with our heads bowed let's pray
[1:05:09] our gracious heavenly father
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:16] we thank you so much for the grace that
[1:05:18] you have for us
[1:05:22] your goodness
[1:05:28] lord as i have been reading in this book
[1:05:31] of ruth
[1:05:32] it's been my prayer that i would not
[1:05:34] only see what you are in the story but
[1:05:35] what you are to me
[1:05:38] and how to accept you
[1:05:41] not as a personal savior
[1:05:45] again as we many of us have already
[1:05:47] experienced that not in the new birth
[1:05:49] which is that
[1:05:50] seal of the holy ghost but what you can
[1:05:52] be to us in totality
[1:05:55] how you can continue to provide and give
[1:05:58] strength and courage
[1:06:01] and even to see how ruth
[1:06:05] went from resting to rewarded
[1:06:10] that we know that if we have received
[1:06:11] this baptism of the holy ghost which is
[1:06:13] our rest that there comes a reward
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:16] that we want to live like believers
[1:06:20] who know that you're a rewarder that
[1:06:22] you're a provider
[1:06:23] that you're a keeper that you're a
[1:06:25] deliverer
[1:06:27] [Music]
[1:06:28] and i would desire that the image that
[1:06:31] we see in the book
[1:06:32] of ruth is that you will make provision
[1:06:35] for that one that is cast down that one
[1:06:37] that it seems to be helpless
[1:06:39] the one that is without hope that there
[1:06:41] is provision there is a way
[1:06:44] lord in the very direct and simple
[1:06:47] thought is we just took
[1:06:48] part of one verse tonight
[1:06:51] the man name was elimelech and his wife
[1:06:53] naomi
[1:06:56] and his two sons milan and killian
[1:07:00] apritheese
[1:07:04] of bethlehem judah
[1:07:07] it told the story lord who they were
[1:07:11] it pointed to the origin of bethlehem it
[1:07:13] pointed to the destiny of bethlehem it
[1:07:15] pointed to
[1:07:16] what would take place in bethlehem
[1:07:19] and lord may our origin story change
[1:07:21] tonight
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:23] may we no longer be tethered to our
[1:07:25] birth date may we no longer be tethered
[1:07:26] to natural events
[1:07:28] the lord may we see ourselves as being
[1:07:30] in you before the foundation of the
[1:07:31] world
[1:07:32] may our origin story be divine just as
[1:07:34] it was for bethlehem may our origin
[1:07:36] story
[1:07:36] and our destiny be just as divine as it
[1:07:39] was for bethlehem
[1:07:42] i pray father you strengthen us and
[1:07:43] encourage us be with us lord
[1:07:47] help us to face the challenges that are
[1:07:48] before us
[1:07:50] lord as we may begin to feel a little
[1:07:52] uncomfortable and we're challenged with
[1:07:54] different
[1:07:55] notions and ideas and rejections and
[1:07:57] fears and complexes
[1:07:59] lord may we lean more heavily upon you
[1:08:02] and flee to you trust in you
[1:08:05] not necessarily away from the pain but
[1:08:07] to the purpose of it to the meaning of
[1:08:09] it lord
[1:08:10] we run to you bless all those that have
[1:08:13] gathered tonight
[1:08:14] take the pray that you take this word
[1:08:16] that has been shared
[1:08:17] or even through my discomfort or through
[1:08:19] my stumblings lord
[1:08:21] just seal it up in a beautiful way in
[1:08:22] the people's hearts
[1:08:24] that they would be benefited by it we
[1:08:26] ask this in the name of the lord jesus
[1:08:28] christ
[1:08:30] amen amen
