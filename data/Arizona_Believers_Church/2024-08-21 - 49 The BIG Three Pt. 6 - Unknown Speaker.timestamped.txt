[0:00] but yet brother bam said Satan took the
[0:01] good things of God and perverted them
[0:03] into
[0:04] evil the Bible says in Isaiah 14:12 how
[0:08] art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer
[0:10] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[0:12] to the ground which did US weaken the
[0:15] Nations this image of Satan being cut
[0:18] down to the ground and being brought
[0:19] down to the Earth it actually is a
[0:21] partner to this did weaken the Nations
[0:24] to weaken it means to disable or to
[0:26] bring low to the ground to bring it to
[0:28] the ground to make it feeble and just as
[0:31] Lucifer was brought to the ground he
[0:33] brought all the people on the face of
[0:34] the Earth to carnality to the flesh to
[0:37] the Earth and he weakened all people
[0:40] this is what he did Lucifer weakened
[0:42] Humanity he weakened the human the the
[0:45] the species that God had brought forth
[0:47] by his spoken word Satan was able to
[0:49] weaken that through his
[0:51] scheme the Bible says in Proverbs 12:4 a
[0:54] virtuous woman is a crown to her husband
[0:56] but she that maketh ashamed is as
[0:58] rottenness in his bones this is only so
[1:03] because of Satan scheming this is only
[1:05] so because of Satan working the woman
[1:08] had if she had never been tempted she
[1:10] never been seduced had she never been
[1:12] LED astray through the lust of the eyes
[1:13] the lust of the Flesh and the pride of
[1:15] life everything would have dwelt
[1:17] together in Perfect Harmony but through
[1:19] the woman in Satan's agenda now there
[1:21] can be a woman that makes a shame and
[1:23] she drains all the life out she's
[1:25] rotness to the bones but a virtuous
[1:28] woman is a crown to her husband brother
[1:30] Braham said a good woman is a jewel in a
[1:32] man's crown and that she should be
[1:33] honored said she's the best thing that
[1:35] God could give him but also the worst
[1:38] thing he could get a hold of if she's
[1:40] not the right one or she's not in her
[1:42] place the best thing God could give you
[1:44] and he says or about the worst thing you
[1:46] can get a hold of so the worst one is
[1:48] what you get a hold of the best one is
[1:50] the one that God gives you and I just
[1:52] want to set that forth because this the
[1:55] woman is brother BR even writes in the
[1:57] church age book how she's brought to
[1:59] this peculiar place place before God and
[2:01] man she's the image of everything
[2:03] righteous and holy but also in the image
[2:05] of everything foul and loathesome and
[2:07] and there's this one on one hand and one
[2:08] on the other and one is sent sent to
[2:10] hell he says and the other is sent to is
[2:13] placed in the very Throne of God as the
[2:15] only place right for her so that she is
[2:19] in this incredible position before God
[2:22] and man and that that one on the other
[2:24] hand that ends up in predition that's
[2:26] Satan's work the other one that ends up
[2:29] in the Thro is God's work now let's look
[2:33] at
[2:34] how this woman has been shaped to be the
[2:38] worst thing that a man could get a hold
[2:39] of and how she could make a shame or be
[2:41] rotness in in the bones in Proverbs
[2:44] 31:30 it says favor is deceitful and
[2:48] beauty is vain but a woman that fearth
[2:51] the Lord she shall be praised now when
[2:53] you read that it seems a favor is
[2:56] deceitful and beauty is vain and we
[2:57] think well that's just a verse in itself
[3:00] uh that thought stands on its own but
[3:01] this conjunction of but is somehow a
[3:04] rebuttal or U the opposite contradictory
[3:08] to uh the the the deceit of favor and
[3:11] the vanity of beauty it says but a woman
[3:12] that fearth the Lord she shall be
[3:14] praised so when it when it speaks of the
[3:17] deceit of favor and the vanity of beauty
[3:20] it's related to the woman related to the
[3:23] woman herself or even what the woman can
[3:25] represent as favor which is charm or
[3:28] acceptance is deceit ful and this deceit
[3:31] is something that's fraudulent or fake
[3:34] so there could be a certain charm that
[3:36] somebody puts on a Charisma as we young
[3:39] people say these days the Riz that
[3:40] someone might have and the pull that
[3:43] someone might have and think oh that's
[3:45] they they've really got it and and they
[3:46] they're really charismatic and they're
[3:48] they're just they've kind of got that
[3:49] personality going for them and the
[3:51] Bible's saying that kind of acceptance
[3:53] that kind of popularity that way with
[3:55] people is deceitful it's fraudulent and
[3:58] it says Beauty is vain that the beauty
[4:02] is the shape or the Symmetry and beauty
[4:05] and even favor or acceptance is a false
[4:07] representation of a person that vain
[4:10] it's vanity it's empty it's deceitful
[4:13] and this is what Satan has swn into
[4:15] Humanity all that is in the world is the
[4:17] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[4:19] and the pride of life in order for there
[4:21] to be favor that is deceitful or beauty
[4:23] that is vain it has to be somehow its
[4:25] Genesis in the lust of the flesh the
[4:27] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[4:29] and a woman that feareth the Lord she
[4:31] shall be praised which is different that
[4:33] fear of God the subjection to the word
[4:35] of God is one who is not deceived by
[4:38] favor or uses favor to deceive it's one
[4:40] who is not cut up in the vanity of
[4:42] beauty nor is one who is vain a
[4:44] beautiful and a vain way but it's
[4:46] someone that fears God but this is what
[4:49] Satan has designed different kind of
[4:51] woman for a woman's
[4:53] World in 2 Corinthians CH 4:4 this is to
[4:57] me uh maybe the most important script
[4:59] scripture tonight that I'd like to share
[5:02] uh is in terms of what we're trying to
[5:04] express in whom the God of this world
[5:07] hath blinded the minds of them which
[5:09] believe not I realize there's a lot of
[5:10] scriptures before and after that give
[5:13] much more color to this but in whom the
[5:15] God of this world hath blinded the minds
[5:16] of them which believe not lest the light
[5:19] of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is
[5:21] the image of God should shine unto
[5:25] them
[5:26] here the God of this world has blinded
[5:31] the minds of people so and we see this
[5:33] image of Samson where the eyes are poked
[5:35] out that's a consequence of something so
[5:39] the God of this world has blinded the
[5:41] minds of people so that they cannot see
[5:46] the true image of God remember when
[5:49] brother elizer ministered on character
[5:51] and how Satan in the and I was just so
[5:53] inspired by these things so I think this
[5:54] is maybe the third service in a raw I've
[5:56] referred back to it but he he was
[5:58] showing how that Satan when when he said
[6:00] I want to be like the most high he
[6:01] didn't even have the right concept of
[6:03] God so it wasn't like oh I want to be
[6:05] like God and I want to be Christlike and
[6:07] I want to be Godlike and I want to have
[6:09] his heart and I want to have his
[6:09] character he had a perverted perception
[6:12] of what God should be or what God was so
[6:14] when he said I want to be like the most
[6:15] high His image of God was perverted and
[6:19] Satan was preoccupied with the
[6:22] visual there's a part I want you to
[6:24] catch is he was preoccupied with the
[6:26] external the visible and and notice the
[6:29] how contradictory this is to God God is
[6:31] perfectly content with hiding himself in
[6:35] Simplicity God is perfectly content yay
[6:38] he is a God that hideth himself he's a
[6:39] God that hides himself in Simplicity and
[6:42] is happy to reveal himself in the same
[6:44] but Satan wants to be declared and made
[6:47] known in opulence something Grand and
[6:50] something great as he says in Ezekiel
[6:54] 28:12 son of man take up a lamentation
[6:57] upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him
[6:59] thus say the Lord God thou
[7:02] sealstone and perfect in Beauty when it
[7:05] said thou seest it up it means you draw
[7:07] your own image you draw your own
[7:10] likeness you form yourself and you form
[7:12] yourself as a you form a portrait of
[7:14] yourself and you've represented yourself
[7:16] as the Perfection of wisdom and Beauty
[7:19] this is what's in the heart of Satan
[7:21] Satan is interested in the perception
[7:23] and what you see and the and the and
[7:25] what the mind will do as we say that
[7:27] Satan chose the battleground of the mind
[7:29] he chose man's mind that means he is
[7:32] interested in the eye and what it would
[7:34] produce and what the mind can do with it
[7:36] whereas God chose the soul right where
[7:38] their hidden character of God
[7:40] is so he has he's only interested in
[7:44] image Satan is the author of The Big
[7:47] Three he is the perverter of money women
[7:50] and
[7:51] popularity the Bible says he is the God
[7:54] of this world and he wants to Blind
[7:57] Minds so that don't they don't see the
[7:59] true image of God so he wants to present
[8:02] a False Image as God in the Bible says
[8:05] he sets himself forth as God to be
[8:07] worshiped as God and we read that the
[8:10] God of this world brother benam calls it
[8:12] the God of this evil age it's Satan's
[8:15] Eden he is the the ruler in this Eden
[8:19] and brother BR said this is a woman's
[8:20] world it's a woman's church it's a
[8:23] woman's
[8:24] age he says now we find out now that
[8:26] we're coming in our age and any Bible
[8:29] teacher knows that the last age of
[8:32] Pentecost is
[8:33] leoda leoda means woman in the Greek a
[8:36] time when women take over he's
[8:39] associating that very closely when he
[8:40] says it means woman in Greek Leo leis
[8:43] was a a powerful powerful wealthy woman
[8:46] who was
[8:47] divorced and so it it it is represented
[8:50] by this woman it's a woman's age and
[8:53] notice how brother Branham makes the Le
[8:55] Dean age this divorced woman synonymous
[8:58] with the Pentecostal age
[9:00] and he says in the sermon marriage and
[9:02] divorce which were drawn a lot from this
[9:04] he said the world is beautiful so it can
[9:06] deceive I mean Cosmos the order of the
[9:08] world is what he says the order of this
[9:10] world the God of this world the world
[9:12] that we now live in the age that we now
[9:13] live in is so beautiful so it can
[9:15] deceive it's beautiful so it can deceive
[9:17] he says great fine places and
[9:19] luxury this is how Satan has built his
[9:22] Eden to look beautiful he wants to
[9:25] present it as powerful he wants to
[9:26] present it as uh Grand and gorgeous and
[9:29] beautiful
[9:30] and this is even maybe the things we
[9:31] could say that he presented to Jesus
[9:33] said look at the kingdoms look how
[9:34] beautiful they are and Jesus was able to
[9:36] look past the veneer he's able to look
[9:38] past the Optics look past all the Great
[9:41] accomplishments and all the beauty and
[9:42] all the opulence and see the character
[9:45] of it so that's the age that we're
[9:47] living in where there's always going to
[9:49] be some uh some something presented to
[9:52] the ey something visually to get us to
[9:54] be seduced by it because it seems to be
[9:56] so great and the woman is is a product
[10:00] of this dis or this world of beauty
[10:03] Satan has designed the woman to appeal
[10:06] to be driven by and to appeal to the
[10:09] lust of the eyes now we might think
[10:12] wellow the lust of the eyes is equated
[10:14] with women and so therefore men are
[10:16] capable of lusting because they see a
[10:18] beautiful woman and so a man is tempted
[10:21] to lust of the eyes but realize as a man
[10:23] is tempted by the lust of the eyes
[10:25] that's what would drive the woman is the
[10:28] lust of the eyes
[10:30] so it's not that the man himself is the
[10:32] only one that has to worry about these
[10:34] things but it's a spirit that works upon
[10:36] all
[10:37] Humanity Satan is what I'm wanting to
[10:40] emphasize tonight is showing that Satan
[10:41] is the woman's designer and he designed
[10:44] her visually to work in the way of the
[10:47] lust of the eyes in 1 Peter chapter 3:
[10:51] 3-5 speaking of a Godly woman these
[10:53] women who were in subjection to their
[10:55] husband these women of old as Peter
[10:57] refers to him who's adorning let it not
[11:00] be that outward adorning of platting the
[11:03] hair and of wearing of gold or of
[11:05] putting on of apparel now we can't say
[11:08] that these things are wrong and not to
[11:09] do to them otherwise we would never
[11:12] braid our hair never put gold and never
[11:14] wear clothes right but he's obviously
[11:18] identifying some spirit that drives this
[11:21] as uh what is necessary and what we need
[11:24] to have and what needs to presenting
[11:26] yourself in a way to be outwardly
[11:28] pleasing let this woman adorning not be
[11:32] this adorning this uh ornamentation this
[11:35] decoration this present how they present
[11:37] themselves let it not be of the platting
[11:41] of the hair the wearing of gold or the
[11:42] putting of Apparel in other words whose
[11:44] World let it not be the outward World
[11:48] whose adorning whose Arrangement let it
[11:49] not just be the outward world but let it
[11:51] be the hidden man of the heart in that
[11:54] which is not corruptible even the
[11:56] ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit
[11:58] which is in the sight height of God of
[12:00] great price for after this manner in the
[12:03] old time the holy women also who trusted
[12:05] in God adorned themselves being in
[12:07] subjection unto their own husbands
[12:10] notice how there is this comparison
[12:14] between those who trust in God and would
[12:16] Adorn themselves in a Meek and quiet
[12:18] spirit and how that God looking upon
[12:20] that is pleased by it and he sees it as
[12:23] something of Great Value and it's the
[12:24] hidden man of the heart and Peter is
[12:27] saying but let us not be preoccupied Ed
[12:29] with the external man because that is
[12:32] what Satan's Eden is occupied with again
[12:35] Satan is preoccupied and he's driven by
[12:38] the visual he wants things to look right
[12:41] he wants things to appeal a certain way
[12:44] and that's where all the time and
[12:45] attention is in the Optics the things
[12:47] that can be seen the things that can be
[12:48] touched whereas God wants to hide
[12:50] himself in the inner part and he wants
[12:52] this ornament not necessarily something
[12:54] tangible but yet something that can
[12:56] speak something that can be touched an
[12:58] ornament of a Meek and quiet spirit in
[13:01] the hidden man of the
[13:03] heart that's the that's the difference
[13:07] between God's work and the work of Satan
[13:10] Satan's only worried about Optics the
[13:11] outward the external he's preoccupied
[13:14] with the visual and God's content with
[13:16] hiding himself in the heart of
[13:18] man and so a woman should be concerned
[13:21] about the World hidden in her
[13:23] heart but brother bam says in marriage
[13:25] and divorce sin is beautiful to the eyes
[13:27] of the world but God is Not featured in
[13:30] that kind of beauty so did you know that
[13:33] God is featured in character beautiful
[13:38] character when you take this sermon you
[13:40] begin to study it out in marriage and
[13:41] divorce he's showing us that Satan
[13:43] features himself in physical
[13:46] Beauty
[13:48] and I guess there's uh maybe there's
[13:50] this inclination to say well I guess if
[13:52] it's beautiful it's of the devil I
[13:54] remember telling one brother one time
[13:56] who could sing really really good and
[13:58] preach really really good and I said man
[13:59] nobody can be that good one of those
[14:00] anointings has got to be
[14:03] false it was a very dear friend still is
[14:05] a dear friend just called me the other
[14:06] day but uh still just because
[14:08] something's beautiful we don't
[14:09] necessarily say oh well that must be
[14:11] Wicked that must be evil we have to
[14:13] recognize that there is a beauty that
[14:15] Satan is trying to achieve and it's
[14:17] deceitful and sin is beautiful to the
[14:20] eyes I've been thinking a lot about
[14:21] Moses how he turned down the pleasures
[14:23] of this world for a season he rejected
[14:25] it turned down everything that it had
[14:27] because sin is pleasing it's enticing
[14:30] it's seductive and he says the beauty of
[14:32] this world is deceitful but God is Not
[14:35] featured in a worldly Beauty he's
[14:37] featured in
[14:39] character Peter says don't let your uh
[14:42] preoccupation be with the outward
[14:43] adorning of the platting of the hair the
[14:45] wearing of gold and the putting on of
[14:46] apparel don't let that be what is going
[14:49] to testify of you as being beautiful and
[14:51] being attractive and don't pre be
[14:53] preoccupied with that but Adorn yourself
[14:55] with a meek and quiet spirit I say it
[14:58] doesn't matter how holy you dress if you
[15:00] don't have a Meek and quiet
[15:02] Spirit there there's not a skirt long
[15:04] enough to cover it up right there's not
[15:07] a blouse baggy enough there's not hair
[15:08] long enough if it's not the right inward
[15:10] man if it's not the hidden man of the
[15:12] heart it comes through
[15:14] eventually and so s Satan features
[15:16] himself in Beauty he wanted to make
[15:19] Heaven a better place Satan is up there
[15:22] and going you know what I think I could
[15:23] be a better God than this God I can make
[15:25] Heaven look better than than what God
[15:26] did with it and so Satan can only do one
[15:29] thing that's impersonate cannot produce
[15:31] an original cannot create he can only
[15:34] pervert he can only impersonate and and
[15:37] I want you to think about this and maybe
[15:38] just record this in your mind and be
[15:40] very perceptive when you're studying the
[15:41] message of the hour listening to the
[15:43] message of the hour how that Satan is
[15:45] going to have a bride and it's a false
[15:46] bride and it's going to
[15:49] impersonate and so it's it's not
[15:51] necessarily Catholicism but it's evolved
[15:54] to
[15:55] Pentecostalism that's where Satan's
[15:57] false bride is going to be now in the
[15:59] sermon marriage and divorce again we're
[16:01] just trying to show Satan being this
[16:03] designer of the woman it's that external
[16:06] lust of the eyes that he's preoccupied
[16:08] with he says have you noticed the
[16:10] increase of beauty of women the increase
[16:13] of beauty of women in this day and he
[16:16] refers to Pearl O'Brien or Pearl Brian
[16:18] and Clara ba and and he refers to them
[16:22] as being the most beautiful women in the
[16:24] world at that time I went back and
[16:25] researched some of them and brother B
[16:27] said you know they wouldn't even hold a
[16:29] candle to just some snickel Fritz today
[16:31] some teenage girl today and all you have
[16:34] to do is go back and look at them and be
[16:35] like yep he's right like you don't even
[16:37] need to find a teenager from the 60s to
[16:39] agree and he said look at how women have
[16:41] become more and more beautiful this is
[16:44] what he says the increase of the beauty
[16:46] of women is showing the time of
[16:49] deception now there's nothing can stoop
[16:52] like her and she's designed so that she
[16:54] can be
[16:56] deceiving I know this may seem hurtful
[16:59] or some may say misogynistic or
[17:01] chauvinistic or
[17:02] whatever but there is um there's this
[17:06] truth he's trying to bring out of how
[17:07] Satan has designed the woman he says now
[17:09] I'm not talking about you sisters he
[17:10] said I'll get to your place in a minute
[17:12] says you have a special calling for
[17:14] redemption in this hour he said it
[17:16] started started with a woman it'll end
[17:17] with a woman he's saying a woman started
[17:19] in the beginning she'll end in the end
[17:20] he saying he's saying in a positive way
[17:22] so there's a there's a uh there's a
[17:26] place for the woman if I could even say
[17:28] it this way and and I think I'll come to
[17:29] it at the end I'll say it now hopefully
[17:31] I'll remember in the end Samson in the
[17:33] end looks like a
[17:35] woman with his eyes um poked out and
[17:39] he's completely defeated and so there's
[17:42] a way that like Satan is perverting
[17:44] gender roles and perverting the woman a
[17:46] a and and defiling things and mixing
[17:48] things up whereas God wants the woman to
[17:51] become like him but in the right way
[17:54] doesn't want her to become more worldly
[17:56] and more uh uh feminine in a worldly
[17:58] sense doesn't want her get caught up in
[17:59] the things are going but he wants her to
[18:00] be that bone of his bone flesh of his
[18:03] flesh that perfect expression of his
[18:04] character so he says there's nothing
[18:06] that can stoop as low as a woman because
[18:07] she's design designed to be deceiving he
[18:09] says and Satan is really working on her
[18:11] today in these last days because he is
[18:14] her
[18:16] designer he says I can prove that now go
[18:19] right back at the beginning who started
[18:21] to work on her Adam or Satan God or
[18:24] Satan and it was Satan is the answer to
[18:27] that he says that's her
[18:29] designer it's her Chief weapon to throw
[18:32] man to her filth being a pretty woman
[18:34] she can sway a man any way she wants
[18:37] to this is brother Brandon making these
[18:40] observations about the power of a woman
[18:43] been reading through a thinking man's
[18:44] filter where in brother bradam is
[18:46] talking about how use he's using the
[18:48] woman at least the way I'm looking at
[18:50] he's talking about the filter he says he
[18:51] use it to sell uh tobacco and using
[18:54] Beauty and we they say sex cells is what
[18:56] they say and they use women and to do
[18:59] this some frequency in in the 20th
[19:02] century where they're just for no reason
[19:04] at all an advertisement for a male
[19:06] product a product for men has a woman on
[19:08] it and it's like oh I got to get the
[19:10] shaving cream right and it's like all
[19:12] there is is a a woman in it and so it's
[19:15] using this to make some sort of
[19:17] Association anchor something in the mind
[19:19] of man because this is how man how this
[19:22] has been sown into Mankind and cultivate
[19:24] and develop she's the chief weapon to
[19:26] throw at a man that can sway him him he
[19:29] says brother it ain't the bootleg joint
[19:31] down there that gets the man it's the
[19:32] pretty woman walking down the street
[19:34] twisting herself half
[19:36] dressed remember about the Le Dean
[19:38] Church the Pentecostal Church descending
[19:40] Into Darkness descending into chaos that
[19:43] brother Adam saw dancing to rock androll
[19:44] music she was naked and so it's a
[19:47] spiritual type and it's actually a
[19:49] physical phenomenon women stripping
[19:51] themselves down twisting themselves half
[19:53] dressed he said that's the deceiver
[19:55] right there and she's deadly with it he
[19:59] says absolutely deadly he says you may
[20:02] question me about Satan being her
[20:03] designer but that's the truth Satan
[20:06] designed her he still does
[20:09] it now just let me just say this as what
[20:14] I'm summarizing here is that Satan has
[20:16] made the woman to entice he's made her
[20:20] seductive he's made her to be an
[20:22] instrument whether it be in marketing or
[20:24] whether it be in any kind of situation
[20:26] where she is trying to
[20:29] uh draw upon a man's flesh draw upon his
[20:33] desires to deceive him and sway a man
[20:36] anyway she wants to and he says she's
[20:38] deadly with it and this is Satan's
[20:41] design when he got to the woman in the
[20:43] beginning he wanted to design her so he
[20:45] could use
[20:46] her all that is in the world the lust of
[20:49] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[20:50] pride of life the big three are designed
[20:53] to distract and to
[20:55] deceive to entice the call away to
[20:58] intoxicate ate to to cause us to become
[21:00] into bondage and so we could say that
[21:03] the woman the Modern Woman this woman h
[21:06] a Womanhood and and The Feminine gender
[21:08] has been designed to deceive designed to
[21:11] entice to lead astray and as it did to
[21:14] Samson bind him and cause him to lose
[21:16] his
[21:16] power and this is true both in the
[21:19] natural and in the
[21:21] spiritual spiritual
[21:23] fornication is the evil twin of physical
[21:28] fornication
[21:29] or it's the it's the same spirit
[21:31] manifested in different ways so wherever
[21:34] there's spiritual fornication it is akin
[21:36] to and it is like physical fornication
[21:39] this uncleanness so the the way that
[21:42] Satan would use a woman in the natural
[21:44] to cause a man to be sede to cause a man
[21:47] to lust to cause a man to be enticed
[21:49] he's doing the same thing in the
[21:51] spiritual now I really what I've just
[21:53] done is I kind of changed subjects a
[21:54] little bit but I'm wanting you to
[21:56] realize that we say oh money women and
[21:59] popularity that's what's going to get
[22:00] some people and so you start trying to
[22:01] see well what's that preacher's problem
[22:03] is it money women or popularity and do
[22:05] you realize the problem could be women
[22:07] but it's not the sister in the Pew it's
[22:08] the church that he's
[22:10] leading because the church is a
[22:15] woman the Temptation even for a woman or
[22:17] the temptation of woman is not just
[22:19] beautiful females but it's also
[22:21] churches it's organization you think I'm
[22:24] glad we're non-denominational well
[22:26] that's the spirit
[22:28] you know what it takes to be an
[22:29] organization organize around an
[22:31] interpretation of the word and put a
[22:33] period on it right you want an
[22:36] organization just find some consensus as
[22:38] to way you think things should be a a a
[22:42] and get your colle Collective together
[22:44] and rally around it and you are an
[22:48] organization you don't have to be an
[22:50] official denomination you don't have to
[22:51] have a headquarters you don't have an
[22:52] actual voted on leader but you can be
[22:55] under the spirit organization and you
[22:57] could take a g genuine move of God and
[22:59] put a period on it put your stamp on it
[23:01] put your judgment on it and say this is
[23:03] it this is it right here and be an
[23:08] organization so the spirit of a woman is
[23:10] the spirit of denomination Spirit of
[23:12] organization it's the spirit of
[23:14] Babylon this money women and popularity
[23:16] women is not necessarily A physically
[23:19] beautiful woman but it can also be an
[23:21] organization or a
[23:23] church in judges chap 16: 19- 21 as we
[23:27] look at Sam
[23:29] listen deceived by the
[23:32] world deceived by this beautiful
[23:35] Delilah and when we get to verse 19 we
[23:38] as we read through it on Sunday and
[23:39] maybe with some Dramatics on my part but
[23:42] still it kind of begs the question
[23:44] Samson what is going
[23:46] on it's almost as if every time she said
[23:49] wake up we're like yeah buddy wake up
[23:53] and he wakes up physically but never
[23:56] spiritually either that D or he just was
[23:59] so reckless to think I know what she's
[24:01] trying to do I know what she's trying to
[24:03] do brother bradam says in one place he
[24:04] got so comfortable in my own words he
[24:06] just thought he could get away with it
[24:08] kept flirting around with it he just
[24:10] thought even to the point where he
[24:11] deceived himself into thinking I can
[24:13] literally give her my
[24:15] secret and it won't affect
[24:18] me and so now she made him sleep upon
[24:22] her
[24:23] knees and she called for a man and she
[24:25] caused him to shave off the Seven Locks
[24:28] of his
[24:28] head this is what the church can do low
[24:32] you to sleep put you to sleep on her
[24:34] knees and then have men cut off your
[24:37] hair cut off your Seven Locks and she
[24:40] began to afflict him now the church we I
[24:42] say the church but the woman begins to
[24:44] afflict him and his strength went from
[24:45] him and she said the Philistines be upon
[24:47] the Samson and he woke out of his sleep
[24:49] and said I'll go out just as I had
[24:50] before but he says he didn't know that
[24:53] the Lord had departed from him but the
[24:56] Philistines took him and put out his
[24:59] eyes and brought him down to Gaza and
[25:01] bound him with feathers of brass and he
[25:03] did grind in the prison house brother
[25:06] Bram said this is a symbol of the nation
[25:09] a symbol of the church a symbol of an
[25:11] individual that's let loose of God
[25:14] you'll find that as brother Brandon
[25:16] preaches a number of sermons on Samson
[25:18] he is using Samson to rebuke the
[25:20] Pentecostal
[25:21] church and here he is with this head
[25:23] shaved what happened when his head was
[25:25] shaved it broke the vow he had to God
[25:28] and what is this what is this likened
[25:30] unto a dishonorable woman as we read it
[25:33] in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 how there
[25:35] was this when a woman cuts her hair with
[25:37] her woman the hair is given to her for
[25:39] her glory and the Shaving of Samson's
[25:42] head was a sign of dishonoring his vow
[25:45] so Samson presents this interesting
[25:48] image of one who's been so influenced by
[25:50] a woman that he begins to manifest the
[25:52] Disobedience of a woman and he shaves
[25:55] his head in contradiction to his vows of
[25:57] Nazarite and then his eyes are plucked
[25:59] out showing what the spiritual
[26:01] blindness this is his this is what he is
[26:05] culminates in this image of
[26:08] Samson and now I'm just going to spend
[26:11] maybe the next 15 minutes or so before
[26:13] we close looking at what brother bradam
[26:15] says about Samson in this condition he
[26:18] said there stood Samson but the spirit
[26:20] of the Lord didn't come on him anymore
[26:22] or he says it's no more he wasn't
[26:25] anointed he had been stripped of this
[26:27] power by a woman that lured him away
[26:30] from the Commandments of the Lord I
[26:33] wonder today if that isn't something
[26:34] like our churches women in the Bible
[26:37] represents church so brother bram's the
[26:40] one that makes this direct connection
[26:41] between Samson's failure by Delilah to
[26:44] our Temptation or the taking away from
[26:48] us our rights in God or leading us
[26:50] astray from the Commandments of the Lord
[26:51] by Churches by organizations by
[26:54] denominational Spirits by movements
[26:56] contrary to the word of God he's been
[26:58] stripped of his power and he goes I
[26:59] wonder if that's something that's
[27:00] happening to us through a woman which
[27:03] represents the
[27:04] church and he makes these statements I
[27:06] wonder if we haven't listened to the
[27:07] lure of other
[27:10] denominations says I wonder if we
[27:11] haven't went off on some great wild
[27:13] Tantrums to build a church that's a
[27:15] little better than the meth Methodist or
[27:17] Presbyterian a wild tantrum to build
[27:19] something
[27:20] better a wild tant when it's like well
[27:23] this has failed and this hasn't worked
[27:24] let's just do this and let's do that
[27:26] remember the impatience of so-called
[27:27] Liber
[27:29] says I wonder if we haven't prited and
[27:31] pulled from one to the other to try to
[27:33] make our organizations
[27:35] grow identifying a
[27:38] spirit the spirit that he says this
[27:41] woman Delilah this temptress of Samson
[27:47] represents and the servant presuming he
[27:49] says about Samson he got himself wrapped
[27:51] around her and she wrapped him around
[27:54] the finger and he found out all his
[27:56] strength was gone I how you could just
[27:59] be tied to something to get wrapped
[28:00] around the finger I believe that a
[28:02] Believer should never get wrapped around
[28:04] the finger of a
[28:06] church shouldn't our identity shouldn't
[28:08] be so wrapped up in the church and so
[28:10] wrapped up into church politics and
[28:11] church position and wrapped up into the
[28:12] p and our identity so intricately tied
[28:16] to the local assembly to we lose the
[28:18] reality of our sovereignty as
[28:20] individuals in the body of Christ and
[28:22] our identity with our head which is
[28:24] Jesus Christ which is what the the local
[28:27] church is to serve the reason why that
[28:30] you should find yourself at home tonight
[28:32] in this church is because you're part of
[28:34] the church which is the body of Christ
[28:36] in this local church is caused to serve
[28:38] that and that's why you should feel at
[28:40] home that's why you should feel a part
[28:41] of it and we shouldn't be so wrapped
[28:43] around the finger of an organization a
[28:45] denomination or even a church identity
[28:47] to where God can't lead us deeper into
[28:49] his
[28:50] truth he's wrapped around her finger and
[28:53] all his strength was gone that's exactly
[28:55] what's happened to the church today WRA
[28:58] itself around these Creeds and man-made
[29:00] things in organizations and
[29:02] denominations and getting away from the
[29:04] word of God in
[29:07] formalism formalism is not of
[29:09] God the formalism that we could say that
[29:12] brother B identify is where he said
[29:14] there's two sides there's formalism and
[29:16] there's fanaticism he says one over on
[29:17] this end one's over on that end and both
[29:19] of them are wrong and really anytime you
[29:22] see that the brother brandom is calling
[29:23] out and identifying fanaticism or
[29:25] formalism uh if he's only singling out
[29:27] formalism you got to realize at the same
[29:29] time he's calling out fanaticism cuz
[29:31] he's not advocating for the opposite the
[29:33] opposite would just still be just as
[29:35] wrong so he says that they've been
[29:37] called away from the word of God into
[29:39] formalism and to make ourselves formal
[29:42] and say well the spirit of God doesn't
[29:43] move anymore and God doesn't use this
[29:45] and you shouldn't shout or you shouldn't
[29:46] cry you shouldn't get emotional and you
[29:48] try to water the rot it down or cut
[29:49] things like you're wrong you're
[29:51] absolutely wrong well this is the way
[29:53] that it should be and the gifts are this
[29:54] way and we don't have them anymore and
[29:56] why would you even want the gifts when
[29:57] the Gift Giver himself is here and I I
[29:59] guess the response to some men that
[30:01] teach that is well did you when when
[30:03] your wife got you did she throw away the
[30:05] engagement ring she gave you you gave
[30:06] her it's like hold on I'll be right back
[30:09] I got to go tell her to throw away the
[30:10] engagement ring throw away all the gifts
[30:12] your husband ever gave you now that you
[30:13] got the husband get rid of everything he
[30:14] ever gave you God doesn't do that he
[30:16] doesn't require us to do it so there's a
[30:18] formalism that's anti- but just on the
[30:20] same depth of of Satan the same depths
[30:23] of being wrong is the idea of
[30:26] fanaticism and this is what happens to
[30:28] the
[30:29] church you'll notice this it accompanies
[30:32] both groups the formal and the Fanatics
[30:34] the church looks like the rest of the
[30:35] world acts like the rest of the world
[30:38] and first thing you know you find the
[30:39] holy spirit's gone and the strength of
[30:42] the Gospel is away from you what is the
[30:45] strength of the Gospel ask yourself
[30:49] that this is what this woman brother B
[30:51] says represented she had Samson wrapped
[30:54] around his finger and therefore she
[30:56] could control him and get him away from
[30:58] the word of God in the sermon once more
[31:01] he says let a lure of a woman take him
[31:03] from the word of God talking about
[31:04] Samson Delilah took Samson from The Word
[31:08] of
[31:08] Promise now take that to heart where we
[31:11] have in our day A Word of Promise what
[31:13] is the message for our day what is it
[31:15] that we're focusing on what is it that
[31:17] we're feeding on what is it that ought
[31:18] to have the preeminence not some glare
[31:20] of another age not some other bygone
[31:22] idea but we it's the Word of Promise he
[31:24] says the woman took Samson from The Word
[31:26] of Promise and so has the Jezebel of
[31:28] this day taken the church learn it from
[31:31] The Word of Promise God's holy
[31:33] Bible and he says the same thing and he
[31:36] speaks in Revelation 17 the 17th chapter
[31:38] he says the Catholic church is
[31:40] represented there she was the mother of
[31:42] Harlot she was a and the mother of
[31:44] harlots see it had to be churches he
[31:46] says not boys it was girls Protestant
[31:48] churches a mother of harlots this is
[31:50] where I'm wanting to emphasize that this
[31:52] woman that we see in this trifecto of
[31:54] money women in popularity this lust of
[31:57] the eyes is not just a beautiful woman
[31:58] to seduce men into lust and perversion
[32:01] of the flesh but it's also a religious
[32:05] spirit brother bam said it's it's girls
[32:08] Protestant churches as soon as they
[32:10] organized they done the same thing they
[32:12] did there they stripped themselves from
[32:14] the word and follow the dictations of
[32:17] some
[32:18] organization this is the failure of
[32:20] Pentecost the failure of Pentecost is
[32:22] when they organized you say when they
[32:24] organized what happened they looked just
[32:26] as Pentecostal they shouted just as much
[32:29] they danced just as enough they had
[32:30] church services just the same but they
[32:32] had put a
[32:33] period right and they kicked Christ out
[32:35] of their churches they organized and
[32:38] they
[32:39] separated and he says it's the spirit of
[32:41] the Catholic church I've made reference
[32:44] to this a couple times brother B says in
[32:45] the mark of the beast and the Seal of
[32:46] God part two Beauty that's the
[32:49] attraction of the eye the Catholic
[32:52] Church learned that long ago that
[32:55] through the eye is the gate to the soul
[32:57] to make Beauty and so forth and people
[32:59] fall for that so this is the spirit of
[33:02] Catholicism this is the evolution of the
[33:04] spirit all the way up to the this this
[33:05] day of impersonation as Janice and
[33:07] jambre whed Moses through
[33:09] impersonation this to try to manifest
[33:12] themselves in the power of God it's it's
[33:14] the spirit of Optics it's the spirit of
[33:16] the visual it's the spirit of the eye
[33:19] through the eye it's the lust of the eye
[33:20] to make Beauty make something beautiful
[33:23] and cause the people to fall for it he
[33:24] says Hollywood learned it a long time
[33:26] ago and the devil knew it before any of
[33:28] you did so we say well I knew it before
[33:30] that no the devil knew it before any of
[33:32] you
[33:33] did the spirit of Babylon in Revelation
[33:36] 17 the spirit that's upon the Catholic
[33:38] church and the Protestant churches these
[33:40] girls is the spirit of the attraction of
[33:44] the
[33:45] eye if you could win the eye if you can
[33:48] win the Optics this is what happens even
[33:51] when it comes to a a silent
[33:53] majority and the spiral of Silence that
[33:56] sometimes could take over people is when
[33:58] it appears as if something is broadly
[34:00] accepted it appears as if something is
[34:02] the way that it should be even even if
[34:04] it's not the majority everyone just
[34:05] acquiesces and gives into it because of
[34:08] the power of
[34:17] perception there's many more statements
[34:19] we could read along these
[34:24] lines maybe we'll read some more on it
[34:28] on
[34:30] Sunday but if I could summarize it this
[34:33] way and then just read a couple more
[34:34] statements before we
[34:36] close that God G made the woman and she
[34:40] has a special position with God a
[34:42] special calling a special designation as
[34:45] a matter of fact I could say that she
[34:47] was God's objective from the very
[34:50] beginning that he the Earth was made for
[34:53] the purpose of getting a woman out of it
[34:56] a woman of himself he he wanted to have
[34:58] a bride of his choosing it's at the
[35:00] heart purpose of God so when the woman
[35:03] came forth in the garden and Satan saw
[35:05] her come forth she immediately became
[35:07] his Target his attack because he's
[35:09] following the progression and he's even
[35:11] following the word of God to Adam and he
[35:14] knows that she has something to do with
[35:16] immortality she has something to do with
[35:18] life she has something to do with the
[35:20] image of God and so he attacked her and
[35:23] being unable to bring forth his own
[35:25] woman he used the woman and the beding
[35:28] ground of the woman to bring forth
[35:30] another race of human beings upon the
[35:32] face of the Earth as one blood is spread
[35:34] over the whole earth and it's not the
[35:36] original between Adam and the woman it
[35:38] is
[35:39] mixed it is a mixed uh uh race mixed
[35:42] people from the very beginning and so
[35:45] there has been a weakness sown into
[35:47] humanity and as men we don't Point our
[35:49] finger at the woman like Adam did is my
[35:52] wife we're all guilty we're all born
[35:55] between Eve and and Satan but we've got
[35:58] to recognize what I want you to catch in
[36:00] this aspect just as mankind has been
[36:02] defiled and manhood has been defiled and
[36:04] there's this wrong image of man that you
[36:06] can't find in denominations you can't
[36:08] find in organization you can't find it
[36:09] in trumpism you can't find it in the
[36:11] world today you can't find it in
[36:13] liberalism you can't find it anywhere
[36:14] you can only find the real image of a
[36:16] man in
[36:17] Christ you can only find it in the word
[36:20] in the full balance of the word of God
[36:22] and so it's just the same for the man
[36:24] but I'm want you to recognize through
[36:25] the lust of the eyes s has designed the
[36:28] woman with that in
[36:30] mind the power that she has the sway and
[36:33] the pull that she has and he's saying
[36:35] that a worldly woman a woman who dresses
[36:37] ungodly a woman who presents herself in
[36:39] a certain way Jesus said that when a man
[36:41] looks at her and begins to conceive
[36:44] these things in his mind he has
[36:45] committed the act in his heart already
[36:48] with her by the way that she presents
[36:50] him herself and there's a guilt in that
[36:53] lusting there's a guilt in that that
[36:54] wrestling that a man would have with
[36:56] those things and just as we could say
[36:58] that type of woman that in the natural
[37:01] would try to deceive and try to seduce
[37:03] and try to work on a man through the
[37:05] feelings of his flesh there's a spirit
[37:07] of the W away from
[37:09] Christ and to something
[37:13] else and and even if it
[37:17] might
[37:19] well
[37:21] I I'm I'm losing just some perverse
[37:24] things that the world would
[37:26] present and and you have if we have in
[37:28] pride month all these the parades and
[37:32] and that's that's not what's going to
[37:35] they're already leaning that way but
[37:37] what he wants to do is he wants to
[37:38] present
[37:40] that apart from the word that looks
[37:43] better that sounds better that
[37:45] feels and then he says notice a man
[37:48] looking at her pretty red lips and
[37:49] painted face and shorts and bikinis and
[37:51] every what she's got a real thinking man
[37:54] won't look at her now a man that's a
[37:57] church member will look at her and
[37:59] admire her now I want you to take this
[38:01] in a spiritual sense I I'm saying this
[38:04] to young men here today to older men to
[38:07] married and single divorced whatever it
[38:09] is that as red-blooded men you got to
[38:12] realize the devil is trying to find his
[38:13] way into your mind find some way to get
[38:16] you preoccupied with even the physical
[38:19] to cause you to lust and now also to the
[38:21] same degree that we would say that that
[38:23] is a work of the devil now think of this
[38:26] in the spiritual sense and brother B
[38:28] says a church member will look at her
[38:29] and admire
[38:30] her if you're a church member and you're
[38:33] wrapped around the finger of the church
[38:35] you'll admire a church that has
[38:38] spiritually got bobbed hair wearing
[38:39] makeup and shorts and and dressed up for
[38:44] show says but I don't care how she looks
[38:46] to the eye a thinking man will turn his
[38:50] head and what does he say multiple times
[38:53] in this sermon turn your
[38:55] head and he says and even begins to
[38:58] speak in a real personal way and we
[38:59] would say that as men of God in this
[39:01] hour as sons of God and as young men and
[39:04] and just men in general we have got to
[39:06] have a discipline to turn our head to
[39:09] avert your gaze to to not entertain it
[39:11] to not look at it and and notice even
[39:14] how the subtle ways that it begins to
[39:16] develop itself he says you've got to
[39:18] turn your head he says I don't care how
[39:19] pretty it looks a man who's got God's
[39:22] word as his filter that thinking man
[39:24] will turn his
[39:25] head and we've got to be the same way in
[39:28] the spiritual sense that when Satan is
[39:30] trying to present to us a woman that is
[39:33] full of lust and full of adultery and
[39:35] full of spiritual fornication but it's
[39:37] trying to entice us to the lust of the I
[39:39] you've got to turn your
[39:43] head he says why he's been through God's
[39:46] filter and he knows to look upon her as
[39:48] adultery in his heart he don't think
[39:51] she's
[39:52] pretty say isn't she a pretty thing not
[39:55] to him it isn't it is
[39:58] she's a filthy looking miserable Jezebel
[40:00] wretch to a thinking man think of a
[40:03] church now he says a Son of God looks
[40:06] upon her with shame that he even belongs
[40:08] to the family she belongs
[40:10] to that's right how could that be my
[40:12] sister and act like
[40:15] that you thinking spiritually even she's
[40:19] pulled through one filter and he come
[40:20] through another he won't think she's
[40:23] pretty not at all that's not Beauty to a
[40:26] real man of God
[40:28] but how deceitful is
[40:30] it we're not talking about a strip teas
[40:33] in the
[40:34] natural where if we were just like we
[40:36] were going to just do a test and we're
[40:38] going to ask the men well who do you
[40:39] think's beautiful and you show them some
[40:41] sort of strip teas and he's going to be
[40:42] like can't fool me right we could all be
[40:46] Supreme Court Justices then and say I
[40:48] know it when I see it and that's not
[40:50] that's not right that's ungodly but do
[40:53] you realize Satan today is not
[40:56] presenting his Bride As a strip
[40:59] teas he's got all the red herrings and
[41:01] all the the he's got all the maybe not
[41:03] red herrings he's got all the other ones
[41:04] on the fringes and they have their job
[41:07] but in the last days it'll be so close
[41:09] it'll deceive the elect but it's not
[41:11] possible but brotherr says it so much so
[41:14] that it'll be so close that if it were
[41:16] it would happen so you've got to realize
[41:19] but for God's grace and the
[41:21] impossibility that you cannot be seduced
[41:24] in this end time through the devil's
[41:25] bride it would happen because it's so
[41:30] close I believe that the bride is right
[41:32] going to have the full word and with the
[41:35] full word in her midst she's going to
[41:37] live righteous she's going to live holy
[41:38] she's going to live clean she's going to
[41:40] live above the world she's going to have
[41:41] Christ in her midst so there'll be
[41:43] Divine Healing in her midst there'll be
[41:45] salvation in her midst where there's
[41:46] salvation and Divine Healing where
[41:48] there's oil there's joy where there's
[41:50] the presence of God there can be weeping
[41:52] I believe that people speak in tongues
[41:53] as it's happened in this church I
[41:55] believe people can shout people will
[41:56] dance I believe that all those things
[41:58] will follow because we're living people
[42:00] who respond to the stimulus of the Holy
[42:02] Spirit and so the bride will be living
[42:05] clean and living a certain way but I'm
[42:08] not going to be seduced by a woman that
[42:10] tries to dress up like the bride in lie
[42:13] to me about the
[42:15] message and seduce Us by being
[42:19] preoccupied with the
[42:23] visual the sermon marriage and divorce
[42:25] brother bam says a man looks natural
[42:27] beauty it's
[42:30] deceiving and that's why a woman was
[42:32] given that beauty to deceive he says for
[42:36] deception a beautiful woman if she don't
[42:38] use it in the right way it's a curse to
[42:40] her that will send her to Hell quicker
[42:43] than anything else I know
[42:46] of if she can be pretty sure as long as
[42:49] she stays with her husband and does
[42:50] what's right and that's fine and
[42:53] dandy but she can take the same thing
[42:57] and how she can deceive with it for it
[42:59] was given to her to do
[43:02] so this is what women are doing today to
[43:06] men
[43:07] sisters I think it's I think it would be
[43:09] good to look upon mothers to look upon
[43:12] your sons with pity that they're living
[43:15] in the day and age that they're living
[43:17] in I think I I think as wives you should
[43:20] look at your husbands with a Pity and
[43:22] prayer in the day and age that they're
[43:24] living in not with judgment
[43:28] not with
[43:30] indignation not with the the spin that
[43:33] the devil would want to get realize
[43:34] Satan is after them with a
[43:38] Vengeance and he takes these things in
[43:40] the natural to deceive to weaken and to
[43:43] defile a man's
[43:44] conscience and in the same way it
[43:46] happens in the natural he's trying to do
[43:47] it in the spiritual and the Very things
[43:50] that make a church
[43:51] beautiful and the Very things that could
[43:53] make a church a place that would would
[43:55] be welcoming to the the Holy Spirit a
[43:58] church can take that and use it to
[44:02] deceive the very thing that's given her
[44:04] he says notice but God is featured in
[44:08] character and what does the scripture
[44:10] say there was no Beauty in him that we
[44:11] would desire him that Christ physically
[44:15] was not
[44:17] imposing Christ when he spoke they
[44:19] didn't say never man spake like this man
[44:21] because his bar tone voice and because
[44:24] it was just like man that that's just so
[44:26] smooth and
[44:28] who knows how it sounded but it was the
[44:31] words that's that's what he spoke and so
[44:35] he was he may have not have been any
[44:37] beauty physically the Bible says we
[44:39] turned our eyes from
[44:41] him he might have been the type of
[44:43] person you'd see like oh my goodness you
[44:47] I would I would listen to him but he's
[44:49] kind of hard to look at he's kind of
[44:50] hard to listen to so it's as this he
[44:52] been stripped from the
[44:55] visual Satan is over there presenting
[44:57] himself as a Judas beautiful
[45:00] smart a a
[45:03] charismatic and you say well that that's
[45:05] got to be the right one and here's Jesus
[45:08] this ugliness but yet he was featured in
[45:10] character there was never a character
[45:12] like him on earth right brother B says
[45:14] now we find out today that the church
[45:16] character Satan and his group look after
[45:18] big beautiful churches beautiful
[45:21] things that's what the world looks at
[45:23] today oh it's the pastor the great so
[45:26] and so so times and so and so so
[45:28] Priestly and godly walk out with his big
[45:30] robes and things like that well thank
[45:33] God we don't have robes right he's
[45:35] talking about the
[45:37] visual talking about theatrics the
[45:40] theater The Mask the
[45:43] presentation it's the stage
[45:46] lights but then when we all go home we
[45:49] turn the stage lights off the smoke
[45:52] machine's not
[45:53] going right we leave and then on Monday
[45:57] morning when it's time to get real and
[45:59] the rubber hits the road it's time for
[46:01] business you're hungry for another stage
[46:06] show he said they call that beauty but
[46:10] the real saints of God look for the
[46:12] character of the Vindicated word that's
[46:15] what the Saints did in that day when
[46:17] they saw Jesus he was nothing to look at
[46:20] but they saw God was in him they saw God
[46:23] was with
[46:25] him and that's what we look for today is
[46:28] the beauty of the Vindicated word the
[46:31] character of the Vindicated
[46:34] word there there's a front that can be
[46:36] put
[46:37] on we could you how that they can build
[46:40] a set I think anybody who's been
[46:41] familiar with Sight and
[46:43] Sound and uh and the way that they can
[46:46] build a set and make things look so real
[46:48] and they do it with Hollywood what is
[46:50] what call they can build a city from
[46:52] scratch and make it look and they built
[46:54] it it's wooden Nails it's all sorts of
[46:56] things that been fabricated and it
[46:58] conveys to you a world of Wonder and
[47:01] beauty and it's so engaging but if you
[47:04] could see it without the filters if you
[47:06] could see it without the post
[47:08] production if you could see it for what
[47:10] it really was like well I mean that's
[47:12] Rinky
[47:13] Dink and all the smok and mirrors and
[47:16] the dog and pony show and all the things
[47:18] that the devil's trying to put on trust
[47:20] me being human beings there's a draw on
[47:22] the lust of the Flesh and the lust of
[47:24] the eyes and the pride of life but we've
[47:25] got to exercise spirit ual discernment
[47:27] and use the hidden man of the heart that
[47:29] character down inside of us to recognize
[47:31] I see character in the beauty of the
[47:34] Vindicated word and I cannot let a
[47:37] Delilah seduce me loow me to sleep in
[47:40] her lap and cause some man to chop off
[47:43] my Seven Locks and cause me to dishonor
[47:45] the headship of the
[47:47] word and I want you to recognize just
[47:50] how that just with M as it was with
[47:52] money as it is with women it means a lot
[47:55] more than just the obv
[47:58] let's bow our heads and pray tonight
[48:00] musicians if you'd come and then let's
[48:03] just stand together
