TRANSCRIPT
========================================
exodus chapter 12 beginning with verse 7 and we'll read to verse 14. and they shall take the blood of the blood and strike it on the two side post and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it and what they're eating is the lamb that's referred to beginning in verse 3 and it says and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it so god is being very specific about how it must be prepared and how that it must be partaking in eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence thereof and you shall not let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the lord's passover for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and i will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt and this day shall be unto you for memorial and you shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever if we could bow our heads in prayer our gracious heavenly father as we have read of these striking verses in the exodus of how you gave these specific details to moses about the passover meal lord it's even remarkable now as i ponder it that we have just read what you said hundreds of years ago and were able to bow our heads and speak to the god that spoke to moses and to know that you likewise could speak to us and quicken things to us and instruct us give us the same faith and encouragement that they received through these words in exodus 12 we could receive what is relevant for our day lord it's just an overwhelming thought to know that we're bowing our heads and our hearts and speaking face to face to you having read your word and we ask that you'd come now take it rightly divide it to our hearts as we have open hearts to receive from you may you come and penetrate past anything that would hinder any idea or thought that would stand in the way and may you just take control of the service for your glory be with the several lord that are out sick and inflicted in body and scheduling conflicts lord or whatever it might be we pray that you touch them and strengthen them for those who would be able to listen to this uh where they are and not able to be here may they receive a special blessing tonight our prayers are with them we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you make me may be seated i've taken for a thought eating to live and my i'll say it in the outset so that you could kind of hold this in your thought as we go forward i really in taking these these subjects on being hungry and feeding and are you being fed and those different things i'm really wanting to highlight and emphasize our appetite for the word and hopefully encourage a greater participation in the message we have available to us sermons that we can read and that we can listen to and there's a message that we can be digesting in our personal lives and i would hope that we not just become faithful church members or faithful to participate in worship and faithful to attend church services but it would uh the kind of the outflow from our participation in church services and the benefit that we are deriving from our fellowship around the word is that we have a greater appetite for the things of god and we find ourselves wanting to listen to the message more and feed on it and take advantage of the opportunity we have to hear that voice and to know what has been brought to us in this hour so we don't want to just become good church members and become very diligent to observe church order we want kind of the product of our gatherings together to be to feed that hunger that we have and create a greater appetite for the message of the hour and i i want to go quickly to exodus chapter 12 just to make a few statements in the outset because i've just purposed in my heart to relax before the lord and before you all tonight in order to just follow the leadership of the lord and say the things that would be his desire to speak to you and so it's very possible that we may not have time to get to this scripture in the end so i want to make a few statements here at the outset that in exodus chapter 12 it begins with it saying the lord spake unto moses and as begins to speak unto them he says that you should take a lamb and it's going to be according to the eating shall you make account for your lamb so the lamb was to be taken to be eaten and this lamb represents something it has great representation great symbolism great foreshadowing of christ and then as god begins to speak to moses about these instructions to take a lamb of a particular age and without blemish and you're going to eat this lamb they were not given the option of how would you like it cooked i i like my lamb rare please with some with some mint or it was you had to just take it just exactly the way that he had to um that god said to do it and then also it wasn't just a matter of well you have to cook it this way you had to eat all of it and then it wasn't just a matter of cooking a particular way and eating all of it you had to be dressed a particular way when you did it and if you want to just take it further all these great details the blood of that lamb that you're eating had to be on display on the outside and the bread that you would eat could not have any leaven and not only could the bread not have leaven but the house could not have leaven and so there's a lot of details and very rich details to this but it all revolves around this meal that was taken that night in a time of death coming upon the land and then in verse 21 it says and moses called for the elders and he began to speak unto them saying draw out a lamb according to your families and then begins to describe and share with the children of israel everything that god had shared with him so we have this in in mind that this is an exodus in a time of death in a time of trouble god gives the prophet a message and the message relates to taking of elements of bread and lamb and eating it in a certain energy that was a feeling and emotion that they would be having they eat in haste and eat with urgency and then it's moses takes this message and he shares it with the children of israel and and this is where we get my thought of eating to live they had to eat this they had to partake in this in order to live that night now i'm just going to pick right up where we left off last wednesday in isaiah chapter 55 verse 2 right in the middle of the verse it says hearken diligently unto me and ee that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness and so this listen to him follow his precepts hear his voice listen to his word and if you could follow his direction then what you eat will satisfy you won't be spending your energy and labor and money and on things that do not satisfy and things that are not bred but hearken diligently unto me eat that which is good let your soul delight itself in fatness so we're talking about uh this has been the subject of satisfying our souls and satisfying the hunger of our soul and the need for the word during a time of famine because we are living in a time where there is a spiritual famine we live in a time where there's a spiritual shortage of the word of god you uh let's just be honest we don't find it everywhere when we go about our days unless we make an effort to hear the word of god you're probably not going to be hearing the word of god unless you make an effort to discern the finger the the hand of god and the thoughts of god and the creation of god you're not going to see it because how many times do we enjoy the the creation that we live in and whether it be the beautiful weather or even like the meteor shower that was taking place early this morning and the different things and you enjoy it it's beautiful it's great you see the mountains and you see certain things in god's creation yet our instinct isn't to think isn't god grand isn't god wonderful if you're not diligent to pick up on these things you're not in tune with the things of god you're not hearing the word of god and so there is a famine for the word of god and we're bringing that from amos chapter 8 verse 11 where the lord said i will send a famine in the land but it won't be a famine for bread or a famine of water where there's no water to drink or bread to eat but it will be a famine of hearing the words of the lord and so brother branham as we'll read here in a moment he he takes this and places it in the time that we're living in now but in both isaiah chapter 55 and then amos chapter 8 it's taking our natural action of eating our natural action of hunger and then satisfying that hunger and then using it to kind of prick our thoughts about our appetite of god for god and his word and so he's taking here in amos chapter 8 is taking man's need for the word as he says it's going to be a famine for hearing of the word and put it in terms of natural natural things and nutrition or natural nutrition maybe is the best way of saying it taking things of bread in water that would be used to give health and strength to the body he said there's going to be a famine for hearing of the word so we can draw from this lessons regarding a spiritual appetite we can draw from this as the word is saying hey it's going to be a famine but maybe not a famine for bread and water but likewise as a famine of bread and water would impact your physical health there's a famine of hearing the word which speaks to us about the realm of a spiritual appetite and spiritual health and brother braham says in spiritual food and due season and that day is now he takes amos chapter 8 verse 11 says that day is now hearing the true word of god so live it in a time where there is a famine for hearing the true word of god he says now this types the natural drought with the spiritual sin and unbelief by false teachers and modernists in the church have brought the place to this coming oncoming judgment so he places us firmly within amos chapter 8 verse 11 that there is a famine for hearing of the word of the lord and he says that the natural drought is a type of the spiritual drought that's in in laodicea and he uses this phrase sin and unbelief by false teachers and modernists in the church and and i want you to hold that kind of thought that description it kind of reminds me of lewd fellows of the baser sort brother iran's going to say false teachers and modernists we want to remember that that phrasing false teachers and modernists have brought it to this place of oncoming judgment this is what they've done they have turned from god's word and his prophet to to modern theological terms of the word and in spiritual food and due season brother brahms pointing to malachi 4 chapter 5 or malachi chapter 4 verse 5. he's pointing to elijah as this type of how there's a famine in laodicea but there's something to come that's going to feed him so he's saying they turned from god's word and his prophet to a modern theological terms of the word this is what the false teachers and modernists have done is they've turned from the word to modern theological terms of the word and then he says this and this kind of becomes the turning of all this you notice here it's just at that time that god always raises up something just when there's a famine just when there's a drought just when false teachers and modernists begin to take advantage of things and twist things and turn from the word god raises up something raises up something for what for the bride's spiritual health there's got to be something made available to to feed the bride and i believe that we have to have the kind of attitude that as long as you have breath god has provided food you're the bride and as long as we're here there's got to be something here to feed you and sustain you and so these modernist and these modern theological terms that they come up with create a shortage of the pure word of god these modernists and these theological terms create a lacking for the pure word so it's man's intervention it's it's not that god has not provided it but yet man's intervention and man's tweaking with it man's interpreting it and man's philosophies and his traditions actually create a shortage and withhold the pure word of god from the people and in mark chapter 7 verse 13 he's jesus in his rebuke of these jewish elders and these teachers he says you're making the word of god of none effect and i know he's speaking very into a very particular thing he says make him the word of god of none effect through your tradition which he have delivered and many such like things do ye so they have made the word of god without effect they have made the word of god without uh with life without force without benefit without proper application and they've done it through their tradition which they have delivered so when they when they took their traditions and joined it with the word the word lost something in its application when they built their when they built tradition around it when they added their old history to it they made the word of god of no effect through the traditions that they delivered it says and many such like things do yes so it wasn't just in this one particular instance but over and over and over again the word that god had delivered had been rendered useless through their traditions and this is where the thought can just expand into an image that is very very large and i just kind of want to point to it say see this this is this is something here that you could ponder and think about in greater detail but once they hybrid once through hybriding the word and hybriding god's commandments it lost its force so through hybriding the word it lost its force it lost its authority it lost its effect its impact and so we could say this about the the things that the jews were observing is these were genetically modified organisms and we all what do we all look for and over pay for non-gmo right that's what we want to buy we want it organic we want to be sure that the rain was organic we won't be sure the soil was organic we want to be sure that there was nothing unorganic within 50 miles because really if you wanted non-gmo you need to make sure that everything within a particular radius probably isn't either right be sure the rain didn't pass over you know the wrong kind of bodies of water but this is this is something maybe we could all understand this is what the jews had done to the word of god they had modified it through their man's ideas and man's inventions and man's intervention and so they had their own science they'd become their own scientists and they'd come up with these concoctions and they had genetically modified the word of god and they'd used their traditions and added this and added that and added their interpretations and once you hybrid it it took the life and the value and the nutrients and what was beneficial in that word they had made it of none effect so see there i'm not preaching against non-gmo i'm trying to make the point and build off of something we can all agree on that these genetically modified foods many times they lack something that that's the reason why we have this food this is the benefit you get from it but once it's genetically modified it loses its force or vitality what is it that we know about a lot of these genetically modified foods they can't reproduce themselves so it lacks a force it lacks a vitality it lacks a seed and so this we could just use this in our minds to to understand what the how they had made the word of god and none effect and as i was studying the message of the hour and just finding how brother madam uses this term modernist we find that in the way that brother adam refers to modernist modernists deny part of the word there's some part of the word that modernists will deny but the ram says that moderners believe that the days of miracles are passed now they will believe some part of the word but deny that part of the word because the days and miracles are not passed there's no there's no way in the world that the the days of miracles are passed because the god of miracles is here with us because the word that performs the miracles is here with us the promise is still the same he gave a promise to the church he gave gifts to the church and he manifested himself through signs and wonders and miracles and every single one of us should have a faith to believe in miracles the greatest of miracle whatever miracle you think would be the most most outstanding in your life right now you ought to believe for it because the days of miracles are not passed and there may be a way that we could take types and shadows and certain examples in the scripture and say well you know we've entered into a garden of gethsemane where the spirit of the lord has left the bride and she's just there wrestling things out but there still is a great miracle in that garden there is still a tremendous victory in things right so it doesn't matter to me what types and shadows you want to use the days of miracles are not past but modernist will deny that part of the word really if you think about the the modern uh way of thinking the moral relativism and and post-modernist truth is how that there really is no real truth there really is no overriding absolute and something that is true to all of us we just have facts that we can all agree on and facts that are universal but truth is something that's subjective and tell you that's one of the biggest lies you can be told truth is not subjective truth is truth and truth is the ultimate and truth is what we long for and truth is what we want but modernists will deny truth they will deny a part of the word they can believe that the days and miracles are past but then preach and believe that something else in the word of god is true another way that brother branham refers to modernist is that modernists change part of the word and so they'll deny part of the word but then they'll also change a part of the word and when they change part of the word they deprive the eater of the vital force that's necessary in the word you take the word and change it then you're not going to get the essential life the essential power the essential nutrients that are in the word that the word wants to provide to you you modify it you change it then you lose the benefit of it and so if you wanted to take that and study it yourself brother i'm using this term modernist he points out how the modernists teach uh in the church age book he talks how they teach a particular doctrine and this doctrine is actually contrary to scripture and they've changed it and changing it it keeps people from coming to a birth keeps them from coming to life and so this the modernist whether i was using them as central figures and these modern theological terms essential figures in the drought essential figures in the fact that there's a famine for hearing of the word of god and we've been pointing out this statement brother ram says and to see right now in this evil day that we live in when unbelievers and scientists and so forth are trying to cut away the very value of the word yet god lives in his word so there's an effort by scientists unbelievers and so forth to cut away the very value of the word i like how he says it because it may not be a complete and total repudiation of the word it may be yes but he ever ran into the the thing of it is ministry where you say well brother branham said this it's like well the thing of it is and they want to take away the very value of what brother branham said they want to take away the very value of what the proposition of that word is so it's not a complete repudiation to say well the thing of it is brother branham was not a prophet or the thing of it is the bible's full of heirs but it's they cut away the value of it just take away enough to where the real emphasis the real point the real benefit that we're supposed to derive from it is not in it and so he says yet god lives in his word so be very mindful of this as believers that there's a force there's attitudes there's there's movements and i'm just using phrases that kind of i'm not thinking of any particular movements right now but just there's going to be agendas and ideas and theologies and teachings and methods of satan and and habits of the world that are going to try to water down the value of the word and it doesn't have to be real bold and come unto you say the word is a lie and the word isn't true but just things to distract us from it water down the the power of it and and make it to where it's of no effect so he says they cut away the very value of the word he says yet god lives in his word so in the word there is divine life there's divine life in the word and with divine life in the word there's divine power there's divine strength there's divine attributes there's divine health and so if divine life is in the word and you're taking the word you're receiving divinity there's divine strength that's contained in in the word of god so when they cut away the value of it in some way it takes the divinity out of it it takes the supernatural aspect you may still have a form of it oh it sounds good and it sounds like it it sounds like the message or it sounds like the truth it sounds exciting and there's uh there's been meetings i know where sometimes you leave like man that was awesome that was exciting and and what did he mean by that but it sure was exciting and i remember one time my brother shared with me how after a meeting the person was asked the sister actually made the comment well i don't know if there's five gods now or six but that was deep wrong kind of deep wrong kind of deep end and so there is a there's a way that it can have a sound or can have a semblance but you want the substance in it because that's what's going to give us life and give us power oh my you all are just uh you came hungry tonight i love this this is awesome all right now i'm going to just i want to touch on some scriptures very quickly and i realized as i pondered this this evening that we're just going to catch some foundational principles and scriptures that are worthy of a much greater attention but i want to kind of put all the pieces of the puzzle as it were on the table maybe not all of them but just some of the important ones maybe we can find some corner pieces and build our boundaries for uh a more expounding later in second timothy chapter four verses two to four are you having a good week has it been a good week so far is it getting better tonight it just gets better the world calls it hump day and and we in this we're just kind of getting our a little bit of a shot some energy to make it to make it through the rest of the week so i trust you're doing well if not let us know we'd pray for you do anything we could to help you second timothy chapter four verses two to four now as paul is he instructs timothy there's things that we can personally gain from this and yet the things i want to point are things that are very relevant in the context things we can gain individually though not being in the role of a timothy necessarily but things are very pertinent in that time as paul was dealing with them but very very relevant to the time we're living in now where brother bam says there's unbelievers and scientists cutting away the very value of the word there's false teachers in modernist that have turned from god's word and turned to modern modern theological terms and so this is a these are very this is very relevant scripture he says to timothy preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine this is instructive to him as a man of god as a preacher for the time will come eventually it'll happen for the time will come when they the people will not endure sound doctrine think of how extraordinary this warning is to timothy to say there's going to be a time when the people won't want it they will not want sound doctrine and then he turns this this condition and he just opens it up for us how can someone get to the place where they don't want sound doctrine i think you could ask anybody do you want sound doctrine they say yes i want sound doctrine but how does this condition overtake somebody says but after their own lust so now there's a hunger there's a desire there's something that is insatiable after their own lust shall they heap to themselves teachers modernist false teachers they'll heap to themselves it's kind of an odd uh image you know being heaped upon keeping teachers on themselves but this is something they want they want teachers they want to have this multitude they want to have these things being told to them and they have this condition of itching ears we might know it as allergies or the mesquites are in bloom and the allergies everyone's itching and scratching and it depends on just which one gets you but we're in that high tide of allergy season but this is something totally different they have itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables now again we're just wanting to we're wanting just to ponder this statement for a few moments here and let me summarize it this way paul is describing the wrong appetite very language that he's using is saying that they can't stomach good teaching they don't have a they don't have a stomach that can handle healthy teaching and because they can't stomach it they don't want it like nah i don't want that no i that i don't that doesn't strike my fancy so he's saying that they will not endure sound doctrine which is healthy providing good health good teaching but they'll actually crave things to scratch a particular itch so think of it this way you have sound doctrine but they say nah that doesn't that upsets my stomach i don't want sound doctrine but yet it's not that they're not hungry they actually crave something else as a substitute than the word that would give them health they want something else that merely satisfies an itch so you have sound doctrine and itchy ears or ears that want to be itched one will give you strength one makes you healthy and alive and one that gives you power one gives you discernment one causes you to overcome the other one kind of just scratches an itch it's very very different but yet you could say the one who has their back scratched or the ear scratched derives a satisfaction from it to some degree like oh wasn't that good didn't that feel good to get that scratched it's really really pointing out something very very heavy here and so it says that they will not endure sound doctrine this is teaching this is doctor this is pure word because sound doctrine is not mixed with air sound doctrine is not mixed with humanism sound doctrine does not contain harmful ingredients that would defile health and weaken health come up spiritually now and so he says there'll come a time when they won't endure it they won't even want it and so think about the dynamics that are taking place here they do not want sound doctrine they'd rather have something that itches their ears so they become numb to doctrine that isn't sound and not only do they become numb to it they begin and that might seem to be a contradiction in terms they not only become numb or are unaware of the impact or the fact that it's not sound but then they begin to get a taste for it because now they don't they can't endure sound doctrine it has to be unsound otherwise they won't want it when it's pure it's too heavy let me get all you coffee drinkers on my side tonight how many of you take coffee just the way that god made it excreted through monkeys in thailand right how many take it just exactly you want it black right it's exactly how you want it you want you don't want cream you don't want sugar and yet some people will just they'll add cream and sugar and they get to where let me taste your coffee there ain't no coffee in here doesn't taste like coffee this isn't coffee what is this this is this is milk and sugar and it's just been darkened a little bit with some other some kind of watery brew and we said this this isn't coffee but what happens is you begin to add this and add that and it takes you away to where now it's not even coffee anymore and i imagine it's probably true starbucks probably sells more non-coffee items than coffee anymore why because it's not the coffee that people want they just want the activity and the action of it come on somebody don't get me started tonight get me going on starbucks but it's no longer the if just using that example the coffee i'm getting excited here you're not drinking coffee anymore you're drinking other things and you want the taste of the cream and sugar you want the taste of the additives that's really what you want you didn't want you don't really want the coffee anymore you just want the hot cup with everything else that's in it and paul is describing this process where a person becomes numb to the fact that there's no more coffee anymore it doesn't have the preeminence it's not the word they become numb to the fact that this is not sound teaching and then they get a taste for things that aren't sound and then here's the danger then they begin to crave it this becomes a craving to them and he describes it as itching ears it's a desire to hear something that tickles a particular fancy the desire to hear something that satisfies a particular craving or taste in other words you can actually take the preaching of the word and want it to come a particular way that merely satisfies the carnal appetite we could even do it with preaching well as long as it preaches this doctrine and puts it in this context as long as we're hearing about this and hearing about that that's when that really gets me going that that enthuses me as long as we hear this particular doctrine lifted up and we can have our little pet doctrines that as long as that's being taught it satisfies us but that can just merely be a human carnal taste it may relate to church things it may relate to spiritual things and things in the message but yet it's our own carnal taste where as long as you're satisfying me with that interpretation i'm fine so it's a itching ears there's a desire to hear something that is merely satisfying some natural carnal craving in the same way that multitudes came to jesus not because they wanted the word but they wanted the miracles and it wasn't the miracle being in manifestation of the word of god but as they ate and were full so as we've entered into that or if we've mentioned that before and use john chapter 6 to great detail in these few other sermons on this subject i want you to think about that again and so by not feeding on the truth they turned from truth because he says they get itching ears and they turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables so by not feeding on the truth they're turned from the truth and they build an insatiable appetite for myth truths for fiction to say fables it's fictions things that aren't true and they actually have to get a taste for it now let me just add this as a as a a caveat to daily life we need to be very careful about the things that are being disseminated through certain media whether it be online whether it be in print whether it be through social media through news sites sites that aggregate the news whatever it might be we need to be very careful about the things we're feeding on because there's a lot of things that are spun a lot of things that we take and read and they take certain things and they spin it they put in a particular context that they're framing things with a particular narrative where it makes it sound like oh my goodness is a big huge issue this thing is overwhelming and this thing is a huge hot topic we got to watch this we got to watch that and there's a lot of let me just use it fake news my people tell me it's out there it's horrible fake news everywhere fake media we got to be very careful about these things that we feed on and build to because if you turn from truth you'll get an appetite for the false and so this is exactly what he's saying they get these itching ears now notice this progress or this process second thessalonians chapter 2 verses 10 to 12. i think that principle the wrong appetite we catch that now this is the process that works within this in these individuals and he's talking about the antichrist spirit that comes and works these signs and wonders and where are the signs and wonders effective upon these people and with all deceivalness of unrighteousness in them that perish why because they received not the love of the truth which is such a heavy statement now paul later says but beloved i'm persuaded better things for you so you are not those who would be categorized as ones who did not receive a love of the truth but notice the characteristic of these who did not receive it they received not a love of the truth that they might be saved so loving the truth is your salvation loving the truth is your is your deliverance loving the truth is where your miracle begins loving the truth is where your deliverance begins loving the truth is where healing begins you've got to love the truth because that's where salvation is you got to love the truth and for this cause the fact that they had not received the love of the truth god shall send them strong delusion well that seems unfair right but yet god amplifies their deception by sending them strong delusion that they should believe a lie he's already told timothy wrote to timothy that they'll turn away from the truth and be turned to fables because they have this lust for things that scratch their ears and itch their ears and now they believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth and had pleasure in unrighteousness so now they enjoy they have pleasure in the unrighteousness this is something that satisfies them and tickles them and suits their fancy and that they enjoy and he's saying it's all as a result of receiving not the love of the truth and paul in second thessalonians chapter 2 refers it to the mystery of iniquity and so this is the effect of iniquity which is a violation or transgression of god's word deviation from the word so if the word is not kept pure this is what happens you do not learn to love the truth it says they receive not the love of the truth if if if we gather together with the frequency that we have been doing twice a week and what we heard were my opinions and my stories and even some stock tips and maybe uh the best way to solve a rubik's cube then you would not be learning to love the truth you could be learning to love behavioral economics you could be learning to love sociology you could be learning to love um the latest and greatest about conspiracy theories there's a lot of things we could be learning to love but if you're not hearing the word you're not learning to love it and so he's saying that they the result of a violation of the word of god the effect of iniquity is you do not learn to love the truth listen you have got to be hearing the word to learn to love it the more you hear it the more you'll love it i promise you you're built for it you're made for it it's in your dna listen to the word the more you hear it the more you'll love it the way that the unsound doctrine got within someone's ear and became the earworm and the reason why the unsound doctrine gets really deep into people's psyche and their spiritual appetite is because they listen to it and they listen to it enough to where they want to have it right i believe it's called the the illusion of truth a fallacy the illusion of truth bias to where the more often a lie is repeated the more likely you are to believe that it's true they've done this test a million different ways i've counted no they've done this test many different ways to determine how this illusion of truth works and you could just repeat something that's false to somebody on a saturday and ask them to rate the veracity of it and then the next week repeat it again and then through the process of time because they've heard it enough they'll change their opinion about whether or not it was true but they'll think well it must be true i keep hearing it over and over and forget that at one time they knew it was air it knew it was a lie but it's repeated enough to where it becomes something that you are willing to believe and accept and it's called the illusion of truth this is something that if you listen to the wrong things enough you'll begin to like wrong things you just get an appetite for it you've got to start somewhere it's got to there's got to be some hook that gets in there and trust there's a lot of things in the world that if they could just get their hook in you just get you started all it takes is one episode right all it takes is the first the first one in a series and kind of gets its hook and then you want you have this appetite where is this going where is this leading how is this going to work out come on somebody don't get don't get me on starbucks again it says that you have not received a love of the truth they've not learned to love the truth you can't just accept truth sympathize with truth acknowledge that it's right you must love it it's not just hearing it and saying i believe it's true but it's hearing it enough to love it fall in love with it in matthew chapter 24 verses 11 and 12 and many false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the mystery of iniquity is referred to in second thessalonians chapter 2 it's iniquity that's at work in second timothy but now jesus saying because iniquity abounds the love of many shall wax cold because the word is watered down the word is changed because the word is abandoned as the word is abandoned as people become comfortable with things that aren't the word and things that aren't holding to the standard of the word and as the word is not lifted up as the word doesn't have preeminence we will just grow accustomed to it this is how we have you ever sat back and wondered how in the world do people continue in things and follow people into such terrible air that there's there's a doctrine that's uh it's kind of limited maybe to a particular segment are people that are worshiping a man they claim to believe the message and they're rewriting worship songs to lift up the new name of god and worship a man this is a man they've known for decades this is a man that they knew was just a natural man but how do they get to a place where hundreds of people are lifting up and worshiping a man and believing a man is god and god has a new name and this is the god that's been introduced by the message of era how do they get to that they grow numb to air and they stop exercising discernment and they can be led into anything and because the iniquity abounds the deviation from truth just one misstep and a lack of accountability a lack of standing up for truth the lack of saying hold on wait a minute that's not what brother branham taught i'll get you one step away and as you remain in that process you can get further and further to where now you are completely outside of the realm of truth the love of many shall wax cold now it doesn't say their passion or fervency or fanaticism wax cold but their love of what the truth wax is cold some of the most some of people who are the most wrong are the most zealous don't ever mistake uh emotion and enthusiasm and zeal and even an energy and even a sensation as vindication that what is being preached and what is being lifted up is right some of the most dynamic emotional uh sensational services can be in services where everybody's gathered around a particular idea and that idea keeps getting lifted up and lifted up and people can be whipped into a frenzy whipped into an absolute frenzy over false doctrine and and you can say well man that was so moving and that was so powerful and people were crying people were slayed and people were dancing and it seems very very powerful and very very strong but you've got to have discernment to ask yourself what was being lifted up so it's not just fervency and passion that wax is cold formalism or formality isn't necessarily the only way that it can be exhibited it can be in fanaticism and exuberance and a physical emotional workup but the love of the word has wax cold so here's the cycle that these scriptures are identifying even if you want to go back to isaiah 55 and amos 8 mark 7 and each one of these verses we can see that there's a cycle that it begins to place before us and we could we can draw this from it and i'll say this is me taking advantage of the fact that i'm the one that's preaching the sermon so i'm putting it in this context there's other ways that this is clearly can be expressed but i'm using it in this type of analogy the cycle of the wrong diet so feeding on the wrong things leads to the wrong kind of cravings you're eating the wrong thing so then you begin to desire the wrong things and then it causes a weakening appetite for the word by feeding listen if you feed on carnality you feed on movies and worldly music and hobbies and fashions and you feed on things of the world that's not going to increase your appetite for the word it's just not going to do it and so the more you feed on worldly things the more you're going to get a taste for worldly things so it should be a very obvious principle but now look at it in this sense of feeding on the wrong things even a diet that lacks the pure word and things that lift up the word the wrong diet leads to desiring the wrong things and that's going to cause a weakening appetite for the word you just don't want it as much as you used to it could explain those maybe some have prayed and asked the lord lord i want to i want to get into this more i want to do this more and the reason why you don't is you haven't started you've got to start you want an appetite for the word just listen to it just start get it going don't ask god to give it to you you got to start i if if you don't have a craving for ritos it's because you never had it can i get a witness no not everybody likes it i'm learning but you have to have had it to crave it at least i'm learning the more i've mentioned it the more people crave it they've never had it before so that's the beautiful part of preaching the word man what is he talking about i want some of that that's what i want to happen with the word get into it listen to it hear it begins to work something in you and so with this cycle in mind in revelations chapter 2 verse 4. this is in the ephesian church age nevertheless i have somewhat against thee despite all their great things that they had there was something that began to work and the lukewarm the spirit of the antichrist began to work within the framework of the christian church making it lukewarm and powerless and he says this is what he had against him that thou hast left thy first love how did brother baby describe it they had turned away from following the pure word that was their first love because iniquity shall bound the love of many shall wax cold they receive not a love of truth they did not learn to love the truth why because they're not hearing the truth and hearing it learning to love it they had left off from hearing the pure word they turned to man's devices and man's principles and man's organisms and all these other ways of of producing church systems and that way they lost their appetite and taste for the pure word of god bill ram describes it this way says the fervent desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begin to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of god it has cooled off and become a bit formal don't ever let this be said of your experience don't ever let it be said about your church the fervent desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry to reach out the spirit that all begins to fade it begins to wane it begins to get weak where did it begin by leaving the love of the word the first love is the word you begin to leave that desire leaves passion leaves a cry leaves it all begins to fade and the fire of god leaves and you cool off because the word is the source of your heat the word is the source of your fire the word is the source of your fervency the word is the source of your strength that's what it must be and because they left their first love watch how this cycle completes itself in revelations 3 16 so then because thou art lukewarm now this is what it ends up in the laodicean church age for then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth and the cycle is complete because christ is kicked out of a church he's a fugitive in his own church the laodicean church age if you want to know brother i called it the most ridiculous of all the church ages it is completely blacked out there is no light in the laodicean church age and the very final this is the final characterization of the laodicean church age is christ is outside of the church he will not come back into the church he's outside of the church and he stands outside of the church calling the believer out of it that's the exact that's the truth that's the reality of the time that we're living in that's the reality of what these scriptures speak to the cycle has then run itself complete christ is put out of the church but notice it's still church it doesn't say christ is put out and it turns into a literal temple of satan it's still a church but it's become a tepid formality think about just a lukewarm no fervent desire to please god it doesn't say there's not a fervent desire but it's not a fervent desire to please god there's not a passion to know his work doesn't say there's not a passion that's not a passion noah's word there may be a cry for reaching out but it's not in the spirit all of that begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of god it's cooled off from that it's become a bit formal and so what it's become is it's still church but it's formal it's lukewarm it's mixed in way too much because it's not cold where it's rejected it outright but it's become a mixture a lukewarm church brother brown makes this statement and greatest battle ever fought because when brother branham is describing these scriptures in a few places he talks about laodicean being smothered over and christ being smothered over and kicked out of the church and the greatest battle ever thought brother says god is training for this battle matthew 24 said there and also daniel 12 said there would be a time of trouble such as never like on the earth before we read how that christ said because false prophets shall arise and deceive many and iniquity shall abound and the love of many shall wax cold but brother adam teaches us and the scripture points out that in matthew 24 despite all these great deceiving things the elect cannot be deceived he says the trauma time of trouble will come he says and we're living in that time we're living in the time of matthew 24 24 we're living in the time of matthew 24 11 and 12 we're living in the time of revelations 3 16 we're living in the time when christ has put outside the church we're living in that time when culture and education and things have smothered over the word of god and got into reasonings and so forth again as he said scientists and unbelievers and so forth have tried to cut away at the very value of the word now he uses it in this context culture education things have smothered over the word of god it's smothered over it's tried to cover it up it's trying to defile it get between you and the effectiveness of it and get into reasonings and so forth so it doesn't have to be a complete rejection of the word it's just enough of the changing of it to where it's covered over with something else to give you a taste for that it just the thought comes to my mind i don't know if it's because i smell something cooking but there's a way that you could take something and maybe it's the example i used earlier about coffee how you can begin with something and then just begin to subtly introduce something else in slowly and slowly to where eventually maybe it becomes equal parts but then you start fading out the other part and eventually you can lead somebody to where you've transitioned them from what they thought was what was carrot cake and now they're eating zucchini bread and what you did is you just started out with carrot cake and then you just introduce a zucchini and slowly but surely through the process of time you're going man this is the best carrot cake i've ever had in my life ain't no carrots in it it's all zucchini what happened because your appetite you're so focused on something you can be lulled and drawn away from it and that's why he's talking about the word getting smothered over and into reasonings and so forth and really what you've got is something that's smothered over it's a waffle house doctrine smothered covered scattered and scuttled or whatever and it's not the word and it's purity or the word you get into reasonings and so forth that's the time that we're living in we're living in that time now culture education things have smothered over the word of god so we have to be on our toes we have to be careful that we're not eating something that's been smothered over i don't know if it's true i heard one time and maybe i heard it enough where i began to believe that it was true that the reason why the french got so good at sauces is because the meat tasted so bad is that true i don't know that's just what i heard they do have some pretty good sauces but you don't want to have that what's the underlying meat what's being taught which being preached is so bad you got to smother it over with everything else well we got a nice gym we provide donuts you know everyone gets a free parking spot up front once a month you know you get to park in the pastor's park and i mean some kind of gimmick well dude it's because what's being preached isn't the drawing card you've got to come up with light shows and fog machines and great dynamics this and dynamic bad and you know what we offer uh we offer child care for all your kids so you can just they get a number when they go in and you can go into church and you can sit there and if your number pops up on the screen that means you got a problem with your kid in the back and people offer these things and that becomes the drawing card for going to church why because the meat's not good enough it's got to be smothered over and covered up with a lot of fancy sauces listen i want to go to a steak church i just want the meat red meat cook it rare plus and i just give it to me the way it is i don't need ketchup i don't need steak sauce if it's real good prime word i can eat it but if you're going to overcook it if it's not going to be primed go ahead put ketchup put sauces put tarragon everything else i might as well just chop it up put it in gravy right you get my point when the word is all when it's not there and it's not enough it's got to be smothered over so you got to be very discerned you got to have the kind of palate say wait a minute is this even meat listen i don't care what the world does we don't want to go beyond me we want the word i do not care if they can manufacture and genetically produce something that sounds like the word and looks like the word and smells like the word just give me the word that's what i want is it amazing that a lot of the oh boy here i go just scatter shooting isn't it amazing how a lot of the vegan or vegetarian products are trying to simulate meat i mean just keep a carrot a carrot man hey eggplant's great the way it is you don't have to trick me and make me think it's filet mignon all right mushrooms a mushroom i eat it because it's mushroom but it's amazing how it's trying to go this place we take organic plant-based foods and trick you into thinking that it is meat what's the point it's not any healthier i'm not opening the floor for discussion but i mean if somebody at least believes this way of viewing it the the the beyond meat burgers they're they are not any more nutritious and less fat less calories than the real deal where's my drummers and we have to be on our toes and very discerning that what we're getting is not something that's a substitute where god wants to give us the fresh kill of the hour and we're being served plant-based opinions that's been baked to sound like and smell like the word but it's not revelations chapter 3 verse 20. i'm glad i mentioned exodus 12 in the beginning because i'm going to be nowhere close to it so listen to the the the salt the solve to this problem this is the solution we've got a problem what do we do how do we fix it behold i stand at the door here are people that are lukewarm they've left their first love they received not a love of the truth there's a famine for hearing the word of god it's completely into chaos christ is put outside the church behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me god's answer to this condition as a spiritual feast however you want to describe laodicea however you want to describe the condition of the people they left their first love they have pleasure and unrighteousness the love of many is wax cold they um the fervent desire is gone the passion of the word is gone they become lukewarm all these things of laodicea wretched and poor blind miserable naked and don't know it all this condition that exists of the blindness and the nakedness and the poor appetite this poor spiritual condition that god's answer is a spiritual feast behold i stand at the door and knock and the answer isn't isn't that a beautiful knock the answer isn't just merely hearing the voice and acknowledging the voice the answer is through the voice you're brought into union and fellowship i will come into him you've got to hear the word hear the voice and the voice unlock the secret of opening the door and then once you open the door he can come into you and will suck with you and you will sup with him you know what sup means it means supper i will come and feast with him i will come and dine with him it's a use this word sup is especially used of a meal that's held at evening and it's not just a light snack it's something that has courses and multiple courses to it says i will come in and i'm not just going to throw him a power bar i'm not just going to give him a plant-based snack i'm going to come in and i'm going to sup with him it's going to be a seven-course meal for this bride to feel and that's the answer to every spiritual malady and the spiritual condition of laodicea is that you are eating on the right things i can say right now with absolute assurance and with thus saith the lord whatever your problem is right now the solution is taking the word for it doesn't matter if it's marital doesn't matter if it's financial does it matter if it's physical emotional or whatever it is you can feed on the vitamins of the word of god how is it brother tom ray says it take a gospel the gospel the gospel pill that's what we need to take and pour into our faith these vitamins it'll solve everything i will come in to mess up with them we'll feast we'll dine if any man hear my voice it's the voice of revelations 18 4 that says come out of her my people the voice of revelations chapter 10 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel verse 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of angel which stand upon the scene upon the earth behold i stand at the door knock if any man hear my voice well you can hear the voice i heard the voice of the lord and he said go tell go and take the book out of the hand of this mighty angel so i went unto the angel and i said unto him give me the little book we're walking through the steps of revelations chapter 3 into revelations chapter 4. hear this voice comes behold i stent the door knock here's an opportunity for the bride to be raptured up quickly out of a lail to see in condition what happens when she gets caught up she has an opportunity as we see in revelations chapter 3 verse 20 to feast and this is exactly what happens in revelations 10 8-9 you hear a voice the voice says go take the book the voice tells you to go take the books what do you do you go to the mighty angel say give me the little book and watch the further revelation unfold and the mighty angel says take it and eat it up you didn't get that in just the voice or the knocking you got that when you had the face-to-face meeting with the mighty angel if then that an opportunity is given to you to feed upon the unfailing body word of the son of man it's then that he says now you can take the book and eat it because i will sup with you and you with me the message of the hour creates preaches and ministers an entrance into this evening time feast the voice of god making this introduction message creates a hunger a hunger for the book a demand for the book and then when you go to take the book the instruction is take it and here's the further revelation and eat it up isn't it beautiful it's not even in revelations chapter 10 verse 7 or 8 to take it and need it but it's in the meeting with the mighty angel that what the point was all along to go to him and take the book the point all along was so that you could eat it not talk about it eat it as we read in spiritual food and due season he turned from god's word and his prophet to a modern theological terms of the word you notice here it's just at that time that god always raises up something this is what he raised up a supper a feast let me say the this as i close the food at this table is about life it's not a banquet for carnal pleasure it's about life or death when i say eating to live and i'm just going to skip and bring it to a close when i say eating to live i like to expound upon it more we'll do it next wednesday lord willing he's talking about the at mindset and the attitude of the eater and ultimately what they want to get what they're trying to get out of what they're doing and i'm wanting us to consider what it is we're feeding on what's our daily approach to feeding our souls we have been taught to pray give us this day our daily bread and as we'll expound upon more next time feeding on the wrong things instigates a destructive cycle where it not only creates bad health it creates bad habits and it creates bad hunger well it's a slippery slope all it starts is with the one leads to another leads to another and it just completely overwhelms just want to find a stopping point here let's stand i found i found the stopping point you can come i trust there's been something said that's provoked some thought eating to live this would be part one of eating to live we read last wednesday in proverbs chapter 13 verse 25 the righteous eateth the satisfying of his soul but the belly of the wicked shall want the living bible i believe is what translates it to the righteous eat to live but the wicked lived to eat it was socrates is actually attributed with saying the same thing something very very similar bad men live that they may eat and drink whereas good men eat and drink that they may live socrates isn't my favorite philosopher mediocrities is yeah okay but bad men live that they may eat and drink but a good man eats and drinks that he may live i mentioned it before and we've desired that this would become part of the fabric of the foundation of this church that it's not all about coming to church it's what is coming to church about what is this even for why does god even provide this dynamic if he really thought through it and pondered it what else i mean we work from home a lot of us do now so we're not commuting to work i mean we're at home we work all day but then the one thing we've done over the past years is we've driven miles and hours and expended resources and we've done a lot to what to be in fellowship to be in church what are we doing it for why why do we get together twice a week why are we wanting to do it more often why are we trying to find a building why do you pay your tithes and give offerings why do you support mission work what is it all is it just because we look to the word and we've developed these uh these uh things these habits of paying tithes and giving offerings and supporting missions and going to church and fulfilling certain duties and having church order and we have all this function and all this pomp and all this circumstance and we don't take a step back and say well wait a minute what do we do what are we even doing this for what's it all about what are we trying to accomplish we're wanting to get out of here and i don't believe that god wants us to go by way of the grave and have a have flowery words set over our a casket that contains the shell of our person but i believe god's wanting to raise up a bride into the skies to triumph over death and so in order to do that we got to be eating to live it's got to be it has to be a desperation and in exodus chapter 12 when they came together god did not just say hey get a lamb eat a lamb eat bread and while you're eating i'm going to kill a bunch of people in egypt that's not what he said he said i'm going to visit egypt and i'm going to kill the firstborn of every house that does not take a lamb without blemish drain its blood put that blood upon the door posting the lentil clears all the leaven out of the house makes unleavened bread roast the lamb with fire eats cooks it with all the pertinence and everything doesn't use herbs doesn't boil it in water eats all of it and it is dressed as in you're getting ready to leave while you eat it those are the ones who will not die and what could be said to the son who looked at all this strange stuff what could be said about why dad why that lamb dad why are you bleeding it out that way dad why are you taking those weeds and put on the doorpost and lentil mom why are you roasting we don't like it roasted we've never roasted it why aren't you using herbs why don't you use that special rub you always use why don't we do this why are we doing it that way why are we putting our shoes on it's the middle night why are you making bread without leaven why do you have your staff in your hand why are you all eating why are you all eaten with haste the father could look at his son and say son i'm eating to live that's why we're doing this tonight we're eating to live unlike any other time before we might have eaten because we were hungry we ate because the lamb was ready we ate because this is the way we like it but tonight everything we're doing we're doing that you might live son i'm living because of what i'm eating i'll triumph over death what were they doing they were eating in desperation why are you doing it that way why are you doing it that way why are you doing it that way this is desperation it's set in i've asked myself what am i doing this for [Music] if all we want is the form and all we want is just the semblance having church is very very very easy i've said this i'm saying it to family tonight you could say amen really really loud in light of recent circumstances but anybody can start a church [Music] right and maybe i i say that a little bit tongue-in-cheek but i realized and started church the fact that one could get started won't be any vindication to me because anyone can start a church but it takes god to lead it it takes god to feed it and that's what church is about eating to live and i believe that god has made available to us a word that'll feed your souls and that's what we want to do we want to eat what there's so much more to share right brother john in there at least at least a dozen other slides in there that would just keep him keep it keep it tight don't let that get out lord willing we'll share it next wednesday are you hungry are you hungry for righteousness you're hungry for truth hungry for the word say lord feed my soul feed my soul let's pray our gracious heavenly father thank you lord for the wonderful presence that we have experienced tonight the liberty that we we may even take advantage of as a friend and as a brother in the comfortableness of our spirits the enthusiasm of the people to pull upon the word lord it just can let your guard down and express things now i'm so grateful father that we have this blessed dynamic where these things can be lifted up and preached lord i'm sharing these things for our personal individual benefit these are not observations lord these are teachings in your word this is not us taking a survey of the spiritual condition of laodicea this is us taking inventory of our personal lives you've called us lord to a table which is spread with meat to feed our souls we let so much keep us from this table what i had in my heart to look at the natural example of how those who are unhealthy actually don't even derive the pleasure that they're expecting in food therefore it makes them crave more but not what would make them healthy but what makes them more unhealthy and people can find themselves in a spiritual fix spiritually unhealthy spiritually sick wanting to be free but they're so bound into bad habits that even all their supplementing never satisfies but i pray that you could set your people free [Music] from bad habits bad health bad hunger lord may we be eating to live interacting participating in this word because we're eating to live lord not a song not a form not a semblance those things are just a tepid formality lord but may it be a desire to know you a passion a fervent desire to please you bless your people tonight in the lateness of the hour may you be with us and strengthen us heal those who are hurting and sick father may they be made well may we take your word as our supplement as our main course as the nutrients and the vitamins that we need for not only our spiritual health lord but our physical health it may be made manifest in your believers i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen can you say amen to the word of god tonight amen
