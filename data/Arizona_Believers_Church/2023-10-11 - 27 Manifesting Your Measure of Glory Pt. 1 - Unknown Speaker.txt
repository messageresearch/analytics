TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title tonight is manifesting your measure of Glory I wrestled with just exactly how to title this because there's different channels I could take different directions I'm wanting to go u a lot that sets before me that I'm hoping I'm able to get to and as long as the Lord can kind of Quicken it it can be edifying to us I certainly desire that in ministering that whatever is ministered it would bring to you some knowledge and understanding of the word of God I feel that whether it be teaching or if it be uh preaching and inspired if it comes from the word of God it's applicable it's appropriate it may fit one person one way fit another person another but as long as it's coming from the word of God if it teaches us a principle in the scripture if it strikes something in our lives to wash us or to cleanse us it's beneficial and so we want to Avail ourselves to the word and I desire above all that in knowledge and understanding and teaching or preaching however it be that it could become practical that we can find where we can make make sense of it in our everyday lives and I thought just this title kind of quickened me later in the afternoon manifesting your your measure of Glory I was going to say my measure of Glory but if anybody just took that as meaning me um I wouldn't want that to take place so I'm speaking to you tonight about manifesting your measure of Glory now I'm just going to jump right into where we were on Sunday in Revelations CH 21:22 we were looking at how that John noticed certain things that were no more and we use the example of there being no more sea to show that there was some type that the sea represented and its absence would speak of Eternal peace and tranquility and Harmony and we began to take note of other things that were no more and one of those things is he said I saw no Temple therein this is in that new city in the New Jerusalem for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it now what we could say drawing on what we were speaking about in no more Shadows is that the city had no need of the temple because the temple had served its purpose that the temple was kind of a signpost the temple was structured in such a way or it was a pattern of something and being patterned after something once what it was patterned after came then you say well that's that's the real deal if there was a beta or a prototype I got to speak a language that some of us understand I we say well that's great that's wonderful this is a great sandbox but once you roll out the real thing you want the real thing you don't want to go back to the things that are buggy and the things that aren't complete and the thing that was just kind of a prototype showing you what was to come uh you want what it was foreshadowing of what it was representing and so the temple is no longer because the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it showing that the temple was only forecasting or foreshadowing this Arrangement now in Colossians chapter 2:17 and we're picking up a lot that Paul has already said about these things he says which are shadow of things to come the feast the sacrifices the priesthood the temple I'm bringing a lot into that view he said they are a shadow of things to come it's the silhouette the light shining upon an object cast a shadow it's two-dimensional it's not the object itself but it's some sketch of it it's some outline of it you could kind of gather something from the fact uh that there is an outline being presented say well that's not the thing but this tells us a little bit about the thing and then he says which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of Christ and when he says the body it's not so much the body of Christ but he's saying that the shadow of the temple and the sacrifices and and the priesthood it the the embodiment of it is Christ so this was the light was shining on Christ I think this is just a beautiful picture the light is shining on Christ and through the Old Testament it produces the shadow of the Tabernacle the temple the sacrifices the priesthood uh um all all the orders of the what we would see the types of justification sanctification the holy of holies now in crisis it was only there in the Old Testament CU light from the kind of Glory was shining on Christ and it was broadcasting this on the earth not full dimensional not full realization but in Christ the body is Christ so the old Temple was a historical reality that God had ordained to foreshadow Christ it's pointing to Christ we see this in the scripture pointing to Christ pointing to Christ so that that was part of that thought of no more shadows and so the original Temple was a shadow of things to come it was a shadow on the earth and that Shadow was created by the scripture says the body and catch this part this part really is a lot because I'm wanting to use that theme of the body this the the the temple was the shadow but it was the shadow was created by the body and when he says here which are Shadow things that come but the body is of Christ the body is that which cast a shadow as distinguished from the shadow itself that shouldn't be hard I think for all of us to grasp the body cast a shadow so when he says but the bodies of Christ he's just using normal human languages for us to understand oh I know what it's like to see my shadow I know what it's like to see the shadow of a body but now the body the thing very thing that was caused in the shadow is Christ so the body is that which it not that which cast The Shadow or is the shadow but that which cast The Shadow amen so we can see the shadow of something but I want what's cast in The Shadow and if this got a little bit confusing on Sunday I've said that we want to know what's cast in The Shadow right because we want to know whether or not the what the light is shining on is what we want what we are what is the real or it's exposing the false that's causing all the Spooks so there's a lot there that we could use in different ways and we touched on this and I think this is our we're kind of backing up to take this exit a little bit in First Kings chapter 8: 10 and 11 speaking now of the actual Temple and and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the Holy place that the cloud filled the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord when it speaks of the house of the Lord we do not find that any there is no Tabernacle in heaven that is called the house of the Lord but God was always working his way towards flesh and this house that would be built for him this body that would be prepared for him would not be in heaven but would be on earth and so whether it be the Tabernacle in the wilderness or now the very Temple that Solomon built it's called the house of the Lord so it's speaking of some sort of habitation you want to come find God you want to pray to God this is a place you could direct your attention you know that God dwelt there and it says a cloud filled the house and the priests were not able to minister because the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord I'm wanting you to see this aspect this was foreshadowing the glory of God that would be in Christ it was kind of forecast it was the shadow of what God would do in his Temple that body which was prepared and God that Christ was that ordained body for God to Tabernacle himself in and I I I I'll go ahead and use this scripture in Matthew chapter 16 on into chapter 17 you can also find this in Mark chapter 9 this really uh scratches my theological itch to use the the the Transfiguration so there's a part of me that would just uh want to cabbage down on this for a while because brother bam called this the rehearsal of the Rapture of the coming of the Lord and as it says in Mark chapter 9 that these would see the kingdom of God come in power so I want you to and I'm scratching my theological itch now I want you to really focus on what is manifested when the kingdom comes in power there's a lot of things we think are power right what's powerful how the word of God's going to manifest itself in the last days and what it's going to look like and how it's going to feel and what it's going to sound like but here we see a rehearsal of what the kingdom real power of the kingdom is when it's manifested woo I like that Matthew chapter 16: 27 it says for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then shall he then he shall reward every man according to his Works verily I say unto you now this is the statement that causes a lot of stumbling there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom so as we're preaching on the kingdom this is some representation or rehearsal of an aspect of the son of man coming in his kingdom and that that should bring up a lot of things in our minds we think about what this message reveals and the son of man comes after Son of God dispensation before son of David dispensation there's a dispensation of the son of man and that's no small thing that covers a lot and now he as he speaks this brother bam says there some there they are stumbled they're tripped up oh these guys are never going to die until the kingdom is ushered in but he's speaking of how that they would see a rehearsal of this son of man's Kingdom and in as you keep reading in this next chapter and uh Mark chapter 9 doesn't break this up but Matthew does it says and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and there's a lot lot of types there after these six days and going up to this High part of this mountain and he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment as was white as the light now this is some reflection of Glory this is some manifestation of Glory it's it's literally happening before them at the time but we know according to the message of the hour and even what Jesus says here it's some representation of what's going to be and as we see these elements and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah or Elias talking with them and this represents the sleeping Saints and the resurrected Saints so these uh individuals that are there literally in that moment in time are standing their signpost and as Shadows of what will be in the end time and this has some representation of the the son of man come in his kingdom and the glory of God he says and then answered Peter and this is so peterlik this is so on brand for Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias and this is this is just his sincere response and the this is recorded and um I'm sure maybe if Peter was writing this we would have never known it uh but these other writers are sure to mention it and Peter's like oh this would be great let's build a church to this let's build a church to that let's build a church to this and let's build a tabernacle and and in here we would have one for Moses a dwelling place for Moses a dwelling place for Elijah uh we would have these a place for you these uh places of worship or dwelling some signification some representation and Peter is being sincere in this and we don't know if what happens next is God's response to that if it would have been said anyways but it certainly does rebut what Peter said and while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son and whom I am well pleased hear ye him this is Christ saying we don't need an Elijah Tabernacle we don't need a an altar to a prophet we don't need a a gravestone to a Propet we need to rub every year and and wish ourselves luck uh this is not uh someone the other day was asking me if I had my burial plot in the same graveyard and I just told them I'd already bought it up you're you're a little late uh and I hadn't and they knew I would was joking I think but it's not that there's no place like that that we need to kind of gather ourselves in and a and be associated with because now he's saying there's only one place that he puts his name and he's saying it's not Moses it's not Elijah it's Christ this is my son in this phrase in whom I'm well pleased has to have more than just God projecting his pleasure towards him but we recognize that it speaks of him being in him I'm pleased in him and he says so hear ye him listen to him that's who you'll listen to and just recognize and we're looking at him at his Transfiguration we'll come back to him at his baptism that in this God Christ being the dwelling place of God that a Bright Cloud overshadows them and this voice speaks and says I'm in this Tabernacle I'm in this Temple you want to build Tabernacles here here here it is you want to build a temple to to Elijah to Moses one to Jesus I don't need another church Christ is the one Dwelling Place Christ is the Gathering Place Christ is where I put my name this is the provided place of worship and him I'm well pleased hear ye him and notice how similar that is to what happens whether it be in the Tabernacle which the cloud overshadowed them and the they couldn't Minister because the glory of the Lord filled I think we read that in numbers or in Exodus and now here in Kings with the building of the temple the the cloud fills the house of the Lord the glory of the Lord fills the house of the Lord and once again a cloud overshadows and the voice says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased now in Colossians chapter 1 we're going to pick up on that phrase this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him Colossians 1: 19 for it pleased the father that that in him should all the fullness dwell and and I'm drawing from before and after this and I'll kind of move around and if that's if you feel that that's um that I should take it all together I I could appreciate that but instead of just reading the scripture I want to start with this verse we'll back up to another part of it and we'll kind of work our way around this but we could take this statement as solid fact it pleased the father that in him in Christ all fullness dwell amen fullness is a key phrase to this as we'll want to maybe focus on this next week on Wednesday night more about the fullness and at his baptism we know in Matthew chapter 3 verse 17 when Christ comes to the Jordan and John sees witness of a dove descending upon him and a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased that this signified Heaven and Earth kissing Heaven and Earth embracing the word becoming flesh and when when this transpires this is a significant event and this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell Jesus comes later in John 14:10 and says it's the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works so here's a witness of Christ saying he dwells in me I'm his Temple I'm his Tabernacle now it's easy for us just to kind of gloss over that looking at it from our Christian values or Christian Perspective when he says the father dwells in me we're like yeah you got that right the Holy Ghost dwells in me and we understand understand that part but think of a a Jew who's thinking God dwells behind that Veil that holy of holies and that's where God manifests his presence and now here's a man standing there and saying the father dwells in me and they're saying wait a minute he dwells in a temple he dwells behind skin he dwells in a place that only the high priest can enter into and Jesus is like you got that right and here it is amen and and it's an expression now how that the father he dwells in me he does the works says when John says that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father so this was the glory of God tabernacled this was the glory of God in flesh yeah for it pleased the father that in him all fullness dwell now he picks it up the next chapter Colossians chapter 2:9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily there's that phrase again fullness fullness full and this fullness and I want to bring this down to maybe a level that everyone can understand this fullness is not when after you've eaten dinner and speaking to the young people when you say Philip you say I'm full right you say I'm full I can't eat anymore can I have dessert and and it indicates no you're not full you're just fed up right you're tired of eating the the greens and the beef or whatever it might be that's being served and you want something sweet you want something tasty that's not full that's just just finished or done and there's still room I want something else so when it speaks of fullness it's not that kind of full this is like all of it as much as you can quantify the scriptures are wanting us to tell us that everything God is everything God was everything God would ever be somehow someway right is in there and I know that's hard for us to conceptualize because we're we're creatures of time and space and language and so we're just kind of confined uh by these different El so just the fact that God is eternal is right way over our heads you can't you can't get your head around that so if you can't get your head around eternity I understand if you can't get your head around all things being Eternal somehow sandwiched in within this body but the scripture is trying to convey something to us about all of it is in him whatever that might be the fullness of it and he's saying for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily Jesus Christ was the perfect and complete expression of divine divine nature I know we've covered a lot of this already in this Kingdom series the entire fullness of deity dwell in him the fullness of God's character was in Jesus Christ he says it's the father that dwelleth in me he does the works brother BR said he was the fullness of God God dwelt in Christ without measure it's quite a statement if if you can take something that has no beginning and no end and and and somehow measure him all that could be measured was in Christ so he says God dwelt in him without measure words that it was nothing was cut off it was complete it was full he said when God was in Christ he had the spirit fully now I recognize and I'll come to it my whole sermon was gear is uh at some point tonight maybe hijacked to go a par to a particular angle to kind of help us with this thought we say Christ had it fully he had it completely we had it without measure and I know some of you are already thinking about how God is brother brand is quantifying that or in a way removing any quantification or qualification so Christ fully he has it all and and that's the fullness of the glory of God in Jesus Christ all right now that's a big huge block there now I'm going to take a I'm going to lay another block here hope I'm not laying eggs but building blocks in numbers chap 14: 211 and we use this on Sunday I guess if there's one positive benefit from what I've been going through I'm having to go a lot slower and be more deliberate in my speech just to talk so maybe maybe I'm going at a pace that's a little bit more palpable and maybe it's your prayers that have caused this because you wanted me to slow down well here we are in numbers 14:21 he says but as truly as I live God speaking and this is an answered to Moses and his concern I think even brother Matthew Watkins was touching along these these um principles in Moses's prayer a a and and Moses's concern and God swears but as truly as I live so God swears in oath and he's swearing and he's swearing by himself because he can swear by none greater as surely as I live as truly as I live all the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord God SW this this is a promise all the Earth will be filled with the glory of the Lord now some look at the scripture and they surmise that what he means is this as God did great exploits in Egypt and manifested his great power um then all the land such as Palestine is going to see the hands of God or they're in the wilderness and it's kind of localized or generalized that well it speaks of what's relevant to Israel and that all those in Israel and in the promised land are going to see the glory of the Lord but this speaks Beyond just is Israel this speaks Beyond just those borders it's not just saying well what I did in Egypt even though he's saying that 10 times I did this and you guys disregard him me you've hardened your heart but it speaks to it's prophetic God's going to do great exploits God is going to manifest himself in Israel but God is going to do more than that because one day Christ comes on the scene and now God's glory is dwelt in this temp uh Temple not the Tabernacle not the temple in Jerusalem but in Jesus Christ but even this is not fulfilled In the Flesh of Jesus Christ but it foreshadows the future Kingdom when Christ was on earth the earth uh saw the glory of God and in Earth the glory of God was manifested no question this was being done uh to some extent in the days of Christ but there will come a day and I just want to point to it real quick there is coming a day when all kingdoms of this world will become christs and it'll be a kingdom that envelops the entire Earth won't just be to the Sea and to the river to the South to the North but it'll be from sea to Sea it'll be the entire Earth all the Earth all kingdoms will be surrendered to Christ it'll be that perfect Kingdom be the perfect realization so there is prophecy of this Kingdom that is to come and I would like to kind of insert here that the millennial Kingdom and the reign of the son of David is a very remarkable Kingdom because it still exists within time when there's still sin and opposition and still yet a judgment to come and an eradication of all evil death hell in the grave and all those whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life will be cast in the Lake of Fire and the millennial Reign exists during that time and if you could think a lot about what that Millennial Reign represents even before total renovation and annihilation of the earth and a changing of the Earth's nature and structure and the whole surface of the Earth has changed I want you to recognize that because it holds some beautiful truths for us that if there can be come on now I'm I'm talking to myself if there can be a rain like that even before the Earth is physically changed to a baptism of fire if you can have that before the complete renovation of the Earth's physical structure then can there not be a rain now in this earth before the change Hallelujah before the change can there be a millennium that begins to break down within my soul the reign of a king begins to rise up Amen Let Him rise up inside of us to say this Earth this Earth is mine and all the glory therein Hallelujah and the Bible begins to speak in Isaiah 6:3 and notice the language how this is phrased he says I swear the Earth will be filled with the glory of the Lord and now it says in Isaiah 6:3 and one Cried unto another these angels this worship said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is is full of his glory amen so here's one saying it will be filled with the glory of the Lord and now there's this utterance that the whole earth is full of his glory amen in Psalm 72:19 and blessed be his glorious name forever and now the prayer we could say here God swore it here God does it and here comes the Cry of the psalmus and blessed be his glorious name forever and let the whole earth be filled with his glory amen and amen am notice he said he would do it we see that he does and there's the cry there's the prayer there's The Plea let the whole earth be filled with his glory here's a large thought the glory of God is his is an ultimate the expression of God's glory is really at the heart of what he's doing the glory of God is the ultimate purpose of creation it's your ultimate goal what what Glory do you want to declare your own the glor glory of the earth Glory of a church the glory of an ideal there's a lot of glories that man May seek after and man kind of at his core and his Bas nature seeking after Glory some popularity Prestige or power he he's looking to be revered by others to be looked to as powerful uh where where man at his nature his base nature even his Fallen nature is in the pursuit of some sort of glory and that's a perversion really of God the unknown God the invisible God the hidden nobody knows him think of this here he is the allmighty one the self-existing one the strong one and nobody knows anything about him he's all alone and so God's objective from the beginning is to declare his glory and if you could think of that everything that God has done from the beginning he wants his glory to be known he wants his glory to be known what do the heavens declare his glory what does the creation declare his glory the Bible says in Revelations 4:11 Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive Glory glory and honor and power for thou Hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created if I could say this creation was for the express purpose of declaring God's glory even to the point that if you don't declare him the gcks will cry out and praise him because there go there has to be one that declares his glory there is it's his glory that needs to be declared this is something at the heart of God's objective and purpose and I don't want this phrase just to be lost but the glory of God is an ultimate he says in Isaiah 4321 the PE this people have I formed for myself is now it's going Beyond just like the creation of the earth and all creatures in creation but now the people that he has formed for his purpose the bride the elect I formed them for myself they shall show forth my praise that's his so forth yes they they will they will manifest they will declare so just as God dwelt fully in his son and dwelt fully in Christ and and that flesh was M it was created by God but it was kin kinship to man want you see that H he was uh human he was man a God man so there's the Affinity to the Earth and God dwelt fully in Christ and just as God dwelt fully in his son he wants his glory to fill the whole earth tie into this those of you who are really have an appetite for the message and as you've been taught very well in your experience with God I know you have knowing the churches you're from and the Ministries that have ministered to you connect this right back to Christ is the mystery God revealed and the three-fold purpose that you have to manifest him F self fully through the Sun and then have preeminence in his bride to bring back what what he calls a Garden of Eden back to our original position so this is now Colossians 1:18 now this is the verse we read we said for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell but this is the verse that precedes it I trust I'm doing okay on time tonight says and he is speaking of Christ he is the head of the body this is the one that it pleased God that in him all fullness full Ness would dwell says and he is the head of the body and notice he says the church so now this is a different kind of language Christ is the head and he's the head of the body which is the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead speaking of Christ that in all things he might have the preeminence now to me this speaks he's the chief he's the Lord of all he's the head so there's some sort of sovereignty there's some sort of complete Reign that he has if he's going to be the preeminent one he's going to to be the Eminence in all things so this this this is uh I had to pull back the curtain a little bit cuz in my mind I'm thinking well how is the how is the glory of God going to fill the whole earth there's got to be some means that it does that and now Christ is to have preeminence in all things and he wants the go God wants his glory to fill the whole earth and there's some I see some uh companion image to Christ having pre in all things and now the image to me becomes a little bit more distinct or clear because now Christ is described as the head of the body and the body is the church or if I could say bride just to be a little bit more particular so Christ we know is the temple but now it's depicted as a body of which Jesus Christ is the head and this is uh it's not a construct that we would use to make the go word of God seem less clear but it's a way of describing it so you could understand really what it is the temple was not the ultimate it foreshadowed the ultimate so we wouldn't never want the temple itself to confuse what the ultimate is like wow but the temple was so many feet long and it had these rings and it had these colors and and you try to figure out you know longitude and latitude and add everything up and see if you can make it's like well it was just there pointing to Christ really what you want to know is Christ and we're not trying to figure out how tall he was are we well just just how full was his beard I'm just curious right we're not bogged down in all the minutia of the physical manifestation like no he is the word the fullness dwell therein and that's kind of the that's what leads us into this beginning of a relationship to know him and who he really is through his word and so Christ is the temple but now it's depicted as him being the head of a body amen and Ephesians 1: 22 and 23 as it says that in all things he might have the preeminence now writing in a very similar language he says this that God had put all things under the feet of Christ and gave him Christ to be the head over all things to the church so he has preeminence in all things but this preeminence is for the sake of the church that he's the head of all things to the church this is the one that has the preeminence and it says the church now don't let that 23 get in the way of understanding what he's talking about which is his body right the fullness of him that filth all in all amen I I I I just feel impressed to say this and I'll get into more detail in a later service that Paul to the Ephesians prays that they might be filled with all the fullness of God and that the purpose of the ministry speaking the truth in love is that we might come to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so this fullness as it related to Christ now there's a language being used of us it pleased him that all the fullness of God would dwell in Jesus but now we saying that the church which is his body is the fullness of him that filth all in all we read that the church with which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all so the body which is the church the body is the fullness of him that body is the living body it's used of a family so the church is that living body the bride is the fullness of him it's quite a statement the body is that which cast a shadow as distinguished from the shadow itself yes sir so listen in this context we're not talking about a moon that's reflecting the light of the sun we're talking about the body itself we're talking that the body is the very thing that would cast a shadow let's think about this this is this is not just a a a shadow or a semblance but the body is the object it is the substance it is the fullness of him that filth all in all filth means to fill to full measure to make complete in every way to render perfect there's a lot of ways to look at this so that it kind of anchors in our hearts and makes more sense but if Christ had an objective to redeem all the elect then there's a certain filling up that has to transpire in order to satisfy that and make it complete so it's not maybe as mysterious as we try to make it out to be sometimes because just even in that aspect alone that when the full body is made up then it completes and satisfies Christ his manifestation his objective his very purpose and so the body is that which fills up and completes and renders perfect Christ and the sacrifice and what he was trying to achieve I I one translation kind of rendered it this way for in that body lives the full measure of him who makes everything complete and who fills everything everywhere with himself amen this is the position now of the of the Bride As a body it is the fullness of him that filth all in all Amen in Colossians 2:9 we read for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily right we caught that in him dwell all the fullness of the godhead bodily and you ye are complete in [Music] him talk about a woo in him dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily and now you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power in him you're complete in him you're made made perfect in him you're made whole so the fullness of God was in Christ and now the Believers are given fullness in Christ and and I want you to see it on maybe a broader scale that the body the bride in totality is the fullness of him that filth on on John 1:16 and of his fullness have we all received in Grace of for Grace this is our participation that if all fullness of God was in Christ now we are participating in the fullness in him dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and we are complete in him we are in him therefore we're part of this completeness in 2 Peter 1:4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises by the word ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust we are to be partakers of the divine nature think and think of that as Christ in him dwell all deity so we said the full the fullness of deity dwell in him that's deity is the divine nature but now we're to be partakers of deity partakers of divine nature give some uh give some prayer and consideration to to even what Pentecost represents there a lot of things related to it a lot of ancillary things and a lot of manifestations of the spirit that are related to it but if I could just the Thunder of a whole series I've been preparing Pentecost is deity indwelling the individual that's it that's what that's the objective is to come to that place where God would indwell in US brother Bram says I've seen people at ball games get so happy they'd stammer their lips and everything else I know this is how the it's usually used is that well if you can shout at a ball game and act all crazy I can do it in church but brother Bram in different places is saying you know what to shout in church is no different than what you do at a ball game game come on somebody it's exactly what he's saying he said they get excited at a ball game and you get excited at church no difference he says don't tell me we're in need of a Revival of Salvation and the Pentecostals come around get the people worked up and tell them they speak in tongues they got the Holy Ghost and some of them live all kind of lives afterwards says listen brother the day of Pentecost it wasn't so they never relied upon any tongues or anything while they were standing in one place in one Accord God came down literally among them they saw in each one of them licks of fire about like that hanging above their head God was there I love this it was no accepted by faith or some emotion they were filled with the Holy Ghost and they went out and began to speak with tongues but first they met God and he said that's what the matter today people get worked up and excited emotion and it's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is tabernacling deity your word is his word he says I tell you what we need today is a call what we need today is a call not to some emotion not to some non-emotion not to some dry confession not to formalism but a call to Tabernacle deity a call to come back to the New Birth the Holy Ghost is tabernacling [Music] deity so we have been made partakers of the divine nature and if we are tabernacling deity in 1 Corinthians 3 16-1 17 says know you not that ye are the temple of God and now we're intersecting with kind of where we a place we were on Sunday and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you it's this qu this is a question do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the if the and the spirit of God dwells in you if the spirit of God dwells in you your temple just like Christ was If any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are could I just speak soberly to us that you're a temple of the Holy Ghost yes and if you're defiling it God's going to let you be destroyed there's corruption setting in there's things that's going to come against you there's things you're going to bow with things that are going to come up we've got to stay Sanctified I can't emphasize it enough to us as a church the things that brother brandham taught whether it be from television all the way to Fashion to music you name it were principles of Holiness and sanctification so that Christ could have the preeminence not legalism am and once we get detached from the why and the purpose of of the things that God taught us we're going to find ourselves kind of just a drift and we uh untethered from purpose and meaning and and feel unsatisfied because we're not even recognizing the basic purpose of Holiness in our lives and staying Sanctified how can you find satisfaction in the extracurricular if we can't even kind of get our foundation real deep on the principles of clean living sir we are a temple of the Holy Ghost brother said Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was man the temple this is important to understand that we now are a temple Christ is a temple but now somehow in that Christ himself don't want to say he's a shadow but he was the first born he's the first fruits he is an image of what all of us are to be know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you he says in 1 Corinthians 6:19 which you have of God you don't have it on your own and you are not your own good now for the sake of Expediting if the old Temple as a shadow was full of his glory if the Tabernacle of witness which was temporary and pointed to the temple that would be built by Solomon was full of his glory if the temple itself was full of his glory and then Christ himself we can say well let me just say there if that Temple himself the old historical reality was full of his glory then ought not the body be full of his glory if the Earth is going to be full of the glory of God if one day the Earth is going to be full of the glory of God then would not we as a Ty be full of his glory I'll pick up on some of that maybe on Sunday morning on what God does to the Earth he does the individual I hope you're seeing that parallel there if the Earth is going to be full of his glory and one day the Earth is going to be full of his glory I believe that there's a place for us today as Believers to be the means by which the Earth is full of his glory and as individuals We should strive I wa I say strive but we should first desire and then pursue that desire to manifest the full measure that we have received brother bradam said the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam's was at the beginning that's this end time prophecy the complete body of Christ uh I want to I want to say this because it it'll help with your understanding through the church ages as it moved from the East to the West there were certain you could see it even moved geographically right and you could see the progression of it now in the end this word goes around the world and there's efforts being made to translate in every tongue and every language not so that it would be printed and then in print we say wow it's been manifested in every tongue but that the Believers would read it and become that word they would hear it and become that word and so then you see the whole Earth the whole earth is going to be full of the glory of God as the word is received into people's hearts and lived out around the globe that ought to put a fire in our hearts for Missions to see that this message is getting out and God bless you those of you who give Faithfully time and time again to missions and supporting these Works around the world it's part of God's glory filling up the Earth amen the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride the complete the full the fullness of him which filth all and all is going to be in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adams was at the beginning a hidden Mystery now becoming manifested Glory because the woman is the glory of the man there was a hidden glory in Adam that wasn't known till the woman expressed it and there's a hidden glory in Christ Heaven's mystery that's not revealed until we reveal it in Earth now that's a lot of foundation for this and I felt just a come to this spot and hopefully we can end on this tonight I've got a few more pages here set out before me but I hope we can just end on this Christ was the fullness now his bride gathered a lot of teaching from the message the bride is the fullness of the word so she is in this end time manifesting God's glory Christ was the fullness now the bride will be the fullness the complete body of Christ the fullness is revealed in the form of a bride now the B brother brand teaches us as he said he was the fullness of God God dwelt in Christ without measure God was in Christ he had the spirit fully brother Bram says and this is take it from many many different places he had the spirit without measure like all the water out there in the sea that was what was in him so you think there was no more sea because all the fullness that's in the waters brother BR saying as a type this just a little type here said all the water that's in the ocean all the water that was in the sea by type is what was in Christ such that if you took if all the waters in all the world represented God's glory once it was all in Christ there's no more sea because it's all in Christ now if all the glory of God dwelt in Christ and he had it fully and now the bride is the fullness of the word manifest in his glory individually tonight at 8:17 on Wednesday night what does it mean to us for us spiritually individually what does that mean for you brother Adam what would that mean for you brother Rowan that all the fullness was in God now the bride's going to have the fullness but what does that practically mean for me and this isn't a detour this is a necessary stop in the sermon Paradox brother bam says we have the spirit by portion he had it without measure he was the fullness of the godhead bodily God but we have it by measure now I don't have these in there but John there's a I'm not going to get to everything that's in there tonight and I thought i' just try to work through these quickly but I might have to slow down a little bit so we have the spirit by portion when he says we he means you and I individually we all have it by Portion by measure he had it without measure he was the fullness we have it by measure the uh the sermon show us the father he says it this way we have the spirit with measure he had it without measure we are Sons and Daughters of God by measure now familiar with that you each one are familiar with the fact that Christ had it fully but then brother bam kind of brings this distinction says in Christ was the fullness of God but now when you break it down individually none of us have the fullness but we have some measure now to say that we have the spirit by measure this is the real thrust of what I want to come to now is to say that we have it by measure is not in any way a limitation for those who are filled with the Holy Ghost to say that Christ had it fully without measure and that you have it by measure in no way is a limiting factor in how the power of God ought to operate in us though we have it by measure if I can say this there no excuse on there's no excuse to say well I mean he was born of a virgin and he had it without measure and you know and I'm I'm I was born in sin and my question would be have you been born again okay so then you're born again by Incorruptible seed you have now had a birth which is liken unto his and that now the spirit of God dwells in you I want you to think of this I'm going to save some of this for the next time that if the spirit the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you this is saying now think about what's in you the fact that it's in you makes you a temple so if you are a temple then think about what this represents and the power of God that's embodied in this representation not as a shadow anymore but as the body what ought this to represent what ought this to portray what ought this to do so the fact that we would have the spirit by measure individually is no excuse and no limiting factor on the spirit that is in Us by measure because in the message Paradox says we have the spirit by portion but now he says in the same seron now that's like taking a spoonful of water out of the ocean Jesus was the whole ocean but this is just a spoonful right so Christ is the whole ocean over there there'll be no more sea why because it's filled up in another vessels by type just by using an example but it's like a spoonful Jesus had the whole ocean you have a spoonful he says but remember the same chemicals that's in the whole ocean is in this spoonful yes he said only it's more of it out there so that's taking a spoonful of the ocean think of how vast these seas are and we oh the whole entire ocean was in Christ can't get my head around that but now A Spoonful is in me and brother B says now that's just to understand how the fullness was him and how you as an individual member now somehow have just a measure but he he he kind of pauses and say well let me clarify that measure that's in you has all the same chemicals that's in the entire ocean there's just more of those chemicals in the ocean so in the same sermon show us the father he revisits again as he says we have the spirit by measure he has it without he says like taking a spoonful of water out of the ocean and he's the whole ocean but the same chemicals that's in the spoon is in the whole ocean it's quantity but the same quality amen the same quality he say well there's in Christ was all of it but in me is a measure of it and even though it may not be as much it's the same quality it's the same quality because we're talking about fullness and I want you to think about your place individually now that the bride is the fullness so there's some the part that filth up so if I could say that God's got spoonfuls he's got spoonfuls he's got to measure out he's got to give and these spoonfuls have a measure and it's a designation but as he gives out a spoonful it's like well I'm going to give you Hunter a spoonful I'm going give you one but your your quality is better than his there's no check brand right the there there's no one's better than the other typee thing we don't need AI to generate the reviews for us if you've got the Holy Ghost it's the same quality as the Holy Ghost I've got you've got same quality and as these spoonfuls are being distributed brother's using this example so that we could understand ourselves without limitation right amen we have it by measure but I think I've mentioned this before but I want to say it with some Force now there are more molecules in a teaspoon of water than there are teaspoons of water in the Pacific Ocean so if you were to somehow be able to determine how many teaspoons of water are in the Pacific Ocean and you'd have a number of teaspoons it's saying the chemicals right in the water there's more chemicals in one teaspoon right than there are teaspoons that's good amen so tell me that the measure is a limiting factor we know there might be a billion teaspoons in your teaspoon are more chemicals than there are teaspoons siren that in you is the all the quality the endless Eternal all powerful quality if you could somehow come up with a measure of God the quality of Eternity is in the Spoonful of deity that is in you therefore if Christ was the whole ocean that was eternal power that was a certain kind of quality and the Spoonful has not limited that quality because in you are all the same chemicals that are in the ocean that's why we could say yeah I might have it by measure but without limitation amen come on the only limit is by the faith which we live the only thing that limits it is the faith that we choose to live by it's in there by measure Without Limits because the same quality it's God Amen a lot that can tack onto that but in Romans 12: 3-5 the end of verse three there it says as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith there's been some dealing out some dispens dispensing to every man a Measure of Faith now again that might seem to be limiting but if Faith the size of a mustard seed then whatever measure you have of faith that faith unhindered is measureless am I making any sense maybe not but that's the Paradox whatever Measure of Faith you've been given if it's unhindered by unbelief unbelief is taken away from the equation whatever's in it is powerful enough to operate the Eternal Word of God and he says for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many here's all the measures all the spoonfuls all the members we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another right how is it then we could have fullness it's because each spoonful each measure is measuring it all up brother brand says this in everpresent water from the rock ah man I've run out of time I really I mean do you want me to okay are you sure okay all right please don't throw me in the Brier patch he says what we need today is not pray for more power you got enough power to make a new Earth w Wait a new Heaven new Earth you've got enough power to make a new Earth we don't need to pray for more power he says what you need is Faith to use that power amen right what you need is Faith to use that power that's what I need is Faith there's only one building block for Faith Saints what we need is Faith and he says what you need is to control that life in our family devotions we've been looking at self-control it's been very very edifying he says what you need is to control that life what you need is more power I need more power I need more power bless God I need to cast The Devil out woohoo yeah shout right that's what I need no you need power to control that life you need to control that life live such a Godly life life that when you ask God anything you know we have confidence in God of that we know if we keep his Commandments he'll withhold no good thing from us if we walk with him God walking with us what a beautiful theme I want to walk with him I want to walk with him walking with him makes things clear walking with him unfolds things before me walking with him will give me or more understanding the scripture walking with him will give me this knowledge of him and the glory of God and what I need is not more power I've got enough power in me how by the measure I've got because the measure I have has this endless quantity of God I may have the spirit by measure but I've got a limitless God that's represented in that measure and in that is Limitless power so what I need is not more power I need more faith God give me more faith more faith to use that power because that power operates according to the law of Faith the law of character therefore we need to allow the word to give us more wisdom and knowledge and Revelation that positions us amen and I wouldn't want to I I don't I think there's ways that we can describe it that can sometimes make it seem like we're being combative with and it's just the terminology that's combative if you say that you are a fully placed son right now and that's your Paradigm and that's what you believe you're fully adopted and positionally placed son right now then the language I would use is you need a revelation of what that means you need if you're firmly planted positionally plac fully adopted son of God you need to grow in wisdom Revelation knowledge and understanding of what that place means and that's one way of describing it another way of saying is I need wisdom Revelation and knowledge to place me positionally in the body of Christ what I am what we need today is a call a call to our place a call to our position and the word of God to the place where whatever wherever I am and wherever he puts me whatever zip code it might be as long as I know my place in Christ as long as I'm kind to coming to a greater understanding of my relationship to him I'm going to be a Powerhouse of God on two feet I'm going to have the power of God with me wherever I go whatever situation I find myself in individually as a husband as a wife as a family I will not fear what man can do un me cuz in my position and in my place I know though all hell be against me nothing can Prevail against [Music] me we are to manifest our measure of Glory in the place and the office and the manner that God has called us to am Brothers if you could come to your instruments I want to close with this statement in the sermon and absolute I think this will do a good job of tying some of these things together does it click a little for you what I mean by manifesting your measure of Glory if I've got a spoonful that's got a quality to it I want to manifest the quality I want to manifest the quality and that's my part if I can manifest my measure you manifest your measure it's filling up the sermon and absolute take note of when it was preached he says GE he says Jesus when he was on Earth Anointed with that they saw notice he said I come from God the spirit the light the pillar of fire and I returned to God and he was made flesh in order to die for our sins then after his death burial resurrection and Ascension after he ascended up on the 40 days he ascended up and on the 50th day he returned back notice he returns back there on the day of Pentecost in the form of a pillar of fire among the people and separated himself like tongues of fire and set upon each of them and then they were all filled with the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost is Tabernacle and deity this is Pentecost when the Holy Ghost indwells them this is that most reverent special designation on the day of Pentecost amen this if if there's one thing that we could distinguish from all time in history that represents Pentecost it's this and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance God separated himself God first in a great Pillar of Fire God manifested in the human body now God separated himself among his people the pillar of fire breaking up and setting upon each of them like Fork lick of blazes cloven tongues set upon them Forks of fire clo tongues like fire set upon each of them and they were all filled with that and begin to speak with tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now this next statement to me is so powerful now you see we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity am because each of us is holding a part of God Amen now he is not saying this to Arizona Believers Church he's saying this to the body of Christ and I believe that we as members of this assembly we hold that dear to our hearts and thank God for a church that we could attend that we feel to be a part of and can call it home but we got to recognize that this church serves the true church and your place in this church really only has power and weight because you have place in the body of Christ and so so that's what he's speaking to we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity because each one of us is holding a part of God this is bigger than the local assembly this is the fullness of him the bride and we must come together now I know there's a way that when we read this I I I think that even when we first kind of read through this and I'm not trying to condition you against seeing it this way but I know that when we read this we typically make comment that when we come to church each one of us brings our lick of fire and as we bring our licks of fire the kind of the phrase is we recreate the pillar of fire again and and and just let's just kind of tap the brakes a little bit right because in a in a sense if there is a measure that makes up the whole Pillar of Fire that's not just represented in a couple thousand people that we could somehow scramble together for a meeting in the United States right that still would just be part because it's represented globally and every bride member that is baptized in the body of Christ and that will be baptized in the body of Christ so the coming together is not just simply in a convention or meeting but it has something to do with coming into the unity of the faith amen hallelujah and we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness in the fullness of it when his church sets together in Heavenly places I I believe that brother Brenham when I read all these different places it has a representation in nights like this it means something in a shadow you brought your lick of fire you brought your lick of fire you brought your lick of fire here it's being G then what a representation what a power that's available to us seated together in Heavenly places letting them have preeminence all of us being brought into one mind and one Accord through a church service but now I think of his fullness come on Amen that when we can come together the pillar fires manifested in the wholeness and the fullness of it when the church sets together in Heavenly places then the fullness of the power of God is in his church each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that pillar fire back again so even though this might not be the whole it's a measure that makes up the whole even though I may not have the fullness I'm a measure that makes up the fullness so I've got to manifest my measure of Glory I have to manifest the glory whatever that pillar fire represents in type now you represent it yes you represent it amen just to think of the the the pillar of fire declared the presence of God on Earth whether it be a column of fire as it would lead the children of Israel by night night but then he's also a cloud did what it declared the presence of God on Earth we find that in 1952 he's photographed I believe it was as a pillar of fire right there in the deadness of night but at the rising of the Sun in the opening of this word he declares himself in a cloud why because it's daylight it's daytime a new day is Dawn and what is the cloud in the heavens declaring his presence on Earth H it's no more night time this is daytime this is no more Shadows this is time for fullness I want to manifest my measure of Glory Let Your Light Shine Let It Shine Let It Shine Let It Shine Let It Shine in its Simplicity in me that we might do our part as a church to come together we do not draw our swords in any way in some sort of carnality we got our minds on one goal that he would have the preeminence we got our minds set on one goal that the word what it would have its have its fullness in the body of Christ and I I just want to be so selfish as to think it'll never be in its fullness in the body if I can't let him have his preeminence in me so I say Lord let your glory be filled fill all this Earth if the Earth can be full of his glory before that Eighth Day then cannot this body in its weakness and its pain this body still gets sick because it was born of a woman this mind still battles because it's part of that original birth but I've got the glory of God by New Birth on inside of me and I want to believe that it can radiate and radiate and radiating the Earth and manifest our measure of Glory stand tonight
