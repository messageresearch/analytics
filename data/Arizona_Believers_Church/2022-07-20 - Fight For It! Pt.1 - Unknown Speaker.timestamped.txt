[0:00] my title tonight is fight for it
[0:02] and i was really impressed with this um
[0:05] this week and have been studying on the
[0:07] subject of fighting
[0:09] actually been pawning for some time on
[0:10] the subject of fighting a lot of the
[0:12] inspiration is just how how much we've
[0:14] seen we know we're engaged in a fight
[0:16] and it seems sometimes we get turned
[0:17] around in the battle and we find
[0:18] ourselves facing one another in face
[0:20] instead of the true enemy
[0:22] but i wanted just to share this in a way
[0:24] to encourage you this may be a part one
[0:28] but the title is fight for it and we're
[0:29] just gonna encourage you to be fighting
[0:31] for the right things if you look at
[0:33] verse eight i wanna start here and just
[0:35] kind of travel with me and this thought
[0:36] it says a time to love and a time to
[0:39] hate and that's a those two have
[0:41] comparisons one to another and are
[0:44] opposites and we understand this one may
[0:46] be better than the one before a time of
[0:48] war and a time
[0:50] of peace it's interesting that we often
[0:52] engage in war for peace we actually
[0:54] fight to have peace but a time of war
[0:57] it's a time to fight it's a time to do
[0:59] battle means to make war first time that
[1:01] this word is actually used in the
[1:02] scripture i believe is genesis chapter
[1:04] 14 and the battle of the kings there in
[1:07] sodom gomorrah
[1:09] and that's the first time this is kind
[1:10] of this whole idea of warfare and doing
[1:13] battle and fighting that's what a time
[1:15] of war is and then there's a time of
[1:17] peace you could kind of give whatever
[1:19] definition you want to that but would be
[1:20] tranquility time of rest and accord
[1:23] where everyone is happy dwelling
[1:25] together and this
[1:27] verse kind of what leads to this verse
[1:29] is a number of different comparisons
[1:31] each one you could break them down and
[1:32] spend a lot of time just considering it
[1:34] but it says to everything there is a
[1:36] season and a time to every purpose under
[1:39] the heaven i think it's easy for all of
[1:41] us tonight just as human beings if we
[1:43] didn't even put it in the context of the
[1:45] word of god it's easy for us to accept
[1:47] that there are times and there are
[1:49] seasons we look at nature there are
[1:51] seasons and we see the different seasons
[1:53] in nature and we can explain them well
[1:55] it's this way because of the uh the
[1:57] earth and the relationship to the sun
[1:59] and we know that there's times and
[2:00] seasons to everything so it's easy for
[2:02] us to accept times of life and seasons
[2:05] but it's not always easy to know when
[2:07] each season
[2:09] is right we can say fall season well you
[2:11] just look at the calendar you look at
[2:13] the temperature
[2:14] but it's not always easy to discern a
[2:16] time to love and a time to hate it's not
[2:18] always easy to know when there's a time
[2:20] of war and when a time of peace is would
[2:23] you agree you say well there's a time to
[2:25] cast away and there's a time to gather
[2:27] well when is it
[2:29] it's a time to there's a time to rip and
[2:30] there's a time to sew we could accept
[2:32] that there's times for ripping and time
[2:34] for sowing but knowing just exactly when
[2:37] to do it isn't always as easy as just
[2:39] saying well there's a time for it
[2:42] it reminds me of some counsel that
[2:44] sister biscuit gave sister elizabeth
[2:46] years ago and she's two things she said
[2:49] that always to remember it's just a
[2:51] phase
[2:52] and it doesn't really matter i think was
[2:53] in relation to raising up children you
[2:55] know it's just a phase and it doesn't
[2:57] really matter and there's a lot of
[2:58] things that happen we can get all worked
[3:00] up and we say it doesn't really matter
[3:02] and there's times when things are
[3:03] happening and say well it's just a phase
[3:06] and i remember shortly after that it's
[3:07] kind of a long story but i'll just keep
[3:09] it short and get to the punch line
[3:10] brother tim dodd didn't get us to the
[3:12] airport on time and i was a little bit
[3:13] upset
[3:14] that we were going to miss our flight
[3:16] because there was a line out the door in
[3:17] grand prairie alberta of all places
[3:19] and and i was kind of seething a little
[3:22] bit that i was going to miss my flight
[3:23] and elizabeth told me she said honey it
[3:26] doesn't really matter
[3:28] and i clenched my teeth and said don't
[3:29] worry it's just a phase
[3:34] and so there's that's the challenge
[3:36] right is to know when is which and how
[3:38] do they all apply in joel chapter 3
[3:40] verses 9 to 11 it says proclaim you this
[3:42] among the gentiles prepare war
[3:45] wake up the mighty men let all the men
[3:46] of war draw near let them come up beat
[3:48] your plowshares into swords and your
[3:50] pruning hooks into spears
[3:52] let the weak say i am strong
[3:54] assemble yourselves and come all ye
[3:56] heathen and gather yourselves together
[3:58] round about feather cause thy mighty
[4:00] ones to come down oh lord this is a
[4:02] clear
[4:03] prescription for war
[4:05] prepare war that all the men of war draw
[4:08] near and this is how this is how
[4:10] important this warfare is take the very
[4:12] things that you use to plow up your
[4:14] fields to give you crops to feed your
[4:16] family turn your plowshares into swords
[4:19] your pruning hooks and despairs because
[4:21] now every resource needs to be made
[4:23] available to fight
[4:25] assemble yourselves come together
[4:27] and cause the mighty ones to come down
[4:29] the lord and this is a declaration of
[4:30] warfare to turn plowshares into swords
[4:33] pruning hooks into spears
[4:35] but then in isaiah chapter 2 verse 4 and
[4:37] it says and he shall judge among the
[4:38] nations and shall rebuke many people and
[4:40] they shall beat their swords into
[4:42] plowshares and their spears into pruning
[4:44] hooks nations shall not lift up sword
[4:46] against nation neither shall they learn
[4:48] war anymore
[4:50] one hand we're being told to turn our
[4:52] plowshares into swords and then our
[4:53] swords into plowshares our spears into
[4:56] pruning hooks and our pruning hooks and
[4:57] despairs means there's a time for war
[4:59] but then there's also a time for peace
[5:03] we may be able to place these scriptures
[5:04] appropriately and the time and season
[5:06] that they would exist within the uh the
[5:08] continuity of god's word and the
[5:10] millennium and the time of war for the
[5:12] believer but it's just used to give an
[5:15] example the very same instrument that
[5:17] you might use to plow up the field may
[5:18] need to be turned into a sword but then
[5:20] that very thing that's used as a sword
[5:22] may need to be turned into
[5:24] a plowshare
[5:26] in hebrews chapter 7 part 1 this will be
[5:29] a very important quote just to grab a
[5:31] hold of and don't let it slip your mind
[5:33] tonight as we minister
[5:35] brother adam says now all wars are
[5:37] fought for principles this is what he
[5:39] said all wars are fought for principles
[5:42] now every fight every battle every
[5:45] engagement has some justification
[5:48] all wars are fought for principles
[5:50] there's a reason that's why we have the
[5:51] same pick your battles
[5:54] i choose which mountain you want to die
[5:55] on what principles are you choosing to
[5:57] die for what's what's your reason for
[5:59] engaging in conflict because he says all
[6:01] wars have some underlying justification
[6:04] or as he says here fought for principles
[6:06] now this was a very interesting
[6:08] statement now if you have a little war
[6:10] in church
[6:12] it must be the right principle for those
[6:14] of you visiting don't try to read into
[6:16] that
[6:17] if anything we're in the honeymoon phase
[6:19] of our church just a cream of the crop
[6:22] wonderful
[6:23] atmosphere and progress people ask how's
[6:25] the church doing i always say god is
[6:26] being very gracious to us
[6:28] but here's an interesting statement
[6:30] where brother man says if you have a
[6:31] little war in church you could go back
[6:33] and kind of catch the full context
[6:35] during that season he says if you have a
[6:36] little war in church it must be the
[6:38] right principle you must be fighting for
[6:40] the right thing and each member of the
[6:43] church is supposed to do that so if
[6:45] there's going to be a fight make sure
[6:47] you're fighting for the right thing if
[6:49] there's going to be a war and he's
[6:50] seeming to suggest that you can have
[6:52] little wars in church but you must be
[6:54] warring for the right thing he says it
[6:56] must be the right principle
[6:59] in other words don't declare war over
[7:01] something that's not worth fighting for
[7:04] don't i drive down a stake and i'm going
[7:06] to die on this mountain and i'm going to
[7:08] choose as some people even i'm even
[7:10] reminded now that some people staked
[7:12] their relationship with other believers
[7:14] and even seemingly their testimony on
[7:17] whether or not they were going to wear a
[7:19] mask or whether or not they're going to
[7:20] be socially distanced and people just
[7:22] chose that mountain to die on
[7:25] didn't plan on saying that but maybe
[7:26] it's a not too soon to say it
[7:29] but he says if you have a little war in
[7:31] church it must be the right principle be
[7:33] sure that what gets your gander up what
[7:35] you roll up your sleeves for what you
[7:37] find that you want to start standing for
[7:39] are the right kind of principles because
[7:41] he says you must be fighting for the
[7:43] right thing
[7:45] and saying that he is suggesting at
[7:47] least giving
[7:48] uh
[7:50] acknowledging that there's times when
[7:51] you do fight
[7:53] and i would say this is a large
[7:56] this is a large subject this is the
[7:58] paradox of faith
[7:59] and one thing to think about when we say
[8:01] the faith or faith think of the
[8:03] christian life so much that's assumed in
[8:05] that but it's the paradox of the
[8:07] christian life it's the paradox of our
[8:09] faith we're both fighting and resting
[8:13] we find ourselves in two states at the
[8:15] same time it seems and it's
[8:17] not schrodinger's cat necessarily but
[8:19] it's by observation that you determine
[8:21] whether or not the person is engaged in
[8:23] battle or whether or not the person is
[8:24] resting but it is a paradox of the
[8:26] believer that we are both trusting and
[8:29] believing and resting but at the same
[8:31] time fighting
[8:33] just to redeem brother tim dodd he uh
[8:35] got me late to the airport but he said
[8:37] something one time to me that's never
[8:38] left me and upheld me through many
[8:40] difficult things is he says faith has to
[8:42] have something against it
[8:45] if there's nothing opposing it then is
[8:47] it really faith
[8:48] if it's so evident to the senses if it's
[8:50] so manifestly declared to what's
[8:52] observable then how is it faith but
[8:55] faith has to have something contrary has
[8:57] to have a voice of criticism it has to
[8:59] have some sort of contravening story or
[9:01] some other something else working
[9:03] against it and fighting otherwise how
[9:05] can we even be sure that we're standing
[9:07] on faith alone
[9:09] and so faith sometimes in order to be
[9:11] faith has to have opposition or things
[9:13] that declare it to be false
[9:16] what a paradox
[9:18] in hebrews chapter 4 verses 9 to 11. i
[9:20] choose to share this just to get our
[9:22] minds thinking on the promise of rest it
[9:24] says they remain if therefore a rest to
[9:26] the people of god for he that has
[9:28] entered into his rest he also have
[9:30] ceased from his own works
[9:33] as god did from his let us labor
[9:35] therefore to enter into that rest
[9:37] laboring to rest even in that there
[9:39] seems to be a paradox let us labor
[9:41] therefore to enter into that rest unless
[9:43] any men fall after the same example of
[9:46] unbelief
[9:47] rest is such a large theme in scripture
[9:50] we could use the the the word trusting
[9:53] i'm confident
[9:55] we could use so many different
[9:56] scriptures to uh to lift this up we talk
[9:58] about
[9:59] the lily jesus says the lilies don't
[10:01] toil
[10:03] but it just uh taking no thought is then
[10:05] the example that we gather from that
[10:07] lilies don't toil they don't strive they
[10:09] don't fight uh they just seem to uh come
[10:12] into their radiant glory because god is
[10:13] looking out after them and then so we're
[10:15] told to rest in the same manner that a
[10:17] lillywood that just trusting god and the
[10:19] nature that he's given us by the new
[10:21] birth that is just going to produce what
[10:22] an autumn that he knows we need to eat
[10:24] we know we need to drink we need to be
[10:26] clothed and that god will provide all
[10:28] those things so there's a rest for the
[10:30] believer when they come into that place
[10:32] of faith which says i'm resting i'm
[10:33] trusting why aren't you worried why
[10:35] aren't you striving why aren't you doing
[10:37] all sorts of things i'm just trusting
[10:38] god i'm just believing
[10:40] but that doesn't push us over into the
[10:42] wrong kind of laziness and i don't
[10:44] provide for my family i don't work
[10:46] brother aaron why don't you have a job
[10:47] why aren't you paying the bills god will
[10:48] provide
[10:50] and so there's a there's something to it
[10:52] to where it's not always just the carnal
[10:54] idea it's not always to this degree
[10:56] and even in resting i believe that paul
[11:00] teaching this rest this to the believer
[11:01] he still writes to timothy in second
[11:03] timothy chapter 2 verses 3 to 5
[11:06] thou therefore endure hardness
[11:09] i wonder if timothy
[11:11] maybe having heard paul preach on rest
[11:13] and the believer's intended to rest and
[11:15] timothy says yes i'm resting i'm resting
[11:17] and then paul says endure hardness he
[11:19] says let's talk to me about the rest a
[11:20] little bit more
[11:22] amen
[11:23] preacher preached me happy thou
[11:25] therefore endure hardness as a good
[11:27] soldier of jesus christ so this is
[11:30] applicable not just to timothy and his
[11:32] calling but it's applicable to all of us
[11:34] as believers the image of being a
[11:35] soldier i'm on the battlefield for my
[11:38] lord i'm in the lord's army yes sir
[11:40] we're to endure hardness as a good
[11:42] soldier and this is no man that wareth
[11:45] entangle himself with the affairs of
[11:47] this life that he may please him who
[11:49] have chosen him to be a good soldier
[11:52] now paul seems to be going more leaning
[11:54] really far into this analogy of being a
[11:56] soldier and it's because it's still
[11:58] applicable to timothy in his office and
[12:00] his ministry and his calling in his
[12:01] position as a christian he has been
[12:03] chosen to be a good soldier therefore
[12:05] he's going to be warring
[12:07] amen
[12:08] and if you're warring you do not
[12:10] entangle yourself with the affairs of
[12:11] this life that you may please christ
[12:13] who's chosen you to be a soldier and if
[12:15] a man also strive for masteries yet he
[12:18] is not crowned except he strive lawfully
[12:22] so there is a direct this is this is and
[12:26] i wouldn't even say an implication this
[12:27] is just a very clear
[12:29] uh prescription that the believer is
[12:32] going to strive the believer is going to
[12:34] have to endure the believer is going to
[12:35] have to war because he's been chosen to
[12:38] be a soldier
[12:41] and the sermon of thinking man's filter
[12:43] again this is another one to join
[12:45] with that hebrews chapter seven part one
[12:47] all wars are fought for principles
[12:50] you must be fighting for the right thing
[12:52] this would be
[12:53] the real gut check
[12:55] uh the real cornerstone of what's
[12:57] burdened in my heart he says now let us
[13:00] all tonight check our desires
[13:02] and then you can see what kind of filter
[13:04] you've been drawing through thinking
[13:05] man's filters talk about whether or not
[13:06] you're drawing it through the word
[13:08] and if i could caution all of us i would
[13:10] say here we are uh if you're here on
[13:13] church on wednesday nights we pat
[13:14] ourselves on the back i've said this
[13:16] before
[13:17] that if you come to church on sunday
[13:18] morning you love church if you come on
[13:20] sunday evening you love your pastor and
[13:22] that's why we don't have an evening
[13:23] service on sundays
[13:24] and then they say if you come on
[13:26] wednesday night you love word
[13:29] and so i trust that that's what's in
[13:30] your heart you love the word of god you
[13:32] love the things of god this is something
[13:34] that's very real to your heart and
[13:35] that's just a saying that's not a
[13:37] doctrine or a principle we go by
[13:39] but i want us all to not necessarily
[13:42] immediately begin to think about
[13:44] the filter being the world and religion
[13:47] and denominations and trinitarianism and
[13:50] the days of miracles are passed
[13:52] but just there's ways that our filter
[13:54] the word can get gummed up with other
[13:56] things
[13:57] and and maybe we're not drawing
[13:59] everything through
[14:01] everything's not getting through as it
[14:02] ought to or it's presenting to us an
[14:04] incomplete picture so we're checking
[14:06] ourselves tonight and he says check to
[14:08] see what kind of filter you've been
[14:09] drawing through let's check each one of
[14:11] us here and out across the nation
[14:14] check your desires and what you really
[14:17] want in life
[14:18] i like that
[14:20] there's a there's a gut check time maybe
[14:22] as a sinner as a young person when you
[14:24] come to god and you drive a stake down
[14:26] and you know your life's been changed
[14:27] and that filter's been rearranged you
[14:29] begin to live your life for a while as a
[14:31] believer and you know you're a
[14:32] born-again christian you're serving god
[14:34] you're making difficult decisions your
[14:35] life's completely changed you find
[14:37] yourself
[14:38] serving god in church doing things that
[14:40] you otherwise would have never done had
[14:41] god not change your life but through the
[14:43] passage of time things can kind of just
[14:45] slip a little bit
[14:47] and you're you're filtering much more
[14:49] than you thought you were and it's time
[14:51] to check yourself and ask what do i
[14:54] really want in life and is what i'm
[14:56] trending to and aspiring uh what i say i
[15:00] want is what i'm doing really leading me
[15:03] to achieve what i really want
[15:06] and then he says check what you are
[15:08] fighting for
[15:11] because there's such a wrestling
[15:13] such a struggle such a fight sometimes
[15:15] in life
[15:16] things that we fight for things that
[15:18] we're very adamant about things that we
[15:20] want things that we don't want things
[15:22] that we strive to maintain certain
[15:23] appearances that we try to keep up
[15:25] certain platitudes that we try to
[15:27] bolster or even things in our lives that
[15:29] we're striving and fighting against and
[15:31] fighting for and trying to keep or
[15:32] trying to figure out and maybe we just
[15:34] need to take a step back and say why are
[15:35] you fighting
[15:38] why are you even fighting for this why
[15:39] are you even struggling check what
[15:40] you're fighting for check what you were
[15:42] here for
[15:43] check what you go to church for he says
[15:45] what makes you
[15:47] he says it's good to go to church but
[15:49] just don't go to church only
[15:52] that won't save you just check a few
[15:54] minutes say is my objective what kind of
[15:56] filter am i drawing through anyhow
[15:59] it's a good question for all of us i
[16:01] would say that based upon the things i'm
[16:02] going to share tonight and so i'm saying
[16:05] this at the outset
[16:06] is not self-serving but it's it's
[16:09] pointing to what i'm going to be uh
[16:10] addressing or just supporting through
[16:12] scriptures we're all fighting
[16:15] but what are we fighting for
[16:18] on some level there's some striving
[16:20] there's some hardness we're enduring
[16:22] there's some difficulty that we're
[16:23] undergoing and it's a good idea
[16:26] sometimes to have a little bit of a gut
[16:27] check and ask ourselves why am i
[16:29] fighting
[16:30] there's a principle that we could tap
[16:32] into as believers to realize that we are
[16:34] given a task to do and we have a job to
[16:36] do and a job is always going to be
[16:38] difficult it's always going to be hard
[16:39] there's always going to be things that
[16:40] we need to be doing and as long as we
[16:42] are in our position doing what we ought
[16:44] to do with the hammer in our hands then
[16:46] that there's a work to do and there's a
[16:48] hardness that comes with it there's a
[16:49] callousness that comes with working in
[16:51] the gospel working as a christian doing
[16:53] the things that we ought to do but then
[16:55] there's always a voice down in the
[16:57] valley of ono
[16:58] right we're drawing from the book of
[16:59] nehemiah they're saying hey why don't
[17:01] you come find why don't you come find us
[17:03] in the valley want you come fight us in
[17:05] in the plains here
[17:07] and come away from the job that you have
[17:09] to do and put down your hammer and come
[17:12] fight or talk with us in the valley and
[17:14] that's exactly what the devil wants you
[17:16] to do is put down your hammer to get
[17:18] into a fight
[17:20] and so if you're fighting you need to
[17:21] ask yourself whether or not you're
[17:23] fighting with a sword in one hand and a
[17:25] hammer in another because you're on the
[17:26] wall doing what you ought to do or
[17:28] whether or not you've been called away
[17:30] from where you should be and you find
[17:32] yourself fighting and struggling because
[17:33] you're not along the wall doing the work
[17:35] you should be doing
[17:38] i wish i could would have maybe give
[17:40] could give more attention to that
[17:41] tonight but there's so many more
[17:43] principles but keep that in mind that
[17:46] you're working you have a job to do and
[17:48] if you're fighting are you fighting
[17:49] because you're doing your job
[17:51] or are you fighting because you've left
[17:53] it
[17:55] because if you fight while doing the job
[17:56] god said that's my battle
[17:59] he's promised you he'll keep you he's
[18:00] promised you he'll fight your battles if
[18:02] you're fighting while alongside the wall
[18:04] then that's when you hear the sound of
[18:05] the trumpet and those that come to your
[18:07] aid and defend you and you'll find that
[18:09] god will fight those battles but if
[18:10] you've left your position to run out and
[18:12] start a fight god may be saying i didn't
[18:14] pick that fight you're on your own
[18:17] and you don't need to try to win the
[18:18] fight or save face leave it
[18:21] just leave it
[18:23] you don't need any bragging rights you
[18:24] don't know i beat the devil on his own
[18:26] ground no no no no you think you won
[18:27] you've actually lost get away from it
[18:30] there's no pride in this you're not
[18:32] owning that battle just admit it that
[18:34] you're not where you should be and just
[18:36] don't try to save face or make yourself
[18:38] look good just come right back where you
[18:39] know you ought to be do what you know as
[18:41] right as a christian and leave the fight
[18:43] and come back and say lord i'm sorry i
[18:45] got my i picked a fight with the devil
[18:47] and i was writing checks that i couldn't
[18:49] cash and i'm sorry here i'm back
[18:56] ask yourself what principles are we
[18:58] fighting for what stand what am i
[18:59] standing for and i'm doing everything i
[19:01] can to stand and i find it really really
[19:03] hard to stand and as it gets harder and
[19:04] harder to stand ask yourself where am i
[19:06] standing
[19:07] what is this all about now i'm not
[19:09] suggesting that you'll find that you're
[19:10] not where you should be but when you do
[19:12] that and it's gut check time to find i
[19:13] know i'm right where i belong
[19:16] because he said you must be fighting for
[19:17] the right thing and we check what you're
[19:19] fighting for there's a point which you
[19:20] realize yes the battle's always going to
[19:21] be hot and heavy in this there's always
[19:23] going to be a labor and a warfare when
[19:25] i'm doing what's right for god and you
[19:26] can stand strong
[19:29] in revelation chapter 12 we're kind of
[19:31] going all the way back to the beginning
[19:32] before the beginning to see just
[19:35] how
[19:36] much there is a warfare revelations
[19:38] chapter 12 verses 7 and 8 it says and
[19:40] there was a war in heaven
[19:42] but abraham says in the fourth seal
[19:44] first thing in heaven was a battle
[19:46] and there was war in heaven michael and
[19:48] his angels fought against the dragon and
[19:50] the dragon fought and his angels and
[19:52] prevailed not neither was their place
[19:54] found any more in heaven and brother
[19:57] branham said the first thing in heaven
[19:58] was a battle lucifer was kicked out and
[20:00] come to earth then he polluted eden then
[20:02] he's been polluting ever since
[20:04] so he the same
[20:06] devil who fought in heaven there wasn't
[20:09] a warrior in heaven then kicked down to
[20:11] earth and found his his peaceful jeans
[20:14] no he comes down to earth and he's been
[20:16] polluting and been fighting him and
[20:17] boring been warring ever since so no
[20:20] matter where you're born in time you're
[20:21] born into a war
[20:24] no matter what point in life you find
[20:25] yourself existent as long as you're here
[20:27] on earth in these dimensions it's a
[20:29] dimension of warfare and striving and
[20:31] fighting
[20:33] and the battle excuse me in the sermon
[20:34] the world is falling apart
[20:37] it says in our political world today and
[20:39] our religious world is just exactly like
[20:41] it was in the days of the first coming
[20:42] of the messiah it's polluted why because
[20:45] satan's been doing his job
[20:47] kicked out of first thing was a battle
[20:48] in heaven kicked down to earth and he's
[20:50] been polluting ever since the whole
[20:52] system is rotten our politics it could
[20:54] get no worse and our religion
[20:56] i don't see how it can get any worse
[20:58] than what it is now
[20:59] the whole thing is corrupted our
[21:01] political world man-made systems and
[21:03] fashions we want everything just
[21:06] everything so we can take it easy and
[21:08] retire and take life easy
[21:12] maybe an interesting transition from the
[21:14] rottenness of politics and man-made
[21:15] systems and fashions and everything's
[21:17] polluted but then he immediately says we
[21:19] want to take it easy and retire and take
[21:21] life easy
[21:22] amen
[21:23] i mean right
[21:25] i mean who here who here say no i don't
[21:27] ever want to retire i don't want to take
[21:28] it easy okay just make enough for the
[21:30] rest of us and maybe we can
[21:32] but this just seems to be the ambition i
[21:34] want to take it easy retire and take
[21:36] life easy life wasn't intended to be
[21:39] easy life is a struggle and i love this
[21:42] anything that's got life is strong as a
[21:45] struggling
[21:48] this could be a little bit of
[21:49] encouragement to you as we'll touch on
[21:52] here in a little bit that if you don't
[21:54] have life there's no fight
[21:56] if there's not some other desire that's
[21:58] been awakened inside of you to want to
[22:00] see the goodness of god to have every
[22:02] promise that he's given to you or to
[22:04] have a greater peace or to have more out
[22:07] of the word of god if you've got life in
[22:09] you then there's got to be a struggle he
[22:10] says look at the trees how they struggle
[22:12] look at everything that's got life it's
[22:14] a struggle and when we try to get some
[22:16] kind of system that takes it easy then
[22:19] we are wrong and we know there's
[22:21] something wrong
[22:22] there is no way that we could ever
[22:24] structure church and our doctrines and
[22:26] our belief systems to just make life
[22:29] easy on a christian the only way that we
[22:31] could do that would be to delude you to
[22:33] deceive you and to make you think that
[22:35] everything's fine but that would be the
[22:36] worst kind of wake-up call whenever the
[22:39] the illusion is lost whenever the mirage
[22:41] is finally recognized
[22:43] i've been chasing after the wrong thing
[22:47] anything that has life is struggling
[22:50] what is it struggling for to
[22:52] live it's struggling it's it's
[22:55] overcomings to keep life in you
[22:58] there's something that you're fighting
[23:00] for something that you're struggling for
[23:03] ask yourself in the fight and the in the
[23:06] battle and the struggle
[23:07] is it to live or am i actually am i
[23:10] actually working against life
[23:15] first timothy chapter 6 verse 12.
[23:20] first timothy chapter 6 verse 12
[23:23] fight
[23:24] the good fight of faith
[23:26] lay hold on eternal life
[23:29] whereunto thou art also called
[23:32] and has professed a good profession
[23:33] before
[23:34] many witnesses
[23:36] lay hold seize upon grasp do not let go
[23:41] to lay hold on eternal life to seize it
[23:43] there's
[23:44] there's almost some
[23:45] aggressiveness to it
[23:47] some intent i'm not just touching it i'm
[23:50] not just uh
[23:51] near it but i'm laying a hold of it i'm
[23:53] gonna have it my grasp and i'm not going
[23:56] to let it go this is something that you
[23:58] cannot rest away from me this is
[24:00] something that i i find no cause or
[24:02] reason to let go of
[24:04] and then it says fight the good fight
[24:07] of faith
[24:08] one
[24:10] i read in one place where he says
[24:11] agonize the good agony
[24:17] there's different takes on this
[24:18] scripture that
[24:20] would not want to use the terms fight or
[24:23] good fight
[24:24] but it's very plain in the way that paul
[24:25] meant it
[24:27] whether they would argue that it's just
[24:29] by type or just by way of analogy but it
[24:32] means fight
[24:33] conquer
[24:34] seize the prize fight the good fight
[24:38] as brother adam said that there could
[24:40] have a little war in the church so you
[24:41] must be writing fighting the must be the
[24:43] right principle you must be fighting for
[24:45] the right thing paul's saying if you're
[24:46] going to fight fight for the right thing
[24:48] fight the good fight of faith
[24:51] so there is a fight of faith which is
[24:53] the good one if it's not a faith then
[24:55] it's the wrong one
[24:56] you could be fighting but if it's not
[24:58] the fight uh the good fight of faith and
[25:00] it's the wrong fight or the bad fight of
[25:02] not faith or the bad fight of unbelief
[25:05] and you could get your knuckles bloody
[25:06] and you could wear yourself out you get
[25:08] pretty exhausted and you might feel like
[25:10] you've done something but you're in the
[25:11] wrong fight
[25:13] so he says agonize the good agony
[25:16] be don't be weary in well doing if you
[25:19] suffer for good sake think of all the
[25:21] scriptures that tell us that even when
[25:22] we're doing good and even when we're
[25:24] doing right there's a cost there's a tax
[25:26] there's something that can happen to the
[25:27] individual so be sure that if you're
[25:29] spending be sure that if you're being
[25:31] spent be sure that if there's some loss
[25:33] you're doing it for something that is
[25:34] the ultimate gain and you're not
[25:36] throwing everything away for something
[25:38] that's not worth it
[25:40] paul could come to the end of his
[25:41] ministry in 2nd timothy chapter 4 verse
[25:43] 7 say i have fought
[25:45] a good fight
[25:47] i have finished my course i have kept
[25:51] the faith
[25:52] the christian life is a fight
[25:57] strife against sin
[25:59] the world the flesh and the devil
[26:02] even though our present dominion are
[26:04] over those things we find to have
[26:05] dominion there's a fight
[26:09] we have a fight with earth and hell
[26:10] while we're on earth
[26:14] it might seem to be peculiar to think of
[26:15] it that way but the christian life
[26:18] having received the holy ghost there's
[26:20] still a fight
[26:22] in ephesians chapter 2 verse 6 and
[26:24] speaking of christ and what he's done
[26:26] for us in such uh a beautiful picture
[26:29] and hath raised us up together
[26:32] and made us sit together in heavenly
[26:33] places in christ jesus
[26:35] what what a beautiful sounding place to
[26:38] be
[26:38] we've been raised up to sit together
[26:40] where are you sitting in heavenly places
[26:43] right in heavenly places we could just
[26:44] hear the heart plan
[26:46] we feel the gentle breeze we we get a
[26:49] vision of paradise and all the luxuries
[26:51] and all the amenities and at least all
[26:52] the spiritual benefits that come with
[26:54] heaven yes we've been raised up seated
[26:56] together in heavenly places in christ
[26:58] jesus on the right hand of power we we
[27:01] could see all these things that come
[27:03] with that image of being raised up right
[27:06] raised up into heavenly places but this
[27:08] isn't a place to sit and knees around
[27:11] we're not elevated to relax but elevated
[27:13] to fight
[27:15] there's this to be raised up to be
[27:17] seated together in heavenly places in
[27:19] christ jesus there's actually you could
[27:21] say it in this way and you'll see it may
[27:23] be brought out by brother branham
[27:25] to a better degree here in a moment but
[27:27] beforehand there's no fight
[27:30] hey you're just going with the world
[27:33] wherever the world wants to take you you
[27:34] might you might act like you're fighting
[27:37] but there's really no fight
[27:39] but now that you've been raised up to
[27:41] sit together in heavenly places in
[27:42] christ jesus it's a promotion
[27:45] to the boxing ring
[27:47] it's a promotion to an arena of fighting
[27:50] because paul says this in ephesians
[27:52] chapter six remember this the image i've
[27:53] been raised up
[27:55] now in ephesians chapter six verse ten
[27:57] finally my brother and be strong in the
[27:58] lord and the power of his might
[28:00] put on the whole armor of god
[28:02] oh but you forgot paul
[28:04] i've been raised up in the heavenly
[28:06] places with christ jesus
[28:08] i i put my armor down
[28:10] did i sound like joel osteen
[28:12] i'm not using it anymore
[28:15] right but no you put your whole armor on
[28:17] that you may be able to stand against
[28:19] the wiles of the devil
[28:21] for we wrestle
[28:23] we wrestle
[28:25] this is a place of resting this is the
[28:27] place of fighting this is a place of
[28:28] struggling we wrestle not against flesh
[28:31] and blood but against principalities
[28:33] against powers against the rulers of
[28:35] darkness of this world against spiritual
[28:37] wickedness in
[28:39] high places
[28:41] you've been raised up
[28:45] to fight spiritual weakness in high
[28:47] places if you could have just stayed
[28:49] down here you would have never had to
[28:50] fight
[28:51] but you've been raised up to a place of
[28:53] warfare a place of battle wherefore
[28:55] because you've been raised up and now
[28:57] you're in this arena at the right hand
[28:59] of power this is a place where god is
[29:01] conquering a place where god is going to
[29:03] have dominion a place where god is going
[29:04] to drive away every fear every doubt and
[29:07] every imperfection in your life then you
[29:10] have to ready yourself for the for the
[29:12] battle
[29:14] and now you've taken yourself the whole
[29:15] armor of god that you may be able to
[29:16] withstand in the evil day and having
[29:19] done all
[29:20] to stand
[29:21] then we stand therefore and then he goes
[29:23] through the description of the
[29:24] believer's armor
[29:25] so you've been raised up but you
[29:26] actually been raised up to the
[29:27] battlefield
[29:30] a place of warfare
[29:33] brother branham in the sermon doors in
[29:34] door he says i like a man of vision he's
[29:37] talking about abraham lincoln
[29:38] he says i like people that's got
[29:40] something they are fighting for
[29:42] just not
[29:43] just lay around well
[29:46] ever what comes along will be all right
[29:49] can we think about that for just a
[29:50] moment
[29:52] just whatever comes along will be all
[29:54] right
[29:55] how many times have we translated faith
[29:57] to be that
[29:59] well
[30:00] just whatever happens happens
[30:02] i'll just take it as it comes
[30:04] and there's a point at which
[30:06] that's not faith you just don't care
[30:10] that's not faith you don't have enough
[30:12] faith to fight
[30:14] you're not just willing to accept any
[30:15] outcome you're actually in doubt that
[30:18] god will fight your battle so you're
[30:19] afraid to take a stand listen i'm not
[30:22] trying to be mean to you and you came
[30:24] all the way out here for church tonight
[30:25] and i want you to gut check and think
[30:26] about it that there's got to come a
[30:28] point to where you want it enough to
[30:30] fight for it and not just like well i
[30:32] guess it doesn't really matter well
[30:34] let's just take that to the nth degree
[30:36] okay let's just say well whatever
[30:37] matters i don't care if i'm saved or not
[30:39] well it doesn't really matter if my wife
[30:41] loves me doesn't really matter if my
[30:42] children serve god well whatever happens
[30:44] let's just go ahead and take that and
[30:46] run it through to the nth degree and
[30:48] find out that there is an attitude
[30:50] that's more indicative of fear or just
[30:53] spiritual laziness than it is faith
[30:56] because he says i like people that have
[30:58] something to fight for and just don't
[31:00] lay around and just take whatever comes
[31:02] he says all be up and at it
[31:05] and lincoln never did let his education
[31:07] stand in the way he had to do something
[31:09] i think every christian ought to be that
[31:11] way find your purpose and go do it
[31:15] this attitude that we seem to take
[31:17] sometimes i think it's a real a real
[31:19] challenge to
[31:20] our young people in the message because
[31:22] we hear about election and
[31:23] predestination so they get to the point
[31:25] where they think they understand it
[31:26] enough to say well if i'm elected to it
[31:27] it's just going to happen
[31:30] yep i guess i mean i can't save myself i
[31:32] can't get the holy ghost myself if it's
[31:34] just gonna happen it's gonna happen well
[31:36] you you can choose just how bad it's
[31:38] gonna be for you to come
[31:41] you may not have any choice in being a
[31:43] son of god but you can have a choice
[31:44] over how
[31:46] of things in your life
[31:49] and he says there's got to come a point
[31:50] where you're willing to fight for it
[31:52] that if you really believe it and you
[31:53] really want it say no
[31:55] god if you don't come you're going to
[31:56] find a bag of bones here
[31:59] not come up to the altar and say well
[32:02] i guess if you're going to give it to me
[32:03] you'll give it to me 54321 nope didn't
[32:05] get it and go sit down
[32:10] luke 13 24
[32:12] strive to enter
[32:14] in at the straight gate for many i said
[32:16] you will seek to enter in and shall not
[32:18] be able
[32:19] so he says strive to enter
[32:21] this is a labor fervently
[32:24] there's no ho-hum to us contend struggle
[32:28] to enter fight to enter strive to enter
[32:30] the straight gate for many will say unto
[32:32] you many i say will seek to enter in and
[32:35] shall not be able they'll seek but do
[32:37] they strive
[32:41] we kind of maybe have a little bit of a
[32:42] joke in the house that if something's
[32:44] lost we'll say did you look for it let's
[32:45] say yeah you look for it and then you
[32:46] find it it's just right out in the open
[32:48] so we just kind of say yeah you looked
[32:50] for it right
[32:51] you just kind of glanced but did you you
[32:53] may say you sought it but did you strive
[32:56] labor fervently
[32:59] why because we have to fight the good
[33:00] fight of faith
[33:01] i like people that's got something
[33:03] they're fighting for
[33:05] in second corinthians chapter 10 verses
[33:06] 3
[33:07] and 4 says for though we walk in the
[33:09] flesh
[33:10] i cut the slide down a little bit for
[33:11] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[33:13] war after the flesh for the weapons of
[33:15] our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[33:17] through god to the pulling down of
[33:18] strongholds
[33:20] we may walk in the flesh and as you walk
[33:23] in the flesh you may never go to boot
[33:25] camp you never may enlist in the armed
[33:27] services you may never actually get into
[33:29] a fight where you're throwing fists
[33:31] you may never catch hands in a grocery
[33:34] store
[33:36] but you wore
[33:39] even though it may not be after the
[33:40] flesh you will war
[33:41] and he says the weapons of our warfare
[33:43] we may walk in the flesh but we do not
[33:45] war after the flesh but the weapons of
[33:47] our warfare are not carnal this warfare
[33:49] that we are entered into may not be a
[33:50] war of words it may not be a war of
[33:52] hands but is a warfare and in this
[33:54] warfare striving with spiritual things
[33:57] and ideologies and
[33:59] and things that may not be seen we have
[34:01] weapons in this warfare that are
[34:03] powerful and mighty through god to the
[34:06] pulling down of strongholds
[34:07] there's a lot that you could take from
[34:09] that and this fighting the good fight of
[34:11] faith but i just make reference to show
[34:12] you that the scripture is very clear we
[34:14] war we fight
[34:18] brother brahms asked the question in
[34:19] question and answers
[34:21] in 61 is this question 165 he says is it
[34:24] possible for a holy ghost-filled person
[34:25] to be driven to do minor things
[34:28] influence to do minor things that he
[34:29] doesn't want to do
[34:32] anybody want to take a shot at this one
[34:35] it's a very interesting question
[34:37] i like the way that it's written
[34:38] is it possible for a holy ghost filled
[34:40] person
[34:41] be driven to do minor things that he
[34:43] doesn't want to do
[34:46] you know the answer
[34:48] oh yes
[34:49] yes sir yeah
[34:52] he's just making sure he catches
[34:53] everybody like right
[34:54] you know just the adults oh yes the
[34:56] formal yes sir and then the young people
[34:58] yeah
[35:00] right we're all kind of caught in this
[35:04] oh yes yes sir yeah a holy ghost-filled
[35:07] person you are right in the place to be
[35:10] drove by those things
[35:12] this is not for justification this is
[35:14] for this is for liberation
[35:16] this is that we would not be in bondage
[35:18] he says you just put yourself up a
[35:20] target
[35:21] i i i we're we're moving very quickly
[35:23] towards the close tonight so if you came
[35:25] to get something you haven't got
[35:26] anything yet time to maybe enter in
[35:29] and just uh really go ahead and fight
[35:31] for this service at this very moment
[35:33] since you're right in the place to be
[35:34] drove by these things you just put
[35:36] yourself up a target when you're down
[35:38] there serving the devil he just lets you
[35:40] slouch around any way you want to
[35:44] you thought he was pushing you driving
[35:46] you and beating you up to do it no he
[35:48] was letting you do whatever you wanted
[35:51] to do but once you take a stand for
[35:54] christ you've gone on the other side
[35:57] then he trains every gun right around on
[36:00] you
[36:01] every temptation everything that could
[36:03] be thrown to you then you got it but
[36:05] what have you got greater is he that is
[36:07] in you than he that is in the world
[36:10] notice how beautifully he puts this now
[36:12] you weren't in the battle here you was
[36:14] just slopping along
[36:16] i know you thought when you're in the
[36:17] world man i was just really fighting i
[36:19] was just really struggling you know what
[36:21] you're fighting against your election
[36:24] i was really fighting i was really
[36:26] struggling man i was really striving and
[36:28] i was just no you would the devil was
[36:30] doing whatever he wanted to you or you
[36:32] were just doing whatever you wanted who
[36:33] what you were fighting it says not the
[36:34] devil but the very call of god in your
[36:36] life
[36:37] this is something that young people
[36:39] sometimes need to take a step back and
[36:40] recognize i say young people but even us
[36:42] as adults we're fighting with a decision
[36:44] we're fighting with something we know
[36:45] we're fighting something we don't know
[36:47] and we really got our fists up and we're
[36:48] really fighting we're really struggling
[36:50] and we think we're giving the devil a
[36:51] black eye and we're actually wrestling
[36:54] against the will of god and wrestling
[36:56] against the call of god and wrestling
[36:58] against the very thing we know we ought
[37:00] to do
[37:08] he says
[37:09] you weren't in a battle here you're just
[37:10] slopping along but now you've cleaned up
[37:12] you've dressed up you've shaved
[37:14] you've combed your hair you put on a
[37:16] uniform
[37:17] it's in a spiritual sense
[37:19] you've got a gun in your hand
[37:22] there's a lot of us republicans that
[37:24] like that
[37:27] he says let's go
[37:28] you're in battle not to show off but to
[37:31] fight fight
[37:33] sure when the temptations rise with the
[37:35] spirit and the shield of faith buckle
[37:37] off and move on that's right oh put on
[37:39] the whole armor of god
[37:42] he says why do you put on armor if
[37:44] you're not going to fight
[37:47] all soldiers are dressed to fight not to
[37:51] show off did i get the okay when i was
[37:53] putting this court and it was so long i
[37:54] think i was afraid i chopped it up why
[37:56] do you put on armor if you're not going
[37:57] to fight all soldiers are dressed to
[38:00] fight not to show off
[38:03] walk out and say i'm so and so sounds
[38:05] like that condescending cactus
[38:07] i'm so and so now i'm a christian see
[38:09] who i am i belong to so and so
[38:11] hallelujah i got the holy ghost the
[38:13] other night sure nothing bothers me
[38:15] anymore
[38:16] oh brother i believe you better go back
[38:19] and try again
[38:21] oh i'm telling you when as soon as you
[38:24] say you got the holy ghost satan's got
[38:26] every gun right on you shooting you
[38:30] then you got the whole arm run then you
[38:31] take the shield of faith the sword of
[38:33] the spirit of the word and shod yourself
[38:35] with the gospel and take the old middle
[38:36] piece here the breastplate and pull pull
[38:38] up the cinch on it and tighten yourself
[38:40] up a little bit and get ready for it
[38:42] because it's a coming
[38:45] don't you worry yes sir you're going to
[38:47] have plenty of trouble
[38:49] but remember greater is he that's in you
[38:51] than he that is in the world
[38:54] you're in a battle not to show up but
[38:56] the fight
[39:04] when we entered the body of christ
[39:07] you were called to fight
[39:10] called to fight not faint
[39:13] we know that entering in the baptism of
[39:15] the holy ghost
[39:17] is a type of the promised land
[39:19] and numbers chapter 33 verses 52 and 53
[39:22] he says this is god now speaking to the
[39:24] children of israel they're going to be
[39:25] entered in entering into the land of
[39:28] milk and honey right they're going to be
[39:31] entering into home
[39:33] but they'd have to fight for it
[39:36] then you shall drive out all the
[39:37] inhabitants of the land from before you
[39:39] and destroy all their pictures and
[39:41] destroy all their molten images and
[39:43] quite pluck down all their high places
[39:45] and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants
[39:47] of the land and dwelt there and for i
[39:49] have given you the land to possess it
[39:52] did god not say that he would drive them
[39:54] out from before them but who was god
[39:56] going to use to drive them out from
[39:57] before them them
[39:59] and they were going to drive out all the
[40:01] inhabitants destroy all their pictures
[40:03] destroy all their molten images quite
[40:05] pluck down all their high places and
[40:07] dispossess the inhabitants of the land
[40:09] they were going to have to put footsteps
[40:11] to the promise they weren't going to be
[40:13] able to just sit outside the promised
[40:14] land and kind of peek around and just
[40:16] wait for god to drive them all out but
[40:18] they were going to have to step forward
[40:20] and as they stepped forward because god
[40:22] said look i'm not going to drive them
[40:23] all out at once but as you grow and
[40:25] increase and you exhibit the maturity
[40:27] and the fortitude and the perseverance
[40:30] to claim every promise then i'll push
[40:32] them out but if you only come in so far
[40:35] and you don't make a step to possess
[40:36] every inch they're gonna they're gonna
[40:38] stay right there but as soon as you make
[40:41] an affirmative step of faith that that's
[40:43] my land i'm gonna possess it your act of
[40:45] faith god would go before you and drive
[40:48] them out but if you're just sitting
[40:50] there waiting for something to happen
[40:52] it's never gonna happen oh i guess just
[40:54] whatever happens happens no you have to
[40:57] fight for it
[41:00] it was home
[41:01] but they'd have to fight for it
[41:04] brother brown branham in question and
[41:05] answers in 59 says canaan is not a type
[41:08] of the millennium because they had wars
[41:10] fightings killings and everything else
[41:12] in canaan so you've been raised up
[41:15] seated in heavenly places in christ
[41:16] jesus
[41:18] but now that you've been raised up you
[41:19] can do battle with spiritual wickedness
[41:22] in high places
[41:24] they're not looking down on you but you
[41:25] can see them eye to eye through the word
[41:26] he says that type the holy canaan is a
[41:28] type of the holy ghost egypt's the world
[41:30] that they come out of the wilderness is
[41:32] where they were sanctified called out
[41:33] church canaan is where they settled down
[41:35] with the holy spirit because they still
[41:37] had
[41:38] wars
[41:39] anybody that says they got the holy
[41:41] ghost and nothing bothers them anymore
[41:42] he says you better go back and try again
[41:45] and that's scary
[41:47] to think that you've had some experience
[41:48] where nothing bothers you anymore and
[41:50] it's the wrong one
[41:53] i had something to think about
[41:56] they still have wars and if you don't
[41:58] believe
[42:00] and if you don't believe you have wars
[42:02] just get the holy spirit once
[42:05] what are you doing what do they do in
[42:07] canaan they were possessing their rights
[42:10] they were possessing their rights and
[42:11] they could not possess their rights till
[42:13] they got into canaan they didn't own
[42:15] nothing in the wilderness
[42:18] all the confession all it's our land
[42:20] it's our land it's our land all the
[42:21] promises every promise in the book is
[42:23] mine it's mine it's mine it's mine they
[42:24] didn't own they didn't own nothing in
[42:25] the wilderness then when you come into
[42:27] canaan they had rights then they had
[42:30] rights and we've got rights when you
[42:33] receive the holy ghost you are in canaan
[42:35] you have to fight for it every inch of
[42:38] ground you have to fight for it
[42:42] that's what you have to do don't stand
[42:44] on the sidelines don't stand on the
[42:46] outside of the arena just asking god to
[42:48] do it for you and do this and do that
[42:50] there's got to be something in your
[42:52] heart that tells you i need to step
[42:54] forward in faith believing knowing that
[42:56] greater is he that is in me don't meet
[42:59] the devil on his ground don't run after
[43:02] something and fight for something that's
[43:04] not worth fighting for but if you can
[43:06] recognize the promise of god it's worth
[43:08] it to face it and step forward into it
[43:14] i know that mature believers can accept
[43:16] this i hope you can catch the
[43:18] catch it in the right spirit
[43:22] if you're going to be in a war
[43:25] fighting over some principle make sure
[43:26] it's the right thing
[43:30] and he says if you don't believe there's
[43:31] wars get the holy ghost one time
[43:34] he says then you have to fight for it
[43:37] if i could even say this
[43:39] i know this maybe it
[43:41] opens up a large thought
[43:42] but you have to surrender to get the
[43:44] holy ghost
[43:46] right
[43:46] right this is again it's the paradox
[43:49] seek him with your whole heart then
[43:50] you'll find him but there's a surrender
[43:52] and there's a dying out there's a
[43:53] letting go to get it
[43:54] then once you get it
[43:56] you're raised up to fight
[43:58] but now greater is he that is in you
[43:59] than he that is in the world
[44:01] brother said a real christian fights for
[44:02] his position he has to stand alone him
[44:05] and god and he fights every inch of
[44:07] ground so you don't have to baby them
[44:08] around
[44:10] a real christian fights for his position
[44:12] even if it's alone
[44:13] i know we seem to find uh there there's
[44:16] a there's a part of us
[44:18] that takes comfort in knowing that if
[44:20] we're wrong there's a lot of other
[44:21] people who are wrong too
[44:23] right
[44:24] it's kind of the whole principle that's
[44:25] built mcdonald's is built around
[44:27] you know four billion people served
[44:29] and you're like well
[44:31] numbers don't mean anything at that
[44:32] point
[44:33] but there's there's an id there's a
[44:35] psychology to the crowd there's a
[44:37] psychology to knowing misery loves
[44:38] company and and i'm miserable where i am
[44:41] but at least there's a lot of other
[44:42] people who are just as miserable as i am
[44:44] and because you know what take someone
[44:45] with faith to say i'm not happy being
[44:47] miserable in a crowd i'd rather be happy
[44:50] and all alone
[44:52] i'd rather fight for my position stand
[44:54] alone with god fight for every inch of
[44:55] ground so you don't have to baby them
[44:57] around
[44:58] wherever i was talking i was actually
[45:00] talking about coming to phoenix to
[45:01] preach a meeting that oral roberts i
[45:03] wasn't able to come and preach him
[45:04] saying he was going to be taking the
[45:05] campaign on his own brother man says i
[45:07] realize that every time faith sets
[45:10] itself up the devil turns every gun in
[45:12] hell right on it like that
[45:15] not going to be easy when you step
[45:16] forward to do something that god wants
[45:18] you to do it's not going to be easy to
[45:19] apply the token to your home it's not
[45:20] going to be easy to take the path that
[45:22] you feel that god is wanting you to take
[45:24] but it's something we're fighting for
[45:28] i'll try to run through this quickly
[45:30] just touch on a few scriptures here
[45:33] he said i'll drive them out destroy
[45:36] their pictures destroy their molten
[45:37] images quite pluck down all their high
[45:38] places dispossess the inhabitants of the
[45:40] land
[45:41] but the man said i had to fight for
[45:43] every inch of ground
[45:44] a christian fights for his position
[45:46] as soon as faith sets itself up the
[45:48] devil turns every gun and hell on it
[45:50] right like that
[45:51] so when you come into the promised land
[45:52] it's a place of fighting in war
[45:55] so the book of judges has to come a time
[45:56] when it the children of israel had to be
[45:58] reminded in judges chapter 3 verse 2
[46:00] only that the generations of the
[46:01] children of israel might know to teach
[46:03] them war
[46:05] at the least such as before knew nothing
[46:07] thereof
[46:09] they had stopped fighting
[46:11] they didn't know what war was like they
[46:14] didn't know what it was like to fight
[46:16] but they still had to know
[46:18] teach them the war
[46:20] to be trained in battle
[46:22] to learn to engage in battle not to run
[46:24] from but to know what it looks like to
[46:25] know what it feels like wage war know
[46:27] how to use a weapon
[46:29] face the fight don't run away
[46:32] the bible says in exodus that the lord
[46:34] is a man of war
[46:38] this is this is part of his essential
[46:40] characteristics god is love so god
[46:42] equals love and god is a man of war
[46:45] right they say all's fair in love and
[46:47] war love is war and some of us said amen
[46:51] but lord is a man of war he prepares his
[46:54] people for war he he teaches them how to
[46:57] dress themselves for a fight he he
[46:59] teaches them how to handle a weapon
[47:03] brother branham is drilling down on it
[47:04] what would he give you armor for if he
[47:05] didn't want you to fight
[47:07] what would he give you a sword for so
[47:10] you can make fried green tomato
[47:11] sandwiches with it
[47:13] it's one of the worst things to try to
[47:14] cut with a bad knife as a tomato
[47:17] but he gives you a sword to fight
[47:20] psalms 144 verses 1 and 2 blessed be the
[47:23] lord my strength which teacheth my hands
[47:27] to war in my fingers to fight
[47:30] my goodness and my fortress my high
[47:31] tower my deliver my shield and he and
[47:33] whom i trust who subdueth my people
[47:36] under me and though he's the subduer
[47:38] though greater is he that is in you than
[47:39] he that is in the world they're still
[47:41] hands that need to be taught to fight
[47:43] and fingers how to fight
[47:46] you've got to know how to fight in this
[47:48] he's your goodness your fortress you're
[47:49] italian you're delivered he's your
[47:51] shield he's the one in whom you're
[47:52] resting and trusting but he's the same
[47:54] one that gives you strength and teaches
[47:57] your hands the war and your fingers to
[47:59] fight
[48:00] amen
[48:01] i know some of you are thinking that
[48:02] that's this
[48:04] well i'll show them
[48:06] all right
[48:08] two thumbed warriors
[48:10] or maybe you just swipe whatever it is
[48:12] that's not what he's talking about
[48:14] brother graham said the message greatest
[48:15] battle ever fought an army first is
[48:17] getting ready for a battle first it's
[48:18] got to select some soldiers
[48:22] they've got to be dressed for fighting
[48:24] they've got to be trained for fighting
[48:26] there's a large thought there and he
[48:28] says and i believe that the greatest
[48:29] battle that ever was fought is now ready
[48:31] to go in action
[48:32] i believe that god has been selecting
[48:34] his soldiers
[48:35] i believe he's been dressing them
[48:37] training them and the battlefront is now
[48:40] set getting ready to start
[48:43] the greatest battle ever fought
[48:49] in psalms 18 34 he teacheth my hands to
[48:51] war
[48:52] so that
[48:54] a boat still is broken by my
[48:57] arms
[49:00] he can teach you how to fight so that
[49:02] even a boa still is broken in your arms
[49:05] he's dressing us for fighting and
[49:07] training us for fighting the lord my
[49:09] strength who teaches my hands to war and
[49:10] teaches my fingers to fight he will
[49:12] teach my hands to war so that i can
[49:15] break a bow of steel
[49:18] brother ma'am continuing in the greatest
[49:19] battle ever fought god's training for
[49:21] this great battle
[49:22] matthew 24 and also daniel 12 and
[49:24] there'd be a time of troubles that's
[49:26] never like on the earth before and we
[49:27] are living in that time when culture and
[49:29] education and things have smothered over
[49:32] the word of god and got into reasoning
[49:34] and so forth the battle is now who will
[49:36] stand hallelujah the battle is ready to
[49:39] go in she's in array now
[49:42] the battle is down he says who will
[49:44] stand
[49:45] he expresses it in other ways who will
[49:47] draw their swords with me
[49:50] who will who will stand shoulder to
[49:52] shoulder
[49:57] just maybe bear with me a little bit
[49:59] i'm not necessarily getting into part
[50:01] two
[50:02] but why is it so easy to fight against
[50:04] each other and we don't ever want to
[50:05] fight the devil
[50:08] i know we're talking about the neighbors
[50:08] in the apartment next door but think
[50:10] about it why is it so easy to go at one
[50:12] another
[50:14] and go toe to toe with another professed
[50:16] believer but we never want to fight for
[50:18] the devil we never we never want to
[50:20] fight against unbelief we don't ever
[50:22] fight against sin we find it so easy to
[50:24] go at one another but not stand shoulder
[50:26] to shoulder as we ought to and fight for
[50:30] things that are worth fighting for
[50:33] so we expressed on sunday morning
[50:35] putting our shoulder to the will to cry
[50:38] out against darkness so the battle is
[50:41] now who will stand
[50:44] i think i put those three things but
[50:46] john if you want to put them up i'll
[50:47] read the quote but just
[50:49] this is the gut check now let us all
[50:51] tonight check our desires
[50:53] then you can see what kind of filthy
[50:54] you've been drawing through
[50:56] let's check each one of us here and out
[50:58] across the nation check your desires
[51:02] what you really want in life
[51:04] check what you're fighting for
[51:08] check what you're here for
[51:12] check what you go to church for
[51:15] oh there's times in life when you're
[51:17] like nope
[51:18] right
[51:19] you just you don't want to fight
[51:21] you don't have anything to do with it
[51:23] you just you back out of it nope
[51:25] this is not the time this is not the
[51:27] place you know you're you're just kind
[51:28] of going to the grocery store and some
[51:30] someone you catch eyes with somebody
[51:32] that you look at me oh
[51:34] no
[51:35] no i'm blind actually
[51:37] where are you who was talking
[51:39] right you don't want none of it you're
[51:41] not you don't want to fight
[51:44] listen it's not going to work christian
[51:47] it's not going to work believer
[51:49] he says what are you here for
[51:52] you you have to realize that whether you
[51:55] wanted one or not you're in a fight
[51:57] and you got to ask yourself what am i
[51:58] fighting for
[52:00] am i fighting for the right thing
[52:02] what am i here for am i where am i what
[52:05] am i doing and then even as he says what
[52:07] are you going to church for
[52:09] are you just going to church he says
[52:10] it's fine to go to church but that's not
[52:12] what saves you
[52:14] it's gut check
[52:16] time it's a time for us to to to think
[52:20] about the principle we're checking my
[52:22] desires what i want in life and if i'm
[52:25] if i'm fighting is it going to get me
[52:27] what really matters and what really
[52:28] counts
[52:30] i shared just quickly with sister
[52:32] elizabeth on what i was preaching
[52:33] tonight and she said well it's just like
[52:35] our family vision
[52:37] and we have a kind of a family motto a
[52:39] family uh uh saying that it's rapture or
[52:42] bust
[52:43] that that's what we want we we want a
[52:45] rapture for our family that's why we've
[52:47] made decisions that we've made in life
[52:49] it's why we've traveled the road that
[52:50] we've traveled is we realize that if you
[52:52] want to make it to a grave any road will
[52:55] get you there if you just want to find
[52:57] yourself holding on in the end and and
[52:59] living for a funeral then just about any
[53:02] way will get you there but if what you
[53:03] really want for yourself and for your
[53:05] family is a rapture then you're gonna
[53:07] have to make harder decisions you're
[53:09] gonna have to start fighting you've got
[53:10] to pick up the sword and i realize that
[53:12] if you want a body change you're going
[53:14] to have to fight for it
[53:16] you can't just lay around and just
[53:18] pretend it's going to happen you have to
[53:19] make hard decisions and fight for it
[53:22] and that's what i'm challenging you to
[53:23] do tonight fight for it
[53:28] fight for it
[53:29] if you're fighting what are you fighting
[53:30] for
[53:32] he said i'm just fighting i'm just going
[53:33] through it i'm just battling what are
[53:34] you fighting for who are you fighting
[53:35] against what's it all
[53:40] about fight for it
[53:43] is it worth is it something we're
[53:44] fighting for
[53:46] you did that for that
[53:48] you called them that because of that and
[53:50] you fought them for that and you did you
[53:52] did this at the end of it yeah just for
[53:53] that when they're like that's petty oh
[53:56] yeah
[53:57] i think in a way that's kind of what
[53:58] brother brahms is hitting at check your
[54:00] desires what do you really want in life
[54:02] brother brandman two places talk about
[54:04] going to war he talks about his brothers
[54:05] that were in war and he said if there's
[54:06] another war he'd do it himself
[54:09] he'd go to war himself he said this is
[54:10] the greatest nation there is under the
[54:12] heavens
[54:13] i'm glad to be an american that's right
[54:15] and if it's worth anything it's worth
[54:17] fighting for it's worth standing by
[54:20] you're asking yourself
[54:22] what am i fighting for
[54:24] he says in another place if this country
[54:26] ain't worth fighting for it ain't worth
[54:27] living in
[54:30] think about that
[54:31] if it's not worth fighting for it's not
[54:33] worth living in is what you're living in
[54:37] worth fighting for
[54:39] ask yourself if the condition you're
[54:41] living in if the place you're living in
[54:43] if the standard you're living at if what
[54:46] you have isn't worth living in is it
[54:48] worth fighting in
[54:50] because he says anything worth fighting
[54:52] if it ain't worth fighting for it ain't
[54:54] worth living in
[54:55] he said well i may be in a particular
[54:57] condition but would you be willing to
[54:58] fight to stay in it and if you're not
[55:00] willing to fight to stay in it it's not
[55:02] worth it to stay there so i'm
[55:04] challenging you as a believer tonight if
[55:06] you're in a place that's not worth
[55:08] fighting for fight to get out of it
[55:11] strive to find the place that you ought
[55:13] to be desire to find another level with
[55:16] god and say lord i don't want to just
[55:18] lay around anymore i just don't want to
[55:20] take it easy if lifting me up into
[55:23] heavenly places means i've got to fight
[55:25] the devil but at least there i'll know
[55:27] greater is he that is in me than he that
[55:29] is in the world
[55:31] and that's a place worth fighting for
[55:35] fight for saints
[55:37] god bless you let's stand together
