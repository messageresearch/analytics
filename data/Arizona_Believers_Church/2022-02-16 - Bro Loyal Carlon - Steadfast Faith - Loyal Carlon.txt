TRANSCRIPT
========================================
lord i want to jump into this uh quote uh perseverant 1962 if it would be called a text i would like to take one word for a text and that is the word perseverance of course brother aaron brought this into the sermon the other day as well perseverance webster says it's to be persistent persistent in making a goal to do something to be perseverant is to persist and before you can be persistent you have to have an idea what you're being persistent about and men through all ages that's ever tried to achieve something has been persistent man in order to be persistent my quota gwen again is to know what you are after and if you do not know you're not certain of your standing but when you thoroughly understand what it is what you're after and are satisfied you're going to do it then you can be persistent get really persistent holding on they know where they're standing it starts with knowing where you're standing you can't be persistent with faith until you know where you're standing how do you know where you're standing we can talk a little bit about i'm going to just jump right down to this part i was going to go into a lot of other stuff we're going to just skim down how do you know that you're standing you have to be able to run it through the bible you have to be able to run it through the bible brother branham often talked about how that he almost types the bible with not almost he does type the bible to a body the body doesn't have an offshoot that just doesn't connect back into itself everything is circular it's a network and i want to throw this up here is this idea of a single source of truth and i apologize brother john we're going to be jumping around a lot tonight single source of truth a single source of truth is the practice of aggregating the data from many systems within an organization to a single location is this super exciting very exciting becomes accessible via a single reference point ensures decisions based on same data throughout an organization and it's for when an employee needs only one right answer and eliminates friction concerning which number sources stats and data to rely on so in an organization the idea is you have a singular uh outlet a singular place where all of the information must be brought back to be measured against i might have an idea over here i might have some new information and we can bring it in in a sense but it is going to be filtered through a single source of truth and why what how is it decided that what is a single source of truth that's ultimately up to an organization we're talking about something that's beyond just an organization bring up the slide the uh the colorful picture this is the bible this has been done there's a massive spreadsheet on this that i can send to you guys it did not go and count exactly how many there were but the spreadsheet is massive the bible itself is a network it is a self-reinforced cross-referenced network it is itself a single source of truth it validates itself by the repetitive internal references to itself it is continuous you have in the in the old testament is constantly foreshadowing something that is to come and it is constantly by by prophecy and then by documentation there were people at that time that were documenting you look at chronicles you look at samuel they were documenting this actually occurred and they're validating that this happened and then you look into the new testament where it's referencing back that this was that that they that they spoke about then and they're connecting the dots it becomes a single source of truth brother branham preached the sermon the absolute he used the terminology that people could understand at that time and it's the exact same thing it becomes a measuring stick by which everything else must be measured the problem becomes this chord's not long enough for me the problem becomes is when you get a random offshoot that doesn't connect back in it doesn't it doesn't have any sighting it doesn't have any references it's not it's not going back into a continuous story it's no longer alive if you look at it when someone gets cancer if you get a cancer it is effectively a new life source that's trying to grow inside of your body it is trying to do something that's why you can find hair and teeth and all kinds of random stuff inside of a cancer it is try it is a life source that is living off of the original life source but it doesn't add to this life source it is actually taking away from it and if you look at it you can measure this down into denominationalism into spiritualism into many different ideas that not many all different ideas they always end up not going back to the source at some point they may have a lot of validation through the bible they're like yup this this this and this but eventually they will cut off a part of it they will cut off a part of it so it's no longer continuous you can go ahead and close that down the bible has a single source of truth you have to know where you're standing and the only place that we can have 100 certainty is in the word of god it is the only thing that we can actually rest and again we've heard many of these sermons before but i want i want you to listen and i appreciate i can hear i can tell appreciate you we can filter these things out so often if we've heard terms like faith or faith in the word of god we filter these terminologies out because we've heard it so many times but i i need you tonight i need you to put on your your thinking caps of faith tonight and to pull beyond there's a there's a thought that runs deep in this i believe it because god wouldn't have put it out of my heart if there wasn't a reason for us to go back over this so i'm trusting the lord for him to come tonight and i asked that you would preach with me tonight salvation is 1956 the interval and i'm going to just run through a lot of these some of them are very short and i can send you the quotes later salvation is lasts as long as faith lasts and divine healing lasts as long as faith lasts you that's got to experience 40 years ago forget you ever had that experience and go out of here tonight and say i don't even believe in it and i'm not god's servant no more watch how long your experience lasts certainly so he's equating the actual reality of our existence to what we believe to what we believe quote uh from uh just jumping down to i actually i'm sorry i'll i'll send you this uh where this is from i've seen blinded standing on the platform not on this platform but could read that bible come back two days later someone whose eyes were blind and they were open come back two days later and couldn't see their hand before them they got among unbelievers when the unclean spirit's gone out of a man he walks in dry places returns back with seven other devils worse than he was if the good man of the house isn't standing there to protect that man then he will come in and by power overcome him but the good man of your house is faith to say god said so so he's talking about people so here's on one hand our our ex our existence the reality of our existence is connected to our faith and there are people who lose their reality based upon their association they started hanging out with unbelievers and i want to drill down here a little bit romans 14 23 and i'm just again going through some highlights laying some foundation 14 23 and he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin this is where brother branham drew the reference from sin is unbelief sin is unbelief and i'd like to also push this in there just a little bit that sin is also misbelief it is to believe it's not what it's not what you don't know it's what you know that just ain't so and so people getting around a person who misbelieves who believes something other than the truth to be true it skews our vision skews your vision and this is the real danger and it's the reason why we must come back to the source to validate by the truth to filter through the word of god what we no matter how good it sounds we're not called i'm going to go away from that we're going to continue on bring it back through to the word and now on their journey the children of israel power of god 55. they look out yonder and there's the red sea mountains on both sides and they lifted up their eyes and looked back and there come pharaoh with all of his army all of his trained soldiers his chariots and his captains each chariot and so forth here come a great cloud of dust while tens of thousands yes perhaps a million of or more armed men come they forgot what all faith had done for them a few days before that's what we do the first little pain hits us after you've been prayed for oh well i guess i lost it oh my and here come them and hear them coming to the platform been healed of cancer blinded eyes has been opened those who are lame walk again and all these things and we see it look at it examine it and go right on moving and then the first little conflict comes along and we forget all about it see and i'm just laying some foundation here of how we lose faith we lose the reality it's not that we're not saved that's the key thing it's not that you're not saved necessarily it's that we start to lose the the benefits the benefits of faith i want to isolate down to specifically talking about faith and the benefits of god's word just going through a few more things sometimes this is a very known thing and i i'm i'm why are we talking about this i've seen this very often and i've seen this among my friends very often and the young people and i i it it's unsettling to me that there are many who have been raised around christianity who have been raised around the tenets of faith but they've never really experienced god that's what we're talking about i'm i'm bringing this down to highlight some of these key points and get to the question of why what is going on here it's just running through a few god expectation 55 god only will honor faith even your salvation sometimes won't atone for your healing not the merits of your salvation you're not healed by that you're healed by the merit of your faith see i've seen christians come to the platform renowned christians and failed to be healed and see a prostitute walk on the platform be healed instantly see because the christian had been drugged through a many places and skeptic and kind of believing one more abraham is seated after him there's a dead woman buried there this great big place rubbed where they go there and rub it to keep plagues off the city this rock above this dead woman why certainly and things happen sure it's the approach the people think they're approaching god through that idol people think they're approaching god through the witch doctor and these people are approaching these idols and images and witch doctors and fortune tellers and all those different things like that they get healed because they have believed that through there they're approaching god and divine healing is based upon faith if you believe it now i'm not going to be careful here i'm i'm very much pro doctors most of my mom's side of the family is doctors i'm very pro anything that helps people and i think the word of god is pro anything that helps people but and this is again i'm just i'm just going to talk to you guys very honestly i look around and i've i've talked to i have more friends that left quote unquote christianity then stayed 90 i have counted since a young i've been paying attention and i've thought about this a lot and if you look and you go and you ask a lot of these people and and this is anywhere you go i've sat around the campfire and the coffee shop with a lot of different people who used to be christians and asked them why what's going on and if you look at it and not in a you need to get back to christ kind of way i think that that's very dangerous i think that that is the the absolute worst thing because the the rod of salvation quote unquote can absolutely beat someone to death if you're trying to go and you need to get like that's no absolutely not absolutely not but if you look at the the rationale behind many people who are reasonable people who are good people they start to question but i can get this over here they reattribute well you know i can go rub up my hand on this over here and i can get healed and this is a real thing this happens i can i can go to tony robbins and get most of what happens in the nominal church atmosphere it's the same anointing in a way you can go to a motivational seminar and it's effectively operating along the same lines but we're calling to something that goes beyond that there's nothing wrong with having faith in psychology to a point there's nothing wrong with having faith in doctors to a point there's nothing wrong with having faith in yourself to a point but there is a tipping point that you cannot it will fail you it will run its course it will eventually end and and we are looking for that distinction that dividing line to faith in god that we don't throw the baby out with a bath water it's like well because i can get my basic human needs looking over here that we just totally leave god off to the side follow with me faith how can i overcome 63 overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people say there is no devil it's just a thought it's just a thought you know it's funny like i i've studied a fair amount and there's a lot of great stuff there are a lot of great things that that i think are very important i think that a lot of people have gone through terrible things in their lives and i i don't think that i think though we must be careful because otherwise we do turn the devil into just a thought it's just a part of us it's just culture it's just society it's just my own negative attributes there is a real devil there is a real person of the devil it's not just a uh it's not just a hallucination it's not just a feeling there is a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is and that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace you are more than a match for him you can't say no careful you can't say i got a sickness and i i don't believe it is a sickness oh yes it is a sickness you got cancer you i i don't believe it is a cancer it is a cancer it is a cancer but remember greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world you must realize that the holy spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him i'm circling around something he's talking about denial there are there are it is a very we talk about in the in the last days that there will come we talk about all over in revelations that a strong delusion would come upon the earth a strong delusion and that delusion if you look at it a delusion is a belief or impression that is firmly maintained and it's not true it is believing it is actually believing something that's not true and i'm i'm bringing this quote in particular in into frame because if we're not careful and again having gone around the christianity circle we can take denial and masquerade it as faith that oh no no no i don't i don't have cancer the bible it is also written know the truth and the truth will set you free yes i am fight this is the thing i am dealing with the it is a cancer but greater is he that is within me than he that is in the word world we're locking down how do you have steadfast faith it is a satan is always trying to come to us with the word and get us just off just off of our footing it came to eve in the beginning if you look at it he only removed one word the word lord hath god said he removed one word and the moment eve says back to him god every passage in that point in the bible when man existed it was the lord god just removed the relationship between them and god that's all it was god is my lord there are benefits of having a lord he's my protector he's my provider he's not just some far away off distance person that i am i'm you know agility you know i'm just i'm reverencing who's way over there and i can't touch no he's my lord he's my savior he's my god my intimate friend today you've got to be sure that you're right you have to know where you're standing and the only way we can truly know is because we did all the math the only way we can truly know is because it felt really good man you know when they shouted i jumped out of my seat and i i love those things i love running the aisles i'm not preaching against that it's not based upon sensation and and i i'm just confessing for myself and many times over the years i've caught i've realized i have run into the trap of sensation it's so exciting it's so dude did you guys read that thing that was amazing it was so amazing is it true i don't know but it was amazing it was so i work in marketing this is my day job i write copy all day long guess what my job is to get people to say wow actually they don't even say wow they don't even know they're saying wow they just click the add to cart button that's all i want i want them to click the add to cart button that's my job i've got a friend so this is actually just a funny side story a friend of mine forgive me i'm gonna tell on him he he loves to evangelize brands for lack of a better word he'll come up and tell you everything about the new brand that he's into and why you should be into his that thing too like this is the only thing that does this thing and it was funny there was a particular product that he had told me about and what's amazing is he had told me with such enthusiasm i believe what he told me i was like wow this is the only one he's the only thing and i had this locked back in the back of my mind it's like this is the best one like you know whatever i'm doing is just must not be that great because he bought in and he sold it to me and he gave me all the right key you know data points and he told me i was like wow six months later i accidentally wound up i was doing some research and i ended up an ad was fed to me i ended up on the website for the same product and i looked at it and it dawned on me he had reiterated to me the copy that was on the website the exact copy almost word for word here i thought he'd like done the research and that everything was amazing i was like wow man he must really know he was reiterating exactly the copy that was on the site that had been spoon fed quite literally this is what i want you to believe about this product and satan does the same thing satan is a great marketer he is a great marketer he wants to get us to believe anything other than the truth to try to misrepresent a scripture or a quote or anything it doesn't even matter what it is anything that he can get wormed into our heads that's stuck in the back of our mouth via his word of mouth marketing campaign that he can lodge in the back of our mind that we believe to be true we believe that it's true and because we believe it we continue to act it out now really quick i want to make a key distinction there are lots of things that we acknowledge to be true that we do not believe to be true that's a very very very different thing the things that we believe we act out almost invisibly let's take this morning okay who here drank coffee this morning who here had caffeine of some kind this morning all right there we go why did we do that it's become unconscious to us at a level we almost don't even realize we are doing it it is we believe we will have more energy because we usually do sometimes it gives us you know we have too much and it's not good i do [Laughter] we believe but none of us is going around thinking man caffeine like that's the stuff you guys should get on caffeine like some people might okay there's coffee snobs we'll write them off the list i'm one of them i understand but the a distinction because we are actually acting out we we prove the value of it by what we do because we believe it similarly out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks it is going the things that we actually hold true we really do it's going to come out of our mouths it's going to come into our thinking because it's ju it is it is what is inside of us we can't help it we can't help it the good man of the house is our faith you can go back and read all the quotes it's not the holy ghost it's our faith brother branham talks about in enticing spirits you can go look it up you can be totally insane and still have the holy ghost totally insane that sounds crazy i'm sorry it sounds crazy that you could be full of the holy ghost and totally insane that means there's hope for me there's hope for you you know it's true it's not based upon the merit of how quote unquote good of a person i am on the outside it's based upon the what is the indwelling spirit in my heart and has that been quickened to me and you can measure that based upon the continual persistence the continual walking and striving towards god there is a desire in your heart that is beyond rationality beyond intellect beyond a conscious i believe that you know the lord jesus christ is my lord and savior that's a that is a belief that is calculated in the mind and professed but a belief is i must have god i must have god i must find him i must there there's a longing that you cannot fake that is somewhere deep inside of you and that is the driving force of your entire life and it will lead you into all truth it will lead you because you can't fake it there's no faking it till you make it it is there or it's not there is there is a a a force driving you that is real that is beyond something that again similar to coffee we're back on caffeine apparently i really like coffee back onto caffeine similar to this drive this pull this addiction addicted to god if you look if you look into the word it's actually amazing i love it when i saw this the word seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you that word means to crave it is to crave as if you have to have it i just gotta have it i know i'm on a diet but i gotta have it because we're gonna find a way to get this in it's okay i'll just do another workout i have to have it it is to crave and so we these are the things that we're talking about i'm making a separation between what is there and real and concrete faith is a substance it is a substance that you cannot you cannot measure its existence because it's unconscious but you can measure its results because it occurs it happens these signs shall follow them that believe it's not a hey joel i'm going to just come over you know i'm a believer so i'm going to lay my hands on you and i'm going to measure my belief by what happens to you there's a quote in here i'm just going to just go all over these i have way too many notes in here it's not based upon that brother branham talked about it i could pray for a thousand people tonight and every single one of them die and tomorrow i'm going to pray for another thousand people not because because i am not measuring it based upon my outcome per se i'm not basing it in this logical like i must not be a believer like no i'm taking god at his word and placing my faith in his word and acting out what god told me to do in sincerity from my heart from this driving force within me that has to have it i've got a need we've got a need and we're again the reason to talk about this is i i you see people who are afraid to really believe to take a scripture and say you know what just find one to take a scripture and say that scripture right there that's about me when god went you know when he was talking about jehovah jireh being our provider that he was talking about me not because i had a sensation when i read it and i was like i just flipped right open to the bible and there was that means it's for me it's like no it's for me because i see it and it says like there aren't any asterisks that says it's not for me so maybe it's for me and because i'm looking is this the word of god or is it not is it true or is it not okay if it's true and it doesn't exclude me from it that means that that scripture right there is for me and i can die on that scripture i can take that scripture and no matter what no matter what happens to me i can hold that as a sh in a strong hand of faith and resist anything that would come against that because i actually believe that scripture is for me but you have to actually believe not just a oh wow that's a great scripture and it's i'm going to stand in front of the mirror with my affirmations like these signs shall follow them that believe no it's to it is to take with god with a sincerity with with a an action and a purpose and an intention of god i don't understand this this word like this scripture right here it says that this is this is my this is a christian's right and i don't see it in my life reveal it to me reveal okay what am i doing is there something that i'm doing guide me show me lead me through this god is not a i will not be ashamed i've set my face like flint and i know god will back me up that is the the goal the is to get to that point where i can say with a certainty this scripture is for me it is for me and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what happens you look at jonah he goes to the belly of the whale we all know the story we've heard it a million times since we were little little kids the beautiful thing about that is jonah should have died i mean he's in the belly of a fish in the bottom of the ocean i mean he had pretty bad circumstances you know we could put any of our troubles that we go in there it's like man like i'm not my health is kind of falling apart or my i'm running out of money or you know i got anxiety oh my goodness you know all these different things and we start trying to think how am i gonna get out of this whale ah how are we gonna get out of here you know i'm just getting eaten alive by these circumstances whatever they are we're overwhelmed and we're dropped down to the bottom of the sea we're completely submerged there's no light there's no hope there is no chance that he is getting out of there alive and yet he he turned his face towards the east or wherever he thought east was and he was relying on the prayer of solomon who backslid he was relying on a single scripture and he held on to that with all of his might why because he believed that god said so that god said so and that god would back up his own word and it would have been very easy again for jonah to say well because i'm a messer because you know i went over here and i was going towards tarshish i guess god's not going to hear my prayer and that's exactly the same place that satan wants to get us to where we are looking around at our circumstances that are coming against us ourselves because i mean lord knows we're all a mess absolutely and if we can get our eyes off of everything except for christ then he's won he's completely disarmed us the strong man of faith is not at the door to defend him and he just walks on in without a fight because we have allowed a belief to supersede belief and faith in the word of god we've allowed something to come in and oftentimes it's guised as the word of god absolutely to come in and handcuff us and say say that you are a mess and you're a horrible person and you're never going to change the end goodbye all right you're dismissed it's the truth it's the truth the difference between conviction and condemnation here we go condemnation is gavel whack you're going away life sentence you're never getting out no parole no bail nothing you're dead conviction comes and says you done messed up you done messed up here's all of the things here's the entire rap sheet on you and here's the way out it's always a way out you can distinguish the voice of god and the voice of satan's very very quickly just with that is there a light of hope with it is there some shred of hope satan wants to come and keep us bound always keep us bound you know so is there anything too hard for the lord i'm watching the time i apologize guys we'll come come into a close you know sometimes when things are going wrong dark we know by nature that it's darkest just before day and many times when we see disastrous things happening like that especially to believers we must bear this in our mind that it's satan trying to block the blessing that's on its road that was very much so in this case satan was trying to tempt them speaking of abraham and sarah to feel that they had done wrong and was trying to block the oncoming visitation that god was going to give to abraham and sarah i just want to pop put a pause right there he was trying to convince them that they had done wrong that they must have you know missed the scripture or somewhere they must have missed something maybe i've just not seen it quite right or you know it's been a really long time and again you have done wrong there is none righteous no not one except for me i'm just kidding no i'm i'm we are all filthy rags i love it uh i think in psalms it talks about the lord remembers that we're but dust praise god praise god i am but dust and you know what dust is gonna stay dust no matter how much time i spend on working on this guy i'm still dust no matter how much i achieve in this life and i roll up you know i just it doesn't matter at the end of the it's fine for a great way of life here but and this in the supernatural and for the eternal kingdom to go come it doesn't matter it's literally irrelevant other than we were good stewards with what god gave us and there's nothing wrong with a great life that's all good there's nothing wrong with asking for there's lots of promises of god for that again not preaching against those things we're dividing what is what is to believe the to believe for the promises of god unlimited without limit without without misattribute misattribution where we where we think this is this when it's really not this it's the ability to drive beyond these things and really get to work believing the word of god brother branham talked so often about healing and i i think about this a lot that i think we we majored so much on healing when healing is just a minor there is so much more for us but we haven't mastered the ability to believe god's word to believe why did we bring up these original quotes a prostitute jump up on the platform when many christians don't get healed some random person off the street jumps in and gets healed why because that christian's been through a lot been through a lot of years a lot of hardship a lot of things that have gone wrong a lot of things that didn't go the way that they thought and they may be a believer but they've had their believer hurt they've had they're they're afraid to hope they're afraid to believe and satan wants to keep us there as much as possible it's again i'm preaching to believers i'm preaching to believers i'm not none of us i'm not putting any of us in an unbeliever category and if you are you can be a believer right now that's it that's how fast it's just like that it's just like that it's it just believe i love it right we just sing the song he's in the house comes to jesus my daughter is dead what does he tell him don't be afraid only believe don't do anything else but believe and he says lord i believe help my unbelief even god i love it it's so beautiful here's something as major as death that we're oh my goodness i mean that's just we think of that as being like you got to have super faith to believe for death and here he is coming to christ and he comes to him and he's like yes i believe help my unbelief he is admitting that there's a part of him that doesn't believe and in that truth admitting that to god god i'm not sure if i believe he was able to believe because he could admit maybe what i've been doing this whole time isn't belief this guy is a he's a pharisee for goodness sake he is a member i mean he's a part of the church and he admitted to jesus help my unbelief he humbled himself and in that he was what he didn't need to go pray all night he was able to transcend that unbelief right then and again we we must not go we serve an unlimited god we serve an unlimited god satan wants to come in and put this giant jump through hoops boundaries so that we get this idea in our head that in order to in order to connect with god it always is tomorrow it's always tomorrow it's never today it's never right now there might be something that you've dealt with for your entire life and today god just might decide it's time god will he find faith when he comes it's a scripture it doesn't matter how long it takes will you still believe no matter what and you can that's the key i'm not preaching a sermon of condemnation of you guys should just believe look at me oh man i need this sermon i really need this we all need this we we are constantly surrounded by ella every day we are surrounded by forces that try to come to get us to disbelieve the word of god to try to get our aim and our vision if he can just get us a little bit off siri just said amen so there we go amen and we're taught in the scriptures that all things work together for good to them that love god and no matter how bad it seems remember it has to be working for your good i'm so glad of that satan's been after me all day so i just believe that there's a blessing in store here in this city somewhere and i know when he tempts and tries to block out what's he trying to do get you to disbelieve and if you the worst thing that you can do is disbelieve god and as soon as you get a little scared well maybe i haven't done this and i haven't done that right then satan's got that blessing conquered for you you can't get to it as long as satan makes you think that so what do you do when you start thinking that you just believe you just believe that if it was so that maybe there is something that you're not doing that god is not a god god is not a trickster he is not a trickster trying to slay traps for you he is not the devil he's tr god is trying to help you and if there is something for you to change it will be revealed to you if you're sincere about it i love it david talked about it cleanse me from my secret faults the things i don't even know that i'm doing that i'm doing because there are a lot we're all doing stuff that are wrong and we don't even know we're doing them there are lots of things that's why we need the word of god to come and to mold us and shape us and open our eyes and give us vision to see wow i am i thought i was doing pretty good but man i'm a mess and we're always going to be a mess we're continuously striving and pressing towards the kingdom of god and and it's it it is so that we can always have our faith again not in me not in my walk not in wow you know what today's a pretty good day wow i had my caffeine this morning i had a breakfast you know what i talked to some people it's going great today's a great day today's the day god must want to do something for me today's the worst day of my life god could never do anything for me or maybe he will because i'm doing so bad it's irrelevant it's whether or not i can get if i can get a hold of god can i hold on to that word and really put my belief not in how well i prayed not how much i screamed and shouted or i didn't scream and shout because i'm not like those other people it doesn't matter it is our is my faith anchored in the word of god with christ and that's why we need to read our bible and pray every day i need it we all need it to feed why because you don't know how much faith you have it's a quote i'm not going to bring it up i've already read coming to a close i promise i'm gonna say that six more times um you don't know how much faith you have faith is unconscious but in the moment of need you want it to be there and the only way for it to be there is if you are feeding on the truth on the word of god if you have been allowing this to come into your heart into your mind continuously what it does what reading our bible and praying every day really does is it is forcing our minds to think about it a little bit just think about it and guess what by nature eventually it just becomes something that everything else has to become measured too i mean you think about it you go read a random book oh they said that on youtube but this thing over here that i read said that now i'm confused god is not the author of confusion god is the author of certainty we can hold on to it with truth we need it i need it absolutely again not not any sense of condemnation like oh my goodness i can't believe people are reading their bibles we all you know where you are we all know where we are just coming down into a close the musicians can go ahead and come it must be the greatest battle ever fought 62 it must be accepted in the mind and then it's believed with the heart then the word of god becomes reality then every senses of soul and body is just scoured out with the holy spirit then your sense of god your conscience of god everything that's godly flows through you there's not a doubt anymore there's nothing can rise up there's nothing can come up in the memory and say well i remember miss jones tried and trust god and miss so-and-so and misto tried to trust god for healing one time and she failed see but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the holy spirit that don't even come in memory no matter about miss jones and what she did it's you and god together and nobody else but you too there you are there's your battle [Music] if you'll come and you'll keep them memories and conscience and everything thinking about well i might fail it might not be right don't you do that at all you throw aside everything and open up the channel and say god your word is eternally true and it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet i can't fail because i'm taking your word there's the battle that's the thing how many want to be there i want that i want that more than anything to be there with god amen let's just go to the lord in prayer tonight dear father lord we just come and uh pray that you'd anoint the word that's come forth lord god i just pray that you'd forgive my humanity lord god father i know there was a lot a lot there lord god and i just pray that i haven't left any any loose ends lord god and if there are lord god that you would tie them up lord god father we're trusting lord god in you lord we want lord you to reign supreme in our hearts and in our minds lord god father that that we could truly believe lord god father that if there would be any need in any heart tonight lord god no matter how long someone has waited that they could be encouraged to believe and that they would receive it lord god not in some distant way of future but now and even if it does wait that that faith would roll over to tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day as if it was done right now lord god we just committed all into your hands lord god father we look to you lord we love you we appreciate you father in the name of jesus christ amen just
