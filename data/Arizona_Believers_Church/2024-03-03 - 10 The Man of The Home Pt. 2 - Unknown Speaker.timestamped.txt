[0:00] I'd like to just jump right into it um
[0:02] there will be a few things here at the
[0:04] outset that might be a little bit of a
[0:05] call back to Wednesday night but we're
[0:07] continuing on the man of the home we're
[0:09] not calling it The Mel of the house
[0:11] we're calling it The Man of the home to
[0:13] express some particulars about what it
[0:15] means to be a man but then also uh not
[0:17] just having houses but having those
[0:19] houses to be homes and so a lot of
[0:21] things that we're kind of gathering
[0:24] together and when we talked about the
[0:26] man of the home on Wednesday our thought
[0:27] was a man that's in his rightful place
[0:30] uh and a house that's in order a house
[0:32] that's not divided it becomes a home and
[0:35] so we're those are some of the
[0:36] principles we've been building on and so
[0:40] just here at the outset there's going to
[0:41] be a few things a couple scriptures or
[0:43] three scriptures and a couple quotes uh
[0:46] that we did Wednesday night but I'd like
[0:47] to just jump into it not so much as a
[0:49] review but as uh going forward now in
[0:52] verse 23 of Ephesians chapter 5 having
[0:55] just read this we we're right in the
[0:56] middle of this our minds are uh focused
[0:59] on this it says for the husband is the
[1:01] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[1:05] head of the church and he is the savior
[1:07] of the body now what we re should take
[1:10] away from this isn't so much that the
[1:12] man is the head of the wife but that how
[1:16] it's characterized that he's the head of
[1:18] the wife as Christ is the head of the
[1:20] church so man's headship is defined his
[1:23] headship of the wife in the home is
[1:25] defined by the headship of Christ over
[1:28] the church now let's just admit it you
[1:31] couldn't get more absolute you couldn't
[1:32] get more total if we could say total
[1:35] control or total dependence however
[1:37] you'd want to describe that uh but it is
[1:39] describing the leadership that the man
[1:41] has over the woman now I'm going to
[1:44] acknowledge and come to it maybe here in
[1:45] a little bit that that could begin to
[1:47] cause some people to get a little bit
[1:48] uncomfortable when we think about what
[1:50] Christ is to the church and that the man
[1:52] somehow is going to be that to his
[1:54] family but there's a there's a side of
[1:56] Christ that if we don't put it in the
[1:58] picture yeah it's going to lead to
[2:00] something it's not supposed to be but
[2:02] this is how Paul is presenting it as
[2:04] brother bradam says in Jehovah Gyra he
[2:06] says you're supposed to be the boss of
[2:08] the house he says this to the man you're
[2:10] supposed to be the boss of the house he
[2:11] says you are the ruler the Bible said
[2:15] the man shall rule so that this is
[2:17] establishing this relationship of the
[2:20] man to the woman the relationship of the
[2:21] man within the family and he says he's
[2:23] the he uses the phrase boss of the house
[2:25] you're the ruler and and we bring that
[2:28] we see that in Genesis he says not a
[2:30] dictator now so you may be a boss but
[2:33] don't be bossy right there's a there's
[2:36] something he's saying here not a
[2:37] dictator and you could say well you may
[2:39] be the boss of the house but not in the
[2:41] sense of being an
[2:42] employer or being one that has been
[2:44] tasked with oversight of somebody who's
[2:47] trying to uh increase the company's
[2:49] bottom line so when he says you're the
[2:51] boss of the house he's kind of using
[2:53] that in a way to as a type to show what
[2:56] what a man would be within the home cuz
[2:58] he says not a dictator not not a floor
[3:00] matat that's right so the man isn't the
[3:02] woman isn't to be a floor matat and be
[3:04] under his feet and he says he made him a
[3:06] helpmate a sweetheart so the woman is to
[3:09] be a help meet she's a sweetheart she's
[3:11] a companion and even brother Brandon
[3:13] when he's talking about church order he
[3:15] says we feel that no one person then is
[3:17] a dictator or something in the church so
[3:21] even though a church may have an
[3:22] ultimate Authority and you have a pastor
[3:24] who would be the head of the local body
[3:26] and in this government and this
[3:28] Gathering it it's not there's no office
[3:31] and there's no excuse to become a
[3:33] dictator to be bossy uh to turn those
[3:36] that you lead into a floor matat so he
[3:38] says that no one person is a dictator
[3:41] though he might actually have control
[3:43] brother Bram says in one place that and
[3:45] not to make anybody nervous he says but
[3:46] the pastor can fire the whole board the
[3:48] trustees and the deacons and start all
[3:50] over says he's got power to do that and
[3:52] he's speaking to the brandom Tabernacle
[3:54] and he says we hope it never comes to
[3:56] that but he has that he has that
[3:59] Authority now what a dictator would do
[4:00] is probably just do that on the regular
[4:02] and everybody like oh you know it's
[4:03] getting to that time of year where the
[4:04] pastor's ready to you know chop some
[4:06] heads and send out some pink slips and
[4:08] start all over again because there's a
[4:10] way that that power can be exercised the
[4:13] wrong way brother brandham says in the
[4:15] sermon is your life worthy of the Gospel
[4:17] he says may you men that's got your
[4:19] wives and let them be the boss of the
[4:22] house and lead you around he's saying
[4:25] this is May the god of heaven give you
[4:27] Grace to set your foot down and bring
[4:30] that woman back to a right mind again he
[4:33] says yeah and you all might be thinking
[4:36] yeah and so there's this quite a
[4:39] statement that a woman who's the boss of
[4:41] the house and leading you around he says
[4:43] you've got to have Grace to set your
[4:45] foot down you don't want to do it in the
[4:47] wrong way he says but in order to bring
[4:49] that woman back to her right
[4:50] mind and he says and realize that that's
[4:53] your place in Christ what what's his
[4:56] place in Christ to be the one that's
[4:58] leading because he says she is the boss
[5:01] of the house and leads you around he
[5:02] says you got to realize that's your
[5:04] place in Christ in Christ he says not a
[5:07] boss so we got some competing statements
[5:10] here which one you going to take from
[5:12] you know in February of 1961 or do you
[5:14] want to go with June of 63 which one is
[5:16] it which one do you want to take he says
[5:19] not a boss so in other words it's not a
[5:22] literal boss it's not one that you know
[5:24] can fire you and those different things
[5:26] he says now but you are you are the head
[5:28] of the house
[5:30] so the man is to be the leader he's to
[5:32] be a boss in one sense and by type but
[5:35] then he's not to be a dictator and in
[5:36] another way saying not a boss you can't
[5:38] take that too far but realize that it's
[5:41] your place in Christ to do the
[5:44] leading First Corinthians 11:3 says but
[5:47] I would have you know that the head of
[5:50] every man is Christ now that's first the
[5:52] head of every man is Christ and the head
[5:54] of the woman is the man now when it says
[5:57] that it's clearly orienting the man as
[5:59] the head to the woman but not before he
[6:01] says that the head of the man is Christ
[6:03] so what's happening he's ordering this
[6:04] correctly and then I love how he circles
[6:06] back to Christ and says the head of
[6:07] Christ is
[6:09] God this is the this is the proper order
[6:12] of things just here in one this one
[6:14] sentence it lays out such a beautiful
[6:17] architecture in God's mind this is God's
[6:20] word that's arranging all things this is
[6:22] his arrangement for the home a and this
[6:25] is him putting things in order in other
[6:27] words it's it's kind of being aligned
[6:29] proph ly you have man whose head is
[6:32] Christ and then this man now whose head
[6:35] is Christ he's to be the head of the
[6:37] woman and if he moves out from
[6:39] underneath the headship of Christ then
[6:42] the alignment's not right even if he
[6:44] maintained headship of the woman if he's
[6:46] not aligned under Christ then
[6:48] something's not right because Christ's
[6:50] head is God and our head is Christ it's
[6:52] in order for things to be lined up
[6:55] properly so Christ is it says the head
[6:58] of every man that speaks of the male
[7:00] also is translated to husband the man is
[7:02] to be the husband is to be the wife or
[7:04] the woman's head now there's may be a
[7:07] lot that we could get lost in in just
[7:09] this quick uh type I'd like to point
[7:12] out but if a man is in his place if the
[7:15] head is in its rightful place then the
[7:17] rest of the family can be in
[7:18] alignment so because there's there's God
[7:21] there's Christ and then the man we see
[7:23] the man's kind of in here now if the man
[7:26] gets out of place and then everyone else
[7:28] lines up under him then they're all out
[7:30] of place so the man has to be in place
[7:33] in order for the rest of the family to
[7:35] be in alignment in other for it to
[7:37] function properly and if we were to draw
[7:40] just from the natural type of the human
[7:42] body and we see that Paul does this in
[7:44] many different places how the body works
[7:46] together and is formed together that
[7:48] when you speak of alignment it's when
[7:49] the head the shoulders the spine the
[7:51] hips the knees and the ankles all kind
[7:54] of relate and line up properly and if
[7:57] this is critical this alignment is
[7:58] critical for the body's movement for the
[8:00] mechanics of the of the body for your
[8:02] posture to be right there's all these
[8:04] different things that have to be in
[8:06] alignment sometimes you might be
[8:08] experiencing some pain in certain parts
[8:09] of your body and you go to the doctor
[8:11] the chiropractor and you see a
[8:13] specialist and you're thinking oh man my
[8:15] uh uh my shoulders really bother me my
[8:17] shoulders really bother me and they
[8:18] point out another part of the body
[8:20] that's really tight or or out of order
[8:22] and it's caused the other part of the
[8:24] body to compensate or get pulled itself
[8:27] where a lot of times there's back pain
[8:29] that you might have here and it's all
[8:30] because of tightness in the front
[8:32] because you're you're get there's this
[8:34] atrophy there's this tightening up and
[8:35] you feel it in your back oh my back's
[8:37] hurting what you need to do is open up
[8:39] more and stretch out because there's
[8:40] times when certain parts are out of
[8:42] alignment or suffering and it causes
[8:44] other parts to
[8:47] suffer so proper alignment or improper
[8:50] alignment put stress on the
[8:53] spine put stress on the on the nervous
[8:56] system so if things can be lined up
[8:59] properly it puts less stress on the
[9:01] other parts of the body it relieves the
[9:03] nervous system and there's even you know
[9:06] some approach to Wellness that begins
[9:09] with the alignment of the head and neck
[9:12] and they in some practitioners in this
[9:14] area they're going to look at the body
[9:15] and no matter what's in it they're going
[9:16] to start by saying we need to get your
[9:18] head in place we need to get your neck
[9:20] and spine lined up right and then it can
[9:21] begin to address everything else and
[9:23] that may be an approach to uh maybe in
[9:26] some ways a holistic look at the body in
[9:28] a way of uh addressing maladies within
[9:30] person's sickness and within their flesh
[9:32] and whether it be bones or muscles it's
[9:34] a matter of getting the head right now
[9:36] I'm not advocating for that approach
[9:37] necessarily I'm just acknowledging that
[9:39] it's there but the truth is that the
[9:42] word tells us get the head right and the
[9:44] rest will be
[9:45] right so the man must be in his place to
[9:49] keep the other parts of the body from
[9:51] being pulled out of their place and
[9:53] stressed because if you take the head of
[9:56] Christ is God so God Christ and then the
[10:00] man is supposed to be in alignment with
[10:01] this and you have a man that leaves his
[10:04] place and the family is trying to hold
[10:06] their place in Christ that man being out
[10:09] of his place is going to put stress on
[10:10] the rest of the family going to put
[10:13] pressure now when Paul establishes man's
[10:16] headship or the husband as he says the
[10:18] the the head of the woman is the
[10:21] man this man translated to husband so
[10:23] we're looking at it in that specific
[10:25] relationship this isn't this isn't for
[10:29] men and males to kind of look out on all
[10:31] women and you know you're at the grocery
[10:33] store woman you know just all every
[10:35] random stranger every female out there
[10:37] you're the head of but it's talking
[10:38] about the relationship is what defines
[10:41] uh establishes this but as he places the
[10:43] man as the head he defines it he doesn't
[10:47] just say well the man is the head of the
[10:48] woman and then we're kind of left to
[10:50] interpret that how we want to or uh
[10:53] demonstrate that how we think it should
[10:54] be but he defines it as I say like
[10:58] Christ and and the phrase he uses is
[11:00] even as Christ we've already read it
[11:03] twice uh today or we can look at it
[11:06] again in Ephesians chapter 5:21 for no
[11:08] man ever yet hated his own flesh but
[11:10] nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the
[11:13] Lord the church so you're to nourish and
[11:15] cherish your wife it's it's to take care
[11:18] of and he uses that phrase even as
[11:20] Christ even as Christ is the head even
[11:22] as the Lord the church this phrase even
[11:25] as keeps coming up and he and he says
[11:28] the head is we've already read this the
[11:30] head is the savior of the body he's the
[11:32] deliverer he's the preserver he's the
[11:34] one that keeps safe he's the one that
[11:36] keeps sound makes well so when it says
[11:39] that the the the man is the head I know
[11:42] maybe kind of like the idea that the
[11:43] head is on top and everything supporting
[11:45] it you know and everything's just in awe
[11:48] the head right and we're all going to do
[11:50] we're all going to just serve the head
[11:52] and serve the head but then the way it's
[11:53] described is kind of this it's kind of
[11:56] turns it around it's kind like the head
[11:57] is the one that preserves and the the
[11:59] head is the one that nourishes and the
[12:01] head is the one that delivers and keeps
[12:02] safe and keeps sound and makes
[12:04] well it says in verses 25 and 26 in
[12:08] chapter 5 of Ephesians husbands love
[12:10] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[12:13] church and gave himself for it notice
[12:17] how that when Paul refers to uh this
[12:20] alignment he kind of helps us understand
[12:23] what it means by giving us some
[12:24] description love your wives as Christ
[12:27] loved the church and gave himself for it
[12:30] so this love is sacrificial this love is
[12:31] giv it's not selfish that he might
[12:34] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[12:37] of Water by the word now so in the same
[12:40] way that Christ is a sanctifier and a
[12:42] washer and a giver the man is to be that
[12:45] way to the woman or to the family the as
[12:48] a giver he gives himself for his wife as
[12:50] The Giver as the head as the Lover he
[12:52] gives himself to his family it means he
[12:54] allows himself to be used for them
[12:57] doesn't take the attitude of I'm I'm the
[13:00] head I'm the boss this is what I love to
[13:02] do this is what makes me happy this is
[13:05] what you know we all need to do what I
[13:06] want to do but he's a little bit more
[13:07] sensitive to figure out you know what's
[13:09] best for the family what's best for my
[13:11] wife and my children and how can we work
[13:13] together in this he's a sanctifier that
[13:15] means he separates from Wicked
[13:18] things set apart from things that spoil
[13:20] sets apart from things that harm that's
[13:23] the primary duty of a husband is to give
[13:26] watch out over his home and and to look
[13:28] out after so can separate from Wicked
[13:30] things and separate things that harm and
[13:32] and and get away from things that spoil
[13:34] and he's the cleanser in other words he
[13:35] frees from
[13:37] wickedness he guides from faults and
[13:41] mistakes he washes away every fear he
[13:44] washes away the world that's the that's
[13:46] the role that the head should have he
[13:48] shouldn't be someone that strikes fear
[13:52] right in the heart of his wife and his
[13:53] children like dad's home right and and
[13:57] you say that
[13:59] we kind of chuckle a little bit but you
[14:00] know there's people that the sound of a
[14:03] garage door opening is a trigger and I'm
[14:07] not being ridiculous because they can
[14:09] Rec they and growing up they knew that
[14:11] when Dad got home from work the
[14:12] atmosphere would change in a really
[14:14] really bad way and everybody's uptight
[14:16] and everybody's
[14:17] nervous because the way that he uh uh
[14:20] the way that he conducts himself and yet
[14:23] the husband ought to be one that would
[14:25] relieve that stress he's a giver he's a
[14:28] sanctifier he's a nurturer he's a
[14:29] cleanser he nurtures he feeds he brings
[14:31] up he tenderly cares for He Fosters
[14:34] that's what the idea that's embodied in
[14:35] some of these phrases that are used he's
[14:37] looking out after with tender care
[14:40] that's not that's the body's not doing
[14:42] that to the head the head is doing that
[14:43] to the body in this in this
[14:45] description so when Paul says as
[14:49] Christ uh it gives a man a place in the
[14:52] family which is like the role of Christ
[14:54] in the church now could you agree maybe
[14:58] not all of you collectively but
[14:59] individually as you feel Liberty to say
[15:01] Amen or nod your head or give me the
[15:02] side eye could you agree that when Paul
[15:06] is using this language he places the man
[15:09] in the family in a role which is like
[15:11] Christ relationship to the church or his
[15:14] body now this is where I'd like to
[15:16] acknowledge that this Arrangement can be
[15:19] used to abuse that's right this
[15:22] Arrangement or this a relationship can
[15:24] be used to manipulate because I'm the
[15:26] head and I'm the boss and I'm the master
[15:28] and I that it it can be used in a way to
[15:31] where uh it it lends itself to
[15:34] manipulation and control and abuse and
[15:36] and a lot of negative things but man
[15:39] must be becoming
[15:41] Christlike and I I say it that way
[15:43] because I realize the challenge that we
[15:45] face in being like Christ but there
[15:47] should be some uh evolution in our life
[15:50] where we're becoming Christlike because
[15:52] if not the our evolving stewardship uh
[15:55] can be unscriptural that's right God
[15:58] places Us in relationship to our wives
[16:00] as the head now if we're not becoming
[16:04] more like Christ then as our stewardship
[16:07] evolves it's becoming more and more
[16:09] unscriptural and I say maybe worse not
[16:12] just unscriptural but
[16:14] destructive and and even satanic because
[16:17] a man must lead he must rule he's called
[16:20] To Rule The Bible's showing us very
[16:22] clearly the Bible said a man shall rule
[16:24] he shall give rule be have rule over
[16:26] Thee the Bible says uh and that was the
[16:28] less we learned in the Book of Esther
[16:30] that a man has to rule his home the
[16:32] right way uh man must rule but it has to
[16:35] be done the right way brother says a man
[16:38] without character cannot Reign because
[16:40] power apart from character is satanic
[16:43] but Power with character is what fit to
[16:46] rule and it would apply to our
[16:48] relationships where there's a um
[16:51] Authority or
[16:53] headship and I believe this forms the
[16:56] proper inspection of Our Lives when it
[16:58] comes to the Way That We Rule now by men
[17:01] or by man within our
[17:03] relationships and the sermon the message
[17:05] of Grace brother BR says I think we're
[17:07] always hollering about women do right so
[17:10] brother Bram often times is
[17:11] characterized as just balling out women
[17:13] he acknowledges even how uh people
[17:15] characterize him and you listen to the
[17:17] sermons you realize he's very hard on
[17:19] women he acknowledges even a complex
[17:21] that he had and I don't think we should
[17:23] water down or trivialize some of the
[17:25] observations that brother Brandon was
[17:26] making or any of the observations he
[17:28] made
[17:29] but he steps back a little bit here and
[17:30] he says you sons of God men I know
[17:34] you're the stronger Bunch that's right
[17:36] the stronger sex you're over the woman
[17:40] that's true so act like it in other
[17:44] words we can put a lot of pressure on
[17:45] the woman but you know she's the weaker
[17:47] vessel you're the stronger one and yes
[17:50] you're over the woman we acknowledge
[17:52] that you're over the woman but he says
[17:54] act like it don't overpower them so the
[17:58] idea isn't just to over is to overpower
[18:01] and use opportunity or use position or
[18:04] use privilege in a way where I'm going
[18:06] to I'm going to make this work a man
[18:09] should never use opportunity uh
[18:11] privilege power to accomplish something
[18:14] that God wants us to accomplish by his
[18:16] word through humility there there's
[18:18] certain things that God wants to
[18:19] accomplish and we can do it through
[18:21] Power we can do it through popularity
[18:22] and Prestige we can opportunity take
[18:25] advantage and say up I got it I got it
[18:27] but he's given us way to do it by the
[18:29] word and
[18:30] humility he says you you don't overpower
[18:33] them try to take some little girl and
[18:34] ruin her life but be a Son of God he
[18:37] says tell her she's in the wrong and
[18:40] stand like a Son of God so you have to
[18:43] stand like a Son of God that's in your
[18:45] place so that you can bring a woman into
[18:47] her place that's why you need Grace to
[18:49] put your place your foot where you
[18:51] belong in order to get bring that woman
[18:53] back into her right mind again he says
[18:55] but we can't try to overpower and he
[18:57] says she your
[19:00] sister he's reminding us that she may be
[19:03] your wife and they they may be your kids
[19:05] but they're both Gods they're all God
[19:07] they belong to God and you have some
[19:09] stewardship over them and you may be
[19:12] able to by force align
[19:15] them but if you're out of your place
[19:17] they're out of their
[19:19] place right oh yeah the head of uh
[19:23] Christ is God so God Christ the man the
[19:26] family the woman the everything's ly up
[19:28] properly then you get out of your place
[19:30] and you remember wait a minute I'm the
[19:33] boss so I'm going to get them in place
[19:36] and you may accomplish getting everybody
[19:39] in their place under you through Power
[19:42] and through threats and through just
[19:43] brute strength or through culture
[19:45] whatever it might be intimidation and
[19:47] you got them in place but you've only
[19:49] got them out of their place because
[19:51] you're not in your
[19:54] place is everybody with me awesome we
[19:57] can answer for one another in Colossians
[19:59] 3: 19- 21 hopefully I can read this
[20:03] times just read this and then move on
[20:05] here but the way he phrases this I I
[20:08] could get hung up here for a little bit
[20:10] I trust we can take a further step here
[20:13] husbands love your wives this is not
[20:15] unlike what he's already said in
[20:16] Ephesians 5:25 husband love your wives
[20:19] but then he adds the phrase and be not
[20:21] bitter against them so he tells us one
[20:23] thing to do one thing not to do children
[20:25] obey your parents in all things for this
[20:27] is well pleasing to the Lord fathers
[20:29] provoke not your children to anger lest
[20:32] they be discouraged here in Colossians
[20:35] you'll find it also in Titus you see it
[20:36] in Ephesians chapter 5 Paul is giving
[20:39] the orders or I'd like to say the
[20:40] charges the marching instructions for
[20:43] the office of a husband and a father he
[20:46] he's given us some very specific things
[20:48] though we might say they're General in
[20:50] uh maybe on this higher level but he's
[20:52] saying to love and to provoke not and
[20:54] he's given us these charges and we can
[20:57] say the husband now in relation to his
[20:59] wife is charged to love his wife says
[21:02] and be not bitter against them and not
[21:03] be harsh or resentful to her that you
[21:07] should love and not be harsh so love
[21:10] without being harsh is what's being
[21:11] encouraged here and they says father uh
[21:14] provoke not so a father is charged with
[21:16] raising his children by godly
[21:19] encouragement and not provoking it says
[21:21] in Ephesians 64 maybe we should just
[21:23] read this first and ye fathers provoke
[21:25] not your children to Wrath but bring
[21:28] them up in the nurture and admonition of
[21:31] the Lord so the not comes first but we
[21:33] can say fathers bring up your children
[21:36] in the nurture and admonition of the
[21:37] Lord and provoke not your children to
[21:39] anger lest they be discouraged bring
[21:41] them up in the nurture and admonition of
[21:43] the Lord and provoke not your children
[21:44] to wrath so it tells the fathers what
[21:47] they're to do they're to raise their
[21:49] children by using godly encouragement to
[21:52] do it in a Godly manner to nurture them
[21:54] and admonish them uh uh in the way of
[21:56] the Lord that the Lord would bring them
[21:58] up the right way now I I want you just
[22:02] to catch this on its face there's this
[22:03] general order that's very
[22:05] positive for husbands to love and to
[22:08] fathers to nurture with the caution
[22:11] against the wrong approach so there's a
[22:14] way that we are related to the wife
[22:16] related to the children and there is a
[22:18] charge that that this office has that
[22:22] the man has to love his wife and to
[22:24] nurture his children but it doesn't just
[22:26] tell you to do that without pour out
[22:29] that the relationship can give rise if
[22:31] it's perverted it can give rise to the
[22:33] wrong approach or the negative you have
[22:36] the positive manifestation of the
[22:37] relationship then you kind of have this
[22:40] uh this weaker sense or this uh
[22:42] Corruption of their leadership love
[22:46] without
[22:47] bitterness to bring up without
[22:49] provoking he's addressing even a natural
[22:52] tendency or corruption in these
[22:56] relationships that a husband has the
[22:58] head can be harsh that that's a that's a
[23:00] sinful tendency that as as recognizing
[23:03] being the head or the The Strain that
[23:05] can come in that and the responsibility
[23:07] that comes with that there can be this
[23:08] resentment there can be this hard
[23:10] hardness that comes even that contempt
[23:12] we talk about so he says love that's
[23:14] what you ought to do that's positive and
[23:16] watch out for bitterness love without
[23:19] getting Bitter Love without being hard
[23:21] love without being harsh Love Without
[23:23] overpowering Love without trying to uh
[23:25] Force into a particular way and also
[23:28] bring up nurture encourage your children
[23:31] because you've got to do it the right
[23:32] way because if you don't if you're upset
[23:34] if you're frustrated if you're impatient
[23:35] you just so anger to them so he's kind
[23:38] of addressing the the Dark Side of
[23:41] leadership where it becomes hard and
[23:43] overpowering and
[23:46] insensitive now in Matthew chapter 20:
[23:49] 25 to
[23:51] 28 I think it's just wonderful that
[23:53] brother Jason Watkins when he was here
[23:55] was addressing these very things
[23:59] and the continuity that it had with the
[24:00] things that we were ministering on I
[24:02] appreciated that just myself personally
[24:04] it's
[24:05] encouraging and it says now but Jesus
[24:07] called them unto him and we'll look at
[24:10] this in another place I think here in a
[24:12] little bit where it gives us some more
[24:14] background he says you know that the
[24:16] princes of the Gentiles exercise
[24:19] dominion over them so within the the
[24:22] Gentile culture you look out amongst the
[24:24] Gentiles and you have princes that use
[24:26] the phrase exercise
[24:28] dominion over them and they that are
[24:31] great exercise Authority upon them now
[24:36] catch what he's saying in this verse
[24:38] verse 25 do you see the Gentiles who do
[24:41] not have the word do not have the law do
[24:42] not have a relationship with God that
[24:45] the great exercise Authority upon and
[24:49] the the princes exercise dominion over
[24:52] so he's he's identifying a particular
[24:54] way of leadership particular Arrangement
[24:56] and the way that people relate to
[24:58] princes and and uh people relate to
[25:01] Authority and then he makes this
[25:02] statement in verse 26 but it shall not
[25:04] be so among
[25:06] you now that's quite a statement because
[25:09] he's in one way we just look at and say
[25:11] well there's a dominion and there is
[25:13] Authority and there is structure and
[25:14] there is headship and there are
[25:15] arrangements and and a proper alignment
[25:17] but he says that the Gentiles exercise
[25:19] dominion and Authority the wrong way in
[25:23] other words they claim superiority over
[25:26] others the es uh exercise dominion over
[25:30] the Gentiles claiming to be superior
[25:33] they Lord over those who are under them
[25:36] because he says they exercise Authority
[25:38] upon them and over them they Lord over
[25:40] them as being they're beneath them
[25:43] they're below them and the the great
[25:45] ones are over them you see this it's an
[25:49] attitude that the princes have it's an
[25:51] attitude that the Great have that
[25:53] because of power and because of wealth
[25:55] and because of a lineage or whatever I'm
[25:57] greater you're you're you're less we're
[26:01] more powerful and he says but that's not
[26:03] the way it should be among you amen this
[26:05] isn't the way that it ought to be he
[26:08] says but it shall not be so among you
[26:11] but whosoever will be great among you
[26:14] now calling back to the princes and
[26:15] those that are great amongst the
[26:16] Gentiles he say now uh in this Kingdom
[26:19] it's different whosoever will be great
[26:21] among you let him be your minister in
[26:25] the Lord's House in his kingdom let the
[26:27] Chief the greatest be your minister
[26:30] which is let him be your
[26:32] servant CU in the Gentile Kingdom you'd
[26:35] have the Lords and the Surfs you'd have
[26:36] the Lords and all those that serve and
[26:38] you'd have the peasants and and you'd
[26:39] have a way that it's it it's described
[26:42] to where well we just serve him he's the
[26:43] one that owns the land and and we just
[26:46] look out after it for him and we owe him
[26:48] this and we owe him that that's not the
[26:50] way it is the one who's the greatest the
[26:52] land owner in that sense would be the
[26:54] servant I own this land and I can give
[26:56] it to you and you can use it and and we
[26:58] can make sure that it's free from
[26:59] enemies and we'll watch out over you and
[27:01] we'll do all sorts of things to protect
[27:02] you the economy and protect the region
[27:04] and protect your land it's it's one of
[27:06] these ideas that I'm here a as the owner
[27:08] because you need to be taken care of and
[27:11] and I want to look out after you and I
[27:12] want to protect you and it's not the
[27:14] other way
[27:15] around so let him be your
[27:17] servant and whosoever will be Chief
[27:19] among you let him be your servant so the
[27:22] Great and the chief the first the
[27:25] preeminent now he gives us
[27:28] the even as portion even as the son of
[27:31] man as Paul said even as Christ even as
[27:33] Christ even as the Lord even as the son
[27:35] of man came not to be ministered unto
[27:37] but to minister and to give his life a
[27:40] ransom for many the chief is the one
[27:43] who's first in rank the one that has the
[27:45] highest influence and the greatest honor
[27:47] he's the one that's to be the servant
[27:49] even as the son of man which is Christ
[27:51] even as Christ is not the head to be
[27:55] served but to serve
[27:58] he's the head not to be to to to receive
[28:01] but to give I think a little some time
[28:04] ago in the last few Services we kind of
[28:06] asked the question is if is Christ the
[28:09] head and we all agreed and I said now
[28:12] which one of you serve him better or
[28:13] more than he serves you and we kind of
[28:16] all
[28:17] went yeah that's a trick question I and
[28:20] it's true he the head has done more for
[28:23] us than we could ever do for him that's
[28:25] kind of what births the beautiful Mutual
[28:27] dependency that we would have to him is
[28:28] because of what he's given and how he's
[28:30] lived and how secure we are in his love
[28:32] I saying I the son of man I do not
[28:35] exercise Dominion or exercise authority
[28:39] over those that are in my house if
[28:41] anything he exercise this Dominion
[28:43] control of authority over those that
[28:45] would harm the house that would come
[28:47] against the house it's those that He
[28:49] cast out it's those that he spoke would
[28:51] uh would subdue and and bring subject
[28:53] but to his house he would
[28:55] nurture he would ser
[28:58] serve brother brandom the sermon
[29:00] thirsting for life and he uses it
[29:02] thirsting for life as a a sermon even in
[29:05] different years when he preached and he
[29:06] touched on these things he says speak to
[29:08] the woman her place is home that's it
[29:10] here she's supposed to be at home and we
[29:12] could all just
[29:15] like right we like that highlight it
[29:17] stop there take the name of Jesus with
[29:21] right let's all go home he said he's
[29:24] he's showing that but he says and Mister
[29:26] you might call yourself ever so good but
[29:29] if you've got lodges and other things ah
[29:33] I love it when he says other
[29:36] things because we might say I don't go
[29:39] to a lodge but you know what there's
[29:40] other
[29:41] things he says that call you away from
[29:46] her at night on you ought to be ashamed
[29:50] of
[29:51] yourself if you have okay I'm not going
[29:54] to a lodge but if you have other things
[29:56] that keep you out of the house in the
[29:59] evenings if you've been at work all day
[30:01] long or maybe you work from home and
[30:03] you're in your dungeon all day long and
[30:04] you you come out to go out right he says
[30:08] if you have other things that call you
[30:10] away you ought to be ashamed of
[30:13] yourself this is and you can say well
[30:15] brother Aaron don't lean too hard into
[30:17] that because you can take this out of
[30:18] context well you just think about it a
[30:20] little bit I'll just I'll just read it
[30:21] to you and you think about it God gave
[30:24] you a home to cherish and comfort and
[30:27] things like
[30:29] that you have you have a home to cherish
[30:32] you have a you have a home to comfort
[30:34] now brother B I'm saying this in the way
[30:35] we recognize that the home's to be a
[30:37] comfort to the man and the home's to
[30:39] cherish the man and there kind of like
[30:40] this Synergy that's to go this Dynamo
[30:42] that's supposed to be working he says
[30:44] when a man leaves the home to go find to
[30:47] go cherish other things and give
[30:49] attention to other things and he
[30:50] forsakes his home you should be ashamed
[30:52] God gave you a home to cherish a home to
[30:54] comfort things like that and it's a
[30:56] shame to see the way
[30:57] men does their wives and wives do
[31:00] men he says the Womanhood and fatherhood
[31:03] of the nation is tore to Pieces divorce
[31:05] courts piled
[31:07] full because the man isn't attendant
[31:10] upon his duty he has the other things a
[31:14] and other things he enjoys and things he
[31:15] needs and way ways that he wants to be
[31:18] benefited and he think he's only
[31:20] thinking of himself and doing that
[31:22] called away from the home Time After
[31:24] Time After Time and he says you should
[31:26] be ashamed of yourself
[31:27] because a man's place and and and I
[31:29] guess uh maybe I should take some more
[31:31] time on this he's saying the Woman's
[31:33] Place is in the home but how could that
[31:35] ever be her place if the man's not in it
[31:39] too right you say A Woman's Place is in
[31:41] the kitchen and and and you know that's
[31:43] a phrase that's kind of used more maybe
[31:45] more jokingly than literally anymore but
[31:48] you know what goods the kitchen if the
[31:49] man's not there what what good's the
[31:52] home if the man's not there the man has
[31:55] to have that place mister if you've got
[31:57] other things that are calling you away
[31:59] from your post- of Duty you should be
[32:00] ashamed because you've got a home you
[32:01] need to cherish you have a wife you need
[32:03] to take care of and comfort he says it's
[32:05] a shame to see what a man does to his
[32:07] wife by forsaking his duty because the
[32:09] man just doesn't exercise Dominion he
[32:11] doesn't just exercise Authority he's
[32:13] just not the head of the house and I
[32:14] work all day so I can go out and do
[32:16] these things he is a servant to the
[32:19] family in Matthew chapter 23 we'll read
[32:22] uh to verse verses 1 to
[32:24] 12 I think we're doing okay on time
[32:27] says then spake Jesus to the multitudes
[32:30] and to his disciples saying the scribes
[32:32] and the Pharisees sit in Moses's seat
[32:35] that's quite a statement they have
[32:37] authority legal Authority all therefore
[32:40] whatsoever they bid You observe that
[32:42] observe and do now this he's saying that
[32:45] those who are in Authority do what they
[32:47] say is that not what he's
[32:49] saying he he's saying that they the
[32:52] scribes and Pharisees whatever they tell
[32:53] you to do and whatever they tell you to
[32:55] observe you do but he says because
[32:57] they're in
[32:58] Authority this is how this is what's
[33:01] established in the structure that exist
[33:03] within uh within their tradition he says
[33:05] but do not ye after their works for they
[33:09] say and do not now just as uh just as
[33:13] Jesus kind of called out the way the
[33:14] Gentiles work he's saying and your model
[33:17] within our Jewish Tradition now in the
[33:19] nation of Israel we've got it kind of
[33:21] backwards too because the Gentiles ex
[33:23] Dominion exercise dominion over and
[33:25] Authority upon he says now you're being
[33:28] told to do things and you ought to do it
[33:30] but you know notice those who are in
[33:31] Authority how it's been corrupted
[33:33] because they say and do not do and what
[33:36] does that tell us the best way that a
[33:37] man can lead is by
[33:40] example it's the best way he can lead is
[33:42] by being an example instead of telling
[33:44] the people what to do you show them what
[33:45] to do that's why a a pastor should be
[33:48] the husband of one wife so you don't
[33:50] have to tell them to be the husband of
[33:52] one wife you just show them that's what
[33:53] you're supposed to do he says for they
[33:55] say and do not for they bind heavy
[33:58] burdens and Grievous to be born and lay
[34:02] them on men's
[34:03] shoulders look at this this is the wrong
[34:05] kind of leadership the wrong kind of
[34:08] this would be the wrong way to pastor
[34:10] this would be the wrong way to be a
[34:11] scribe or Pharisee wrong way to be a
[34:13] husband wrong way to be a father you
[34:15] bind heavy burdens and Grievous things
[34:17] to be born and lay them on men's
[34:18] shoulders but they themselves will not
[34:19] even move them with one of their
[34:21] fingers just all put it all on the
[34:24] people put it all on the wife put it all
[34:25] on the children says but all their Works
[34:27] they do for to be seen of
[34:30] men so there's the heavy the these
[34:32] laboring things these burdensome things
[34:34] they put on the people but where do they
[34:36] labor where do they spend their time
[34:38] what is it they're concerned about
[34:40] Optics popularity a little bit of
[34:42] pretense everything they do they' be
[34:44] seen of mean they make broad their
[34:45] felies and enlarge the borders of their
[34:47] garments and love the uppermost rooms at
[34:49] the feast and the chief seats in the
[34:51] synagogues ingredients in the markets
[34:53] and to be called of men Rabbi Rabbi
[34:56] right they they like the idea that they
[34:58] sit in Moses seat they they're drunk on
[35:01] their own crowns they there there's a
[35:03] there's they're drunk on this power and
[35:04] they get caught up in that that this is
[35:07] what a man is and this is what it means
[35:08] to be a husband and this is what it
[35:10] means to be a dad and a father and a and
[35:12] a real man and a pastor whatever a
[35:14] minister and and you start reading this
[35:16] you realize yeah you know sometimes
[35:17] we're guilty of kind of carving out the
[35:19] elites and we carve out the ministers
[35:20] and they sit on the platform a A or they
[35:23] sit at their own tables and they always
[35:25] get to eat first and you wonder why they
[35:26] always way too much or you know there's
[35:28] just a way that we kind of just honor
[35:30] and L and and we separate them out and
[35:32] in a way you create this dichotomy in
[35:34] this structure to where you have those
[35:37] that exercise dominion over and we're no
[35:40] longer in it together right you're just
[35:42] the
[35:47] Surfs he says but be not called Rabbi
[35:50] for one is your master even Christ and
[35:52] all ye are
[35:55] Brethren that's one of the most
[35:57] important things we need to recognize
[35:58] we're we're brothers we're sisters he
[35:59] said that your wife she's your sister
[36:02] this isn't one greater and and one's
[36:04] more important in that Gentile sense he
[36:07] says we're all together we're Brethren
[36:08] and and call no man your father upon the
[36:10] Earth for one is your father which is in
[36:12] heaven like what what what do the
[36:14] Catholics do with
[36:18] that he you he says he's not saying
[36:21] that's not what he's saying that's what
[36:23] they're saying right some some oddom CL
[36:27] like that however you use it to get out
[36:28] of it but he says and neither be ye
[36:31] called Masters for one is your master
[36:33] even Christ but he that is greatest
[36:37] among you shall be your servant and it
[36:40] completely is a paradigm shift of what
[36:43] the Gentiles do and what the Jews do
[36:45] because you have these kingdoms but now
[36:47] in our Kingdom In My Kingdom he's saying
[36:49] he that is greatest is going to be your
[36:50] ministry he's going to be your servant
[36:52] and whosoever shall exalt himself shall
[36:54] be abased and he that shall humble
[36:55] himself shall be exalted
[36:58] he that is greatest let him be the
[37:00] minister so if someone's a minister it's
[37:02] not to be served they're declaring that
[37:04] they ought to be the one with the burden
[37:06] to serve a minister is not the one that
[37:10] I say myself I'm a minister and I'm a
[37:11] minister because you guys serve me or
[37:13] minister to me no it's exactly the
[37:16] opposite right that if it never came my
[37:19] way my calling is to serve you if I
[37:22] never got any feedback if I never got an
[37:24] encouragement if I always had to go home
[37:26] look in the mirror say raise your hand
[37:28] pat yourself on the back if that's what
[37:29] I had to do every Sunday afternoon I
[37:31] still have to stay faithful to my
[37:33] calling to serve and to serve because
[37:35] it's not about me it's not about my ego
[37:37] it's not about my pride it's not about
[37:39] my uh what makes me look good I have to
[37:41] have and I'm saying this uh openly in
[37:43] public so that you can hold me
[37:44] accountable if my actions are ever
[37:46] contrary to this I've got to keep you in
[37:48] mind and your health in mind in Minister
[37:50] and serve you and I believe and F with
[37:52] all my heart that if I do that part
[37:54] right I don't have to worry about your
[37:55] part that you will turn encourage me and
[37:58] it's worked that way my family and are
[38:00] constantly encouraged by you and
[38:01] supported by you and made to feel uh um
[38:05] a part of you and if we can keep that
[38:07] Focus right that we're servants one to
[38:09] another we're brothers and sisters in
[38:11] Christ and we don't get topheavy then we
[38:13] can make we can be
[38:17] healthy and I think the responsibility
[38:20] begins with the
[38:21] head as Jesus is identifying both in the
[38:24] Gentiles and now even with the Jews that
[38:26] there's this wrong kind of attitude of
[38:28] you know I sit in Moses seat so you guys
[38:30] need to do this and you guys need to do
[38:32] that and you guys need to do this and
[38:33] it's just binding the people so much and
[38:35] he's over there saying and they won't
[38:36] even lift their finger to do any of that
[38:39] but they they do a lot of things to make
[38:41] themselves look good
[38:42] publicly and that's what they focus on
[38:45] is making themselves look
[38:47] different seemingly not having the same
[38:49] burdens as everybody else and he said
[38:51] that's not how it ought to be let the
[38:52] greatest serve let them Minister the
[38:55] sermon thinking man's filter says the
[38:56] Bible is speaking in Ephesians the women
[38:58] seeing she reverence her husband
[39:00] reverence her husband and we're like
[39:03] yeah end it there brother Aaron it's
[39:06] 11:15 moving
[39:09] on then a husband ought to live such a
[39:11] life before his wife that his wife could
[39:13] reverence him as a Son of God so it's
[39:16] kind of showing he says yeah the woman
[39:18] has to reverence her husband but why
[39:19] make it so hard for her right right why
[39:22] why make it to where she just has to
[39:24] keep reading her Bible every day see
[39:25] that you re your husband God help me
[39:28] reverence my husband God please help me
[39:30] reverence my husband and that's her
[39:32] biggest burden is I I can't respect him
[39:34] and I can't have it's so hard for me to
[39:37] reverence him it's so hard and he said
[39:39] well make it easy on her make it easy on
[39:42] the the wife by making Christ your head
[39:45] by living such a life to where she could
[39:46] reverence you as a Son of God and if he
[39:48] doesn't live that kind of life now I
[39:50] don't now be careful here he says well
[39:52] then of course she wouldn't reverence
[39:54] him because she knows what he's made of
[39:56] of but he's not saying you shouldn't
[39:59] reverence some right he's just saying
[40:01] you wouldn't you're like now you're just
[40:03] being a lawyer and you know I am but
[40:06] that's not what I'm doing he's just
[40:09] saying it makes sense yes if you're
[40:12] running off to lodges and other things
[40:14] at night and abandoning the home that
[40:16] you've been given to cherish and care
[40:18] for and things like that and comfort
[40:19] then she's like I can't have respect for
[40:21] that now she ought to reverence her
[40:24] husband but you've made it really hard
[40:25] on her to do it
[40:27] so he says she knows what he's made of
[40:29] but when a when it's a man that is
[40:31] reverent man reverent and clean kind of
[40:34] I can kind of notice his language
[40:35] doesn't escape me a woman should
[40:37] reverence her husband and I said but if
[40:40] he's a reverent man just brings it out
[40:42] of
[40:43] her God made the man the woman to bring
[40:47] out whatever the man swws into
[40:49] her that's just the way that he ordained
[40:51] it in the very beginning we knew this is
[40:53] how God had arranged them and so when
[40:55] the man is reverent he SS reverence into
[40:57] her and that's what he gets in return
[41:00] but when a man that is reverent and
[41:02] clean with his wife and before his
[41:04] family a real servant of God then the
[41:06] women children and all should respect
[41:08] that servant of God with reverence so in
[41:11] one place he says if you're not living
[41:13] the life you wouldn't be reverenced he's
[41:15] saiding it's really hard for that to
[41:17] happen but he comes back and says if
[41:18] he's living the right kind of Life he's
[41:20] now it's a challenge to those who who
[41:22] maybe aren't reverence he says you
[41:23] should respect that you should give r
[41:27] and and I I believe that Bear's saying
[41:29] here on both sides that if the woman's
[41:32] to be reverent to the man and she's not
[41:35] then that doesn't give a man license to
[41:37] not love her it doesn't give him license
[41:40] to not nourish and Char it doesn't give
[41:42] him license to run off to The Lodges and
[41:43] other things and here if the man is not
[41:45] reverent and the man isn't clean he
[41:47] doesn't live the right kind of life it
[41:48] doesn't give the wife license to
[41:50] ridicule him doesn't give her license to
[41:53] shame him and to lead say well my
[41:55] husband H's my husband's not spiritual
[41:58] my husband's ignorant my husband's this
[41:59] my husband's that and and I'm more
[42:01] spiritual than my husband and I got a
[42:03] better understand of the message and I'm
[42:04] more holy and I pray more and I I lead
[42:06] the children in prayer and I do this and
[42:08] I do that it's kind of like the the
[42:09] woman the woman the woman the woman
[42:11] she's the one that's leading and and she
[42:13] has this attitude towards her husband
[42:14] you realize with that kind of attitude
[42:16] the man will never take his
[42:18] place I mean because this is what it
[42:20] looks like the man should be the head of
[42:22] the home and the woman's going to say
[42:23] you get in your place right now he's
[42:25] like yes I
[42:27] look at me I'm the head right it's like
[42:31] my my brother had a voicemail prompt one
[42:33] time on Verizon he said warning a
[42:35] woman's about to tell you what to do and
[42:38] next thing you hear is a woman saying
[42:39] please leave a message after the tone
[42:40] right and a lot of us our GPS tells us
[42:43] it's a woman telling us turn here stop
[42:45] there turn around and we're just kind of
[42:46] used to it we go home and the wife tells
[42:49] us what to do we're like y
[42:51] That's and there's a way that we we
[42:54] can't we can't properly assume headship
[42:56] if the woman's snapping her fingers and
[42:58] say take the
[43:00] lead right how does that work now I I'm
[43:05] calling out an obvious Dynamic that
[43:07] exists within some of our relationships
[43:08] when families get a little bit cold and
[43:10] they're not in the Rhythm that they
[43:11] ought to be in a and and it creates this
[43:14] coldness and this Chasm to where the man
[43:16] doesn't feel like he has the respect
[43:19] that he needs in order to operate in
[43:21] that capacity and sometimes a man
[43:24] through his sincerity is reluctant to
[43:26] assume that role because it's going to
[43:27] look as if he's either being told or
[43:30] he's
[43:32] overpowering and men have to have the
[43:34] grace to be able to assume that and step
[43:37] into their place and women we they
[43:40] we they them women
[43:44] yans the Royal the women need to have a
[43:48] sensitivity to say Lord I want my
[43:50] husband to take that place but I can't
[43:53] demand it I can't create the wrong kind
[43:55] of of environment and I need to yield
[43:57] and pray and just as him being reverence
[44:00] coaxes reverence out of me maybe if I
[44:03] yield and I pray it'll bring out Ser the
[44:07] the the servitude of a husband the
[44:08] servitude of a father because that's
[44:11] what a man is called to do a man is
[44:13] called to pick up the woman and put her
[44:15] in her place not stand off to the side
[44:17] and point and say you get here and if
[44:19] there's a way that you yield and pray
[44:21] you're actually mirroring something
[44:23] that's within him to yield and to serve
[44:26] to get beneath because a real man of God
[44:28] is going to oh God help me to say it the
[44:30] right way he's able to get lower than
[44:33] the
[44:34] woman and pick her up and she's not the
[44:37] one that needs to stoop the lowest to
[44:40] lift everything up you're the one at the
[44:41] end of the day that can get the lowest
[44:44] to pick it
[44:50] up I think that uh I hope I hope that
[44:54] you're listening to that
[45:07] now can we take an anonymous poll maybe
[45:11] somehow I just I'm torn here and and
[45:13] whether or not I should just stop at
[45:16] this go forward don't say anything don't
[45:18] nod I'm not even looking at you this
[45:19] isn't I'm not
[45:24] pandering
[45:27] was that was awfully
[45:30] quiet Luke chap 22: 22- 27 I can go
[45:34] through this at a reasonable pace and be
[45:36] done here
[45:37] soon now this is this is looking back
[45:39] even to what was happening in Matthew
[45:41] chapter 20 because it's uh he's going to
[45:43] he's going to use the same language and
[45:44] you'll recognize the companionship of
[45:46] this and there was also Strife among
[45:47] them the disciples which of them should
[45:49] be accounted the
[45:52] greatest they're they're they're arguing
[45:54] amongst each other who's better
[45:57] who's greater I wish they would spent
[45:59] more time telling us but obviously maybe
[46:01] it's it's in maybe some of these
[46:03] disciples best interest not to tell us
[46:06] and he said unto them the kings of the
[46:08] Gentiles exercise lordship over them
[46:11] who's the greatest and they're talking
[46:12] I'm I'm the greatest you're no I think
[46:14] you're the
[46:15] greatest he says and so he kind of says
[46:18] where does this what is this attitude
[46:20] like this is an attitude of people who
[46:21] are unhinged from headship themselves
[46:24] the Gentiles exercise lordship over them
[46:26] and they that exercise Authority upon
[46:27] them are called
[46:29] benefactors right cuz what does it flow
[46:31] up
[46:32] to they are it's uh they are the
[46:36] beneficiaries you serve me is what he's
[46:38] saying but ye shall not be so this is
[46:41] not the way it shall be for you
[46:43] disciples this is not the way it is in
[46:44] my kingdom but he that is greatest among
[46:46] you let him be as the
[46:49] youngero right because don't we always
[46:51] really talk about the elders you know
[46:53] I'm an elder you listen to me I'm your
[46:54] boss right this is the way he says but
[46:56] you know let the one who's greatest let
[46:57] him be younger and he that is Chief as
[46:59] he that doth serve this is totally
[47:02] different and I'm using these as a as a
[47:05] way to point to the rule of a man has to
[47:08] mirror this as the man who is the chief
[47:10] the greatest in the head he is to be as
[47:13] the younger he is to be the one that
[47:14] serves for whether is greater he that
[47:16] sth at meat or he that serveth is not he
[47:18] that sth at meat but I am among you is
[47:21] he that
[47:23] serveth and the way he's saying well who
[47:25] is it that's greater at a table the one
[47:27] that's eating or the one that's serving
[47:28] they like well the one that's eating he
[47:29] gets the steak all right he's the one
[47:31] that's eating he says okay all right and
[47:34] I'm the one
[47:35] serving and what does he say that to do
[47:37] for them to be like
[47:40] oh
[47:42] oh just because I'm the one
[47:45] eating wait a minute I wouldn't be
[47:47] eating if you weren't
[47:49] serving wait a minute you're the
[47:51] greatest you're the one this is the way
[47:53] it is in God's Kingdom in Mark chapter
[47:55] 9: 33 to uh maybe we'll just read to
[47:58] verse 33 he says and he come to capernum
[48:02] and being in the house I just love that
[48:04] image because our series is called the
[48:05] house of the Lord here the Lord is in
[48:07] the house and they've been arguing along
[48:10] the way about who's the greatest and he
[48:13] says uh what is it that you guys were
[48:15] arguing about on our way here they're
[48:18] kind of like
[48:19] oh
[48:21] nothing yeah and he says they held their
[48:24] peace for by the way they had disputed
[48:26] among themselves who should be the
[48:28] greatest they're arguing about who's the
[48:31] best who's the greatest who's the
[48:33] strongest who has the most and and Jesus
[48:35] says so what were you guys arguing about
[48:37] and they're kind of
[48:39] like arguing to were we arguing Thomas I
[48:43] wasn't arguing were you huh and Judas is
[48:46] over there going don't look at me right
[48:49] everybody's pointing fingers and he so
[48:51] he sits down nobody says he sits down
[48:53] and he calls the 12 under them and he
[48:54] says if If any man desire to be
[48:57] first the same shall be last of all and
[49:00] servant of
[49:02] all so you realize he's just given him a
[49:05] way to settle the
[49:07] argument who's the
[49:10] greatest the one that serves the
[49:12] most you want to be the greatest serve
[49:15] with all that's in your heart be the
[49:17] last of all be the servant of all in
[49:18] other words if you're you're not the
[49:20] greatest because you can win a game of
[49:21] King of the Hill you're not the greatest
[49:24] because you're stronger because you're
[49:25] smarter because you're older because
[49:26] you've been in it longer you're not the
[49:27] greatest because of all these other
[49:29] things you're great because you've
[49:30] become the servant what is it brother
[49:32] brandham teaches us it came up within
[49:34] our family devotion last night uh one of
[49:36] the children mentioned that brother bam
[49:37] said that a great man makes you feel
[49:40] great a and what makes him a great man
[49:43] the fact that he makes you feel
[49:45] great right that that's really what
[49:47] makes him great a man who has power and
[49:50] that's what he is he's a powerful man
[49:51] he's going to make you feel his power a
[49:53] man that's wealthy that he's going to
[49:55] make you feel that he's wealthy but a
[49:56] man that's great is one despite wealth
[49:59] and power and popularity and everything
[50:01] else he makes you feel great a good man
[50:04] makes you feel
[50:05] good whereas a rich man will make you
[50:07] feel poor and a strong man will make you
[50:10] feel weak a great man will make you feel
[50:13] great if any man desire to be first then
[50:16] just be the servant of all be the last
[50:17] of
[50:18] all and I'll end with this and this will
[50:22] I'm going to use this maybe to segue
[50:25] into Wednesday night next
[50:27] Sunday there's lot that I I I wanted to
[50:30] go this route to close but he says
[50:33] sanctify them Jesus speaking now
[50:34] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[50:37] is truth so this Christ whose head is
[50:40] God the supplication of God sanctify
[50:42] them through truth as thou Hast sent me
[50:44] into the world even so have I sent them
[50:47] into the world now here is the headship
[50:50] of Christ to the body they're going to
[50:52] be sent out into the
[50:54] world and they're going forth to
[50:56] minister they're going forth to serve
[50:57] and he says for their sakes I sanctify
[51:01] myself that they also might be
[51:03] Sanctified through the
[51:05] truth here's one in in in a
[51:09] responsibility that as a head he's
[51:12] asking that those he's leading be
[51:15] Sanctified but he doesn't step out of
[51:17] the way in the sense of so just if you
[51:19] could sanctify them he says I've
[51:21] Sanctified myself he recognizes that if
[51:24] there's going to be a sanctification
[51:26] to those he's leading he himself needs
[51:28] to be Sanctified so I sanctify myself
[51:32] that that they might also be
[51:36] Sanctified let us not use the excuse
[51:38] that we're older uh that we have the
[51:41] Holy Ghost to live UNS Sanctified lives
[51:43] and demand it of our 16year olds who
[51:46] don't even have the Holy Ghost that's
[51:48] right no we can have all sorts of
[51:50] nonsense going on in our lives because
[51:52] you know I'm the man I know how to
[51:53] handle my drugs right I know how to
[51:55] handle my liquor but you young man you
[51:58] shouldn't
[51:59] drink that that it just doesn't work
[52:01] that way he says if I want my home to be
[52:05] Sanctified right if I want my children
[52:08] to be Sanctified if I want to have a a
[52:10] home that's right then this is to me
[52:12] this is the example of the head being a
[52:14] giver and a sanctifier of the body a
[52:16] sanctifier of the wife and the children
[52:18] Christ can be a sanctifier because he
[52:20] Sanctified himself Christ can be a
[52:22] cleanser because he cleansed himself and
[52:25] brother Bram says in God's wrapped G
[52:27] gift he says I think one of the most
[52:28] pathetic words that Jesus ever said was
[52:31] when he said father I sanctify myself
[52:33] that they might be Sanctified quite a
[52:36] statement he says it's pathetic and then
[52:38] he kind of highlights if I could say
[52:40] this before we read this in other words
[52:42] as a man he could do whatever he wanted
[52:45] as a man he had opportunity and power
[52:48] and maybe even the right to indulge and
[52:50] to enjoy certain things but he
[52:52] recognized his role and his
[52:53] responsibility and in light of that
[52:55] great responsibility there's things that
[52:57] he did and did not do in order for those
[53:00] that he was leading in other words he
[53:02] had a right he was a man he had a right
[53:04] to a home he had a right to a family he
[53:07] was a man as much as you are or I am as
[53:10] much a human in his manhood as we are he
[53:12] had a right to it I think there's just
[53:15] this incredible Paradox how that he had
[53:17] a right to those things and Sanctified
[53:19] himself and denied him the privilege of
[53:22] those things so that we could exercise
[53:24] our right role and control in those very
[53:28] [Music]
[53:29] things that if he had somehow was able
[53:33] to marry and have a family I tell you
[53:35] what it would have been a perfect family
[53:37] but you would have never been able to
[53:39] achieve it
[53:41] yourself because in order for you to be
[53:43] in your place he had to do his
[53:45] part he had a right but then notice the
[53:48] statement that he
[53:50] makes he had a right to it but he was
[53:53] training 12 men
[53:55] that we going to take the gospel to all
[53:58] the world so he Sanctified himself for
[54:01] their sake I sanc myself for their sake
[54:04] a gift of God keeping himself
[54:07] Sanctified why because he was training
[54:10] someone he was Raising somebody up they
[54:13] were going to one day leave his training
[54:17] and go into the world and do likewise he
[54:19] said that was what a gift of God did he
[54:21] kept himself
[54:22] Sanctified and with him sanctification
[54:24] we know required sacrifice for us
[54:27] sanctification requires
[54:30] sacrifice and I'll just I'm going to
[54:34] skip I am just going to go ahead and
[54:36] skip things but let me just refer to it
[54:38] a father
[54:40] is a priest of the
[54:44] home so he must be Sanctified
[54:47] first as the
[54:52] headen and let me put it this way if we
[54:55] could say this musicians if you'd come
[54:57] if we could say it this way men our duty
[55:02] first our duty first not to demand
[55:06] reverence from our wives but I have a
[55:08] duty to be
[55:10] reverent not to demand submission from
[55:13] our wise but I have a duty to love not
[55:16] to demand obedience from our children
[55:19] but I have a duty to encourage to
[55:22] nourish my duty
[55:26] first let me say this a clean man is the
[55:30] best way to keep the family
[55:32] clean we sanctify ourselves that they
[55:35] might
[55:37] be Jesus said these words I sanctify
[55:41] myself that they might be Sanctified
[55:43] through the truth and then Paul comes
[55:45] later and he says let a man love his
[55:49] wife love even her as his own
[55:54] body and a man nourishes and cherishes
[55:57] himself Christ Sanctified his own body
[55:59] and he he's given us this image and how
[56:01] did Christ ever how did he even begin he
[56:04] Sanctified
[56:07] himself in the sermon the way of a true
[56:09] Prophet brother bam says a real man or
[56:11] woman that's born of the spirit of God
[56:12] will set hour after hour drinking in the
[56:15] word of God wait a minute what am I
[56:16] skipping for we're in the after hour a
[56:21] real man or woman that's born of the
[56:22] spirit of God will set hour after hour
[56:24] dream thinking in the word of God and
[56:26] then I love this part not only that you
[56:29] know some people just like to itch their
[56:30] ears with message theology he says but
[56:32] not only that but when it hits there it
[56:34] anchors and changes the
[56:37] life a real man or woman that's born of
[56:39] the spirit of God will listen to the
[56:40] word and the word can hit here and
[56:43] anchor and change their life so he says
[56:46] it's our people's desires our whole
[56:48] setup's corrupted and decayed it's our
[56:50] people's
[56:52] wants he says you take a good good man a
[56:56] good man put him in a family that's a
[56:58] bunch of pleasure
[56:59] lovers they'll lead that man a dog's
[57:02] life or good woman either one put them
[57:05] in a family that's mixed
[57:08] up it's out of order it's chaotic things
[57:13] aren't in the proper alignment he says
[57:14] take a good man or a good woman you put
[57:17] him in the wrong kind of family Dynamic
[57:19] he said to lead a dog's
[57:21] life he'll become
[57:23] corrupted they'll lead that man a dog's
[57:27] life because the family
[57:30] order isn't
[57:33] right this is exactly what he's saying a
[57:36] good man in the wrong place in the wrong
[57:38] in his in the wrong atmosphere in the
[57:40] wrong home good kids really good kids
[57:43] can be uh rough necks and delinquents
[57:46] and and bullies and all sorts of things
[57:48] and we're like man that kid just got a
[57:49] mean streak and that kid this man that
[57:51] kid that we're all we're all can't wait
[57:53] till the kid can just go to college
[57:55] somewhere else right and you realize the
[57:57] it's he's a product of his
[57:59] home he's a good kid at heart good women
[58:03] at heart even h a good men but in a home
[58:06] that's mixed up we lead dog
[58:08] lives and then he makes this beautiful
[58:10] statement why the whole family should
[58:12] surrender to God it's our business men
[58:16] take this me my duty first it's our
[58:18] business to pray till our children are
[58:20] saved keep our house in order if I can
[58:22] say this way it's our business to keep
[58:24] our house in order and I can't stand off
[58:27] out of place and all disjointed over
[58:29] here and like I know I'm out of my place
[58:31] but you need to get in your
[58:33] place I need to take my place and it's
[58:36] my business to keep the house in order
[58:38] it's in my business to pray till the
[58:39] children Sav don't stop praying until
[58:41] they're saved we can should continue to
[58:43] believe and speak a language that's
[58:45] positive whether it be about our spouses
[58:47] whether it be about our children be
[58:49] positive believe all things are possible
[58:51] but do as it says here drink the word of
[58:54] God and let let it hit anchor and change
[58:56] your life change your desires so that we
[58:58] can be in the right place to affect
[59:02] others and I hope this doesn't stand too
[59:05] far out of place as we close on this
[59:08] this image Christ the head the chief the
[59:10] greatest the rabbi the master and he
[59:12] says you call me master he says you've
[59:14] said well because that's exactly what I
[59:17] am but as he was coming to the end as he
[59:20] had Sanctified himself as he had denied
[59:22] himself as he was coming to fulfill his
[59:25] calling as a lamb to give his life
[59:27] they're sitting down they're partaking
[59:29] in dinner and the Bible says in John
[59:31] Chapter 13 he rose from supper laid
[59:34] aside his garments and no she's
[59:35] stripping
[59:37] himself in this act of
[59:39] humility say that I will not be judged
[59:42] by how I dress I will not be judged by
[59:44] any Any Garment that may suggest I'm a
[59:46] master that may suggest I'm a rabbi I'm
[59:48] going to lay myself be so that you see
[59:51] me as a
[59:52] man and he took a towel inured
[59:56] himself and he poured water into a
[59:59] basin and began to
[1:00:02] wash the disciples
[1:00:04] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[1:00:07] that he had girded himself
[1:00:10] with this is the man in the
[1:00:14] home at a table if at that very moment
[1:00:18] those that Judas had uh conspired with
[1:00:20] had arrived into this room to seize the
[1:00:24] Messiah
[1:00:25] and at that very moment Christ was
[1:00:27] kneeling with the towel GED about him
[1:00:29] washing someone's feet they would have
[1:00:31] never considered the foot washed flunky
[1:00:34] who was kneeling before a
[1:00:36] basin they would have looked at the man
[1:00:37] whose feet were being washed they would
[1:00:39] have looked for the man at the head of
[1:00:40] the table not the one
[1:00:41] serving not the one
[1:00:44] kneeling to me this affords to us the
[1:00:47] greatest example of what it means to be
[1:00:48] the greatest is we're willing to kneel
[1:00:52] and to perform the duty of washing
[1:00:55] it wasn't Christ who made those feet
[1:00:58] dirty it wasn't necessarily his own
[1:01:00] biddings and his own leading and
[1:01:02] Direction perhaps it made those feet
[1:01:04] dirty but he took responsibility for
[1:01:07] washing their feet as the head and I
[1:01:10] believe that's the role and
[1:01:11] responsibility that the man of the home
[1:01:13] has is to be the one that can kneel and
[1:01:16] to wash his wife's
[1:01:19] feet to serve his
[1:01:21] children it's in the man of the home
[1:01:26] a clean man is the best way to have a
[1:01:29] clean
[1:01:30] home I acknowledge the uh I don't want
[1:01:34] to say the loftiness of this but I I
[1:01:37] acknowledge the High
[1:01:38] Calling um someone was testifying to me
[1:01:42] that you know after hearing these
[1:01:45] Services you go home and you're you're
[1:01:47] you're so busy analyzing and
[1:01:48] scrutinizing your own lives you don't
[1:01:50] have time to talk and gossip about other
[1:01:52] people and I actually felt kind of bad
[1:01:55] if it's if it's coming out so
[1:01:58] challenging to where there's no
[1:02:00] encouragement in
[1:02:01] it but let me say it this way this is
[1:02:05] this is who you are yes this is what you
[1:02:08] can do no matter how much you've been
[1:02:10] told no matter how much the example's
[1:02:12] been the opposite God has called you and
[1:02:15] equipped you as men you feel it in you
[1:02:17] you know this is what you're called to
[1:02:19] if you maybe you don't feel that you're
[1:02:20] good this at this maybe you don't feel
[1:02:22] you're good at that but as the man God
[1:02:24] is equipping you God has put this in you
[1:02:28] God wants to bring it out of you and
[1:02:30] there's so much that the the world and
[1:02:32] situations and circumstances try to Bow
[1:02:34] us down like well I can never recover I
[1:02:36] can never do this I can never be
[1:02:37] reverenced I can never take the
[1:02:39] spiritual lead yes you
[1:02:40] can and and maybe the way that you say
[1:02:43] you can't is the wrong image that you
[1:02:45] feel that you have to get rid of that
[1:02:47] idea of being the strong Burly man who
[1:02:51] presents himself to the family as I'm
[1:02:53] the head everybody kneel and pray it's
[1:02:55] time for devotions but find a way just
[1:02:57] to get beneath everybody else and and
[1:03:00] lead by example and steering them in the
[1:03:03] right direction and begin just as
[1:03:05] brother brandham did without opening his
[1:03:06] mouth and laying hands on his wife and
[1:03:08] Away rebuke this evil spirit and I'm
[1:03:10] going to take control of this home in
[1:03:12] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:03:13] just begin to contact he begin to serve
[1:03:15] he begin to Humble himself he said the
[1:03:16] atmosphere changed it's in us as men to
[1:03:20] lead just as much as it's in our sisters
[1:03:22] to submit or to follow or to reverent
[1:03:25] therefore we call to that which God has
[1:03:27] already placed inside of us and say Lord
[1:03:29] make me the man that I'm supposed to be
[1:03:31] I want to be this kind of
[1:03:35] man not one that's flipping over
[1:03:38] tables and the temple or the one that's
[1:03:42] walking on water but I want to be the
[1:03:44] one who can kneel before even his own
[1:03:47] disciples and the one he's training and
[1:03:49] leading and say I've Sanctified myself
[1:03:51] so that you can be
[1:03:53] sanctified not in a self-righteous
[1:03:55] Manner and say well you know look what
[1:03:57] I'm giving up but this acknowledgement
[1:03:59] recognition that I love you I love you
[1:04:01] for who you are what God's called you to
[1:04:03] be and all the potential that's in you
[1:04:05] and I want you to I want you to know the
[1:04:06] blessedness that I have I want you to be
[1:04:08] free I want you to be pleasing to the
[1:04:10] Lord and out of love I can humble myself
[1:04:12] and sanctify myself and nurture and
[1:04:14] cherish and do all these things that I
[1:04:16] know I ought to do because it's in me
[1:04:19] and I want you to
[1:04:20] succeed I think it's a beautiful picture
[1:04:22] I should just stop there could you stand
[1:04:25] today with me
