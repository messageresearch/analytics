[0:00] that's a reference to a feast of the
[0:02] booths Feast of Tabernacles it was a
[0:04] time of rejoicing in worship and that's
[0:06] why they were not to be weeping they
[0:07] were not to be sorrowful because it was
[0:09] not the season four were continuous part
[0:14] um six I believe of the joy of our
[0:16] salvation
[0:18] and
[0:20] the title today is name calling and I
[0:23] think that's kind of uh would be a
[0:25] subject that could have a lot of breadth
[0:26] to it a lot of different applications
[0:28] but the subject is name calling and in
[0:31] doing so and looking at this over the
[0:32] last few Services we've been looking at
[0:34] or identifying the right cause for our
[0:37] joy and not just the right cause the
[0:40] things that would make us joyful but
[0:41] also the right object of our joy the
[0:44] things that we joy in the things that we
[0:46] are happy about and we use that quite a
[0:48] bit I think in the sermon cause and
[0:50] effect we were looking at what causes
[0:52] our joy but then actually Joy has an
[0:54] object it's something that we direct it
[0:55] towards and last Sunday this is what
[0:58] we're picking up on mostly is our
[1:00] service last Sunday on tis the season
[1:01] we're living in a specific season of
[1:04] prophetic fulfillment at the right time
[1:07] or right moment when we talk about a
[1:09] season and we need to recognize the time
[1:11] that we're living in the scriptures that
[1:13] God is fulfilling even the promise that
[1:16] he has made that he's to fulfill in this
[1:18] hour if you're looking for God to do
[1:20] something in the season that it's not
[1:21] his time to do it or the time that he
[1:23] has not prophesied it to happen that
[1:25] leads to our disappointment that leads
[1:27] towards shame it leads to sadness but
[1:29] when we know what he's to do in its
[1:31] season and what the right time is then
[1:33] we can trust in him and look to it and
[1:36] so when we look at our season of Joy
[1:38] last week we're looking at how that God
[1:40] will rejoicing in what God is doing
[1:41] presently even as Peter Rhodey desired
[1:44] that they'd be established in the
[1:45] present truth and so we rejoice in what
[1:47] God is doing presently and because of
[1:50] that it's not an irrational exuberance
[1:51] it's not baseless enthusiasm we see what
[1:54] God is doing we recognize it in the
[1:56] moment that we're living in and we have
[1:57] a basis for joy we have a basis for our
[1:59] excitement
[2:00] and there's a number of statements I
[2:01] found myself just collecting in the
[2:04] message of the hour and I started just
[2:05] putting them in my notes and after a
[2:07] while I realized this could just go on
[2:09] in perpetuity so we'll just make
[2:12] reference to it that you can look it up
[2:13] yourself and you can listen for it as
[2:15] you listen to the message of the hour
[2:16] brother bam says a lot about in its
[2:19] season there's certain scriptures he
[2:20] said man shall not live by bread alone
[2:21] but every word that proceeds to have a
[2:23] mouth of God in its season he says that
[2:26] uh the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[2:27] against it in its season there's a lot
[2:29] of scripture that he places with this
[2:31] thought of in its season and so it's
[2:33] important to recognize the right season
[2:35] and God interprets his word by
[2:37] vindicating it the word in its season so
[2:40] if you're looking for the Vindication of
[2:42] something the fruit of something if it's
[2:43] not the season for it it's not going to
[2:45] happen so you want to see it happen in
[2:47] its season and then this statement here
[2:49] to me is just perfect to tie in what we
[2:51] preached on Wednesday night on his
[2:53] coming or the Advent in spiritual food
[2:55] and due season this is the sermon he
[2:57] preached in the evening after he
[2:59] preached trying to do God service
[3:00] without it being his will he said but
[3:02] thanks be to God we've got hidden food
[3:04] it's spiritual food that we're living on
[3:07] the goodness and mercy of the revelation
[3:10] of Jesus Christ in these last days
[3:12] vindicating himself among his people
[3:15] that's the time that we're living in
[3:16] we're living off the goodness and mercy
[3:18] of the revelation of Jesus Christ the
[3:21] revelation of Jesus Christ the Greek
[3:22] word for Revelation is apocalypse I mean
[3:24] it's translated to coming it means
[3:26] manifestation and so just don't think
[3:29] Revelation is something that pops in
[3:30] your head like aha there's something
[3:32] very real very literal to it we're
[3:34] living on the goodness and mercy of the
[3:37] revelation of Jesus Christ in the last
[3:39] days that's what we're living on we're
[3:41] living in a time where he's promised to
[3:43] reveal himself he's promised to manifest
[3:45] himself and he's promised to do in a
[3:47] very particular way and that's when we
[3:48] ended on Wednesday night how brother
[3:50] random even as he comes to the preaches
[3:52] the church ages and he's going to preach
[3:53] the seals he finishes the church age
[3:56] summation up with and may his coming
[3:58] Rejoice your heart that there's
[4:01] something that ought to give us courage
[4:03] especially in light of all the negative
[4:04] things that can be said about laodicea
[4:06] especially in light of all the dark
[4:07] things that are happening in the world
[4:09] and all the challenges that we're facing
[4:10] economics and physical and health and
[4:13] all the things that press upon us we do
[4:15] have something that is sure and
[4:17] steadfast that we can rejoice in and
[4:19] that's what the prophet's trying to
[4:21] point us to not just the the darkness of
[4:23] laodicea but the light that has come to
[4:25] us at the open of the word
[4:27] now in Nehemiah chapter 8 we went
[4:29] through these verses in great detail
[4:31] before we're going to come at it again
[4:32] in a little bit different angle but
[4:34] still picking up on Revelations 5 and
[4:37] Revelations 10.
[4:38] but the word when it was open as we
[4:41] looked at these verses it was open
[4:42] during what the Bible called the season
[4:44] of our joy specific time of worship and
[4:48] praise one of the feasts and they the
[4:50] book is opened up and they start to weep
[4:52] and cry but they're told no this is a
[4:55] season of Joy this is a season of
[4:56] gladness and they make great mirth and
[4:58] so God planned he looked out over and
[5:01] orchestrated that this book that had
[5:03] been lost to them would be opened at a
[5:05] time of rejoicing because that's what
[5:07] the open of the book signifies the time
[5:09] of worship a time of rejoicing and a
[5:12] time of Praise so it holds a type for
[5:13] all of us and we read it in Deuteronomy
[5:16] chapter 16 verse 15 for seven days you
[5:18] were to celebrate in the presence of the
[5:20] Lord your God at the place where the
[5:22] Lord will choose because the Lord your
[5:24] God will bless you in all your Harvest
[5:26] and everything you do and your joy will
[5:29] be complete I don't know about you but I
[5:31] don't want a half Joy I don't want a
[5:33] quarter joint say well I'll just get
[5:35] whatever Joy I can get well I see where
[5:36] it's promised the fullness of joy so I'm
[5:39] just going to be a little greedy and say
[5:40] I want fullness of joy I want complete
[5:43] Joy because I see the Promise in the
[5:45] word of God and that's what I desire and
[5:47] so this is a scripture referring to that
[5:49] season of praise and worship and joy at
[5:51] the Feast of Booth Feast of the
[5:52] Tabernacles the time when this book is
[5:54] being opened and so that's what they
[5:57] were called to in the moment that the
[5:59] book was being restored and so I'm
[6:02] looking at Nehemiah chapter 8 and I see
[6:04] it holds a type in light of Revelations
[6:06] chapter 5 in Revelations chapter 10 the
[6:08] promises for our day in the last Sunday
[6:11] we identified several places in the
[6:13] message of the hour brother Brian was
[6:14] pointing to Revelations 10 Revelations 5
[6:15] unfolding under his ministry says that
[6:18] Ezra opened the book on the side of all
[6:19] the people and when he opened it all the
[6:22] people stood up in verse 5 there
[6:23] Nehemiah 8 this is what's transpired in
[6:25] their time and it says that they the the
[6:27] Levites and the priests they gave sense
[6:30] to what was being read and they caused
[6:32] them to understand the eating these are
[6:33] all the things that are transpiring in
[6:36] this season of joy
[6:37] and then verses 11 and 12 is where I'd
[6:40] like to is to read these together it
[6:42] says and so the Levites still all the
[6:44] people saying hold your peace for the
[6:46] day is Holy neither be aggrieved and all
[6:49] the people went their way to eat and to
[6:50] drink and descend portions and to make
[6:52] great mirth because now this you got to
[6:56] recognize the reason for their Joy they
[6:58] weren't just happy because Ezra opened a
[7:00] Dusty book They're not just happy
[7:01] because someone physically did something
[7:04] it's like oh we like it when he does
[7:05] that it just makes us giggle but no
[7:07] there was something to it to make great
[7:09] mirth because they had understood the
[7:12] words that were declared unto them they
[7:14] were making a connection to it it was
[7:16] meaning something to them it was it was
[7:18] inspiring them so they began to make
[7:19] great mirth because they heard what was
[7:23] being said to them so their Joy was
[7:25] caused by understanding
[7:28] and it says they were to eat and to
[7:30] drink and descend portions
[7:33] this is a feasting they're enjoying
[7:35] God's provision as it would coincide
[7:37] with the time of the Harvest these would
[7:39] be things that God had provided by his
[7:41] hand promises that he made and and one
[7:43] thing that was standing out to me if you
[7:45] kind of research it and find what the
[7:48] commandment to send those to those to
[7:50] send portions to those that have not
[7:52] this was something that was written in
[7:54] their law something that was being
[7:55] restored to them and so they were giving
[7:57] what they had received from God they
[7:59] were given it to those who did not have
[8:01] provision who had not received just a
[8:05] tiny with evangelism and sharing what it
[8:07] is that you've received
[8:09] and so I hope that that kind of puts us
[8:11] all on the same basis at least thinking
[8:13] along the same events that we're going
[8:15] to try to tie in to things that have
[8:17] happened in our day and if you'll turn
[8:19] to Jeremiah chapter 15. I'd like to read
[8:21] verse 16 and and this will be kind of
[8:24] our launching point for where our hearts
[8:26] are today
[8:29] and if you could be very
[8:32] uh great attention to what is being said
[8:35] if you get a little bit tired or you
[8:37] need to get a drink of water I'm talking
[8:39] to the adults the kids just need to stay
[8:40] right where they are you make an
[8:42] announcement that you're welcome to use
[8:44] the water fountain there'll be a line of
[8:45] you know five to 12 year olds uh
[8:48] standing there for the rest of the
[8:49] service but no if you if you need to
[8:51] kind of wake yourself do so but I really
[8:53] ask that you just pay close attention to
[8:55] what we're sharing I I this to me this
[8:58] is just personal these are some things
[8:59] I've been studying on for a number of
[9:00] years that God's just allowed me to
[9:02] share at this time and to me it would be
[9:04] one of the most important things I've
[9:06] ever ministered and so I hope that you
[9:08] can stay pay very close attention to
[9:10] what's being shared and so in Jeremiah
[9:12] chapter 15 verse 16 it says thy words
[9:15] were found think of that parallel now we
[9:17] want to think about each catch each
[9:19] element in this verse and maybe apply it
[9:22] to what's been restored to us from this
[9:24] day and also how they must have been
[9:26] feeling in the book of Nehemiah and the
[9:27] Book of Ezra thy words were found which
[9:29] means to be present and and to be
[9:32] possessed you're presently with them thy
[9:34] words were found and I did eat them
[9:37] now there's this image then of a word
[9:40] being eaten and the Bible speaks of it
[9:42] in different places how there's this
[9:43] type of eating the scroll and eating the
[9:45] word and eating this these things that
[9:47] were found in Thy Word was unto me the
[9:49] joy and rejoicing of my heart this is
[9:53] something that ought to be instructive
[9:54] to us that the word is the joy and
[9:56] rejoice and of our heart not temporal
[9:58] things not just churchianity not just
[10:00] things of the world or not things of the
[10:02] world that God would bless us with but
[10:04] his word is unto us the joy and
[10:07] rejoicing of my heart for I am called by
[10:10] thy name
[10:11] oh lord of hosts and so we want to
[10:15] make spiritual application to the season
[10:17] that we're in look at this verse and use
[10:19] it as kind of a type and phrases that
[10:22] apply to the time that we're living in
[10:24] because we're living in a season of the
[10:26] Fulfillment of scripture Luke 17 30 the
[10:29] day in this when the son of man is
[10:30] revealed we're living in the hour of
[10:32] Revelations chapter 10 in the time of
[10:34] first Thessalonians 4. there's a lot of
[10:36] scriptures we could use that brother
[10:37] Branham pointed us to says this is where
[10:39] you're living this is where you're
[10:40] living and so this verse uses a language
[10:43] that connects in and ties in to the very
[10:46] things that have been fulfilled in the
[10:48] time that we're living in we know in
[10:50] Revelations chapter 10 verses 7 to 11 as
[10:53] it speaks in the days of the voice of
[10:54] the seventh angel uh when he shall begin
[10:57] to sound that the mystery of God's going
[10:58] to be finished and then it comes to John
[11:01] he says the angel tells him go go to him
[11:03] that has the book and so he goes to him
[11:06] he says give me the little book and what
[11:08] does the angel say take it and eat it up
[11:10] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[11:13] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[11:14] there's a lot of things that we could
[11:16] Minister on how it's sweet to taste and
[11:18] bitter in the application and bitter in
[11:19] the processing but it says if my mouth
[11:22] sweet is honey and says I took the
[11:23] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[11:25] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[11:26] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[11:28] my belly was bitter in other words you
[11:30] can count on what this Angel says it
[11:32] will happen
[11:33] exactly what he said the word will do to
[11:35] you it'll happen just exactly if you do
[11:37] what he tells you to do there's a lot
[11:39] that we can glean from this and he said
[11:40] unto me now notice now John and we'll
[11:43] see this later John has made
[11:44] declarations John has uh uh he is coming
[11:47] to the end of his life even but now as
[11:49] he takes this there's something said to
[11:52] him that is expressing what this word
[11:54] must do to us in the end time thou must
[11:57] prophesy again before many peoples and
[11:59] Nations and tongues and kings
[12:01] so we are to Feast upon the contents of
[12:04] the book and not be selfish with it but
[12:07] just as they were to do in the days of
[12:09] Nehemiah send portions to those who do
[12:11] not have and so we are to eat the book
[12:14] but there were to prophesy again it's an
[12:18] echoing it's it's something sounding out
[12:19] again you're to declare and manifest
[12:21] again and so we have this responsibility
[12:24] and so you can see this parallel to
[12:26] Jeremiah 15 thy words were found and I
[12:29] did eat them and the word that I'm
[12:31] eating on became the joy and rejoicing
[12:33] of my heart for I am called by thy name
[12:36] this is we want to see this verse
[12:39] holding significance to what God is
[12:41] doing in this hour and he says I did eat
[12:44] them just like John ate the words was to
[12:47] take the book and eat it
[12:49] now
[12:51] this phrase here
[12:53] Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoice
[12:55] in of my heart
[12:57] because now
[13:00] he says because he was called by thy
[13:02] name O Lord of hosts so there's a reason
[13:04] he's actually given a reason why his
[13:07] heart is thrilled by joy and rejoice in
[13:09] my heart is your word but not just not
[13:13] just because the word sake because I was
[13:16] called I am called by thy name the the
[13:19] phrasing actually means named by thy
[13:21] name means you have chosen me to Bear
[13:24] your name you have had me to Bear your
[13:27] name I have been chosen by you now
[13:31] there's the key if you can just grab a
[13:33] hold of that when I say this is maybe
[13:34] one of the most important things I've
[13:36] ever ministered there's the key right
[13:38] there because there's so much
[13:40] misunderstanding about what it means to
[13:41] be named and what it means to hear your
[13:42] name what it means to call a name and we
[13:45] need to have very some Precision in the
[13:47] word of God in the message of the hour
[13:48] to recognize the significance of a name
[13:51] being called and so it says I am called
[13:54] by thy name I have now bear your name I
[13:57] have been named by your name or I have
[13:59] been chosen by by you
[14:01] so when he says that your words were
[14:04] found and I did eat them this is this is
[14:06] describing some sort of action your word
[14:08] is open to me and I'm eating it and then
[14:10] the understanding that is comes to him
[14:12] as he eats this is I am happy and I'm
[14:15] thrilled because I have been chosen and
[14:18] I now bear your name that through this
[14:20] process of opening unfolding in
[14:22] Revelation and me becoming a part of it
[14:24] I recognize that you have chosen me to
[14:27] Bear your name you've chosen me to sound
[14:29] out your truth you've chosen me to
[14:31] manifestly declare the full word so this
[14:33] is what is happening in Jeremiah this is
[14:35] even what is represented in John taking
[14:38] the contents of the book and as he eats
[14:40] it then he becomes a part of it and
[14:43] let's just put it this way if if John
[14:45] eats the book and the book isn't any
[14:47] more then it becomes a part of him and
[14:49] he becomes the only access to the
[14:51] contents of it as he prophesies it again
[14:56] so to be called by a name this is a
[14:59] focus on this part to be called by a
[15:01] name is an act of identifying something
[15:04] but it's not just an act of
[15:06] identification though that to me holds
[15:08] maybe the greatest weight but it's also
[15:10] an act of possessing and claiming
[15:12] something he says I have been chosen to
[15:15] Bear your name he has been possessed by
[15:17] and taken possession by God to where now
[15:19] he is not his own but he's the Lord's
[15:22] it's an act of placing someone in their
[15:24] position or calling I've been called by
[15:26] thy name you've placed me you've
[15:27] identified me you've chosen me you've
[15:29] possessed me you've placed me these are
[15:31] all things that relate to caught being
[15:34] called by a name
[15:36] so my title of name calling or wanting
[15:39] to look at very intently are the
[15:42] principles in the scripture to better
[15:44] understand what it means to be called by
[15:46] his name
[15:47] or what it means to have your name
[15:49] called
[15:51] to better understand this in Revelations
[15:54] chapter 5 verse 1 it says and I saw on
[15:56] the right hand of him that sat on the
[15:57] throne a book written within and on the
[15:59] back side sealed with Seven Seals this
[16:02] sealed book holds something significant
[16:04] to Heaven and Earth
[16:05] and it is and it is the impossibility of
[16:09] these contents being revealed that made
[16:10] John weep is that not right it says
[16:13] who's worth it open the book it says
[16:15] well we looked on Earth we looked around
[16:16] and no man was found worthy to take the
[16:18] book and to loose the seals thereof not
[16:19] even worthy to look at it and so it
[16:22] wasn't just the fact that no one stepped
[16:24] forward to take it that caused John to
[16:26] weep but it was the fact that what was
[16:27] in that book was very very important it
[16:30] was the book of redemption it held the
[16:32] mystery of the Lamb's Book of Life
[16:34] brother Branham says here he stands
[16:36] holding his right hand over his heart
[16:38] where the hidden secrets of redemption
[16:40] had been hid since the foundation of the
[16:42] world that's what signified in the scene
[16:45] the very secrets of redemption have been
[16:48] hid since the foundation of the world
[16:50] and in verse 6 it says and I beheld and
[16:52] lo in the midst of the Throne of the
[16:53] four beasts in the midst of the elders
[16:54] stood a lamb as it had been slain
[16:56] because there's announcement wheat not
[16:58] the lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[17:00] prevailed having seven horns and seven
[17:02] eyes which are the seven spirits of God
[17:04] sent forth and all the Earth and he came
[17:06] and took the book out of the right hand
[17:08] of him that sat upon the throne what a
[17:11] statement
[17:13] he came brother remember says the most
[17:14] Sublime thing in scripture it's a
[17:16] Sublime act so this is an ape this is a
[17:18] peak this is the climax of redemption he
[17:21] comes and he takes the book and he came
[17:23] and took the book out of the right hand
[17:25] of him that sat upon the throne that's
[17:27] the image we want to have in our minds
[17:28] is now this is redemption's claim he's
[17:32] coming forward to take the book to grasp
[17:34] this book
[17:35] and when this happens I think we pointed
[17:37] this out last Sunday at the time that
[17:39] John is weeping he is told and this is
[17:42] an accurate statement I weep not for the
[17:44] lion of the trabajuda hath prevailed to
[17:47] take the book and to loose the seals
[17:48] thereof so who opened the book The Lion
[17:53] that is his present designation that is
[17:55] what he is that is what he looks like
[17:57] listen if you even look at that um when
[18:00] he made the appearance and he put the
[18:01] sign in the sky of the cloud when you
[18:03] look at the cloud of this guy looks like
[18:05] a lion's mane I it not just look at it
[18:08] and see in a wigged one an authority a
[18:09] supreme judges brother bam identifies it
[18:11] but it also identifies the fact that he
[18:13] is now being identified as a lion
[18:17] so when John looks and he sees who has
[18:20] done this he's described as he sees the
[18:23] lamb as it had been slain now don't let
[18:25] appearance fool you
[18:27] it's the lamb that had been slain but
[18:29] now he's a lion
[18:30] and so it's important to catch the
[18:32] identification change from lamb to lion
[18:35] we need to recognize that in in verse
[18:37] verse 5 to verse 6 how there has been a
[18:40] change
[18:41] now in verse 13 we're going to read this
[18:44] and what I want us to recognize is that
[18:46] John's fault John's response to this is
[18:49] directly connected to the open of the
[18:51] book in Revelations 5 13. this is cause
[18:53] and effect
[18:55] as as in every creature which is in
[18:56] heaven and on Earth and under the Earth
[18:58] and such as are in the sea and all that
[19:00] are in them heard I saying blessing and
[19:03] honor and glory and power be unto him
[19:06] that sitteth upon the throne under the
[19:08] lamb forever and ever
[19:10] I recall that when John is to take the
[19:12] book and to eat the book and when he
[19:14] takes the book it eats it he said that
[19:15] must prophesy again before many peoples
[19:17] Nations tongues and kings in other words
[19:19] it has this description where it's going
[19:21] to make it circuits around the earth you
[19:23] must prophesy what you have just eaten
[19:25] of and now he says you prophesy again
[19:27] and what made me think of this is that
[19:29] John has already rejoiced and shouted
[19:32] and the whole earth heard him
[19:34] he says and he says blessing and honor
[19:36] and glory and power be unto him that
[19:37] sitteth upon the throne and of the Lamb
[19:39] forever and ever this is John's response
[19:42] to the seals being opened
[19:45] so what prompted his Jubilation what
[19:47] what prompted his rejoicing not just the
[19:50] fact the seals are open not just the act
[19:52] of the Lamb taking the book but what it
[19:54] declared and what it meant
[19:56] just as it says thy words were found and
[19:58] I did eat them and Thy Word was unto me
[20:00] the joy and rejoicing of my heart it
[20:02] wasn't just because the book was found
[20:04] but it was because you called me by thy
[20:07] name
[20:09] and John's rejoicing has something to do
[20:12] with name calling
[20:14] in the breach brother Branham says what
[20:15] a jubilee going on in heaven when the
[20:18] lamb leaves that intercessory box to
[20:20] come here to possess his claim now when
[20:22] he makes that statement intercessory box
[20:24] maybe we actually picture a literal box
[20:26] that Christ is is in to intercede
[20:30] that we need to recognize dispensations
[20:32] and moments when God is doing something
[20:35] so now he says what a jubilee is taking
[20:38] place in heaven when the lamb leaves
[20:40] that to come here to possess his claim
[20:43] now for some people that would be a
[20:45] moment of weeping wait he's not
[20:47] interceding anymore but he's actually
[20:48] saying it's actually a time of rejoicing
[20:51] when he does this to possess his claim
[20:53] he says you know that God next to John
[20:56] right that meaning that I think I've
[20:58] really got him excited he got next got
[21:00] beside himself
[21:02] he must have saw his name wrote there
[21:06] when the seals broke he must have got
[21:08] real happy
[21:10] but why brother Branham is making these
[21:12] statements they might seem to be just uh
[21:14] maybe filler or just him kind of uh you
[21:17] know
[21:20] amplifying what what has been said and
[21:22] maybe taking some Liberty with it but
[21:24] this is not just a one-time statement
[21:26] that he kind of just says it and kind of
[21:28] passing oh he got really excited he must
[21:30] have seen his name just as an aside this
[21:32] might be the most important commentary
[21:34] about it
[21:35] because John's getting really excited
[21:37] and John's rejoicing but the question is
[21:39] why is John getting all happy why is
[21:41] John shouting why is John praising why
[21:43] is there Jubilation going on in heaven
[21:45] and for John it's personal he's just not
[21:48] excited because the Angels got excited
[21:50] he's not just rejoicing because the
[21:51] elders Rejoice this is something
[21:53] personal to John and so the opening of
[21:56] the sealed book declared if we could say
[21:58] it this way declare John's John's name
[22:00] in such a way that when the book was
[22:02] open he got happy because he saw his
[22:04] name
[22:05] so his name is identified in the open of
[22:08] this book and now if I could say this
[22:10] about John but I want to say this about
[22:12] us it's not our understanding of History
[22:15] it's not our connection with history
[22:17] it's not just an event that we're
[22:20] excited about oh isn't this a neat event
[22:22] oh like maybe we celebrate uh certain
[22:24] holidays because this is the day that
[22:26] somebody did this and we celebrate
[22:27] something because this is the day that
[22:28] this happened and it's merely an
[22:30] acknowledgment of the historical fact
[22:32] this is John's rejoicing is not in an
[22:35] event John's rejoicing is not in
[22:37] something just just had just transpired
[22:40] but for him there was a personal
[22:42] identification in Christ
[22:45] something happened and now he's
[22:46] personally getting caught up into saying
[22:48] wow if this isn't for anyone else this
[22:50] is for me
[22:51] how many of you ever told a preacher
[22:52] that right
[22:54] he said that probably wasn't for anyone
[22:56] else that was just for me and you and we
[22:59] say that why because we so identify with
[23:01] it that sometimes we're just so sure
[23:03] that that was so chopped up and uh messy
[23:06] and so hard to understand but I caught
[23:07] something so it must have only been for
[23:10] me all right there's times when you
[23:11] think there's just this is only for me
[23:13] I'm the only one that got anything out
[23:14] of this is and there's got to be a
[23:16] personal identification and that's
[23:18] what's happening with John it's not
[23:20] history it's not an event it's exactly
[23:21] what Jesus is wanting Mary and Martha to
[23:23] recognize at the resurrection of Lazarus
[23:26] is they're looking for an event
[23:28] a future event that once it transpires
[23:30] then it becomes history and we think the
[23:32] open of the seals it's a prophesied
[23:34] event once it happens it becomes history
[23:35] and though there is a moment that we can
[23:38] say That's History the significance has
[23:41] to hold the present reality and what
[23:43] Jesus was telling Mary and Marth at the
[23:45] time of the resurrection of their
[23:46] brother is I am the resurrection and the
[23:49] life it's not a date on the calendar
[23:51] it's a person
[23:53] it is something that has an
[23:54] identification it's something that has a
[23:56] life
[23:57] and so John he said he saw his name
[23:59] written there and he got real happy John
[24:02] is making personal identification with
[24:04] what is loosed in that
[24:07] and brother Brandon this is where we're
[24:08] going to tie you in brother Brandon
[24:10] Christ is the mystery God revealed he
[24:11] says now you see the seals when he was
[24:13] in his mediatorial work back there
[24:14] redeeming but someday he comes forth to
[24:17] get this book that he's redeemed
[24:19] and all that's in this book would be him
[24:22] for that's the believer
[24:24] he says she is him so he's saying and
[24:26] all that would be in this book is him
[24:27] for that's the believer the words in the
[24:30] book and the word is him
[24:32] so there's the there's the tie and he
[24:34] said well it's Christ but you're you're
[24:35] in him so he says all that's in the book
[24:37] is the believer that's for that's the
[24:39] believer the words in the book and all
[24:41] and the word is him and all that's in
[24:43] that
[24:44] so that is this is the personal
[24:45] identification he come forth for this
[24:48] book of redemption whose names are
[24:50] written on the book before the
[24:52] foundation of the world when he was
[24:54] slain as the lamb and here he is today
[24:56] in his word manifesting the same thing
[24:59] he did there
[25:01] now if you think about that just in what
[25:04] he's referring to the names are written
[25:06] on the book before the foundation of the
[25:07] world and here he is today manifesting
[25:10] what he wrote on the book there
[25:12] here he is today manifesting these very
[25:15] things manifesting the believer who is
[25:17] the book
[25:19] who are the words in the book because
[25:21] she is him
[25:24] and in Psalms 139 verses 16 and 17 just
[25:27] so you can see that these this image
[25:29] that's often painted in scripture says
[25:32] that eyes did see my substance yet being
[25:34] unperfect brother Brown said their names
[25:36] are written on the book before the
[25:37] foundation the world before we ever came
[25:38] into existence there was a reality to
[25:41] you to who you are
[25:43] God's thoughts are Eternal they are real
[25:45] so he says yet being unperfect and in
[25:47] thy book all my members were written
[25:49] remember how brother Brown talks about
[25:51] God took your picture
[25:53] I'm so glad it wasn't at 47.
[25:56] we have it we have a tradition in our
[25:58] family where we write at the end of the
[25:59] year we write in a book our prayers and
[26:02] it's personal we don't read one
[26:03] another's and I'm many pounds off my
[26:06] goal from a couple years ago
[26:08] and so uh you pray for me and I will
[26:10] make this a public prayer request now
[26:12] but uh God took your picture remember
[26:15] says he put it in his great file
[26:17] right took you at your best he's a
[26:19] perfect picture of you and if that's the
[26:21] picture that means to materialize so God
[26:23] has a photo album as it were of all of
[26:26] his children those that make up his body
[26:28] and he says in thy book all my members
[26:30] were written which in continuous where
[26:32] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[26:33] them how precious also are there thought
[26:36] are thy thoughts unto me oh God how
[26:39] great is the sum of them why does he
[26:41] refer to the thoughts because God's
[26:43] thoughts are Eternal they are real and
[26:45] God's thought of you is that perfect
[26:47] picture God's thought of you is this
[26:50] record is this Lamb's Book of Life
[26:51] representation of who you are and who
[26:53] your person is and it's in this book
[26:56] these members are written in a book
[26:58] names are written on a book and this
[27:01] would be one reason why John would get
[27:02] all sad because he's maybe looking at
[27:04] this saying if I'm ever going to be
[27:06] there the record's in that sealed book
[27:08] and so what about just to him that
[27:10] believeth and what about the person that
[27:12] did good what about the person that did
[27:13] this he says no I'm looking at something
[27:15] totally different I'm thinking about a
[27:17] name that has been written that can
[27:19] never be removed I'm talking about being
[27:21] an eternal attribute of God I'm talking
[27:23] about Redemption I'm talking about
[27:25] salvation I'm not just talking about
[27:27] getting in on the day of judgment I'm
[27:29] talking about someone who's there in the
[27:31] beginning
[27:32] that's what I was promised that's what I
[27:34] believed this is the Vindication of it
[27:38] brother Branham says in the four seal he
[27:40] said God opened the seals
[27:42] that's the reason I think John was doing
[27:44] all the shouting the other night
[27:46] he's referring to when he preached the
[27:48] bridge and maybe John was shouting again
[27:50] hey makes it so personal like you know
[27:53] that this ought to be in our language
[27:54] you know brother random said the other
[27:56] day right I'm like wait when did you
[27:58] talk to him
[27:59] but we want to be listening and this is
[28:01] kind of sounds like brother Branham and
[28:02] brother John were hanging out he says
[28:04] John was doing all the shouting the
[28:05] other night he's referring to the breach
[28:06] he must have seen his name on there
[28:09] okay there's another reference to it
[28:11] that his excitement his Jubilation his
[28:13] enthusiasm wasn't just oh well the seals
[28:16] are open yay the seals are open we can
[28:18] be different no it was a personal
[28:19] identification with what happened he
[28:21] must have seen his name and he says on
[28:23] there in other words what he was
[28:26] quickened to him at the opening was
[28:28] personal
[28:30] and the sermon the breach he says it
[28:31] this way again oh my what happened the
[28:33] screams the shouts the hallelujahs the
[28:35] anointed the power the glory the
[28:37] manifestation
[28:39] and old John who'd been standing there
[28:41] our brother crying why he said
[28:43] everything in heaven everything in the
[28:45] earth everything in the sea heard me
[28:47] holler amen blessings honor and might
[28:49] and power to be to him that lives
[28:52] forever and ever talk about a happy time
[28:55] when them seals broke again this is our
[28:58] season of Joy notice how there's rejoice
[29:00] and there's praise there's jubulation
[29:02] there's enthusiasm associated with God
[29:04] fulfilling his promised word in
[29:06] particular the opening of these seals he
[29:09] says all the glory the manifestation the
[29:11] hallelujahs the shouts the anointed the
[29:13] power the glory the manifestation
[29:15] talk about a happy time when the seals
[29:17] were opened he says John must have
[29:19] looked and so past the curtain of time
[29:22] and said now this is just to me a real
[29:24] unique statement there's John
[29:28] oh he was so happy remember the story
[29:31] brother bam tell us about the boy he saw
[29:33] a mirror for the first time or at least
[29:34] we've heard the story and he's and it's
[29:37] portrayed where this kid comes from the
[29:39] country into the city sees Amir for the
[29:41] first time he's kind of like what's
[29:42] going on here and like man you know wow
[29:44] this is really interesting and uh who
[29:46] could this person be and I someone was
[29:47] showing a video of that one time of a
[29:49] guy who was uh intoxicated he couldn't
[29:52] get past himself in the mirror and and
[29:55] so they couldn't make it by him and
[29:57] because he was seen as his reflection
[29:59] and somebody was watching the video says
[30:01] what are the chances that somebody would
[30:02] be dressed like just like him
[30:05] that's somebody who's not catching
[30:06] what's happening but John like that
[30:09] little kid who looked in the mirror said
[30:11] whoa there's John in other words that's
[30:14] me
[30:15] what he saw again what he said there's
[30:18] John he didn't just see j-o-h-n because
[30:21] then we could have an argument right how
[30:23] many of you know somebody named John
[30:25] all right then you could have an
[30:26] argument Josh said no I'm the first John
[30:27] no I'm the first John all right we got
[30:29] the First Baptist Church of and they all
[30:31] claimed to be the first I was the first
[30:33] John I was the one he was talking about
[30:34] but this is a something personal he says
[30:36] there's John he wasn't just saying a
[30:39] name he was thinking of himself
[30:42] so there's me oh and he was happy just
[30:45] like that kid who looked in the man says
[30:46] mama that's me
[30:49] so this is I'm taking I'm maybe going to
[30:53] slow down just a little bit to share
[30:54] something that can be from an academic
[30:58] standpoint a lot a lot of things we
[31:00] could share a lot of things that can be
[31:02] talked about because it's actually very
[31:03] very broad area that's constantly
[31:05] growing but he says there's John
[31:08] this is recognition of self
[31:11] this is John seeing something saying
[31:13] well that's me
[31:15] like like if you saw a picture and it
[31:17] can be
[31:19] oh it's very particular where you show
[31:21] somebody a picture it doesn't matter how
[31:23] old it is or where it's from people just
[31:25] have a way of saying well that's that's
[31:26] me I recognize myself and very rarely
[31:29] are you showing a picture where you
[31:30] don't recognize yourself
[31:32] you're like I'm
[31:34] I don't know who that is that can't be
[31:36] me that guy's way too heavy right like
[31:38] that that I have please tell me I have
[31:40] more hair than that
[31:42] and so there's a there's a recognition
[31:44] of self based upon if you could catch
[31:47] this self-representation
[31:49] so there's a wrecking you recognize
[31:51] something self-recognition based upon
[31:54] how you how you represent yourself or
[31:57] how you're represented to yourself it's
[31:59] the idea of self and so he saw himself
[32:02] when he said there's John there's almost
[32:06] this instinctual
[32:08] uh and I want to say childlike but it's
[32:10] not childlike but it is it is just so um
[32:14] innocent there's me
[32:16] that's me and he sees it when he saw
[32:19] himself it was like it's core identity
[32:21] his core person not just the name like
[32:24] we go to how special is it when you go
[32:26] to uh Cracker Barrel and they've got all
[32:28] these mugs and you see one that says
[32:30] John you know can you believe it they
[32:32] got a mug with John on it right that
[32:35] that's not that's not a big surprise
[32:37] right but if you had Lucas with the K
[32:39] maybe like yes
[32:42] yes and and so this is John then what
[32:45] he's recognizing is something that is
[32:47] very very personal it was
[32:49] self-recognition based upon
[32:51] self-representation
[32:53] John had some
[32:55] and I wish I just had uh I I guess I
[32:59] feel constrained but John had some
[33:01] anchoring belief
[33:03] in his heart about who he was and what
[33:05] made him what he was
[33:07] like when there was something maybe deep
[33:09] even if it had been hidden even if he
[33:11] never fully understood it when this
[33:12] finally represented itself he said
[33:14] that's who I am that's me
[33:17] something was confirmed something was
[33:19] made known to him that was a releasing
[33:22] that's something that was like I'll
[33:23] never weep another tear a day in my life
[33:25] after this happens now that I've seen
[33:27] this if something that was
[33:28] transformative
[33:30] but it was anchored and who he believed
[33:32] he was
[33:33] and so self-representation that's how we
[33:36] Define ourselves it's how we see
[33:38] ourselves maybe it's a subject of great
[33:40] debate these days
[33:42] but self-representation influences our
[33:44] thinking how we feel how we behave
[33:48] self-representation how you see yourself
[33:50] how you view yourself what you think
[33:51] about yourself how you would Define
[33:53] yourself
[33:54] forms your identity
[33:57] sometimes there's a there's not a
[33:59] self-representation but people kind of
[34:01] take on certain identities well they're
[34:03] my weird one or they're the ones that
[34:04] like this and they're the ones and they
[34:05] have ways where they force themselves to
[34:08] kind of form a particular identity but
[34:10] when someone really recognizes uh they
[34:12] have some sort of even if it's right or
[34:14] correct however you want to look at it
[34:15] self-representation is an identity
[34:17] influences the way you think the way you
[34:19] act the way you behave the way you feel
[34:22] and this self-representational Behavior
[34:26] this is maybe this is the scientific
[34:28] part it begins to emerge in infants and
[34:31] and babies once a certain once certain
[34:33] parts of the brain begin to form so this
[34:36] ability to recognize something and to
[34:39] that they even do these experiments to
[34:41] where uh putting something on a baby's
[34:44] face and using a mirror are they able to
[34:46] recognize where it is at and remove
[34:49] whatever it is based upon
[34:51] self-representation that's me that's the
[34:53] Mark it's on my face here this is what
[34:55] I'll do to get it off there's ways that
[34:56] they've studied this
[34:57] and so self-representational Behavior
[35:00] includes recognizing yourself in a
[35:01] mirror uh describing yourself maybe even
[35:05] describing your mental state I'm I'm I'm
[35:07] hungry perfect time to do that is when
[35:09] you're in trouble I'm really hungry uh
[35:11] there's certain things that babies will
[35:13] do and children do they can recognize
[35:14] I'm sad I'm tired this is recognizing
[35:17] their person
[35:18] now something that is
[35:21] very unique to self-representational
[35:23] behavior or the brain recognizing who
[35:26] you are one of the things that they can
[35:28] use for this is hearing your name
[35:31] and they find that here in your name has
[35:33] the same brain activation activation as
[35:36] self-representation Behavior so here in
[35:39] your name lights up the same parts of
[35:41] your brain as seeing your reflection in
[35:43] a mirror here in your name will light up
[35:45] certain parts of the brain the same way
[35:46] when you begin to think about yourself
[35:47] and how you feel them so your name is
[35:50] associated with more than just well how
[35:52] do we you know how do we organize things
[35:53] and how do we know when you're talking
[35:55] to child one child to a child three he
[35:57] goes by it's more than just the name
[35:59] this is what one of the studies
[36:00] concluded hearing your own name causes
[36:02] your brain to react as if you're
[36:04] engaging in the behaviors and thought
[36:06] patterns that serve as some of your core
[36:09] identity and personality markers
[36:12] here in your name engages the brain and
[36:15] causes the brain to react in the same
[36:17] way that it would when you're doing
[36:19] things that serve to manifest your core
[36:22] personality and your core identity
[36:26] so your name is not just an appellation
[36:29] it's just it's not nominative but it
[36:30] becomes something to the person to where
[36:33] when you hear your name the brain gets
[36:35] excited in such a way in the same way
[36:37] that happens when you are expressing
[36:39] yourself who you really are and what
[36:42] your core person is
[36:44] how many remember Dale Carnegie's
[36:46] statement
[36:46] remember that a person's name is to that
[36:48] person the sweetest and most important
[36:50] sound in any language
[36:56] there's something to a name
[37:01] um
[37:02] ever heard of the cocktail party effect
[37:04] you might have to spend a couple service
[37:05] on what a cocktail party is
[37:07] but it's in a crowd cocktail party
[37:09] effect they describe it as being in a
[37:11] party or crowd and you're at a luncheon
[37:13] or you had a function you're at a
[37:14] Christmas dinner
[37:16] and the cocktail party effect is your
[37:18] ability to focus on a specific stimulus
[37:21] by filtering out all the other stimuli
[37:23] in the room all the other noise and and
[37:25] this is the fact that the brain can do
[37:26] the brain can focus in on something
[37:29] and and and tune everything else out and
[37:32] hear something in particular
[37:34] and they've studied this from different
[37:35] aspects and one of the ways that they
[37:37] tried to study it the cocktail party
[37:39] effect is by asking somebody to focus on
[37:43] something a certain sound like you're
[37:45] going to listen to this speaker and
[37:47] you're going to Shadow it and you repeat
[37:49] whatever this thing says and so there's
[37:51] all these other sources of information
[37:53] but you're to listen you're to listen to
[37:55] this it's called shadowing and what they
[37:57] found is that you could be saying five
[37:59] ten and you've got all these other
[38:01] things that are being said maybe it's a
[38:02] song Maybe it's noise but you're
[38:04] shadowing something and they said but as
[38:05] soon as your name is called
[38:07] you can you know it
[38:09] even if it comes from a source you're
[38:10] not shadowing even if it comes from a
[38:12] place you're not tuning in and so one of
[38:15] the things that that cocktail effect is
[38:17] party effect is you can be sitting there
[38:18] talking and talking in that great loyal
[38:20] in that great and that wonderful and
[38:21] someone says do you see the sock put the
[38:22] Aaron has on you like brother Aaron what
[38:24] right you hear immediately it's
[38:28] something you have your name there's
[38:29] something about your name and so it's
[38:31] such an important phenomenon of this
[38:33] idea and even in this study this is one
[38:35] of the conclusions they came to and
[38:36] studying this is that that people never
[38:38] Tire of hearing their name
[38:40] because they could they could just keep
[38:41] saying you've listened to your name you
[38:43] listen to your name you listen to your
[38:44] name and then other names would be
[38:45] repeated and they'd always have the
[38:46] ability to know despite all the other
[38:48] names that are being mentioned all the
[38:50] other stimuli everything has been
[38:51] happening there's something about that
[38:53] name
[38:54] that means something more to them when
[38:56] they study this on children they'll even
[38:58] find that if you just change it sounds
[38:59] like their name but it's not their name
[39:00] it means nothing to them
[39:02] it recognized just even the slightest
[39:04] distinction you couldn't yell and say
[39:06] ack come here
[39:07] no he's waiting for Jack right you can't
[39:11] get it close it's got to be precise so
[39:14] much more we could share on this maybe
[39:15] you could just think about it on your
[39:17] own time
[39:19] but this this is the part that I thought
[39:21] was amazing as I studied this
[39:23] this phenomena the way our minds work
[39:26] and in relation to our brain and again
[39:28] it's not just a name it's who you think
[39:29] you are
[39:30] self-recognition based upon
[39:32] self-representation is such a powerful
[39:34] phenomena our brains will involuntarily
[39:37] respond at the sound of our names
[39:40] and that's where they have uh your brain
[39:42] is being imaged
[39:44] and you're shadowing something and you
[39:46] may not even be asked to respond but as
[39:48] soon as you hear your name that part of
[39:49] your brain will light up
[39:51] and they find that we will in our brains
[39:53] will involuntarily you don't have to do
[39:55] it perform an action you don't have to
[39:56] acknowledge it but you could be focusing
[39:58] on something shadowing something
[39:59] shattering something else and your name
[40:01] gets called and your brain knows it
[40:03] and your brain responds and there's
[40:05] actually a chemical reaction that takes
[40:07] place within your brain for those
[40:08] neurons to be fired for that part of the
[40:10] brain to light up it's so powerful that
[40:12] our brains without us making a conscious
[40:14] effort or even doing any activity will
[40:16] respond to it
[40:17] it's so powerful that they found the
[40:20] brains of patients in a persistent
[40:22] vegetative state
[40:24] are stimulated by their name
[40:26] they don't they can't do anything else
[40:28] they are in a vegetative state
[40:29] persistent vegetative state and they
[40:31] will they will say a person's name by
[40:33] and scan their brain and the Brain will
[40:35] still respond to it
[40:37] everything else is non-functional but
[40:39] the brain responds to the name children
[40:41] under sedation will respond selectively
[40:44] to the sound of their own first name
[40:47] a child that's been sedated who cannot
[40:49] respond anything cannot act cannot raise
[40:52] their hand if they hear their name the
[40:53] brain still gets it I want you to think
[40:56] about how powerful this is especially in
[40:58] light of the fact that we come to the
[41:00] day when the the the wise is sleeping
[41:02] along with the foolish and there's been
[41:04] no Revival to wake up the bride and to
[41:06] stir her up and you think well what's
[41:08] going to do it what's going to cause it
[41:09] she's asleep our name Will stimulate us
[41:12] even when we're unable to respond or act
[41:15] on anything else you may not be able to
[41:18] raise your hand you may not be able to
[41:19] say that's me but there's something
[41:21] inside of you that can recognize your
[41:24] name and respond when nothing else can
[41:26] respond
[41:29] why it's listening for its name
[41:31] it's one it's going to hear
[41:33] that's why you ever ever thought that
[41:35] your all your smart devices
[41:37] and you're like well it's it's not
[41:39] listening to you say its name
[41:41] well then it's Somewhere listening then
[41:44] it's Somewhere listening always
[41:46] listening for its name right that ought
[41:49] to scare you a little bit
[41:51] and Jeff Bezos still hasn't paid his
[41:53] ties
[41:57] our name Will stimulate us
[42:00] even in a sedated asleep
[42:03] and so this is where we're wanting to
[42:05] zero in on is John's response
[42:09] was connected with his name being called
[42:10] he must have saw his name wrote there he
[42:12] must have seen his name on there he
[42:14] looked past the curtain of time and said
[42:16] there's John
[42:17] right he this was identity this is self
[42:19] recognition
[42:21] and there is a deeper meaning for John
[42:23] because for John it's not just okay well
[42:26] my name's in a book
[42:28] there was a prophetic command from
[42:30] Christ that his Joy ought to be anchored
[42:33] in that very thing
[42:34] so there's something for John this meant
[42:36] more to him this had a deeper meaning in
[42:38] Luke 10 20 notwithstanding this Rejoice
[42:40] not don't Rejoice because the devils are
[42:42] subject to you don't Rejoice because you
[42:44] have power over this and you have power
[42:45] don't Rejoice because you can speak in
[42:46] tongues and God's restored his power in
[42:48] the rain has fallen and signs and
[42:50] wonders and miracles Rejoice not in
[42:52] these things alone that the spirits are
[42:53] subject unto you but rather rejoice
[42:56] because your names are written in heaven
[42:58] and this is the moment where John has it
[43:00] Vindicated and confirmed the promise for
[43:02] his day Rejoice because your names are
[43:05] written in heaven and this is what John
[43:06] could return to when when John sees his
[43:09] name it wasn't just like oh well imagine
[43:11] that he could connect it to Christ he
[43:14] connect connected to the word he can say
[43:16] this is the moment that Jesus said
[43:18] should be a cause of my joy this is the
[43:21] time that Jesus said I ought to Rejoice
[43:23] so we've got to think more deeply than
[43:25] just a name but think about John's
[43:27] identity and the fact that Christ had
[43:29] centered him on this reality don't get
[43:31] happy in religion don't get happy in
[43:33] enthusiasm don't just Rejoice because
[43:35] you're rejoicing but you've got to have
[43:37] a real reason for it
[43:39] he said I'll give you a reason Rejoice
[43:41] because your names are written in heaven
[43:44] and as names written in heaven as Jesus
[43:46] says it has more weight than just a
[43:48] record
[43:49] it refers to your inheritance it refers
[43:51] to your identity that's what I was
[43:52] wanting to
[43:53] emphasize in the idea of
[43:55] self-recognition the name is just not a
[43:57] name but it means something
[44:00] I know you'll recognize this statement
[44:01] and be able to connect it to a number of
[44:03] different places and the sermon question
[44:05] and answers I believe this is uh
[44:07] part three says why did and this isn't a
[44:10] lot of uh he uses this this
[44:14] um
[44:15] this in a few places he says why did
[44:16] Aaron have on his breastplate the
[44:18] birthstone of each one of those
[44:19] Patriarchs
[44:21] look at those mothers when they give
[44:22] utterance when the mothers them Hebrew
[44:24] women in labor giving others to those
[44:26] children be born it placed their name
[44:28] and he talks about in other places an
[44:29] adoption series to how they cried out
[44:32] their name at their birth
[44:33] and he said as they did that it just
[44:36] wasn't giving them a name at that moment
[44:39] but it was actually
[44:40] placing them where they'd be in the
[44:42] Promised Land
[44:44] even today there's a Jewish tradition
[44:46] they wait till the eighth day
[44:49] to reveal the name of a son
[44:51] even it's still a Jewish tradition it's
[44:53] very the the naming uh the naming of a
[44:56] child is very important in Jewish
[44:58] tradition he says it plays their name
[45:01] it told their birth
[45:04] it put them in the Homeland sent them
[45:06] over to Eternity it says one of these
[45:07] days when I come in and stay a little
[45:09] time I want to take that subject exactly
[45:10] and then watch Jacob when he was dying
[45:13] there when he laid his hands upon the
[45:15] Patriarchs and blessed them he was
[45:16] telling them exactly where they would be
[45:18] now watch this they're named now now
[45:21] there's an actual place he says and
[45:22] that's exactly according to their name
[45:25] and exactly according to their birth
[45:28] sure it has something to do with you
[45:31] now that's your birth path
[45:33] that's what you are a natural man or a
[45:35] natural woman what is he referring to
[45:37] names
[45:39] he says why would the the birthstones
[45:41] represent the Patriots why would the
[45:43] mothers give utterance what he's giving
[45:45] this thought and I realize now there's
[45:47] some other statements that might have
[45:48] been more
[45:49] um direct to this and I have a few later
[45:51] on this morning but he says this is
[45:54] exactly according to their name it has
[45:56] something to do with you so the name is
[45:59] more than just a convenience it's more
[46:02] than something
[46:03] I would just kind of think about and
[46:04] dream up and say oh well I want to have
[46:06] a name that has so many syllables and
[46:08] really it's something you ought to be
[46:09] very prayerful about
[46:10] because there's something to that name
[46:12] he says it's your birth path
[46:15] and Nehemiah chapter 8 verse 12 and the
[46:17] people went their way to eat
[46:19] and to drink and to send portions and to
[46:20] make great mirth because they had
[46:22] understood the words that were declared
[46:24] unto them
[46:25] they're rejoicing their mirth their
[46:27] enthusiasm their their Joy was caused by
[46:29] understanding The Words of the open book
[46:32] but there was a personal identification
[46:34] with the words
[46:36] there's
[46:37] I how many of you
[46:41] well I'll try to think of just exactly
[46:44] the right way to say this
[46:46] if somebody said hey I want to read to
[46:49] you what a person who's born on January
[46:52] 2nd is like
[46:53] if you're not born on January 2nd you
[46:55] might
[46:58] humor me
[46:59] right
[47:00] and if you don't know anybody right it
[47:02] doesn't mean much but if do you want to
[47:04] hear what someone born on your birthday
[47:05] you know
[47:07] let's hear all the good things
[47:09] as soon as they say something bad now I
[47:11] don't think that's it
[47:13] quick to disagree no that's not me no
[47:15] that's that's not right
[47:17] and uh so there's something that you
[47:19] make a personal identification with it
[47:22] and so when they had the words of these
[47:24] book opened up it's isn't that why
[47:27] sometimes we ask who said that
[47:29] right because it doesn't have any weight
[47:31] does it have any significance
[47:33] uh if there's is as we share gifts with
[47:36] one another during the season and we
[47:38] have gifts what is it you look for
[47:40] you're just not excited about wrapped
[47:42] gifts right you want to see your
[47:45] shot your name on it right you want to
[47:48] see that's me this is something for me
[47:50] and so there's a there was for them when
[47:53] the book was open and they began to make
[47:54] great mirth there's some prior events
[47:57] that had transpired that kind of built
[47:59] up to this moment to where they're not
[48:01] just hearing the words of a distant
[48:03] relative this isn't just like well maybe
[48:05] this is related to who we are as Jews
[48:07] but they had a personal identification
[48:08] with the words it held deep personal
[48:10] significance
[48:11] it's not something forward foreign not
[48:13] something unrelated but the this word
[48:16] was their inheritance it was their
[48:17] Heritage it was their identity if you
[48:20] talk about the children of Israel why
[48:21] were they called the children of Israel
[48:22] because they could trace themselves back
[48:24] to Israel
[48:26] right it wasn't because they were born
[48:28] you could say I'm I'm a child of Texas
[48:30] well that means that you were just born
[48:32] in a particular place but if you're if
[48:34] you're in Israel Israelite if you were a
[48:36] Jew there was a lot that that meant
[48:39] and notice this in Nehemiah chapter 7
[48:41] verse 5 and my God put into my heart
[48:44] this is chapter seven right before
[48:46] chapter eight where they opened this
[48:48] book my God put into my heart to gather
[48:50] together the Nobles and the rulers and
[48:51] the and the people that they might be
[48:53] reckoned by genealogy
[48:55] and I found a register of the genealogy
[48:57] of them which came up at the first and
[48:59] found written therein
[49:01] I just want you to allow that just to
[49:04] just lean in against you a little bit be
[49:08] heavy because now this is what happens
[49:10] so when the book is open in Nehemiah
[49:12] chapter 8 and they begin to understand
[49:14] and appreciate the contents of the book
[49:16] and they enter into their season of
[49:17] rejoicing they're not doing it
[49:18] ignorantly they're not doing it naively
[49:20] they're not doing it religiously they're
[49:22] not just doing it because Mom and Dad
[49:23] did it they're not doing it because it's
[49:25] just kind of the move for the day but
[49:27] the open the the when they reckon by
[49:29] genealogy they find a book that's the
[49:32] register of genealogy a scroll that has
[49:34] all the names of the families and the
[49:37] descendants of the sons and the descents
[49:40] of Israel and so they opened that up in
[49:43] order to find out who they are
[49:46] to determine identity and in determining
[49:48] identity they can determine inheritance
[49:50] you're of this tribe you're of this son
[49:52] you're of this you're being placed in
[49:54] your position and this is what the open
[49:56] of the word means to us by type verse 63
[49:59] of the same chapter and the priests the
[50:01] children of habaya this is um an example
[50:03] of what happened the children of cause
[50:04] the children of Barcelona which took one
[50:07] of the daughters of barcelai the
[50:08] gileadite to wife and was called after
[50:11] their name
[50:12] so they they had a because of marriage
[50:15] and everything they didn't have an
[50:17] original name but they wanted to go back
[50:18] well this is what this person's name was
[50:20] and I was a I was a children of cuz and
[50:22] they and they sought their register they
[50:25] sought their name they sought their
[50:26] entry among those that were reckoned by
[50:29] genealogy but it was not found therefore
[50:32] were they as polluted put from the
[50:34] priesthood
[50:35] oh that's some pretty heavy language but
[50:37] what is it showing it's showing that
[50:38] there was a book with names written in
[50:40] it that they could reckon their identity
[50:42] who they were presently by what was
[50:45] written in that book and here's one says
[50:46] well my name got changed and this
[50:48] happened can you find my name in there
[50:50] so that I could serve in the priest and
[50:51] said nope there's no record the name's
[50:53] not written there that's what this book
[50:55] represented
[50:56] is to have these names written in it
[50:59] that someone could go back and Trace
[51:01] their genealogy trace their bloodline
[51:03] Trace their inheritance back to the
[51:05] names that are written in this book and
[51:07] this is what I'm trying to express to
[51:09] you at the open of the word there's a
[51:11] name calling
[51:13] and a name even if you look at the the
[51:15] definition of name
[51:18] the name anoma
[51:20] and the scripture covers everything that
[51:22] comes to mind when you hear the name
[51:25] so it's not just name but when you use a
[51:27] name
[51:28] the name covers so if we were to uh
[51:32] mention a particular person's name here
[51:35] and we would immediately we just
[51:37] wouldn't think of that name we'd start
[51:38] thinking about the car they drive where
[51:40] they sit at church whether they're
[51:41] married whether they have children right
[51:43] you begin to think about a lot whether
[51:44] or not they sent us a Christmas card
[51:45] this year and actually wrote on it
[51:47] there's a lot of things maybe you start
[51:48] thinking about
[51:49] and you start because you're building
[51:50] this idea of who they are
[51:53] and that's what a name is it covers
[51:55] their Authority their possessions their
[51:56] inheritance their interests
[51:58] and brother Brown says and I don't know
[52:00] that I have some of these statements
[52:01] here I just need to go quickly it says
[52:03] the church name is associated with the
[52:04] nature of its character we preach the
[52:06] revelation of Jesus Christ he says the
[52:08] name is associated with the nature of
[52:09] its character your name is related to
[52:11] your character he says it's the church
[52:12] name that has something to do with the
[52:14] character of the church
[52:16] the very word name itself comes from the
[52:18] root of understanding or knowledge
[52:21] so that's what the name ought to give
[52:22] understanding and knowledge in Acts
[52:25] chapter 15 it says he's going to call
[52:26] out of people from the Gentiles for his
[52:28] name's sake again this name is used for
[52:31] his namesake it covers everything it's
[52:34] to covers anything that's brought to
[52:36] mind when you hear the name
[52:38] position Authority pleasure all those
[52:40] things
[52:41] I said what we want to recognize what
[52:43] name cone is how the name is so
[52:44] significant program says the voice of
[52:46] God in the last days you ever notice our
[52:48] boys our young boys have become Ricky
[52:50] and Elvis
[52:52] says you got a child named that change
[52:54] it right quick call him number one or
[52:56] two or something
[52:59] that's great
[53:01] there's calm one or two or something it
[53:03] says what difference does the name the
[53:04] name mean why sure it means something
[53:06] your name characterizes your life
[53:10] now maybe maybe what I want needing you
[53:12] to do now is to invert
[53:14] because if we put everything on the name
[53:16] first like oh well the name means this
[53:18] and the name means this but oftentimes
[53:21] and again this comes from some of the
[53:23] Hebrew tradition
[53:25] the name corresponds to the life
[53:28] that's manifest
[53:30] now you would give a name based upon
[53:31] characteristics and attributes not the
[53:33] inverse where they get a name and then
[53:35] that becomes associated with certain
[53:36] characteristics and so he says your name
[53:39] characterizes your life so there's a
[53:42] little bit of inversion here in what God
[53:44] does is it's the life that counts it's
[53:46] the life that matters now brother bam
[53:48] you're on numerology no I'm not I'm on
[53:49] thus saith the Lord why wasn't when
[53:51] Jacob when he lived to his name as a
[53:53] deceiver supplanter Jacob and when God
[53:55] changed him he changed his name God
[53:58] changed Saul to Paul Simon to Peter
[53:59] certainly it has something and Ricky and
[54:02] Elvis and such names as that is the
[54:04] modern American name which throws a
[54:06] child automatically right into that
[54:08] so it shows there is something to the
[54:11] name that will actually be associated
[54:13] with and characterizes a particular life
[54:15] and it has awakened and it has an
[54:17] influence
[54:18] this is the power at your name oh it's
[54:20] just a name it's just a name you better
[54:21] think about that name
[54:23] research suggests that names influence
[54:25] your profession where you live who you
[54:28] marry the grades you make the stocks you
[54:30] invest in whether you get accepted into
[54:32] school hired for a job or the quality of
[54:34] work you do in a group setting
[54:36] this is what research has indicated that
[54:38] a name can dictate these different
[54:40] things
[54:41] there was a Harvard study done and
[54:44] there's been subsequent studies it's
[54:45] maybe a little bit controversial but
[54:47] there's been a number of studies that's
[54:48] kind of touched on this very same thing
[54:50] they found that rare odd names have a
[54:52] negative psychological effect on the one
[54:54] that bears it
[54:55] right a rare name an odd name and they
[54:58] did this study amongst hundreds of
[55:00] graduates and found that people who
[55:02] named Mike
[55:04] uh and uh getting some heads perked up
[55:07] what other names could I remember that
[55:08] were in this
[55:10] these certain names they tended to
[55:12] farewell you know but people named I
[55:14] can't remember what the name was like
[55:15] very rare or something like that like
[55:17] they didn't fare too well and yeah maybe
[55:19] you say well chances are you know you
[55:21] have a lot of Daniels or you have a lot
[55:22] of this you have a lot of that you're
[55:23] going to have a higher instances of it
[55:25] but they found at least some correlation
[55:28] of a negative psychological effect if
[55:31] you have an odd or a different name
[55:33] and brother Brandon's saying there's a
[55:34] your name characterizes your life the
[55:37] church name has something to do with the
[55:38] nature of its character that you can
[55:41] name a child something that throws them
[55:43] automatically into something
[55:46] and this is what brother Brown said
[55:47] there's something to a name and now
[55:48] there's actually research to back it up
[55:51] and what did Jesus say when he came in
[55:52] John 17 26 I have declared unto them thy
[55:55] name and will declare it
[55:57] did he just what did he go around saying
[55:59] Jesus Jesus no
[56:01] the Declaration of a name was
[56:03] manifesting one's character the
[56:05] Declaration of a name was a certain
[56:07] attributes being displayed power being
[56:09] used certain rights being declared that
[56:11] that's what's in a name to declare the
[56:13] name doesn't mean Jesus was just letting
[56:15] everybody in on what they called the big
[56:17] man upstairs or what his name actually
[56:19] is it to declare his name was to declare
[56:22] his nature his attributes his character
[56:25] his authority that's what it means to
[56:27] declare a name so in the Bible when
[56:29] brother man says John saw his name and
[56:32] he said there's John this was a life
[56:34] this was an identity this was an
[56:36] inheritance this was a possession if I
[56:38] could say it this way I I'm wanting to
[56:41] emphasize to you that it was more than
[56:43] just him hearing his name more than them
[56:45] just him seeing John but something was
[56:48] expressed that he personally identified
[56:49] with but even if it was a name it meant
[56:53] more than just a name
[56:56] and so how does this relate then
[56:58] the opening of the seals relate to the
[57:00] bride's season of joy John sees the name
[57:03] John sees the name John sees the name
[57:04] makes him happy makes them excited we've
[57:06] been building all this uh how the name
[57:09] he found with me in this uh do we need
[57:12] to have service on Christmas
[57:14] I'll fly back in town to do this if I
[57:16] need to
[57:17] there's something that gets the mind
[57:19] going something that stimulates the
[57:20] person they get excited something to the
[57:22] name and what I want you to recognize is
[57:24] there's more to it than just saying
[57:26] Hey Brother Tom right
[57:29] that there's a there's a life there's an
[57:30] identity there's a personal
[57:31] identification
[57:33] brother Ram says in the message the
[57:34] breach we read this I believe on
[57:35] Wednesday night talk about a jubilee
[57:37] talk about a time when this lamb walked
[57:39] forth the books even sealed in heaven
[57:41] the Mysteries are saved is my name there
[57:42] I don't know I hope it is
[57:45] on March 17th he says this but if it's
[57:47] if it is it was put on the book before
[57:49] the foundation of the world
[57:51] now watch what he says next but the
[57:54] first thing that represented that
[57:55] Redemption come the lamb that had been
[57:56] slain from the foundation of the world
[57:57] and he took the book open the book tore
[58:00] off the seals and sent it down to the
[58:02] Earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to
[58:05] his people
[58:06] there you are
[58:08] because remember what's in the book and
[58:11] he even he even I don't think this is a
[58:12] mistake he even prefaces is my name in
[58:14] there
[58:15] and he says I don't know I hope it is
[58:18] but he's going to loose the seals and
[58:19] he's going to send it down to earth to a
[58:21] seventh angel to reveal it to his people
[58:23] reveal what reveal what what's in the
[58:25] book
[58:26] he comes back the next day and he says
[58:28] in the in the first seal and the members
[58:30] of his bride their names were put in the
[58:33] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[58:34] foundation of the world but it's been
[58:36] sealed up
[58:37] and now it's being revealed whose names
[58:39] are in there
[58:40] all about it what a great thing
[58:43] so these are some things we get down to
[58:44] First principles these are some things
[58:46] that we can look at and say okay names
[58:48] are written in the book and the sealed
[58:49] book there's going to be names that are
[58:51] revealed in the book he says it comes
[58:52] down to the seventh angel Messenger to
[58:54] reveal it to his people the bride's
[58:56] names are put in the Lamb's Book of Life
[58:57] before the foundation of the world and
[58:59] now it's being revealed whose names are
[59:01] in there
[59:02] can we follow that
[59:04] I say at the very least you could
[59:05] disagree but I'm just saying what he
[59:07] said he said now it's been revealed
[59:09] whose names are in there then he's asked
[59:11] several days later in question answers
[59:13] on the seals in the morning before he
[59:14] preaches the seventh seal he makes this
[59:16] statement nothing will be saved only
[59:18] those whose names are put on the Lamb's
[59:20] Book of Life before the foundation of
[59:21] the world Jew or Gentile that's all the
[59:24] book holds that mystery
[59:26] Let's uh let's just focus here it's 11
[59:29] 39 so now you know what time it is we're
[59:32] gonna we're gonna get through this we're
[59:33] gonna make it the book holds the mystery
[59:36] and the book is only unfolding it now
[59:40] the mystery and then he says this not
[59:43] each one's name but what the mystery of
[59:46] the book is while it's calling those
[59:49] names
[59:51] there's this kind of this Nuance that's
[59:53] something very subtle here and he says
[59:56] you understand that now the book doesn't
[59:58] say now leave elves to be saved in the
[1:00:00] time of this church age or Ormond
[1:00:01] Neville or whoever know it don't say
[1:00:03] that
[1:00:04] now this this community this changes
[1:00:06] things because if there's names written
[1:00:08] there now he says it doesn't say arm and
[1:00:10] Neville in this age and leave ill in
[1:00:12] this age and uh Micah Torres in this age
[1:00:14] if it doesn't actually say that I'm I'm
[1:00:16] listening now it just shows the mystery
[1:00:20] unfolds the mystery of what the thing is
[1:00:22] but we ourselves by faith believe it
[1:00:26] now if we if we really focus on this we
[1:00:28] can catch that brother Branham has given
[1:00:31] us some greater specificity about what
[1:00:33] the name being called is though it may
[1:00:36] not actually say Lee veil in Ormond
[1:00:38] Neville and these different things he
[1:00:40] clarifies what the name being called is
[1:00:43] because he says the book holds a mystery
[1:00:45] and the mystery's unfolding not each
[1:00:48] one's names or Neville Lee Veil but the
[1:00:51] mystery of the book while it's calling
[1:00:53] those names
[1:00:55] so the mystery the Revelation the
[1:00:57] mystery is what's unfolding and that's
[1:01:00] what's calling your name
[1:01:02] it's a revelation of self there's a
[1:01:05] self-recognition there's an identity
[1:01:07] that's happening John when the seals
[1:01:10] were loosed he said that's me that's
[1:01:12] John when the mystery unfolded it called
[1:01:14] his name but did it have to say well
[1:01:16] John the Baptist will be and John the
[1:01:18] Revelator will be and Orman never will
[1:01:20] be did it have to say the actual name
[1:01:25] the idea the Revelation the mystery he's
[1:01:28] saying is what's calling your name not
[1:01:30] the name your parents gave you
[1:01:33] could you imagine how confusing that
[1:01:35] would be if you're given one name they
[1:01:36] decided to change it a few years later
[1:01:40] it's not your name
[1:01:42] but the idea of calling your name is
[1:01:44] God's act this is my final thought here
[1:01:46] so you can see this because it's it's
[1:01:48] perfectly in line with the scripture
[1:01:50] it's God's Act of identifying you
[1:01:54] and and choosing you
[1:01:57] uh and not just it's this process
[1:02:00] of
[1:02:01] identifying choosing and year 19.
[1:02:04] I think we might have said that in the
[1:02:05] beginning
[1:02:06] name calling it's an act of identifying
[1:02:09] something choosing something and then
[1:02:11] placing it
[1:02:13] not by name but by character
[1:02:15] not merely by name but by attribute
[1:02:18] it's there's other people I'm sure
[1:02:21] you've all done this and you could say
[1:02:22] Amen or raise your hand but you've
[1:02:24] Googled your name or you've binged your
[1:02:26] name or whatever it is you use duck
[1:02:27] ducked your name
[1:02:28] you've looked your name up you know what
[1:02:30] there's other people named whatever your
[1:02:32] name is no matter how rare it is there's
[1:02:33] probably somebody else that's got your
[1:02:34] name
[1:02:35] and so it's more than just the name it's
[1:02:38] who you actually are
[1:02:40] it's not just by appearance or by name
[1:02:42] it's character it's life it's identity
[1:02:44] it's self-recognition
[1:02:46] give you an example in first Samuel 16.
[1:02:49] God has turned taking the anointing away
[1:02:51] from Saul he's going to choose a new
[1:02:53] king
[1:02:54] and he tells the prophet to go to the
[1:02:56] house of Jesse and call Jesse to the
[1:02:58] sacrifice and I will show thee what Thou
[1:03:01] shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me
[1:03:04] him whom I name unto thee
[1:03:07] now wouldn't have it been great if he
[1:03:09] just said go to Jesse's and call David
[1:03:12] I'm boom it's over right there right
[1:03:14] right they know who David is he's the
[1:03:16] young guy in the field but yet that's
[1:03:18] not exactly how it happened he says go
[1:03:20] and I will anoint unto him whom I name
[1:03:23] unto thee one that I will call by my
[1:03:25] name one that I will identify one that I
[1:03:28] will place it says in verse one that I
[1:03:30] have provided me a king from among his
[1:03:33] sons so God had already chosen David God
[1:03:36] already knew who he was God already had
[1:03:39] him identified in his heart God all he
[1:03:41] had that name but now he's going to name
[1:03:43] him and the prophet's going to go to the
[1:03:44] house of Jesse to name the next king of
[1:03:46] Israel and it's not that he's going to
[1:03:48] give him a new name you from now on are
[1:03:51] going to be known as DaVita you're it's
[1:03:53] not something changing but it's actually
[1:03:55] the one I'm going to choose the one that
[1:03:57] I'm going to name is the one I'm going
[1:03:59] to choose
[1:04:00] and in several places the god when the
[1:04:02] sun comes up he says the Lord hath not
[1:04:04] chosen Thee the Lord hath not chosen
[1:04:05] thee and in verse 12 he says this is he
[1:04:10] God then identity by by by looking at
[1:04:13] the point and he named him how did he
[1:04:15] name him by identifying him and at that
[1:04:18] point then maybe the name's just an
[1:04:19] afterthought I don't care what his name
[1:04:21] is this is the king
[1:04:24] could you imagine if he went to George
[1:04:25] Foreman's house and he says I'm coming
[1:04:27] to your house because the next King's
[1:04:28] going to be George because which one
[1:04:30] I think he named all of his kids George
[1:04:32] or George Gina
[1:04:34] or Georgia or something so I mean could
[1:04:36] you imagine hey hey I'm here to name a
[1:04:38] king and his name's David and Jesse's
[1:04:39] like you know what just had this weird
[1:04:41] thing I want all my kids to be named
[1:04:42] David
[1:04:43] which David
[1:04:44] then he has to start looking okay Lord
[1:04:46] who are you going to name
[1:04:47] who is it you're going to name in verse
[1:04:48] 7 he says the Lord said unto Samuel look
[1:04:50] not on his countenance or the height of
[1:04:52] a stature because I've refused him
[1:04:54] for the Lord seeth not his man saith for
[1:04:57] man looketh on the outward appearance
[1:04:59] but the Lord looketh on the heart
[1:05:02] this is what it means to be named
[1:05:07] to call your name
[1:05:10] oh I pray to God you're catching this to
[1:05:12] call your name is something deeper
[1:05:14] than him just saying what your mom and
[1:05:16] dad call you
[1:05:17] in John Chapter 14 verse 3 just have a
[1:05:20] this I'd be looking at now this is my
[1:05:21] last scripture I think I'll make
[1:05:22] reference to that should mean maybe not
[1:05:25] too much don't give too much weight to
[1:05:26] that got several quotations to read
[1:05:29] though John 14 3 and if I go and prepare
[1:05:31] a place for you what does he say just
[1:05:32] prior to this let heart let not your
[1:05:34] heart be troubled
[1:05:35] I'm sharing with you these things so
[1:05:37] that in me you'll find peace and me
[1:05:38] you'll find Joy if I go and prepare a
[1:05:40] place for you I will come again
[1:05:42] and receive you unto myself that where I
[1:05:45] am there you may be also could be that
[1:05:47] this sermon here this part here is
[1:05:49] worthy of a much broader attention maybe
[1:05:51] a service in itself but I will come
[1:05:53] again I will return I will come back and
[1:05:56] receive you remember he comes three
[1:05:57] times he says I'll come again and
[1:05:59] receive you unto myself this last
[1:06:01] statement we read Wednesday night and
[1:06:02] broken cisterns why don't you turn to
[1:06:04] him where God is our abundant supply of
[1:06:06] Joy our abundant Supply and Praises our
[1:06:08] abundant Supply and satisfaction the
[1:06:10] calmness of my nerves comes from God
[1:06:12] when I'm tore up I find my satisfaction
[1:06:15] in Christ not in a cigarette not in the
[1:06:17] things of the world not enjoying some
[1:06:18] Cree Creed but in finding him
[1:06:22] the promised word that he said if I go
[1:06:24] away I will come again to receive you I
[1:06:28] find my joy in that
[1:06:29] he says he is my joy
[1:06:32] there's something in this that God wants
[1:06:33] us to Joy in
[1:06:35] he says if I if I go away I will come
[1:06:37] again
[1:06:39] and receive you unto myself this word
[1:06:42] receive
[1:06:43] literally means to take with oneself to
[1:06:47] join to oneself it means to choose one
[1:06:50] as a companion
[1:06:52] so it says I will come and I will take
[1:06:54] you to myself
[1:06:56] I will come and choose you so this
[1:06:59] coming now this is I want you to
[1:07:01] recognize this and this calling our name
[1:07:02] the the name coin it means more than
[1:07:04] just uh hoping that you hear the the
[1:07:07] enunciation of a name that somebody's
[1:07:10] given you or even a new uh nomination
[1:07:12] that God may give you that relates to a
[1:07:14] natural name but this coming is an act
[1:07:17] of salvation
[1:07:19] this is him receiving this this
[1:07:22] receiving the script says is him taking
[1:07:25] what he's already chosen just as God had
[1:07:28] already chosen David but now he had the
[1:07:30] prophet had to go into this house and he
[1:07:32] had to name the one that God had Chosen
[1:07:34] and he didn't just show up say this name
[1:07:36] on this paper he's the next king
[1:07:37] something had to manifest he had to see
[1:07:39] it by attribute he had to see it by
[1:07:41] character and that was the naming now
[1:07:43] when Jesus says I will come again and
[1:07:45] receive you unto myself it's the same
[1:07:47] concept of naming you have chosen me
[1:07:50] I've taken the book and I've eaten it
[1:07:52] and your word is a joy and rejoice in my
[1:07:54] heart because I have been called by your
[1:07:56] name you have chosen me to Bear your
[1:07:59] name you have taken me and you have
[1:08:01] placed me the word has identified who I
[1:08:05] am
[1:08:06] and that's exactly what this means this
[1:08:08] receiving is him coming to take what
[1:08:10] he's chosen
[1:08:11] the prophecy this is prophecy of his
[1:08:14] coming as a bridegroom
[1:08:16] to claim his bride to unite with her
[1:08:19] brother Brandman souls in prison now he
[1:08:20] says then the lamb came for what he
[1:08:22] redeemed he come to claim what he had
[1:08:24] redeemed he's already got it right here
[1:08:26] in the book taken it from his hand now
[1:08:28] he's coming to receive what he's
[1:08:30] redeemed that's his work he's done he's
[1:08:33] come to receive it
[1:08:34] I think we read it last service last
[1:08:36] Sunday but now is the bride calling
[1:08:40] now is when the Seven Seals are open
[1:08:42] have been opened so the seventh seals
[1:08:44] are open to do what call the bride
[1:08:47] now is the bride called the bridegroom
[1:08:48] call will come right through this now
[1:08:50] when the Bride come in of Christ there's
[1:08:52] a language brother I'm choosing to try
[1:08:53] to articulate this truth
[1:08:55] that the word been restored in this hour
[1:08:57] is to bring you forth to receive you
[1:09:01] unto himself
[1:09:03] the the whole revelation of the son of
[1:09:04] man is a union
[1:09:06] between Christ the word and his bride
[1:09:08] and the proving his word Brotherhood
[1:09:09] says at the coming of the son of man
[1:09:10] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:09:12] not no more as a church see not no more
[1:09:14] the bride is called in that day the son
[1:09:18] of man be revealed to join the church to
[1:09:20] the head to unite the marriage of the
[1:09:23] Bride
[1:09:24] this is what's happening this time
[1:09:26] there's a United now coming into
[1:09:28] receiving to myself I'll come again to
[1:09:29] take you as my companion come to take
[1:09:32] you to myself to unite with you this is
[1:09:34] the name this is what it means to be
[1:09:35] called by his name this is what it means
[1:09:37] to have our name called
[1:09:39] even in the concept of the in Western
[1:09:41] culture in the wedding ceremony because
[1:09:43] not every wedding ceremony is the same
[1:09:45] as ours but in the western culture just
[1:09:47] as a type the woman changes her name at
[1:09:49] the time of marriage
[1:09:51] right whenever the engagement
[1:09:52] announcement is sent out you have the
[1:09:54] parents uh announcing the the engagement
[1:09:57] of their son and their daughter and
[1:09:59] they're still unique family
[1:10:00] identifications but what the you once
[1:10:03] the union takes place is I now introduce
[1:10:05] to you Mr and Mrs Aaron McGeary and
[1:10:09] she's her identity now has been assumed
[1:10:11] into that of the bridegroom her she is
[1:10:13] no longer fiancee she is no longer a uh
[1:10:16] uh someone that's engaged no longer a
[1:10:19] girlfriend but now the word changes and
[1:10:21] we call her on her wedding day bride but
[1:10:23] what does she become she becomes wife
[1:10:25] so there's a name change there's a
[1:10:27] designation change why because now she
[1:10:30] has been chosen to bear his name and to
[1:10:33] actually be a manifestation of his
[1:10:35] character
[1:10:36] she actually becomes the first
[1:10:38] revelation of what he wants his home to
[1:10:40] be a revelation of the future home
[1:10:46] and brother Bram says in the first seal
[1:10:48] and remember all these different
[1:10:50] statements we've been reading in the
[1:10:51] first silly says now it's been revealed
[1:10:52] whose names are in that book so it comes
[1:10:54] back later in that sermon he says and
[1:10:56] it's only to be revealed in the last
[1:10:57] days
[1:10:58] when the actual seal is broken broken to
[1:11:00] who it's not broken to Christ he says
[1:11:02] not to Christ
[1:11:03] but to the church notice now oh my that
[1:11:07] just makes me tremble
[1:11:10] there's something about this opening
[1:11:12] it's making him tremble oh my this is so
[1:11:14] significant it just makes me tremble he
[1:11:17] says I hope that the church fully
[1:11:18] understands it see what I mean you
[1:11:21] people
[1:11:22] and then he makes this I know you've all
[1:11:23] heard it many times before he says I'm
[1:11:25] going to call you bride that you'll
[1:11:27] understand it
[1:11:29] and that's when he comes to this
[1:11:30] critical point reason who are the Seals
[1:11:32] open to who are the Seals open to and he
[1:11:35] says the church but then he says all
[1:11:37] this makes me tremble why because it's
[1:11:39] not to everyone it's to a specific group
[1:11:42] of people that God has already chosen in
[1:11:44] his heart a very group of people that
[1:11:46] God has set his Prophet just as he did
[1:11:49] the prophet to Jesse's house he's got a
[1:11:51] name he's got a name the queen he's got
[1:11:54] to name the wife he's got a name the
[1:11:56] bride and so he says I just can't say
[1:11:58] church because there's a lot of people
[1:12:00] that call themselves church but I'll
[1:12:02] call you bride
[1:12:04] so that you'll understand
[1:12:06] just as they reckoned the genealogy
[1:12:08] first and everyone found their identity
[1:12:10] in the Scrolls and found their identity
[1:12:12] in the genealogy then the book was
[1:12:13] opened and they understood the meaning
[1:12:15] and they could have great rejoice and he
[1:12:17] says I'm going to call you bride so that
[1:12:19] you understand what I'm saying
[1:12:21] this is the name calling
[1:12:23] not the Annunciation of the name that
[1:12:25] your parents gave you not the Earthly
[1:12:27] name the the clarified or declined an
[1:12:29] earthening but it's an anointing on a
[1:12:32] Heavenly calling
[1:12:33] it's the anointing of a Heavenly
[1:12:35] identity
[1:12:37] if you see this in different places
[1:12:41] why would he change or just why would he
[1:12:43] change the name why would he just keep
[1:12:44] saying church because once you change
[1:12:46] the name it changes things
[1:12:48] I found this out in the Spanish language
[1:12:50] I was in Honduras one year
[1:12:52] and um I was sitting down with an
[1:12:54] evangelist whose travels Hunters quite a
[1:12:55] bit very very frequently
[1:12:58] and um
[1:12:59] and he said we have ministers meetings
[1:13:01] every month and so we have dozens well
[1:13:03] over 50 ministers that come I mean we've
[1:13:05] been doing it for years I'm like that
[1:13:07] sounds awesome
[1:13:08] and I said do you guys ever have any
[1:13:09] disagreements right I'm getting the
[1:13:11] popcorn out
[1:13:12] tell me what you guys debate about oh no
[1:13:14] we've never had any disagreements I'm
[1:13:15] like well you guys aren't really talking
[1:13:18] no disagreements for there anybody I
[1:13:20] said in all these years you guys don't
[1:13:21] ever you've never had difference of
[1:13:23] opinions he goes oh well we had one guy
[1:13:25] who was trying to tell us that that the
[1:13:28] um the church is now the bride
[1:13:31] I'm like good
[1:13:34] Bueno
[1:13:35] yeah I like the CC
[1:13:38] uh and and he goes and he goes and um so
[1:13:41] he and I said so what was the problem
[1:13:43] again he goes well brother Branham
[1:13:44] called it uh said that the church was a
[1:13:48] no to Novia or his Novia and he's saying
[1:13:50] and so in the Spanish it means
[1:13:52] girlfriend
[1:13:53] and so they'd actually taken everything
[1:13:55] where brother Brandon was saying uh
[1:13:57] bride or using a word they're
[1:13:59] translating it to Novia
[1:14:02] and it conveyed the idea that we're
[1:14:04] still just engaged it's just as engaged
[1:14:06] it's just a girlfriend just a fiance and
[1:14:09] he's saying this guy was trying to tell
[1:14:10] us esposa and I'm like SI esposa that's
[1:14:13] correct oh right
[1:14:15] and I said well bro I'm gonna tell you I
[1:14:17] just have to I have to agree with that
[1:14:18] guy
[1:14:19] because this is what brother Brown was
[1:14:20] trying to show us is that we are not the
[1:14:23] one who's merely been a spouse we're not
[1:14:24] merely the girlfriend we're not in the
[1:14:26] age where we just just keep looking at
[1:14:28] the engagement ring and think this is
[1:14:30] wonderful but now's the time and the
[1:14:32] hour of the invisible Union now's the
[1:14:35] age where he comes to join himself with
[1:14:37] his bride
[1:14:38] brother Brown says it notice how he says
[1:14:40] this because this is why he's using a
[1:14:42] different name if this is where I'm like
[1:14:43] man I just wish I was a better preacher
[1:14:46] just wish I was a preacher that when you
[1:14:48] think why do you have to use a different
[1:14:49] name if you think about how what a name
[1:14:51] means to you
[1:14:53] and how you could be in a party talking
[1:14:55] and talking and talking to somebody says
[1:14:57] your name 15 feet away and you're like
[1:15:00] and now you're listening to them or at
[1:15:02] the very fact that someone who's in a
[1:15:04] persistent vegetative state their brain
[1:15:06] will be stimulated to their name or that
[1:15:08] even child children under sedation can
[1:15:11] be stimulated by their name you could be
[1:15:13] sitting here with amnesia not have any
[1:15:16] idea who you are not even know what your
[1:15:19] relationship is what your inheritance is
[1:15:21] but then a prophet stands and says I'm
[1:15:23] not going to call you church I'll call
[1:15:25] you bride and somebody says whoa what
[1:15:28] was that
[1:15:30] somebody else is just over there going
[1:15:35] and you're like wait wait wait what
[1:15:37] what was that where'd that come from
[1:15:39] what did he say
[1:15:42] he had to identify the correct person in
[1:15:45] order to stimulate the bride to her feet
[1:15:47] had to get her attention she may not
[1:15:49] even known it she's shadowing something
[1:15:51] else she's shadowing this ministry she's
[1:15:52] shadowing this thing she's shadowing
[1:15:54] this hobby she's shadowing the world
[1:15:55] she's shadowing politics she's shadowing
[1:15:58] this but then one day a prophet says
[1:16:00] your name you're like
[1:16:02] wait a minute
[1:16:04] you may not understand it all at first
[1:16:05] but he had to say it in such a way to
[1:16:08] precisely identify the one that God had
[1:16:10] named
[1:16:12] in the sermon the breach he says the
[1:16:13] seals were broke why this is where we're
[1:16:15] bringing it to this bride uniting part
[1:16:17] in the last Church age to reveal these
[1:16:20] truths why the lamb broke the seals and
[1:16:22] revealed them to his church
[1:16:24] in order to collect his subjects for his
[1:16:26] kingdom his bride
[1:16:29] he opens the seals in order to collect
[1:16:32] his bride to gather his bride he wants
[1:16:34] to bring his subjects to him now what is
[1:16:36] it now this is a very broad statement
[1:16:38] that shows us that we're in this process
[1:16:39] at the opening of the word Out of the
[1:16:41] Dust of the earth out of the bottom of
[1:16:42] the sea out of the pits out of
[1:16:44] everywhere and every place
[1:16:46] out of the reasons of the dark out of
[1:16:48] paradise wherever they may be
[1:16:52] whether it be Paradise Valley whether it
[1:16:54] be over here whether it be over there
[1:16:56] doesn't matter where it may be wherever
[1:16:58] they may be he will call and they will
[1:17:01] answer
[1:17:02] he will call and they will answer he
[1:17:04] will come to get his subjects he
[1:17:06] revealed his secrets and they saw it
[1:17:11] do you see what this name calling is
[1:17:14] I hope you can see it as much more than
[1:17:15] just well when a name is called the name
[1:17:17] is called that has even has some
[1:17:20] uh
[1:17:23] some date on the calendar some
[1:17:25] particular moment
[1:17:27] it's been declared there's been a
[1:17:29] declaration made
[1:17:31] I I don't want to get into some of the
[1:17:33] statements from the sermon but let me
[1:17:34] just make reference to it the sermon the
[1:17:36] choosing of a bride
[1:17:39] brother Ram's not just re-preaching the
[1:17:40] election
[1:17:41] it's not just re-preaching
[1:17:42] predestination
[1:17:44] when he preaches choosing the variety
[1:17:45] he's not just preaching that there's
[1:17:46] always been an elect group in every age
[1:17:48] or there's always been a bride in every
[1:17:49] age that's not what he's preaching but
[1:17:51] he's actually preaching the choosing of
[1:17:53] a bride that God is now he's preaching a
[1:17:56] very specific dispensation he's placing
[1:17:58] the church as no longer church but as
[1:18:00] Bride As wife
[1:18:03] because it was the time and dispensation
[1:18:05] of the marriage
[1:18:07] so he uses a different language he even
[1:18:09] says bright age
[1:18:10] I'm going to call you bride so that
[1:18:12] maybe there'll be a deeper understanding
[1:18:13] what is it I'm using this phrase it's a
[1:18:16] name change
[1:18:17] why because the season changed
[1:18:21] brother Raymond the sermon the invisible
[1:18:22] Union of the bride of Christ I have this
[1:18:23] in a statement from the second seal
[1:18:24] we're going to close on
[1:18:26] and he says in the visible Union of the
[1:18:27] Bride of the of the bride of Christ
[1:18:30] he's talking about other days Wesley
[1:18:32] Luther Pentecost he said this is another
[1:18:34] day this is the open of the Seven Seals
[1:18:38] and he makes this acknowledgment I know
[1:18:39] it sounds strange to you but God has
[1:18:41] Vindicated it so perfectly there's no
[1:18:43] question on it just perfectly and then
[1:18:46] notice what he says I ain't scattering
[1:18:48] that to the local assembly here no
[1:18:50] offense Brother Moore right
[1:18:52] he said I'm not just saying this here
[1:18:54] but I'm speaking to people out Across
[1:18:56] the Nation
[1:18:57] who is he trying to his intention was he
[1:18:59] trying to catch do you do what you wish
[1:19:01] to
[1:19:02] notice the anointed word of this day of
[1:19:05] which you are a part by predestination
[1:19:06] you immediately like knew when you heard
[1:19:10] that
[1:19:11] the word in its season when you heard
[1:19:13] that the open of the seals when you
[1:19:15] heard that
[1:19:17] you knew right quick that you were an
[1:19:19] eagle
[1:19:21] do you realize what what this is the
[1:19:24] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:19:26] why because he did the choosing now he
[1:19:28] does the u19. he identifies the season
[1:19:31] the chosen of a bride because now it's
[1:19:33] the time of the Union the wedding is
[1:19:34] taking place now the marriage is taking
[1:19:36] place now this is what you're enjoying
[1:19:39] right now is a union with your mate the
[1:19:41] revealed word
[1:19:42] and it has to do with your identity and
[1:19:44] he uses this story he says when you
[1:19:46] heard that you knew real quick that you
[1:19:47] were an eagle
[1:19:48] he's alluding to his story about the the
[1:19:51] the eagle who the the farmer had found
[1:19:53] the eagle egg and put it in the barnyard
[1:19:55] with the chickens and so the eagle was
[1:19:57] born with it with the chickens
[1:19:59] and so here he is where he lives is in a
[1:20:02] barnyard what he eats is what chickens
[1:20:04] eat where he sleeps is where chickens
[1:20:05] sleep everything about him is related to
[1:20:08] chickens and he might have just been
[1:20:09] called one of the chickens he might have
[1:20:12] been chicken number six
[1:20:13] hey
[1:20:14] and and here he is amongst all the
[1:20:16] chickens but there's something about the
[1:20:18] light that was on the inside of him
[1:20:20] that began to develop and to begin to
[1:20:22] grow because he had a different identity
[1:20:24] and I I know this has been related
[1:20:26] before but it's it it Bears just
[1:20:29] reminding ourselves
[1:20:31] of everyone in that barnyard the
[1:20:33] chickens never wanted the eagle to wake
[1:20:35] up
[1:20:37] like an endless Buffet
[1:20:39] hey
[1:20:41] so the chickens knew they all probably
[1:20:43] had these conversations look
[1:20:45] if he ever recognizes who he is
[1:20:48] right he's going to have us for
[1:20:50] breakfast lunch and dinner
[1:20:51] hey he's going to be it's going to be
[1:20:54] one of these keto diets
[1:20:55] he won't go around Chicken Scratch now
[1:20:57] he's not going to be eating the grain
[1:20:58] he's not going to be eating The
[1:20:59] Leftovers he's gonna be eating us
[1:21:01] and so they had there was a collusion
[1:21:03] and a meeting of Mines let's do
[1:21:05] everything we can to make sure that
[1:21:07] eagle always thinks it's a chicken
[1:21:09] you don't think the same conspiracies in
[1:21:11] place in today and laodicea you don't
[1:21:13] think the whole world is clamoring the
[1:21:14] way that it is because they just really
[1:21:16] don't want you to recognize who you are
[1:21:17] muddy everything up make everything
[1:21:19] confusing bully people cause fear of
[1:21:21] this fear of that why because they don't
[1:21:23] want you to recognize Who You Are we
[1:21:25] hear the phrase oh when the bride
[1:21:26] recognizes who she is do you realize
[1:21:28] then self-recognition how important it
[1:21:29] is how much your name has to do with
[1:21:32] self-recognition how much it has to do
[1:21:33] with identifying you and brother bear
[1:21:35] says when you heard that you knew right
[1:21:37] quick you were an eagle
[1:21:39] and how is the story related that the
[1:21:41] eagle flew over the Barnyard and
[1:21:44] screamed
[1:21:45] and and the story it's not a name
[1:21:49] right
[1:21:51] it's not it's not yelling out to Bow
[1:21:53] it's not yelling out to whatever the
[1:21:55] name might have been of that bird but it
[1:21:57] was an eagle scream it was an eagle cry
[1:22:00] and what was that just think about what
[1:22:02] it was it was the manifestation of a
[1:22:05] mature Eagle it was the manifestation of
[1:22:07] its origin where it came from it was a
[1:22:10] manifestation of its life it was a
[1:22:12] manifestation of its Destiny it was its
[1:22:14] origin it was its present state it was
[1:22:16] its Destiny all being revealed from the
[1:22:18] air all being revealed from the sky a
[1:22:21] declaration being made and when the
[1:22:22] eagle heard it he said that's me
[1:22:26] that's who I am that's my identity
[1:22:29] that's what I was called to be and that
[1:22:31] awakened it stimulated something in that
[1:22:33] Eagle's mind and the neurons begin to
[1:22:36] Fire and said that's who I am that's
[1:22:38] where I belong I don't belong here
[1:22:40] anymore
[1:22:41] the very Act of the message being
[1:22:43] declared is the calling of your name
[1:22:49] oh Hallelujah
[1:22:51] and then in the second seal
[1:22:53] brother Bradham again this is a theme
[1:22:55] that's quite extensive
[1:22:58] and he's praying I've thought of why
[1:22:59] don't people come and listen
[1:23:02] why don't they come and accept it
[1:23:05] but of course I know that you said they
[1:23:07] wouldn't so they won't
[1:23:10] but there's some
[1:23:12] that's got their names written on the
[1:23:14] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:23:16] hope you can catch this notice how
[1:23:18] detailed this is and when them seals are
[1:23:20] thrown open there
[1:23:22] they see their name there
[1:23:25] and the Holy Spirit speaks to them
[1:23:28] they come
[1:23:30] Hallelujah when the seals are open they
[1:23:33] see their name the Holy Spirit speaks
[1:23:34] them they come you can't keep them away
[1:23:38] I thought of why people don't come and
[1:23:39] listen why don't they come and accept it
[1:23:41] he goes but you said they wouldn't so
[1:23:42] they don't
[1:23:43] but there's some
[1:23:45] when the word is open they see their
[1:23:47] names just like John they see their
[1:23:49] names and the Holy Spirit speaks them
[1:23:50] and they come you can't keep them away
[1:23:52] no one can
[1:23:53] no one they're coming anyhow because you
[1:23:57] are leading them like you did those
[1:23:59] little birds and sheep in the cattle
[1:24:00] Thou Art God
[1:24:02] it's referring to how he saw it
[1:24:04] demonstrated there in the East and in
[1:24:06] India where the earthquake was coming
[1:24:09] and just prior to the earthquake all the
[1:24:10] cattle all the birds moved from the
[1:24:12] precarious places moved away from the
[1:24:13] wall he said that was God leading the
[1:24:16] nature away from those dangerous
[1:24:17] situations because the earthquake was
[1:24:19] coming and he says would God moved those
[1:24:22] little birds and sheep and the cattle he
[1:24:23] says they're coming anyhow because
[1:24:26] you're leading them
[1:24:29] how are we being led
[1:24:31] how are we being drawn forth he says the
[1:24:33] seals were opened and you see your name
[1:24:35] is that plain
[1:24:37] and he says they're coming not that they
[1:24:40] will come
[1:24:41] that means a book has been opened and
[1:24:44] your name is being called
[1:24:46] and that's what we're listening for
[1:24:49] is to hear our names
[1:24:51] not that it would be so precise that it
[1:24:53] would give my name and my address and
[1:24:55] how tall I am and
[1:24:57] the date I was born
[1:24:59] but something deeper than that
[1:25:03] something that has to do with
[1:25:04] self-recognition
[1:25:06] musicians if you'd please come
[1:25:11] will close with on this
[1:25:17] could we stand together
