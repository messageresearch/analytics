[0:00] Job chapter 14:
[0:03] 7-9 and there's a lot more in this uh
[0:07] than maybe I have in the text um this
[0:10] was a a painting by a Russian artist I
[0:13] thought was just real engaging uh here
[0:16] recently when I saw it and this is a
[0:17] picture of job and his comforter or his
[0:20] friends and this is job speaking in job
[0:22] Chapter 14 verse 7 for there is hope of
[0:25] a tree if it be cut down that it will
[0:29] Sprout again and that the tender Branch
[0:31] thereof will not cease though the root
[0:33] thereof wax old in the earth and the
[0:35] stock thereof die in the ground yet
[0:37] through the scent of water it will bud
[0:39] and bring forth boughs like a plant and
[0:41] then the next verse is but man dieth and
[0:43] wasteth away yay man giveth up The Ghost
[0:45] and where is he so he's lamenting this
[0:48] uh this the brevity of man while looking
[0:51] at how this tree would die and then come
[0:54] back up again and so we desire that God
[0:56] would Quicken these words to us to see
[0:58] Jesus Christ in it that we be a blessing
[1:00] to us you can be
[1:02] seated I'm going to pick up with a
[1:04] statement from a sermon a man running
[1:07] from the presence of the Lord and He
[1:10] brother Bram says do you believe God is
[1:12] in all
[1:13] inspiration and sounds like a trick
[1:15] question because there's certain things
[1:16] that maybe we would say are inspired or
[1:18] certain things that brother brandham
[1:20] even himself says you could be going in
[1:22] Inspiration it could be contrary to the
[1:23] word of God uh and so I believe what
[1:26] he's referring to here is that things
[1:28] that are inspired or kind kind of points
[1:30] you back to things that are in the word
[1:32] of God or things that he confirms that
[1:34] God is in Inspiration he's one that
[1:37] inspires and he says God has to write a
[1:39] song Do You Believe God is in songs and
[1:42] there so he's asking these questions
[1:43] about inspiration and uh to write songs
[1:45] and things and in this particular place
[1:47] he's referring to a poem that he wrote
[1:49] when he was 12 years old and how he
[1:52] wrote of a longing to see something and
[1:54] then in this particular place he's
[1:55] saying and this thing I wrote when I was
[1:57] 12 it happened this very thing I longed
[1:59] to do and to see and those cattling
[2:01] mountains and hear the coyote howling it
[2:04] it came to pass as it were so he's
[2:06] saying hey there's this inspiration even
[2:08] as a youth that I saw fulfilled in my
[2:10] adult life he says Jesus said so he
[2:13] referred back to David don't you know
[2:14] what David said in the Psalms look at
[2:16] the very crucifixion David sang it in
[2:19] SEC 22nd Psalm my God my God why hast
[2:22] Thou forsaken me all my bones they stare
[2:25] at me they pierce my hands and my feet
[2:27] he says you know and that was the song
[2:31] and he points to how the Psalms were
[2:33] songs and that they could be sung and
[2:34] there could be music added to it and
[2:36] these were The Inspirations of different
[2:38] writers and some written by David others
[2:41] by different artists and that God was
[2:43] behind this utterance in Psalms 22 where
[2:46] you read and says oh they forsaken me my
[2:48] bones stare at me and you think well uh
[2:50] here's David or here's this writer and
[2:52] he's in this time when his enemies
[2:53] pursuing him and his tongue Cleaves to
[2:55] his mouth and all these different ways
[2:57] that a person's described in the Book of
[2:59] Psalms but yet it's prophesying of a
[3:01] future event of Christ being a sacrifice
[3:04] and hanging on the cross as these
[3:06] artists uh painted some of these
[3:07] pictures they're trying to picture
[3:09] Psalms 22 that is fulfilled on the cross
[3:13] in the
[3:14] crucifixion and brother BR saying that
[3:16] was
[3:19] inspiration God was in the inspiration
[3:22] to write the
[3:23] psalm and then it was fulfilled on
[3:27] Calvary my title tonight is original
[3:30] inspiration I went through different
[3:32] iterations of a working title then I
[3:35] kind of found fell down a different
[3:36] Rabbit Hole uh I will put this out there
[3:39] as uh extra credit to those who are able
[3:42] to tell me or know what that rabbit hole
[3:45] was uh that gave uh inspiration to this
[3:49] title original inspiration that's my
[3:52] title tonight and I want to deal with
[3:54] the subject of inspiration because God
[3:57] inspires God is in Inspiration he
[3:59] inspires the writing of the psalm why
[4:01] because it was going to prophesy of a
[4:03] time that his son was going to be
[4:05] hanging on the cross fulfilling these
[4:06] very words so God writes songs and God
[4:10] inspires now in 2 Timothy 3:1 16 we
[4:14] covered this recently he says all
[4:16] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[4:19] and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro
[4:22] for correction for instruction in
[4:24] righteousness there is saying that the
[4:26] Bible is God inspired the Bible is the
[4:29] product of God's inspiration we used it
[4:31] I think in the first service of the year
[4:33] to say that the Bible is a work of art
[4:35] and God is the artist and it was by his
[4:38] inspiration whether we say it was
[4:40] commissioned by these prophets of old uh
[4:42] God commissioned these prophets of old
[4:43] to write it but God inspires the word of
[4:46] God and it's profitable this inspiration
[4:49] speaks of the very Breath of God the
[4:51] very labor of God when you exert
[4:53] yourself and you labor you breathe out
[4:55] you you you your breath begins to heave
[4:57] and this word means to breathe to or to
[5:00] blow upon so it's this idea that the
[5:03] Bible is written through uh Divine or
[5:05] Supernatural influence as if God was
[5:07] breathing life into the writer as if it
[5:10] was God that was laboring and bringing
[5:13] the inspiration to cause the one to
[5:14] write brother Bram in the sermon God
[5:17] identified himself by his
[5:19] characteristics and I think we're going
[5:20] to come back to uh this sermon a little
[5:23] bit later or it's a very similar uh
[5:26] sermon that he preaches on
[5:28] identification during the same time time
[5:30] of year and he says the word come to
[5:32] them and they wrote it wrote it down
[5:33] under inspiration first they were
[5:36] identified prophets then they wrote the
[5:38] word of inspiration and they had the
[5:40] interpretation of the divine revelation
[5:42] because it was God in the man not that
[5:45] it was all entirely fulfilled but yet
[5:47] they had this a Divine unction and
[5:49] Revelation this inspiration and it
[5:51] caused them to give utterance and to
[5:53] write these things down he says and and
[5:55] I find this statement worth chewing on
[5:57] now that's the way he showed himself in
[5:59] his characteristics of identification so
[6:02] it's saying God identified himself by
[6:04] his characteristics Christ identified
[6:06] the same uh in every generation so he
[6:08] has certain attributes and certain
[6:10] natures and certain characteristics and
[6:12] he says God through by inspiration would
[6:15] bring an expression those are my summary
[6:17] terms and that's how he showed himself
[6:20] by his characteristics his identified
[6:22] characteristics their Vision being
[6:24] Vindicated was God's characteristic in
[6:26] them making himself known to the people
[6:30] so God inspired the prophets to write
[6:33] God inspired them to give utterance it
[6:35] was divine revelation their speaking
[6:37] then takes things that are symbolic and
[6:40] things that maybe were uh images in
[6:42] their minds and in their hearts
[6:43] sometimes we see this operating where
[6:45] God inspires one to speak and they speak
[6:48] with a language that is symbolic and
[6:50] it's foretelling and yet that's giving
[6:52] form it's giving sound to something that
[6:54] was inspired he said that's how God has
[6:56] shed himself by his characteristics is
[6:58] through these this
[7:00] inspiration in them God's
[7:03] characteristics being made known in them
[7:06] inspiration uh comes from a Latin word
[7:08] which means to breathe into so whether
[7:10] we're looking at it in terms of the uh
[7:12] the Greek as it's used here the very
[7:14] Breath of God theop noos which is the
[7:17] inspiration of God inspires the same way
[7:21] in the Middle Ages the use of the word
[7:22] inspiration was often linked to Divine
[7:25] influence or holy influence and so
[7:27] things that were inspired you didn't say
[7:29] oh I I was all inspired to go do this if
[7:31] you use that term you're suggesting that
[7:33] God caused you to do it God was
[7:36] breathing this creative or this
[7:38] intellectual uh uh life into the
[7:41] individual and it was inspiring them to
[7:42] write great works it was inspiring them
[7:45] to paint and certainly the concept has
[7:48] broadened to include really any source
[7:49] of creativity or motivation say uh
[7:52] you're my inspiration these are things
[7:54] that are inspired but to be inspired or
[7:56] inspiration is the process of being
[7:58] stimulated to
[8:00] creative to ignite uh uh creativity to
[8:03] motivate somebody that's what
[8:04] inspiration is so in a broad sense
[8:07] there's a lot of inspiration out there
[8:08] well why did you do that I was inspired
[8:10] when I saw this why are you on this very
[8:13] absolutely crazy diet well so and so
[8:16] inspired me to do it and so you find
[8:18] that there's different ways that we get
[8:19] inspired and we give vent to that
[8:21] inspiration and act on it but in
[8:23] original sense inspiration was something
[8:26] that was coming from the
[8:28] supernatural not not natural things but
[8:30] Supernatural inspiring the natural so
[8:32] that God could identify his
[8:34] characteristics in people and make
[8:37] himself known to
[8:39] people if you'll turn with me to Genesis
[8:41] chapter
[8:44] 1 I'd like to uh start with verse
[8:48] 11 and I realized now I i' meant to
[8:53] uh I think even in in in dealing with
[8:55] this particular
[8:57] subject it ties in in very beautifully
[9:00] with what was ministered Sunday morning
[9:03] and and how that we could just the the
[9:06] the foundation the building of the
[9:09] Prophet test and then how that God's
[9:11] purpose and his vision was Christ in you
[9:13] the hope of glory god being expressed
[9:16] and I think of all the sermons that have
[9:18] been ministered in this church I may
[9:19] have gotten more more positive feedback
[9:21] from this past weekend than any other
[9:24] and for me personally I feel it's one of
[9:25] the best sermons we've heard as a young
[9:27] church it was so uh inspired for the
[9:30] moment that we're living in right now
[9:32] it's very very beautiful and so I would
[9:34] almost say it's mandatory listening uh
[9:37] but it was very very encouraging and
[9:39] Genesis 1: 11 and 12 I know this is uh
[9:42] maybe my go-to or my crutch i' like to
[9:45] go back into the Book of Genesis and
[9:46] bring these things out I feel as if I
[9:48] was rest if I was restricted to three
[9:50] chapters and I could choose them I could
[9:52] choose Genesis chapters 1 2 and three
[9:54] and preach the rest of my life from them
[9:56] because it's just so it's the seed
[9:58] chapters and it says here in the middle
[10:00] of the creation and God said let the
[10:02] Earth bring forth grass the herb
[10:05] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[10:06] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[10:09] is in itself upon the earth now there's
[10:12] a lot that's being uh expressed through
[10:15] these words and it could paint a a
[10:17] picture to where God says to this earth
[10:20] that exist to bring forth grass and also
[10:23] this herb yielding seed and also trees
[10:26] who have fruit and each one is going to
[10:28] bring forth a uh after its kind and its
[10:33] seed is in itself all these things that
[10:36] are already in the earth there something
[10:37] already inside of them and So speaking
[10:39] to it he says let them bring forth let
[10:42] the Earth bring forth and the Bible says
[10:44] and it was so that means God spoke and
[10:47] it happened and verse 12 gives us a
[10:49] little bit more color to it and the
[10:51] Earth brought forth grass and Herb
[10:53] yielding seed after his kind and the
[10:56] tree yielding fruit whose seed was in
[10:58] itself after his kind and God saw that
[11:01] it was good if we could just paint this
[11:04] picture in our minds of God creating we
[11:07] come to this part here in the scripture
[11:08] where God now speaks to the Earth which
[11:10] was then existing and he says let the
[11:13] Earth bring forth grass let the Earth
[11:16] bring forth the herb yielding seed let
[11:18] the Earth bring forth the tree and it
[11:21] says that this Earth brought forth grass
[11:23] and the herb yielding seed brought forth
[11:25] after his kind and the tree that yields
[11:27] fruit brought after its kind whose seed
[11:30] for each one the seed was in itself and
[11:32] God saw that it was good after it was so
[11:35] pay careful attention to this because
[11:37] herein lies God's law of creation
[11:41] brother bam called it God's law of
[11:43] reproduction I it's an interesting term
[11:46] to use for me as I've been looking at it
[11:47] through the lens of
[11:49] Art and what you don't want when it
[11:52] comes to Art Is A reproduction sometimes
[11:54] and there's been many uh things that
[11:56] were not Originals passed off as
[11:58] reproduction
[12:00] and uh we I think we mentioned Thomas
[12:02] concade before he was uh where he was
[12:04] successful was in commercializing
[12:06] reproductions and selling them at a very
[12:08] very high price because he had a barn
[12:09] full of people who put brush Strokes on
[12:12] the pictures and made it look like an
[12:14] original but in reality a lot of it was
[12:16] mass-produced and I'm not just bagging
[12:18] on uh Thomas KC I never knew him as a
[12:21] brother so i' just have to go by what
[12:23] you read but there's these things are
[12:25] reproductions they're not the original
[12:27] and there's ways that things can be
[12:28] passed off as the original but here this
[12:31] is God's law of reproduction but not in
[12:34] the sense of a bad copy not in the sense
[12:36] of passing off something that is not
[12:38] original so it's not an imp uh an
[12:41] impersonation but it's a further
[12:43] expression and focus with me I think
[12:46] it's very important for us to look at
[12:47] this scripture and try to uh grasp what
[12:51] is actually taking place and recognize
[12:54] that as God says let the Earth bring
[12:56] forth grass and herb and and fruit from
[12:59] God's word is empowering the Earth with
[13:02] the inherent ability to bring forth
[13:06] life he had already put the potential in
[13:08] the seed and now he says let them bring
[13:10] forth after the seed that is in itself
[13:13] so when God speaks this it's not just
[13:15] about the physical act of producing
[13:16] plants or producing flower producing
[13:18] grass or FL fruit but it was for it was
[13:21] linked with purpose it had something to
[13:24] do with God's intent in the beginning
[13:26] the expression of what God had put
[13:28] inside in other words there was
[13:30] something in the earth that had not yet
[13:32] been made known there was something in
[13:34] the tree that had not been yet made
[13:35] known there was something in the herb uh
[13:38] uh plant that had not been made known
[13:40] and God is saying now let that come
[13:43] forth and when he uses the term let it
[13:47] would it implies permission or
[13:49] encouragement and so he said well let it
[13:52] bring forth but it's deeply connected
[13:53] with the idea of
[13:55] inspiration God is instilling in the
[13:58] Earth in the plant in the tree this
[14:00] Creative Energy to bring forth life he
[14:03] he he telling it go ahead and and bring
[14:06] forth what is in
[14:07] you inspiration is uh as we mentioned
[14:11] before in the Bible being written by
[14:12] inspiration it's that instilling of a
[14:14] spark this Breath of Life into something
[14:17] just like an artist who with a burst of
[14:19] inspiration uh begins to create
[14:21] something new and something beautiful
[14:23] God's words Infuse this Divine energy
[14:26] into the plant into the tree into the
[14:28] Earth Earth and it enables them to
[14:30] create and to bring forth in order to
[14:33] fulfill God's G their their god-given
[14:35] purpose has something to do with the
[14:37] original intent that God had when he
[14:39] made it and so creation if we could look
[14:43] at it in this sense and I'm hoping to uh
[14:46] create this image in your mind tonight
[14:49] that as God spoke and said let the Earth
[14:51] bring forth let the herb yielding seed
[14:53] bring forth let the fruit tree bring
[14:55] forth it was creation then responded to
[14:58] this divine inspiration by bearing the
[15:01] thing not so much what God had spoken to
[15:04] it but what his words had quickened that
[15:06] was already inside of
[15:08] them it brought to life that thing which
[15:11] was in them by the word so this when I
[15:14] speak of original
[15:15] inspiration it's this original
[15:17] inspiration is a motivating lifegiving
[15:21] force and it has this connection it's
[15:23] this it shows this connection even in
[15:25] Genesis 1: 11-2 it shows the connection
[15:28] between God original creation or God's
[15:30] will and his creation and how he has
[15:33] built his creation to respond to his
[15:36] inspiration and respond in a way that
[15:39] furthers what he
[15:41] did now if we could just read through
[15:43] this together without maybe stopping
[15:46] down for that length of time the same
[15:47] length of time as we did there in
[15:50] Genesis 1 but notice how this poetry
[15:52] works with Genesis 1:
[15:56] 26-31 and think of how God establishes
[15:59] this law of creation uh uh let the Earth
[16:03] not so much in God uh telling it to
[16:06] physically produce something but
[16:08] inspiring it to bring forth what's
[16:10] already in it God said let us make man
[16:12] in our image after our likeness and let
[16:15] them have dominion over the fish of the
[16:18] sea and over the foul of the air and
[16:19] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[16:20] and over every creeping thing that
[16:22] creepeth upon the Earth so there's God
[16:24] saying he's going to make man he's going
[16:26] to make a self-portrait in man and he's
[16:28] going to say he says let them have and
[16:31] says so God created man in his own image
[16:33] in the image of God created he him male
[16:35] and female created he them and God
[16:37] blessed them and God said unto them
[16:39] here's the commission be fruitful and
[16:41] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[16:43] subdue it and have dominion over the
[16:45] fish of the sea over the fowl of the air
[16:46] and over every living thing that moveth
[16:48] upon the Earth and God said behold now
[16:52] this is where I want you to uh use these
[16:54] words here to complete the picture of
[16:57] Genesis 1:1 where God is bringing forth
[17:00] uh every tree that has fruit on it every
[17:02] flowering plant every herb yielding
[17:04] plant all the grass continue to read
[17:06] where he sees he brings creeping thing
[17:07] over the Earth all these animals
[17:09] everything's being brought forth and he
[17:10] says to the man I have given you every
[17:13] herb bearing seed which is upon the face
[17:15] of all the Earth and every tree in the
[17:17] which is the fruit of a tree yielding
[17:19] seed to you it shall be for meat God had
[17:23] created all these things God had put the
[17:25] life inside of them whose seed was in
[17:27] itself to bring forth after its kind and
[17:30] he inspired it he used his he spoke to
[17:34] it giving it this energy to bring forth
[17:36] and now he's saying the very man that he
[17:38] has created is to enjoy and partake of
[17:40] those things and to every beast on the
[17:43] earth and every foul of the air and
[17:44] everything that creepeth upon the Earth
[17:46] wherein there is life now notice the
[17:49] life now has purpose it has use wherever
[17:52] there is life I've given every green
[17:54] herb for meat and it was so wherever
[17:57] there is life I've given it it to you to
[17:59] have to to control to have dominion over
[18:03] the Bible says and God saw everything
[18:05] that he had made and behold it was very
[18:07] good and the evening and the morning
[18:08] were the sixth
[18:10] day just as we saw God's word operating
[18:14] in a way upon creation to cause each
[18:16] seed to bring forth after its kind when
[18:19] God made Adam and the woman it was a
[18:22] similar Act of God creating and then
[18:26] inspiring this creation by telling them
[18:29] to be fruitful telling them to have
[18:32] dominion and as we read there in that
[18:34] last passage each part of creation is
[18:37] acting under their inspiration in
[18:39] harmony with God's will in order to
[18:41] bring forth each thing that would have
[18:43] use and utility to one
[18:45] another brother brandom in the
[18:47] fundamental Foundation of faith for
[18:49] Faith he makes this statement and it's
[18:52] one that I referred to quite often not
[18:53] sure if we've ever read it in its
[18:54] entirety here he says man was made a
[18:57] secondary God on Earth he was given the
[18:59] power to control all things all elements
[19:02] of the earth that was Adam Adam was
[19:05] given these great Powers so we could see
[19:07] Adam here in Genesis chapter 1 given
[19:09] these great powers to control to be
[19:11] fruitful to multiply and he's given
[19:14] power just like the tree was to bring
[19:16] forth fruit he and the woman were given
[19:18] power to bring forth as well and so he
[19:20] says but the power he was given to make
[19:23] himself is where he fell now we
[19:26] understand uh the original sin the power
[19:29] that Adam was given to make himself the
[19:31] power that they were given to reproduce
[19:34] and to create and bring forth life is
[19:36] where they fell he says Adam could speak
[19:38] to the winds and it would stop he could
[19:40] speak to the trees and they would obey
[19:41] him he could speak to the wildlife it
[19:42] would obey him he could speak to the
[19:44] waters everything what it was everything
[19:46] obeyed Adam that is the beginning of man
[19:49] that's what God gave him power over
[19:51] everything on the earth and everything
[19:53] operated in Harmony and continuity
[19:56] notice God had already put the the seed
[19:58] in the tree and the seed in the flower
[20:01] and the seed in each one of these uh
[20:03] Creations to bring forth of their kind
[20:05] and to multiply and to produce and to be
[20:07] fruit for Adam was going to have to
[20:09] fight with it he was going to have to
[20:10] water it wasn't going to have to toil
[20:12] with it and struggle with it in order
[20:13] for it to do it it's all doing it in
[20:15] harmony with God's perfect
[20:17] will he says though man lost that power
[20:21] he becomes unconscious of that fact
[20:23] after losing his relationship and
[20:25] fellowship friendship fellowship with
[20:27] the father then he lost that so this
[20:30] inspiration then uh this life this power
[20:33] this godliness it's it's it's hidden The
[20:36] Originals lost butam describes it this
[20:38] way he all his great channels become
[20:40] clogged and he couldn't get through God
[20:42] couldn't get through to him what Adam
[20:45] was in God Christ has redeemed us back
[20:47] to that now Our Redeemer to redeem
[20:50] anything is to bring it back to its
[20:51] origin again to bring it back to the
[20:55] original and I was I had prepared to go
[20:58] through a number of scriptures in the
[21:00] New Testament that show that we are cre
[21:03] creations of Christ and that we are the
[21:06] product of a new beginning and and
[21:08] there's this we we are representative of
[21:10] that race that new race that super race
[21:13] and those uh those in relation to Jesus
[21:15] Christ but instead of going down that
[21:18] direction we know those things are
[21:20] there if we could look at it in this
[21:23] sense again just reviewing this God
[21:26] speaks his word and things start coming
[21:28] into being I love reading where the
[21:31] rabbis would have conversations in these
[21:33] ancient texts over the creation and
[21:35] because they're all trying to PA it well
[21:37] what came first and what happened and
[21:38] what's important and yet we know that
[21:40] when God spoke where there was nothing
[21:42] something came to be and God use the
[21:45] elements that were then to be further
[21:46] bring forth things together and bring
[21:49] things out and we see that God creates
[21:51] by his spoken word there's things in
[21:54] that creation that God begins to speak
[21:56] to and Inspire to come forth
[21:59] doesn't say that God created certain
[22:01] things but he actually speaks again and
[22:03] he tells them to bring things
[22:06] forth and it's God working by
[22:10] inspiration it's in the original in the
[22:12] beginning according to that plan that he
[22:14] had now notice this about God's word in
[22:16] Isaiah 55:
[22:19] 8-1 for my thoughts are not your
[22:21] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[22:23] sayith the Lord and we can all very
[22:24] easily say
[22:27] Amen his thoughts are not our thoughts
[22:29] his ways are not our ways there's a
[22:31] scripture I'd like to connect with that
[22:33] maybe on Sunday for as the heavens are
[22:34] higher than the earth so are my ways
[22:36] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[22:38] than your thoughts and really if we
[22:40] could dig into that we'd find that we
[22:41] really don't know how distant they are
[22:44] we just know that our ways are not his
[22:47] our thoughts are not his and we thank
[22:49] God for
[22:50] that for as the rain cometh down and
[22:52] this speaks to really what he's trying
[22:54] to say and that his thoughts have more
[22:57] power and have more substance than our
[22:59] own vain thinking and imaginations for
[23:01] as the rain cometh down and the snow
[23:03] from heaven and returneth not thither
[23:05] but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring
[23:07] forth in Bud that it may give seed to
[23:09] the sewer and bread to the eater that's
[23:11] a great s sentence the rain comes down
[23:14] and however it comes and it does
[23:16] something to the earth when it comes
[23:18] down whether through rain or snow and
[23:20] that snow melt it Waters the Earth and
[23:23] it allows the Earth it maketh it bring
[23:25] forth it maketh it to Bud that in the
[23:29] budding and the growing and the Harvest
[23:31] it would give seed to the
[23:33] sewer and the one that sowed the seed in
[23:35] the harvesting it would give bread to
[23:37] the eater just notice all those
[23:39] beautiful layers in one scripture how
[23:42] that as the water comes down out of the
[23:44] Heavens to the Earth and then
[23:46] interacting with seed in the earth
[23:49] planted by a sewer and through that
[23:51] process of this water coming upon it it
[23:54] grows to a place to where one can
[23:56] Harvest it and put it in a for form to
[23:58] where it's now breed to the eater now
[24:01] that whole process of this uh from seed
[24:05] uhh uh to to bread and and as we could
[24:09] say maybe as as hipsters we'd say from
[24:11] Farm to Table that we would be able to
[24:14] bring this from the soil uh uh to the
[24:17] sour dough and now someone is going to
[24:19] be eating it and it's this whole process
[24:23] God the original
[24:25] artisan and notice how it says so shall
[24:28] my word be that goeth forth out of my
[24:31] mouth now there there's a lot there that
[24:34] I want you just to grab on to and really
[24:36] uh uh just say I want to I want to grab
[24:38] that I want to think about that the
[24:41] service isn't going to be ly tonight if
[24:43] I if I have my way it won't be lengthy I
[24:45] guess I don't have a plan on being long
[24:47] and so if it happens I can say it was
[24:48] God that did it or you but I want you to
[24:51] really focus intently because in this
[24:53] there's enough to grab a hold of to make
[24:55] a 2hour 4our roundtrip drive worth it
[24:58] so I really want you to think about this
[25:00] that God is saying my thoughts are not
[25:02] your thoughts my ways are not your ways
[25:04] and then he describes an entire process
[25:07] that we could begin to identify in the
[25:08] natural that has so many different
[25:10] implications and different areas and
[25:12] different points of contact he says so
[25:13] shall my word be that go forth out of my
[25:17] mouth what would begin as a thought and
[25:20] then be put into action because his
[25:21] thoughts are not our thoughts and his
[25:23] ways are not our ways between the
[25:26] thought and the way is a word and he
[25:28] says not my word that goes out of my
[25:29] mouth it will not return void unto me
[25:33] written here it shall not return unto me
[25:35] void but it shall accomplish that which
[25:38] I please and it shall prosper in the
[25:40] thing whereinto I sin it somebody
[25:44] commented on one of our videos saying
[25:45] watch your blood pressure when you
[25:46] scream the teaching gets lost so all
[25:50] apologies to the anonymous
[25:53] YouTuber is there a way that we could
[25:55] just modulate certain streams so it's
[25:57] just kind of cuts that out I don't know
[25:59] the technolog got to be
[26:01] there people can just subscribe to the
[26:03] LOI
[26:06] service so shall the word that goes out
[26:09] of my mouth will be just like the rain
[26:11] that comes down out of heaven and it it
[26:14] works within this overall process to go
[26:16] from seed to something
[26:19] useful it shall accomplish what I please
[26:21] it shall prosper in the thing where unto
[26:23] I sin it this is the power if we could
[26:25] catch this I I I was thinking in the
[26:27] beginning could be a real simple thought
[26:29] but then I begin to recognize no this is
[26:31] this is God's hiding in Simplicity but
[26:34] catch that God hides in
[26:35] simplicity so there's a mystery in the
[26:38] Simplicity he go oh well that's just
[26:40] really really simple and you're saying
[26:41] well where it's simple then God's in
[26:43] there somewhere and that's where people
[26:45] miss him so there's though it may be
[26:47] simple I'm saying there's something
[26:48] really deep that we can grab a hold of
[26:51] and cause us to be closely connected to
[26:53] God and his purpose this is the power
[26:55] now of the original inspiration wherein
[26:57] God referring to a natural process that
[26:59] he sets in motion under original
[27:02] inspiration there's something that God
[27:04] when he sets it in motion it must come
[27:06] to pass right there's this purpose of
[27:10] God that must be
[27:13] unbroken and it's embodied in that
[27:15] original intent that God had in the
[27:17] beginning where there was nothing
[27:19] interrupting it he created and he spoke
[27:21] and he said now let let it happen we
[27:23] said well they gave it permission he
[27:25] encouraged it he was trying to bring it
[27:27] forth he INSP ired it to do what he made
[27:29] it to
[27:31] do in job 38: 25 26 and
[27:40] 27 this is God speaking he says who hath
[27:44] divided a water course for the
[27:46] overflowing of waters or way for the
[27:48] lightning of
[27:50] thunder and this is in the midst of a
[27:52] lot of questions that God is asking job
[27:54] and now I want you to catch how God is
[27:56] speaking to job after job has spoken and
[27:59] now who is it it's rhetorical because we
[28:01] know it's God that does this to cause it
[28:04] to rain on the Earth where no man is on
[28:07] the Wilderness where there is no man to
[28:11] satisfy the desolate in waste ground and
[28:14] to cause the bud of the tender herb to
[28:17] Spring forth who's done that God
[28:21] has and he's saying that where no man
[28:23] has
[28:24] been there's uh the the myth in some
[28:29] well they're just uh the old wives tales
[28:32] or the Farmers Almanac they used to
[28:33] think that by cultivating ground they
[28:35] could actually uh bring light out of the
[28:38] soil and bring things out of the ground
[28:39] and actually cause it to rain and that
[28:42] was their solution in a lot of places
[28:43] where it was Barren even here in Arizona
[28:45] and some of the places uh uh in the
[28:47] plains like well we having a drought so
[28:49] just disc up the ground and dig up the
[28:50] ground and and get it really really
[28:52] loose and it'll start to rain and sure
[28:55] enough there was just by chance sh
[28:57] thunderstorms and they just thought well
[28:58] this is how how you get rain that man
[29:01] has something to do with it but God says
[29:05] that who causes it to rain where there
[29:07] is no man who causes it to rain in the
[29:10] wilderness where there is no man where
[29:13] it is a desolate in waste ground but yet
[29:16] God causes it to rain and where man has
[29:18] not sewn where man has not labored he
[29:21] can cause the butt of the tender plant
[29:23] the tender herb to Spring forth who does
[29:26] that God did that amen
[29:28] and it happens according to God's
[29:30] original design God did not create again
[29:34] to cause this to happen it is what God
[29:36] did in Genesis 1 and 12 he put it in the
[29:39] creation itself that it would work
[29:41] according to certain times and seasons
[29:44] and that according to the law that was
[29:45] in the planter and the seed no matter
[29:47] how much it hybrids no matter how much
[29:49] it's changed no matter how much it's
[29:50] manipulated no matter how much it adapts
[29:52] to its environment there's certain
[29:53] forces that work upon it where no man is
[29:56] and it will bring forth because God has
[29:59] done it it's his original design it's
[30:01] part of his original
[30:03] intent now what God says here is
[30:06] answering to a question that job had in
[30:09] Job chapter
[30:11] 14 where he's making this observation
[30:13] that when a man dies he just Wast
[30:16] away he dies and it's desolate it's
[30:19] Barren he gives up The Ghost and where
[30:21] is he Waters uh uh fail from the sea the
[30:26] flood decayeth and drith up and so man
[30:28] just he he falls down he dies and he
[30:30] can't rise back up but he says
[30:33] this and he makes this observation about
[30:35] nature now I want you to make this
[30:37] connection God says who causes rain to
[30:40] come upon the Earth that would allow the
[30:42] butt of the Tinder herb to Spring
[30:44] forth and now I'm working kind of
[30:47] backwards let's go back to job making
[30:50] this
[30:51] observation for there is a hope of a
[30:55] tree if it be cut down
[30:59] now follow exactly what he's saying a
[31:00] tree has been cut down the hope of a
[31:02] tree that has been cut down is that it
[31:05] will Sprout
[31:06] again and that the tender Branch thereof
[31:09] will not
[31:10] cease here's a tree being cut down and
[31:12] he's saying there's hope in that tree
[31:15] that even though it's cut down their
[31:16] tender Branch would not uh die or fade
[31:20] away though the root now the the the
[31:23] Poetry gets even more forceful though
[31:25] the root thereof waxed old in the earth
[31:29] and the stock thereof die in the ground
[31:33] so this is quite a picture not talking
[31:36] about an unhealthy tree that can be
[31:38] nursed back to life the root is dead the
[31:41] stock has died but there is a hope for
[31:44] this
[31:45] tree and it says yet through the scent
[31:48] of water it will bud and bring forth
[31:52] bowels like a
[31:54] plant one translation at least there's
[31:56] hope for a tree if it is cut down it
[31:59] will Sprout again and its new choots
[32:02] will not fail its roots May grow old in
[32:04] the ground and its stump die in the soil
[32:06] yet at the scent of water it'll bud and
[32:09] put forth shoots like a
[32:11] plant what was it that God is saying in
[32:14] Chapter 30 uh 38 what what was God
[32:17] saying who causes the tree that is cut
[32:21] down to be able to say There's Hope what
[32:25] would allow a tree whose root is dead
[32:28] and stock has died yet through some
[32:31] process the Bible says the scent of
[32:35] water the tree think of this how
[32:38] remarkable this is the tree has the
[32:40] potential to be revived with the
[32:44] scent the fragrance the
[32:47] aroma of
[32:48] water I believe it said that way for a
[32:52] reason it doesn't even speak of a deluge
[32:55] of water it doesn't speak of sprinkling
[32:56] of water it says the scent of
[32:59] water that the tree has
[33:02] hope and so God's original inspiration
[33:05] is so bound into
[33:07] creation that it causes it to be
[33:10] resilient that even though its root has
[33:12] died and its stock has died as well that
[33:15] it knows that even at the aroma or the
[33:17] scent of water there is hope of
[33:20] life that God in his original creation
[33:23] under this original inspiration it can
[33:25] hope for life despite death despite the
[33:29] worst circumstances there's
[33:31] potential to bring forth for restoration
[33:34] and
[33:36] Redemption and the scent of
[33:39] water they say that perfume is the art
[33:41] of time travel the art of traveling
[33:44] because through the scent it can cause
[33:46] you to uh conjure emotions and feelings
[33:49] and see things and be places it's a very
[33:52] powerful uh
[33:55] sense the sense of sense
[34:00] this B God is answering to Job saying
[34:03] you've observed it in nature who does
[34:05] that God
[34:06] does through the scent of water There's
[34:08] Hope through the working of
[34:10] water There's
[34:13] Hope under God's original inspiration
[34:16] catch it just in creation the tree in
[34:20] the beginning was inspired to bring
[34:22] forth
[34:23] fruit and that original inspiration is
[34:26] so Bound in that tree
[34:28] that job can say you can cut it down its
[34:31] root can die its trunk can die but yet
[34:35] there's something inside of it through
[34:37] the scent of water it has hope that it
[34:39] can be bring forth again it will bud and
[34:42] bring forth a fruitful
[34:46] bow under God's original inspiration
[34:48] there's power in his
[34:50] creation there's power too it's it's
[34:54] inherent in his design the Earth brought
[34:57] forth grass
[34:58] the trees brought forth
[35:01] fruit each one in turn bringing forth
[35:03] herbs and fruits and this innate ability
[35:06] that was inside of
[35:07] them and as I've been studying on this
[35:09] and I realized not it's not necessary
[35:12] maybe to go through entire sermons on
[35:14] this but let me just point to it it's
[35:16] not the process of manufacturing
[35:18] something it's the act of expressing
[35:22] through inspiration am this is the the
[35:25] danger that we often identify through
[35:27] some of the the way that we approach the
[35:28] word is there's always this way where we
[35:30] can uh try to put on erors or the Optics
[35:33] of something but if we are inspired we
[35:36] can bring forth something new and in
[35:38] doing so it's not producing something
[35:40] that's already
[35:42] been that's what inspiration we say
[35:44] something's original inspiration it's
[35:46] not mimicking or copying something
[35:48] else and so it's to bring forth this
[35:51] what what we're to do is not to
[35:53] manufacture something but to bring forth
[35:56] something in order to bring it forth
[35:58] there's got to be something that's
[36:01] uncovered just as creation
[36:04] buds it it buds the nature that was
[36:07] instilled in
[36:08] it we too have to we have to be
[36:13] disciplined are in tune to that
[36:15] inspiration so that we can let it
[36:18] come and this is the part that I I want
[36:22] to emphasize that we're all very
[36:24] familiar with sheep do not manufacture
[36:27] wool
[36:28] am it's not they don't they don't study
[36:31] the
[36:32] process they don't uh examine the pores
[36:35] they don't look they're not researching
[36:38] and trying to figure out all these
[36:39] different ways so that they can make
[36:40] their their wool uh more beautiful they
[36:43] just bear the
[36:45] wool it doesn't manufacture it it Bears
[36:48] it that's a sheep's creative act so as
[36:51] long as it's uh healthy it's bearing
[36:53] wool it's their work of art it's
[36:55] something innate inside of them let
[36:57] every seed bring forth of its kind let
[36:59] it express its characteristics Let It Be
[37:01] identified by its characteristics
[37:02] according to the life that's inside of
[37:04] it and brother Bram using the principle
[37:07] that sheep uh bear wool according to the
[37:09] life that's inside them they don't
[37:10] manufacture it he says and when you're a
[37:13] Christian you'll cope with the word I
[37:15] don't care what anybody else says you
[37:16] don't have to work up nothing and bring
[37:18] nothing down Pull pump up you are a
[37:20] Christian amen says in another place
[37:22] we're not asked to manufacture something
[37:25] we're asked to Bear the fruit of the
[37:26] spirit the inside of the sheep what he
[37:28] is on the inside makes the wool on the
[37:30] outside and when a man's got Christ on
[37:32] the inside it makes him Christlike on
[37:34] the outside not some artificial put on
[37:38] Amen this is the this is the important
[37:41] uh connection now to what God has place
[37:43] in his original creation by inspiration
[37:46] and by inspiration is to express itself
[37:48] we cannot try to manufacture what God
[37:51] has designed us to Bear we cannot try to
[37:55] produce through a process of manufa
[37:57] facturing and industrialize the world
[37:59] and find market inefficiencies and
[38:01] figure out a ways so that we can begin
[38:02] to Bear the image of Christ through a
[38:04] manufactured process that's artificial
[38:07] that's a put on right that's a cheap
[38:09] knockoff and the world may buy
[38:11] it but that's not what God's looking
[38:14] for in 1 Peter chapter
[38:20] 2:9 but you are a chosen generation a
[38:23] royal
[38:24] priesthood a holy nation A peculiar
[38:26] people
[38:28] that ye should show forth the Praises of
[38:31] him who have called you out of Darkness
[38:34] Into His Marvelous
[38:36] Light in darkness you can't be
[38:38] seen now he's put you in light so he can
[38:41] exhibit
[38:43] you you're on
[38:45] display that you should show forth it
[38:47] means to tell out or for to tell forth
[38:49] to declare abroad it means to
[38:52] publish to make known by proclamation
[38:57] now we might think that this has
[38:59] something to do with our
[39:02] words that you should show forth the
[39:04] Praises of him the Praises means The
[39:06] Virtuous course of
[39:08] thought The Virtuous feelings therefore
[39:12] these thoughts that are his thoughts in
[39:14] the ways that are his ways you are to
[39:16] show forth his thoughts in your actions
[39:20] it's moral Excellence is what it refers
[39:22] to this modesty and Purity that you
[39:24] would Proclaim and publish God virtuous
[39:28] thoughts that you are called out of
[39:31] Darkness into light so that you as a
[39:32] chosen generation a royal P priesthood
[39:35] and a holy nation as Kings and Priests
[39:37] your lives would be an exhibit of the
[39:40] thoughts of God that are higher than our
[39:42] thoughts the ways of God that are higher
[39:44] than our ways but yet it has to come
[39:46] into the channel of human beings that
[39:49] our lives would show forth his moral
[39:53] Excellence that we could declare and
[39:55] publish and make known that there could
[39:57] be a Proclamation and expression of
[39:59] God's thoughts and feelings and
[40:04] actions in the sermon Christ identified
[40:07] the same in all
[40:12] generations I think I have this
[40:14] statement
[40:16] there you notice some of you may
[40:18] recognize this work of art it was part
[40:21] of a series I think it was Anne mcferson
[40:23] talbet she did some of the art before
[40:25] she was married then she married and
[40:27] it's very hard to find uh the collection
[40:30] together but she did that I can count
[40:32] six different uh Parts different numbers
[40:34] about Christ her title was Christ
[40:37] revealed in his own words does that ring
[40:39] a
[40:41] bell and and this was a very popular at
[40:44] a time when brother brandham uh was
[40:46] ministering and and he's he points out
[40:49] kind of this imagery here's Christ being
[40:52] reflected in The Sermon on the Mount and
[40:55] it's Christ uh uh uh the Beatitudes
[40:57] Christ and the Beatitudes a numbered
[41:00] part of Christ revealed in his own words
[41:03] and so she used the the method of art to
[41:05] where she's writing out the words of the
[41:07] scripture and highlighting certain
[41:09] portions to where Christ is the image of
[41:12] Christ is seeing and this is modeled
[41:14] after uh Christ at 33 by Hoffman here he
[41:17] is in the picture Christ revealed in his
[41:20] own word and brother randam is using
[41:21] that theme in some of these sermons
[41:23] about Christ uh being identified through
[41:25] his characteristics and here Christ
[41:28] identified the same in all generations
[41:30] he says he's Eternal he's the only
[41:32] source of eternal life there is is in
[41:34] God our Father he's Eternal himself now
[41:37] therefore if we have eternal life we
[41:40] have part of God in us and God in us if
[41:42] he isn't then that's the only way you
[41:44] could have eternal life it isn't
[41:46] something that was
[41:47] manufactured then given to you by some
[41:50] Creed or you lived into it you grew into
[41:54] a better man or a better woman notice
[41:57] the subtlety of the thought that you've
[41:58] got to earn uh certain platitudes or
[42:01] earn your way to certain things God
[42:03] gives you the life the new birth as a
[42:05] testament of your faith he says it's God
[42:08] himself in you just like you are a part
[42:10] of your father here on Earth you're a
[42:12] part of your heavenly father in what you
[42:14] are you're the attribute of his thoughts
[42:16] of you before the foundation of the
[42:18] world you are
[42:19] expressed he had to breed it in and
[42:22] everything to get what you are to make
[42:25] you what you are now that's a mouthful
[42:28] but notice how he says he's had to breed
[42:30] it into you to make you what you are
[42:32] just as you're an expression by a
[42:34] natural Union here on Earth you are an
[42:36] expression of your father's attributes
[42:37] and he says it's not something you
[42:40] manufacture if the life is in you you
[42:42] live the life if you had the life of the
[42:44] artist you'd create art if you had the
[42:46] light knife life of a well if you had
[42:48] the knife of a knife wielder you'd knife
[42:50] people you had the life of a gunslinger
[42:53] you would shoot there's different things
[42:54] that you would do based upon the nature
[42:56] that's inside of you it's not
[42:59] manufactured amen it's something part of
[43:01] the original
[43:03] inspiration where you bring it
[43:06] forth now as I bring this to a close I
[43:09] want to use an example I this just
[43:12] expresses an example of what I'm
[43:18] saying Luke chapter 19: 28-
[43:24] 40 just gather these things into your
[43:26] heart
[43:28] take from it some principle and it might
[43:30] seem to be somewhat abstract but we can
[43:32] take everything we just ministered on
[43:34] this simple principle of God putting
[43:38] something an ability in something a
[43:42] skill that's what art is it speaks of
[43:43] skill there's something in the creation
[43:47] and by inspiration it produces it
[43:50] expresses itself the light shines on it
[43:52] it reflects it shows something there's
[43:55] this principle that something can be so
[43:57] found up in God's original design that
[44:00] certain forces as we see a nature of
[44:02] just water working upon it brings
[44:05] forth and it expresses now with that
[44:08] principle watch it here how it works in
[44:10] in an actual scenario in Luke chapter
[44:12] 19: 28 to 40 and when he had thus spoken
[44:15] he went before ascending up to Jerusalem
[44:18] and it came to pass when he was nigh to
[44:20] Beth Page and Bethany at the mount
[44:22] called the Mount of Olives he sent two
[44:23] of his disciples saying go ye into the
[44:26] village over against you in the which at
[44:28] you entering ye shall find a cult tide
[44:31] where on yet never sat man man sat loose
[44:34] him and bring him hither and if any man
[44:37] ask you why do you loose him thus shall
[44:39] you say unto him because the Lord hath
[44:41] need of him and they went that were sent
[44:44] went their way and they found even as he
[44:46] had said unto them and as they were
[44:48] loosing the Colt the owners thereof said
[44:50] unto them why Loosey the
[44:52] cult he had already told them that
[44:54] they'd be asked that very thing and they
[44:57] said the Lord hath need of him and they
[44:59] brought him to Jesus and they now and
[45:02] they cast their garments upon the colt
[45:04] and they set Jesus thereon now the
[45:07] scenes been set follow and as he went
[45:11] Christ they spread their clothes in the
[45:14] way and when he was come nigh even now
[45:17] at The Descent of the Mount of Olives
[45:19] the whole multitude of the disciples
[45:21] begin to rejoice and praise God with a
[45:24] loud voice for all the mighty works that
[45:26] they had seen saying blessed be the king
[45:30] that cometh in the name of the Lord
[45:31] peace in heaven and glory in the highest
[45:34] now if we could somehow find our minds
[45:36] in this scene that Jesus is nearing
[45:39] Jerusalem and he tells his disciples to
[45:41] go and find a a a cult and that has
[45:44] never been ridden by man and take them
[45:45] and not necessarily steal it but say the
[45:47] master has need of it it unfolds just
[45:50] exactly as he says and now seemingly
[45:52] without any other prompting other than
[45:54] he has set upon this cult and he went
[45:58] they began to spread clothes in the
[46:00] way the Bible is so specific as to tell
[46:03] us where he was and the moment he was in
[46:05] it and where they were going to go and
[46:07] that what the nature of the cult was and
[46:09] what the owner would say when they got
[46:10] there and what they were to say back and
[46:12] now without any prompting or foretelling
[46:14] here they begin to put their garments in
[46:16] the way as he's riding on this
[46:18] CT and now as he comes nigh the whole
[46:22] multitude begins to rejoice and praise
[46:25] God with a loud voice for the works that
[46:28] they had
[46:29] seen saying blessed be the king that
[46:33] cometh in the name of the Lord peace in
[46:36] heaven and glory in the highest notice
[46:39] this unction of Praise that was being
[46:41] expressed and then immediately and some
[46:44] of the Pharisees from among the
[46:45] multitude said unto him Master rebuke
[46:49] thy
[46:50] disciples and he answered and said unto
[46:53] them I tell you that if the these should
[46:58] hold their peace the stones would
[47:02] immediately cry
[47:04] out Ponder that for a
[47:06] second if the disciples and those in the
[47:09] way had not responded as they were he
[47:12] said the stones would have immediately
[47:15] shouted had they not under that
[47:18] inspiration of praising him for what
[47:21] they had seen something had to express
[47:24] it something would have create something
[47:27] would have had to shout loudly and
[47:30] Proclaim and we might say well this is
[47:32] just Jesus and his tendency to embellish
[47:34] and this is just Jesus uh may be trying
[47:36] to use hyperbole to get their attention
[47:38] no had they kept their mouth shut
[47:41] there's something about God's word when
[47:44] it's fulfilled that there must be a
[47:46] sounding there must be an expression
[47:49] there must be something come forth when
[47:51] God fulfills his promised word it's not
[47:54] something though it may be done in
[47:56] secret though may be something done in
[47:58] mystery though God's may be word may be
[48:00] coming to pass in such a way to the
[48:01] world misses it but there must be those
[48:04] who respond with praise there must be
[48:07] those that respond with an expression
[48:09] and a showing forth amen for the Bible
[48:13] said maybe I can say this way in the
[48:16] original
[48:18] inspiration this original inspiration
[48:21] the time had come for its fulfillment so
[48:23] something had to identify
[48:25] it and Zechariah 9:9 Rejoice greatly oh
[48:29] Daughter of Zion shout oh daughter of
[48:33] Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto
[48:37] thee this is what they're responding to
[48:40] he is just and having salvation lowly
[48:43] and riding upon an ass and upon a CT the
[48:45] foul of an ass
[48:48] Rejoice this
[48:51] exaltation a celebration to do it so
[48:54] abundantly exceedingly
[48:57] to shout it's to raise a sound to show
[49:00] forth the Praises of
[49:02] him the Bible told them told the
[49:05] daughters of Zion to Rejoice
[49:07] greatly the Bible said that they were to
[49:09] shout the daughters of Jerusalem were to
[49:11] shout when their King came riding upon a
[49:14] cold this is what they were supposed to
[49:16] do and that's why Jesus said had it not
[49:19] happened had the people not done it the
[49:21] Rocks would have cried out because God's
[49:24] word cannot return void amen
[49:27] the the the land would have cried that
[49:30] it's not just any Rock but the rocks of
[49:33] Jerusalem would have cried
[49:35] out and would have uttered under
[49:38] inspiration of the original creation
[49:40] they would have cried out at the
[49:41] satisfaction of this I love that song
[49:43] Ain't No Stone going to praise in my
[49:45] place right I'm not going to let
[49:47] something else take my place the stones
[49:49] don't need to cry out I can be a Living
[49:51] Testament I can be a living
[49:55] Stone it was the original inspiration
[49:57] that caused those people to declare to
[49:59] shout and to praise it had to come to
[50:02] pass in the sermon hear ye himm brother
[50:04] Bram says my people according the Bible
[50:06] my people shall never be
[50:09] ashamed he said how they're fully Able
[50:11] by the inspiration of God to declare
[50:14] Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God
[50:16] who's just the same yesterday today and
[50:19] forever and if the old time Pentecostal
[50:21] blessing that fell in ad33 is just as
[50:24] good today and inspires men just the
[50:26] same today as it did then it and it
[50:28] brings the same results regardless of
[50:31] critics and what people have to say
[50:34] it'll do that because inspiration will
[50:36] always bring
[50:38] it if the word is put in Inspiration
[50:40] then the results have to
[50:45] come when the word is put in
[50:48] inspiration brother bam talks about
[50:50] getting in the inspiration of it in this
[50:51] hour in this time in this season
[50:54] Brothers come to your instruments and
[50:56] the the sermon why little Bethlehem at
[50:58] the end of 63 says forgive me if I hurt
[51:00] you I'm doing this in the name of the
[51:02] Lord Jesus come back stand you Gallant
[51:05] man who see David standing Yonder Jesus
[51:08] Christ a fugitive from his church barred
[51:11] out by their
[51:12] Creeds there's a fresh Fountain hanging
[51:16] Yonder there is power to make this word
[51:19] live
[51:20] again it's prophesied in this day to
[51:23] come to pass God said it would come to
[51:25] pass it's got to come to pass amen it
[51:28] has to yes I you say well I don't know
[51:32] brother Aaron it's looking awfully dark
[51:34] if the stones have to do it the stones
[51:37] have to cry out somebody's going to do
[51:40] it has to happen you'll never do it in
[51:42] an army you're in Now You Garen yourself
[51:45] Pentecost right around with the rest of
[51:47] the organizations cutting into a Creed
[51:49] you can see he's showing what is
[51:51] stifling the
[51:53] inspiration what is causing them to be
[51:55] cheap knockoffs to just mimic and play
[51:57] the part but he said there's power to
[51:59] make this word live
[52:01] again it will come to pass if the word
[52:05] is put in Inspiration the results have
[52:08] to
[52:09] come I was reading in a book on on art
[52:13] that said said it this way thought it
[52:15] was very interesting I was going to use
[52:16] it earlier and I just I actually just
[52:18] completely left it out and then I just
[52:20] made a copy of this right before I left
[52:24] and was making they they quoted from
[52:28] Ecclesiastes and it just says that these
[52:31] there are certain to every season
[52:32] there's a time and it's this principle
[52:35] that maybe Sunday we'll pick up on it
[52:37] that we don't set the Rhythm go you know
[52:41] study what brother BR said about the
[52:42] symphony and the Rhythm and the
[52:43] conductor of the beat uh we don't set
[52:46] that but but we're all we're all in the
[52:49] process and really foreshadowing some
[52:52] things POS possibly we're all in the
[52:53] process of being conducted amen and he
[52:57] says if you have an idea you're excited
[52:59] about and you don't bring it to life
[53:01] he's just talking about the natural
[53:02] world this is not in any way related to
[53:05] God but it's just natural art by human
[53:08] through human expression he said if you
[53:09] have an idea that you're excited about
[53:11] and you don't bring it to life it's not
[53:13] uncommon for the idea to find its Voice
[53:16] through another maker and that's what
[53:18] happened to all of us with the
[53:21] iPhone if you have an idea that you're
[53:23] excited by it's not it's common that if
[53:27] you don't bring it to life someone
[53:29] does he said this isn't because the
[53:32] other artist stole your idea but because
[53:34] the ideas time has
[53:36] come this great unfolding ideas and
[53:39] thoughts themes and songs and other
[53:40] works of art exist in The Ether in rip
[53:42] and on schedule ready to find expression
[53:45] in the physical world he has translated
[53:48] according to Ecclesiastes 3 something is
[53:50] part of God's divine plan in watching it
[53:52] happen according to man's natural
[53:53] progress in life and according to the
[53:55] rhythm of creation in natural life that
[53:57] there's times where there's this great
[53:59] unfolding of
[54:00] ideas because they were there it said
[54:02] kind of in The Ether and they ripen on
[54:06] schedule that that that they come to
[54:08] life in a time that it was ready they
[54:11] time to find their expression in the
[54:12] physical world and just as it would in
[54:15] the natural world as people look at
[54:17] things and oh here's an idea that it
[54:19] comes into being God's inspiration must
[54:22] find a voice amen it must be published
[54:25] amen when the time has come nothing can
[54:28] stop it from coming
[54:31] forth they call the great unfolding of
[54:33] ideas and thoughts but it's the great
[54:34] unfolding of God's purpose yes ready to
[54:38] find expression in the physical
[54:41] world the time has come you can take
[54:45] that just that way of phrasing and say
[54:47] well that's what brother bradam is
[54:48] trying to get us to see the time has
[54:51] come
[54:56] and it's according to the original
[55:00] inspiration his or what he originally
[55:02] intended by the word is how it's going
[55:05] to come forth could you stand with me
[55:07] and pray just pray a prayer with us
[55:10] tonight as we dismiss
[55:12] you keep these things close to your
[55:16] heart I tried to make it as simple as I
[55:19] possibly could and I realize that you
[55:21] may be looking at it saying well that's
[55:24] really really really really really
[55:25] simple brother erid but it has endless
[55:29] application to the things of
[55:32] God to you who are his sons and
[55:37] daughters there is something inside of
[55:39] you that must Express
[55:41] itself and all your
[55:44] Melancholy and all your waywardness is
[55:47] going to come back to the fact that
[55:48] that's not
[55:50] happening that's not being expressed
[55:52] it's got to come forth
[55:56] let's bow our heads in
[55:57] [Music]
[56:04] prayer our gracious Heavenly
[56:07] Father Lord tonight as we are in your
[56:10] presence we're
[56:13] needy we're needy for it
[56:15] Lord we need your
[56:18] presence Lord we sing songs of it
[56:20] pouring down like
[56:22] rain and truly as we see in the word of
[56:25] God that as the rain rain would come
[56:27] forth and water the Earth and snow that
[56:31] would melt would find its way into to
[56:33] cross the ground and water would find
[56:36] its path across the
[56:38] Earth it would water a seed that's been
[56:41] sewn by a
[56:43] sewer cause it to grow to a place of
[56:45] harvest then in being
[56:48] harvested it would go through a process
[56:50] to where it becomes
[56:53] bread and in that image from seed
[56:57] to
[56:58] loaf you said your words the same
[57:01] way that you've spoken it and it will
[57:03] not return
[57:05] void so much so that in natural life
[57:08] there's a power bound up inside of it
[57:10] that if it can come in contact with the
[57:12] scent of water there's the hope of being
[57:17] revived if we want it to die if we want
[57:19] it to no longer be able to have life we
[57:21] would chop it up we would cause it to
[57:23] dry we put it in a Kil we'd burn it we'd
[57:25] cause it use it for a heat Source uh to
[57:27] Forever Vanquish its ability but that
[57:29] tree though
[57:31] dead and its root and its stomp Wayne
[57:36] and dried
[57:37] up said at the scent of water There's
[57:41] Hope and you reminded job that that's
[57:43] that's not man that does that it's you
[57:45] that can do
[57:46] that Lord I believe that in this hour we
[57:49] have more than just the scent of water
[57:53] but we have a rain that is falling
[57:56] former and latter we have a power that's
[57:58] given to the church and Lord let us rise
[58:01] up on that
[58:03] power may we use it Lord I know that I
[58:06] keep preaching things in general and
[58:08] maybe in the abstract and there's things
[58:09] that are very very concrete that relate
[58:11] to this but and Lord maybe I want to
[58:14] move further into different things and
[58:16] it just keeps getting repeated and Lord
[58:18] if it's my own my own life that's
[58:22] impeding father I want to get out of the
[58:24] way
[58:27] to let your voice be
[58:29] heard I don't want a stone singing in my
[58:33] place and to think that under the
[58:35] original inspiration there's something
[58:36] to how you originally meant it something
[58:39] bound up in the prophecy that when the
[58:41] word comes an inspiration it will bring
[58:44] forth exactly as you said it
[58:47] would the Rocks were quiet on that day
[58:50] because there was a people that were
[58:53] inspired when their King came
[58:56] we too in this hour have seen you
[58:59] revealed in your word Christ identified
[59:01] in his characteristics Christ revealed
[59:03] in his own word may we show forth your
[59:06] moral Excellence may we show forth your
[59:09] virtue not in a portrait of days gone by
[59:12] but today 2025 a life that can hide the
[59:16] Simplicity of Christ for others to see
[59:20] we commit ourselves to you tonight we
