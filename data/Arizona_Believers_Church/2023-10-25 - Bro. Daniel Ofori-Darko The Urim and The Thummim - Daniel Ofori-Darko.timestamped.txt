[0:00] and uh beloved out of this scripture we
[0:03] just want to talk on theim and tomim
[0:08] tonight the and the Tom
[0:12] him now we know that God did not just
[0:15] set the
[0:17] priesthood but he also designed
[0:20] everything that goes with
[0:23] it as he gave Moses the
[0:27] pattern as to how the Tabernacle look
[0:32] like even the division the partition or
[0:36] the various courts we know that all came
[0:40] from Heaven because the Lord said as you
[0:44] have been shown do it and so the
[0:48] priesthood in itself was also a designed
[0:53] thing that God gave to the prophet
[0:56] Moses you know the priests have their
[0:59] own way of
[1:02] dressing and when the high
[1:04] priest is
[1:07] robed there is something that they put
[1:10] on their
[1:12] chest which is called the Yum and the
[1:16] Tom Hallelujah and this Tom him it was
[1:21] of beauty and
[1:25] Glory you
[1:27] know it was not just anything at all
[1:31] that God made Moses to use but he used
[1:35] precious
[1:37] stones it was just like an
[1:39] April and it have 12 Stones in
[1:43] it and uh these 12
[1:46] Stones each of them represent a tribe in
[1:51] Israel Hallelujah so it depicts the
[1:54] beauty and glory of the entire nation
[1:57] called
[1:58] Israel
[2:00] so he used the colorless and Precious
[2:03] Minerals let us go quickly to Exodus
[2:05] chapter
[2:13] 28 Exodus
[2:15] 28 we will read from verse
[2:23] 15 he said and thou shall make the
[2:26] breastplate of judgment with Cannon work
[2:30] after the work of the
[2:32] OT thou shall make it of
[2:36] gold of blue and of purple and a scarlet
[2:41] and of fine twine linen shall thou make
[2:45] it four square it shall
[2:48] be being doubled a span shall be the
[2:52] length thereof and a span shall be the
[2:56] breath
[2:58] thereof and thou shall set in it
[3:01] settings of
[3:03] stones even four rows of stones the
[3:07] first rle shall be a
[3:09] sadus a topas and a cabun they shall be
[3:13] the first
[3:15] rle and the second row shall be an
[3:17] emerald a surfire and a
[3:21] diamond and the third row a ligor an
[3:25] agate and an
[3:28] amethyst
[3:30] Hallelujah and the fourth row a
[3:33] Buel and an onx and a Jasper they shall
[3:37] be set in gold in their
[3:41] enclosing and the stone shall be with
[3:44] the names of the children of Israel 12
[3:47] according to their names like the
[3:50] Engravings of a Signet everyone with his
[3:53] name shall they be according to the 12
[3:56] tribes Hallelujah you know so this Ur
[4:00] man atomium was
[4:04] designed to contain the
[4:07] representation of the 12 tribes of
[4:10] Israel and as we were told he said it is
[4:14] for beauty and for
[4:17] Glory but the main purpose of the H and
[4:20] the Tom the prophet said that it was
[4:24] judgment it Bears judgment Hallelujah
[4:27] for the people of Israel to guide
[4:31] against
[4:33] falsehood that was the main purpose of
[4:35] this and the Tom and you know that the
[4:38] the high priest don't go into the
[4:40] presence of God without it because as a
[4:43] high priest whatever you are going into
[4:45] the presence of God there must be
[4:48] sincerity in you yes sir there must be
[4:50] truth in you anything or any anything
[4:53] that is in you must be righteous right
[4:56] you know the reason why they put rope
[5:00] okay if you are careful they put robe
[5:02] before their waist they tied it and it
[5:05] stretched out from the from the temple
[5:08] right the reason is that perhaps if this
[5:11] high priest goes before the
[5:14] Lord
[5:17] unrighteously and the Lord give him a
[5:19] blow yeah and he died nobody dare go to
[5:23] the presence of
[5:25] God so you know they will use that rope
[5:27] to pull him to pull the the cops and go
[5:30] and drump him somewhere so so we realize
[5:34] that when we are going into the presence
[5:35] of God we must be full of
[5:38] righteousness but remember the Bible
[5:41] says that you and I our righteousness
[5:44] are as filthy as
[5:46] rocks there is nothing good in us
[5:49] hallelujah that is why God gave us Jesus
[5:53] Christ to represent
[5:55] us hallelujah so we see the
[5:58] righteousness of God in Jesus Christ as
[6:01] our
[6:02] righteousness that is the reason why the
[6:05] high priest was allowed to put this Y
[6:09] and theim on his chest to guide against
[6:12] falce because people will get up and
[6:15] they say I have a
[6:17] dream people will get up and they say I
[6:20] have that say of the Lord people will
[6:23] get up and say that the Lord told me
[6:25] this the Lord told me that and when they
[6:28] tell you and you put it by the word of
[6:31] God you realize that it
[6:33] falsehood and everybody want to be
[6:35] believed everybody want to bring out
[6:38] something new when they sleep and they
[6:41] dream they want to come to put it upon
[6:43] the people to confuse them to deceive
[6:46] them and God didn't want that to go on
[6:50] so God said that Moses build the and Tom
[6:54] and put it on the chest of the of the
[6:57] priest right wherever you hang it it if
[7:00] anybody get up and say well I have that
[7:01] here the Lord let the person go and
[7:03] stand before the hear him and
[7:05] him and let him Proclaim let him say
[7:08] whatever he said the L he claimed that
[7:10] the Lord have told him if those tones
[7:14] don't come in agreement to
[7:17] flash take that person to be
[7:20] false if anybody have a dream and claim
[7:24] that I God have given him a dream or a
[7:26] dream let him go and stand by the and in
[7:30] front of the and him let him say his
[7:32] dream if those stones don't come in
[7:34] agreement in flash it means it is false
[7:38] so that was the main work of the uim and
[7:42] the tomim Hallelujah today we thank God
[7:47] that we also have the Y and the Tom
[7:50] yes as much as the people in the days of
[7:54] Moses will not go scut free for
[7:58] falsehood right
[8:00] today if anybody want to go with
[8:02] falsehood that person also will not go
[8:05] scull free because you'll be
[8:08] exposed Hallelujah you will be exposed
[8:11] by the and the Tom that we have in this
[8:14] end time Hallelujah in our day in our
[8:18] day like
[8:21] this the and the Tom is the revealed
[8:24] world that you are
[8:26] believing that is a that is where the
[8:29] light of God is
[8:31] shining anything that comes to you
[8:35] anything that you hear even as I preach
[8:38] to you right now you have the her and
[8:40] the Tom to determine whether it is true
[8:44] or
[8:45] false Hallelujah you have the right to
[8:48] determine because you have the Heim and
[8:51] the Tom him today which is the revealed
[8:53] word the message of this hour full of
[8:56] light that Glitter it shines amen any
[9:00] place we are we shine because wherever
[9:04] you see when you are walking in light
[9:06] yes you see
[9:08] clearly okay when you are walking in
[9:11] light you can see anything clear but
[9:13] when you are walking in darkness it is
[9:15] very difficult to see or to determine
[9:18] whether you are going to hit an object
[9:21] because you are in darkness right but
[9:23] when you are walking in light there may
[9:25] be obstacles in your way but because you
[9:28] are in the light you see those obstacles
[9:31] and you go around it is that clear
[9:35] Hallelujah so that is what this message
[9:38] of the hour God have given to you and I
[9:41] that is the work he's doing for us it
[9:44] has brought light to us amen and today
[9:46] by God's grace we are walking in the
[9:48] light amen I remember in those days when
[9:50] we were in the
[9:52] denominations you know the the
[9:54] denomination they have good names but
[9:56] they don't have the light of God right
[9:59] were walking the way we wanted any
[10:01] everybody was doing whatever he wanted
[10:04] like last Sunday I was telling the
[10:06] church I said look when we were in the
[10:09] denominations we had our
[10:12] names on the books of the churches but
[10:16] we couldn't have Jesus Christ name in
[10:18] our
[10:19] heart Hallelujah but when the grace of
[10:23] God fell upon us and he met us with the
[10:26] message of this hour and we believe the
[10:29] word of God from that time we see the
[10:32] name of Jesus Christ in our hearts and
[10:35] we have our names also in him amen
[10:37] because he said if you believe in me you
[10:39] will know that day you will know that I
[10:42] am in you and you in me Hallelujah
[10:45] because I am in the father so we become
[10:48] one with Jesus Christ am and that is
[10:50] what the power of God has done for you
[10:53] and I am Hallelujah so this uim and the
[10:58] Tom guide against
[11:01] falsehood that is the truth anything
[11:04] that comes up on it and the light begin
[11:08] to flash it means it is the truth
[11:12] amen the uim and the Tom is here you and
[11:17] I also we are shining today Hallelujah
[11:21] as it was on the chest of the high
[11:24] priest today it is the word of God that
[11:28] is on our hearts amen hallelujah like
[11:32] the prophet Paul
[11:34] said amen he said we should put on us
[11:38] the Blessed bre of
[11:41] righteousness on our chest perhaps we
[11:44] can read it from the Bible right now
[11:46] Ephesians chapter
[11:50] 6
[11:55] amen
[11:57] let's Ephesians chapter
[12:01] 6 you can read the whole chapter if you
[12:03] so wish but let me just um pick it
[12:10] from okay verse
[12:13] 11 okay verse 10 okay that would be good
[12:16] he said finally my
[12:17] brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[12:20] the power of His might put on the whole
[12:24] armor of God that ye may be able to
[12:26] stand against the Ws of the
[12:30] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[12:33] and blood but against principalities
[12:36] against Powers against the rulers of the
[12:39] darkness of this world against spiritual
[12:42] wickedness in high
[12:44] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[12:48] armor of God that ye may be able to
[12:51] stand yeah may be able to with stand in
[12:53] the evil day and having done all to
[12:57] stand stand therefore having your loes
[13:00] get about with truth amen and having on
[13:04] the Blessed PR of
[13:07] righteousness Hallelujah that is where
[13:08] the Y and tumim you know placed and your
[13:12] feet short with the preparation of the
[13:14] gospel of peace above all taking the
[13:18] shield of Faith where withth ye shall be
[13:21] able to quench all the fairy DS of the
[13:24] wicked and take the helmet of salvation
[13:28] and the sword of spirit which is the
[13:32] word of God hallelujah you see so when
[13:36] we as Believers
[13:38] today no matter our condition no matter
[13:40] our situations when we are able to put
[13:43] this in us oh brother we become a mighty
[13:46] Soldier we become Mighty Army that are
[13:50] ready to go to battle with Victory amen
[13:53] hallelujah because no Army no Army will
[13:57] prepare for war and think of going to
[14:00] lose every strategy that they take is to
[14:03] go and win the battle but how will you
[14:06] win the battle when you didn't
[14:07] strategically
[14:09] prepare Hallelujah and God in his wisdom
[14:13] have given a strategy to overcome the
[14:16] very doubt of the enemy and this is the
[14:19] secret of our weapon Hallelujah to guide
[14:23] us okay from falsehood and unrighteous
[14:27] unrighteousness yes
[14:30] amen now let's listen to what the
[14:32] prophet said
[14:33] here I'm quoting from the message
[14:36] demonology demonology okay he said
[14:40] notice then there was three ways that
[14:44] they had of finding out things from God
[14:48] the first was the prophet the second was
[14:51] a dream and the third was the uum
[14:54] andum and they neither will answer now
[14:58] you know what a prophet is and you know
[15:01] what a spiritual dream is and you know
[15:04] what the T was you know that the other
[15:08] day I asked a man what about the Y and
[15:10] Tom him he couldn't tell me what it was
[15:14] yeah because he had no idea of that
[15:16] Hallelujah in the in the same vein we
[15:19] didn't know anything about
[15:20] the till we came to the message of this
[15:23] hour
[15:25] Hallelujah he said see and the devil
[15:28] makes a counterfeit of every one of
[15:30] these right right that's true the wizard
[15:34] the false prophet and the Crystal gazes
[15:38] the and a hang around breast here aon's
[15:42] breast here and the Y and a cover over
[15:45] the stones and they hung it in the
[15:48] temple and when they wasn't sure they go
[15:52] before God in answer and a light will
[15:56] flash on that urum and the Tom
[15:59] whether it was God's will or
[16:02] not Hallelujah he said now when wouldn't
[16:07] answer now that was the direct answer
[16:09] from God if it doesn't answer meaning
[16:14] what the person is claiming is
[16:16] false Hallelujah today everything that
[16:20] we do when we bring it into the message
[16:23] of this hour we ask ourselves a
[16:26] question is it the
[16:29] message is this the message hallelu
[16:32] today we have so many people with so
[16:34] many
[16:35] ideas we have so many people want to
[16:38] make themselves
[16:39] prophets we have so many people want to
[16:41] make themselves teachers we have so many
[16:43] people want to make themselves Believers
[16:46] of the message but then what they claim
[16:49] when we bring it before us in the face
[16:51] of the message of this hour which is the
[16:54] and the Tom him do we see God yes right
[16:59] do we see Jesus
[17:01] Christ do we see the
[17:03] bride Hallelujah anything anybody claim
[17:07] we must have these
[17:09] characters we must see whether it's the
[17:13] message Hallelujah because
[17:15] look Jesus said something and I always
[17:18] LED he said it is
[17:21] impossible for the
[17:23] elect like you and I to be
[17:27] deceived Hallelujah right deception is a
[17:30] spirit right and Truth is a spirit
[17:35] Hallelujah but at any given time one
[17:38] conquers the other but thank God today
[17:40] we have the spirit of Truth to conquer
[17:43] the spirit of Li am
[17:46] hallelujah amen now let's go on a little
[17:51] okay it
[17:53] says he said God's
[17:56] power no he said and that you
[17:58] and tumim was only the crystal ball that
[18:01] the devil uses
[18:03] today because of the falsehood and the
[18:05] false prophet back here today the one
[18:08] that we have now was the witch or the
[18:11] fortune teller out yonder took the place
[18:15] of the prophet and on the devil's side
[18:18] you see what I mean yeah that's American
[18:21] English you see what I
[18:24] mean Hallelujah that that was your
[18:27] prophet he said you see what I
[18:30] mean yes sir Prophet we saw what you
[18:32] mean and when a prophet had given
[18:36] prophecy and they spoke and wanted to
[18:39] see if that prophecy was true they put
[18:42] it before theum and the tomim and if the
[18:46] voice of God throw that light on the H
[18:49] and Tom him then it was absolute it was
[18:52] the
[18:53] truth and if a man gives an
[18:57] interpretation gives a dream gives
[18:59] something of the Bible and something
[19:02] another and it don't compare with God's
[19:05] Bible it is
[19:07] false Hallelujah you know so that is why
[19:11] before we came to believe the message
[19:14] God have already placed this Y and the
[19:16] tomim on our heart
[19:18] already other than that brother there is
[19:20] no way sister there's no way you could
[19:23] believe the message that is the reason
[19:25] but the problem was that there was still
[19:29] something that need to flash on that
[19:32] thing if the truth you see let me let me
[19:36] give you the scenario or the picture
[19:38] when they hang the and Tom okay in the
[19:42] temple like this unless you speak on it
[19:46] right right if it's hanging it will hung
[19:49] either right but when you speak on it
[19:52] and it is truth it
[19:55] flashes so all along brother sister let
[19:58] me shock you right now all along as a
[20:00] child of God God have placed that Y and
[20:03] at tomim on your heart already he said I
[20:06] knew you before the foundation of the
[20:08] world you know it's not now that God is
[20:11] Planning how to save his people right no
[20:14] you have been saved long time ago amen
[20:18] that day when you got up and he
[20:20] said let there be light you were already
[20:25] in him doing that Proclamation yes amen
[20:28] hallelujah and how God will save you he
[20:31] had already planed it is not today that
[20:34] he is thinking about how I'm going to
[20:36] save Elliot which way how how how will I
[20:41] do it where will I pass and how can I
[20:44] get iiot to become and God bless you my
[20:48] brother hallelujah how am I going to get
[20:50] iiot no God have finished that business
[20:53] long time ago amen can somebody say Amen
[20:56] Here Am
[21:00] the day that God created the
[21:02] Earth he made our
[21:06] ways and brother sister I don't know the
[21:10] junction that God met you yeah and you
[21:13] don't know the junction that God met
[21:16] me when God set the Earth and put up the
[21:21] foundations and put all the instruments
[21:24] together right to make this place a
[21:26] living place for you and I
[21:29] he stood on a junction am waiting for
[21:32] everyone of us to come to that Junction
[21:35] in fact he didn't move wow Hallelujah
[21:40] you see that is why I agreed squarely
[21:43] with Isaiah when you call God the
[21:47] wonderful our God is so
[21:50] wonderful you you cannot determine how
[21:52] he made it but he did it anyhow he stood
[21:56] on that Junction he said I'm not moving
[21:58] an inch come on right I am waiting amen
[22:02] I am waiting till brother Aon will come
[22:05] I am waiting till brother brother nck
[22:07] will come I am waiting till brother
[22:09] Daniel will come I am waiting till
[22:11] brother Elliot will come I am waiting
[22:13] till all of us will come to that
[22:15] Junction at the same
[22:19] time so he said his only presence amen
[22:24] that's the meaning he is everywhere amen
[22:28] any time
[22:30] am the same time he's dealing with you
[22:33] he's dealing the same time with somebody
[22:35] else that's right so this J and the Tom
[22:39] has always been with us before even we
[22:42] were born into this
[22:44] Earth but it was hanging
[22:48] idle it was hanging idle at it was
[22:51] hanging idle in the temple in those days
[22:54] till somebody will speak on it amen so
[22:58] that day when it started glittering was
[23:02] the day that your soul and your spirit
[23:06] agreed and the word of God was spoken on
[23:09] it and then it reflected and you found
[23:12] out that no this is the truth that I've
[23:15] been longing for amen and therefore you
[23:18] have to leave everything that you think
[23:20] was right and come to face God Amen on
[23:24] his word amen hallelujah are
[23:28] understanding am amen and amen he says
[23:32] and if the voice of God throw the light
[23:34] on the he and the Tom him then it was
[23:37] absolute the truth and if a man gives an
[23:42] interpretation gives a dream give
[23:44] something of the Bible and or something
[23:47] another and it don't compare with God's
[23:50] Bible it is
[23:53] false there is the Yim and the tomim
[23:57] today
[23:58] God's word speaks and that is direct the
[24:02] voice of God like the and the Tom was
[24:05] before the Bible was written amen amen
[24:08] you see the point he said like the and
[24:11] atom was before the Bible was written
[24:13] right so it has always been with manen
[24:17] right hallelujah amen you see that is
[24:20] the reason why sometimes when I check
[24:23] the ministry of the prophet and uh
[24:26] certain things that he said in those
[24:28] days but today we can see that almost
[24:31] all are been
[24:32] fulfilled then you ask yourself how can
[24:35] somebody called this man a false
[24:38] prophet how can is it possible a man
[24:42] that got up one day and he said I've saw
[24:45] seven seven visions that is going to
[24:47] happen before the coming of the
[24:50] Lord hallelujah the end of
[24:53] mellan the end of Adolf
[24:55] Hitler communism rism and narcism
[24:59] swallowing up
[25:02] hallelujah amen the moral decay of the
[25:05] women and and you know all these things
[25:09] when we stood before the and the Tom him
[25:12] has it flash or not it
[25:15] has it has Hallelujah you know so
[25:20] this guide El also in the truth it does
[25:24] not make you go
[25:26] Wayward it it br you back always to the
[25:28] presence of God
[25:31] hallelujah
[25:33] amen he says I feel kind of religious
[25:36] right now and same am I feeling right
[25:39] now I'm happy that I am no longer in
[25:42] error Hallelujah if somebody come right
[25:45] now and tell me Daniel you you people
[25:48] believe that women should not be
[25:49] preachers I say yes

[25:55] scriptures I said go to First
[25:57] Corinthians
[25:58] Hallelujah Paul will tell
[26:01] you
[26:02] amen Paul will tell you and because the
[26:06] Bible itself and him I believe God's
[26:09] word instead of human
[26:12] idea he said can you prove it I say yes
[26:14] I can prove
[26:15] it I can prove it for you because he
[26:18] told
[26:20] Timothy if a man desire the office of a
[26:24] bishop he desire a good thing is not it
[26:28] he said a
[26:29] man not a woman a man there is
[26:32] description there a man let us use the
[26:36] and the Tom him Hallelujah he said he
[26:39] must be a
[26:41] husband amen of one wife amen right
[26:46] that's the position of a
[26:47] bishop that's the only qualification
[26:49] brother sister it it must be a husband
[26:53] not a
[26:56] wife so where where would where will we
[26:58] put the and the Tom here on it must be a
[27:03] husband of one
[27:05] wife not a wife of one
[27:09] husband Hallelujah so you bring that
[27:11] thing before the him and see whether you
[27:13] are in line with
[27:15] God if somebody come and tell you that
[27:17] it doesn't matter brother sister let us
[27:19] baptize the people the way they
[27:22] want we cannot go and dump the people in
[27:25] the mighty Waters right let us have just
[27:28] a a bottle of water here and then we
[27:30] baptize them on your forehead in the
[27:31] name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and
[27:33] that is it no no no no no no no no no
[27:35] Hallelujah the and the Tom will not
[27:40] flash Hallelujah the and the Tom will
[27:43] not flash we want attitude we want
[27:47] characters we want behaviors that will
[27:50] make the and the Tom to
[27:52] flash that is what we
[27:55] want Hallelujah and and people will come
[27:58] down and and they'll begin to challenge
[28:00] you when you go on evangelism sometimes
[28:02] they'll ask you questions he say brother
[28:04] what you people are making the people so
[28:07] much worried why why do you disturb them
[28:09] on which point are we disturbing the
[28:13] people showing them the right way of
[28:15] baptism come on showing them the right
[28:18] way to come to the Lord Jesus Christ he
[28:20] said yes you disturb the people so much
[28:23] you take them to the Sea you go and
[28:24] baptize them in all that say brother the
[28:26] Bible say that it must be by immersion
[28:31] amen immersion immersion said you must
[28:34] be
[28:36] drenched we shall we must put you in the
[28:38] water and bring you
[28:40] up he say yeah there's one thing also
[28:43] that you you you people confuse us why
[28:46] why do you say that it shouldn't be in
[28:48] the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[28:50] and it must be in the name of the Lord
[28:51] Jesus right but the Lord Jesus said that
[28:54] it must be for Father Son and Holy Ghost
[28:55] I said brother wait a minute
[28:58] wait a
[28:59] minute
[29:01] Hallelujah Jesus Christ told the
[29:04] disciples go into the world preach the
[29:08] gospel please check the time for me
[29:09] please
[29:11] okay go to the world preach the gospel
[29:14] when they believe baptize them in the
[29:17] name of the father Son and Holy
[29:20] Ghost yes that's what Jesus said but
[29:23] Jesus knew what he was talking
[29:25] about Jesus knew knew that the people
[29:28] that he was giving them that
[29:30] instructions they had the and the
[29:33] Tom so they are not just going to carry
[29:35] instructions but they going to check it
[29:37] with the and the Tom and so he told them
[29:40] that wait until you end do with power
[29:42] yes from
[29:44] above and they waited Hallelujah they
[29:48] waited I said they waited like how today
[29:50] you and I we are also waiting amen we
[29:53] are waiting for the coming of the Lord
[29:55] Jesus Christ Peter and the rest were
[29:57] also waiting at the upper room right
[30:00] waiting to for the coming of the power
[30:02] that Jesus promised he said wait till do
[30:05] with power and that day when the power
[30:08] came
[30:09] down and and filled them and they
[30:13] started you know doing something
[30:15] unusual and it attracted the unbelievers
[30:19] around hallelujah oh brother you see
[30:23] sometimes these Pentecostals they need
[30:26] to Humble themselves
[30:28] so that they can be taught
[30:30] yes you see the Pentecostal have taken
[30:33] the whole experience to another way
[30:36] right true come on Hallelujah that's
[30:39] right until today even they claim that
[30:43] if you don't speak in tongues you don't
[30:45] have the Holy Ghost right true no if we
[30:49] bring that before the UN and Tom him it
[30:52] will not
[30:53] flash
[30:55] Hallelujah and and even the speaking in
[30:57] tongues today as they claim brother you
[30:59] and I will know what it is it is
[31:01] something that is no
[31:03] language but they speaking in Tong is a
[31:07] language are you catching it it's a
[31:09] language but the difference is that you
[31:12] speak a language that you don't know
[31:14] right that is why the Bible call it
[31:16] unknown tongue right I am speaking
[31:20] English it's not unknown tongue to
[31:24] me are you understanding what I mean yes
[31:27] right yes sir you speak English American
[31:29] English of course it's no tongue to you
[31:33] because you know
[31:35] it but as I stand here right
[31:39] now on one among you right now get
[31:43] up brother begin to speak
[31:50] Chinese so what is going
[31:53] on it will attract
[31:55] you espe under
[31:59] inspiration it will attract you say what
[32:01] is going on and then a Chinese will come
[32:04] in say what is this man a Chinese they
[32:07] said no he's an
[32:09] American when did he learn how to speak
[32:11] China or Chinese that was the experience
[32:15] that the people got when the Holy Ghost
[32:18] fell
[32:19] down the bible say that the people from
[32:21] all around the coast they had the
[32:24] apostles speak their tongue where they
[32:27] came
[32:28] from so what is the difference today
[32:30] that the Holy Ghost cannot do it again
[32:33] and this people are making us believe
[32:34] something
[32:36] else so when they were attracted they
[32:39] came around the
[32:41] apostles and the Jews were making fun of
[32:44] them they said don't mind these people
[32:47] perhap they have drank some new wine
[32:50] that is why they are behaving that way
[32:52] then the Holy Ghost pull the Apostle
[32:56] Peter
[32:57] and came and stood
[32:59] there and to the men and
[33:01] Brethren let me tell you the thought
[33:05] that has come into your mind yeah bring
[33:07] it to the and the Tom and see whether it
[33:11] will
[33:12] flash these people are not drunk as you
[33:14] are
[33:15] supposing but this was the prophecy of
[33:18] the Prophet
[33:19] Joel that it has been fulfilled that in
[33:21] the latter days I'll pour my spirit upon
[33:23] All
[33:24] Flesh Hallelujah and Peter oh brother I
[33:28] said Peter mounted the poopy that day in
[33:30] the morning and he started preaching the
[33:32] word he preached the word he preached
[33:34] the word and the people down there were
[33:38] having the Yum and the Tom already on
[33:40] your heart that's right so now after the
[33:43] Simon that Peter presented they asked
[33:46] men and Brethren what shall we do to be
[33:51] saved he
[33:53] said if you
[33:55] repent and you are
[33:58] baptized in the name of the father Son
[34:01] and Holy Ghost was that what Peter told
[34:04] them certainly not but remember the
[34:08] instruction that came for Jesus he said
[34:10] baptize them in the name of Father Son
[34:11] and Holy
[34:13] Ghost but when the power came down am as
[34:18] the hear and the Tom
[34:19] him Peter told the people that be
[34:23] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:25] Christ the remission of your sins
[34:28] because the Holy Ghost came down to
[34:32] agree with the and the Tom him and by
[34:35] the Revelation that Peter got he found
[34:38] out that father was not a
[34:41] name son was not a name and the Holy
[34:44] Spirit was not a name but Jesus said
[34:47] baptize them in the name not even in the
[34:51] names in the name of the
[34:55] father in the name of the
[34:59] son and in the name of the Holy Ghost so
[35:03] Peter Peter stood before the H and the
[35:05] Tom and he got to know that the name of
[35:09] the father is Jesus
[35:12] Christ the name of the son is Jesus
[35:15] Christ and the name of the holy spirit
[35:18] is Jesus Christ so that is the name that
[35:20] you need to be baptized
[35:22] in and there people were filled with joy
[35:26] because it was
[35:29] glittering that day 3,000
[35:32] Souls gave their life to Jesus Christ
[35:35] and they were baptized and that was the
[35:38] establishment of the church in that day
[35:41] brother my sister today what are we
[35:45] seeing there have been a lot of
[35:47] falsehood all over the place right but I
[35:50] thank God for your life yes any place
[35:53] that I go and I see Believers like this
[35:56] I am so happy because God have given us
[36:00] something to guide us from falsehood of

[36:06] placed us on his way if you read first
[36:12] Timothy
[36:15] quickly we are closing soon
[36:20] okay if you read first
[36:24] Timothy and chapter 4

[36:34] expressly that in the latter times some
[36:37] shall depart from the faith don't forget
[36:41] that giv he to seducing spirits and
[36:44] doctrines of devils speaking lies in
[36:48] hypocrisy having their conscience seed

[36:56] commanding to abstain from Meats which

[40:48] sound Doctrine you see a time will come
[40:51] and this is the time that we are living
[40:53] in they will not endure sound Doctrine
[40:56] but after their own last shall they Heap
[40:59] to themselves teachers having itching
[41:01] ears right and they shall turn away
[41:03] their ears from the truth and shall be
[41:06] turned onto

[41:19] Ministry
[41:21] Hallelujah my brother my sister we thank
[41:24] God that we are not in error right amen
[41:28] we thank God that we cannot be
[41:30] deceived because we have our spiritual
[41:33] and today hanging on our chest guarding
[41:37] against every falsehood and you see when
[41:39] you have it you are confident in place
[41:42] that you found yourself you are
[41:44] confident and you are happy I remember
[41:47] when the prophet told us about when he
[41:49] went beyond the kitten of time and he
[41:52] say he saw a lot of people there and
[41:54] there was an angel guiding him all you
[41:57] know to to to spy all the place and when
[42:00] he saw those people he said what that
[42:04] people were calling my precious brother
[42:06] my precious brother like this you know
[42:08] he says a young lady HED him said don't
[42:13] you remember me he said no I can't
[42:14] remember you he said well I am the old
[42:17] lady 91 year old when you baptized me so
[42:22] what now this old lady have 10 to be a
[42:27] young lady between the ages of 18 and
[42:30] 21 with a headful cover and the prophet
[42:34] said what so he went from one place to
[42:37] another and when the people Rejoice him
[42:40] like that he asked the angel are these
[42:43] all my people he said no these are not
[42:45] your people but they are your
[42:49] converts then he said are poor people
[42:53] here and he said to his amazement
[42:57] he said yes and the prophet said that I
[43:00] preach like Paul he said then all the
[43:03] host said that we are resting on
[43:07] that Hallelujah so you see that the
[43:10] prophet used the word of Paul as a and a
[43:14] Tom Hallelujah today we are using the
[43:16] message as a and a Tom what the
[43:19] difference it's the same the message
[43:22] have opened our eyes further into the
[43:24] word of God you can not go away from the
[43:27] message and you cannot go away from the
[43:28] word it is the same thing an expl
[43:31] further explanation of the word amen
[43:35] before we go I want you to let you know
[43:37] that the urim means
[43:41] light and the T also means
[43:45] Perfection so a light in it
[43:48] Perfection amen and brother sister
[43:51] tonight I am leaving you with this let
[43:53] us continue to let the and the Tom him
[43:56] hang Upon Our
[43:58] chest let it guide us against all
[44:02] falsehood let it guide against all
[44:05] lies let us maintain the truth that we
[44:08] have and when we have that oh brother we
[44:12] are more than conquerors amen nothing
[44:15] can intimidate us amen because we have
[44:17] the truth because we know the truth
[44:20] because we can we can differentiate lies
[44:22] from the truth amen that day before King
[44:27] King
[44:28] Nebuchadnezzar can we imagine he erected
[44:31] that image and said that every people
[44:33] should bow but these three Hebrew
[44:36] children they look to the and the Tom
[44:38] him and they found out that no King we
[44:41] cannot make you make us
[44:44] unbelievers we have a and Tom and
[44:47] anything that you say we check from it
[44:49] and when we check we should not bow down
[44:52] to your
[44:53] image right and so when the the symbols
[44:57] and the trumpets were blown all the
[45:00] people Bow Down and Worship the image
[45:03] but these three Hebrew children they
[45:05] stood and it was reported to the king
[45:08] king there have been some vagabonds
[45:12] here they don't want to respect your
[45:15] instruction he said who are those these
[45:17] three Hebrew children they claim they
[45:19] have a God that they worship and for
[45:21] that matter they are not going to bow
[45:23] down to your image he say is that so he
[45:24] say yes they bring them and they brought
[45:28] them before King
[45:30] Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuchadnezzar asked
[45:32] them do you know the consequence if you
[45:35] don't bow down we are going to burn you
[45:37] in a fairy
[45:39] furnace say yes King we are not careful
[45:42] to answer you this you can burn us but
[45:46] we know we have stood in the and the Tom
[45:49] him yes our God gave us a promise he
[45:52] said he will be with us all over the
[45:54] place that we find ourselves amen and
[45:57] right now we are not going to bow down
[45:58] to your image we know the god that we
[46:02] serve will save us from your hands amen
[46:04] but even let us tell you if he doesn't
[46:08] come we are not going to bow down you
[46:11] know what gave them that confidence it
[46:14] was the heum and the toming upon their
[46:17] hearts I tell you that if you have it it
[46:20] gives you confidence in everything that
[46:22] you
[46:23] do and the Book of said well
[46:26] soers set the oven on fire do it the
[46:30] first second third fourth fifth and
[46:32] sixth and seven can you imagine that
[46:36] they hited the oven seven
[46:39] times but that was the mistake that
[46:42] Nebuchadnezzar and his people
[46:44] did because the number seven is always
[46:48] God's
[46:50] number Hallelujah so the moment they
[46:53] heed the over the seven time then God
[46:56] himself came
[46:57] down into the
[46:59] fire Hallelujah and so when they bound
[47:02] these three brothers and threw them into
[47:05] the fire can you imagine the Flames that
[47:08] came out from the fire pass on the
[47:09] soldiers and they
[47:11] died but these three brothers were in a
[47:14] fire jumping and
[47:16] dancing Hallelujah it was because of the
[47:19] faith that they had in the Lord it was
[47:21] the confidence they had in the Lord
[47:23] brother and sister because they stood in
[47:25] the UN and Tom him and has given them
[47:29] faith and they were dancing
[47:31] singing
[47:33] preparing Hallelujah and they were
[47:36] amazed say what they rash and told King
[47:39] Nebuchadnezzar said King we have seen
[47:41] something we have never seen before we
[47:44] have always been burning people in this
[47:45] furnace but
[47:47] today something has happened King can
[47:50] you come and have a look of
[47:52] yourself and the badar came out from his
[47:55] throne
[47:57] and came to the F
[47:58] fers and bow down himself to look at
[48:02] what was going on you know why he bow
[48:05] down because the almighty God has come
[48:07] into the
[48:09] fire then he
[48:11] said
[48:13] Brothers how many people did we throw in
[48:16] the fairy fers yeah they told him King
[48:19] three people he said no but I see a
[48:22] fourth
[48:23] man and that fourth one look like the
[48:25] Son of God oh
[48:28] Hallelujah then he said Shadrach mes and
[48:31] Abednego the servant of the most high
[48:33] God come out from the
[48:36] fire
[48:38] yes you can bend
[48:40] fire if you put fire into fire what you
[48:44] get is more fire yes Hallelujah they
[48:49] were burning the fire of God was burning
[48:52] in them because they have the Holy Ghost
[48:55] in them and you want to put the holy
[48:57] ghost in the fire you are going to get
[48:59] more fire Hallelujah and so when they
[49:02] came out the bible say that there was
[49:04] not even a smell of smoke on their
[49:07] body their hair one did not burn they
