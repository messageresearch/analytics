[0:00] we've been addressing through some of
[0:02] the services how that God's love is
[0:03] misunderstood and we acknowledge that
[0:06] human love is imperfect and having
[0:08] either manifested that human love or
[0:10] experienced that human love on some
[0:12] level we realize that humans love
[0:15] differently and we process love
[0:17] differently and since we have certain
[0:19] attributes we attribute to love and
[0:21] certain feelings we attribute to love
[0:22] and certain ways that we might want love
[0:24] to look it changes things or it hurts
[0:27] things when we look to God and we expect
[0:29] him to love like our parents did or
[0:31] expect them to love like we do because
[0:33] though there can be a lot of positives
[0:34] to that there's also a shortcoming to
[0:36] that because human love is temporal and
[0:40] I want to revisit a familiar theme
[0:41] something that I think we kind of
[0:43] touched on through several Services
[0:44] Through The Years here and then maybe
[0:47] just drill down real deeply on one
[0:49] aspect to kind of help us to know the
[0:52] love of God and not just to know it but
[0:53] to trust it to believe it
[0:55] and uh this is I'll say this now and I'm
[0:59] kind of forecasting what we want to look
[1:00] at on Sunday morning is the connection
[1:02] between the word and perfect love and
[1:06] how those things work together you could
[1:07] even call Charity that perfect love and
[1:10] today kind of looking at the
[1:12] manifestation of love and that's why
[1:13] we're calling it Love's evidence this is
[1:14] the manifestation of love and looking at
[1:18] this will also address uh the evidence
[1:20] of the Holy Ghost and how some believe
[1:21] the evidence may be this and others may
[1:23] think it's something else we already
[1:25] touched on how that perfect love is the
[1:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost well brother
[1:28] bear says whatever you do it takes
[1:30] perfect love to be there whatever you do
[1:31] don't miss it make sure you have perfect
[1:33] love it's not adding a requirement to
[1:35] the requirement already to be sealed
[1:37] with the Holy Ghost that seal is perfect
[1:39] love so we'll kind of be looking at the
[1:41] evidence of that perfect love
[1:43] and this is kind of maybe a thesis
[1:46] statement for tonight but especially for
[1:48] Sunday morning the word is perfect love
[1:50] expressed that that's just the most
[1:52] simple way I think I can put it it's the
[1:54] perfect love is the Divine manifestation
[1:56] of the word of God you don't have the
[1:58] word that's one way and then perfect
[2:00] love another they're they're essentially
[2:02] one and the same
[2:03] and as we look at this Love's evidence
[2:06] tonight I say that there are certain
[2:07] attributes and I might want to do air
[2:09] quotes with that there's certain
[2:10] attributes associated with love that can
[2:13] be impersonated
[2:14] certain things you say well if you love
[2:15] me you would do this or when love does
[2:17] something well love is patient and love
[2:19] is kind and love speaketh no evil love
[2:21] thinketh No Evil And so there's ways
[2:23] that we begin to process what that looks
[2:24] like in human interaction and and how it
[2:26] could be manifested in a relationship
[2:28] and so there's attributes associated
[2:30] with love that either can be
[2:31] impersonated or misinterpreted where
[2:34] love expresses itself and maybe you
[2:36] don't see that as love or Love Is manif
[2:38] Love is Manifest in a way where someone
[2:40] says wow oh that that looks like real
[2:42] perfect love but there's something that
[2:44] makes perfect love what it is and those
[2:46] things can be missed sometimes
[2:48] do you recall I think it might have been
[2:50] even in the first service so I know you
[2:51] have perfect recall and you all know
[2:53] exactly what I'm talking about
[2:54] look we mentioned how that perfect love
[2:56] is not just sacrificial
[2:58] because there's a there's a tendency to
[3:00] think oh well love just sacrifice itself
[3:02] and love is this but love is more than
[3:04] just sacrificial but it's submissive to
[3:06] God's word first
[3:08] so if God's word says to give you give
[3:10] if God's word says not to give you don't
[3:12] give so if you're being called if
[3:15] someone's demanding a sacrifice but the
[3:17] word doesn't demand it then that
[3:18] wouldn't be fulfilling the word of God
[3:20] that wouldn't be love if you went beyond
[3:22] the boundaries of love you went beyond
[3:24] what God's word required you to do you
[3:26] can't make yourself out to be a hero of
[3:29] love in sacrificing yourself if it isn't
[3:31] according to the word of God
[3:33] in John chapter 10 verses 17 and 18 and
[3:36] this just kind of hits this right on the
[3:38] nose as far as perfect love is not just
[3:40] sacrificial but it's submissive to God's
[3:42] word he says therefore doth my father
[3:44] love me because I lay down my life that
[3:47] I might take it again so it's a kind of
[3:49] sounds like he's saying that God loves
[3:51] me because I'm willing to die I'm
[3:52] willing to lay down my life but the
[3:53] harmony that existed between the father
[3:55] and the son is the son expresses Christ
[3:58] expresses I know the father loves me and
[4:00] I love the father and whatever he asked
[4:01] me to do I'll do it because that's what
[4:04] love is and love is not asking Christ to
[4:07] do anything that love can't cover love
[4:09] is not demanding something of Christ
[4:10] that love can't give so it's not a it's
[4:13] not an unsafe love he says my father
[4:15] loves me because I laid down my life
[4:17] that I might take it again he says no
[4:20] man taketh it from me but I lay it down
[4:22] of myself this is a very interesting
[4:25] statement he says I have power to lay it
[4:26] down and I have power to take it against
[4:28] we might say well he had the power to
[4:30] lay down his life he had power to take
[4:32] it up again he says I laid down my life
[4:34] then I might take it up again I have
[4:36] power to do this you're not going to
[4:37] take it away from me I'm going to lay it
[4:38] down and the father loves me and I love
[4:41] him so I'm going to lay down my life and
[4:43] I'm not only going to lay down my life
[4:44] but father's gonna raise it back up
[4:45] again and notice what he says this
[4:47] commandment have I received of my father
[4:49] so his power to lay down his life and
[4:52] his power to raise it back up was
[4:53] connected with the word of God it's
[4:56] connected with God's will it wasn't that
[4:57] just some kind of power that he could
[4:59] exercise whenever he wanted to say hey
[5:00] guys watch this and then raise himself
[5:02] back up but it had to be according to
[5:04] the will of God so when we think of the
[5:07] greater love the greater love hath no
[5:08] man than this that he laid down his life
[5:10] for his friends it's not that like
[5:12] killing yourself or taking your life or
[5:14] sacrificing is the greater love but the
[5:16] Greater Love was not just a sacrifice
[5:18] but it was an obedience to God's word
[5:21] it says in first Samuel 15 22 maybe
[5:23] we're missing something by not looking
[5:25] at the context but Samuel said to Saul
[5:28] hath the Lord great Lord as great
[5:30] delight and burn offerings and
[5:31] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[5:34] the Lord
[5:35] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[5:38] and to hearken than the fat of rams and
[5:41] that touches on some particular things
[5:44] that maybe some people are sensitive to
[5:45] because they think oh well I just want
[5:47] to pour my love out on Christ and I just
[5:49] want to Lavish him with my praise and
[5:51] they think that through worship and
[5:52] praise and manifestation of gifts and
[5:55] crying and Sorrowing and all sorts of
[5:56] bodily exercise that that is that is a
[5:59] greater worship to God that's a greater
[6:00] affection to God or that demonstrates a
[6:02] greater love but obeying God's voice
[6:04] demonstrates a greater love it's not
[6:07] just sacrificing when Christ laid down
[6:09] his life it wasn't just saying what's
[6:10] the greatest love what's the greatest
[6:11] love I think if you gave your life that
[6:13] would be the greatest love it was this
[6:15] is what God has asked me to do asked him
[6:17] to do the ultimate to lay down his life
[6:18] but it wasn't without that promise that
[6:21] I'll take it back up again but it was
[6:23] according to the Commandment that he
[6:24] received from his father and to obey was
[6:27] better than sacrifice I mean obviously
[6:30] hypothetically if that's not what God
[6:31] wanted him to do he couldn't find a
[6:33] greater love by doing something that
[6:35] wasn't according to the word of God it
[6:37] was according to God's commandment and
[6:39] so obeying the voice of the Lord because
[6:41] obeying is better than sacrifice and to
[6:43] hearken is better than the fat of ram so
[6:46] we have to be careful not to think that
[6:48] certain things will Express a greater
[6:50] love to God if we're not obeying God
[6:54] and Christ as he was will he says the
[6:57] father loves me and I'll lay down my
[6:58] life we could say that Christ was the
[7:01] manifestation of perfect love
[7:03] yeah he was perfect love revealed he was
[7:05] the heart of the father demonstrated he
[7:07] was the perfect word of God the perfect
[7:08] love of God expressed now I want to read
[7:11] I'm going to re refer back to some
[7:13] things we read on Sunday but I want to
[7:15] read this statement from Christ as the
[7:16] mystery of God revealed and I want you
[7:18] to think about the the seventh seal
[7:20] implication and that's not a title but
[7:22] it might make a good one but when we
[7:24] think about what God has done in this
[7:26] last day when we think about what he's
[7:27] preaching here and we think about the
[7:28] word of God opening up just think about
[7:30] what this means for the elect he says
[7:33] Christ has Mercy the law put you in jail
[7:36] but couldn't get you out now chew on
[7:38] this one the prophet is is God's justice
[7:41] to condemn you and kill you for it
[7:44] that's right but Jesus was God's love
[7:47] and Revelation to let know to a
[7:49] predestinated seed that he had called
[7:51] you
[7:52] so Jesus is God's love and Revelation to
[7:54] the predestinated seed that's what he is
[7:56] Christ is is God's love and Revelation
[7:59] to the predestinated seed Jesus Christ
[8:01] Brothers said is the love of God Jesus
[8:04] Christ is God's heart so when we see the
[8:06] revelation of Jesus Christ it's
[8:08] revealing something and opening up
[8:09] something not just a historical lesson
[8:12] but it's revealing God's love and
[8:14] Revelation to the predestinated seed as
[8:16] brother Graham says on the first seal I
[8:18] used to think that God was angry at me
[8:19] but Christ loved me but he says Christ
[8:21] is the very Heart Of God so that doesn't
[8:24] mean Christ is angry too it means that
[8:26] God's not angry because if Christ loves
[8:29] and he demonstrated love that was the
[8:31] love of the father expressed so Christ
[8:33] isn't the mercy seed and that he's
[8:35] standing between you and an Angry God
[8:37] that set on destroying you but God's
[8:40] justice demanded a penalty for sin God
[8:43] wants that to be satisfied so his son
[8:46] stands for the perpetuation representing
[8:48] the heart of God and the desire of God
[8:50] to redeem you
[8:52] and so Christ was in the very
[8:54] manifestation of God when he laid down
[8:57] his life
[8:59] now that might be a manifestation that
[9:02] we could all get on board with to say
[9:03] now there's no greater love
[9:05] than that when Christ laid down his life
[9:07] and so Christ is the heart of God and
[9:09] Christ is the revelation of God's love
[9:12] to the predestinated seed that we would
[9:13] know our election and we'd be secure in
[9:16] his love
[9:17] that Christ is the manifestation of
[9:19] perfect love and it's the same Christ
[9:21] that begins to act in John chapter 2.
[9:24] and I guess you could say well it seems
[9:25] pretty early on in his ministry so maybe
[9:27] he was just getting used to it
[9:29] but in John chapter 2
[9:31] verses 15 to 17 is we'll read these
[9:34] three verses it says and when Jesus so
[9:36] he'd come down to Jerusalem and when he
[9:37] had made a scourge of small cords
[9:40] he drove them all out of the temple and
[9:42] the sheep and The Oxen so he had taken
[9:44] these cords and it says a scourge of
[9:48] small chords so in other words he's made
[9:49] himself a whip
[9:51] he's made himself an instrument that
[9:53] he's going to use to drive out the
[9:54] animals and he's going to cause all of
[9:56] them to run out and think of the chaos
[9:58] that he's now causing this is something
[9:59] that had been entrenched this is
[10:01] tradition it was very very robust and a
[10:03] practice that was fully they're fully
[10:05] engaged and had accepted and so not only
[10:08] did he drive the animals out by maybe
[10:09] beating them and whipping them with the
[10:11] small cords but then he goes to the
[10:12] changer's money he says and he poured
[10:14] out the changes money and overthrew the
[10:16] tables
[10:18] now just if you can in your mind not for
[10:21] very long just imagine that and kind of
[10:23] allow your mind imagination to wonder
[10:25] and picture what this scene looks like
[10:27] when Jesus shows up braids a whip and
[10:30] starts running off all the animals and
[10:32] then as he's done running the animals
[10:33] out he goes over to the money changers
[10:35] and he dumps their money out then he
[10:36] goes to the table and flips the tables
[10:38] over and we all go oh
[10:40] what a temper fit right this is I can't
[10:44] believe he's doing this who is this guy
[10:45] we need to tell his mom Mary get over
[10:47] here
[10:48] and so here he is throwing these things
[10:51] out and he said unto them that sold
[10:53] doves I don't know why he picked on the
[10:54] dove sellers but it says take these
[10:56] things hence maybe because he couldn't
[10:57] whip him and get him out of there he
[10:58] needed to run off at the cages he says
[11:00] make not my father's house and House of
[11:03] merchandise
[11:05] and when he has done this when he has
[11:07] come and he has made a whip and run off
[11:09] all the uh the sheep and The Oxen and
[11:11] told the the dove Keepers to run off
[11:13] with them and overthrew the tables and
[11:15] poured out the money he says don't make
[11:17] my father's house a den of Thieves and
[11:18] it says in verse 17 the disciples
[11:20] remembered that it was written this is
[11:22] in Psalm 69 9 the Zeal of thine house
[11:25] hath eaten me up
[11:26] so what was Jesus doing he was
[11:28] manifesting prophecy David had already
[11:31] prophesied that Zeal of thine house hath
[11:33] eaten me up this Zeal would have been a
[11:34] terminology that was very familiar with
[11:36] even that sect of the zealots that
[11:37] believed in in radical uh defense of the
[11:40] law and and even putting people to death
[11:42] and here Christ is not just impatient
[11:45] he's not petulant he's not going in
[11:46] there said this is my father's house I
[11:48] need to take back control and it's not a
[11:50] temper fit might look like one it wasn't
[11:53] wrath it wasn't anger in a humanistic
[11:55] sense but it says the Zeal of thine
[11:58] house
[11:59] the prophecy had overcome them the
[12:01] purity of the word of God the very thing
[12:03] that he was called to do he begins to
[12:05] act in this and so this was perfect love
[12:08] being manifested
[12:11] everybody starts saying Hey Google buy
[12:13] me a scourge of small courts
[12:17] but this is perfect love this is a Zeal
[12:19] according to knowledge
[12:21] this is loyalty
[12:23] only to God's word
[12:26] now and I think there's a lot that we
[12:28] could dwell on this and maybe take it
[12:30] from different angles but in the the
[12:31] sermon earnestly contending for the
[12:33] faith that was once delivered to the
[12:34] Saints Brothers says do you believe
[12:35] Jesus had compassion
[12:37] he said he was full of love now I'm
[12:39] going to come back to uh this scene in
[12:42] John chapter two but now brother bear
[12:43] was talking about him uh how
[12:46] how much you know maybe at the pool of
[12:48] Bethesda how there's all these sick
[12:49] people and Jesus just walked right by
[12:51] all they're sitting because we say well
[12:52] love would heal that one love would heal
[12:54] that one this is what love would do
[12:55] right when we say that we're saying our
[12:58] love would
[12:59] our loved one when someone would come up
[13:01] for prayer or be have a demon on him
[13:03] we'd say oh just cast it out and just
[13:04] pray that they're well and and that
[13:06] would be our empathy that would be our
[13:07] very least our sympathy that would be
[13:09] our human emotions and and oh my
[13:11] goodness this is this is horrible let's
[13:13] pray let's pray but perfect love would
[13:15] say wait a minute that's there for a
[13:17] reason
[13:18] or this is why it's there and if you'll
[13:20] just do this that'll leave
[13:22] and what we might do even be enthused is
[13:25] want to pray for someone to cast a demon
[13:27] off God put it there for a reason and
[13:28] what might just have to come right back
[13:31] because God that's perfect love that
[13:33] sometimes allows things to happen in
[13:35] order to get his children where he wants
[13:36] them to be so he says do you believe
[13:38] Jesus had compassion and that word
[13:39] compassion the Old Testament is love he
[13:41] says he was full of love
[13:43] but it's just like the people sometimes
[13:45] in love they forget what kind of love
[13:48] they are talking about the feel your
[13:50] love and the agape love now I think this
[13:52] is the convenience of using those two to
[13:55] divide between God's love and human love
[13:57] he says both of them are love but one's
[13:59] love above and the other is love here on
[14:01] Earth and as I was talking to a reporter
[14:04] today I said the love down here the
[14:05] human love would make you shoot a man on
[14:08] account of your wife but the love that
[14:09] comes from above would make you pray for
[14:11] his lost soul and we could all say Amen
[14:14] I think you're right this is exactly a
[14:16] good description of what human love will
[14:18] do human level drive people to start
[14:20] wars and to kill and to do all sorts of
[14:23] things in the name of infatuation and
[14:25] dependency and they call it love and
[14:27] this is love and I would swim in Ocean
[14:28] and I would do this and I would do that
[14:30] and this is all the things that what man
[14:32] would do for Love's sake and and brother
[14:34] I'm saying here love the human love
[14:36] would cause a man to murder he says but
[14:38] perfect love would intervene and pray
[14:40] for the man's soul
[14:42] he says quite different
[14:43] one of them is a love
[14:46] down here on this level human love and
[14:48] that's the that's the dichotomy I think
[14:50] that we should be looking at human love
[14:51] versus God's love he says and the other
[14:53] is the love that comes from above
[14:55] and in compassions that looks out upon
[14:57] the crowd and say oh won't you heal this
[14:59] person and he's sick and he's in such
[15:01] need this is the good man we know him
[15:03] heal this little baby look that's human
[15:05] compassion
[15:08] but real he says here it is
[15:10] real Divine compassion
[15:13] is to do the will of him that sent you
[15:16] so this is divine love divine love is to
[15:19] do God's will plain and simple Divine
[15:22] love is to do God's will maybe we'll
[15:23] pick up on it on Sunday Lord willing on
[15:26] how that certain things are the
[15:28] fulfilling of the law and you realize to
[15:30] do God's will does not uh is necessarily
[15:33] going to cause you to act in a way to
[15:36] you're not hating you're not murdering
[15:38] right you're going to be operating in in
[15:41] a way that is best for mankind even
[15:43] though it might hurt and even though it
[15:44] might rebuke sin uh you're operating
[15:46] according to the will of God and it
[15:48] keeps us from doing a lot of the hurtful
[15:50] things we do as humans and if we're
[15:52] offering the word of God when God's word
[15:53] hurts it's so that it can heal
[15:56] it's so that it can hold man accountable
[15:58] so it's just God has a different way of
[16:00] loving than we do but the man says Agape
[16:02] speaking about Allah agape love he says
[16:04] but love is to do the will of him that
[16:06] sends you
[16:07] so this Higher Love This Agape Love This
[16:10] Love that is higher than human love is
[16:12] and I don't mean to be too strict and
[16:14] put a period on it uh to run the risk of
[16:16] trying to shove everything down in this
[16:17] narrow view uh and I don't like to do
[16:20] that in general I find sometimes when
[16:22] I'm listening to the word of God and
[16:24] it's being preached sometimes you feel
[16:26] that maybe uh it's been put in such a
[16:28] way to where that's the only way you
[16:30] have to see it and this and if you're
[16:31] not seeing it that way maybe you're
[16:32] seeing it wrong and so I'm not I'm not
[16:35] I'll even put it this way God's word is
[16:37] so great that I can't explain it
[16:39] so all I'm doing is describing it
[16:42] okay so as I describe it you might think
[16:45] well that's a real narrow application
[16:46] all right I'm just describing this part
[16:48] and so it could I feel that what you can
[16:51] say about this in just a very simple way
[16:53] is divine love is to do God's will
[16:56] that's it a perfect love is doing God's
[17:00] will
[17:01] so now brother Brandon when he treats
[17:02] John Chapter 2 and he does it in a few
[17:04] places to to in great depth in and the
[17:07] sermon Paradox at a businessman's
[17:09] breakfast he's making these statements
[17:11] just before we read this one he's saying
[17:13] Look what Jesus of Nazareth did the
[17:15] other day what'd he ever do for the
[17:17] Fruit of the Spirit
[17:19] brother man describes the fruits of the
[17:20] fruits of the spirit and then what Jesus
[17:22] did he goes not much fruit of the spirit
[17:24] there is there
[17:25] this is this is him saying this is what
[17:27] the critic says about him taking a
[17:29] scourge of small cords driving out the
[17:31] sheep in the ox and pouring over the
[17:33] changer's money flipping over the tables
[17:34] and telling the keepers of the dove
[17:36] delete those that sell dust to leave
[17:40] I say it doesn't look like these are
[17:41] much of the fruits of the spirit so now
[17:44] he makes the statement what is the fruit
[17:45] of the spirit the manifestation of the
[17:47] promised word
[17:49] I think this in some ways that might
[17:51] kind of come as a little bit of a a an
[17:53] interrupter you know some kind of
[17:54] counter statement but if you think about
[17:56] it like of course
[17:58] God's spirit is his word the fruit of
[18:01] the spirit is going to be a
[18:02] manifestation of the promised word I
[18:04] mean it has to be that that makes a lot
[18:07] of spiritual sense to us he says they
[18:09] said if they had just have stopped to
[18:11] look
[18:12] he did not have these things that they
[18:15] had fruit of the spirit or anything and
[18:17] in other words he's saying the kind old
[18:18] priest
[18:19] and he starts describing he's making the
[18:21] comparison the kind old priest you know
[18:23] dedicates the baby goes to the home when
[18:25] your mother dies and he acts in a way
[18:26] that's kind and sensitive and and
[18:29] engaging and then you come over here and
[18:30] you see Christ when he shows up at the
[18:32] temple he's driving out the animals he's
[18:34] flipping over the tables he's scattering
[18:36] money everywhere and he's saying if we
[18:38] took the kind old priest and compared it
[18:40] to Christ in this instance we
[18:42] humanistically would say that's the
[18:44] Fruit of the Spirit
[18:45] but in reality the word is being
[18:48] manifested and that was the fruit of the
[18:50] spirit so when he says um that they did
[18:54] he did not have he did not have the
[18:56] fruit of the spirit he's talking about
[18:57] the human side that we look at but the
[19:00] real reality is the fruit of the spirit
[19:02] is the manifestation of the word
[19:04] he said but the word that was promised
[19:06] that day was manifesting itself that was
[19:08] exactly the light of the hour that was
[19:11] it no matter how much education and how
[19:13] much you speak with tongues how much
[19:15] kind gentle in everything you are
[19:18] because the word is not against being
[19:20] kind it's not against being gentle it's
[19:22] not against speaking in tongues it says
[19:23] unless you accept that word of the hour
[19:25] when it's manifested before you you're
[19:27] in the same predicament
[19:29] the same predicament as the kind old
[19:31] priest the same predicament of the
[19:32] people when they witnessed the what they
[19:34] called the wrath of the anger of Jesus
[19:36] of Nazareth and they said you know what
[19:37] we'll just stick with our priest at
[19:38] least they're nice about this and they
[19:39] at least let us make a living and they
[19:41] let us do these things and they weren't
[19:42] mean to those that sold doves and they
[19:44] might just have this whole Paradigm that
[19:45] thing I would rather like this guy
[19:47] because of this than this guy because he
[19:49] seems very angry he says but they did
[19:51] not accept the word of the hour when it
[19:53] was manifested before them and he says
[19:55] if you do that today you're in the same
[19:56] predicament they were in then
[19:59] now Galatians chapter 5 verses 22 and 23
[20:03] it tells us what the fruit of the
[20:04] spirits are
[20:06] and then I think it is important to note
[20:08] that it says the fruit of the spirit is
[20:11] love joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[20:15] goodness Faith meekness temperance
[20:18] if I could say this just maybe stir some
[20:21] thought the fruit of the spirit is
[20:24] and it describes these many different
[20:26] things
[20:27] does it suggest then if you don't have
[20:29] them all
[20:31] you don't have the fruit
[20:33] time for a breakout session
[20:36] he says against such there is no law in
[20:39] other words there's no prescription
[20:41] against these things to do these things
[20:43] is not to manifest anything contrary to
[20:45] the word of God there's no brother
[20:47] brother bam when he says doesn't matter
[20:48] how kind gentle in everything you are
[20:50] and how much joy or peace or
[20:51] long-suffering or gentleness and
[20:53] goodness you have and meekness and
[20:54] Temperance if you have that your evil is
[20:56] saying no but if you reject the word
[20:58] this can't be what you're claiming it to
[21:00] be
[21:01] because the spirit can't reject the word
[21:02] so in the same sermon on the paradox
[21:06] and the business is breakfast he says
[21:07] what is the fruit of the spirit he goes
[21:09] love joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[21:11] goodness fruit of the spirit many people
[21:13] rely on that sometimes that's the devil
[21:20] I didn't know this one got snuck in
[21:21] there
[21:23] sometimes that's the devil he can
[21:25] impersonate that to the letter
[21:29] this is this stops you in your tracks
[21:31] and we all go wait a minute brother
[21:32] Aaron is that a typo is that 64 to 64
[21:34] come after 63
[21:37] are we counting this or does it count
[21:38] down or up and we start having this
[21:40] conundrum right and we realize remember
[21:42] that what year did he say it the year in
[21:44] which he was a prophet
[21:45] and give give some weight to it
[21:48] and he says that sometimes the devil he
[21:51] can impersonate that to the letter
[21:52] letter so the the fruit of the spirit
[21:55] these love joy peace long-suffering
[21:58] gentleness goodness brother Batman
[22:00] saying the meekness and Temperance is
[22:01] that and I and I want to be very I want
[22:04] to be very careful on how I describe
[22:05] this because I'm wanting to uh I want to
[22:08] say what brother Branham said and I want
[22:10] to be faithful the way he said it having
[22:11] read the different places he says it and
[22:13] having several more statements to read
[22:14] to you here I believe that what he says
[22:16] will will help Focus what I'm about to
[22:18] say that there's ways that this can be
[22:21] manifested that to us oh that's Joy oh
[22:24] that's peace oh that's long-suffering
[22:26] that's being meat that's being what a
[22:28] nice sweet person and oh my that's so
[22:30] kind and that's so loving and you say oh
[22:32] that has to be the Lord that that has to
[22:34] be the fruit of the spirit brother bear
[22:35] said not you can't hold that as an
[22:37] Evidence
[22:38] because the devil can impersonate that
[22:40] he says he can impersonate speaking in
[22:43] tongues to the letter interpretation of
[22:45] it to the letter
[22:48] any of those gifts he can impersonate
[22:53] so these when the fruit of the spirit
[22:56] becomes fruits
[22:58] when you divide it up they can be
[23:00] impersonated
[23:01] so these fruits can be duplicated apart
[23:04] from the actual spirit
[23:07] being the nature behind it it can
[23:10] actually be the fruits can be divided
[23:12] from the nature of the spirit so now
[23:14] it's not the fruit now it's fruits and
[23:16] each one of those can be duplicated or
[23:18] manifested apart from the nature and and
[23:21] they're not in their pure form
[23:24] brother Branham and the sermon lamb and
[23:26] Dove
[23:27] okay good this is 1957.
[23:30] he says and the Holy Spirit falls into a
[23:32] meeting and sometimes the believer and
[23:34] the unbeliever worship by The Same
[23:35] Spirit
[23:36] but the fruit of the spirit proves what
[23:38] you are
[23:39] not the reaction of the spirit
[23:42] not to speak with tongues not to shout
[23:45] that goes with it too that all goes with
[23:47] it amen
[23:49] says but unless the fruit of the spirit
[23:51] Bears record with God's word
[23:54] your ju you just got an outward
[23:56] demonstration
[23:57] this I I actually went and and found
[24:01] this statement just felt impressed to
[24:02] put it in here just to use this kind of
[24:05] as those those guidelines for us to
[24:07] recognize that uh even if it stands to
[24:10] hopefully kind of buffer the things I'm
[24:12] trying to say to recognize that brother
[24:14] Branham is dividing between the true
[24:16] fruit of the spirit and those that are
[24:19] we recognize as being fruits of the
[24:21] spirit that can be impersonated
[24:23] he said but unless thee for the spirit
[24:25] Bears record with the word of God you've
[24:27] just got an outward demonstration
[24:29] so you don't have you don't possess the
[24:32] fruit of the spirit which manifests joy
[24:34] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[24:36] Faith meekness Temperance but you have
[24:39] outward demonstrations of joy peace
[24:42] long-suffering generous goodness Faith
[24:43] meekness temperance
[24:45] so it's something that looks it looks
[24:47] like the fruit
[24:49] but the seed will determine what it is
[24:51] right it might look like the same but
[24:54] the life determines whether or not it is
[24:56] so he says and today we're relying so
[24:58] much on outward emotions and
[25:00] demonstrations when it takes a genuine
[25:02] pure Born Again Holy Ghost LED life to
[25:04] prove what you are
[25:05] amen he said now that's right my dear
[25:08] brother and sister unless there is fruit
[25:10] and the fruit of the spirit is not
[25:13] outward demonstrations
[25:15] it's an inward work of Grace
[25:18] love joy peace long-suffering goodness
[25:20] Faith meekness gentleness patience there
[25:22] you are
[25:23] so when we look at it that way when
[25:25] brother Brown describes it that way
[25:26] we're able to look at things that might
[25:28] be a outward human expression
[25:31] but it might in this outward human
[25:33] expression it might seem kind it might
[25:35] seem good it might seem Meek or gentle
[25:37] and all those things and say it might
[25:39] seem that way but he's saying that the
[25:41] real work of God is when you possess
[25:43] that inwardly by the holy spirit it's an
[25:46] inward work of Grace it's not it's not
[25:48] just doing these things and trying to
[25:50] have the fruits of the spirit and in
[25:52] demonstrating Grace and demonstrating
[25:53] joy and demonstrating long-suffering but
[25:55] it's it's having that inward work of
[25:58] Grace that's the true fruit of the
[25:59] spirit
[26:00] and if I could say this
[26:02] and I think this will kind of help in
[26:04] this teaching that these our human
[26:06] manifestations of these things they
[26:09] might not actually be promoting God's
[26:11] perfect will
[26:13] it might be sympathy
[26:15] it might be your own uh your own
[26:17] complexes it might be something that is
[26:20] just saying oh well I think the nice
[26:21] thing to do in this instance would be
[26:24] and it's not really perfect love
[26:25] operating through you it's not the
[26:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the
[26:29] spirit manifesting perfect love but it's
[26:31] that Tainted Love that's driven by other
[26:34] factors your own Pride you know if I did
[26:37] this for them then that would look like
[26:38] I'm living for others right
[26:41] and and well I want to do this because I
[26:44] want to I've read the book How to Win
[26:45] Friends and Influence People and and
[26:47] you're doing things kind of more uh more
[26:50] calculated and contrived and you're
[26:51] doing it as well I've been reading
[26:53] enough human behavior books where I know
[26:54] this is what you ought to do and I've
[26:56] been reading enough about the message to
[26:57] know this is what you ought to do if it
[26:59] that those things could be trying to do
[27:01] God of service without it being his will
[27:05] and it just sounds right and this looks
[27:07] good and all the Optics are yeah hey man
[27:09] the Lord's with you go for it that
[27:11] sounds good yeah I mean everything seems
[27:13] right but in in it the mode of an
[27:15] objective is not submitted to God's word
[27:17] or even in performing it you're not
[27:19] fulfilling God's will that cannot be the
[27:22] spirit
[27:24] so brother Branham in the sermon going
[27:26] beyond the camp I think it's a much
[27:28] larger
[27:29] statement you could come to this to read
[27:31] but he's talking about tongues and
[27:33] Sensations and experience
[27:35] he says and do you know all those things
[27:37] can be impersonated by the devil
[27:40] there's just one thing he cannot
[27:41] impersonate
[27:43] that's the word
[27:46] now this is me now perceiving this
[27:50] I feel like this is going to be a real
[27:51] hard you know jerk in the steering wheel
[27:54] that takes the exit now but
[27:56] this is if Divine love is the
[27:58] manifestation of God's word
[28:01] and the fruit of the spirit can be
[28:02] impersonated and he says oh the spirit
[28:04] the fruit of the spirit is love and joy
[28:06] and peace and longsuffering and some of
[28:08] these very characteristics describe
[28:10] charity say oh well if these things can
[28:12] be man interpreted where does that put
[28:14] us he said well there's just one thing
[28:15] that cannot be in person and we know
[28:16] this is not the only place he says it he
[28:18] says that's the word
[28:20] now this is where it's I love doing the
[28:23] teaching on Wednesday night I feel this
[28:24] might be the reason why God just uh kind
[28:27] of course corrected me to say this now I
[28:28] know that you all have
[28:30] a rich knowledge in the things of the
[28:31] message brother Branham says in a number
[28:34] of different places the evidence the
[28:35] Holy Ghost is perfect love
[28:38] before 1963 right
[28:41] it says the greatest evidence I know of
[28:43] the greatest evidence of the Holy Ghost
[28:44] uh that I know of is when you can love
[28:46] one another
[28:48] so this is these are statements that
[28:50] brother Branham had things that he said
[28:51] even when we talked about that angel
[28:53] said this is what you preach perfect
[28:54] love is and so brother Branham had this
[28:57] he taught this the evidence of the Holy
[29:00] Ghost is perfect love
[29:01] couldn't think of a greater evidence
[29:02] than when you love one another he's like
[29:04] yeah that makes sense
[29:06] now in the sermon broken cisterns
[29:09] broken cisterns not sisters broken
[29:12] cisterns God we have Brethren and
[29:14] cistern but what would you think would
[29:16] be another she's talking about with
[29:17] brotherly Ville what would you think to
[29:19] be on evidence and I said the most
[29:20] perfect evidence I can think of is love
[29:23] and so we got to talking on that
[29:25] and then I thought that sounded pretty
[29:28] good so I just held that if a man has
[29:30] got love but one day the Lord in a
[29:34] vision straightened me out
[29:37] now now I I'm not going to try to just
[29:39] the cabbage down on the language he's
[29:41] using but he says he straightened him
[29:43] out
[29:44] so it's kind of it's smoothing something
[29:46] out making something plainer and he said
[29:48] that the evidence of the spirit was
[29:50] those who could receive the word neither
[29:53] love nor speaking in tongues but it's
[29:55] receiving the word
[29:57] so when we look at it from the love down
[29:59] here I would say he was absolutely wrong
[30:02] he said well the evidence of the Holy
[30:04] Ghost is when you could just love one
[30:05] another and get along with one another
[30:06] and I say absolutely wrong he he needed
[30:09] to be straightened out because he says
[30:10] it's not it's neither love nor speaking
[30:12] in tongues but it's receiving the word
[30:13] so in one sense if you're saying oh well
[30:16] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when
[30:18] we can just be kind to each other we can
[30:20] manifest attributes of love he said the
[30:22] Holy Spirit straightens them out because
[30:23] in that way
[30:24] I I want to say that the Holy Spirit
[30:26] straightened him out it's not love so we
[30:28] say well it sounds like he's wrong
[30:30] and this is where please help me preach
[30:32] tonight
[30:32] and and you you just help me to say just
[30:36] exactly in a way that's pleasing to the
[30:37] Lord but and God help me to say it I
[30:39] want to say he wasn't totally wrong
[30:42] because he's saying that they the Lord
[30:45] straightened me out so it maybe wasn't
[30:48] that he was going in the wrong direction
[30:49] but the Lord just kind of narrows it
[30:51] down a little bit says you're looking in
[30:53] the right way but you need to focus this
[30:54] a little bit more because the evidence
[30:56] of the spirit is those who can receive
[30:58] the word
[30:59] so the truth was laying there but not in
[31:02] a humanistic love but in the love from
[31:04] above
[31:06] because the love perfect love is the
[31:08] word
[31:09] perfect love is to do the will of God
[31:11] that's what perfect love is so when he
[31:14] takes this if I could say this way the
[31:16] way that it has struck me so I'm just
[31:18] sharing this as it strikes me and I just
[31:20] thank God that I have the Liberty to do
[31:22] it and God will deal with your heart
[31:24] but it's as if he sees something in love
[31:27] and he's drawn to it
[31:29] he sees something uh that there's
[31:31] something pure about love and there's
[31:33] something about the love of God and
[31:34] there's something about the nature of
[31:36] God but he then he realizes but there's
[31:39] certain traits or attributes it's not
[31:42] the fruit of the spirit necessarily it
[31:43] can be impersonated but it's the fruits
[31:45] won't we chop them up and divide them
[31:47] from the life that any of one of those
[31:49] can be manifested in a way that's an
[31:50] impersonation but he's looking at this
[31:52] says oh a human love it can be love can
[31:55] be humanized any one of these traits can
[31:57] be humanized maybe we'll take time to
[32:00] look at how each one of these traits not
[32:01] only has maybe an insincere
[32:03] impersonation from a humanistic
[32:05] standpoint but it's got a humanistic
[32:06] opposite
[32:08] right whether behave or jealousy or
[32:10] those different things
[32:12] but he sees something in love but
[32:16] love the this love or this evidence
[32:19] couldn't be these traits that could be
[32:20] impersonated
[32:22] and so if we say that the evidence of
[32:24] the Holy Ghost is perfect love
[32:27] then that sounds more that sounds
[32:29] better right
[32:31] he says well the evidence of the Holy
[32:33] Ghost is who can one who could receive
[32:35] the word and I say the evidence of the
[32:37] Holy Ghost is perfect love manifesting
[32:40] itself through you
[32:41] then you realize well this is how when
[32:43] brother bam says the evidence the Holy
[32:44] Ghost is love and he says no I need to
[32:46] straighten you out the Holy Ghost and I
[32:48] and I realize now Sunday morning
[32:50] hopefully we'll add a lot more body to
[32:51] this that Holy Ghost the evidence when
[32:54] you can receive the word
[32:56] when you could say a man to the word
[32:57] when you can demonstrate the word when
[33:00] you can live the word and you're only
[33:01] going to do that by love for the word
[33:04] and so brother Brandon it's not that
[33:06] he's completely way out in left field
[33:08] and when the Holy Spirit comes and
[33:10] straightens them out it's not that he
[33:11] can it's a complete shift to where there
[33:13] was nothing to it but it's as if the
[33:14] Lord turned it over
[33:16] and now describes it in a way that gets
[33:18] rid of the confusion of impersonating
[33:20] this and impersonating that it says the
[33:22] real heart of the matter is when you do
[33:24] God's will
[33:26] in the sermon question and answer is
[33:28] part two
[33:29] and that wonderful summer of 64. he's
[33:31] talking about dancing and emotion he
[33:33] said that's no evidence of the Holy
[33:34] Ghost you can't rely on that you can't
[33:37] rely on the fruit of the spirit because
[33:39] the first fruit of the spirit is love
[33:41] and the Christian Science exercise more
[33:43] love than anybody I know of and they
[33:45] even deny Jesus Christ being divine
[33:48] he said there's only one evidence the
[33:49] holy spirit that I know of and that's a
[33:51] genuine faith and the promised word of
[33:53] the hour
[33:55] and you can't have faith unless you have
[33:57] love
[33:59] so he's saying there's only one evidence
[34:00] in the holy spirit that I know of and
[34:02] that is a genuine faith and the promised
[34:04] word of God this is a love not just to
[34:07] one another but a love to God first
[34:10] you can have fruits of the spirit but
[34:12] not have the spirit
[34:14] you can have those humanistic
[34:16] impersonations
[34:17] but we know the spirit itself
[34:21] the spirit itself cannot be embodied
[34:24] falsely or the spirit itself cannot be
[34:26] impersonated
[34:29] that you you're able to replicate its
[34:32] actual life you're able to replicate its
[34:34] true nature you can only mimic the
[34:36] attributes and the traits
[34:39] you cannot I guess the way I'd want to
[34:41] say is you can't impersonate the spirit
[34:42] you can only imagine you can only
[34:43] impersonate the manifestation or the
[34:45] gifts
[34:47] and and as a matter of fact you can
[34:49] impersonate
[34:51] uh you can impersonate something you
[34:53] don't have but if you have it you just
[34:54] demonstrate it
[34:56] there's a difference between the
[34:57] impersonation of what you see and that's
[34:59] what makes a good impersonation is
[35:00] people just you hyper focus on a certain
[35:03] inflection or certain characteristic and
[35:06] all you have to do is just emphasize
[35:07] what you see and what you hear and you
[35:09] can get you can impersonate something
[35:11] but if you have the life you just
[35:13] demonstrated
[35:16] in the sermon what shall we do brother
[35:18] Ben said the evidence as I said the
[35:19] other day we tried to place evidence
[35:20] Luther said believe and walked out the
[35:22] devil believes to Wesley said shout and
[35:25] you got it but he found out he didn't
[35:26] Pentecost said speak in tongues and you
[35:28] got it they didn't Christian Science
[35:30] says love you got the fruit of the
[35:32] spirit but they haven't they denied the
[35:34] Divinity of Jesus Christ
[35:35] what is the evidence of it when that
[35:37] Spirit that's in you can punctuate every
[35:39] promise with an amen
[35:42] and God will confirm it
[35:44] amen that's exactly the way it was with
[35:46] Jesus Christ that kind of brings us
[35:48] almost back full circle as we get some
[35:50] closing here oh yes they had more fruits
[35:55] of the spirit they had all kinds of
[35:57] evidences
[35:58] you can't pin any evidence down to
[36:01] anything but God himself manifesting his
[36:05] word
[36:07] that's it
[36:08] that's the only evidence there is is God
[36:11] manifesting his word that's the only
[36:13] true evidence that there is is that
[36:14] you're a Christian how can you be a
[36:16] Christian when in the beginning was the
[36:18] word and the Word was with God and the
[36:20] Word was God
[36:22] how else can you be a Christian unless
[36:24] it comes back to the the core of
[36:26] everything the root of everything Christ
[36:28] who is the word
[36:31] oh if you love you've got the fruit of
[36:33] the spirit you speak in tongues you got
[36:34] the fruit of the spirit if you just
[36:35] believe you got for the spirit shout you
[36:36] got the holy the for the spirit but he's
[36:38] saying that when the spirit that's in
[36:40] you the spirit says amen when these
[36:43] Spirit that's in you can punctuate every
[36:44] promise with an amen and God will
[36:47] confirm it
[36:48] that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[36:51] the evidence of Holy Ghost is when you
[36:52] could receive the word not some system
[36:54] but have a clear understanding he says
[36:56] in the church age book that that's the
[36:58] evidence of those who have the Holy
[36:59] Ghost could receive the word for their
[37:01] age that's that's what you're looking at
[37:03] to know whether or not you have the Holy
[37:05] Spirit is that you could say Amen to the
[37:06] word of God you can receive the word of
[37:08] God and and not just in receiving it but
[37:11] in receiving it welcoming and receiving
[37:13] the word you become the word so the real
[37:16] truth of whether or not you received it
[37:17] is when that word lives for you that's
[37:19] why I can say perfect love the evidence
[37:22] of the Holy Ghost is perfect love living
[37:24] itself through you amen
[37:26] the word made flesh in you
[37:29] you can't pin the evidence on anything
[37:31] down other than God manifest in his word
[37:35] now let's just be honest that's a real
[37:36] safe way of saying it isn't it
[37:39] because we haven't gone to any links to
[37:41] Define what that word is we haven't
[37:43] tried to go to any links to say what
[37:44] that might look like except maybe we've
[37:45] preached on how does love look but what
[37:48] I think it does I'm hoping and what I
[37:50] wanted to accomplish in this
[37:51] is to point to the impersonations point
[37:55] to the false
[37:57] point to the carnal impersonations the
[37:59] humanistic experiences and all these
[38:02] ways that love or the spirit can be
[38:06] manifested in just being kind and being
[38:08] sweet and being accommodating and being
[38:10] inclusive and the whole attitude that
[38:12] people might have on that way and say
[38:14] well there's just a certain way you want
[38:15] to be sensitive and you don't want to
[38:16] offend and and it tries to force an
[38:18] image of love that when it works against
[38:20] they say oh that can't be God because
[38:22] God is love that can't be God
[38:24] but you have to look at what does the
[38:26] word say
[38:28] the word's not asking you to by force
[38:30] injure your neighbor but the word might
[38:32] ask you to do something that makes a
[38:33] stand that your neighbor might not like
[38:36] and that's more love than it would be to
[38:38] compromise
[38:39] can you just a ponder that for the next
[38:41] few days that we might there's ways that
[38:44] human love tries to manifest itself and
[38:46] one sure measuring stick of whether or
[38:47] not you're loving your children whether
[38:49] or not you're loving your spouse whether
[38:50] or not you're loving one another is in
[38:52] doing this do I compromise myself or do
[38:54] I make it easier for them to compromise
[38:56] and if so ask yourself is that really
[38:58] perfect love
[39:00] when I make it easier for someone to
[39:02] compromise the word of God when myself
[39:03] I'm compromising the word of God how can
[39:06] that be perfect love when the evidence
[39:08] of the Holy Ghost which is perfect love
[39:10] is God manifesting his word
[39:15] and our final statement here we'll go
[39:17] ahead and invite the musicians to come
[39:18] just trying to break some record by
[39:21] calling them up this early
[39:23] and the sermon souls in prison now
[39:25] brother Adams
[39:27] he's hearkening back to how people say
[39:29] oh Hallelujah bless God there were so
[39:30] many people that got saved last night
[39:32] and said oh they did and they said they
[39:34] danced in the spirit they spoke in
[39:35] tongues Barbara says that don't mean one
[39:37] thing
[39:38] and then he begins to identify a nature
[39:40] that someone might have oh they're Meek
[39:42] and gentle and humble he says yes sir
[39:43] they got the fruit of the spirit he said
[39:45] that's no sign not a bit
[39:47] he says and we'll get there just a
[39:50] moment he says let me give you the fruit
[39:52] of the spirit between Jesus and the
[39:53] Pharisees see which one had the Fruit of
[39:55] the Spirit
[39:57] and he's specifically referring to
[39:58] Christ
[39:59] braiding a rope driving out the oxen and
[40:02] the Sheep telling the dove lovers to
[40:04] leave tell flipping over the tables
[40:06] scattering money everywhere and saying
[40:07] you've made my God's house a den of
[40:09] Thieves
[40:10] and the Bible says that this is Brother
[40:12] Where I'm saying that they said oh
[40:13] there's no fruit of the spirit there's
[40:15] no fruit of the spirit there
[40:17] brother bam says not by the fruit of the
[40:19] spirit
[40:20] Christian Science can outsmother
[40:22] interview on that
[40:24] and deny even Jesus Christ was defined
[40:26] Divine not that now can we recognize the
[40:33] um I don't want to say tightrope but
[40:34] just how
[40:35] uh
[40:36] the language he's using you really need
[40:38] to catch the thought
[40:40] because he's not saying if the it's the
[40:43] fruit of the spirit as an evidence that
[40:45] you have the life
[40:47] because what's the what's the evidence
[40:48] that a tree is an apple tree
[40:50] [Music]
[40:51] when it Bears apples
[40:53] so he's looking at it and not saying
[40:57] that they're somehow uh they have the
[41:00] light they have a fabricated Spirit he's
[41:03] just saying there are certain things
[41:04] that can manifest outwardly
[41:07] that to human perception this looks like
[41:10] the genuine article they must have the
[41:12] Holy Spirit what was that brother
[41:13] Branham realized when he tells us he
[41:15] teaches that incredible sermon on
[41:17] anointed ones at the end time
[41:19] genuine anointing
[41:21] false seed so it may be the genuine
[41:25] Spirit that's manifesting something but
[41:27] it's no proof of the possession of it
[41:30] maybe the genuine spirit that can
[41:31] manifest itself in these gifts and these
[41:33] operations it can also be in person
[41:34] anybody's saying that's no Vindication
[41:36] because you have to bring it back to the
[41:38] word because the Holy Spirit cannot deny
[41:41] the word
[41:43] so when he's talking about the fruit of
[41:44] the spirit he says this is in its truth
[41:46] and it's Purity but it's the word living
[41:49] there it is
[41:51] if they'd only looked he was a messiah
[41:53] he was the Living Word made manifest
[41:55] well it's the very love and revelation
[41:58] of God to the predestinated series The
[42:00] Very heart of God
[42:01] says in a man that's got the spirit in
[42:02] him or a woman lives that word lives
[42:04] right out in them and then I love this
[42:06] phrase that's the heartbeat
[42:09] the predestinated
[42:11] if I could phrase it this way that's the
[42:13] heartbeat of the predestinated heartbeat
[42:15] why because this is the love this is the
[42:17] true love affair for the word of the
[42:19] Lord comes to them and they are the word
[42:21] they are the word to the people written
[42:24] Epistles read of all men is that right
[42:25] and I left this one in there because
[42:27] this is the real to me the real uh nail
[42:29] in it could the third pool be on
[42:33] because the words got to be expressed
[42:34] some way
[42:35] the open of the word the open of these
[42:37] seals the revelation of Jesus Christ the
[42:38] very Heart Of God it's got to be made
[42:40] manifest somehow how is it going to
[42:42] happen is it going to be us trying to
[42:43] impersonate the attributes or traits of
[42:46] Love or traits of the spirit are we
[42:48] going to be possessed by the revelation
[42:50] of Jesus Christ when that which is
[42:51] perfect has come now here we are under
[42:53] the headship of the Capstone he is
[42:55] governing the bride from that vantage
[42:57] point and we realize that it's not just
[43:00] me having a love for my neighbors not
[43:02] just me demonstrating kindness but it's
[43:04] me standing true to the word of God it's
[43:07] me upholding the word of God it's me
[43:09] manifesting the word of God and say oh
[43:11] God don't give me a judgmental Spirit
[43:13] Lord don't make me critical don't make
[43:15] me harsh Lord but don't make me
[43:16] compromising don't make me soft I don't
[43:18] want to be inclusive for inclusives and
[43:20] his sake I don't want to be
[43:21] accommodating for a commenting say the
[43:23] Lord I want your word to be made
[43:25] manifest in me because that's my
[43:27] heartbeat
[43:30] and then I become a written epistle red
[43:32] of all men
[43:33] how are all men going to read it
[43:36] when love lives in a human in a human
[43:39] way or through a human
[43:42] when perfect love is manifested in flesh
[43:44] that's how they can read it
[43:46] and says red of all men
[43:48] this love this this word has to be
[43:50] translated to Faith in The Believer
[43:54] we need to live it out
[43:56] but carry this in your hearts as I as I
[43:58] close this
[43:59] tonight
[44:02] to love God is to do his will
[44:06] that loves evidence
[44:08] is keeping God's word
[44:10] I prove my love to him we'll pick up on
[44:12] this Sunday morning I prove my love to
[44:13] him by doing what he says
[44:17] and love is manifested to others when I
[44:20] do my part to be that written epistle
[44:22] not what I think love is not what I
[44:25] think it should look like not what I'm
[44:27] feeling in the moment oh man I really
[44:29] feel sorry for him and I I and maybe I
[44:32] need to do this when the word of God
[44:33] says stay true to the word
[44:36] stay true to the word
[44:38] that's the heartbeat
[44:41] that's the predestiness that you are the
[44:43] heartbeat of the word
[44:45] because the word Lord comes to you and
[44:46] then you become the word to the people a
[44:48] written epistle could the third pull be
[44:50] on I think we have a resounding amen
[44:53] resounding amen by the life that we live
[44:56] the third pool is on because it's proven
[44:58] itself in the life that I live before
[45:00] the people I want to be I want to be the
[45:02] love of God
[45:03] I don't want to be an impersonation of
[45:05] it I want to be it
[45:07] the best thing I can do for my my spouse
[45:09] the best thing I can do for my children
[45:11] the best thing I can do for my brothers
[45:12] and sisters the best thing I could do is
[45:14] live the word of God and not compromise
[45:17] the word of God
[45:18] so many pressures these days they're so
[45:20] there's the threat of political uh
[45:22] violence there's the threat of being
[45:24] canceled there's a threat of going viral
[45:26] there's all sorts of threats but listen
[45:27] I believe that we're safe in God's
[45:29] Pavilion when we fulfill his word it's
[45:32] the people who've taken love and made it
[45:34] something it's not they've taken Zeal
[45:36] and made it something it's not that's
[45:37] when you run the danger of being out on
[45:39] a limb but if you could stay within the
[45:41] confines of God's word he'll fight your
[45:43] battles doesn't mean you won't hurt
[45:45] don't mean it doesn't mean you won't
[45:46] suffer it doesn't mean you won't lose
[45:47] friends doesn't mean you won't offend
[45:49] but your safety isn't keeping God's word
[45:53] loves evidence
[45:56] brother Branham said the evidence of the
[45:58] Holy Ghost is love
[46:00] he was looking at something
[46:03] and the Holy Spirit said love is to do
[46:05] the will of God
[46:07] right love is to do the will of God so
[46:10] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when
[46:11] you can receive the word and God confirm
[46:13] it
[46:15] that's Love's evidence I hope it's
[46:17] helpful tonight
[46:18] could you stand with me
