[0:00] Galatians chapter 3 we'll start with
[0:02] verse one we'll read to verse 11 oh
[0:04] foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you
[0:06] that you should not obey the truth
[0:09] before whose eyes Jesus Christ ha been
[0:11] evidently set forth crucified among you
[0:13] this only would I learn of you received
[0:16] ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or
[0:18] by the hearing of Faith are ye so
[0:20] foolish having begun in the spirit are
[0:22] you now made perfect by the flesh have
[0:24] you suffered so many things in vain if
[0:26] it be yet in vain he therefore that min
[0:30] to you the spirit and worketh miracles
[0:33] among you doeth he by The Works of the
[0:35] law or by the hearing of Faith even as
[0:37] Abraham believed God and it was
[0:39] accounted to him of righteousness know
[0:41] ye therefore that they which are of
[0:42] Faith the same are the children of
[0:44] Abraham and the scripture foreseeing
[0:46] that God would justify the Heathen
[0:48] through faith preached before the gospel
[0:50] unto Abraham saying in thee shall All
[0:52] Nations be blessed so then they which be
[0:54] of Faith are blessed with faithful
[0:56] Abraham for as many as are of the works
[0:58] of the law are under the curse for it is
[1:00] written cursed is everyone that
[1:01] continueth not in all things which are
[1:04] written in the book of the law to do
[1:05] them but that no man is justified by the
[1:07] law in the sight of God it is evident
[1:09] for the just shall live by faith amen
[1:13] you can be
[1:15] seated just jump right back into the
[1:17] subject we're ministering on Sunday on
[1:20] is there room for mercy and I kind of I
[1:24] had to stop just right in the middle of
[1:25] it so I'm just going to try to find a
[1:27] way to get right back to where we were
[1:29] um
[1:30] in the morning service and continue this
[1:32] morning but Mercy is from the root word
[1:35] to be good uh to be kind and so Mercy is
[1:38] goodness kindness or faithfulness and
[1:41] that's really at the heart when we say
[1:43] is there room for Mercy we really are
[1:45] looking at all those different aspects
[1:47] but if you look at Psalms 103: 13 and 14
[1:51] just take a few moments to review a few
[1:53] principles from Sunday says like as a
[1:55] father pth his children so the Lord pth
[1:58] them that fear Him and that pth in the
[2:00] Hebrews to love deeply to be
[2:02] compassionate to have tender affection
[2:05] it means to have mercy if you have love
[2:07] and compassion and tender affection
[2:09] there's that kindness that goodness that
[2:12] faithfulness to one so we know that love
[2:14] and faith are relations so this as a
[2:16] father pies his children the Lord pies
[2:18] them that fear Him and this scripture
[2:20] even later refers to the mercy of the
[2:22] Lord so it's bound up in this pity and
[2:25] then in verse 14 it says for he knoweth
[2:27] our frame he remember that we are dust
[2:31] and this pity that he has for them that
[2:33] fear Him is connected with this
[2:34] knowledge and wisdom and understanding
[2:36] that he has about us and our weaknesses
[2:38] and our shortcomings and I would say
[2:40] even our desires and our hopes and so
[2:42] Mercy relates to knowledge it relates to
[2:45] having wisdom or the true understanding
[2:48] of things when you look at someone and
[2:50] you see them for what they are you can
[2:52] pity them and I know sometimes we think
[2:54] of way oh what a Pity what a Pity but
[2:56] this Mercy or this to be pitiful towards
[2:58] someone or to pity someone is kind of
[3:01] rooted in knowing where they're at and
[3:03] what they're going through and what
[3:04] they've experienced and so he knoweth
[3:06] our frame he remembers that we are dust
[3:09] and so therefore based upon the
[3:10] knowledge of where we are he has this
[3:12] Mercy or this pity now in Hosea chapter
[3:16] 6: 6 to 7 we were using this to kind to
[3:19] link together uh the subject we were on
[3:21] when the youngans don't grow up and how
[3:23] that uh though we may be born when we're
[3:26] born again by this experience with the
[3:28] Holy Ghost uh there's a certain
[3:30] enthusiasm there's a moving and work of
[3:31] the holy spirit in our lives and some
[3:33] people can be natured a certain way as
[3:35] we saw in the word of God to where
[3:37] they're more prone to certain
[3:38] expressions and certain ways of worship
[3:41] but at the end of the day what is most
[3:43] important is that you continue in the
[3:44] word of God and you grow and you mature
[3:47] in the word and it says in verses 6 and
[3:49] 7 for I desired mercy and not sacrifice
[3:53] and the knowledge of God more than burnt
[3:55] offerings but they like men have
[3:57] transgressed the Covenant there have
[3:59] they dealt treacherously against me so
[4:02] in dealing treacherously against God uh
[4:05] they have not uh they have not shown him
[4:07] Mercy or kindness or goodness they have
[4:09] not been faithful to him and he says I
[4:12] desired Mercy not sacrifice I I desired
[4:15] that there' be the knowledge of God more
[4:17] than burnt offerings that's quite a
[4:19] statement especially given the amount of
[4:21] time that God put into establishing the
[4:23] order of worship and sacrifices and
[4:25] offerings and the Tabernacle in the
[4:27] wilderness and the Temple of the Lord uh
[4:29] but yet here here God is saying at the
[4:30] end of the day I wasn't just trying to
[4:32] create ceremony I just wasn't wanting to
[4:34] create tradition but I wanted to
[4:36] manifest mercy and kindness and goodness
[4:39] and the knowledge of me the knowledge of
[4:41] the Holy and in the house of the Lord as
[4:43] we just kind of reference this very
[4:45] quickly on Sunday offerings and
[4:47] sacrifices are what dominated the outer
[4:50] court and the inner court and the holy
[4:53] place you have the outer Court the inner
[4:54] Court which is sometimes called the holy
[4:56] place in the outer Court you had the
[4:58] Brazen altar you had the Laver
[5:00] and you had different activities at
[5:01] these at these stations and then you had
[5:04] in the inner Court incense and the lamps
[5:06] and the table of showbread and in there
[5:09] we see that there's the light uh uh
[5:11] there's light from natural light then
[5:13] there's the light of man as you light
[5:14] these lampstands and there's a lot of
[5:15] different language that even brother
[5:17] brandom uses and in this layout of the
[5:20] Tabernacle in the wilderness and even
[5:21] Solomon's Temple you can see the body is
[5:23] expressed where you have the Flesh and
[5:26] the spirit representing those two courts
[5:28] and and in the outer Court you have the
[5:31] natural light and the inner Court you
[5:33] have man-made lights you see the
[5:34] man-made you see the influence of
[5:36] man-made elements and man-made things
[5:38] and natural things but then after the
[5:40] outer Court the inner Court of that Holy
[5:42] place you come into the most holy place
[5:45] you come into the holiest of holies and
[5:47] it held only the ark and the Ark itself
[5:50] was one thing that would include the
[5:52] actual Ark that contained the the law
[5:54] but then also The Mercy Seat which is
[5:56] then attached to it forever becomes a
[5:58] part of it and so that Most Holy Place
[6:01] only held the ark which is truth and
[6:03] mercy and that place represents the soul
[6:06] of man the meeting place the place where
[6:08] God wants to dwell the place that God
[6:10] finds rest so these two uh courts the
[6:13] outer and inner Court The Works of man
[6:15] dominate in there but God's presence
[6:18] dwelt in the Shak Glory dwelt between
[6:21] those choms that was his dwelling place
[6:24] now as we have been studying myself
[6:26] personally and we tried to emphasize a
[6:28] number of things in that stre report
[6:29] series from
[6:30] 1965 I like to I'm drawing a lot of
[6:33] inspiration or there's a deep connection
[6:35] to works as Faith
[6:36] expressed and and so as I go together in
[6:39] this today I I'd like for you hopefully
[6:42] some of you to be drawing from what
[6:44] you've learned and what you've been
[6:45] taught in that sermon as the prophet
[6:47] lays out just a beautiful uh teaching on
[6:49] works as Faith expressed and he
[6:51] addresses how that he's addressing
[6:53] emotions and gifts and Pentecostalism
[6:56] and those things in that series and he's
[6:57] showing how that the word there's a word
[6:59] work that we're doing in this end time
[7:02] and it's according to a seed and there's
[7:03] certain impersonations but there are
[7:05] things that Satan cannot impersonate
[7:07] that's a real uh deep principle in that
[7:09] or an obvious principle in that sermon
[7:12] and as we go further we used Galatians
[7:15] chapter 3 so if you don't just look at
[7:17] that right now this will help us move
[7:19] down a little bit in Galatians chap 3: 1
[7:21] to4 the the correction by Paul of the
[7:25] galatian church is an appeal to grow up
[7:27] he's really he's not taking away their
[7:29] experience he's saying you are you have
[7:31] received the spirit and you are seed and
[7:33] you are children of God but he's really
[7:35] challenging them to grow up and he's
[7:37] using the truth but also mercy and he
[7:40] says oh foolish Galatians and he calls
[7:42] them foolish they had not properly
[7:44] developed they have not grown up and
[7:46] because they have not grown up they're
[7:48] so easily Charmed or influenced oh
[7:50] foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you
[7:53] that you should not obey the truth
[7:55] before whose eyes Jesus Christ had
[7:56] evidently been evidently set forth
[7:58] crucified among you this only would I
[8:00] learn of you received you the Spirit by
[8:03] The Works of the law or by the hearing
[8:04] of Faith are ye so foolish again he's
[8:07] he's wanting to bring them back to this
[8:09] this immaturity and this susceptibility
[8:12] to the wrong kind of influence having
[8:14] begun in the spirit are you now made
[8:16] perfect by the flesh so he's not taking
[8:18] their experience away from them he's
[8:20] just saying you're not developing or
[8:22] going forward in your experience
[8:23] properly because somebody is enticing
[8:26] you and seducing you to leave the prin
[8:29] principle of the word of God working
[8:30] inside of you and wanting to do
[8:32] something outwardly to appease the Lord
[8:35] and so he says have you suffered so many
[8:37] things in vain if it be yet in vain
[8:40] suffering is that process of character
[8:41] development and so this is something uh
[8:44] that Paul is advocating for them to grow
[8:46] and to grow up and to mature and he
[8:48] asked this question in verse two and he
[8:51] could say it this way did you receive
[8:52] the Spirit by performing The Works of
[8:55] the law or did you receive it as a seal
[8:57] of your faith how did you re received
[8:59] the Spirit by keeping the law and doing
[9:01] what the law demanded of you or is it
[9:03] something that you received by faith and
[9:07] because they had forgotten this
[9:08] principle or because they weren't in
[9:10] tune to the real work of God in their
[9:12] hearts they were not walking in the
[9:14] spirit as you go forward and reading the
[9:16] rest of it you'll see that they're not
[9:17] obeying the truth and they're not really
[9:19] manifesting the real fruit of that
[9:21] experience that they had had in
[9:23] Galatians 5: 6 to8 it says for in Jesus
[9:27] Christ neither circumcision availeth
[9:29] anything nor uncircumcision they were
[9:31] being called back tradition they were to
[9:32] tradition they were being called back to
[9:34] works of the flesh but the only thing
[9:36] that avails is Faith which worketh by
[9:38] love he says you did run well so they
[9:41] had obviously been doing some good
[9:43] things he says who did hinder you that
[9:44] you should not obey the truth this
[9:47] persuasion this bewitching this
[9:49] influence cometh not of him that calleth
[9:51] you and so we could say they were
[9:53] manifesting some Works they had run well
[9:55] they had made some progress but
[9:57] something is missing and no doubt the
[9:59] Galatians would be able to say well we
[10:01] did this and we did that and these
[10:02] things have happened and these things
[10:04] have transpired and yet Paul is wanting
[10:06] to say he's not want to say well you
[10:07] ain't been nowhere to begin with he's
[10:08] saying you began well you've ran well
[10:10] you started in the spirit but having
[10:12] begun in the spirit you're not going to
[10:14] perfect yourself through fleshly Works
[10:16] you've got to stay connected with that
[10:18] faith and the word of God which birth
[10:20] you because that's what's going to bring
[10:22] out the real fruit of the spirit not the
[10:23] works of the flesh or the works of the
[10:25] law but the real work of God and the man
[10:28] as we mentioned in Matthew 7:22 many
[10:30] will come before the Lord on that day
[10:32] and say have we not prophesied in thy
[10:35] name and in thy name cast out devils and
[10:37] in thy name done many wonderful Works
[10:40] yet Jesus said these works are
[10:42] associated with iniquity says ye that
[10:44] work iniquity and we could I don't think
[10:47] it would be wrong to think of maybe
[10:49] other things that they were doing that
[10:51] amounted to iniquity but even in all
[10:54] these Works they're doing they missed
[10:55] the mark it wasn't done in the manner
[10:58] that God had desired them to it wasn't
[11:00] meeting the mark of what God wanted so
[11:02] how are these Works iniquity in
[11:04] Galatians 3: 5 to 7 notice how Paul
[11:08] addresses this he therefore that
[11:09] ministereth to you the spirit and
[11:11] worketh miracles among you now this is a
[11:15] great challenge the one that ministers
[11:18] to you the spirit even the one that
[11:19] would Minister the word the word and
[11:21] Spirit uh working together and it says
[11:23] and works miracles among you it's good
[11:24] to ask ourselves doeth he by The Works
[11:27] of the law or by the hearing of faith
[11:29] Fai what is it is it is it in the flesh
[11:32] is it in the man is it in the supposed
[11:35] gift what what is it in how does it
[11:37] operate what makes these things Works he
[11:39] says or by the hearing of faith and we
[11:43] know that the question in the sense that
[11:44] it's rhetorical saying it's not by The
[11:47] Works of the law that one would manifest
[11:48] a miracle but it's by the hearing of
[11:50] Faith even as Abraham believed God and
[11:53] it was accounted to him for
[11:54] righteousness know ye therefore that
[11:56] they which are of Faith are the the same
[11:58] are the the children of Abraham so faith
[12:01] is receiving that's what faith is Faith
[12:04] is receiving not working and therefore
[12:07] as the principle of the seed is that
[12:09] Faith working and we are the Seed of
[12:10] Abraham then as Faith Works in US it
[12:13] works its way out it works its way
[12:15] according to the law of the Harvest the
[12:17] law of the seed so faith is at its core
[12:20] receiving and it's not something we work
[12:22] ourselves towards in Romans 10: 16 and
[12:26] 17 but they have not all obeyed the
[12:28] gospel El for as I Isaiah said Lord who
[12:31] hath believed our report so then Faith
[12:34] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[12:36] word of God so it says you did run well
[12:39] who did hinder you that you should not
[12:40] obey the truth where was the problem
[12:42] they were getting more in the outward
[12:44] elements and the inner court and the
[12:46] outer court and they were more dwelling
[12:47] in these other Realms and not staying
[12:50] connected to the presence of God down on
[12:52] the inside which is to grow your faith
[12:55] by the word and so he said who did
[12:58] hinder you that you did not obey the
[13:00] truth that you did not further obey the
[13:02] truth because having begun in the spirit
[13:05] you're not made perfect by the flesh so
[13:07] it's their own flesh that's hindering
[13:08] them and if they had not obeyed the
[13:10] gospel it's because their faith is not
[13:13] being mixed with the word that they've
[13:14] heard faith comes by hearing hearing by
[13:17] the word of God now without getting into
[13:20] much of a lesson on the galatian church
[13:22] we know that they were flirting with
[13:23] going back to the law and they were uh
[13:26] mixing in Traditions and they were
[13:28] elevating the traditions of of men they
[13:29] were elevating the Flesh and in doing so
[13:31] they were forfeiting the Liberty that
[13:33] they had in Christ and it was kind of
[13:35] the the easy things to do the lwh
[13:36] hanging fruit where if I could just do
[13:38] this I'm all right if I could just do
[13:39] that it's all right it's something that
[13:41] I could do um the easy emotionalism or
[13:44] easy believism whatever they could do in
[13:46] the flesh to Plate themselves and so
[13:48] we're wanting to go back to the works of
[13:50] the law and Paul said you're forfeiting
[13:52] your Liberty it comes by hearing the
[13:55] word of God and that energizing your
[13:57] faith and the life lived by that word
[13:59] is what God is looking for Galatians 2:
[14:03] 16 knowing that a man is not justified
[14:05] by The Works of the law but by the faith
[14:08] of Jesus Christ even we have believed in
[14:11] Jesus Christ that we might be justified
[14:13] by the Faith of Christ and not by The
[14:15] Works of the law for by The Works of the
[14:17] law shall no flesh be justified a man is
[14:21] not justified by The Works of the law
[14:22] but he's justified by the faith of Jesus
[14:25] Christ this is Paul's battle with them
[14:28] the the the lusting of the Flesh and the
[14:30] pride of life and those things of
[14:31] drawing them away whether it be in a
[14:33] carnal way or in a a nominal uh
[14:35] religious way he saiding it's by faith
[14:38] in Jesus Christ not the works of the law
[14:40] that's not what justifies us so in verse
[14:43] 10 of chapter 3 in verse 11 for as many
[14:46] as are of the works of the law are under
[14:48] the curse for it is written cursed is
[14:50] everyone that continueth not in all
[14:51] things which are written in the book of
[14:53] the law to do them so you had to keep it
[14:55] perfectly or it condemns you he says but
[14:57] that no man is Justified by the law and
[14:59] the sight of God it is evident for the
[15:02] just shall live by faith tradition and
[15:06] error were being mixed into the gospel
[15:07] they're trying to bring things from
[15:09] their past experiences things from the
[15:11] law being mixed into the gospel is
[15:13] depriving them of their perfect Liberty
[15:16] and it was this deception by works
[15:18] because he's constantly calling out the
[15:19] works is it the works of the law is it
[15:21] the works of the flesh having begun the
[15:22] spirit are you going to make yourself
[15:24] perfect you're going to work your way to
[15:25] this you're going to work your way to
[15:26] your adoption you're going to work your
[15:28] way to the seal you're going to work
[15:29] your way to this and he's really calling
[15:31] out this human mindset to where they
[15:33] were being deceived by works whether it
[15:35] be emotional or intellectual he's saying
[15:37] you're both you're both in the ditch and
[15:40] you've got to come back to the real
[15:41] heart of the matter back to Faith by the
[15:43] word of God and so it's works that are
[15:46] really at issue here that he's dealing
[15:49] with but yet we know that works are or
[15:52] works is Faith expressed now it can't be
[15:55] works of the flesh or just works of the
[15:56] law but it's got to be the word working
[15:59] in US can't we we don't want to have
[16:01] this attitude well a tree devoid of
[16:03] fruit and a and a life devoid of the of
[16:06] the word of God and a life devoid of
[16:08] works is well it's just Faith by faith I
[16:10] believe and yet nothing's ever happening
[16:12] nothing's ever moving but the Temptation
[16:15] is to try to adopt a certain uh uh
[16:18] Paradigm of what it should look like and
[16:20] works that we should do and then you
[16:21] just make it tradition and then making
[16:23] it traditional and making it an ought to
[16:25] in those things it really robs the
[16:28] leadership of the Holy SP spirit in
[16:29] one's life to allow the word to manifest
[16:31] itself through so just as brother Bram
[16:33] addresses it and works as Faith
[16:35] expressed he says that in James that
[16:37] Abraham was justified by his works the
[16:40] vantage point where Abraham did in Works
[16:43] did in activity did in life manifest
[16:46] Faith through his works but God had
[16:49] already known by his faith in his heart
[16:51] he was justified by his faith and his
[16:53] heart and knew his heart was right so
[16:55] then God asked him to do something in
[16:57] Abraham's perfect faith and Abraham's
[17:00] Works bringing Faith expressed and
[17:02] bringing it to his Perfection was him
[17:04] obeying God and doing exactly what God
[17:07] said he should do without fear fear
[17:09] being cast out and so we have the same
[17:12] challenge in our lives to have Works
[17:14] which is Faith Express but not works
[17:17] just works of the flesh or works of the
[17:18] law Paul says it this way when writing
[17:21] Titus 3: 1
[17:23] to8 put them in mind to be subject to
[17:26] principalities and powers to obey
[17:28] Magistrate to be ready to every good
[17:30] work to speak evil of no man to be no
[17:33] Brawlers but gentle showing all meekness
[17:35] unto all men so he is advocating that
[17:38] there be works that we would be ready to
[17:41] every good work and that we would also
[17:44] likewise not have evil Works a work of
[17:46] the flesh that we would not speak evil
[17:48] we would not be Brawlers but we would be
[17:50] gentle showing all meekness unto all men
[17:53] this is how Christians ought to be for
[17:54] we ourselves also were sometimes foolish
[17:57] disobedient received serving diverse
[18:00] lust and Pleasures this is what we were
[18:02] subject to we're subject to the flesh
[18:03] living in Malice and envy hateful and
[18:05] hating one another these fruits should
[18:08] ought not to be so in a believer's life
[18:11] these are things that the Holy Spirit
[18:12] wants to address if they're in our
[18:13] spirit at all he's wanting to uh remove
[18:16] these things and and mellow us out in
[18:18] the flesh but after that the kindness
[18:21] and love of God this is his Mercy the
[18:24] kindness and love of God our savior
[18:25] toward man appeared not by works of
[18:28] righteous which we have done but
[18:30] according to his Mercy he saved us so if
[18:33] works are an issue it's not the works of
[18:35] righteousness that we did but the work
[18:37] of Mercy that saved us what is this work
[18:40] of Mercy by the washing of regeneration
[18:42] and renewing of the Holy Ghost we what
[18:45] one time were disobedient deceived
[18:48] serving diverse lust and Pleasures
[18:49] living in Malice and envy hateful hating
[18:51] one another but the kindness and love of
[18:53] God the mercy of God came and worked on
[18:56] us and changed us verse 6 which he shed
[18:59] on us abundantly through Jesus Christ
[19:01] Our Savior what was it that he shed upon
[19:02] us not just his blood but the kindness
[19:05] and love of God his
[19:07] Mercy that being justified by his grace
[19:10] we should be made hes this comes back
[19:12] into that idea of why are we growing up
[19:15] why do we go through trials why are we
[19:17] suffering to receive our inheritance
[19:20] made Hees according to the hope of
[19:21] eternal life this is a faithful saying
[19:24] and these things I will that thou affirm
[19:26] constantly that they which have believed
[19:28] in God might be careful to maintain good
[19:32] works these things are good and
[19:34] profitable unto men so you do have works
[19:38] of the flesh works of the law versus the
[19:41] fruit of the spirit or the works here
[19:43] where he's saying these good and
[19:44] profitable Works he's to maintain good
[19:46] works to be ready to every good work
[19:50] there is an absolute necessity of a life
[19:54] following the experience that one has
[19:56] with the word that is something that
[19:58] changes you and brother bam even
[19:59] identifies that at the most basic level
[20:02] one of the most remarkable things about
[20:04] A change is your desires change and if
[20:07] your desires change your actions change
[20:10] your Works change your ambition change
[20:12] changes and so there's a change that
[20:14] takes place and there's a way that the
[20:15] Holy Spirit manifest itself in the life
[20:18] of someone now we don't do that to
[20:20] create a we don't just create uh uh of
[20:24] an image and say I just want to strive
[20:26] um to wear this particular clothing or
[20:28] listen to this particular song or do
[20:30] this particular thing but it is a matter
[20:32] of yielding to the Holy Spirit and
[20:33] letting him work through us and then
[20:36] maybe in the best way is that we would
[20:37] have the fruit of the spirit in our
[20:39] lives that we would not uh be Brawlers
[20:41] and speak evil and be foolish and
[20:43] disobedient and deceived and giving into
[20:45] diverse lust and Pleasures but that we
[20:47] too would be enveloped with the kindness
[20:49] and love of God that we would be gentle
[20:51] showing meekness unto all men that we
[20:53] would be ready to every good work so
[20:56] there is a challenge to have the works
[20:58] of God G in our
[20:59] lives but it's the right kind of
[21:02] works
[21:04] now I'm maybe not just not sure if this
[21:08] is going to to you going to seem like it
[21:09] Blends together but this is right where
[21:10] we left off on uh Sunday morning and the
[21:15] sermon is this the sign of the ins sir
[21:17] brother Brand's talking about the
[21:18] different Mysteries that are going to be
[21:19] wrapped up at the end time and he refers
[21:21] to this one in particular The Mystery of
[21:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[21:26] sensation now this is a statement that
[21:30] put this way he doesn't he doesn't say
[21:32] it this way anywhere else it's the one
[21:34] place where he says it just like this
[21:36] the mystery the baptism ghost without
[21:37] sensation but the person of Christ
[21:40] performing in you the works the the same
[21:42] works that he did well that's quite a
[21:45] statement that one of these end time
[21:47] Mysteries that's uh revealed and that
[21:49] these Loose Ends that's tied up is the
[21:51] mystery of the baptism the Holy Ghost
[21:52] without sensation now we can look into
[21:55] the message of the hour up to especially
[21:57] up to this point and find that without
[21:59] sensation is a reference to I believe
[22:02] other teachings of his without physical
[22:04] evidence that one of the sensations he
[22:07] most often called out and he continues
[22:09] to do so after the seals is that the
[22:11] evidence of the Holy Ghost is not
[22:13] speaking in tongues shouting crying
[22:15] dancing and all those things is not the
[22:17] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[22:19] Ghost on one Soul he says one of the
[22:21] mysteries of this age is that you would
[22:23] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:25] without an without an absolute
[22:29] singular evidence of the Holy Ghost such
[22:32] as speaking in tongues blood coming out
[22:34] of your hands sweating passing out
[22:35] crying all those different things and he
[22:37] addresses it in many different ways so
[22:39] when he says the mystery of the baptism
[22:40] goes without sensation I believe it's
[22:43] important to take into mind everything
[22:45] he taught about the lack of sensation
[22:47] being an Evidence instead of making a
[22:50] doctrine that the evidence of the Holy
[22:51] Ghost is when is the baptism the ghost
[22:54] is without any knowledge any sensation
[22:57] without anything at all
[22:59] such if you look back in your life you
[23:00] know what that night that I got the Holy
[23:02] Ghost I wept like a baby H must not have
[23:05] got it because that wouldn't be right
[23:08] you can't you don't want to kind of take
[23:10] the inverse of this and say that the
[23:11] mystery of the Bap ghost is without
[23:13] sensation so that if I had any kind of
[23:15] sensation with it then I didn't get the
[23:17] Holy Ghost oh that I say that would be a
[23:18] perverting and that would be a misuse of
[23:21] this statement do do not believe that's
[23:23] what brother brandom is advocating for
[23:25] is this complete lack of emotion or
[23:28] ation from the Holy Ghost anybody who's
[23:31] been born again can
[23:32] testify uh that or not anybody but most
[23:35] who've been born again can testified
[23:36] that the movement of God in their lives
[23:38] creates some sort of
[23:39] stimulus now I'm glad that he just
[23:41] doesn't leave it at that and say the
[23:42] mystery of the baptism goes without
[23:44] sensation so it's just sterile it's
[23:45] without you know it's just well you just
[23:48] uh do you believe that you have it yeah
[23:49] I believe that I have it okay then you
[23:50] got it don't ever think about it again
[23:51] just move on when did you get it I have
[23:53] no idea well it doesn't matter you just
[23:55] think just believe that you got it and
[23:56] go on but he says but the person of
[23:58] Christ performing in you the same works
[24:00] that he did that's quite a statement and
[24:04] it's there to add to and to bring a much
[24:08] complet more complete picture of the
[24:10] mystery of the baptism ghost without
[24:11] sensation and the moment that I received
[24:13] the Holy Ghost I didn't have to speak in
[24:14] tongues it didn't have to shout it
[24:16] didn't have to dance it didn't have to
[24:17] cry because the Holy Ghost can move like
[24:18] that in a service and everybody do the
[24:20] same physical manifestation outwardly
[24:23] but that's not the baptism of the holy
[24:25] ghost in One Soul that is a genuine holy
[24:27] ghost moving on the outer court or the
[24:29] inner court but the real genuine seal of
[24:32] God in the soul is not backed up by an
[24:34] Evidence of shouting dancing speaking in
[24:36] tongues and all those different things
[24:37] he's saying that's the mystery of the
[24:38] baptism ghost without an Evidence or a
[24:41] sensation but the evidence is Christ
[24:44] performing his Works according to his
[24:46] word Christ the person in you doing the
[24:49] same works that he did Jesus says in
[24:52] John 14:12 verily verily I say to you he
[24:54] that believeth on me the works that I do
[24:56] shall he do also how do we received the
[24:58] Spirit by faith so the word he that
[25:02] believeth on me has passed already from
[25:05] death into life that by by the new birth
[25:07] with the indwelling the Holy Spirit he
[25:09] that believeth on me the works the
[25:11] baptism of goost says the Seal of your
[25:13] faith The Works that I do shall he do
[25:14] also he says and Greater Works than
[25:17] these shall he do because that go unto
[25:18] my father brother brand in the sermon
[25:21] Shalom he says doing it the way just the
[25:24] way he does it in this end time he's
[25:27] talking about the Shalom this light has
[25:28] come doing it just the way he does it in
[25:32] other words it's not just Lord I did I
[25:35] cast out devils in your name and I spoke
[25:37] in tongues I did many many wonderful
[25:38] works in your says depart from me ye
[25:40] that work iniquity that to do the works
[25:43] that he did the same works that he did
[25:46] is to do it according to the nature and
[25:47] characteristics of Christ not just the
[25:49] letter form you Remember The False Image
[25:52] on of Proverbs that uh spare the rod
[25:55] spoil the child is how we might
[25:56] summarize it beat him with the rod drop
[25:58] the devil out of them and so we think oh
[26:00] well then the image of the word is a a
[26:02] crying baby having just been freshly
[26:04] spanked say well I don't know that that
[26:07] doesn't really tell the full picture
[26:09] because the word is wanting to bring the
[26:11] Peaceable fruits of righteousness after
[26:14] the fact and correct behavior and fear
[26:16] of God and a love for his word so for
[26:18] just producing spanked babies it's a
[26:20] False Image say well the words being
[26:22] fulfilled well the word's being
[26:23] fulfilled just like brother bandam said
[26:25] when you try those people why the word
[26:27] and the word test what is their response
[26:29] well we get results don't we got a room
[26:31] full of spanking cried babies it's like
[26:34] well but what does it produce like it it
[26:37] produce a lot of crying babies no what
[26:40] is that spanking supposed to produce
[26:42] what is that move of God in people's
[26:43] heart supposed to produce what are the
[26:45] use of the offerings and sacrifices is
[26:47] to bring someone in ultimately to the
[26:50] most holy place to the to the to that
[26:53] Ark of mercy and
[26:56] truth brother brandom in the sermon the
[26:58] lamb and the dove it was believe it was
[26:59] brother wendle martin that shared this
[27:02] recently uh to a group of brothers that
[27:04] I'm in fellowship with he said you say
[27:06] brother brandom what is the way back to
[27:09] the oldfashioned meetings just become
[27:11] Lambs again that's all just get back to
[27:14] being sheep the dove hasn't gone very
[27:16] far he's just waiting a chance to get
[27:18] back there's the road back to isua
[27:20] Street there's the place back I mean
[27:22] just think about this image back to the
[27:25] isua street meetings again yeah woo
[27:29] right and he says look at what he
[27:31] says is to return to a lamb nature
[27:36] again
[27:37] man all of a sudden it's more Meek it's
[27:40] more LED it's more mild you think yeah
[27:44] we need to go back to isus the street
[27:45] again well to go back to
[27:47] that and how the power of God manifested
[27:50] in those services and how the move of
[27:52] God and the supernatural that was done
[27:54] and the things that they overcame and he
[27:57] says it's not because they worked
[27:58] themselves into it and they worked
[27:59] themselves into a frenzy but it was to
[28:01] return to a lamb nature again it's not
[28:05] in the physical it's not in the
[28:06] emotional it's not in the intellectual
[28:08] it's back to the nature of the Lamb
[28:10] again that's what the dove can lead is
[28:13] the nature of the Lamb you want to go
[28:15] back even this is Brother Bram correc in
[28:16] the attitude of P Pentecostalism that
[28:19] had become such a robust machine and had
[28:21] well oiled and worked in these certain
[28:23] ways and these certain Dynamics or these
[28:25] certain mechanics and he said you really
[28:27] want to have the power of God move again
[28:29] he had to correct the leot to seeing age
[28:31] and call him back to Pentecost because
[28:33] they'd completely perverted the meaning
[28:34] of
[28:35] Pentecost even when it came to tongues
[28:38] and those things he said when you speak
[28:39] in tongues and it's not interpreted he
[28:41] said that's back to vomit again that's
[28:42] back to Pentecost he said that's back to
[28:45] Babylon and so a real isua Street
[28:48] meeting is just to re be be a lamb
[28:51] again John chapter 6: 28 and 29 then
[28:54] said they unto him of course the context
[28:56] of this is very rich
[28:59] he' multiplied the bread and they're
[29:00] like whoa wow that's amazing so they
[29:02] wanted to find follow him and he said
[29:05] you are you seek me not because you saw
[29:07] the Miracles but because you want the
[29:09] bread it's your gut that wants it not
[29:11] your heart it's the flesh it's what it's
[29:13] what I do to the body and the mind in
[29:16] your in your spirit not your heart
[29:17] that's really moved and even when he
[29:20] rebukes them this is their response they
[29:23] said un him what shall we do that we
[29:24] might work the works of God Jesus
[29:27] answered and said to them this is the
[29:28] work of God now I'm sharing these things
[29:31] let me say it this way I'm sharing these
[29:32] things to so that you can
[29:34] see that the works of the Holy Spirit
[29:37] are the same works that Christ
[29:40] did and so then it it we we're we should
[29:45] be challenged then because if we're say
[29:48] all right it's the works that Christ did
[29:49] okay so then and we get our bucket list
[29:51] walk on water turn water into wine right
[29:54] heal a leper like where are we going to
[29:56] get a
[29:57] leper and and there's all these things
[29:59] that we start trying to do and we think
[30:00] we're just going to walk down the list
[30:01] but it's getting to the heart of what
[30:04] did Jesus do what was the mark it was
[30:07] that Dynamic of that relationship
[30:08] between a father and son let me just put
[30:11] that in there because I think that was
[30:12] at the core of Jesus did only that which
[30:14] the father told him the harmony between
[30:17] the father and the son is the harmony
[30:18] that now exists between Christ and his
[30:19] bride that's the real work the works
[30:21] that I do shall you do also it's being
[30:24] obedient to the father's will yes that's
[30:27] what that that was at the heart of it he
[30:28] says so what can we do to work the works
[30:30] of God well this is the work of God that
[30:32] you believe on him whom you have sent
[30:34] that goes right back to what Paul is
[30:36] saying Paul was saying when you were
[30:37] sealed it was but a seal of your faith
[30:40] so don't ever leave that channel of
[30:42] hearing the word of God and doing what
[30:44] he says hearing the word of God and
[30:45] doing what he says that's what is the
[30:47] the gold in this is that sons of God and
[30:50] Daughters of God are led by the spirit
[30:52] of God and being led in the spirit he
[30:53] said if you'll walk in the spirit you
[30:55] will not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[30:57] if you walk in the spirit you'll bring
[30:59] forth the fruit of the spirit it's a law
[31:01] of the seed that the germ of life that's
[31:03] been quickened to uh by the spirit of
[31:06] God down in your soul if you can feed
[31:07] that experience you'll grow up into him
[31:11] as Paul travailed till Christ be formed
[31:13] in you Christ will be formed in you as
[31:15] you yield to the Holy Spirit feed on the
[31:17] word of God and have an attitude that
[31:19] you desire to change and yield to him so
[31:23] it's that the work of God is to believe
[31:25] on him whom he hath sent this is is that
[31:28] Father and Son
[31:29] relationship as God said to so David
[31:32] about Solomon I will be a father to him
[31:34] and he will be my son if he do if he
[31:36] does wrong I'll correct him but I'll
[31:39] have mercy on him and I I I'll grow him
[31:42] I'll cultivate him I'll watch out over
[31:45] him the works there is a work of the
[31:48] Holy Ghost in our
[31:50] lives and brother B say it's not emotion
[31:53] he say it's not sensation yet sensation
[31:55] with it and you could look at maybe some
[31:58] of these works of the law and you'd find
[31:59] well it's not that the law was all of a
[32:01] sudden evil and it was all of a sudden
[32:04] that you you had to go anti law that's
[32:06] not it it's just you can't you can't be
[32:09] Bewitched and deceived into these other
[32:12] things as a means of righteousness
[32:15] righteousness is by faith faith that
[32:17] comes by hearing the word of
[32:19] God and so when we ask the question and
[32:23] I think this is just the first of maybe
[32:24] many series on this or services on this
[32:26] subject is there room for
[32:30] Mercy do we
[32:32] have do we have place in our hearts for
[32:35] not just
[32:36] truth and maybe a rigid discipline to a
[32:40] construct or the the legalist way when
[32:42] we can approach the word but do we also
[32:44] have room for the mercy that's
[32:46] necessary for this to come to pass a
[32:49] real understanding and we could say it
[32:52] in this way as as the picture just built
[32:55] in my heart Sunday morning we spend a
[32:56] lot more time on this
[32:59] in the correction of a child and and the
[33:01] response of a father to the child and
[33:03] those different things and we were
[33:05] looking even at how brother brandham was
[33:06] saying you know the act of turning loose
[33:08] and he says not an emotion but that
[33:10] unadultered faith faith that God would
[33:12] receive and then nurture you to be an
[33:15] eagle and then learning how to fly and
[33:18] that there was just um a lot that we
[33:20] were focusing on that comes from the
[33:21] standpoint of God knowing you as a
[33:23] father God understanding you and knowing
[33:25] the right way to approach you to where
[33:28] it's not just legalism and it's and it's
[33:30] not just uh lasciviousness but it's God
[33:33] working within you to bring you to a
[33:36] place of perfection and it requires
[33:39] Mercy you see is there room for Mercy
[33:42] I'm wanting to draw from the image of a
[33:43] house that as we might have somebody
[33:45] named charity and someone named Faith or
[33:47] hope and maybe there's someone named
[33:48] mercy and is Mercy needs a place needs a
[33:52] room in this
[33:54] house and then brother bradam has asked
[33:56] this question and that wonderful sum of
[33:58] 64 August 30th in the morning this is
[34:01] question 328 he's asked this question
[34:02] dear brother brandom is it possible for
[34:05] one to have the baptism of the Holy
[34:06] Ghost and not have signs following at
[34:09] least not until some future time in
[34:11] conditions appointed by the spirit I
[34:13] encourage you to go listen to this
[34:15] particular portion or read it uh in
[34:17] whatever means that you use and whatever
[34:19] app or maybe old oldfashioned books I
[34:23] just really encourage you to read or
[34:24] listen to this brother brandom is it
[34:27] possible for one to have the baptism of
[34:29] the Holy Ghost and not have signs
[34:30] following you can say that's the
[34:32] question the qualifier at war or at
[34:34] least not until some future time and
[34:36] conditions appointed by the spirit so a
[34:38] season of time where maybe you don't
[34:40] have signs following until maybe later
[34:43] until a future time and condition that
[34:45] the Holy Spirit has
[34:47] ordained and brother BR when he begins
[34:49] to answer this it's really beautiful the
[34:51] way he begins to start to answer this
[34:52] but brother bam says it gave him an
[34:54] opportunity to address his family it's
[34:56] the way he begin this answer he says I
[34:58] like this it gives me an opportunity to
[35:00] address my family my converts my
[35:01] followers but he makes this reference to
[35:04] family and he says I want to he makes
[35:06] this point that he wants to clarify his
[35:08] position on what it means to be
[35:11] Pentecostal and denominational systems
[35:13] he says people say whe they're
[35:14] Pentecostal or Pentecostal in these
[35:16] denominational systems and so he's said
[35:18] I love this opportunity I've been asked
[35:20] this question is it possible for someone
[35:21] to have the baptism of ghost without
[35:22] these signs and wonders following them
[35:24] at least at not till some future time he
[35:26] says thank you for asking the question
[35:28] I can use this as an opportunity to
[35:29] address my family to address my converts
[35:32] remember Sunday we focused on how Paul
[35:34] as a father to those in the gospel
[35:36] Galatians was that fatherly approach
[35:38] using that truth and mercy and at the
[35:41] end of this answer when he's at the very
[35:43] end of answer in it it's several
[35:44] paragraphs long he points out that a
[35:46] person's nature may push them toward a
[35:49] certain condition now notice how I I
[35:52] want you to pick up on this part as I'm
[35:54] trying to summarize it brother BR said
[35:56] is asked is it possible for someone to
[35:58] have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[35:59] I say that in other words it's not just
[36:01] the spirit being poured out but that can
[36:03] they have the Holy Ghost IND dwelling
[36:05] but not have signs
[36:07] following and they might have in their
[36:09] mind a certain subset of signs that's
[36:11] really important to them and he and he
[36:14] said this is great I can address my
[36:15] family on on what it means to be
[36:17] Pentecostal and all these denominational
[36:19] systems and how they've organized around
[36:20] evidences and they put a period on
[36:22] different things and he ends up saying
[36:24] you know a person's nature May force
[36:27] them or put P them towards a certain
[36:29] condition they have the Holy Ghost and
[36:31] they want something a certain way they
[36:33] just got to have it and he quotes
[36:34] someone saying I want to be sure I have
[36:36] the Holy Ghost father just give me this
[36:39] for something to stand
[36:41] on and this this could be anything let's
[36:43] just say Lord just give me the tongues
[36:45] just give me the shout just give me the
[36:47] cry give me the dance uh so I can have
[36:50] something to stand on what is that it's
[36:51] a person's nature pushing them toward a
[36:53] certain condition and he says now if I
[36:56] taught it like that that people would
[36:58] reach out and get a hold of that without
[37:00] having what that person's got did you
[37:03] catch that so if someone says oh I just
[37:05] need to dance I just need to shout I
[37:07] just need to cry I just need to pass out
[37:09] I just need to speak in tongues and that
[37:11] person who has the Holy Ghost is just
[37:13] looking for something to stand on and
[37:14] the father says well you know what I'll
[37:16] give it to him I'll confirm it for him
[37:17] I'll I'll do this for him and God does
[37:19] that for them and then brother abam says
[37:21] begins to preach that you want the Holy
[37:23] Ghost you need to do this you need to do
[37:24] that he says then people reach out and
[37:26] get a hold of that in other words do it
[37:28] but not have what that person
[37:31] had that's that's powerful so he says
[37:35] this the Holy Spirit can fall in a group
[37:37] of people and speak in tongues and make
[37:39] it exactly true sprawl in amongst the
[37:42] people and make it prophesy and be
[37:44] exactly true that's right that's exactly
[37:47] right sometimes you can go to a witch or
[37:49] a medium and they can tell you something
[37:51] that's exactly
[37:52] right look at the witch of indor Saul it
[37:55] could be exactly true that's still isn't
[37:58] it they're witches speaking in tongues
[38:01] I've seen Devils speak in tongues and
[38:03] write in unknown languages that don't
[38:06] mean anything but the real thing is that
[38:09] word again back to that
[38:13] word Paul's message to the Galatians
[38:15] parallels this message back to the word
[38:18] that he he's not taking anything away
[38:20] from him he's not uh trying to tear down
[38:22] their experience but he's saying you got
[38:24] to be careful that you don't adopt a
[38:26] paradigm around the outer court and the
[38:28] inner court and that you dwell in that
[38:31] most holy place these things are
[38:33] necessary these things happen we can
[38:35] visit these places but this is where God
[38:37] dwells this is where his word is it's
[38:39] from there that he wants to work
[38:42] out and so brother mam this is him
[38:45] addressing this question he says this
[38:47] person this is very lengthy but we'll
[38:48] end on this this person here is asking
[38:51] the question about the possibility of
[38:52] having the baptism ghost without signs
[38:54] following them now I'm answering this in
[38:56] a real juvenile my way of doing it but
[38:59] if you're born a normal human being you
[39:01] will actually do the things that a
[39:02] normal human being would do is that
[39:04] right when you're born as a human the
[39:06] natural traits of Human begin being a
[39:08] human being will follow you you won't
[39:11] live in a tree and try to fly with your
[39:12] wings like a bird or something like that
[39:14] that wouldn't be a normal human being
[39:17] the normal actions of a human being the
[39:19] normal action of a human being would be
[39:21] would be to
[39:24] work work marry have a family and do
[39:26] these things just reminds me brother
[39:28] John of sister Esther's wedding speech
[39:31] that have grandchildren have children
[39:33] that was what she wanted to tell sister
[39:35] Sarah is have kids as soon as possible
[39:37] that's the real beauty of family so the
[39:39] normal action of human being is to work
[39:40] marry have family and do these things
[39:42] that's natural normal human beings
[39:44] because you're born that then when
[39:47] you're born a Christian born of the
[39:48] spirit of God you naturally take up the
[39:50] attributes of
[39:53] Christ says now if we took care this
[39:55] morning in this congregation where you
[39:56] people set here and listen day after day
[39:59] and so forth to the teaching you'll find
[40:01] out you'd be different one from another
[40:04] just zero in on this because he's saying
[40:06] that if you are born of the word of God
[40:08] or born a Christian born by the spirit
[40:09] of God you'll take up the attributes of
[40:11] Christ now we're still human so there's
[40:14] certain human elements that'll exist but
[40:17] you'll take up attributes of Christ but
[40:20] those that sit under the teach of the
[40:21] word of God you'll find out they're
[40:22] different one from another because you
[40:24] are different your makeup different your
[40:28] appetites are different you eat
[40:30] different but you all eat
[40:33] food right we may all not eat at
[40:37] Ros but we all eat
[40:39] food with one individual being just like
[40:42] the other one you're different one from
[40:44] another Christians do the same thing you
[40:47] can't say now all do all speak with
[40:49] tongues do all prophesy do all see how
[40:52] you make something a law you make
[40:54] something an not to well this is the way
[40:55] that it has to work out this is the way
[40:56] it has to be he said no cuz a person
[40:58] says is it possible that you could have
[41:00] the bapt of the Holy Ghost and and not
[41:02] have signs following and brother Bram as
[41:03] a father addressing his family saying
[41:06] you know what we're all different we're
[41:08] all nature different but we all eat food
[41:11] so when it comes to the attributes of
[41:12] Christ what is
[41:14] common what's the common you brother
[41:16] Brown even says you may not we we all
[41:18] may not be lay our hands on somebody and
[41:20] feel the charge of the Holy Ghost and
[41:22] life come back into a dead body we may
[41:23] not all do this we may not all do that
[41:25] and so there's things that we're not all
[41:27] going to do but it's being done in the
[41:29] body right because it's according to the
[41:30] word of God it's done in the body but we
[41:32] don't impose all that on there and say
[41:34] okay well you know we're just kind of
[41:35] going through the list of attributes
[41:37] here and I just hadn't seen you lay
[41:39] hands on a sick and they recover uh
[41:42] could you show could you verify a
[41:43] miracle so that we could be sure we're
[41:45] checking that box for you I we can't do
[41:48] that remember how that when we were
[41:50] looking at uh the the ought to in the
[41:53] Great Commission it's amazing how
[41:55] there's certain things that we ought to
[41:56] do but but when it comes to taking up
[41:58] deadly serpents and drinking deadly
[42:00] things you know nobody's passing the cup
[42:02] or the box of snakes right but they want
[42:04] you to speak in tongues they want you to
[42:05] lay hands on the sick and so there's a
[42:07] way that we kind of force this Paradigm
[42:09] that's not in n in the nature of the
[42:11] word he said you just naturally take up
[42:12] attributes of Christ but Christians are
[42:14] different you say well don't all do this
[42:16] or don't all do that he says you have to
[42:18] watch these things because a Christian
[42:20] takes up the habits of a Christian and
[42:23] they live like a Christian Jesus said
[42:26] these signs shall fall them that believe
[42:27] notice in my name they shall cast out
[42:29] Devils they shall take up serpents and
[42:31] drink deadly things they they speak with
[42:33] new tongues in them things just actually
[42:36] follow Christians amen now the person
[42:39] has a very good thing here or do we wait
[42:41] until the future time or the conditions
[42:43] appointed by the Holy Spirit I like that
[42:45] now you get the idea when it's appointed
[42:48] by the Holy Spirit God appoints things I
[42:51] think that if the Pentecostal people
[42:53] would try you'll understand me if we
[42:55] you'll get here why I different
[42:57] with you pressing that idea that they
[42:59] must all speak with tongues I cannot see
[43:02] that right I like cherry pie and I'm a
[43:04] human being but there's no need of me
[43:06] trying to tell you if you don't eat
[43:07] cherry pie you're not a human
[43:09] being right but eating cherry pie is
[43:13] just one of the habits of a human being
[43:14] you might disagree with me on that but
[43:16] it's true now one will eat this and one
[43:19] will do something else yeah I think you
[43:21] just have to really catch what he's
[43:22] trying to say in answering this question
[43:24] in a very delicate way is right his
[43:27] answer doesn't nah you don't you don't
[43:29] need to worry about anything no signs
[43:31] you could just come as you are remain as
[43:33] you are just believe that you got the
[43:34] Holy Ghost he says but the Holy Spirit
[43:36] appoints these offices but when you try
[43:38] to force yourself into it now that's not
[43:41] fair to you you try to force yourself
[43:44] into doing something a certain way and
[43:46] I'll just I'll just address uh uh
[43:48] address address Ros for a second
[43:51] somebody saying well brother Aaron you
[43:52] mentioned it so much I've been there I
[43:54] didn't like it okay well you don't have
[43:55] to force you don't have to force
[43:57] yourself on it just buy me
[43:59] one right you know save a room at the
[44:02] table for me but no it's not this
[44:04] expectation like what do you mean you
[44:05] don't like that what do you mean you
[44:06] don't like that hey everybody's
[44:08] different everybody's different some
[44:10] people don't like this some people don't
[44:12] like that some people can agree on
[44:13] things but we're all
[44:14] eating and so these differences that we
[44:16] all have he's saying don't force that on
[44:18] yourself that's number one don't force
[44:21] this Paradigm on yourself I got to be
[44:23] this way I got to be that way or I don't
[44:25] have it he says no that's no different
[44:27] than saying well just because you don't
[44:29] eat rles you're not a human being
[44:32] right when you try to force yourself
[44:34] into it then he says if I said you had
[44:37] to eat cherry pie would if cherry pie
[44:39] made you
[44:42] vomit and yet you'd vomit and try to eat
[44:44] cherry pie and vomit because you're
[44:46] trying to force yourself into it and
[44:49] they say this is good this is what I
[44:50] have to do this is what I have to do
[44:51] says you're hurting yourself and that's
[44:54] the way you try to do when you try to
[44:55] force yourself to do something that's
[44:58] contrary to the
[44:59] spirit now what's contrary to the spirit
[45:04] would it be contrary to the spirit with
[45:05] speak to speak with tongues would it be
[45:07] contrary to the spirit to to lay hands
[45:09] on the sick no but to Force One into a
[45:11] paradigm that this is what you ought to
[45:13] do this is what you have to do force
[45:15] yourself he says he's got your life
[45:17] lotted for a certain thing do you
[45:18] understand that amen this is the mercy
[45:21] this is the mercy where he knows our
[45:22] frame he knows that we're dust he knows
[45:24] where we come from God knows your
[45:26] temperament God knows how you are
[45:27] remember how brother B said you know if
[45:28] one's a little H uh uh emotional then
[45:31] they're going to tend this way if one's
[45:32] a little starchy they're going to tend
[45:33] that way and he says if the way one is
[45:35] when they come you got to watch them if
[45:37] they're not careful they'll gravitate to
[45:39] these other sides he says you got to
[45:41] watch these things you got to watch
[45:43] these little ideas and these different
[45:44] makeups and things because a Christian
[45:46] has to take up the attributes of Christ
[45:48] and the habits of Christ not the habits
[45:50] of human beings you can't force yourself
[45:53] into particular things says do you
[45:55] understand that says and you when you're
[45:57] filled with the spirit here's one of the
[45:58] best signs I know you're so in love with
[46:01] Christ and believe every word that he
[46:03] says to be
[46:04] truth well that's that sounds about a
[46:07] pretty good evidence of a Christian now
[46:09] that's some food I think we could all
[46:10] eat we love Christ and we believe every
[46:13] word that he says to be the truth that's
[46:15] the evidence that you have the Holy
[46:16] Spirit in your life's full of joy oh my
[46:19] everything's different than what it used
[46:21] to be that's the Holy Spirit now these
[46:24] gifts are in the spirit notice I I I
[46:28] like this he says if every person in
[46:29] here was in perfectly harmony with the
[46:31] Holy Spirit every one of you was filled
[46:33] with the Holy Ghost and in harmony with
[46:34] the Holy Ghost these signs would just be
[46:36] multiplying among you all the time it'd
[46:37] just be constantly going but where
[46:39] there's confusion where there's
[46:41] difference where we set up the Holy
[46:42] Spirit can't move itself it can't
[46:44] operate through the people so you can't
[46:48] can't take away that aspect of the Holy
[46:50] Spirit he says and if I said now you
[46:52] each one of you did you speak in tongues
[46:55] yeah well you got it did you speak in
[46:56] tongu no you haven't got it now I'm
[46:59] making myself a
[47:02] judge God is the judge of these things
[47:05] but watch Jesus said these signs shall
[47:08] follow them the groups that believe the
[47:11] whole nature of the Holy Spirit flows
[47:13] through them and they are full of love
[47:15] and joy and just a great bundle of real
[47:18] goodly Godly filled people that's the
[47:21] Holy Spirit and in there they speak with
[47:23] tongues on the occasion that the tongues
[47:25] arise why or necess for that they speak
[47:27] with tongues and if there's a prophecy
[47:29] it speaks and oh it's just exactly
[47:31] perfect every time it's really telling
[47:34] us yes as the Holy Spirit appoints it as
[47:36] it is necessary God will do
[47:39] it now if the whole church would work in
[47:41] harmony like that then Among Us would be
[47:44] casting out devils and taking up
[47:46] serpents drinking deadly things all
[47:47] kinds of things going on and now listen
[47:50] but when you try to force that to
[47:53] individuals then you get yourself that's
[47:56] Pentecostal again then you get Babylon
[47:59] confusion notice what it is it's to
[48:01] force it says when you go to force it so
[48:04] it's one thing for you to force it on
[48:05] yourself that's not fair to you but when
[48:07] you go to force that on other people
[48:09] that's Pentecostal again the Babylonian
[48:12] confusion he says you can't judge that
[48:15] our hearts are full of joy and happiness
[48:17] and oh my the birds are singing
[48:19] everything's wonderful just full the
[48:20] spirit of God and we're so in love with
[48:22] Jesus we want to pray all
[48:24] night and he says now I wouldn't
[48:27] embarrass this crowd or even myself to
[48:29] you there's the mercy he says but I
[48:31] wonder if I could ask this morning which
[48:33] one in this crowd or this people that
[48:35] had the Holy Ghost it'd probably be 95%
[48:38] of you raise your hand that you had the
[48:40] Holy Ghost then I'll turn around and
[48:42] give you a Bible evidence just one a
[48:45] Bible evidence and I doubt whether there
[48:47] be one or two hands go
[48:51] up just could tie it in such a place but
[48:55] when you do he said tie in such a place
[48:58] I he saying I could ask how many here
[49:00] has the Holy Ghost everybody 95% of
[49:02] people raise their hand and he says okay
[49:03] this is what the Bible says the evidence
[49:05] of the Holy Ghost so this is what the
[49:06] Bible said someone with the Holy Ghost
[49:07] would do and he said I doubt one or two
[49:09] hands would go up he says you're just
[49:11] tying it to a
[49:13] place he said but when you do that
[49:15] you're also Hur in your
[49:18] congregation how when you force it on
[49:20] individuals when you force it it's not
[49:22] saying that we can't have a um it's not
[49:26] saying that it shouldn't be but it's the
[49:28] nature and the way that it's
[49:30] imposed either to say as we said before
[49:33] well it doesn't matter just let them be
[49:35] kids and let them do this let them do
[49:36] that it doesn't matter this is the way
[49:38] that it this is the way that it can be
[49:40] just let it be or you become legalistic
[49:42] about it oh it needs to be this way it
[49:43] needs to be this way there's no
[49:45] mercy there's no mercy as brother Bram
[49:47] is demonstrating here as a father to his
[49:49] family everybody's different there's the
[49:51] mercy to I know your frame I know your
[49:53] proclivities I know how you're natured I
[49:55] know what you're prone to and every 's
[49:56] different just be
[49:58] yielded he says you could tie it to such
[50:00] a place where if I could put this where
[50:03] where none of you would have it tie it
[50:05] to such a place where we would could not
[50:07] say that we have the Holy Ghost but
[50:08] you're hurting your congregation and
[50:10] then he says this this to me is the
[50:11] Clincher but you've got to get them out
[50:13] of that babyhood and get them into
[50:17] manhood so what was he showing us that
[50:19] there's a there's a particular approach
[50:21] that you've got to take and it's it's
[50:23] not legalism it's not license but it's
[50:26] this you've got to get them out of
[50:28] babyhood you got to get the young to
[50:30] grow
[50:31] up and in order to do that it's got to
[50:33] be the nature of the word that operates
[50:36] within the individual to bring them into
[50:38] the image of Christ amen we've got to go
[50:40] from babyhood into manhood it's going to
[50:42] take the truth it's going to take mercy
[50:45] God bless you tonight let's stand
[50:47] together let's pray if the musicians
[50:49] would
[50:50] come thank you for your attentiveness
[50:52] this
[50:54] evening it is such a privilege to be

[51:27] burden tonight I desire that The Words
[51:29] which we spoke though perhaps hurried
[51:32] and maybe there was a lot a lot of
[51:34] scripture and different kind of angle
[51:37] there towards the end I just hope that
[51:38] you could deal with each person's
[51:41] heart Lord even as brother brandham in
[51:44] the sermon works his faith expressed he
[51:47] even spoke when he was praying at the
[51:48] beginning how that would the Holy Spirit
[51:50] just correct what he said in a person's
[51:53] heart and so Lord tonight I just pray
[51:55] that the Holy Spirit would just properly
[51:58] place the things that I said tonight in
[52:00] a person's
[52:01] heart Lord if I said it in a way towards
[52:03] just angled a little bit differently to
[52:05] where it just it doesn't find that that
[52:08] nest in that spot just right May the
[52:11] Holy Spirit just turn it around in that
[52:12] person's heart so that this word which
[52:14] we have shared tonight could be added to
[52:17] a person's
[52:19] faith and Lord for me as I preach these
[52:22] things I just feel like I'm in the
[52:23] middle of a thought as I end each one of
[52:25] these services but Lord I just desire
[52:27] that there would be more
[52:29] Mercy that there be more room for mercy
[52:32] in my
[52:33] heart that can have I could have your
[52:36] eyes that I might be your
[52:39] hands Lord if I'm going to be your eyes
[52:42] have the right kind of eyes to be the
[52:44] right kind of hands Lord then I want to
[52:45] have the right kind of ear to hear your
[52:48] word because Lord you put an ear in my
[52:51] heart to
[52:52] hear and I want that word to work freely
[52:55] in my life
[52:58] so father I ask tonight is there room
[53:00] for mercy in our
[53:01] hearts brother bandam says we could
[53:04] judge and we could just try to clinch
[53:06] things down so tight where none of us
[53:08] would have it but Lord let us get out of
[53:11] this judging let us get out of this
[53:12] lacad isical let may we not lack truth
[53:15] and not lack Mercy but Lord may we grow
[53:17] out of babyhood into
[53:20] manhood so Lord I pray for us tonight as
[53:22] a church as families as individuals that
[53:24] we could learn from these things and be
[53:27] corrected by these things so we ask for
[53:29] your mercy in our lives just take your
[53:34] take your time with us Lord use us For
[53:36] Your Glory wash us Purge us instruct us
[53:38] lead us and guide us may we feel a new
[53:40] feeling a freshness father we commit all
[53:43] things to you now in the name of the
[53:44] Lord Jesus Christ amen
