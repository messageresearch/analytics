TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Exodus 25 and verses 1-1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying and now these next several verses are um God speaking he says speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering and this is the offering which you shall take of them gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and Scarlet and fine linen and goat's hair and Ram skins DED red and Badger skins and Sheet him wood oil for the light spices for anointing oil and for sweet incense onx stones and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate and this is just the beginning and so there's so many details here and it says and let them make me a sanctuary that I may DW I may dwell among them so now you see the context of what he's asking these offerings for according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it and they shall make an ark of sheum wood two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof and a cubit and a half the height thereof and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold within and without shalt thou overlay it and shall make upon it a crown of gold round about amen we desire God would just bless these scriptures that we've read this this morning may may he just anoint it make it alive To Us by Revelation you can have your seats my my title today is the gift of God's Christ's present the gift of Christ's presence and it is continuing on the series that we've been on this year in the house of the Lord and I think this is the 75th sermon that we've used on this subject of the house of the Lord but the gift of Christ's presence I want to start with a statement from the sermon the Queen of Sheba and and it's just uh taking this one sentence out he said God gives gifts in all generations he's talking about how God had sent a gift to Israel and how the Queen of Sheba had heard about it had come and he said God gives gifts in all generations a gift of his presence what an amazing statement a gift of his presence I'm wanting to take uh instead of saying a gift of his presence but a gift of Christ's presence and I would say that there may be the intentional uh cliche and what is so common maybe this time of year is the play on words of presence Christmas presentence and presence and the question of whether or not uh or just using that phrase of God's presence with as far as being with someone and maybe the gifts that you would receive uh and so there may be that uh that thought kind of rattling around in my mind but I want to be very focused on the gift of God's presence or the gift of Christ's presence a gift of as brother Bram says his presence and I'm using the theme of Christmas using this Christmas season uh to highlight a particular aspect of the house of the Lord so I'm wanting to use maybe the subject matter of this time of year but emphasize something that is timeless something that is very important to us and as we're ministering on the house of the Lord we're coming to our conclusion of this series and I would say a climax to where wanting to zero in on the very thing that David when we started in part one one thing have I desired but what was was it that David wanted what was it that he valued what was it that really drove him to want to be in the house of the Lord and if I could say this now so that you're already thinking about it wasn't that he found a listing on Airbnb that was called the house of the Lord It's like man the senior is beautiful have you seen everything it's gold and he's just like this is perfect or he had been on Pinterest or Instagram and saw something that he wanted to visit there was something there something about the house that Drew him to it and I will say this before we much further uh and I know that I've articulated this in years past that uh whether or not you celebrate Christmas is not a Church decision in other words I as the pastor or we as the church don't decide whether or not you as families celebrate Christmas so it's not a Church decision it is a family decision and whatever decision a family makes we would respect that as Believers one to another respect the decision so if there's families here that don't say uh Merry Christmas and wouldn't even say happy happy holidays they wouldn't celebrate it and they don't exchange gifts uh and they and what I would say even no matter what the reasons were we respect that and we still respect them as brothers and sisters we love them and we would want to be supportive to them uh just as the world wouldn't want kids at school telling other kids at school that Santa Claus doesn't really exist uh we wouldn't want to be that guy that's telling somebody who doesn't celebrate Christmas and says well we do and there's nothing wrong with it and you guys are sad uh we we wouldn't want to be those kind of people because it's a family decision and if there's through the preaching of the word and I as the pastor I I'm just very conscious of this that if I'm emphasizing uh Christmas or I mention the birth of Christ or just use some themes in this holiday season it's not done to endorse celebrating it's not done to put pressure uh that we should all be wearing our green red and white uh that's not it at all it's just it's the season people are thinking about it and it gives us an opportunity to put things in a particular context even the word Christmas comes from Christ mass and we know that that phrase and that mass is uh very Latin it's C Catholic uh reminds me of the time when my brother was witnessing to somebody in Prescot and he was uh English wasn't their first language and so he was witnessing to them a and telling them that they they needed to come to Jesus and and in their broken English they said that they were alcoholic and and my brother said I know that's why you need God you you need God because because of that and that's it's proof that you need God and as he walked away he realized the guy said I'm Catholic and my brother thought he said he was an alcoholic and so either way the response you know was appropriate but uh we know that Christ mass is Catholic uh it's Catholic but uh it was originally meant uh to speak of it's speaks of celebrating the birth of Christ and so I want to work with that uh that thought of the birth of Christ and work with what the coming of Christ meant using this title The Gift of Christ's presence I have a friend that I went to law school with who was texting me last week and uh he was just mentioning I'm just and he's a good good good brother a good Christian and he said just looking forward to celebrating his coming and they're thinking about the Advent the coming of God in and the manger the coming of Christ in a Manger and though that might be the cliche and the phrases that the world use in reality that is what it is is it's a scriptural fulfillment of God's promise to come and there's something beautiful about it and it also fits with what in my heart has been a driving theme on the subject of the house of the Lord because the house of the Lord points to this very gift it points to this very thing and it highlights what was Central in God's heart and his desire in building the Tabernacle and the temple so if you could just take your Bibles and look at the text here that was my my intro and if if you need to ever refer back to those few moments just to understand the context uh it'll be it'll be there in the archives unless we scrub it and exodus 25: 1 to9 and let's just go back over this walk with me as we have a number of scriptures to read today says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering is that true as far as our giving and that we would want to do so willingly and give it with our heart and this is the offering which you shall take of them gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and Scarlet and fine linen and goats hair and RAM skins dyed red and Badger skins and sheum wood oil for the light spices for anointing o and for sweet incense onx stones and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate this is a big list you know uh if God was given his wish list uh during the Christmas season he said well this is a this is pretty extensive couldn't you just say Playmobile or or maybe a bike but here he's asking for a lot of things gold silver brass fine linen oil spices onx stones and stones that are going to be set in the ephod and the breastplate these are things that are of high value and great worth and he wasn't just asking for it to fill his coffers and even or to to enrich Moses and his family but verse 8 tells us and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them he wanted all these elements and all these different things that were going to be given were to be given for the purpose of constructing a house constructing a Dwelling Place he calls it a sanctuary who was the sanctuary for God God wanted this Sanctuary that I may dwell among them he says make this according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the the Tabernacle in the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall ye make it so God showed him a tabernacle we could say a Tabernacle in heaven these things are patterned after heaven so we know there was a throne in heaven and the Tabernacle or the sanctuary was going to represent God's Throne on Earth and so the construction this tells us about the beginning God's request and desire uh to construct a tabernacle and the purpose of the Tabernacle and then even the temple that was later uh that the temple replaced and look at the details if we just look at the very beginning gold and silver and brass and fine linen uh this wouldn't be a cheap thing right the these are these things are the best if Moses stood up and said God is asking for an offering and God wants you to give and to give willingly from your heart a and everyone's thinking okay yeah we could do that the first thing that comes out of his mouth is gold right a and and it's kind of like oh okay well you could have said anything right Akin's over there going I don't know about this and so this is the very first thing is gold and silver and brass and maybe somebody he says gold they're like man I don't have any gold and he says silver I don't have any gold I work with brass and then brass so it's all it's it's he's asking for the best the fin Lin and oil and spices uh uh gems and all these precious materials God is say give willingly from your heart he's not going to demand it from them but give it because I want you to give the resources and of yourself and sacrifice to build this Tabernacle in First Kings chap 6: 11-4 I wanted to take this and read um about the temple that Solomon built that David desired to build and I know I'm drawing on 11 months worth of sermons uh as far as the house of the Lord a lot of details here and there and it says this and the word of the Lord came to Sol saying now remember David wanted to build a house for the Lord David wasn't allowed to build it Solomon is going to build it now God as he spoke to Moses is speaking to Solomon concerning this house which Thou Art in building if thou will walk in my statutes and execute my judgments and keep all my Commandments to walk in them the then will I perform my word with thee which I spake unto David thy father very direct promise to Solomon and the throne the kingship and God says again and I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake My People Israel just as God had said in Exodus 25 about the Tabernacle which was temporary which was a tent that moved now this permanent structure called the temple that Solomon was built we could say Solomon's first temple he says I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake My People Israel this is the purpose of the Tabernacle the purpose of the temple is that I will dwell among the children of isra Isel let them make me a sanctuary that I can dwell among them in verse 14 says so Solomon built the house and finished it so we know the Tabernacle was finished and when they finished it the presence of God came the glory of God came the same thing happens with the temple and to I want to spare maybe the details and not take much time in it as I was studying it trying to piece things together and going through different things I found well instead of just reading all the scriptures uh that first scripture is enough to think to start considering just how much value was put into the Tabernacle and as I was looking uh and trying to run the math and and uh find resources of people who've already done the math I was Finding many instances or it was confirming that at least a there was at least a hundred billion dollars worth of materials just in gems and precious metals just just the materials of the gems and precious metals into the temple and it would cost up to $175 billion today if we were to rebuild the Temple cuz you can go you could read well they said they had this much gold and how many ounces of gold there were thousands of ounces of gold and how much this was and how much that was and and the seed is from Lebanon and somebody did the math and they've come up with this uh figure to say that it could be uh many are saying right in this Ballpark and I would say maybe even more at least $175 billion doll to rebuild the Temple today that is quite an edifice that's quite a structure and and that's not the manh hours that this is these are just the materials the value of the materials and the things that are put into it and going back to Exodus chapter 25 that God is saying bring these offerings to make me a sanctuary uh Solomon is going to rebuild it in a more permanent way but it's still the house of the Lord and God in verse 10 says and they shall make an ark of sheum wood two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof now I want you just to recognize that as soon as God says make me a sanctuary after the pattern I show you in heaven and the very first thing he begins to describe is the ark which is a word it means a chest it actually could be described as a translated to a coffin and it and it says and it shall be two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof and a cubit and a half the height thereof and this Arc of the test testimony is going to continue to describe even all the way through to verse 22 in the elements of The Mercy Seat and in verse 11 it says and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold within and without shalt thou overlay it and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about when there's times when you're constructing something and you're building uh whether it be Cabinetry or something like that or where's Brother Scott shelves you know you're building a library and there's certain things that are the finished side that you're going to see and and you you want to make sure that that's perfect and the side that's going to be up against the wall the part that nobody's ever going to see uh you don't need to worry about finishing that but God said I want every part inside outside every part overlaid with gold I don't want any wood showing and the Builder might say well there's no point in that that's going to be up against the wall or the lid's going to rest on that that's going to be on the inside there's going to be a ring put there you could you could save a lot of money in this building process if you don't uh try to fill all the these things in and do this and do that God says I don't want anything showing I want it overlaid completely with gold and just in this Arc alone in today's value there's over there's nearly $6 million in gold just on the ark should we go find it $6 million in gold just in the ark alone this is there's this is a lot of stuff of value and weight and and you can actually scripturally measure and just you could just use the current market price of gold and go find the ounces that are being described a and just do the math and realize there's a lot of money a lot of value a lot of precious material being put into the whole Temple but now just in the ark itself in the gold that would overlay the ark $6 million in First Kings chapter 6: 19 to30 read through this you're going to see the description of this Arc and this place in the temple and the Oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the Ark of the Covenant of the lord I want you to recognize the very first thing that God begins to describe to be built was the ark of the testimony he gives them instructions for the Tabernacle and he describes the Ark of the testimony and The Mercy Seat these are the very first elements God's beginning with the most interior the most holy place he doesn't start by saying let's put in a curb here and a sidewalk he begins with that central part and the Oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord Oracle you might seem like an odd statement the Oracle is being prepared uh Oracle means to speak or declare or command to promise to warn there's a an oracle of God it speaks of that convey but the Oracle here is the most holy place that's what's being described here is the holiest of holies and the Oracle in the four part was 20 cubits in length and 20 cubits in breadth and 20 cubits in height thereof I believe that's close to 30 ft and he overlaid it with pure gold and so covered the altar which was of Cedar so the Ark of the Covenant is overlaid with pure gold the Oracle all of it is overlaid with gold so Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold let's just keep noticing how many references to this pure gold is and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the Oracle and he overlaid it with gold and the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had finished all the house also the whole altar that was by the Oracle he overlaid with gold I think there's a term for this over gold right you could could die from over gold and and within the Oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree and each 10 cubits high and five cubits was the One Wing of the Cherub and five cubits the other wing of the Cherub from the uttermost part of the One Wing until the uttermost part of the other were 10 cubits and the other cherub was 10 cubits both the cherubims were of one measure and one size so there the same and the height of the one cherub was 10 cubits and so it was of the other cherub now consider just how enormous these were how big and vast they were say all of Olive Tree going to be fat fashioned out of wood and uh that would maybe be your cheapest construction and we might say well we could 3D print at that for are cheaper today but they're using wood they're using these different materials and this is what it's going to be and now as we continue reading just think of how vast these structures would be in this Oracle this Most Holy place and he set the cherubims within the inner house that's that most holy place not outer Court not inner Court in the most holy place the Oracle the place that God began to describe first or the very instrument that was going to be in that that place the Ark of the testimony the Ark of the Covenant first begin to describe that in Exodus 25 and then he begins to kind of basically he's working his way out here he says and he set the cheram within the inner house so they stretched forth the wings of the cheram so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house such a vast uh uh structure and he overlaid the Cherub boms with gold of course he did as you're reading through this this was overlaid this was overlaid this was overlaid one after another overlaid with gold overlaid with gold now these giant cherubs are overlaid with gold now remember the mercy seed as it was described in Exodus chapter 25 was going to have cherubims that stretch their wings high and covered The Mercy Seat so this is the Reconstruction of this this is the replication of this in the temple and he overlaid the cherums with gold and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherums in palm trees and open flowers within and without as I was reading these scriptures last week how many times they put a Graven image in the house of the Lord that's something to chew on isn't it and the floor of the house was overlaid with gold within and without the floor was gold Hallelujah you think well surely we could just you know we just do a stained concrete that's economical and he goes in and overlays the floor with gold this is a pricey Endeavor this is everything is the the detail and you say well the gold means this and the gold means that yeah there all these things could be spoken of we could get into great detail in all these things because I believe God put the details in there for a reason we could get into what the wood represents and we could talk about what the cheram represent we could talk about all these different aspects because God is being very particular and being very precise why does he want gold silver and Brass why does he want fine linen why is there old and SP oil and spices why are all these things there well they mean something to God he's asking that they be willingly give and they must mean something to him now in verse chap uh excuse me in Exodus chapter 25 veres 21 and 22 we've read this quite a bit especially over the last several services on mercy and thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat above upon the ark and The Mercy Seat was overlaid with gold so it's put above upon the ark we've read about the Ark of the Covenant and in in just a moment ago and how that's the first thing that God starts with then he goes to the mercy seat and now he's putting The Mercy Seat upon the ark and in the ark Thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee and there I will meet with thee if you if we had taken time to describe the entire construction of the Tabernacle in the wilderness or the temple you'd find there's a lot of rooms there's a lot of square footage uh there's a porch and there's a inner there's an outer court and there's a lot of activity and a lot of pillars and a lot of entrances and there's a lot of things uh that exist in these structures both in the wilderness and in Jerusalem but he says and I will meet you there that's where I'll meet thee and I will commune with thee from Above The Mercy Seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the Ark of the testimony notice how precise God is being about where he's going to be so he's not saying well just come into my house and so we could just kind of hang out in the foyer or we could we could kind of walk the grounds and I'm not necessarily trying to make an analogy to this Sanctuary to the most holy place but it in just using it as a dramatization he's not just saying come and be on the campus and that's where I'm going to be I'm just going to kind of be in The Ether but I'm going to be in one place there between the cheram I will dwell there and I will commune I will speak I will will command we will Fellowship together he says above the mercy seat from between the two Terin which are upon the Ark of the testimony of all things which I'll give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel if you could just uh do this now with this singular Focus everything in the construction of the temple everything in the design of the house of the Lord everything in it purpose pointed to this and maybe I did uh a little bit of a disservice by not reading of the curtains in the Tabernacle made of goat hair and the bars and the coverings and the veils and all the different details and the Rings and The draperies and the all the ornamentation that was done in the temple and the carvings and the Engravings and all these things it's describing the greatest Cathedral the greatest thing so ornate so beautiful so much attention to details so many things are put in it and and it's if I think about maybe visiting a museum like the reiches museum or something and you go and you're just in awe of every painting and everything that is uh beautiful and even the construction of the facilities and everything's wonderful but this Temple there was everything pointed to One Singular place if you just begin to make a journey to the temple and if you arrived in Jerusalem and made your way to the steps and you walked up the porch every step from the outside of the temple through the outer Court into the inner court and Beyond the Veil it was all leading to this singular place it was all for the purpose of the manifestation that was between the cheram and what was it God's presence it's even what these cherubim symbolize they symbolize God's presence in Eden when God was going to seal off the way of the tree of life he set there cherabin with flaming swords to keep into guard so they are protectors they they they they show that there is a that God is there somewhere hidden somewhere between I was thinking of it and uh I think it's um where's my White House correspondence but brother Andrew is it a marine that stands guard outside there uh uh the uh in the at the White House in the West Wing if you want to know whether or not the president is in his office there's a marine that's standing guard right brother Mike stands guard right there outside the door now if he's not there guess what president ain't there so the chair if there's a cherub them it's it's declaring God's near God's somewhere this is what they represent this is what they uh symbolize and it's Hezekiah who's praying this and you could find this in the book of Psalm over and over in Isaiah chapter 37:16 Lord of hosts God of Israel that dwellest between the cherubims Thou Art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou Hast made Heaven and Earth it's God's presence that was the singular objective and focus and purpose of the house of the Lord It's all leading everything channeling everything moving to this one place so we kind of look at it from the start and we're over here way over here and we make our way if we were going to go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem where it would begin and everything would move and move and move and we would come to Jerusalem and we would walk our way in and everything's leading to that very place where you would pass through the veil into the most holy Place into the Oracle and you would behold the Ark of the Covenant and the mercy seat and the presence of God that would dwell there between the cherubim but for God when he begins to describe the construction of the Tabernacle he begins with that place he begins with the Ark of the testimony and The Mercy Seat because it was his that was where he would be he would dwell there the Ark of the Covenant I'm just going to spend maybe the remainder of our time looking at this the symbolic nature of the Ark of the Covenant the ark as I mentioned before the word refers to a chest even took that type of how the chest now he's it he's written his word in our hearts and that we are representation even of this and this Arc or chest it comes from the word the root word is in the sense of gathering and so it's the Gathering or this chest or this Ark a gathering of his Covenant and a covenant is an allegiance with something or Allegiance between parties or an alliance now I'm going to take the phrase and say then this Ark of the Covenant it represents this Gathering of God's alliance with Israel this is what it's going to rep you're going to see represented here these elements and inside it whether it be the law the golden pot of Mana Aaron's rod these things are symbol symbolizing and representing I believe it's maybe Hebrews 9:4 it's representing uh the Covenant of God with Israel and this was his Covenant who say well the Ark of the testimony the Ark of the Covenant which which promise was it the promise was I will dwell among the children of Israel I will form a relationship with them the Covenant is an allegiance or Alliance where God is going to be related to and establish himself in position with and among the children of Israel so the Ark of the Covenant is the chest or the Gathering of God's relationship to Israel his identification with Israel and the fact that he wanted to dwell among them now as we've come to this part I realize it's very surface maybe very shallow Elementary view of the Tabernacle and the temple the things that made it up and and and maybe the takeaway might be just how much it would have cost to build it but I want to look I want to turn to First Samuel chapter 4 so I will 1st Samuel CH 4: 1-22 read this entire story here and maybe intersperse a couple things or go back and forth in this and we're making really good times so I don't foresee us being here much longer uh I'm not necessar talking about the Rapture but that sure would be nice wouldn't it 1 Samuel chapter 4: 1 to 22 now I'm wanting to it just H I feel it just has to come here here so maybe a lot of momentum and talking about the singular focus and this place within the temple and it revolves around this Arc of the Covenant because there's where God's going to be dwelling now I feel impressed to use this scripture to really emphasize the importance of what made the house of the Lord the house of the Lord and it might be just really Elementary to say if we were to say it in more concise language the Lord's House and as we might say to someone that well that's John's house or that's Mark's house and so it denotes possession and if someone said that's John's house you would assume that that would be where he dwelt and where he lived and where his residence would be and we might not even use that language of somebody who owns a rental property and we might say well there that's a that's an investment property of his and that's this but this if you say at someone's house it signifies their dwelling place and so what made the house of the Lord the house of the Lord the Lord wow did we learn something today can we all just go eat now there's a tendency then especially if you put this much gold silver and brass and finery and all these chains of gold and all these curtains and all these veils and all this beautiful adorning there's something about the structure itself and the ceremony the tradition that can really be uh you could gravitate to and that you could be in awe of and I believe 1st Samuel chapter 4 I'm just it kind of it's going to kind of be wedged in here we had a lot of moment on on these things but now all of a sudden I want to take a step back and say be careful because there's something about the house of the Lord that made it so special says and the word of Samuel came to all Israel now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle now that's I know this is chapter 4 uh and we see the bringing up in the first few chapters of this prophet Samuel and so the phase and the word of Lord of Samuel came to all Israel is a phrase in itself to kind of set the time period and then you have now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle and pitched beside ebenezzer and the Philistines pitched in AEK and the Philistines put themselves in Array against Israel and when they had joined battle Israel was smitten before the Philistines and they slew of the Army in the field about 4,000 men and when the people were com into the camp the Elders of Israel said wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today before the Philistines let us fetch the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh un us then when it cometh Among Us it may save us out of the hand of our enemies now the very first verse of chapter 4 says and the word of go Samuel came to all Israel so God had called Samuel to be a prophet I believe it is in chapter three where says and God did not let any of the words of Samuel fall to the ground so we realize that God has established Samuel as a prophet and the word of God is coming through Samuel so it's the word of Samuel comes to Israel and it seems to be a peculiar phrase because the very next thing says Israel went out to battle against the Philistines and they lost and having lost they said why did we lose and their response is go get the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and bring it to the battlefield that it may save us out of the hand of our enemies and to this point not one mention of Samuel there's nothing said of Samuel they didn't inquire of the prophet they neither to go to battle nor to just in the reading of this nor in response to why did we lose but they're thinking let's go get the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord I know some of you are reading ahead but slow down so the people sent to Shiloh that they might bring then the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of host which dwelleth between the cherubims it so often uses this phrase and I believe the repetition is necessary to recognize that God identified himself with this place so bring the Ark of the Covenant of Lord which dwelleth between the cheram and the two sons of Eli hne in penas now I know that we might might say Phineas or finus the way I learned it years ago was in the Hebrew uh not being Hebrew I guess I could say Phineas just as well but Hof and aenas Fus penhos were there with the Ark of the Covenant of God so he comes and he's the sons of the high priest there with the ark and when the Ark of the com of the Lord came into the camp all Israel shouted with the great shout so that the Earth rang again woo Glory right what a meeting let's use this at a camp meeting and there's a great shout and the Philistines heard the noise of the shout let the devil hear your praise right let the enemy hear your shout and they said what meth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews now what watch this and they understood that the Ark of the Lord was coming into the camp the Ark of the Lord has come into Israel's camp and the Philistines were afraid get the devil on the Run believer for they said God is coming to the camp and they said woe unto us for there hath not been such a thing here here to for woe unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of these Mighty Gods these are the gods that smoke the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness be strong quit yourselves like men oh ye Philistines that you be not servants up unto the Hebrews as they have been to you quit yourselves like men and fight and the Philistines fought and Israel was smitten and they fled every man into his tent and there was a great Slaughter for their fell of Israel 30,000 footmen it's a terrible loss and the Ark of the God was taken and the two sons of Eli hne and Phineas FAS p us were slain I believe it's Hof n is how you say that but I don't want to have it's going to sound like a crowded room once you start giving all these other names but hofn and Phineas were slain so they were there with the ark the sons of the high priest sons of Eli were there with the ark it was taken and they were slain now I want this to be a lesson I want to finish this reading and then read a long statement from the choosing of the Bride to finish but there's a great lesson about the Ark of the Covenant In God's Presence here that the Ark of the Covenant the temple the Tabernacle they represent something there's details there's elements there's types there's shadows and there's something very precious about we could say the Ark of the Testament Arc of the Covenant In God's Presence there's power in his presence there's protection but in this time of battle and the word of Samuel was coming to all Israel they go into this battle to fight but Israel was not reverencing God's presence that was among them there was no open Vision it tells us in 1st Samuel the one and the it was precious it was unique and they needed God to speak to them they needed a prophet that could restore them back to true worship and they were not reverencing God and despite the fact that they were not serving God and doing what he asked they still went to battle against their enemies as a matter of fact if you were to look in 1st Samuel chapter 2:2 it says now the sons of Eli were sons of B that means worthless no good they knew not the Lord so these two sons haai and Phineas were were doing evil uh and and by their evil the Bible says they were causing the people to transgress they were taking the Choice Meats and the sacrifices and eating them for themselves they were sleeping with the women that came to offer and there was and it the Bible says they were causing by the way of their leadership their example and the way that they worship all the people of Israel were transgressing and when Israel had lost in the battle and they're like man we lost they said go get the Ark of the Covenant and I want to say this falsely LED they brought the Ark of the Covenant to the battlefield saying this will save us from our enemies and there's no objection from the sons of Eli and being falsely led to bring the Ark of the Covenant this is a very simple thought that we've now narrowed ourselves down to and I want to make this very clear they believed that the Ark of the testimony the Ark of the Covenant and The Mercy Seat they brought it to the battlefield as if it had power in itself and what I want to say here is not just tradition but Superstition they treated the ark as it was some sort of magical charm a Talisman or something that they could bring it on the battlefield and it would work on their behalf without faith or obedience like well this is where God dwells just plant it here on the battlefield and let's watch all of our enemies run and they had confidence and we got to really listen now I know may be a little warm and it might have been a long week and we're really tired and we're looking forward to next week and all the gifts and the reindeer games I want you to focus right now they had confidence in the artifact and the Very instinct to not go to the word the prophet but to go to the artifact showed that there was some sort of tendency to idolatry in their hearts and they were going to lift something that was precious something that was value something that God said I'll meet you there and I'll meet you between the cherums something that was wonderful but they were lifting it above its true purpose and if you want you say well brother Aaron uh let's let's really tap the brakes there the only evidence I need to admit into this is the fact that the Philistines felt the same way the Philistines being heathens they were superstitious and and they looked to artifacts and the multiplicity of gods and they believed in superstitious things and this would do this and this does that and they held the same Superstition that Israel did Israel said go fetch the ark and as it comes into the Camp W what a meeting shouting and dancing and praising and the Israelites the enemy sees and say oh no oh no they've got the ark oh they've got the ark that's where they got the Gods in their camp now why because they're superstitious and the Philistines themselves attributed the power to the ark the Philistines lacked zero understanding because they didn't say they're God they said gods and their gods were Mighty in Egypt their gods were Mighty in doing this so they had no understanding they had nothing but Superstition and the Israelites are acting as if they have no faith no understanding or acting superstitious verse 5 said when the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came into the camp all Israel shouted with the great shout so that the Earth rained again it caused shouting it caused praise great demonstration of worship and fear among the enemy but God was not in it over $6 Million worth of gold on the battlefield and they just assumed well I could just rub the gravestone I can just wear the belt buckle I can go to church listen we do the same thing to our churches we treat this and I think somebody in a derisive way said well that's a cute Church brother Aaron and I was like well okay brother BR said if you see a church that's wealthy God's not in it I mean we got horseflies and dust you know how soon to the church age book is just completely repudiated well you know let's leave 's book anyways that there we could do the same thing with church this is the house of the Lord we reverence the sanctuary and we want to we want we want to serve we want to serve the church and we want to do things for the body of Christ and we want but then what we're doing is we've turned the church into an artifact we've turned the church group into a Talisman a magic charm that we can somehow just reverence the sanctuary and reverence the deacons and show honor to the pastor and we could all just play our part and do our role that we're somehow going to be Victorious and what we've done is we're acting superstitiously we're acting traditionally and the very thing that makes this thing here today even worth it is Christ's presence but we could go through all the form and all the shouting and the devil might be like w I don't know what's going on there she looks like church what's going to happen but God's not even in it and the devil just says you know what we can overcome I started this we're going to we're going to do battle we're going to fight you going to show up for a fight and find out God's not in it and whip us God's presence was not about tradition God's presence wasn't the ritual God's presence wasn't in the overlan of gold and all these things God's presence was about faith it was about relationship the Ark of the testimony the Ark of the Covenant yes there's a lot of symbolism yes there's a lot of foreshadowing yes there's a lot of details in it but God did not create this edifice and just look down from above and say well I hope they like their church that I caused them to build I mean man that's beautiful that's really nice I hope they enjoy themselves I hope they can play Church you know have a place they could just get away and you know some people golf on Sundays we just go to church and we like to hear the word put in a certain way kind of scratches that itch and we just kind of treat this like Recreation but God said no I want to come down and form relationship I want to be identified with Israel and this identification even as he told like if you will keep my Commandments and you'll walk in my ways I will keep my Covenant with you in your house as I promised your father David and so God wanted to dwell amongst them but he couldn't dwell amongst them without faith without trust and he wanted there to be relationship so if I could say this the AR the the house of the Lord held no value without God in it well brother you're wrong it's $175 billion is what it would cost today I'm to where I heard that but that's how much it would cost to build it today plenty of value in it brother Aaron there was $6 Million worth of gold in today's value on that Battlefield that day you can't say there was no value in it the Arc of the Covenant held no value without God in it value is related to purpose you could take something if now just maybe for our for those who are doing the math the salvage value of a car is really related to the materials a value in it but as long as as it's useful for the purpose that it has been built it's exponentially worth more you go to buy sell a used truck and someone say well y'all buy it for $5,000 and they have someone take a look at it and they look at it and brother Frank Mader says this thing's toast you can't you can't drive it it's only it's good for scrap and all of a sudden a car that would have been worth $5,000 is worth less than $1,000 $1,000 like we could scrap it we can maybe get this part we can get that part so when you look at the temple and you look at that money I want you to think of that's the scrap value of the temple so that's a lot of money brother Ah that's the scrap value it's God that made it worth it it's God that was in it that made it valuable despite its worth in billions its greatest value its greatest feature was Christ present God's presence in there the Bible says that the Ark of God was taken and the sons of Eli dead verse 12 and there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with the Earth upon his head and so there had been great weeping and wailing and when he came low Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching for his heart trembled for the Ark of God I want you to recognize where Eli's greatest concern was and when the man came into the City and told it all the city cried out and when Eli heard the noise of the crying he said what meaneth the noise of this tumult and the man came in hastily and told Eli now Eli was 98 years old and his eyes were dim that he could not see the man said unto Eli I am he that come out of the army and I fled today out of the army and he said what is there done my son and the messenger answered and said Israel has fled before the Philistines and there hath been also a great Slaughter among the people and thy two sons also hni and thus are dead and the Ark of God is taken that's some serious news your sons are dead in the ark the one thing he was troubled about and you would think that the father would grieve he would whail he would lament In This Moment over over this news certainly but notice how the Bible says this and it came to pass when he made mention of the Ark of God not his two sons the Ark of God that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck break and he died as we say today that escalated quickly he hears this news of the Ark and it's the ark that causes him to no his Instinct isn't to weep and lament the fact that sons have died he had warned them he had spoke and warned them in the prior chapter if you do this God's going to judge you you can't live this way you can't act that way You' got to reference this so it was no surprise to him that perhaps his sons were dead but when they made mention of the Ark that's what caused him to suffer this terrible death and he had judged Israel 40 years and his daughter-in-law phineas's wife was with child near to be delivered and when she heard the tidings notice that that the Ark of God was taken so this is part of the whr and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead she bowed herself and travailed for her pains Came Upon her this story is just keep look at verse 20 this is like another job scenario J chap one and about the same time of her death so she dies in giving birth to this child the woman that stood by her said unto her fear not for thou Hast borne a son but she's dead but she answered not neither did she regard it and so they and she named I believe it's this uh the woman stood by named the child ibad saying and this is the meaning the glory is departed from Israel because the Ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband and she said this is the utterance when she speaks now the glory is departed from Israel for the Ark of God is taken what is it the glory of God the shikina now that the ark was gone they realize with this gone God's that's where God said he would dwell with us this is where God said he would meet us now I have no confidence that the sons of Eli and even the elders that asked for the ark to be brought in were conscious enough in that moment to be like we have made a ter terrible mistake we thought the Arc of the Covenant would solve all our problems but what was missing was our dedication and our Zeal for God I I I don't have any confidence that they would recognize that it wasn't the magical charm it wasn't the ark itself but it was their failure to respect and honor God's word that what made the house of the Lord was the Lord what the Ark of the Covenant was supposed to represent when they said Fetch and go get the Ark of the co oh wait wait a minute wait a minute the Ark of the Covenant Brothers do you realize what this means in the Covenant is the law in the Covenant is the golden Mana the pot of gold pot of gold with Mana in there is Aaron's Rod what do that testify God is with us he promised to fight our battles he said he would drive the enemy out from before us if we would just look to him and believe him and do all he said and instead of renting their clothes and covering their face with dirt and weeping and Welling and repenting before God for their lack of faithfulness and recognizing what that symbolized in coming back to God's presence they ran and just went to church they just grabbed the artifact they just made a pilgrimage to Jeffersonville but there was no victory in it I'm closing with this lengthy statement I think I've provided it on these slides so you can just read along with me cuz I want to look at this term kabot and I want you to look at it in the time that we're living in now brother bram's coming to the very end of this sermon and the choosing of a bride it's right this is beginning just before he prays I'm going to say this for my first time over the pulpit I've stretched out farther tonight on this than I have on anything else anytime anyhow before the public because I've had a great freedom in these meetings the choosing of a bride he's going to come and preach the invisible Union if you believe me to be God's Prophet you listen to what I've told you if there's one little tinkle of feeling in your heart you go to God right now you do it he says stop just a minute men look at your Creeds that you serve I say that's to the men here look at the Creeds that you serve now you say well brother a we just have one Creed and it's Christ um okay no that's what your cre Credo is what do you serve what dictates your fellowship with Brethren what dictates your faithfulness to church what determines how you treat your wife and your children what is it that drives you and motivates you what's your Creed that you serve look in your churches is it just exactly with the word of God have you met every qualification say I'm a good man so was Nicodemus and so was all the rest they were fine that don't have nothing to do with it and women I want you to look in the mirror not a difficult ask and look what God requires a woman to do and see in God's mirror not in your church mirror now in God's mirror and see if you could qualify in your life the spiritual bride of Jesus Christ men look in the mirror and ask yourself is this how a man should act how he should live how he should talk how he should treat others how he should fill up his time is this the way that a man should be according to the word and women do the same too look in the word of God and ask yourself is this the way a daughter of God would dress and act and present herself according to the word in this hour thank you Lord he says ministers think the same do you cut Corners here to save somebody's feelings over Yonder would you do this if they'll put you out of the church if you're feeling that way my dear brother let me warn you in the name of Jesus Christ flee from that right now and lady if you can't measure up to the qualification of a Christian not as a nominal Christian what would be the nominal Christian the one that's superstitious the one that's tradition the one that keeps just enough of the the visual things to be able to appear as if their Believers this is what the Philistines saw that day when the Ark of the Covenant showed up on the battlefield yeah they've had a great battle they lost but now all they they brought the Arc of the Covenant back they're saying the right things they're they're kind of doing the right things and there's a little bit of fear on the enemy's part but the enemy got ready to do battle they said oh they're Gods with them but let's let's quit like men let's go fight let's go fight the fight's still coming and in that moment don't look to the magical charm and put your hands on all these other superstitions and traditions you you better know that God is with you amen thank you Lord not as a nominal Christian but in your heart and your life is patterned exactly like God's marriage certificate here says it has to be church member if your church isn't like that can measure up to God's qualification of his word get out of it and get into Christ he doesn't say that very often does he but he's running out of time April 1965 he is having to say look don't just show up to a an artifact that's got all the trappings of a church that does everything you know we've got we kind of like build me a tabernacle we can construct our church to operate and almost look just like brandham Tabernacle that is a solemn warning we don't know what time you don't know what time that this city one day is going to be laying out here in the bottom of this ocean oh karum said Jesus thou who exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell for if the mighty works that's been done in Sodom and gomorra it had been B been standing to this day and Sodom and Gomorrah lays in the bottom of the Dead Sea and capernum is in the bottom of the sea thou City who claims to be the city of the Angels who has exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of fashion and things till even the four foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away to your fine churches and Steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you'll be laying in the bottom of the sea your great honeycomb under you right now the wrath of God is belching right beneath you how much longer will he hold this sandb bar hanging out over that when the ocean out yonder a mile deep will slide in there Plumb back to the salt and sea it'll be worse than the last day of Pompei repent Los Angeles and he doesn't leave it there repent the rest of you and turn to God now we preached several service on Mercy notice he says the Wrath the hour of his wrath is upon the Earth the hour of his wrath is upon the Earth flee while there's time to flee and come into church the message the temple get a tape player and some tapes and get it in your home what does he say into Christ into Christ he says let us pray and I'm going to read a portion of his prayer and I want this to really start to strike you in your hearts be very serious with this right now he says Dear God when in my spirit is shaking my heart is dropping teardrops of warning Grant oh God that men and women will not think of what I've said as a joke and the church people will not think of it as something something that was prejudiced or against them may they see lord it's in love thou bearest me record almighty God that up and down this Coast I've went year after year proclaiming your word and you could just see it in his travel up and down California bear me record oh God if it would happen tonight I've told the truth you know us this vision of the Bride is the truth I've took your name by it Lord and said it was thus sayith the Lord and I feel that I'm conscious Lord of what I'm doing so I pray thee Lord in Jesus name I want you to hear these these statements now let people shake themselves tonight and flee from the Wrath that has come for ikabod is wrote over the doors and over the Nations do you realize just how much brother brandham fits the ministry of Samuel I will Deuteronomy 18 I raise up a prophet like unto thee God is is now speaking in establishing that he's going to use prophets the first one he raises up after that order is Samuel and here his rebuke notice how pertinent is in the age if you go and study the book of Samuel how this he says kabot is written over the doors and over the Nations a black check mark has come across it the spirit of God is grieved away from it they're weighed in the balances and found wanting I want us to challenge ourselves about whether or not we know where God's presence is whether or not we value it whether or not it's something that is real to us because there are things that can cause us to shout there are things that are resemble and have pertain to and look like God's presence or or symbols of his presence or markers of his presence and just as Israel on that day in the Battlefield brought the Ark of the Covenant and assumed that God was with them on the basis that the Covenant was there and that also the Philistines themselves assumed upon the basis that the Ark of the Covenant was there that God was with them but yet the reality was that God was no longer with them brother brand is saying this now about the world and denominations he said they've been weighed in the balance and found wanting God is grieved away from it then he brings up a whole another area that we could look at the Feast of King nebuchad has repeated again with drunken parties and half-dressed women calling themselves Christians when the writing was upon the wall oh god of Heaven notice this what brother Bram does In This Moment we've been preaching on Mercy notice how this Mercy is not a pushover this Mercy isn't oh forgive the Le to se sins they're blind he says let the people he's saying let them Shake themselves flee from the Wrath oh god of Heaven have mercy upon a sinful world and a sinful people Lord As We Are Tonight God I'm trying to stand he says ask for mercy so here a prophet is pleading for Mercy I'm trying to stand in the breach and ask for divine mercy that you will speak into this crowd tonight and call your bride to attention Lord to March not by the sign of any Creed but by the sound of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah that's what I want this is what I want I want God to speak and call to my attention the sound of the Gospel oh God speak into this congregation today and call to their attention call the bride to your attention glory and he says granted oh God let it be known this night that thou art God and thy word is truth while solemnly in the face of this people we call them to attention of Thy word he stood in the gap stood in the breach and he cried out for mercy and what did he point him to the word he says in the name of Jesus Christ I pray for them Lord they have seen you beyond any Shadow of Doubt move across their crowds and tell them what's in their heart and thou knowest Lord that right now what's going on thou knowest that to be truth oh God and I pray thee in Jesus name let the Holy Spirit intercede again Lord wow thank you Lord look at the time we're living in the wrath of God is upon the earth now we've emphasized a judgment time brother Ram saying kobot is written all over these denominations all over these churches all over the world the glory of the Lord has departed not because a physical artifact has been taken but because of the word has been rejected so what would bring the presence of God back the word what's going to bring us into contact relationship and fellowship with the word welcoming and receiving the word faith and belief in the word he's saying can you take every bit of it can you measure up to the qualifications can you uh look what it requires is it with the word of God is it with the word of God and he says let the Holy Spirit intercede again now there's the there's the a mercy right the intercession over their ignorance but it's like no have mercy lord they're ignorant they don't know Lord have mercy but he says and pull from this audience Lord those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life granted oh God I pray with all my heart let the Holy Spirit pull out those pull out the bride call out the bride what are you being called to you're being invited into the very thing that made the house of the Lord what it was his presence and God in this hour has given us the gift of Christ's presence not tradition not ritual not Superstition this is the gift we come back to this is what we honor and reverence this is what means everything to us because when this goes his presence you say what's this what's this when when that goes all those that are in him will go with him and there's no hope left on Earth right as we bow our heads invite the musicians to come I want there to be a soul searching in this moment just take time to think in your heart about the things that God has done for you about the gift of God's presence how that God was making himself real in this day and age that we're living in now I maybe Lord when we on it in the next couple services but brother B says there's always a gift that declares God's presence I believe we've received one in this hour we've seen that gift what was he declaring to us Christ's presence help us to honor that help us to reverence that with our heads bowed if you could examine Yourself by the word today and you'd want to stand to your feet and say Lord I I've identified with something I stand as a a show of Faith to you asking for your help and your grace your forgiveness for Mercy you'd like like to stand in his presence so we could pray for you God bless each one of you as we bow our heads let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father during this season in this time it's called a holiday season Ule tide Nativity whether some would celebrate K Quanza or Hanukkah just about every religion and every people look to this time as some with some distinction and special time it's a great commercial time it's a great time of spending and giving and parties and drinking buying and selling so much going on at this time truly Lord it it all exists because the greater of society is a fixed a date to your Advent your coming and they placed it in December December 25th many millions Lord billions will claim that that's the day that Christ was born they'll preach about the gift they'll preach about presence some will actually honor it and be very focused they'll read through the Book of Luke and they'll do things that recognize at least what the intent is of this time and Lord as your Prophet said whether he was born December the spring or whatever it is it's a sacred time it's a special time because that was the time that Emmanuel came God With Us you didn't always desire just to dwell between two cherubs you didn't always want to be behind a veil of badger skin Lord it wasn't even that Temple as ornate as it was and as beautiful and Grand and pricey that's not where you found yourself at home but the Bible says a body thou Hast prepared me and in Christ you demonstrated and showed that that's where you find your rest that's where you're thrown is is that's what you've wanted all along is this Covenant relationship with your own and Lord I believe that the one thing that this bride should value more than anything is the word of God which declares you present makes yourself known to us Lord I desire with the remaining services that we would have this year to emphasize the beauty of your presence the gift of your presence the power and promise of it the ways that we grieve it the ways that we can welcome it oh Lord from this perspective that that's what made the house so wonderful and desirable as you were there and Lord I pray that we can also be in this end time as your Prophet was standing in the breach saying God have mercy as a bear of your presence may we too also be those that can create an atmosphere that bear your presence so father we dig deep we want to connect with it we want to identify with it we can't do it through tradition we can't do it through Superstition we do not want to make the same mistakes that hofn and pinhos did Lord where they were coaxed into tradition and Superstition thinking that the Box itself the coffin itself the chest the artifact of shum wood and gold would somehow bring victory without you lord you don't need a box you don't need a cathedral you just need a Heart full of Faith that's willing to seek you Lord I believe there's a reason why in the image of the tent Vision it's a great huge Cathedral and how big and great it was but where you wanted to meet was in a little wooden room amen it's a secret I'll meet you there there I'll commune with thee Lord may we find this secret place in the end time may we find this connection and fellowship with you because I believe we need it now more than ever that if we do not have this nourishment if we do not have this enrichment it's just a Razor's Edge before we find ourselves slipping angry upset frustrated lustful rationalizing making excuses falling back on negative habits and patterns oh God may it not be so let us hear the voice of the Prophet ring out let us also a a as family members and men and wherever we could be let us also be that voice crying out saying get into Christ come into Christ stay in Christ help us Lord to not be guilty of superstition when it comes to church when it comes to the message when it comes to the house of the Lord and I pray honor honor us with your presence let the shakan of Glory Be Welcome Lord in our hearts in our homes and in this church may we be a people as a local body but yet part of this greater body of Jesus Christ as individuals may we be a people that are conscious of your presence desirous of it and reflections of it bless your people I pray we commit everyone to you today now Lord be merciful to us oh God we receive this message of Mercy we receive this call to attention you have our attention Lord speak to us from between the cheram Lord let us hear your voice let us feel your shakina glory granted I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
