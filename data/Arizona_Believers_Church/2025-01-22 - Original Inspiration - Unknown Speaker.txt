TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Job chapter 14: 7-9 and there's a lot more in this uh than maybe I have in the text um this was a a painting by a Russian artist I thought was just real engaging uh here recently when I saw it and this is a picture of job and his comforter or his friends and this is job speaking in job Chapter 14 verse 7 for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will Sprout again and that the tender Branch thereof will not cease though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant and then the next verse is but man dieth and wasteth away yay man giveth up The Ghost and where is he so he's lamenting this uh this the brevity of man while looking at how this tree would die and then come back up again and so we desire that God would Quicken these words to us to see Jesus Christ in it that we be a blessing to us you can be seated I'm going to pick up with a statement from a sermon a man running from the presence of the Lord and He brother Bram says do you believe God is in all inspiration and sounds like a trick question because there's certain things that maybe we would say are inspired or certain things that brother brandham even himself says you could be going in Inspiration it could be contrary to the word of God uh and so I believe what he's referring to here is that things that are inspired or kind kind of points you back to things that are in the word of God or things that he confirms that God is in Inspiration he's one that inspires and he says God has to write a song Do You Believe God is in songs and there so he's asking these questions about inspiration and uh to write songs and things and in this particular place he's referring to a poem that he wrote when he was 12 years old and how he wrote of a longing to see something and then in this particular place he's saying and this thing I wrote when I was 12 it happened this very thing I longed to do and to see and those cattling mountains and hear the coyote howling it it came to pass as it were so he's saying hey there's this inspiration even as a youth that I saw fulfilled in my adult life he says Jesus said so he referred back to David don't you know what David said in the Psalms look at the very crucifixion David sang it in SEC 22nd Psalm my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me they pierce my hands and my feet he says you know and that was the song and he points to how the Psalms were songs and that they could be sung and there could be music added to it and these were The Inspirations of different writers and some written by David others by different artists and that God was behind this utterance in Psalms 22 where you read and says oh they forsaken me my bones stare at me and you think well uh here's David or here's this writer and he's in this time when his enemies pursuing him and his tongue Cleaves to his mouth and all these different ways that a person's described in the Book of Psalms but yet it's prophesying of a future event of Christ being a sacrifice and hanging on the cross as these artists uh painted some of these pictures they're trying to picture Psalms 22 that is fulfilled on the cross in the crucifixion and brother BR saying that was inspiration God was in the inspiration to write the psalm and then it was fulfilled on Calvary my title tonight is original inspiration I went through different iterations of a working title then I kind of found fell down a different Rabbit Hole uh I will put this out there as uh extra credit to those who are able to tell me or know what that rabbit hole was uh that gave uh inspiration to this title original inspiration that's my title tonight and I want to deal with the subject of inspiration because God inspires God is in Inspiration he inspires the writing of the psalm why because it was going to prophesy of a time that his son was going to be hanging on the cross fulfilling these very words so God writes songs and God inspires now in 2 Timothy 3:1 16 we covered this recently he says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction in righteousness there is saying that the Bible is God inspired the Bible is the product of God's inspiration we used it I think in the first service of the year to say that the Bible is a work of art and God is the artist and it was by his inspiration whether we say it was commissioned by these prophets of old uh God commissioned these prophets of old to write it but God inspires the word of God and it's profitable this inspiration speaks of the very Breath of God the very labor of God when you exert yourself and you labor you breathe out you you you your breath begins to heave and this word means to breathe to or to blow upon so it's this idea that the Bible is written through uh Divine or Supernatural influence as if God was breathing life into the writer as if it was God that was laboring and bringing the inspiration to cause the one to write brother Bram in the sermon God identified himself by his characteristics and I think we're going to come back to uh this sermon a little bit later or it's a very similar uh sermon that he preaches on identification during the same time time of year and he says the word come to them and they wrote it wrote it down under inspiration first they were identified prophets then they wrote the word of inspiration and they had the interpretation of the divine revelation because it was God in the man not that it was all entirely fulfilled but yet they had this a Divine unction and Revelation this inspiration and it caused them to give utterance and to write these things down he says and and I find this statement worth chewing on now that's the way he showed himself in his characteristics of identification so it's saying God identified himself by his characteristics Christ identified the same uh in every generation so he has certain attributes and certain natures and certain characteristics and he says God through by inspiration would bring an expression those are my summary terms and that's how he showed himself by his characteristics his identified characteristics their Vision being Vindicated was God's characteristic in them making himself known to the people so God inspired the prophets to write God inspired them to give utterance it was divine revelation their speaking then takes things that are symbolic and things that maybe were uh images in their minds and in their hearts sometimes we see this operating where God inspires one to speak and they speak with a language that is symbolic and it's foretelling and yet that's giving form it's giving sound to something that was inspired he said that's how God has shed himself by his characteristics is through these this inspiration in them God's characteristics being made known in them inspiration uh comes from a Latin word which means to breathe into so whether we're looking at it in terms of the uh the Greek as it's used here the very Breath of God theop noos which is the inspiration of God inspires the same way in the Middle Ages the use of the word inspiration was often linked to Divine influence or holy influence and so things that were inspired you didn't say oh I I was all inspired to go do this if you use that term you're suggesting that God caused you to do it God was breathing this creative or this intellectual uh uh life into the individual and it was inspiring them to write great works it was inspiring them to paint and certainly the concept has broadened to include really any source of creativity or motivation say uh you're my inspiration these are things that are inspired but to be inspired or inspiration is the process of being stimulated to creative to ignite uh uh creativity to motivate somebody that's what inspiration is so in a broad sense there's a lot of inspiration out there well why did you do that I was inspired when I saw this why are you on this very absolutely crazy diet well so and so inspired me to do it and so you find that there's different ways that we get inspired and we give vent to that inspiration and act on it but in original sense inspiration was something that was coming from the supernatural not not natural things but Supernatural inspiring the natural so that God could identify his characteristics in people and make himself known to people if you'll turn with me to Genesis chapter 1 I'd like to uh start with verse 11 and I realized now I i' meant to uh I think even in in in dealing with this particular subject it ties in in very beautifully with what was ministered Sunday morning and and how that we could just the the the foundation the building of the Prophet test and then how that God's purpose and his vision was Christ in you the hope of glory god being expressed and I think of all the sermons that have been ministered in this church I may have gotten more more positive feedback from this past weekend than any other and for me personally I feel it's one of the best sermons we've heard as a young church it was so uh inspired for the moment that we're living in right now it's very very beautiful and so I would almost say it's mandatory listening uh but it was very very encouraging and Genesis 1: 11 and 12 I know this is uh maybe my go-to or my crutch i' like to go back into the Book of Genesis and bring these things out I feel as if I was rest if I was restricted to three chapters and I could choose them I could choose Genesis chapters 1 2 and three and preach the rest of my life from them because it's just so it's the seed chapters and it says here in the middle of the creation and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth now there's a lot that's being uh expressed through these words and it could paint a a picture to where God says to this earth that exist to bring forth grass and also this herb yielding seed and also trees who have fruit and each one is going to bring forth a uh after its kind and its seed is in itself all these things that are already in the earth there something already inside of them and So speaking to it he says let them bring forth let the Earth bring forth and the Bible says and it was so that means God spoke and it happened and verse 12 gives us a little bit more color to it and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good if we could just paint this picture in our minds of God creating we come to this part here in the scripture where God now speaks to the Earth which was then existing and he says let the Earth bring forth grass let the Earth bring forth the herb yielding seed let the Earth bring forth the tree and it says that this Earth brought forth grass and the herb yielding seed brought forth after his kind and the tree that yields fruit brought after its kind whose seed for each one the seed was in itself and God saw that it was good after it was so pay careful attention to this because herein lies God's law of creation brother bam called it God's law of reproduction I it's an interesting term to use for me as I've been looking at it through the lens of Art and what you don't want when it comes to Art Is A reproduction sometimes and there's been many uh things that were not Originals passed off as reproduction and uh we I think we mentioned Thomas concade before he was uh where he was successful was in commercializing reproductions and selling them at a very very high price because he had a barn full of people who put brush Strokes on the pictures and made it look like an original but in reality a lot of it was mass-produced and I'm not just bagging on uh Thomas KC I never knew him as a brother so i' just have to go by what you read but there's these things are reproductions they're not the original and there's ways that things can be passed off as the original but here this is God's law of reproduction but not in the sense of a bad copy not in the sense of passing off something that is not original so it's not an imp uh an impersonation but it's a further expression and focus with me I think it's very important for us to look at this scripture and try to uh grasp what is actually taking place and recognize that as God says let the Earth bring forth grass and herb and and fruit from God's word is empowering the Earth with the inherent ability to bring forth life he had already put the potential in the seed and now he says let them bring forth after the seed that is in itself so when God speaks this it's not just about the physical act of producing plants or producing flower producing grass or FL fruit but it was for it was linked with purpose it had something to do with God's intent in the beginning the expression of what God had put inside in other words there was something in the earth that had not yet been made known there was something in the tree that had not been yet made known there was something in the herb uh uh plant that had not been made known and God is saying now let that come forth and when he uses the term let it would it implies permission or encouragement and so he said well let it bring forth but it's deeply connected with the idea of inspiration God is instilling in the Earth in the plant in the tree this Creative Energy to bring forth life he he he telling it go ahead and and bring forth what is in you inspiration is uh as we mentioned before in the Bible being written by inspiration it's that instilling of a spark this Breath of Life into something just like an artist who with a burst of inspiration uh begins to create something new and something beautiful God's words Infuse this Divine energy into the plant into the tree into the Earth Earth and it enables them to create and to bring forth in order to fulfill God's G their their god-given purpose has something to do with the original intent that God had when he made it and so creation if we could look at it in this sense and I'm hoping to uh create this image in your mind tonight that as God spoke and said let the Earth bring forth let the herb yielding seed bring forth let the fruit tree bring forth it was creation then responded to this divine inspiration by bearing the thing not so much what God had spoken to it but what his words had quickened that was already inside of them it brought to life that thing which was in them by the word so this when I speak of original inspiration it's this original inspiration is a motivating lifegiving force and it has this connection it's this it shows this connection even in Genesis 1: 11-2 it shows the connection between God original creation or God's will and his creation and how he has built his creation to respond to his inspiration and respond in a way that furthers what he did now if we could just read through this together without maybe stopping down for that length of time the same length of time as we did there in Genesis 1 but notice how this poetry works with Genesis 1: 26-31 and think of how God establishes this law of creation uh uh let the Earth not so much in God uh telling it to physically produce something but inspiring it to bring forth what's already in it God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so there's God saying he's going to make man he's going to make a self-portrait in man and he's going to say he says let them have and says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them here's the commission be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and God said behold now this is where I want you to uh use these words here to complete the picture of Genesis 1:1 where God is bringing forth uh every tree that has fruit on it every flowering plant every herb yielding plant all the grass continue to read where he sees he brings creeping thing over the Earth all these animals everything's being brought forth and he says to the man I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the Earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat God had created all these things God had put the life inside of them whose seed was in itself to bring forth after its kind and he inspired it he used his he spoke to it giving it this energy to bring forth and now he's saying the very man that he has created is to enjoy and partake of those things and to every beast on the earth and every foul of the air and everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is life now notice the life now has purpose it has use wherever there is life I've given every green herb for meat and it was so wherever there is life I've given it it to you to have to to control to have dominion over the Bible says and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day just as we saw God's word operating in a way upon creation to cause each seed to bring forth after its kind when God made Adam and the woman it was a similar Act of God creating and then inspiring this creation by telling them to be fruitful telling them to have dominion and as we read there in that last passage each part of creation is acting under their inspiration in harmony with God's will in order to bring forth each thing that would have use and utility to one another brother brandom in the fundamental Foundation of faith for Faith he makes this statement and it's one that I referred to quite often not sure if we've ever read it in its entirety here he says man was made a secondary God on Earth he was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth that was Adam Adam was given these great Powers so we could see Adam here in Genesis chapter 1 given these great powers to control to be fruitful to multiply and he's given power just like the tree was to bring forth fruit he and the woman were given power to bring forth as well and so he says but the power he was given to make himself is where he fell now we understand uh the original sin the power that Adam was given to make himself the power that they were given to reproduce and to create and bring forth life is where they fell he says Adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife it would obey him he could speak to the waters everything what it was everything obeyed Adam that is the beginning of man that's what God gave him power over everything on the earth and everything operated in Harmony and continuity notice God had already put the the seed in the tree and the seed in the flower and the seed in each one of these uh Creations to bring forth of their kind and to multiply and to produce and to be fruit for Adam was going to have to fight with it he was going to have to water it wasn't going to have to toil with it and struggle with it in order for it to do it it's all doing it in harmony with God's perfect will he says though man lost that power he becomes unconscious of that fact after losing his relationship and fellowship friendship fellowship with the father then he lost that so this inspiration then uh this life this power this godliness it's it's it's hidden The Originals lost butam describes it this way he all his great channels become clogged and he couldn't get through God couldn't get through to him what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that now Our Redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again to bring it back to the original and I was I had prepared to go through a number of scriptures in the New Testament that show that we are cre creations of Christ and that we are the product of a new beginning and and there's this we we are representative of that race that new race that super race and those uh those in relation to Jesus Christ but instead of going down that direction we know those things are there if we could look at it in this sense again just reviewing this God speaks his word and things start coming into being I love reading where the rabbis would have conversations in these ancient texts over the creation and because they're all trying to PA it well what came first and what happened and what's important and yet we know that when God spoke where there was nothing something came to be and God use the elements that were then to be further bring forth things together and bring things out and we see that God creates by his spoken word there's things in that creation that God begins to speak to and Inspire to come forth doesn't say that God created certain things but he actually speaks again and he tells them to bring things forth and it's God working by inspiration it's in the original in the beginning according to that plan that he had now notice this about God's word in Isaiah 55: 8-1 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord and we can all very easily say Amen his thoughts are not our thoughts his ways are not our ways there's a scripture I'd like to connect with that maybe on Sunday for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts and really if we could dig into that we'd find that we really don't know how distant they are we just know that our ways are not his our thoughts are not his and we thank God for that for as the rain cometh down and this speaks to really what he's trying to say and that his thoughts have more power and have more substance than our own vain thinking and imaginations for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth in Bud that it may give seed to the sewer and bread to the eater that's a great s sentence the rain comes down and however it comes and it does something to the earth when it comes down whether through rain or snow and that snow melt it Waters the Earth and it allows the Earth it maketh it bring forth it maketh it to Bud that in the budding and the growing and the Harvest it would give seed to the sewer and the one that sowed the seed in the harvesting it would give bread to the eater just notice all those beautiful layers in one scripture how that as the water comes down out of the Heavens to the Earth and then interacting with seed in the earth planted by a sewer and through that process of this water coming upon it it grows to a place to where one can Harvest it and put it in a for form to where it's now breed to the eater now that whole process of this uh from seed uhh uh to to bread and and as we could say maybe as as hipsters we'd say from Farm to Table that we would be able to bring this from the soil uh uh to the sour dough and now someone is going to be eating it and it's this whole process God the original artisan and notice how it says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth now there there's a lot there that I want you just to grab on to and really uh uh just say I want to I want to grab that I want to think about that the service isn't going to be ly tonight if I if I have my way it won't be lengthy I guess I don't have a plan on being long and so if it happens I can say it was God that did it or you but I want you to really focus intently because in this there's enough to grab a hold of to make a 2hour 4our roundtrip drive worth it so I really want you to think about this that God is saying my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways and then he describes an entire process that we could begin to identify in the natural that has so many different implications and different areas and different points of contact he says so shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth what would begin as a thought and then be put into action because his thoughts are not our thoughts and his ways are not our ways between the thought and the way is a word and he says not my word that goes out of my mouth it will not return void unto me written here it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereinto I sin it somebody commented on one of our videos saying watch your blood pressure when you scream the teaching gets lost so all apologies to the anonymous YouTuber is there a way that we could just modulate certain streams so it's just kind of cuts that out I don't know the technolog got to be there people can just subscribe to the LOI service so shall the word that goes out of my mouth will be just like the rain that comes down out of heaven and it it works within this overall process to go from seed to something useful it shall accomplish what I please it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sin it this is the power if we could catch this I I I was thinking in the beginning could be a real simple thought but then I begin to recognize no this is this is God's hiding in Simplicity but catch that God hides in simplicity so there's a mystery in the Simplicity he go oh well that's just really really simple and you're saying well where it's simple then God's in there somewhere and that's where people miss him so there's though it may be simple I'm saying there's something really deep that we can grab a hold of and cause us to be closely connected to God and his purpose this is the power now of the original inspiration wherein God referring to a natural process that he sets in motion under original inspiration there's something that God when he sets it in motion it must come to pass right there's this purpose of God that must be unbroken and it's embodied in that original intent that God had in the beginning where there was nothing interrupting it he created and he spoke and he said now let let it happen we said well they gave it permission he encouraged it he was trying to bring it forth he INSP ired it to do what he made it to do in job 38: 25 26 and 27 this is God speaking he says who hath divided a water course for the overflowing of waters or way for the lightning of thunder and this is in the midst of a lot of questions that God is asking job and now I want you to catch how God is speaking to job after job has spoken and now who is it it's rhetorical because we know it's God that does this to cause it to rain on the Earth where no man is on the Wilderness where there is no man to satisfy the desolate in waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herb to Spring forth who's done that God has and he's saying that where no man has been there's uh the the myth in some well they're just uh the old wives tales or the Farmers Almanac they used to think that by cultivating ground they could actually uh bring light out of the soil and bring things out of the ground and actually cause it to rain and that was their solution in a lot of places where it was Barren even here in Arizona and some of the places uh uh in the plains like well we having a drought so just disc up the ground and dig up the ground and and get it really really loose and it'll start to rain and sure enough there was just by chance sh thunderstorms and they just thought well this is how how you get rain that man has something to do with it but God says that who causes it to rain where there is no man who causes it to rain in the wilderness where there is no man where it is a desolate in waste ground but yet God causes it to rain and where man has not sewn where man has not labored he can cause the butt of the tender plant the tender herb to Spring forth who does that God did that amen and it happens according to God's original design God did not create again to cause this to happen it is what God did in Genesis 1 and 12 he put it in the creation itself that it would work according to certain times and seasons and that according to the law that was in the planter and the seed no matter how much it hybrids no matter how much it's changed no matter how much it's manipulated no matter how much it adapts to its environment there's certain forces that work upon it where no man is and it will bring forth because God has done it it's his original design it's part of his original intent now what God says here is answering to a question that job had in Job chapter 14 where he's making this observation that when a man dies he just Wast away he dies and it's desolate it's Barren he gives up The Ghost and where is he Waters uh uh fail from the sea the flood decayeth and drith up and so man just he he falls down he dies and he can't rise back up but he says this and he makes this observation about nature now I want you to make this connection God says who causes rain to come upon the Earth that would allow the butt of the Tinder herb to Spring forth and now I'm working kind of backwards let's go back to job making this observation for there is a hope of a tree if it be cut down now follow exactly what he's saying a tree has been cut down the hope of a tree that has been cut down is that it will Sprout again and that the tender Branch thereof will not cease here's a tree being cut down and he's saying there's hope in that tree that even though it's cut down their tender Branch would not uh die or fade away though the root now the the the Poetry gets even more forceful though the root thereof waxed old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground so this is quite a picture not talking about an unhealthy tree that can be nursed back to life the root is dead the stock has died but there is a hope for this tree and it says yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth bowels like a plant one translation at least there's hope for a tree if it is cut down it will Sprout again and its new choots will not fail its roots May grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil yet at the scent of water it'll bud and put forth shoots like a plant what was it that God is saying in Chapter 30 uh 38 what what was God saying who causes the tree that is cut down to be able to say There's Hope what would allow a tree whose root is dead and stock has died yet through some process the Bible says the scent of water the tree think of this how remarkable this is the tree has the potential to be revived with the scent the fragrance the aroma of water I believe it said that way for a reason it doesn't even speak of a deluge of water it doesn't speak of sprinkling of water it says the scent of water that the tree has hope and so God's original inspiration is so bound into creation that it causes it to be resilient that even though its root has died and its stock has died as well that it knows that even at the aroma or the scent of water there is hope of life that God in his original creation under this original inspiration it can hope for life despite death despite the worst circumstances there's potential to bring forth for restoration and Redemption and the scent of water they say that perfume is the art of time travel the art of traveling because through the scent it can cause you to uh conjure emotions and feelings and see things and be places it's a very powerful uh sense the sense of sense this B God is answering to Job saying you've observed it in nature who does that God does through the scent of water There's Hope through the working of water There's Hope under God's original inspiration catch it just in creation the tree in the beginning was inspired to bring forth fruit and that original inspiration is so Bound in that tree that job can say you can cut it down its root can die its trunk can die but yet there's something inside of it through the scent of water it has hope that it can be bring forth again it will bud and bring forth a fruitful bow under God's original inspiration there's power in his creation there's power too it's it's inherent in his design the Earth brought forth grass the trees brought forth fruit each one in turn bringing forth herbs and fruits and this innate ability that was inside of them and as I've been studying on this and I realized not it's not necessary maybe to go through entire sermons on this but let me just point to it it's not the process of manufacturing something it's the act of expressing through inspiration am this is the the danger that we often identify through some of the the way that we approach the word is there's always this way where we can uh try to put on erors or the Optics of something but if we are inspired we can bring forth something new and in doing so it's not producing something that's already been that's what inspiration we say something's original inspiration it's not mimicking or copying something else and so it's to bring forth this what what we're to do is not to manufacture something but to bring forth something in order to bring it forth there's got to be something that's uncovered just as creation buds it it buds the nature that was instilled in it we too have to we have to be disciplined are in tune to that inspiration so that we can let it come and this is the part that I I want to emphasize that we're all very familiar with sheep do not manufacture wool am it's not they don't they don't study the process they don't uh examine the pores they don't look they're not researching and trying to figure out all these different ways so that they can make their their wool uh more beautiful they just bear the wool it doesn't manufacture it it Bears it that's a sheep's creative act so as long as it's uh healthy it's bearing wool it's their work of art it's something innate inside of them let every seed bring forth of its kind let it express its characteristics Let It Be identified by its characteristics according to the life that's inside of it and brother Bram using the principle that sheep uh bear wool according to the life that's inside them they don't manufacture it he says and when you're a Christian you'll cope with the word I don't care what anybody else says you don't have to work up nothing and bring nothing down Pull pump up you are a Christian amen says in another place we're not asked to manufacture something we're asked to Bear the fruit of the spirit the inside of the sheep what he is on the inside makes the wool on the outside and when a man's got Christ on the inside it makes him Christlike on the outside not some artificial put on Amen this is the this is the important uh connection now to what God has place in his original creation by inspiration and by inspiration is to express itself we cannot try to manufacture what God has designed us to Bear we cannot try to produce through a process of manufa facturing and industrialize the world and find market inefficiencies and figure out a ways so that we can begin to Bear the image of Christ through a manufactured process that's artificial that's a put on right that's a cheap knockoff and the world may buy it but that's not what God's looking for in 1 Peter chapter 2:9 but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light in darkness you can't be seen now he's put you in light so he can exhibit you you're on display that you should show forth it means to tell out or for to tell forth to declare abroad it means to publish to make known by proclamation now we might think that this has something to do with our words that you should show forth the Praises of him the Praises means The Virtuous course of thought The Virtuous feelings therefore these thoughts that are his thoughts in the ways that are his ways you are to show forth his thoughts in your actions it's moral Excellence is what it refers to this modesty and Purity that you would Proclaim and publish God virtuous thoughts that you are called out of Darkness into light so that you as a chosen generation a royal P priesthood and a holy nation as Kings and Priests your lives would be an exhibit of the thoughts of God that are higher than our thoughts the ways of God that are higher than our ways but yet it has to come into the channel of human beings that our lives would show forth his moral Excellence that we could declare and publish and make known that there could be a Proclamation and expression of God's thoughts and feelings and actions in the sermon Christ identified the same in all generations I think I have this statement there you notice some of you may recognize this work of art it was part of a series I think it was Anne mcferson talbet she did some of the art before she was married then she married and it's very hard to find uh the collection together but she did that I can count six different uh Parts different numbers about Christ her title was Christ revealed in his own words does that ring a bell and and this was a very popular at a time when brother brandham uh was ministering and and he's he points out kind of this imagery here's Christ being reflected in The Sermon on the Mount and it's Christ uh uh uh the Beatitudes Christ and the Beatitudes a numbered part of Christ revealed in his own words and so she used the the method of art to where she's writing out the words of the scripture and highlighting certain portions to where Christ is the image of Christ is seeing and this is modeled after uh Christ at 33 by Hoffman here he is in the picture Christ revealed in his own word and brother randam is using that theme in some of these sermons about Christ uh being identified through his characteristics and here Christ identified the same in all generations he says he's Eternal he's the only source of eternal life there is is in God our Father he's Eternal himself now therefore if we have eternal life we have part of God in us and God in us if he isn't then that's the only way you could have eternal life it isn't something that was manufactured then given to you by some Creed or you lived into it you grew into a better man or a better woman notice the subtlety of the thought that you've got to earn uh certain platitudes or earn your way to certain things God gives you the life the new birth as a testament of your faith he says it's God himself in you just like you are a part of your father here on Earth you're a part of your heavenly father in what you are you're the attribute of his thoughts of you before the foundation of the world you are expressed he had to breed it in and everything to get what you are to make you what you are now that's a mouthful but notice how he says he's had to breed it into you to make you what you are just as you're an expression by a natural Union here on Earth you are an expression of your father's attributes and he says it's not something you manufacture if the life is in you you live the life if you had the life of the artist you'd create art if you had the light knife life of a well if you had the knife of a knife wielder you'd knife people you had the life of a gunslinger you would shoot there's different things that you would do based upon the nature that's inside of you it's not manufactured amen it's something part of the original inspiration where you bring it forth now as I bring this to a close I want to use an example I this just expresses an example of what I'm saying Luke chapter 19: 28- 40 just gather these things into your heart take from it some principle and it might seem to be somewhat abstract but we can take everything we just ministered on this simple principle of God putting something an ability in something a skill that's what art is it speaks of skill there's something in the creation and by inspiration it produces it expresses itself the light shines on it it reflects it shows something there's this principle that something can be so found up in God's original design that certain forces as we see a nature of just water working upon it brings forth and it expresses now with that principle watch it here how it works in in an actual scenario in Luke chapter 19: 28 to 40 and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to Jerusalem and it came to pass when he was nigh to Beth Page and Bethany at the mount called the Mount of Olives he sent two of his disciples saying go ye into the village over against you in the which at you entering ye shall find a cult tide where on yet never sat man man sat loose him and bring him hither and if any man ask you why do you loose him thus shall you say unto him because the Lord hath need of him and they went that were sent went their way and they found even as he had said unto them and as they were loosing the Colt the owners thereof said unto them why Loosey the cult he had already told them that they'd be asked that very thing and they said the Lord hath need of him and they brought him to Jesus and they now and they cast their garments upon the colt and they set Jesus thereon now the scenes been set follow and as he went Christ they spread their clothes in the way and when he was come nigh even now at The Descent of the Mount of Olives the whole multitude of the disciples begin to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest now if we could somehow find our minds in this scene that Jesus is nearing Jerusalem and he tells his disciples to go and find a a a cult and that has never been ridden by man and take them and not necessarily steal it but say the master has need of it it unfolds just exactly as he says and now seemingly without any other prompting other than he has set upon this cult and he went they began to spread clothes in the way the Bible is so specific as to tell us where he was and the moment he was in it and where they were going to go and that what the nature of the cult was and what the owner would say when they got there and what they were to say back and now without any prompting or foretelling here they begin to put their garments in the way as he's riding on this CT and now as he comes nigh the whole multitude begins to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for the works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest notice this unction of Praise that was being expressed and then immediately and some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him Master rebuke thy disciples and he answered and said unto them I tell you that if the these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out Ponder that for a second if the disciples and those in the way had not responded as they were he said the stones would have immediately shouted had they not under that inspiration of praising him for what they had seen something had to express it something would have create something would have had to shout loudly and Proclaim and we might say well this is just Jesus and his tendency to embellish and this is just Jesus uh may be trying to use hyperbole to get their attention no had they kept their mouth shut there's something about God's word when it's fulfilled that there must be a sounding there must be an expression there must be something come forth when God fulfills his promised word it's not something though it may be done in secret though may be something done in mystery though God's may be word may be coming to pass in such a way to the world misses it but there must be those who respond with praise there must be those that respond with an expression and a showing forth amen for the Bible said maybe I can say this way in the original inspiration this original inspiration the time had come for its fulfillment so something had to identify it and Zechariah 9:9 Rejoice greatly oh Daughter of Zion shout oh daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto thee this is what they're responding to he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a CT the foul of an ass Rejoice this exaltation a celebration to do it so abundantly exceedingly to shout it's to raise a sound to show forth the Praises of him the Bible told them told the daughters of Zion to Rejoice greatly the Bible said that they were to shout the daughters of Jerusalem were to shout when their King came riding upon a cold this is what they were supposed to do and that's why Jesus said had it not happened had the people not done it the Rocks would have cried out because God's word cannot return void amen the the the land would have cried that it's not just any Rock but the rocks of Jerusalem would have cried out and would have uttered under inspiration of the original creation they would have cried out at the satisfaction of this I love that song Ain't No Stone going to praise in my place right I'm not going to let something else take my place the stones don't need to cry out I can be a Living Testament I can be a living Stone it was the original inspiration that caused those people to declare to shout and to praise it had to come to pass in the sermon hear ye himm brother Bram says my people according the Bible my people shall never be ashamed he said how they're fully Able by the inspiration of God to declare Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God who's just the same yesterday today and forever and if the old time Pentecostal blessing that fell in ad33 is just as good today and inspires men just the same today as it did then it and it brings the same results regardless of critics and what people have to say it'll do that because inspiration will always bring it if the word is put in Inspiration then the results have to come when the word is put in inspiration brother bam talks about getting in the inspiration of it in this hour in this time in this season Brothers come to your instruments and the the sermon why little Bethlehem at the end of 63 says forgive me if I hurt you I'm doing this in the name of the Lord Jesus come back stand you Gallant man who see David standing Yonder Jesus Christ a fugitive from his church barred out by their Creeds there's a fresh Fountain hanging Yonder there is power to make this word live again it's prophesied in this day to come to pass God said it would come to pass it's got to come to pass amen it has to yes I you say well I don't know brother Aaron it's looking awfully dark if the stones have to do it the stones have to cry out somebody's going to do it has to happen you'll never do it in an army you're in Now You Garen yourself Pentecost right around with the rest of the organizations cutting into a Creed you can see he's showing what is stifling the inspiration what is causing them to be cheap knockoffs to just mimic and play the part but he said there's power to make this word live again it will come to pass if the word is put in Inspiration the results have to come I was reading in a book on on art that said said it this way thought it was very interesting I was going to use it earlier and I just I actually just completely left it out and then I just made a copy of this right before I left and was making they they quoted from Ecclesiastes and it just says that these there are certain to every season there's a time and it's this principle that maybe Sunday we'll pick up on it that we don't set the Rhythm go you know study what brother BR said about the symphony and the Rhythm and the conductor of the beat uh we don't set that but but we're all we're all in the process and really foreshadowing some things POS possibly we're all in the process of being conducted amen and he says if you have an idea you're excited about and you don't bring it to life he's just talking about the natural world this is not in any way related to God but it's just natural art by human through human expression he said if you have an idea that you're excited about and you don't bring it to life it's not uncommon for the idea to find its Voice through another maker and that's what happened to all of us with the iPhone if you have an idea that you're excited by it's not it's common that if you don't bring it to life someone does he said this isn't because the other artist stole your idea but because the ideas time has come this great unfolding ideas and thoughts themes and songs and other works of art exist in The Ether in rip and on schedule ready to find expression in the physical world he has translated according to Ecclesiastes 3 something is part of God's divine plan in watching it happen according to man's natural progress in life and according to the rhythm of creation in natural life that there's times where there's this great unfolding of ideas because they were there it said kind of in The Ether and they ripen on schedule that that that they come to life in a time that it was ready they time to find their expression in the physical world and just as it would in the natural world as people look at things and oh here's an idea that it comes into being God's inspiration must find a voice amen it must be published amen when the time has come nothing can stop it from coming forth they call the great unfolding of ideas and thoughts but it's the great unfolding of God's purpose yes ready to find expression in the physical world the time has come you can take that just that way of phrasing and say well that's what brother bradam is trying to get us to see the time has come and it's according to the original inspiration his or what he originally intended by the word is how it's going to come forth could you stand with me and pray just pray a prayer with us tonight as we dismiss you keep these things close to your heart I tried to make it as simple as I possibly could and I realize that you may be looking at it saying well that's really really really really really simple brother erid but it has endless application to the things of God to you who are his sons and daughters there is something inside of you that must Express itself and all your Melancholy and all your waywardness is going to come back to the fact that that's not happening that's not being expressed it's got to come forth let's bow our heads in [Music] prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight as we are in your presence we're needy we're needy for it Lord we need your presence Lord we sing songs of it pouring down like rain and truly as we see in the word of God that as the rain rain would come forth and water the Earth and snow that would melt would find its way into to cross the ground and water would find its path across the Earth it would water a seed that's been sewn by a sewer cause it to grow to a place of harvest then in being harvested it would go through a process to where it becomes bread and in that image from seed to loaf you said your words the same way that you've spoken it and it will not return void so much so that in natural life there's a power bound up inside of it that if it can come in contact with the scent of water there's the hope of being revived if we want it to die if we want it to no longer be able to have life we would chop it up we would cause it to dry we put it in a Kil we'd burn it we'd cause it use it for a heat Source uh to Forever Vanquish its ability but that tree though dead and its root and its stomp Wayne and dried up said at the scent of water There's Hope and you reminded job that that's that's not man that does that it's you that can do that Lord I believe that in this hour we have more than just the scent of water but we have a rain that is falling former and latter we have a power that's given to the church and Lord let us rise up on that power may we use it Lord I know that I keep preaching things in general and maybe in the abstract and there's things that are very very concrete that relate to this but and Lord maybe I want to move further into different things and it just keeps getting repeated and Lord if it's my own my own life that's impeding father I want to get out of the way to let your voice be heard I don't want a stone singing in my place and to think that under the original inspiration there's something to how you originally meant it something bound up in the prophecy that when the word comes an inspiration it will bring forth exactly as you said it would the Rocks were quiet on that day because there was a people that were inspired when their King came we too in this hour have seen you revealed in your word Christ identified in his characteristics Christ revealed in his own word may we show forth your moral Excellence may we show forth your virtue not in a portrait of days gone by but today 2025 a life that can hide the Simplicity of Christ for others to see we commit ourselves to you tonight we love you we thank you so much for your goodness we ask all the in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
