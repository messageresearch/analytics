[0:01] just thankful for the the Lord that he's
[0:04] always mindful. He always knows
[0:05] everything that we have need of. Even
[0:07] sometimes if we don't know what we have
[0:08] need of, he knows. Uh and he's more than
[0:12] able to take care of all our needs at
[0:14] any time. And so we just appreciate
[0:17] that. We are so thankful for the Lord
[0:19] that he does these things for us that he
[0:22] keeps us uh even in strong trials, even
[0:25] in bitter times, even through the things
[0:28] that we don't even know that we're
[0:30] doing. Um sometimes you you get down the
[0:33] road in your life and you realize that
[0:35] maybe the things that you thought were
[0:38] going well or things that were, you
[0:40] know, everything was handled and
[0:41] everything was good and then you come to
[0:42] a point you realize, well, I guess it
[0:44] wasn't. Like I I guess I maybe got off
[0:47] the track here or got off the track
[0:48] there, but the Lord always knows and he
[0:50] can always bring us back to center
[0:52] &gt;&gt; because I think the middle of the road
[0:54] is where we want to be. That's where we
[0:55] try and live our life. And if you're a
[0:57] driver, of course, you don't want to be
[0:59] right down the center of the road where
[1:01] the split is, but you know what I'm
[1:03] saying? You want to be center of your
[1:04] lane
[1:05] &gt;&gt; because it gives you opportunity to to
[1:06] to veer where whichever way you need to
[1:09] to correct or to if you know something
[1:12] approaches we can handle that certain
[1:14] thing especially when it's a sudden
[1:16] thing. It allows you that opportunity to
[1:19] correct whatever we need to. So the
[1:20] closer they are to the middle the better
[1:22] off that we are. Um if you want to take
[1:24] your Bibles at second Timothy
[1:28] we're going to read scripture that we
[1:29] read the last time that we were with
[1:31] you.
[1:34] a preaching. I mean, I was here in the
[1:38] service, but not up here in the pulpit.
[1:40] So,
[1:42] and we're going to have two readings
[1:44] actually out of second Timothy. Lord
[1:46] willing, this time I got it right on the
[1:48] on the PowerPoint. Uh I'm not gifted at
[1:51] PowerPoint. Uh but I try. So, um I was
[1:56] never a PowerPoint preacher until I came
[1:58] here. Uh and then was introduced to it
[2:01] and
[2:02] uh doing my best. So uh if you can
[2:05] forgive my failures on that point uh and
[2:08] for last time being so uh how do I want
[2:12] to say a lot of anxiety because I had a
[2:15] lot going on at one time and then also
[2:17] preaching and preaching if you've never
[2:19] done it and I I don't know if there's
[2:21] any other preachers here this evening.
[2:23] Guess there maybe some but if you've
[2:26] never done it some people think like
[2:27] public speaking is an easy thing. I can
[2:30] tell you that when I was a kid, um I
[2:33] actually avoided public speaking at all
[2:35] costs. Was a very good speller and uh my
[2:40] English teacher was very frustrated with
[2:42] me because I would always wait until
[2:44] there was only a few candidates left and
[2:46] then I would misspell a word because
[2:48] they weren't going to get me up in front
[2:49] of an audience to spell anything. There
[2:51] was no way I was going to do it. That I
[2:54] when I did plays, there were speaking
[2:56] parts in the play. I never took one of
[2:57] them. And in fact, I was so nervous uh
[3:00] not having a speaking part that one time
[3:02] I pushed somebody right off the stage
[3:04] because I was trying to get off the
[3:05] stage myself quickly. So I still have
[3:08] that, you know, that's a part of me, but
[3:10] by the grace of God, he took that away
[3:13] to the point where now I can speak and
[3:14] I've spoken before probably hundreds,
[3:18] maybe thousand um before in other
[3:20] countries. Um so I'm grateful for that.
[3:24] And just, you know, for the young
[3:25] people, you might have things that right
[3:28] now seem like a struggle, but it doesn't
[3:30] mean that you're always going to stay in
[3:32] that place. And even for us old people,
[3:34] &gt;&gt; we might feel like we have struggles,
[3:36] but it doesn't mean that you're going to
[3:37] stay in that place because God is
[3:39] mindful of the struggle that you're
[3:41] going through. And he knows. Now, that's
[3:43] not our sermon tonight, but still, I
[3:44] feel led to say God is mindful.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; So, if you're going through a battle
[3:49] this evening, it's okay. God's mindful.
[3:51] But we're going to actually go in the
[3:52] sermon this evening a different
[3:54] direction. So 2 Timothy 1:es 13 to 14.
[3:59] And it says, "Hold fast the form of
[4:01] sound words which thou has heard of me
[4:03] in faith and love which is in Christ
[4:06] Jesus that good things which was
[4:09] committed that good thing which was
[4:10] committed unto thee keep by the Holy
[4:13] Ghost which dwelleth in us." and then uh
[4:17] to the second chapter, same book uh also
[4:21] in Timothy.
[4:23] And then we're going to read verses 14
[4:25] and 15.
[4:27] And it says this says, "Of these things,
[4:30] put them in remembrance, charging them
[4:32] before the Lord, that they strive not
[4:33] about words to no profit, but to the
[4:35] subverting of the hearers. Study to show
[4:38] thyself approved unto God, a workman
[4:40] that needeth not be ashamed, rightly
[4:41] dividing the word of truth." So, let's
[4:43] just bow our heads for a word of prayer.
[4:46] Heavenly Father, we're thankful for this
[4:47] opportunity, Lord, to gather in your
[4:49] name, Father, to come and worship you,
[4:53] Lord. And we would that every time that
[4:55] we worship you, Father, it's from the
[4:57] depths of our heart, Father, realizing
[5:00] what great grace that we live under and
[5:02] that we've been made a part of, Lord.
[5:04] And we just appreciate everything that
[5:05] you've done for us, Father. We thank you
[5:08] for the songs that have been sung, for
[5:09] the folks that have gathered this
[5:11] evening, for the ones that are
[5:12] traveling. We pray that you'd bless
[5:13] them, Lord. May their time away from
[5:16] Arizona be a real refreshing time for
[5:19] them. Just bless our pastor. Pray that
[5:21] you'd keep him in all that he's doing,
[5:23] Lord. And Father, for the furtherance of
[5:26] this service, we just ask right now that
[5:28] you would take control of anything
[5:29] that's done, Lord, that we just commit
[5:31] it to you. Ask the Holy Ghost to come
[5:33] rule and reign in us this evening,
[5:35] Father. And we commit this now into your
[5:36] hands. We ask in Jesus name. God bless
[5:38] you. You can be seated.
[5:42] I never know if you should say take your
[5:44] seats because I if I say that I'm not
[5:45] sure where you're going to take them to.
[5:47] So we try not to actually go down that
[5:49] uh particular road. So um this evening
[5:54] I'm going to go through a number of
[5:55] things before I actually probably get
[5:57] into the depth of what I'm trying to
[5:59] convey. So excuse me.
[6:03] But we want to um speak tonight on the
[6:05] subject of tethered.
[6:08] And uh as you've seen before, I talk
[6:11] about astronauts and it's because we're
[6:12] in the astronaut age. Brother Brandham
[6:14] declared that we understand that we're
[6:16] in an astronaut age and there are
[6:17] special things about astronauts that
[6:19] nobody else does. And uh you know
[6:23] astronauts have the ability to get out
[6:25] of this atmosphere during the time of
[6:28] COVID. Guess what? They didn't have to
[6:29] worry about it because they were out of
[6:31] this atmosphere. They were somewhere
[6:33] else. And so while we got to spend our
[6:35] days suffering through the, you know,
[6:38] snotty noses and everything else, they
[6:41] didn't have to deal with that. An
[6:42] astronaut actually when they're out in
[6:45] space, they're not actually subject to
[6:48] gravity, at least not like we are,
[6:50] because they can get out and float all
[6:52] around. They've got some freedom going
[6:54] on. And so that's why we're talking
[6:56] about tethered this evening is that
[6:58] astronaut gets some freedom. And when he
[7:01] gets freedom, he's got to be tethered to
[7:03] that ship. So now the ship can be
[7:06] tethered to the the Earth by
[7:09] communication, but typically the
[7:10] astronaut is tethered actually by what
[7:12] you see there, that little red belt that
[7:14] he's wearing to keep him, make sure he
[7:16] stays with the ship. And now on Earth,
[7:19] we can uh if we have like a Tesla, we
[7:22] can go really fast, right? At least from
[7:25] the start to whatever's legal uh fairly
[7:28] quickly. Astronauts, they say, travel
[7:30] about 17,500 miles per hour if they're
[7:33] on the space station. You try and do
[7:35] that here and you would be undressed
[7:37] quickly because when you're in this
[7:39] atmosphere, it changes things. But
[7:42] there, you're completely covered, you're
[7:43] completely dressed, you're completely
[7:45] protected, and you're connected to
[7:47] something. And so, and with brother
[7:49] Brandham declaring that, he he, you
[7:51] know, through his ministry, there was
[7:53] always something that um brought out
[7:56] nature. And he would talk about, you
[7:58] know, rabbits and what they would do and
[8:00] we would he would talk about the trees
[8:02] and the law of the seed and how you
[8:04] could bring all these things and he
[8:05] would talk about nature. And then when
[8:07] he got actually toward the end of his
[8:09] ministry and the astronaut age had
[8:11] kicked off, he brought in how natural
[8:13] things that were occurring with man
[8:15] would actually show you that there's
[8:17] things going on with believers at the
[8:19] same time. And and you know the story
[8:21] where he used the, you know, the horse
[8:23] and the car and and so on. So we're not
[8:25] going to go back through that.
[8:27] But anyway, so just so that we
[8:29] understand for the young people and I
[8:31] don't I don't know if they still have
[8:32] tether ball. They had it a lot when I
[8:34] was a kid. But to be tethered to
[8:36] something, it means that there's
[8:38] something that connects something
[8:39] movable to something fixed for security
[8:42] or to limit movement. So the old tether
[8:45] ball, you had the lovely line that held
[8:48] the tether ball on there. And I can tell
[8:50] you if you ever hit the tether ball off,
[8:52] uh it would be painful if it hit you. Uh
[8:54] because you didn't want it. In fact, it
[8:56] was painful sometimes if it was
[8:57] tethered. But if it wasn't tethered and
[8:59] that thing came off of there and whacked
[9:01] somebody, it was a pretty good pretty
[9:03] good whack. And back in the day when I
[9:04] played tether ball, they used to have a
[9:06] little knob on the top of the thing. And
[9:08] you never wanted to hit that knob
[9:10] because if you hit now, they they hide
[9:12] it in the ball, which is really awesome.
[9:14] But in those days, they didn't hide it
[9:15] in the ball. So, and a tether ball looks
[9:17] kind of like a soccer ball, but you
[9:19] don't really want to play soccer with it
[9:20] because if you hit that thing that's
[9:21] buried or, you know, standing out on the
[9:23] thing, it's it's not great. So, you want
[9:25] it to stay tethered to the pole because
[9:27] it's staying tethered to something. It
[9:29] can move. It can do things, right? But
[9:31] it needs to stay tethered to the pole in
[9:33] order for the game to be played, in
[9:36] order for that to take place. So, uh, I
[9:39] just want to do just a little bit of
[9:40] review because we talked before, um,
[9:43] about water and I wanted to make sure
[9:46] that we conveyed to the saints and I I
[9:48] think every most everybody was here the
[9:50] last time. I'm not sure if some were
[9:52] missing or not, but water lives in three
[9:55] states and most of us are used to it in
[9:57] our house. We have got a solid, um,
[9:59] we've got a a liquid and we've got vapor
[10:02] or gas and we kind of take it for
[10:05] granted because we're used to it. It's
[10:06] always there. it kind of, you know, it
[10:08] it's just there, right? And water can do
[10:11] great things. We've got a, you know,
[10:12] we've got one of the seven wonders of
[10:14] the world sitting in our state up north
[10:15] that got a fire going, too. But we still
[10:18] got the Grand Canyon, right? And we've
[10:19] got all kinds of beautiful things in
[10:20] Arizona that you can go to related to
[10:22] water, oddly enough, in a desert. We
[10:24] still got it. Um, but within water, and
[10:27] again, we're reviewing what we went
[10:29] through before. Within water, there's
[10:30] something locked inside of it. And
[10:33] there's three parts to it. And those
[10:36] three parts um become if you separate
[10:39] them out, it's hydrogen and oxygen. And
[10:42] what most people don't realize is like
[10:44] firefighters, we put out fires with
[10:46] water. But the odd thing is you're
[10:48] putting out a fire with water. But
[10:50] inside of that thing that you're putting
[10:51] out, that water is putting out a fire is
[10:54] the potential for a great fire. It's
[10:57] always there. It's always present. But
[10:59] you have to have a power to separate it
[11:01] somehow. And man's come up with a way to
[11:04] do that. God always had a way to
[11:06] separate it. So he, you know, he didn't
[11:07] have to worry about it. But man has come
[11:09] up with a way to do that. And so this,
[11:11] it's really hard to tell what that is,
[11:15] but
[11:16] of course firefighter, so I'm using a
[11:18] firefighter thing, but this is what they
[11:20] call a nasal canula. So it's one of
[11:22] these lovely pieces of apparatus that
[11:24] you see here. And the first picture,
[11:27] they've lit this lovely tube. And the
[11:30] thing is is that it only stays lit for
[11:32] not long. So that at that's that's
[11:35] catching it just before it goes out
[11:37] because you put fire to it and once you
[11:39] take the fire away, it doesn't continue
[11:41] to burn. It's just the material that it
[11:43] is. It likes to go out. So it needs some
[11:45] kind of heat source, something to keep
[11:47] it going. The next picture is when they
[11:50] put oxygen through this same tube. So I
[11:53] can tell you and I'm sure Josh could
[11:54] tell you the same thing. I I've told
[11:55] multiple people and unfortunately some
[11:57] of them are no longer with us. You can't
[11:59] smoke and have one of these on your face
[12:02] that has oxygen because you you you are
[12:06] getting something that's going to make
[12:08] fire burn much more rapidly. Now, the
[12:12] oxygen is not burning, but it makes this
[12:13] stuff burn great. If it's got any
[12:15] flammability to it at all, oxygen will
[12:17] will do an amazing thing to it. And
[12:19] that's what you see with that next
[12:20] picture. Now, it's not always like that,
[12:22] but I wanted to show you just the
[12:24] difference. Same same tube. Only
[12:26] difference is they're putting some
[12:27] oxygen through here. So some air like
[12:30] the air we breathe only more
[12:31] concentrated. So there's more of it in a
[12:33] smaller space. And then the last picture
[12:36] is just of of a hydrogen bomb. So
[12:39] oxygen, hydrogen, you've got a lot of
[12:42] power locked into that. And I want you
[12:43] to understand there's a lot of power
[12:45] locked into the word too.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; A lot of power. And just like in the
[12:52] natural, we can use that power for great
[12:55] things, but if you're not careful, if
[12:57] you don't use it properly, you can
[13:00] actually cause problems.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; And you can cause severe problems. Now,
[13:05] the power that's in hydrogen and oxygen,
[13:08] just like what's in the word, when that
[13:10] word is rightly divided and used
[13:12] appropriately, you can put Satan to run.
[13:14] You can you like the brothers back in
[13:17] the in the uh east like to say booevil.
[13:20] Now you don't hear it too much here, but
[13:22] you can say booevil because you've got
[13:23] the ability to put him on the run.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; That's actually what it'll do. And so um
[13:29] sorry for a long I guess that was a long
[13:31] review. I was going to do a short one.
[13:33] Um, but anyways, the there's so much
[13:38] power locked in and sometimes we take it
[13:40] for granted because we've got a Bible,
[13:42] we read the Bible, we see things and and
[13:44] we understand partly that there's power,
[13:46] but sometimes you can take for granted
[13:47] just what's locked in there and what
[13:49] dividing that word properly will do for
[13:51] you. So, um, we understand this from the
[13:55] the word that the Bible and this is a
[13:58] quote from Christ is revealed in his own
[14:00] word. The Bible is the complete
[14:02] revelation of Jesus Christ and it was
[14:03] wrote by prophets. I think we know that
[14:06] um God who in Sunday times spake to the
[14:08] fathers by the prophets in this last day
[14:10] speaks to us through his son Jesus
[14:12] Christ which was the prophets all of
[14:14] them put together. Jesus was Malachi.
[14:16] Jesus was Jeremiah, Isaiah, Elijah. All
[14:18] that they were in him and all that you
[14:20] are and all I am is in him words
[14:23] witnesses of the word. So that's us
[14:26] saints. And he goes on to say, "So it is
[14:28] not a book of systems, a code of moral
[14:30] ethics. Neither is it a history book or
[14:32] a book of theology. It is not. But it's
[14:35] a revelation of Jesus Christ, God
[14:36] himself revealed from word to flesh." So
[14:40] we understand that the the revelation of
[14:44] Jesus Christ isn't just that we can read
[14:46] a book and understand that baptism
[14:49] should be in the name of the Lord Jesus
[14:50] Christ or we can read a book and
[14:52] understand that you know the gifts of
[14:54] the spirit are available to us or we can
[14:55] read a book and understand that you know
[14:58] that the Catholic Church is you know
[15:00] mother harlot. That's not it. What the
[15:04] word is is to actually tether you.
[15:08] Actually, this is what you're tethered
[15:09] to is that word by the Holy Ghost. And
[15:11] that tether holds you to that word. And
[15:14] then the word has the opportunity to
[15:17] take it from just a revelation of here
[15:21] and to change the heart. And it makes it
[15:24] to where we can actually become
[15:26] something greater than than we've ever
[15:28] been.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; Because locked in you, each one of us,
[15:31] is a greater power than you can even
[15:34] realize. If you've got the Holy Ghost
[15:36] tethered to the word,
[15:37] &gt;&gt; there's something that can unlock great
[15:39] things.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; And we're going to get into this just a
[15:42] little bit more as we go along, but we
[15:45] understand that God did all these things
[15:47] for a purpose. And so now, Brother
[15:49] Brandham talked about how God actually
[15:51] wrote the the what we call the Bible
[15:54] today. Wrote his word first in the
[15:56] heavens. And so, we had the zodiac and
[15:58] he's written that word in the zodiac.
[16:00] And then after that, he had it in the
[16:02] pyramids. And then eventually he got it
[16:05] to where it was in in in the word form
[16:07] or on paper form where people could pass
[16:09] it on. Now initially they passed things
[16:11] on just you know God told me this. I'm
[16:13] going to tell you this right? But
[16:15] eventually they got to where they could
[16:16] write it down. So that we understand
[16:18] that scrolls are a little bit different
[16:20] than the Bible that you have today. But
[16:22] that's the way that the word was
[16:24] written. And then eventually we get to
[16:26] where the Bible is is what we're seeing.
[16:28] So
[16:30] we have those different steps of what
[16:33] God has done. So now we have our Bible,
[16:35] we have the scripture and brother
[16:37] Brandham says this in the latest
[16:40] churches says in the dark ages the word
[16:42] was almost entirely lost to the people
[16:44] but God sent Luther with the word. The
[16:47] Lutheran spoke for God at that time but
[16:49] the organized and again the pure word
[16:51] was lost for organization tends toward
[16:53] dogma and creeds and not simple word.
[16:56] They could no longer speak for God. Then
[16:59] God sent Wesley and he was the voice
[17:01] with the word of his in his day. Sorry.
[17:04] And the people who took his revelation
[17:05] from God became the living epistles read
[17:07] and known of all men for their
[17:09] generation. When the Methodists failed,
[17:11] God raised up others. And so it has gone
[17:13] on through the years until in this last
[17:15] days there is again another people in
[17:17] the land who under their messenger will
[17:19] be the final voice to the final age.
[17:21] Excuse me, my voice is a little bit dry
[17:24] this evening. It's Arizona. So, in fact,
[17:27] if you have water, feel free to take a
[17:28] drink.
[17:31] Um,
[17:33] so we understand that there's a lot of
[17:35] things that have come through history
[17:37] and and I I want to tell you, as you
[17:38] know, I try and do Wednesday nights so
[17:40] that at least the young people get
[17:41] something, the kids get something out of
[17:43] it as well. And so, the next few slides,
[17:45] if it's too silly for you or too too I'm
[17:47] sorry, adults, the vintage youth, if
[17:49] it's too too basic for you, it's okay.
[17:52] you'll survive because I can tell you
[17:54] that the kids sit through a lot of
[17:55] things that's way up here and they
[17:57] survive. So we as adults can sometimes
[18:00] have things simple. It's okay. So
[18:03] remember it's for the children. Okay? So
[18:05] it's for the children but what happened
[18:09] through the ages is that the word has a
[18:13] problem and it's not the problem of the
[18:15] word but it's the problem is is that
[18:17] people get involved in it and you know
[18:20] um my daughter had a a has a shirt I
[18:22] think maybe still but she has a shirt
[18:24] that says um I'm a I was a people person
[18:27] until people ruined it and that's kind
[18:30] of how it goes right because you know
[18:33] there were men of
[18:35] that quote unquote were men of God and
[18:36] then they ruined the the title men of
[18:39] God because they started to take dogma
[18:42] and creeds. In other words, they had
[18:43] these ideas of their own, not from the
[18:46] word, but they're like, "Oh, this must
[18:48] mean this, so I'm going to change it a
[18:49] little bit." And eventually, they took
[18:51] control of it. So, what it did was it
[18:53] took the Bible or the scrolls or
[18:55] whatever it was at the time, and it made
[18:56] it just like the book was black to
[18:58] people. In other words, like you would
[19:01] see it like this. like I I could look at
[19:03] the book, but there's nothing that I'm
[19:05] going to get from it because my eyes are
[19:07] are covered. In fact, it would be just
[19:10] like you put a blindfold on somebody.
[19:12] So, the word's still there. The word's
[19:14] still golden. It's still got power. It's
[19:16] still got what it needs, but there's not
[19:18] a way to tap into it because so much has
[19:22] been mixed up and messed up and colored
[19:24] and and they've just darkened it so
[19:26] badly. In fact, and for the adults,
[19:29] you'll know this that under under dogmas
[19:32] and creeds, millions of people have been
[19:34] killed
[19:36] &gt;&gt; just because somebody had an idea of
[19:37] this was the word. And I'm telling you
[19:40] what the word is. In fact, I so I was
[19:42] raised Roman Catholic. And one of the
[19:43] things in the Catholic church that they
[19:45] didn't really teach was read your Bible.
[19:47] You would never hear that. I I didn't
[19:49] even know hardly there was a Bible
[19:51] because we had a thing called a monthly
[19:52] mislet. And the monthly mistlet would
[19:55] teach you whatever you needed to know.
[19:56] There were three readings. There's going
[19:58] to be two from uh there'll be I think it
[20:00] was two from uh two letters that Paul
[20:03] had written and something from one of
[20:05] the first four books every week. Didn't
[20:08] matter. Without fail, it was going to be
[20:10] that way. And then the priest would pick
[20:12] something out of those things. Can you
[20:14] imagine giving that to somebody in the
[20:15] message? Now,
[20:16] &gt;&gt; hey, brother Aaron, I'm going to give
[20:18] you three books. Your sermon has to come
[20:21] from this. And in fact, all I'm going to
[20:22] give you is three readings. So it'll be
[20:25] a few scriptures. That's all you get.
[20:28] That's how they did it. So you can
[20:30] imagine it's just like a blindfold that
[20:32] even the even the men of the men that
[20:34] are preaching it are blindfolded
[20:37] &gt;&gt; because they don't they can't even see
[20:38] beyond what that three thing is.
[20:44] So uh along comes a revelation.
[20:49] man named Martin Luther gets a
[20:51] revelation because God opens up the
[20:53] Bible to him and this verse comes out to
[20:56] him. The just shall live by faith. Now,
[20:58] in the Catholic church, guess what? They
[20:59] do penance all the time. And penance,
[21:01] just in case you don't know, is you've
[21:04] done something wrong and you're going to
[21:05] pay for it.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; So, uh, and it doesn't matter if you did
[21:08] anything wrong, you're going to pay for
[21:09] it anyways. And I'm sure sometimes the
[21:11] kids, you probably feel like, you know,
[21:13] dad is being too hard on you because I'm
[21:15] paying for something. I didn't do it.
[21:16] you know, did it or brother did
[21:19] it. Somebody else did it. I didn't do
[21:20] it. But in the Catholic church, you paid
[21:22] all the time. You were always penitent.
[21:25] Um, and in fact, they want to pray
[21:27] people out of purgatory, which is a
[21:29] place that you go because you were bad.
[21:31] Uh, pretty much you don't go straight to
[21:32] heaven. Everybody goes to purgatory and
[21:34] and you you pray for the dead people to
[21:36] get them out instead of making your way
[21:39] with the Lord while you're alive. you
[21:41] know, you got the the convenience of
[21:43] waiting until you're dead. And then, you
[21:45] know, the people that are coming behind
[21:46] me are going to get me out of this
[21:47] place, so everything's going to be good.
[21:49] That's kind of how it worked.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; So, anyway, he gets this revelation, the
[21:52] just shall live by faith. And I know
[21:54] this is really basic, but we're coming
[21:55] to something. And then another
[21:56] revelation comes along, right? And it's
[21:59] not just the just shall live by faith
[22:01] now, but faith without works is dead.
[22:03] John Wesley has this revelation that,
[22:05] you know, I I've got faith, but there
[22:07] has to be something that goes with it.
[22:09] And then as time went on there was a uh
[22:12] in in Iusa street which is some of us
[22:14] will be familiar with there was a move
[22:16] of the Pentecostals. Uh they weren't
[22:18] Pentecostal at that time they became
[22:19] known as Pentecostals but it was
[22:21] actually a former slave. He was oneeyed.
[22:24] He lost his eye left eye I think it was
[22:26] to smallpox. So a oneeyed man named
[22:29] Seymour actually
[22:32] is reading his Bible and realizes hey
[22:34] Holy Ghost that there's gifts of the
[22:37] spirit. this is something that's
[22:38] available to me. So God opens that up.
[22:41] And then as we move on through the
[22:43] scripture, then we've come to a time
[22:45] where we've had a prophet, right? And
[22:47] because of that prophet, and I I don't
[22:49] think I need to spend too much time on
[22:50] that, but because of that, now we have
[22:52] an open word. And in that open word, you
[22:55] can see the different ones. And by the
[22:56] way, artwork is credited to my son Seth
[22:59] because I can't do anything. So um he's
[23:03] helped me out with this because I want
[23:04] to make it simple for people to
[23:06] understand. One of the things that I've
[23:07] I've seen or have been witnessed to in
[23:09] the message is we use a lot of terms and
[23:12] a lot of times people are sitting in the
[23:13] audience they don't know what you're
[23:14] saying.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; You can talk about four horse riders or
[23:18] seven seals or you know what takes
[23:21] anything from revelation pretty much and
[23:23] you can talk about it and people are
[23:24] like I don't know what it is. You could
[23:25] ask somebody what's the message of the
[23:27] hour
[23:29] right they you it just sometimes goes
[23:32] over everybody's head. So I don't want
[23:34] it to be that way. What we want to do is
[23:36] make sure that even if it's basic, even
[23:38] if it's simple, that you catch these
[23:40] concepts because it's very important for
[23:42] it to go from here to here.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; So, right now, we are living in the time
[23:46] of the open word. And I I don't know if
[23:47] you can read all these things, but uh it
[23:50] it you know, we used to be prayer lines,
[23:52] right? And I'm I can tell you I'm a
[23:53] proponent of prayer lines. A lot of
[23:55] people are delivered. A lot of people
[23:57] are healed. A lot of things happen in a
[23:59] prayer line. So, I'm not saying anything
[24:01] about it. But the reality is you're
[24:03] living in the day of if you say to this
[24:05] mountain,
[24:06] &gt;&gt; it's just it's not just that call for
[24:08] the elders of the church. It's actually
[24:10] you can be at home all alone and if
[24:12] you've got a problem, you can say to
[24:14] this mountain, be moved. You can say to
[24:17] this sickness, "Go away." You can say,
[24:19] "Boo devil anytime that you need to
[24:21] because that's opened up. Jesus Christ
[24:24] is the same yesterday, today, and
[24:25] forever." We understand that the Holy
[24:27] Ghost is living in us. And I I'm not
[24:28] going to Well, I guess I could read all
[24:30] those things. All things are possible to
[24:31] those that believe. And these this is
[24:33] not a complete list. But now the whole
[24:35] Bible has opened up. Mysteries have
[24:37] opened up. Right? We understand why the
[24:40] Catholic Church is is that you know what
[24:43] they are and and not the people.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; I I I think it's really important to
[24:48] understand there are wonderful people in
[24:49] the Catholic Church.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; But there's a spirit that governs the
[24:53] the hierarchy of that church. And that
[24:55] spirit always tends away from the word.
[24:58] They always will because that's what's
[25:01] written in the Bible for them to do. You
[25:03] realize that's a prophecy, right? Just
[25:04] like you're a prophecy this evening.
[25:07] Every one of you, you're actually
[25:09] prophecy because you're written in the
[25:10] word.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; And we have to come to the point where
[25:13] we see that and understand that.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, I'm taking more time to on
[25:18] this part of it than I actually wanted
[25:19] to. So, uh, we're just getting to our
[25:22] message now. So, uh, in Romans 11:29, it
[25:26] says, "For the gifts and callings of God
[25:27] are without repentance." And then in
[25:30] Matthew 5:45, and I'm sorry, I'm going
[25:32] to speed up just a little bit to get
[25:33] through here. It says that uh, "That ye
[25:36] may be the children of your father,
[25:37] which is in heaven, for he maketh his
[25:39] son to rise on the evil and on the good,
[25:42] and sendeth rain on the just and the
[25:44] unjust." So, we understand that there's
[25:47] a couple principles in the scripture
[25:49] that uh, Brother Brandham taught quite
[25:51] well on. and he spent several sermons
[25:55] going over when he was uh uh Mishawaka,
[25:59] I think. Is that does that sound right?
[26:01] Hope I pronounced that right. But he's
[26:03] he's at a camp and it's a group of
[26:05] Pentecostals and he's his first time
[26:07] kind of coming into the Pentecostal
[26:09] group and there's two men and one is um
[26:11] you know speaking in tongues and the
[26:13] other is interpreting.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; And so this when he realizes because
[26:16] he's got a gift,
[26:17] &gt;&gt; remember gifts and callings are without
[26:19] repentance. He had that gift when he was
[26:20] young. He wasn't always doing the right
[26:23] thing. I mean, he tried to shoot some
[26:24] kids.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Kids, it's not the right thing to try
[26:27] and shoot other kids. I mean, it's just
[26:29] not.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; But he tried. But he was still a prophet
[26:32] at at that time. So, what you are is
[26:35] always there. It's always present. You
[26:37] just may not realize it. Just like water
[26:39] holds within it other powers. You don't
[26:42] see it because it hasn't been brought
[26:43] out yet. Something hasn't come. There
[26:46] hasn't been a power maybe to show you,
[26:48] but at some point in your life, it'll
[26:50] come out. Amen.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; It it has to because they're without
[26:53] repentance. So that what that means is
[26:55] that I can be a bad person and still
[26:58] discern your thoughts.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; I could be a bad person and still make
[27:04] things move in the room. And we're going
[27:06] to talk about that in just a second. I
[27:08] could be a bad person and still maybe
[27:10] even do good things, but still yet being
[27:14] never converted, never changed, not even
[27:17] desiring to change. Right?
[27:18] &gt;&gt; You know, I should interject this
[27:20] because it was a thought and it just
[27:21] came into my mind now, but if you
[27:24] realize
[27:27] what great grace that we're under,
[27:30] &gt;&gt; and I'm not just saying, so in in the
[27:33] room tonight, there's maybe what 50 60
[27:34] of us, but in the city of Phoenix,
[27:37] there's four plus million. You know,
[27:39] Phoenix and its other cities are around
[27:41] there. In the this country, there's over
[27:43] 300 million. And then in the world,
[27:46] there's 8 billion. And out of all those
[27:48] people, out of all the ages, you end up
[27:50] in this age. And out of all that, all
[27:53] those people that are out there, we have
[27:55] been shown a message and have been able
[27:59] to realize that it's for us.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Have been able to realize that the Holy
[28:03] Ghost is for us.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Have been able to realize that all the
[28:06] promises of God are for us, that healing
[28:08] is for you. That deliverance is for you.
[28:10] That if you've got anxiety, you don't
[28:12] have to have it. There's peace is for
[28:14] you. If you've got depression, joy is
[28:16] for you. All these things are there.
[28:18] They're available. They're for you. What
[28:20] great grace that we have. And part of
[28:22] the reason I'm saying this is because if
[28:24] it seems like I'm trying to point a
[28:25] finger or say something, listen, I'm
[28:27] least in the kingdom. I know that. And I
[28:28] don't say it because of humility. I say
[28:31] it because I understand the grace of
[28:32] God. I'm sorry. That got me here. Yeah.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; And if you understand the grace of God
[28:39] that gets you someplace. I'm sorry. I
[28:41] didn't expect to break up about that.
[28:43] But it's a great grace, saints.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; It's a great grace.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; But so, Brother Brandham is uh again,
[28:53] he's he's I'm going to get into this in
[28:54] just a second, like I said, but um we're
[28:58] going to see that there's a a pattern.
[28:59] And by the way, when when the scripture
[29:02] talks about the flow of things, that
[29:04] flow uh uh is actually a pattern.
[29:07] There's a pattern to something. So we
[29:09] can see in water and what it does and
[29:11] how it locks in something. There's a
[29:12] pattern there for us to observe for
[29:14] ourselves
[29:15] &gt;&gt; because there's a pattern to to
[29:17] understand it. So in the message um the
[29:20] countdown preached in 64.
[29:24] Yeah. 64 says the natural astronaut has
[29:27] something to control him. And we've
[29:29] already talked about this a little bit.
[29:30] When the astronaut is in the air, he has
[29:32] something backwards here back down here
[29:34] on the Earth that controls him. It's
[29:35] called radar. That radar moves him
[29:37] around, shows where he's at, tells what
[29:39] he's doing, and that radar controls him
[29:41] from a radar tower here on Earth. That's
[29:43] the natural astronaut. So, the spiritual
[29:45] astronaut has a control tower or has a
[29:48] control tower, too.
[29:51] And and it's not down here like man is,
[29:53] it's up there. And it's the Holy Ghost
[29:56] that's in him that's controlling him. a
[29:58] tower of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[30:00] So you see why the Holy Ghost is so
[30:01] important
[30:03] &gt;&gt; because we can come and we can learn all
[30:05] kinds of biblical principles and we can
[30:07] learn how to be good people. But brother
[30:09] Brandham said that's not it.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; That's not what it is. You you can learn
[30:14] how to dress appropriately and have your
[30:17] hair long or short whether you're male
[30:18] or female or you know have the right
[30:20] length of a skirt. You can learn all
[30:22] those things. Those are wonderful
[30:24] things, but you have to have the Holy
[30:26] Ghost because it's the only thing just
[30:28] like that tether that we showed earlier.
[30:30] The only thing that ties you the ball to
[30:32] the that strong tower is the Holy Ghost.
[30:35] There's no other way around it. You have
[30:37] to we have to find a way for the church
[30:40] always to move into that place. And it's
[30:42] available all the time,
[30:44] &gt;&gt; always available, always out there.
[30:47] So, it's under control. It keeps them in
[30:49] control by the word. So the Holy Ghost
[30:51] is that tether and it tethers you to the
[30:54] word and it's what reveals you to the
[30:55] word. So when Martin Luther came up with
[30:58] that revelation holy ghost when John
[31:00] Wesley came up with the revelation Holy
[31:02] Ghost when when brother Seymour came up
[31:03] with the re revelation Holy Ghost when
[31:06] brother Brandham came Holy Ghost
[31:08] &gt;&gt; you see now they had gifts they had all
[31:10] those things but those are without
[31:12] repentance but it was the Holy Ghost
[31:13] that's manufacturing or not
[31:14] manufacturing manifesting all those
[31:17] things
[31:19] &gt;&gt; not in a bunch of fanaticism some
[31:21] whooped up nonsense but that thus saith
[31:23] the Lord and it happens it's always
[31:25] under control. He's got a control tower
[31:28] and that's the Holy Ghost.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; So, we understand that we're connected
[31:32] then, right? We're in that place and um
[31:35] sorry, I didn't finish. And the word um
[31:37] in his program and he he lays right into
[31:40] that program and the power of the Holy
[31:42] Ghost endows him to move out and it
[31:44] brings the achievement that God wants to
[31:45] be achieved for his people that it might
[31:47] fulfill what he's promised.
[31:50] So, we're connected to a promise. In
[31:53] fact, we're connected to many promises.
[31:55] And that connection is always there. But
[31:57] see, there's an interesting thing that's
[31:58] that's happened um in in this day and
[32:02] age is we've gotten so much freedom
[32:05] that because we're in the astronaut age
[32:08] and so many things have come to us, so
[32:12] much revelation has happened that people
[32:14] start to get really grand ideas. And uh
[32:18] I said the last time I'm not going to
[32:19] repeat the word, but basically
[32:20] somebody's calling themselves God and
[32:22] saying, "Hey, you need to reference me
[32:24] as this person." Um that's a pretty
[32:27] grand idea. Now, Brother Brandham does
[32:29] talk about messiahes, right? But we
[32:32] understand you're still tethered to the
[32:33] word.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ paid the price.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; We didn't.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Christ did that.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; The the revelation that we get without
[32:42] you take the Holy Ghost away and I'm
[32:44] sorry, you're not going to have it.
[32:46] You're tied to something.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; But when you get out in space, this is
[32:51] what happens. I can float free.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Not only can I float free, I can go
[32:55] really fast. Like I can really
[32:58] accomplish things here. And you have
[33:01] gifts. And I can tell you that there's a
[33:04] lot of people that start to follow
[33:05] gifts. If you have somebody that has a
[33:08] gift of discernment or a gift of healing
[33:10] or a gift of wisdom, you know, they they
[33:14] like, man, it just blows your mind how
[33:16] this person could tell me something or,
[33:18] you know, this person doesn't matter who
[33:20] they pray for. It's like the person gets
[33:22] healed. Uh, you know, they can be a
[33:24] dynamic speaker. They don't even have to
[33:25] necessarily have any of those gifts, but
[33:27] if they're a really charismatic speaker,
[33:29] that's all it takes. And people start to
[33:32] follow
[33:33] &gt;&gt; that
[33:35] &gt;&gt; instead of being tethered to the word
[33:37] &gt;&gt; and they they they get to the point of
[33:40] not understanding what that is. So let
[33:43] me relate a little story to you here
[33:44] just quick. When when I was a young
[33:47] person and again I'm at least in the
[33:49] kingdom so please don't and I I don't
[33:51] normally say anything about dreams
[33:52] because there's no prophet to interpret
[33:54] my dreams. So um but in this particular
[33:57] case I was a young Christian. I was in a
[34:00] a a church and uh had just come to the
[34:03] Lord and I love church like we would
[34:06] have church services they'd be three and
[34:07] a half hours saints it was like 20
[34:09] minutes a a 30 minute service in the
[34:13] Catholic church was like three hours so
[34:15] this was like amazing because we would
[34:17] come in people were like ready to
[34:20] worship the the preaching was dynamic
[34:22] then people were ready to worship even
[34:24] more there was a lot of stuff going on
[34:27] and it was it was exciting and church
[34:30] should be that way because this is your
[34:33] you're here with Jesus Christ the risen
[34:37] king
[34:38] &gt;&gt; and anyway in this particular dream that
[34:40] I had and I I I didn't do anything with
[34:43] it at the time but there were my brother
[34:45] and I are in the back of the church um
[34:47] we were going to the same church at the
[34:48] time and you could see rain falling in
[34:52] the church it was amazing now granted I
[34:54] I didn't know anything about the Bible I
[34:56] had no idea but it was this amber rain
[35:00] and it was everywhere and we're just in
[35:02] the back worshiping. Now, I don't know
[35:03] if he could see it, but I could see it.
[35:05] Never seen it in my natural self, but in
[35:08] my dream it was awesome. I can tell you
[35:10] that. But there were two sisters
[35:12] worshiping up front, both lovely
[35:15] sisters. Um, and just worshiping. And
[35:18] then a voice said to me, "One of those
[35:20] is a witch."
[35:23] And I can tell you, I woke right up
[35:25] because it startled me so hard. I didn't
[35:28] know what it meant. I didn't understand
[35:29] it. I didn't know anything about gifts
[35:31] and callings. I didn't know anything
[35:33] about the rain falling on the just and
[35:34] the unjust. All I knew was there are two
[35:37] people and one of them was a quiet
[35:40] person. Um, very kind. Both of them were
[35:43] kind. I shouldn't say that. She was very
[35:45] kind, but just very quiet. She didn't
[35:47] she didn't necessarily have a great
[35:49] power in the church. Didn't have a lot
[35:50] of gifts. But the other one was very
[35:51] gifted. She could sing like an angel. uh
[35:55] spoke in tongues, interpreted all all
[35:56] kinds of things. So, this wasn't a
[35:58] message church, by the way, because we
[36:00] we never see that anymore in message
[36:02] churches hardly, but uh you know, God's
[36:05] gifts are good, saints.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; So, and and they're still good today.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; So, you know, I I know some things get
[36:11] in the back room, but the reality is
[36:13] those gifts are still existent today.
[36:15] They're still for us. So anyways,
[36:19] over the course of time, the sister and
[36:22] I didn't know who who was which because
[36:23] to me they were lovely sisters. I mean,
[36:26] I I didn't have a discernment to know
[36:29] what was what. But it was some years
[36:30] later, one of the sisters um basically
[36:34] kind of led a division in the church and
[36:37] even split family from family. Um, and I
[36:41] want to say this, just because somebody
[36:44] has a spirit of a witch now doesn't mean
[36:47] down the road that they'll have it
[36:49] because there's always deliverance and
[36:51] there's always grace until the last
[36:53] breath is taken. There's always that.
[36:56] But, you know, and I was like, "Wow,
[36:58] this is amazing." Um, that, you know,
[37:01] that that happened. Um, and but again, I
[37:04] don't say that that sister stayed a
[37:05] witch. I just say that at that time she
[37:07] had that spirit already on her. I didn't
[37:09] know it, but the Holy Ghost knew it. So,
[37:12] he was teaching me something. And I I
[37:14] just, you know, it to me that really
[37:17] spoke to me. Boy, am I running out of
[37:20] time. Um, it really spoke to me that
[37:22] that, you know, that you could see that.
[37:24] And so, you start looking as a person,
[37:26] you know, you're always looking like,
[37:27] "Wow, I wonder if that gift is real. I
[37:29] wonder if that, you know, I want not not
[37:30] that the gift is real. The gifts are
[37:32] real. Sorry. If the person operating the
[37:34] gift is real, right?" So, that's the
[37:37] thing. And so you can see like
[37:40] in the message today, you have so much
[37:44] grace, you have so much power, you have
[37:47] so much word, you have so much uh you
[37:50] know, authority in the word, you have
[37:52] all these great things. And you know,
[37:56] sometimes people just get to a point
[37:57] where they they start to to get
[38:01] well, for lack of a better term, lifted
[38:03] up in themselves. I think brother Pat,
[38:06] he preached that sermon, humility, a
[38:08] great sermon. If you haven't heard it, I
[38:10] I would recommend listening to it
[38:12] because they don't realize that Christ
[38:14] stayed humble and he was Jesus Christ,
[38:17] the savior of the world. And yet they
[38:20] there was nothing like they said there
[38:22] was nothing that you would notice him
[38:24] like he wasn't standing out. Now
[38:25] sometimes he had to correct things along
[38:26] the way, but for the most part, you
[38:29] know, he was a guy sleeping out in the
[38:30] in the wild. uh he didn't have a place
[38:33] to lay his head. There was nothing that
[38:35] was going to be outstanding about him,
[38:37] but the word that was coming from him
[38:39] was.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; And but he yet he still had humility.
[38:43] And and you can look at the life of
[38:44] brother Brandham pretty much start to
[38:47] finish and you can see his humility. And
[38:48] when he when he when he got a little
[38:50] lifted up in things, he tells you about
[38:52] it because the Lord corrected him. Said,
[38:55] "Hey, you can't do this." You know, he
[38:57] had a gift, right? Had a gift of
[38:59] healing. But when he got a little bit
[39:00] lifted up, guess what happened to the
[39:01] gift of healing?
[39:03] wasn't operating,
[39:05] &gt;&gt; right? He still had the gift. It hadn't
[39:06] gone anywhere,
[39:07] &gt;&gt; but the Lord was showing him that you
[39:09] can't just do whatever you want to do
[39:11] because you got to be tethered, right?
[39:14] &gt;&gt; There's always something holding you
[39:16] back. So, um, just briefly, we'll go
[39:18] through this. And faith is the
[39:19] substance. This is in 19 uh 47, so long
[39:23] long time ago. Um it says um brother
[39:27] Brandham is dealing with a a young
[39:29] sister who ha has a basically an
[39:32] appendix that is inflamed and it's so
[39:34] bad that it's about to burst and she
[39:36] lives out on a country road. Um and that
[39:39] country road is uh pretty rough. Uh and
[39:42] he said about 8 miles of country road
[39:44] and she needs to get to a hospital
[39:45] that's 40 miles away in order to have a
[39:47] surgery and there's no way she's going
[39:48] to make it. So they call him, he's
[39:50] really tired. He has to drive. So he
[39:52] gets there and uh the sister is of a
[39:54] certain denomination and he initially
[39:56] doesn't name the denomination.
[39:58] Eventually it kind of slips out but he
[39:59] wasn't intending to but he's telling the
[40:01] sister listen you um you don't have the
[40:04] faith that you think you have because
[40:06] when he comes in she's like I know my
[40:08] church teaches something different but I
[40:10] have faith. I I believe in healing
[40:12] because Georgie Carter got healed and I
[40:14] believe it. And when he when that
[40:17] happens he's like sister you don't have
[40:18] the faith that you think you have. And
[40:20] so he does something very amazing to me.
[40:22] But anyways, u let's just read here. It
[40:25] says, "And when they passed by at noon,
[40:28] uh the tree was oh, sorry, I'm in the
[40:30] wrong place there. Uh
[40:36] she said there's no such thing. Let me
[40:38] where we at? Yeah, there we go. She said
[40:41] there's no such thing can be showed in
[40:44] the Bible, anything like that." So, what
[40:45] he's talking about at this time is that
[40:47] um she has Oh, brother, go back to
[40:51] another one because I actually want to
[40:52] read this one first. It's um tile 24.
[40:56] Yeah, that one. Now, I want you to
[40:57] notice this and I want you to be real
[40:59] careful now and take up every word so
[41:01] you can divide it of a little something
[41:03] that God permitted there. And I'll and
[41:06] I'll see if you've got faith. So, he's
[41:09] doing something and what happens is um
[41:11] I'll just kind of cut the story shorter
[41:14] is that the sister has hanging in this
[41:16] room a bracelet and brother Brandon was
[41:19] talking to her and and he's telling her,
[41:20] "You don't have faith." And she says, "I
[41:22] do have faith." And so they go through
[41:24] this. Um, and when he's telling her this
[41:27] thing, um, he has everybody turn around
[41:30] in the room and just has her focusing on
[41:33] him and he, the bracelet is hanging
[41:36] there in the air and he basically says,
[41:40] you know, do you believe that you, you
[41:41] know, the bracelet can be moved? And
[41:43] she's like, it's 15 ft away. You know,
[41:45] that can't do it. There's no way the
[41:47] bracelet can be moved. Brother Brandham
[41:48] says, I want you to move it, you know,
[41:50] back and forth and around in circles.
[41:51] And then he demonstrates to her that
[41:53] it's possible. So, and right away she's
[41:56] like, "Hey, that's spiritualism. What
[41:58] you're doing is spiritualism." And
[42:00] brother Ram's like, "I thought you would
[42:02] say that." Like, "I thought you'd say
[42:04] it's the devil doing it because" And
[42:06] then she asked him, "Well, did the Lord
[42:07] or the devil do it?" And he said, "No, I
[42:09] I did it because it's just the law of
[42:12] faith. If you have faith to do
[42:14] something, he said, "Magicians do
[42:16] things." Look at Janice and and and
[42:18] Jambers when they withtood Moses. Moses
[42:20] was under a commission. They're just
[42:22] guys that believed that they could
[42:24] create stuff and they're out there
[42:26] creating it. Not even part of of the
[42:29] plan of God at all, aside from being the
[42:31] negative side of it, but yet they're
[42:33] doing it. So he's teaching her a law of
[42:36] faith that this can be done. And so this
[42:39] bracelet moves around and then he So
[42:41] what I want to get to in this particular
[42:43] story isn't so much the bracelet moving
[42:45] around, but just what he tells her
[42:47] because he explains something to her. He
[42:50] said there's So she's like said there's
[42:52] no such thing can be showed in the Bible
[42:54] anything like that. And I I said I
[42:56] thought that's what you would say. And I
[42:57] said sure that's in the Bible. And she
[42:59] said well I never I don't believe it.
[43:01] All right. I said you don't believe it.
[43:03] And she said no you showed me where
[43:05] that's at in the Bible. And he said one
[43:07] day Jesus passed by a tree. He wanted to
[43:10] find some fruit on it. There was no
[43:12] fruit on it. He put a curse on it and
[43:14] the tree began to wilt. And when they
[43:16] passed by at noon, the tree was wilting
[43:19] down. Peter remarked and said, "How
[43:21] quick the tree was wilted." And he said,
[43:23] "If you would say in your heart for this
[43:26] tree to be plucked up and cast into the
[43:28] sea and wouldn't doubt, it would obey
[43:30] you." And and then he asked her, did he
[43:33] say that? So now the girl eventually
[43:35] does understand and grasps that concept
[43:39] of faith and her appendix doesn't burst.
[43:42] It's actually the an immediate healing
[43:44] comes to her. But brother Brandham sets
[43:47] up this thing. This is in 47. This is
[43:50] the first sermon, as far as I know,
[43:51] that's recorded.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Um, it's the first sermon and he's
[43:55] telling you right then, listen, if you
[43:57] have faith, you can do these things. But
[44:00] what he's always doing is taking it back
[44:02] to the word. And he did that throughout
[44:05] his lifetime. It always went back to the
[44:07] scripture. So I I the last time I
[44:09] preached I didn't tie two things
[44:10] together too well but a person that says
[44:12] that they're God and then that you know
[44:14] that you can't tie that to the
[44:16] scripture. Now, he didn't say he was
[44:18] Jesus Christ, but he's in effect saying
[44:21] that, right, by saying that thing. But
[44:23] you can't tie that to the word because
[44:25] even the the prophet of Malachi 4
[44:28] couldn't be that person because he was
[44:30] born from a mom and a dad of human cre,
[44:34] you know, human nature,
[44:36] &gt;&gt; right? There was no immaculate
[44:37] conception, nothing like that that it
[44:39] was just that. So, brother Brandham and
[44:42] so he goes through his whole life, I'll
[44:44] try and cut this a little bit shorter.
[44:45] He goes through his whole life teaching
[44:47] these things that when um so the storm
[44:52] is spoken out of existence. So he takes
[44:54] you back to the word and shows you Jesus
[44:56] speaks to the storm, right? He goes
[44:58] through different things to tell you
[45:00] it's always going to go back to the
[45:01] word. So if there is a spiritual
[45:03] happening, I don't care what it is, if
[45:06] something happens spiritually, whether
[45:07] it's somebody preaching something,
[45:09] saying something, doing something, even
[45:12] St. Martin. They had a guy that wanted
[45:14] to put a robe on and they brought him
[45:15] before, well, they're going to bring him
[45:17] before St. Martin, but he was telling
[45:18] everybody he wanted some accolades. He
[45:20] wanted to be important. He wanted to
[45:22] show like, hey, I'm a great person. Um,
[45:25] and so they said, well, you know, the
[45:26] the other ministers are like, this
[45:28] doesn't make sense. Like, this doesn't
[45:29] sound like the word. And Martin was the
[45:32] the prophet, if you will, for that time.
[45:34] And he, you know, there's like, okay,
[45:36] we're going to bring you to to Martin.
[45:38] And once they touched him, that robe the
[45:40] robe actually appeared because the guy
[45:42] had enough faith to make the robe
[45:44] appear. But it wasn't it wasn't correct
[45:48] because you wouldn't have that white
[45:49] robe already. There would be no purpose
[45:51] in it. You get a white robe later. And
[45:53] in fact, that was when you know when
[45:55] when you know Jesus allegedly Jesus came
[45:58] and he had a crown on and he's like,
[46:00] "Hey, get out of here because the the
[46:02] word says that we'll crown you."
[46:04] &gt;&gt; That that's not you. I know it's not
[46:06] you, Jesus, because this isn't right
[46:07] with the word. So, everything is always
[46:09] going back to the scripture. And I I
[46:11] want to make this clear, too. We have a
[46:13] revealed word, which we call the message
[46:15] of the hour,
[46:16] &gt;&gt; right? And we have a Bible. And you
[46:19] can't separate the two. Now, I know
[46:21] years ago they had this thing and maybe
[46:23] they still are doing it. If you're
[46:24] you're if you you get stuck out on a
[46:26] deserted island, which would you choose,
[46:27] the Bible or the message? So, just a
[46:30] very simple thing here. If you know that
[46:32] a deserted island could be in your
[46:34] future, stay away from water,
[46:37] right? If it's me, I'm just not going to
[46:39] the water. Like, I'm not taking a plane.
[46:42] I'm not taking a boat. I'm not getting
[46:44] off land because I don't want to be
[46:46] stuck on a deserted island. But if I
[46:48] know what's in my future, I'm probably
[46:50] taking both because why not? But it it's
[46:53] just people want to come up with silly
[46:55] things to talk about. It's it's just a
[46:58] silly thing. You don't separate one from
[46:59] the other. But what happens is people
[47:02] will get into the message and they'll
[47:04] get an idea and I'm I'm going to give
[47:05] you I know I've run out of time. I'm
[47:07] sorry to hold you so long. But um one of
[47:11] the things that they'll do is they'll
[47:13] they'll come up with some idea and
[47:14] they'll say brother Brandham taught
[47:16] this. And what they don't want you to do
[47:18] is to take it back to the word. And then
[47:20] there's another camp that says oh look
[47:22] at I can prove to you by the word that
[47:24] everything brother Brandham said was
[47:25] wrong because you know he missed this
[47:27] particular thing or that particular
[47:28] thing. Now, I didn't do the count, but a
[47:31] brother that I trust was involved in the
[47:33] count, and he said there are over 8,300
[47:35] or about 8,300 prophecies that were
[47:38] absolutely accurate. Now, I haven't
[47:40] heard 8,300 of them, but I've heard
[47:42] probably hundreds, maybe more than that,
[47:44] maybe thousands, I don't know, but at
[47:46] least hundreds, but even if it was, I
[47:49] don't know, 5,000, 2,000, I mean, if you
[47:52] know, he said, "Hey, your name is, you
[47:55] know, Mrs. Uh, Smith, you're from
[47:58] Tuscaloosa, Alabama. You were today um
[48:01] standing in your kitchen and I'm just
[48:03] throwing I'm just making this up right
[48:04] now. It's not that Brother Brandham said
[48:06] this, but you were standing in your
[48:08] kitchen and you were you were praying
[48:10] that tonight that you would come here
[48:11] and be healed of this goer that you have
[48:15] and it would be dead on
[48:17] &gt;&gt; name what she was wearing, where she
[48:19] was, everything that she was doing. And
[48:22] then, you know, people will take and and
[48:24] show, well, look at if he missed one
[48:26] thing, then he's false all the way
[48:28] around. And it's like, come on. Like,
[48:30] seriously. But that's their argument.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; And and they'll try and use the Bible
[48:34] and say, "Well, I'm, you know, the
[48:36] Bible's my absolute and therefore I can
[48:38] just prove this by the Bible." The Bible
[48:40] is our absolute, but it's also framed by
[48:43] the message because without it, how
[48:46] would I know how would I know as a
[48:48] Catholic what the Catholic Church was? I
[48:51] could I could read I tell you one of the
[48:53] things I read chapter 13 in in the USA
[48:55] being in there I'm still like wow that's
[48:58] amazing like I I I would have never
[49:00] without the message I'd have never known
[49:02] anything like that and that's the whole
[49:04] thing so I'm going to give you one more
[49:06] example
[49:08] um oh and actually yeah I'll give you
[49:11] one more example and then I'm going to
[49:12] go on to to what brother Random says on
[49:14] something else so when I was traveling
[49:16] overseas there was a person and this is
[49:19] how people get ideas Right? They they
[49:21] claim this is from the message. So they
[49:22] claimed that brother Brandon was
[49:23] teaching and and so we understand that
[49:26] when we're converted, we have a new
[49:28] birth, right? And that your your soul
[49:31] has that conversion, so to speak, right?
[49:34] Because that seed's always there, but
[49:36] you have a conversion. The Holy Ghost
[49:37] comes in in that. So now you have an old
[49:39] man that's died and the new man has been
[49:41] born again. So they claimed to take from
[49:45] the message that the because um the wife
[49:50] would not follow the husband because he
[49:53] got a revelation that you know this
[49:54] message was true because the wife
[49:56] wouldn't follow the husband. She was
[49:58] dead because she was spiritually dead,
[50:01] &gt;&gt; right? And so he took the spiritual
[50:02] death. So it gets better. He took the
[50:04] spiritual death and said, "Okay, this
[50:07] this person's dead, so I'm going to
[50:08] remarry."
[50:10] So he remarried another person. But the
[50:13] amazing thing is is that he came up with
[50:16] the idea that since the old person is
[50:19] dead and then you know this new soul is
[50:21] living I can have this new wife but when
[50:25] I I feel manly and kind of uh driven a
[50:29] certain way and kids hopefully this goes
[50:31] over your head but when I feel a certain
[50:32] way I can live with the old wife in the
[50:35] manner of husband and wife because uh
[50:38] it's it's just my nature it's that you
[50:41] know that this covering that's around my
[50:43] soul that hasn't been converted so
[50:46] therefore I can live this way. So now
[50:49] these are kind of ridiculous, right?
[50:50] Like it's two ridiculous ideas. But the
[50:53] reality is is there's a lot of people
[50:55] that come to a point in their life where
[50:58] they are following somebody that because
[51:00] they're gifted, they'll allow them to do
[51:03] crazy things, right? And listen, I I'm
[51:07] not trying to beat down a preacher or
[51:08] anything like that, but what I am saying
[51:10] for us is that if you're following
[51:12] something that can't tie between message
[51:15] and what the prophet spoke and the
[51:18] Bible,
[51:20] you might want to consider that's
[51:22] probably not the thing to follow.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how gifted the person is.
[51:27] Doesn't matter what kind of ability they
[51:29] have, how much charisma they have, how
[51:31] much it seems like the spirit's with
[51:33] them, how many healings take place, all
[51:35] those things don't matter because it
[51:38] always has to come back. If there's a
[51:40] spiritual thing going on, no matter what
[51:41] it is, it has to come back to a
[51:43] scriptural reason for it, it will always
[51:46] come back. So, Brother Brandham is
[51:48] talking about, and we're almost done.
[51:50] Brother Brandham is talking about
[51:52] um when when squirrels were created or
[51:55] things were created and that the Lord
[51:58] Jesus Christ and his ministry on earth
[52:00] actually didn't create something from
[52:03] nothing, right? Water was turned to
[52:06] wine, right? Bread and fish were
[52:07] multiplied, but he didn't actually
[52:09] create something from nothing. And so
[52:11] people are doubting, okay, you've you
[52:13] know, you claim that you created
[52:14] squirrels, right? And so, Brother
[52:16] Brandham explains this
[52:19] um in questions and answers. He said,
[52:20] 'Now, when it comes to creation of
[52:22] things, it's true. Jesus never right
[52:25] straight out created anything and
[52:27] brought it into existence. He took a
[52:29] substance first. He took water, made
[52:31] wine. He took bread and made some uh
[52:33] more bread. He took fish and made more
[52:34] fish. But he promised that greater
[52:36] things than this would be done. So, you
[52:39] see now it's in a more evil day than it
[52:43] was when he was here. and it's still him
[52:46] but using your tabernacle.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; So again, he's taking what is happening
[52:51] in his life and taking it back to the
[52:53] word and proving scripturally that this
[52:56] is why this is happening so that people
[52:58] wouldn't be confused about it. But
[53:00] again, what he frames this is it's still
[53:03] him.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus Christ,
[53:06] &gt;&gt; it's the the Holy Ghost. It's still him.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Doing
[53:10] that thing, but in your tabernacle.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's where people get
[53:15] confused is because they realize like
[53:17] we're we're in the open word saints.
[53:20] Everything is available to you. If you
[53:22] say to this mountain that is available
[53:24] to you.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; If you have a problem in your life, if
[53:27] you got anxiety or depression or what,
[53:28] if you say go, it has to follow if we've
[53:33] got the faith to believe it.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Because that's where we're living.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; We we are living in a time where we're
[53:39] in an astronaut age where we can go
[53:41] 17,500 miles an hour. It's going to beat
[53:43] a Tesla every day because it's a it's a
[53:46] fast speed. In fact, it's going to beat
[53:48] anything on land. Um, and I think Teslas
[53:50] are cool, by the way. So, I'm not
[53:52] picking on Tesla. Um, I' I've only
[53:54] ridden him in a few times, and it's
[53:55] amazing how it pushes you back in the
[53:56] seat when you take off. It's I like it.
[53:59] Uh, it's a lot of fun.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; But that you understand that you're
[54:03] living in an age where all things are
[54:05] possible. So, we're I want to get to a
[54:09] close here and and the last time that I
[54:13] preached, I I brought out a car that
[54:15] they have created. Um, now it's a
[54:18] prototype and it's a hydrogenbased car.
[54:21] In other words, it runs on hydrogen and
[54:23] oxygen. And that's the car. It's just a
[54:25] prototype. But the thing about this is
[54:27] is it's that according to the people
[54:29] that are building this, it's going to go
[54:31] a,000 miles on a fillup.
[54:34] Now, I don't know about you, but I love
[54:35] a car that could go a thousand miles and
[54:38] not get stuck in the cold or because
[54:40] there's a power outage or whatever as
[54:43] long as I've got hydrogen in there and
[54:44] there's oxygen available, which it's all
[54:46] around us. Um, and the thing about that
[54:49] car is thousand miles. But all these
[54:52] things, saints, were always in the
[54:54] earth. Everything we're sitting on now
[54:56] was in the earth. Everything that man's
[54:58] discovered was already here before. So,
[55:01] what they've built now has always been
[55:03] here. And and this is kind of the
[55:06] there's two things I want to bring to
[55:07] you. One of them is this is that I
[55:10] thought, you know, back when I was young
[55:13] and and really for a long time that when
[55:16] the Lord showed me that it was about me
[55:18] like watching out for things and it is,
[55:20] but it's actually a two-fold meaning
[55:22] because, you know, the Bible has a lot
[55:24] of things that have two things, you
[55:27] know, contained in it or multiple things
[55:28] contained in the same scripture.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; So, gifts and callings being without
[55:32] repentance, that includes me,
[55:36] &gt;&gt; right? the rain falling on the just and
[55:37] the unjust. That still includes me
[55:40] &gt;&gt; because I can look around because we're
[55:42] always looking out, right? We're always
[55:43] looking at what's going on. What's that?
[55:44] You know, what's this person doing? A
[55:46] lot of people are always involved in
[55:47] what people are doing. I'm not really
[55:48] that way. I don't ask questions most of
[55:50] the time. Whatever you're doing, you're
[55:52] doing right. But some people, they just
[55:53] can't help it. Like they want to know
[55:55] where did you go? What did you do? Who
[55:57] did you see? It's like, okay, if you
[55:59] want to know, it's okay. I've got enough
[56:01] things to worry about than to worry
[56:03] about who's doing what. But the thing
[56:05] about that that that word is is that
[56:08] it's us first.
[56:10] And I didn't realize that for a long
[56:11] time. I'm like, okay, I'm looking like,
[56:13] you know, is this sister? Is this
[56:15] brother? Is there, you know, because
[56:16] this, you know, I I was young. I didn't
[56:18] know. I didn't understand. But the
[56:21] reality is is that it comes to us first
[56:24] and then it goes out. But so the people
[56:27] that are following these things, if they
[56:28] had considered themselves first and
[56:31] looked at themselves, they would have
[56:33] realized, I can't go with this because
[56:36] it doesn't follow the word. So I'm now
[56:38] not following the word. It doesn't
[56:39] matter what that brother's doing because
[56:41] what he does, that's up to him. He's
[56:42] going to have to to answer for it if he
[56:44] does. If there's no repentance, you
[56:46] answer for those things, right? But
[56:48] still, it has to start with us. And then
[56:52] the other thing that I wanted to make
[56:53] sure that I mentioned is that you have
[56:56] in all of us have this potential and you
[56:58] can stand with me if you would
[57:03] just like we started off with the water
[57:05] and understanding that once you that's
[57:06] divided correctly within the water has
[57:09] always been hydrogen and oxygen within
[57:11] that has always been the ability to you
[57:14] know blow something up if you wanted to
[57:16] blow something up or make something burn
[57:17] better if you wanted to do that those
[57:18] kind of things or just have a power
[57:21] source to operate a car. Always been
[57:23] present. It's just we're just
[57:25] discovering it now. And the thing about
[57:28] the Holy Ghost is it's always been
[57:30] present.
[57:32] But you are in the pattern of God
[57:35] &gt;&gt; because you are a part of his word. The
[57:38] spirit and the bride say come. Right.
[57:40] The and it says if you say, it's not
[57:42] saying if if William Brandham says, it's
[57:45] saying if you say, it doesn't matter
[57:47] your age. It doesn't matter your gender.
[57:49] It doesn't matter where you're living,
[57:51] you know, it none of those things
[57:52] matter. It's because you're in the
[57:54] pattern already of the living God.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost is a tether that will
[58:00] keep you tied to that word.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And because that you're in that pattern
[58:03] now, the potential that you have maybe
[58:06] hasn't been unlocked yet. Maybe you're
[58:09] not there where you can say, "Yeah, I
[58:11] said and and this happened." not to move
[58:13] a bracelet, but to to free yourself from
[58:16] depression, to free yourself from
[58:19] anxiety. Maybe you're not there yet, but
[58:21] that lies within you
[58:23] &gt;&gt; because you're made in the pattern of
[58:25] God.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Those things lie within you. And it's
[58:29] not to get so big-headed that we want
[58:31] people to say, "Hey, you're you're, you
[58:33] know,
[58:35] you know, God come in the flesh," kind
[58:37] of thing. not to worship, but it's it's
[58:40] to us to be tied to Jesus Christ so much
[58:43] that when he moves in the church, we
[58:45] move with him.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; When when when the spirit of worship
[58:48] rolls in, we worship because that's what
[58:51] we are created to do.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Don't ever be afraid of worship, saints.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; That's God loves it when you do that. If
[58:57] the Holy Ghost moves in and moves you to
[58:59] do something, go with it.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; As long as it's according to the word,
[59:03] right? as long as I I believe it will be
[59:05] because the Holy Ghost does things
[59:07] right. It knows how to do things right.
[59:09] We're the ones that kind of get it
[59:10] convoluted in our minds. But you today,
[59:14] you're made in the pattern. So you're
[59:16] that flow that flow of of the word. If
[59:20] the word is rightly divided, if you
[59:21] divide things, just like brother Brandon
[59:23] was telling that young sister, you know,
[59:25] look at if if you can divide the word
[59:27] correctly, you're in that flow. You're
[59:30] in that pattern and you're tethered to
[59:32] the rock of ages.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; And that's the best place you can be is
[59:36] tethered to him.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Tethered by the Holy Ghost. You've got a
[59:41] sure foundation. You've got a a sure
[59:42] tower to hang on to to keep you from
[59:46] going too far outside. You know, it's
[59:49] not to keep us bound because Satan does
[59:52] that, right? He tethers you.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; He'll tie you up anytime that he can.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; That's why that's why our whole age
[59:58] right now is anxiety.
[1:00:00] People are so tied up in fear, they're
[1:00:02] so afraid, but the grace of God covers
[1:00:05] that.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; They're so anxious, but the grace of God
[1:00:09] covers that. Satan will tie you up, but
[1:00:11] that's not the kind of tethering we're
[1:00:13] talking about. Those are the kind of
[1:00:14] things that you say, "Satan, get behind
[1:00:15] me." You say, "Booevil to it and get
[1:00:18] that devil out,
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; right? And move on with Christ." All
[1:00:22] right, brother Michael, why don't you
