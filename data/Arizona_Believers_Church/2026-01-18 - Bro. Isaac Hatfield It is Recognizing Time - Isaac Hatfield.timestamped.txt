[0:00] Amen. We'll read just a couple places
[0:01] and then we'll let you be seated.
[0:05] Matthew 16, just something that's been
[0:08] on my heart here in the 13th verse
[0:12] says, "When Jesus came into the coast of
[0:14] Cesaria Philippi, he asked his disciples
[0:17] saying, whom do men say that I, the son
[0:19] of man, am?" And they said, "Some say
[0:21] that thou art John the Baptist, some
[0:22] Elias, and others Jeremiah or one of the
[0:25] prophets?" And he saith unto them, "But
[0:26] whom say ye that I am?" And Simon Peter
[0:30] answered and said, "Thou art the Christ,
[0:31] the Son of the living God." And Jesus
[0:34] answered and said unto him, "Blessed art
[0:36] thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and
[0:38] blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
[0:40] but my father which is in heaven. And I
[0:42] say also unto thee that thou art Peter,
[0:45] and upon this rock I'll build my church,
[0:47] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[0:49] against it. And I will give unto thee
[0:52] the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and
[0:53] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[0:55] shall be bound in heaven. whatsoever
[0:57] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[0:58] loosed in heaven. Then charged he his
[1:01] disciples that they should tell no man
[1:03] that he was Jesus the Christ. And one
[1:05] more place in 1 John 4.
[1:08] 1 John 4.
[1:14] We'll just read the first four verses.
[1:17] When you have it, say amen. Amen.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; 1 John 4 says, "Beloved, believe not
[1:25] every spirit, but try the spirits
[1:27] whether they are of God, because many
[1:29] false prophets are gone out into the
[1:31] world. Hereby know ye the spirit of God.
[1:34] Every spirit that confessth that Jesus
[1:35] Christ is come in the flesh is of God.
[1:39] And every spirit that confesseth not
[1:40] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[1:42] is not of God. And this is that spirit
[1:44] of Antichrist. Where have you have heard
[1:45] that it should come? And even now
[1:47] already it is in the world. And now we
[1:50] want to look at this. Ye are of God,
[1:51] little children, and have overcome them
[1:53] because greater is he that's in you than
[1:56] he that is in the world. And could we
[1:58] bow our heads for a word of prayer? If
[2:00] you have a need on your heart, why don't
[2:03] you just make it known unto the Lord
[2:05] tonight? I believe he sees the very
[2:08] depths of your heart.
[2:10] Heavenly Father, we want to come before
[2:12] you this evening, Lord. We want to
[2:14] recognize you in our midst, Father. That
[2:16] you are the same yesterday, today, and
[2:19] forever, Lord. That you are a mighty big
[2:21] God, Lord, that knows the hearts of
[2:23] these young people. Father, I Lord, I
[2:26] could stab in the dark and try to guess
[2:28] at what they're going through, Lord.
[2:30] But Father, how fruitless that would be,
[2:32] Father, when your word is a discerner of
[2:34] the thoughts and intents of the heart,
[2:36] Father, when you know exactly what
[2:38] they're going through. You know the very
[2:40] thoughts that keep them up at night,
[2:42] Lord. You know the burdens that they
[2:44] carry, Father. And we ask, Lord, that
[2:45] you would come into our midst tonight.
[2:48] Take control of this service. Take
[2:50] control of our vessel, Father. I pray
[2:52] you just keep us in line with your word.
[2:54] That we would only speak what you would
[2:55] have us to say, Father. and may you just
[2:57] be glorified in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[3:01] You may be seated.
[3:03] I also want to say welcome my wife and
[3:06] little boy with me, Spencer. So if you
[3:09] hear a little baby or little he's not
[3:11] he's two now. So if you hear a little
[3:13] toddler screaming, it's probably him.
[3:16] Amen. So we want to speak tonight if
[3:17] that's okay for a few moments on it is
[3:19] recognizing time. or if uh if a little
[3:23] sub thought that might help is the power
[3:25] of recognition
[3:27] because that's what we want to do as we
[3:29] come into the service tonight is we're
[3:30] working for one purpose as brother
[3:32] Brandon would tell us in the message the
[3:34] presence of God on recognize he said
[3:36] we're working for one purpose and that
[3:39] is to recognize the presence of Jesus
[3:41] Christ because if he is present then
[3:43] everything is settled and and I know the
[3:46] Bible says that wherever two or three
[3:47] are gathered in his name there I'll be
[3:49] in the midst of them and so I believe
[3:51] that he is here tonight by his word. We
[3:54] can identify that he is in our midst.
[3:56] Amen. Because we've come, we've gathered
[3:58] in his name. Amen. There's a lot of
[3:59] things that you could be doing tonight
[4:01] besides coming to church. Amen. [snorts]
[4:03] But you've come and I believe that
[4:05] you've come because Amen. you want more
[4:07] of God. You've come to receive something
[4:09] from the Lord. I I don't believe that
[4:11] you're just here to fill a pew, but I
[4:13] believe that that each one of us wants
[4:15] to come higher in our walk with the
[4:17] Lord. Each one of us wants to grow in
[4:19] the Lord. And so we want to recognize
[4:21] his presence and say, "Lord, if you are
[4:23] here, everything is settled. Lord, I
[4:25] want to get something from you tonight."
[4:27] Amen. And I believe that there's power
[4:29] in recognition. And there's three things
[4:31] that we want to recognize. And I believe
[4:32] that all three are taking place in this
[4:35] service tonight. And we want to
[4:37] recognize God. We want to recognize our
[4:39] enemy, the devil. And we want to
[4:40] recognize ourselves because that's what
[4:43] it would say in 1 John 4. We find all
[4:45] three categories. It said, "Ye are of
[4:47] God, little children, and have overcome
[4:49] them." Amen. That's the devil. Because
[4:52] greater is he that is in you than he
[4:55] that is in the world. Amen. Your enemy.
[4:57] And so, we want to recognize, Amen,
[4:59] tonight. Amen. The things that are
[5:01] taking place. And recognize would be to
[5:03] identify someone or something maybe from
[5:05] a previous encounter or to acknowledge
[5:08] something's existence validity or
[5:10] legality or to perceive clearly or to
[5:13] realize. So we find that recognizing has
[5:15] no impact on identity. Recognizing is
[5:18] not making something become something.
[5:20] It's not it's not changing what
[5:23] something is. Recognizing is purely
[5:25] [snorts] seeing what something already
[5:27] is. It's just ex just your eyes are
[5:30] becoming open to what something already
[5:31] is as you recognize it. Is that right?
[5:33] So as you're driving down the road and
[5:35] you see maybe you see a light down the
[5:38] street and you're wondering what is
[5:39] that? And and you're confused because
[5:41] you don't know what it is. And as you
[5:43] get closer, you start to see you say
[5:45] maybe it's a car or maybe it's a a train
[5:48] or you you don't know what it is. And as
[5:49] you get closer, you see what it is and
[5:51] maybe it's a a man walking down the road
[5:53] with a flashlight or something and you
[5:54] say, "Wow, now I know what it is." And
[5:57] and I'm no longer confused. Because when
[5:59] you recognize, confusion leaves. That's
[6:01] why it's so important that we recognize
[6:04] because Satan would like to keep you in
[6:06] confusion. Because if you don't
[6:08] recognize who you are, Amen. Then it
[6:10] gives room for confusion to come in. And
[6:12] the minute that Satan can try to make
[6:14] you think that you're not a son or
[6:16] daughter of God, then immediately
[6:17] confusion comes in. And you say, "Why am
[6:20] I going through this? If I had the Holy
[6:22] Ghost, why would I be battling this? If
[6:24] I was a son or daughter, why would I be
[6:26] dealing with these temptations and these
[6:28] things?" But but we know that temptation
[6:30] isn't sin. Is that right? Temptation is
[6:33] not sin. And so you may be tempted and
[6:36] you may be tried and you can still be a
[6:38] son or daughter of God. But if Satan
[6:40] would try to make you think that you're
[6:41] not, then you'll be confused. Every time
[6:43] you have a battle, every time you have a
[6:45] hard day, you'll be confused about why
[6:47] you're going through this. But if you
[6:49] know who you are, then the confusion
[6:51] leaves and you know that it's just a
[6:53] test. It's just a trial that you're
[6:55] going through. Amen. So, we must
[6:57] recognize and we must recognize the God
[7:00] that's in our midst because you know the
[7:02] disciples one day were out rowing on a
[7:04] boat and there was a spirit walking to
[7:06] them along the water and when they
[7:08] didn't recognize who it was they said
[7:10] it's a spirit and they were very afraid
[7:12] but when they recognized that it was
[7:14] Jesus and he said it is I be not afraid
[7:17] then the confusion left and faith came
[7:19] into their heart to know that that was
[7:21] the one moving in their midst. Amen. And
[7:24] sometimes when the spirit of God is
[7:26] moving through the church, it can be a
[7:27] fearful thing. Amen. Maybe especially to
[7:30] a little child. But when you recognize
[7:32] that, that's nothing to be scared of.
[7:34] That's Jesus. And he's come to calm the
[7:36] storms. He's come to minister to the
[7:38] needs of your heart and it takes the
[7:40] fear away. It takes the confusion away.
[7:43] Because the reason that there's
[7:44] confusion, Brother Brandon would say, is
[7:46] that it's not that Jesus isn't here, but
[7:48] it's that the churches and the people
[7:50] are trying to keep him outside of
[7:52] [snorts] the door. And so they're left
[7:53] in darkness, in confusion. And so if
[7:56] you're in confusion tonight, we just
[7:58] want to say, "Lord, I'm here to open
[8:00] every door tonight. Lord, I'm here to
[8:01] let you in and take the confusion away
[8:04] because I don't want to be confused any
[8:06] longer." Amen. Because there's confusion
[8:09] because it's a dark and dismal day. And
[8:12] it's in the darkness when you have
[8:13] trouble seeing what things are. It's in
[8:16] the darkness. If you're awake at night
[8:18] and you see a coat hanging on the chair,
[8:21] that coat could be a hundred different
[8:22] things in the middle of the night. Is
[8:24] that right? And all of a sudden you're
[8:26] you're afraid and you're scared. But
[8:27] when the light comes on, amen, it takes
[8:30] the fear away and it takes the confusion
[8:32] away. Amen. And it lets you know, amen,
[8:34] who you are, amen, and what you're
[8:37] dealing with. Amen. Because brother
[8:40] Brandham said that it would be a day
[8:41] when people would be hungering and
[8:43] thirsting. there would be a famine in
[8:45] the land for the hearing of the word of
[8:48] God. And and I just want to say for a
[8:50] moment how blessed you are, young
[8:52] people, to have this message preached to
[8:54] you every week. Amen. Service after
[8:56] service to have 1,200 tapes that you can
[8:59] turn on and hear the truth because the
[9:01] world doesn't have that. And that's why
[9:03] they're in confusion. Amen. You are not
[9:06] in the confusion that the majority of
[9:08] the world is because of the message that
[9:10] we have been given in this day that has
[9:12] rolled the clouds away and brought
[9:15] clarity to who we are, why we're here,
[9:18] what's taking place in this hour. Amen.
[9:20] Because of the message of the hour, we
[9:22] are a blessed people tonight. Amen. But
[9:26] brother Brandon would say that you got
[9:28] to have something to base faith on. And
[9:31] you can't base faith upon confusion. You
[9:34] see why how important it is that we must
[9:36] get the confusion out of our minds
[9:38] because you can't base faith on
[9:40] confusion. And I'm sure that you can
[9:42] identify with that because as a young
[9:44] person growing up, I can identify with
[9:46] that. That when confusion is there about
[9:49] who you are or if you are a son of God,
[9:51] if God even hears your prayers, then you
[9:54] no longer have access to that faith. But
[9:57] when that confusion can lead, then faith
[9:59] can have a place to stand on. And you
[10:01] say, "No, I am a son of God." And the
[10:04] Bible says that I can enter boldly into
[10:06] the throne room of God and ask and
[10:09] receive the petitions that I ask for
[10:12] because I'm a son of God. Amen, brother
[10:14] Will. We can pray a prayer and know that
[10:16] I'm not praying to some man. I'm not
[10:18] praying to some stranger. I'm praying to
[10:20] my father. And my father is not a is not
[10:23] a father that if you would ask for a
[10:25] fish that he would give you a stone or
[10:27] if you would ask for bread that he would
[10:29] give you a stone. But we serve a father
[10:31] who knows the desires of your heart. And
[10:33] if you're hungry for the Holy Ghost, if
[10:36] you're hungry for joy, if you're hungry
[10:38] for peace, he's not going to say, "No,
[10:40] no, I'm going to give you heartaches and
[10:42] trouble instead." He wants to give you
[10:44] the desires of your heart. And if he
[10:46] does give you heartaches and trouble,
[10:48] it's for your good. Amen. And it's for
[10:51] your glory because he's a loving father.
[10:54] Amen. And there's no father like the
[10:56] heavenly father. Amen. Because he knows
[10:58] what you're going through. He knows the
[11:00] battles you face when you go to school.
[11:02] He knows the temptations because he
[11:04] condescended and took on flesh and was
[11:07] tempted in every manner like as we are.
[11:10] That's why this song can say that he's
[11:12] the sympathizing Jesus because he can be
[11:15] touched by the feelings of your
[11:17] infirmities because of the things he
[11:19] went through. Amen. I Amen. I'll be
[11:21] careful here because this is just fresh.
[11:24] But he actually faced temptation maybe
[11:26] that young boy's face and young girls
[11:28] face. He had to face those things as a
[11:30] man in the flesh. And you think nobody
[11:33] knows what I'm going through. The pastor
[11:35] don't know what I'm going through. But
[11:36] Jesus knows what you're going through
[11:38] because he took on flesh and he went
[11:40] through exact same thing. And he
[11:42] overcame it. And he didn't overcome it
[11:44] by some great supernatural calling
[11:46] lightning over out of heaven. that he
[11:48] overcame it by the word to show that the
[11:51] weakest Christian Amen. You say, "I'm
[11:52] the weakest Christian, brother Isaac."
[11:54] Well, praise God. He did it to show that
[11:56] the weakest Christian can overcome the
[11:58] devil. Amen. By the word of God, that
[12:00] you can stand toe-to-toe with the devil
[12:03] and overcome them by it is written. I I
[12:05] think it was Brother Wayne that said,
[12:07] you know, sometimes it may be a great
[12:08] big devil. You may not be able to see
[12:10] eye to eye with that devil, but you can
[12:12] stand toe-to-toe with every devil
[12:14] because no matter how small you think
[12:15] you are, you are on the same grounds and
[12:18] you can defeat him on the grounds of
[12:19] thus sayeth the Lord, it is written, I
[12:22] am a son of God. Amen. Healing is mine,
[12:24] joy is mine. Amen. But Satan will attack
[12:28] your identity because he doesn't want
[12:30] you to recognize who you are. That's why
[12:32] brother Brandon would say, you know,
[12:34] maybe brother Aaron says, if you if you
[12:36] desire to be saved, raise your hand.
[12:38] Amen. And when you raise your hand,
[12:40] Amen. According to that promise, there
[12:42] is something supernatural taking place.
[12:44] If you actually meant that from your
[12:46] heart and you are accepting God as your
[12:48] savior, something is taking place in
[12:50] that moment that is very supernatural.
[12:53] If you really mean that from your heart,
[12:55] but that's where Satan will come in and
[12:56] say, "Oh, there was nothing to that.
[12:58] There was nothing to raising your hand.
[13:00] There was nothing to coming to that
[13:01] altar. There was nothing to going
[13:03] through that prayer line. You went to
[13:05] that youth camp and and you had a real
[13:07] experience, but there was nothing to
[13:08] that. Amen. But that's a lie from the
[13:10] devil to try to get you to think, Amen,
[13:13] that the experiences that you're having
[13:15] are not real experiences. Amen. But the
[13:17] word of God is nothing but the truth.
[13:20] Amen. And if you're responding to the
[13:22] word of God from an honest heart, God is
[13:24] there to meet you. And the things that
[13:25] you are experiencing are true
[13:27] experiences. And that's where you drive
[13:29] down a steak and say, "Satan, no. I know
[13:32] who you are. You're a liar. You're a
[13:34] thief. You've come to steal, kill, and
[13:36] destroy. So why would I believe your
[13:38] voice when the heavenly father said that
[13:40] I am saved? Amen. That if I repent and
[13:43] be baptized, I shall receive the gift of
[13:45] the Holy Ghost. Amen. That amen. That
[13:47] I've already passed from death onto life
[13:49] because I believed on the Lord Jesus
[13:52] Christ and received, Amen, the
[13:54] confirmation of his spirit in my life.
[13:56] Amen. He's a lying devil trying to get
[13:59] you, Amen, to to think that you're that
[14:02] you're not having a real encounter.
[14:04] Amen. But that's all he is is a liar and
[14:06] the father of lies. Amen. But Satan
[14:10] don't want you to recognize because when
[14:12] Peter recognized who Christ was and who
[14:15] he was, the Lord would speak back. Amen.
[14:17] That upon this rock I'll build my
[14:19] church. And that wasn't upon Peter. And
[14:22] that wasn't upon any man. But that was
[14:24] upon the rock of revelation. Is that
[14:27] right? And he said, "Upon the rock of
[14:28] revelation, I'll build my church, and
[14:30] the gates of hell will not prevail
[14:32] against that rock of revelation." That's
[14:35] why Satan don't want you to recognize
[14:36] who you are. Because if you ever
[14:38] recognize who you are and who Christ is,
[14:41] then brother, Satan is in trouble. Amen.
[14:44] The youngest one in this building could
[14:46] get a revelation of who he is and it'll
[14:49] run, Amen, the devil right out the door
[14:51] because he cannot overcome that rock of
[14:53] revelation. [snorts] Amen. You could be
[14:56] talked into it and talked out of it. But
[14:58] brother, if revelation ever strikes your
[15:00] heart, the gates of hell cannot prevail
[15:03] against that revelation. [snorts]
[15:05] Satan hates revelation. Brother Bram
[15:07] said he hates the two books and that's
[15:09] Genesis and Revelations because it
[15:11] reveals his ways. He said we find his
[15:14] origin. We find his awful ways and we
[15:17] find his destruction. And the devil
[15:20] cannot change the word and the devil
[15:22] cannot prove it wrong. So what he wants
[15:24] to do is destroy your confidence in the
[15:26] word. He wants to destroy your faith in
[15:29] this word because he can't make the word
[15:31] less powerful, but he can attack your
[15:34] faith in the power of the word. And
[15:36] that's what he's after tonight. But
[15:38] brother Brandon said, "When the church
[15:39] disbelieves Satan and believes the
[15:42] spirit's revelation of the word, the
[15:44] gates of hell cannot prevail against
[15:46] her." Oh my. Satan hates revelation.
[15:49] Brother Brandham said, "Because it
[15:50] upsets his plans." You see, Satan would
[15:53] have a plan for you sisters, and he
[15:55] would have a plan for you brothers to
[15:57] take you out into the world and to do
[15:59] all kinds of things to you. But, amen,
[16:01] Satan's plans are upset when God's
[16:03] revelation comes into your heart. Amen.
[16:06] I'm sure there's a lot of you that are
[16:07] here tonight that Satan had plans for
[16:09] you. Amen. [snorts] But there's
[16:11] something anchored inside your heart
[16:12] that has upset the plans of the devil.
[16:15] Amen. because you've received more than
[16:16] just a good sermon from brother Aaron.
[16:19] But the revelation that's come off those
[16:20] tapes that he's been studying has found
[16:23] its way into the depths of your heart.
[16:25] And it's more than just mama said so.
[16:27] It's more than just daddy said so. It's
[16:29] more than just grandma or grandpa said
[16:31] so. But when revelation finds its way
[16:33] into your heart, then it's a personal
[16:36] experience where you can drive down a
[16:38] steak and say, "Satan, you can no longer
[16:40] kick me around like a football. Amen. I
[16:42] have been established in the revelation
[16:44] and you cannot overcome me. Amen. Like
[16:47] the you all know the quote I'm sure as
[16:49] young people that Amen. when when she
[16:51] when when she recognizes who she is and
[16:53] the true church and these things that
[16:55] she will be an invincible army when she
[16:58] can discern amen those two spirits
[17:00] working within the church. You will
[17:02] become an invincible army because Satan
[17:06] hates revelation. Because brother Bram
[17:07] said he hates to be exposed. He hates to
[17:11] be exposed. And brother Brandham said
[17:12] you can be in a meeting and watch as
[17:14] that discernment would take place. He
[17:16] said you look at the face of someone
[17:18] when the enemy is about to be exposed.
[17:20] He said their countenance would change
[17:22] because the word is exposing the enemy.
[17:25] And I believe that it's time that we can
[17:27] expose the devil tonight. Amen. Because
[17:29] it's time amen that the word begins to
[17:31] expose. Amen. It's through the preaching
[17:33] of the word. Amen. That it begins to
[17:35] expose. Amen. As you're listening to
[17:37] those tapes, Amen. There's not that's
[17:40] not just Amen. filling time. Amen. As
[17:42] you're listening, it's exposing spirits.
[17:45] It's exposing the fear in your life as a
[17:48] liar. It's exposing the pressures that
[17:50] you're going through. Amen. A as the
[17:53] enemy and not as your identity. Amen.
[17:56] But it's exposing the enemy. Amen. It's
[17:59] exposing his voice in your mind. Someone
[18:02] asked brother Brandon, "Brother Brandon,
[18:03] please explain explain how a person
[18:05] knows if he is thinking his own thoughts
[18:08] or if the devil is placing thoughts in
[18:10] his mind to make him think wrong.
[18:12] Especially if you do not if you do not
[18:15] want to thank them." Amen. Are we all
[18:18] angels in here or does that speak to
[18:19] anybody? Amen. Have you ever been there?
[18:21] Is it just me and Brother Steve? Amen.
[18:24] But he says, "If it's contrary to the
[18:27] word, it's the devil's thinking. And if
[18:29] it's with the word, it's God's thinking.
[18:32] If it's the wrong thoughts, it's the
[18:33] devil. If it's good thoughts of the word
[18:35] and God, it's God's thinking. And then
[18:38] they asked how to overcome that. And he
[18:39] said, "Take the vice versa from it." If
[18:42] the devil makes you think, if you know
[18:44] you're a Christian and he tries to make
[18:45] you think you're not one, take the vice
[18:47] versa and say, "I am a Christian."
[18:49] [laughter] As long as your experience
[18:51] matches God's word, say, "I'm a
[18:53] Christian." Anything else the same way.
[18:55] Amen. The word begins to expose the
[18:57] devil in your mind. and you say, "I had
[18:59] a bad thought, Brother Isaac." Well, if
[19:00] it's contrary to the word, it wasn't
[19:02] your thought. It was the devil's thought
[19:04] because your mind is a battleground. And
[19:07] he'll try to put all kinds of thoughts
[19:08] in your mind. Amen. But if it's contrary
[19:10] to the word, you just take the opposite
[19:12] and say, "No, I'm a Christian. No, I'm
[19:15] saved. No, I'm born again. No, I'm going
[19:17] in a rapture." And you just start taking
[19:19] the opposite and you start exposing the
[19:21] devil for who he is. He's a liar.
[19:23] [laughter]
[19:24] Amen. Because you might be worried that
[19:26] the devil's going to expose you tonight.
[19:28] You say, "One of these days, Brother
[19:29] Isaac, I'm going to be exposed for who I
[19:32] really am. I'm going to be exposed for a
[19:34] failure. I'm going to be exposed. I'm
[19:36] never going to make it. I'm going to be
[19:37] exposed as just a as just a lukewarm
[19:40] religious Christian and Satan's going to
[19:42] expose me because because I I surely I'm
[19:45] just a hypocrite. Surely I'm just a
[19:47] Judas. Uh surely I'm just this and
[19:49] that." But but as a word goes forth, it
[19:52] begins to expose the enemy. I mean, as
[19:54] the enemy is exposed, it exposes you for
[19:57] who you really are. [laughter] You see,
[19:59] brother Brandon was in a meeting one
[20:00] time. I'm sure you all know it. And
[20:02] there was two I mean, FBI agents, they
[20:06] said, that were going to come and expose
[20:07] brother Brandham for a liar and a all
[20:10] kinds of false prophets and things. And
[20:12] those two FBI agents came into the
[20:15] meeting. And brother Brandham was
[20:16] waiting on him said, "Go ahead and
[20:18] expose me. If I can be exposed, then
[20:20] bring the word and expose me. I want to
[20:22] be exposed. Amen. But as those as he
[20:26] waited, they wouldn't come. And then he
[20:28] began to say, "It's not two FBI agents.
[20:30] It's two backsliden preachers." Amen.
[20:33] And a And you see how the enemy was
[20:36] threatening to expose and threatening to
[20:38] expose. Amen. But the the spirit of the
[20:40] Lord came on the scene and instead of
[20:42] exposing brother Brandham as false, it
[20:44] exposed those two preachers as an under
[20:47] a bad spirit. And it exposed Brother
[20:49] Brandham as a true prophet of God. Amen.
[20:51] And that's what Satan's trying to
[20:53] threaten you. I'm going to expose you.
[20:54] I'm going to expose you. I'm going to
[20:56] expose you as false. I'm going to expose
[20:58] you as a Judas. And Amen. But as a word
[21:00] comes forth that says, "No, that is a
[21:03] lying spirit." And it's just in your
[21:04] mind trying to attack you. And the word
[21:06] begins to expose you as a son and
[21:08] daughter of God. Amen. That's hungering
[21:11] and thirsting after a living God. Amen.
[21:13] Satan is trying to expose you, but his
[21:15] plan is going to backfire because the
[21:17] more he pushes you and the more he
[21:19] presses you, he begins to press you into
[21:22] a closer walk with God, he begins to
[21:24] press you into the revelation of who you
[21:26] really are and then it'll backfire on
[21:28] him because then he won't be able to
[21:30] bother you anymore because you'll know
[21:32] where you stand. The word of God is a
[21:35] discerner and exposes Satan.
[21:38] Because Jacob, the Bible says, you might
[21:40] have thought Jacob was a shyer. Jacob
[21:42] was a deceiver, but the word of God
[21:44] exposed him and said, "Jacob have I
[21:46] loved and Esau have I hated." You say,
[21:48] "I'm a doubter, brother Isaac." But the
[21:50] word could expose that Thomas might have
[21:53] had times in his life where he doubted,
[21:55] but he went to that upper room and his
[21:57] name was on the Lamb's book of life and
[21:58] he was a son of God. Amen. That's why we
[22:01] preach the word. That's why we study the
[22:03] word. That's why we amen pray not just
[22:05] for Amen just for empty reading but we
[22:08] say Lord we pray for brother Bram said
[22:10] how important revelation is. We should
[22:12] pray for it more than anything. Is that
[22:14] right? Because when that revelation
[22:16] comes [laughter]
[22:17] it exposes the enemy and the new birth
[22:20] is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[22:22] personally to you. Amen. We need
[22:25] revelation in our lives. This message
[22:27] has called come to call us out of
[22:29] darkness and confusion. And [snorts]
[22:32] this is where we get our title. It is
[22:34] recognizing time. But brother Brandham
[22:35] preached a message recognizing your day
[22:37] and its message. Now, now, now just stay
[22:40] with me because these things [snorts]
[22:41] aren't so deep as we might think they
[22:43] are times. But he preached this message
[22:46] recognizing your day and its message.
[22:48] And he's talking about how Hosea
[22:51] prophesied that that and I'll just read
[22:54] it for you in Hosea 6:2. says, "After
[22:57] two days will he'll he revive us and in
[22:59] the third day he will raise us up and we
[23:01] shall live in his sight." Now, Brother
[23:04] Brandham picks that up and he's
[23:05] preaching about it'll be after three
[23:07] days that Israel will be gathered to
[23:10] recognize their Messiah. Now, now,
[23:12] Brother Brandham's preaching this 2,700
[23:14] [clears throat]
[23:15] years after Hosea had prophesied that.
[23:18] And he's saying this is the third day
[23:20] and this is why Israel is gathering.
[23:23] They're gathering because they're going
[23:24] to recognize their Messiah one of these
[23:26] days very soon. And brother Bonham
[23:28] begins to bring it out and say, "Now,
[23:30] why are all these nations waking up?"
[23:32] And he's saying, "Why is science waking
[23:34] up?" He said, "Before they used to think
[23:36] that you could only go at the speed of
[23:39] 30 m an hour. Now you can travel like
[23:42] 17,000 m an hour." And they went from
[23:45] the horse and buggy to the car to the
[23:47] airplane to the astronaut. And he's
[23:49] saying, "Why are all these things taking
[23:51] place?" He's saying [snorts] it couldn't
[23:53] happen till now. He's saying this is the
[23:55] time of recognition. That's why
[23:57] everybody's beginning to recognize. But
[24:00] I want you to catch something out of
[24:02] that that that that the season is coming
[24:06] one of these days where Israel will
[24:08] recognize their Messiah. That'll be
[24:09] after we're gone to glory. And so that's
[24:12] their season. So if their season is
[24:14] coming, Brother Elliot, then this must
[24:16] be our season. This must be our time to
[24:19] recognize. This must be our time to
[24:21] awaken. Brother Brandon would preach and
[24:24] preach and preach and he say there's
[24:25] also an awakening of the bride. Amen.
[24:28] The message that Brother Brandon
[24:29] preached has awoken a bride. That's why
[24:31] I can declare unto you tonight. It is
[24:34] recognizing time. I'm not just saying
[24:36] that as a loose term. I'm saying that by
[24:38] the message of the hour. This is our
[24:40] season. This is our time to recognize
[24:43] who we are. This is our time to
[24:44] recognize that we are not just living in
[24:47] a day gone by. We are living in the
[24:49] season where all things are possible. We
[24:51] are living in the season where the word
[24:53] has become open. The seven se Amen mean
[24:56] friends. It's not it's not a scary seven
[24:58] seals. Sir Paul, I'm sure you're you're
[25:00] I believe you're a very well taught
[25:02] church. Those aren't scary things. Amen.
[25:04] That's for you young people. That's for
[25:06] Amen. From the oldest to the youngest,
[25:08] that's for you. Amen. That's for all of
[25:10] us. Amen. It's God has poured out
[25:12] himself into this age. Amen. that the
[25:14] young people could have an experience
[25:16] with the living God that amen prophets
[25:19] years hundreds and thousands of years
[25:21] ago longed to have the type of
[25:24] experience that we are having in this
[25:26] day. Amen. It is recognizing time
[25:29] recognizing a season that all things are
[25:32] possible to us in this hour. Amen.
[25:35] That's why we don't want to fall under
[25:37] the fault of looking back to some Amen
[25:40] to just our parents. Amen. Okay. They
[25:42] they used to have such wonderful
[25:43] meetings. They used to have such
[25:45] wonderful camps. And maybe they did, but
[25:48] we're in another day.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Jesus was on the scene,
[25:52] the Pharisees would look back to Moses
[25:54] day and say, "Oh, amen. Moses said this
[25:57] and Moses said that." And Jesus would
[25:58] say, "If you would have believed Moses,
[26:00] you would believe me. You would have
[26:02] recognized me." Amen. But the church is
[26:05] always looking back. back. And brother
[26:07] Brand said how you can't look through a
[26:08] rearview mirror or you're going to wreck
[26:11] up. That's why Satan's tactic would try
[26:14] to keep you looking back, always looking
[26:16] back to the mistake you made yesterday.
[26:18] Always looking back to last week.
[26:20] Looking back to the last youth camp,
[26:22] saying we had wonderful time at youth
[26:24] camp. Amen. But he's the same yesterday,
[26:27] today, and forever. And we're thankful
[26:29] for the times behind us, and we're
[26:31] looking forward to the times ahead of us
[26:33] if God should terry. But he's saying
[26:35] right now, amen, now we are sons of God.
[26:38] Now I am ever present in the service
[26:40] tonight on a Sunday night in the middle
[26:43] of January. The same God, Amen, that met
[26:45] your parents and your grandparents is
[26:47] here tonight saying, "If you'll just
[26:49] recognize it, I'm here tonight and I can
[26:51] meet you the same way as I met them."
[26:53] Amen. It's revival time. Amen. The bride
[26:56] is in revival because the word has come
[26:59] into our age. Amen. It's not Amen. I
[27:01] know the church sometimes goes through
[27:03] highs and lows and amen. That's just
[27:05] part of the way of life. Amen. But you
[27:07] can be in revival. Amen. Even on a
[27:10] Sunday night, amen. Amen. It may not
[27:12] seem like a significant service, but if
[27:14] you're hungry for God, he is here to
[27:16] meet the hungers of your heart and say,
[27:19] "Let him that is hungry come. Let him
[27:21] that thirst come and drink from this
[27:23] well." Amen. He is an inexhaustible
[27:26] fountain that is open tonight for the
[27:28] hungry heart. It said, "If you hunger
[27:30] and thirst after righteousness, you
[27:32] shall be filled." You say, "Uh, but I
[27:35] make too many mistakes, brother Isaac. I
[27:37] failed too many times." Brother Brandham
[27:40] had an interview with a sister named
[27:41] Sister Bruce one time who was doubting
[27:43] whether or not she had a real experience
[27:45] because she made so many mistakes. And
[27:47] brother Brandham said, "But sister,
[27:48] that's why Jesus Christ had to die. that
[27:51] even in your mistakes, Amen, there's a
[27:53] blood that you can put your mistakes
[27:55] under and you don't have to look back
[27:57] any longer to the mistake you made last
[27:59] week. Say, "Brother Isaac, I I looked at
[28:01] something I shouldn't have looked at. I
[28:02] did something I shouldn't have done."
[28:04] Amen. There's a blood tonight. Amen.
[28:06] That you can put your mistakes under and
[28:08] say, "Lord Jesus, I'm going to put it
[28:10] behind me. I'm going to stop looking
[28:12] back. Lord, I need a touch from you
[28:14] tonight. I need a new experience
[28:15] tonight. Lord, I need a fresh baptism
[28:18] tonight. Lord, I I've got to get to that
[28:20] Holy Spirit tonight or I'm going to
[28:22] perish. Lord, I need you. Amen. We're
[28:24] not looking back, but we're moving
[28:26] forward in the promises of God. And
[28:29] maybe maybe maybe even in your heart.
[28:31] Amen. Sometimes uh Amen. If that's okay,
[28:34] we'll we'll just say sometimes you can
[28:36] come to the place where you feel like
[28:38] you need to be rebaptized.
[28:40] Now, according to the scripture, if
[28:42] you've been baptized in the name of the
[28:44] Lord Jesus Christ, then scripturally, I
[28:46] don't believe that you need to be
[28:47] baptized, rebaptized if you've already
[28:50] been baptized. But brother Brandon would
[28:51] say, if anything's in your way, then you
[28:54] should deal with it that you could move
[28:55] forward. Amen. And we wouldn't have to
[28:58] do it maybe scripturally, but brother
[29:00] Brandon would say the pools are open. If
[29:02] it's laying in your way, then we need to
[29:05] get it out of the way that we can move
[29:07] forward in the promises of God. Amen. If
[29:10] there's something we need to make right
[29:12] with our neighbor, something we need to
[29:13] make right with our brother, we just
[29:15] quickly make it right. That way, we can
[29:17] move forward in the promises of God
[29:20] because we're not here to look behind
[29:22] us. We're here to move forward. Amen. We
[29:25] want to we want to see the young people
[29:27] progress. Amen. And you're going to make
[29:30] mistakes. You're going to fall down.
[29:32] Amen. But that's why we need grace.
[29:35] That's why we pre preach second chances
[29:37] and third chances and fifth chances
[29:40] because we're human and we all need the
[29:43] blood or we're helpless. Amen. But
[29:45] that's when you just get back up and
[29:47] keep moving.
[29:49] This is your season to be blessed, young
[29:50] people. This is your season. If you're
[29:53] hungry for a move of God, I'm here to
[29:56] tell you that God still moves. I mean,
[29:58] it was in a youth service just like this
[30:00] on a Sunday night about five years ago
[30:02] in January. I don't know if I thought
[30:05] about that, but it's probably almost uh
[30:07] almost the exact same day, maybe just a
[30:09] week off or something. A brother was
[30:11] preaching and this was over the course
[30:14] of about two or three weeks now. Uh a
[30:17] brother was preaching a youth service
[30:18] and I believe a couple young people
[30:20] received the Holy Ghost in that youth
[30:21] service. And me and another minister, I
[30:24] was just I wasn't really preaching much
[30:25] at that time. I was just about to start.
[30:27] We stayed till about 5 in the morning
[30:30] praying. Amen. I was desperate. I was
[30:33] seeking after something from the Lord. I
[30:35] was so hungry. And over the course of
[30:37] about two or three weeks, I think it was
[30:39] like eight young people received the
[30:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. God
[30:43] just began to pour out a blessing upon
[30:46] our assembly. Amen. As we begin to
[30:48] hunger and I was so desperate, Amen. But
[30:51] God, amen, just be to lead and guide and
[30:54] he be to bring me out of that out of
[30:56] that out of that condition and begin to
[30:59] lead me into higher places with him. But
[31:02] God will meet a desperate [laughter]
[31:04] heart. God will meet a hungry heart even
[31:07] tonight. Amen. Amen. We're not living
[31:09] there. Amen. That was a wonderful
[31:10] experience. But he's the same God
[31:12] tonight. Amen. If you're hungry, he's
[31:16] the same God tonight.
[31:18] The Bible says that when I was a child,
[31:21] I spake as a child and I understood as a
[31:24] child. I thought as a child, but when I
[31:25] became a man, I put away childish
[31:27] things. But now we see through a glass
[31:29] darkly. But then face to face. Now I
[31:31] know in part, but then shall I know even
[31:34] as also I am known. I'm sure there's a a
[31:37] lot of ways you can take that, but but
[31:40] I'll take it with my son. When he was
[31:43] born, we named him Spencer Warren
[31:45] Hatfield. And his name has always been
[31:48] Spencer Warren Hatfield, brother Will.
[31:50] He's that's just his name. That's on his
[31:51] birth certificate. And when when and
[31:53] when he was young, he might not have
[31:55] known who he was. There was a period in
[31:58] his life where maybe he couldn't tell us
[32:00] who he was. If we told him he was
[32:02] something else, then he could believe
[32:03] that. But as he begin to get older, as
[32:06] he begin to understand, as he begin to
[32:08] speak, then he would begin to know that
[32:10] his name was Spencer Warren Hatfield.
[32:12] And I mean, if he's not too shy, he'll
[32:14] tell it to you tonight. What's your
[32:16] name? Spencer Warren Hatfield. And we
[32:18] could say, "Are you a dinosaur?" He
[32:19] said, "No." "Are you a chicken?" "No."
[32:22] "I mean, are are you a cow?" "No, I'm
[32:24] Spencer Warren Hatfield." I mean,
[32:27] because when he was a baby, he he
[32:29] couldn't understand that. But as he beed
[32:31] to grow, as he be to sit under the
[32:33] tutorship of his mother and father,
[32:35] amen, now when the enemy could try to
[32:37] come in and say, "This is what you are."
[32:39] He said, "No, that's not what I am. I'm
[32:41] Spencer Warren Hatfield." And as you
[32:43] begin to sit under this message, young
[32:45] people, as you begin to feed on the word
[32:48] of God, and when you begin to recognize
[32:50] who you are, and when you recognize who
[32:52] you are, then you recognize who you
[32:54] aren't. You say, "I am not defeated. I
[32:56] mean, I am not a devil. I am not a
[32:59] foolish virgin. I am not a hypocrite. I
[33:01] am, amen, a son and daughter of God. I
[33:04] am the bride of Jesus Christ. Because we
[33:06] are coming, amen, into the age of
[33:09] identification and recognition where the
[33:11] message, amen, is telling us who we are.
[33:14] It's telling you, Amen, who you are as a
[33:16] young people saying, you are not a
[33:18] defeated people. You are an invincible
[33:20] army. If you can just recognize who you
[33:23] are. And I I'm a witness tonight that
[33:25] the message still speaks, young people.
[33:27] I mean, when you turn on a tape, there
[33:29] is so much power in listening to these
[33:31] messages that it is not a history voice.
[33:35] I mean, I I can tell you back in
[33:37] probably about 2020, about the same
[33:39] time, I was going through a real hard
[33:41] time and just fighting through that,
[33:43] trying to break through that that sound
[33:44] barrier, trying to break into that elbow
[33:47] room as a son of God. And I was battling
[33:49] with fear and pressure. And I just begin
[33:51] to put on a tape. And brother Brandham
[33:53] gets to preaching away. And he begins to
[33:56] preach in a way. And then he says, and I
[33:58] I'll read it for you. He says, he
[34:00] says,"Now remember by faith, drive down
[34:03] the post right now, right here where
[34:04] you're sitting this day, Sunday the
[34:07] 10th, or I believe it is the 13th, this
[34:09] 13th day of January." I thought,
[34:12] "There's no way in this world, Brother
[34:14] Steve." I looked at my phone. It's the
[34:17] 13th of January. And I began my my
[34:20] interest is perked now. And he says, "In
[34:23] this little church of God, at this
[34:25] certain seat, I'm praying the prayer of
[34:26] faith with the minister, with the
[34:28] evangelist, with the congregation, one
[34:30] praying for the other. This is the day
[34:32] of my healing right now. I'm settling it
[34:34] right here, Lord. I'm your eagle. I'm in
[34:36] the refuge zone." Amen. That was I
[34:39] believe that was for me right there. I
[34:41] have a right to any redemptive blessing
[34:42] that he purchased for me. Here I am
[34:44] right now. Amen. And that drove down a
[34:47] stake in my life from a message that was
[34:50] preached maybe 60 or 70 years ago. Amen.
[34:53] There was another time where I was
[34:55] battling. I had had an experience. I had
[34:57] received the Holy Ghost. But Satan was
[34:58] trying to tell me I didn't have it. And
[35:01] I would pray, "Lord, honestly, if I
[35:02] don't have it, would you give it to me?
[35:04] And if I do have it, would you help me
[35:06] to know that I have it?" And I just got
[35:08] to listening. And I got to listening to
[35:10] a message one Wednesday afternoon. And
[35:12] brother Brandon begins to tell a story
[35:14] about a man who had got a track out of a
[35:16] trash can. And he began to read it.
[35:18] Where will you go when you're saved? And
[35:20] as he began to read it, it began to stir
[35:22] his heart. And he began to walk away
[35:24] from there. And from then on, he was so
[35:26] hungry. He said, "I went to Billy
[35:28] Graham's meeting and they told me, you
[35:30] know, if you speak in tongues, you got
[35:31] it." And he said, "I spoke in tongues."
[35:33] And I just don't have it, Brother
[35:34] Brandham. He said, "I went to this
[35:36] meeting and they said, 'If you do this."
[35:37] And he said, 'I did that and I just
[35:39] don't have it, Brother Brandham. what
[35:40] should I do? And brother Brandham said,
[35:42] "Well, let's look at your life." He
[35:45] said, "Here you were going one way and
[35:48] when you pulled that track out,
[35:49] something happened in your heart and
[35:51] since then you've been going another
[35:53] way." He said, "That was your
[35:55] conversion, brother. That was your
[35:56] conversion. That's where you got it."
[35:58] And he said, "Brother Brandham, you mean
[35:59] I've had it all along?" He said, "Yes,
[36:01] brother. You've had it all along." Amen.
[36:04] And that spoke something to my heart.
[36:06] Amen. But I was just battling, Lord, is
[36:08] that for me? Is that really an answer
[36:10] for me? And I went to church the next
[36:12] night and a brother got up to preach and
[36:14] about 3/4 of the way through he begins
[36:16] to tell that exact same story and he
[36:18] says, "Maybe you don't even know if you
[36:20] have the Holy Ghost tonight, but the
[36:21] word settled it. You've had it all
[36:23] along." And brother, the tears started
[36:26] flowing. I said, "Thank you, Lord. I
[36:28] mean, you still speak." And then a
[36:30] couple days later, a sister who wasn't
[36:32] at church that night, who had been
[36:34] listening to some tapes throughout the
[36:35] night, sent me that exact same story
[36:38] from a different message of that exact
[36:40] same account. And she sent it to me. The
[36:42] only quote she sent to me from those
[36:43] sermons. And it was the same story
[36:45] saying, "The words titled it, you've had
[36:47] it all along." Amen. Out of the mouth of
[36:50] two or three witnesses, I believe the
[36:51] Lord was giving me an answer. And amen,
[36:53] [snorts] that may not be the answer for
[36:55] you. I don't know where you're at
[36:56] tonight, but I'm just letting you know
[36:57] that God still speaks through this
[36:59] message. He still speaks through your
[37:01] pastor. He still speaks through the
[37:03] five-fold ministry. Amen. You can open
[37:05] your Bible and he can answer the very
[37:08] question of your heart because he is the
[37:10] dissolver of doubts and he's here to
[37:12] roll the confusion away. The Holy Ghost
[37:15] today is the dissolver of doubts. And if
[37:17] you're doubting tonight whether or not
[37:19] you have the Holy Ghost, I'm here to
[37:21] tell you that the same God that settled
[37:23] it for me can settle it for you and give
[37:25] you the assurance that you don't have to
[37:27] worry anymore what your future holds.
[37:30] But you can say, "I know who I am. I
[37:32] know I'm going in the rapture. I know
[37:34] I'm going to heaven. I know that I'm
[37:36] saved. I know that I've had an
[37:38] experience in my life." Amen. Because
[37:40] this message identifies. If you want to
[37:44] know what a Christian is supposed to
[37:45] look like, search the message. If you
[37:47] want to know what the prophet for this
[37:49] age is supposed to look like, Brother
[37:51] Elliot, we know what he's supposed to
[37:52] look like. He'll be like Elijah. He'll
[37:54] be a man of the wilderness and all kinds
[37:56] of things because this message
[37:58] identifies all of these things.
[38:02] You know, you could you can study I'm
[38:03] sure I'm sure you all listen to tapes or
[38:06] hear the pastor preach and you hear
[38:08] those prayer lines one after another and
[38:10] after another. We could compile those
[38:12] and write a book about what a nervous
[38:14] spirit is like, what a depression spirit
[38:17] is like, what all kinds of spirits are
[38:19] like because brother Brandham
[38:20] encountered them night after night after
[38:22] night and identified to us what these
[38:25] spirits are and what they do in the
[38:26] lives of people. We can identify them
[38:29] because amen, we've had a message come
[38:33] and it gives us the ability to recognize
[38:35] the devil. You could say, "I'm going
[38:37] through I'm going through something,
[38:38] Brother Isaac." And then you begin to
[38:41] you begin to hear about someone else was
[38:43] going through the same thing. And this
[38:45] is what happened. This is what was this
[38:47] is this is what it was. It was
[38:48] nervousness. It was it was depression.
[38:51] It was something like that. Because this
[38:54] is the season where the devil's roaming
[38:56] to and fro. This is the season and as we
[39:00] brother Ram said the devil has
[39:02] recognized it's time that he can wreck
[39:03] woman, wreck the church, wreck the
[39:04] people. He's recognized it. So, we see
[39:06] the devil has recognized that it's a
[39:07] season where he can try to work in your
[39:09] minds. He can try to work in your
[39:11] hearts. But I'll say this, he only has a
[39:14] season. He's only got a time to work.
[39:17] His time is limited. He's got a I mean,
[39:19] his future's going to come to an end
[39:21] quickly. That's why he's fighting so
[39:23] hard right now. But, but even though
[39:26] it's his season, God has equipped us
[39:28] with the ability to recognize and
[39:30] overcome the devil in this age. Because
[39:32] that's what brother Brandham said
[39:34] overcoming is. is he said it means to
[39:36] recognize the devil in every one of his
[39:38] tricks. A lot of people say there is no
[39:40] devil. It's just a thought. Don't you
[39:42] believe that there's a real devil. He's
[39:44] just as real as you or anybody a real
[39:46] devil. And you must recognize him real.
[39:48] All right. There's one thing you must
[39:50] recognize. You must know he's a devil.
[39:52] Then at the same time, you must
[39:53] recognize him. Know that he's a devil
[39:55] and he's against you. Then to overcome,
[39:58] you must recognize that the God in you
[39:59] is greater and mightier than he. that
[40:02] the one that's in you has already
[40:03] overcome him and by his grace you are
[40:05] more than a match for him that's real
[40:07] overcoming when you recognize Amen. You
[40:11] must recognize that he's real. How many
[40:13] believes the devil is real tonight?
[40:15] Amen. Hey me and this brother do I mean
[40:18] he's a real devil just like Jesus Christ
[40:21] is a real person.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; He said some people say it's he's just a
[40:25] thought. He said no he's a real person
[40:27] and so is the devil real. He's a real
[40:30] just like sicknesses sometimes we call
[40:32] them cancer or this or that. He said
[40:34] it's spirits. It's it's the devil at
[40:36] work but he's a real devil and you must
[40:38] recognize that he is against you.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon would actually say
[40:43] if he isn't after you that means he's
[40:46] got you. So if he's fighting you tonight
[40:48] that means he hasn't got you yet. And he
[40:51] said just keep moving on. He hasn't got
[40:54] you yet. So if the devil's fighting you
[40:56] tonight, you ought to let out a shout
[40:57] and say, "Glory to God." And he doesn't
[41:00] have me. And if I just keep moving
[41:02] forward, he won't be able to get me. But
[41:04] I know that he's against me. Say, "Why
[41:06] am I thinking these thoughts, Brother
[41:07] Isaac? Because the devil's against you.
[41:10] Why am I battling these things? Because
[41:11] the devil's against you. Why am I going
[41:13] through this? Because the devil's
[41:15] against you." And Brother Brandham said,
[41:16] "He has a right to that punch. Maybe
[41:19] what you battle is different than what I
[41:21] battle, but he has a right to that punch
[41:23] in your life." life. Brother Brand said,
[41:24] "That's why you got to guard that spot
[41:26] because Satan will try to hit you with
[41:29] that punch." Amen. And we shouldn't try
[41:31] to live at peace with our enemy because
[41:33] he's our enemy. Amen. If you're battling
[41:36] something tonight, Amen. That's not the
[41:38] time to camp down and say, "I guess I'll
[41:40] just I guess I'll just live this way the
[41:42] rest of my life." No, that that won't
[41:44] work. That won't work. You'll never amen
[41:47] have a happy life if you try to amen
[41:49] settle down and live with the devil.
[41:51] Amen. But you must recognize that he's
[41:53] against you and that he's your
[41:55] adversary. And you must recognize his
[41:58] tricks. What's some of his tricks? One
[42:00] of them is that after a great experience
[42:03] that you have with the Lord, maybe on a
[42:06] special meetings or Sunday morning,
[42:07] Satan will always try to come behind
[42:09] that experience and try to make you to
[42:11] doubt that experience. Amen. And that's
[42:14] where you must recognize that it's a
[42:15] trick of the devil. And don't listen to
[42:17] that voice. Amen. He'll try to trick
[42:20] you. Brother Brandham said that he one
[42:22] of the devil's tricks today is to break
[42:24] faith from the young generation and such
[42:26] nonsense as that talking about Darwin
[42:29] and all this stuff theories and science.
[42:31] He's trying to break faith away from our
[42:34] young people. Amen. And we must
[42:36] recognize that it's the devil. He'll try
[42:38] to break your faith away from this
[42:40] message as being the truth. Amen. But
[42:42] you must discern that it is a lying
[42:45] spirit. Amen. You say, "Oh, you just got
[42:47] your head stuck in the sand." Amen. you
[42:49] guys aren't listening to the truth or
[42:51] this and it's a devil and he'll take you
[42:54] amen into a very very bad place. Amen.
[42:58] But by the grace of God, we've been
[42:59] given the spirit to discern that that is
[43:01] an enemy. Amen. That we might overcome
[43:04] them. But here's what we want to look at
[43:06] tonight. He says, "And they were very
[43:07] downcast and it's so easily to become
[43:11] especially when you are oppressed."
[43:13] That's what the devil likes to work on
[43:14] you and oppress you. You know, that's a
[43:17] trick of the devil to oppress. But when
[43:19] the Christian knows his legal rights,
[43:21] when you can quote God's word, I'll
[43:23] never leave thee nor forsake thee, that
[43:24] takes all the oppression away.
[43:28] And the clouds begin to clear back if
[43:30] you just know that God has promised and
[43:31] God is faithful. He can keep his promise
[43:34] or we would have never promised it. Oh
[43:37] my, I won't ask for a raise of hands,
[43:40] but Amen. I'm sure how many of you know
[43:43] what oppression feels like. You know
[43:45] what it feels like to be oppressed. You
[43:48] know what it feels like to have the
[43:50] devil haunting at your mind day in and
[43:52] day out. And then you wake up and for a
[43:55] few minutes you think, "My, I feel
[43:57] pretty good." And then immediately he
[43:59] comes in [clears throat] like a flood
[44:00] and tries to bring that heaviness back
[44:03] and tries to bring that weight back. And
[44:05] in the evening time, amen, you'll be
[44:07] pacing around the house with nervousness
[44:10] because the devil is trying to oppress
[44:12] you with fear or anxiety. Amen. Or
[44:15] depression. And he's trying to hold you
[44:17] back. Amen. Brother Brandon would say
[44:19] there's many people here tonight that
[44:21] really wants to come right here. But the
[44:23] oppression of the devil is trying to
[44:25] hold you back.
[44:27] I mean, I couldn't find the quote, but I
[44:29] believe it's a quote. I could try to
[44:30] find it later, but I believe Brother
[44:32] Brandon was saying, "I would have given
[44:33] my life to Jesus at a young age, but
[44:35] there was a spirit, a hanging trying to
[44:38] keep me from doing it." Amen. the
[44:40] spirit, amen, trying to hold you back
[44:42] and make you think, amen, that I can't
[44:45] go up and give my heart to the Lord. I
[44:47] can't do this. I can't do that. What
[44:49] will my family think of me? What will my
[44:51] friends think of me? Amen. I've tried
[44:53] that before where I've went to the altar
[44:55] many times. I've got prayed for many
[44:57] times. Amen. And it's just not working,
[44:59] Brother Isaac. Amen. But [snorts] it's
[45:00] an oppression. It's a lie of the enemy.
[45:03] It's a cloud that's hanging over you.
[45:05] But it's a liar. Amen. Because God's
[45:08] promises are true. And if you are
[45:10] hungering and thirsting after
[45:12] righteousness, you shall be filled.
[45:15] Amen. You might be one visit to the
[45:17] altar away from the breakthrough you've
[45:19] been looking for. You might be one
[45:21] service away. Amen. During the preaching
[45:23] of the word, the clouds will begin to
[45:25] roll back and you'll have the
[45:27] breakthrough you were looking for. If
[45:28] you just just keep pressing, young
[45:30] people, just keep fighting against that
[45:33] barrier. Eventually the clouds will have
[45:36] to give way because God is true to his
[45:38] word and it's a liar. Amen. And it's a
[45:41] devil. But to [snorts] overcome him,
[45:43] brother Brandon said, "The oppression of
[45:44] the enemy is strong, but thou art
[45:46] stronger, for it is written, greater is
[45:49] he that's in you than he that is in the
[45:52] world." Amen. Friends, there's something
[45:54] you must recognize about oppression.
[45:57] Brother Brand said, "There's a
[45:58] difference between oppression and
[46:00] possession. Possession means that the
[46:03] devil got has you. Possession means that
[46:06] he owns you. He's got you. You are his
[46:09] possession. Amen. But oppression, amen,
[46:12] is just something that hangs over you.
[46:15] But it cannot get you. It cannot possess
[46:17] you. Amen. Because God has already
[46:20] possessed your life from before the
[46:22] foundation of the world. Amen. That's
[46:24] what I want you to recognize tonight.
[46:26] You may be going through some of the
[46:27] darkest times of your life. Amen. But
[46:30] Satan cannot own you because God already
[46:33] put a seal upon you before the
[46:35] foundation of the world. If your name is
[46:37] on the lamb's book of life, he has
[46:39] sealed your womb out that the devil
[46:40] cannot get into your life. The devil
[46:43] could never possess you. Amen. Because
[46:45] you always were. If you're a son
[46:47] tonight, you always were a son and
[46:49] you'll always be a son. Amen. The devil
[46:52] cannot change what God has done in
[46:54] history before the foundation of the
[46:56] world. You say, "One of these days,
[46:58] Brother Isaac, he's going to get me.
[47:00] He's going to trap me." I say, "He could
[47:02] never do it because God has already
[47:04] claimed you for his work." Amen. And
[47:07] even if you don't recognize it yet, if
[47:10] your name is on that lance book of life,
[47:12] amen, you will come to an experience.
[47:14] [laughter] Amen. He will seal your womb
[47:16] because that's what the Holy Ghost is.
[47:18] When God recognizes your faith, he sends
[47:21] back the baptism of the Holy Ghost on
[47:24] your life. And that seal, one of the
[47:26] things Brother Brham said that seal
[47:28] means, it means ownership. And if you
[47:31] are owned by God by the baptism of the
[47:33] Holy Ghost, Amen. then the devil has no
[47:36] power to possess you again, he cannot
[47:39] get you, young people. Amen. I'm I I
[47:42] don't know if you even can believe me at
[47:45] this point if you're going through that.
[47:46] Amen. But may these words stick with you
[47:48] that you might understand it one day
[47:50] that Satan doesn't have enough, Amen. to
[47:53] destroy your life. Satan doesn't have
[47:55] enough power. Amen. He can make you
[47:57] think he does, but he's a liar. He
[47:59] doesn't have enough authority. He can't
[48:01] even touch a hair on your head without
[48:03] God's permission. He can't even He can't
[48:06] even give you a sickness. Let God, lest
[48:09] God would say, "I give you permission.
[48:12] I'll let him go through this trial that
[48:14] he might be tested and come out a better
[48:16] Christian." But you I mean I hope you
[48:18] can understand how much power God has in
[48:21] your life and how little power the Satan
[48:24] has over your life because he's elected
[48:27] you.
[48:28] You might be like that prodigal son and
[48:31] you may not recognize it but one of
[48:33] these days if you're his mean you will
[48:35] have to come to the recognition and wake
[48:38] up to who you are and realize that you
[48:40] are still the son of your father. You
[48:43] are still the son of God. We are under a
[48:46] different cloud. Oppression, brother
[48:47] Brandham said in demonology, oppression
[48:49] is like a cloud. But you know friends,
[48:52] Satan is only a perverter. He only
[48:54] perverts the true things of God. And so
[48:57] if Satan has a cloud over your life,
[49:00] then I believe there must be a true
[49:02] cloud over our life. And I don't I I I
[49:05] don't think it's too deep for you, but
[49:06] there was a picture taken of a cloud. Do
[49:08] you all know what the cloud picture is,
[49:09] right? And when that was our Lord,
[49:12] Brother Bam said, that's a picture of
[49:13] our Lord. He's our headship. He's He's
[49:17] He was His picture was taken in a cloud.
[49:20] And that is the cloud that is over your
[49:22] life. It's the word of God. It's the
[49:25] authority of the message. So, I mean, I
[49:27] I'll say it like this. It's like It's
[49:29] like your mama comes and tells you,
[49:31] "Hey, you have to be in bed by 11:00
[49:33] tonight." And you say, "Yes, ma'am.
[49:35] You're my mother. I won't argue with
[49:37] you." That's what you all say, right?
[49:40] Yeah. First first time. Amen. I I I'm
[49:44] sure none of you have to wait. Amen. I'm
[49:47] sure none of you have to be told a
[49:48] second time to take the trash out
[49:51] because that's your mother. But now, if
[49:53] a stranger comes in the house and says,
[49:55] "Hey, you need to be in bed by 11." You
[49:56] say, "Who are you? You're not my mom.
[50:00] You're not my dad. You have to take the
[50:01] trash out. I'll take the trash out if I
[50:03] want to. You're not my authority." Amen.
[50:06] And Satan tries to put his clouds over
[50:08] your life and try to convince you that
[50:11] that is the truth and authority over
[50:12] your life. But all you do is say,
[50:14] "Satan, I'm under a different cloud. I'm
[50:17] under the authority of this word. And
[50:19] what this word says about me is the
[50:21] truth. And this word says that he which
[50:23] the son is made free is free indeed.
[50:25] This word says that the truth shall set
[50:27] you free." Amen. This word tells me,
[50:30] Amen, [snorts] that I am not under your
[50:32] oppression. I am not under your lies.
[50:34] I'm recognizing tonight that you are
[50:36] just a liar and that your cloud has no
[50:39] power over my identity. Amen. Friends,
[50:42] it's just a cloud. Amen. I'm not trying
[50:44] to belittle what you're going through,
[50:45] but I I want you to recognize that.
[50:48] Amen. It's just a cloud. It has no power
[50:50] over your identity. Amen. But when this
[50:52] message begins to shine upon your life,
[50:55] it rolls the clouds away and clouds of
[50:59] glory and power, clouds of joy and peace
[51:02] will begin to roll over your life. And
[51:04] you'll begin to realize I always was a
[51:06] son of God. Amen. As you begin to
[51:08] awaken, amen, to the reality, amen, that
[51:11] you are a son and daughter of God. That
[51:13] you are, Amen, a child of God. Amen. It
[51:17] It's the clouds of God. Amen. Brother
[51:19] Brandon would say, and I just want to
[51:21] take time to read it real quick because
[51:22] I believe it's powerful. He says that
[51:25] he's talking about John 5:24. For
[51:27] verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[51:29] heareth my word and believeth on him
[51:31] that sent me hath everlasting life, and
[51:33] shall not come into condemnation, but is
[51:35] passed from death unto life. And in a
[51:38] service, brother Brandham's saying, then
[51:40] the black cloud of death has sailed away
[51:42] from over 50 or 75 people. And here
[51:45] tonight, and the clouds of light that
[51:48] has come to them, let us pray. It's
[51:50] saying if you have fulfilled that
[51:52] scripture, the black clouds have begun
[51:55] to roll away from your life and clouds
[51:57] of light and glory have begun to roll
[51:59] back over you. Amen. Friends, that's
[52:02] what's taking place in the service
[52:03] tonight. When your pastor preaches, as
[52:05] the word goes forth, black clouds are
[52:08] leaving and clouds of light are coming
[52:11] into the building and settling over your
[52:13] life. Amen. Brother Brandham said there
[52:14] was a sister one time who had a dream
[52:17] that she was walking in white sands and
[52:20] there was darkness over her life. And
[52:22] she said, "Brother Brandon, I'm just so
[52:24] nervous since I had this dream. My whole
[52:25] family is nervous. I mean, what's going
[52:28] to happen?" And he would say, "Sister,
[52:30] it's just the devil trying to make you
[52:32] nervous. The white sands prove that you
[52:34] are walking in purity and righteousness.
[52:37] There's nothing wrong. It's just a
[52:39] nervous spirit." Amen. Because the
[52:41] blackness might be over you, but it
[52:43] doesn't identify who you are. You're
[52:46] walking in white sands. You're walking
[52:48] in purity and righteousness. It's just a
[52:50] devil trying to lie to you. You say,
[52:53] "Brother Isaac, the clouds of judgment
[52:55] are forming all around us. I'm scared of
[52:57] what the future's going to hold." But
[52:59] you, if you are a son or daughter of
[53:01] God, amen, those clouds are not over
[53:03] your life. But there's another promise.
[53:05] Amen. That we're going to go in a
[53:07] rapture. that we're going to escape
[53:09] before those clouds ever pour down their
[53:11] storms. Brother, we're under another
[53:13] cloud. You are not children of the
[53:15] darkness. You are children of the light.
[53:18] You are children of the promise. Ye are
[53:20] children of the promise. Amen. That God
[53:22] will take us away and [clears throat]
[53:24] give us an escape from every judgment
[53:26] that the devil will pour out upon this
[53:29] earth. Amen. I Amen. I I feel like Amen.
[53:33] This this evening I feel like brother
[53:34] Brandham said that there was a bird
[53:36] called a night and gale and and he would
[53:39] stand there in that early morning and
[53:41] the clouds of the night would be hanging
[53:43] over but at the first break in the
[53:46] clouds that night and gale would begin
[53:47] to scream out his song and it would let
[53:50] the whole amen earth know that could
[53:52] hear that voice amen that the sun is
[53:55] still shining that there's still light
[53:57] behind the clouds and and I'll volunteer
[54:00] to be that night and gale tonight and
[54:02] Say, I mean, you may not see it yet, but
[54:04] I see that the sun is shining through
[54:06] the clouds. I'm a witness. I say I've
[54:09] come through some clouds, and I'll
[54:11] probably come through some more clouds,
[54:12] but I'm here to tell you tonight, the
[54:14] sun is shining through the clouds. And
[54:16] brother Brandon said, "Faith sees the
[54:18] sun behind the clouds." You say, "I
[54:20] don't see it yet, Brother Isaac." Amen.
[54:22] But I'm here to tell you, a prophet has
[54:25] told us, your pastor can tell you. Amen.
[54:28] Just hold on. The sun is shining behind
[54:30] the clouds. Amen. Just hold on. and the
[54:32] the clouds will begin to break away and
[54:34] you'll realize, amen, that you are free
[54:36] to be a son and daughter of God. You are
[54:39] free to have joy. You are free to have
[54:41] peace. You are free to walk in his
[54:45] presence. You say, "Brother Isaac, you
[54:46] don't know about me. I've been this way
[54:48] my whole life. You don't know my story.
[54:51] This has been since I was a child."
[54:53] Well, Brother Brandham could pick it up
[54:54] in prayer lines and say, "When you were
[54:57] little, you were scared by a dog and it
[55:01] caused you to be nervous and you've been
[55:02] nervous your whole life." And you say,
[55:05] "I've been this way my whole life." No,
[55:07] it had a beginning. It had a beginning.
[55:10] If you may not know where it started,
[55:12] but it had a beginning. It is not who
[55:14] you are. It had a beginning and it can
[55:17] have an end because it's it's a spirit
[55:19] but it's only I mean it doesn't have
[55:22] more power than the God that we serve.
[55:24] Amen. And it can have an end. Amen. As
[55:27] the truth begins to come over your life
[55:28] and say all right this is what I'm
[55:30] dealing with but it's not who I am. And
[55:33] God greater is he that's in me than he
[55:35] that's in the world.
[55:37] Now that's oppression. But you say
[55:39] brother Isaac you don't know my life.
[55:42] You don't know what I've been through. I
[55:43] have been possessed. I have been
[55:45] possessed. How could I ever make a
[55:47] rapture? How could I ever be the bride?
[55:49] Satan, he's had so much control in my
[55:51] life. What about Mary Magdalene who had
[55:55] seven devils, but she met Jesus? And
[55:58] Jesus come and met her and she was full
[56:01] of seven devils. It was pride and envy
[56:03] and lust and all kinds of devils. But
[56:05] when she met a living God, he would
[56:07] speak unto her, "Be thou clean." And she
[56:10] was made clean by the voice of Jesus
[56:13] that would speak over her life. I don't
[56:15] care what you've gone through. I don't
[56:17] care how dark you are, but be thou
[56:19] clean. See, I feel so dirty tonight,
[56:22] Brother Isaac. I've done things I
[56:23] shouldn't have done. I've made so many
[56:25] mistakes. I can't even I can't even tell
[56:27] my pastor the things that I've done.
[56:29] It's too bad. Amen. But the voice of God
[56:32] can begin to speak over your life. Be
[56:34] thou clean. You don't have to feel dirty
[56:36] any longer. You don't have to feel like
[56:38] a wretch any longer. You don't have to
[56:40] feel like a sinner any longer. And when
[56:43] there is a man in the building who can
[56:45] still speak those words over your life,
[56:47] be thou clean. Oh my, look what happened
[56:50] to Mary Magdalene. She went from seven
[56:53] devils to being the very first person to
[56:56] witness Jesus Christ after he rose from
[56:58] the grave. And then she went to an upper
[57:01] room and received the Holy Ghost.
[57:04] Brother Brandon would tell us how she
[57:05] was up there in that room. Amen. So, she
[57:08] went from possessed to a witness of his
[57:10] resurrection to a Holy Ghost-filled
[57:12] daughter of God. And you say, "It's too
[57:14] dark, Brother Isaac. It's too hopeless."
[57:17] I say, "We serve a God who can take a
[57:19] hopeless situation and take you out the
[57:21] muck of your sin and place you in a
[57:23] place of authority and reveal to you
[57:26] that you were never the devil's. You
[57:28] never belong to the devil. You were
[57:30] always mine. And I'm here to make you
[57:32] clean."
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh, I mean, that's that's a
[57:36] that's a lady. What about [laughter] an
[57:38] an example of a man? There was a man
[57:40] named Legion one time and the Bible said
[57:43] in the book of Mark that when he was
[57:45] come out of the ship, immediately there
[57:47] met him out of the tombs a man with an
[57:49] unclean spirit.
[57:52] You say it was an unclean man, brother
[57:54] Isaac. That's not what the scripture
[57:55] said. It said it was a man with an
[57:57] unclean spirit. You got to separate your
[58:00] battle from your identity, friends. You
[58:02] are not depressed. You are not anxious.
[58:05] You're speaking the devil's language.
[58:07] Amen. You are a man that's battling
[58:09] depression. You are a daughter that's
[58:11] battling anxiety. You are a man that is
[58:13] battling temptation. But it is not your
[58:16] identity. It's just an unclean spirit
[58:18] that's trying to hold you back from who
[58:20] you really are. Amen. But he began to
[58:22] fellowship with the Lord. Amen. And the
[58:24] Lord made way to come by him where he
[58:26] was dwelling among tombs, bound with
[58:29] chains, and cutting himself with stones.
[58:32] Amen. Spirits don't die, friends.
[58:35] Amen. That spirit still alive in the
[58:37] form of a depression and suicide tried
[58:40] to make you cut yourself like Legion was
[58:43] cutting himself.
[58:45] Amen. But when Jesus came, that man ran
[58:47] up to him and those spirits begin to
[58:49] fall down and recognize that that was
[58:51] Jesus and they begin to worship him
[58:53] because the enemy knows who Jesus is.
[58:57] The devil knows this message is. He
[59:00] knows it's true. maybe more than a lot
[59:02] of the the a lot of churches in this
[59:04] world. He knows it's true. And he begin
[59:06] to fall down and worship. Amen. And
[59:09] Jesus would begin to speak to him and
[59:11] say, "What is thy name?" He would say,
[59:12] "My name is Legion."
[59:15] He said, Jesus knew his name, but he
[59:16] wanted them to confess it. He said, "How
[59:19] did it begin?" He had taken a little
[59:21] drink and a spirit came in. He told a
[59:24] little lie and a a spirit came in and
[59:26] before he knew it, he was possessed by a
[59:28] legion of devils. And and then brother
[59:31] Ram say the law couldn't help them. And
[59:34] sometimes that's where we get friends is
[59:36] that just rules and regulations can't
[59:38] help us.
[59:40] It'll require more than that. That's not
[59:42] what we need sometimes. We you know we
[59:44] we need those things. We need things to
[59:46] be in order, but it's got to be more
[59:48] than that. He needed to meet a living
[59:50] God. And the law couldn't help him. And
[59:53] he wanted a revival. He was the only
[59:56] person in that whole land that wanted a
[59:58] revival because brother will there was a
[59:59] lot of farmers that didn't want a
[1:00:01] revival because when revival came to
[1:00:03] Legion he said cast the spirits cast us
[1:00:06] into these hogs and they ran into the
[1:00:09] water and they said we don't want
[1:00:11] revival it cost too many hogs but Legion
[1:00:13] wanted revival
[1:00:15] and that may be you tonight you may be
[1:00:16] in that shape say I want revival brother
[1:00:18] Isaac I'm hungry for God brother Isaac
[1:00:21] and Jesus gave those spirits leave and
[1:00:23] he went home a different man. He went
[1:00:26] home and his children begin to begin to
[1:00:28] hide and his wife begin to hunker down
[1:00:31] and say, "Who are you? Why why are you
[1:00:33] back here? I thought what what are you
[1:00:35] doing in this house?" And they begin to
[1:00:36] fear him that he was going to beat them
[1:00:39] again and he was going to hurt them
[1:00:40] again. Amen. And they begin to say,
[1:00:42] "What? Mommy, what's happening?" And
[1:00:45] say, "Don't fear. Don't fear my wife.
[1:00:48] Don't fear my children. Daddy met
[1:00:50] Jesus." Amen. And you say, "It's
[1:00:52] hopeless, Brother Isaac." No,
[1:00:55] brother Bram said when you recognize his
[1:00:58] presence, everything is settled.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, when you recognize his presence,
[1:01:03] he's here to release your desires onto
[1:01:06] you. I mean, as the musicians come, I
[1:01:10] mean, I I've got a lot more, but I ran
[1:01:11] out of time.
[1:01:13] But there was a man one time named
[1:01:15] Donnie Morton,
[1:01:17] and he had a little boy. He's about four
[1:01:19] years old
[1:01:21] and he had a hopeless brain condition
[1:01:23] and the doctors begin to diagnose him
[1:01:26] and say he's hopeless. He he might live
[1:01:28] six months. But his daddy believed so
[1:01:33] much and loved his son so much that he
[1:01:36] said, "No, we we've got to go. We've got
[1:01:37] to find a doctor. We've got to do
[1:01:39] something." And they would go through
[1:01:40] blizzards. They would go through all
[1:01:42] kinds of storms just to take him to
[1:01:44] doctors and they would say, "He's
[1:01:45] hopeless. you know, there's really
[1:01:47] nothing we can do. And he began to lose
[1:01:50] weight, and he couldn't hardly eat or
[1:01:52] speak or anything.
[1:01:54] And finally, one day, his father
[1:01:56] remembered that there was a man named
[1:01:58] William Brandham. And he had had two
[1:02:00] friends that were healed in his
[1:02:02] meetings. And he would say, he would
[1:02:06] say, "If we can just get to those
[1:02:07] meetings, I believe God will do
[1:02:08] something for my baby."
[1:02:11] And and he went and he sold cows and did
[1:02:14] everything he could to get to that
[1:02:15] meeting. And and this is in the Reader's
[1:02:18] Digest. Brother Bram tells a story from
[1:02:19] years ago. He said, 'There's one thing.
[1:02:21] They [music] wouldn't accept the word
[1:02:22] hopeless.
[1:02:24] They would say, "Buddy,
[1:02:26] daddy's here. Buddy, [music] we're not
[1:02:28] whipped yet. Little Donnie, there's
[1:02:31] still hope. Don't give up hope." And
[1:02:33] they traveled 2, 3,000 miles and finally
[1:02:37] made it to that meeting. And brother
[1:02:38] Brandham would say,
[1:02:41] "If you can just go down a couple days
[1:02:43] from now or tomorrow," he said, "you'll
[1:02:46] find an Old Country doctor." [music] And
[1:02:48] the only hope he has is the power of God
[1:02:51] in that surgery. And long story short,
[1:02:53] they met that doctor. They performed
[1:02:55] [music] the operation and the baby begin
[1:02:57] to get well. Amen. Because there was a
[1:03:00] father who wouldn't accept the word
[1:03:01] hopeless.
[1:03:03] Amen. And I'm one preacher [music] that
[1:03:05] won't accept the word hopeless. You've
[1:03:08] got a pastor that won't accept the word
[1:03:09] hopeless. Amen. Whatever condition
[1:03:12] you're in tonight, we will not accept
[1:03:13] the word hopeless. You [music] say,
[1:03:15] "It's too late, Brother Isaac. I'm too
[1:03:17] far too far gone." I like the lyrics of
[1:03:20] that song. I don't know who told you you
[1:03:22] would not make it. I don't know who told
[1:03:24] you you could not take it. I don't know
[1:03:27] who told you it's time that you quit,
[1:03:29] but my God says, "Wait, it ain't over
[1:03:31] yet." You say, "It's too late, Brother
[1:03:33] Isaac." I say, "Wait, it ain't over
[1:03:34] yet." As long as he's here, there's
[1:03:37] hope. As long as his presence is in the
[1:03:40] building and you recognize that he is
[1:03:42] here and you if you recognize [music]
[1:03:44] tonight that it's more than brother
[1:03:45] Isaac. If you recognize that it's more
[1:03:48] than brother Aaron. If you recognize
[1:03:49] that the angel of the Lord is in the
[1:03:51] building tonight, you can have the
[1:03:53] desire of your heart because that's what
[1:03:54] brother Brandham said he's here to do.
[1:03:56] That's why he appears in these meetings.
[1:03:58] He appears to give you the desires of
[1:04:01] your heart. But you got to recognize
[1:04:03] him. [music]
[1:04:04] But if you recognize him tonight, like
[1:04:06] the woman at the well recognized him,
[1:04:09] she received her deliverance. The woman
[1:04:12] in the blood issue had a need of
[1:04:13] healing, but she recognized him and
[1:04:16] [music] touched the hem of his garment
[1:04:17] and she received her healing. The woman
[1:04:20] that washed his feet with her hair
[1:04:23] recognized that he was the Christ and
[1:04:25] she received forgiveness and she
[1:04:28] received her joy.
[1:04:30] And so whatever your desire is tonight,
[1:04:32] if you desire the Holy Ghost, if you
[1:04:35] desire your joy, if you desire your
[1:04:37] peace, and you recognize [music] that
[1:04:39] he's in the building tonight, then I say
[1:04:41] he's here to release your desires onto
[1:04:43] you. Amen. If we could bow our heads as
[1:04:47] we begin to close the service.
[1:04:51] Amen. Brother Brandon would say,
[1:04:55] and this just struck my heart when I
[1:04:56] read it.
[1:04:58] He would say that's the reason you enjoy
[1:05:00] it. You Baptist, [music] Methodist, and
[1:05:02] Catholic and Presbyterian and so forth.
[1:05:04] You enjoy that presence. Somewhere in
[1:05:05] you, you've accepted God. Maybe sometime
[1:05:08] in an intellectual way, you come and you
[1:05:10] felt the [music] power of God and you
[1:05:12] are a servant of God. But when you can
[1:05:14] really come into God and recognize
[1:05:17] [music] your place in him as a son or
[1:05:19] daughter of God, that's what brings that
[1:05:21] great thrill to you that God intended
[1:05:24] you to have.
[1:05:26] Amen. And if you don't have that thrill
[1:05:28] tonight, I believe that he's here. He
[1:05:30] can give you that thrill.
[1:05:32] You can begin to recognize who you are.
[1:05:34] Like brother Brandham told about that
[1:05:36] boy who [music] was playing in the
[1:05:38] house. He was walking around and he
[1:05:40] found a little mirror
[1:05:42] and he began [music] to look at that
[1:05:43] mirror and say, "My, that's funny
[1:05:45] looking." And he began to recognize,
[1:05:47] "Wow, that's me in that mirror." And he
[1:05:49] said, "Mama, that's me."
[1:05:52] You said, "I've been [music] hearing
[1:05:54] this message for a long time, and I've
[1:05:56] I've not recognized it yet, Brother
[1:05:57] Isaac. But maybe if that boy hadn't
[1:06:00] taken a bath for a week or a month, he
[1:06:03] could go in front of that mirror and
[1:06:05] say, "I don't know who that is. It's too
[1:06:08] dirty. I can't tell."
[1:06:11] Oh, but there is a washing of the water
[1:06:13] of the word tonight that begin to wash
[1:06:15] away everything because that dirt wasn't
[1:06:17] the real him. [music] Amen. He maybe
[1:06:20] couldn't recognize who he was because he
[1:06:21] was covered with dirt. But the dirt
[1:06:23] wasn't him. But as the dirt began to get
[1:06:25] washed away, he could see, "Wow, this is
[1:06:27] what I look [music] like. This is who I
[1:06:30] am." And maybe you feel dirty tonight,
[1:06:32] but as a word begins to wash [music]
[1:06:34] away that dirt, you can look into the
[1:06:35] mirror of God's word and say, "Oh,
[1:06:38] that's who I am. That's who I've been
[1:06:41] all along.
[1:06:43] That's what God's been trying to tell
[1:06:44] me. That's what the pastor's been
[1:06:45] preaching about. I can't believe I never
[1:06:47] saw it."
[1:06:49] Oh, but you begin to see it and brother,
[1:06:51] it'll bring a thrill to your life.
[1:06:54] Amen. If you desire, maybe if you've got
[1:06:57] a need on your heart, you'd like to
[1:06:58] raise your hand. You say, "Brother
[1:06:59] Isaac, I I want to recognize who I am. I
[1:07:02] I don't know if I even have the Holy
[1:07:04] Ghost or not. I want to know tonight. I
[1:07:07] need my joy, Brother Isaac. I'm under a
[1:07:09] cloud of oppression. I just can't seem
[1:07:10] to break through it. I need to break
[1:07:12] through tonight."
[1:07:14] Oh, we serve a God, friends.
[1:07:17] Amen. and we're going to pray. If you
[1:07:19] desire to come up for prayer or kneel at
[1:07:21] the altar, we'd be happy to pray with
[1:07:22] you. But we're going to pray together
[1:07:25] now.
[1:07:27] Just lift it up before the Lord.
[1:07:29] Recognize who's here in the building.
[1:07:31] Heavenly Father, your grace is
[1:07:33] sufficient, [music] Lord, in the time of
[1:07:35] need. Father, I Lord, a lot of things
[1:07:38] that maybe I didn't get to, but I
[1:07:40] [music] believe that you, Lord, I trust
[1:07:42] that you accomplished what you needed to
[1:07:44] speak tonight. Father,
[1:07:47] Lord, I'm here. I I stand as that night
[1:07:49] and gale tonight. Father, I trying to
[1:07:51] announce to these young people the best
[1:07:53] [music] I can, Lord, that if you're in a
[1:07:56] cloud that I'm here to tell you, the
[1:07:58] sun's shining behind the clouds. You can
[1:08:01] have a breakthrough tonight. You can
[1:08:03] have a breakthrough. You can press
[1:08:04] through those clouds. [music]
[1:08:07] And some of it might be instantly.
[1:08:10] Some of it might just be a moment in his
[1:08:12] presence rolls the clouds away. And some
[1:08:15] of it might just be walking [music] with
[1:08:16] the Lord, fellowshipping with the
[1:08:18] message. And just day after day, you
[1:08:20] realize it's getting brighter and
[1:08:23] brighter.
[1:08:25] Oh Jesus, we ask that you be merciful
[1:08:27] tonight. Lord, you said, Lord, that if
[1:08:30] we [music] would repent and be baptized,
[1:08:32] we shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:33] But Father, maybe there's some tonight
[1:08:35] that are lost in that confusion.
[1:08:38] Lord, I'll pray over them like I prayed.
[1:08:40] Father, if they don't have it, Lord, I
[1:08:42] pray you give it to them and let them
[1:08:45] know that they, [music] Lord, that
[1:08:46] they've got it. But if they do have it,
[1:08:48] Lord, I pray you just settle it in their
[1:08:49] heart that they might know, Father, that
[1:08:51] they wouldn't have to live in that
[1:08:52] confusion any longer. Lord, if they're
[1:08:55] walking in depression, if they're
[1:08:56] walking in anxiety, if there's a cloud
[1:08:58] hanging over their life and they're
[1:09:00] thinking it's so dark and this, it's so
[1:09:02] dark, Lord. Maybe when they go to bed at
[1:09:04] night, Father, they just sit there and
[1:09:06] weep and say, "Oh, God, I need you,
[1:09:09] Lord. I need a breakthrough. I'm I can't
[1:09:11] hardly take another day of this. Amen.
[1:09:14] Father, you're here. Lord, you're here.
[1:09:16] Your sunshine is here. Father, you can
[1:09:18] give them the joy. You can give them the
[1:09:20] peace, Lord. Father, maybe they'll be
[1:09:23] going throughout the week this week and
[1:09:25] they'll turn on a tape and all of a
[1:09:26] sudden it will begin to answer exactly
[1:09:28] what they're going through. Lord, maybe
[1:09:30] the pastor will come and preach next
[1:09:32] week and it'll be exactly what they have
[1:09:34] need of to identify what they're going
[1:09:36] through. Father, we don't want to put
[1:09:37] you in a box and say, "Lord, how you
[1:09:39] have to do it." But Father, we're just
[1:09:41] asking that you give us mercy tonight.
[1:09:44] We're asking that you restore joy to the
[1:09:46] hearts hungering for joy. Lord, if
[1:09:48] they're hungering for a revival in their
[1:09:50] life, Lord, I [music] pray you just
[1:09:51] begin to open the floodgates of heaven
[1:09:53] upon their life and pour out a revival.
[1:09:56] Lord, if they're needing peace, Lord,
[1:09:58] you have promised us a peace that passes
[1:10:00] all understanding.
[1:10:02] Lord, if they're needing the Holy Ghost
[1:10:03] or a refilling, Lord, you are here
[1:10:06] tonight. Lord, we ask that you be
[1:10:09] merciful now in Jesus name.
[1:10:12] Oh, why don't we just worship him?
