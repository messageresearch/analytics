[0:00] and my title today is phobia
[0:03] and it this hopefully is a little bit of
[0:06] a tension grabbing and I already know
[0:07] that I've provoked some phobias already
[0:09] just by the title slide
[0:12] but that's my title today is phobia
[0:15] and in First Corinthians chapter six I
[0:17] want to just jump into this and I want
[0:18] to look at this again Paul says uh
[0:21] speaking of fornication and that when we
[0:24] fornicate there is a impact uh that it's
[0:27] not just something that offends the body
[0:28] there's more there's a deeper impact
[0:30] when a man does this but he says he's
[0:32] also sinning against his own body so
[0:34] those two things come together and then
[0:37] he gives a little what and then he says
[0:39] you know don't you know that your body
[0:40] is the temp of the Holy Ghost so your
[0:42] body is a temple it's a residing place
[0:44] that the Holy Ghost and then he says
[0:46] which is from God and then he makes the
[0:48] statement you are not your own so he's
[0:50] implying there's some other ownership
[0:51] that you are subject to something else a
[0:53] higher power and then he refers to the
[0:55] price of redemption and he says
[0:57] therefore glorify God in your body and
[1:00] in your spirit which are gods
[1:02] now we could start here and go down a
[1:05] particular line of teaching that could
[1:07] enforce a lot of different scriptural
[1:08] principles a lot of things that we hold
[1:10] very dear as Believers but we realize
[1:12] that this is the basis in the scripture
[1:15] for avoiding certain vices or substances
[1:18] we avoid drugs we avoid drinking we
[1:20] avoid gluttony amen there's a lot of
[1:22] things we avoid because we realize that
[1:23] even though those things may uh
[1:26] influence and stimulate the body or be
[1:28] something the body processes this body
[1:30] is not our own but it belongs to God it
[1:33] has something to to really think about
[1:35] in terms of your person being Soul
[1:38] spirit and body that if that's you as a
[1:40] person but yet you belong to God so Body
[1:42] Spirit and soul still are the Lords and
[1:45] he says you're the Temple of the Holy
[1:46] Ghost so he's already taken care of that
[1:48] Soul part God has taken possession of
[1:51] that and the soul is now converted or
[1:53] born Anew or regenerated it's
[1:55] permanently sealed and so that's within
[1:58] the person but now he's addressing your
[2:01] spirit in your body and he says glorify
[2:02] by God with it because they are gods
[2:05] they belong to God
[2:07] and as we've been speaking on Divine
[2:09] Healing and this is the part that I just
[2:12] want to touch on in the outset and then
[2:14] maybe we'll get deeper into
[2:16] in a later service this is a Biblical
[2:19] directive to take care of your body and
[2:21] your spirit
[2:22] and it's something that we could point
[2:24] to to the scripture to say that my body
[2:26] is a temple of the Holy Ghost and and my
[2:30] spirit belongs to God therefore I ought
[2:33] to give some thought as to how I treat
[2:35] it and how I care for it and so there is
[2:38] a scriptural principle here that we are
[2:40] under a command to take care of our body
[2:43] and spirit now that in itself is a very
[2:45] large thought that can inspire a lot of
[2:47] different fellowship and principles and
[2:50] if I could say this a desire to be well
[2:52] is good
[2:54] desire to be healthy you I'm glad I got
[2:56] some some delayed amens I don't know if
[2:58] we're on a little bit of a delay here
[2:59] but maybe some of you were planning on
[3:01] binging this week on you know boasts of
[3:04] donuts and you're thinking oh bad timing
[3:06] but a desire to be healthy is a good
[3:09] desire it's not an inordinate affection
[3:11] a desire to be physically healthy a
[3:12] desire to be mentally well to give some
[3:15] thought and to take care of your person
[3:17] in terms of uh your overall health and
[3:19] happiness those things would not be and
[3:22] themselves a bad desire but the body is
[3:26] not the god
[3:27] the spirit is not the God so it's not
[3:29] that I I I'm serving this Temple I'm
[3:32] serving the spirit and that the body and
[3:34] spirit that my over uh my my main
[3:37] principle in life is my well-being and
[3:39] my wholeness and there's a lot of things
[3:41] we could point back to that we've
[3:42] ministered on to where that whole idea
[3:45] of Being Fit and being healthy and being
[3:47] at your best and maybe getting a little
[3:48] bit of a chisel and I've been in the
[3:51] bulking up phase for 47 years
[3:53] and um there's a lot of things that we
[3:55] might focus on I've never quit stomach
[3:58] day if that's such a thing
[3:59] but if there's things that we could
[4:02] focus on and got to be very careful
[4:03] being healthy and being happy is is
[4:05] important but it's not the God because
[4:08] your body and spirit belong to God and
[4:10] your body and spirit must be consecrated
[4:12] to him now I want to amplify this more
[4:14] and I say that because I took several
[4:16] scriptures and principles out of my
[4:17] notes just uh cut and pasted in another
[4:20] document to come to it another time
[4:23] and so there's more that we could do on
[4:24] that but to that point I want to say
[4:26] this our Pursuit
[4:28] is our goal is not Health our goal is
[4:31] not happiness
[4:32] that that's not our goal so that our
[4:34] entire lives now think very uh deeply
[4:37] about this our entire life is not I just
[4:39] want to do whatever I can to be healthy
[4:40] and I want to do whatever I can to be
[4:42] happy uh those are not our goals but
[4:45] they are promised to the believer
[4:48] so if they're promised to the believer
[4:49] there's a God there's a provided way for
[4:52] God to bring health and happiness to a
[4:54] health and happiness to us and so if I
[4:57] could say this and maybe I'm taking a
[4:58] little bit of a leap here because I want
[5:00] to move on
[5:01] that if if the body and spirit are the
[5:05] Lord's
[5:06] and and he has promised us health and
[5:10] happiness a healthy body and a sound
[5:12] mind then God has a way to provide that
[5:15] to us and his way would be by the word
[5:17] through faith
[5:19] that the same way our soul has been
[5:20] sealed that would be his way of doing it
[5:22] and that so then Faith must be at the
[5:26] center or a driving factor to that
[5:28] Pursuit so if you want to be healthy
[5:30] there's nothing wrong with that if you
[5:32] want to be healthy nothing wrong with
[5:33] that but there's this there's this
[5:35] danger line that if the if the slightest
[5:39] imbalance will then cause us to be
[5:42] driven by the wrong ambition
[5:44] and we're going to be kind of addressing
[5:46] that today just and I say the slightest
[5:49] imbalance that if you're wanting um to
[5:51] look good for a particular occasion or
[5:54] you're wanting to do something for a
[5:55] certain reason uh even in a competitive
[5:58] sense just the slightest imbalance
[6:00] caused you to be driven by the wrong
[6:02] ambition and you're stepping away more
[6:04] from God's promise that you should be
[6:06] healthy and God's promise that you'll be
[6:08] happy and you're getting more into the
[6:10] vanity and the pride of of taking care
[6:13] of this body and wanting it to look good
[6:15] and wanting to be you know you take care
[6:18] of your well-being so I think that's
[6:19] that's maybe enough on that that there's
[6:21] a there's a way that you can just get
[6:23] left of Sinner and where faith is no
[6:25] longer behind all your Pursuits
[6:28] so now to our title today phobia
[6:31] and when
[6:33] you'll you'll catch how this ties into
[6:35] where we've been speaking on lately on
[6:37] this subject I want to address the
[6:40] internal conflicts that we have as
[6:42] Believers when we're pursuing our
[6:45] well-being
[6:46] whether it be a cure for sickness or a
[6:48] remedy for some ailment or healing of
[6:50] some disease there's some Eternal
[6:52] conflicts that we might not even be
[6:54] conscious of so we're going to be
[6:55] uncovering some things today that we go
[6:58] through in our spirits and if I could
[7:00] use this by way of analogy we talked
[7:03] before about forgiveness and how that
[7:05] sin could be a cause of sickness so if
[7:08] you're sick and you want to be healed
[7:09] you have to say I'm sorry
[7:11] to address the sickness the underlying
[7:13] sin that's caused the sickness or you
[7:16] could have some resentment or bitterness
[7:17] or unforgiveness in your heart and so
[7:19] you may need to say I forgive in order
[7:22] to be healed so that's those are those
[7:24] are conditions of the Mind state of
[7:26] Minds the right mental attitude that's
[7:28] keeping you from receiving a promise now
[7:31] we said this at the very beginning that
[7:32] we're using the example of Divine
[7:35] Healing as a template for how we can
[7:37] approach any promise of God and so it's
[7:40] not just limited to our physical healing
[7:42] there's a lot of things that you could
[7:43] take into consideration today on this
[7:45] subject and so as as we look at this
[7:48] phobia we're looking at things that
[7:50] hinder us from being healed or cause us
[7:52] to be sick still
[7:53] and again if you're waiting for me to
[7:56] start on the subject of Divine Healing
[7:57] we're in it
[7:59] now
[8:00] this is I'm kind of seeding this for the
[8:03] future there's a
[8:04] vast number of approaches to Healing the
[8:06] mind and the body a lot of different
[8:07] disciplines a lot of different ideas
[8:09] a lot of different um opinions and I
[8:12] would say there's different scriptural
[8:14] principles that relate to these things
[8:15] but there's a lot of maybe you could all
[8:18] agree with this maybe if you're getting
[8:19] nervous relax there's a lot of different
[8:21] controversial beliefs when it comes to
[8:22] Medicine
[8:24] comes to the Health Care system and
[8:26] things and there are some very strong
[8:28] doctrines within uh nominal Christianity
[8:31] or within yeah just say within
[8:34] Christianity that believe it is a sin
[8:37] for a Christian to go to a doctor or
[8:40] seek medical help
[8:41] anybody ever heard of this before and
[8:44] when I say sin they they they they
[8:46] equate it with adultery
[8:49] that if it would be a sin for you to uh
[8:52] commit fornication if you would be a sin
[8:54] to commit adultery against your body and
[8:55] against your spouse the same against God
[8:58] if you go to see a doctor or seek
[9:00] medical help
[9:01] and and that's a very strong Doctrine
[9:03] and some of you may have family members
[9:05] that believe that way or it may not be
[9:07] that strong but you recognize there's
[9:09] kind of these undercurrents of this
[9:11] really strong conviction and opinion
[9:13] about doctors and about seeking medical
[9:15] help or getting intervention for
[9:17] ailments or diseases and sometimes
[9:19] life-threatening situations and that's
[9:21] maybe some Christians but then on the
[9:23] other side you have some Christians that
[9:25] practice healing rituals which are
[9:28] associated with the cultic religions and
[9:30] they're they practice them as a
[9:32] discipline they practice it as a belief
[9:33] system they adopt it as a way of
[9:35] approaching certain ailments and if
[9:37] you're like can you give us some names I
[9:38] won't know
[9:39] and I may never because I don't want to
[9:41] uh
[9:43] I want to be very careful because today
[9:44] I'm trying to bring a balance and not
[9:46] throw the you know the spears like oh
[9:48] today we're going to chunk Spears at
[9:49] those people who don't believe in
[9:50] doctors and then oh no no we're going to
[9:52] attack those people who you know believe
[9:54] in uh bloodletting
[9:56] uh but no we're not we're not throwing
[9:58] stones we're not trying to pick on
[10:00] anybody we're wanting to have a balance
[10:01] in the word of God
[10:03] and if I could bring this back to what I
[10:05] said in the beginning faith has to be
[10:06] the at the core of whatever approach we
[10:09] take to Healing Faith should be at the
[10:11] core of whatever approach we take uh to
[10:13] treatments and remedies and and however
[10:16] is it we would choose that God would
[10:17] address a particular situation or that
[10:19] we would receive our healing or be
[10:20] better off physically and mentally Faith
[10:23] should be at the core of that
[10:24] uh and and I think it's a caution
[10:26] sometimes to our attitudes whether it be
[10:28] to medicine or attitude towards
[10:30] alternative remedies there's a way that
[10:32] we got to keep Christ at the center of
[10:34] all of it and exercise our discernment
[10:35] and use our faith when we're pursuing
[10:37] our Wellness
[10:39] and
[10:40] I'll say this and this gets us to phobia
[10:43] far too often the culprit behind our
[10:46] efforts to
[10:49] be healed or be cured or some remedy or
[10:51] even our restraint in not seeking
[10:54] certain remedies or not going to the
[10:55] doctor not going to hospital is fear not
[10:57] faith
[10:59] that the reason why someone is doing
[11:01] something is not because they believe
[11:04] that it'll work or not because it's
[11:05] faith alone that's guiding them or they
[11:07] they're kind of centered they're well
[11:08] balanced they're operating uh with
[11:10] within um a sound mind and and not
[11:13] Afflicted and not distressed a lot of
[11:15] times what does it is desperation in the
[11:17] bad sense and they're doing it because
[11:19] they're they're fearful of this or they
[11:20] don't want to do this because they're
[11:21] afraid of that and what happens is
[11:23] there's a lot of things that we could do
[11:24] and it's not Faith that's motivating us
[11:26] to do it it's fear
[11:28] and there's a that that principle is
[11:30] very very large and if I could say this
[11:33] as I continue today and I appreciate
[11:35] your attentiveness as we go forward I
[11:37] really believe that there's the devil is
[11:39] going to be exposed by the word of God
[11:42] today
[11:43] and maybe not in a way that's new to you
[11:45] but it's exposing the tactics of the
[11:47] enemy because fear is his Factor Fear is
[11:50] what he uses in Matthew chapter 10 verse
[11:53] 28 Jesus says fear not them which kill
[11:55] the body but are not able to kill the
[11:57] soul but rather fear him which is able
[11:59] to destroy both soul and body and Hell
[12:02] maybe a little bit of a paradox in that
[12:04] we our fear and our reverence our trust
[12:06] is to God when it comes to uh to any
[12:10] fear that it's God Alone that we would
[12:12] reverence it's God Alone that we would
[12:13] be submitted to it's God Alone that we
[12:16] trust but when it comes to your body and
[12:18] it comes to your spirit they belong to
[12:20] God therefore if there's any trust if
[12:23] there's any giving into if there's any
[12:25] submission it ought to be God and God
[12:27] Alone
[12:28] and so if I could put this in a way that
[12:30] uh it maybe deserves a little bit more
[12:32] amplifying our fears to God when it
[12:35] comes to our well-being fears to God
[12:37] when it comes to the condition of our
[12:38] soul our fears to God when it comes to
[12:40] the condition of our spirit our fear is
[12:41] to God when it comes to the wholeness of
[12:43] our person and the physical uh healing
[12:46] of our bodies Our fear ought to be to
[12:47] God and so he says fear not them which
[12:50] kill the body
[12:52] he's focusing uh he's addressing fear
[12:56] and he's addressing the fear of man I'm
[12:59] saying you shouldn't fear man you can't
[13:01] you shouldn't fear what man can do you
[13:02] shouldn't fear what man cannot do Don't
[13:04] Fear the man that has power to kill the
[13:06] body but fear God so he's addressing by
[13:09] him addressing the fear of man he's
[13:11] focusing our faith properly on God don't
[13:14] fear a man that can destroy the body
[13:17] fear God that created the body
[13:20] don't fear man that you know that can do
[13:22] do these things and don't fear man that
[13:24] can say this or do this and uh there
[13:27] ought to be no fear in regard of man in
[13:29] that those respects but our fear is
[13:31] properly to God who is the creator of
[13:34] our bodies
[13:36] and so Jesus is
[13:38] in a way addressing phobia
[13:41] because phobia is an extreme or
[13:43] irrational fear of something or an
[13:46] extreme irrational aversion to something
[13:48] don't raise your hand but there may be
[13:50] people here who have certain phobias
[13:53] and phobia phobia is an anxiety disorder
[13:57] if it maybe wanted to get clinical with
[13:58] it that's defined by a persistent and
[14:01] excessive fear of an object or situation
[14:05] now in in describing that I'm sure some
[14:08] of you realize that you can have a
[14:09] phobia and then there's a fear you could
[14:10] be scared or something afraid or be in a
[14:12] moment be
[14:14] um kind of scared like a clown could
[14:16] jump out of the closet and scare you and
[14:19] that's not necessarily a phobia but then
[14:20] you could just be irrationally afraid of
[14:23] clowns period and when you see them you
[14:24] start panicking and sweating and that's
[14:27] what they would say is a phobia because
[14:28] they say it's some sort of extreme fear
[14:30] even an irrational fear that is
[14:33] excessive
[14:34] now I would say by definition a phobias
[14:38] contrary to the state of mind that a
[14:40] Believer has a right to
[14:42] any phobias contrary to the state of
[14:45] mind that a Believer has a right to and
[14:48] then in a certain context and I don't
[14:50] think I'm narrowing things by saying
[14:51] this but in a certain context
[14:53] that any fear is a phobia
[14:57] when it comes to certain things because
[14:58] God says you should not be afraid at all
[15:01] under any situation therefore to fear it
[15:05] at all is irrational and excessive
[15:07] and so there's a lot of things that are
[15:09] a phobia to a believer that may not
[15:11] clinically be a phobia to other people
[15:13] but God would say you have a phobia
[15:15] about that and you shouldn't you're
[15:17] constantly worried about this you're
[15:19] afraid this is going to happen you're
[15:21] afraid of that and God's saying
[15:22] spiritually I'm diagnosing you with
[15:24] phobia because it's irrational it's
[15:27] excessive it's persistent
[15:29] because he gives us a promise that we
[15:31] ought not to fear and when we do it tips
[15:34] over to where it's like this is not
[15:36] rational as a Believer this is not how
[15:38] you ought to be
[15:39] in John Chapter 14 verse 27 he says
[15:42] peace I leave with you my peace I give
[15:44] unto you not as the world giveth give I
[15:47] unto you let not your heart be troubled
[15:50] neither Let It Be Afraid
[15:52] that's troubling this agitation this
[15:54] uncertainty this anxiety this
[15:56] apprehension however you can describe it
[15:59] for yourself he's saying we should not
[16:01] fear over and over when he tells us to
[16:03] believe he addresses doubt and fear fear
[16:06] not believe only there's a there's a
[16:08] kind of a companion to that that we've
[16:10] got to get fear crossed out that we've
[16:12] got to get fear out of our Lives we've
[16:13] got to get away from being afraid so
[16:15] when he when my when I talk about phobia
[16:17] we're we're equating it with fear
[16:19] neither Let It Be Afraid in God's way
[16:23] made for us he says after through the
[16:25] service of this week trying to show
[16:27] people that there's no need of being
[16:28] scared
[16:30] the worst thing the devil can put on you
[16:32] is fear
[16:34] all right
[16:35] that think about it and he doesn't just
[16:37] say it in one place
[16:41] the worst thing the devil can put on you
[16:44] is fear if you even had a cancer I know
[16:46] we read this recently if you even had a
[16:48] Cancer and didn't fear and believed God
[16:50] would heal you you wouldn't be in too
[16:52] bad a shape
[16:54] God will take care of that if you are
[16:56] sick whatever it is if you didn't fear
[16:58] so fear is one of the worst things that
[17:01] Satan can place upon the person
[17:04] we say oh Cancer's got to be the worst
[17:06] no because if you had cancer and believe
[17:08] God could heal you you wouldn't be bad
[17:10] off because God can take care of that
[17:12] right so cancer is not the worst thing
[17:14] he can put on you death's not the worst
[17:15] thing he can put on you a lost job or
[17:17] singleness whatever you look at it he
[17:19] said oh this is the worst this is the
[17:20] worst no your Situation's not the worst
[17:23] your attitude towards it is the worst
[17:26] and your fear and apprehension of a
[17:28] situation or a circumstance is the worst
[17:31] thing that you could be put on you the
[17:32] worst thing the devil can put on you the
[17:34] worst thing Satan can put on you is fear
[17:37] fear of your condition fear of your
[17:39] symptoms fear of your circumstance fear
[17:41] of the possibility of something
[17:44] that's the worst thing that the devil
[17:46] could put on you
[17:48] in second Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 for
[17:50] God hath not given us the spirit of fear
[17:54] so this is something that addresses this
[17:57] uncertainty this apprehension doubt or
[17:59] uh anxiety however I'm hoping that the
[18:04] words are used in such a way to get your
[18:05] attention God has not given us the
[18:07] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[18:10] and of a sound mind
[18:12] it's not a spirit that causes us to fear
[18:14] but it's a spirit that has power it's a
[18:16] spirit that has love and it's a spirit
[18:18] of a sound mind
[18:20] that sound mind means self-control
[18:24] and if you think about that in light of
[18:26] what an actual phobia is someone who has
[18:28] a phobia is not able to control their
[18:31] emotions
[18:32] they see they see a clown and they
[18:35] immediately get scared and like there's
[18:37] no reason why I should be afraid of this
[18:39] it's just a picture
[18:41] right of a clown there's certain
[18:43] physical responses people can have in a
[18:46] phobia and it they say it's irrational
[18:48] it's excessive I'm not trying to
[18:50] diagnose today or get into the science
[18:51] of it or the even the medical diagnosis
[18:53] of it but enough for you to understand
[18:55] what I'm talking about he says that we
[18:57] ought to have a sound mind that means to
[18:59] be restored to one's senses it means to
[19:02] be sober
[19:04] and fear is intoxicating
[19:07] they say fear is a great motivator why
[19:09] it drives somebody to do something I had
[19:12] a coach a baseball coach in high school
[19:14] who used fear as a motivator and he
[19:17] figured that's the only way to get
[19:18] people to get things done is fear is
[19:20] going to be a great motivator and he
[19:21] scared us into doing what we were
[19:23] supposed to do and it can cause
[19:25] discipline and it could cause
[19:26] perseverance and cause people to do
[19:28] things all through fear but you have to
[19:30] realize that's a man-made tactic that's
[19:32] akin to the tactic of Satan that's not
[19:34] how God wants to motivate you
[19:37] so fear is intoxicating
[19:39] when someone is afraid it impairs their
[19:42] perception
[19:43] when somebody's afraid of something uh
[19:46] their estimation their judgment is wrong
[19:48] and because their judgment is wrong
[19:49] their action is wrong that when you're
[19:51] motivated by fear you'll see something
[19:53] maybe as bigger than it is and therefore
[19:56] uh you you run away from it because your
[19:58] judgment is off or you're afraid to do
[20:01] something oh I can't do it I'm afraid I
[20:03] can't do it therefore you will not
[20:04] attempt action you'll be paralyzed
[20:06] because of it because fear is
[20:09] intoxicating it impairs our senses and
[20:12] we have not been given a spirit of fear
[20:14] to intoxicate us or motivate us but
[20:17] we've been given a spirit that gives us
[20:18] power love and a sound mind to act and
[20:22] to do
[20:24] in Romans chapter 8 verse 15 for you
[20:27] have not received the spirit of bondage
[20:28] again to fear but you have received the
[20:31] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[20:33] Father
[20:34] now we have that Spirit of adoption the
[20:37] spirit of adoption is the holy spirit
[20:38] it's the holy spirit that is placing us
[20:40] it's that's a very a beautiful principle
[20:42] in the word of God that we could look at
[20:44] but we have the spirit of adoption or
[20:46] the spirit of power and love and a sound
[20:48] mind but not the spirit of bondage
[20:50] and fear is the fruit
[20:53] of bondage
[20:55] that one you're subject to something
[20:57] you've yielded your spirit to something
[20:59] other than God this agitation this
[21:02] apprehension this anxiety this
[21:03] trepidation this uh this phobia is a
[21:07] fruit of a bondage or some way you've
[21:09] allowed your mind to become subject to
[21:12] some something that is not in harmony
[21:14] with the spirit of power love and a
[21:16] sound mind
[21:18] brother Branham says in the sermon
[21:19] Israel in the church
[21:21] and when I was reading this I was
[21:23] reading a biography a dissertation by a
[21:27] theological student on FF Bosworth and
[21:30] just reading through his history and the
[21:32] number and he went through brother
[21:34] branham's uh relationship with brother
[21:36] Bosworth and many many many pages on it
[21:38] it was really neat kind of see that
[21:39] historical perspective and then come and
[21:41] read this statement in 1953 and know
[21:43] where brother Branham had been and what
[21:45] he had been doing and he says this when
[21:47] he's coming back to Jeffersonville after
[21:48] bending on the on the field for quite
[21:50] some time he says this has been the
[21:51] greatest thing that I found among the
[21:53] Christian people throughout the entire
[21:54] world world has been a fear
[21:58] the greatest thing brother man's coming
[22:00] back I've been around the world what
[22:01] have you found amongst the Christian
[22:02] people the greatest things fear
[22:05] not Faith but fear he says they're
[22:07] always afraid
[22:10] and then he relates it to this and when
[22:11] a little sickness strikes they are
[22:13] afraid
[22:15] many I wonder sometime and now I'm along
[22:16] with you but now what I'm trying to do
[22:19] tonight and this week to come is to try
[22:21] to drive that fear Away by God's word
[22:26] that's the only way you can do it the
[22:28] only way that you can drive fear away is
[22:31] by God's word
[22:32] the the there's there's not a remedy
[22:36] that the world can offer you to deal
[22:38] with fear
[22:43] they're always afraid
[22:46] when a little sickness strikes they are
[22:48] afraid now
[22:50] um I hope I hope you kind of caught my
[22:52] what I meant by there's not a remedy in
[22:54] the world that can drive fear away
[22:56] if you're seeking healing you're sick
[22:58] and you're afraid fear is not going to
[23:00] get you the wellness you're Desiring
[23:03] faith is what you wanted I want to hold
[23:06] on to fear it will drive you away from
[23:09] God's word but if God's word can ever
[23:11] strike your heart it'll drive away fear
[23:14] now to continue to amplify phobia or
[23:17] fear in Proverbs chapter 10 verse 24
[23:19] this is Satan's tactic it is the
[23:22] weakness of man to use fear as a
[23:24] motivator in Proverbs chapter 10 verse
[23:26] 24 says the fear of the wicked it shall
[23:28] come upon him but the desire of the
[23:30] righteous shall be granted
[23:32] and so a righteous man desires something
[23:34] he Longs for something he pursues
[23:36] something and he says the Wicked Man
[23:38] fears something and what the righteous
[23:40] man desires he receives but what the
[23:42] Wicked Man fears
[23:45] he gets
[23:47] what he dreads in his own mind will be
[23:49] what he receives
[23:51] this is what the scripture is saying
[23:52] that a wicked man when he fears
[23:54] something and he's afraid of something
[23:56] happening that's exactly what happens to
[23:59] him
[24:00] and and I don't know why I thought of
[24:02] this but in my experience as an attorney
[24:05] that whenever I had a client or an
[24:07] adversary who just for no reason accused
[24:10] me of lying I immediately knew I was
[24:12] being lied to
[24:14] right you ever met the the people who
[24:16] who are always trying to call you out
[24:18] for lying and they're really suspicious
[24:19] are you taking advantage of me did you
[24:20] lie to me are you misrepresenting this
[24:22] you know are you going to give me a fake
[24:24] 20 Bill and change to my fake hundred
[24:26] dollar bill right they're worried about
[24:28] it because oftentimes it's the it's the
[24:30] wickedness of the person's heart that's
[24:31] what they've come to expect because
[24:33] that's what they give out and so and I
[24:36] think maybe that's just a different
[24:37] aside but when I kept reading the
[24:39] scripture last week this kept coming to
[24:40] me but the fear of the wicked is what he
[24:42] receives what he thinks about what he's
[24:44] afraid about uh in in in in in a state
[24:48] of apprehension and worry
[24:50] to him it's what he gets
[24:54] fear is powerful
[24:56] fear may not be an Evidence and fear may
[24:58] not be a substance but it has this power
[25:00] to bring to a person what they're
[25:04] dreading
[25:05] as an example in Genesis chapter 11
[25:07] verse 4 it says and they said and this
[25:09] is After the flood they said go to let
[25:11] us build us a city and a tower whose top
[25:14] May reach unto heaven and let us make us
[25:16] a name lest we be scattered abroad upon
[25:20] the face of the whole Earth
[25:22] their motivation in building the city
[25:24] was not just merely to have a place of
[25:26] habitation nor was it just merely to
[25:28] have a name but it was motivated by fear
[25:30] the fear of what the fear of being
[25:31] scattered and says so let us build us a
[25:34] tower that may reach unto heaven so that
[25:36] we will not be because we are afraid of
[25:38] being scattered throughout the whole
[25:40] earth we're afraid that something's
[25:41] going to happen like it did to our
[25:43] ancestor Noah and so out of fear they
[25:45] built a tower and guess what happened
[25:48] they were afraid of being scattered
[25:50] throughout the whole earth so they built
[25:52] a tower and what did God do when they
[25:54] built the Tower in verse 8 it says the
[25:56] Lord scattered them abroad upon the face
[25:58] of the whole earth did he have to go and
[26:01] do it exactly like they thought it I
[26:03] mean he could have just said he
[26:04] scattered them abroad but they were
[26:06] afraid to be scattered abroad upon the
[26:07] face of the whole earth and the verse
[26:09] says he scattered them abroad upon the
[26:11] face of the whole Earth
[26:12] to the very description to the very
[26:14] letter they got what they were afraid of
[26:19] now you say well that's to the wicked
[26:20] that's to the wicked ambition now that's
[26:22] and I said that's true that's what the
[26:23] scripture is identifying as wicked
[26:25] ambition Wicked fear and those things
[26:26] will bring it to that Wicked person to
[26:28] that unrighteousness now just think of
[26:30] it man in general Proverbs 29 verse 25
[26:32] the fear of man bringeth the snare
[26:36] but who so puteth his trust in the Lord
[26:37] shall be saved so there is again the the
[26:40] companion the fear of the wicked and the
[26:41] desire of the righteous the fear of man
[26:43] bringeth the fear bringeth the snare now
[26:46] when it says the fear of man it's not
[26:48] necessarily that I'm afraid of Brother
[26:49] Martin or I'm free to brother Philip but
[26:51] human fear
[26:53] human fear the fear of humanity the the
[26:56] human fear as as Jesus says I I'm trying
[27:00] to give you peace not as the world gives
[27:02] so the world tries to give a peace and
[27:04] there's also a worldly fear there's a
[27:05] worldly sorrow and here it's not that we
[27:07] would be afraid of man necessarily but
[27:09] it's the it's the human fear and it's
[27:12] saying this human fear
[27:15] it is even if it's subconscious I want
[27:18] you to think about what your fear is on
[27:21] some level when you fear something ask
[27:24] yourself that if the root is a is a
[27:27] distrust in the goodness of God
[27:30] or a lack of conviction that God will
[27:33] keep his promise because his promises
[27:35] are pervasive tall area of life and so
[27:38] where there's fear it is inhere inherent
[27:41] in that this human fear is a lack of
[27:45] trust in God that brings bondage
[27:48] because he says the fear of man a human
[27:49] fear brings a snare it brings bondage it
[27:52] brings distress because I'm not trusted
[27:54] in God to fill his promise because I'm
[27:56] afraid of God's judgment I'm afraid of
[27:58] this I'm afraid of that when you think
[27:59] that way and feel that way he's saying
[28:01] what it does is it brings you into
[28:03] distress it brings you into bondage
[28:05] because of a lack of trust it breeds a
[28:08] fear of consequence or outcome
[28:10] so fear brings a snare it brings a trap
[28:24] in
[28:27] Jairus and Divine Healing
[28:29] his statement here brother Brown says
[28:31] it's the atmosphere
[28:35] you got to get away from it so there's
[28:37] atmosphere that's being talked about
[28:39] if you
[28:41] if you look within uh maybe corporate
[28:45] culture maybe professional sports
[28:47] sometimes they make a distinction
[28:49] between culture and climate
[28:52] and that the first thing you have to
[28:53] change before a culture can change is
[28:55] the climate
[28:57] and and an attitude and a certain
[29:00] feeling and brother branham's kind of
[29:01] dealing with you want something to
[29:03] change internally you want there to be
[29:04] permanent change change the atmosphere
[29:06] you got to change the atmosphere first
[29:08] that's why we come to church early and
[29:10] pray that's why we have song Services
[29:12] it's a changing of the atmosphere so it
[29:14] can be change of character that there
[29:15] can be things deposited he says from
[29:17] that Old confusion you got to get away
[29:19] from that Old confusion oh I'm going to
[29:21] be maybe the sphere oh one day one day
[29:23] says you're scared
[29:25] that's what's the matter
[29:28] you're seeing is how he's saying this
[29:30] you're scared and he's dealing with fear
[29:32] he's dealing with a fearful atmosphere a
[29:34] climate of agitation and apprehension
[29:36] and then he says you'll be frying your
[29:38] meal of a morning for breakfast and the
[29:39] first thing you know you're filled with
[29:41] Holy Spirit
[29:42] but he's trying to say you've got the
[29:44] Holy Ghost and you're cooking breakfast
[29:45] he's wanting us to imagine now you that
[29:48] have the Holy Ghost you're there at the
[29:50] counter you're cooking or you have to
[29:52] get you're in the kitchen and you're
[29:53] cooking he says now in the next slide
[29:55] now I'm going to shock you a little bit
[29:57] so now he pauses and he wants to reset
[29:58] he says you don't mind do you
[30:00] all right for instance the meats of
[30:03] frying and all at once the grease pops
[30:06] out on your hand
[30:08] now he's dealing with fear
[30:10] an atmosphere he says now if you'll just
[30:12] shake it off and go on frying meat it
[30:15] wouldn't bother you
[30:17] now I know you didn't get that just
[30:19] right look first thing oh where's the
[30:21] onion team you know whatever the
[30:23] Melaleuca gel mellow gel and thieves oil
[30:26] whatever it is we use to placate our
[30:29] Burns and just to take the heat away
[30:32] whatever it is we reach for he's saying
[30:34] oh go get the cream go get the Salve go
[30:36] get the bomb go get the aloe vera hurry
[30:38] go get it very very quick he says you
[30:40] see you grab your hand and you start
[30:42] reaching for something he goes it scares
[30:44] you to death that's what does it it's
[30:47] fear
[30:49] this now he's wanting us to think about
[30:53] the power of fear and how atmosphere and
[30:56] we got to get away from this and he's
[30:57] just using a very simple example he says
[30:59] just watch if you're filled with the
[31:00] Holy Ghost and you're in your kitchen
[31:02] and you're cooking and in Greece you
[31:05] burn yourself you touch something you
[31:06] grab something and you burn yourself
[31:07] he's given us a principle that if you
[31:10] would just say oh no big deal
[31:12] I'm going to keep going on I'm not going
[31:14] to let this bother me he's saying that
[31:16] that it wouldn't even bother you but
[31:19] when you pause in that moment and you
[31:21] begin to go oh my goodness that was red
[31:23] hot oh I've been burnt before Oh no and
[31:26] you begin to panic he's saying that's
[31:28] what does it is your fear
[31:30] now I I can see why he says now I'm
[31:33] going to shock you a little bit and ask
[31:34] us if we don't mind because that's
[31:36] almost seems are you sure I'm pretty
[31:39] sure the fact that it was glowing hot is
[31:41] the reason why my skin is melting
[31:44] they say no there's more to it now how
[31:46] many here could testify I can testify
[31:49] and I know number of testimonies that
[31:51] based upon this statement alone people
[31:54] have taken that approach
[31:56] and avoided blistering any kind of Mark
[31:59] I've touched things that would have
[32:01] ripped my skin right off me like oh my
[32:03] goodness that was not good but just went
[32:06] on
[32:07] with my life and acted like no you got
[32:09] to get the meat cooked
[32:10] and never even experience any pain
[32:15] brother Madam backs it up again these
[32:17] both are made the statements made in a
[32:19] very similar time period so something
[32:20] that he was taking into consideration he
[32:22] says when you go to fry your meat for
[32:24] breakfast and a big bunch of Grease pops
[32:26] up on your up on your hand
[32:28] see it's okay to cook with grease
[32:31] says the first thing you it just scares
[32:33] you to death you grab your hand where's
[32:35] the uncontin and again that's just some
[32:37] sort of balm and Salve at the time used
[32:39] to treat burns just as quick as you can
[32:41] that's the reason it burns you that's
[32:44] what makes the scare is what he says I
[32:47] can prove that
[32:48] it's the scare that burns you
[32:53] now you say brother random says I can
[32:55] prove that
[32:57] and it may be to you to seem to be
[33:00] unrealistic
[33:01] that scientifically we could explain why
[33:04] something at a certain temperature
[33:06] is going to to cause a burn or some sort
[33:10] of damage to the skin and whether it be
[33:12] blistering or a second or third degree
[33:14] whatever it might be some sort of
[33:16] redness or that heat you know what you
[33:18] know what it feels like to be burned
[33:20] um he's saying that it's fear that's
[33:22] going to amplify that it's fear that's
[33:24] going to cause it to burn
[33:27] and he says I can prove it
[33:29] now I want to use this at this point and
[33:32] I was thinking that a whole an entire
[33:34] service would go good with it would be
[33:36] this would be worth a whole service but
[33:38] I want to introduce the principle
[33:39] because it's going to kind of be a part
[33:41] of some of our future services on this
[33:42] maybe at least one more but how many
[33:45] have heard of the placebo effect
[33:47] sure you've all heard of this placebo
[33:48] effect it's a beneficial effect produced
[33:51] by a placebo
[33:53] Placebo drug or a placebo treatment
[33:56] now the placebo treatment is in itself
[33:59] it's called the placebo and it's either
[34:01] a pill or some sort of treatment that
[34:04] itself is nothing in other words there's
[34:06] no active agent in it
[34:09] which cannot be attributed so it's a
[34:11] beneficial effect which cannot be
[34:13] attributed to the drug or the treatment
[34:14] so the effect is attributed to the
[34:17] patient's belief
[34:20] so a placebo effect is usually referred
[34:23] to in medical trials or some sort of
[34:24] Remedy or treatment where it's like
[34:26] somebody has a burn and like we're going
[34:28] to go ahead and we're going to put this
[34:30] Medicated cream on your burn and we're
[34:32] going to apply it with these certain
[34:33] intervals and it has this active
[34:35] ingredient it has this new breakthrough
[34:37] cream that's going to cause you to to
[34:39] not blister or cause you not to scar and
[34:42] they put it on some people with the
[34:43] active ingredient and then they put just
[34:45] nothing
[34:46] on somebody else
[34:48] and they tell them oh yeah this is the
[34:49] best there is right and it's just it's
[34:51] just water
[34:52] and they'll put it on them they'll do it
[34:54] even with sugar pills they'll give them
[34:55] a pill this has by zenzatipetine in it
[34:58] and it's going to cause all your
[34:59] freckles to go away and then this other
[35:01] person said this has my zipitene in it
[35:04] but really it's just sugar
[35:06] and they take a similar looking pill and
[35:08] what they recognized is that when they
[35:11] do these trials or people are treated
[35:12] with these things that doesn't have
[35:15] anything in it at all
[35:17] right it's just the essence of the
[35:18] essence of the shadow of the essence in
[35:20] it but yet people get results from it
[35:24] and then when they compare it in
[35:25] clinical trials sometimes the positive
[35:28] results will be the same with people who
[35:30] receive the placebo as people who use
[35:32] the active ingredient
[35:34] so this is a scientific term essentially
[35:37] they say wow
[35:38] the person got the benefit but we can't
[35:41] attribute the benefit to the Sugar Pill
[35:44] we can attribute the benefit to what we
[35:47] gave them because there was no active in
[35:49] it therefore they believed that the
[35:51] patient's belief that they were taking
[35:53] it
[35:55] come on somebody
[35:58] the benefit was in their belief and
[36:01] their expectation that what they were
[36:03] receiving would cause something
[36:07] wow placebo
[36:11] it's a medicine given more to please the
[36:14] patient than to benefit the patient
[36:18] that's what some elevators have they
[36:20] have placebo buttons right
[36:23] and thankfully it's not the floors right
[36:25] it's the door closed it's there to
[36:29] please the passenger it's not going to
[36:32] cause it to close you're not going to do
[36:34] anything to close it but you want to
[36:36] know that when you see that person
[36:37] coming down the hallway
[36:39] right
[36:41] something's happening
[36:42] you go to a crosswalk they have placebo
[36:44] buttons right push it to walk it's on a
[36:47] timer Bud that did nothing
[36:49] but it's there to please you
[36:51] and what do you think watch this watch
[36:53] this son
[36:54] it's going to turn
[36:57] you right you expect it but it's this
[37:00] there and so in medicine a police deal
[37:01] was a medicine given more to please than
[37:03] to benefit the patient
[37:05] it comes from the Latin Placebo come
[37:07] from Latin to please
[37:09] you actually find the scripture and
[37:10] that's where originally it has its roots
[37:12] and religion placebo
[37:15] now that is a beneficial effect produced
[37:20] by a patient's expectation or belief now
[37:22] have you ever heard of the nocebo effect
[37:25] it's a negative outcome because a person
[37:27] believes harm will come
[37:30] there's a placebo effect and now there's
[37:32] a companion to it and maybe it would be
[37:34] the doctors Among Us that would know
[37:35] this brother Andrew and other doctors
[37:37] would know this that there's a can be a
[37:39] negative outcome based upon a person's
[37:42] belief that harm will come and it comes
[37:44] from the Latin to harm
[37:46] so Placebo is to please it's something
[37:48] given to please the patient rather than
[37:50] to benefit them necessarily but then a
[37:51] nocebo effect is a negative outcome that
[37:54] happens because a person believes that
[37:56] something negative will happen this is a
[37:59] very rich field of study within the
[38:00] medical community and here's a statement
[38:02] for adverse reactions to Medicine
[38:05] nasibo implies that patients are more
[38:08] likely to experience an adverse effect
[38:10] if they expect or are worried about the
[38:15] adverse effect
[38:17] the adverse effects may be physically
[38:19] experienced by the patient and are often
[38:21] clinically diagnosable
[38:23] are you listening to this yeah in other
[38:26] words you can in a trial give appeal to
[38:29] somebody and say this pill is going to
[38:31] cure you of your crankiness
[38:34] and and it has this active ingredient in
[38:37] it called faith and it's going to cure
[38:39] you right maybe I shouldn't embellish it
[38:41] that way but you're taking this pill and
[38:43] it's going to make you it's going to do
[38:44] this to you but then the side effects
[38:46] are dizziness dry mouth lethargy right
[38:50] death like all these things that they
[38:53] say in the in the because of the lawyers
[38:57] that this pill may do to you
[38:59] and then they'll give people a sugar
[39:01] pill and wouldn't you know it they have
[39:04] the side effects
[39:06] that other people are actually taking
[39:08] the radiation taking the pill taking the
[39:10] medicine they have the same diagnosable
[39:13] and physical manifestations of the
[39:17] adverse effects and they aren't actually
[39:19] taking the active ingredient
[39:22] so what would do that
[39:24] you think maybe a hillbilly from
[39:26] Kentucky in 1953 is kind of 54 is kind
[39:29] of clueing us in on the power of our
[39:32] apprehensions the power of our fears the
[39:34] power of our worries do you not think
[39:36] the scripture nailed it thousands of
[39:38] years ago and it says the fear of the
[39:39] wicked comes upon them the fear of man
[39:41] bringeth the snare
[39:43] this dread and apprehension that a
[39:45] person has this negative outcome comes
[39:48] because they believe harm will come I do
[39:51] not want you to separate what I'm
[39:52] talking about from the treatment and
[39:54] remedy of a sickness or the very cause
[39:57] of a sickness that the thing the fear
[39:59] and the phobia itself is the cause or
[40:02] there are certain things you will not do
[40:04] to actually make yourself better because
[40:06] you're afraid it'll harm you and then
[40:08] when you actually do it it harms you why
[40:10] you were afraid it was going to harm you
[40:15] the nocebo effect
[40:19] it's the fear that actually burns them
[40:23] not the fire not the heat because it
[40:25] really wasn't there to begin with
[40:28] anybody ever heard of Munchausen
[40:30] syndrome
[40:33] you ever heard of it it's a factitious
[40:35] disorder
[40:36] and it's a syndrome it's named after I
[40:39] believe a German soldier German officer
[40:42] from World War one or two can't remember
[40:44] now should have grabbed those notes with
[40:46] me but it's faking an illness or
[40:48] inducing an illness faking or inducing a
[40:50] disease or illness to draw attention
[40:52] to get sympathy or affirmation
[40:54] Munchausen syndrome
[40:57] and I'd love to spend more time on it
[40:59] because I think maybe it's not a
[41:01] clinical problem but we've got to be
[41:03] careful that there's not just a little
[41:04] munchkin Munchausen in us right
[41:08] a little bit a part of us that wants to
[41:09] be sick that wants to be needy that
[41:11] wants to wants to be compromised for
[41:14] attention
[41:15] for sympathy
[41:17] it's fake in a disease or faking an
[41:19] illness to draw attention sympathy or
[41:21] affirmation and what they are able this
[41:24] is this is clinical diagnosis this is
[41:26] visible physical manifestations that
[41:29] people with Munchausen Syndrome are able
[41:31] to produce symptoms
[41:35] they aren't actually sick but because of
[41:39] this mental condition they're actually
[41:41] able by thought process and by thinking
[41:44] and by Focus and by agitation and by
[41:47] fear and because of that this this
[41:49] condition and there's a lot more maybe
[41:51] to just explain the situation and what
[41:53] the triggering factors are and how a
[41:55] person could come to be this way there's
[41:57] a lot of different ways they try to
[41:58] track the causation but they they're the
[42:01] literature is telling us that a person
[42:03] who actually doesn't have this problem
[42:05] can manifest symptoms often leading to
[42:08] years and years and thousands and tens
[42:11] of thousands of medical intervention and
[42:13] treatment
[42:14] because the doctors and the the tests
[42:17] and certain things will show well we're
[42:18] showing this and we're showing that and
[42:20] we see this we see this but they can
[42:22] never ever ever find the reason for it
[42:26] but it's all
[42:28] in the person's fear
[42:36] in Job chapter 3 verse 25
[42:40] for the thing which I greatly feared has
[42:42] come upon me
[42:44] and that which I was afraid of is come
[42:46] unto me
[42:48] this is a righteous man
[42:50] this is one in whom God said was perfect
[42:52] and upright this is somebody that God
[42:54] bragged about this is somebody that
[42:55] stated and said you know what the only
[42:57] reason why he is the way he is is
[42:58] because you blessed him
[43:01] and when you look at his life story
[43:03] there's ways that we could try to
[43:04] speculate and try to figure out what was
[43:06] it easy afraid of he he sacrificed for
[43:08] his children pre-adventure they would
[43:10] sin maybe there was this worry and and
[43:13] then when the first person came to and
[43:14] says oh there was the wind came and it
[43:16] killed all your children they
[43:17] immediately thought oh no what's going
[43:18] to happen to my cattle right and and
[43:21] immediately like this fear what it
[43:23] cascaded it got that's the very things
[43:24] this is just job's word that which I
[43:27] greatly feared has come upon me that
[43:28] which I was afraid of has come unto me
[43:31] and brother bam says this in the sermon
[43:32] perfect faith if some of you have gone
[43:34] and listened to that or studied it as of
[43:36] late this will stand out to you
[43:38] in what he feared speaking of job it
[43:40] actually happened
[43:41] what brought it his fear that's what
[43:44] made it happen it's just what job is
[43:46] saying it's what Proverbs is saying I
[43:48] know it may sound a little bit edgy and
[43:50] controversial when brother Branham says
[43:52] if you're frying uh you're you're beyond
[43:55] sausage in the morning
[43:56] and and a little uh grease pops out
[43:59] avocado oil and it lands on your hand
[44:03] right it pops out on your hand
[44:05] and you go I'm not even going to worry
[44:06] about it you reach into the oven to grab
[44:09] the keto friendly Brownie and it's been
[44:11] at 450 and you forget to put on an oven
[44:14] Mitten you're like you know what I'm not
[44:15] even just going to worry I'm not going
[44:16] to worry about it and he says it's the
[44:18] fear that causes the burn let me think
[44:19] well that seems ridiculous well
[44:22] it's not just brother Brandon saying it
[44:24] it's science saying it it's Job saying
[44:27] it it's the it's the writer in in
[44:29] Proverbs saying it it is not just it is
[44:32] not just some weird uh idea some kind of
[44:35] Fringe theology what he feared actually
[44:37] happened to him he says his faith would
[44:39] have kept him from it
[44:41] but his fear brought it to him
[44:43] there's no virtue and worry there's no
[44:44] virtue and fear
[44:46] his fear brought it to him he was scared
[44:48] it was going to happen and it did have
[44:53] had a brother at one time I I still have
[44:57] two brothers it was a brother that
[44:59] ministered one time and he told a story
[45:00] and he said that
[45:03] uh he was he was driving home from work
[45:05] one night and he hit a deer
[45:08] and it never happened his whole life and
[45:10] so then the next the next week he's gets
[45:13] his car fixed and he's driving he's he's
[45:14] so worried that he's going to hit a deer
[45:18] so he hits another deer this happened
[45:20] three or four times where finally his
[45:22] dad said hey
[45:24] you're creating them deers
[45:26] hey the fear the fear was bringing it to
[45:29] him let there be a dare right it was a
[45:32] man caught in headlights at that point
[45:33] he's creating his own fears bringing it
[45:35] to the very thing we can fear and think
[45:38] about and worry about and I'm afraid
[45:40] this is going to happen I'm afraid this
[45:41] is going to happen if I could just be so
[45:42] bold as to say sometimes in our
[45:44] relationships the very thing we fear
[45:46] about the person we begin to project
[45:48] upon the person and project upon the
[45:50] person and it's actually your fear that
[45:52] brings up the hardness or Rebellion or
[45:54] the distance
[45:56] and actually cultivates the real problem
[45:58] in the marriage or actually causes the
[46:00] real symptom in a child it's not because
[46:02] it was there it was your own fear and
[46:04] expectation I'm so afraid they're going
[46:05] to be this way I'm so afraid this guy
[46:07] I'm so afraid listen we've got to get
[46:08] away from the fear because your fear can
[46:10] bring things to you that you don't want
[46:16] now he brings it to Faith and Healing if
[46:19] you're afraid when you come by the
[46:20] prayer line maybe I just haven't got the
[46:22] faith sufficient it'll never happen and
[46:24] I think I find this to be funny don't
[46:25] worry
[46:26] right
[46:28] okay good
[46:31] it says if you have if you're afraid or
[46:33] you're worried you're not going to get
[46:34] healed then it won't happen
[46:36] but if you know what's going to happen
[46:38] it'll happen
[46:39] see it's a substance of something job
[46:41] had a fear that these things would come
[46:43] upon him and they did if you have a fear
[46:45] that your disease won't leave you it
[46:47] won't
[46:48] does that not just address it this
[46:51] phobia does not address oh I've been
[46:53] asking God to heal me I've been wanting
[46:54] God to heal me do you have any fear at
[46:57] all that maybe he won't look well yeah
[47:00] okay
[47:01] stop blaming God
[47:03] right
[47:05] get the blame forgive yourself right
[47:08] say I'm sorry if you need to forgive
[47:10] others if you need to forgive yourself
[47:12] if you need to but let's not blame God
[47:14] if there's any fear that's where the rat
[47:17] and the wood pile is
[47:19] if you fear that your disease won't
[47:20] leave you it won't
[47:22] in Matthew chapter 14 verses 27 to 31 is
[47:25] when Jesus came walking upon the waters
[47:27] to them and the Bible says they're
[47:29] fearful they're agitated they're scared
[47:30] is it a ghost he speaks to him be of
[47:32] good cheer and his eye Be not Afraid
[47:34] Christ in a Troublesome time with
[47:37] Troublesome apparitions and whatever it
[47:39] might be wants to speak to you by the
[47:40] word to tell you to calm yourself and
[47:43] Peter answered him and said Lord if it
[47:44] be thou bid me come unto thee on the
[47:46] water and Jesus said come
[47:49] and when Peter was come down out of the
[47:51] ship he walked on the water to go to
[47:55] Jesus
[47:57] this is the instinctive obedience to the
[47:59] command of God even in reply to his
[48:02] request if it's you tell me to come so
[48:05] he's walking upon the Water but when he
[48:06] saw the wind boisterous
[48:08] looked at the symptoms the circumstances
[48:10] he was afraid
[48:12] and beginning to sink he cried saying
[48:14] Lord save me
[48:17] now what caused him to walk on the water
[48:20] trusting in the bidding to come
[48:23] what made him sink the fear of the waves
[48:28] and Jesus said unto him at which he
[48:31] caught him he said oh thou of little
[48:33] faith in verse 31 why did you doubt
[48:38] now if you can catch this little faith
[48:39] was enough to walk on water
[48:41] it's not powerful just a little faith is
[48:43] little faith was enough to walk on water
[48:45] but just doubt at all is enough to
[48:48] undermine little faith
[48:51] when we've taken our minds the little
[48:53] faith in the word of God was enough to
[48:55] cause him to walk on water as soon as he
[48:57] got his eyes off the promise and his
[49:00] fear upon the waves he believed what the
[49:03] waves were saying
[49:04] and not what Christ was saying
[49:06] Bill Abraham says in the pillar fired
[49:08] the biggest trouble there is in the
[49:09] church today is a bunch of fear people's
[49:11] always scared and that's of the devil
[49:14] don't be scared be brave you don't have
[49:17] nothing to be could we finish the phrase
[49:19] scared of
[49:21] you don't have anything to be afraid of
[49:23] there ain't nothing to be afraid about
[49:27] that's pretty absolute if you ask me
[49:30] trying to address phobia fear
[49:32] apprehension dread suspicion whatever it
[49:34] might be Peter could walk on the water
[49:37] as long as he had a little faith and no
[49:39] fear and when he looked at the waves and
[49:41] not the promise when he when he looked
[49:43] at the wind and not the promise when he
[49:44] didn't keep his ears and his mind and
[49:46] his eyes on The Voice and His Eyes On
[49:47] Christ then fear was enough to cause him
[49:50] to sink
[50:00] in Genesis chapter 10 chapter 3
[50:09] verse 10
[50:12] and he said I heard this is after the
[50:15] fall
[50:16] this is man's response this is the first
[50:19] place we find fear I kept being drawn to
[50:21] this last week so I apologize if at this
[50:23] point you thought we should be winding
[50:25] down but I I just need to touch on this
[50:28] to kind of be our fulcrum to come to the
[50:30] end this is where fear begins
[50:33] we'd have never heard of it seen it
[50:35] would have never been mentioned
[50:37] except for this instance this fall and
[50:39] Adam says I heard thy voice in the
[50:41] garden
[50:42] it was the very thing that caused Peter
[50:45] to have the faith to come was and he
[50:47] heard the voice of God saying come is it
[50:49] you and he knew it was him when he knew
[50:50] it was Christ and he had the affirmation
[50:52] that it was him he was bid to come and
[50:54] that caused him to go to him in a
[50:56] Troublesome scene but now is the voice
[50:58] of God the thing that ought to have
[51:00] brought him Comfort the voice of God is
[51:02] fearful because I heard thy voice and I
[51:03] was afraid
[51:04] because I was naked and I hid myself
[51:08] notice that sin that gave rise to
[51:10] anxiety
[51:11] sin that gave birth to fear
[51:13] fear is a sin is a fruit of Satan fear
[51:16] is the fruit of Satan
[51:18] and what I'm wanting you to think now
[51:20] about
[51:21] is how that it was fear that provoked
[51:24] Adam's action
[51:27] it was fear that provoked Adam's
[51:29] response
[51:31] he says I was afraid
[51:32] and my fear caused me to address my
[51:35] nakedness I I was I was afraid had he
[51:38] the Bible ends in chapter two they were
[51:40] naked and not ashamed so the nakedness
[51:42] itself isn't the cause but it's a sphere
[51:44] that oh I'm afraid I need to do
[51:47] something about this shortcoming I need
[51:48] to do something about this nakedness and
[51:50] it's his fear that drove him to address
[51:52] his condition and if you go back to
[51:54] verse 7 when it when they sinned it says
[51:56] their eyes were opened and and they were
[51:59] they knew that they were naked and they
[52:01] sowed fig leaves together and made
[52:03] themselves aprons that's not Faith
[52:06] that's motivating that this is man's own
[52:09] logical uh this emotional based response
[52:12] to the situation and in each situation
[52:15] it was the wrong response and each
[52:17] situation Adam's being driven by certain
[52:19] emotions of Shame and fear and the wrong
[52:23] kind of knowledge he's been driven to
[52:25] remedy his situation and I want to make
[52:28] this applicable to whatever it is you
[52:29] find yourself in if there's a need if
[52:31] there's a lacking if there's a want if
[52:33] there's a desire you have to realize
[52:35] that there is a wrong way to set about
[52:38] satisfying or addressing your situation
[52:42] and when fear is the motivating factor
[52:44] you're going to put yourself in a very
[52:46] dangerous position
[52:48] because fear is the fruit of sin
[52:51] and Adam when he acted out of fear I
[52:53] would even go so far as to say that not
[52:56] only did he hide uh because he was
[52:58] afraid because of God's voice but it's
[53:00] fear that was driving him to sow the Fig
[53:02] leaves together because he was naked and
[53:04] not afraid but now all of a sudden he's
[53:06] naked and he's scared to death that he's
[53:07] got to cover himself and he's got to
[53:09] take care of this that's man's response
[53:10] reaching for fig leaves reaching for
[53:12] resources reaching for anything that
[53:14] could help me in my situation I just
[53:16] want to take it
[53:18] I think I've shared this in fellowship
[53:19] with some of you one of the things
[53:20] that's just been motivating me in this
[53:23] idea with this subject matter of Christ
[53:25] my healer is how the Believers are
[53:27] sincere that they want to be well when
[53:29] they say what do you want to be healed
[53:30] for they don't they don't have bad
[53:32] answers to that
[53:34] and in their own sincerity they want to
[53:36] they want to please God they want to do
[53:38] what's right they want to be healed and
[53:40] they're caught in this fix well if I
[53:42] have faith do I just believe I'm going
[53:43] to be healed without any any treatment
[53:45] without any remedies is it okay to go to
[53:48] the doctor is it okay to get this is it
[53:49] okay to do that is it okay to take pills
[53:51] is it okay is it okay or they get caught
[53:54] in this fix
[53:55] or they get so desperate they're just
[53:57] reaching for everything they can and
[53:58] it's just a Non-Stop treadmill of this
[54:00] and this and this and this and it just
[54:01] begins to compile to where are we
[54:03] getting any closer to Healing
[54:06] if that's the state of mind that we're
[54:08] in
[54:09] and Adam through fear was willing to
[54:11] reach for anything that would address
[54:12] the situation and we have to be careful
[54:15] that we're not acting according to the
[54:16] same Instinct that's now been sewn into
[54:18] Humanity
[54:19] that where there's something wrong fear
[54:21] begins to try to dress it
[54:24] brother Branham says in time-tested
[54:25] faith this maybe hopefully is turning
[54:27] the corner a little bit for us if God
[54:28] delivered you from sin which is what
[54:30] we're looking at in Genesis chapter 3.
[54:31] how much more will he deliver you from
[54:33] from your sickness
[54:34] he's able to take and change your nature
[54:36] and make you a new person why would you
[54:38] fear about any sickness
[54:40] and if you can save your soul and change
[54:41] your nature and change your motives and
[54:43] change your ideas how much more can you
[54:44] change your sickness into health and put
[54:46] it back in its right place again where
[54:47] it belongs
[54:49] this we're addressing phobia we're
[54:51] addressing fear the fear of the sickness
[54:53] the fear of the same the fear of the
[54:54] life sentence because of it he says it's
[54:56] just so simple that we go over the top
[54:58] of it
[55:00] fear is related to sin
[55:03] sickness is the result of sin
[55:07] fear can never be the Cure
[55:10] fear can never help us with the remedy
[55:12] if the with the in light of the nocebo
[55:14] effect we can actually bring upon us
[55:17] worse things where there is no reason or
[55:19] cause for it other than your fear
[55:25] if fear is driving your approach to
[55:27] Healing to treatment to remedy to uh in
[55:30] whether it be to abstain from something
[55:32] or to take it how can we receive what
[55:35] we're looking for
[55:37] if there's the reason why you're not
[55:38] going to do something how are you going
[55:39] to get the results you want
[55:41] I remember when sister Elizabeth uh
[55:43] years ago when we after we began to have
[55:45] children the big question for me I never
[55:48] knew there was a controversy about it
[55:49] but all of a sudden it was like you're
[55:51] not going to vaccinate your kids right
[55:52] and and it's I all of a sudden it was a
[55:55] controversy I'm like well me I just
[55:57] would have never thought about it right
[55:59] it's like
[56:01] you cook steak and someone's like oh
[56:03] where'd you get the steaks Walmart like
[56:04] you buy your meat at Walmart
[56:07] you're like
[56:09] yeah
[56:10] am I doing something wrong right it's
[56:12] just some people just have ways that
[56:14] they think and things they do and oh I
[56:15] never do that I never do that and I
[56:16] never do that and so all of a sudden it
[56:18] was a controversy and I just remember it
[56:21] was because of the attitudes and things
[56:23] that were being stoked at the time I
[56:24] realized this is just not as simple as I
[56:26] don't want my kid to die
[56:28] you know this was a moral platform now
[56:31] that was going to prove whether or not
[56:32] we were really message believers
[56:33] and I had to tell them I just told
[56:35] Elizabeth I said Elizabeth I'll support
[56:36] you in whatever decision you make as
[56:37] their mom
[56:38] I said but the but the only thing I'll
[56:41] say is whatever you do do it in faith
[56:42] not fear
[56:44] whatever you do make sure you have faith
[56:46] at the end of the day and I again I told
[56:47] I can still vividly remember I said
[56:49] because if you get them vaccinated out
[56:52] of fear then when they have a little bit
[56:54] of a fever for the next couple days
[56:55] immediately I shouldn't have done it I
[56:58] knew I shouldn't have done it I knew I
[56:59] should have listened to that sister with
[57:00] a big mouth or I should I knew right
[57:02] immediately it's like oh my goodness
[57:04] what have I done and you're you're now
[57:06] in dangerous slippery slope territory
[57:09] right
[57:10] you're you're in a you're in a situation
[57:12] where you can get yourself in big
[57:13] trouble and I said or if you don't get
[57:16] in the vaccine out of fear and then the
[57:19] few weeks later all of a sudden they got
[57:20] a really really high fever and they've
[57:21] got a blister you can't explain all of a
[57:23] sudden oh no what have I done all right
[57:25] and sister Elizabeth the time made a
[57:27] decision not to get Elliot the 24 Shots
[57:29] that they wanted to give him at two
[57:31] months and she wanted to wait and so we
[57:33] asked her pediatrician
[57:34] um we're taking them to South Africa you
[57:36] know is that safe do you think that's
[57:37] okay he goes Well ma'am you are the one
[57:39] who's chose not to vaccinate your
[57:40] one-year-old so you're on your own right
[57:43] you know you don't know we don't know
[57:44] what kind of diseases are there but
[57:46] whatever it is at the end of the day
[57:47] whatever decision she made I said just
[57:49] be sure it's faith
[57:51] otherwise you'll be plagued with fear
[57:54] about your decision
[57:58] if we're driven by fear how can we how
[58:01] can we get a positive result positive
[58:02] benefit
[58:04] if we avoid the doctor because of fear
[58:07] if we pursue an alternative care because
[58:10] of fear
[58:12] think about it
[58:14] you mentioned this before I believe it
[58:16] was Sister Nicole that said it in a way
[58:17] that I don't ever actually remember but
[58:19] it is the correct way feed a cold
[58:20] starvey fever
[58:21] I for some reason wanted to shove flu in
[58:23] there
[58:24] but his feet a cold starve a fever and I
[58:27] don't mean to offend anybody but
[58:29] they're both the the it's wrong
[58:31] to starve a fever medically
[58:34] nutritionally
[58:36] but it was uh they they came from and I
[58:38] tried to run down the etymology of it
[58:40] find the dictionaries find where it all
[58:41] started it's a mid-century thing
[58:42] medieval saying there's actually a
[58:44] dictionary from 1574 that said fasting
[58:47] is a great remedy for a fever
[58:50] and it was based upon the premise that
[58:52] of the belief that fasting would help
[58:54] the body cool down when you have an
[58:56] elevated temperature do you feel hot
[58:58] well when you eat your body temperature
[58:59] increases and when you feed yourself
[59:01] it's going to cause your body your
[59:02] temperature to raise so this was the
[59:04] logic and the time same time period
[59:06] where they drill a hole in your head to
[59:07] let your blood out if you had a headache
[59:09] but they'd say Hey you know if you got a
[59:11] fever don't eat don't drink because if
[59:13] you do it's going to cause your
[59:14] temperature to rise and now nutrient
[59:16] naturally naturally homeopathically
[59:18] holistically you name it I'm pretty sure
[59:21] there's the prevailing understood
[59:23] empirically uh proven way to feed both
[59:27] hey if you have a cold if you have a
[59:30] fever hydrate
[59:32] give yourself nutrition if you have a
[59:34] fever your body's fighting something
[59:35] your body needs energy right to fight it
[59:39] so am I right doctors right
[59:42] okay I'm getting like a slight nod okay
[59:44] I yield the floor
[59:46] to the surgeon
[59:49] well legally
[59:53] and I want to say this that if you are
[59:55] if you ought to in each situation be
[59:57] sure you're properly hydrated
[59:59] and properly getting the proper
[1:00:01] nutrition and not starving yourself and
[1:00:03] fasting I want to just change a little
[1:00:05] bit in terms of not the necessary the
[1:00:08] physical approach to your sickness but
[1:00:09] as I said it before feed your faith
[1:00:11] starve your phobia
[1:00:13] if you're gonna starve anything starve
[1:00:16] the fear
[1:00:17] if you got a cold if you got a fever
[1:00:19] feed your faith
[1:00:21] if you've got a blister feed your faith
[1:00:23] if you've got a bird feed your faith
[1:00:24] whatever it is feed your faith don't
[1:00:26] feed your phobia
[1:00:28] brother Adam in a sermon greater than
[1:00:30] Solomon is here he says but you know
[1:00:31] there's something about it that if your
[1:00:32] heart begins to hunger and thirst for
[1:00:34] God you don't pay any attention to the
[1:00:36] dangers or somewhere
[1:00:38] I think it's so beautiful then he kind
[1:00:40] of pivots he's talking about the Queen
[1:00:41] of Sheba he says doctor might say you're
[1:00:43] going to die with cancer but if your
[1:00:45] heart ever strikes faith in God you know
[1:00:47] you forget what the doctor said I love
[1:00:50] this phrase your heart knows no fear as
[1:00:53] long as it is filled with faith
[1:00:57] that's how you say well brother and I
[1:00:58] don't know what to do some people ask me
[1:00:59] questions after the service is
[1:01:01] unforgiveness well what does it mean to
[1:01:02] forgive right what does it look like if
[1:01:05] I feel very confident I can say this
[1:01:07] well what do you what do we do about
[1:01:08] phobia don't feed that feed your faith
[1:01:13] feed your faith with the word of God
[1:01:15] remember what the conclusion is if you
[1:01:17] Google your symptoms
[1:01:18] at the very end of the page you have
[1:01:20] cancer and you're going to die so we
[1:01:22] don't read that we go to the word of God
[1:01:24] we go to encouraging Fellowship we think
[1:01:26] about positive things we try to motivate
[1:01:28] ourselves and go forward there's things
[1:01:30] that we need to do in that situation
[1:01:31] instead of filling the void with fearful
[1:01:34] facts fill your heart with faith and he
[1:01:37] says your heart knows no fear as long as
[1:01:39] it's fed
[1:01:41] as long as it's filled so feed your
[1:01:44] faith fill it up starve the phobia
[1:01:49] phobia can be so overwhelming that a
[1:01:51] person goes to Great Lengths to avoid
[1:01:53] the trigger
[1:01:54] right
[1:01:55] that's how how fever a fear can be so
[1:01:58] great that people will go to Great
[1:02:00] Lengths to accommodate the fear
[1:02:03] go to Great Lengths to avoid the trigger
[1:02:06] do you I I we have to confess this this
[1:02:08] is confession time for me and the
[1:02:10] children
[1:02:12] I forgot the name of it but my wife has
[1:02:15] a fear of dots right little tiny orderly
[1:02:17] dots you might have what's trichophobia
[1:02:19] trypophobia
[1:02:21] Trypophobia okay thank you had to get
[1:02:24] him in on this one
[1:02:25] and and when you see it right
[1:02:28] oh it causes a sphere she has a little
[1:02:30] bit of a phobia of it I'm not saying
[1:02:31] you're sinful I'm just saying it's a
[1:02:33] phobia
[1:02:35] so we have a little game in our family
[1:02:38] of Elizabeth you won't believe this
[1:02:40] picture
[1:02:41] right
[1:02:42] and she's like oh why do you do that to
[1:02:44] me right just confession today
[1:02:46] just making making our Spirits right
[1:02:50] and uh and you'll if she knows it's
[1:02:53] coming there's just nothing in the world
[1:02:54] you can do to get her to see it
[1:02:56] all right because she'll do whatever it
[1:02:58] takes to avoid the trigger that's just
[1:03:00] an innocent way to allude to some of the
[1:03:01] phobias you might have
[1:03:03] and how much your lives have been
[1:03:05] altered
[1:03:07] and your peace and your joy and your
[1:03:09] course because of this excessive fear of
[1:03:13] something
[1:03:15] you're no longer living in the freedom
[1:03:17] and the Liberty that a Christian ought
[1:03:18] to have because you're afraid of
[1:03:20] something
[1:03:21] and that's what a phobia can be so
[1:03:23] overwhelming that a person will change
[1:03:25] their life their life to say things do
[1:03:26] things do all sorts of things and a
[1:03:28] phobia
[1:03:30] can be so tremendous that it'll produce
[1:03:32] panic attacks
[1:03:34] now I'm wanting to use this again to tie
[1:03:36] back into the placebo effect and the
[1:03:38] nocebo effect relaying a great
[1:03:39] Foundation while we attack this sin of
[1:03:41] fear while we attack fear and phobia now
[1:03:44] a phobia can be so tremendous that not
[1:03:47] only does a person alter their life but
[1:03:49] when exposed to it or the very thought
[1:03:52] that they may be exposed they may not
[1:03:54] even be close to a clown at all but they
[1:03:57] can start thinking about it and their
[1:03:59] heart rate Rises
[1:04:01] I'm not trying to be funny just using an
[1:04:03] example that hopefully is a little bit
[1:04:04] innocent to us but hopefully the devil
[1:04:06] can be exposed today just by mere fear
[1:04:09] it's not even present
[1:04:12] even if it was that spider's not going
[1:04:14] to hurt you
[1:04:15] right that little snake doesn't he
[1:04:17] doesn't even have a bite in it it's dead
[1:04:19] it's fake right whatever it is but the
[1:04:22] person through fear can begin to have
[1:04:23] shaking
[1:04:25] nausea dry mouth elevated heartbeat
[1:04:28] sweating this is irregular heartbeat can
[1:04:31] be diagnosed and it can begin to have
[1:04:34] difficulty breathing physical symptoms
[1:04:37] upon the body because the thought and
[1:04:39] the fear of an image are just even the
[1:04:42] imagining that something's going to
[1:04:44] happen
[1:04:45] this I don't I'm not I'm not just saying
[1:04:47] this because I I read a Wikipedia entry
[1:04:49] there's things that I've lived where
[1:04:51] I've recognized my body is physically
[1:04:54] breaking down not because I'm sick not
[1:04:57] because there's a bully getting ready to
[1:04:58] punch me I'm doing it merely because my
[1:05:01] mind isn't solid anymore I've let my
[1:05:04] emotions get away from me I've let the
[1:05:06] things that have happened instead of me
[1:05:08] I become a little bit untethered from my
[1:05:11] faith I'm emitting it in my own weakness
[1:05:13] that I know what it's like and I'm what
[1:05:15] it is to realize today that that mindset
[1:05:19] has the power to grip us physiologically
[1:05:21] and not just mentally
[1:05:26] they begin to feel
[1:05:28] an experience all these physical you can
[1:05:32] say man you're sweating
[1:05:34] you're shaking
[1:05:36] you're breathing heavy
[1:05:38] even though there's no real danger or
[1:05:40] actual threat
[1:05:44] phobias producing physical symptoms
[1:05:49] anybody know a hypochondriac
[1:05:53] I don't know if he politically correct
[1:05:54] to say that anymore I don't know didn't
[1:05:56] look that up
[1:05:57] but it's just a simple definition as the
[1:06:00] person who's overly anxious about their
[1:06:01] health
[1:06:03] a person who's overly anxious about
[1:06:05] their health what's one of the things
[1:06:06] we've been targeting if your soul is
[1:06:08] right
[1:06:09] then our primary concern is that our
[1:06:11] hearts will be right
[1:06:12] and if we get that out of balance we
[1:06:15] become a hypochondriac
[1:06:17] hypochondria is an obsession with the
[1:06:19] idea of having serious but undiagnosed
[1:06:21] medical conditions
[1:06:24] think of this this is not this is not
[1:06:26] necessary to put this label on anybody
[1:06:28] here I would think that this is this is
[1:06:30] something very rare but we're familiar
[1:06:32] with the thought that if somebody is
[1:06:34] anxious
[1:06:35] and obsessed with this idea of having an
[1:06:37] undiagnosed medical condition
[1:06:39] it's a condition which a person is
[1:06:41] excessively and unduly worried about
[1:06:43] having a serious illness
[1:06:46] and what what a lot of the literature
[1:06:49] and the Academia focuses on when it
[1:06:51] comes to hypochondria yeah because you'd
[1:06:53] say well if a person thinks they have
[1:06:55] cancer and they don't have cancer well
[1:06:57] just let them it's your life right you
[1:07:00] can ruin your own party if you want to
[1:07:01] it just it doesn't stop there though
[1:07:05] that it's not innocent
[1:07:07] it's not harmless
[1:07:09] but they find that the ensuing worry the
[1:07:12] anxiety the obsession the depression
[1:07:15] will actually produce their own physical
[1:07:18] symptoms
[1:07:20] a hypochondriac you say oh well they're
[1:07:22] just afraid they're sick if there's
[1:07:23] nothing wrong but because of this
[1:07:26] Obsession because of this fear they
[1:07:28] actually will produce their the fear and
[1:07:30] the anxiety they hope it's making sense
[1:07:32] that in itself produces the physical
[1:07:35] symptoms that then the hypochondriac
[1:07:38] mistakes as being the symptoms the
[1:07:40] mistakes those symptoms as being the
[1:07:42] manifestation of what they're afraid of
[1:07:44] or worse yet another serious disease
[1:07:49] is there anybody here that can say Amen
[1:07:51] they've heard of that they know about
[1:07:52] that anybody who took the class in in
[1:07:54] graduate school somebody it's a very
[1:07:57] real condition that somebody is not
[1:07:59] actually sick but they are obsessed that
[1:08:02] they are and they can't ever find the
[1:08:03] problem and it's not like everything
[1:08:05] well they seem perfectly healthy no they
[1:08:08] don't seem perfectly healthy Their Fear
[1:08:11] and depression and anxiety have now
[1:08:14] produced their own physical symptoms
[1:08:16] that the hypochondriac is able to say I
[1:08:19] thought I knew I had this problem
[1:08:21] because look
[1:08:22] right I knew I had this problem because
[1:08:24] I have these symptoms or it's worse than
[1:08:27] I thought now it's spread over into this
[1:08:41] we're doing good on time
[1:08:43] in Luke chapter 21 verse 25 to 26
[1:08:46] . maybe maybe we could pick this up in
[1:08:48] Greater detail later but
[1:08:51] I want to end with some
[1:08:54] um
[1:08:55] very specific things
[1:08:57] Jesus prophesying
[1:09:00] and this this passage has various
[1:09:03] applications in the time periods that
[1:09:06] he's prophesying to he says there shall
[1:09:07] be signs in the Sun and in the moon and
[1:09:09] in the Stars and upon the Earth the
[1:09:11] stress of nations with perplexity the
[1:09:13] Sea and the waves roaring what is what I
[1:09:15] what an image
[1:09:17] then he makes a statement men's Hearts
[1:09:19] failing them for fear
[1:09:21] and for looking after those things which
[1:09:23] are coming on the earth for the powers
[1:09:24] of Heaven shall be shaken the depth of
[1:09:27] the application of Christ Christ's
[1:09:29] prophecy
[1:09:33] the depth of its application to the end
[1:09:35] time is so vast
[1:09:37] it's remarkable
[1:09:39] he says men's Hearts failure them for
[1:09:41] fear it means men expiring men dying
[1:09:48] because of fear
[1:09:50] so that's what Jesus already said Jesus
[1:09:53] is saying even before we document all
[1:09:55] these things even before science has
[1:09:57] come to the place where people are dying
[1:09:59] of diseases that aren't infectious
[1:10:03] they're dying from diseases that are at
[1:10:06] the hands of their own choosing of their
[1:10:08] own minds their own mental State men's
[1:10:10] Hearts literally stopping not because of
[1:10:13] an infectious disease but from dread and
[1:10:14] anxiety
[1:10:16] and what stood out to me and I know this
[1:10:17] may be kind of a large thing just to
[1:10:18] throw on your plate and then close but
[1:10:20] he says men's Hearts failing for fear
[1:10:23] he is looking at the the the numbers of
[1:10:26] death right
[1:10:27] he's looking at the um the death rates
[1:10:30] and he's looking at people dying and
[1:10:32] he's pointing to the fact that people
[1:10:34] will be dying because the heart is
[1:10:36] literally failing because a dread and
[1:10:38] fear and anxiety and when he does it he
[1:10:40] now points to one of the greatest risk
[1:10:43] factors of disease in the end time
[1:10:46] I don't have time maybe to run through
[1:10:48] the the numbers on it but the heart
[1:10:51] disease and the other diseases that
[1:10:53] we're faced with today they're not
[1:10:55] necessarily infectious by nature but it
[1:10:57] has more to do with our our emotions and
[1:11:01] our spirit and the stress and the
[1:11:03] anxiety
[1:11:05] and I say this just my original title
[1:11:07] today I think was going to be
[1:11:10] pills and pharmaceuticals or uh phobia
[1:11:13] and pharmaceuticals I think it was the
[1:11:14] original title and I was like no I need
[1:11:16] to deal with phobia first
[1:11:17] and I'd like to get into pills and
[1:11:19] potions and protocols and those things
[1:11:25] and when you think of and this is I
[1:11:27] think this kind of feeds into some
[1:11:29] things that we have to be very very
[1:11:30] careful about but just making an
[1:11:32] observation and I make it based upon my
[1:11:34] own research and the conclusions of
[1:11:36] other practitioners modern medicine was
[1:11:39] it became very robust and it it
[1:11:42] has evolved evolved like it did
[1:11:45] mostly around its success in fighting
[1:11:47] infectious diseases
[1:11:49] this is a com a comment from a biologist
[1:11:52] uh who's an authority in this area says
[1:11:55] infectious agents were the big source of
[1:11:56] disease and mortality up until the last
[1:11:58] century
[1:12:00] we could find out what the agent was in
[1:12:02] a sick patient and attack the agent
[1:12:04] medically
[1:12:05] that's exactly what happens with the
[1:12:08] virus and certain things or infections
[1:12:09] is they recognize this is what's causing
[1:12:12] it so we can approach this with some
[1:12:14] sort of agent that's going to address it
[1:12:16] and in a lot of ways the Health Care
[1:12:18] System began and began to grow and was
[1:12:22] it was formed in a way to treat
[1:12:24] infections which then you can approach
[1:12:27] in a certain way of how they spread
[1:12:29] right and how they're infected and how a
[1:12:33] person can infect somebody else and
[1:12:34] that's where they come up with certain
[1:12:36] things that when a person is actually
[1:12:37] infectious and based upon fever and
[1:12:39] everything and based upon diagnoses and
[1:12:41] so you can have a Whole Health Care
[1:12:42] System that's set up to address
[1:12:43] infectious diseases but now
[1:12:46] non-infectious they call it
[1:12:47] non-infectious diseases non-communicable
[1:12:49] diseases they call it and they're
[1:12:51] wanting to change that verbage and I'll
[1:12:52] mention it here in a moment that's now
[1:12:54] the most dominant
[1:12:56] heart disease cancer diabetes these
[1:13:00] things are all different from the
[1:13:01] traditional infectious diseases and an
[1:13:03] infectious disease is I I've got a virus
[1:13:06] and I and I shake hands with somebody or
[1:13:08] I cough and I and they get the same
[1:13:10] virus and it's spread from person to
[1:13:12] person by infection but if I have
[1:13:14] diabetes no matter how much sweet tea
[1:13:16] and and what's the other Diet Coke sweet
[1:13:19] tea what's the line Lucas How does it go
[1:13:21] but the kydries
[1:13:24] sweet tea diabetes is that it yeah but
[1:13:28] he writes a song and forgets the lyrics
[1:13:31] a real musician actually
[1:13:33] um
[1:13:34] that that no matter what it is if I have
[1:13:36] that no matter how long I sit next to
[1:13:38] brother Lucas with my diabetes he's not
[1:13:40] going to get infected right
[1:13:43] with it
[1:13:45] unless my lifestyle influences his
[1:13:47] lifestyle right
[1:13:48] and so there's a way that science is
[1:13:50] recognizing there's one way to treat
[1:13:52] certain kinds of sicknesses and
[1:13:53] illnesses when it's viral when it's
[1:13:55] infectious but now the most dominant are
[1:13:57] diseases that are not infectious
[1:14:01] in the traditional sense
[1:14:03] heart disease prostate cancer breast
[1:14:05] cancer diabetes obesity and other
[1:14:07] chronic diseases now account for three
[1:14:09] quarters of our health care spending
[1:14:14] and now Medics and what what's happened
[1:14:16] is medicine this is where this is I'm
[1:14:18] coming to the end now
[1:14:19] this is where we're still doing with
[1:14:20] this phobia
[1:14:22] in State of Mind and Spirit Christ my
[1:14:25] healer has a lot to do with healing our
[1:14:26] spirits and our minds
[1:14:28] there's more to this ministry but I've
[1:14:30] said than Divine Healing and what he was
[1:14:32] talking about when he says that in a
[1:14:34] number of different places he's talking
[1:14:35] about the attitudes of the people
[1:14:37] that fight and split and criticize and
[1:14:40] he says we need a healing more than just
[1:14:42] a physical healing we need spiritual
[1:14:44] healing
[1:14:46] if salvation is the greatest thing there
[1:14:48] is
[1:14:49] and he has atone for that in given us
[1:14:52] that we need to be very careful that
[1:14:54] we're not placing all of our emphasis on
[1:14:56] the physical part without first
[1:14:57] addressing the mental spiritual part
[1:15:00] and now medicine is recognizing that
[1:15:03] these chronic diseases of cardiovascular
[1:15:05] disease cancer diabetes these other
[1:15:07] things prostate breast cancer all these
[1:15:08] different diseases
[1:15:10] they're realizing that they are
[1:15:12] communicable
[1:15:14] as well but in a different way
[1:15:18] and they've looked at and I know this is
[1:15:20] maybe slowing down quite a bit here at
[1:15:21] the end
[1:15:23] but the causation of these things are
[1:15:25] linked to they call them risk behaviors
[1:15:29] such as drinking nutrition inactivity
[1:15:33] smoking and lists can go on
[1:15:36] and then the question is if these
[1:15:38] activities put me at risk of heart
[1:15:40] disease
[1:15:41] if these activities are putting me at
[1:15:43] risk for cancer if these activities are
[1:15:45] putting me at risk of obesity if these
[1:15:47] activities are putting me at risk
[1:15:49] of diabetes
[1:15:52] then what's causing the risk behavior
[1:15:54] risk behaviors
[1:15:56] what causes the smoking what causes the
[1:15:58] drinking what causes the overeating you
[1:16:01] know what they predominantly point to
[1:16:02] stress
[1:16:04] fear anxiety
[1:16:09] the very things and then and then you
[1:16:12] realize the very thing that people
[1:16:13] pursue it's the pursuit that makes them
[1:16:16] interrupt their what they want you can
[1:16:18] get so fixated on pursuing Health it's
[1:16:20] your Pursuit that's making you unhealthy
[1:16:22] you can get so fixated on pursuing
[1:16:24] happiness it's your Pursuit that makes
[1:16:25] you unhappy
[1:16:27] is it making sense
[1:16:29] these very things that have become the
[1:16:31] biggest the biggest diseases of our time
[1:16:34] are caused by the behaviors of people in
[1:16:38] what's driving their behavior is fear
[1:16:43] anxiety the wrong balance the wrong
[1:16:45] Pursuits and brother Adam in the church
[1:16:48] age book writes well now it's strange
[1:16:49] but in this age of Plenty and
[1:16:51] opportunity when everyone has so much
[1:16:53] and there's so much more to be had with
[1:16:55] all the inventions to do our work and so
[1:16:58] many things to give us pleasure suddenly
[1:17:02] yeah
[1:17:03] we find mental illness taking such a
[1:17:06] toll as to alarm the nation
[1:17:11] it's remarkable when you read and study
[1:17:13] this particular phenomena as it relates
[1:17:15] to human health and mental health they
[1:17:16] said that and this might seem to be a
[1:17:18] little bit of a paradox or
[1:17:21] um contrary to itself but they said for
[1:17:24] so many centuries man was just so
[1:17:25] concerned about surviving
[1:17:28] that he didn't have time to worry about
[1:17:30] anything I've got to make sure I get my
[1:17:31] crops planted got to make sure I harvest
[1:17:32] them got to make sure I'm not eaten by
[1:17:33] the saber-toothed tiger whatever it is
[1:17:35] that man was driven by these base needs
[1:17:37] and now that we get to this place we got
[1:17:39] so much time right
[1:17:41] that that our instincts are chain are
[1:17:43] our our instincts uh those mechanisms
[1:17:46] that we used to have that we could
[1:17:49] engage ourselves and be fruitful and do
[1:17:51] things that took care of and address
[1:17:53] certain needs and certain wants in our
[1:17:54] lives that we don't we're not doing that
[1:17:56] anymore because something else is doing
[1:17:57] it for us we farmed that out to India
[1:17:59] we're not doing it anymore and so now we
[1:18:01] have more time to fear more time to
[1:18:03] worry more times to satiate ourselves
[1:18:04] with things that feed our fear and not
[1:18:06] our faith he says suddenly we find
[1:18:08] mental illness such a toll to learn the
[1:18:11] nation
[1:18:15] taking such a toll mental illness has
[1:18:17] taken such a toll as to alarm the nation
[1:18:19] when everybody ought to be happy with
[1:18:21] really nothing to be unhappy about
[1:18:22] millions are taking sedatives at night
[1:18:24] pep pills in the morning I love the
[1:18:26] descriptive nature because it's so
[1:18:27] applicable today rushing to doctors
[1:18:29] entering institutions and trying to
[1:18:32] drown out in unknown fears by alcohol
[1:18:35] brother Bam's diagnosing what's driving
[1:18:37] the risk behaviors is fear they're
[1:18:40] taking this pill they're taking that
[1:18:42] pill they're seeking this treatment
[1:18:43] they're going to this place they're
[1:18:44] trying to find all these things they're
[1:18:46] micro dosing they're prescribing they're
[1:18:48] doing this they're doing that trying to
[1:18:49] find all sorts of ways they're trying to
[1:18:52] use whatever it is may not be a pet pill
[1:18:53] it could just be a Celsius in a can
[1:18:55] they're all trying to use certain things
[1:18:57] to get themselves going and brother
[1:18:59] Brown says and they're trying to ease
[1:19:02] anxiety
[1:19:04] trying to drown out unknown fears he
[1:19:06] says yes this age boasts of its
[1:19:08] tremendous stores of worldly Goods but
[1:19:09] the people are less happy than ever
[1:19:13] and people being less happy than ever
[1:19:16] have more
[1:19:18] more greater health problems
[1:19:22] or if I could change it this way now the
[1:19:25] predominant health problems aren't
[1:19:27] necessarily infectious diseases that you
[1:19:29] have a particular approach for but now
[1:19:31] it's a lifestyle disease
[1:19:39] I'll close with this statement in the
[1:19:41] resurrection of Jesus
[1:19:44] brother bam says if you notice
[1:19:47] if you notice it's when you're
[1:19:50] discouraged
[1:19:51] that the devil can really pour it on you
[1:19:54] I think that's good for us to remember
[1:19:58] that's when he gets you
[1:20:00] if you come to church and say well I
[1:20:01] don't know I I don't know whether I
[1:20:03] could get any better or not or
[1:20:06] I've been prayed for twice
[1:20:09] oh my
[1:20:10] you might as well go home that's all
[1:20:13] you notice that sense of it's not going
[1:20:15] to work it's not going to happen
[1:20:17] but when you can cast that aside and I
[1:20:20] just love this God don't want you to be
[1:20:22] frowning
[1:20:23] God wants you to be happy
[1:20:25] the human heart was made to be happy
[1:20:29] and we have heart diseases the number
[1:20:30] one killer what's killing a sadness
[1:20:33] grumpiness edginess stress anxiety says
[1:20:36] human heart was made to be happy worry
[1:20:38] will cause cancer temper will cause
[1:20:41] cancer don't get onto me about my equal
[1:20:44] you've been worried about the equals
[1:20:46] going to cause cancer right he says
[1:20:49] worry will cause cancer temper will
[1:20:52] cause cancer
[1:20:54] don't ever be upset
[1:20:56] just walk in his love knowing that
[1:20:59] you're walking in him and nothing can
[1:21:02] harm you there is nothing can harm you
[1:21:05] there's neither Powers things present
[1:21:07] things future nothing can separate us
[1:21:09] from him we are in him and we've never
[1:21:11] come in by our own will he by choice
[1:21:14] elected us and brought us into him so
[1:21:16] it's his business to take up what to
[1:21:19] take care of what he took himself no man
[1:21:22] can pluck them from my hands father my
[1:21:24] father's hands because he's the greatest
[1:21:25] of them all it's the father who takes
[1:21:28] care of it
[1:21:29] who's got any more power than God so
[1:21:32] what kind of power have you got over you
[1:21:34] to take care of you the whole powers
[1:21:37] that created the universe it's the very
[1:21:40] one that designed the heart it's the
[1:21:41] very one that designed the body it's the
[1:21:43] very one that designed you and placed
[1:21:45] you to be here in this hour he's saying
[1:21:47] get away from the fear
[1:21:51] because he says it's the fear the worry
[1:21:53] that causes cancer it's The Temper that
[1:21:56] causes cancer
[1:21:58] they said well I need to see a study on
[1:22:00] that
[1:22:00] I I need to see a study
[1:22:06] all they have to do
[1:22:08] is put out an article
[1:22:11] that corn flakes causes rashes
[1:22:15] and you who had Corn Flakes that day
[1:22:16] will develop a rash
[1:22:19] retract it the next day and say oops we
[1:22:20] meant Fruit Loops
[1:22:23] and by your luck you switch that morning
[1:22:27] and guess what you got another rash all
[1:22:29] because of an irrational fear
[1:22:33] all because it's seated in your mind
[1:22:36] the thoughts placed there if you could
[1:22:37] just recognize how often the devil is
[1:22:40] trying to mobilize you as believers
[1:22:44] through extreme ideas
[1:22:46] by planting a seed in your mind
[1:22:48] and when it comes down to it we can
[1:22:50] never bring it back to the word of God
[1:22:52] therefore it's become a different kind
[1:22:54] of religion
[1:22:55] and spiritual adultery
[1:22:58] against the god who's promised to care
[1:23:00] for you absolutely
[1:23:05] he says the whole powers that created
[1:23:07] the universe is the one that has power
[1:23:08] over you to take care of you he's the
[1:23:10] one that made you he's the one brother
[1:23:12] who said that made the human heart to be
[1:23:14] happy
[1:23:16] so it's important that we're healthy
[1:23:18] it's important that we're happy then
[1:23:19] let's look to God to meet our needs
[1:23:24] and let's get rid of the phobia
[1:23:27] let's address the phobia in our life
[1:23:28] let's be honest with ourselves about the
[1:23:30] things that we might actually struggle
[1:23:32] with
[1:23:33] the very things that kind of underpin
[1:23:35] are permanent our our persistent
[1:23:38] condition
[1:23:39] God wants us to be healthy if we're not
[1:23:42] healthy let's be honest about our
[1:23:44] persistent condition
[1:23:48] because God's the one who can solve it
[1:23:51] could we stand together today
