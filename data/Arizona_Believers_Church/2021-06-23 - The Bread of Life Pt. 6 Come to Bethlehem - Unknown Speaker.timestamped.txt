[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] now let's turn to Ruth chapter
[0:03] 1 we'll read verse two just jump into
[0:07] the word this evening Ruth chapter 1
[0:09] verse two glad to see all of you out to
[0:11] the house of the Lord this
[0:13] evening I trust the Lord would be your
[0:16] portion Ruth chapter 1 verse 2 and the
[0:19] name of the man was IMC and the name of
[0:22] his wife
[0:23] Naomi and the name of his two sons Mahan
[0:25] and kilan ephes of Bethlehem Judah and
[0:29] they came came into the country of Moab
[0:32] and continued there we've been on this
[0:34] verse for a few Services we're wanting
[0:36] just to again focus on that last phrase
[0:39] how this man his wife and two sons left
[0:43] Israel left Bethlehem Judah and came
[0:45] into the country of Moab and continued
[0:48] there let's bow our heads Heavenly
[0:50] Father we are grateful to be able to be
[0:53] in your presence this evening and it's
[0:55] encouraging to see one another even if
[0:57] we took time to ponder the circumstance
[1:00] is that those that are amongst us they
[1:03] that they left and even the things that
[1:05] would have hindered them it would
[1:06] encourage us even the more to understand
[1:08] the sacrifice that was in their
[1:11] obedience this evening to be in your
[1:13] house and Lord so we're refreshed and
[1:16] revived by seeing one another and
[1:17] encouraged but to feel your presence as
[1:20] we have to know that you desire to speak
[1:22] to us as we expect you to that's what
[1:24] makes this midweek service so special to
[1:26] us that we are not merely participating
[1:29] in a recreational sport this is not a
[1:32] hobby this is not a gathering of the
[1:34] flesh but this is something that means
[1:36] more than life to us as it's connected
[1:38] to things that are Eternal and
[1:40] Supernatural so we ask that you'd come
[1:42] now Lord and just break the bread of
[1:43] life to us and encourage us speak to us
[1:45] in a plain way may you have your way in
[1:48] this service Lord as we take a few
[1:50] moments to look into your word and the
[1:52] message of the hour and have it speak to
[1:54] our hearts we ask this in the name of
[1:56] the Lord Jesus Christ amen you can be
[1:59] seated
[2:02] as we've been speaking on the subject of
[2:04] the bread of life and Come to Bethlehem
[2:07] I'd like to uh try to maybe wrap up
[2:09] these first two verses as we've been
[2:11] looking at them and uh trying to draw
[2:14] out these different types and meanings
[2:16] as they would uh have relevance to us
[2:19] not merely looking at a story to try to
[2:21] figure out the different ways that we
[2:22] could type things but when brother
[2:24] brandom said there's a hidden revelation
[2:26] in the Book of Ruth that when you catch
[2:27] it it'll bring you real close to God
[2:30] and he prayed that those hearing him
[2:32] that morning when he preached uh Kinsman
[2:34] redeemers that they could uh just their
[2:36] whole heart and soul would be held
[2:39] Spellbound and uh to hear God and see
[2:42] him what he is in this story and what he
[2:44] means to us and how we can accept him
[2:47] and just those kind of uh that kind of
[2:50] statement to preface looking into the
[2:52] Book of Ruth get gets our attention we
[2:54] begin to think Lord I want to slow down
[2:56] and process uh what you are in the story
[3:00] and what you what you are to me as it's
[3:02] typed out in the story so that we can
[3:04] really gain the full benefit from it and
[3:06] I'd say our desires to draw closer to
[3:08] the Lord then in him giving us this
[3:11] Revelation or bringing out more of this
[3:13] Revelation in the Book of Ruth will help
[3:15] us to do that and just in the few
[3:17] Services we've spent on this there's
[3:19] just been many wonderful things that
[3:20] stand out uh that are relevant to us
[3:22] today because we see at the parallel in
[3:25] the type I've been looking at this
[3:27] phrase and they came into the country of
[3:29] Moab and continued there so IMC has left
[3:32] Bethlehem Judah which is the house of
[3:34] God's bread a place of blessing the
[3:37] promised land they're leaving Bethlehem
[3:39] Judah to go into Moab is a evidence of a
[3:42] rebellion and it is something that was
[3:45] foreshadowing Israel forsaking God to
[3:47] choose their own King and it was uh
[3:50] going to a place that had been cursed
[3:51] that so there was no this was not a man
[3:54] just looking out after his family but
[3:56] this was an act of rebellion instead of
[3:57] just yielding to God and repenting and
[4:00] last time and this time I'm wanting to
[4:02] just look at the characteristics of Moab
[4:04] because there's a a great uh type to us
[4:08] in that we see Ruth is the one that
[4:11] types the bride so we could look at ALC
[4:14] we could look at Naomi we could look at
[4:15] the two sons we could look at orpa and
[4:18] there's a lot of things that we could
[4:19] look at and begin to type things and
[4:21] understand certain characteristics and
[4:23] they can be signpost us or Warnings or
[4:25] there could be admonishment contained in
[4:27] it but we know that Ruth we're very
[4:29] certain that that Ruth represents the
[4:31] bride she is a gentile that is going to
[4:34] be wed to Boaz and then through her
[4:36] lineage is going to come Christ uh and
[4:38] and we know David is comes from that
[4:40] household and so this she represents the
[4:43] bride but then we're stopping and taking
[4:45] notice that she was a moabitas and she's
[4:48] called out of Moab and since she is a
[4:50] type of the Bride the fact that she's
[4:53] called out of Moab represents something
[4:55] to us today who have heard the voice of
[4:57] Revelation Revelations 18:4 come out of
[4:59] for my people that have had a message to
[5:02] turn our hearts back to the Faith of Our
[5:05] Fathers so Moab as we look at it it is a
[5:09] type and it represents what Ruth or what
[5:11] the bride is called out of and I can say
[5:14] it's part of that hidden revelation that
[5:17] God can Quicken to us and when it when
[5:18] he does it brings us closer to God we
[5:21] saw a number of statements from the
[5:23] message of the hour where brother Ram is
[5:25] identifying Moab as a type of the
[5:26] natural church and you take the things
[5:29] that he emphasizes and you look at
[5:31] things in their history we know that
[5:33] they did not have a very good beginning
[5:35] as Moab was the son of lot through lot's
[5:38] own daughter and that means the son of
[5:40] lot would be a covering a religious
[5:42] covering there was a religious attitude
[5:44] that they had so taking the teachings of
[5:46] the message of the hour we could see
[5:48] that Moab represents carnal religion and
[5:51] in a a phrase that we could even Ponder
[5:53] ourselves what it means and the
[5:55] implications of it it represents
[5:57] religion that's become political to
[5:59] where it there's it's no longer the Holy
[6:01] Spirit that's leading by the word of God
[6:03] but it becomes more of a pol a political
[6:06] uh uh setup that begins to dominate and
[6:08] Rule and govern and so Moab represents
[6:11] then if it's something if it's a carnal
[6:13] church if it's carnal religion if it's a
[6:15] church led by politics if it's a
[6:17] religion that's propped up by uh um by
[6:19] politics then we know this is a
[6:21] denominational condition Moab represents
[6:24] a denominational condition and we check
[6:27] ourselves by say no that doesn't mean we
[6:28] have to go join an actual official
[6:30] organization that doesn't mean it's just
[6:33] uh the Lutheran denomination or it
[6:35] doesn't mean it's just the Methodist
[6:36] denomination but a denominational Spirit
[6:39] can be within a a collection of churches
[6:42] that identifies independent it can
[6:44] actually exist within a particular
[6:46] Church a church that comes under
[6:48] denominational nickan Spirit or
[6:51] denominational Spirit or we could be a
[6:53] denomination to ourselves it's an
[6:55] ideology it's some way of thinking it's
[6:57] some way of acting and traditionally
[6:59] trying to ser of God where we do it more
[7:00] by denomination and the attributes of
[7:03] denomination than we do by the spirit of
[7:05] God and his word and brother brandom
[7:07] identifies this particular aspect of
[7:09] Moab quite often how fundamental they
[7:12] were a and and this is this is expressed
[7:15] in how balum offered worship and how he
[7:18] presented himself and so in in this his
[7:20] brother bam emphasizes it over and over
[7:23] again Moab represents kind of religious
[7:25] fundamentalism or just a fundamental way
[7:27] of serving God and in certain things
[7:29] foundationally can be in place and and
[7:32] it can be even uh strictly correct
[7:35] according to the letter of the word so
[7:37] there's this is what Moab represents and
[7:40] he identifies it as a system of
[7:42] organization that Moab is organized and
[7:45] they had a system of organization he
[7:46] identifies their politics and how they
[7:48] they were motivated by politics and and
[7:52] he he uses the phrases and and I know
[7:54] I'm summarizing and if you were here
[7:56] last time you're able just to pick up
[7:57] right on it I know that you listen to
[7:59] the word of God and you hear the voice
[8:00] of the of the Prophet so you know these
[8:03] things that he taught but he identifies
[8:05] how that Moab impersonates a form of God
[8:08] impersonates a form of the word of God
[8:10] and it does it through politics and he
[8:12] uses the phrase some kind of system now
[8:15] if you're wondering well brother Aaron
[8:17] it's not a political season the
[8:19] elections already happened after Trump
[8:21] got voted out I've burned all my
[8:22] political Flags I'm never voting again
[8:24] it's all rigged and it's a fraud I'm not
[8:26] talking about those kind of
[8:28] politics and and and before you think
[8:30] wow we're just not an organization I I
[8:32] really want you to challenge challenge
[8:35] yourself to be more Discerning about the
[8:37] elements of organization and the
[8:39] elements of system and how they can work
[8:41] on us to keep us from fully walking into
[8:44] the word of God because that's what
[8:46] we're going to identify about more about
[8:47] Moab this evening is how where where
[8:49] they met Israel in the journey is very
[8:51] striking and what they did to try to
[8:54] keep Israel from Crossing into the
[8:55] promised land is very enlightening
[8:58] because then we could say Lord give me
[8:59] wisdom to identify anything that may be
[9:02] of a moabi is nature in my life that
[9:05] would try to keep me from walking fully
[9:06] in the promise of
[9:08] God and it's systems that do it and this
[9:11] statement has been a lot to me now over
[9:13] the last few years and uh I actually had
[9:16] thought I'd maybe used it a few times
[9:17] already here at our church and uh I went
[9:20] back and tried to find where I've used
[9:22] it I don't know if I've even had the
[9:23] opportunity really to use this uh uh
[9:25] here but and I found I think only one
[9:27] other place I even used it recently but
[9:29] it's one that I've constantly kept
[9:31] before me because it's very instructive
[9:33] brother rman in the sermon the world has
[9:35] fallen apart he says the whole systems
[9:37] are falling apart something wrong so the
[9:40] systems of this world the political
[9:41] systems the the the the ideologies and
[9:44] the structures are all falling apart he
[9:46] says we want to seriously think of this
[9:48] for the next few minutes don't just
[9:50] enter this now just say well we walked
[9:52] over here sat down we had breakfast we
[9:53] heard testimonies and so forth as it was
[9:55] being done in a breakfast setting he's
[9:57] said we ought to be more serious about
[9:59] this and not casual but let's with all
[10:02] our hearts get down to this and think of
[10:04] it remember it's our life and there's
[10:07] nothing no more important than our life
[10:10] there's nothing no more important no
[10:11] matter how much we gain in the world or
[10:13] how great we become here we've got to be
[10:15] we've got to come to the end of the road
[10:18] that's a telling time and we must
[10:19] approach it with all the sincerity we
[10:21] know how to do so this is him prefacing
[10:25] what he's about to say to sober the
[10:26] people up a little bit say what I'm
[10:27] about to tell you just isn't my take on
[10:29] worldly systems but it relates to your
[10:32] own life relates to your your thriving
[10:35] in the word of God when people in the
[10:37] other times when people tried to find
[10:39] some way of survival and they went to
[10:42] systems so he's identifying how World
[10:45] Systems are falling apart there's
[10:46] something wrong and he's saying that
[10:48] these systems that men adapt or adopt or
[10:51] put into place they are things that they
[10:53] do to survive it's a way of keeping a
[10:56] organizations to survive it's a way to
[10:58] keep ideology alive it's a way to keep
[11:00] uh um some structure if you want it to
[11:02] survive you want it to exist and subsist
[11:05] and keep going on there's got to be a
[11:06] system that that's put into place in
[11:08] order to Pro protect and PR preserve so
[11:11] he says when they've tried to do this
[11:12] they've tried to survive they go to
[11:14] systems and the only way that they can
[11:17] go to any other system than the way that
[11:19] God has laid down is to get away from
[11:21] his word
[11:39] good thing we're all vaccinated
[11:41] right excuse
[11:44] me so it says the only way they can get
[11:47] to any other system than the way that
[11:49] God has laid down is to get away from
[11:51] his word men in other ages have done
[11:54] this now notice that because I I want to
[11:56] come back to that in the end if you if
[11:58] you're going to go into some system
[12:00] other than the one that God has provided
[12:02] because we read last time where abam was
[12:04] talking about systems he says well God
[12:05] has a system so it's not maybe system in
[12:08] itself that's wrong but if it's man-made
[12:10] we don't want it he says but if you're
[12:12] going to get to something that's away
[12:14] from his word or that God hasn't laid
[12:16] down then you're getting away from his
[12:17] word so says men in other ages have done
[12:20] this in times past they all tried to get
[12:22] away and tried to control the world so
[12:26] it's a matter of
[12:27] control it's a matter of um exerting
[12:30] influence and then deriving the benefit
[12:32] from that control and influence and make
[12:34] a system of politics in different things
[12:37] to try to control and hold the world
[12:40] together this is what man does this is
[12:42] his his weak his weakness that when he
[12:44] wants to control something he's got to
[12:46] implement a system of politics in
[12:48] different ways to control and hold the
[12:50] things together and they in order to do
[12:52] that they get away from God's plan of
[12:54] doing
[12:55] it God has a better way of holding
[12:57] things together than man does God has a
[13:00] better way of sustaining things than man
[13:02] does we recognize the tendency of man to
[13:05] even re see that God has done something
[13:07] and God has revealed something and
[13:08] brother B identifies it in the church
[13:10] age book where they begin to whisper how
[13:12] can we protect this great truth we need
[13:14] to organize we need to set up a system
[13:16] we need to be able to protect this from
[13:18] being translated the wrong way or people
[13:20] coming in and changing it or people
[13:21] prizing our people and and and moving
[13:24] them the way there's got to we got to
[13:26] control this and brother saying this is
[13:28] man's tendency but God has a way of
[13:30] controlling
[13:32] things he says God has a way of keeping
[13:35] this thing
[13:36] together that's what we should trust in
[13:39] God has a way of keeping this thing
[13:41] together and the only way that men can
[13:42] ever adopt some other way he has to get
[13:45] away from the original way so God has an
[13:48] original way God has his own system God
[13:50] has his word that he's laid down God has
[13:52] his pattern his system his structure his
[13:55] means of control his means of keeping
[13:57] things in order he has a way of keeping
[14:00] this together and if you adopt some
[14:02] other way and get away from his original
[14:04] way you haven't created a system where
[14:06] the individual believer can Thrive
[14:08] within it but the system can Thrive the
[14:11] system can develop very very robustly
[14:14] and seem to be a well-oiled machine and
[14:16] accomplishing many great things but if
[14:18] you get away from the established way in
[14:20] God's original way all you're doing is
[14:23] surviving as a church we don't want to
[14:25] survive as a church we actually want
[14:27] individuals to thrive I really that's
[14:29] the mark of a church that's uh thriving
[14:31] a church that's growing a church that's
[14:33] benefiting from the word of God is when
[14:35] individuals and families are actually
[14:37] growing in the grace of God and they're
[14:39] and they're they're increasing in wisdom
[14:41] the families are not the church we don't
[14:44] want a church to to grow at the expense
[14:45] of the families thank you someone's
[14:47] provided me with the cough drop I
[14:49] apologize for annoying this person to
[14:51] the point to where they dug into their
[14:53] own personal stash of cough drops and
[14:58] says Lord help this
[14:59] help this young man to make it through
[15:03] service appreciate that thank you so now
[15:08] Moab was very fundamentally established
[15:11] and I'm wanting to take this statement
[15:13] of brother Bram how he's talking about
[15:14] manmade Survival Systems and kind of
[15:17] look at this in terms of Mo the moabites
[15:20] because brother random identifies their
[15:21] structure their organization their
[15:23] systems and we were ending last time and
[15:25] talking about how it gave them this uh
[15:27] that lifted them up it gave this sense
[15:30] that they were greater than everyone
[15:31] else I would say it certainly gave them
[15:32] a false sense of security but they were
[15:34] really really lifted up in how well
[15:37] organized they were and how well
[15:38] established they were and even how long
[15:40] they'd been there they might they might
[15:42] have even thought about Israel and said
[15:43] hey you left we stayed we've been here
[15:47] longer H H and so we're we're better off
[15:49] than you are and so they were definitely
[15:51] lifted up in their structure and brother
[15:53] says that Moab looked down on Israel the
[15:56] moabites when they heard about Israel
[15:58] coming through and they even as they
[16:00] heard about their testimonies they had a
[16:01] way of explaining it away and they they
[16:03] didn't believe this and they didn't
[16:04] believe that they looked down on Israel
[16:07] and a statement we ended with last time
[16:09] is brother was talking about how the
[16:10] Queen of Sheba Could Teach the
[16:11] Pentecostals saying you support things
[16:13] out there that laugh and make fun of
[16:15] Divine Healing and yet you support the
[16:17] radio programs instead of your own
[16:19] church that's right and laugh and make
[16:21] fun of the very things you believe in so
[16:24] it ought to shake us to think Lord I
[16:26] want to be sure that my support is in
[16:28] the right thing that my my efforts and
[16:30] my resources and my time and my prayers
[16:33] a and what I give myself over to and
[16:36] even in our giving he's saying that we
[16:38] we want to support the things we know
[16:40] will support God's program support the
[16:42] things that God's wanting to accomplish
[16:45] I feel like those things kind of help uh
[16:46] bring us back to where we were uh last
[16:49] Wednesday night when we ended now if you
[16:51] turn to Numbers chapter
[16:53] 22 with me I'd like
[16:56] to I'd like just to take this as a
[16:59] starting point to look into some of
[17:00] these other aspects of
[17:03] Moab numbers CH 22:1 it says and the
[17:06] children of Israel set forward and
[17:09] pitched in the plains of Moab on this
[17:12] side Jordan by Jericho as you you look
[17:15] at this place where they pitched their
[17:17] tents it was in the plains of Moab and
[17:19] it's saying just on the other side of
[17:21] Jericho uh next to Jericho but on the
[17:23] other side of the Jordan River from it
[17:26] and this area that they settled in it
[17:27] was land that one time belonged to Moab
[17:31] it was land that Moab at one time
[17:32] possessed as their own H but they had
[17:35] lost it and now when Israel comes they
[17:37] take this land from the amorites so it's
[17:40] very interesting I pondered this today
[17:43] how that Mo Israel shows up and they
[17:45] take land back that the moabites had
[17:48] lost and I'm sure that that might have
[17:50] been some offense to them because at one
[17:51] time well we believe this and we held
[17:53] this and we had that and then Israel
[17:55] comes along and kicks out this King H
[17:57] and they take over this land land that
[17:59] that rightfully at one time belonged to
[18:01] the moabites and now that's where Israel
[18:03] is and and I actually realizing now that
[18:06] I forgot to include the slide that would
[18:08] have showed just this ex exact spot
[18:10] where they were but they were at the
[18:12] closest point to the promised land that
[18:15] they had been in this whole
[18:16] Exodus they were 5 to seven miles from
[18:19] Jericho so they're right there the
[18:21] Jordan Rivers before them they're going
[18:23] to cross the Jordan River they're going
[18:24] to go in and Conquer Jericho uh once we
[18:26] get into the Book of Joshua these events
[18:28] are very near as we're in Numbers
[18:30] chapter 22 and there's a few chapters
[18:32] that deal with some issues that take
[18:34] place right there within the next few
[18:35] months and then we're going to see that
[18:37] it's this in this place where Moses dies
[18:39] and it's where there's a change of
[18:41] leadership there's actually a change of
[18:42] leadership where now Joshua which is the
[18:44] type of the holy spirit is going to take
[18:46] those who'd followed the prophet all the
[18:48] way up to the door of this change to the
[18:50] door of crossing over the Jordan Moses
[18:52] goes off the scene but there's still a
[18:54] fulfillment of the message that Moses
[18:56] brought and it's the Holy Spirit Joshua
[18:58] that's going to take the children of
[19:00] Israel across the Jordan River into the
[19:02] promised land and so this is they're 5
[19:05] to S miles from Jericho these are the
[19:07] events that are going to take place
[19:08] before them and notice how brother bham
[19:11] makes lays it out this way and we use
[19:13] this a larger portion of a statement
[19:16] from God does God change his mind last
[19:18] time and we're just going to pick up on
[19:20] a couple sentences left or two sentences
[19:23] that opened up that statement last time
[19:25] he says Israel of the Old Testament is
[19:27] the type of the Bride of the New
[19:28] Testament
[19:29] and and he's looking at this journey of
[19:32] Israel out of Egypt and the challenges
[19:34] that they faced in the Exodus coming up
[19:36] out of the world marching on the road to
[19:38] Canaan he says or the Canaan that we go
[19:41] to the
[19:42] Millennium now there's no question that
[19:45] we can type the promised land as the
[19:47] baptism of goes that there was Wars and
[19:49] there was fightings and there was
[19:50] killings and how that when we've
[19:52] received the baptism Holy Ghost there's
[19:53] still a positional placing within the
[19:55] promised land of the individual believer
[19:58] and the church in type as a whole but
[20:00] here brother mam is you wanting us to
[20:02] look at it this way that there's a type
[20:04] of the church in The Exodus of Israel
[20:07] out of Egypt in the wilderness into
[20:09] Canaan he says or the Millennium he says
[20:12] now we notice Moab here is a type of the
[20:15] church and in and the way he places it
[20:18] you have to stay within the confines of
[20:20] this type that he's trying to dry trying
[20:22] to draw up Israel come and settles right
[20:25] there in the land of the moabites right
[20:26] there within their borders so to speak
[20:29] or right there next to him but between
[20:31] Moab and the Jordan River and just
[20:33] beyond it is what bram's typing as the
[20:34] Millennium he says Moab is the type of
[20:37] the church so you have Moab right there
[20:39] where Israel is right before they're
[20:41] going to cross over into the promised
[20:43] land and so here we are the bride right
[20:46] next to
[20:47] Moab in this type of this in the type of
[20:50] the uh the bride coming up out of Egypt
[20:53] entered the promised land bams want us
[20:55] to think about Moab as the type of the
[20:57] church
[20:59] now in Numbers Chapter
[21:01] 13 and I I want to take a step back for
[21:03] a moment just to kind of preface where
[21:05] we are in Numbers chapter 22 in Numbers
[21:07] Chapter 13 12 Spies have gone out into
[21:10] the uh into the promised land their 40
[21:13] days they're in there Gathering the
[21:14] evidence they come back they at caders
[21:16] Baria they tell they tell the people of
[21:18] Israel hey it's just exactly like God
[21:20] said it was but so God was right about
[21:23] the fact that it's a land flowing with
[21:24] milk and honey but he was wrong about
[21:26] the fact that we could take it and he
[21:28] makes and they make that uh that stand
[21:30] there and because they make that stand
[21:33] they wander in the wilderness for 40
[21:35] years 38 years about the time that we
[21:38] come to this place here Numbers chapter
[21:39] 22 it had been 38 years that they had
[21:42] been wandering in the wilderness and
[21:44] wandering in the desert why because they
[21:46] rejected God at Cades barnea terrible
[21:48] mistake that they had made they had made
[21:50] this awful mistake there at Cades barnea
[21:53] and so this challenge that's facing
[21:55] Israel at this juncture in The Exodus is
[21:58] a type of where we are now you can see
[22:01] this and brother Mam's going to identify
[22:03] this here in a moment and God
[22:04] identifying himself by his
[22:05] characteristics so I want you to think
[22:07] the challenge that Israel faced with
[22:09] Moab being a type of the church and with
[22:12] Jericho or the promised land just being
[22:14] there beyond the Jordan River it's a
[22:15] type of where we are as the bride today
[22:19] brother says and God identifying himself
[22:21] by his characteristics he says now up
[22:24] there I want you to notice these two
[22:25] nations in contrast here was is Israel
[22:30] and and I have it there in Brackets
[22:31] because I believe he says Egypt but he
[22:33] we know that he's referring to Israel a
[22:36] little scattered about no Nation to go
[22:38] to no Executives or no king or nothing
[22:41] or any dignitaries among them just a
[22:43] people on their road to a Promised Land
[22:46] This is the bride now he say look at
[22:48] them a little scattered about no Nation
[22:50] to go to no Executives or King nothing
[22:52] no dignitaries among them brother Braham
[22:53] said Moab had celebrities they had their
[22:55] Fighters they had their kings but here's
[22:57] just the people on their road to a
[22:59] promised land and they had to go through
[23:01] the land of Moab it was right in the
[23:04] line of Promise so in order to get to
[23:06] where they were going they were going to
[23:08] have to go through
[23:09] Moab now he says in paragraph 47 two
[23:12] Nations at contrast a very perfect
[23:15] example of the day we are living if we
[23:18] had time to go into it notice God doing
[23:21] this in Parable that we find out
[23:24] paralleling so this is Brother Bram
[23:26] saying that where Israel came to where
[23:28] you had Israel as a nation which is a
[23:30] typee of the Bride you had Moab as a
[23:32] nation which is a type of a church and
[23:34] he says it's a perfect example of the
[23:35] day that we're living in and he says if
[23:38] he had time to go into it oh he's saying
[23:40] we have more time to go into this we
[23:41] could go into more detail and we have
[23:43] time to go into it we have time to take
[23:46] the things that brother brandham said as
[23:47] brother Bram says God condenses his
[23:49] truths as brother brandham said that I'm
[23:51] just hitting the highlights then this is
[23:54] what brother Ram did he hit the
[23:55] highlights he con God condensed his
[23:57] truths and then we can as men of God
[24:00] take these truths that brother Brandon
[24:02] preached and unpack them if you hit the
[24:05] highlights we can go in and we can get
[24:07] into the details and the and and all the
[24:09] points that brother Bron was referring
[24:11] to when he hit the high points he says
[24:13] this is the very perfect example of the
[24:15] day we're living in notice God doing
[24:17] this in parallel we find out or Parable
[24:19] paralleling so this is a parallel for us
[24:23] I want you to take it that way that this
[24:24] is that Israel at this juncture
[24:27] represents the Bri of Christ Moab
[24:29] represents the church and so Moab
[24:32] becomes part of Israel's last
[24:34] hurdle in everything that they've been
[24:36] through getting out of Egypt and all the
[24:38] mighty Wonders that God did in getting
[24:39] them out of Egypt and that maybe it
[24:41] culminated in them getting to cross the
[24:43] Red Sea and then they enter into the the
[24:45] Wilderness and God sends them mana and
[24:48] God sends them quail and God identifies
[24:50] himself in a pillar of fire and a cloud
[24:52] and God is evidently with them and it
[24:55] says that none of their shoes wore out
[24:57] and God fed them and sustained them and
[24:59] they go over into the uh in the promised
[25:02] land they come back with the evidence of
[25:04] the fruits there's a lot of things
[25:05] that's been taking place they reject God
[25:07] at cadis Baria that generation that
[25:09] rejected them have to die out 38 years
[25:11] later now they find themselves just at
[25:13] the doorstep as it says on this side
[25:16] Jordan by Jericho and they still have
[25:18] another
[25:19] challenge they still have another hurdle
[25:21] to be to get over before crossing the
[25:24] Jordan and I'm going to be able to just
[25:26] use some real summary language in in
[25:28] this because I know that you've heard
[25:30] these things in great detail but it's
[25:33] here that Moab tries to tempt
[25:36] Israel and in doing so they're wanting
[25:39] the attempt is to cause her to fall and
[25:42] if she can fall then she fails to follow
[25:44] all the word of
[25:46] God they there was a there was an effort
[25:49] to stop her from entering into the
[25:51] promised land and we know that balam was
[25:54] a prophet uh in Moab and he was a
[25:57] prophet which is
[25:58] uh Bao reaches out to and we'll go into
[26:00] just a little bit of the detail on
[26:02] that but uh and how many of you familiar
[26:05] with balum and the in the scripture
[26:07] maybe if you're not sure quite sure who
[26:09] balum is he's the one whose donkey
[26:11] talked to him and so immediately we all
[26:13] oh that guy uh but and I'm just going to
[26:16] use this as summary and get into a
[26:17] little bit more detail balum was paid to
[26:20] curse
[26:21] Israel but what happened every time he
[26:24] went to curse him he blessed him there
[26:26] actually Baum that we quoted a coule
[26:28] coup Services ago where he actually
[26:29] cursed Moab that go there's going to be
[26:32] a scepter come out of Jacob and he's
[26:33] going to rule and Reign and righteous
[26:34] going to Smite the corners of Moab and
[26:36] this is coming from balb who is hired by
[26:38] the king of Moab to curse Israel but
[26:41] when he opens his mouth he can't curse
[26:43] him I the blessings come forward and
[26:46] because he can't curse them by prophecy
[26:49] because he can't bring a word of God
[26:51] against them because Israel's right in
[26:52] line with the word of God because he
[26:55] can't curse them directly he tries a
[26:57] more subtle tactic to stumble Israel so
[27:01] remember brother Bram said this types
[27:03] exactly where we're living today he says
[27:05] a perfect example the day we're living
[27:08] in here's the parallel so there's a
[27:11] parallel to us how Satan is going to try
[27:13] to get a little bit more clever and the
[27:16] tactics of the moabites are going to be
[27:17] a little bit less direct because they
[27:20] can't use the word of God to curse
[27:23] you so what are they going to have to do
[27:25] something a little bit more
[27:27] indirect and brother bradam goes into
[27:29] detail in this and you could certainly
[27:31] kind of take it from the scripture as
[27:33] you get into the book of uh Joshua you
[27:35] find that there was H that the report of
[27:39] Israel had gone ahead of them and there
[27:41] were those in Jericho who had heard
[27:43] about the mighty works that God was
[27:45] doing in Israel so God was identifying
[27:47] himself with Israel their Mighty Works
[27:49] were being shown they had just kicked
[27:51] out this king of the ammonites where in
[27:53] this land that had been taken away from
[27:54] the moabites so God was identifying
[27:57] himself with Israel and Israel
[27:58] approached BAC was terrified of her it
[28:02] wasn't like oh isn't this neat our long
[28:05] lost little sisters come back home and
[28:07] how can we provide for you and these are
[28:09] well-watered planes and we can give you
[28:11] cattle and do you need a do you need
[28:12] someone to look after your your sheep
[28:14] for you can we re refresh you in any way
[28:17] no there was uh there was no uh there
[28:20] this was there was not a welcome party
[28:22] for Israel as brother Bram uh puts it
[28:26] this way he refers to how and I know in
[28:29] Judges chapter 13 the scripture talks
[28:31] about how they sent emissaries forward
[28:33] and asked the king of Edom can we have
[28:35] passage and they asked about the mobites
[28:37] can you let us through can we pass
[28:39] through and they refused it we don't
[28:41] want to give you any food we don't want
[28:42] to give you safe passage we don't want
[28:43] to help you brother mam says it was too
[28:45] risky are you listening all right wake
[28:48] up your neighbor if you're up in the
[28:50] front row I'll wake you up my if you
[28:52] don't have someone next to you I'll wake
[28:53] you up he says it was too risky as he
[28:56] might lose some of his crowd
[28:59] this is moab's way of thinking this is a
[29:02] moabi approach to this situation is well
[29:05] I don't want to help it all because if I
[29:07] do what if some people follow him what
[29:09] if some people don't want to live in
[29:10] Moab anymore and they end up going to
[29:12] the promised land and so this is the
[29:14] attitude and the mindset for Bayo Bao is
[29:17] afraid it be too risky to be neutral be
[29:19] too risky to show support he might lose
[29:22] some of his crowd so Bayo hires balum to
[29:24] curse
[29:26] Israel so what is this Spirit now that's
[29:28] on the king of Moab what's the spirit
[29:30] that's even o on balam what's the spirit
[29:33] that's on Moab it'll always fight
[29:35] against the elect it's the spirit of the
[29:37] natural church it's the spirit of
[29:38] politics it's the spirit of of of of a
[29:41] carnal religion that actually resist and
[29:43] fights against the elect of God now
[29:47] before you start trying to think outside
[29:49] yourself start thinking about how you
[29:50] will wrestle within yourself to be more
[29:52] political to to to to be more pleasing
[29:55] to other people to kind of fit a
[29:56] particular IDE ology to look a certain
[29:59] way to live a certain way and to fit in
[30:01] a certain way and you have a political
[30:03] bone inside of you that wants to do it
[30:05] one way but you got a soul inside of you
[30:07] says no you got to die out you got to go
[30:09] all in you got to serve God the right
[30:10] way you've got to do it the right way
[30:12] and you can't
[30:13] compromise and we have a flesh which is
[30:15] a moabitas flesh that wants to cause us
[30:17] to compromise and that's where we start
[30:19] and examine ourselves how that we have a
[30:22] mechanism within ourselves that's afraid
[30:24] to give all of ourselves to God because
[30:26] it's too risky amen that that's what
[30:29] we're looking at we're not think we're
[30:30] not thinking outside of ourselves
[30:32] tonight we're thinking about ourselves
[30:34] even thinking about us as a church that
[30:36] we should never be afraid to follow
[30:38] God's word and support the right thing
[30:41] because oh we're afraid that we'll lose
[30:42] part of the
[30:46] crowd says he might lose some of his
[30:48] crowd it was too risky well this could
[30:50] we don't ever want a church to begin to
[30:52] compromise so we can make the crowd
[30:53] bigger and not lose anyone and then
[30:55] within ourselves as we're examining
[30:57] ourselves
[30:58] it's a spirit that fights against this
[31:00] elect seed on the inside of us now I
[31:02] want to look at three scriptures fairly
[31:04] quickly that refer to balum in the New
[31:07] Testament and and I'm wanting just to I
[31:10] I felt that at the very least if we
[31:11] don't amplify them very much tonight at
[31:13] the very least it's identifying how that
[31:16] the spirit that existed in Moab
[31:19] expressed in the relationship between
[31:20] bik and balum and how balum set out to
[31:23] curse Israel and ultimately tried to
[31:25] stumble her that the writers in the new
[31:27] test identified this as still a spirit
[31:31] that fights against the church and
[31:33] brother bam says this is a perfect
[31:34] example where we are today paralleling
[31:37] well the writers in the New Testament
[31:38] second Peter chapter 2:15 Peter is
[31:41] identifying this way of B saying it
[31:43] exists today it exists within the church
[31:46] he says which have forsaken the right
[31:47] way and are gone astray and I know I'm
[31:49] kind of chopping off some of the thought
[31:51] here but these are those Who Fallen away
[31:53] from the faith and have forsaken the
[31:54] truth following the way of balum the son
[31:57] of basor who love the wages of
[32:01] unrighteousness the way of balam the son
[32:03] of and the word that's used there is the
[32:04] son of
[32:05] carnality balam was carnal in his
[32:08] approach and they followed the way of
[32:10] balam who loved the phrase here is
[32:13] important to note the wages of
[32:15] unrighteousness the benefit or the
[32:17] reward that he would get from doing what
[32:20] he knew is against God's
[32:22] word so it's called the way of balum
[32:25] it's it's a way of thinking a way of
[32:28] acting it's a particular influence the
[32:30] wrong kind of influence wrong kind of
[32:32] carnal thinking it's a son of carnality
[32:34] we don't even have to related it to
[32:36] demon possession it's just a carnal way
[32:38] of enjoying what the wrong thing can
[32:41] bring us instead of the sacrifice of
[32:43] doing the right
[32:44] thing following the way of balam then in
[32:46] Jude 11 woe unto them for they have gone
[32:49] in the way of Cain and ran greedily
[32:52] after the heir of balam for reward and
[32:55] perished in the gainsaying of Kora quite
[32:58] a mouthful that Jude uses he has the way
[33:00] of Cain the gaining of Kora and then in
[33:02] between those being the bread this is
[33:05] the meat of his rebuke sandwich they ran
[33:07] greedily after the heir of balum for
[33:10] reward what is it referring to a
[33:13] covetousness he coveted after he ran
[33:15] greeted he coveted something he coveted
[33:17] a position he coveted power B coveted
[33:20] the crowd uh The Prestige the politics
[33:23] all the things that kind of tickle the
[33:25] ear a and suit someone's fancy and
[33:28] floats their boat and oh this is what
[33:30] makes me feel good this is what will
[33:31] make us look good it's catering to the
[33:33] wrong
[33:34] thing and so here's Peter Jude they're
[33:37] identifying a spirit in a way of
[33:40] thinking in a way of acting in a way of
[33:42] existing within the economy of God or
[33:44] against the economy of God within the
[33:46] Christian
[33:47] church so brother bam says that it's a a
[33:50] paralleling and it's a perfect example
[33:53] of the day we're living in this is this
[33:55] has been a type that's been used since
[33:58] the beginning of the
[33:59] church now in Revelations chap
[34:02] 2:14 as a rebuke is being is given to
[34:06] the church in Revelations chapter
[34:09] 2 and it's in the uh the rebuke of the
[34:14] pergamus church and you'll find that
[34:16] it's in the pergami and church age that
[34:18] brother banam Church age book chapter
[34:20] five of the church age book where
[34:22] brother B really amplifies I'd actually
[34:24] encourage you to go it's around Pages
[34:26] 205 or so for a few pages brother just
[34:29] goes detailed into this story it's where
[34:31] he says it was too risky he might lose
[34:33] some of his crowd go into great detail
[34:35] about this attitude of balum and bik and
[34:38] so here's Christ now speaking to the
[34:41] church at pergamus but I have a few
[34:43] things against thee because thou Hast
[34:45] there them that hold the doctrine of
[34:48] balum so it has been identified as the
[34:50] way of balum the heir of balum now it's
[34:52] the doctrine of balum and the scripture
[34:54] itself speaks to it this way who taught
[34:57] B to cast a stumbling block before the
[35:00] children of Israel to eat things
[35:02] sacrificed un idols and to commit
[35:05] fornication so this is the doctrine of
[35:07] bam the way of bam the error of balam
[35:09] manifested it in this Dynamic that he
[35:12] taught Balo
[35:14] something and what he taught Bao to do
[35:17] was to cause Israel to stumble to cast a
[35:20] stumbling block in front of Israel
[35:22] unable to use the word of God against
[35:25] Israel directly by saying the word of
[35:27] God says this and God curses you and a
[35:30] and to try to cause confusion about the
[35:32] word of God unable to do that he caused
[35:34] them to stumble against the word of God
[35:37] and force God to deal with Israel by the
[35:40] word so instead of causing them
[35:42] confusion on the word or actually
[35:44] causing them to be cursed by the word he
[35:46] wants to actually put a stumbling block
[35:48] before them to cause the word to deal
[35:50] with them so balum taught Balo to cast a
[35:54] stumbling block before the children of
[35:56] Israel in numbers Chap
[36:00] 31:16 and I I really I really appreciate
[36:03] the presence that's being U established
[36:05] here this evening through your
[36:07] attentiveness I I I just really like
[36:09] this because there's a there's a
[36:11] patience on my part just to just to lay
[36:13] these things out there uh though they
[36:16] might not be expounded upon in great
[36:18] detail or it may not be in a dynamic
[36:21] manner these things are kind of being
[36:22] set before
[36:23] you now in numbers 31:16 this is going
[36:27] to give us a little bit more insight
[36:30] into the doctrine of balam who taught
[36:32] Bao to cast a stumbling block before CH
[36:34] before the children of Israel this is
[36:36] Moses speaking behold these caused the
[36:38] children of Israel through the Council
[36:41] of balum to commit trespass against the
[36:44] Lord in the matter of peor we know about
[36:46] the Feast of B
[36:48] peor and so it these and he's referring
[36:50] to these and we'll see them in the
[36:52] scripture here in a moment he calls the
[36:55] children of Israel through the Council
[36:56] of balam
[36:58] so the Bible's telling us that balum not
[37:02] able to curse them by the word of
[37:04] God counsels bailo Bao and tells them
[37:07] well this is what you can do to hinder
[37:09] it this is what you can do to stumble
[37:11] this is what you might be able to do to
[37:12] bring a reproach so he counseled the
[37:15] counsel of balam which would be the heir
[37:17] of balam the way of balam the doctor of
[37:18] balam to commit trespass against the
[37:20] Lord in the matter pure and there was a
[37:23] plague among the congregation of the
[37:24] Lord God sent a plague up upon Israel
[37:28] because they actually fell through this
[37:31] scheme in the Council of balum they were
[37:33] caused to commit trespass and a plague
[37:35] fell upon Israel and 24,000 people were
[37:37] killed so it's a very terrible time
[37:40] terrible day for Israel and so Moses
[37:43] reveals that balum counseled the
[37:45] midianites that's who these word he says
[37:47] it caused the these caused the children
[37:49] of Israel was actually the midianites
[37:51] that he had counseled the m minites to
[37:53] cause Israel to sin think about that
[37:58] Moab isn't
[38:00] innocent got to be more on your toes
[38:02] than you've ever been before so bam is
[38:04] I've been saying it over and over again
[38:06] powerless to curse Israel directly he's
[38:08] power hungry balam had been hired by bik
[38:12] uh to curse and so he wanted that check
[38:15] he wanted his paycheck he wanted to get
[38:17] what he was do by doing it so he was
[38:19] desperate and he was desperate he was
[38:21] hungry for recognition he was hungry for
[38:23] power and so balam was motivated son of
[38:26] carnality motivated for all the wrong
[38:27] reasons ran greedily HHH after the heir
[38:31] of balam for reward it is something that
[38:33] he was driven by driven by the crowd
[38:35] driven by pretense driven by power
[38:38] driven by
[38:39] politics and my you can get into this
[38:41] and you'll find that in the language
[38:43] that brother brandham uses and even in
[38:45] the very and I'm trying to stay away
[38:46] from the details of the story so that we
[38:49] don't get caught up in it I'm just
[38:51] wanting to use Moab as a type of what
[38:52] Ruth is called out of so without getting
[38:55] into too much of the detail of The
[38:56] Exodus which is not necessarily what
[38:58] we're typing and the specific details in
[39:00] those days in what Ruth has got to
[39:02] overcome she's got to overcome a land
[39:04] and a country that was known for was
[39:07] established in political
[39:10] pandering known for being power hungry
[39:13] known for being carnal and and he used
[39:16] what balam did is used Temptation and he
[39:18] used deceit to accomplish his objective
[39:21] when the word couldn't do
[39:22] it bam go and prophesy from God on
[39:25] behalf of God and curse the children of
[39:27] is the word's not going to curse the
[39:28] elect so what does it what does what
[39:30] does devil have the devil have to use
[39:32] deceit he has to use deceit to
[39:35] accomplish his
[39:36] objective and this is going to be seen
[39:38] in Numbers chapter 25 so we looked at
[39:40] Revelations 2 which tells us about the
[39:42] teaching B the doctr of bam that taught
[39:45] Bao then we see in numbers 31 how the
[39:47] counsel of balam was given now this is
[39:50] what we this is how where it actually
[39:52] happened in Numbers 22 they had come to
[39:54] the plains of Moab on the side Jordan by
[39:56] Jericho now this begins to happen after
[39:59] balum can't curse him balum finally
[40:02] gives counsel to
[40:05] BAC and in and the counsil is given to
[40:08] midianites and this is what happens this
[40:10] is the scriptures that describe it and
[40:13] Israel Abode in sheum and the people
[40:16] begin to commit whoredoms with the
[40:17] daughters of
[40:18] Moab now if you were just reading this
[40:21] chronologically you think well my isn't
[40:22] that awful Isn't that horrible but
[40:24] having read numbers 31 and having read
[40:27] re Revelations 2 we know why they did
[40:30] right it's not just oh they begin to
[40:32] commit whoredom they got impatient and
[40:34] oh something bad Happ no they were
[40:36] tricked there was an effort an an
[40:39] offense made it wasn't that it just kind
[40:41] of happened naturally if I could say it
[40:43] that way it wasn't like oh well it just
[40:44] kind of happened but rather balum taught
[40:47] Bic and they instructed the medidan the
[40:50] midianite women to to deceive and to
[40:53] trap Israel they said well how in the
[40:56] world we ever going to get to a place we
[40:57] can get the midianite women to to
[40:59] deceive these men of Israel we got to
[41:01] get together somehow we got to find a
[41:03] way where they can intermingle and they
[41:05] can mix and so the people began to
[41:07] commit whoredom with the daughters of
[41:08] Moab and they called The People Under
[41:10] The sacrifices of their gods and the
[41:12] people did eat and bow down to their
[41:15] gods and Israel joined himself with Bor
[41:19] and the anger of the Lord was kindled
[41:21] against
[41:23] Israel now we know by revelations 2 in
[41:26] numbers 31 that balum had a Doctrine had
[41:30] a teaching and had a counsel that
[41:32] succeeded in causing the women of Moab
[41:35] to intermingle with the men of Israel
[41:38] and then a way that influenced the men
[41:40] of Israel that they would be enticed to
[41:43] join with these Daughters of Moab and I
[41:47] want to use two different statements to
[41:48] make this point but I I want to kind of
[41:50] bring this out in preface
[41:52] it and and I I don't believe that I'm
[41:55] being uh unfair to do this but when you
[41:59] see how the prophet of God identifies
[42:02] balam's tactics and the pressure that
[42:04] worked upon the men of Israel you'll see
[42:06] that part of his tactic was to create a
[42:08] little bit of Shame within
[42:10] Israel to M to maybe begin to admire
[42:13] Moab a little bit my look at this we
[42:15] haven't eaten like this since we left
[42:17] Egypt look at what they have here look
[42:19] how awesome they're put together it was
[42:21] an effort to create a little bit of
[42:22] Shame by comparison maybe even for them
[42:25] to feel a little bit belittled
[42:27] and and there was a peer pressure that
[42:29] was being exerted to force a political
[42:32] compromise just a little bit of peer
[42:34] pressure just a little bit of force and
[42:37] a and a way to try to bring something to
[42:40] pass and cause something to be and and
[42:43] the way that this happens is can to be
[42:44] very very subtle but in order for balam
[42:47] to accomplish it he had to lift the
[42:50] wrong thing up and belittle the right
[42:53] thing and see if that would be just
[42:55] enough to get the men off center
[42:59] other because it's going to be the men
[43:00] it's the men that sinned as he says that
[43:02] the men begin to the the people begin to
[43:05] commit whoredom with the daughters of
[43:06] Moab so you have the men now who are
[43:08] going to begin to mix with the wrong
[43:10] thing how is balam what was balam's
[43:12] counsel what was his Doctrine he had to
[43:14] teach the people to lift up the wrong
[43:17] thing and make it look great and make it
[43:19] look pretty and make it look pleasing
[43:21] but then at the same time you've got to
[43:23] draw the
[43:24] contrast to the to what their faith to
[43:27] you got to go draw contrast to what
[43:28] they're already married to you've got to
[43:30] belittle this other part because if they
[43:33] could take their eyes off the humble
[43:34] part they could take their eyes off the
[43:36] sweet part and get their eyes on the
[43:38] bigger part and the large part and this
[43:39] attractive part that's what you're going
[43:41] to need to do to cause these men to be
[43:43] distracted and fall you go ahead and use
[43:45] that however you want to in your own
[43:47] life but there's a dynamic there that
[43:49] the devil tries to use time and time
[43:51] again it's one of his calling cards it's
[43:53] one of his MOS it's one of his uh one of
[43:55] the ways you could tell oh this is part
[43:57] of his standard operating
[44:00] procedure now notice what brother bam
[44:02] says and it and knoweth it
[44:04] not this is Brother bam
[44:06] amplifying the tactic of balum look when
[44:10] them Israelite women with callous hands
[44:14] and hair
[44:15] stringing when then sons of God those
[44:18] sons of God come up through the land of
[44:20] Moab and met them dainty women with well
[44:23] set hair and fancy and a lot of manicure
[44:26] on their
[44:28] faces what is it he means I don't know
[44:30] if it's blush or I can't remember what
[44:33] it is he's usually trying to say I'm
[44:34] going to make the same mistake he does
[44:36] he says a lot of manicure on their faces
[44:38] or what you call it and when them sons
[44:40] of God saw those real fair women a false
[44:43] prophets said we're all the same and
[44:45] they married among them and God never
[44:47] did forgive
[44:48] them look at what brother brandom
[44:51] identifies is kind of like the
[44:54] contrast that causes them to to the
[44:56] success of the Feast of B
[44:58] peor he's saying that he was able to
[45:00] draw this contrast between these well
[45:04] set fancy a lot well put together a lot
[45:08] of makeup on their face Dy women's well
[45:11] set hair and that how awesome and
[45:14] attractive that looked versus what he
[45:16] said the callous hands of these
[45:18] Israelite women their stringy
[45:21] hair right think about
[45:25] it there was the these women had been
[45:28] traveling in the wilderness for over 40
[45:30] years
[45:31] now they had been it been 40 years in
[45:34] the wilderness wondering around they
[45:35] they didn't have the luxury of hot baths
[45:37] they didn't have the luxury of being
[45:39] able to stock up on all the latest uh
[45:41] essential oils and they they had left
[45:42] their diffusers in
[45:44] Egypt right in Moab they had theirs
[45:47] running
[45:49] 24/7 and so here the Israelites come and
[45:52] they're not in dotera Young Living at
[45:53] all they don't even have any essential
[45:55] oils at all at their disposal
[45:57] pedicures that that was they gave those
[46:00] when they in Egypt that chance getting
[46:02] them now in the wilderness and now it's
[46:04] the the this beautiful moabit
[46:07] woman who is very attractive and then
[46:10] well look at this this uh worn out
[46:13] callous hand stringy hair of this
[46:15] Israelite woman bam saying that's the
[46:17] image that bam the comparison that balam
[46:20] was able to
[46:21] create now you got to be spiritual to
[46:25] understand how that this is a perfect
[46:26] example of the day we're living in and
[46:28] not just think about the women being the
[46:30] actual women of this world that are
[46:32] beautiful and scantily clad and present
[46:34] themselves in a seductive way to Men of
[46:37] God but also think how would this work
[46:39] on us as Believers both men and women
[46:42] how would this work on us as a
[46:46] church us as the bride we are a woman
[46:49] and us as a church we are a woman but
[46:51] now brother Rams talking about moabit
[46:52] which is a type of the church he's
[46:54] actually describing the church
[46:57] he's not just describing the women he's
[46:59] describing what way churches can look
[47:01] and well set and fancy and a lot of
[47:04] pretense and a lot of makeup a lot of
[47:06] wellp polished things up
[47:08] front what is it a lot a good light show
[47:12] a really good worship and everything
[47:14] looks good real on front but just strip
[47:16] that veneer away from some of these
[47:17] churches and get to the heart of the
[47:19] people and you'll find it can be very
[47:21] very
[47:24] ugly and the god of the this even age he
[47:27] uses the same exact phrasing again and
[47:30] these are used very near to each other
[47:32] just 5 days apart in August of 1965 he
[47:35] say just the same as balam's teaching
[47:37] that it caused the pretty intellectual
[47:40] scientific women a up with their flirty
[47:42] eyes her paints and powders her fine
[47:45] perfumes to entice the sons of
[47:49] God but it wasn't enough just to use the
[47:51] beauty to entice it had to be against
[47:54] something he said before it was their
[47:57] stringy hair and their calloused hands
[47:59] against their own women that worked and
[48:01] had calloused their hands with no makeup
[48:04] on if this doesn't Inspire us as men of
[48:08] God to be set for the defense of this
[48:10] bride if this doesn't Inspire us as a
[48:13] men of God within our own homes as
[48:15] husbands and fathers to defend our wives
[48:17] and our daughters and us as young men
[48:19] and youth groups to defend the virtue a
[48:22] and the Holiness o of the daughters of
[48:24] God and the young people in this church
[48:26] because they're laughed at they're
[48:28] mocked they're scorned they're belittled
[48:30] especially if they're not part of a big
[48:31] youth group or they don't have a
[48:33] particular way they don't drive the nice
[48:34] car they don't have all the nice fancy
[48:36] programs it's real easy for them to be
[48:38] condemned and laughed at and looked down
[48:40] upon and and balum was successful and
[48:43] getting being able to lift up the pretty
[48:45] intellectual scientific flirty eyes
[48:47] paints and powders fine perfumes to
[48:49] entice the sons of God against the women
[48:51] that worked callous their hands with no
[48:54] makeup
[48:55] on yeah to be more mindful to defend and
[48:58] to stand up for true virtue and
[49:03] Holiness and I think that we ought to
[49:05] look at
[49:08] this this positioning this Collision as
[49:11] brother bam calls it of not just the
[49:13] individual men of the of Israel when
[49:16] they met these beautiful women of Moab
[49:19] but also the how churches are
[49:22] today and how that we can use carnal
[49:24] judgments to assess things well the if
[49:26] I'm just putting together my my list and
[49:29] I'm I'm looking at things and who's
[49:30] blessed and what's the best thing to do
[49:32] and where's the best place to go and how
[49:34] how best should we do this and is God
[49:36] really blessing us well look at that
[49:38] group over there they they all they have
[49:39] is a hotel room that kicks them out
[49:41] whenever they want to that can't be of
[49:43] God right I'm try I'm wanting to
[49:45] encourage you a little bit I'm willing
[49:48] to State the obvious there's a way that
[49:50] the devil's going to try to work on you
[49:52] in your mind to
[49:53] belittle a church with callous hands and
[49:56] stringy hair a church with no permanent
[49:58] tent a church that hasn't been well
[50:00] established and it's not hasn't been
[50:01] long very been around for very there's a
[50:03] way that the world and the devil would
[50:05] try to belittle you and discourage you
[50:07] and try to get you to be against the
[50:09] small things and try to look for the big
[50:12] things but what we judge things by is
[50:14] the
[50:16] word since everybody thinks I'm a really
[50:19] really Bill I'm a billionaire
[50:21] lawyer if I finally decide to open up my
[50:24] billionaire trust fund
[50:27] and and and buy a a a half a billion
[50:29] dollar building and and and have
[50:31] everything in Gold and Everything
[50:33] perfect and it's
[50:34] 777 ft from the furthest part of the
[50:37] parking lot to the front door and it's
[50:39] seven steps from the office to the
[50:41] pulpit and then one last eighth step to
[50:44] really get behind it I mean and and
[50:46] everything's just laid that doesn't make
[50:47] us any more
[50:49] right doesn't make us any more spiritual
[50:52] that shouldn't make us any more secure
[50:54] and W well this must be a real
[50:56] legitimate Church church and this this
[50:57] could be a place that we could go to now
[50:59] that we have this multi-million dollar
[51:00] facility no it's not in that at all stay
[51:03] away from carnal judgments keep your
[51:04] eyes on the
[51:07] word because this the reverse is true
[51:09] sometimes people try to hide behind the
[51:11] humility hide behind poverty hide behind
[51:13] being bankrupt hide behind the fact that
[51:15] they don't do uh handle their finances
[51:17] well hide behind the fact that they've
[51:18] squandered a lot of giving and haven't
[51:20] handled the tithes and the offerings
[51:22] very well and they don't have very much
[51:23] they're always getting by and scraping
[51:25] by and there's not much to for and say
[51:27] well God's people have always dwelt
[51:29] behind tents and always really really
[51:30] humble and say well that's not what we
[51:32] judge it by we judge it by the
[51:35] word as Paul is teaching us on Sunday
[51:38] it's not whether you abstain from meats
[51:40] or eat meats that proves you before God
[51:42] we go by the word of God it's a word
[51:45] standard that we're
[51:46] using I don't have these statements to
[51:48] show you because they're just very very
[51:50] quick brother B says balum he succeeded
[51:53] in weakening Israel what did he do he
[51:55] weakened their
[51:57] Camp bam succeeded in doing
[52:00] it how did he do it by lifting up the
[52:03] carnal things to the degree that it
[52:06] caused the the the the spiritual beauty
[52:09] of Israel to
[52:11] fade and it was in
[52:14] that in that
[52:17] conflict that the people began to commit
[52:19] whoredom with the daughters of Moab
[52:21] brother B says a lot about the feast the
[52:23] Feast of Bel
[52:25] peor bam he succeeded in weakening
[52:27] Israel what did he do he weakened their
[52:31] Camp then brother bam says and it's in
[52:34] Phoenix that he says it he says but God
[52:36] he's referring to these very specific
[52:37] things but God rich in Mercy has pulled
[52:40] us out of that chaos and let us see it
[52:43] before the thing hit before the thing
[52:45] hits here isn't that beautiful he's
[52:48] pulled you out of the chaos this is what
[52:49] the message of the hour does this is
[52:51] what Naomi did with with Ruth so to
[52:53] speak pulled her out of the chaos
[52:57] this is what God's word the bread of
[52:58] life is doing for us pulls us out of the
[53:01] chaos and lets us see it before it hits
[53:03] here oh God let us see it before it hits
[53:07] let us let us see it on the horizon
[53:09] before it gets here let me see it coming
[53:10] up within my own heart let me see it
[53:12] when I begin to feel the pressure let me
[53:14] see it when the the conspiracy is
[53:16] engaged against me and the world is
[53:18] trying to lift up the dainty things of
[53:21] Moab and the intellectual scientific
[53:24] things the pretty things of Mo the
[53:25] flirty eyes the paints and powders the
[53:27] fine perfumes trying to entice me
[53:29] against the word of God pull me out of
[53:31] the chaos pull me out of the Temptation
[53:33] pull me out of the deception let me hold
[53:36] to this unpopular
[53:38] gospel let me cling to things that may
[53:41] not be pretty to the world but are
[53:43] beautiful in the eyes of
[53:46] God he's pulled us out of the chaos and
[53:48] he lets us see it before it
[53:51] hits that's the benefit of this
[53:53] message that's the benefit of keeping it
[53:56] before you you I had purposed in my
[53:58] heart before I started to preach I was
[53:59] ped the in the before I came out to
[54:03] encourage you to listen to the message
[54:06] of the hour listen to it listen to it if
[54:09] it's just a matter of not knowing what
[54:11] to listen to text me email me call me
[54:15] hit me on Snapchat whatever you need to
[54:17] do I will share with you a link I will
[54:19] get you an MP3 player I'll load it on
[54:21] your cell phone whatever you need to be
[54:23] able to listen to it you should be
[54:25] feeding on this
[54:27] message my my inspiration even looking
[54:29] at this in the beginning talking about
[54:31] being hungry is we've got to have a
[54:33] strong insatiable appetite for the word
[54:36] and only the word and that appetite's
[54:38] got to remain pure because we got to be
[54:40] feed on the pure word of God we can't be
[54:41] distracted from this we can't be pulled
[54:43] away eating on something else not going
[54:45] to produce the body change so we got to
[54:47] be feeding on the word of God and we've
[54:48] got to stay in the right thing feeding
[54:51] on the right thing and this is what this
[54:53] whole lesson of the bread of life
[54:54] bringing forth the bride the more you
[54:56] feed on this bread the more bride's
[54:58] coming out of you you want more bride to
[55:01] show feed on the bread it's the living
[55:03] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[55:06] you are everyone that I'm looking at
[55:07] tonight and preaching to tonight you are
[55:11] bride well brother Aaron go brother brm
[55:14] said that in every Church there's three
[55:16] kinds of Believers well that's why we're
[55:17] meeting in the
[55:21] hotel no I'm I'm not going to look at
[55:23] you tonight and say well yeah okay yeah
[55:27] and start telling who's make believer
[55:28] who's unbeliever I preach to
[55:31] Believers you are bride tonight and I'm
[55:35] wanting you to know the more bread you
[55:37] eat the more bride you
[55:39] become we must be feeding on the bread
[55:41] of Life feed on the word of God feed on
[55:43] the word of God listen to it digest it
[55:46] get into it hear that voice let that
[55:48] voice be familiar to you so that
[55:50] whenever the scientific moabit tries to
[55:53] come along and belittle this word you
[55:56] know too much about it to be
[56:01] deceived and that's our lesson in
[56:04] looking at this particular dynamic as
[56:06] brother bam says oh it parallels this is
[56:08] he says this is exactly a perfect
[56:11] example of the day we're living
[56:13] in these two Nations contrasted Moab the
[56:16] church the Israel the bride our lesson
[56:19] is leave
[56:20] Moab right that's the lesson leave Moab
[56:23] be washed of Moab get out of Moab break
[56:25] the habits of the Moab and stay with the
[56:29] word brother Bram says this in the
[56:32] chapter 5 of the church age
[56:35] book He's talking exactly about this
[56:39] pressure of balum and the
[56:42] sins that they committed here in numbers
[56:45] 25 he says when any man turns from the
[56:47] word of God and joins a church instead
[56:50] of receiving the spirit that man
[56:55] dies well what if we joined your church
[56:57] brother Aaron yep you'll die just the
[57:00] same well what if what if we join uh uh
[57:03] brother Tim PR's church and don't get
[57:05] the Holy Ghost die just the
[57:08] same but what if we join brother Danny
[57:10] Stan's Church and don't get the Holy
[57:12] Ghost those men of God will tell you die
[57:15] just the
[57:16] same that's why they continue to preach
[57:18] the baptism of the Holy
[57:21] Ghost right because it's not just a
[57:23] matter of finding yourself within the
[57:24] four walls of a an organized church that
[57:28] believes the message or preaches
[57:29] mainstream
[57:30] message you've got it you can't turn
[57:33] away from the word of God and just join
[57:34] a church IT addresses the mindset of
[57:36] people that just want to take comfort in
[57:38] the structure the church
[57:41] order I mean do you realize that one of
[57:43] the things that drives people to just be
[57:45] told what tape to listen to and feel
[57:48] really good about just pushing play
[57:50] because you know the push play the obey
[57:52] part of pushing play is pushing
[57:54] play Push play and Obey is to push play
[57:58] obey by pushing play and that and that's
[58:00] what you do and PE it's very easy like
[58:02] okay that has simplified it to the point
[58:05] where I can do it and I feel good right
[58:08] I feel comfortable I feel safe in that
[58:11] and that's the mindset of the people but
[58:13] you've got to hear what's being said
[58:15] you've got to pursue this with
[58:17] everything that's in your heart you must
[58:19] be born
[58:21] again he says dead that is what he is
[58:23] don't join a church don't get into
[58:26] organization and get taken up with
[58:27] Creeds and tradition or anything that
[58:29] takes the place of the word and the
[58:31] spirit or you are dead it's all over
[58:34] you're
[58:34] dead brother brandom this is formal
[58:36] writing you shouldn't be using
[58:37] conjunctions you shouldn't repeat
[58:39] yourself over and over again like that
[58:41] you're dead it's all over you're
[58:44] dead eternally separated from God this
[58:48] is what has happened in every age sense
[58:50] sense God delivers the people they come
[58:54] out by the blood Sanctified by the word
[58:56] walk through the waters of baptism and
[58:57] get filled with the spirit you can see
[58:59] this en type with the children of Israel
[59:01] but after a while the first love cools
[59:03] off and someone gets the idea that they
[59:05] ought to organize in order to preserve
[59:08] themselves and make a name for
[59:10] themselves maybe under the pretense of
[59:13] protecting the
[59:14] truth right maybe ba balam and Bao had
[59:17] an idea and they could say well we're
[59:19] just doing this because we this is what
[59:22] this is what God says and this is what
[59:24] this says and this is how we ought to do
[59:26] it and this is just the right thing to
[59:28] do and and had it all laid out just
[59:30] right but we know Bayo was doing it
[59:32] because it was too risky not
[59:35] to right we know his motives and reasons
[59:38] for doing it and after a while your
[59:40] first love cools off you get the idea
[59:42] you ought to organize to preserve
[59:43] yourself and make a name for yourself
[59:46] and they organiz organized themselves
[59:48] right back into the second generation
[59:50] sometimes even before then they no
[59:52] longer have the spirit of God just a
[59:55] form of of
[59:57] worship they are dead they have
[59:59] hybridized themselves with Creed and
[1:00:01] form and there is no life in
[1:00:06] them that's that's the death of
[1:00:09] Moab that's the danger of staying in
[1:00:11] Moab and and and and the as brother
[1:00:15] random emphasizes you could take this
[1:00:16] Spirit on so easy and not know
[1:00:19] it I share it to challenge us as a
[1:00:22] church very young in our
[1:00:24] Genesis that we don't make this
[1:00:27] mistake to where we organize to preserve
[1:00:30] ourselves to make a name for ourselves I
[1:00:32] preached for a church in Switzerland do
[1:00:34] you want to know its name I would too
[1:00:36] because it doesn't have one they never
[1:00:39] even gave their Church a
[1:00:40] name why they don't want it to become
[1:00:42] about the church so it's just the church
[1:00:45] with no
[1:00:46] name beautiful Church in a really
[1:00:49] beautiful part of the
[1:00:50] world outside of Zurich but they haven't
[1:00:53] given themselves a name ow that that
[1:00:56] that in itself doesn't make them right
[1:00:58] but wonderful congregation love the word
[1:01:00] have a wonderful
[1:01:01] pastor but what happens if you organize
[1:01:03] yourself make a name for yourself the
[1:01:05] danger is you lose the Zeal for God
[1:01:09] passion for his word you settle down the
[1:01:12] spirit leaves he says you just have a
[1:01:13] form of worship now when you say the
[1:01:16] form of worship it's not just a shadow
[1:01:17] of worship where people show up and like
[1:01:20] oh this church is dead no it can be very
[1:01:24] robust it can be very hot it can seem to
[1:01:26] be very passionate very thriving he says
[1:01:28] but they're dead why because they
[1:01:30] hybrid and it became Creeds it became
[1:01:33] carnal sons of carnality organization
[1:01:35] form but no life don't let it happen to
[1:01:38] this church if God would see fit that he
[1:01:41] would te the meeting in the air and we
[1:01:43] would not we would not translate for
[1:01:45] another 20 or 30 years he says even
[1:01:47] before the second generation they're
[1:01:49] dead may we not May regardless of how
[1:01:52] much time would pass may we always keep
[1:01:54] the word before us
[1:01:56] let's stand to our feet
[1:01:59] tonight Brothers if you could
[1:02:07] come the lesson is to get out of Moab
[1:02:10] and get into the
[1:02:13] message get out of
[1:02:16] Moab and stay with the
[1:02:18] word brother shared with me I hope he
[1:02:20] doesn't mind me sharing this but he he
[1:02:23] confessed just as of late that and he
[1:02:25] did it to a family member and he said I
[1:02:27] just want to apologize to you he said
[1:02:29] for my whole life he said I've I've been
[1:02:31] a really really good message believer
[1:02:34] but I haven't been a very good Christian
[1:02:37] what distinction was being made is the
[1:02:40] methods that we develop in the message
[1:02:42] to be
[1:02:44] message and to be faithful to that
[1:02:46] structure and that Dynamic but in doing
[1:02:49] that without the without the spirit of
[1:02:51] God all we're doing is we're lifting
[1:02:53] we're making a name for ourselves all
[1:02:56] we're doing is perpetuating organization
[1:02:57] we're just perpetuating structure we're
[1:02:59] just seeing making sure that things
[1:03:02] exist and
[1:03:04] succeed and that it has a has a pathway
[1:03:07] going forward but it's it's different
[1:03:09] when you're married to the word and you
[1:03:11] let the word have prence brother BR says
[1:03:14] that word this is in a chapter two of
[1:03:16] the church age book that word is never
[1:03:17] failed in the mouths of believing
[1:03:19] Christians I know it carries with it the
[1:03:22] image of it being put on your tongue in
[1:03:23] order to speak it but I want you to look
[1:03:25] at it as being put in your mouth to eat
[1:03:27] it never failed when you eat it and in
[1:03:31] this last age it is here stronger and
[1:03:33] greater than ever in the true word
[1:03:36] bride so right now tonight it's here
[1:03:40] stronger and greater than ever where in
[1:03:44] you in the
[1:03:46] bride stronger and greater than ever
[1:03:49] stronger and greater than ever oh
[1:03:51] brother Aaron that's in the church age
[1:03:52] book okay brother BR said it was his
[1:03:55] book
[1:03:56] stronger and greater than ever in the
[1:03:58] true word bride oh little flock you
[1:04:02] little
[1:04:04] minority what is it that balum thought
[1:04:07] would be the kind of the Twist and the
[1:04:10] sting to cause Israel to stumble look at
[1:04:14] you with your callous hands and your
[1:04:15] stringy hair you're in the minority here
[1:04:19] how do you stack up against these other
[1:04:22] scientific intellectual pretty flirty
[1:04:24] paints and powders fine perfumes how do
[1:04:27] you stand up how do you line up to it
[1:04:29] saying Little Flock you little minority
[1:04:31] I love this is the true Prophet this is
[1:04:34] the rebuke to balum this is the rebuke
[1:04:37] to Bao this is the rebuke to the
[1:04:38] doctrine of balum the he of balam the
[1:04:40] way of balam this is the rebuke to the
[1:04:42] Council of balum this is a prophet a
[1:04:44] true prophet of God standing up to call
[1:04:47] us out of the
[1:04:49] chaos he says hold on to the word fill
[1:04:52] your mouth and heart with it and someday
[1:04:55] God will give you the
[1:04:56] kingdom Hold to this word fill your
[1:05:00] mouth with it eat it eat it fill your
[1:05:03] belly up with it eat it eat it and your

[1:05:08] land someday you'll possess it stay with
[1:05:12] it with everything that's in you if God
[1:05:14] would leave lead us to go to verse three
[1:05:16] in the Book of Ruth we can begin to read
[1:05:18] how that they take their two sons ALC
[1:05:22] and Naomi into
[1:05:23] Moab and ALC died
[1:05:26] nothing but sorrow that awaited Naomi
[1:05:27] and
[1:05:28] Moab but then the two sons married two
[1:05:32] women of
[1:05:33] Moab doing this even with knowing that
[1:05:37] there's a
[1:05:38] consequence for doing
[1:05:40] this knowing even the history of what
[1:05:43] God had called him out of that even
[1:05:46] those two died and it describes Naomi
[1:05:49] being
[1:05:50] left without her
[1:05:53] sons without her husbands
[1:05:57] but then she hears that the Lord had
[1:05:58] visited her
[1:06:00] people in giving them bread and
[1:06:04] that's what brings
[1:06:06] Ruth out of
[1:06:08] Moab the visitation of the Lord let's
[1:06:11] bow our heads heavenly
[1:06:17] father if there is a
[1:06:21] roof in Moab
[1:06:24] tonight may she hear the voice of
[1:06:26] Revelations 18:4 calling her out of
[1:06:30] Babylon may she hear the invitation to
[1:06:34] flee from a moabit condition and come to
[1:06:38] a
[1:06:39] fountain come to a place where your
[1:06:41] bread
[1:06:43] is and be forever
[1:06:45] [Music]
[1:06:47] changed and also Lord may we who have
[1:06:49] heard this voice we who have set out in
[1:06:51] this
[1:06:53] journey we who have been P out of this
[1:06:58] chaos Lord we're thankful
[1:07:01] tonight we are so thankful
[1:07:05] tonight that this message has been
[1:07:08] preserved even as our brother Manuel
[1:07:11] expressed at our Men's breakfast how to
[1:07:14] hear it in English to understand it in
[1:07:16] English Lord what a
[1:07:19] precious privilege that
[1:07:21] is Lord may we be faithful to this
[1:07:24] message
[1:07:26] that we have a a greater desire to see
[1:07:28] that it's distributed to see that it
[1:07:29] reaches those who don't have it that we
[1:07:31] support missions and things that would
[1:07:35] get this word
[1:07:36] out because this is a true word this is
[1:07:39] a pure word that's going to call your
[1:07:41] daughter out of
[1:07:43] Moab and Lord as we we've arrived at
[1:07:45] this last juncture as we've arrived at
[1:07:48] this last place in this positioning here
[1:07:51] at the doorstep of a body change a
[1:07:53] wedding supper and a millennium
[1:07:55] we realize now that the bread of life is
[1:07:58] attacking and tearing down and
[1:07:59] destroying our Moab
[1:08:01] mindset and the modalities and the
[1:08:04] things that we've accepted and the ways
[1:08:05] that we've administered Justice and the
[1:08:07] way that we've tried to establish
[1:08:09] systems to persevere and to survive Lord
[1:08:12] we don't want to survive Leo deia we
[1:08:14] want to destroy it completely overthrow
[1:08:16] it we want to step outside of it we want
[1:08:18] to be
[1:08:19] changed so Lord may we not simply try to
[1:08:22] exist as a means of survival but Lord
[1:08:25] Thrive as a means of
[1:08:28] departure Lord may we accept and see so
[1:08:32] plainly that the Lord has visited your
[1:08:35] people and is giving us
[1:08:38] bread may it strengthen us and encourage
[1:08:41] us I pray in your precious name I ask
[1:08:44] that you would bless and touch your
[1:08:46] people tonight amen
