[0:00] continuing on the holiday subject of
[0:01] hate and the Christmas subject of hate
[0:04] and tonight we're going to ask the
[0:06] specific question of where is the love
[0:09] and it's continuing on what we were
[0:10] ministering on on Sunday we spoke on
[0:12] where is the Peace we connected how that
[0:14] peace is associated U with hatred in
[0:17] terms of being an opposite and I'll say
[0:20] this at the outset tonight I want you to
[0:22] grab a hold of this from the very very
[0:24] beginning because I I have a lot that I
[0:25] want to cover and I think a lot of it
[0:26] may be things we already know nothing
[0:29] that's going to be really surprising
[0:30] like oh wow I didn't know that was there
[0:32] I think it's all going to be just
[0:33] bringing it to remembrance but what I
[0:35] would like you to be able to do is
[0:37] number one acknowledge that hatred is an
[0:39] emotion that we struggle with as human
[0:41] beings uh it and it's something that we
[0:43] wrestle with as Christians and what I'm
[0:46] wanting to do is consider the origin and
[0:48] nature of hate so as we look at the
[0:51] origin and nature of hate I want you to
[0:53] be able to think about what that means
[0:55] in your life if you have this kind of
[0:57] hate in your spirit or in your heart and
[0:59] and think about it how that it had a
[1:01] beginning and so it has a Genesis and it
[1:03] has a nature and so that if we have that
[1:05] and we wrestle with it or or
[1:07] experiencing it to to have more of an
[1:09] Enlightenment of what that's akin to or
[1:11] where it comes from so that we can have
[1:13] the right attitude towards it now as we
[1:16] Define hate at the outset we're going to
[1:17] use the same definitions we had on
[1:19] Sunday it's an intense negative
[1:21] emotional response towards someone or
[1:24] something I'm glad that we could use
[1:25] that negative in there because many
[1:27] times we have intense emotional resp
[1:29] responses and we might say that it's
[1:32] hatred but I want us to all realize that
[1:34] it can be a negative this hatred that
[1:36] we're talking about is a negative and
[1:38] it's intense it's emotional and it's
[1:41] toward someone or something and it has
[1:44] its roots when we talk about hate and we
[1:46] even use that word in our English
[1:47] language we're talking about something
[1:50] that relates to maliciousness so it's
[1:52] not just U something oh I hate that
[1:55] restaurant well I mean really you want
[1:58] to burn it you want to torch it at night
[2:00] you know there's some things we say we
[2:01] just use it as a term I hate to say this
[2:03] or I hate to keep you long and we're
[2:05] really not meaning that it's malicious
[2:06] or full of spite but this hate I'm
[2:09] talking about is more than just a phrase
[2:10] we use as human beings and a term of
[2:13] convenience to express dislike but it's
[2:15] something that's rooted in Malice
[2:16] something that's rooted in spite it is a
[2:19] to regard something with extreme ill
[2:22] will it to have a pass passionate
[2:25] aversion to where you recoil from
[2:27] something and you can't stand it and I
[2:29] find that this kind of all begins to
[2:31] funnel into one view that when you hate
[2:34] something it's essentially your enemy or
[2:36] you treat it as an enemy if you hate
[2:39] something you would not want to see it
[2:40] succeed if you hate something you would
[2:42] not want to see it flourish or you
[2:43] wouldn't want to participate in it you
[2:45] wouldn't want to see it you wouldn't
[2:46] want to talk to it you wouldn't want to
[2:47] have it and so it's something that you
[2:49] would push away or you'd want to see
[2:50] destroyed and that's where that malice
[2:52] is in that Spite is and if I could put
[2:56] it this way and this might just be kind
[2:57] of a larger theme tonight so that we're
[3:00] contined distinguish uh uh between love
[3:03] and hate but also be more particular
[3:05] about the hate we're addressing uh in
[3:07] this beautiful Christmas font with the
[3:08] snowflakes around it it's a hate that is
[3:11] not of God right we're looking at a hate
[3:13] that is not of God so that we could say
[3:16] there is a hate it's a hate that's
[3:18] doesn't have a higher origin it's a hate
[3:21] that is not connected with some higher
[3:23] purpose that when there's a hate and
[3:24] it's got reason behind it and it's got
[3:26] some sort of comprehension behind it
[3:27] we're talking about a hate uh that is
[3:30] this purely human and carnal and if I
[3:33] could do so as we did on Sunday in
[3:35] looking at peace as kind of an opposite
[3:37] to hate I know that this is uh maybe
[3:40] very obvious but I want to look at love
[3:42] as the opposite of this hate we're
[3:44] talking about a hate that's rooted in
[3:46] Wrath or expresses itself in disgust or
[3:49] it's it's a hate that is solely based
[3:51] upon human perception and Human
[3:53] Experience and and and I hope to uh hope
[3:58] to show that there's a difference
[3:59] between or that this love is an opposite
[4:01] to hate maybe the best way to express
[4:03] this and I think this will make some
[4:05] sense that love is indeed the opposite
[4:07] of hate when it's with respect to the
[4:09] same thing does that make sense and
[4:12] because there's some things I can say
[4:13] man I I I really I really love apples
[4:16] and you say man I hate
[4:17] clowns and you be like I didn't realize
[4:20] apples were clowning and you say there's
[4:22] that's not an opposite it's not a
[4:24] comparison that's just another sentiment
[4:26] that's really not the opposite of my
[4:28] sentiments for this or and I'm not
[4:29] necessarily saying that I love apples
[4:32] how you like them apples maybe is what
[4:33] it is we like apples we don't love or
[4:35] hate them but there's a there's a hate
[4:37] that is the opposite of love and we
[4:39] could see that with respect to human
[4:41] language when it comes to the same thing
[4:44] and even in the Ecclesiastes chapter
[4:46] 3:8 we could just look at this in terms
[4:48] of the writer showing uh not Point
[4:51] Counterpoint but uh opposites he says a
[4:53] time to love we know there's a lot more
[4:55] in these several verses around here but
[4:57] says these there's times for this
[4:58] there's a time for happiness it's a time
[4:59] for weeping a time to love and then kind
[5:02] of this counterpart a time to hate and I
[5:05] know in reading that we say oh see
[5:07] there's a time to hate and we could say
[5:10] yeah but that would if we're going to
[5:11] say that's what it's about that it's
[5:12] saying there is a time to love and
[5:14] there's also an appropriate time to hate
[5:15] we'd want to know what that appropriate
[5:16] hate is it's showing there's a time to
[5:19] love there's a time to hate then even as
[5:21] partners to this a time of war and a
[5:23] time of Peace so love and peace are are
[5:26] are kind of connected together this
[5:28] hatred and warfare connected together
[5:30] and the writer saying there's a time for
[5:32] love and then in the opposite way
[5:33] there's a time for hate and there's a
[5:35] Time For Peace kind of a companion to
[5:37] love and but also in an opposite a time
[5:39] of
[5:40] War 1 John 4:16 it says and we have
[5:44] known and believe the love that God hath
[5:46] to us God is love the Bible expressing
[5:51] God in terms of love I want to use that
[5:54] again to show this hate as an opposite
[5:56] cuz God being love that word there's the
[5:58] gape love as we say it it and we've
[6:00] mentioned this several times it's a love
[6:02] of intelligence not human intelligence
[6:04] but it's a love of reason and
[6:06] comprehension so there's there's a basis
[6:08] for it it's connected to something even
[6:10] as it's written in the Lexicon it's
[6:12] corresponding and coupled with a
[6:14] corresponding purpose it's a love uh
[6:18] that is vastly higher than human love
[6:21] that when we talk about agape love we
[6:22] said that's the love of God that's a
[6:24] higher love because it has Intelligence
[6:26] it has reason it's joined with the
[6:29] higher purpose it it's not without basis
[6:31] it's not without reason it has a it's
[6:33] governed by a higher conscience so we
[6:36] say that God loves God knows all things
[6:38] and loves God understands the end from
[6:40] the beginning and loves and so that kind
[6:42] of love sees the big picture that kind
[6:45] of love is associated with a higher
[6:47] purpose the will of God and God's God's
[6:50] righteousness but when we talk about a
[6:52] human love I know this is simplistic
[6:55] language because this word is even used
[6:57] of God but when we talk about aelio love
[6:59] it's a love of affection personal
[7:01] affection a love of of passions or
[7:03] liking and it doesn't necessarily have a
[7:06] higher intelligence behind it it doesn't
[7:09] necessarily have a purpose behind it so
[7:11] there's a love which we say is of God
[7:13] and there's a love which we say is of
[7:15] human emotion in the same way I want to
[7:17] say that there's a hatred that is
[7:19] related to God and there's a hatred
[7:21] which is of god and there's also a hate
[7:24] that is of the world there's a hate that
[7:27] we can see that is associated with
[7:28] perfect love we can see that there's a
[7:30] hate that corresponds to a higher
[7:32] purpose but then there's also a hate and
[7:34] that's the one that we're wanting to
[7:35] address that is of the world and is
[7:38] solely of the world in John chapter 15:
[7:42] 17 18 and 19 he says these things I
[7:45] command you that you love one another
[7:48] and in provoking this love one to
[7:50] another he brings out this contrast if
[7:52] the world hate you you know that it
[7:54] hated me before it hated you so this is
[7:57] a hate that was in the world this this
[7:59] is a hate that we can say this exists
[8:01] within the heart of the unsaved this is
[8:03] a hate that exists in those who are
[8:05] opposed to Christ this this this is
[8:08] putting hatred in an arena in an area
[8:10] we're using a language of hate that says
[8:12] this is a hate that's in the heart of
[8:13] those that hate Christ if you were of
[8:16] the world the world would love his own
[8:18] if you were of the world the world
[8:19] wouldn't hate you as it does it would
[8:22] love you but because you are not of the
[8:23] world but I have chosen you out of the
[8:25] world therefore the world hateth you
[8:28] that's Jesus putting it in terms of love
[8:30] and hate there's love on the one hand
[8:32] there's hatred on the other and there's
[8:35] this animosity and this opposition
[8:37] between Christ and the world where the
[8:39] world hates Christ and because you are
[8:41] of Christ and not of the world it
[8:43] doesn't love you in a worldly sense but
[8:45] it hates you in a worldly
[8:47] sense God it says it this way God be in
[8:50] love John had said it this way in 1 John
[8:53] 2:15 love not the world neither the
[8:56] things that are in the world if any man
[8:58] love the world the love of the father is
[9:00] not in him so there's this association
[9:04] between a love for God and having a love
[9:06] for God meaning we don't love the world
[9:10] say oh I'm full of the love of God and I
[9:11] love this and I love that and I love the
[9:13] world and I love this and I love that
[9:14] and I just love everything well that
[9:16] would be a perversion of the love of God
[9:18] because God's love
[9:20] requires a the appropriate perception of
[9:23] evil and the distance from it where you
[9:26] would asso it you would push it away and
[9:28] not embrace it when you love something
[9:30] you look after it you care for it you
[9:31] would uh even if you would correct it
[9:34] and chastise it because you love it it's
[9:35] seeking to redeem it and improve it and
[9:37] approve it standing you don't do that
[9:39] with evil you say well I hate it that
[9:41] everyone talks so bad about evil I want
[9:44] to draw it in close to me I want to give
[9:45] evil a good name you wouldn't do that
[9:47] you say I I want to have nothing to do
[9:49] with it and so this love and hate is
[9:51] expressed as opposites I came across a
[9:54] statement today and I felt to share this
[9:56] brother says if it it's talking about a
[9:58] heart and individual says if it hates
[10:01] the world and loves God you don't have
[10:03] to sign a card to go to church and make
[10:04] pledges you'll be there when the door
[10:07] opens so those of those of you are not
[10:10] here tonight you just don't love
[10:14] God oh if if you hate the world and love
[10:17] God it's brother bam just kidding with
[10:19] that uh there's if you if you look at in
[10:22] those terms if there's a heart that
[10:24] hates the world that hatred is only
[10:26] right because it loves God and and he's
[10:29] saying that because that love for God is
[10:32] there we don't come to church because we
[10:33] hate the world and we hate Leo DEA and
[10:34] we hate Democrats and we hate the
[10:36] direction this world is going and we
[10:38] hate this and we hate that and that's
[10:39] the reason why we find ourselves in a in
[10:41] in a conservative leading ideology
[10:43] Church no we do it because we love
[10:47] God now in Romans 12:9 and again we're
[10:50] going to keep repeating this
[10:52] theme if we're going to be looking at
[10:54] hate and then now love is this opposite
[10:57] or where ask the question where's the
[10:58] love wanting us to recognize that hate
[11:01] finds place where love is
[11:04] absent this negative hate we're talking
[11:06] about in Romans 12:9 again a lot of this
[11:08] is reviewed tonight let love be without
[11:11] dissimulation abhor that which is evil
[11:13] cleave to that which is good this is an
[11:15] often repeated scripture uh by myself I
[11:18] realize that that love is to not be
[11:21] hypocritical and in order to have a love
[11:23] that is pure and correct and not
[11:25] hypocritical we must abhor that which is
[11:28] evil as we mentioned Sunday this is not
[11:30] a justification for anger this isn't a
[11:33] justification for outrage or some sort
[11:35] the spiteful treatment of others I'm
[11:36] just a wh match what is evil no this is
[11:39] a a to abhor means to hate but it's not
[11:42] a justification for anger or for wrath
[11:45] to abhor means to dislike to have a
[11:46] of it comes from the word hated or
[11:50] detestable and recognize how Paul is
[11:54] saying let love be without dis
[11:56] dissimulation hate that which is evil so
[11:58] it's connected with the gape he saying
[12:00] if you're really going to have pure
[12:01] perfect agape love you have to hate with
[12:04] that that which is evil as we mentioned
[12:06] on Sunday and we did earlier in the year
[12:07] when we spoke on Love and Hate he Paul
[12:10] said excuse me David writing through thy
[12:12] precepts I get understanding therefore I
[12:14] hate every false way Psalm 11914 through
[12:18] thy precepts I'm getting understanding
[12:20] and the more that I learn about your
[12:21] nature the more I learn about your way
[12:23] the more I hate the wrong way the more I
[12:26] learn about your heart the more I hate
[12:27] the heart that's against you
[12:29] and so this is a hate that is connected
[12:32] with the love and nature of God not a
[12:34] hate that we find within ourselves
[12:35] because we disagree not a hate because
[12:37] the way we've been treated not a hate
[12:39] because the way something makes us feel
[12:41] U external to us but it's a hate that's
[12:43] connected with the more I know your word
[12:46] the more I know the more I know truth
[12:48] the more I hate a lie the more I know
[12:50] about righteousness the more I hate
[12:53] wickedness let's say this in the
[12:55] scripture in Psalms 11:
[12:57] 5-7 the Lord trith the righteous but the
[13:01] wicked and him that loveth violence his
[13:04] soul hateth now this is uh just reading
[13:08] it from the King James some people don't
[13:10] like it but it's in the Bible he said
[13:12] the Lord trith the righteous but the
[13:14] wicked and him that loveth violence
[13:16] speaking about the Lord his soul
[13:19] hateth what a statement God tries the
[13:22] righteous the Lord uh tests them and
[13:24] proves them and the the Lord tries the
[13:26] righteous but when it comes to the
[13:27] wicked and him that loves vence it says
[13:29] the soul of God the soul of Lord hates
[13:32] them that's strong language upon the
[13:35] wicked shall he reain snares fire and
[13:36] brimstone and a horrible Tempest this
[13:39] shall be the portion of their Cup this
[13:40] is upon the wicked because he hates them
[13:43] now it's not to be examined
[13:45] independently of this verse for the L
[13:48] the righteous Lord for the Lord the
[13:50] righteous Lord loveth
[13:53] righteousness the Lord is righteous and
[13:55] loves righteousness the right righteous
[13:57] lord loves righteousness his countenance
[14:00] doth behold the
[14:01] upright then we can look at it this way
[14:04] when God speaks about punishing the
[14:05] unrighteous or punishing the wicked his
[14:08] punishment for wickedness is
[14:09] proportional to his love for
[14:11] righteousness his punishment to
[14:13] wickedness is proportional to his reward
[14:15] for righteousness his punishment for
[14:17] lying is proportional to his reward for
[14:18] telling the truth so there's some it's
[14:21] it's this counterpart or this opposite
[14:23] measure or extreme only because love
[14:26] exists it's not a God that spiteful and
[14:29] vengeful and God that's hateful and God
[14:31] that's mean and a God that's judging
[14:32] apart from a God that's a rewarder and a
[14:34] God that gives and a God that's kind and
[14:36] a God That Forgives the wicked that he
[14:38] that he hates them that loves violence
[14:39] he hates because the lord loves
[14:41] righteousness Amen in Psalms 37:28 for
[14:45] the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh
[14:47] not his Saints they are preserved
[14:49] forever but the seed of the wicked shall
[14:51] be cut off why because God loves
[14:53] righteousness it's not that God just
[14:56] hates wickedness for wickedness sake but
[14:58] his his hatred for evil is connected
[15:00] with his love for righteousness are you
[15:02] connecting this I think it's very
[15:04] important as we look at the subject of
[15:05] hate that we know very clearly in our
[15:07] hearts whether or not we have the right
[15:09] kind of disdain for evil a a and and
[15:13] that it's joined with the right kind of
[15:15] love otherwise we can find ourselves
[15:17] gripped with the hatred that has been is
[15:21] untethered
[15:22] unhinged and not connected at all with
[15:25] the grace of God Proverbs 6: 16- 19 19
[15:29] the these six things do the Lord hate
[15:31] yay seven are an Abomination unto him I
[15:33] like how that he's writing and he still
[15:35] has to kind of say six no wait seven we
[15:38] would just backs space and say seven
[15:40] wait seven but these six things that the
[15:43] Lord hate this is now giving God the
[15:45] language and the attribute of this
[15:47] emotion towards something and it's going
[15:50] to name them and as I name them I want
[15:51] you to recognize that the reason why
[15:54] these things are hated is because
[15:57] they're the opposite of something that
[15:58] God loves a proud look that would be the
[16:01] opposite of humility a lying tongue one
[16:04] that would tell truth and hands that
[16:05] shed innocent blood other than
[16:07] preserving it or preserving life a heart
[16:09] that deviseth Wicked imaginations feet
[16:11] that be Swift and running to Mischief a
[16:13] false witness that speaketh lies and he
[16:15] that Seth Discord among the Brethren the
[16:19] Bible says these things are an
[16:20] Abomination that means something that
[16:22] God detest and something that God hates
[16:25] God hates these things he detests them
[16:29] not because he's like oh I hate that I
[16:31] just don't like it I hate it I detest it
[16:33] but it's because of what he
[16:35] loves it's very important I think for us
[16:37] to recognize this St Thomas aquinus in
[16:41] his uh his writings in the summary of
[16:44] theology he's he's talking about how
[16:47] that love it's necessary that love
[16:49] precedes hate that you first have to
[16:51] have love and I in and in this this way
[16:54] I know that what I've read of his
[16:55] writings on this I I agree in this
[16:57] regard as I see in the message of the
[16:59] hour that this that the kind of hate
[17:01] what we're talking about here with God
[17:03] God hating this and God hating
[17:05] wickedness and aboring that which is
[17:06] evil love has to come before that he
[17:10] says and nothing is hated except through
[17:12] being contrary to a suitable thing which
[17:14] is loved and hence it is that very
[17:18] hatred and hence it is that very that
[17:21] every hatred is caused by love in that
[17:24] way in this way hatred is caused by love
[17:28] that if I abhor that which is evil I
[17:30] have to first have this love in my heart
[17:32] for God I can't take the scripture and
[17:35] these attributes God is a vengeful God
[17:37] and God is the wrath of God Is Spoken of
[17:39] and The Temper The Tempest of God before
[17:41] him and God hating evil and God uh
[17:44] judging this and judging that and we
[17:46] kind of pull all these righteous uh this
[17:48] righteous indignation of God and we kind
[17:50] of create this idea of what we think God
[17:52] is and then we try to do some God
[17:54] cosplay as being this angry vengeful
[17:57] hater of evil Avenger of righteousness
[18:00] and we're just mirroring and mimicking
[18:02] some attribute of God that is no longer
[18:04] associated with the nature and character
[18:06] of God because in order to have the
[18:08] hatred of God you have to have the love
[18:09] of God in your heart because his love
[18:12] agape love precedes this
[18:16] hate in John chap 15: 23 to 2 as we read
[18:20] this in the
[18:23] beginning I'm already getting the yawn
[18:25] so we'll try to hurry he that hateth me
[18:27] hateth my father
[18:29] also if I had not done among them The
[18:32] Works which none other man did they did
[18:34] not have they had not had sin but now
[18:36] have they both seen and hated both me
[18:39] and my father now if we look at that you
[18:41] realize Paul said because I speak the
[18:43] truth to you I become your enemy and
[18:45] Jesus saying it's because of what I've
[18:46] done if I never did what I did they
[18:48] wouldn't hate me so if we can just kind
[18:51] of distill that down and maybe just a
[18:52] general proposition truth which Jesus
[18:55] Christ was is being expressed and that
[18:58] becomes the impetus for hate that's what
[19:00] provokes the hate had he never said
[19:02] anything and spoke truth they would have
[19:04] just treated him like another Carpenter
[19:05] son or another Carpenter but because
[19:07] he's expressing and manifesting the true
[19:09] nature of God and the true nature of
[19:11] love and the true nature of the word
[19:13] that provoked a hatred inside of them
[19:15] and then he brings it to Psalm 69:4 but
[19:18] this cometh to pass that the word might
[19:20] be fulfilled that is written in their
[19:21] law they hated me without a
[19:24] cause now just even in that language
[19:27] suggests that oh
[19:28] is that where their error was is they
[19:31] didn't have a cause a true cause or
[19:33] justification for their hatred and we
[19:36] could say that sounds true I guess I
[19:39] could even say myself that's exactly
[19:41] what he's saying is they had hate but it
[19:43] was the wrong kind of hate they had they
[19:46] they rejected me but not for the right
[19:48] reasons because we couldn't say that the
[19:50] opposite of Love or the opposite of hate
[19:52] is to accept everything and the opposite
[19:54] of rejecting something is to accept it
[19:56] no this is to say that we if we're
[19:59] trying to isue evil there is a rejection
[20:01] of evil he said but they rejected me the
[20:03] truth and they hated me and he says
[20:05] that's not right you can't hate truth as
[20:08] the psalmist wrote it this way they that
[20:10] Hate Me Without a Cause Jesus using that
[20:13] very word they hated me Without a Cause
[20:15] but he says Be Mine enemies
[20:18] wrongfully to hate without a cause it's
[20:20] hatred without a love hatred without a
[20:22] Divine Purpose hatred without the right
[20:25] kind of power behind
[20:27] it if there was an actual hatred for
[20:30] something then the the true hatred
[20:33] having the love preceded and it's
[20:36] Genesis being in love then if there's
[20:38] hatred love will project to redeem that
[20:41] which is hated love will project to
[20:43] restore that which is disagreeable love
[20:45] will project to correct that which is
[20:47] wrong but when you take love out of it
[20:49] hate just wants to destroy what it
[20:50] disagrees
[20:51] with so to do it without a cause this
[20:54] was hatred without love they didn't hate
[20:55] Christ because he was contrary to the
[20:57] word they hat him because he was
[20:58] contrary to their interpretation of the
[21:00] world he says word he's like you've got
[21:01] it wrong to be enemies wrongfully they
[21:04] were my enemies wrongfully and and David
[21:07] even writing so I restored that which I
[21:09] didn't take away it's saying that I was
[21:11] falsely accused I was maligned I was
[21:13] misjudged wrongfully so I I in order to
[21:16] have peace I restored what was what they
[21:18] accused me of taking away just so that I
[21:20] could have peace but it's saying is I
[21:22] was their enemies wrongfully through
[21:23] lies and misunderstanding and not truth
[21:27] I became their enemy because someone
[21:28] lied on me I became an enemy because
[21:30] they misunderstood me I became an enemy
[21:32] because they disagreed with this he say
[21:34] it was wrong it was wrong for me to be
[21:37] an enemy because it wasn't based upon
[21:39] truth are you catching I hope they
[21:42] catching some small way while I'm taking
[21:44] a lot of time to talk about love and
[21:46] hate and even acknowledge that there is
[21:48] a hatred which is of god which is joined
[21:50] with the love of God of a higher purpose
[21:52] a hate which is a consequence of loving
[21:55] God how can I how can I love God in and
[21:58] love the
[22:00] world and so we're looking at the origin
[22:02] of Love excuse me the origin of
[22:05] hate and we as we mentioned it on Sunday
[22:09] and we were trying to show this on
[22:10] Sunday and I hope it becomes clear
[22:12] tonight when we hate we lose our
[22:17] peace because when we hate we go to war
[22:20] and you may never actually declare war
[22:22] you may never draw your sword you may
[22:23] never you know key somebody's car pop
[22:25] their tires or poison their coffee but
[22:28] in some way when you hate somebody you
[22:29] might in some ways going I I sure hope
[22:31] their Tire blows out on the i7 tomorrow
[22:34] right there might be something you say
[22:36] and it's like do you realize what you
[22:37] just said do you realize what you want
[22:39] do you realize what you're wishing upon
[22:40] them and so when we hate we lose our
[22:43] peace we relinquish it we let it go as
[22:47] soon as we begin to hate whatever peace
[22:49] we have in our heart we nudge it out and
[22:51] hate takes its
[22:53] place and and now if with that in mind I
[22:56] don't want you to lose sight of that
[22:57] that when we we hate we lose our peace
[23:00] but we hate because we've left
[23:02] love we hate because we've left love
[23:06] we've lost sight of it we have love in
[23:09] our hearts then and we can hold that
[23:11] love in our hearts then there's there's
[23:13] some sort of there's a right kind of
[23:15] hatred that we can have but when we lose
[23:17] when we begin to lose that kind of love
[23:19] and it loses Center and it creates some
[23:21] space in our spirit there's some space
[23:23] in our spirit for us to once we've left
[23:25] love then hate comes in as soon as hate
[23:27] comes in the next thing it does is
[23:28] pushes away our peace and I'm hoping I'm
[23:31] giving you a template to examine your
[23:32] life sometimes when you find yourself
[23:34] completely in an upheaval and you're and
[23:36] you're restless and things aren't
[23:37] working out the way you want it to and
[23:38] your heart and in your spirit and your
[23:40] temperament and be able to do some sort
[23:41] of forensics and say wait a minute wait
[23:43] a minute wait a minute let me back
[23:44] through this I'm at War I'm I have no
[23:47] peace I've lost my peace and hatred has
[23:50] filled that Gap I need to go back and
[23:52] realize how we got that to that place
[23:53] you realize I've left Center of God's
[23:56] love amen that that that to me is just a
[23:59] good a good template to look at as we
[24:02] turn to Genesis chapter 3 love is left
[24:05] and once you leave love hatred fills the
[24:07] void and once hatred gets in there the
[24:09] next thing it kicks out is
[24:11] peace now looking at the origin of hate
[24:15] this is obvious my wife and I were
[24:16] fellowshipping on this last week and she
[24:19] immediately began to mention this
[24:20] scripture and I think this is a good
[24:22] place to start she was mentioned in
[24:24] Genesis chapter 3 and I want this to be
[24:26] a good place to start again I know this
[24:28] is review it's a great time to do it on
[24:29] a Wednesday night you're all well taught
[24:31] you're at every Service uh and you've
[24:33] been doing so for decades so there's a
[24:35] lot of material we can just quickly grab
[24:37] for and be on the same page in Genesis
[24:39] CH 3: 7
[24:43] to10 it says now this is after the man
[24:46] and his wife the man and the woman we
[24:47] come to know her as Eve later that she
[24:51] has partaken and that which was
[24:53] forbidden and she then brings to Adam
[24:56] now in the the anal ology of taking
[24:58] fruit they've both now partaken it says
[25:01] and the eyes of them both were opened
[25:04] and they knew that they were naked and
[25:06] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[25:08] themselves aprons I'll read this and
[25:10] I'll come back maybe to trying to look
[25:12] at the 10,000 foot View and they heard
[25:14] the voice of the Lord God Walking In The
[25:17] Garden in the cool of the day if we
[25:20] could somehow try to put ourselves in
[25:22] their shoes prior to that moment to a
[25:25] prior cool of the day right and what
[25:28] kind of emotions must they have
[25:29] experienced when this God was making
[25:32] himself known through his voice and his
[25:34] voice would come walking in the garden
[25:36] in the cool of the day and brother Brown
[25:38] dramatizing this is something that he
[25:39] would have done in that evening time in
[25:41] the cool of the day his he would have
[25:43] declared his presence with his voice and
[25:45] come walking in the garden and this
[25:47] might have been something that they
[25:48] would have looked forward to and
[25:49] embraced and it would have been that
[25:50] special time of the day it says and Adam
[25:53] and his wife hid themselves from the
[25:55] presence of the Lord God amongst the
[25:57] Trees of the G Garden that'd be like if
[25:59] somebody was being accused of uh tagging
[26:03] uh something with some graffiti hiding
[26:04] themselves in a spray can uh closet
[26:07] right probably not probably wasn't fruit
[26:09] of a tree that they actually partook in
[26:11] because then to hide yourself in the
[26:12] cookie jar when you bit accused of
[26:14] eating cookies it's not a smart
[26:16] idea but here they hide themselves from
[26:19] the presence of the Lord and the Lord
[26:21] God calls them to Adam and says to him
[26:22] where art thou God's not you know God's
[26:25] not like seriously this is a genu in
[26:27] Game of hideand-seek and God doesn't
[26:29] know where they are but it provoked
[26:30] something from Adam and he said I heard
[26:33] thy voice in the garden and I was afraid
[26:37] because I was naked and I hid myself so
[26:40] much that we can draw from this even in
[26:42] the future to use this to Central on
[26:44] this idea of
[26:46] fear but as we look at this and we try
[26:48] to look at in the bigger picture we know
[26:50] that Adam and the woman lived in a world
[26:51] of perfect love brother Bram describes
[26:53] it that way and there was perfect peace
[26:56] all around him there's no fear of death
[26:57] there's no fear of judgment this is the
[26:59] world that God loved and every evening
[27:01] God would come down in the cool of the
[27:02] evening have fellowship with his
[27:04] creation fellowship with man and the
[27:06] woman this would have been something
[27:07] that they looked forward to that they
[27:08] would have embraced that they would have
[27:10] run to but now because sin enters in it
[27:13] now sin precedes fear and sin preceding
[27:18] fear there's a dread or a tear in their
[27:20] heart and now they are viewing God
[27:23] incorrectly towards like oh I'm naked I
[27:26] got to hide myself I don't want to put
[27:29] myself at the mercy of God I want to
[27:30] hide from him I don't want to beg for
[27:31] his forgiveness I want to avoid them
[27:33] altogether and this fear drove them away
[27:36] from God who was and still is love love
[27:40] Came walking into the garden that
[27:41] evening love came that way and it was
[27:44] this love that was being projected and
[27:46] they ran from it hid themselves from it
[27:48] and I want you to look at this this is
[27:50] the origin story of
[27:53] hate in this very moment where there's
[27:56] sin which is preceded by fear it's this
[27:58] very situation that is then going to be
[28:01] the origin story of hate for
[28:04] Humanity maybe we'll come back to some
[28:06] of these elements later on
[28:08] fear but now as we continue to read
[28:11] brother brah says that God came down in
[28:13] this great big funnel called love and
[28:16] you're all familiar with that when
[28:17] brother man talks about how it's love
[28:19] that's being Spoken Here in Genesis 3
[28:21] when there's a curse being given it says
[28:23] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[28:25] because thou Hast done this Thou Art
[28:27] cursed above all cattle and above every
[28:29] beast of the field upon thy belly shalt
[28:31] thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the
[28:33] days of thy life and I will put enmity
[28:36] between thee and the woman and between
[28:38] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[28:40] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[28:43] this is a prophecy of Jesus Christ these
[28:45] are the very things that the angels are
[28:47] pointing back to and they say on Earth
[28:48] peace and Good Will to men because now
[28:51] love has come down and it's going to
[28:53] it's brought forth a baby and a manger
[28:55] and the birth of Christ is on Earth
[28:57] peace peace and Good Will to men it is
[28:59] the Fulfillment of this prophecy that
[29:01] there will come the seed of the woman
[29:03] who's going to crush the Serpent's head
[29:05] but it's going to bruise his heel this
[29:07] is a prophecy of redemption this is
[29:10] love but right as love is being
[29:13] expressed through the promise of a
[29:15] redeemer he introduces the word hatred
[29:18] right I will put hatred between thee and
[29:22] the woman and hatred between thy seed
[29:24] and her seed the word there enmity is
[29:26] simply hatred
[29:28] comes from the Hebrew to be hostile to
[29:31] to be an enemy
[29:33] to I will put hostility hatred I will
[29:38] make thee an enemy to the woman and
[29:40] between thy seed and her seed there's
[29:42] going to be Warfare there's going to be
[29:44] opposition there's going to be animosity
[29:46] there's going to be disagreement there's
[29:47] going to be
[29:49] hate now I hope I'm not presenting
[29:51] something to you that you feel to be
[29:55] after I already said nothing new right
[29:56] now I'm going to present present
[29:57] something to you that I hope isn't so
[29:59] foreign or put it in a way that seems
[30:01] that is foreign to you but it's not that
[30:04] God it isn't that God is making them
[30:06] hate
[30:07] right but love is
[30:10] leaving When God Says When God says I'm
[30:13] going to put enmity it's not that God's
[30:16] going to you know reach into his bag of
[30:17] hate and put that in the serpent and
[30:19] it's not that God's going to reach over
[30:21] here and and pass out you know pass out
[30:24] more hatred you know kind of as the
[30:26] story goes for me when God was passing
[30:28] out noses I thought he said hoses and I
[30:29] asked for a long one it wasn't that God
[30:32] was giving out hate at that moment it
[30:34] was God saying now that you have done
[30:37] this you're going to be subject to your
[30:39] base nature and your base instincts
[30:42] whatever can influence you you're going
[30:43] to be subject to it you're no longer
[30:45] going to be connected to a higher power
[30:46] your channels are no longer going to be
[30:48] completely clear where you're in tune
[30:49] with the Divine you're going to become
[30:51] unhinged from this higher purpose and so
[30:53] it wasn't that God was going to make
[30:55] them hate but because his love was
[30:57] leaving he knew they would be subject to
[30:59] the worst Humanity would be untethered
[31:03] from a higher purpose and therefore
[31:05] they'd have to fight against
[31:07] hatred fight against competition and
[31:10] jealousy because it's not that this
[31:12] competition or this Warfare began in the
[31:14] garden it says in Revelations 12: 7 8
[31:17] and9 and there was war in heaven Michael
[31:20] and his angels fought against the dragon
[31:22] and the dragon fought and his angels and
[31:24] prevailed not neither was their place
[31:27] found anymore in heaven their place
[31:28] found anymore in heaven so now this
[31:30] Warfare which began in Satan this
[31:32] Warfare that began with his pride in his
[31:33] own self-estimation it's detesting the
[31:36] will of God it's now can no longer be in
[31:38] heaven it's cast down to earth and the
[31:39] Great Dragon was cast out that old
[31:41] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[31:43] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[31:45] out into the Earth and his angels were
[31:47] cast out with
[31:49] him this is now the very influence
[31:52] behind behind the serpent what began as
[31:54] a war in Heaven Is Now cast down to
[31:56] earth so when Jesus When God says I will
[31:58] put enity between thee and the woman
[32:01] this is a declaration of war on Earth
[32:03] between God's kingdom and Satan's
[32:05] kingdom verse 15 say there's going to be
[32:07] war on Earth there wasn't a war on Earth
[32:09] in the beginning before man fell but now
[32:12] that man falls God's saying there's
[32:14] hatred
[32:15] now I I I I don't need to necessarily
[32:18] take the gene of hate and put it in you
[32:20] it's it's sowed it's there and this hate
[32:24] then is the fruit of this hostility this
[32:26] opposition in this
[32:28] Warfare now I I realize just how quickly
[32:32] I I may be just brushing right over that
[32:34] that's the origin story for
[32:37] hate the hate we experience today which
[32:39] is spiteful and malicious and
[32:41] mean-spirited and vindictive and jealous
[32:45] comes all the way back to this now it
[32:48] may not seem like in a lot of ways we
[32:49] might feel that we're justified in our
[32:50] hate or well it has a different story
[32:52] but when we begin to experience these
[32:54] overwhelming emotions of this negative
[32:56] impulse and this visceral reaction to
[32:58] something and we grit our teeth and we
[33:00] want to see something destroyed or we
[33:01] want to burn something up or throw a
[33:04] moltov cocktail into that restaurant uh
[33:06] that we hate we got to that's that's
[33:08] something that came from this
[33:12] here because hate is the fruit of this
[33:14] Warfare that God declares in Genesis
[33:17] 3:15 but starts out there if I can put
[33:20] it this way there's and and we'll look
[33:21] at it in the scripture there's this very
[33:23] specific Warfare wherein hate is an El
[33:27] of Satan's kingdom against God's kingdom
[33:29] but it it just it doesn't stop there it
[33:31] becomes chaotic where hate just pervades
[33:34] everywhere it's like and Hate Now Satan
[33:36] just realized he's the master of chaos
[33:38] if I can just get everybody hating my
[33:40] job is
[33:43] successful in Genesis 4:
[33:46] 5-9 we watch this hate come
[33:49] up as the both Abel and Cain offer
[33:53] sacrifices to God and Abel's is
[33:55] recognized by God and God shows respect
[33:58] and vindicates his
[34:00] offering Cain experiences this these
[34:03] emotions and what the
[34:05] Bible does not say I think we should
[34:07] read into it doesn't say that Cain got
[34:10] depressed and he's very Solen and began
[34:13] to reflect inwardly and begin to develop
[34:14] low self-esteem and and doing so became
[34:17] very uh subservient to Abel his older
[34:20] his younger brother and from that day on
[34:22] looked up to Abel as a hero and Abel
[34:24] manipulated him from that day forward
[34:26] there's a lot that it doesn't say and I
[34:27] think we could read into that by show
[34:29] showing that the very thing that ha that
[34:31] uh Cain experiences is this anger
[34:34] towards his brother right and says that
[34:37] the Lord Cain God did not have respect
[34:40] unto Cain in his offering and says and
[34:42] Cain was very wroth and his countenance
[34:45] fell he's
[34:46] angry and the Lord said unto Cain why
[34:49] are you angry why is your countenance
[34:52] Fallen why are you so sad if thou doest
[34:55] W now here's an outlet here's an Escape
[34:57] Thou shalt not shalt not be accepted and
[34:59] if thou doest not well sin lith at the
[35:01] door and unto thee shall be his desire
[35:04] and thou shalt rule over him God is now
[35:07] kind of provoking gain do you recognize
[35:09] what's happening you're angry you're
[35:10] upset why are you angry why are you mad
[35:13] why are you hating unel all you have to
[35:16] do is do
[35:17] well I I I really do want the Holy
[35:20] Spirit to do with your hearts to
[35:22] recognize that in this situation in this
[35:24] instance something has happened Cain is
[35:26] experiencing his very real emotions this
[35:28] very intense negative feeling and it's
[35:31] and it's I'm I'm suggesting tonight that
[35:33] his anger is being projected not just to
[35:36] God but to Abel and that he's developing
[35:38] this hatred this animosity this
[35:40] bitterness of my younger brother and he
[35:42] did this and he did that and and now
[35:44] he's building up this big complex
[35:45] towards his brother and after God has
[35:48] now tried to provoke him said consider
[35:50] what's going on here all you have to do
[35:52] is do what's
[35:53] right let go of the anger let go of the
[35:56] bitterness let go of the comparison let
[35:58] go of the fact that I Vindicated this
[36:00] one and not you just do what's right
[36:01] you'll get your just reward and you and
[36:03] your Vindication but he can't do it so
[36:05] the Bible says and Cain talked with Abel
[36:07] his brother why did he go talk with Abel
[36:10] because that was that was part of the
[36:12] object of his hate he was angry with
[36:15] Abel I don't know what it was that he
[36:17] said but we know it's an expression of
[36:19] his anger that came to pass when they
[36:21] were in the field that Cain rose up
[36:23] against Abel his brother and slew him
[36:27] here's this murderer in the beginning
[36:29] and the Lord said un to Cain where is
[36:31] Abel thy brother God has this habit of
[36:34] asking
[36:35] questions when man has sinned he asked
[36:38] Adam where are you in face of fear now
[36:41] he's asking Cain where's your brother in
[36:43] the face of hate and notice the response
[36:47] is this not telling and he said I don't
[36:50] know am I am I My Brother's Keeper do I
[36:53] have to look out after him am I am I the
[36:55] one that's supposed to be watching out
[36:56] over him am I the one that has to answer
[36:59] for him it shows the hate that he had in
[37:03] his heart I think it's been said in a
[37:05] number of different places as I've been
[37:06] studying on hatred it comes up quite a
[37:08] bit but it's been said that indifference
[37:10] is the opposite of
[37:12] hate and I could see that in the sense
[37:14] that indifference would almost be as
[37:16] just as
[37:17] dismissive or indifference is the
[37:19] opposite of Love might be the other way
[37:20] of putting it like when you if you
[37:21] really don't like something just being
[37:23] IND different towards it I I could see
[37:25] the Nuance to that I could see the
[37:26] argument
[37:27] but here Cain's hatred is expressed an
[37:31] indifference what do I have to look out
[37:33] after him so maybe maybe we need to
[37:36] challenge ourselves that when we really
[37:38] don't care if we're saying well I'm just
[37:39] kind of cold on it and there's really no
[37:41] feeling and there's no real unction
[37:43] there's no real prayer or burden or you
[37:45] feel kind of neutral about something
[37:46] maybe it's worth challenging ourselves
[37:48] whether or not it's rooted in hate or is
[37:49] it really just Indi
[37:53] difference and so here he is disavowing
[37:56] his brother
[37:57] brother he is angry he murders his
[38:00] brother with
[38:01] hatred and he's just indifferent
[38:03] disavows it am I My Brother's Keeper
[38:05] comes across says it does hey I I
[38:07] wouldn't even know because I don't even
[38:08] care about
[38:10] him and there's a lot of places we could
[38:12] draw from to express this I think this
[38:14] statement says it well and does God ever
[38:16] change his mind about his
[38:18] word he's talking about the difference
[38:20] between Jacob and Esau Jacob his whole
[38:22] soul was to get that birth right and
[38:25] that's what God recognized him in his
[38:27] spiritual in him
[38:30] spiritual brother Bren in the preceding
[38:32] paragraphs is talking about how that
[38:36] uh Esau was probably a better man and a
[38:40] better person in some ways by certain
[38:42] metrics and integrities and things and
[38:44] say well he probably would have made a
[38:45] better son or a harder worker but there
[38:47] was something about uh Jacob's attitude
[38:50] towards the birthright that pleased
[38:52] God and so in some it has something to
[38:55] do with your affections your desires
[38:57] what you put preeminence on and and and
[38:59] again God it says God hates Esau and
[39:02] then this he's showing how where Jacob
[39:05] had his desire towards one thing and how
[39:07] it pits him against Esau notice and it's
[39:10] always caused the natural to hate the
[39:13] spiritual it caused Cain to hate
[39:17] Abel it caused Kora to hate Moses it
[39:21] caused Judas to hate Jesus and on and on
[39:24] it goes now this is the origin story of
[39:28] hate now we may not have the same
[39:31] spiritual
[39:32] justifications we may not be expressing
[39:34] in terms of well they hate me because
[39:36] I'm super spiritual even though you've
[39:37] probably all said that it's not that
[39:39] we're put in spiritual terms but we're
[39:41] talking about hate that resides even in
[39:42] the hearts of Believers that the Lord's
[39:44] wanting to root out and wanting to help
[39:45] with us with it has its Genesis in this
[39:49] origin story of Cain hating
[39:52] Abel says and on and on it goes It
[39:54] causes the natural to hate the the
[39:56] spiritual just as Cain at the beginning
[39:59] hated Abel the one that God received the
[40:02] Sacrifice from and tries to destroy them
[40:06] hate tries to destroy it says even they
[40:08] try to destroy the influence they try to
[40:10] destroy everything because it's nothing
[40:12] but jealousy it started in Cain and
[40:15] proved that it was jealousy and it's
[40:16] still the same thing today when the
[40:18] natural the carnal and the spiritual
[40:19] meet together it proves it Satan no
[40:22] other way because jealousy comes from
[40:24] Satan I hope you're catching this
[40:27] that to where we might feel that in our
[40:29] lives there's something benign or even
[40:31] Justified where I have this intense
[40:32] hatred for this person because of this
[40:35] situation and where there is that hatred
[40:37] that has Affinity to Satan we got to
[40:39] recognize how it's built into fear and
[40:41] jealousy and these other things and how
[40:43] we've actually allowed ourselves for
[40:45] evil to overcome Us in the face of evil
[40:49] because in Romans as we read it don't
[40:51] let be don't let uh respond to evil with
[40:53] evil and don't over try to don't be over
[40:56] overcome with evil in your response
[40:58] because evil can if we're not careful
[41:01] provoke an evil response of hatred
[41:03] within us and it's easy to rationalize
[41:06] because of the way we've been made to
[41:07] feel and we way that the way that begins
[41:09] to come up in our hearts but remember
[41:11] the Genesis of hate is in the heart of
[41:15] Cain and we could say would it
[41:18] been would Cain have been just in
[41:21] murdering a
[41:24] Cain would Abel have been just to murder
[41:29] Cain I said well that just seems like a
[41:31] real silly
[41:32] question find out whatever Paradigm you
[41:36] operate
[41:37] by you might find that there could be
[41:39] some reflex in you to be like Cain was
[41:42] wrong to kill Abel but
[41:45] Abel maybe he would have been
[41:48] just to kill
[41:51] Cain in the heart of this he said it
[41:53] started in Cain hatred it proves it's
[41:57] Satan he's saying and then he says it
[41:59] because jealousy comes from Satan and
[42:01] then causes an impersonation of the
[42:02] truth somebody to try to impersonate
[42:04] something that isn't and they're not
[42:06] ordained to do how much of that we have
[42:09] seen in these last days oh my how much
[42:11] of it he's talking about impersonation
[42:14] but kind of the the the path to
[42:17] impersonation is through hatred and
[42:19] jealousy and hatred the path is through
[42:21] that competition that Spite that desire
[42:24] to overthrow something the to be better
[42:26] than something the desire to be
[42:28] presented as more spiritual the desire
[42:29] to be presented as better it doesn't
[42:31] have its roots in wanting to please God
[42:33] it has its roots in hatred and and
[42:35] Malice and spitefulness and
[42:38] envy Bible addressing this headon as it
[42:41] has its origin in the original sin in
[42:43] Leviticus 19: 1718 Thou shalt not hate
[42:46] thy brother in thy heart isn't it
[42:48] amazing it's having to tell you not to
[42:50] do
[42:52] it why would it have to say thou shalt
[42:54] not kill because man in his Fallen
[42:56] nature rationalizes about
[43:00] murder we also do the same when it comes
[43:02] to hate so the the God has to say you
[43:05] shall not hate your brother in thine
[43:07] heart Thou shalt not in any wise rebuke
[43:08] thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon
[43:11] Him Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy
[43:14] neighbor and not suffer sin upon him
[43:16] what beautiful balance Thou shalt not
[43:18] avenge nor bear any grudge against the
[43:21] children of thy people but Thou shalt
[43:23] love thy neighbor as thyself I am the
[43:25] Lord amen High
[43:28] Praise this is where it got the Jews in
[43:31] trouble because they said wow who is Thy
[43:33] Neighbor why did they begin to split
[43:35] hairs about who their neighbor was is
[43:37] they wanted to justify hate for a group
[43:39] of people so they wanted to be able to
[43:41] carve out whether not they were actually
[43:42] a neighbor I want to love this one I
[43:45] want to love that one and I want to love
[43:47] my neighbor but I want to hate this one
[43:48] and say well isn't he your neighbor no
[43:50] not
[43:51] technically not technically my neighbor
[43:53] he lives across the street it's the ones
[43:54] that live on the side of me that are my
[43:56] neighbors there was just some way of
[43:58] trying to trying to distill water down
[44:00] and make a distinction so they could
[44:02] justify their hate justify their lack of
[44:04] care well who who is my
[44:07] neighbor oh really who you know who is
[44:09] it in order to cover up
[44:12] malice but here as God is challenging
[44:15] the Israelites writing this in their law
[44:17] don't hate your brother in your heart
[44:19] because it's not right don't avenge
[44:21] don't bear a grudge love thy neighbor as
[44:23] thyself as Jesus said you've heard it
[44:25] before love thy uh brother and hate thy
[44:28] enemies he says but no do good to them
[44:30] that despitefully use
[44:32] you trying to wrap this up on this
[44:35] origin of hate let's look at 1 John
[44:37] chapter 3 veres 10 to 19 this is a
[44:41] long several
[44:47] scriptures notice how John now is
[44:49] writing this he says in this the
[44:51] children of God are
[44:52] manifest and the children of the devil
[44:56] whosoever doeth not righteousness is not
[44:58] of God neither he that loveth not his
[45:01] brother so if you don't love your
[45:04] brother whom you have seen he said you
[45:06] can't be of
[45:08] God for this is the message that you
[45:10] heard from the beginning that we should
[45:11] love one another that's that's
[45:13] consistent with what Christ taught it's
[45:14] consistent with what we see in the Old
[45:16] Testament not as
[45:19] Cain in bringing this distinction of the
[45:21] kind of love that we ought to have in
[45:23] our hearts and I would like to say not
[45:24] just the love that we have for our
[45:25] brother
[45:26] but the love that we have for our
[45:28] neighbor he is saying Cain unlike Cain
[45:31] who is of that Wicked one and slew his
[45:33] brother and why did he murder
[45:36] him now this is I'm getting I'm wanting
[45:39] to introduce all this and tell them the
[45:40] origin story of hate to recognize how
[45:44] that it also begins in us he says he
[45:46] hated him because his Works were evil
[45:49] and his brothers righteous it was by
[45:51] means of comparison that caused Cain to
[45:55] hate his brother
[45:56] says Marvel not my breth if the world
[45:58] hate you now he just kind of brings it
[45:59] right into what Christ was saying we
[46:01] know that we have passed from death into
[46:02] life because we love the brother he that
[46:04] loveth not his brother abideth in
[46:07] death whosoever hateth his brother is a
[46:10] murderer whether you raise a knife or
[46:12] whether you raise a stone whether you
[46:14] actually take life or shed blood if you
[46:17] hate your brother you are a murderer you
[46:18] are related to the emotions of Cain in
[46:20] the beginning and you know that no
[46:22] murderer hath eternal life abiding in
[46:24] him that is strong
[46:26] language if you hate your brother You're
[46:29] a murderer and you can't have eternal
[46:31] life very
[46:34] strong I hope that
[46:37] moderates the language of our children
[46:39] siblings when they say to one another I
[46:41] hate
[46:44] you and just how what that's associated
[46:48] with he says hereby perceive with the
[46:50] love of God because he laid down his
[46:51] life for us we ought to lay down our
[46:53] lives for the Brethren but who so hath
[46:55] this world's good
[46:56] world's good and seeth his brother have
[46:58] need and shutteth up his bowels of
[46:59] compassion from him how dwelleth the
[47:01] love of God in him my little children
[47:03] let us not love in word neither in
[47:05] tongue but in deed and in truth and
[47:07] hereby we know that we are of the truth
[47:09] and shall assure our hearts before him
[47:11] and he begins to talk about if our
[47:13] hearts condemn
[47:14] us but this is quite an exposition in
[47:18] this the children of God are manifest
[47:19] and the children of the devil we've gone
[47:22] to Great Lengths this year in dealing
[47:23] with perfect love to not turn a turn
[47:26] perfect love into a litmus test that we
[47:28] use to dechristianize ourselves or push
[47:30] us out of the faith but as a challenge
[47:32] uh to raise the standard of the love of
[47:34] God in our hearts to challenge ourselves
[47:37] to free the love of God in our hearts
[47:38] and so I wouldn't want to read this in
[47:40] any way where you say I have very strong
[47:42] intense hatred for this person then I
[47:44] must not be a Christian I must not have
[47:45] eternal life but it's to challenge us in
[47:47] our own instincts and inclinations to
[47:49] realize that if I do have hatred in my
[47:52] heart perfect love hasn't worked its way
[47:54] into that spot to push it
[47:58] out brother Bram said it this way in the
[48:00] church as the children of this world
[48:02] controlled by the devil hate the
[48:03] children of God who are controlled by
[48:05] the
[48:05] spirit so hatred had this kind of
[48:09] animosity this kind of uh spitefulness
[48:13] and maliciousness I'm using the word
[48:15] hate to cover so many different emotions
[48:16] a brother shared with me this week how
[48:18] hatred has so many different other names
[48:20] and representations and it's very very
[48:22] true so this kind of emotional
[48:24] expression and however way it works its
[48:26] way out into other emotions and feelings
[48:28] it's something controlled by the
[48:31] devil to be used by the devil against
[48:34] the children of God and so when we begin
[48:36] to pick up that tool I want you to catch
[48:38] this when we pick up that tool we're
[48:40] using an instrument of the devil which
[48:43] is hatred to bring an offense to against
[48:45] the children of God so it's not a tool a
[48:48] child of God needs to
[48:51] use and why does it
[48:53] exist because love was left left in the
[48:56] beginning amen as we look at all these
[48:59] things I realize now I need to kind of
[49:00] fill in all some of these gaps to try to
[49:02] close that hatred found place when love
[49:06] left yeah when love isn't operating we
[49:10] give an opportunity for hate to work and
[49:12] once hate gets to work peace
[49:14] leaves and we find it here as Jesus
[49:17] deals with it as we see brother Benham
[49:18] talking about it when the Bible in
[49:20] Leviticus 19 all these different places
[49:21] you notice where it talks about love and
[49:23] it talks about hate why because as long
[49:25] as you have strong love it can it can it
[49:28] can produce the right kind of
[49:30] hate but as soon as that starts to leave
[49:33] the wrong kind of hate
[49:34] festers unless you think I'm trying to
[49:37] accuse all of us of hate I'll just say
[49:38] the wrong kind of hate can
[49:41] Fester hate came because the love
[49:45] left I want to just uh I want to go a
[49:48] little bit further tonight I think we've
[49:49] done well on time and we have the time
[49:50] to do it brother B writes this in the
[49:52] church age book he says elect cannot
[49:55] person
[49:56] elect elect cannot harm
[49:59] elect it is the reprobates that
[50:01] persecute and destroy the elect oh those
[50:05] reprobates are religious they are
[50:09] smart they are of the canline the
[50:12] serpent
[50:13] seed they build their bables they build
[50:15] their cities they build their Empires
[50:18] and all the while calling on God wrong
[50:20] kind of Kingdom Builders they hate the
[50:23] true
[50:24] seed and will do all they can even in
[50:27] the name of the Lord to destroy God's
[50:30] elect ones I want you to recognize that
[50:33] hatred is related to
[50:36] Cain that hatred is born from the sin in
[50:39] the beginning and God says I'll put
[50:40] enity between thy seed and her seed the
[50:43] seed of the woman and so hatred exists
[50:45] because the love of God lost its place
[50:47] this perfect world had become fallen and
[50:49] where you find hate first rearing its
[50:51] head in act in activity and action
[50:54] against another it's embodied in Cain
[50:57] it's now in the flesh of Cain and he's
[50:58] wroth and he's angry and he acts on his
[51:00] anger to take his brother's life and
[51:02] John picks it up and says if you hate
[51:03] your brother you're acting like Cain
[51:05] who's a murderer because if you hate
[51:06] your brother you are a
[51:08] murderer so this hatred is from Cain
[51:11] they hate the true
[51:13] seed to me I it makes sense in my mind
[51:16] but I realize it's kind of a concept
[51:18] that's hard to express I wanted to put
[51:20] it this way that hate is what it is and
[51:23] it begins its original use in utility
[51:26] and the reason why it even exists in the
[51:27] world today is because of
[51:30] sin and so this kind of hatred we're
[51:32] talking about is kind of very really
[51:34] Niche or Niche however you want to say
[51:36] it you know this is what it is but now
[51:38] we've co-opted it to use it in all other
[51:39] ways I got to hate for this I got hate
[51:41] for that I got hate for this I got hate
[51:42] for that it's like really that hatred
[51:45] that you now have for all these other
[51:46] people and all these other things and
[51:47] all these other ways and this hatred
[51:49] that's really eating you up do you
[51:50] realize that that hate is designed in
[51:54] the beginning for murder right that that
[51:57] hate in the beginning was fashioned in
[51:58] the heart in the heart of Cain by Wicked
[52:01] influence and now it exists in
[52:03] everyone's heart but it really it's a
[52:05] tool for murder really what it is is a
[52:07] tool to destroy it's a tool to hate and
[52:09] so if you hate Then You're a murderer
[52:11] and I'll say this and come to it later
[52:13] if you're you say well I haven't killed
[52:15] anybody you're killing yourself that's
[52:17] good
[52:19] amen yes because they hate the true seed
[52:22] this is what the Hate's used for you say
[52:25] why I hate this person I I hate him as a
[52:27] holy spirit filled person you hate him
[52:29] yes I hate him you have in your heart
[52:32] that which is in the heart of Cain on it
[52:36] doesn't belong in your heart it has no
[52:38] place in a believer's heart that kind of
[52:40] hate is for one purpose to destroy the
[52:43] truth and so it destroys
[52:47] you brother Brandon writes this in this
[52:51] moury in church age he really covers
[52:52] this a lot in chapter four of the church
[52:54] age book and and he says and when this
[52:57] Satan centered group was formed in this
[52:58] age he says it began to hate and to
[53:00] fight the True Believers it's just their
[53:02] nature they
[53:04] quarrel they
[53:06] fight when you become a a a friend of
[53:09] God when you become a Son of God when
[53:11] you become a Christian uh you don't you
[53:14] don't make a bunch of enemies you don't
[53:15] declare war on sin the war is declared
[53:17] on you you've taken your place and
[53:20] you've you've sided with
[53:22] truth and so it's this it's it's in them
[53:26] to
[53:27] hate you become a Christian Your
[53:29] Instinct isn't like one day you're just
[53:32] kind of hanging out with your buddy and
[53:33] you guys are you know doing some lines
[53:34] or whatever it is you do and you get the
[53:36] Holy Ghost and the next day you see your
[53:37] friend I hate you you
[53:39] druggy usually what you do is you're
[53:41] like man I want you to be free like I'm
[53:43] free I don't want you to be bound by
[53:45] that and where the hatred comes from is
[53:47] usually from those you're trying to love
[53:50] CU they misunderstand you they feel like
[53:52] you feel like you're better than them so
[53:53] let's not let the hate be enough us but
[53:56] it begins to hate and to fight the True
[53:57] Believers insisting that they the aliens
[53:59] were the church of god notice how
[54:01] organization breeds
[54:05] hatred
[54:07] Ponder think of this organization breeds
[54:11] hatred so we begin to have our movement
[54:14] organized that's it it breeds hatred why
[54:16] because when you become organized other
[54:19] organizations or anything else outside
[54:21] your org right Pros a threat right
[54:26] and so therefore just by organizing it
[54:28] breeds hatred within the ranks within
[54:30] the Empire within the city brother BR
[54:32] talks about the build their Bibles their
[54:33] cities their Empires and hate Rises up
[54:36] within that that petri dish of an
[54:38] organization it's part of the culture it
[54:40] must exist in order to
[54:42] survive in order to defend itself it
[54:46] hates and because organization breeds
[54:48] hatred it says it destroys Fellowship it
[54:50] makes
[54:51] bitterness that is what myrr means this
[54:54] is what but Smyrna was full of
[54:57] bitterness a root of bitterness defiles
[55:00] many I want you to look at how he
[55:01] brought it first to hate it began to
[55:04] hate organization breeds hate hate
[55:05] destroys Fellowship the destruction of
[55:07] Fellowship breeds
[55:09] bitterness so more and more defilement
[55:12] was coming in every age would feel its
[55:17] scars the scars of what hatred right and
[55:21] we could show by the word of God and
[55:23] from a number of statements that just
[55:24] inspired me as I've studied this that
[55:26] the hatred has increased to its Max in
[55:28] this
[55:29] age the hatred of this false Vine This
[55:33] Satan group this hatred of Cain it's not
[55:35] it's not narrow it's not narrow just in
[55:38] religion and say oh boy the Catholics
[55:40] really hate the Christian and the
[55:42] Pentecostals really hate the message
[55:43] believer and and it's not just hate in
[55:46] this these microcosms of disagreements
[55:48] theologically it's the whole
[55:50] world the hatred is increased and we say
[55:52] it's the hatred of the false find it's
[55:54] the hatred of came but now it's in the
[55:56] the one who denies God now it's in the
[55:58] one that doesn't even believe in Jesus
[55:59] Christ it's the hatred that began in the
[56:01] beginning now pervades
[56:03] everything says in 2 Timothy 3: 1-5 this
[56:07] know also that in the last days perilous
[56:09] times shall come Fierce times difficult
[56:12] times for men shall be and this whole
[56:15] language to me is so descriptive men
[56:17] shall be lovers of their own selves
[56:19] Covetous boaster proud blasphemers
[56:21] disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy
[56:24] without natural affection truce Breakers
[56:26] false accusers incontinent Fierce
[56:28] despisers of those that are good
[56:32] haters of those that are good the Hebrew
[56:35] word the way it's written is it's
[56:37] against the hate their enemies to those
[56:38] that are good traitors heady high-m
[56:41] minded lovers of Pleasures more than
[56:43] lovers of
[56:44] God having a form of godliness but but
[56:47] denying the power thereof from such turn
[56:51] away hatred is increased in this hour
[56:55] whatever seeds it begin with in Cain I'd
[56:57] say it's coming to its fullness in
[56:59] Satan's Eden Satan's Eden is an Eden of
[57:03] hatred if God's Eden was an Eden of
[57:05] perfect love Satan's Eden is an Eden of
[57:07] this imperfect
[57:09] hatred brother Bram said in Satan's Eden
[57:12] Now by unbelief in no taking all of the
[57:15] word and not taking all the word has
[57:17] brought a seed of unbelief Unholy sinful
[57:20] hatred and eternal death is in this
[57:22] sinful intellectual Church age
[57:25] he mentions it in several places about
[57:28] the hatred being associated with this in
[57:31] rejecting the word it's brought unbelief
[57:34] it's brought Eternal death it's brought
[57:36] things that are Unholy and sinful it's
[57:38] brought the
[57:42] hate this hatred it begins where there
[57:47] is no
[57:49] love that's why I'm asking the question
[57:51] where's the
[57:53] love brother BR I'm writing in the
[57:55] church age book Brothers you could come
[57:57] to your instruments he says those who
[57:58] fight the humble of God and scoff and
[58:01] Destroy let them do
[58:04] it and do it they
[58:06] will all in the name of God and religion
[58:10] and if I could say this to us as
[58:11] Believers just let those who fight the
[58:15] humble of God let them scoff and Destroy
[58:17] we don't need
[58:19] to let them do it and they will do it
[58:22] and all in the name of God and religion
[58:23] but they lie
[58:25] they're not of God they're of their
[58:27] father the devil they by their deeds
[58:30] against any people expose themselves for
[58:33] what they are now think of this this is
[58:35] to me very very rich let them organize
[58:38] and repudiate the little flock they're
[58:39] exposing themselves for what they are
[58:41] how do they expose themselves he's
[58:42] saying they organize they repudiate the
[58:44] little flock a lot of things that we
[58:45] could look at here is markers we're
[58:46] looking for a marker of something that
[58:49] shows what they are they but further
[58:53] reveal to all that they are of the devil
[58:54] devil they are false Vine the vine that
[58:58] murders and what proves it their hatred
[59:01] proves who they
[59:04] are what at the end of the day proves
[59:08] who they are
[59:10] hatred the nickan Antichrist church is
[59:13] who they
[59:14] are and whether they Nam themselves as
[59:18] such and you say well the Church of
[59:21] Satan this formal organization that's a
[59:23] theyve proved who they are by what they
[59:25] named
[59:26] themselves you identify Yourself by
[59:29] whether or not you have
[59:33] hate those who fight the humble of God
[59:36] and scoff and
[59:37] Destroy identify who they are by their
[59:41] hatred they're of their father the
[59:44] devil and they prove themselves by their
[59:48] hatred the false Vine is known by its
[59:53] hatred is that
[59:56] sobering is it sobering to think that
[59:59] when I have bitterness in my heart and I
[1:00:02] have animosity and I have resentment and
[1:00:04] I have this fear and this horror of
[1:00:07] something whatever it might be however
[1:00:09] it might present itself in your heart
[1:00:11] and we could kind of trace it back take
[1:00:13] its DNA look at its fingerprints and say
[1:00:15] oh wow at the core of it is this
[1:00:19] hatred is it so when to realize that has
[1:00:22] no place in my heart that's right
[1:00:25] that at the end of the day that's a mark
[1:00:27] of Satan that that's a mark of the
[1:00:29] Antichrist that's a mark of a nian
[1:00:31] spirit that that's not how God motivates
[1:00:33] and that's not the real love of God and
[1:00:35] I can no longer use religion to justify
[1:00:37] and I can't say well God's a holy God
[1:00:38] and God's a vengful God and God's a god
[1:00:39] of righteous and God God of this and God
[1:00:41] God that and we're using God as an
[1:00:42] excuse to actually hate apart from
[1:00:45] perfect love it's worth challenging
[1:00:49] ourselves I share this in closing it's
[1:00:52] also in that part in chapter 4 the
[1:00:54] church age book there's so much to read
[1:00:56] from in that I I would really encourage
[1:00:58] maybe some to go back and read it in
[1:01:00] these paragraphs I've cut out quite a
[1:01:01] bit but he's talking about how in the
[1:01:04] Old Testament the worshipper would offer
[1:01:06] sacrifice and be identified with his
[1:01:08] sacrifice and still leave with the same
[1:01:09] feelings in his heart you could be
[1:01:11] jealous against your neighbor you could
[1:01:13] have offended you could have done all
[1:01:14] these things the Bible says don't hate
[1:01:15] your neighbor don't hate your brother
[1:01:17] and you could have all this guilt in
[1:01:18] your heart so you go and you offer
[1:01:19] sacrifice and your sins have been atoned
[1:01:21] but you'd walk away a
[1:01:23] hater says but in the New Testament it's
[1:01:25] not
[1:01:26] so our dying lamb is the Son of God who
[1:01:29] gave his blood a ransom for many by
[1:01:31] faith we walk up and place our hands
[1:01:33] upon that lamb we see him with the
[1:01:35] bloody wounds the lacerated back the
[1:01:37] cruel Thorns tearing his brow we feel
[1:01:40] his pain and hear him cry my God my God
[1:01:43] why hast Thou forsaken me hatred did
[1:01:46] that hatred put him on the
[1:01:48] cross hatred crucified him he said what
[1:01:51] happened the life that left that broken
[1:01:53] blood cell came back upon the repentant
[1:01:56] one
[1:01:57] you the life that was in him come back
[1:02:00] upon us we go back with no more desire
[1:02:03] to
[1:02:04] sin and now we possess a hatred for the
[1:02:07] works and lust of the
[1:02:10] Flesh and just in an odd
[1:02:13] twist one of those works of the flesh is
[1:02:16] hatred so when we really come under the
[1:02:18] influence of the work of redemption we
[1:02:21] hate
[1:02:22] hate that's what I that's what I hate I
[1:02:26] possess a hatred for the works and the
[1:02:28] lust of the flesh it it's a hatred that
[1:02:30] God has because he loves righteousness
[1:02:32] it's a hatred that I possess because of
[1:02:34] the work of the Cross and the grace that
[1:02:35] was in my life and when I have that kind
[1:02:37] of hate and it's centered because of the
[1:02:39] grace IED in Calvary when I have that
[1:02:41] kind of hate because it's centered in
[1:02:42] the Forgiveness I've experienced in the
[1:02:44] shedding of his blood when I have that
[1:02:45] kind of hate it cannot work evil it will
[1:02:49] not work malice it will not work
[1:02:50] jealousy it will not try to destroy or
[1:02:52] to tear down or injure in some sort of
[1:02:55] malicious spiteful way when I have that
[1:02:57] kind of love I can have the right kind
[1:02:59] of hate so God help me with the love of
[1:03:01] God in my heart if I can find that love
[1:03:04] then I can really find the right kind of
[1:03:05] hate and maybe I can begin to hate hate
[1:03:10] right and as odd as it may sound and
[1:03:12] paradoxal as it may sound say I hate it
[1:03:14] when I
[1:03:15] hate as it was said the the only thing
[1:03:19] we have to fear is fear itself and there
[1:03:20] seems to be some Paradox in that but yet
[1:03:23] it expresses this truth says we ought to
[1:03:25] detest
[1:03:27] hatred this hatred which is not of God a
[1:03:31] hatred that only exist in the absence of
[1:03:33] love the right kind of love the love of
[1:03:39] God so much more to get into keep
[1:03:42] praying that God would give us the right
[1:03:43] kind of Direction in this I know the
[1:03:44] Lord's dealing with hearts I know it's
[1:03:47] good for us Merry
[1:03:50] Christmas amen have the Lord have his
[1:03:53] Spirit just wash us
[1:03:55] or just as as brother uh Micah plate I
[1:03:58] think was creating me a clean heart when
[1:04:01] we were worshiping last Sunday it it's
[1:04:04] recognizing yeah there's this this spot
[1:04:06] in
[1:04:07] me that hates that resents which is
[1:04:11] which causes other emotions because
[1:04:13] there's a domino effect we've already
[1:04:15] looked at it already how brother BR
[1:04:17] begins to piece some of these things
[1:04:18] together for us and I want you to do
[1:04:19] that in your own heart as you let the
[1:04:20] Holy Spirit examine you say Lord just
[1:04:23] examine my heart I don't want to be
[1:04:24] guilty of the this kind of hate because
[1:04:25] this kind of hate we're talking about
[1:04:27] began in the wrong place I hope you
[1:04:30] could appreciate the origin story of
[1:04:32] hate let's stand together tonight
