TRANSCRIPT
========================================
2 Corinthians chapter 3 just want to touch on it again real quick how he says the uh you are our letter or what we have written what was in our hearts we wrote out and expressed it to you now you are read by others therefore you're are known by others and this is you are introducing me you're introducing the Christ rather that we have ministered Christ ministered by us and then he says we are able Ministers of the New Testament so it's the he's ministering a new testament now jumping right into this and just picking up I'm reading the one of the last quotes we read Sunday morning in Harvest Time brother bam saysthe son of man so he's focusing on Luke 17:30 again we're continued on the series of I am an open book he says the son of man the word living itself among the people the word itself made flesh in you and I love how brother bam so often when he's describing the revelation of the son of man he takes it further than just a son of man revealing the son of man or even uh the son of man maybe being revealed through his ministry or the sign of the son of man he's always bringing it down to where the individual can make a personal connection with the word of God being made manifest so he says it's the word itself made flesh in you you are reflection of this hour the message so we could say you are a reflection of the message of the hour he says a reflection of it exactly what Paul was saying in his day I preach to you I write to you I minister to you you live it out therefore you are introducing the Christ uh that we are ministering he says you are a reflection of the message you live again live the life that was in Jesus Christ and this is an emphasis now in the revealing of the son of man that we are revealing the word itself is made flesh in us we read a statement also where brother says every born again son and daughter of God of this age is the interpretation of the word we recognize in the scripture how Jesus Christ was the interpretation of the word of God he was the interpret of God's written word in the Old Testament and now he's saying that every born again son and daughter of God of this age is the interpretation of the word you'll find in many places brother Brandon is focusing on the promise of this day the promise of this hour the promise of this time and how we've got to fulfill the promise of the time that we're living in if we were living in the days of Luther we would be fulfilling the promise of justification that would be the mystery was being revealed the truth that was being restored so we would manif EST that and then we could see how sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost they had to live those things out so then it behooves us to take a step back and say well then what age are we living in what time are we living in what promise has to be manifest he said the Son and Daughters of this age are the interpretation of the word and we read it before brother brandom says in looking unto Jesus each generation reveals him in the full Revelation that's lotted for that time so each generation reveals him in the the Revelation that is given that is dispensed in that time and then he makes this beautiful statement this generation must reveal Jesus Christ so if the if justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes way for the Holy Ghost himself for Christ to step into the church he says this generation must reveal Jesus Christ and that's where we see all right if I'm a born again Son of God in this age I'm interpretation of the word my life is going to inter Christ in this age as we looked at it in John chapter 14 and I wanted to be very brief in my um summary how Jesus is saying that believe me for my work's sake I I speak unto you and you can believe me for my word's sake but my works also testify of me and we saw even how brother Bram said Jesus's life interpreted the word his life interpreted the word Christ The Works of Christ were the interpretation of the written word brother I said he interprets his own words now this let me say this why I want to read from doors and door Christ's actions interpreted the written words of the Old Testament so when it comes interpretation brother B says in doors and door he interprets his own words by making it live and vindicating it to be so so how is God going to interpret his word by making it live so God is not one that interprets it by by explaining to us it's not an explanation that interprets it but when God says let there be light and all the Angels could sit there and say well I wonder what Let There Be light's going to look like and God's going to say well what it's going to look like and what it means is and he could begin to try to describe it and they'd be like all right can you interpret the interpretation but when he brings it to pass you don't you can't argue with it do you realize right now we could take the word of God we could take quotations of the message there take the Bible and interpret what the Millennium is going to look like and we can do it all day long but then you'd still need an interpretation of our interpretation because we're not going to know exactly what it's like until God actually fulfills it and bring it to pass you say well brother brandham said such and such brother brandham prophesied well he's he's still a prophet and he's prophesying and so there can still be a symbolic representation in what he's prophesying so you're only going to know until God manifests it and brings it to pass so he interprets his word by making it live and vindicating it to be so so we've been looking at I am an open book we took Jesus Christ as the Fulfillment of the Old Testament we see that the bride is going to be the Fulfillment of the New Testament this new test opened up the Bible becoming a new book then there's a there's this interpretation in making the book live and in Christ is the mystery of God revealed I hope maybe some of you have gone and looked at that again and read it listened to it some it is such a uh important part of the preaching of the Seven Seals he said talking about the Christ coming to take the book and to redeem the book he said that all that is in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book the believer are the they are the words in the book all that is in the book is the believer so you are the written word you're the words in the book and he said and the word is him so when he comes around and it is the rising of the sun it's not he's teaching something new he says she is him she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she is him because she is the word for all that is in the word is the believer that's the believer the word's in the book and that's what he's coming to take and and at this time of redemption now I want to pick back up and question and answers on the seals I think that kind of reintroduces some a few of the statements that were very important to our our framing our thought on Sunday in um on last sun or on Sunday we read some extensive statements where brother Bram is talking about you just go on and live a Christian Life we living in the time where certain things are happening and you just go ahead and live a Christian Life go to church be a light live humbly just go ahead and just be humble stay right with the plain message just a real solid San Christian now and then he even gave us the example of John the Baptist and and how they're they asking the question is the bride going to have a Ministry oh yeah it's going to be a great ministry going to Big be big Ministry but he said how they they were challenged that God was in Simplicity working in Simplicity and even John himself was looking for something big and great and it was so simple till that Prophet even missed it and he was saying and he was even using the language of John uh as John would have said the same things in his day as brother Brandon was saying in this day you remember those things how we could see that parallel now I'm going to back up to paragraph 82 and I'm going to read um until uh paragraph do you have that did I have that slide in there brother John to paragraph 92 um so this is another this is the second question brother brandham is asked and the first question I had some statements I was going to use but I just realized it's probably going to be pressed for time first question is asked about the 10 virgins the wise and the foolish virgins and then this is the second question should evangelist continue on the field that might seem to be a strange question but I believe these questions were by people who are sensing the urgency of the hour and if you thought that was a strange question should evangelist continue on the field just several months later brother Ram's going to preach souls in prison now and he's asking himself is it too late I've got children out there that aren't saved I got family is it too late and so this is not an of based question based upon the events that were transpiring he says in this hour of course certainly by all means don't change a thing if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach Today like it was going to be 10 years from today but live like it's going to be at this hour that's that's powerful write that down if you need me to email it to you I will he says if Jesus is coming in the morning and again it's a hypothetical if Jesus is coming in the morning you're going to preach as if it's going to be 10 years ain't that remarkable even some ways you're getting some insight into how brother Bram has been impressed with the subject matter that he's dealing with and so there's there we can't we can't take the subject he can't take the events that are transp spiring and get all weird with it to change what Christians ought to always do and that's live close to God live a Christian Life don't get weird don't withdraw yourself and so he's having to he's kind of having to attack that and so he says we must must preach even if it's going to be tomorrow preach like it's going to be 10 years but live like it's going to be at this hour and that's the key I'm wanting us to realize is that if God is going to interpret his word by making it live and vindicating it to be so this is critical to even the subject matter at hand if he says he's coming in 10 years preach or coming tomorrow preach like it's going to be 10 years from day but live like it's going to be at this hour and he says don't get scrupled up now that's what I'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd peculiar don't change anything but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent come back to God and then and so he comes back to the question continue on your Evangelistic service just as you always did and you say well we're not evangelist what should we do he says if you're building a house put it on up if Jesus comes tomorrow be found faithful at the duty so if you're building a house keep building the house right if he's if he's coming if he's coming 10 years from now if he's coming 20 years from now if he's coming in 10 minutes don't change anything keep doing what you're supposed to be doing he says he says be found faithful at the duty if you're building your church go on put it up he says I'd rather be putting my money in something like that than be found with it in my pocket see just keep on continue as you are everybody understand now continue right on just go right on as you are now just don't stop and do nothing just go right on just as you are keep on serving the lord think this is very important and we might feel like I I know there's maybe a an attitude that that would take the emphasis of these statements and say well what brother Bam's doing is he's minimizing and taking away from the importance of the things that have happened and he's saying you know what nothing's really changed just keep doing what you're doing but I want us to look at it different and and accept that there has been a taken of the book there's been an open of the seals it's been a supernatural thing happening he says I'm sure you recognize the mysterious part of the week and he's emphasizing all these tremendous things that have happened and he re he's aware of all the carnal of impersonations and all the damage that could be done and all the crazy ideas that people could come up with and all the traditions that would still very stubbornly uh stand up and still try to add itself to this truth so he said he sees the truth of the hour he said there's only one way that this is ever going to come to its completion only one way this is ever going to Climax and that's if the real believer who can take this into their heart can continue to live it out am and he's emphasizing this keep on serving the lord and he uses this example now for instance if you was working for a man and you knew in 15 minutes before quit it was 15 minutes before quitting time well you'd say it's just 15 minutes more so I might as well just go over and sit down says you'd get docked for that 15 minutes if you're planting wheat plant your wheat if you're digging potatoes go on and dig them out if you're building a house build it if you're Building a Church build it if you're planting wheat plant your weed if you're digging potatoes go on and dig them out say well nobody will eat them that doesn't make any difference dig them out anyhow just continue on as you are amen now I I want to say this and it's kind of maybe a different subject or takes a step further but what what strikes me in saying this when you realize that brother brandham uh uh emphasizes how the Holy Ghost has to have preeminence and it has to work so freely through the believer and there's a yielding to the the Holy Ghost and he begins to work through us to the point to where it touches all those who've uh received the spirit he says in one place it draws the rest of them from the grave and we go in the Rapture that's happening as you live your life as you live close to the word of God as you replicate the very nature of Christ in the way that you live act and treat one another and that's as a brother would be Christlike as a sister would be Christlike as children honor their fathers and mothers we're all doing our part if I can say this for this thing to finish up and and I want to use it in this light in knowing that I'm I maybe leaving some to be desired and backing it up with the scripture and the message but our way to a body change is is farming and if you want a body change just keep on farming just keep on living keep on on doing what you're told to do keep on doing what the Bible says don't get weird stand off fold your arms and say I'm just looking to the sky waiting for the Lord to come don't do it it's never going to happen that way you've got to keep living the life and doing what you're called to do and that's our way to a translation amen and I believe that's why he's emphasizing this so plainly if you plant wheat plant your wheat if you dig potatoes dig them out oh well no one's going doesn't make any difference dig them out anywhere just continue on as you are so he says I this is ining in the very next paragraph I got a letter from somebody the other day somebody told them well the times at hand sell the farm now you won't need that food that you live off of on the farm because just the mum's going to start and you won't need it so just go ahead while the tribulation period's going on your children's not safe so just let the children have the farm where they can eat off of it but but you all sell your farm and he said something like that I said oh my so what was the attitude well the millenniums come and sell the farm or give it to your kids whatever it's time just to change what we're doing and and all of a sudden stop he says oh my if I knew he was coming tomorrow and I was a farmer I'd put my crop in today and again I I think that we have to give some real weight to what he's saying if I knew he was coming tomorrow and I was a farmer I'd put my crop in today how many of us would do that I mean if and I I appreciate it that's our conviction that's the way way it should be if I would think that if I'm a lawyer and I knew the Lord was coming tomorrow I may not want a lawyer today like well you know that opinion is not going to be worth the paper it's written on to come tomorrow right you know I'm not going to be able to finish this contract and what's the point and it'd be really easy in our minds to be if you knew the clock was going to strike you're going to be off in 15 minutes you and you sit off and you're going to slack a little bit doesn't it frustrate you when you walk into any business establishment and it says they close at 5: and you walk in at 4:45 and like oh sorry we're closing like no you're not the sign says fine you need to serve me you need to you need to provide this service whatever it might be and we get that way about just the services that we demand in the world today well let's use the same mindset when it comes to serving God and living for God if you knew he was coming tomorrow don't slack off do your responsibility do what you're asked to do do what you're called to do he says if he if I was a farmer and I knew he was coming tomorrow I'd put my crop in today if he made me a farmer I'm going to stay right at my duty he says if he made me a mechanic what can you say stay right at your duty if you're building a house if you're planting weed if you're planting potatoes if you're put building a church if you're a farmer a mechanic what do you do stay at your duty so the fellow came in and told his Pastor I'm going to give you the the second set of keys because the Rapture might come you know and I won't be needing it anymore backhanded conf to the pastor you know I want you to have my keys in case the Rapture comes he says so that's making res res ready isn't he goes all right but that's the way it is saying that there's a right way and he says we must be sane solid Christians sane solid Christians he says and I put here to work right I'm put here to write work right up to the last minute I've got a job to do and I'll be right found faithful at the post of Duty must be sane solid I I got a work to do and I've got a job to do and I must be found right faithful at the post of Duty notice how this keeps coming up be found faithful at the duty be found faithful at the stay right at my duty be found faithful at the post of Duty if he comes in the morning I want to be standing right here in the pulpit and you say brother brandom if he was coming this morning shouldn't you be out there no sir this is my post of Duty and he's saying this over and over again in relation to the coming of the Lord he says if the Lord coming in the morning shouldn't you be out there and he goes no this is my post- of Duty so let's get this in our minds whether he comes in 5 minutes or 50 years you have to be your posted Duty doing what you're supposed to do he says this is my post of Duty I'll be standing right here preaching when he comes saying the same things I am then when he comes I'll just move right on out with him amen takes this idea of just kind of waiting waiting around looking at the sky and some traditional model of the coming of the Lord and it puts us in this channel of I got to keep living the life he says just go ahead and just be humble and go right on with the same plain message this is what he's wanting us to do just go on this is your post of duty standing right here preaching till he comes then when he comes I'll just move right on out with him says if I'm hoing potatoes I'll just be hoing away just as hard as I can when he comes I'll just drop the hoe and take off you remember in the Jubilee year if they were hoing with the hoe they kept on hoing they knew the Jubilee year wasn't maybe 10 minutes more and the trumpet sound at the Jubilee they just kept on pitching hay or whatever they were doing but when the trumpet sounded they dropped the Pitchfork and gone that's it just keep on pitching hay until the trumpet sounds I'd love to spend more time emphasizing some of these things but I want you just to have that H have this established maybe just entering into the record as a church this is what brother bam taught at this time at the open of the seals at the time of question and answers on the seals before we come into him preaching on the seventh seal that night he's saying this is very important for us to do don't get odd don't get Peculiar don't be strange keep doing what you're supposed to be doing stay right at the post of Duty now in paragraph 349 this is question 42 you could realize see just how many questions brother bandam had this the question comes back around in a different sense and I want to read all the way to paragraph uh 365 he's asked this question question 42 brother Brandon will the dispensation of Grace be over after you open the seven con seals again I believe that this is a very astute question this is somebody who's not just kind of knee-jerk writing this down but they're listening to what brother R I'm saying uh one of the one of kind of a lightning rod for a lot of discussion maybe sometimes just among ministers is the discussion of the Bride age and it revolves around the seventh Church age being over a a and some of the things that brother Ram said and he's point blank asked the question brother Bram is the leoty in church age over H and it may seem to be a very strange question in August of 1964 is the latan church age over and he says oh you must have you must misunderstood something that I said the question just wasn't somebody just what's the weirdest thing we can ask brother brandham it was based upon what brother brandham had been preaching that summer so you go back up a few moments and start listening everything he's saying you realize this was a very good question in light of the fact that brother Bram said and when the seventh Church AG is over and it is when he's preaching future home and so there was a truth there that people wrestled with we're trying to figure out so they come right out and ask the question and it's good that the question was asked because it allowed brother Brandon to answer in a way so that someone doesn't go too far with some of those truths that he was establishing in that wonderful summer of 64 and so now when he's asked this question will the dis is the dispensation of Grace over after you open the Seven Seals this is someone who's listening to C this the time this is somebody who just probably listened to the breach in other words they were there listening to it as brother B preached it and they're thinking oh wow the the lamb is going to come forward he's going to take the book and things are going to go quickly to the Jews and all the different things that they might be thinking about and he says I hope not no no friends don't get that in your mind just you just go right on dig the potatoes and go to church and right on if it takes place in the morning you just be found doing just exactly what you're supposed to be doing he says don't start when you do you twist the very thing away from the purpose that it's intended for I I want to come back to that here just a second we when you he says don't start and I would say this is just brother Aaron I I think he's saying when you get weird when you stop doing what a Christian's supposed to do and you start acting funny with it you start interpreting yourself he says you twist your yourself you twist the very thing away from the purpose that it's intended for if I get to put it this way you twist away from the very purpose of the revealing of the Seven Seals the Seven Seals was to give rapturing Faith to the bride those seven Thunders uttering their voices the revelation of these Seven Seals to give rapturing Faith to the bride says you twist away from the very purpose that it's intended for you get a little peculiar thoughts and you get your own ideas about things don't take your own idea just when you sit and listen to things like that say thank you Lord I'm just going to walk a little closer to you when you listen to Little peculiar thoughts when you hear people talking about their own ideas he says when you hear that you just say Lord I'm going to walk a little closer to you you say well I think he was talking about the Seven Seals when you hear that just say Lord I'm going to walk a little closer to you guess what you're probably not going to go wrong if that's what you always say to what you hear right you hear about the the ruple price getting crazy Lord I'm just going to walk a little bit closer to you right when you hear about I know it's rubal but my friends call it ruple so I call it ruple he said I'm just going to walk a little bit closer to you whatever you hear Lord I'm just going to walk a little bit closer to you he says don't quit work and say I'll sell out everything why why would this even be relevant why would he even need to talk about it if there wasn't something that was transpiring a scriptures being fulfilled that within the tradition view of these scriptures being fulfilled everybody thought this is it it's over we're in the Millennium we're in the tribulation it's all going to be over now the graves are going to be dug up at any moment by these angels if there if these things that were happening wouldn't have this wouldn't be easily misinterpreted and made a mockery then he's probably thinking wow this is no different than just you know anything any kind of meeting any kind of special service you just go on you get your healing continue on as you are don't quit work don't stop building a house don't stop digging to potatoes and could we say today that was really really good advice to the potato farmer in March of 1963 if he was thinking about selling the farm couldn't we say 60 some odd years later wow brother brandom that was really good advice I believe that we could say that it's really good advice to not sell the farm how he says don't quit working say and say I'll sell out everything and I want to read this story he says a man running up here the the other day from North Carolina those people from Carolina he said just before he left he said glory to God can you tell me where some great somebody was and I said no oh yes sir this guy is the president of the Auto mission I said the what the Auto mission I said I don't understand he said oh this guy's the president I said what' you say his name was he said brandom I believe something like that brown or brandom I said well my name is brandom and when you read this story and just imagine kind of like this routine back in forth this guy's all excited and remember brother BS answering the question should we continue is the dispensation of Grace over and people getting peculiar and Odd Ideas and he says uh well my name's brandom are you the president of the Auto mission no sir he said well where's the Millennium at I still don't know where Auto mission uh fits into this I'm afraid to Google it he said well where's the Millennium at I said I don't know he said why you mean it's going on right here and you don't know it I said no sir I don't he said well glory to God I got some friends come told me to quit work still had his work cloth on said brother I want the Millennium I said well I believe you're just a little bit confused aren't you brother and think how relevant this is to these events and transpiring because we may have friends I I know I even know of people that were friends with that we fellowship with uh early on with my family who went on to believing that we were in the Millennium well what because the seals are opened oh well then this is what must have happened and oh we believe that this has transpired this scripture has been fulfilled so then the next thing is the Millennium and it gets down to where all of a sudden you start making people God and you start making people the Christ and it gets all scrupled up so brother bandam is seeding these things right in the middle of preaching on the seals this whole idea of people are going to take this truth and twist it and make it out to be something different going to take it and twist it and make to be oh brother we're in the Millennium I want you to think very very spiritual about this brother bradam is preaching the open of the Seven Seals where the lamb has come and take the book he's going to come later on and preach the Rapture and say the Lord himself has descended with the shout and these things have transpired and what's going to be the carnal jump from that oh don't take communion and feet washing anymore we're in the Millennium now and all these and he's he's touching on that he's fighting against those very knee-jerk reaction to these things right while he's preaching this and he's able to provide a real life example in real time to where he's living some guy want to know where the Millennium was brother I want the Millennium I believe you're a little bit confused he said about that time a car drw up now just imagine this scene it's getting almost kind of comical a taxi cab pulls up and a woman jumps out and and he says this woman says hold it hold it hold it little woman come up there she said now you're going to pray for my husband and I saides ma'am what about she say well I understand you have to wait a month for an interview to get prayed for I said what she said yes sir but I'm desperate you got to pray for my husband I said sure where is he at bring him on the guy standing says do you pray for the sick too yes sir did you say your name was brandom and you don't know about about the Millennium he's like this is the guy who brought the Millennium he don't even know anything about it he goes well no I don't brother says no I don't I don't understand it just right in the Bible he said no it's right now people coming from everywhere I said where it's where's it at he said Jeffersonville Indiana right under the bridge he says and he says sir you've got me bested I don't know nothing about it he said let's go in and sit down maybe we can talk this thing over we did CU you realized this guy was thinking that something related to brother Ram's Ministry had ushered in the Millennium in Jeffersonville under a bridge and it was transpiring and he was and he got so caught up in it that he was even saying you mean you're the brother brandom you don't know nothing about the Millen that's just really interesting how stubborn some ideas can get like you know brother Bram introduced us to the L you know brother bram's God right so then you just go right and ask brother brandom are you God he's like no I'm not God I'm Not Jesus Christ I'm like that's exactly what God would say right and it's just a stubborn idea that you can't get out of people's heads so he says you see friends don't you ever desire a Ministry you know what I mean you be happy just the way where just hap be happy just where you are you just go right on amen find it very interesting don't ever desire a Ministry you be happy you be happy where you just you are just where you are just go right on am he says dig the potatoes go to church I want to come back to this dig the potatoes just go to church right on if it takes place in the morning be found just doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing don't start when you twist the very when you do you twist the very thing away from the purpose that it's intended for when you get a little peculiar when you have your own ideas when you take your own idea he says you twist the very thing away from the purpose that it's intended for what thing I I want to say he's talking about the revealing of the word that the the revealing of these Mysteries the open of the Seven Seals he says you twist yourself away you twist the thing very away from the thing it's intended for and remember the statement of the church age but God's intention for his creation man is to express his words in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by are we being restored back to this even condition part of that three-fold mystery of Christ he says a life lived by the word would be the word expressed so if we get odd and peculiar we stop working we withdraw ourselves we get clannish we get cultish we get strange we go gather under a bridge in Jeffersonville because that's where the millennium's at then you can't have a life that's lived by the word am because God's intention the very thing that God intended in the open of these Seven Seals the very thing that God intended by loosening the book is that there would be a life that would Usher in a life that would come forth and there'd be a people that would receive the word of God for this time and then their lives would interpret the word he interprets his word by making it live and vindicating to be so so then we take the word into our hearts we take this word into our bosom then we step out and we begin to live this word and then a life lived by the word would be the word expressed a life lived by the word would be the word interpreted Jesus said go ye therefore in all the world I I and baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost was that the word right well you're getting nervous right you're like well well let's talk let's sit down and talk about it are we talking about under a bridge in Jeffersonville where are we at on this that's exactly what Jesus said then what did Peter do what did he do when he when they begin to fulfill the word they went and baptize them in the name of Jesus Christ because this is now they're living that word and it's interpreting it's interpreting the word life lived by the word is the word expressed the word interpreted and I believe that the word here is brother R's answering these questions and now I think we've we've read from at least three questions and three questions from question and answers on the seals and there's this theme that you find in this I believe God is the word is being very deliberate in what it's saying very deliberate how it's answering these questions in order to preserve the right focus in our hearts you you we've seen the fanaticism that's been attached to these things so much F fanaticism to where the truth of it's even rejected they'll say well I don't want to become like those folks and these people do don't believe in this and they don't believe in that and it's the fanaticism associated with believing the seals are open or believing in the open of the word or believing that the third pool is being fulfilled or is is is still taking place within the bride they say we've seen the kind of nonsense that that leads to we've seen the path that that goes and they become scarecrows to this all because typically there's not a life that backs it up it gets associated with a lot of sarcasm a lot of worldliness and a a lot of deviating from other principles in the scripture of Holiness and and and the and the moving of the spirit and even the manifestation of gifts to a certain extent and H even communion and feet washing things just get abandoned because they they take these things and they completely misinterpret them and they make them into something they're not and so I believe brother Bram is whether he's being conscious that in 2022 this is going to be a challenge or he the word is God is just be putting this weight upon him to be very precise in his language so that the bride is left with the record to keep us focused on living the word because the promise of this age cannot be manifested if we have the wrong expectation cannot be manifested with the wrong expectation we've got to have the right expectation now I'm realizing I have a lot more um I should have known that reading those lengthy statements would give me a little bit more time typically like I said I come up here with maybe just one page of notes I'm like that's going to be about an hour anything more is going to be longer than an hour on a Wednesday night I don't want to go that long but when it's um sometimes it's these very lengthy statements we go through them quicker so if I if I'm short tonight I apologize I'm probably just barely 58 every time I preach I'm short question and answers on the seals I want to come back to a statement we read on Sunday take my advice as your brother don't put your own interpretation anything now hear this kind of in light of what we just what we just uh read these these two questions that brother Bram answers just go on and live a good Christian life because you only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it if you can keep in mind these two things these these statements that we've just had where brother bradam is saying you just build your house build your church be found Faith both the duty if you're planting wheat plant wheat digging potatoes dig potatoes be uh you know just stay right at your duty if you're a farmer be found right faithful at the post of Duty this is my post- of Duty dig the potatoes go to church hold potatoes home just as much as you can keep on pitch and hate till the trumpet sounds over and over thank you Lord I'm just going to walk a little closer to you because if you don't you're going to twist yourself away from the very thing it's intended for and this was intended God's intent and purpose is that a life would be lived by the word so in the very outset of this just go on and live a good Christian life because you only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it you're only wind your way from the thing he said all of you are conscious and know there's something mysterious happening and it's happening and I know what it is and I've been told you told you before so just don't try to put any interpretation but just believe me as your brother we living in a great hour now I I was fellowshipping with brother Andrew on this um earlier this week and there's uh I I I'm alluding to it somewhat and I realize I'm doing it without maybe the the recent backgrounding and I'm relying a lot on your your knowledge of the message of the hour but remember in the vision that three-part vision of the of what we call the third pool and how even the fishing and then the lacing the booty and then coming to the cathedral or the tent in that series of Visions brother bandam is told you explained it too much and the language he uses quite often after that is you don't explain this don't say too much it won't be a public show and he talks about how I'm Duty bound and I'm oblig to the spirit and I was warned by the spirit don't say too much and I had the the statements from the seventh seal maybe to read tonight but I wanted just to leave them off for another time where brother says I have it written right here in my notes stop there don't go any further right and maybe we mentioned that Sunday how even brother Bram after he went after he continued on before he closed that service he had to come back late or he came back the next morning and recorded in a hotel room something to replace what he had said because he felt checked in his spirit that maybe he had said too much and what was he talking talk about that whole time that very Vision that very that very happening there in sainia Canyon the Fulfillment of that Vision he had about the tent and so he's he's very feels very very cautious to explain too much or say too much so when he says where he says I know what's happened but don't just put interpretation to it we're living in a great hour he says we're living in a time where the well were right can just imagine maybe he's wanting to say something maybe maybe he feels like this is there's something he feels like he wants to say he says well you just be real humble be a Christian and try to live for God and live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you don't try to make yourself any you see when you do you're only making a mysterious something and mess the real program of God up so you can twist yourself away from the very thing it's intended and he talks about getting off the path and he says here that you just go on and live a good Christian Life or you just wind yourself away from the real thing and you mess the real program of God up so we can say the real program of God and the intention and purpose that God has cannot be fulfilled unless we continue to live the life unless we continue to walk in these truths unless we continue to express in our manner of life and our conduct the nature of Christ just be humble be a Christian live for God live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you how could we argue with that why would any of us reason with that as that as not being a part of the solution is not being the proper outcome of the word of God feeding on the word of God and being in his divine presence now I want to um I want to close with going to our text and I when I say close I still have um some things to read here to you in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 I'm glad that we do have time to look at this 2 Corinthians chapter 3: 1-6 let's look at this in detail again Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you whether we want to look at it in the sense of attesting to who he is and his qualifications some Commendation that recommends him it's it has its roots in introduction and a proper Testament of who he was do we need a letter from you attesting to who we are do we we have Epistles of commendation to you so you receive me or letters of commendation from you that speaking of who we are and and what we're our characters are our character is and he says ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men now in this image then Paul has something in his heart and he says what's in my heart is now known and read of all men it in you so you have become as men read you and as men know you they are knowing what was in my heart so and whatever is in Paul's heart we can't see right even if we we we digging into someone's heart you cut it open and look into it you're not going to see what Paul's talking about what's in Paul's heart is in a mystery it's hidden and then there's something that's deep within his heart it's within his bosom and he says but you now become the very thing that's written in my heart you are now that epistle you are that letter which is now known and read of all men and so he kind of amplifies it in verse three for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us how is it that they are the Epistle of Paul's heart that is now read by men and read by men known of men because they you are manifestly declared they were manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us so the letter of Christ the writing of Christ the very thing that Paul was ministering he says you have manif you are manifestly declared to be that which I ministered I preach I write I exhort I lift up I I share I I I I deliver the burden that I have in my heart and the word as I lift up Jesus Christ he says but now you are manifestly declared to be that which I have written to be that which I have ministered and that's how you become what was in our hearts the the living out of what I have ministered he says written not with ink but with the spirit of living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart so where is it written it's it's not in the stones as he refers back to the law it's not what's engraved in tablets it's not even what's written in the Scrolls he says it's what's written in your heart it's what's lived out in your life he says and such trust have we through Christ to God word what is he trusting that that there is a what he's ministered what he's labored the bird he's delivered from his heart is received into the hearts of people and lived out that's the proof that's the Vindication not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency as of God and then I I wanted to continue to this because this is very a very pronounced scripture in the first few parts of this series who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament remember he said in verse three you are declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us so we've ministered you are the Epistle of Christ which we have ministered and he says we are ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life now you having to gather want you to gather a lot of things together I'm hoping tonight I I had a piece in my heart to preach these things tonight because I thought you know the the people will be able to gather get together these things and and I w't necess have to start connecting the dots but you can start doing it now because what is the New Testament what are the Seven Seals it's the seals upon the book The Seals of the New Testament right so he said that there's the New Testament is sealed with Seven Seals he says the bride right is the New Testament he talks about the whole the Bible becoming a new book he says it's he says it's of the New Testament and what is Paul saying we are able Ministers of the New Testament and and he's and he's laying out this thought of how this this pattern of what is in my heart I Minister and you receive and we'll come to maybe some scriptures next week on how he said from you from you sounds out the word of God we preach the prophet preaches ministers preach behind the pulpit and you think oh my brother Aaron has an opportunity and he and he gets to preach and he preach preaches on Sunday morning preaches on Wednesday and I have the same audience every time and I and I I preach but you go out and you live and you have your congregation you have lives that you touch and there's some of you they're going to have exponentially more opportunities to impact lives than I will behind the pulpit and you'll do it because the manner of life that you live out in public and how you handle situations and the and the opportunities that you have to say the right thing do the right thing dress the right way respond the right way and it it becomes even more and more pronounced to me how it's very easy to kind of slip into certain ways of acting when we're at the work crowd with we're a hobby crowd we're different people and we can talk the language that they talk we could talk about the things that they enjoy the things that they like and we can kind of just to simulate and have a camaraderie around certain things with people in the world and they'll walk away and never have any greater knowledge that who you are really are and what's in your heart what's in your bosom and what you love and what you care for and what's what means the most to you wouldn't you hate till all of a sudden find out one day and you say oh sorry I missed that meeting and I was in church and they go you're a Christian or what church were you in the meat church I know you like to smoke meat what church were you in and they don't even know that you have this desire for the things of God why because it's your life it's because you've you you're not you're not living the life even in your language and your likes and your dislikes and your tastes and your Pursuits but this is a book then SE the seals are opened what does it Loose if the bride's the New Testament and the seals loose the New Testament what does it Loose it's loose the bride and so this very scripture you are epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men I want to read this statement brother Maham says that about Enoch and Elijah he says oh Christian what an opportunity we have we have opportunities that St Paul never dreamed of having I like that statement we have opportunities that St Paul never dreamed of having is A peculiar statement wouldn't you think that that in itself causes you to pause and think he says Elijah and Enoch so you realize there's this emphasis on the Rapture but it's in the Easter seal April 10th 1965 oh Christian what an opportunity we have we have opportunities that St Paul never dreamed of having I want you to think about in light of what he's saying you are an epistle written heart known and read of all men we don't even need a letter of introduction you are introducing what was in our heart you're introducing what I was preaching you're manifestly declared to be the Christ that we're lifting up the Christ that we are ministering now take this statement and join it to this quote I want to read my a lengthy quote to close the service from the voice of the sign and I want I want to this statement we have opportunities that St Paul never dreamed of having now let's just not let that stand on its own listen to what brother man says here he said what did Paul have the rest of them didn't have he had the abundance of the revelation of the word of God because it was Paul who recognized that Jesus of the New Testament was the Jehovah of the old he had the revelation of it and he says he wrote it and revealed it because God permitted it to be added to the Bible and the word comes only by the Bible by the prophet so the words in the Bible have come by the Breath of God come by his inspiration he says and so then God revealed to Paul and he wrote the letters inspired and God put them in the Bible I hope you're kind of tracking what I'm saying like like putting this in the context of what we've ministered on these these first five services on this that there is the written word in the Old Testament was Christ the written word in the New Testament you're living out and you're fulfilling so now brother bram's kind of he's looking at this from this perspective God revealed truths to Paul he wrote letters inspired God put him the Bible oh my revealed that his Christ of the Old Testament because he met him he couldn't understand how the pillar of fire was that was the one that led his people out of Egypt that was the one that had been with the Hebrews all through the age and here he is he seen him he said Lord what is it you want with me he said I am Jesus he seen that this one that had led his people that he knew all the time that Moses met the I am was everpresent same yesterday today and forever was manifested in the flesh this is now the recognition that this Jesus of Nazareth is the is now one it's the pillar fire here's he struck down by the pillar fire he says Lord who art thou he's called him this is Jehovah who are you and he says I'm Jesus and he says whom thou persecutest so this was the Living Word In the Flesh of those Believers in that day that Paul is crucifying persecuting hunting down he says that word Christ the I am was manifest In the Flesh it was his Revelation he had it above any of the rest of them and so great until except he get exalted above the abundance of Revelation there was given to him there was given to him we know a thorn in the flesh he says what did he do this part I want you to catch his Revelation then was prophecy for today you catch that his Revelation then was prophecy for today think about brother BR says we had opportunities that St Paul never dreamed of having his Revelation then was prophecy for today it was the voice coming forth wrote in the Bible to be Vindicated today again he says hallelujah it's the voice being Vindicated again what he wrote because he was God's Prophet revealing the sign was speaking of something and notice now that Jesus now let me I just want want to stop there can you you catch maybe what would be my this would be my emphasis or how I'm reading it how it's striking me that he's saying that Paul wrote the Bible he wrote the New Testament practically we could give him this authorship of writing the majority of the New Testament and he wrote it by Revelation and he wrote these things in the word but his Revelation then that he wrote that is in the word of God which is the New Testament was prophecy for today so what Paul was writing then by Revelation that wasn't history it wasn't summation it wasn't explanation it was prophecy what even interpretation it was prophecy then Paul is writing things that would be Revelation then to Paul that would then be fulfilled in the time we're living today let this like Lodge in your your spiritual understanding that Paul's Revelation then prophesied of today even when Paul looked as if it was going to be happening very imminently and Paul was expressing things that he felt was transpiring in his time and in his the very moment he's living in to whatever extent things are being fulfilled then and there's a compound fulfillment or compound type we see that brother say his Revelation then was prophecy for today it was the voice coming forth wrote in the Bible to be Vindicated today again and then he says so there there's the voice that wrote the Bible's got to be V indicated again today how is it Vindicated through interpretation right through manifestation through living the voice that wrote the Bible the written word of God the written New Testament must be Vindicated today again and he says now the next slide and we notice now that Jesus when he come on the scene good we're there he says now we notice that Jesus when he come on the scene he was prophesied word he was the prophesied word so he when Jesus come on the scene he was the written word right so now when Jesus came on the scene he's the word that was prophesied he had a Ministry to fulfill he had a Ministry no to be fulfilled what was written of him what was written of him a Ministry to fulfill it and there's our par parallel again Old Testament new testament old testament bridegroom New Testament bride so just start thinking now in type of what we must do what we've got to be doing he come on the scene he was the prophesied word he had a Ministry to fulfill what was written of him said that the other night as I spoke to Copus and them oh fools and slow of heart to believe the word of God don't you know that Christ should suffer these things didn't all the prophets speak that he should do this and then enter into his glory he has to fulfill everything that he come he come to heal that it might be fulfilled he did this that it might be fulfilled wa what was written what was written what was written everything he done was to be fulfilling because he was to be the voice of that scripture he was to be the voice of that scripture here's Jesus Christ in his first first coming the word had been written it had been prophesied Jesus comes in fulfillment of Prophecy the Fulfillment of the written word so he's now the manifesting of the written word he is the interpretation of the written word and he says he has a Ministry to fulfill everything he did was fulfilling because he had to be the voice the life if I could put it that way of that scripture he had to be the interpretation of that scripture now and don't answer me and start throwing answers back to me but at least think in your mind if we had a breakout session right now and we all wanted to come up with our in our little groups what this would mean to us today what would you start thinking about what is it that you would start piecing together in your heart saying oh my this is the pattern that was laid out in Jesus Christ Paul's Revelation then that you are the epistle written our hearts known and read of all men you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ written by us we are ministers of the New Testament and I say this then one day that new testament there has to be a voice raised up and be the voice of that scripture there has to be a life that raise up and interprets the New Testament what would what would we come to our conclusion uh when when we got together and begin to rehearse things in our ears that we've heard are preached all these years that in the bride coming of Christ there would be another manifestation of the word of God in our day and it wouldn't just be a one-man Ministry but it would be individuals like you and I living out the prophecy for our time am everything he did he was fulfilling because he had to be the voice of that scripture who's the final voice to the final Age The Bride under her messenger so brother BR said now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament that's how I can say that not just I am but you are the open book Let's stand together tonight
