TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Wednesday night we began on the subject of a home of honor and we were drawing from a place in Scripture it talks about an honest and good heart and we're taking it as an honest house and an unselfish house is one of the things that we touched on at the very end and highlighting certain characteristics of home life some things that I believe should be present if it's going to be a home and not just a place that we live if it's going to be a quiet resting place if it's going to be a peace ible habitation uh if it's going to be a sure secure dwelling there's certain characteristics that need to be there in order uh for there to be to have that atmosphere in a family where everyone's always pranking one another and playing jokes on each other there may be a certain level of tension that makes it more of an arena than it does a Peaceable habitation and so I say that just to point out if someone's always trying to trick you or lied to you can't trust them that would certainly make for an uncomfortable atmosphere in the home uh if everyone was always out to get their own um you know they would be hiding the good cereal which our kids do at times uh you can never find the bag of really really good chips um those have been stashed away somewhere somehow the best of the the frozen treats are gone uh within 24 hours of getting them so there's a lot of things where you got to get yours and you got to find it when you can and so honesty and unselfishness are kind of these themes that we're we're drawing from now if you look here in our text it speaks of a certain rich man and we took Wednesday night some time to show that Jesus is rebuking an attitude of the Pharisees in particular one thing he points out quite a bit about the Pharisees is that they are hypocrites and being a hypocrite it means they are a pretender uh they're just playing a part or playing a role the word speaks of a uh an actor or stage player so where they're impersonating something or playing the part and are they playing the part of a Pharisee no the Pharisee plays the part of one who is righteous they're not really righteous inwardly they just do things for pretense and for show to make you think that they're holy that they know the truth that they're right so that they can have some opportunity or privilege or right in Luke 12:1 Jesus says beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy hypocrisy is the the sin of pretending that you have virtue the sin of pretending that you are good it's all for display and it's all for show and Jesus calls it leaven so it will corrupt it will pervade ultimately it will go through and through and so the leaven of the Pharisees is hypocrisy it's going to corrupt it's going to pervert and two words I want to use today to highlight the nature of these Pharisees and I hope that you can go back to Wednesday night and kind of see some of these characteristics as I don't know that we have much more review on this particular part but they were self-serving in other words they acted primarily for their own benefit they didn't do the things that they did for the benefit of others they did it solely for their own or primarily for their own benefit so they did things that served only themselves and then they were also self-preserving in other words they wanted to ensure their own Survival uh they needed to be relevant they needed to be needed and so these are things that are uh uh negative Dynamics within an individual it can be an atmosphere that begins to per pervade a group dynamic as it did the Pharisees but it's most important for us to apply it to ourselves as individuals what kind of Outlook we have on life are we self-serving where we act to benefit ourselves are we self-preserving where we want to uh ensure our own health and safety alone and our own Survival and in Proverbs 18:12 it says Before Destruction the heart of a man is hotti it is arrogant it is presumptuous it is lifted up and before honor is humility so if there's going to be any honor in our individual lives there needs to be humility there's going to be any honor in our homes there needs to be humility if there's going to be any honor of the Lord in this church there first needs to be humility uh that humility is not weakness it's not that well we're a broke Church we're a broken Church we're you know got all sorts of problems a a and we all make a bunch of mistakes and we're all adulterers and we all cuss and we smoke we're just broken people God bless us and and we got to give this idea since we can't do anything right we're humble no you're just wrong you still need Jesus You're Pitiful uh uh but it's not that's not humility humility is like meekness it's it's power under control where I could do this but I won't right I I could say this I could take advantage I could take opportunities but I'm not because I am respectful I I recognize that God is a god of boundaries and I respect other people's boundaries and I respect the boundaries of God's word I act within his parameters and that's my humility is to surrender myself to a greater Authority and when I act I'm not self asserting I'm not trying to promote myself I'm not trying to ensure my own Survival and I'm not just acting for my own benefit so that I look good I I I'm honestly will act to glorify the Lord and for the benefit of others and not really maybe just a good thesis statement for this morning now if you'll look at Luke chapter 16: 19 to 21 I'd like to read these to cue up and to tee up this Parable once again there was a certain rich man as I mentioned on Wednesday night the word that's used in the Latin Vulgate I pronounce it as Dives I would still stand by that as being one of the many pronunciations uh that are used used in the ecclesiastical realm around the world but I have been called to task by doctors and even the professor of Classics in Latin the University of Baylor was offered to me as an authority personally through a personal contact and so I'm going to go with Devas just to not run the risk of offending anybody who may be streaming this but dvas is also maybe the more appropriate ecclesiastical pronunciation if you really want the correct pronunciation ask Brother Scott Walker because I found out he's a true friend because he did not want another Mortage uh situation was like brother Aaron I really I studied this in college I really think we should talk about this and I was like that's a real friend emailed his Professor from many many years ago said hey my pastor said Dives the other night and I'm falling apart over here help us out and it was it was awesome I love it so D dvas it is and and that's what if we refer to him we might say I might say Dives U somebody queued up a very neat picture of the Rich Young Ruler with a guy feri uh and said this is this would be a perfect one for Sunday morning I didn't use it but it's in the queue perhaps maybe to use it in the future but there certain rich man in the Latin Devas we may say that he's the certain rich man uh but we it's great to have that nomination we refer to him and something stood out to me when I was studying this last week and so I was able to just really jump into it with Brother Scott when he was bringing up um some of these correct things and some of the things I was missing um I'd been studying it and trying to find the right way to say it and found it in the Latin the root for this word uh is it speaks of one it says rich man it speaks of in the Latin one that's favored by the gods and is uh blessed or Divine and I felt it was no coincidence that this would become somewhat of a colloquial reference to this rich man because his wealth gave the appearance that he was blessed it gave him the appearance of being favored by God so this uh Devas was one that one would look at say man he has made God proud God has favored him God has blessed him and now as we continue to read about this uh certain rich man he was clothed in purple and fine linen and feed sumptuously every day he's got it he's got it going on and and he's blessed he's blessed he seems to be favored and and then it says there was a certain beggar and and immediately we know not he's not blessed because he's a beggar named Lazarus one does not have a name the other is named and I think that that is is relevant to how Jesus is trying to lay this out he says which was laid at his gate full of sores this tells us that he has open wounds that no one is treating he has H uh that says the dogs come and lick uh his wounds and his sores the dogs care enough about them uh than him than anybody else and it's a it's a really poor and pitiful situation and he's laid at dias's gate in other words he can't even make it himself there but one has assisted him and help him to be there and it says and Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table I read in one place where the crumbs would be the things that would be brushed off of someone's hands and it's those things that he would have been happy to eat the things that Annoy Us and the things that bother us H we want to get it off our hands it's those things he would have been happy to eat and as we think of this contrasting pictures of a certain rich man in Lazarus we pointed out that the rich man's lifestyle and all the things that he had were no indication of God's favor or God's blessing I almost said flavor flavor town the rich man's uh flavor but it there was no indication at all that he was blessed you you couldn't deduce because he had a house with the gate and because he drove a nice car because he wore nice clothes and all these things and ate well that he must be pleasing the Lord it was no indication that he had morality that he had character that God had favored him and in the inverse lazarus's poverty is no indication of a lack of morality we can say oh well he's homeless because he was a addict or he's homeless because he was a con man and he's this way because he had this problem he did that problem you can't make these assumptions about Lazarus it was no indication of his lack of morality or a lack of character and it was no indication of the lack of God's blessing or favor I know those things are difficult to wrestle with individually or when we view the circumstances of someone else one of the most controversial stories in scripture for the critic the skeptic and even for the Christians and whatever side you're on is the story of job it's so difficult to wrestle with the the way that that story is presented that here's a man who seems like he's doing everything right and God wagers with the devil for his life to be completely destroyed and who is it that suffers the children the wife and everyone and yet job maintains his uprightness and how that story could be used to justify so many different things it's really really hard to wrestle with and so we I would acknowledge the difficulty when we see someone suffering when we see somebody without when we see somebody losing somebody homeless a beggar full of sores who's being disregarded but we we have to keep in context the the Heavenly and the Earthly and that this life isn't the only life and God's blessings aren't always counted by carnal means and in the sman church age of the church age book it's chapter 4 brother brandham writes this he says here's where you have to believe again in the love and goodness and wisdom of God and said that way in the sense that it's would be easy to wrestle with his love it's easy to question his goodness and and rationalize with his wisdom given the circumstances of his children at time he said this too is needful remember he admonished take no thought for the tomorrow what you shall eat or what you shall put on we'll come back to these scriptures I believe later so it's good maybe that they they're entered into the record now and this is something that's become more and more pronounced to me that when when I look at message of the hour I'm not just looking at it as a singular message and this is what he said in this sermon and then you dissect that to try to figure it all out and and present what brother Brandon was teaching in that message to me it's a body of work that uh to understand even things that were said early on in his ministry it's good to stay in the continuity of it and see what he said later on and and look at it as God speaking to us through that vessel and through that Prophet a a and not just to cabbage down on one part but realize I need to maybe take everything in total and everything in whole as much as I possibly can so I'm going to continually to pray and seek the Lord for Revelation so that I can understand his thoughts towards me well if we take that approach with the message of the hour even more so with the Bible that we can't just take any truth and isolate it from the whole body of Truth said he said this and say all right well we're going to take this principle and put over here and that God does this and but if you isolate it from the broader context of the whole truth then this be given way too much weight or not enough weight and we misuse it then and so when when brother brandham says considering his love and goodness and wisdom take this into consideration how the scripture admonishes us take no thought for the marrow what you shall eat or what you shall put on your father knoweth the things you have need of he who clothes the Lily and feeds the sparrow shall do much more for you these physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life for a man's life consisteth not of the things he possesses but rather seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all material Necessities will be added unto you we could argue that wouldn't a God who loves us just simply give us all those things regardless of our attitude in our efforts and and good if he loves us just lavish us with certain things and you would realize real quick that that doesn't even work in Natural Life uh to do that with your own children and your own relationship so there's some wisdom and Prudence that we begin to gather from this and then this is the statement I think that's beautiful summary how the necessities of life and for a man's life consists not just in the things he possesses then he says the people of God are not material- minded and all the people of God said amen they are christm minded they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those above it is absolutely true the majority of Christians are not wealthy rather they are on the Poor Side it was so in Jesus's day it was true in Paul's day and it should be true today oh it is not TR too true today for the L toen age is one of the vast one of vast wealth where often the Criterion of spirituality is an abundance of Earthly Goods this is just our Instinct it's kind of our base nature and certain uh and I don't know if it's so much true now but this is just kind of what we've learned in uh in our Readers Digest or whatever it is we would read growing up that certain cultures if a man was fat he was blessed he was rich because he could afford to overeat and so there are certain things that are that are a show or display that man this guy's got it going on he's got it figured out well I think there's the same there's the same mentality where we see certain people as being spiritual a a and they must be blessed and they must be doing things right because our barometer for God's blessings is an abundance of Earthly goods and just think of how much pretense there is to that where the measuring is is the outward things he goes my how rich the church is in Goods but how poor in spirit in other words not that they're poor in spirit as Jesus would desire them to be but lacking the capital S Spirit blessed be the poor for yours is the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink it is not Material it is within us that that the idea of the kingdom of God as he says as he's quoting that seek ye first uh the kingdom of God is what he's referring to in his righteousness and then these material Necessities will be added under your provided he says the kingdom is within us and he says a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things now if we read that the wrong thing we would say a man who's got a lot of money has a lot of God but what he say is a a man who is rich in God is a rich man I I I can't remember just exactly how it is I think it was brother Le Lester Buckley that first said it but he said he was either horse rich or horse poor meaning all his money was in horses and maybe was horse poor might be the way you say it like I'm horse poor I've got a 100 horses and that's why I'm poor maybe I should uh have him email me exactly what that phrase was but there's this idea that if a a man is rich in God no matter how poor he may be he's rich in God so a rich man is one that is rich in God not one that is rich in worldly things just because you're rich in worldly things and even if you attribute that to God and you acknowledge that all good things come from God and I have this wealth because of God it's not because of your wealth that you are wealthy it's because God that's why you can be rich amen so there's a being rich in this world and being rich in God those are two different riches and so you could be D so your name could be rich and I want to be a one that's rich in God Luke 16 Verse 22 now as we're just continuing on where we were at there now we have the rich man and we have Lazarus and it came to pass that the beggar Lazarus died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom Jesus now as he's telling this Parable to a captive audience he needs to use a language he doesn't have the privilege of a 29 part series at this point he's got to get to the point here and he's going to give a lot of uh images in this very statement that the beggar is carried by angels He was carried by men to the gate of the rich man but now Angels carry him to the Gate of Heaven into the very bosom of Abraham and then it's almost dismissive the rich man died also and was buried and then and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments what a contrast in the bosom of Abraham which was analogous to the paradise he is in the bosom of Abraham Lazarus is but now the rich man is in Hell being in torments and I like that it's not being in torment he's in torments and it is and seeth Abraham a far off and now he's able to see Abraham and Lazarus in his bosom it's remarkable that on a daily basis he was able to see Lazarus carried by men to his gate and he was Ed maybe at multiple points in his day of Lazarus and there was always this image and then even after he dies he's not able to escape the image of the beggar but now he's no longer at his gates in hell he is now in the bosom of Abraham and he's being he's in torments now if we look at this picture now and I want you to consider what a horrific uh feeling that must have been that Jesus is trying to convey so what is the lesson that Jesus is trying to teach his disciples as their primarily his audience as he begin we'll come to it here at the beginning of the chapter he said unto his disciples but yet the the Pharisees and the publicans and all were very close to him uh uh hearing him give these Parables before as you look in chapter 15 and so they are the ones that kind of interject and they rebuke him and chide him in the middle of the chapter and so what is he trying to to teach his disciples also what is he rebuking to the in the Pharisees in verse 25 is Abraham speaking now to the rich man but Abraham's son said remember that thou in thy lifetime receivest thy good things and likewise Lazarus evil thing so there's really no splitting hairs about oh no it it was a blessing that he was full of sores and it was a blessing that he was laid at the gate we have to be careful sometimes the way that we characterize our suffering and realize hey that you know what suffering is suffering and abuse in any context is abuse and it's evil and so he suffered evil things now I realized that trying to figure out why God would allow certain things is is is a difficult exercise but he acknowledges that yeah the the rich man got good things Lazarus evil things but now in the final analysis with the Eternal weight now he is comfort and thou art tormented so I would ask who was the rich man ultimately as we pointed out Wednesday Lazareth means God is my help and maybe what a reproach for one who laid at the gate and people would say there's Lazarus God sure helped him out didn't he right and just the mocking and the ridicule that perhaps he would have endured but yet for for Lazarus we could say that the true riches are not material but spiritual that lazarus's wealth and abundance was not in Earthly Goods but his he was there was something spiritual about him that despite him being destitute he still trusted in God and so how do you know he trusted in God that when it came to his death and maybe he died because of infection maybe he died because of hunger or neglect but regardless we know that he died and maybe he died much more quickly than the rich man had died and the man had just completely forgot Lazarus was ever a beggar he just went home one day and he was no longer there and the dogs were off licking somebody else's sores and so yet we realize that Lazarus then comes to his end and his demise and it's then that God carries him away we could argue well how could you say that he was blessed and how could you say that he he was rich and and good things to the very end he trusted God and God honored his faith by carrying him into the bosom of Abraham he was rich in Heavenly things and spiritual things because that's what he inherited the Bible says in Proverbs 23:4 I will go ahead and acknowledge that I'm repeating a lot of things that have already been mentioned over this pulpit and and you're going to find eventually that I'm just always quoting the same Bible quoting the same messenger and and so Proverbs 23:4 says labor not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom so there's a wisdom of this Earth there's this base nature that we have where I need to get rich or di triing I need to get mine when I have the opportunity uh you know take advantage of these chances uh you look got after yourself I'm looking out after Numero Uno uh you you you you know there's a dog eat dog mentality it's a rat race uh these different things says cease from thine own wisdom so because you shouldn't be striving and stressing and laboring and exerting and putting everything into compiling wealth or riches sorry David Ramsey uh my my ambition in life is not to hoard wealth at least we should not labor to be rich neither should you labor to be poor give me poverty nor riches Just Give Me A Life That's pleasing to you 1 Timothy chapter 6: 17 and 18 as we've referenced this quite a bit in this theme charge them that are rich in this world so there are those that are rich in this world but Paul recognizes there must be a specific charge to them that are rich in this world to all the riches who are here there's a charge for you if you're rich in this world you are not to be high-m minded you are not to trust in those riches because they will fail you they are uncertain but trust in the Living God so if there are any here that would be considered wealthy or you have a little bit higher uh uh balance sheet on your Ledger than others would have it's so it's not that if you're rich you can't be a Christian you can't be a message believer but if you are rich you should always remember to not be high-minded not think more of yourself than you ought to to not be ar arant or presumptuous and whatever you do don't trust in your wealth trust in God and then makes a statement that we hope to revisit here in a few moments who gives us this living God who gives us richly all things to enjoy the use of the term richly I is not by accident God who is Rich lavishes us with things to enjoy he is he is generous towards us and therefore we realize I will not trust in the riches because I will ultimately recognize that there is a living God who has given richly to me therefore whatever I have he's given me he said then continuing to charge those that are rich in this world that they do good that they be rich in Good Works notice all these riches they that are rich in this world should trust in a God who is Rich and that they should be rich in Good Works ready to distribute of their riches willing to communicate through their wealth it's exactly what he's saying he doesn't mean ready to willing to communicate in other words always answer your text messages dude come on respond to emails in a timely manner return phone calls it's saying there ought to be a desire to make use of the richness of God in your life for the benefit of others and not just for yourself so Jesus is as he has phrased these things and he carefully crafted this Parable and I believe God watching out over its different tellings and its translations so that there could be thoughts conveyed to us Jesus is addressing the selfs serving self-preserving Behavior not just in the rich man but in the Pharisees and using it as instruction to his disciples don't be these people don't be like this it was selfishness verse is selflessness there was a selfishness on the part of the rich man there was a selfishness on the part of the way the Pharisees conducted themselves and so Jesus wants to kind of catch them in this moment especially after the Pharisees ridicule him on this prior parable about the unjust Steward and and he's he's wanting to reinforce these things it says in verse 14 and the Pharisees also who were Covetous they were lovers of riches they lusted after they desired it they labored to be rich they were self-serving and self-protecting when they heard these things they derided him now we'll come back to what these things are but notice this is the context for the parable of the rich man he says and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men it's an attitude where they're more concerned about being perceived to be right than actually being right there's always an excuse there's always an explanation there's always going a step further there's just no will willingness just to say yes that is how it is I agree I accept they justify themselves not even before God they're only worried about the pretense says but God knows your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God what would impress men doesn't impress God when the Bible says labor not to be rich it says cease from thine own wisdom this is what men would highly esteem one who is a go-getter one who hustles one who who knows how to make money and and a lot of times we applaud those who who make millions and then lose them just as easily but can always make them again a and we kind of like man these guys are amazing he made a million dollars and lost it made it again and lost it and we kind of admire this and we make them Our Heroes so guess what whatever you win by following that guy's trajectory you're probably going to lose cuz that's the way that it works so there's a certain wisdom of this world that go brother excuse me that Jesus is saying is highly esteemed among men but is an abomination in the sight of God that's important as we continue I'm I'm going way too slow today so we may just have to pick this up next Sunday but there is a uh you me to stop now I mean I don't know Portillo's open it's 11 o' should be there's a they justify themselves before men and they esteem certain things for pretense sake that God thinks is an Abomination like wow that was shrewd that was wise that was good but God says it's an Abomination to be selfish is to be devoted to caring only for yourself devoted to yourself caring only for yourself is to be concerned with your your own individual interest I I want to begin that with the individual if you are selfish you're concerned about yourself you're only devoted to caring for yourself and you're only worried about yourself now if we were to extend that to a family it would be a family that only lives to itself and s in a church the same way that we're just kind of protective of our image we're protective of our congregants we're protective of what we're doing and we never live beyond ourselves but to be selfless is to be concerned more with the needs and desires of others than what with one's own so to be selfless doesn't mean you couldn't care less about yourself or that you completely disregard yourself and you're into uh uh being taken advantage of and and and being abused and this is just what a Christian does no that's just that's the wrong kind of teaching so that someone from a position of power can keep taking advantage of you but it is that you have this mindset where you are concerned more with others needs you're concerned about yourself but you're not willing to take care of yourself at someone else's expense you're also concerned more with the needs and desires of others and not just your own needs now take into consideration then this definition of being selfish or selfless look at the response of the rich man when he suddenly dies and or say suddenly but he finds himself in hell and as Jesus tells the story he's in Hell being in torments and all of a sudden he's able to see from Hell Lazarus this one that was a beggar at his gate all these days or years or whatever it was he's in the bosom of Abraham he occupies the place that this rich man thought he deserved and had earned in life and Abraham and in seeing this notice what his immediate response is verse 24 and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me for I was a miserable wretch I was a grinch I did so many things wrong in life I was a scrooge I disregarded your son Lazarus was a good man forgive me for the way I treated him it's kind of like the kids are listening to some Adventures in Odyssey where they tell the story of Joseph if he was selfish was it selfish was the word is that the one or he didn't want to forgive and so his brother's like hey Joseph we're really sorry and he's like yeah you shouldn't have done that who wor you wore my coat who does that lock him up throwing him in jail and it leads to this terrible catastrophe where Aliens destroy the world it's like what kind of episode is this it's one of my favorites but if we reach told this in a way that maybe it should have been the rich man would have been horrified oh God Abraham have mercy on me I failed what you stood for your faith and I didn't do anything like you did you erected a Grove and the desert to take care of people like Lazarus and I got so caught up in my own things but notice you're already reading it so you know that I'm being dramatic have mercy on me in s Lazarus so that I can hug his neck and I could ask for forgiveness no that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flame you want to talk about character and all death does is change your Dwelling Place torments couldn't change this guy's character realizing that he had been wrong he still couldn't wake up right and what does he want from Lazarus could you dip your finger in water and comra the torments of hell and Fire to cool my tongue I want you to risk being burned I want you to risk departing from Abraham's bosom I'm in need here don't you see I'm in torments I'm burning up dip your finger in water and cool my tongue and some may say oh what a humble gesture this is arrogance at its worst hiding behind the pretense of oh I'll just take a drop and Lazarus is thinking well maybe Lazarus wouldn't be thinking it but we're thinking Lazarus just wanted a crumb dude I think your drop's a little too late bro he was self-centered you know how self-centered he was he knew lazarus's name so it's not like Lazarus was an unknown to him he immediately recognizes him he knows him by name and says Abraham have Lazarus come and cool my tongue I'm tormented recognize the nature of the rich man he never looked beyond himself even when he knew somebody's name Abraham you know how some people always call you by your name because they're trying to sell you something now listen Aaron Aaron Aaron I want to come up with a really weird name next time I run into a Salesman like that just to see if he can keep saying it right he never looks beyond his own possessions he never looks beyond his own wants in his own life in his natural life he never did that and now in Hell he's of the same character he still doesn't look Beyond himself he's oblivious in life he's oblivious and now in Hell he's oblivious still can't understand the true nature of his torment to think that it'd even be worth the effort to just put a drop of water on his tongue does he not recognize and appreciate the gravity of the situation I think there's a lot to think about whole lot to think about in this picture of this Rich Man versus Lazarus he never looked beyond acting doing you name it for himself if it wouldn't benefit him it wasn't worth undertaking and I'm I'm emphasizing this just so you could catch it personally he didn't regard Lazarus in life nor in death because he wanted him to sacrifice himself and do greater than he was willing to do in life he was clueless about what he needed I don't know if I'm going to have time today to get to it Devas was clueless about what he actually needed in life he let his riches obscure what he actually needed and worse yet it BL Ed him to the needs of others Luke 16: 1-15 this is an important context to the parable that we've been reading these last two Services the rich man and Lazarus should be I think it's better understood by the parable that Jesus has just told there are other things that are said in these prior chapters that kind of tie in as you look at the Lost coin and the lost son the lost sheep and the the prior chapter so there's definitely this continuity to these different themes they all tied together but here in particular after he has addressed the the scribes and these different critics and ones the publicans that had come unto him he said unto his disciples Luke 16 ver1 I believe I'm going to read all the way to verse uh 13 or 15 he says there was a certain rich man now he revisits the same phrase later on in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus so now I think there is some connection here in terms of status or or position uh certain privileges that one might have it may doesn't have to be the same person but we're looking at a certain class of people that present a certain way live a certain way think a certain way there was a c certain rich man which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his good what's good what's unique about this is there's not a clear connection between the rich man in God and the steward being Israel uh there there's it's something that's set forth in a way do you realize this is and I'm going to say this way it's almost as if this is a purely carnal Endeavor just like the unjust judge and the Widow that wearied him that he's using this in the sense that this is what the unjust does then he's saying if the wicked will do that how much more your father so in the same sense he's kind of saying this is just something that may happen in Natural Life a rich man has a steward and that word Steward there is comes from the word that we would use about a deacon uh one that is uh would is willing to serve a servant and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his Goods so this Steward had wasted his master's Goods he hadn't looked out after them he'd squandered them and he called the steward and said unto him how is it that I hear this of thee I've heard that you've been wasting my goods I hear that you haven't been managing these accounts properly and my estate's being wasted you're wasting the money so he says give an account of thy stewardship think of that give an account I'm holding you accountable for how you behaved with what I gave you give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer Steward now recognizing that he has been called out the steward again Jesus crafting this narrative is in a way that tells the point so sometimes what he doesn't say is just as important as what he's saying that the steward does not say that's a lie I've been honest the lord taketh away from me the stewardship he knew he had been found out I'm not willing to work and I got too much price to beg I cannot dig I'm not willing to work hard I'm not willing to do the labor that's beneath me to beg I am ashamed I am resolved what to do that when I am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses so critical to catch this in light of what we read about the rich man in Lazarus in other words he realizes he's about to lose his job so he's going to get all the supplies from the supply cabinet he possibly can he's about to lose his job so he's going to take advantage of all the resources he has kind of like if we were getting ready to leave Arizona we would all submit receipts for Esa funds everybody in the family I have an iPad for math I have an iPad for history I have an iPad for science right we'd all we would just lavish ourselves and take advantage of everything that was available to us because pretty soon if we're at least halfway honest we would stop doing it once we left but maybe there's a loophole so he is saying I want to do things now so that once I'm fired I will have gained the favor of others who will return kindness kindness to me and take care of me I'm going to be nice to somebody else so that when they see that I've been fired they'll take pity on me notice the sole reason for acting to benefit himself so he called every one of his Lord's debtors unto him and said unto the first how much thou owest unto my Lord how much do you owe my master he said a 100 measures of oil and he said take thy Bill sit down quickly and write 50 now I want you to know just how deceptive this is one owes oil so he's going to have him settle that account and he then he said another how much owest th and he said a 100 measures of wheat the other owes wheat so take thy Bill and write for score so notice there's different measures right based upon the there's a different value attributed to what the resource is so he is able to offer to the one a 50% discount the other 20% but then he could present the payoff as the opposite to his boss and Leverage come on you don't realize this kind of stuff happens he's going to leverage that to where his master thinks that he has settled the accounts and gained more but what he doesn't realize is one did 50 and one did 80 but now he's presenting it differently and he thinks this is shrewd the funds are Cod mingled he knows that they both ow he's essentially owed a hundred measures of this and a 100 measures of that but he's written out something different and he pays differently and then so you catch what's happening here this is all deceit and why is he doing it not because the guy that owns a hundred measures of oil needs a break and he's down on his luck he's probably a businessman just like the master but now this intermediary here's working on behalf of the master this goes to show the deceitful of riches the more wealth you have the more you have to rely upon others to manage and look after it and in that way there's always one who might stand in the middle and this one is taking doing these deals oh you owe a 100 write me a bill for 50 and you're let go and the guy's like sweet came out good on this deal he's a businessman right he's happy it's not necessarily ding someone down on their luck then the next one how many measures of wheat oh you know what you got a you 100 take write a bill for 80 sweet I made a better deal then the Lord the Lord here is not a capital l it is a the rich man it is a businessman it is a man whose wealth had become so great he relied upon stewards to look after his Affairs he commended the unjust Steward because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light I'll be honest this Parable is has been hard for me to figure out I think I've even recently preached on it just taking out phrases the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light and you can catch what Jesus is saying but this whole phrase where the Lord commended the unjust Steward there's a way that you can take his actions and maybe spin it to where his actions were commendable but the more I've studied this and wrestled with it in the context of Luke chapter 16 trying to figure out this rich man and now the unjust Steward he's given a name if if it's Devas maybe this and if there's a Justice this is unjustice and he is acting in a way that is ripping his boss off now whether or not the boss realized that the 80 came from the guy with the wheat and the 50 came from the guy with oil or it was reversed to where he's not he's not quite sure just how much was he was taken advantage of nevertheless it says that the Lord commanded the unjust St Steward because he had done wisely and the wisdom there is not the wisdom of God it's the wisdom of this world it's the wisdom that proverb says labor not to be re Rich cease from thine own wisdom in other words this Lord was impressed with the shrewdness of the unjust Steward I had a client one time he's going to be wiring I think uh you know $2 million into a trust account for a transaction and I was like I'll just charge a percentage and I did you I got paid very little but in this trust transaction it was like $20 million is initially going into my trust account and um and he go he was asking some questions about you know what kind of account it was and I used a particular one for deals like this uh and and so and and I said well and I just said um he's like well why why aren't you using an Iola is what it's called and it's a it's a trust funds lawyers oh my goodness I'm getting lost in the weeds flavor town guer and he asked me why was using this particular account I said hey I'm not I mean it's just a secure I'm I'm doing this in trust and he goes oh well hey I'm not worried about you running off with it if you did I'd be impressed right like I'd be impressed man I'd be a lot of Moxy for you to run off a 20 million and I knew right then I'm glad I'm not sending him money right he would be impressed cuz he's like man the guts for this lawyer to run off a 20 million knowing that he could probably just use it to defend and live off of for the rest of his life life so anyways this is kind of how this guy's thinking is like man I'm why didn't I think of that when I was coming up like a Gordon gecko type like wow you're shrewd you're slick like you figured it out man you you took advantage of these guys so he was impressed with his shrewdness but at the end of the day unjustice acted selfishly and he acted for his own interest everything he did was self-serving he'd been called out by for fraud and instead of apologizing for defrauding his master he doubles down on the fraud and continues to defraud his master for his own benefit by offering a deal to those that owned his dtor or his his master same attitude we take sometimes to our employers they're rich they'll never notice and and sometimes it horrifies me the attitudes that some employees have to their business a you can take it I don't care like um you didn't charge me for that $99 you know electronic part I'm like n it's okay you can keep it I'm like I don't know about that is your last name Best Buy right it's just one of those things you're like N I don't know that you're really are you allowed hey manager is he authorized to make this call right you want to be honest and upright and here he was doing this going these guys and he's making these deals and he's self-serving he's self-protective I cannot dig I'm not willing to work hard I'm not going to go get a hardworking job and I'm ashamed but I will cheat my my Lord to gain the favor favor of others notice he served neither his master nor his master's debtors he served himself and Jesus says he was unfaithful and we think oh who is the unfaithful too the debtors was he unfaithful to his master he's Unfaithful so Jesus now wants to bring this to a a relevant lesson now do you see how this attaches to The Story of Lazarus very very well and I say unto you verse 9 make to yourselves Friends of the mment of unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into Everlasting habitations what an interesting statement especially when you find later on when he gives the parable and it's almost as if did he have this queued up I mean did he know like he has this repository of Parables like based upon their response let go over here Lazarus rich man got it here because it fits perfectly here telling his parable about this man being received into Everlasting he's saying about you know make yourself Friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness when he says that it's worldly things worldly riches people of this world that when you die they may receive you into Everlasting habitations and then just in a moment he's going to be telling a parable about one man being in received into Everlasting habitations and another one being in hell and torments he says he that is faithful and that which is least is faithful also in much the unrighteous Mamon is the least it's not even what determines whether or not we're rich and so if we are not faithful in unrighteous things it's what then how can we be faithful in the things that really count or really matter if if you're if you're miserable wretches towards one another right if you're selfish and self-serving if you're dishonest if you're always fighting and always cheating if you can't handle this life which is the least how can you handle eternal life he that is faithful and that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches I believe that God wants to commit to us the true riches which are himself which is revelation which is favor and his Blessing but there's this certain uh barometer now where he saying how can I bless you with the greater spiritual things when you are knowingly Reckless about natural things and if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's who shall give you that which is your own in other words we are stand as joint heirs and to inherit a possession in God which is our very very own but how can you how can you then be found faithful if you can't even manage the things that have been given you even naturally so he brings it to this head and this is what caused the Pharisees to be so upset because they were Covetous and they derided him and ridiculed him he says no man can serve two masters for either he'll hate the one and love the other or else he'll hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and th this other Master Mammon and if I could even if I could use this you cannot serve God and serve yourself because let's just be honest this serving Mammon is not altruistic I'm just I'm just working hard man and so that the world can just get richer I mean I just I'm doing this I know I'm going to get fired so I'm just going to go and work hard like I should have and I'm going to give some of my own savings get some of my 401k back and I'm going to give I'm going to just forego some of my vacation and I'm going to work really really hard once I get a new job digging ditches and I'm going to pay the master back for everything I stole from him like the people who say that you I'm going to declare bankruptcy and I'm going to get my debts wiped out but I'm going to keep track cuz one day I'm going to go back and pay them all anybody know any Christian that's ever done that I'm just curious I'm not saying I'm not trying to call that attitude out necessarily but I'm just saying this guy does not have that attitude the Mamon he served was for himself Pharisees were the same way that's why it bothered them so much the unjust acted in his own interest and for his own protection against his master's interest against the interest of others so I realize I'm just going to have to close in here but we're all stewards we should all on some level find ourselves as a steward this man was a servant to a rich man there was this relationship where one had the wealth that he entrusted to somebody else who was to look out after it and manage it but yet he was wasting it in the end he was going to get fired so his final Act of courage and finally you know getting up and doing something was to further cheat his boss not to give a good deal and to show favor to the debtors but to rather Curry favor for himself that once he is fired by this master who knows what he was saying is like yeah I'm going to do a deal look my master wants to sue you he wants to bankrupt you he's going to go after you for everything you're worth but you know it's Memorial Day weekend I'm going to offer you a deal I'll cover the other 50 it's on me you don't worry about it and he cuts these deals and then he gets fired he says yeah he fired me for standing up for you you know I took a loss and they're like oh man stay with me man right you're on my team now and you know probably they're thinking do you think you could do that deal with somebody else for me because I got a lot of people that owe me money or you I got I owe a lot of other people money maybe you could figure this out and you could go around and you could figure things out for me in whatever context that this Steward was represented we can find ourselves on some level from the youngest of us to the oldest of us a steward and if that seems difficult for us to understand and you certainly reject maybe or maybe you reject the idea that you're a steward to the government what it does for you or a steward to this employer but we are all stewards and everything that we have in terms of money are trust funds and everything that we have in terms of time is trust time in 1 Corinthians chapter 4: 1-2 Paul is saying now as he took ownership of his stewardship of the Gospel he says let a man so account of us as a steward he's willing to be held accountable he was not thinking oh I've been called on the carpet I'm going to come up short he says no I know I'm going to be held accountable so I'm going to do as I ought as of the min of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God let so man account of us I'm willing to be held accountable moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful Paul is taking own ownership of his stewardship as a minister of the Gospel of stewardship of the Mysteries that have been revealed to him he is saying this about himself but he says stewards are required to be found faithful and all of us here are stewards of something we are stewards of time we are stewards of money we are stewards of the faith and belief that we have we're stewards of a household we're stewards of our spouses we're stewards of our children we're stewards of others and we are not to live in a way to where we're only looking out after ourselves but we have to look beyond our gate and know that there's usually a Lazarus at our doorstep that there's others that are in our lives and in our orbit who knows how many people Devas walked by not just outside his gate but in his own house his son sitting there depressed on his couch his daughter over there with an eating disorder at the table his wife over there pulling her hair out in the laundry room and just walks right past it right to go do his Recreation to do the things that helps him relax in the evening and is completely oblivious to everything else going on in the home the Bible says in Colossians 4:5 walk in wisdom now this is a different wisdom this isn't the wisdom that the uh Lord commended the unjust Steward for walk in wisdom toward them that are without Redeeming the time that phrase Redeeming the time is amazing to think that there's a way to live wisely where you can redeem lost time as the phrase is slow down we don't have a moment to waste there's a way that we can redeem the time with the way that we live the way that we act the way that we serve walk in wisdom and it just doesn't say walk wisely for your own benefit walk in wisdom towards them who don't have wisdom walk wisely for the benefit of those who aren't wise sometimes we just have such arrogance about us toward it's like well I know and they're just stupid then behave yourself wisely for the benefit of the one that doesn't know better demonstrate for somebody the right way to handle something demonstrate give the right example don't just sit back and say well if it was me I'd know exactly what to do and but afford the right example walk in wisdom even if it be in the actual words walk in wisdom towards them that are without if I could say this selfishness is one of the most destructive forces in any relationship self-centeredness is one of the most destructive forces in terms of trust and confidence if you can't trust that someone else is acting in the benefit of others and not just themselves if you feel like there's always something in it for them that's the worst kind of Leaven to sew into a relationship is selfishness and self-centeredness the unjust use the rich man's wealth and I don't know why to me it almost draws it it's like this is when you want I wish I knew these guys names um I don't know what they what their names are but I know something like Ben Shapiro would argue with Barack Obama I don't know I don't know who these people are anymore but this argument of well you know it's the the Socialist idea you'd be nothing without me the pencil makers right you'd be nothing without me I'm make the pencils but then the argument is but the the boss is the one that built the plant and provided the resources and there's always this two class system and it's all going to be a big Civil War one day and we're going to see who wins and uh depending on who you vote for in November and I really regret that we never got to do the Christmas play that would have been amazing but now we have yet another opportunity with another election cycle with Trump in it the unjust unjustice used his master's wealth for his own benefit and his own protection he may have been able to support a Lifestyle by wasting his master's goods and now he realized that the time was short and he couldn't just keep cheating his master it was that gig was going to be up and he immediately thinks I'm not willing to work hard to maintain my lifestyle I'm not willing to dig which would have been one of the lowliest jobs that could be had he says I'm not willing to dig and I got too much pride to beg this is the attitude of the rich man and so think about how Devas looked down on Lazarus who begged at his gate this was a man that wasn't willing to dig and a man who's Too Proud to Beg it was for his own PR profit and protection and so what Jesus is teaching us is to be righteous stewards knowing according to 1 Timothy 6 that a living God has given us all things to enjoy your health your wealth your time and I'm saying it today to Christians there's nothing you have in life that God has not allowed or has he's if there's anything good he's given you things richly to enjoy and th all those things you're stewards of children are the heritage of the Lord You're a steward over the children he gives you a spouse is the greatest thing that God could give you outside of Salvation a wife that's you're a steward over that you begin to think about relationships and interactions and all these different things he's teaching us that we ought to be righteous stewards as God has given us all things to enjoy teaching us that we ought to use what he has made available to us not solely for our own benefit but for the benefit of others musicians if you'd come I just I need to stop not even halfway finished but I just I need to stop here in Mark chapter 8: 3 34- 38 and this might be just a perfect place to pick back up next Sunday morning and when he had called the people unto him with the disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it what is his pronouncement take up the cross and follow me for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels this may seem a little bit disjointed without the context of the rest of these scriptures and quotations I wanted to share this morning but maybe just to see the the future sermon to take up the cross and follow requires be a selfless if I could just say this to take up the cross is self-denial let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me that phrase it let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me in other words there's a pattern of behavior that Christ demonstrated there's a way that he lived a way that he uh acted we could insert into here sermon after sermon after sermon on the thought that he eternal life is living for others that if we live just to ourselves that's a selfish life so to deny myself and take up the cross and follow him that is in itself its selflessness and as we'll find out next time Devas is introduced to us in this Parable but Christ is showing us the future of a certain rich man he's already spoken in the parable then later you'll find it in Luke chapter 18 Jesus is approached by a ruler a certain ruler and he is the living image of Devas the rich man it's the Rich Young Ruler and what is it that Jesus said he lacked sell all thou Hast take up your cross and follow me if if we're ever going to have a home of Honor we're going to have to start living outside of ourselves if you're rich in this world take the charge that Paul gave to Timothy to charge those that are rich in this world whatever you have been given I'll hopefully amplify this to in a much greater way in future services but use what God has given you for the benefit of others in studying some of the Parables may maybe not the parable but just the Life of Christ and the way that he handled certain situations it's it's astounding that in his moment of grieving and sorrow wherein La his friend or excuse me John the Baptist his cousin has died he's been murdered at the hands of an unjust man and he tells his disciples let's just get away and rest I believe it's Matthew that gives us the greater details to this I and let's get away and rest and the the the crowds kind of got idea that they're going out to the Wilderness to get away to rest and they hurry up and they beat him there and Jesus is wanting to get away to grieve the death of his cousin and he comes to these Shores and as he lands there I'm going on vacation we need a break we've been working so hard I need to rest and here's Christ and he sees the multitudes and when he would have been right to grieve for himself he sees the multitudes thousands upon thousands in the telling of the story 5,000 men just the men and it says he had compassion and his thought was they need to eat and you know we would say oh no no no Jesus you're on vacation man let them starve let them they're they're they're adults let them figure it out they they shouldn't that was Reckless for them to come all out here in the wilderness you know how far away the nearest Ros is that's on them to come all the way out here in the wilderness and Jesus says we need to feed him and I'm should have had all this prepared but there's kind of this argument man we're in the middle of nowhere the disciples says we are out in the middle of the barren Wilderness and you're telling us to go get food for them and we can't afford that take I think they said it takes a half a year salary to feed these people and they're asking themselves how are we ever going to feed them and Jesus instead of panicking just says well what do you have what do you have here's a need and you're already rationalized it's too great there's no way I can help oh they're trying to get books to Botswana trying to get this to this place there's all these things we're trying to do and oh there's no way there's no way we could ever help there's no way we could come up with those Millions it's like well we're not asking for you to go buy takeout for 5,000 people but the only thing you can start with is what you have what do you have and they had Five Loaves and two fish and there's some especially in the taling of Mark it's so amazing Mark doesn't say anything other than that Jesus took it and blessed it and the next thing we know they had enough leftovers to fill 12 baskets and Mark leaves out the miraculous in how that there was the bread was multiplied and the fish was multiplied suggesting that there was something and I don't think he suggested it but leaving it silent it's look by asking the disciples what they had and being willing to offer what they had they as they gave God made it go further and that God you all you could do is be responsible for what he's given you well they said they need a million dollarss well you don't have any money at all what can you give what is that in your hand what is it you have to offer are you willing to give even what you have even to think that as the story is told ad Divas could have just brushed his hands off as he left he's got a Carolina's green chili breakfast burrito and he could just shakeing a little bit out as he walked by there was he could have done something for Lazarus and then in the end he said oh just let me have a drop of water I do think it's challenging I really do think it's challenging and God saying what is it that you have that you can offer and there is this sense in scripture to where gluttony is this excessiveness where one consumes and hoardes more than is necessary and the sin of gluttony is not necessarily just in eating alone and that doesn't absolve us who struggle with that but it it kind of maybe brings us into more fellowship with others who are gluttonous with other things they don't know when to stop and when to preserve or give or share and let others have they hoard everything for themselves and if anything Jesus is really attacking this selfish self-centered mindset of the rich man who only lived to himself and that's why in the end he really was poor in the end that's why he would only ever have what he made [Music] but the blessings of the Lord maketh rich and he addeth no sorrow to it could you stand with me as we pray today
