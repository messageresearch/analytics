TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Romans 43 and4 reads like this for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt amen this evening we want to speak about good success and you think where where would this tie in but I pray that you'll you'll see that here shortly good success and I wonder if we could just bow our heads for a word of prayer precious Heavenly Father Lord we uh deem it a great honor Lord to be able to address Your Blood Washed bride and Lord to uh be able to just count ourselves one of them and a child of God lord it's I'm humbled and I'm honored Lord Lord we just pray that as your presence is already here that Lord you'll begin to minister to our needs that as we each by faith hold our needs before your Great and Mighty presence that Lord as the word of God is now ministered and the truth to this great Eternal Word that's been pinned down Lord we pray that your spirit would have preeminence and freedom Lord to move about the aisles and Lord minister to each of the needs in every individual heart and I pray that Lord God you would do the supernatural that thing that which only you can do and that would be to answer those needs that would not be known to a man but only before you God and I pray that Lord as the the word of God sets us free as Lord we have sung these songs of Zion and as your presence comes near Lord we would be uh set free to receive Lord your promises and Lord to Worship You freely for it we ask that you would uh just have your way tonight in our hearts and our lives for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can be seated in Romans chapter 5 and brothers I've got a little bit of a a ringing up here I don't okay you can hear that good Romans chapter 5 and verse 17 it says for If by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ we have a uh an employee Bible study that I that I we have in my home every week and we've been going through we last year went through the book of Hebrews and this year we're going through the book of Romans and We Came Upon This this scripture and I I I as often do I read right over it this Romans chapter 5 verse 17 and somebody just pointed it out and said that's an interesting statement the gift of righteousness and I thought why is that such a strange statement and as we got into uh discussing the just righteousness in itself it it opened up uh a a great discussion and as we began to look at righteousness and as we took this scripture in Romans 4 and: 3 and 4 we notice that where it says for what sayith the scripture he Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt and this counted and reckoned are the same word and when you uh go through your your your Bible and you read your your your margins and you you look at the footnotes this word reckoned and and counted is the same as imputed and so when you begin tying these words together and you start picking up all these other scriptures that talk about how that sin was not imputed unto this one and how that that that righteousness wasn't imputed to him for believing and we we we we see this that that as Abraham simply believed God it was reckoned unto him for righteousness and we thought this is this is really interesting this this idea of of righteousness where is this Reckoning this word Reckoning where does this come from this imputation or this Reckoning and it takes you back into the Book of Leviticus chapter 25 and I want to read a portion of this for you it says after that he is sold now what this is discussing is that a man an Israelite there was a law that was given throughout the land and and and this law was that if a man that was given a portion of land the Promised Land if he was to fall on hard times if he was to uh uh his life was to go a direction he wouldn't desire it to go he could begin to sell his possessions in order to have h a means of living well if it got so bad he wouldn't just sell off his possessions his animals and the things he owned he would begin selling off his land and then if it got in even worse he could sell himself into bondage but with all of the things that he sold whether it be his stuff his land or himself there was a law that was put into place that that that that he he it was always his it was always his and that after a jubilee year which was every 50 years right whether he was to have the money to purchase it back before then or not when that Jubilee trumpet sounded he was set free and all of his possessions had to be returned to him right and if he had sold himself into bondage then he was free he was a free man and and it was wonderful because that Jubilee year it was a whole year of of freedom and no work and we all like that and we're wondering when is they when are they going to reintroduce the Jubilee year tired of you know just student debt being written off we want a whole year written off and but what's so beautiful about this now this Reckoning is this and and and and many of the commentators they they recognize it and even scoffield will put it in his notes and and many many of these men have have caught it and put it in their notes the Reckoning part is this imagine it was you or or a family member that had sold their land we'll just we'll we won't even look at they sold thems but they sold their land and if you in your mind are going no no no I want it I want it in my mind I want them to have sold themselves that's fine so your your cousin your uncle your your close brother sold themselves into bondage the way the price was figured of how much that person would be sold for was always reckoned to the Year of Jubilee so had they Fallen had they fallen on Hard Times in year 40 they only had the price that was to be paid was only for the rest of the 10 years that was all the person was going to pay cuz they said if they were buying the land they said look I'm only going to get 10 years worth of harvest off this land I'll pay this much for it now the beautiful thing is is if a person sold themselves into bondage you could pay your way out you could pay your own way out if you like if you desired but if you didn't have the means to do it the person that the only person that could do it was a Kinsman right A near Kinsman right so somebody out that doesn't follow the laws of your land somebody in a foreign country could not come and say hey I'd like to pay the price they say no no no no no unless you're playing by these rules you don't get to play they had to be able to recognize the year Year of Jubilee and how that the pricing was uh was figured in all of this now if a near Kinsman saw their near Kinsman in bondage and said I can't know I can't see it I don't want it I won't allow it and he said I'm going to go pay I want to go pay the the the price to set my K my near Kinsman free when they would pay that price whatever it is and whatever that was whether it would be the land or the person or the stuff if it' be the person let's imagine it was the person and they paid the price that person was free right then and there not to serve their near Kinsmen they were free amen that the Kinsmen that paid the price paid it not so that they could get the credit not so that they could own that person but they set them free totally free for their sake for them and what's even what what what's better is that perhaps that person who was in bondage let's say they had 10 years left worth of until the Jubilee and every day was a grind and every month was a grind every year was a grind but but they were always looking how many 10 years 10 years to Jubilee till Jubilee but if a ker Kinsman came and paid that price those people had their Jubilee right then and there they didn't have to wait 10 years to be set free they didn't have to wait till the end of the 10 years to tell their relative oh now I'm free no as soon as that price was paid that was a jubilee to them they were free now the Reckoning is this the Reckoning is for the person who's who is the near Kinsman what he is doing is he's paying the price and that price of freedom is reckoned unto the man in bondage that freedom is is reckoned to them like the Year of Jubilee is right now it's reckoned as though this is that year right now and I I I'm going back brother John I'm I'm I'm just going back to this Romans chap 4 and veres 3 and 4 when it says that what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted or reckoned unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh to him that would pay his own debt would work work hard enough to pay off his own debt the reward is not reckoned of Grace but of debt but if the near Kinsman came and paid that price it's just by Grace that's just Grace what's so beautiful and and this is where we begin rejoicing in in the thought of this uh kinsman redeemer is that we are looking for this restoration this this returning back to the state of Eden going back to this and the idea the reason that we're looking for that is because what was lost in the garden was what was was given to man was was given in the very beginning by God to man to have dominion but man lost that Dominion man fell and lost that dominion and we're Desiring to have that Dominion back now this is what that what really got me excited was so many times we feel that the the Kinsmen redeeming part the part that we love so much and is when we look at the story of Boaz and Ruth it's it's the clearest picture we have probably in the Bible of a kinsman redeemer and the the the thought is so beautiful to think that that Boaz loved Ruth so much that he paid uh for Naomi and and the and and by paying uh for what the the restoration for all of Naomi's Goods since she had left that land he got Ruth as part of the deal and we love that and and we and and the imagery is so beautiful to think that Christ who died upon the cross though he was it was his own children the the the children of Israel crying for his blood and how that Christ said father forgive them these are my children forgive them and in dying and shedding blood for for those children of Israel he got himself a gentile bride with it and we love that that's so beautiful but but but that that idea is with a thought of that the Kinsman is paying a price so that he gets something but the idea of this paying this Reckoning price is not so that he gets something he owns it all he owns this whole world he owns the universe he owns you and me he owns all of it anyway so what the price he's paying for is giving you back what belongs to you what belongs to me and that is what is so wonderful is when we begin then thinking about the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a down payment for an Earnest and how that brother brandham says you've received now an arcade now go and explore it climb the ladders and look in every nook and cranny and see what belongs to you and when you begin to think of those children of Israel who crossed over Jordan and and crossed over that kanes barnea and finally were given that promised land and when Joshua and the children of Israel took that land and drove out the enemies and then finally when it was all said and done Joshua began dividing up the land by divine inspiration and saying Reuben this land is yours then Reuben could could from that time on take as long as they wanted to go and and walk every inch of that land and say this is all Reuben's right yes that's all Reuben I'd like to see what all Reuben owns I'd like to see every bit of it I'd like to plunge a shovel into it and see what color the soil is and is it Rocky is it fertile is it clay what is it and and the others uh uh Ephraim and Dan and man and all these ones that are exploring their land and taking what's theirs and and and taking the time to say well let's today take a stroll and see what's down by the beach some of us love beaches and somebody told me once now Christians do not go to the beach they visit the ocean I said fair enough but some love mountains and some love deserts and some love jungles and some love ice and snow and rain and everything else but now brother Erin touched on this in the message a matter of faith in Revelations 3 and: 7 and to the Angel of the church in Philadelphia right these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth now brother brandom in the church age book takes a a just a a a a a portion and he's he's pulling each of these phrases apart and he takes this portion of he that is true and brother Aaron read these things and I thought oh so tremendous I've I I I want to I want to look at that I want to study that and brother BR says these things saith he that is true now this word true is a very wonderful word and my when brother Matt was speaking who you know what is truth and I thought oh this is beautiful it does not mean true in just the sense that it is opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial IAL realization for example we recall that Jesus said in John 6:32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven John 15:1 I am the True Vine Hebrews 9:24 for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for US 1 John 2:8 because the darkness is PED and the True Light now shineth since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before antitype contrasted with type typ and substance with Shadow take the example now of Mana from Heaven God sent down Angel bread from heaven for Israel but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day if it was left around it became contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from heaven whereof Mana was just a type and if any man eats from Heaven whereof Mana was just a t If any man eats of that bread that came from Heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again am the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality Jesus Christ was here he was reality no need any longer for a shadow no need for a partial salvation here is the whole of it just like Jesus isn't a part of God he is God that's what so excited me when I when we got into this idea of righteousness if you go and you read Romans and you just just read through and you start that let that word just begin to pop out to you it's it is replete through the book of Romans righteousness righteousness righteousness righteousness and it's all it's because of this sticky human nature that wants to be able to do something to achieve righteousness to be justified to be right with God I don't want to be wrong I want to be right with God and when this this antitype of of of uh that the the Jubilee and selling yourself into bondage is merely a shadow on a wall it's it's simply though it really did happen and men were really selling themselves into bondage we begin to realize that the real bondage is not our physical what we're doing physically on a daily basis but that we as as mankind have been caught up in bondage and that bondage isn't necessarily uh to just to the World perhaps our bondage has been to religion perhaps our bondage has been to a church our bondage has been to an idea and and it was what we could do what we could do but when the real when we begin to recognize that righteousness is Jesus Christ that he fulfilled the righteousness that he was the Fulfillment of Jubilee that he was the Fulfillment of the atonement day when we begin to realize wait why are we still looking at the the the shadows and why are we still looking at the types the price has already been paid for righteousness the righteousness has been given and I'm free to take it I'm free to have it oh my then then then you you're you're you're mine and your soul begins to Bubble up my mind then begins to go now to this idea of success and I've always uh I've always I guess admired um I I don't know I guess great great achievements great great feats of men uh um I used to be real heavily involved when I was a young man my boy's age in in athletics and and and and so then you learn you know that competitiveness and grew up you know rooting for a team you know it was as a boy the San Francisco 49ers they were winning all the all the super bowls with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice and Ronnie lot and I you know it was like hey just Nobody Greater you know Joe Montana's the greatest quarterback there ever was and and Jerry Rice the greatest receiver there ever was and and they just stacked this team was just stacked with just such great then they got Steve Young and he just kept going but it was always oh you know Joel Montana and and then I grew up and in high school I'm running track and track and field and you know Michael Johnson who ran the fastest 400 meter and perhaps the 200 meter and now his records have all I think been broken and so forth but it was that idea of of somebody who's who's the greatest at whatever it is that they do they were the they were they were the the the the image of success in what they did and I I I always thought it was merely with with Athletics but as I got older I realized even in the workforce even in in my job uh that that idea of success can just be transferred you know from one thing to another and I found myself as I looked back over my life I was chasing success I was looking for Success this idea of success and you know there's only one scripture in the Bible that even mentions the word success one scripture Joshua chapter 1 verse 8 but I'm going to read verses 5-8 Joshua 1 veres 5-8 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide provide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do Accord according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success it's the only scripture brother Aaron read this scripture again in a matter of Faith Revelations 3: 17-18 because thou th sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold dried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see this idea of a people who imagine they're successful and as brother Aaron was discussing it's a matter of perspective in their perspective they're rich they have no what they don't have any need of anything but in God's perspective Ive they're poor they're miserable they're naked and they don't know it so there's this idea of I want to be successful and I I would want to say tonight I I titled it good success but I I I wanted to say I want success I want suc success I want I would want you to be successful I would want everybody in this room to be successful I would want these children to be successful and all that they would put their minds to I'd want them to be successful so now the question is what then would that mean to be successful well we if we were saying well we we we financially successful of course we would want that I would want that for each and everyone Health healthwise you'd want to be successfully healthy in life of course of course of course of course but I look at just like righteousness this fight that we have in this sticky flesh I want to be right I want to be right I want to be right what can I do what can I do what can I do and then when it becomes clear you can't or you can try all you'd like but success has already been purchased brother brandom says but we find here that God in spite of all the failure that Moses had done he still had his hand on him and he called him to go do his service called him to his commission and what a consolation that must have been to Joshua when he heard God say as I was with Moses so will I be with you although if I'm trying and I fail God won't leave me I love that I had to highlight those because I that's how I feel oh God it would be such a consolation to hear those words through Revelation through audibly however that would be as I was with Moses ah so will I be with you what a consolation but to then to know if I fail if I'm trying and I fail God won't leave me I never have much confidence in anybody that's too afraid to do anything I would rather be found a failure than too lazy to try one time it was said that the Ballard and Ballard Flower Company hired a man and he was going to sign his name and the man had no eraser on the end of his pencil and Mr Ballard said said to him said why haven't you got an eraser he said I don't make mistakes he said then I can't use you because if you don't make mistakes you won't do nothing that's true God don't hold you responsible for your mistakes he holds you responsible for your willful sin he that sins wul after he has received the knowledge of the truth but a man that's going to do something is going to blunder he's going to fall he's going to make mistakes but if he's really divinely called and God is in his heart he'll rise again it's a promise he'll rise again he'll rise again he'll rise again now brother brandom says a little bit down in the same message as I was with Moses so I'll be with with thee that's my desire Brethren to see my church cross over into another land a desire to move over to the other side if there's something in you here first calling there will be something to respond to that call just sitting down to sheep raising ain't enough for you go into some sort of of a business is not enough for you join the church and put your name on the book is not enough for you because there's something called on across the ridge Yonder across the next Ridge and all across Jordan until you fall into the arms of God Yonder a deep calling unto a deep good these are just my feelings this is just how I feel when I hear this it speaks true to my heart and I believe every believer has got this feeling in their heart that just raising sheep that's not good enough just to get a good job that's not enough for me right just to join a church just to just to go just to be a part of a church it's not enough there's something more there's something more for me there's something more I want some would say well that but that's a good life that's every successful man I know that's what they do but I want more than that that's not the success I'm looking for there's something more I told this story to the youth and I'm doing good on time praise the Lord I told this story to the youth and I'll tell it to you I had the priv of listening to a a a man and I'll give you a little bit of his backstory he um was a young man was uh had grown up uh his father was a sports writer he was very uh athletic had good genes and um as he grew up he played uh he was playing Athletics this young man but his real love he found was football and he became real successful in football did really well so well that he got a scholarship full ride scholarship um for athletics to a a a university as a quarterback and he uh he said I put all my chips you know I put all my eggs in that one basket was Athletics everything was in on that but he got injured and he fell out and that was that so then he because of I think maybe some help around him and and and the people that he knew his father and so forth he was able to get um some really nice jobs as he gotten out of out of college he gotten some very nice jobs and he had worked with uh in in Washington DC with some campaigns and and then after these campaigns he uh got a job as a Trader and uh was was doing very well with the trading but he through throughout from the time he was in high school and on he had gotten caught up into using drugs and by the time he was had this great job and this well-paying job he was he was an addict he was a real addict and he was introduced to uh to re worse and worse drugs as he went along and he became such an addict that all the money begins to pour into that and all your energy begins to pour into that and to pay for his habit he began burglarizing and and doing a lot of burglarizing and and very indepth and high-end burglarizing and finally when he got caught and he did get caught um he was in jail and and they were sentencing him and he didn't he he thought burglarizing you can't you know what are you going to get for burglarizing but he ended up his sentencing gave him a life sentence in in fact life sentence I think was 60 years and he got 65 years in prison and his mother and father who were professed Christians had said now there's there some stipulations when you go to prison that you owe us as your parents one is you'll never join a gang in prison and the other is you'll never you'll never tattoo your body and he promised his mother he made that promise I'll do none of those things well as he was awaiting uh all the processing to get shipped off to prison he's asking all the people that had gone to prison how do I survive how am I going to survive in prison and all these real hardened CRI criminals told him the same answer every time you've got to join a game it's the only way to survive well he promised his mother he wouldn't so he finally ran into this older gentleman who had given him some advice he said are you done listening to all these other people who don't aren't giving you good good answers he said yeah if you he said you want to really know how to survive I'll tell you how and he and he gave him a a list and I don't want to go through all of that but in the end this man never joined a gang never tattooed his body and the man because he G he surrendered his life to God while he was in prison and he eventually has now got a lifetime parole and he's out in this I I I know in the United States I don't know if he's going around the world he could be he's certainly gone to most of the major university and stalked to most of the mo of the collegate teams um and told them his story and so he's he's written books and he's and he's his life has absolutely been transformed but this there was a a piece of advi the the piece of advice that was given to him in prison I believe this advice could be not only said about prison life but life in general and and I don't just mean this will apply to somebody out there this is good for children in high schools and good for motivational speaking to to people of the world this can apply to a church life this can apply to a believer's life and this man his name was Mr Jack and he told him this he said prison and I would say I'll just change the words so that I'm telling you the story now life is like a pot of boiling water and there's three things that you're going to put into this water this boiling water in life and the first thing is a carrot when you put a carrot into a pot of boiling water what happens it gets soft it gets soft the carrot loses its rigidity and it becomes soft and mushy and it can't hold and the trials of Life can can absolutely wipe a person out can make him and I don't mean soft as in a contrite spirit and a and a broken that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about not being able to to to make a stand in life not even able to make a stand for God and make a stand for your convictions it can break your very will trying to think it was brother Aaron I I really appreciated here a few weeks ago he he had quoted from Proverbs that if a man uh his body is broken his a spirit within him will but if a man's Spirit be broken he's no good I thought that's so good that's so true and and and and God that is such a truth and thank you for putting that in your word because God has given us a spirit that when we are broken as human beings when we're broken through trials of Life the spirit of Christ within us can re revive us again it can it can bear us up and it can give us give us Supernatural strength and fortitude to to to press to press the battle and so Trials of this life can make you like that carrot they can make you soft where that you you you you've got no stand you you've lost all that the second thing that can go into this pot of boiling water is an egg and what happens if you put an egg in a pot of boiling water it gets hard the soft insides those parts that are inside that are meant to be soft those parts that should should have that that yoke that life that that that movement that protection of the Yoke it gets hard and and and and and not uh not hard as in what we just said able to stand up against but hard against everybody else as brother brandham said you like a sticker you punch as brother uh Aaron's meme is punching you you punch at everything you become hard you become bitter and that's what happens to the egg he said but there's a third thing that you can put in that boiling water and that is a coffee bean and I know brother Chris likes that he's my coffee supplier with Winker Beans but that third thing is a coffee bean and what happens when you put a coffee bean in boiling water it makes coffee doesn't change the bean doesn't make it softer it doesn't make it harder it it makes what's in that bean come out and and the story is that what what is in that being that with the other two things it was those that that element that boiling water affected the that that element you put into the water but when with the Coffee Bean you affect the very thing that is that was affecting the other things you transform the atmosphere with that coffee bean life and this was told to this man in prison and it stuck with him so much that it transformed his life and he in his heart said I've got to become that coffee being and and and and in in in my prayer when I when I hear this story and I tell this story to young men when I tell this story to young men that are that are that are are are are of working age or or are trying to get through school and they're trying to find their way in life they're trying to find the direction that they're going and with all their heart they want to live for God they want to serve God and they want to live in this world that that that is that would love to affect them or infect them and and they're wanting to know what am I as a Believer which direction am I supposed to go what am I supposed to do how am I supposed to withstand the elements of this life and the idea is that oh God when I begin to think of success and and and I think you know what do I need for this to be successful what are the elements that are outside that can affect my sucess uccess my my prayer and my heart says God let the not the the the thing of success but the who the person of success that's inside that when the pressures of life that when the when everybody wants to see you stand or fall one or the other as as John Wesley uh I I believe put it that set a man on fire and people will come from all over to watch him burn well you think well that could be a real good thing or that could be a real bad thing some people want to watch a man burn but others want to watch a man burn they want to watch the fire that that lights that man on fire and gets him excited about the things of God and I say let that righteousness that that that person of righteousness that when the Trials come the righteousness begins to come out it's not my righteousness that comes out it's not my success that would come out it wasn't Joshua who who who had to produce success in order to get the children of Israel but God said as I was with Moses I will be with you Joshua and my heart begins to burn and I begin to get excited because I know that if he made the promise he can [Music] deliver that this good success is not what I can do it's not what I have to do but my kinsman redeemer paid the price and it's been reckoned to me and I can I can receive my Jubilee I don't have to wait for some certain year for some certain message to be preached but I can have a jubilee in my vehicle on the ride to work I can have a jubilee in my prayer closet I can have a jubilee as soon as I recognize that that righteousness has been purchased for me to have access to that I'm right with God that I'm Justified with God that I don't have to work it up I don't have to in the morning say okay now okay where do I start the day how do I get this righteous man to be successful in my life he's in there he's in there let the elements take place let the circumstances take place in life that that righteous man can begin to come out that that success of a believer of a Joshua of a Caleb that can follow the word of God and the spirit of God and and in your heart you say God you know my heart you can open up your heart before him and say God though I failed though I've fallen though I've made mistakes God you know my heart is open before you my desire my very desire My heart's desire though it may be covered over with so much carnality and so much of my own thinking and my own desires God you know that deep down inside is that seed that God you have quickened that that success that I'm looking for in life is that righteousness that righteousness of God brother brandom make makes this statement I had another one but I I thought for the sake of time I wouldn't I wouldn't read it maybe I will you don't have this brother John but I'd like to read this this is from Israel in the church number five just so that I I always like to to have more than one instance of brother brand saying something it it just gives a real good Firm Foundation that it's not just a one-time instance but brother bam says this not long ago out in the west I was having a meeting I went home with an old Rancher for dinner oh and some of his people had been healed he' give me a check there that would have bought me 45 of these Tabernacles if I'd wanted I said I don't want your money Howard my brother was with me said Bill why didn't you take the check I said I don't want his money let me live day by day not money I'm after I'm one to serve the Lord Jesus he stood there when that woman was healed out yonder the the mikans in California you seen it here in the Louisville paper when they come here two of those agents and brought a million $500,000 and offered it to me when I lived in this two room Shack I said I don't even want to look at it no sir no sir the love of money is the root of all evil keep away from that stuff this Rancher walked out of there he said Reverend brandom I said yes sir he said you see the mountains out yonder I said yes sir how far you think they are away I said I don't know he said they're 80 mil said I own Plum to that and Plum beyond that it's my grazing ground I said my that's wonderful he said I he said see down in there that see that City he said I own the bank in that City I own all that ground down around all there and I own this way oh he all he owned stopped in his little station wagon I looked at him very nice man I laid my hand on his shoulder I said brother I want to ask you a question he said all right I said look right up this way how much do you own up that way see he said brother brandom I'm afraid I don't own anything I said there's where my treasures are laying now I don't have nothing down here whether I own tent or a cottage why should I care they're building a palace for me over there of rubies and diamonds and silver and gold his coffers are full he has riches I'm told yes sir that's where the riches lays up there and where your Treasures is your heart is also am this is from a court trial and I'll I'll close on this and the other day I stood and looked at his building and he's speaking of talk Tommy Osborne and oh my a million and5 dollars or something in it in it and I looked over there oral was standing there I was waiting I'd been up oral was so nice and all of them showing me around real nice brothers and I stood there and I thought think I was on the field before they started they each one tell you that they caught the inspiration from that and I thought I'd hate for them to come to my office huh I got one little typewriter sitting in the end of a trailer uhhuh see I'd hate for them to see it and I thought Lord look at here look at this big building worth $3 million they say and I thought I looked down the road and I went it said the future home of soand so future home and I thought but I don't say this in disregarding these brothers but just what was said to me I thought where is my future home something said look up so that's good enough for me as long as I'll look for mine up there so I don't say now I want us to catch this part of it so I don't say that they won't be there too you see but that was just to encourage me you see I like that I like like that because again we're not saying oh you know y'all everybody should have a trailer with one typewriter in the end of it that's and that's we're not going there that we're not going there and brother M's not trying to go there either he's not saying it's about the the the price of the building but there was something that was to encourage him and this is what I'm wanting to say with all of this that I have when I discovered this about righteousness and when I saw this with the Coffee Bean it was to encourage me it was to encourage me because there's just these times where you just you just wonder what am I doing Lord what am I doing what where's my place where what's what's my position and and have I done enough and as a Believer Lord you know you know my heart I got to do my part for my family and I want to do my part for my friends and I want to do my part for my for for this one and that one but God ultimately Lord there's nothing I can do but it's what I want to be he says I wouldn't have sense enough to know how to handle money like that God knows that too and then what if I had great big obligations like that do you think I could come here to this place place you think I could hold a three days meeting here like brother Roberts when brother Roberts has to have around 10,000 every day why I'd go wild the first day to meet that see why I can hold a me I can hold a meeting where there's five people or two people or one person or go wherever he sends me I have no need of anything but more of him so that's what I want you to pray that I'll have more of him to know him the Lord bless you church that's my prayer I I pray that if each one of us had our time to come up here we would say church I want more of him would you pray if you've got any prayer for your brother would you pray that I'll have more of him I'd invite the musicians to come when we read our Bibles and in our own private time when we find ourselves in a moment just hungering for God just praying God would you speak to me I got to tell you church that when I'm sitting down with my young employees and we we we're just mining we're just mining in the Bible just hoping to hit some we you know we don't know what we're about to find but let's mine together and we hit a gold vein like we did with this idea of righteousness not this idea but this reality of righteousness I I pray you get those [Music] I pray you have those times sister Grace most of the time is the one in the mornings that's sitting down with the children and having the devotions and many times I'm in the office and I'm already I've been up already for hours and I've already had my devotions and I'm in the office and but I'm hearing them having their devotions and the work of a mother is it's it's never ending it's not just a work she's not just mothering the children she's used most of the time mothering their husband you know and all of his needs it's it's it's it's Relentless but I pray that you can take those [Music] times where you're hungry and you you're you're mining you're wanting to you're wanting to hit a vein you're wanting to you want to hit something you don't know what it's going to be is it oil or is it gold or silver or nickel I pray though that when you have that when you hit it when you hit it that it'll spark your life and I'll stir up that coffee bean and you'll begin to you'll begin to affect the atmosphere in your home your marriage you you'll be able to impact your children in their schooling in their [Music] raising and I once in a while I I get the privilege to come into those devotions with the my wife and children working from home and I get to sit down and say oh now let's talk about that was a good scripture let's talk about this and being the preacher that I am they're probably just rolling in their eyes and going oh here we go with that again but to hear my children talking about the things of God oh there's just what greater success does a dad want there's no there's just nothing that compares to [Music] that when when just see the the the love of God pouring out of not only your family but then you go you go meet with Believers and you sit and you start talking about the things of God just good things and just that coffee begins percolating in the room and you just think that is so clean it feels so good I pray church that that we we get those moments and that each time we get to to see each other from service to service from event to event from day to day whatever meeting to meeting lunch to lunch coffee to Coffee whatever it is we I think we're all like we're in a closing time we're in a closing time we keep saying it to each other but I pray that that that that's not what's driving us together is that we're in the closing time but it's getting better and better it's just getting clearer and clearer that's my prayer for for each of us I I tell you I as I've gotten to know each and every one a little bit more and a little bit more find out what you do and and and and the things you're good at it excites me it excites me to know each one and and then to hear the testimony of how we've come together here it's tremendous but it's all for the love of God I mean in the end it's just the love of [Music] God I'd just like to pray with you if we'd Stand Together
