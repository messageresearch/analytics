[0:00] and just sensing
[0:02] um just for myself personally and
[0:05] recognizing being able to have our own
[0:07] place kind of a culmination of
[0:09] well over a year of prayers and
[0:11] searching and
[0:13] and efforts many efforts being made to
[0:14] be here i kind of i sense that it would
[0:17] be a good idea maybe not just to jump
[0:19] into part four of a series or continue
[0:21] on something that we'd be ministered on
[0:23] already but to address maybe a subject
[0:27] uh that speaks to the specialness of
[0:29] tonight the opportunity that we have
[0:30] tonight
[0:31] and so my title is a better home
[0:35] and
[0:35] this is applicable on a number of
[0:37] different levels
[0:38] and you'll kind of see where i'm going
[0:40] and how that's applicable as we go
[0:42] forward but i want you to think about
[0:43] this a better home
[0:46] and here at the outset i'd like to just
[0:48] express it this way that this is home as
[0:50] a church for now
[0:52] this is an opportunity that god has
[0:54] given us to gather together
[0:56] it's um some facilities that we can call
[0:58] our own that we can take pride in
[1:00] um a wonderful opportunity for those who
[1:03] every service have been showing up two
[1:04] hours early and maybe staying at least
[1:06] an hour late uh making sure everything
[1:08] is taken care of um there's a definite
[1:11] change and shift for many different
[1:12] people
[1:13] but i wanted just to speak to that as
[1:15] we're gathering here for the first time
[1:17] i just wanted to speak to uh the fact
[1:20] that this is uh this especially this
[1:22] part right here there's other parts to
[1:24] this facility there's other places where
[1:25] we'll have whether it be office space or
[1:28] sunday school rooms or even a fellowship
[1:30] hall there's a lot of different places
[1:31] to this facility but to where we're
[1:34] gathered right now
[1:35] i wanted to give some context uh to how
[1:38] we view this and how special it is to us
[1:41] uh we often have this prayer in our
[1:43] hearts from the very first time that we
[1:45] ever held a service here at arizona
[1:46] believers church it was held on july 26
[1:49] um 2020 at the hilton garden inn uh we
[1:52] didn't have any control over who had
[1:54] been in there the night before even who
[1:56] had been in there that morning but we
[1:57] knew one thing our god was greater than
[1:59] whatever it was
[2:00] and so we always relied upon his
[2:02] presence to sanctify the atmosphere to
[2:04] drive out any spirits and and we often
[2:07] wrestle even with just atmospheres that
[2:09] could be just outside those walls and
[2:11] those doors but now we have a place that
[2:13] we can call our own and that we can
[2:15] begin to reverence and respect and i
[2:17] believe it can just even heightened
[2:19] heighten the atmosphere the presence
[2:20] that we feel and in the message be not
[2:23] afraid it is i
[2:25] brother branham makes this statement
[2:27] uh and i think i provided these four
[2:29] there might be some other scriptures
[2:30] there in the way at the beginning i'm
[2:31] not sure but it's one of the first
[2:33] quotes in there
[2:34] but braham says because i believe uh and
[2:37] he refers to the masons in a masonic
[2:39] lodge and then he says i believe that
[2:41] the masons are all right but the mason
[2:42] lodge will never take the place of the
[2:45] church or the blood of jesus christ he
[2:48] says all my people are masons and
[2:49] they're all right as a lodge but it
[2:51] won't take the place of the church
[2:53] he makes this troubling statement he
[2:55] says and the trouble of trouble of it is
[2:58] you've got the church till it's no more
[3:00] the masonic lodge or any other lodge
[3:03] they've turned church and the and the
[3:04] having of church and even the facilities
[3:06] of a church turn it into nothing more
[3:08] than a lodge he says the church is a
[3:11] house of god where christ lives and
[3:14] manifests himself amongst the people
[3:16] and you realize he's referring to the
[3:18] actual
[3:19] building he's actually referring to the
[3:20] gathering place he's referring to not
[3:22] just the the the mythical or the the
[3:26] mystical body of christ and the body of
[3:28] christ that exists that transcends
[3:30] borders and transcends flesh and is all
[3:31] around the world specifically referring
[3:34] to that church as a house
[3:37] is a house of god where christ lives and
[3:40] manifests himself amongst the people i
[3:42] think that's the attitude that we ought
[3:43] to have to this sanctuary that this is a
[3:45] place this is the house of god
[3:47] uh there's gonna be some remodeling done
[3:49] there's gonna be some walls removed
[3:50] there might be some changes in seats and
[3:52] changes of of locations of chairs and
[3:54] platforms and many different things but
[3:56] we always want to remember when it comes
[3:58] to gathering here in our time in here
[4:00] that this is a gathering place where
[4:02] christ manifests himself amongst the
[4:04] people and brotherhood says even christ
[4:06] lives
[4:08] and then in the message church order
[4:09] i've always identified this i think
[4:11] we've had the opportunity to do it here
[4:13] a number of times how that this is the
[4:14] day after christmas this is
[4:16] december 26 1963 this was an important
[4:20] enough uh information to address to
[4:23] where he was willing to have a meeting
[4:25] with the board and with the trustees
[4:27] on the day after christmas for the
[4:30] canadians this would be boxing day and
[4:32] yet they still wanted to get together
[4:34] and discuss
[4:35] um important matters and brother brown
[4:37] does give a lot of emphasis to the
[4:39] things he's speaking on
[4:40] but he says this now deacons of the
[4:42] church and as i said are the police of
[4:44] the church
[4:45] but the church is not a general meeting
[4:47] house for fellowship and friendship and
[4:49] frolic
[4:50] the church is a sanctuary of god
[4:53] now you think oh okay so then we just
[4:55] come to the sanctuary we leave we can't
[4:57] have friendship but really have to
[4:58] identify he's talking about just turning
[5:01] it into a lodge where it's just a
[5:02] general meeting place where it's more
[5:04] about the social aspects more about
[5:06] that's where my family goes to church
[5:07] that's where they have a great youth
[5:09] group they have a lot of the different
[5:10] amenities it's a place where we can
[5:12] kind of satisfy the social longings that
[5:14] we have as humans he's saying it's not
[5:16] for friendship and frolic the church is
[5:19] a sanctuary of god
[5:21] so it connects with this idea the church
[5:22] is a house of god or christ lives and
[5:24] manifests himself amongst the people he
[5:26] says the church is a sanctuary of god
[5:28] now if we want to meet one another let
[5:30] me come to your house or you come to my
[5:32] house you go to one another's house and
[5:34] meet one another
[5:36] i'd say we might be able to do a better
[5:37] job of that as a church that we don't
[5:39] see each other maybe very often outside
[5:41] of church but if we want to meet one
[5:42] another we can make that effort to see
[5:45] one another at one another's house and
[5:46] invite people over and go out to see
[5:48] someone but he's not so much saying that
[5:50] we don't have that element at church but
[5:52] he said that's the only reason why
[5:54] you're coming go do it somewhere else
[5:56] and he says it this way but just to
[5:57] frolic around the church and talking and
[6:00] things like that it's not right brethren
[6:02] we come here we get the whole thing off
[6:04] of our mind
[6:06] i've read that different ways
[6:08] and and i think it can strike us as we
[6:10] read it that if we come here just for
[6:12] friendship and frolic and those
[6:13] different things then we get the right
[6:15] thing the sanctuary of god the dwelling
[6:17] place of his presence we get that the
[6:19] whole proper thing off of our mind but
[6:21] then i read it a couple of times and it
[6:23] struck me that when we come to church
[6:24] it's to get all those things off our
[6:26] mind
[6:27] the frolic the demands of our time
[6:29] socially and all the different demands
[6:31] that we have at work and
[6:33] and even the pulling and friendships and
[6:34] family we come here because it's the
[6:36] opportunity to put your phones in
[6:38] airplane mode to not have to worry about
[6:40] um liking someone's post or replying to
[6:43] something in the family chat and
[6:44] whatsapp it's a time that we get aside
[6:46] and he says then we get our minds off of
[6:49] all of that
[6:50] get the whole thing of all the all the
[6:52] things of the world off our mind and
[6:53] then i included this statement he says
[6:55] it just about a paragraph and a half
[6:57] later he says this in the sanctuary here
[7:00] is where the lord dwells he's not there
[7:02] at the tabernacle he's referring to this
[7:04] the very place uh where they would sit
[7:06] and listen to the word of god go forth
[7:08] he's making these outstanding statements
[7:10] the church is a sanctuary of god it's a
[7:11] house of god where christ lives and
[7:13] manifests himself amongst the people
[7:15] this in the sanctuary here is where the
[7:17] lord dwells
[7:19] and you find it it's a very unique uh
[7:21] dynamic in message churches and i'm sure
[7:23] many of you anybody ever been into
[7:25] another church beside a message church
[7:27] raise your hands you've all been in
[7:28] different churches and if you've been in
[7:30] some of the even more
[7:31] modern bible churches and different
[7:33] places and i found this uh one of the
[7:35] first times i was ever in a pentecostal
[7:36] church i was amazed at just how
[7:39] the sanctuary is just kind of a general
[7:41] meeting place where you talk about
[7:42] whatever you want and you and you show
[7:44] pictures and you share stories and you
[7:46] pat one another on the back and it's
[7:48] real casual it's just like fellowship
[7:50] and um in a fellowship hall until the
[7:52] the music starts and the song leader
[7:54] grabs the mic and then everybody just
[7:56] all of a sudden the switch is thrown and
[7:57] they begin to get into worship mode but
[8:00] one thing that's unique about our
[8:01] churches
[8:02] is that where you come in you sit you
[8:04] pray and you're quiet
[8:06] and there's a reverence for the
[8:07] sanctuary the reason why it's not just a
[8:08] place where ministers share the things
[8:10] they've been studying on over the last
[8:12] few days it's a place where the lord
[8:13] dwells
[8:14] it's a place we want to we want the lord
[8:16] to be welcome here
[8:17] and i'm certainly glad that you're here
[8:19] tonight and i believe you have you i
[8:21] trust you feel welcome here but we've
[8:23] come to welcome him
[8:25] and to let this be a place where he can
[8:26] dwell
[8:27] in the message first brother branham is
[8:29] talking about an age of hybriding he
[8:32] says they've even got churches today
[8:34] till they're hybrids now churches kind
[8:35] of have this hybrid purpose is it really
[8:37] the word is it really to build up faith
[8:39] in christ or does it become more about
[8:41] uh pretense and and popularity and
[8:44] social things he says they get in here
[8:46] they just go to church it's a lodge
[8:49] instead of a church
[8:51] a church is a place where people come
[8:53] together
[8:54] and worship god in spirit and in truth
[8:57] that's what church is for it's a place
[8:58] where people come together and worship
[9:01] god in spirit and in truth and today
[9:03] it's a lodge we go there and have a
[9:05] little time to shake hands and
[9:06] fellowship in some black coffee in the
[9:09] back of the building then go home till
[9:11] next week we've done our religious duty
[9:14] now they had that even then or was that
[9:16] just prophecy
[9:18] i mean because now i remember i remember
[9:21] a church down the street from my house
[9:23] in texas they had a they had a church
[9:25] and they had a little coffee bar called
[9:27] hebrews
[9:29] and uh remember another church that had
[9:31] a a little coffee house in it called
[9:33] higher grounds
[9:34] and it's become trendy right to have the
[9:37] coffee bar and what that's people come
[9:39] and they got a place they got a place
[9:40] now where they can drop the kids off
[9:42] and they give you a number and if your
[9:43] number pops up on the screen while
[9:45] you're in the church you know there's a
[9:46] problem with your kid back in the
[9:47] daycare
[9:48] and and they all serve coffee and maybe
[9:50] we would all take a little exception to
[9:52] uh black coffee here
[9:54] uh and maybe we'd want a latte or
[9:56] something with oat milk in it but
[9:57] brother graham's identifying if it was a
[9:59] trend then if it was in seed form then
[10:01] it's full-blown grown tree with its
[10:03] fruits
[10:04] that these things of coffee bars and
[10:07] amenities and social programs and
[10:08] different things to get the people
[10:10] together and people come shake hands
[10:12] fellowship have some lattes and go home
[10:15] and come back the next service and
[10:17] repeat and people feel that they've done
[10:19] their religious duty and i would say if
[10:21] we're not careful we could do the same
[10:22] thing and feel that we've done our duty
[10:24] according to the message we've come we
[10:25] shook hands we fellowship with one
[10:27] another and we go home and we leave off
[10:29] where church is a place where people
[10:31] come together
[10:32] worship god in spirit and truth
[10:34] the place where christ lives and
[10:36] manifests himself among the people
[10:38] you all are here on a wednesday night so
[10:40] i know that you value this but this
[10:41] gathering here
[10:43] streaming can't touch
[10:44] it just dreaming can't touch it because
[10:47] this is there's something very special
[10:49] about this dynamic something very
[10:50] special about the bride of jesus christ
[10:52] getting together to hear the word of god
[10:54] to encourage one another breathing
[10:55] bringing our licks of fire together i
[10:57] can testify for myself and my family i
[10:59] love the fact that um technology has
[11:02] made streaming available and i i'm
[11:04] always blessed when we have that
[11:06] opportunity to hear the service when we
[11:08] can't be in service but there's always a
[11:10] part of my heart that says this is this
[11:12] is just a substitute this is just to get
[11:14] me through this is just to get me along
[11:16] and and i know that there's many here
[11:18] that this church was started around that
[11:20] were faithful to stream and
[11:21] and and were faithful to their churches
[11:24] only by way of streaming but their
[11:25] prayer was always god bring us a place
[11:27] that we can call our own
[11:29] and have this gathering together
[11:32] so brother branham is telling us what it
[11:34] ought to be like but then he says it's
[11:36] come to a lodge
[11:39] it's uh
[11:40] you know it's become frolic and just
[11:42] friendship it's been social shake hands
[11:44] fellowship have some coffee come back
[11:46] the next week
[11:47] and then he makes this observation i
[11:49] felt it just fit so perfectly in this
[11:51] and i i trust that everybody's still
[11:53] excited
[11:54] as i read these things i just maybe this
[11:56] is just what i needed in my heart just
[11:58] to feel like i'm addressing
[12:00] um this opportunity that we have and the
[12:02] newness of it and and what we have to
[12:04] look forward to going
[12:06] as we move on
[12:07] but in the message stand still brother
[12:09] bram says it's a nervous age what is it
[12:12] i give this solemn warning to the church
[12:14] stand still what a message from the
[12:16] prophet it's a it's a nervous age stand
[12:19] still in this nervousness there's this
[12:21] fidgeting there's this restlessness he
[12:23] says stand still god always commands us
[12:25] stands still before he does anything and
[12:27] then he then he says this the church is
[12:29] in a neurotic stage
[12:31] the church is in a neurotic stage what a
[12:34] remarkable assessment of the church age
[12:37] it's a neurotic stage and it's something
[12:39] that he's identifying in her
[12:41] expectations and her anticipations and
[12:42] in her spirit he says every church is a
[12:44] proselyting and pulling and fussing and
[12:47] stewing he says it's a neurotic age i
[12:50] want you to think about that as he says
[12:52] the church is in a neurotic stage and
[12:55] then he says because of this neurotic
[12:57] stage of the church age if i could say
[12:58] it that way he says there's the spirit
[13:00] on churches where they're they're
[13:02] worried about the numbers they're
[13:03] worried about the people they're work
[13:05] they're pulling they're fussing they're
[13:06] stewing
[13:08] and there's churches that exist just to
[13:10] oppose other churches and there's
[13:11] churches that fight back and forth and
[13:13] there's pushing in this pool and and he
[13:15] says it's a neurotic age that's a sign
[13:18] of this neurosis is the the fuss and the
[13:20] stew and the fighting the pulling and
[13:22] the proselytizing he says but stand
[13:24] still
[13:27] he says now that's the message and then
[13:28] he's bringing it back to um when they
[13:31] crossed over and they said caleb stealed
[13:33] the people or that opportunity they had
[13:35] at cades barnea and i was really
[13:37] studying that and pondering that and i
[13:39] maybe the lord will just open it up to
[13:41] speak on it to you all
[13:43] um personally
[13:44] is that they're finally there rose up a
[13:47] generation that was finally going to
[13:48] cross over
[13:50] and when that and there was a time when
[13:52] there was this division that took place
[13:53] where there was a generation that wasn't
[13:55] going to cross over but there was going
[13:56] to be a generation that would and god
[13:59] had to start focusing everything on that
[14:00] next generation
[14:02] and he says notice caleb the people had
[14:04] just come back the spies from over in
[14:06] the promised land there was that cadis
[14:07] barnea they'd been brought through many
[14:09] trials and seen the hand of god in a
[14:11] very beautiful picture of the full
[14:13] gospel church
[14:14] and many of them had become discouraged
[14:17] discouraged and upset because so many
[14:18] different isms and things has happened
[14:21] in the church
[14:22] can we say amen to that
[14:25] i read to you these three statements
[14:26] about what church is supposed to be
[14:28] and i imagine if we had time to talk to
[14:30] one another there's many of us that
[14:32] testify you know what church no longer
[14:33] became it was no longer that for us
[14:36] it had lost its specialness it wasn't
[14:38] this house of god where christ lived it
[14:39] was more about the friendship and it was
[14:41] more about the frolic and the social
[14:43] things that shake hands fellowship have
[14:45] some coffee in the back of the building
[14:46] and we see all these things as they
[14:48] might be and now he said it's a neurotic
[14:50] age and people become discouraged and
[14:52] upset with the isms and things that have
[14:54] happened in the church but he says but
[14:56] that don't take away the real thing
[14:59] no matter what your experience has been
[15:02] in church before no matter what image
[15:03] has been put before you
[15:05] and no matter no matter if you don't see
[15:07] your proper image somewhere let me tell
[15:09] you there is a place where god's word is
[15:12] living there's a place where the word of
[15:14] god is manifest and
[15:16] and there's people that believe the word
[15:18] of god and very um
[15:20] convinced of its truths and i and i may
[15:22] have mentioned this sunday you know
[15:24] let's ask people where is it being
[15:25] manifested where is it in flesh where
[15:27] does god manifest him in the word of god
[15:29] and i would say come and see
[15:32] come and see where god's word is alive
[15:34] so these things that we've seen don't
[15:35] take away from the real thing he said
[15:37] god calling his church to halt stand
[15:40] still
[15:41] don't be jumping and running not knowing
[15:43] what you're doing come back to the word
[15:45] come back to christ
[15:47] i believe that we have a wonderful
[15:49] opportunity as a church as we're young
[15:50] as we're growing as we enter into a new
[15:52] stage where we have our own facilities
[15:54] and there'll be some
[15:56] growing pains and maybe even some birth
[15:57] pains as we come into a new facility and
[15:59] growing pains as we uh fill it up and as
[16:02] we learn to use it but let's always
[16:04] remember what it's for
[16:06] there may be some other ways that we can
[16:08] use the things around us but let's
[16:09] always remember it's for moments like
[16:11] this
[16:12] where the word is preached a place where
[16:14] god himself can come down amongst us and
[16:16] make himself known
[16:19] and so if you want to look with that as
[16:21] even um
[16:22] the part of the foundation
[16:25] and i just in my heart i don't want to
[16:26] take very long tonight because we do i
[16:28] do want to uh when we wrap it up and
[16:30] we're done just give you an opportunity
[16:32] uh just to look around
[16:35] to take it all in to fellowship with one
[16:37] another
[16:38] and and enjoy enjoy this time since i
[16:40] know there's maybe some excitement and
[16:42] there's some newness to it uh i just
[16:44] wanted to
[16:45] respect that and honor that tonight
[16:47] maybe not belabor any point or or uh try
[16:50] to preach something when everybody's
[16:52] going i wonder what it looks like behind
[16:53] that wall and i wonder what i wonder
[16:55] what's over there and i wonder what's
[16:57] over here and and you just want to take
[16:59] it all in and so i wasn't going to try
[17:00] to fight against that and have 80 to 90
[17:02] people staring at me like i i really
[17:04] want to i want to see the place please
[17:06] brother and just let me see the place
[17:07] and so i'll let you see the place
[17:09] and we'll have that opportunity to do
[17:11] that when the service
[17:12] is dismissed but
[17:15] with that with that as a kind of a
[17:16] foundation
[17:18] what struck me is this is home for now
[17:21] but you know there's always a better
[17:23] home
[17:25] in hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 to 16.
[17:27] let's just walk
[17:29] through these verses tonight together
[17:31] and i have provided them if there's any
[17:33] mistakes in the slides i did it just
[17:35] from here at the last minute didn't even
[17:37] know if we'd have an opportunity to see
[17:38] slides i didn't even didn't know what
[17:40] was going to happen i finally today just
[17:42] in some of the time and logistics of
[17:44] things i just said i'm just gonna get
[17:45] ready for church and go there and show
[17:46] up and hopefully everything works out
[17:48] and it did it's all worked out
[17:50] i kind of announced and let everybody
[17:52] know so that i can always say hey look i
[17:54] have detrimentally relied
[17:56] upon our verbal agreement and i've let
[17:59] everybody know and so i could have some
[18:01] cause of action tomorrow morning maybe
[18:03] get an injunction going if we don't get
[18:05] in but i say that jokingly if the owners
[18:07] happen to be streaming
[18:11] but hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 to 16 by
[18:14] faith abraham we went through this quite
[18:16] a bit in supreme faith of abraham by
[18:19] faith abraham when he was called to go
[18:20] out so god calls him out into a place so
[18:24] he's called to go out somewhere which he
[18:26] should after receive from inheritance
[18:28] this phrase to me just becomes more and
[18:30] more profound as i read through
[18:31] different places in the scripture to
[18:33] recognize that abraham isaac and jacob
[18:36] never possessed the promise that was
[18:38] given to them they never they never had
[18:40] it as it was promised he's called to go
[18:42] out into a place that he should after
[18:43] receive for an inheritance obeyed and
[18:45] he's obeying and he went out not knowing
[18:48] whether he went could we do that
[18:50] could we have the faith of abraham god
[18:52] says go and you just go and say but
[18:54] where am i going i said i'll show you
[18:55] later
[18:56] he said and here's the phrase i want to
[18:58] start focusing on by faith he sojourned
[19:01] in a land of promise as in a strange
[19:04] country
[19:05] so the soul journey that means to dwell
[19:07] in a place as a stranger
[19:09] and and so he you don't souljarn in your
[19:12] own native country don't sojourn in a
[19:14] place that's your own you're not uh
[19:15] sojourning in your house that is your
[19:17] house it's your place of abode but when
[19:19] it says he sojourned in the land the
[19:21] promise the place that he should after
[19:23] receive for inheritance but it wasn't
[19:24] his
[19:26] he said potentially one day by faith and
[19:28] by vision he could believe that it was
[19:29] his but he lived in it as a stranger and
[19:31] he says this way as in a strange country
[19:34] the phrase means in a foreign country or
[19:36] in another man's country
[19:39] here it is it's saying this is yours you
[19:41] can have it it's yours but you can't
[19:43] take possession now and as he walked
[19:45] through the land he's looking around
[19:46] saying these people own these houses
[19:48] they own these lands and they own these
[19:50] cattle and they own these hills and it's
[19:52] like they own it as theirs it's their
[19:53] possession and i am a foreigner i'm an
[19:56] immigrant in their country and they all
[19:58] are living here with their possession
[20:00] and he's a souljourning as a stranger
[20:04] in a strange country
[20:06] and because it was uh
[20:08] he was traveling as a stranger in a
[20:10] strange country a country that was not
[20:12] his own it says he dwelled
[20:14] it says dwelling in tabernacles with
[20:16] isaac and jacob the heirs with them of
[20:18] the same promise
[20:20] a tabernacle may not be the tabernacle
[20:22] we're most familiar with today we put
[20:24] the name tabernacle
[20:26] on buildings
[20:27] but this would be a this would be a
[20:29] tabernacle here would be a tent
[20:31] consisting of poles and maybe some
[20:33] some plants of some sort or animal skins
[20:36] would make this all things together to
[20:38] create
[20:39] a dwell in place but it's a tabernacle
[20:42] with these poles and animal skins so it
[20:44] can be easy to move
[20:45] it says it's dwelling in tabernacles
[20:47] dwelling in tents it's wanting to
[20:48] signify that they were journeying in a
[20:50] strange country as strangers and they
[20:53] never they never built a permanent house
[20:55] they never fixed themselves in an area
[20:57] where they could say this is our own as
[20:58] a matter of fact a lot of the history's
[21:00] looked at abraham and his children as
[21:02] nomadic people that they just were
[21:03] always on the go and they always were
[21:06] moving and that's how they came all the
[21:07] way out of babylon down into the
[21:09] promised land that they they were never
[21:11] fixed in one spot for very long
[21:14] i think we as a church kind of felt that
[21:15] way as like abraham that we just never
[21:18] knew when we have to move and
[21:20] pick up the equipment put it in the
[21:22] truck and move on to another place and
[21:24] abraham had this uh this lifestyle that
[21:27] if he ever had to go he could do so
[21:30] quickly
[21:31] and that's what it's referring to
[21:32] dwelling in tabernacles he's on the move
[21:34] it's a it's he's always in transition
[21:37] but it says this about what's in his
[21:38] heart
[21:39] for he looked for a city
[21:42] verse 10 for he looked for a city which
[21:43] hath foundations
[21:45] whose builder and maker is god
[21:47] it's intended by the writer that the
[21:49] soul journey in a and in the land of
[21:52] promise as in a strange country soul
[21:54] journey as in a strange country dwelling
[21:57] in tabernacles it's in the writer
[21:59] intends to kind of have this but up
[22:01] against this statement for he looked for
[22:03] a city which have foundations whose
[22:05] builder and maker is god
[22:07] as he walked through the promised land
[22:08] and he looked at all the hills and the
[22:10] things that even he was given an
[22:12] inheritance in that is still in his
[22:14] heart living in tents he was looking for
[22:16] a city that had foundations and this is
[22:19] a stark contrast to the idea of having a
[22:22] tent
[22:23] because the foundation is something that
[22:24] is laid down
[22:26] he didn't want to just always be taking
[22:28] the poles and take pull them out rolling
[22:30] up the animal skin and packing them on
[22:31] the pack animals and moving on to the
[22:33] next place and finding the the proper uh
[22:36] lay lay of the land where he could take
[22:38] care of his cat and he can put out his
[22:39] tents and he can live and
[22:41] and could we fix it here will this work
[22:43] can we homestead a little while here he
[22:45] wanted to come to a place where he could
[22:47] put down his roots something that half
[22:50] foundations as it said something
[22:52] steadfast and unmovable
[22:54] it's the exact opposite of well i'm just
[22:56] kind of a stranger here i'm just kind of
[22:58] passing through we're not going to live
[22:59] here for very long when he's looking for
[23:01] a city to have foundations and his heart
[23:03] he said believe in one day i'm going to
[23:04] settle down forever
[23:06] one day i'm not always going to be
[23:07] moving one day i'm going to find that
[23:09] city which is eternal whose builder and
[23:12] maker is god
[23:13] so abraham knew and if you could kind of
[23:15] catch this thought tonight abraham knew
[23:17] that the tents weren't the ultimate
[23:20] and in another way and i'm maybe getting
[23:21] ahead of myself a little bit another way
[23:23] abraham knew that this this journey in
[23:26] this life is not the ultimate that
[23:28] whatever it consisted of and whatever he
[23:30] went through there was something that he
[23:32] would after receive for inheritance
[23:34] there was things he had to go through
[23:35] there was things that had to take place
[23:37] but he was looking for a city that had
[23:39] foundation so he knew that this
[23:41] transitory life and this unstable life
[23:43] and this movable life and things that
[23:45] could change in just a moment he knew
[23:47] that they were not the ultimate
[23:50] he had a he had a transcendent faith
[23:52] that he could just look at everything
[23:53] and say this faith is beyond this flesh
[23:56] it's beyond it there's i know there's
[23:58] more i know there's a better better
[24:00] thing coming i know there's better
[24:01] things to uh to experience and to enjoy
[24:03] there's more to there's more to life
[24:06] than even this life there's more to this
[24:08] existence than the things that i see
[24:10] and so these phrases soul journeying as
[24:12] in a strange country dueling in
[24:14] tabernacles it's to is to run counter to
[24:17] this idea of a city that has foundations
[24:20] now we'll read through verses 11 and 12
[24:23] through faith also sarah herself
[24:25] received strength to conceive seed
[24:27] and was delivered of a child
[24:29] when she was past age
[24:31] because she judged him faithful who had
[24:33] promised
[24:34] therefore spraying their even of one and
[24:36] him as good as dead so many as the stars
[24:38] of the sky and the multitude and as the
[24:39] sand which is by the seashore
[24:41] innumerable
[24:43] and then notice this and i believe it's
[24:45] really
[24:46] speaking specific it could be applied to
[24:48] any of the saints but specifically
[24:50] abraham to whom the promise was given
[24:52] and sarah
[24:53] and the child that came from them and
[24:55] you have isaac and jacob these are the
[24:57] patriarchs the god of abraham isaac and
[24:59] jacob and their wives makes this
[25:01] remarkable statement these all died in
[25:03] faith
[25:05] well i think that just kind of takes
[25:06] that that stain of death and kind of
[25:09] rubs it out a little bit
[25:10] because there's the devil always wants
[25:12] to whisper to a believer that somehow if
[25:14] they die of sickness if they die of
[25:16] cancer if they die in tragedy die in a
[25:18] difficult situation that somehow you
[25:20] can't die in faith but the bible says
[25:22] these all died in faith
[25:24] death doesn't take the faith away from a
[25:26] believer as a matter of fact what faith
[25:28] does is it just takes death and it kind
[25:29] of uses it to bring it into the ultimate
[25:32] expression of what their faith was all
[25:33] about right into the presence of god so
[25:35] there's no there's no stigma on a
[25:37] believer's faith if they die
[25:40] he said these all died in faith not
[25:43] having received the promises
[25:45] they die believing they they die with
[25:47] this belief that they one day would
[25:49] receive the inheritance and after it
[25:50] says that abraham knew that he would
[25:52] after receive for inheritance after what
[25:55] when would it be but he says they died
[25:57] having not received the promises but
[25:59] notice but having seen them afar off
[26:02] and i love this and were persuaded of
[26:04] them
[26:06] and embraced them
[26:08] now this is really coming to what stood
[26:10] out to me so much when i was studying
[26:12] this as it says that they saw them afar
[26:14] off and this is by faith and then then
[26:16] they're persuaded of them
[26:18] they don't have them but they see them
[26:21] and then they're persuaded they're
[26:22] convinced and then they can they can
[26:24] somehow embrace them
[26:27] it's not yet here present with me but
[26:29] somehow i can embrace them and then
[26:30] through this process of seeing
[26:32] persuading and embracing it has this uh
[26:36] effect upon their confession and
[26:38] confessed that there were strangers and
[26:40] pilgrims on the earth
[26:42] now this is a remarkable statement and
[26:44] paul is going to come back and i'm going
[26:45] to come to it here in a moment and he's
[26:47] going to tell us why this is so
[26:48] remarkable he said this this the fact
[26:50] that they're willing in the absence of
[26:52] any title deed in the absence of any
[26:55] evidence in the absence of anything that
[26:56] they could lay claim to they can see it
[27:00] be persuaded of it and embrace it and
[27:01] then say you know what i'm a stranger
[27:03] and a pilgrim on the earth this is a
[27:05] remarkable statement
[27:07] and paul will tell us why but notice
[27:09] strangers it means a foreigner literally
[27:10] the word means an alien
[27:13] it's to be away from your homeland
[27:16] and we would use maybe today we say
[27:18] stranger but maybe today we'd say an
[27:19] immigrant
[27:21] and maybe people are trying to maybe use
[27:23] uh some
[27:25] aggravating language they may call them
[27:26] illegals or something there's ways that
[27:28] people try to agitate it and
[27:30] and aggravate a little bit put a stigma
[27:32] on it but we're literally talking about
[27:33] someone who's a foreigner in a strange
[27:34] country and a country that's not their
[27:36] own they're an immigrant they're a
[27:38] foreigner they're an alien it means to
[27:39] be away from your own homeland this is
[27:41] it so they confess now notice this
[27:43] remarkable they confess they were
[27:44] strangers this is their confession
[27:47] and pilgrims one who comes from a
[27:49] foreign country into a land to reside
[27:52] and so we're strangers we're pilgrims we
[27:54] kind of get the idea maybe the concept
[27:55] of immigrants and pilgrims in the united
[27:57] states and that's how we you know that's
[27:59] how we settled here originally the
[28:00] pilgrims it means somebody who's come
[28:02] from another country
[28:04] into a land that is not their own but
[28:06] we're going to we're going to reside
[28:07] here
[28:09] confessing we're just strangers and
[28:10] pilgrims on the earth and then this is
[28:12] for they that this is what out it's so
[28:15] amazing they that say such say such
[28:18] things declare plainly that they seek a
[28:20] country
[28:22] somebody who says such things as that is
[28:24] declaring plainly well what do you mean
[28:26] those that see them afar off
[28:28] and are persuaded of them embrace them
[28:30] and then are willing to say that while
[28:32] i'm here i'm just a stranger while i'm
[28:34] here i'm just a pilgrim what do you mean
[28:36] your family grew up here and you've
[28:37] owned this land for decades and you have
[28:39] a house and you have this while i'm here
[28:40] i'm a stranger and i'm a pilgrim they
[28:43] that say such things declare plainly
[28:46] that they seek a country
[28:48] the word country means one's own place a
[28:50] fixed abode or a home
[28:52] it's one they seek a home they seek a
[28:55] fixed abode they seek something that is
[28:57] their own
[28:58] the word country it comes from the root
[29:00] something that is remarkable something
[29:02] that's noted or marked out something
[29:04] conspicuous so it gets the idea of
[29:05] borders or walls and things that kind of
[29:08] frame something up they declare that one
[29:10] day i'm gonna have my own place one day
[29:12] i'm gonna have my own home and they say
[29:15] people who say such things as this
[29:17] plainly declare that they're seeking a
[29:19] home
[29:21] the word country refers to
[29:23] and then he says and truly if they had
[29:26] been mindful of that country from whence
[29:28] they came out
[29:30] if their minds had been on the country
[29:32] they left is it there's really
[29:35] the the idea of a man with no country
[29:38] is maybe just a real oddity or an
[29:40] outlier but they clearly came from
[29:42] somewhere and abraham's identified with
[29:44] family and lands and possessions and he
[29:45] comes from this uh this land of china
[29:48] and he's coming out of uh er he's coming
[29:50] out of the land of the chaldees he's
[29:51] coming out of babylon and harry is
[29:53] coming he's traveling in he says now if
[29:55] they had been mindful
[29:57] of the original home that they had
[29:59] they'd been mindful of the home that
[30:01] they came out of they might have had
[30:03] opportunity to have returned
[30:06] notice that they cherish the memory of
[30:08] where they were from
[30:10] then they could have gone back
[30:12] if that's what it was all about is just
[30:14] to go back to a place that you're from
[30:16] and it's and you're not a foreigner
[30:18] you're not an immigrant then they could
[30:19] have just gone back to babylon
[30:21] it's what the bible's saying that if it
[30:23] was just a matter of having your own
[30:24] place if it was just a matter of having
[30:26] your name on it the title on there
[30:27] having a history there this is where we
[30:29] all grew up and it's something you could
[30:30] call your own it says if they'd just
[30:32] been mindful of this earthly life and
[30:34] these earthly things and they could have
[30:36] just returned if they cherished their
[30:38] original home like that that much they
[30:40] could have just gone back
[30:42] but it makes this statement
[30:43] think of this they confess that they
[30:45] were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
[30:46] for they that say such things declare
[30:48] plainly that they seek a country and if
[30:50] they'd been mindful that country from
[30:51] which they came out they might have had
[30:53] opportunity to return but now
[30:55] they desire a better country
[30:58] now they desire a better country that
[30:59] isn't heavenly wherefore god is not
[31:01] ashamed to be called their god for he
[31:03] hath prepared for them a city
[31:06] this is where i got the inspiration a
[31:07] better home
[31:08] they desire
[31:10] a better country
[31:12] they desire it's an ardent longing for
[31:14] the possession of something you do not
[31:16] have right now but you believe that you
[31:19] ultimately will be able to call it your
[31:21] own
[31:22] as it says having seen them afar off
[31:24] persuade them and embrace them there's
[31:25] this reaching out an ardent desire to
[31:28] possess something that you do not have
[31:29] now but yet you believe that one day you
[31:31] will have it
[31:33] when they they desire and even the
[31:34] language that paul is used to this point
[31:36] it's wanting to bring up this image that
[31:37] there's a yearning for there's a
[31:39] stretching forth at the hands for it
[31:42] that though they were strangers on earth
[31:44] and they were pilgrims on the earth they
[31:46] had this long and they had they
[31:47] stretched out their hands for something
[31:48] they did not yet possess but one they
[31:50] knew that they would
[31:54] so they desire
[31:55] a better
[31:57] this word means more useful serviceable
[32:00] more advantageous
[32:03] i can say that this is definitely where
[32:04] we're at now
[32:06] uh is a church is even more useful
[32:09] more serviceable maybe it doesn't have
[32:11] the full service
[32:13] maybe it doesn't have the nice fire
[32:15] feature on the patio maybe there's a lot
[32:17] of things that are different not as many
[32:19] stories here as we had
[32:20] at the other place but it's more useful
[32:23] more advantageous
[32:26] they desire a better something that was
[32:27] better and actually one of the
[32:28] renderings of it translation is
[32:30] something more excellent
[32:32] so the beauties of the word of god is
[32:33] you could have excellent excellent
[32:34] excellent more excellent
[32:36] you can have good good good gooder
[32:39] that you can have you can have something
[32:40] that's good and you can have something
[32:41] that's uh uh more excellent but then
[32:44] you've got something more excellent
[32:46] a more perfect oh that's perfect i know
[32:48] how to make it more perfect
[32:51] and this is just something that you can
[32:52] have as an expectation as a believer
[32:54] says they desire a better
[32:56] country
[32:58] something they call they could call
[32:59] their own
[33:00] a better kingdom
[33:02] a better home
[33:04] that in their journey and in their in
[33:06] their lives no matter what they had
[33:08] acquired and what they had learned and
[33:10] accepted and experienced and even
[33:12] achieved and accumulated and possessions
[33:14] that they could call their own it says
[33:16] they desire a better country
[33:19] something more excellent
[33:22] something that was a better a better
[33:23] kingdom than kingdoms of this earth a
[33:25] better home than the earthly homes they
[33:27] desired something better
[33:29] and let me say this for us and i could
[33:32] express this for all of us that are here
[33:33] tonight as believers we desire a better
[33:36] home
[33:37] and maybe there's some wives here saying
[33:39] amen to that yep i want a better place
[33:41] than i'm living in now that may be true
[33:43] in the natural we may desire a better
[33:45] place to live with more square footage
[33:47] or a better location or more land or
[33:49] better amenities or something upgraded
[33:51] but when we as believers begin to think
[33:53] about our faith and what's deep inside
[33:54] our hearts no matter what we accomplish
[33:56] here with jobs and job promotions and
[33:58] houses and new houses maybe second homes
[34:00] and second cars maybe being able to go
[34:02] on vacations no matter what the balance
[34:04] sheet is telling us no matter what our p
[34:06] l is declaring to us as believers we
[34:08] declare that there must be something
[34:11] better than what we have possessed until
[34:13] now
[34:14] i believe this ought to be the heartbeat
[34:16] of every single christian believer that
[34:18] i always have something it's not a
[34:21] disregard for what i have it's not a
[34:22] disrespect for what i've been given it's
[34:24] not this dissatisfaction and disdain for
[34:26] any blessings of god but something down
[34:29] inside of me as it says they declared
[34:31] plainly as believers we declare there
[34:34] must be something better than what i
[34:36] possess till now and i would say it to
[34:38] us in a spiritual sense wherever you are
[34:41] in your walk with god whatever move of
[34:43] god you've experienced in your life let
[34:45] there be something down inside of you
[34:47] say there must be something better than
[34:49] what i've experienced up until now
[34:54] and then to even view it as a whole of
[34:55] what are these experiences for what are
[34:57] these gatherings all about why are we
[34:59] experiencing these things do we have
[35:01] this thought inside of us that nothing
[35:03] but my future home will satisfy me
[35:07] maybe even in the sense that our
[35:09] these bodies as they long and crave we
[35:12] could have in our spirits say nothing
[35:13] but that new body
[35:15] will satisfy me
[35:18] that's what i mean when i say a better
[35:19] home
[35:21] god's blessed us as a church to have a
[35:23] place we can call our own
[35:25] it's wonderful that we just we're all
[35:27] gathered together as family on a
[35:28] wednesday night and it feels like we fit
[35:30] like a glove
[35:32] like this is fitting we fit this is us
[35:34] this is who we are
[35:36] and god didn't want us to go out and
[35:38] and and get something that uh that
[35:40] looked any different than this because
[35:42] this is what he provided
[35:44] i may i was maybe pondering different
[35:46] things i could share things i could say
[35:48] and maybe there'd be a more appropriate
[35:50] time to do it
[35:51] but if i'm not mistaken brother mike i
[35:53] believe it was just last wednesday we
[35:54] stood right at the doors there the door
[35:57] there at the hilton garden inn and we
[35:58] were just talking about they hadn't been
[35:59] delivered a contract and we didn't know
[36:01] why they were dragging their feet and i
[36:02] just said
[36:03] uh and it really wasn't me speaking
[36:05] based upon the way i conducted myself
[36:07] for the next 48 hours but i said you
[36:08] know what i just know that if a hotel
[36:10] tells us tomorrow that they don't want
[36:12] us anymore then there'll just have to be
[36:13] something available friday
[36:16] and uh
[36:18] and i knew i said that but i didn't act
[36:20] like i did
[36:22] on thursday
[36:23] when the email came and said yeah you've
[36:25] been paying three thousand we're sorry
[36:26] we did get the contract to you it's
[36:28] gonna be 12 000 now if you want it a
[36:30] month
[36:31] and i went maybe full panic mode
[36:34] and i reached out to other people who
[36:35] wouldn't panic
[36:37] and
[36:38] unbeknownst to us
[36:40] at the very moment that i get the email
[36:42] from the hotel saying we want to raise
[36:43] your rent to 12 grand a month
[36:46] there was a tenant that was getting
[36:48] ready to move in here the only thing
[36:49] they lacked was a signature on the lease
[36:51] at the same moment they called the the
[36:53] broker and said we don't want it anymore
[36:57] and within two hours we had reached out
[36:59] brother jeff had reached out to him
[37:01] and on friday we came here for the first
[37:03] time and saw it
[37:04] and so god did exactly what he said he
[37:06] would do
[37:08] and so this is better would you agree
[37:10] i believe this is better
[37:13] but amen i believe that
[37:15] [Applause]
[37:20] but there's something down inside of us
[37:22] that declares there must be something
[37:25] better than what we even possess right
[37:27] now
[37:28] and if you want to think of that in
[37:29] terms of maybe a natural gathering place
[37:31] that's certainly fine i have a vision
[37:33] that we could own our own place one day
[37:36] a place as we grow and god continues to
[37:38] add that it would be
[37:39] fitting for everyone and meet the needs
[37:41] of the church but i do know for us on a
[37:43] spiritual level our eyes are on
[37:44] something else
[37:47] it says this in psalms 137
[37:49] verses 1 just read to verse 6 it says by
[37:52] the rivers of babylon it's just a
[37:54] beautiful um
[37:57] image by the rivers of babylon there we
[38:00] sat down i feel like that's where us
[38:02] sometimes here in laodicea and satan's
[38:05] eden by the rivers of babylon there we
[38:07] sat down we wept when we remembered zion
[38:10] we hanged our harps upon the willows in
[38:12] the midst thereof for there they that
[38:14] had carried us away captive required
[38:17] required of us a song
[38:19] and they that wasted us required of us
[38:21] mirth saying sing us one of the songs of
[38:23] zion he was being carried away captive
[38:25] dragged out of your home dragged out of
[38:27] jerusalem dragged out of israel dragged
[38:29] out of palestine dragged away from your
[38:31] inheritance your promise and there you
[38:33] are by the rivers of babylon and you and
[38:36] your your heart is thinking
[38:38] about zion and you hang your harps on
[38:40] the willows and your captors your
[38:43] kidnappers your abusers say oh sing us a
[38:45] song of home
[38:48] sing us a song in your tongue sing us
[38:49] sing to us of the place that you came
[38:52] from
[38:53] and they say how shall we sing the
[38:54] lord's song in a strange land
[38:58] and then it says and it certainly speaks
[39:00] to the difficulty of it the hardness of
[39:02] it but it says if i forget the o
[39:03] jerusalem let my right hand forget her
[39:05] cunning
[39:07] if i forget this place of promise if i
[39:09] forget this place that god has given us
[39:10] as an inheritance if i forget it then
[39:12] let my hands forget their skills
[39:15] if i do not remember thee let my tongue
[39:17] cleave to the roof of my mouth
[39:19] this is this is wishing a deterioration
[39:22] and judgment and corruption upon their
[39:24] person upon their abilities upon their
[39:26] substance let let me let me wither and
[39:28] die if i forget theo jerusalem if i
[39:31] prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy
[39:35] what an attitude
[39:37] carried away captive strangers in
[39:38] babylon and have this heaviness in their
[39:41] heart that no matter what i may be given
[39:43] here what i may learn what i might excel
[39:45] at what i uh opportunities i might have
[39:47] oh god let me not forget jerusalem if i
[39:50] forget jerusalem let my right hand
[39:51] forget her cunning if i do not remember
[39:53] they let my tongue cleave to the roof of
[39:54] my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem above
[39:58] my chief joy
[40:01] i wonder if that was the song they would
[40:02] sing
[40:04] it was a song of exile and longing
[40:06] for which their what was their rightful
[40:08] possession a song that spoke of home a
[40:11] song that spoke of better things
[40:14] a song that always remembered that
[40:15] though i'm here
[40:17] i have a promise there
[40:20] and that i prefer jerusalem above my
[40:22] chief joy
[40:25] and
[40:26] there's a more modern day phenomena
[40:29] of the jews being scattered all over the
[40:31] world they call it the jewish despora
[40:34] and they've been scattered out of israel
[40:37] and they were driven out of israel over
[40:39] the world
[40:40] but yet these israelites these jews were
[40:42] very faithful
[40:44] to continue to observe their their
[40:46] feasts and their traditions
[40:49] and and as these jews would be gathered
[40:52] out into all these other places all over
[40:54] the world they would still celebrate
[40:55] their cedar and they would celebrate yom
[40:57] kippur
[40:58] and in those particular two feast
[41:01] on the conclusion of both the cedar
[41:03] knight and yom kippur they would always
[41:05] have a phrase
[41:06] next year
[41:08] in jerusalem
[41:10] it just it's such a remarkable phrase it
[41:12] just moves me to think about it
[41:15] that here they are they're strangers
[41:17] they're gathered off in some other place
[41:19] they they their hearts are on home their
[41:21] hearts are on jerusalem and they're
[41:23] they're scattered around the world and
[41:25] they'd get together and they'd have a
[41:26] feast but they would every time they'd
[41:28] say next year
[41:29] next year we're going to do this in
[41:30] jerusalem
[41:32] let's not do it here again
[41:35] next year let's do it in jerusalem and
[41:37] that was always their hope they never
[41:38] got complacent they never got satisfied
[41:40] and looked at everything they had and
[41:41] their wealth and everything they
[41:42] accumulated they knew there was
[41:43] something that was above their chiefess
[41:45] joy something greater than anything else
[41:47] they possessed and it was their longing
[41:49] next cedar may it be in jerusalem and
[41:51] they had this phrase next year in
[41:54] jerusalem
[41:55] why because in their language of the
[41:56] haggadah it was this phrase jerusalem it
[41:59] was the final stage of redemption for
[42:01] them whatever has happened whatever
[42:03] we've experienced whatever god is doing
[42:04] we know that it's not complete until
[42:06] we're in jerusalem and for them to
[42:08] gather together and then say next year
[42:11] jerusalem it was signifying a vision for
[42:13] something better
[42:15] signifying a longing for something
[42:16] better something promised something that
[42:18] was theirs and it didn't belittle the
[42:20] feast they were right to keep the feast
[42:23] they didn't despise doing the feast and
[42:24] they were faithful to do it everything
[42:26] they kept perfectly but they kept it
[42:29] believing one day this may be the last
[42:31] time
[42:33] they had in their hearts next year
[42:36] jerusalem
[42:40] maybe we could have the same desire
[42:43] next year new jerusalem
[42:46] if we were just beginning last year at
[42:48] this time and then we find ourselves in
[42:50] this facility this time next year lord
[42:53] next year new jerusalem
[42:55] lord we don't want to get complacent
[42:57] here we don't ever want to lose this
[42:58] edge that we have as a young church we
[43:00] want to always remember what this is for
[43:02] and what it's all about
[43:05] because it says in hebrews chapter 13
[43:06] verse 14 for here we have no
[43:10] continuing city
[43:12] no permanent city
[43:14] here we have no continuing city remember
[43:17] that
[43:18] doesn't matter if you hold own the
[43:20] the title to your home outright free and
[43:22] clear
[43:23] as believers we have this thought here i
[43:27] have no permanent city
[43:29] but
[43:30] we seek one to come
[43:32] we're soldiers here on earth pilgrims
[43:35] knowing that heaven is our home
[43:39] and this is not our abode here
[43:41] this is not our this is not what we're
[43:43] called to so we look to things that are
[43:45] to be
[43:47] i say to us as a church
[43:50] arizona believers church this is home
[43:54] as a church we seek a better one
[43:56] we do
[43:59] and so what we'll do is we'll make this
[44:00] the best until better comes
[44:03] we'll make it the best
[44:05] we'll get everything out of this that
[44:06] god desires us to have we'll treat it
[44:08] we'll treat it as if it is our own we'll
[44:09] take care of it we'll be respectful of
[44:11] it we'll leave it in a better condition
[44:13] than we found it
[44:15] and we'll have respect to this this
[44:17] place the facilities will certainly have
[44:18] respect to this gathering place right
[44:20] here this sanctuary and will make it
[44:22] best until better comes
[44:25] because as believers we can declare
[44:27] plainly that we seek a home
[44:29] we seek a better home
[44:31] and then i say it to us as believers
[44:33] each one in your families the heads of
[44:34] homes and those that make up this church
[44:36] never get complacent or lose sight of
[44:38] the gold
[44:40] just as they kept the feast and cedar
[44:42] they kept it in yom kippur and they
[44:44] reminded themselves every time at the
[44:46] end just remember next year in jerusalem
[44:49] let's remember our goal
[44:52] our goal is the rapture
[44:54] art
[44:55] that we desire as they say i prefer
[44:58] jerusalem above my chief joy
[45:00] i prefer translation
[45:03] above my chief joy
[45:04] oh brother aaron what's your favorite do
[45:06] you like this do you like that i enjoy
[45:07] this do you like being there i enjoy
[45:08] that i love this i love that but i
[45:10] prefer i prefer rapture
[45:13] i you say how would you love church oh i
[45:15] absolutely love it though i look forward
[45:17] to these times i hope you do too i think
[45:19] about them i long for them i look
[45:20] forward to them i'm so excited about
[45:21] what the future holds but if you ask me
[45:23] well do you want me to go ahead and
[45:25] tarry a little bit so you can enjoy the
[45:27] facility so no no no no what i prefer
[45:29] more and what i want more is a body
[45:31] change as much as i love church as much
[45:33] as i love you and these bodies i think
[45:35] you're going to be a lot better in a new
[45:36] one no offense i'm going to be a lot
[45:38] better in a new one i want to be
[45:40] together in that eternal youth meeting
[45:41] at that meeting in the air that's going
[45:43] to that i prefer that above any of my
[45:45] chief joys
[45:47] and that is what i look forward to
[45:51] and so my final statement to you tonight
[45:53] and we'll just worship for a little bit
[45:56] as brother branham says in the message
[45:58] proven his word
[46:01] he says last sunday i'll just mention
[46:03] this i don't have it up there but he
[46:05] just makes this statement last sunday
[46:06] was a week ago i spoke on the subject
[46:08] the future home of the bride and groom
[46:11] so this is his where his mind is his
[46:14] mind is on this future home of the bride
[46:15] and groom
[46:16] and he says
[46:18] i've been feasting on that ever since
[46:22] knowing that when this life is over i'm
[46:24] going to that city
[46:26] i'm bound for that city
[46:28] and nothing else
[46:30] matters
[46:32] oh my if that really could begin to
[46:34] break on us it it can change attitudes
[46:38] change perspective it could be that
[46:40] paradigm shift we said i'm going to that
[46:43] city and the path that i'm on now and
[46:45] that i'm fighting for i'm striving in
[46:47] that i'm doing my best to surrender to
[46:49] the
[46:50] the mind of god and letting him have
[46:52] preeminence and whatever difficult
[46:54] difficulties that brings it says i'm
[46:56] bound for that city and nothing else
[46:59] matters
[47:01] that's the kind of attitude we ought to
[47:03] have and they that say such things
[47:05] declare plainly that they seek a better
[47:07] home
[47:08] to say nothing else matters what matters
[47:10] rapture or boss what else am i it's
[47:12] about the rapture it's about the body
[47:14] change it's about applying the token
[47:16] it's about getting out of here and
[47:17] nothing else matters
[47:19] oh well you don't own this you don't own
[47:21] that you guys are just written your
[47:22] church well it's not this big it doesn't
[47:24] have that it doesn't it you only have
[47:25] eight foot ceilings ah
[47:27] well one day guess what
[47:29] this the sky is not even be able to hold
[47:31] me i'm gonna be able to travel like a
[47:32] thought
[47:36] and that and nothing else matters he
[47:38] says what if the sun doesn't shine today
[47:41] or tomorrow never comes what difference
[47:43] does it make
[47:44] we got a home
[47:46] a resting place tired or not tired we
[47:49] still
[47:50] have
[47:50] that resting place
[47:54] a better home
[47:56] god bless you let's stand together
[47:57] tonight
