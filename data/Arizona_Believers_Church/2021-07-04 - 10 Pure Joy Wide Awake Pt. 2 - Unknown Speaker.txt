TRANSCRIPT
========================================
nehemiah chapter 8 verses 1-12 nehemiah chapter 8 verses 1-12 i am excited to be able to come to this as our text we're continuing on the subject of wide awake in the context of pure joy but this had been my part of my inspiration from the very beginning and it just seemed like it was eluding me but god just placed it right before me yesterday and i just got so excited um couldn't sleep so this is i'm really really happy that you're that we'll be able to fellowship together around this nehemiah chapter 8 verses 1 to 12 bear with me as i list my way through some of these names and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the watergate so many beautiful types here and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the books of the law of moses which the lord had commanded to israel so these books are coming into view and ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding so this is important all that could hear with understanding so these are ears that can hear and understand and he says because we know that to see the kingdom of god is to understand so this speaks of an election and a birth upon the first day of the seventh month the first day of the seventh month corresponds with the feast of trumpets and the day of holy convocation leading in as you would continue to read into the feast of tabernacles that's a beautiful beautiful things and he read therein before the street that was before the watergate from the morning which is the rising of the sun until midday before the men and the women and those that could understand and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law so beautiful and ezra the scribes stood upon a pulpit of wood which they made for the purpose and beside him stood matathia and shema and ananiah and uriah and hilkiah and messiah on his right and on his left hand padaya and mishael and malkaya zechariah and meshalam and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up the opening of the book it caused the people to rise he opened the book it caused a raising of those who could hear and who could understand and ezra bless the lord the great god and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshiped the lord with their faces to the ground now it was ezra and uh is standing there but now it says and jeshua and binay and sherabiah and jamin and akub and shevathai hodadaya messiah kalita azariah josephad hennan pelaya and the levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place notice all these people working together just wasn't the one maybe standing there but it was all these people working together for those who could hear and understand to know the words of this book to understand the law and it caused the people to stand in their place so they read in the book of the law of god distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading and nehemiah which is the ter tershatha and ezra the priest the scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is holy unto the lord your god mourn not nor weep this is why they said it for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law so with the the words of the law came and when this was at this opening there was a pricking of their conscience and there was this conviction but so then the ministry says hold on now don't weep then he said unto them go your way eat the fat drink the sweet send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto our lord neither be ye sorry for the joy of the lord is your strength this is where we get this statement the joy of the lord is your strength so the levites stilled all the people saying so now this is this is the same message being repeated after it's been spoken by ezra and that it's been repeated so the levites stealed all the people saying hold your peace for the day is holy neither be aggrieved and all the people went their way and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared unto them praise the lord god bless you you could be seated oh my i trust that we'll be able to get to these things this morning and have a lot that we'd like to express i do want to take just a few moments at the outset just to kind of reset where we were last time kind of carry some things over from um to where we ended um and kind of had to cut off in the middle of something last week but brother randa makes the statement in the church age book how a christian's joy is purely on the lord her her attention her pleasures and her joy is purely on the lord and so he's talking about the believer's spirit and their emotions different from the world he says our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious and it's that phrase that really has caught our attention but nonetheless full of the joy of the lord so this soberness and seriousness is not a somberness or a sadness or uh you know a you know a lack of being thrilled it means something else and brother branham is showing us that the lord's joy is expressed in a spirit that is fresh real and clean and so this it kind of helps us when he's describing this how it's it's clean it's fresh it's real sober and serious it's something to where the flesh is not intoxicated inappropriately it's not something that's just been stimulated for carnal reasons and so it brings us to the idea of soberness in that there's no foreign substance that is instigating some sort of hallucination or causing you some sort of emotional frenzy and we spent a few services on the subject of a clean conscience and how a clean conscience is one that is liberated by the truth and that our conscience holds this place within our spirits to admonish us when we have done something wrong or affirm when we have done something right and we saw in the bible how that a clean conscience a pure conscience and a free conscience is one that the word can deal with to to set a right the rest of the person's emotions and and attitudes and apprehensions and fears and affections and it's one that the the word of god can guide and direct and then we looked at how conscience as even being a part of our overall spirits and that there's a difference between between your conscience and your consciousness and how consciousness would be your awareness of the surroundings and we're conscious of uh the fact that it's maybe a little bit more humid today and uh and because if you're conscious of that then you can react accordingly and you can put more hairspray on your hair or whatever it is you do when it's when it's muggy and humid but it gives you a sense of i'm conscious of certain things and then our conscience tells us the right way to act within the the reality that we are aware of so in the the subject of wide awake we've been taking the the terms sober in serious and how sober we related it to how you're not overcome by emotion and if you're sober then you have the appropriate response to stimulus and that you are you it's not just your emotions that take control of you and you hear some news and i'm even reminded of how the the woman who went and uh was going after the prophet because her son had died and when the messenger came and said how are things she said all is well that was one that was sober she she knew that her son was dead but she was not overcome with emotion to the point of despair but she could actually have be moderate and temperate and say all is well so to be sober is to have the right kind of response to be serious it's not just serious minded the sake of not enjoying anything but it really means no nonsense there's a sincerity there's an earnest there's an earnestness there to where you're doing things soberly and seriously it's sincere it's earnest and just trying to find some words maybe to capture what our thought was on the subject of wide awake last time but if you're wide awake then you're conscious if you're wide awake then you're understanding so you're not only you're aware but you're understanding and then with your awareness and then your understanding of those things that you're aware of you can be engaged in the situation and you can act the right way and behave the right way so if you're wide awake your conduct and your attitude will reflect the moment appropriately you're you're not half asleep you're not kind of oh clueless and oh i didn't realize that but you're you're sober it means there's an alertness there's an awareness and when we talk about being wide awake your senses are in tune and you're you're identifying certain things and all your faculties are unaltered and they're not stimulated by the wrong things and your discernment hasn't been corrupted and you haven't let certain things kind of muddy the waters and confuse you that's what we mean by being wide awake is all my senses are properly channeled all my senses i know how things are i recognize how things are going and yet in the midst of even knowing that things can be chaotic with that kind of consciousness that's when you can have real joy because we we ended last time and we're going to amplify this time the bride's joy is not based on ignorance as long as i can just go in the basement and convince myself everything's fine or stick my head in the sand and convince myself everything's fine that's not the bride's joy now now i'm just going to jump right into it if this seems like kind of a hard turn i'm still learning how to drive so be patient with me first corinthians chapter 15 verse 33 and and i want to come back to this this was going to be my text originally and then the lord just really moved uh yesterday in my heart it was just a thrilling afternoon so we're very familiar with this statement and i kind of have a unique approach maybe here for a little while and i hope you can just stay real close to my thought in my heart and not maybe try to vary from it it says be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners now he's saying this within the context of something very very powerful and profound and you realize this is a chapter that deals with the rapture and so in the resurrection and he makes this statement like don't deceive yourselves evil communications will corrupt good manners now it's widely held that this passage was taken from a play an athenian comedy uh written by menander it's called the theaters and paul is actually quoting from a a work of literature and he's using a phrase that can be tracked back to you like oh my goodness there's no way you would attribute something paul said to something he read well if we believe the message we don't have a problem with that miller brandon was very well read and i thank god for a prophetic filter to be able to take things and put them in context and help us to understand to even be able to take a a a slogan on a cigarette box and bring a message through that that is very relevant and profound and is applicable today so paul takes something that he knew of within classic literature and this athenian comedy that was written and it was one that would have been performed within a um the context of drinking and gaity and you know kind of having a good old time and laughing and and kind of yucking it up and paul says be quotes from this be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners and i will come to that in its context but i want you to notice a couple other places in the scripture in acts chapter 17 verse 28 paul quoted your own pro your own poets and when he quotes their poets he's quoting eratis and clianthus who are grecian poets and he's quoting from them and when he speaks to him because he knows and if i'm going to quote one of your your poets i'm going to quote someone you're familiar with and paul would have been familiar with them uh knowing where he was from he quotes it to him knowing that using this will have an impact on their thought process using this and being able to bring this into the subject will be something that kind of engages them and it gets their attention and then in titus chapter one verse 12 he says he refers to one of themselves or your own prophets and he quotes the epinedes paradox which is epinedis being a creation said all creations are liars so figure that one out him being accretion if he says all christians are liars and that prophecy is true then what he's telling you is false right this is just how clever paul was he actually is quoting this paradox of this this creation how does it resolve itself and you know what he says i'll resolve it and tell you it's true they're liars and they're and they fill their bellies up but paul is actually using uh these poets and these philosophers and citing these other writings and he used familiar classic literature to get the attention of his audience in order to make a point and so last week i just mentioned a couple phrases and i realized maybe the lord just had me stop and end it where we were so i could kind of give some of that background but i want to take a phrase from a poem that says where ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise anybody ever heard that phrase before and paul doesn't necessarily give the title of these works or give them any credibility beyond just quoting them so i'll do the same today there's this poem that says where ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise and it was this statement ignorance is bliss that kind of began to form the thought of wide awake because i was thinking pure joy can only be found in being wide awake god was dealing with me in the message of the hour brother ma'am so i'm like wake up being wide awake and these different principles and i realize that the message of the hour is a message that wakes the bride up it she's not going to be half asleep this is not something there's going to be a people who do not sleep right there's going to be a bride that is translated and she does not sleep so there's so many things that were fitting with this uh where our joy is connected to and this thought of ignorance is bliss i thought well that just runs counter and contradicts what real joy is and so this thought where ignorance is bliss just followed to be wise uh was kind of coming up against what being wide awake in its connection to pure joy now in the context of the poem i'll share it with you so you don't have to google it later and read it i'm not going to read the whole poem i'll just kind of share the context with you but it's talking about it essentially means this and it's talking about young men going off to college and how this one who had graduated from this college notices these guys going to school and he's like man they're going to have fun and they're going to do this and they're going to do that and he's basically saying you know what let the children enjoy not knowing let the student enjoy his time together with his pals let them let them enjoy this time that they have in their youth and in their innocence because it won't do them any good to know and so in that context you might be able to realize well you know in that sense you know just let them enjoy their time while their children uh it would be folly to make them wise to the things that are coming but the poem definitely takes these things of the world and the trials that are coming and the sufferings that are coming and the and the challenges that face adulthood and saying oh ignorance is bliss when you don't know the responsibilities then you don't know what's coming you can just kind of live ignorantly and live blissfully unaware of the things that are to come so let them play let them have their fun because one day their day is coming there's gonna be suffering there's gonna be toil there's gonna be consequence but what struck me is to say ignorance is bliss is astounding because bliss in its etymology means perfect happiness and it speaks of great joy and because of its closeness to the word bless it kind of begin to take on this connotation that bliss is a spiritual joy and bliss is a heavenly joy and that bliss is a perfect happiness a perfect joy that's connected with eternal things and in the church age book brother branham in referring to revelations chapter 2 verse 11 it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death and in reference to that scripture brother branham makes this statement why will this overcomer this believer escape and go into the realms of eternal life and bliss so the the the bliss bliss is something that's associated with eternity a perfect happiness doesn't happen outside the context of god's perfect will that the bliss when it says ignorance is bliss i wanted to kind of get into striking them and say well that's a little bit deceptive that's a little bit misleading this idea that ignorance is bliss because bliss is related to the realms of eternal life he says in one other place but above all things we're thankful for the sunlight of god that gives us the shining of eternal bliss so the sunlight of god gives the shining of eternal bliss he says in another place we believe in the physical resurrection of the dead to receive a body not an old and wrinkled one as we go into the grave but a new one in the very bliss of youth to live forever so bless is not something associated with just being ignorant or unaware but bliss is associated with eternity if bliss is identified with an eternal realm then it's something that is that is all-encompassing and all-knowing and this is this is what true bliss is so ignorance is bliss just in looking at what bliss is starts to say well i don't know if i could actually accept that as an absolute truth but then when you consider what ignorance is and then really the whole statement falls apart because ignorance is a lack of wisdom ignorance is a lack of knowledge and that's not the bliss that the word promises the word doesn't say hey just go to sleep and ignore everything you know it'll all be all right when you wake up that's not what the word wants you to do that's not how the word deals with your hearts so when it says that ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise it actually causes us to accept the principle that in the scripture the worst thing you could be is foolish and to say tis folly to be wise is contradictory because the opposite of a fool is one who is wise and so how could it be folly to be wise it just it just doesn't make any sense to say that ignorance is bliss just followed to be wise it's contradictory and then to think that ignorance is a lack of wisdom and the lack of knowledge the bible says in habit 2 14 for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters cover the sea now this is a prophecy clearly about the earth saying that the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters cover the sea so it's wanting to describe it in a way that as it the seas are completely covered with water and i kind of pondered a little bit and said well what in the world does that mean waters cover the sea the seas are water and so it's pervasive it's complete it covers all the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters cover the sea now ponder this if the earth is going to be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord then also consider that what god does to the earth he does to the individual right are we not taught that that in the three the stages of the redemption of the earth we see that god does the same thing with the individual and if in the ultimate outcome of the redemption of the earth is the earth is going to be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord then therefore we must believe that we ourselves are coming to a promise where we can somehow someway be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord and so this ignorance is bliss is certainly seeding something in your mind to cause us to think that well if you just don't know it won't hurt you if you don't know you won't worry about it and i recognize that there's some carnal truth to that but let me just say that the peace that god wants to give you is not one that's ignorant now whereas the poem this poem says ignorance is bliss there's a novel in our literature well-known literature to those who would be well-read and especially maybe those who like to burn books i don't care if this is one that got burned quite a bit but i won't give the title but there's a statement in the book and i'll kind of amplify it a little bit that ignorance is strength now again pondered this it was a slogan of this part of this government in this book and and it was a slogan of the ministry of truth and the ministry of truth in this book was one of four different govern government ministries up with what was called the party so instead of getting kind of bogged down in the specifics i want you to think about the form and the dynamics of this and how that paul would even tell one well just like one of your poets said and just as quoted by one of your own prophets and then he quotes from this athenian comedy and paul is using it now to make the point that maybe they were onto something maybe you should ponder this maybe you should think about this i want to i want to represent this that that there is a truth and an assessment being made about human nature and an observation being made about how satan's kingdom works because this is written in response to these totalitarian regimes that came up in world war ii and whether it be nazism or communism and socialism that began to rise up and he began to identify these certain characteristics of how someone could demand absolute complete unquestioned obedience to somebody and the things the links that they had to go to to make sure that that regime would be successful in subjugating the people in taking away their free moral agency and making them do and say and do things that were unthinkable and so we know that there was demons that were loosed uh under and that were poured out upon the world and and then these these pre-tribulation things that were being poured out upon the jews with eichmann and hitler and mussolini and it was physically persecuting the jews and then we see it manifested in these regimes we see it manifested in these governments and now we know they have been loosed spiritually on the bride is that right so now i'm going to take this this this novel and i'm by no means endorsing it but this writer this classical writer makes these observations about how these governments were working and then i want you to think that if that's the observation of how they worked in the political realm think of how it works now in the spiritual realm quote some of my favorite preachers come on somebody this is really good just to ponder now so there was three different slogans of the party you could put whatever you really want to do that if you've got something you want to write down in your in your notes you go for it but it was called the party and there was three slogans upon her this war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength are those starting to sound a little weird to you war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength and this is what it says the ministry of peace concerns itself with war the ministry of truth concerns itself with lies the ministry of love concerns itself with torture and the ministry of plenty concerns itself with starvation so they called themselves a ministry of peace but yet if only engaged in war the ministry of love and it only engaged in torture the ministry of truth and all it did was engage itself in lies so you notice now there is a deliberate contradiction it's a deliberate contradiction in the ministry of peace concerning itself with war so it says war is peace and freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength now this is this is a statement i took from this book if one is to rule now think about satan's kingdom now we're not just talking about the success of political parties and and uh wow brother aaron you really gave mussolini are working over this morning no i want you to think in a spiritual realm how these powers try to work on us as the bride to keep us from exercising our faith in the word of god he says if one is to rule and to continue ruling one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality so the governing party the dictator the one that wants to demand absolute and complete unquestioned obedience has to dislocate one's sense of reality now you ready for this i think this is pretty rich for the secret of willership is to combine a belief in one's own affaliability with the power to learn from past mistakes you have to first believe that you're infallible and then you have the ability to learn from past mistakes it doesn't even make any sense but yeah this is what one has to accept and one has to believe you have to combine this belief that you were infallible and still able to learn from your past mistakes and so with that contradiction existing within the ruler the citizens are forced to repress truth and if there's any any truth it's repressed and to accept lives and there i believe the language that was invented or used in this book i think the the nation was oceana and uh in its location of its capital was in london and it had these pyramid shapes for the ministries 300 meters high and on the minister the facade of the ministry it had these slogans you know war is peace and freedom of slavery and they had this concept called double think i'm not losing you all right i mean i won't quiz you at the end of this we won't be passing out scantrons you won't have to write a thousand word essay i'll buy you the cliff notes if you get nervous we'll take the test together we're just wanting you to think about these principles for a moment double think this is what double think is it's the ability to hold two opposing ideas in one's mind simultaneously and accepting both as true and this is what you've got to get people to do hold two opposing ideas in one's mind at the same time in believing that both are true and one of i think the phrase was black white and to not only believe that it's both black and white and know that that's contradictory but to actually believe that that's true and the goal was this process of double think is meant to produce an in to kind of induce a lack of consciousness that you're just constantly bombarded with this inconsistency that the person begins to lack consciousness and therefore lacking consciousness engages in self-deception and the goal ultimately stated of the party is to induce an insanity so that the people are actually given into insanity and are no they're hypocritical but believe they're not hypocritical it seems like a stretch this is exactly what's being proposed and so to have complete control in order to do this and to get them to do the double think and in order them to become insane and to become lack this consciousness the party constantly engaged in suppressing knowledge didn't want you to know the truth spread propaganda wanted you to believe it and in doing so the citizens were never actually aware of how oppressed they were just always keep them from the truth always keep them from the reality always make them feel that are in bondage always make them feel like they need to be baptized again always make them feel under condemnation always feel like they're sick and broken and you're the only one that can fix them this is how they operate in such a way to keep you in behold into the government and and uh numbing you down and causing you to be unconscious so if the sins are never aware of how oppressed they are they're just thinking well isn't this great isn't this wonderful and so this phrase now ignorance is strength we're specifically used to overthrow the people's consciousness of contradictions it was used to allow them to engage in this double think to accept lies and not be conscious of what the truth is but to accept these things that were lies now let me let me kind of after we've kind of belabored that and we'd all make an a minus in uh in our literature course in college now the world society and even man if you could catch this these very dynamics we've been mentioning they'll try to manufacture a happiness through ignorance and and try to manufacture a contentment through dullness so everyone needs to be kind of dumbed down and dulled and numbed and accept that this is the right thing and this is the way we all live and this is the way things ought to be and ignorance of strength if you don't know it won't hurt you ignorance the less you know the stronger you are the less you know the stronger you are just accept what we're telling you and accept how we say it and accept the way that it is and there's a certain way that they wanted to use lies not truth to get the people just kind of dumb down and live in this fallen reality and actually a perversion of reality and wanted to keep them from the full reality i mean really the attitude is as i begin to study this where ignorance is bliss and ignorance is strength if you're not concerned with truth then you never need to be reflective begin to ponder how the world and society and even ourselves sometimes try to produce a synthetic happiness through contra you know denying contradictions and through ignorance and through being dulled and having our discernment deadened and our awareness deadened if we're not worried about truth then we never have to examine ourselves by it if we're not worried about truth and we're never we're never reflective or introspective we just kind of have this contentment that how i feel is what matters what i see is what matters and there's really no absolute truth i can just say and do whatever i want and i don't ever need to be examined i don't ever need to be introspective and think about it if that happens you can be an absolute to yourself right no truth then i can be an absolute to myself or you ready you can give that place to a personality what they did in this novel they gave it to a party you can give that place to a person or a demagogue a leader who gains power by appealing to your desires and prejudices rather than the word now think about this be very honest with yourselves that this is how what we can do we can forfeit our liberty in christ forfeit maybe we do not become absolute to ourselves but we take our faith and we place it in a person who gains power not through the word of god or not because the word is lifted up but they appeal to your desires and they appeal to your prejudices so therefore they gain your support and you're willing to let them lead did that escalate too quickly for some of y'all and brother branham says this in christianity versus idolatry he says you've got to know the word think about how sinister ignorance is bliss is and how contradictory to the word is but now even more sinister is this idea that ignorance is strength and then it's used in such a way to cause us as believers to forfeit our liberty and christ in the re and be held back from the full reality of the word of god because of this kind of spirit that's let loose against the bride i don't want you to miss that connection the reason why this is relevant is what we saw politically working against the jews now works ecumenically and religiously and spiritually against the bride and if this is the assessment of a classical writer with regards to political regimes in the 1900s and how it worked within socialism communism and nazism then we must recognize that these dynamics are at work now to keep the bride from rapturing faith and there's so much more how this could be amplified using these terminologies but i've done more than paul did because paul just said it really quick and moved on there's got to be a third corinthians somewhere where he take as much time as i did talk about these poets and these philosophers but let me let me just kind of bring it to this because i hope that this will help uh seal this in you've got to know the word stay on the word the greatest battle is at hand what is it going to be with these 200 000 thousand demons he says now we've played church for years and years but the hours come now that when genes jefferson jennings will withstand moses as the bible said they would and it's going to be spiritual battle conflict uh if you're thinking in your mind ooh yeah i'd like to see that kind of like you you go and you watch nascar because you want to see the wrecks and if you think you're going to see it it's not going to look like you think it's going to look probably ooh i love a good fight let me see this it's going to be a spiritual battle conflict there'll be some just continue on they never actually recognize the conflict the denominational church will just move right on into domination now think about that that's just the way that i found it everywhere i could find it domination not into denomination it's already denominated but it's going to move into domination we know into a demagogue into a these these governments and these systems that are man ruling the people and go on the way it goes but i mean the real true believer is coming to that battlefield so it's only the real true believer that's going to wake up to the fact that we can't play church anymore going to recognize janice and jamborees that are withstanding moses as the bible said it would and they're going to be the ones that engage in the spiritual battle and the conflict while others just move on and are dominated the real true believers coming to that battlefield and he says you better be versed what does it mean verse you better know you better understand you better be better be well equipped and know what you're doing you better be versed and know what you're doing or you can take an evil spirit so easy and not know so what is our defense against taking on an evil spirit being well versed and knowing what we're doing because if you're not well versed and you don't know what you're doing it's very easy to take on an evil spirit and never even know it so he says if it's contrary to this word don't believe it stay with that word he's telling us if it opposes this message if it's contrary to this message if it doesn't harmonize with the voice then leave it alone then i want to know what it says i want to know the word i don't want there to be some part of my understanding that lacks i don't want to have some part that's not well versed i want to know what i'm doing because i don't want to take any evil spirit very easily so as i was we were making this point last time and and we're still kind of not completely finished where we were but pure joy is found in being wide awake it's it's wherein you have a very healthy conscience it's one that's seared it's one that's not encumbered it's one that's not defiled or weak but it's a healthy conscience and then you are fully conscious okay so it's not just having a conscience but there's a there's an alertness there's an awareness now and i i know i realize that there might be some how they're synonymous and it may seem to be semantics but there's a there's a reality here that we find in the message as we looked last time in luke chapter 15 verse 17 about the prodigal son he had he was driven by a desire to take his inheritance go into the world squander it then join himself as a slave into a foreign country and lose all of his friends and he's an exhibiting uh inappropriate conduct for a son of his stature and he and he made very poor decisions for a son who was raised the way that he was and he finds himself in this deplorable condition the bible uses the phrase and when he came to himself jesus says when he came to himself almost as if he's waking up from an amnesia he came to himself it means he came to his senses you know he sobered up whatever lust had intoxicated him whatever desires had intoxicated him whatever ambition and dreams had driven him to do the wrong things now he sobers up and now he's thinking clearly wait a minute what am i thinking and we pointed out how that the joy of redemption was out of reach until he woke up to the reality of his sin the joy of redemption the joy of forgiveness the joy that he was to receive in restoration it was out of reach until he woke up because he couldn't show back up at the father's footsteps and drunk he couldn't show back up i i still intoxicated by the same lust that drove him away so he had to be fully awake and it wasn't just waking up to the reality of his sin when he came to himself he recognized his condition but then he also recognized the love of his father and he recognized that his father held a remedy for the condition that he was in and with the right kind of mind he said i won't go back and demand anything i'll go back willing to be a slave and so he when he came to himself he came to his senses he somebody was thinking clearly and let me say this and and this may be the mouthful that kind of signals uh what what i my heart has been indicting and even every single one of these services so far the bride's joy is found in waking up to the present realities of god's word that's that's the bride's joy it's not going to be in winning the lottery it's not if the sun's sweeping for the the bride's joy is found in waking up to the present realities of god the word of god teaches us that it's the manifestation of god that stirs the bride up it's the revelation of god's word that is the bride's stimulation of joy the stimulation of satisfaction listen you will not find it anywhere else if you've lived your life all these different decades feeling like something was missing and things don't ever seem to work out and you're always living behold this threshold of joy that you feel you have the potential for let me say it is the revelation of the word of god that can fill your tank it's a revelation of god that will give that completeness and satisfaction that you longed for how am i it's this statement that to me is so important they have not recognized the awakening of the bride well who was he talking about talking about a church world that was so close to the truth church the world that was entertaining the truth and hosting the truth and and very close and very near it but he says they have not recognized the awakening of the bride but instead of taking that statement and laughing at brother moore or laughing at life tabernacle or saying these things about these other people are you wide awake if they have not recognized the awakening of the bride has the bride recognized her awakening is she coming alive is she waking up then this is something realized if there's an awakening i want to be awake and we went through a number of scriptures that dealt with this principle of watch and be sober the bible says be sober be vigilant and we saw that how it meant let us be calm wise in one translation wide awake and when the bible said watch it speaks it speaks it comes from the root to raise up to cause to stand up to arouse from sleep and so when the bible says watch and be sober watch and be vigilant you have to rise from a slumbering state it says watch it's a recovery it's a waking up it's recovering from a dullness it's actually recovering from a disorientation well i'm not so sure what it is it doesn't seem clear i'm not sure but when you wake up you recover from that dullness you you recover from that that lack of sensitivity and so now if you would just turn to look at nehemiah chapter eight with me we'll start with verse five and i have the verses here on the board and i think what i'd like to do is maybe go through this rather quickly but i want you to kind of catch these things because and lord willing we could spend more time on it later but he says ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people and i was they could see it and it was done in such a way he's standing up above the people says for he was above the people he's standing on a pulpit and he opens the book inside of all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up this was something that caused the people to arise it caused them as you'll notice to come to attention and they're going to listen intentively they didn't have all their pic blankets laid out they're just kind of sitting around and coloring and doodling and all kind of entertaining themselves it's just kind of background noise no when this one stood up in this place all kids all those who could hear and who could understand notice that the book was open and the open book caused them to stand up and ezra blessed the lord the great god and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshiped the lord with their faces to the ground so here's ezra who is above all the people and he's the one that opens the book and causes the people to stand up and everyone can see this but then it says also jeshua and benai and sherabaya and jaman and akub and shabbat thai and hodahe and messiah and khalida and azera and josephat and hannah and pelia and the levites notice it says cause the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place so there was one that opens it and there's one that's giving this law but then there's others that can take this law and even translate the languages of the others who are gathered take the meaning that it's being said and then share it with the people and now they're giving it to the people and everyone has caused to the people to understand the law each one doesn't have his own interpretation they're all understanding exactly what's in that book that ezra opened up and they caused the people to understand so levites now in their place causing people understand and what is it doing it's placing the people positionally the people stood in their place no so they read in the book of the law as they so they read in the book of the law of god notice these words distinctly which means to make clear to clarify and gave the sense that means insight and wisdom and caused them to understand the reading those that were there with ezra didn't change the meaning didn't muddy up the understanding they they spoke in such a way to where they're not interfering with the truth and brother bottom even makes this statement in birth pains i hope that's simple enough that you can understand it these men if they pick this up pick up this and goes out with it they can make more sense to it bring it to a place you would i just want to lay this seed then hope they make it come to life now that doesn't change the life of it doesn't change the meaning of it but it brings it into manifestation it brings it to where you would do it you can understand it they make more sense to it doesn't mean they change it they don't add to it they don't change the life of it but they bring it to a place where you would this is the fidelity and faithfulness that god requires in this dynamic and so now they're reading it cause them to distinctly give sins cause and understand and nehemiah which is the trishafa and ezra the priest the scribe and the levites taught that taught the people said unto all the people they got the same thing to say this day is holy unto the lord your god mourn not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law it caused a brokenness it caused a shame let me know how short we are think of all the things we've forsaken they can't believe for decades we've done this and we've done it wrong but it says then they said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared oh my what a challenge to those of us who are the elect who've heard the words of this book to go and eat on it and feast on it and give a portion to those who don't have it for this day is holy unto the lord neither be you sorry for the joy of the lord is your strength don't cry don't weep john for the lion of the tribe of you to have propelled prevailed to loose the seals and and john's mourning is turned into joy this is the very basis for their they though they may have mourned and though they would be weeping he said the joy the lord is your strength and this being the message now from nehemiah and ezra it says the levites in verse 11. so the levites stealed all the people saying hold your peace for the day is holy neither be he grieved reinforcing the message that has gone forth reinforcing the conviction reinforcing the fact that they shouldn't be beat up with this truth they're not to be bound down they're not to be woe as me and feel sorry for themselves let me just say i feel like one of the most and i've maybe mentioned this before already that one of the most abused quotes in the message is the bride is one of the sickest bodies i know of that was true then but what he says in that context is there's more to this ministry than just physical healing in other words this ministry heals the sickness of the bride's body that ministry has been loosed the bride has received it she is risen she's no longer the sickest body there is why because she's received her ministry of healing and so here again it's the levites are reinforcing this hold your peace the day is holy neither be he grieved and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and descend the portions and to make great mirth why because the joy of the lord is your strength and how is it notice this at the end of verse 12 how is it they could make great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared unto them not just because they heard them and not just because they believed they were true but they understood them they could not have gone their way to eat to drink and to send portions and to enjoy the joy of the lord which is their strength until they had heard the words and understood the words that were declared to them let me say this this is the awakening we need this is the bride's awakening right in this context they understood the words that were declared unto them and in understanding the words the message was the joy of the lord is your strength the joy of the lord is your strength not ignorance and not just in mourning not just in repenting not just in grieving listen the laodicean church age does not end in the admonishment to repent but the laodicean church ages brought to a place of behold i stand at the door and knock john chapter 8 verse 32 this is what jesus says i believe you referenced this last time and this kind of provides this basis for how direct we could be in this context he says ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the great mirth of the people the joy the lord which was their strength came upon understanding the words that were declared unto them in christ saying you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free therefore our joy is filled by understanding our joy our happiness is informed by knowledge not by putting blinders on not trying to dumb ourselves down but it's fueled by understanding it's informed by knowledge if you're going to know you must be awake if you're i mean this is just obvious even brother adam was reading yesterday how he makes talks if you're dead all your senses are gone even talks about the different levels of dreams and different things he says well this is this happens when you're completely unconscious if we're going to know we must be awake if our senses are dull you can't see you can't learn you can't understand now and not just making that up just to kind of make a point if that's the case then god has an answer he has a remedy if we're talking about clean conscience it can only operate perfectly within a full consciousness what good would a full healthy conscience be if you weren't awake how could a conscience a pure conscience allow you to navigate correctly if you are not conscious of what you're navigating we can't have a clean conscience and a robust conscious and have this conscience that is pure and connected with the soul realm and boy we've got this we got this connection and my conscience is clean my sins are forgiven i i'm justified and then not be aware now be conscious not be fully awake and and this scripture is quickened to me yesterday in a very unique way and i'm going to admit on the outside that this is a different looking at it differently and taking a different attitude a different avenue in luke chapter 22 verses 31 to 32 the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat i want you to remember again how satan's kingdom is built upon lies and deception satan use the double think satan uses the contradictions and wants you to believe both of them are true at the same time say it's trying to get you to a place where you're wore down and you dull your consciousness and he wants you to accept lies as the truth that is satan's kingdom and he says satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat and it struck me i thought well that's very odd because there's a principle in the scripture where that's exactly what god does that there's a separating out of the of the wheat the germ the life the seed from the shuck and the chaff and and i thought well that's that's interesting that satan would desire to sift us as wheat and how that his process of sifting us as wheat must be vastly different from the process when where the seed is not air with the shuck how there's a separate life moving on into the grain and he says but i have prayed for thee so i one hand satan wants to sift him as wheat but now christ prays for peter as a whole person satan's wanting a system christ prays for him and he says that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthened thy brethren and in doing so it's this beautiful way of describing peter's conversion that satan wants to do one thing to peter but jesus prays differently for him just as paul said i pray that your whole soul mind and body be preserved blameless your soul spirit and body be preserved blameless satan wants to sift you as wheat but i prayed that not only would your faith fail not but that you'd also be converted which is the baptismal holy ghost that your soul would be sealed because of your faith right the new birth is the sealing of your faith you believe that god gives you the baptism the lord goes as a seal of your faith and then that puts him into action to where now he is able to strengthen the brethren his faith has led him to a ceiling and now he can now function as a person as a being with all the passions that kind of made him a unique and peculiar within the disciples and always the one that was even here he's like no i'll kill somebody for you jesus god is able not to take the person and take who peter was and through his faith his sealed faith in his conversion he's now going to strengthen the brethren so now this is this is how it struck me satan wants to separate you he wants to sift you as wheat now i i realize that that that's used in the context of you know stress you out and pound you and to beat you and to winnow you and put you on the threshing floor and there's a way that you're just getting beat up but what's his goal to separate you shift you and now the saint wants to separate the wheat the seed the soul from the shack in you right because you're you're a three-part person so what he want to do is get in there to where he can begin to divide you up where you have a soul but then you have the flesh and he wants to sift you to separate those things and in order to separate as he begins to separate them you begin to feel well i'm one person in my soul but i'm another person in my flesh and in separating that he creates this distress and it causes this disharmony in the mind which begins to wrestle with and fight against that rest that is in your soul and i've got this rest in my soul but i got this mind that's being bombarded i got this truth in life in my soul but i got this mind that has memory conscience reason and affection and imagination and he wants to kind of divide that and if he can separate that he puts us in a state of constant agitation and what he wants to do ultimately is put you in this place where you believe that you can have the rest of christ in your soul but not enjoyed in your spirit and he wants to sift you as weak to where now you're a divided person with double think i'm saved sealed delivered born again set free justified filled with the power of god in my soul but i'm bowed down in my spirit and that's a nasty trick of the party it's a nasty trick of the devil it's a nasty trick of a demagogue because god wants to take the life that's in your soul and harmonize your spirit to it just trying to weaken the influence of christ in your soul over your body do you realize the power in your soul is strong enough to say body get back in shape right now and have to obey it the soul has the ability to begin to place an image of a well body upon you and what does the devil try to do sift you as wheat all right fine she really believes she saved all right she really believes she's bribed fine i'll just let her be bride but i'ma separate out her flesh her mind and her body from her soul and i'll just let it live like that that's not how we're supposed to live but the brandon makes this statement in future home is that real to you i'm admitting it's a different look in message future home or the earthly bride in the heavenly bridegroom he makes the statement i'm trying to get the plan of redemption to you and that describe his ministry i mean that it's like what what was his mention he he delivered the plan of redemption to us he describes it and this is so beautiful in this very very rich rich sermon i'm trying to get the plan of redemption to you before if i don't get nothing else see if i don't get nothing else get the plan of redemption to you get your plan of redemption he says the baptism of fire on it he's talking about the earth only is to cleanse it and make it a meek fit place for his meek to live in so then he says like he did us his creation to live in what he does to the earth he does the individual what he does individually does the earth and it's the the sanctification the justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost the water the blood the spirit you know those different realms that he breaks that up in before he could come in it he had to give us the baptism of the fire then the holy ghost come in and live baptism of fire then when you get that baptism of the fire then the holy ghost can come in as it does now notice what it does hey let that fire go children this is what it does and if it hasn't just let it right don't question it just let it it burns up everything contrary to the word out of you burn burn lord let it burn if i've gotten in your way if i've dug trenches if i've done some remediation so that the hedges wouldn't burn large just burn it out of me whatever it is burn it out of me he says it won't believe nothing else but the word because it is the word now that's what we was talking about the other day the evidence of the holy ghost and i could find where earlier he was really hammering on this a few months earlier notice what he says the evidence of the holy ghost is the we were talking the other day of the evidence of the holy ghost the evidence of the holy ghost is when you can receive the word not some system not a demagogue not a party not a church not politics not preset pretense not cult of personality anybody want to throw something else out there think about it it can't be in any of that he says when you can receive the word not some system but have a clear understand i i often try to conjugate it in a way that it doesn't seem like a fragment but have a clear understand clear understanding is that maybe how i would think it might need to be ended but he says but have a clear understand how do you know the word is clear understand it watch catch that watch it vindicate itself that's how you know the word is clear what's the watch it vindicate itself we must see the vindication is the interpretation the interpretation is the vindication the manifestation of the promise that that's the vindication he says watch it vindicate itself he says well you say i see this do it and that oh yes weeds live the same way but it's got to be the entire word to the bride you have to be part of him he is the word and what a part of him is it the word that's promised for this day when he calls his bride be a part of that you get it now don't lose that now that's the plan of redemption he's trying to get to us he's saying and this is this is maybe i included all that in there because i'd really like to emphasize this maybe to try to connect it to in a later part the word that's promised for this day it's got to be the entire word that's what we're watching vindicate itself he's saying watch it you've got to see it you've got to understand it because he says the evidence of the holy ghost is not just merely say the holy ghost in you saying amen to every word but he says it's when you can receive the word and have a clear understand brother branham does not just leave us in this place where we're just believing and our believing kind of stunts us and we're just kind of dull and we're dim with it and we're just simpletons but our simply only believing loses us to a place where we can understand and i believe it's the bride's inheritance to see and to understand and to know the plan of redemption to have a clear understanding that's where satan would want to sift you as wheat to somehow have this well my soul knows but my mind i have no idea but my soul knows but boy this body boy it sure it sure is a lust demon you know what i mean no that that's that's incongruent that's disharmony but a clear understanding so going back to the beginning i'm not starting all over so don't get nervous but in first corinthians chapter 15 verse 33 be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners if you keep company with the wicked it's saying you'll lose even the intelligence you have if you keep in the wrong company what you know and what you believe and what your convictions are can ultimately be watered down and you'll even lose the manners the intelligence you have now be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame so he's taking these things together awake to righteousness and sin not return to soberness of mind return from drunkenness and he's talking about the doling of one senses the deadening of one's sensitivities he's talking about the lack of understanding he's referring to the intoxicating influences of myth truths where there would be these lies and these contradictions and this deadening down to where well i don't i just i don't really want to know i don't want to know i don't want to know i don't know don't understand or understand do we just get to this place where you're not really awake you're not really alert you've been lulled to sleep and he's identifying when he says awake to righteousness and i realize now that there was a lot of scriptures that we had used last time that this was following and so now as it kind of wells up within my heart i hope it doesn't seem to be a little bit disjointed but the the scriptures we read about the sleepiness and i'd taken out the parts even today where jesus is saying will you pray will you watch with me and pray and what do they keep doing the disciples keep falling asleep and the the sleepiness and the drunkenness is this apathy towards serious things this drunkenness this intoxication and this where this as brother brown identifies it plain church i was just playing church and listen playing church can look really really fun playing church can look really really serious playing church could look like wow this must be it but it's just a game why because there's this apathy to serious things there's this apathy towards things that are important things that are spiritually important and here in first corinthians chapter 15 paul is defending the truth of the resurrection he's standing for the truth that there will be a resurrection and he's going to arrive in first verse 51 on the mystery of the translation behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed that's bride scripture we're not all gonna sleep we're not all gonna be lulled to sleep we're not all gonna be dead in our senses we're not all going to see partly and in part and have this dead and that dead we're not all going to sleep but we shall all be changed he's talking about the mystery of the translation he's defending the truth of the rapture he says in verse 32 if there is no resurrection of the dead he says let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die and what is he referring to these customs the creation the the athenians to their ways and that's why he quotes this athenian comedy immediately afterward be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners he actually identifies this certain way of thinking in their political realm a certain way of living within their entertainment realm a certain way of articulating things and believing in things and enjoying things that's what they did they just said hey we're here to eat and drink for tomorrow we die and he calls it out he says don't be deceived evil communications corrupt good manners so he's referring to this drunkenness of let us eat and drink what is it ignorance is bliss just eat drink for tomorrow we die you realize just how short of your promise you would live if that's what you believed as a bride member just eat and drink because we're all going to die anyways ponder that a little bit we went through the scripture before how he says be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners and so much your ethos your moral character how bad company the fellowship and around the wrong things will ruin your sentiments it ruins your nature it defiles who you are so paul's answer i i'm asking this individually so feel free to answer individually are you still with me to this point it's 11 38 we can all be conscious of the time i i don't feel pricked in my conscience that i'm too long so everything seems to be in a really good state of harmony right now but he's defending the resurrection he said if there is no resurrection live however you want he says if there's no resurrection then hey you know let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die but he's saying hold on the wrong kind of attitude the wrong kind of belief the wrong kind of approach is going to ruin your nature it's going to defile your spirit so he says awaken or come to a sober in right mind have your eyes opened to have your mind enlightened awake he says to righteousness that means what's proper and just but it also means to that which is right to that which is in harmony with the word in other words paul is looking at these to the in the corinthians and he's saying there's a mystery i want to show you a mystery this is a beautiful truth this is a reality we will not all sleep but we shall all be changed he says if there's not going to be a rapture we might say well then let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die but don't be deceived the wrong kind of attitude the wrong kind of awareness the wrong kind of understanding will ultimately defile your character and you'll not be living correctly so he says shake yourself from your complacency stop playing church shake yourself from your lethargy that's what paul is saying to the church awake to the true knowledge of god awake to righteousness and sin not let me ask you this do you know what wakes the bride have you been in this message have you been reading it do you know what the brethren said wakes this bride up and he says some have not the knowledge of god some do not know the truth some are ignorant of the mystery and listen nothing is more shameful than i think it's wesley that said it than the sleepy ignorance of god the sleepy ignorance the lethargic the unconcerned the dull ignorance of god bill abraham says in the indictment he says today men walk ignorantly they don't know that's the truth what tremendous parallel is he bringing the first crucifixion with another crucifixion he says today men walk ignorantly they don't know that's the truth they think it's some kind of ism they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of revelation now you don't have to be the one who's saying crucify to become subject to an ism right you don't have to be the one saying it's wrong it's a called crucify to come subject to an ism he said as long as you don't dig down deep enough and get into the spirit of revelation then you can just be walking in it as some kind of ism he says they don't pray enough they don't call on god enough they just lightly take it notice oh well i believe there's a god sure go ahead and take this to the nth degree the devil believes the same thing the devil believes it more than some people claim to believe it the devil believes it and trembles people just believe it and go on oh come on can't you see how paul is saying awake awake to righteousness he says but the devil trembles no and his judgment is coming and people believe it and don't pay no attention the judgment is coming and he says guilty of crucifying him he says today men walking ignorantly guilty of crucifying him sure he says i indict this generation finding them guilty by the same word that found them guilty at the beginning that's right jesus said who can condemn me he was the word made flesh and today the same word is made flesh that's heavy i can on i can't hardly lift that that's heavy what is he building around today men walk ignorantly i i feel like maybe there's i'm not being a very good brick mason today and there's like maybe some gaps and stuff that we're not quite filling in but this is this is where you're this is where you're placed and let me try let me just bring this too a close i have a statement i'd like to read i didn't know if i'd be able to get to it but it's it's amplifying on that they have not recognized the awakening of the bride and it'll just make a wonderful platform to go forward you know i just kind of pondering this in closing that people people can claim to be happy right you ever find somebody who's who is in this particular state where they're saying i'm the happiest i've ever been but it's very obvious they're really the most miserable they've ever been and so at best they're just unaware but ponder this at worst they're willfully ignorant and brother man says today men walk ignorantly and there's a standard in the law where one is willfully ignorant and that's a decision in bad faith to avoid becoming informed about something so that you avoid having to make decisions that that information might prompt you thinking about that trying to find somebody whose face lit up so i can just look at you get me home will for ignorance is don't tell me because if i know then i'll probably have to act according to that knowledge and i really don't want to i'd rather not know because if i knew then it might make me responsible i might be accountable so in other words in bad faith i will just i choose not to know so i can remain as i am so that i don't have to make decisions based upon the information that's presented to me let me say this to you as the bride of jesus christ there should be nothing that you're afraid of knowing nothing that you should be afraid of knowing why because we can say that there's nothing in the will of god i fear and there's nothing out of his will that i want therefore i am not afraid to know his will this willing ignorance will ignore the truth just to find some place of contentment just so that well if i knew then that might change things if i find out then that might change things and so they become willfully ignorant in order to find rest in today's chaos and if you're elected this you'll never find it until you come to know the bride will only find joy and truth nothing else and and if i can say this the greater understanding of the truth the greater joy musicians if you could come wide awake it's not ignorance it's not double think it's a sound mind it's being wide awake so you don't miss it wide awake so that when the word is opened you stand and then you your tension is drawn to the book and then it's distinct and there's sense given to it and the mystery is removed to you and then you know you know how to run with it you know how to walk in it and that becomes your source of joy brother branham says in recognizing your day and its message he says everywhere now there's no revival everyone is complaining ministers crying i was reading one of the outstanding papers that comes here to the church a very fine paper i know the editor and i know the people and they're godly people verifying brother and sister more of the herald of his coming one of the finest papers on the field herald of his coming i think it's in the third seal brother brown's making reference to this very same thing but they can hardly they'll hardly print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray sounded trumpet he says how many reads it you know you see it all the time fast pray fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're gonna have a great break-in of the day there's gonna a great thing going to happen and you pray pray pray we're not too late yet i don't believe he's being cynical i i don't believe that he's being condescending at all he's just identifying that here's a magazine called the herald of his coming and all they're telling you is to pray pray pray fast pray and he says why do they do that why do they do that and this is sincere they want a great awakening they're crying believing there will be awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride they're they're still calling for fast pray fast pray sound to trumpet oh we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's going to be a great thing happened oh hopefully we're not too late and what does brother branham point to he says what they're missing is the awakening of the bride that's what they're looking for that's what they're trying to herald that's what they're trying to pray for that's what they're fasting for and they've missed what they're crying for what they want is happening right before them they have not recognized the awakening of the bride oh let me say may none of us miss it this is our awakening i don't want to miss it i want to recognize it he says by being a christian they feel the pull of the hour so there's something they feel something right there's some sense there's some part of them that kind of it feels something he says but they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for way off in the future he says when it's already happened right by you now we can actually think about our neighbors in the apartment next door right it happened right by him and they're missing it he says when it's happened right by you that's the same thing they did in the old days draw on this parallel again like you did in the indictment they was believing in the coming messiah they believed that there would be a forerunner come but it was right on them and they didn't know it how obvious is this right how obvious is this to us they didn't recognize it they believed there would be come a forerunner that would fall around the messiah and they cut his head off and killed their messiah because it was prophesied that they would be blinded so they killed the they cut off the head of the forerunner and killed their messiah because it was right on them and they didn't know it and brother branham is now trying to bring this very this very same thought we're just trying to be very faithful to the way that he says it and says they too have not recognized the awakening of the bride she's received her stirring she's received her message that raises her up she's received her word that wakes her up and he's saying today men walk ignorantly what are the ignorant men doing they're crucifying the lord again crucifying him is afresh and then recognizing your day in its message he says they killed the forerunner they killed the messiah and it happens right by him and they miss it that's a lot to ponder isn't it that's a lot to think about let's stand lord i don't want to walk ignorantly [Music] lord i don't want to miss it [Music] let's bow our heads [Music] gracious heavenly father [Music] i know that i'm just leaning deeper into a thought that certainly merits more time and attention as it relates to the fulfilling of the word of god in this last day [Music] but lord i realize that i'm not speaking to novices i'm not speaking to people who have not heard but those who have heard [Music] and those that have ears to hear and eyes to see and as it was expressed in the book of nehemiah those who've seen the book open have stood on their feet lord i want to be faithful as a levite to say what is in that opening of the word [Music] and lord there's a there's a juncture lord that i see that as the bride of jesus christ our our contentment our satisfaction and our joy is going to be a knowing and seeing and watching the word vindicated the bride in the days of nehemiah heard the word and maybe at first it seemed to them to be a fearful thing and kind of disconcerting and it caused them to be sad but as it was rehearsed further they were told that this is their strength that the lord's joy his will his satisfaction his word is their strength lord i pray that we would as the bride of jesus christ recognize how satan's kingdom tries to use subtly ignorance is bliss and ignorance and strength to cause us to be bound by lies and contradictions but it's your word that liberates us sets us free so i pray lord that today in this in this gathering that that would be our takeaway that there's a word lord not even realizing now father just some of the things that were left out that this word wakes us up there's a voice that wakes us up there's a message that moves the amnesia there's a water that washes not only our souls but our spirits there's a word that is taking satan's agenda to sift us as wheat and is gonna separate us out as a person complete in redemption to be preserved body spirit and soul in eternity and i pray lord that we would not be distracted that we would stay attentive to the voice that we would stay focused upon the word and recognize that truth makes us free and that our joy is not connected with ignorance our joy is not in this as the bible even derides this simplicity this willful ignorance and this dumbing down lord may we avail ourselves to revelation and the stimulation of it may we seek you may we desire to know and to understand it i i know that may seem lofty and maybe just to think in terms of wow all the revealing of the word and the manifestation of god and the indictment and the crucifixion and all these different things lord it's the same language of repent and be baptized that must be done through an awareness and an acknowledgement the people on the day of pentecost were pricked in their hearts lord may the words still prick today and may we be faithful to walk in the word as it's made known to us bless your people today in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
