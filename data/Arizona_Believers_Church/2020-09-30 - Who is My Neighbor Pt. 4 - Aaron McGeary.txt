TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen if you could take your bibles i'd like to read in luke chapter 10 and we have been reading from that already through the last few services and i'd like to continue on the subject of who is my neighbor and we're drawing it from the question that is asked in verse 29 after the this lawyer had basically said that uh you know to love thy god with all thy heart and to love thy neighbor as thyself was what the law spoke to would be in terms of eternal life so then this is the part where that is the answer to the question i want to start with verse 30 as the question has been who is my neighbor and it says in jesus answering said luke chapter 10 verse 30 we'll read to verse 32 a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him he drew drew closer to him and stood over him and looked on him and it just seems to kind of aggravate the passage a little bit and pass by on the other side you could take your seats this evening we do want to commend you for your sacrifice to be here and the wonderful spirit that you're able to create create the atmosphere that you're able to create and welcoming the holy spirit and we're so glad to see all of you here we appreciate you very much i just got to jump right into it the good this parable of the good samaritan is an answer to the question who is my neighbor and in doing so jesus is rejecting the lawyer's assertion that only the jews were his neighbor because he supposed that if uh if loving a jew satisfies the commandment as loving the neighbor as thyself then he would say i'm blameless in the law then i have inherited eternal life but it's important i think this commits uh this parable speaks to us in so many different ways that our neighbors just not those who live next door to us our neighbors just not those that agree with us it's not just our family member it's not just message believers or people who believe the message exactly like you do but it extends to all mankind and all humanity and we were looking at this and considering this answer to the question who is my neighbor especially in light of the great commission to spread the gospel and it's important for us to consider who is my neighbor and what the answer is to that if we're going to fulfill the commission as to how does we spread the gospel or fulfilling the commission of spreading the gospel and then even how our actions impact that and we thought about it if someone was wanting to convert to heathen or reprobate a jew was wanting to bring somebody to believe the judaic faith but they were always mistreating them always oppressing them always offending them and then they began to talk about a one true god who required a particular way of worship and wanted to to make a convert or a proselyte to the jewish faith then they say man you're always busting my chops you're always being rude to me you're always mean you're always why would i want to join in in your religion why would i want to believe what you believe it's only made you angry and made you critical and so our actions and our attitude towards others impacts our ability to fulfill the commission which in mark chapter 16 verse 15 it says he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature so we have a commission each of us as individuals to spread the gospel to spread the light to be an example and to minister the word of god and in doing so that others might see the light others might be drawn to the truth and be converted to the truth in romans chapter 1 verses 14 to 16 paul says i am a debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians that would be a a crude race of people they're very rude and very harsh he says i'm a debtor to the greeks and the barbarians in other words i'm bound to them i have an obligation to them by my commission i'm called to them so i'm bound to them i'm not choosing who i would preach to and who i wouldn't i'm not choosing who's worthy of it and who's not but i'm bound to greeks and barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise so as much as is in me as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek paul sets this forth to say i'm not discriminating in terms of who i share the gospel with that i'm bound to greeks i'm bound to barbarians to the wise and the unwise and i'm ready to come and preach the gospel to you in rome he says i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ it is the power of god to everyone who believeth not just the jew but also the gentiles and so this is paul showing that his view his worldview the expanse of who he could minister to wasn't limited to those that he and his mind felt were the most qualified or the ones that he was most comfortable in ministering to but rather he was bound by his commission to preach the gospel to every creature and as i mentioned a moment ago it's important for us to consider how that our actions and our attitudes impact our ability to be a witness and our ability to help somebody in first timothy chapter 4 verse 12 he says let no man despise thy youth it struck me a little bit different way today that this is a very very young church a very young assembly uh having just started and and let no man despise that no let no man despise a new thing don't let someone despise uh even the smallness of it because we're living in a time where it says it should be it's a it's a day of small things it's a day when god's not doing great big works and souls are being harvested by the thousands but this is this don't despise the day of small things this is a time when god is refining his bride for a rapture and as he refines us we're more active in the things of christ we're we're better able to witness and to share the love of christ so it says let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers so though you would be despised don't let the despising impair your ability to minister the word of god to spread the truth as he's speaking to timothy he says now the anecdote to that is be an example someone despises you if someone criticizes you if someone's hard on you if someone wants to bring a bad name upon you just conduct yourself above it and be an example of the believers that's the answer to someone who despise you be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity and spirit in faith impurity so we must be examples of believers examples of the word that has been sent in this hour and it's in the things we say here when it speaks of conversation it's your manner of living the way that you conduct yourself in charity and spirit in faith and purity we are commissioned we are called to be an example of the word of god so our attitude towards people the way we treat people even how we would answer this question who is my neighbor is going to be an example of the believers now i'm wanting to by god's help go further in this parable as we've kind of been ministering around it on the front end and on the back end and maybe not get it into the specifics but tonight we want to start looking at some of the specific elements in the parable and explore the relationship among the characters that appear in this parable because there's more to examine than just the relationship between the victim and the samaritan there's more to look at and jesus uses languages very specific and examples and characters that would have got the people's attention in every circumstance in this parable is full of significance to those who heard it as jesus was near bethany even very near where this pathway may have been and there's a lot of significance and symbolism in that road and and different characters people would have known that would have traveled that way so every circumstance that jesus uses in this story has significance to those that he's speaking to and what i want you to do is instead of trying to time travel back to the days of jesus because that's impossible i want you just to make personal application of this for yourself and think well i want to put myself in the shoes of each one of these people because as we have read it already i'll just try to use some summary language here for time's sake but these are the characters that jesus refers to the individuals that uh that come up in this parable a certain man going down from jerusalem to jericho then you have thieves you have a certain priest you have a levite then you have a samaritan and you have a host and these are all the the characters and the groups of people that are mentioned in this story is a man who's going down from jerusalem to jericho you have a group of thieves then you have a priest then you have a levite the samaritan who's who is the good samaritan the one that the lawyer even says well that's the one who was neighbor to the one who was offended and then you even had the host of the inn who would have been there to take care of the one that was wounded once the samaritan left i wanted i want to start tonight well maybe just get through a couple of these characters and just look at each one and how we can relate to them and have personal application this the first one i want to look at is a certain man going down from jerusalem to jericho so jesus is referring to a notoriously dangerous path it's actually was called at that time the bloody way and we know from different teachings maybe even even sunday school that it was uh treacherous because there was thieves there were those that laid in weight and they had different bins and rocky curves and things that would have made it easy for people to prey on the helpless and so when jesus talks about this those who lived then would have immediately begin to think of all the different ways that this was a dangerous journey and then as it says a certain man and we understand what befalls him he can represent all mankind that has fallen in adam because in adam the bible tells us for as an adam all die and we know that through one man's sin entered into the world so in adam we have our representation in death and the journey of adam from a perfect garden in eden to a cursed earth can be seen in this man's path from jerusalem to jericho and jerusalem means peace it was a place of god's temple it was a place of the worship of the one true god it was beautifully situated and placed in the mountains and so this was the holy city this was the beautiful city this was a uh the place of peace and god's peace and then jericho even in christ's time was referred to as a cursed city it was regardless regarded as a wicked place so the journey of this man from a place of peace and beauty to jericho wicked place mankind could be included in this image that's brought up in this in this story and in that we can all identify with a certain man from jerusalem because the bible tells us that all have sinned and come short of the glory of god we weren't born in jerusalem we weren't born in the garden of eden but yet we find ourselves being born in a jericho as a fallen creature as a sinful man and so in that sense we can identify with this certain man who's on his path from jerusalem to jericho and then brother branham looks at this scripture in a little bit different sense and i think this is such a beautiful way that he places this and i'm going to read from three different places where he refers to this story he says jerusalem sets on a hill jericho sets in the valley and the good samaritan found a man coming from jerusalem down to jericho when he fell among thieves he says think of it he was backsliding so now he characterizes a certain man as backsliding coming from heavenly to the curse from the heavenly to the curse jericho was a cursed city jerusalem is a blessed city and he was on his road backsliding when he fell among thieves and robbers that stripped him and that's when you fall among thieves and robbers when you start backsliding away from god just expect the enemy to be along the road so that's a good way of placing this that if you begin to backslide and you're on your way from a place of blessing and a place of beauty on your way to a cursed city of jericho that's when you can expect to be taken advantage of that's when you can expect to be harmed and find yourselves stripped and fall among thieves and robbers so he's just he's kind of using in that way of warning and telling people that you're in a dangerous place when you're backsliding he says that again jericho is in the valley jerusalem is on the hill is did brother branham called tucson jerusalem and phoenix phoenix jericho is that how he referred to it oh well so he says jericho's in the valley jerusalem's on the hill and a man like we read of the good samaritan when he was coming down from jerusalem going to jericho he was backsliding coming out of the city of the blessed going down to the city of the cursed and that's when he fell among thieves and got stripped and wounded and laying half dead spiritually dead physically alive and that beautiful how a prophet takes this half dead and he says physically he's alive but spiritually he's dead and i imagine some of us can relate to that well we're just as healthy as we've ever been and physically we're alive but we feel a deadness spiritually and and this is the characterization of this one who's backsliding he may be physically alive but he's spiritually dead that's a and he takes that half dead to mean not that he's uh he's using that as a type that he's about to take his last last breath physically but he's pointing out in a spiritual sense you could be half dead spiritually dead and physically alive he says in another place too from jerusalem to jericho it showed he was backsliding he was going from up high going down low he was backsliding and he met him on the road and an enemy had beaten him and robbed him and left him half dead and he says it again physically alive spiritually dead so this is the way that brother branham identifies a type of this certain man going down from jerusalem to jericho he's saying this is one who would have had a spiritual experience or would have had a walk with god or some some sense of the divine and was in heavenly places and in a blessed position but then through circumstance he finds himself backslidden and he says physically alive but spiritually dead and it's in this sense that we don't want to be this man we could relate to him if we look at it in the sense of it represents humanity who's born in sin and we've all sinned and fallen short of the glory of god and president adam all men die and we could relate to that man in that sense but in the sense of being a backslider we don't want to be this man that being said we can still relate to this condition we can understand it brother branham calls him backslid that means in the scripture means back turning or to turn back or to turn away means to be turned and now when you look at what the word means in the old testament it means to be turned or driven back it means to be repulsed so in one sense if you say it means to turn back then one of their own volition of their own choosing of their own influence they decide to turn away and and turn back and that's backsliding but it can also mean to be driven back it can also mean to be repulsed so that it's not just you of your own accord in your own decision choosing to walk away or to go from jerusalem to jericho but it means something has acted upon you and caused you to be repulsed something in the name of jerusalem something in your experience something in a teaching something in your personal relationships something in life has war on you and cause you to be driven back and causes you to be repulsed so it's not always somebody who's just thumbing their nose at the message and someone thumbing their nose at holiness and someone's saying well that bible's just a bunch of tommy ron sometimes they're repulsed sometimes they're driven away sometimes they're stabbed and beaten and they're caused to fall away and backsliding is often misunderstood because you see a backslider and immediately you just put all the blame on them you just immediately castigate them and you cast them as dogs and you and you mistreat them and you say well good riddance they obviously didn't believe to begin with but we're not considering all the many factors that may work upon a soul to cause them to be discouraged allow their spirits to be broken and to fall from a heavenly place and end up in a very earthly condition backsliding is often misunderstood it says in jeremiah chapter 3 verse 22 return ye backsliding children and i will hear hear excuse me heal your backslidings isn't that beautiful that's usually not what we say to the backslider we usually just tell them well they've asked for it they deserved it it proves they're not elect and we have a whole bunch of choice sayings for them and sometimes we kind of throw out the serpent seed just very casually let's not do a disservice to the teaching of the original sin by using serpent seed is the nomination you give to everybody that doesn't believe or live like you it waters down the truth of it as a matter of fact it observates the truth it muddies it it keeps it harder to understand when you throw serpent seed around because then it makes it seem like there's a race of people that descend directly from cain upon the face of this earth when when when it was the the doctrine of the original sin is to help us to understand how satan interrupted the program of god and that all men require salvation and how that the grace of god in your life is by election and the reason why we can be born again is there's a seed inside of us to be quickened so it's not something you throw around as a criticism as an explanation why some people don't do some things that should be something we're very careful to utilize something we're not we don't throw around very easily it can be informative and instructive in a teaching to understand that there is a spiritual a numbness and a spiritual inability to understand the truth but that's not throwing around casually but here he's saying return ye backsliding children and i will heal your backslidings that means backsliding is a condition that can be recovered from when you backslide it doesn't mean you've lost the doors shut there's no way that you can be restored he's saying return come back and i will heal your backslidings he says behold we come unto thee for thou art the lord our god this is how god is to the backslider he welcomes them he encourages them he leaves the leaves a path back if you have a family member someone you love a co-worker anyone who seems to have turned their back on the message or walked away from truth or separated fellowship from you do everything you can to let them know that the path is clear for them to come back don't slam the door on them and say hey you know what you blew it buddy and slam the door because one day one day they're going to turn around and that path is closed that path is closed that path is closed they've got no way to come back to truth they've got no way to be prayed for they've got no way to find it and all of a sudden they realize there's somebody who kept the door open there's a path back i'll just text that brother i'll just call that sister i'll come back to that church because when i left they they kept the door open amen return you backsliding children and i will heal your backslidings and so this is this is the certain man going down from jerusalem to jericho he can represent the center he can also represent the backslider and then it says this certain man fell among thieves so let's just take a moment to ponder these thieves it's not one who steals by deceit but rather these were violent men it wasn't a pickpocket you know on that road who came and asked for directions and said ways is acting up i don't know which way to go uh can i borrow your phone and call for directions and then just by stealth or deceit pickpocketed the man coming down from jerusalem to jericho these were violent men the word thieves comes from the word to plunder they were robbers or free booters or pirates as you might say in more modern parlance and it was a which they were a gang that ambushed people that they would do them physical harm and take their belongings from them this is the group that uh that fell that grabbed a hold of this man and seized upon him so it says he fell among thieves they ambushed him they grabbed them and it was a group of people and i think it is instructive that it's characterized as a group and and because it's characterized as a group i believe it can be instructive to us as a church or as a group of people or a group of friends or associates as a group we don't ever want to be thieves we do not want to be a group of people that ever injure or rob somebody and you think well my goodness brother aaron what's your attitude towards people in the message anymore to think that they would hide in weight somewhere and then jump out and physically grab a hold of somebody steal their iphone and take their nice jordans and then run off and maybe just kind of give them the business a little bit while they're down on the ground no that i'm not saying that we would do it physically and if that was merely what i was trying to encourage you not to do is to physically harm somebody i think we could all leave saying i think i can do this gonna be a good week right and we'd feel pretty good i mean brother aaron said don't punch somebody in the face i can do it i can do it i can do it and who knows there might be one of us going oh man he found me out got to do good this week my co-workers are going to notice a difference but when there's other ways that you can injure and rob i want you to think very maturely about this how can i be how can i be challenged by this image of a group of thieves and how can i apply it to my life who i don't ever want to do to this certain man who came down from jerusalem to jericho i don't want to do to him spiritually what these men did physically to him because brother man looks at him completely different he says this is a man who was backslidden he was spiritually dead yet physically alive i don't want to be somebody who can spiritually deaden somebody i may not have the capacity just within my person and maybe with the weak stomach to punch somebody and bloody them and and make them hurt physically but what capacity do we have with our own lives and attitudes and judgments and behaviors to spiritually harm somebody and inflict them with grief notice how it says when he fell among thieves who injure him and rob him it says immediately that they stripped him of his clothing took away his raiment and laid him bare and he was naked and it struck me as i studied this that we should never take away something from somebody without offering something to them in replacement that we should never and maybe i thought about it this way you take away someone's covering someone's clothing that we should never take away from somebody their arraignment without offering them something else that they can dress themselves in and brother branham taught that religion is a covering and if we're not careful we can point out how that many people have a false religion and it's fig leaf religion and those are ideas of man and your belief system is wrong and the catholic church teaches this and pentecostals do this wrong and we can we can sit down with them and we can walk them through the word and we can be very quick to tear down their belief system and then depart because the scripture says that they let wounded him and and took his ramen and wounded him and then departed stripped him of everything he had the way he saw things the way that he lived and all of a sudden it's like oh now that i've proven you're wrong i'm just going to go ahead and depart we don't we don't uh witness and we don't share what we believe and we never strive just to make somebody fool us or expose them or do anything where we laid them bare and now exposed and naked walk off if you're going to take something away from somebody offer them truth in return do not destroy a person's convictions without offering true salvation through christ do not take away and lie from somebody or expose an error in someone's belief system without offering them truth i mean it and maybe this is a little bit of a dramatic example but perhaps it would drive the point home where you take somebody said oh so you baptized in titles huh hmm yeah well you do know that's wrong right what do you mean well i mean think about it three gods and you just completely riddle their belief system and they're like well what do i do it's like well you know maybe you should pick up a bible and read book of acts and you just kind of leave them in their sin you leave them and they're wondering that's what these thieves did very very good at destroying and tearing down but completely incapable of building up always quick to expose someone in their air but never able to offer them a way out of it and all of us can be very good spiritual thieves to strip someone of the arraignment and to rob them and then depart it says they who wounded him struck him with blows and we may never physically assault someone but our words can hurt our attitudes can hurt ostracizing people can hurt you know separating ourselves and making them feel uncomfortable and and there's many different ways that we can treat others to make them feel all alone and to wound them brother branham says in the message hebrews chapter 7 part 2 it says and you people with these saw blade tempers that's always spouting off in the mouth that somebody can't put up and things like that he says be careful now the reason why it's called a saw blade or a buzz saw is because it hurts it cuts it inflicts now and if you're thinking man brother aaron you didn't even wait a month before it got real well i feel like i'm with family tonight we can just be plain we can be honest it says people with these saw blade tempers he says be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right and he says you know don't go around and tear down it he says you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence break a man's character speak against his character wound his spirit kill his influence he says speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you might as well just shoot him shot him might as well shot him now listen that doesn't just go for pastors he said well whatever you do don't say something about the pastor i would say well whatever you do don't say something about nobody i mean let's not just shoot somebody say well at least he's not a pastor put in another clip brother get the automatic out he's not a pastor just riddle him full of bullet holes he's just using an example that if you would speak against your pastor say something bad about him you might as well just shot him but that would apply to anybody told something that wasn't right about him well it'll kill his influence with the people and things like that and you're guilty of it so he's identifying a way and i know this is very familiar to us how that we through criticism with through lies or through exaggerations and half truths or whatever they might be through our own temper say things about other people and in doing so he's saying it's tantamount to wounding them he says you might as well as kill them because you killed their influence he's saying it's practically murder shooting somebody and assaulting somebody but through your words when you say things that are harmful and wounding to them and that's another way that we should always be careful and put ourselves in the place of the thief how can we hurt how can we offend how can we tear down and i want to read a statement where brother bannon wrote in chapter 5 of the church age book and catch how the word characterizes those who would seek to harm someone he says already the false vine was turning loose its anger against the living god by killing the elect he says even as it did as did its forebear cain kill abel now brother branham even says it here and i maybe i'm just uh i'm just missing it here but i want to express this he says somebody with a temper and now he's saying the false vines turning loose it's anger anger a temper and anger do not always arise of our own actions of our own just a bitterness in our hearts that we have manufactured but we can be angry because we have been aggrieved it can be our own sense of justice and our own hurting and from a place of hurt and a place of being wounded that we lash out with our tongues and that does not justify shooting somebody that does not justify killing somebody so no matter how much we may be hurt or offended and in our offense have a temper or in our pain be angry notice how he characterizes this the false vine through its anger was lashing out against the living god by killing the elect he says the true church kept trying to get the first church to repent it would not do so it increased in size and influence it embarked upon a constant campaign to discredit the true seed they claimed that they and they alone were the true representatives of the lord jesus christ and vaunted the fact that they were the original church in rome and they alone were the first church and brother brahma says and hey they were but where was the leaven where was the discrepancy how is it that the first church was clearly indicating that they weren't the church of god it wasn't in that they were second or that they were that they were third but it was in their attitude towards the other church the false vine was turning loose its anger against the living god by killing the elect they had embarked on a constant campaign to discredit somebody else whereabouts put in the context of the true seat listen if you embark on any campaign to merely discredit somebody else be careful who you're campaigning for even if you say well i'm just campaigning against false seed well they that the truth or the first church didn't think they were campaigning against the elect as we pointed out last time brother brown says that bride will not persecute bride why is that because bride don't persecute anybody that that's what that's part of the bride's characteristic and so there's different ways i'm just kind of going through this on a surface level just laying some principles out there for us to consider there's different ways that we can personally challenge ourselves with this image of a thief laying hold of a man and robbing him and and letting him bare or wounding him we could see how it applied to a group of thieves and even us individually how we use our words whether it be a buzz saw temper things that we say against a person's character or or being driven uh to discredit and to tear down these are all marks and characteristics of thieves and you don't want to be a thief and then to take this further to challenge ourselves in viewing these thieves it said they departed leaving him half dead let me challenge us with this if we have harmed anyone we should never become indifferent about it if someone says that hurt we should not um automatically engage in some kind of uh process of evaluating with just how much force did we hit them with and then say well you're just a big if that hurt and it was i'm not willing to acknowledge your offense i'm not willing to try to even affirm that it's that it's understandable that you would be hurt you just immediately try to justify your actions well how could you say that hurt there was nothing to that you need thicker skin or you should have ducked or you should have known i was going to hit you but instead if we have offended somebody we have harmed somebody we should never be indifferent or quick to justify ourselves if we have hurt somebody whether intentionally or unintentionally it is necessary as christians to make it right if you have hurt somebody whether by uh uh with intent or without intent it is necessary it's incumbent upon us in the scripture to make things right jesus says it this way matthew chapter 5 verses 21 to 24 he says you have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment now recall just a moment ago how brother branham said that you might as well shoot a man if you speak said something bad about him and that you kill his influence break his character and you kill him so we could use this as an application thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment then jesus actually makes the same connection that brother branham made because he says but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa which would have been an insult in them at that time call him a or something shall be in danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou sh thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire notice how it's saying if you call someone a dimwit you call somebody uh stupid or something he's actually saying those words place you in the same position as one who would actually take another man's life this is jesus really raising the standard it's really would be causing the jews at that time to think man we knew that if a man killed somebody he's in danger of judgment now jesus says if you're just mad at your brother and you don't have a reason for it you don't have just cause and you hold bitterness and animosity against him without cause you're in danger of judgment and i say if you call somebody raqqa or a you're in danger of the council and i say if you say somebody that they're full you're in danger of hell fire he's magnified he's amplified the law he's put them all on notice you don't have to take a man's life to put yourself in a precarious position of being judged by the word so then he takes it to this if you think as far as being angry with your brother saying unto him raqqa or saying fool he says therefore verse 23 therefore thou bring thy gift to the altar and there remembers that thy brother hath ought against thee that means that you have wronged him you have harmed him he has caused to be offended by your words or by your conduct if you remember maybe we could read it this way if you remember that you have heard or harmed your brother he says leave there thy gift before the altar go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift this is very heavy the jews believed that if they stole from their neighbors they had to make it right before making an offering so if i stole something from you i took your lamb when you weren't looking i i took your shovel since you wouldn't let me borrow it and i stole it then before i make an offering before i would worship god i'd say oh i stole i need to go give them back what i stole their physical possession before i can make an offering but now jesus is expanding this to include any offense to a person whether by word or deed he's expanded it now to where it's not just if you stole something from somebody but you speak against somebody or you you use words of ridicule or you're just angry at them without cause he's expanded it to say listen if you have injured or offended anyone whether physically or emotionally before you make your offering go to that one and make it right if a person has any just reason to complain because of injury or offense on your part and in particular as he describes it in verses 21 and 22 he's saying leave your gift at the altar go to them and be reconciled that means settle the difficulty make a proper acknowledgement of the offense and then satisfy the satisfaction of the injury you acknowledge i've wronged i acknowledge that i've hurt and you make amends one commentator wrote it this way if you have wronged him make restitution if you owe him a debt which ought to be paid pay it if you've injured his character confess it and seek pardon if he's under an erroneous impression if your conduct has been such is to lead him to suspect that you've injured him make an explanation do all in your power and all you ought to do to have the matter settled not beautiful that even if there's some reason that he thinks wrong about your character but it's been your conduct that would lead him to be suspicious then make explanation do all in your powers you ought to do to make the matter settled settle the difficulty and sure it's these it's easy to say right but sometimes you have to be willing to face the hurricane you have to be willing to face the storm subject yourself to the to the anger but if you've done something wrong you've got to acknowledge it and then satisfy it it's our duty to make things right when we've injured others and this is where jesus places it now think of how this turns things around we think oh i was born to serve god and to worship and praise and go to church and throw my hands in the air just give myself to him give myself away jesus says it's our duty to make it right when we've injured someone even before we worship god that's the exact way that he places it if you've heard somebody before you make your offering to god go be reconciled with your brother before you even try to worship and christ is showing that god will not accept a man's worship unless he is made right to with the person that he has offended in order to worship god correctly this would apply maybe just not so much in an instance of bringing worship but in order to worship god correctly we must do justice to others and seek reconciliation we've hurt or offended somebody this i could say that we realize don't be a thief we don't want to be a backslider but as we look at this group of thieves it's instructive to us to say don't be a thief a christian is not one that injures any man therefore we should never seek to rob to harm or deprive any man not just to physical goods but even in spiritual senses the bible says in john chapter 10 verse 1 verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door and to the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber i want to use it in a unique way we could say that he that does not come through christ and through the door of the sheephold we can realize he's not sheep but he's a thief and a robber perhaps he's coming to rob he's coming to be a thief he's coming to destroy the flock but rather someone who has not come through christ is characterized as a thief and a robber and we are not thieves we are sheep but when we behave as thieves that's when we're hypocritical that's when we're not acting in character a thief and a robber is one who has not come through christ it's one who has not experienced his grace and forgiveness of sins and we as sheep have the capacity and we have the ability to work past hurts or offenses and allow our emotions to come in harmony with the word of god and not lash out not be angry not have a saw temper and not be thieves and robbers in our own way because sheep are not characterized with that nature so i say don't be a thief you can go put it on instagram ma'am brother i heard preach tonight his point was don't be a thief i guess a hashtag winning i don't know you feel like i don't feel like i'm a thief but there's so many different ways we can be thieves as we're looking at this a certain man who came down from jerusalem and fell among thieves now he's there wounded naked half dead verse 31 it says and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place now now it says the levite came and looked on him there's different ways that you could imagine the priest walking by and sees this horrible scene and he's like oh you know what that looks like something that i could be justified in the law not touching i don't want to get dirty i don't want to marry my testimony i'm just going to keep on going the levite actually goes and stands over him maybe he kind of kicked him a little bit they saw if there was anything left did they take it all okay but he goes and stands over the man he looks on him and pass by on the other side now think of these two two people a priest he was one who offers sacrifices in the temple he's the one that would busy himself with the sacrificial rights he's one that's actually administering the sacrifices placing them upon the altar this is one that is is not just merely an attendant but he would be offering sacrifices on behalf of the people to god he was the priest who fulfilled that order in the law for the people and then a levite he was an assistant to the priest he would have kept the temple clean and the utensils clean he would open and shut the gates of the temple he would actually may have been one who sang the hymns in the temple that's what the levites did if they did not enter into the priesthood they still served within the temple and they sang hymns or they cleaned utensils and they kept the they kept the temple clean they were the assistants and it's possible that jesus refers to the priest and the levites because of the their call to duty and they're called to service they may have been the ones that most frequently traveled that road from jerusalem to uh to jericho or perhaps he used them to make a point that these two the priest and the levite by nature of their office were obligated to show mercy to the one who was injured there was just another common man that walked by him i thought well i mean he could have done better but rather jesus was trying to draw this contrast that the priest who would have had a duty under the law the levite who would have had a a life of service dedicated to serving in the temple the priest offered sacrifices on behalf of the people the levites offered a service to the priests to make sure the sacrifices were administered they by their very names were people who were given to serve and were obligated to show mercy to that man who was hurt in other words a person in need a person in this condition that this certain man was in would have had the right to expect immediate help from these two types of people if he was laying there and able to see he might have seen a traveler go by and thought well he he won't help me but then maybe he sees a priest and something leaps in his heart this is a man who would not only you think have a heart to do it but would be obligated by the law and then he passes on by maybe in his condition being half dead he sees the levite he's like oh the priest passed but now here's somebody who'll have compassion and as he lays there the levite begins to walk closer he thinks yes he's under the duty he's under an obligation of all the people that have passed this is the one that i could expect to help me but as he comes up he just looks over him and walks away again and this certain man of everyone who passed by that way would have expected these to stop but their failure to stop and comfort this man who was wounded was a clear breach of the law that they were called to observe even more we could say than any other jew as a priest and a levite they were bound to it they were characterized by it and yet they shirked their duty under the law for whatever thought process they went through they ended up passing by and and i'm going to just i'm going to leave it leave the description there for now and maybe go into it a little bit more but i just want to change the corner just kind of turn it and try to start wrapping this up and ask what about us are we not likewise by nature of our calling obligated to show kindness to somebody who's hurting are we not also expected by nature of our own confession to show mercy to someone who's to be pitied who has been wronged or harmed we're not called to aggravate their pain we're not called to rub it in we're not called to to walk by the man who's beaten and bloodied on the bloody path on the way backsliding from jerusalem to jericho and say looks like you got what you deserved buddy and to keep the the condemnation on them and leave them in their pain so then i want you to consider and i and i i'm sowing this by divine inspiration into the foundation of this church what is your reflex towards the backslider what is your instinctive attitude towards those that fall away do we pass by and so i say to you tonight don't be a priest don't be a levite definitely we you don't want to be a thief you don't want to be a backslider you don't want to be a thief but in this don't be a priest either don't be a levite notice what the scripture says because brother braham is the one that characterizes a certain man who went down from jerusalem to jericho he's the one that characterizes him as a backslider in james chapter 5 verses 19 to 20 says brethren if any man do air from the truth and one convert him now this is not a second conversion in order for him to err from the truth he's the very language that's used is here's one who's been walking in the faith one who's fellowshipped among you one who's had a confession maybe even had an experience or a testimony and he begins to vary from that way he says if one convert him not his first conversion but to restore him from his backsliding remember backsliding could be one turning away or one pushed away it says convert him let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the air of his ways shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins james is telling these this church telling these people labor to restore those that have fallen that's the hard part right that's when you really have to roll up your sleeves that's when you begin to examine your own selves and consider your own selves that's when you need to be meek and in the fear of god restore such one he said we should labor to restore those that have fallen one summer is everyone ought to seek the salvation of everyone and not have these prejudices and biases and all these things that we immediately use to apply to every situation well that's that's outside of my expertise but labor to restore one that has fallen to convert means to bring back from wandering so it's not the first conversion of a sinner necessarily though that clearly has application to convert means to re-establish in the truth to turn from the air of his way do you realize the beautiful grace that's expected expressed in this just as we read in the beginning you backslidden children return i will heal your backslidings it's saying that if someone has backslid we don't slam the door we make sure the door stays open you don't shove them on the way out you don't say well let me let me help you get further down the road let me buy you some good running shoes whenever you see someone running away you lace your running shoes on you you lace them up tight you get ready for to chase after him you get ready for the return get ready for the rebound get ready to catch them if you can because it says reestablishing the truth turn away from is there all what a grace that is expressed to us maybe not us who are spiritual but us who backslid to us who have wondered those who've made mistakes what a grace that's expressed the bible doesn't castigate you the bible doesn't say there's no way back the bible's actually instructing to those who've held fast don't forget your brethren that have wandered off what a grace what a grace brother jason you could relate to as one being dead amen there's a brother here visiting from michigan it goes to my father-in-law's church and i say father-in-law's also one of my best friends he's a he's a father to me brother john martin he brother jason goes to to his church here's a man that was dead and raised from the dead physically dead three times that's a good number and he could testify not just being raised from the dead physically but spiritually what a grace to somebody that we can testify to anyone whether they're well you maybe can't testify if they're physically dead but you have a testimony god raises the dead amen and then we all can testify that god raises the spiritually dead we were all dead in sins and trespasses all of us here tonight who have spiritual life can at one time say i was dead but now i am alive i have been quickened and we don't turn our nose as it were or look down upon anybody who's spiritually dead or somebody who's wondered he calls them the wandering but we realize i can be commissioned if it's just pray just hold the door open let me be one who has a burden for those who have followed that they can be restored back to truth from a position of strength we forgot that we were sons and daughters of god we forgot that our position was secure in the kingdom and that it does not diminish the glory of the bride if she prays for the backslider if she reaches out to the sinner our glory is not diminished it shines even brighter because it's not carnally manufactured listen to how it's said in isaiah all this is so wonderful isaiah chapter 58 verses 6 to 8 is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke make this part of your divine commission to loose bands of wickedness undo heavy burdens let the oppressed go free break every yoke is it not to deal thy bread now because we we all are participating in this now deal vibrate give thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to the house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh from your own mankind your own associates your own family don't hide yourself don't pass by as the priest did not as if we were to even attribute this characteristic to god to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens to let the oppressed go free he then brings us into this very ministry if it's god that does that now he begins to tell us how that the bands of wickedness are loose how heavy burns are undone how the oppressed go free how every yoke is broken it is for you to deal by bread to the hungry it is for you to bring the poor that are cast out into the house when you see someone naked cover them and don't hide yourself from your own flesh that is how god looses the bands of wickedness that is how those who are laden with heavy burdens are undone that is how the oppressed goes free when you live the life that you ought to live amen oh and i love this verse 8 then shall thy light break forth as the morning when are you shining brightest when when when you when you're acknowledging that we're the elect and and it not everyone can see this and and the message is only for those who ordained to it when do we shine our brightest when we gather to ourselves and pat ourselves on the back or when the poor who've been cast out are invited to the house of the lord amen when do we when do we shine the brightest when we're hoarding the bread that we've received or when we give it out to the hungry when do we shine the brightest when we wear the glorious raiment and the garbs of this gospel or when we're willing to cover the one that is naked the bible says then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily you might think brother aaron this isn't really deep i could go get this in a baptist church well okay all right but if you want to go in a rapture don't think you're going to get there by being selfish and not living for others the bible says thine health shall spring forth speedily your physical health can be improved by living for others your spiritual health will be improved by living for others then will your light break forth as the morning thy health shall spring forth speedly and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the lord shall be thy reward do you desire more glory glory then you humble yourself to break yolks you humble yourself to loose bands of weakness you humble yourself to undue burdens i will deal my bread to the hungry i will bring the poor that are cast out to my house i will cover the naked i will as james said do my part to minister to the wandering or using the figure the attitude of the priest and the levites the levite to this backslider and i want to close i i i have maybe almost a a lot more here but i i may close with just this last statement i want to read brother branham and if you could could you just uh maybe quiet yourselves for a moment and ponder this i was so moved by this i i want i want you to just focus now i'm going to read an interaction between brother branham and a young man and it's in a prayer line in 1954. and he says young fella if you come here just a minute a little closer to me if you will i suppose that we're strangers are we together i don't know you i guess this is our first time meeting in life but you realize that the very god of heaven and whose presence we're standing now will judge us both some of these days for what we have done and the way that we've treated his message and his son what what's sobering words and with trembling fear to stand in his presence that's how i stand here tonight wondering what he'll say it that day that's very humble on his part there's no arrogance being projected he's actually created this image with this young fella if he catches what brother brad is saying he's saying you may look at me as if i'm a great man on this platform and people think i'm a prophet i've got a dynamic gift and the dead are raised and hands are laid on them but one day we'll both stand shoulder to shoulder and be judged the same way don't think i'm any greater than you but i even though you might think that i'm a minister of the gospel and i'm more important but one day we'll stand shoulder to shoulder before god and i'll tremble in fear just as any man will and wonder what he'll say at that day what a grace to take a young fellow and say why don't you stand with me for a moment in the presence of god not leave him out there wherever he might have been and be the one who in the presence of god who reaches out from the presence of god with the voice of judgment but rather he takes the man who's standing there in need and he stands with them in the presence of god and then he says there's something strange about you i don't know but there's something somewhere that's not just exactly right it keeps turning black all around you and moving away every time i go to meet your spirit it moves back for some cause i don't know the audience will bear me record of this that there's something somewhere that i can't understand that god keeps pulling me back from you all the time and there's something somewhere that certainly he stops says jesus christ the son of god whose spirit is present to do all things and do all things well he says you are in trouble that's what the blackness is it's a trouble and it's not you it's in your home it's domestic it's your wife she's left you i've seen that blackness go away and it was your wife a woman that was once to your side has pulled away standing in blackness and that's what it is and here's another thing in this you have lost out your experience with christ now if i could emphasize this for a moment my voice is louder than brother branham's was i'm projecting prayer because of the room but i'm just talking to this man with a very gentle gentle voice you lost out your experience with christ you've backslid and went back on god now i want you to imagine that here's a man who's backslid and think of the indignation think of the fury think of the disappointment think of all the choice words that could be said but remember that backslid it can mean to be repulsed and here's a man who through his hurt his wife once at his side is pulled away and he says and you've lost out your experience with christ you've backslid and went back on god and then brother bear says come here brother he says just come closer don't i don't want you to be to sense any alienation i don't want you to feel distant from me the man of god so he says come here brother come closer maybe to embrace to take a hold of his shoulders to begin to lay upon him and pray for him and then he says kind heavenly father be kind and merciful and may thy spirit be upon this poor dear man your wandering prodigal what a sweet prayer sister elizabeth if you could come he says may he come tonight to the father's house and may he the father supply all and restore to him a double portion granted lord i send him on down the road now to meet you lord in the name of jesus christ amen and he says god bless you boy he says go home now throw all your habits and things away back in the sea of forgetfulness your sins are forgiven and now go and god will move and work with you he says god bless you my brother so glad these things were preserved so i could hear how a righteous man eyed the backslider how a righteous man could look upon somebody who wants to walk with god but now lost out their experience with christ backslid and went back on god and in that very moment where the blackness that was in his wife that caused her to leave him and this man through his own hurt has now also walked away and instead of brother branham saying you should have known better it proves that you didn't have an experience to begin with just because your wife went and played the part of the don't you realize you should have stood faithful that's where you made the mistake you wouldn't be standing here today buddy if you just would have sucked it up when she left it was nothing but a woman anyways where's your conviction where's your genuine experience instead of him doing that he says come here come here and he says kind heavenly father be merciful calls him a poor dear man he says your wandering prodigal what a different attitude we could have if we see somebody backsliding instead of them just leaving them to satan say lord is that your wandering prodigal brother adam in the sermon testimony is a man that stands before him and he says you look this way and he keeps telling the man to look at him i'll point it out as we go he says if you would look this way sir if you would just a moment now you realize my dear brother that when you confess your faith in christ it says to believe now with all your heart do you you do with all your heart and you have no doubt but the spirit that is here now that's even on you now there's no doubt but that it's the spirit of god it could not be any psychological effect or he's feeling sensing something supernatural it's just the spirit of god you see yes you believe with all your heart well you live close do you in this city here i would say he was i want you just to look again when you read through this you hear it it's as if the man's eyes keep wondering he says yes sir brother you have trouble with arthritis it's what bothers you isn't that right i see the way you get around i want you just to look this way and be just as sincere as you can and it struck me the fact that he had to keep getting this man to look at brother branham you realize there was some sense of shame in this man's heart that he couldn't even look at the man of god and he kept kind of looking away and and maybe his mind is drifting back to something else and i i found myself just entering into what this man must have felt in that moment and the burban says life hasn't been a flower bed of ease for you has it brother now i thought it was arthritis but now he says you've had lots of sorrows lots of troubles you're in trouble right now brother isn't that right at one time you wouldn't have come up in this prayer line you were an unbeliever once very much critical of religion is that right you did a great thing along that one time too something that hurt you i believed you rebuked god or cursed god or something and done something wrong didn't you do that how would you think brother by the spirit of god he goes is that a tract concerning it and brother branham was able to point out that this man had a tract on his person and if you read in a few paragraphs down i don't have time to do it tonight it said something along these lines if there's a god i curse him he says all right now concerning that it harmed you being that you had that on tracks he says again then look this way he says believeth all your heart you dearly paid for that brother you've had lots of troubles now nervous you've had lots of home troubles too don't you domestic troubles with your home is that right will you believe me as god's servant it's all right for me to speak what the lord says you've had other troubles too sexual troubles is that right sexual troubles says you listen to what i mean nobody but god alone knows that better than you is that right now what would your attitude be towards a man who wrote a track saying if there was a god i curse him who passed it out who has home trouble domestic troubles sexual troubles what would your response be what what how would the prophet now in this setting how would he approach this spirit and we would say oh it's got to rise up an indication has to rise up this is going to be the loudest prayer this is going to be the most forceful of laying hands on somebody this is the point when you get just as close as you can to beating the devil out of somebody as you ever do as a preacher and he says you believe me with all your heart he says let me have your hand let's bow our heads and he just brother bam says in this most sweetest way our heavenly father there's nothing but what you know all about him i'm so thankful that you're here tonight this poor old brother having to run and slip away to get to the service he says but loves you in his heart god make a way for him granted lord he's in trouble you said that you would be near those who are in need god bless my brother now as i bless him in thy name may all these troubles clear up like a cloud leaving from before the sun what humility what grace and may he be healed tonight of his arthritis and all these other troubles lord and be made new and whole again in the name of jesus christ the son of god i ask it now that's how brother branham dealt with really nasty cases a backsliders and even enemies of the cross and i think it speaks of how god deals with us in our weakness we can all relate that when we thought we really were going to get it god dealt with us kindly i was pondering it today and not to get too far into maybe some of these other characters but what was it the samaritan saw in this man that the priest and levite didn't and i thought what did he what did god see in me that nobody else could we see people sometimes as three-time failures in and out and we think oh they're used up but that samaritan saw something that nobody else saw that day and god sees something in you that maybe you don't even see yourself and his attitude isn't vengeance his attitude isn't one of punishment but it's remedial he wants to recover you he wants to restore you and i believe that ought to be our attitude too we can't sit back with arms folded with a critical eye towards everybody and then just say well god you got to do something we got to be the ones that unfold our arms roll up our sleeves and say lord if it would be me use me let's stand to our feet i want to just say a prayer and then my wife will sing a song and maybe if you know the song you could express it to but let's bow our heads in a word of prayer is there a is there anyone here that we can relate to a certain man that went down from jerusalem to jericho and you would just express tonight lord just see me in my need more i need the samaritan to come by tonight i need him to touch me in my pain and in my weakness maybe you can identify as a thief and you say oh lord forgive me where i've robbed and where i've harmed and departed you can identify as the priest or the leave i say lord forgive me ford forgive me whoever it is you could relate with tonight and would ask god to come to your aid or to forgive you i encourage you to do so now our gracious heavenly father lord we stand in your divine presence just as your prophet described a young man [Music] as not merely being a mortal which was beneath him or below him but he took him and brought him into the very presence of christ he said we'll stand together in judgment as equals [Music] lord we now bring ourselves before you having been examined by the word and we pray that you would forgive us of the wrongs that we have committed lord that you would forgive us of the any offense or any wound or any hurt lord if we've played the part of the thief we ask that you forgive us we played the part of the priest of the levite and passed on by lord we ask that you would forgive us tonight lord if we're that wounded man we say come to our aid tonight lord and i pray father as brother branham prayed for that young fellow in this backslidden condition and this man who had become an enemy to the cross lord i pray that you would likewise show your love to them and you would soothe their hurts lord by the power of god chase away the clouds as a storm leaving before the sun lord would you be merciful unto them father your wandering prodigals lord help us also then to be ones who have a burden for the lost and hurting that we would not turn them away in judgment but rather welcome them in compassion father i pray for each of us tonight that you would touch us our wounded spirits lord our hurting hearts lord touch our bodies that are sick and we gain instruction from this lord that that when we can lose somebody else's pain and burden lord and minister to someone else in need then we can spiritually be healed quickly it says then will our healing come may we participate in that and experience it committed to you now father asking your blessing upon the people in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
