[0:00] Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 God who at
[0:03] sundry times in a diverse manner spake
[0:05] in time past unto the fathers by the
[0:07] prophets half of these last days spoken
[0:10] on us by his son whom he hath appointed
[0:12] heir of All Things by whom also he made
[0:15] the worlds who be in the brightness of
[0:18] his glory and the express image of his
[0:21] person and upholding All Things by the
[0:23] word of his power when he had made had
[0:25] by himself purged our sins sat down on
[0:27] the right hand of the Majesty on high
[0:29] being made so much better than the
[0:31] angels as he have by inheritance
[0:34] attained a more excellent Name than they
[0:37] amen God bless you could be seated
[0:40] I'm gonna just jump right back into
[0:42] where we were on Sunday and just kind of
[0:44] looking out over the audience tonight of
[0:46] confident that most of you if not all of
[0:49] you uh were a part of that service and
[0:51] know where we were at and we're looking
[0:53] at the uh subject of character
[0:55] expression we looked into uh character
[0:58] in the scripture and expression a little
[1:00] bit but we're looking at the order and
[1:02] the character of the Kingdom how that we
[1:05] are manifesting the life of God and in
[1:08] manifesting the life we want to be very
[1:11] focused on fulfilling his will or
[1:13] fulfilling his purpose brother Brandon
[1:15] preaches trying to do God of service
[1:17] without it being his will shows us that
[1:19] there's a lot of things that we could
[1:20] try to do and accomplish works that we
[1:22] could try to manifest but yet if it's
[1:24] not his will if it's not his order if
[1:26] it's not his time if you're not his
[1:27] person there's a lot of ways we can get
[1:29] ourselves in trouble and so what we want
[1:31] to do is fulfill his purpose God
[1:33] whatever purpose you have for me I want
[1:35] to fulfill it whatever your will is in
[1:37] my life I want to fulfill it and as
[1:39] we're looking at Hebrews chapter after
[1:41] one we're looking at Jesus Christ the
[1:43] son of God who God was the climax of all
[1:46] the types and shadows of the prophets
[1:48] and he's saying that in this last days
[1:51] he hath spoken by his son Jesus
[1:53] and then he describes him this way
[1:55] saying who be in the brightness of his
[1:57] glory
[1:58] and the express image of his person I
[2:01] meditate on that phrase in your own
[2:03] devotional time in your prayer time on
[2:05] the brightness of his glory that there
[2:07] was this is something this is quite a
[2:09] heavy phrase to me who being the
[2:11] brightness of his glory he Christ was
[2:13] the brightness of the glory of God and
[2:16] he says the express image of his person
[2:18] and that word express images the
[2:21] character he was the character of God so
[2:24] in Christ it was manifested these
[2:26] defining qualities or features of God
[2:29] they're expressed and made manifest in
[2:31] Jesus Christ and so in Christ we could
[2:34] say there was the sum of these qualities
[2:36] that Define who God is that would uh
[2:39] there's a manifestation in Jesus Christ
[2:41] that would distinguish in him from all
[2:43] the other prophets distinguishing him
[2:46] from anybody else so character is a
[2:48] distinguishing characteristic it is a a
[2:50] defining quality and brother Branham
[2:53] says the character excuse me the concept
[2:55] of God was expressed in Jesus so it's
[2:59] something that embodies God who he is
[3:00] his desires his motives and his
[3:02] objectives he said God became expressed
[3:05] in the person of Jesus Christ and we're
[3:08] drawing this phrase from the church age
[3:09] book Jesus Christ was God expressing
[3:12] himself in man to man
[3:15] so it was God in the man Christ Jesus
[3:17] but God just did not want to indwell
[3:20] Christ but he wanted to manifest himself
[3:22] through Christ to men to humanity
[3:26] in the sermon identification he said God
[3:28] came down and the character of God was
[3:31] Christ the very character of God is
[3:34] Christ this is the character expression
[3:37] that God was just not Christ wasn't just
[3:39] doing things that were Godlike or he
[3:41] wasn't just doing things that made us
[3:43] think about God or hearken to things God
[3:45] had done before but he was actually the
[3:47] character of God expressed he was the
[3:50] reflection brother Brahm says he was God
[3:52] made visible he says again God made
[3:54] visible so this is Jesus Christ the son
[3:57] of God he is the very character of God
[3:59] expressed and then Romans 8 29 says for
[4:03] whom he did for no so now this puts
[4:05] something in the mind of God or the
[4:06] heart of God being foreknown by God we
[4:09] are predestinated brother Graham takes
[4:11] from schofield's notes and says election
[4:13] looks back to foreknowledge
[4:15] predestination looks to Destiny and so
[4:17] here whom he did for no he's elected but
[4:20] then he also did predestinate to be
[4:22] conformed to the image of his son that
[4:26] he might be the firstborn among many
[4:28] Brethren if Jesus Christ was the
[4:31] character of God or he was God in man
[4:34] expressing himself to man Paul is using
[4:37] the same language to say that we too are
[4:40] predestinated to be conformed and
[4:43] transformed into this character that
[4:45] would also declare Jesus Christ or
[4:48] declare God who he is so we are
[4:50] predestinated to be another Express
[4:52] image a reflection of God's character
[4:55] there must be in our lives something
[4:58] divine
[4:59] there must be a deity that's expressed
[5:02] in our lives and and unless it is him in
[5:05] us then everything else is an
[5:06] impersonation so we have to have that
[5:09] deity in flesh in John Chapter 14 verse
[5:12] 12
[5:14] this is this is still kind of part of
[5:17] the review and then I'm going to read
[5:18] from time tested memorials and I think
[5:20] that's when we're taking a step further
[5:22] to finish some things we didn't get to
[5:23] on Sunday it says verily verily I say
[5:25] unto you he that believeth on me the
[5:28] works that I do shall he do also
[5:31] in Greater Works than thee shall he do
[5:34] because I go unto my father
[5:36] it's interesting when Jesus says this
[5:38] that there's not necessarily any list of
[5:41] works that he does
[5:44] it would be nice if he said he that
[5:46] believeth on me he will do a he give us
[5:48] a bucket list right or give us a to-do
[5:50] list it's always good when you have a
[5:52] list what do I need to do today and it's
[5:53] just kind of all charted out there so
[5:55] that I could do it Jesus remains I I
[5:58] don't want to say mysterious but he's
[6:00] just saying the works that I do shall he
[6:01] do also and we'd say well then what
[6:03] works are though is it walk on water
[6:06] is it is it multiply the bread and the
[6:10] fish is that is are those the works that
[6:11] we're to do also are we to die on a
[6:14] cross are we to be born in a manger
[6:15] there's there's things we might begin to
[6:17] ask ourselves well what are these works
[6:19] because if I believe I want to do these
[6:21] same works and then he says Greater
[6:23] Works than these shall he do because I
[6:25] go unto my father
[6:26] now I I'm just saying it that way so we
[6:28] can think about it
[6:30] and then if I could express it this way
[6:33] not to get into the details of what
[6:36] these works are but to get to the heart
[6:39] uh what would be at the heart of those
[6:41] works because brother Bram says God is
[6:43] featured in character
[6:46] that that and when he uses that phrase
[6:49] character to to me and brother bam talks
[6:52] about character in that positive sense
[6:53] and christ-like character and and having
[6:56] the right kind of character and
[6:57] character being molded I believe he's
[6:59] talking about an Excellence a moral
[7:01] Excellence an uprightness and integrity
[7:03] uh a righteousness to be as we ought to
[7:06] be and that's where God is featured he's
[7:09] featured in that in that in that a
[7:11] person's character
[7:12] and then he says that God shows his
[7:15] character by his works so so now we're
[7:18] going to be chasing our Tails a little
[7:19] bit right
[7:20] yes it's the works it's the works it's
[7:22] the character but then it's the
[7:23] character that is known by works Billy
[7:26] Bram says in time tested Memorials of
[7:28] God a man's character is made known by
[7:30] his works
[7:31] so when Jesus says the works that I do
[7:33] shall you do also and greater work shall
[7:35] you do there Therefore your Works will
[7:38] declare your character and God is
[7:40] featured in character and and it is to
[7:42] be to be conformed to his image is to be
[7:45] conformed to his character so there's
[7:47] first things first and then there's the
[7:48] byproduct of that I reminded of uh
[7:51] brother uh Bruce who worked at a nuclear
[7:54] plant and he said that what he produced
[7:57] in his ways we produce nuclear waste and
[8:00] Energy's the byproduct and sometimes
[8:02] people have it the other way around we
[8:04] produce energy but nuclear waste is the
[8:06] byproduct but no he's saying no we
[8:08] produce waste and we get energy out of
[8:09] it and now however you want to look at
[8:12] this there's got to be the character
[8:13] there and it's the character that's got
[8:15] to be producing the works whatever they
[8:17] might be so one is the byproduct not not
[8:20] at the beginning well I've got I'm doing
[8:21] the works therefore I've got character
[8:23] but no it's got to start somewhere
[8:25] and so a man's character is known by his
[8:28] works whatever you are your Works prove
[8:30] what you are and another place to
[8:32] believe by the ram says your life molds
[8:34] your character and and to me that
[8:36] expresses the image of what I say and
[8:37] what I do is is painting a picture it's
[8:40] erecting a statue or a stature to tell
[8:42] what's on the inside no matter how much
[8:44] you testify whatever you say Pro or con
[8:46] that has nothing to do with it your
[8:49] Works tell what you are tell us what you
[8:51] are inside
[8:54] now if you could kind of grab a hold of
[8:55] this for some of the practicality that
[8:57] we see in this every job that you do
[8:59] manifest what you are
[9:01] this ought to inspire us even as young
[9:02] men and and how we labor and what we do
[9:05] to do it right he says and you
[9:07] businessmen if you just do a patch up
[9:08] job see what I mean just a halfway job
[9:10] don't do that you can't do it right
[9:12] don't do it at all
[9:14] he's a very character of a person is
[9:17] made known in the works that they do and
[9:19] could you imagine us trying to Parrot
[9:21] all these accolades to God and his word
[9:23] and to the message of the hour and the
[9:25] power of God in all the great things
[9:27] that he can do but then we don't do
[9:29] things the right way even in our own
[9:31] personal lives and in in the way that we
[9:33] treat one another and the jobs that we
[9:35] we undertake he's saying this is part of
[9:37] one's character a man's character is
[9:40] made known by his works and in fact I
[9:41] say this God is no different
[9:43] he's saying here the way that you live
[9:45] your life builds builds an image of your
[9:48] character
[9:49] now James chapter 2 verse 17 and I just
[9:51] want to kind of point to this passage
[9:54] here where he's talking about faith
[9:56] and Abraham expressing his faith by his
[9:58] Works he says even so faith if the hath
[10:01] not works is dead being alone
[10:03] so works here is your deed your Deeds
[10:07] your actions it's activity of life
[10:08] activity that expresses life so if your
[10:12] faith does not have Works your faith is
[10:14] dead because it's alone
[10:16] that's quite a statement as Paul
[10:19] especially expresses that you know that
[10:21] we're justified by faith not by works
[10:23] and that is from God's standpoint he
[10:26] sees your faith and justifies you
[10:27] according to your faith and now here's
[10:30] the other image of that that if you
[10:31] truly have faith it is going to be
[10:33] expressed by how you live your life
[10:37] but and it doesn't mean that if you make
[10:38] one mistake you don't have faith but
[10:40] that's the goal of faith is not that you
[10:42] would just have it but that it would
[10:43] reach its full and supreme expression as
[10:46] it did in Abraham that it's there
[10:48] helping you and it's aiding you and it's
[10:49] doing things through life's journey and
[10:51] where faith has its payoff is in the
[10:53] daily life
[10:54] and so Faith must have works or we can
[10:57] just assume that it's dead
[10:59] brother Branham says in the church age
[11:01] book here it is it most evidently set
[11:03] forth that
[11:04] the perfect manifestation of God in the
[11:07] Sun as we're reading in Hebrews 1 as we
[11:09] read from first John in these different
[11:11] places before here is the perfect
[11:13] manifestation of God in the son was by
[11:16] the indwelling spirit manifesting in
[11:19] word and works
[11:22] there's uh this is where the devil would
[11:24] want to bring a division
[11:26] but here God's brother bam said no let's
[11:28] not let's not even play that game
[11:30] kind of when they're asked what would
[11:31] you rather have would you rather have
[11:32] the Bible or the message of the hour I
[11:34] don't have to play your games
[11:36] it's like the guy one time said you know
[11:38] he's just saying I stayed at the La
[11:39] Quinta and the person said no it's La
[11:41] Quinta he says you can't force me to
[11:42] speak Spanish hey
[11:44] and this is where there's people try to
[11:46] force you
[11:47] into a choice I don't have to make that
[11:49] choice
[11:50] and here he's saying that the spirit was
[11:52] manifest itself in words and word and
[11:55] works that's capital W so it's word and
[11:58] works
[11:59] now zero in on this is he's talking
[12:01] about Jesus Christ but think of this as
[12:03] it relates to us because we've read how
[12:05] whom he did for no he's predestining to
[12:07] be conformed to another Express image
[12:10] the perfect manifestation was by the
[12:13] indwelling spirit manifested in word and
[12:15] works so you must be born again
[12:17] and to be born again you must be elect
[12:19] seed
[12:20] yes if you if you are not elect seed you
[12:22] cannot be born again because there's
[12:23] nothing in you to Quicken and that is
[12:26] the only way that the spirit indwells
[12:28] you
[12:29] now this is this is uh
[12:32] I want to say this is deep
[12:34] and I think it is because it's these
[12:37] pillars go down very very deep to reach
[12:39] the real bedrock the Holy Ghost can
[12:42] anoint someone in their spirit and their
[12:45] flesh to a lot of things and they still
[12:48] they're still lost
[12:50] and and there's a lot of things that
[12:52] maybe could be the work of the holy
[12:53] spirit in our in our emotional realm or
[12:55] in our Physical Realm and that's not
[12:57] what brother Adam is pointing to when he
[12:59] talks about the perfect manifestation of
[13:01] God it was the indwelling of the Holy
[13:04] Ghost that manifested itself in word and
[13:06] works so in order to have a perfect
[13:08] manifestation the spirit of God has to
[13:11] dwell in the soul of the individual and
[13:13] that only happens by the new birth
[13:16] and then this spirit manifested in word
[13:20] and works
[13:23] so it's not just a a confession well I'm
[13:25] a believer I'm a Believer it's you say
[13:28] you have faith without works it says
[13:30] I'll show you my faith by my Works my
[13:33] work my faith is active it's living it's
[13:35] Burly it's got strength to it it's got
[13:37] Vitality to it it will demonstrate
[13:39] itself
[13:40] and I recommend looking at the sermon
[13:43] works as Faith expressed in Shreveport
[13:46] there November 26th of 65. it says a lot
[13:48] even about Abraham's Faith a lot of
[13:50] really good principles and he says this
[13:52] faith and works are husband and wife
[13:55] they work together
[13:58] the husband works with the wife the wife
[14:00] with the husband they identify one
[14:03] another and that isn't that rich
[14:05] this is Faith is not a single a bachelor
[14:09] and works better not be a single um you
[14:13] know party girl
[14:14] right
[14:16] they said they go together
[14:18] faith and works her husband and wife so
[14:20] you can't have the works without Christ
[14:21] otherwise it's adultery for Spiritual
[14:25] fornication it's a spirit of adultery
[14:27] and so faith and works or husband and
[14:29] wife they work together the husband
[14:30] works with the wife the wife the husband
[14:32] they identify one another
[14:35] this is a union that comes together
[14:37] there's something that's being embodied
[14:39] then in the invisible if we could say
[14:41] the invisible Christ The Invisible word
[14:43] the invisible Faith but now it's going
[14:45] to have flesh which is who you are
[14:47] and this is where we have a husband and
[14:49] wife uniting together faith and works
[14:51] her husband and wife they identify one
[14:52] another he says like a man says he's
[14:54] married and yet he can't produce and
[14:56] show that he has a wife she goes to a
[14:58] different school right
[15:00] yet he kept produce and show that he has
[15:02] a wife you doubt his claim
[15:04] so if a man claims he's married claims
[15:07] he has Faith claims he knows Christ
[15:08] claims he's in the word but doesn't have
[15:10] a life to back it up you can doubt his
[15:12] claim
[15:13] there isn't the evidence of God in his
[15:16] life you can doubt his claim because the
[15:18] wife to that the identification is going
[15:20] to be the works
[15:22] now I want to be very careful not to be
[15:24] too specific
[15:26] because there's a way that I I think I
[15:28] believe that we can be explicit I think
[15:30] we can be uh very descriptive even as
[15:33] the Bible gives things that matter our
[15:35] way the spirit manifests itself the
[15:36] message of the hour uh expresses to us
[15:39] the way the Holy Spirit can manifest
[15:41] itself or Express itself uh physically
[15:44] but in this part part I want to be
[15:46] careful
[15:47] not to be too specific because we cannot
[15:50] create a carnal evidence of faith
[15:54] because faith is its faith is faith
[15:57] we cannot create carve out of false
[15:59] security and say well I have faith if I
[16:01] play the piano
[16:02] and because I play the piano shows I
[16:04] have faith and that leaves a lot of us
[16:05] out
[16:06] or in line to get piano lessons
[16:10] but brother bam said God's works are
[16:11] secret
[16:13] and that's that puts a this there's
[16:16] something more to it than just what's on
[16:17] the outside he says that God's works are
[16:19] understood only by his people
[16:22] so this puts the context of works that's
[16:25] something again very special that he's
[16:27] wanting to do not something that just
[16:30] anything but it's something very special
[16:31] these works are very special
[16:33] Jesus says this in John chapter 4 verse
[16:36] 34.
[16:37] Jesus saith unto them my meat
[16:40] is to do the will of him that sent me
[16:42] and to finish his work
[16:45] I I feel that I could step into this
[16:47] without any uh prefacing because we're
[16:50] talking about Jesus Christ the son of
[16:52] God who is the express image of the
[16:54] Father the one that did works that said
[16:56] that we would also do those works and
[16:59] that he was the perfect manifestation of
[17:01] God in the son he was he brought he
[17:04] expressed God in perfect clarity as
[17:05] brother Branham said it and now this is
[17:08] at the heart of what Jesus was doing
[17:10] my meat is to do the will of him that
[17:12] sent me and to finish his work this
[17:16] outstanding characteristic that brother
[17:17] Brown identifies about Christ is the
[17:19] harmony that existed between the father
[17:21] and the son that he didn't do anything
[17:23] unless the father told him to do it he
[17:25] didn't speak unless the father had
[17:27] spoken he didn't act unless the father
[17:29] had showed him to act it was the harmony
[17:30] that brother man called between the
[17:32] father and the son it was a distinctive
[17:35] trait
[17:36] so that you realize that whatever Jesus
[17:39] was doing he was doing it according to
[17:41] the will of God
[17:43] and so his Works were in season
[17:46] so Jesus wasn't saying well the works of
[17:48] God is to curse fig trees if you don't
[17:50] see fruit and therefore we all are under
[17:51] this commission every time you see a fig
[17:53] tree that's not burying figs curse it
[17:55] but he did something that the father had
[17:57] showed him to do so you couldn't just
[17:59] try to distill that down and extrapolate
[18:01] from it curse any fig tree that doesn't
[18:03] have fruit those are the works of Christ
[18:05] I want everybody from here on out to
[18:08] know what a fig tree looks like and if
[18:09] it's the season for figs and it's not
[18:11] berry fruit you better curse it or
[18:13] you're not christ-like
[18:14] right we create this arbitrary standard
[18:17] where to back up a little bit and he was
[18:20] doing something to express something
[18:22] about God's character he was doing
[18:24] something to fulfill the promises of God
[18:25] and the way that he acted he had needs
[18:27] to go by Samaria because God showed him
[18:30] he did because God had a purpose to
[18:32] fulfill in it
[18:33] and this is this outstanding
[18:35] characteristic of Christ his meat what
[18:38] he lived by was doing the will of God
[18:41] that sent him that was his substance
[18:43] that's what gave his life meaning
[18:46] because we eat bread to have life we eat
[18:48] bread to give us muscles and to give us
[18:49] energy and we eat things to sustain our
[18:51] lives and man shall not live by bread
[18:53] alone but by every word that proceeded
[18:55] from the mouth of God in other words
[18:56] it's his will that gives our life its
[18:59] substance it's his will that builds a
[19:01] gives us building blocks and gives us
[19:03] flesh and gives us energy it's his will
[19:05] that gives us the ambition
[19:08] says well that gives us peace
[19:11] I testify there's nothing like knowing
[19:14] you're in the perfect will of God
[19:16] and uphold you in whatever it is you go
[19:18] through whatever whatever it is you're
[19:20] facing because you know you're standing
[19:22] in his will when you're standing in his
[19:24] will and you come up against the battle
[19:25] that battles the Lords just as Moses
[19:27] came up against the Red Sea and knew
[19:29] he's standing right where God had called
[19:30] them to be and so he could stand there
[19:32] and face the Red Sea he said Lord here
[19:33] this is your job now
[19:35] could it be called it could be confident
[19:37] in his calling
[19:38] so brother Branham says this harmony
[19:40] that existed between Christ and the
[19:42] father exists now between Christ and his
[19:44] bride that's what he writes I think that
[19:46] was in the pick up your pen and write
[19:47] that he then puts into the church age
[19:50] book so this was God expressing this to
[19:52] us
[19:53] and he writes this in the church age
[19:55] book and this is shortly after him
[19:57] saying it the perfect manifestation of
[19:59] God was the indwelling spirit manifested
[20:01] in word and works he says when the bride
[20:03] will get back to being a word bride she
[20:06] will produce the very works that Jesus
[20:08] produced again there's those mysterious
[20:11] works right what what do we distill it
[20:14] down to how is it that if we were to
[20:16] produce the works that Jesus has
[20:17] produced does this become a line item
[20:19] list that we all have to kind of check
[20:21] the box
[20:22] that we all have to do and if you if you
[20:24] come up with that you're no different
[20:25] than the Catholics
[20:27] who've got the age at which you're to be
[20:29] sprinkled the age at which you're to be
[20:31] confirmed and everything is just already
[20:33] written out
[20:34] and I don't believe there's a message
[20:35] catechism we're trying to follow she
[20:37] will produce the very works that Jesus
[20:40] produced the word is God the spirit is
[20:43] God they are all one
[20:46] again there's sometimes there's a
[20:48] division that tries to come he says
[20:49] they're all one one cannot work apart
[20:51] from the other
[20:53] here's another Union of things we see
[20:55] faith in Works her husband and wife now
[20:56] he's saying the spirit and the word
[20:57] cannot work apart from the other if one
[21:00] truly has the spirit of God he will have
[21:02] the word of God
[21:04] and the way that he expresses this and
[21:06] the way it continues to express it in
[21:08] this particular part of the church age
[21:09] book is not that there are some
[21:11] manifestations to the spirit that we use
[21:13] as an Evidence but he's saying that if
[21:15] you truly have the spirit then the word
[21:18] will be there
[21:19] so the it's a word test not a spirit
[21:21] test so the test is is the word there do
[21:24] they what do they say to the word give
[21:26] them a word test what do they say to the
[21:27] word and so here he's saying if you have
[21:30] the word of God you you'll have the
[21:32] spirit of God he says but if you truly
[21:34] have the spirit of God if that's what
[21:35] you're you're looking for it says then
[21:37] you you if you have the spirit you have
[21:38] to have the word because they go
[21:40] together
[21:42] and so when the bride will get back to
[21:43] being a word bride she will produce not
[21:46] manufacture
[21:47] she will produce because it'll be him
[21:49] and her
[21:50] bring him to pass his word she will
[21:52] produce the very works that Jesus
[21:54] produced amen
[21:57] amen and the sermon the invisible unit
[21:58] of the bride of Christ this is very
[22:01] important to catch
[22:03] watch when the spiritual bride when she
[22:05] begins to have a Revival
[22:08] and then he defines what a Revival is
[22:10] when she begins to come back and line
[22:12] herself up with the word of God
[22:15] this is the bride's Revival when she
[22:18] lines herself up with the word of God
[22:20] when she will get back to being a word
[22:22] bride the word in her which is Spirit
[22:25] it is power it's life it'll produce the
[22:28] very works that Jesus produced so when
[22:30] he says this when he's preaching
[22:31] invisible Union when she begins to have
[22:33] a Revival when she comes back and lines
[22:36] herself up with the word of God that's
[22:37] her Revival
[22:39] says watch then again how the scriptures
[22:42] at that time there'll be a message sweep
[22:44] out to catch the bride catch that woman
[22:47] elect
[22:48] so there is a message to get our
[22:50] attention
[22:51] and as we begin to line up with the word
[22:53] of God that's our Revival and that
[22:56] stirring the stimulation of Revelation
[22:58] that word that begins to break up in our
[23:00] heart open up in our hearts that becomes
[23:02] the very Source of Life and Overcoming
[23:04] power within the believer but the
[23:07] Revival starts with the word the Revival
[23:10] starts with lining up with the word
[23:12] listen no matter how much God moves in
[23:15] your life never forget that a true move
[23:18] is built upon the word
[23:20] without the word it's nothing
[23:25] you have to have the word foundation
[23:27] when she begins to line herself with the
[23:29] word of God that's your Revival that's
[23:31] your source of life he comes back to it
[23:33] says but then the time that the people
[23:34] are ready to line up there's a message
[23:36] come forth and they line with it
[23:39] there must be a a taking hold of the
[23:41] word of God
[23:43] as Jesus said my meat is to do the will
[23:45] of him that sent me and to finish his
[23:46] work therefore for us to be another
[23:48] Express image there must be a will for
[23:51] us to do a work for us to finish
[23:55] and brother Branham says the proof of
[23:58] the indwelling spirit
[24:00] and this is
[24:02] he says more and I think most of you are
[24:04] familiar with these passages about the
[24:06] evidence of the Holy Ghost and the proof
[24:07] of these things the proof of the
[24:09] indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and
[24:12] follow
[24:13] what God's Prophet gave for his age as
[24:16] he set the church in order
[24:18] we have an absolute it is the word of
[24:21] God
[24:22] and this word of God has been made alive
[24:24] to us and made real to us and we must
[24:27] line ourselves up with it and he says
[24:29] the proof of the Holy Ghost you want to
[24:31] note the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[24:33] when you have a clear understanding when
[24:36] you the Holy Ghost in you can say Amen
[24:38] to the word of God he always put the
[24:40] proof in the evidence back with the word
[24:42] because the spirit and the word are one
[24:44] so one thing it will agree with it's the
[24:46] one thing it cannot contradict it's the
[24:48] one thing that cannot be impersonated is
[24:49] the word
[24:50] that puts it on a whole nother level the
[24:52] proof of the spirit indwelling an
[24:54] individual is to acknowledge and follow
[24:57] so it's not just saying amen being
[24:59] sympathetic acknowledging it but also
[25:01] following what God's Prophet gave for
[25:04] his age so in this age we've had a
[25:07] message that's been delivered to us and
[25:09] the proof of the spirit is that we will
[25:11] humble ourselves to the word that has
[25:13] been given to this age not our own ideas
[25:15] not our own interpretations but that we
[25:17] would we would acknowledge it say that's
[25:19] truth I acknowledge it
[25:21] it's amazing just how
[25:24] uh with the this age of information that
[25:27] the devil can take any quote and and
[25:30] wear message clothing and say well I
[25:32] know brother Bradham said that but you
[25:34] got to know where he said it
[25:36] like great now I gotta know where he
[25:38] said it yeah you got to find out that
[25:40] that church had a problem with this so
[25:42] that's the only reason why brother
[25:44] Branham said it that way
[25:46] and you're like oh okay well I guess I
[25:48] can't read that one what about this one
[25:49] well you got to realize and you realize
[25:51] that we become subject to the message
[25:53] historians
[25:56] we've got to acknowledge and follow what
[25:59] God's Prophet gave for this age as he
[26:02] set the church in order
[26:04] I believe that God has crowned brother
[26:06] Brandon's Ministry with this that he
[26:08] dressed the bride in the word he's it's
[26:11] tailor-made for the woman that is going
[26:14] to submit herself to God's word it'll
[26:17] fit her but there's seven women in this
[26:19] age who want to wear their own clothing
[26:21] and eat their own bread and they don't
[26:23] want to dress themselves in the message
[26:25] of the outward
[26:27] because the prophet's the one that set
[26:29] the church in order
[26:31] this is the proof of the spirit
[26:32] indwelling
[26:33] the headship of the word is the only way
[26:35] to have life
[26:37] the headship of the word is the only way
[26:38] to have life because he has to be the
[26:40] initiator he has to be the motivator
[26:42] and brother Branham says that there will
[26:44] be a message catch the bride's attention
[26:46] when she begins to have a Revival which
[26:48] is to line herself up with the word of
[26:50] God and I believe that it's in choose it
[26:52] of a bride brother Branham says the true
[26:54] bride attack attracts the attention of
[26:56] God by keeping his word
[26:59] and in that same sermon that she's
[27:00] attracted to character but now she
[27:02] attracts the attention of God by keeping
[27:04] his word
[27:10] let me remind you of some of the
[27:11] statements we've read from Christ the
[27:12] mystery God revealed our headship is the
[27:14] kingdom
[27:15] the kingdom of God is within you
[27:18] the kingdom we are not a denomination we
[27:19] belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is
[27:22] the word of God made spirit and life in
[27:24] our own life
[27:26] bring into pass every promise in this
[27:29] day as it did in that day when the word
[27:31] in God Was Won
[27:33] so just as it was expressed in Jesus
[27:35] Christ Our Kingdom is headship is a
[27:38] kingdom
[27:39] it's the word made spirit and life
[27:43] bringing to pass every promise in this
[27:45] day so there's your promise for today
[27:48] bringing it to pass
[27:50] spirit and life in our own life he says
[27:52] and the world again has fallen apart
[27:54] this one's a real key I think we've read
[27:56] these many many times I just felt
[27:57] impressed to share them again at this
[27:59] juncture he says and the word is the
[28:01] kingdom
[28:02] this is the king and he's talking about
[28:04] the Bible the way he says it this is the
[28:06] king and Kingdom the system the life
[28:09] it's every bit right in here
[28:12] the system the order the structure it's
[28:15] all in the word of God every bit of the
[28:17] kingdom is in the word of God
[28:20] we are to be an expressed image
[28:23] we're to be the God's character
[28:25] expressed
[28:28] and the works that he did we're to do
[28:30] also brother Brown describes it this way
[28:33] I believe
[28:35] we're talking about expressing something
[28:36] in Expressions I've been pondering a lot
[28:38] about Expressions being on vacation
[28:41] afforded us different opportunities and
[28:42] fellowship and uh we're just here with
[28:45] the home Church you're just focused on
[28:47] what's Happening I don't make it a habit
[28:49] of streaming other services and we don't
[28:50] have maybe a lot of Fellowship that
[28:52] comes through uh being out here in the
[28:53] west and so there's sometimes you're a
[28:56] little bit disconnected from what's
[28:57] Happening and so just being in
[28:58] fellowship and be exposed to different
[29:00] things it really broadens your Insight
[29:01] to things that are going on and I
[29:03] believe the word is always orienting us
[29:06] and shifting us to make sure we're
[29:07] headed in the right direction
[29:09] it's always the word was given to us if
[29:11] I could just draw from this uh because
[29:14] I'm just very motivated by these things
[29:16] that we see in the message of the hour
[29:17] that after you had the laodicean church
[29:21] passed by envisioned to brother Branham
[29:23] and they were dancing and shaken to rock
[29:26] and roll music
[29:27] and they went down and descended in the
[29:29] darkness and brother Bradham is aghast
[29:31] at the pr what his message produced is
[29:33] this what my message produced he said
[29:35] then came the bride and she was dressed
[29:37] beautifully each one in their National
[29:39] Guard maybe they had their own way of
[29:41] expressing themselves they had their own
[29:43] way of manifesting the life because they
[29:45] were dressed in their National Garb they
[29:47] had the word in their language had the
[29:49] word in their life and as they begin to
[29:51] March holy to Onward Christian Soldiers
[29:54] and they began to ascend up into and
[29:57] take a step higher and a step higher and
[29:59] as they passed by but I said they're
[30:01] going this when he looks and now brother
[30:02] Brandon was behind us now in this Vision
[30:04] as he sees he sees a couple people at
[30:07] the back get out of step and if you
[30:09] remember why did they get out of Step
[30:10] they were watching the lady oh see in
[30:13] church dancing Boogie Woogie to rock and
[30:15] roll music and that's what got him out
[30:17] of step and he said get back in line
[30:19] because that's your Rising that's your
[30:22] power to rise above all the things well
[30:24] that's what's going to stimulate you is
[30:26] when you come back to the water I'm
[30:28] going to line up with it that's your
[30:29] Reviving
[30:30] [Music]
[30:32] and that's what's going to put flesh to
[30:34] this word
[30:36] and then the church age book Ephesians
[30:38] Church age brother says God's intention
[30:40] for his creation man is to express his
[30:43] words
[30:45] that's that's a phrase I've been
[30:46] thinking of over and over and over again
[30:47] God's intention for man is to express
[30:49] his words God created a human
[30:52] so that he could be expressed
[30:55] this was what God was God was always
[30:57] working towards flesh God was always
[30:58] moving towards flesh and brothers talked
[31:00] about how he's moving towards the
[31:01] kingdom the word made spirit and life in
[31:03] your life this is it this embodies it
[31:06] and he uses Adam as an example in
[31:09] Genesis Adam was given the word to live
[31:11] by him a life lived by the word would be
[31:14] the word expressed
[31:18] the word in works
[31:20] Faith Works is Faith expressed the word
[31:24] and works a life lived by the word
[31:27] is works
[31:28] a life lived by the word would be the
[31:31] word expressed if we have the word and
[31:33] works we have faith and works if we have
[31:34] them together then it's a life lived by
[31:37] it
[31:38] the life lived by the word is the
[31:40] translation the interpretation the
[31:41] expression a life lived by the word
[31:44] would be the word expressed
[31:46] that is true is it not
[31:48] but did Adam live by that word no
[31:51] because he was to live by every word and
[31:53] he failed to take heed to every word
[31:55] then there arose Moses what a great and
[31:57] mighty man he was yet he also failed to
[31:59] live by every word and that Prophet the
[32:01] type of the great prophet to come felt
[32:03] in Anger to obey the word and there was
[32:05] also David the great king of Israel a
[32:07] man after God's Own Heart he failed by
[32:09] adultery when he was tempted
[32:11] but eventually in the fullness of time
[32:14] there came one this is drawn right from
[32:16] Hebrews he says There came one the head
[32:17] even Jesus who also who must be tempted
[32:20] to see if he would live by every word
[32:22] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[32:25] and the bride is to come in contact
[32:26] again with this
[32:28] and you are to prove that you're not
[32:30] like that woman
[32:32] so we are under Temptation in this last
[32:34] days and what's the temptation to not
[32:37] keep every word
[32:38] [Music]
[32:40] then was Satan foiled for here was one
[32:43] who lived by it is written
[32:46] and that Masterpiece of God overcame by
[32:49] reflecting God's word
[32:53] in word end works there in the
[32:55] Temptation in the wilderness he resisted
[32:57] the Temptation by the word of God even
[32:59] in the face of the word being quoted to
[33:01] him even in the face of certain things
[33:03] being presented to him to show an image
[33:07] of what the word was projected about the
[33:09] Messiah as the Bible said he shall
[33:11] suddenly come to his Temple and here he
[33:13] was trying to bring him to a place to
[33:15] manifest himself Suddenly at the temple
[33:17] and he could resist it because it had to
[33:19] be in its season
[33:22] there's a lot there that I hope you
[33:24] could just connect those he says in that
[33:25] Masterpiece of God overcame by
[33:27] reflecting God's word and that's the
[33:28] only way that you can know you're
[33:29] overcoming
[33:30] is by the word then was this manifested
[33:33] perfect one given the cross as the
[33:35] perfect Lamb of God for the perfect
[33:37] sacrifice and on the tree he received
[33:40] the wounds unto death that we notice how
[33:42] quickly this comes to us that we by him
[33:45] and because of him might eat of the Tree
[33:48] of Life
[33:49] and then that life freely given would
[33:52] enable us to overcome and express the
[33:55] word of God
[33:57] this is where it comes back to the
[33:58] firstborn among many Brethren the
[34:00] Masterpiece of God overcame by
[34:02] reflecting God's word having fulfilled
[34:04] God's purpose for him his Spirit can
[34:07] come back upon the election without that
[34:09] death burial Resurrection the seed could
[34:11] not be germinated but now that he has
[34:13] fulfilled his part and done his work and
[34:16] he stayed faithful to have that harmony
[34:17] with the father therefore the life can
[34:20] come back upon the believer the life
[34:22] being freely given through the new birth
[34:23] enables us to overcome and to express
[34:27] the word of God and the word of God is
[34:30] the character of God
[34:32] and a life lived by the word is the word
[34:34] expressed
[34:36] it has to be the spirit the word which
[34:39] the spirit in life made flesh in our own
[34:41] lives
[34:42] I know I'm speaking a very general just
[34:44] general terms tonight
[34:46] but it's at the heart of any it has to
[34:48] be at the heart of Our Lives
[34:51] Christ the Masterpiece of God
[34:54] reflected God's word we too are to
[34:56] overcome and reflect Express the word of
[35:00] God
[35:01] if you look at Colossians chapter one
[35:03] I'd like to read a few verses about
[35:05] Christ
[35:07] from Christ is the mystery God revealed
[35:10] because Christ was the express
[35:14] image
[35:15] he was the character
[35:18] of God
[35:20] amen and says Christ who is the image of
[35:22] the invisible God
[35:24] the firstborn of every creature
[35:27] for by him were all things created that
[35:29] are in heaven and that are in Earth
[35:31] visible and invisible whether they be
[35:34] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[35:35] or Powers all things were created by Him
[35:37] and for him
[35:39] and he is before all things and by him
[35:41] all things consist
[35:43] this is a language of grandeur that is
[35:46] unsurpassed
[35:47] this could not fit any man
[35:50] this this puts it outside the realm of
[35:53] one who would be born between a man and
[35:55] a woman this is a description that has
[35:58] to only have come from an expression of
[36:00] God
[36:01] and at this at this point
[36:05] it is
[36:07] the image of the invisible God is as a
[36:10] creator of all things
[36:12] everything being created by Him and for
[36:15] him
[36:16] and he's before all and by all and
[36:19] there's just the magnitude of this is so
[36:21] great but now Paul brings it to this
[36:24] this head and he is the head of the body
[36:27] the church
[36:29] so now everything that is in heaven and
[36:31] everything that is on Earth has been set
[36:34] up as having some connection to Christ
[36:36] the image of the invisible God but now
[36:39] what he has done is he's taken
[36:40] everything in Heaven and Earth and he
[36:42] compresses it down to headship over the
[36:45] body of the church
[36:47] that now this is everything else that
[36:49] exists whether it be dominions
[36:50] principalities powers or Thrones and
[36:52] everything that's created he now wants
[36:54] us to focus on this this purpose this
[36:57] objective he is the head of the body of
[36:59] the church the head signifies the
[37:01] life-giver the head signifies the
[37:04] intelligence the animator the one that's
[37:06] generating the one that's giving he says
[37:08] that who is the beginning the firstborn
[37:11] from the dead then in all things he
[37:13] might have the preeminence and Broad
[37:15] Branham is capturing so much from that
[37:17] Christ must have preeminence
[37:20] please the father that in him should all
[37:22] fullness dwell and having made peace to
[37:24] the blood of his cross by him to
[37:26] reconcile all things unto himself by him
[37:28] I say whether they be things in Earth or
[37:30] things in heaven
[37:32] that's that's Redemption
[37:35] this is this complete image of a
[37:38] Redemption of things in heaven and
[37:40] things in Earth why because everything
[37:42] that was there he all things created in
[37:45] Heaven and Earth visible invisible
[37:47] everything is described comes back to
[37:49] the very purpose of God in the beginning
[37:50] of all of it that he might have a body
[37:53] and behead to that body
[37:55] that he might have preeminence brother
[37:56] Brown says have the preeminence to
[37:59] express himself through the bride
[38:02] as God expressed himself through Christ
[38:04] and had preeminence in Christ he now
[38:06] wants to have preeminence in the bride
[38:08] to express himself
[38:12] he's the head of the body
[38:14] and brother Brown picks this up he says
[38:16] God's Great secret mystery God's secret
[38:18] mystery he had before the world began
[38:22] I know some of you are just kind of uh
[38:25] mouth this as I read it we hear it so
[38:26] often
[38:27] back in the back part of God's mind
[38:29] there was something he was trying and
[38:31] was going to achieve and he had a motive
[38:32] in doing it in order to let himself be
[38:36] expressed
[38:37] so we see that all things that are in
[38:39] Heaven and Earth visible invisible where
[38:41] the Thrones dominions principalities or
[38:43] Powers all things are created by Him and
[38:44] for him he is before all things and by
[38:46] him all things consist but the head of
[38:49] the body the church is where he is
[38:51] expressed
[38:53] in order to let himself be expressed
[38:54] because first there wasn't even a moon a
[38:56] star an Adam molecule or anything he was
[38:58] God but he exactly wasn't God at that
[39:00] time because God is an object of worship
[39:01] there wasn't anything to worship him so
[39:03] in his great mind
[39:06] he wanted these attributes to be
[39:09] expressed
[39:10] and in him was love and him was to be a
[39:12] father and him was to be a son and it
[39:14] was to be a savior and it's in Christ
[39:17] the mystery God revealed brother Bradham
[39:18] expresses this beautiful truth that he
[39:20] wanted he loved fatherhood and the only
[39:23] way that he could be a father was to
[39:24] become a son
[39:26] this is that becoming God this is that
[39:29] one uh who is his always unfolding
[39:34] he had attributes to be expressed love
[39:36] father son savior healer and all these
[39:39] great attributes that we see already
[39:40] expressed they were in God
[39:44] and yet there's unexpressed attributes
[39:47] they're still
[39:49] they're still God still wants to express
[39:51] himself
[39:55] these attributes in Christ he wanted to
[39:58] express these attributes
[40:02] all these great attributes were in God
[40:05] in the beginning and he wanted them to
[40:07] be expressed
[40:09] I want to draw this back to God's
[40:12] character
[40:13] God shows his character by his Works
[40:15] Christ was the very character of God the
[40:17] Bible says in Proverbs 23 7 for as he
[40:20] thinketh in his heart this man is he's
[40:22] these observations of wisdom
[40:26] and and I'm not wanting to just take it
[40:28] completely out of context but this is a
[40:29] principle that stands sure and this
[40:31] hypocrite who entices you to a meal and
[40:34] to an offer and he says for as he
[40:35] thinketh in his heart so is he that this
[40:37] principle stands on its own
[40:39] eat and drink saith he to thee but his
[40:41] heart is not with thee
[40:44] the proverb is saying that your thoughts
[40:46] betray your words
[40:48] your thoughts what's in your heart
[40:51] betrays your actions
[40:53] so you can say something and do
[40:55] something but if your heart's not right
[40:58] it doesn't count
[41:00] because your character is made known by
[41:03] your works and if your works are
[41:06] pretense if your works or you're saying
[41:08] the right thing or you're trying to do
[41:10] the right thing but your heart isn't
[41:12] right because as a man thinks in his
[41:14] heart it's what's in the heart that
[41:16] determines the character of a man's work
[41:19] for as he thinks in his heart so is he
[41:22] therefore God having thoughts in his
[41:24] mind things that God thought about
[41:26] attributes that needed to be expressed
[41:28] that's what made God who he was and it's
[41:31] in that it's in the making of that flesh
[41:34] that declares who God is
[41:36] because these great attributes in God's
[41:38] mind that he wanted to be expressed
[41:40] these unexpressed thoughts had to take
[41:42] on flesh for God's character to be
[41:44] expressed
[41:47] and I draw this to a close we just have
[41:49] a couple scriptures and a few statements
[41:51] left to read
[41:52] brother Brown uses this in the church
[41:54] age book to express how that God had
[41:56] thoughts in his mind that he wants to be
[41:57] expressed
[41:59] these are God's thoughts
[42:01] thoughts that are righteous thoughts
[42:02] that are correct thoughts that are pure
[42:04] thoughts of Peace he had he took your
[42:06] perfect picture
[42:07] that's the picture he took of you in his
[42:10] mind that's what's being developed in
[42:11] your life
[42:12] brother Branham says in identification
[42:14] we are invited to have our character
[42:16] molded to his character that's what I
[42:19] want this clay that was born between a
[42:21] man and a woman I received my body and
[42:23] my spirit from my mom and dad they gave
[42:26] me nature and they nurtured me but now
[42:28] that I've been born again and there's a
[42:29] new life on the inside of me I have an
[42:31] invitation for my nature and to be
[42:34] molded and for my life my spirit and
[42:37] even this body to become subject to it
[42:39] so that he can put his mark on me he can
[42:42] put his imprint in me
[42:46] there's a
[42:48] this life that can be lived out through
[42:50] us
[42:51] it's God's thoughts being expressed
[42:53] Psalms 139 15-17 my substance was not
[42:57] hid from thee when I was made in secret
[42:59] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[43:01] parts of the earth that's a phrase quite
[43:03] a phrase to describe what's taking place
[43:05] that's hidden
[43:07] to to the Jews the what the transpired
[43:10] in the womb was a mystery
[43:12] and it says my substance it's it's the
[43:14] very bones it's just things that are
[43:16] being made up
[43:18] and he says so that my my substance was
[43:20] not hid from you though though there may
[43:22] even be observable now the the formation
[43:25] of the womb of a baby in the womb of a
[43:28] mother and these things could be
[43:29] observed in tremendous detail thanks to
[43:31] science as the writer here is saying
[43:34] nothing there's no mystery to God in
[43:36] that
[43:37] he knows every part
[43:40] man has to wait for things to come to a
[43:42] certain place of development before they
[43:44] can declare certain things whether it be
[43:46] in the blood a certain stages and and
[43:48] they're waiting for it to present God
[43:50] knows it all from the beginning
[43:52] and he and he there's writers saying you
[43:54] knew my substance president was saying
[43:56] this even about Adam about Adam it could
[43:58] be said that God had thought about Adam
[44:00] and had thoughts about Adam my substance
[44:02] was not hid from thee when I was made in
[44:04] secret and curiously wrought into the
[44:05] lowest parts of the earth when I was
[44:06] being formed in my mother's womb but he
[44:08] says Thine Eyes did see my substance
[44:12] now that's not the same word in verse
[44:14] 15. in verse 15 it's speaking more to
[44:17] the the bone and power that's being made
[44:18] up of the person because mine eyes did
[44:21] see my embryo you saw me folded together
[44:24] it's rolled together as they would see
[44:26] this thing as something being rolled
[44:27] like a scroll your eyes did see me in
[44:30] seed you see my seed form your eyes did
[44:34] see me as an embryo yet being unperfect
[44:37] and in thy book in your scroll all my
[44:41] members were written which in continuous
[44:43] for fashioned when as yet there was none
[44:44] of them
[44:45] oh God God knows you by election he your
[44:49] substance it's not just what's been
[44:50] formed in the womb curiously running
[44:52] lost parts of the Earth but his eyes
[44:54] ceased the seed and God knows the life
[44:57] and the character that's on the inside
[44:59] of that elect seed
[45:02] that's all he says oh how precious also
[45:05] are their thoughts unto me oh God how
[45:08] great is the sum of them where are those
[45:11] thoughts they're in the embryo of the
[45:13] word where is the sum of them it's in
[45:15] the folding together of the election of
[45:18] the word seed that was down on the
[45:19] inside of you
[45:22] brother bear says the thoughts were
[45:24] there in his mind
[45:25] and that thought was eternal and had to
[45:28] be expressed
[45:30] when did the Lord see your substance
[45:32] this isn't the pre-existing of souls but
[45:34] this is the thought and the mind of God
[45:35] that are Eternal and real
[45:38] and he says in the future home you were
[45:40] made
[45:42] for an eternal purpose
[45:44] because you were the manifestation of an
[45:47] attribute that was in God
[45:49] that thought of you and expressed you
[45:52] this this is that got to make that so
[45:55] personal
[45:56] that you were made for an eternal
[45:59] purpose
[46:00] if you're made for an eternal purpose
[46:02] then nothing temporal can stop you
[46:06] nothing temporal can stop you
[46:08] and even if someone say ah well
[46:10] something did then that was part of the
[46:12] Eternal purpose
[46:14] nothing can defeat God's purpose
[46:17] you were made for an eternal purpose
[46:19] because you were the attribute
[46:20] manifestation of an attribute that was
[46:21] in God that thought of you and expressed
[46:24] you now he says and he made the Earth to
[46:27] take you out of it
[46:28] oh wow that takes this Earth curiously
[46:31] right on the lowest parts of the earth
[46:32] used to describe the womb a Jew would
[46:35] describe a woman's womb in this poetic
[46:37] phrase and curiously wrought in the
[46:39] lowest parts of the Earth but what is it
[46:40] emblematic of God curiously rotting
[46:43] bringing you together and so on you as a
[46:46] seed of the Earth because God made the
[46:47] Earth for a purpose to get a bride out
[46:49] of it and he made the Earth to take you
[46:51] out of it and to make you a human being
[46:53] and what is the purpose of a human being
[46:55] God's intention for his creation human
[46:58] beings is to express his word a life to
[47:01] live by the word would be the word
[47:02] express
[47:03] life lived by a human being
[47:07] a life led by you you have an
[47:09] opportunity no matter how young you are
[47:11] no matter how old you are you have an
[47:13] opportunity as a human being to express
[47:16] the word of God
[47:19] Hallelujah
[47:21] he made the Earth to take you out of it
[47:23] and make you a human being that you
[47:25] might Express the word
[47:28] he says all these things about Christ
[47:30] who's in the image of God
[47:32] he is the head of the body of the church
[47:34] that he might have the preeminence have
[47:35] the prims to express himself through the
[47:37] Bride Watch how he comes to verse 26
[47:39] even the mystery I know I'm skipping a
[47:41] lot here
[47:42] even the mystery which has been hid from
[47:44] ages and from Generations but has now
[47:46] made manifest to his Saints this is
[47:48] Christ
[47:52] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[47:54] is to be made known to his Saints
[47:57] this is how he said that the works of
[47:59] God are only understood by his people he
[48:01] has to make it known by revelation
[48:04] it's made manifest to his Saints to whom
[48:07] to the Saints God would make known
[48:09] what is the riches of the glory of this
[48:13] mystery among the Gentiles Christ who is
[48:16] the brightness of his glory the
[48:18] expressed image of the person of God
[48:20] he has made known by Revelation to the
[48:22] saints that we might know the riches of
[48:25] the glory of this mystery among the
[48:26] Gentiles and what is the riches of the
[48:28] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[48:29] which is Christ in you
[48:33] the hope of glory
[48:37] it's Heaven's mystery of the Earth's
[48:39] hope of glory
[48:41] this great mystery of God which had been
[48:43] hid from ages now manifest to his saints
[48:45] that the Saints may know the riches of
[48:47] the glory of this mystery which is
[48:48] Christ in you
[48:51] the hope of glory amen
[48:55] brother Branham says in Christ the
[48:57] mystery God revealed it will invite our
[48:59] brothers to come to their instruments
[49:01] he says now we see the Promise being
[49:03] fulfilled
[49:04] Christ the true headship going in coming
[49:07] in his bride doing the same Works he did
[49:10] at the beginning and making ready and
[49:12] fulfilling his word as he did at the
[49:14] first in John 14 12 he that believeth on
[49:16] me the works that I do shall he do also
[49:18] then they head and the body are becoming
[49:23] one
[49:24] in works and in signs and in life
[49:28] Vindicated by God himself through his
[49:31] promised word for the last days he
[49:33] promised this in the last days now if
[49:36] you're spiritual you'll catch it
[49:39] I guess that's what I'll just say to you
[49:41] if you're spiritual catch it
[49:43] brother Aaron I didn't understand your
[49:45] sermon tonight well I mean if you're
[49:46] you're spiritual you'll catch it
[49:49] and I Know It begs the question what is
[49:51] it what is it let him show it to you
[49:55] if there's a 1152 sermons
[49:58] there's thousands of more bride members
[50:01] who are going to feed on that in unique
[50:03] ways
[50:04] and that's the beauty of the body of
[50:06] Christ is how that the spirit does
[50:08] something in you the spirit does
[50:09] something in you Spirit does something
[50:11] in you and when it's God it's all order
[50:14] and it harmonizes because you're doing
[50:16] something I can't you're doing something
[50:18] I can't you're doing something I can't
[50:20] but if we all do our part it just
[50:21] harmonizes but when I see someone doing
[50:24] something oh I want to do what he's
[50:25] doing I want to then we just start
[50:26] bumping it becomes chaos it becomes that
[50:28] chaos that distracts the bride in the
[50:30] last day he's
[50:32] but when God's moving and God's
[50:34] manifesting
[50:35] if you're spiritual if you have the
[50:37] spirit the word will be with you he'll
[50:40] give you Revelation understanding so
[50:41] much I could say so much more to be said
[50:43] about the spirit and how it manifests
[50:46] but this is all with the kingdom
[50:49] as the Bible says
[50:52] for this cause this is a Colossians 1 9
[50:54] for this cause since the day we heard it
[50:57] of their love and their their
[51:00] faithfulness
[51:02] we do not cease to pray for you and to
[51:03] desire that you be filled with the
[51:05] knowledge of his will and all wisdom and
[51:08] spiritual understanding this is Paul's
[51:09] prayer for the Colossus church that you
[51:12] would be filled with the knowledge of
[51:13] his will and all wisdom and spiritual
[51:15] understanding that's what gets the gods
[51:16] God's attention to acknowledge and
[51:18] follow the will of God that you might
[51:20] walk worthy of the Lord unto all
[51:22] pleasing being fruitful in every good
[51:24] work and increasing in the knowledge of
[51:27] God
[51:28] word and works goes together Revelation
[51:31] and manifestation go together
[51:33] listen if it doesn't it's a single woman
[51:37] right if it doesn't it's just it's one
[51:39] of the daughters of the heart you've got
[51:41] to have the word you've got to have the
[51:43] word together with it it's with all
[51:45] knowledge and spiritual understanding he
[51:47] says that increasing be fruitful in
[51:49] every good work increasing in the
[51:50] knowledge of God strengthened with
[51:51] almight according to his glorious power
[51:53] unto all patience and long-suffering
[51:56] with joyfulness giving thanks unto the
[51:58] Father which hath made us to be meat to
[52:00] be partakers of the inheritance of the
[52:02] Saints in light
[52:04] who have delivered us from the power of
[52:06] darkness and hath translated us into the
[52:08] kingdom of his dear son
[52:10] that's what we're a part of
[52:12] these are the elements of the Kingdom
[52:15] these are General descriptions about A
[52:16] Life That's to be lived out and
[52:18] expressed in us and brothers says what
[52:20] is that word bride
[52:22] the manifestation of this hour
[52:24] he says you're a reflection of the
[52:26] message of the hour
[52:28] the bride the manifestation of this hour
[52:30] is the bride not a Creator denomination
[52:32] but a living Oracle of God
[52:35] a living attribute of God
[52:38] displaying to the whole world the
[52:40] attributes of God
[52:41] in the formation of the Bride that's to
[52:44] be expressed in this hour that we're now
[52:47] living
[52:48] I've said this before but your life
[52:50] means something
[52:51] let's not make the mistake of just
[52:54] carving out a little Arena
[52:56] and when we gather here we're just
[52:58] Gathering to another Arena
[53:00] toward this is this is where this is
[53:02] where we express our religion
[53:04] this is where we we express our
[53:06] knowledge and the things of God this is
[53:07] this is our ballpark so to speak
[53:10] and this is this is where this is where
[53:13] we express it this is where we uh
[53:15] partake in our Hobby and our interest
[53:16] let it not be said that this is the
[53:19] embodiment what takes place in these
[53:21] four walls what our responses to the
[53:23] word that goes out over this Pulpit
[53:24] embodies this the life that we have on
[53:26] the inside of us but no it's to be the
[53:29] bride who's expressing the promise of
[53:31] this hour a living attribute of God
[53:34] displaying to the world the attributes
[53:36] of God
[53:37] if anything what we do here is where we
[53:40] come to receive energy and strength and
[53:43] substance and fellowship in the word of
[53:45] God invigorating our souls that when we
[53:46] hit those doors we can be living
[53:48] attributes
[53:49] so we can express God
[53:51] to the people
[53:53] I believe God wants to do that in your
[53:55] lives and in doing that I believe
[53:56] they'll be Souls saved in this Valley by
[53:58] the life that you live and the power of
[54:00] God that lives in your life and the
[54:02] Supernatural That's Unleashed it'll
[54:04] it'll happen by word of testimony it
[54:05] will happen by character will happen by
[54:07] your response to things and I believe
[54:08] God is wanting to use these branches use
[54:12] your life to get others attention it may
[54:14] not be a vast Harvest this is just a
[54:16] gleaning time but unless the life is
[54:17] being lived out on you you're not going
[54:19] to have the salt to catch the attention
[54:21] of somebody out there
[54:23] let's not be cultish let's live the life
[54:26] for others to see could you stand with
[54:29] me tonight
[54:30] [Music]
[54:33] if I want to pray with you
[54:37] thank you so much for your attention
[54:41] let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer
[54:44] brother Branham says we want to make
[54:46] this Bible our Looking Glass
[54:49] and let ourselves be molded by his
[54:51] character
[54:52] by letting the mind that was in Christ
[54:55] be in US
[54:57] you'll find that this character that I'm
[54:59] talking about only comes from the word
[55:01] of God
[55:02] in that alone
[55:04] we've got to be able to bring it back to
[55:06] the word
[55:08] Christ who is in the
[55:10] brightness of his glory
[55:13] the bride when she's described in
[55:15] Revelations 21
[55:17] it speaks of her light
[55:20] and it says she had the glory of God
[55:24] that's what's in Earth right now
[55:26] this is the earth Glory
[55:29] tonight you
[55:31] a living Oracle of God
[55:34] brother Branham said it about
[55:35] Jeffersonville Tavern at Branham
[55:36] Tabernacle in Jefferson this is what
[55:38] Jeffersonville needs is thousands of
[55:39] lived voices
[55:41] he said that's the Thunder that shakes
[55:43] the devil
[55:44] [Music]
[55:45] that's the Thunder I want in our lives
[55:49] a life lived by the word would be the
[55:50] word expressed
[55:52] if you desire prayer tonight
[55:55] could you
[55:56] [Music]

[56:03] that's got wants to lay their hands on
[56:05] brother Alfonso brother man well if
[56:06] you'd want to go lay hands on our
[56:07] brother we're going to pray for him
[56:08] right now
[56:10] anybody else that feel led to do this
[56:12] I'm going to pray that in the name of
[56:13] the Lord Jesus Christ God heals his back

[56:40] could be found right now all every sick
[56:44] person can be healed and what I pray is
[56:46] hands are being laid upon our brother
[56:48] according to scripture he says these
[56:50] signs shall follow them that believe
[56:51] they shall lay their hands upon the sick
[56:54] and they shall recover our brother
[56:56] Alfonso is a Believer himself and he has
[56:59] faith in this promise and as these men
[57:01] of God had laid their hands upon our
[57:02] brother I pray in the name of the Lord
[57:04] Jesus Christ you'd give them strength in
[57:06] his body and Lord that you had so
[57:08] completely heal him that this MRI would
[57:11] declare you to be the same yesterday
[57:13] today and forever and may he feel that
[57:16] healing power and Lord if he wakes in
[57:18] the morning a little creaky a little
[57:20] stiff with a little bit of pain may he
[57:22] have confidence to call him lying
