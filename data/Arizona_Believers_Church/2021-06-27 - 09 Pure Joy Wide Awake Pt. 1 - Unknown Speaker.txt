TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so glad that you're here today and I believe the Lord wants to speak to you 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 start with verse 5 and we'll read to verse n ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness now this has very very uh great significance for us in this hour because we have been introduced to the day through shalom and and the rising of the Sun and recognizing your day so we're in a a distinct dis dispensation that has not been experienced within the Gentile dispensation and I think this scripture has great application for us therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober put it on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation now that hope is a future expectation uh not hoping that you're saved but it's a future anticipation of full Deliverance for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ amen you can be seated my um title today within the subject of pure joy is wide awake and this is going to be uh part one I'm was anticipating that I would cut short um in the middle of this uh the direction I was headed um but we'll just kind of maybe make a few uh read a statement towards the end and refer to something very important in the message that'll kind of give you a little bit more Direction in terms of what uh what's on my heart and what I'm looking at when we speak on this subject of wide awake and I'll try to share some things here at the outset that would kind of help us in terms of uh recognizing the continuity from one service to the next we and looking at the subject of pure joy we've been uh identifying this statement from the church age book uh in the last few Services where brother Bram says our spirit is clean and it that that to me is um a challenge many times we have so many things that kind of Muddy up our spirits and our thought process and we recognize that we're we're wrestling with uh not in a perverted way but defilements in things that just kind of hinder us and Cloud our thinking and our emotions uh so this is a promise that we can hold on to say Lord I believe this I believe that it's clean therefore Lord you can Purge it you can sanctify even our Spirits our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord so these are very important characteristics that were being that were being given the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord or joy in the Lord as the world is when it Savers and delights in its pleasures that's an outstanding statement so to whatever intensity or degree that the world is enthused about worldly things and and they become activist and they become evangelist for certain things and that's a term that's not just used within uh within christiandom and some while he's an evangelist for that and an evangelist for this uh if you mentioned that just among amongst people who are developers or Tech in technology and you say well he's an evangelist they'll say well well for what code or what program an evangelist for Microsoft or you know evangelist for this because it's a term that's used for people that are enthusiastic right developers developers developers they're really enthusiastic about about something they go out and they Inspire and they encourage and they get other people to adopt a platform and so just as much as someone can be sold out and convinced and an activist and supportive of something in the world then we ought to exceed that in terms of our dedication to the things of God and how it we are enthusiastic about it what do they say about you don't have to ask someone if they're a vegan right because they'll tell you and uh and that's how we ought to be in some ways about our passion for Christ it's not that that we would tell tell have to tell everybody but they can just tell something that they notice so this is a the parallels that brother bram's bringing and so he's making a distinction and this is important to understand about pure joy he making a distinction between the joy of the flesh enthus iasm of the flesh exuberance of the flesh Pleasures or Delights of the Flesh and the joy of the Lord because pure joy at at its core is a state of the Soul not the state of the mind I if we if we phrased joy as merely being a state of mind then our minds can change and it can become encumbered it can become cloudy and and that's a that's a part of the temple that uh can be subject to natural elements but if we recognize that our joy and the source of our pure joy is the state of the Soul then that kind of gives us some Bedrock that we know we're grounded in that in moments of instability and uncertainty we say well wait a minute let's let's refocus and recalibrate where's the source of my joy and it's a state of Soul not the state of mind now brother Branham uh is the kind of the language he's using and I want to summarize it he connects the joy of the Lord with the fresh real and clean spirit spirit this is me just kind of uh reordering the words our spirit is clean fresh real so he's taking our the joy of the Lord and he's connecting it with the spirit that is fresh real true and genuine and a clean spirit so it's it's not a flesh that has been intoxicated it's not a flesh that has been stimulated by the wrong things this isn't a hallucination this isn't some sort of uh HP hypnosis where the person is experiencing things and seeing things and that's kind of an illusion that gives them the stimulus that they're excited or enjoying something uh stimulating but this is something that's real clean and fresh and he says that the joy of the Lord is connected with the spirit that is and this is the phrase that I'd like to amplify today sober and serious and that's a that's a very uh that just even those words someone sober and serious that we can begin to kind of identify a certain personality or characteristic and I think if we do that oh he's very so somber and he's very very Stern we're actually missing the point that brother bam is making because it's not that type of disposition he's he's queuing Us in on something very scriptural that helps us to understand uh how we can experience pure joy I'd like to uh just for a moment touch on a clean conscience I am in some ways continuing on that subject of a clean conscience but this uh I think this subject of wide awake uses terminology to kind of focus us a little bit more and on the subject of a clean conscience we were looking how if I could say it this way clean conscience is a conscience that is in tune with the holy spirit that it's something that's kind of uh it's been washed by the word it's properly channeled it's looking to the things of God it's experiencing a Rejuvenation and invigoration by the things of God it's the conscience is somehow it's holding hands with the faith that's in our soul and then whenever some other disconcerting imagination uh memory reason or affection kind of comes up your conscience says well no that that that's not true or that's not right and it has a way of trying to bring Harmony amongst all the other senses and emotions in our spirit and that kind of brings us to where yeah I realize you're really really sad but the holy spirit is a comforter or I know that's really bothering you but you shouldn't uh Envy or you shouldn't lust like that and your conscience kind of becomes a a component of how this man on the inside of the inside in the engine room governs us and controls us and our conscience is the faculty of knowing what is right uh and and then also it's kind of the awareness of whether or not what we're doing agrees with what we believe so when you do something hypocritical your conscience will tell you you're a hypocrite right when you do something critical you your conscience to tell you hey you're you're that's like the pot calling the kettle black and other words you're just seeing your reflection buddy you you that's you and then you oh I shouldn't do that I shouldn't say that I shouldn't feel that way I I I and then that becomes that's what our conscience tells us so then if that becomes numb or dull or defiled as the scripture says or seared think of where that leaves a person in a very dangerous place now we looked at how our conscience is different from our Consciousness so we have a conscience as brother R said we have imagination memory reason affection and conscience all within our spirit conscience is a part of all these other uh feelings the conscience is a that's a noun it speaks to this faculty of knowing the right thing to do and guilt and and AC you know affirmation when you've done well but Consciousness relates to our feelings and our perceptions and our awareness of the world around us so right now we we ought to be conscious that we're in the middle of a church service and we're conscious of within this church service everyone's sitting down and everyone's listening and then as we're conscious of these things your conscience would tell you now's not the time to stand stand up and stretch and yawn real loud right your conscience would tell you how to act and behave within the context of the realm and the room that you are conscious of now there's there's so much that could be shared in this realm and I from some of the fellowship that I've had with the Believers on this subject since we began it a lot of you are kind of tapping into other areas in the word of God and being inspired in different ways so you see just how how much depth and bread there is to this subject but let me say your conscience and your Consciousness should be in tune or in harmony together for our hearts and our emotions to be purely on the Lord so our our state of consciousness H uh has to be in harmony with our conscience in order for there to be us to fully experience the joy of the Lord if you have a guilty conscience if you're conscious of something and you have this memory and then your conscience now working together with that produces some sort of anxiety that's going to hinder or interfere with the joy of the Lord so there's got to be Harmony uh they have to be in tune with one another your Consciousness and your conscience in tune in order for our hearts and our emotions as brother bam says should be purely on the Lord and that's part of the statement as if we read further in that uh comment from the patmas vision in the church age book The Christian's hearts and emotions are purely on the Lord so there's a stability a harmonizing and a sinking together of our conscience and Consciousness now I'll take a step further today on wide awake and let's think about the term sober and sober and serious Brother B said the believer is sober uh it the spirit is sober and serious but yet full the joy of the Lord uh to be sober it's to be moderate in desires or actions it's speaking of being temperate or restrained it speaks of being calm and quiet so this is what it means to be sober calm quiet uh moderate in desires moderate in actions restrained calm quiet not overcome by emotion so you begin to I want you to kind of pick up on this and I'm just using different definitions or meanings of this word over the last several hundred years how convenient is that so we can all some of us who are several hundred years old be like well that's the way I use that word but th this is these are ways that we can identify what the word sober means and I want you to identify how that it's relating to whether or not someone gets overstimulated by things things that kind of you know that that it causes them to go into a panic or it causes them to be really really extreme this way or really really emotional or that it it's trying to bring a stability and an evenness are it's speaking of an evenness or stability not overcome by emotion appropriately solemn appropriately serious and not in in other words not a giddy in a giddy way which is inappropriate or or insensitive it speaks of someone being a Ser a serious-minded person so this is what sober means they're moderate in their actions and their desires they're restrained they they show the appropriate restraint though even though there might be some sort of stimulus and you're excited I've mentioned it before that um as soon as my children hear about something excited they're just likeing doing doing doing and they're talking while they're doing it too the whole time are we really going to do that are we really on a vacation we're really going to get do and and it's like calm down sober up a little bit you can still be excited and you don't have to jump up and down over and over again and so this is It's and then also is saying that there's there it's an appropriate emotional response and then and then the definition also kind of captures in the idea of being serious a serious-minded person so brother B said a Believer is sober and serious so now don't all of a sudden say all right I want to be very sober very serious today and uh be quiet I'm going to be be calm I'm going to be unmoved today and then just make me suffer for the next two hours I I would recommend that you just be appropriately exuberant about the word of God so in the message so as he says serious sober and serious serious means expressing an Earnest purpose expressing an Earnest thought to be serious it's acting or speaking sincerely or earnestly so it has something to do more with genuine and something to do with a a conviction then it does just sternness or rigidness or you know I'm serious and and it kind of it's more of it again that becomes more oh he's serious he means business we could actually just be talking about maybe someone's fervency and rigidness and and harshness but this is an earnestness a a and speaking sincerely and earnestly so in order for someone to be Earnest or sincere what they're what they're thinking and how they're feeling has to comport with and agree with their conscience otherwise that's not serious that's that's hypocrisy that's intensity for the purpose of deceiving you and have you ever felt like someone was overwhelming you with facts and information and and you realize that you they were just trying to snowball me into believ in a lie they seem so serious and they had it all figured out and and so that's that's not the seriousness that the word relates to now we could take sober and serious and that phrase they're very sober and serious to mean without humor or the expression of happiness and that's one of the definitions of serus without humor or expression of happiness but that's that's not what brother Bam's identifying he says they're sober and serious when they say it's it's more rather if I could put it this way no nonsense and uh and I I meant to ask um maybe maybe brother Elliot would remember uh when we were with brother Craig bur one time and uh and we were together at a restaurant and they wanted to go sit at another table or something like that and there was a a a a TV screen that was nearby and brother Craig you just remember Josiah No Nonsense was it No Nonsense or what was it you remember yeah no see I got it right Elliot's my notebook and uh and so he's like hey No Nonsense in other words he was saying if there's anything on that television anything that comes up you turn your head young man like we don't we don't go with any kind of nonsense no any kind of frivolity anything that's inappropriate and it was a phrase that was used to convey not go over there sit down and don't have any fun with your friends and go there and sit down and be real strict and be real rigid and be self-righteous and be indignant it was like hey just remember keep yourself clean No Nonsense and when brother brandham says that our spirit should be sober and serious he's not saying it should be without humor and without the expression of Happiness he's saying there's no nonsense there's no hypocrisy there's no inappropriate stimulation that's entering in to our spirits and so when we we we we we're now we're identifying this phrase to speak about this wide awake now just take it and run with it because I'm only going to be able to cover a very small portion of this thought that lays before me this morning but and that phrase wi awake can really tune you into some things in the message that are just outstanding so if you're Wide Awake you're not numb you're not inappropriate been doled and so you're you're if you're Wide Awake you're you're aware not unaware not clueless or oblivious so this is wide awake you're you're in tune you're conscious H so you're not numb uh you're not unaware but you're you you're conscious so there's uh you're in tune to the situation the setting around you you're very conscious of things and and you're very conscious of circumstances around you and not only are you conscious of it but your understanding your understanding of what these things mean in other words you're you're um you wake up one morning and you're you're on vacation on an island in the Pacific and you walk out you're like oh wow isn't this amazing the beach is about a 100 yards deeper than I than it was before we woke up and did you notice that little slight trimmer a little bit ago and you kind of start walk man this is amazing look at these fish and you're just going to keep walking way out into the ocean you realize okay I'm aware that this is a little bit different the beach looks different this morning and there was just an earthquake and there's no waves coming in and all immediately you become conscious of the situation then you begin to get understanding that could this be a tsunami me right this is this is and you begin to identify certain things and then you're engaged you're active you're responsive to those things and so this is when you're wide awake you you're you're you're conscious of things around you you're understanding of what these things around you mean and you're engaged you're appropriately responsive and proactive considering the things that are taking place so wide awake is a reference to our conduct and our attitude and that our conduct our attitude our conduct and even our character is appro for the moment it's appropriate for the situation that we're responding the right way given the circumstances we're doing the right thing considering uh uh the stimulus that's being input the things that we're being challenged with you understand uh maybe in just a general sense what I mean by wide awake I I I'll give this example we had we built a really beautiful home by the grace of God and with uh and with my dad's help of course I always joked with them it was the last time I build a fixer uper but uh we uh we we we had a we built a nice home and the alarm system that got put in it was one that talks to you and so one night in the middle of the night like 3:00 in the morning all of a sudden someone started telling me there was a fire in the house it was fire and so I got up not quite awake so I jumped up and all I can muster is I'm running out the do the fire slow motion so I chew on my tongue as I M you know yell to Elizabeth but there's a fire and I ran smack into my dresser cuz I wasn't wide awake yet I was in full control of my of my tongue and full control of my legs and so that that's what that would be so you're not quite awake yet and that's the excuse we use sometimes we do something silly in the morning what do we say I'm not wide awake yet I'm not all there my mind's not my my mind hasn't caught up with my body and so this is this is what is meant in a natural way by wide awake but let's start making a spiritual application a real practical application of wide awake if you could turn to our text 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 I'll start with verse 6 Paul is already established uh that we are not of the night nor of we of the darkness we are children of light Children of the day so then with that as a premise he says therefore let us not sleep as do others and this sleep means slothful when he says let us not sleep as do others it speaks of being in a state of indifference ah doesn't matter it doesn't don't don't really care it's more of an apathy and an indifference and if you're not careful apathy sometimes can look a lot like somebody uh uh who is confident apathy someone says they they we think oh this is Faith but what we talking about before it's really not Faith you're just numb you're not responding appropriately to the situation because you're completely numb you're not moved anymore you don't care you know it doesn't matter to you I you know this has happened so many times you might as well just expect it and you just kind of become numb to it it's kind of like all of us right now when it comes to Summers and Phoenix right but yeah you know what this is just how it is and that's not what faith is that's not what uh real uh real Consciousness is so he's saying let us not sleep or be slothful or indifferent and what he's identifying is this Darkness he'll come to it again here in the morning in a moment how this there's a state of Darkness that speaks of being ignorant and and and the the language is being used he says let's not be of a drowsy frame of mind kind of just drowsy and not really alert not really all there just kind of kind of those cobwebs that we have in the morning he says don't let us sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober this is the Commandment twist watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night now he is using something that's very natural when he uses this in verse seven he's using it in a very literal sense that literally people sleep at night and people get drunk at night this is a generalization and and he's so he's you he's looking at the actual sleep and drunkenness takes place in the evening and the night time and he's using this to ponder well if that's what people do in the natural then what ought we to be doing in a spiritual sense in a spiritual frame of mind and so when he's talking about sleepiness or drunkenness he's talking about an apathy to u to serious things an indifference towards things that really matter so this is a drowsiness a sleepiness an apathy an insincerity towards things that are spiritually important to towards things that matter like this ought to matter and and this should this should mean something and you ought to be fully aware of that and you that you ought to care and that that should be important to you versus I well you know it doesn't matter and this kind of apathy or this drowsiness or this insincerity and and that uh well I'll maybe hold that thought for later recognize this is kind of what he's he's this is exactly what he's identifying is an apathy a drowsiness and indifference kind of a sloppiness on one hand where he says we ought to be awake we ought to be active so he says but let us verse eight who are of the day be sober and now this soberness is active put it on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet put it on the helmet the hope of Salvation it's forward-looking it's anticipating it it's a breastplate of faith and love a helmet of for the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed us to wrath with an understanding of what the future is future Victory is Victory now Victory head is Victory now so with this hope of full deliverance and Redemption and salvation we recognize by predestination we're anchored upon this election we're headed towards our destiny God hath not appointed us to judgment and wrath but he's appointed us ordained us predestin us to fully possess salvation by by our Lord Jesus Christ so with this soberness with this sober mind there's a preparedness and we're making ready appropriately there's an appropriate preparation in terms of what we know is ahead of us it's the helmet of the hope for the hope for helmet we're put on the hope of Salvation in other words this is the mind said in an attitude that there's full Deliverance coming I'm protected a breastplate of faith and love these are things that H uh speak to our protections but also our destiny because God hath appointed us it's a beautiful beautiful uh scriptures isn't it these things are beautiful to read now to I I want to go through some statements very quickly scriptures very quickly I have several in front of me just identify this subject of soberness and how important it is to the believer's walk now if we thought that soberness merely meant absence from wine or absence from things that intoxicate us and you thought that's all it meant then no wonder all of us kind of thought man I'm I'm carrying my 30-year sober token in the message uh soberness means more than you know uh drinking uh alcohol not drinking alcohol Romans chapter 13:1 and that knowing the time so knowing the time having an understanding of the time being conscious of the time being s sensitive to the time he says that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation near than when we believed this is Paul Now using a similar language as he's telling the Thessalonians let us not sleep because this isn't night if it's day we ought to be awake and here's the here's the the Paul again saying it to the Romans it's time for us to wake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed now what salvation is that Paul is not setting forth this idea that you that this is those who are believing and now there's still a Salvation to come related to the soul he's saying that those who believe the Seal of your faith is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so if you truly believe you are going to be born again by the Holy Ghost and then those who are sealed into the body of Christ ought to be very aware of and conscious of the fact that that's not the end of salvation but that is a deposit or a guarantee or as the scripture says an Earnest of the fullness of redemption so when you recognize the time that you're living in there should be some sensitivity to see that if I was sealed by God ex date I am now closer to the fullness of the possession of what that Earnest speaks of than I was when I started and how much more should we be sensitized to that today as we continue in this glor glorious gospel awake out of sleep for now is our full salvation and Redemption nearer than when we believ so there is a consciousness of time there's a consciousness of Prophecy within the context of that and being conscious of the time knowing that now is the time and this is the time that we're living knowing the time understand the time knowing that it's high time to what wake up wake up out of sleep slumberous this uh drowsiness of Mind into difference and apathy well it doesn't really matter who cares and why why make that a big deal says it to the Ephesians Ephesians 5:14 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest drawing from Old Testament awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead awake you know stand up prepare yourself be ready be alert be on guard be active awake thou that sleepest and arise there's even this symmetry where the the word awake comes from the root from to rise up to arous out of sleep and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light to put you in the day and if it's daytime the time dictates the action it what is the first thing we say when we text somebody after 10 o00 usually right are you awake are you expecting a no the answer really what we're want to find out is did I wake you you know were you asleep because if somebody answers the phone or answers the text and says they're still sleeping then they have figured out multitasking they really have and so it's a it's appro it's activity that's appropriate for the time and the season well to me that is just so rich uh to ponder that so he says in first Thessalonians we could see here he's using this theme awake awake awake so the state the phrase is watch and be sober watch be vigilant be cautious yet active don't be paralyzed don't be so ner you know so in tune and so alert and so conscious that you don't do anything be vigilant be cautious yet active it says be sober that's calm and collected in mind and spirit because they that sleep sleep in the night but they that act act in the day so be aware of the time be aware of what the time requires and the need requires and then be active in that within that be at be be sure to whatever the uh time demands you have you put forth the actions and the activity that's demanded by the circumstances so be sober he says watch and be sober Peter was very fond of that phrase he uses it a few times in his first letter First Peter chapter 5:8 this may be one of the most uh identifiable ones be sober be vigilant it's actually the same phrase that Paul uses watch and be sober same words that are being used why why should I why should I be sober why should I be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a Roy and lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour so because of the circumstances because of the situation we ought to be sober be vigilant so notice how that on one hand he's not saying there is no devil right he's not saying there's no trouble there's no problems you don't have anyone that hates you everyone loves you nobody's putting you down everybody wants you to succeed and everybody loves you everybody likes you and forget you know stop singing that tune nobody likes me I'm going to go eat some worms everybody loves you everybody likes you you're the star of the show the whole world revolves around you Paul's not you Peter's not using that to kind of get that person kind of Pumped up and all excited to go out and face the day you know that's what happens when people say you can do this you can do this you can do this you really think I can jump over that yeah you can do it you can do it you can jump over it make sure you're filming this you can do it go for it make you can do it and someone yeah I can do it I can do it just runs head long into the wall because that was some kind of inflated sense it was a pump and dump it was got them all excited when the real Goods weren't there so he says be sober be vigilant because you got somebody that's taking advantage of every opportunity to get in there and weaken your mind he's looking for every exploitable advantage and he'll trip you up if he can and he'll flip your mind around and he'll turn circumstances upside down he's just sitting there waiting for the right opportunity and as soon as you let your guard out boom he's right there so Paul said you got to be you got to watch you got to be sober and and he's already used this phrase to a degree in Chapter 1: 13 wherefore gird up the loin of your mind and one of the my most F favorite statements I ever heard in church was Loy up your GS wherefore G up the loins of your mind be sober in hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ be sober and with soberness hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ now hey talk about shouting words the Revel of Jesus Christ brings Grace Grace the revelation of Jesus Christ is The Headstone coming to the body declaring that the Rapture is at hand and so we're living in a specific season where the believer's disposition and their character is not so much in the hope of something but in the reality and the full possession and realization of it so if Paul could say G up the loins of your mind be sober and hope then we who are experiencing the Fulfillment of of this hope and it's unfolding to us in the revelation of Jesus Christ then there's a greater soberness and appropriate activity within the awareness of the reality of the Revelation that is unfolding before us praise be to God he visits it again in chapter 4: 7 but the end of all things is at hand now they lived in this time in this day where they they believed this to be Earnest and earnestly believed that this was imminent but the end of all things is at hand well if we have a devil that's chasing us we have a revelation that's coming to us and if the end of all things are at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer sometimes we say well pray pray pray pray pray well how are you praying what is the praying doing to your spirit do we pray to become more numb more inactive more dull that Lord I don't want this to bother me I don't want this to bother me don't I don't want it to bother me I don't want it to bother me and maybe the Lord's saying hi about asking why it's bothering you instead of you know always saying be quiet be quiet that doesn't make me feel good try to find out why the dog's barking this this is a very difficult exercise for people who've been doing this for decades but you got to go wake up that beaten down very very old blood hound and say Hey you remember how you used to bark at me all the time what were you worried about what was it what was the Lord trying to show me what was he trying to warn me of because now I feel like I'm on an island I'm lost I I don't understand what things are happening I don't know why I feel the way I do and you have to begin to examine your Consciousness your conscience to identify what it was so this is a very beautiful way that he's saying this sober be there you therefore sober and watch unto prayer and above all things and I kept this verse in there because I wanted you to notice that it's not a uh uh to be complacent and kind of no energy and like what we really want the word to do is kind of lull us to sleep keep preaching by there and I'm almost there says and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves wow can I pull a Joe Biden no I won't do it that's just a very found statement it hits me a little bit differently now as I read it above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins this is not apathy this is not turning a blind eye this is not saying it doesn't matter but this is also not exposing for the sake of demoralizing and shaming and producing guilt above all things have fervent charity among yourselves the soberness and watching does not produce a bunch of complacent dumb down mindless individual uals who have no emotion no joy no exuberance but he's saying above all things have a fervent charity so we can be so we can be watching and be sober but yet be passionate at the same time be energetic and be enthused at the same time and let me say this these qualities of vigilance and soberness are the building blocks of joy and peace to have soberness and vigilance these are the things that make up these are the ingredients for real joy and real peace be because it's not it's not disassociation this is It's we're not trying to create a disorder amongst message Believers where we' so disassociate from reality we're living in a total alternate reality in order to act like everything's great by my Lord K by completely disassociated living Liv in in an insanity but we are taught that we ought to be sane and sensible there there's something real about us to where we have this we're not so disconnected from things and things aren't so foreign to we don't have the ability to help anybody we don't have the ability to relate to anybody we don't have a feeling for people who go through things oh you struggle with that oh Ser SE if I've ever heard one be be have a feeling for somebody oh man I you know what I've never been through something like that before but that that's got to be horrible this is this is very heavy stuff when you begin to ponder it there must be be a vigilance and there must be a soberness in order for you to really have peace you can't have peace just because you have no clue that's not real peace that's called cluelessness you can't have real Joy just because you choose to be ignorant of everything and that's what I'm going to amplify for our remaining time is that exact mindset and how counterproductive it is to really being happy in the Lord so these uh I want you to really I want this to weigh in you when brother man says we are sober and serious I want you to see the importance of these characteristics a and and to do so I want you to catch the emphasis in requirements for church office if someone is going to occupy a position within the body of Christ there's certain think about this you ready emotional characteristics and characteristics that relate to someone's temperament in order for them to be effective regardless of their gift and their calling Paul does not just say hey find a man who's called to be a pastor and gifted to be a pastor and make that man your pastor he says look at certain temperaments look at certain qualities look at certain characteristics I heard one Pastor one time say voting a guy that owns a truck so he can help you move and that was what he thought would be important if you're voting on someone to be Pastor make sure they own a pickup truck so that they can help you move and that's like one of the main reasons why a lot of us don't own a pickup truck because we don't want people to ask us to move we should create an Uber for moving a moving company call it moover muber could you get on that register the domain right now thank you Micah could you put up a shopping cart we wanted to go ahead and start taking reservations excellent who's moving so I want you to identify the emphasis now when someone is going to occupy a position and how relevant it was to their effectiveness in office that they have a certain disposition everyone can relax now right because we're talking about the officers huh you can just you can just think about me for a moment and ask yourselves 1 Timothy chapter 3:2 a bishop then must be blameless that's why I always say my wife did it a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife these are important characteristics why would they ask why would you want a pastor to be the pastor of one wife because if he's going to teach truth he's going to teach others to never do such a thing as that and how can he teach it if his life is contrary to it and not undermine it actions will undermine your words when someone tells you what to do and they say well just do what I'm telling you don't do as I do do as I say that undermines the the discipline so that must be blameless the husband of one wife Vigilant sober notice these characteristics that he's using of one that's to be a bishop he's to be vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality apt to teach so we know sometimes it says well deacons should be apt to teach uh those were in the bylaws of the brandom Tabernacle I believe they had some association with uh um the Baptist organization he was originally part of and some of those things where they say a deacon must be apt to teach and some people say well brother Aaron the Bible says a deacon must be apt to teach no the bylaws of the brandom Tabernacle said it and the Bible says a bishop ought to be apt to teach now I'm not saying that uh uh that there's anything wrong with saying a deacon should be or having that qualification for a deacon but this is where we get the phrase from apt to teach right you've heard the phrase before has anyone told you that brother brandham said or the message says a deacon should be apt to teach you ever heard that before I heard some yeses I heard some notes should we vote on this do you have someone record this take the minutes this is where it comes from it comes from the scripture and then it's in the bylaws of the brandom Tabernacle it says that about a deacon but it's not necessarily explicitly mentioned in the message by preaching or in the Bible so this is said about the pastor he should be vigilant sober now he says this to Titus Titus Chapter 1: 7 and 8 for a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God so these things are really important not self-willed not soon angry not given to whne no Striker these are things he can't be easily provoked you know going to ball up his fist he's going to punch you kind of known to be a striker a brawler not soon angry he's he's got a a disposition a temperament says you know what I I'm feeling a little bit excited right now calm yourself calm yourself don't punch don't hit you know and as long as he doesn't I guess you could say this is a man who can control himself no Striker not given to Filthy lcer but a lover of hospitality find that these the same things he said to Timothy a lover of Good Men he's got discernment he he he identifies and supports and is surrounded by the right kind of men there's just not a you real look at gu say kind of known by the people he Associates with and but he says and then sober just holy temperate so when it comes to a bishop as we would say taught by the message of the hour and the understanding of scripture this would be a pastor he should be vigilant this is attentive watchful he's risen up from slothfulness and laziness or drowsiness he's taking he's not letting things go and and being unattentive he's Vigilant and sober and mentioned again to tit he must be sober I'm going to get into the definitions of these words here in a moment but notice this relates to what we would say is the highest order within the church soberness is required but it doesn't just relate to the pastor look at 1 Timothy 3:1 even so must their wives you know who there is here the deacons wow this is amazing the pastors got to be sober and the Deacon's wives need to be sober I says their wives must their wives must be grave not slanderers sober so in the qualifications for a man to be a deacon he must be the husband of one wife but then also his wife must not be a slanderer a busy body a gossiper someone who's always running down and criticizing but she must also be sober now let's just for a moment just think about this and say why is it the way that it is why are things this way and I think that's a real popular thing today is um why the the the the science of why not how and people are saying well we know how things are made this way and we know that this is the way things are and this is how they make them but why did they start doing this to begin with you know why are certain things around whereas other things are are square with within a supermarket and you'll find that there's typically and most often a a an economic justification as to why things are the way they are relates to economies and efficiencies and a and profit margins and the best way to do things and best practices well in a spiritual sense Paul is identifying that if our our goal is a Rapture then there's a way that we can set this up come on now I'm G start leg kicking that there's a way that you can set this up to most efficiently bring the individual to perfect Faith but if you set it up incorrectly all you're doing I I don't care if the church thrives and builds a billion dollar building that's uh that everyone pays Bitcoin in whole amount on Sundays and tithes and and that that it's plated in Gold yeah you could have a church like that but if the individuals are going to make it in a body change this is how you want to set it up if families are going to grow in the fear of the Lord if children going to come to know God in a personal way this is the best way to set it up to be sure that human humanism a and politics and pretense and emotions and all sorts of things don't get in the way make sure your pastor's sober and make sure the Deacon's wife is sober make sure these characteristics and qualities exist and there's a lot more I'm just picking on soberness there's a lot more here so all of us who are not deacons wives which would be everybody here at this point and those of us who are not pastors can breathe a sigh of relief as we pick on pastors and deacons wives for the rest of the service but as he said it about a bishop must be vigilant and sober he continues in verse uh uh verse 11 how that the wives must also of a deacon must be sober in Titus Chapter 1 where he said that a bishop must be blameless not self-willed not soon angry not a striker uh but sober he continues in chapter two and says that the Aged men be sober so now every member of the church that is an aged man must be sober and then it also speaks in verse four that they the older women May teach the young women to be sober and the word that's used suggests that the aged women themselves being sober know how to teach the younger to be sober so the Aged men must be sober the aged women which would be implied even to some degree about a Deacon's wife must be sober and her being a sober woman in the church she also carries this disposition as a Deacon's wife or in the role of a pastor's wife you name it in any office because the Aged men must be sober the aged women must be sober the young women must be sober so all of us young men are beginning to breathe a ey of relief until we read verse six young men likewise to exhort to be sober minded in other words Paul has made it a necessary requirement in order to be a part of not only the body of Christ but a healthy contributing healthy me functioning member of a local body that you must be sober you must be sober you must be sober we all must be sober men women young old middle age we all must be sober all of us must be we don't just say well you know brother Aaron he's the pastor he needs to be sober and I can just be loose cannon over here no we all must be sober we have a kind of a saying that we say in our house when things are kind of going off the rails that wouldn't be in the house it would be when we were driving we would do tens of thousands of miles a year uh driving in the ministry which I express to somebody yesterday those days are over for me all right someone said they wanted to take my passport you can have it you can have it if someone wants to hear me preach they can come to Phoenix as far as I'm concerned and and so we would be driving on the road and all of a sudden you just realize okay we've just kind of Hit the Tipping Point and I would say we're all struggling because we were right we were all struggling and and that would identify that none of us kind of have the right attitude right now and kind of with that understanding we yeah we're all struggling and we kind of got along then because we all could identify with the fact that we're all struggling very wise move on my part but we should all say we're all sober that that's how we ought to say as a church is not just any one person is the sober one in the group and they're the ones that's grounded and they're the ones that are rational the Bible is actually taking this disposition of being sober and being vigilant and saying not only should it be in the highest order of the church and then in these other layers and I don't necessarily like to put them in a hierarchy but in these other beneficial mutually uh dependent offices everyone needs to be sober now let me just go through really there's two different words that are used for sober in the New Testament but there's a few different conjugations of them uh uh as they're used scripturally sober means to be of a sound mind Saye think about this in one senses so they have their senses active in being used and now being of a sound mind and in one senses they are self-controlled and able to curb their desires and impulses so if you are sober you can receive the correct kind of stimulus from things but you're appropriately unstimulated in terms of and not intoxicated or inappropriately moved to where you can control your impulses and control your response soberness means whoa that is scary but I'm not going to scream and run or that is an awful situation and the horror of this circumstance you realize it you you're not somebody that says did you hear that brother ricard's house burnt down so we're Christians you know the Lord gives and he takes away and kind of have like this Indi you think oh my goodness that's awful oh wow man oh Lord to help them to know that even in this there's good and that God can he'll bring something out of this and like and we even be sensitive and where you know what some of these words might be real Hollow right now some of these things might be real empty they'll probably just take it as rebuke if I'm texting them now well you know brother brandham said and you know this and you know that that they're realizing yeah I know all that I know all that but this is hard there's a soberness there it comes from the word to save to make whole and then another word to be understanding and perceiving safron comes from Soo save or to make whole in friend which means understanding and perceiving to be sober it's this wholeness that is both understanding and perceiving but then restrained at the same time the word is used sober to be of sound mind to exercise self-control it's also used to of Neo to be calm and collected in spirit to be temperate uh or dispassionate and it's talking about unreasonably it doesn't mean you can't have a fervent charity it doesn't mean you can't be excited doesn't mean you can't be exuberant but it's it's not the wrong kind of uh reaction to a certain stimulus or stimulated by the wrong things it's used also to be sober means to restore to his senses to restore one so foro restore one to his senses to moderate to control to curb or to disciple when it says that the the Elder women ought to teach the young women to be sober it says teach them to be restored to their senses teach them to to to control and to curb and when it's used in the sense that we might automatically begin to think used with regard to implying the absence from wine what is it pointing to the wrong kind of stimulation or the perverting of our senses by a stimulus that excit certain emotions and senses and dos others like there's some people that when when when we were in the world we knew people and maybe we were we were the angry drunk right can I get a witness you're exercising soberness today that was me that was me I was angry drunk no you're just kind of all yeah knew that guy and there's others who are the crying drunk that normally they're maybe they're not real talkative but all of a sudden you get a little alcohol right they just start talking away and a lot of times in these kind of dynamics that you'd have you'd have the real straight lace conservative the guy who was raised in the Bible believing Church never did anything wrong but now he's in the fraternity and he's real straight Lac and he was the guy that once he got drunk he did the most damage did the most awful things and the worst things it's like whoa he's a different person I even reading an article here recently about a guy who had a different name whenever he got drunk people like well who's Timothy well it's Paul but whenever he gets drunk we call Timothy I think might have been the actual words that were used and so when it's talked about soberness as relating to a stimulus like wine why is it called soberness because there's certain things that are whether it be edible or whether it be digestible whether it be you know injected or snorted or drank or or whatever it might be it actually sensitizes and stimulates other parts of our body but at the same time it has a side effect of ding other Parts like you realize like C certain painkillers it actually doesn't take away the pain it just kind of turns off the pain receptors like you realize your leg is broken no I took ibuprofen it's it's fine isn't that amazing what what the these pills can do these days I mean I had a broken leg I took some ibuprofen and now it's completely fine you have to be careful a lot of times with painkillers and numbing agents why you can do further damage to your body because you're not aware of the trauma and not aware of the impact that the problem's still there you just become oblivious to it so with regard to implying absence be sober and it implies an abstinence from wine there's a very direct specific application that we could use of that but now I want you to think in terms of the reason why that's used is because it relates to what real soberness is that you're in all of your senses are correctly identifying certain things and you're able to curb and control yourself at the same time so soberness my my my my my my where is the time gone this is frustrating I even used a bigger font with my quotes and scriptures so that I would cover up more pages and have the feeling that I had more notes than I actually did and I feel like such a failure soberness is an alertness soberness is an awareness I'm using the phrase Wide Awake that we ought to be wide awake where all of our faculties are unaltered all of our faculties are functioning and when I say that you say well brother Aaron I'm hard of hearing in one are I'm talking spiritually more than anything I'm talking about spiritually being Wide Awake watch and be sober the Bible says be sober be vigilant the Bible says let us be calm wise and wide awake how one translation actually renders it using one of these phrases in Peter let us be calm wise and wide awake it's the notion of being roused from a slumbering state it speaks of recover recovering from a dullness or being disoriented as we've been talking about Israel as they were in The Exodus they collided with Moab and whenever the spiritual meets the car the carinal there's a collision and sometimes in that conclusion we can be a little bit concussed and we we don't know how many fingers are being held up and we don't know where we are but that concussion has to be resolved it has to go away we have to pass the concussion protocol and be declared available to serve and to function and to be what God has called us to be we there's a time comes for all of us where we come off the spiritual injured list and we get back into AC of Duty because God is able we're not just using a bunch of excuses but if if you're in this state of disorientation and you've been struck and you've been wounded then there's a care for that there's a concern for that and there's those of us who can be on the front line fighting the battle while you get well in the medical tent and there's no jealousy or bitterness and there's no judgment because we've all been there before if if you say you haven't you just forgot or you're one of the worst wounded on the front line and it might do you some good to pull back and get the healing you need watch and be sober be sober be vigilant the word for Vigilant it speaks of this being awakened watch comes from the root I mentioned earlier to raise up to Rouse from sleep to the Colossians chapter 4:2 continue in prayer and watch in the same with Thanksgiving amen now think about that continue in prayer and watch in the same it's not just a praying praying is not the a the activity of sticking our head in the sand and ignoring what's going on he's saying we ought to continue in prayer and watch continue prayer and watch in the same let our prayer Be watchful Let It Be observant Let It Be Discerning Let It Be Something That We're Not just praying and we're praying ignorantly but there's a soberness there there's a serious there there's a vigilance there's been an Awakening our prayer is not what we do to put ourselves as sleep but praying is what we do to put us on a greater state of alertness maybe that's why when we pray sometimes it's the time we take our nap unintentionally right I don't know what it was but I promised I was going to pray all day and I slept all day I'm going to go seek the Lord by dream now I'm I need to skip I'm going to skip M Mark chapter 14 or as we say in North Peoria Mack chapter 14 Mark chapter 14 I'm going to skip that but I want you to ponder it as Jesus has asked his disciple to pray and he says watch you and pray they fall asleep he's like can't you just stay away for an hour I just I want to skip it and I want to well let me just keep figure out where I'm at in all this um I'm going to skip a lot you ever heard the phrase ignorance is bliss if you don't know about it you don't have to worry about it you want to ask questions you don't want you don't really want the answer to I want to I want to spend more time next time on this phrase but there's actually a phrase that's used in literature and it was with respect to a totalitarian government and they had a phrase called ignorance is strength and it was used as a part of a getting the people just to never question question authority and to be able to hold two thoughts in your mind that were completely impossible and you wouldn't just believe that one was true and the other one was false but you could bring yourself to believe that both were true even though you knew they weren't talk about a crazy way the or Willian a dystopian future that was being talked about the double think that people could say absolutely yeah that's true I believe this and then something be done or said that's AB absolutely contrary to that and they yeah but that's true and that's good too and to get to that point where the people didn't just accept it but they literally believed that 2 plus 2 equals 5 and in in this novel and I find myself getting pulled right into it to share more of it but they had this phrase ignorant is strength and it was joined with war is Peace and Freedom is slavery to get the people to believe that if you're constantly in the state of War that's peace and to believe that if you're enslaved that's actually freedom and so in order to really complete the full bringing people under control and subjugating them to to totalitarian way of thinking they had to take them to believe that ignorance is strength if you're ignorant that is a strength I I want you to think let me say it this way I um I'm just being very very purposeful right now and very deliberate in what I choose to say because I I I want to get into this in Greater detail perhaps next Sunday but what's being identified in this natural thing I'm using I'm looking at a lit literary uh a book that was written that described these things and as a response to Rising socialism and communism and maybe some commentary even on Nazism and it was it spoke of a totalitarian government which is a system of government that is centralized in dictatorial it's you know centered around a dictator dictatorial and requires complete subservience to the state complete total subservience to the state to the government to the head that everything had to be completely subservient now I could take more time getting into the specifics of the natural phenomena or even this phenomena in literature but let me just say it perfectly describes Satan's kingdom Satan's kingdom can only be established through lies and deceit and so for there to be a totalitarian government the people have to think that war is peace freedom is slavery and that ignorance is strength because you have to make them ignorant you have to get them to believe a lie you have to get them to be able to accept double think and news speak to say well that's true but this is also true that if someone was in their right mind they'd say no they both can't can't be true freedom is not slavery war is not peace ignorance is not strength and there's a way of War of Attrition to break a person down for they exist within a man-made system and a cult of personality and say well yeah that's true but this is also true and somehow they both can AG exist within a person's mind is absolutely true when they both are completely incompatible and that's how Satan accomplishes his agenda that's Satan's kingdom that's Satan's way that is Satan's order and his order is a perversion of God's order so Satan establishes his kingdom upon lies and deceits and that ignorant strength but God establishes his kingdom in truth he says and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free let me say this that Joy is not possible without truth he said Joy is not only impossible with truth is the most important resource for it you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free your joy can't be prefaced by a lie your joy can't be prefaced on a half truth in order for you to have full Joy it has to be full knowing fully aware fully cognizant not ignorant but willful ignorance ignores discomforts ignores inconsistencies disregards pain in order to force Harmony in order to make the person feel stable in order to make the person feel safe and feel secure as one phrase is if one is not concerned with truth one's existence assumes an unreflective contentment when you stop caring about the truth and you care more about church you'll have an unreflective contentment about everything that goes on when you stop loving truth in believing in truth more than just position and power and politics and preest when you stop loving truth you may say you're happy but it's prefaced on ignorance is strength war is peace and you know you know what uh part of the party that uh established the The Motto ignorance is truth the ministry or ignorance is strength the ministry of Truth in this book that spent engaged its whole time in revising history to always fit the current Party Line go back and change things change the order change the history change the theology change the beliefs called the ministry of truth but it's dedicated to changing things into a lie there was the ministry of love you know what its sole function was to torture people who did Love there was the ministry of Peace you know what it sole goal was to perpetuate War now you say well brother Aaron that that that's a fantastic novel I had to read that in college use some discernment and recognize how that not only is that a critique of uh certain types of government and structure in the natural world but it could be used just as much as a criticism of what Christianity has become and what church has become and how we become sheeple or sheep and not in a good sense because God's kingdom must be established on truth and sometimes people say that they're happy but there's the Bible says you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free people are not happy they're just unaware at best or willfully ignorant at worst they just don't really know point I'm trying to make as I need to move on and I'll amplify this further if the Lord would lead me to the world society structures governments Powers will try to manufacture happiness through ignorance through dullness that that in order to have control complete subservice to the system complete uh uh uh faithfulness unquestioned authority to an order to a structure but Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter 15: 33-34 he says be not deceived evil Communications corrupt good manners awake to righteousness and sin can not in order to to walk in perfect faith in order to have this nature and character on display we have to awake to righteousness for some have not the knowledge of God and I speak this to your shame he's saiding return to soberness of Mind return oneself from a drunkenness from an intoxication from an influence from a power that's perverted your understanding perverted your discipline perverted verted your relationship to Christ perverted your relationship to one another awake to righteousness and sin not get a hold of yourselves Shake yourselves Corinthians do you not realize you've been overcome with the wrong things awake to righteousness then you can act the right way it's not a matter of dulling our senses and becoming subject to the wrong kind of ideals in order for there to be order and the appearance of Harmony and everyone is happy right everyone is happy everyone's happy everyone say yes but a true Liberation by truth we know the truth the truth made us free you do realize this yes I know it despite my knowledge of that I found something deeper I found something greater yes I know yes I know yes I know and there doesn't have to be all these mechanisms at work trying to produce a forced obedience at the end of the day to produce a forced happiness I hope that you can be uh spiritual about this because ignorance is not Bliss that's a lie and in Luke 15: 17 to 18 it tells the story about the prodical son and in this story he had wasted all his living and and I imagine that when he be did it at the beginning there might have been part of his conscience that told him you know you're not doing the right thing but his dad lets him go and takes his part of his inheritance and he goes and he Wast all of it and riotous living and then having lost all of his substance he has to become a slave in a foreign country in order to get some sort of renumeration or income or be able to survive and he's out feeding pigs and I imagine by that point his mind had become so dull and so hardened and he runs so far from conviction he's this numb person existing in this swine pit in there wanting to eat the husk and eat the things that pigs eat and then it says in verse 17 and when he came to himself you know what that this phrase means he sobered up whatever had been influencing him before if it was bitterness towards his dad if it was jealousy of his brother if it if it was ambition if it was if it was alcohol and all the influences of the world and he had numbed himself and become dull he says and he came to his self it means he sobered up he came to his senses when he began to think clearly when he began to think appropriately when he was aware not only of his circumstances but aware of other opportunities and other circumstan when he came to himself notice how clear he begins to think how many hired Servants of my fathers have bred enough in Despair and I perish with hunger here's here's the awaking this is the waking up and the vigilance I will arise how wide awake would he he been if he thought that and stayed in the hog pin not completely not totally he still would have been a little bit drunk he still would have been a little bit intoxicated he still would have been laboring under certain hindrances but when he came to himself fully came to himself I will arise and go to my father and I will say unto him noce the evidence of a sober mind the appropriate thought father I have sinned against heaven and before thee and in no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants and it was when he came to himself and arose from that state and came to the father in the appropriate state of mind that he experienced the feast and the celebration of one that was being restored and I want you to ponder this I want him to come to a place of finishing today that in order for him he would have never experienced the joy of restoration if he had not first experienced the horrors of realizing his sin he never could have enjoyed restoration he never could have enjoyed Redemption he never would have had that robe he never would have had that ring he never would have had that Feast unless he first experienced the full and the weight and the reality of what he had done he didn't get drunk one day off the strongest liquor and go back to his father and say you know give me my room back and the law it says I'm your son no matter what let me come back some sort of presumption and arrogance but no he had to First with the sanness of Mind in his emotions feel the whr of sin and realizing it once he realized that in the soberness of mind he went to the one who could remedy it he had the appropriate humility he had the right kind of attitude in light of the circumstances father I'm not worthy to become I'm not worthy to be your son let me be a servant and now notice the father's response to his sober son who's obviously no longer thinking with the same mind that caused him to go he sees it remedied he sees it changed he could have said the son that left was half dead already with a mindset like that but he went out and fully died but now he saw a son that was yet dead but now is alive because he's come back to his mind he has a son that he had lost the enjoyment of long before he ever took that napsack in the inheritance and ran out of the world and once the son soed up the father got his son back let me say though they can have application in a lot of different ways without the horrors of sin he would have never ever ever sought the Comforts of home without the horrors of what he' done he would have never longed for the Forgiveness of a father does that not speak to that subject of numb does not help us understand what it would mean to be wide awake pure joy is found in being Wide Awake pure joy is found in a healthy conscience and being fully conscious we can experience the calm amid a storm we can we can experience peace in the middle of chaos we don't console ourselves with a delusion we don't Comfort ourselves with an illusion we know the truth we know the reality we know what's going on we can appreciate these different things so let me say this this is how it struck me so hard yesterday our joy is irrational to the world and I'm going to end on this I'm skipping several scriptures here so we're probably just going to come to that last statement our joy is irrational but only to the world because our joy is not based on ignorance we're not believing ignorance is bliss we don't believe that ignorance is strength we have a contentment that defies human nature we we have a peace that as the Bible says is beyond our understanding and what does that mean it doesn't mean a disassociation it doesn't mean a Detachment to have a peace that passes understanding doesn't mean that you pass from a sanness and sensibilities and you no longer know and you're now ignorant and you're dumbed down and you're D it's like you know this is a Raging Sea you you know that this is bad you know that that is not good you know the consequences of that you feel the buffeting you feel the hate you feel the persecution you feel the sorrow you feel the grief you it's in other words you're not ignorant say I don't want to know I don't want to know too late I already know cat out of the bag I'm fully aware and we're not beating ourselves up about the fact that we know this and we're conscious of that is that not where the devil tries to get us well if you really had Faith you wouldn't even know it hurt what come on where we get that idea brother BR even talking about being able to overcome something he says oh you you see you say you don't have cancer he says yes you do how you going to believe to be healed from it if you want to keep denying you've got it how is a sinner going to be in a sinful State say I'm Justified I'm Justified I'm Justified and somehow experience justification doesn't work that way so our our our peace in this world is not based upon a lie or a delusion you remember where we ended last time on how that Paul was talking about how that and we were using the emphasis and the point to say that as he was using the scripture in meets he was showing us that things that are not true defiles a believer's conscience that here's a born again holy spirit filled believer but yet him believing in something that was a lie would defile his conscience and how that God wants to deal with the untruths God wants to deal with the lie so you say well brother Aaron what does this mean in the practical application because there's certain things I can't deny there's certain things that I know are true but this is where we need the whole truth that I was a sinner but now you're saved I did it but in his mind you never did it in the first place and there's a word answer to any lie anything that the devil can bring up and that's what grounds Us in true Joy is not denying what has been but in accepting your appr appropriation or the very thing that remedies it you can have perfect faith and accept the fact that you're sick but perfect faith is I believe I am healed because think about isn't what the that's exactly what the world would do you have cancer well I don't have cancer I don't have cancer everybody's trying to tell you you've got cancer I don't have cancer I don't have cancer you believe it you go in you get a you get an MRI they do a scan they do a blood test and the doctor says you don't have cancer and you go I'm Healed he's like nuh no uhuh you never had to begin that you're like no no no I was healed no you told me yourself you didn't have it and guess what you're right you beat the doctors you never even had cancer to begin with Checkmate right the bride's the bride's basis is not a lie she's not standing on some half truth she's not the system of some party that's made her subservient just to believe things just because she's told these things she knows she's fully aware she's not she's not a Christ without the knowledge of a a Judas just loving everybody and everything's awesome she knows who the Judas is but nobody can tell because she doesn't call them out should I have to make a public scene or an example that may just wet your whistle for the next one wide awake what does brother brandham say about the world they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride I have a personal sensitivity to the way that this message can be used as a three-pointed club to beat up the bride right how many have experienced that like our very liberators are using the club to beat us up you're the bride you're the bride of Christ like really is this a is this how it's supposed to feel well I would say to some degree and I don't mean this in other words that I become the the uh the abuser in this statement but have we recognized it if they haven't recognized The Awakening of the bride and we can say all day long that they haven't recognized it but are we Wide Awake are we willing to be honest with ourselves are we willing to face things and give them an honest look and look at it and be honest with ourselves because the bride doesn't stick her head in the sand and hide herself oh no no no no this isn't Le to see know this this isn't L to see no this isn't true it isn't real this doesn't happen she knows she knows there's a storm she knows it's a dark day she knows she's fully aware they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride have we have we recognized it I was overwhelmed with this feeling not for myself but I felt the the weight of it of this attitude of how one could doesn't want to wake up in someone anybody ever experienced that I know what it feels like you finally go to sleep and once you're finally asleep you don't want to wake up again because what happens when you wake up reality and and I got to face it now I I and you just wish that you could sleep it off or stay in bed but let me say this I'm speaking to you today straight from the Throne of God there should be no fear in Remembering your past fully understanding your present and looking forward to your future should be no fear in Remembering your past fully understanding your present and looking forward to your future I can look back upon my past I can experience my present and face my future without fear because with his love I can bravely endure past present future why because my happiness is not built on a Li and my happiness cannot be taken away by truth think about it no matter how difficult and inconvenient the truth may be I hope you realize just how liberating this is no matter how difficult and inconvenient a truth may be it cannot rob you of the Lord's joy and if you experience some discomfort or the loss of happiness you realize that's merely a state of mind and that there's got to be a word answered to that condition in order to fill the void that this truth has now created because now there's a vacuum in my mind a vacuum in My Flesh and now I'm feeling lost and I'm feeling unstable and there was now that this lie has been taken away and this truth has driven this away and this truth has created weakness oh I I feel like I'm I'm lost I feel like I I'm without an anchor and that's when the Lord says I'm that I'm the one that fills the void I'm the one that's got to answer that need I'm the one that you were kept away from based upon that listen we are going to be healed when we acknowledge that we're sick but he's the Healer we're going to be set free when we acknowledge we are in bondage but he's the deliverer there is no hopeless case there is no situation too far God why we believe that it's shalom it's good morning my healer my deliverer my Liber is here I do not have to fear past present or future in other words I'm not asleep I'm wide awake and there's nothing I'm afraid of in this state of awareness I I trust I I I I I feel like I just kind of made an absolute mess of where I was going because of how long I was in the outset but I blame you because you guys are pulling hard this morning fully blame you I feel Justified because you guys are hungry as can be maybe the time between Wednesday and Sunday is too long but with this kind of hungry heart you know you've got to say say what God wants you to say and I feel so impressed to tell you don't be afraid to wake up don't be able to be afraid to face realities don't be afraid to face consequences don't be afraid because there's a word there there's a word there that's going to meet the inefficiency there's a word there that's going to meet you in your need there's a word there that when you feel that you could be Forsaken and cast out there's a word there to welcome you they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride then this is where the attack is I'm just going to close on that I'll save the remainder for another time but let me say that that's where the attack is Satan doesn't want you to wake up let's stand to our feet could we bow our heads for a word of prayer this is the opportunity I believe that as we've been ministering you've been introspective and you've been looking inward I believe that you've been uh processing it for for yourself I love how um in your heart you have uh you have today not merely listened to a sermon to understand how it was put together and whether or not there was a complete thought but you in you in you actually entered into this in a way that you felt like the Lord was counseling with your heart and so with that type of uh Dynamic could you now with heads bowed speak to your counselor open up your heart to him it's an amazing Dynamic how in the world you go to a doctor who diagnoses but then send you to another one that treats who send you to another one to rehabilitate you and you just get passed from one specialty to another sometimes you can't even see the specialist until you've seen the general practitioner and sometimes you need to go get second opinions you go see this one they say well I diagnose you with this condition I need to prescribe you medication so then you have to go to a [Music] pharmacist forget about all that you're in his care [Music] today he diagnoses he prescribes [Music] he identifies he remedies the same one that tells you you need surgery is performing it already the same one that tells you you need healing healed you already the same one that awakened you to a discomfort today is the same one that comforts you you're not being handed off today you do not have to leave church today with a list of of things that you can do better to make things work he do even schedule a follow-up appointment you know what he says let's do this together and he just kind of take you by the hand the way that he does and says let's go you got this CU he's with you even in you until the end and with him by my side and if I could be wide awake to what he's done I'm not not afraid to wake up to a world that's dark I'm not afraid to wake up to the horrors of my past I'm not afraid to wake up to the challenges that I face because this Bliss is not ignorance This Joy is not delusion it's pure and all knowing amen could you accept him today could you accept him as your healthc care provider could you accept him as your Soul Provider your soul health care practitioner your do the divine order today you can accept him for all that you have need of today there's only one essential oil the Holy Ghost today there's only one surgery I need heart surgery today I lift my hands before a loving father I'm separating myself from the abuses of other fathers I'm separating myself from the Dynamics of church and pastor and church order and I've made myself feel important because I fit within the structure of a local church and today I realize I'm important because I fit within his kingdom and that's what makes me who I am is my relationship to Christ would you accept it today today listen I believe that today there's people who don't have to be afraid to wake up anymore accept it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right now our heads are bowed just receive it I could pray for you but it'll do a lot better if you just accept him right now accept [Music] it you kind of sense that voice from the ministry of Truth The Party begins to creep in and Whisper its slogans to you to get you to engage in double think right now I encourage you just to accept truth he will take care of you yesterday morning I went to a ministers meeting here hosted in Phoenix well over 40 ministers from all over Arizona were there I had a heavy heart and brother Tom weathers was very unique for ministers meeting he took his guitar and said I just want to sing a song an old Methodist hymn he will take care of [Music] you he will take care of you accept it he's got this together we'll make it not blind not Dull not asleep but Wide Awake Lord help me this is I'll pray now this is our prayer together is we're from different churches but this is our prayer together as being one in Christ God help me to recognize my Awakening I want I want to be awakened I want to be wide awake I know the world will never recognize it but Lord what benefit would it be if I don't recognize it gracious heavenly father today there is an anointing that is beyond flesh there's a healing that's transpiring that is beyond a Band-Aid a balm a Sav it's beyond time let me say that it's a miracle that what is happening right now in a person's life is equal to if not greater than tumors falling off a person's body on the platform a limb being restored cancers being healed blood sugar being eradicated Lord the the spiritual Miracle that's taking place in people's hearts right now R tantum out to those physical healings and I pray now Lord that they could receive it in your [Music] name may we all accept it for one one another but especially Lord for ourselves I commit the people to you now that you making yourself known to them may we be wide awake and conscious of your presence but also Lord wide awake to what you would have us to know in the time that you would want us to know it may we be sober and serious may we be healed now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen can you say thank you to him thank him for passing by thank him for speaking to your hearts today thank them in your heart however you need to tell them thank you some people write thank you cards some people do you know something special in return where you buy them a gift and they buy you a thank you gift and if you're both nature the same same way it's a cycle That Never Ends could you begin a cycle today with the Lord just begin it today thank you Lord thank you thank you Lord thank you
