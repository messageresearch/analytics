[0:00] so I want to just read a quick quote um
[0:02] from the adoption series and brother
[0:05] Rand says this when God in his labor
[0:06] pain was bringing forth um bringing
[0:09] forth you knowing what you would do he
[0:11] positionally placed you into his own
[0:13] body to be a housewife to be a farmer to
[0:14] be a preacher to be a prophet to be this
[0:16] or to be that so I understand that like
[0:19] everyone in the room we've got all kinds
[0:20] of different people right so we we read
[0:22] about the spiritual gifts we read about
[0:24] the callings in the church but then
[0:26] there are things that you do in life so
[0:28] a farmer isn't a calling that's in the
[0:30] Bible right it's not something that says
[0:32] you're going to be called to be a farmer
[0:34] and this is what you're going to do
[0:35] although there are farmers in the Bible
[0:36] right right and so mechanics that
[0:40] they're in general I guess they're
[0:42] mechanics actually we'll talk about a
[0:43] little bit about uzzi and and I guess
[0:45] you could say he was mechanical and some
[0:47] of his nature but and you have preachers
[0:50] but which actually that's their job is
[0:52] to be a preacher um we've got Dental
[0:55] people I guess we've got people that do
[0:57] occupational therapy you've got people
[0:59] that are it people which I can't
[1:01] understand that stuff I can't even get
[1:03] like print to to work for me but there's
[1:05] all and you got people that work on feet
[1:07] so podiatrist you got things like that
[1:09] going on you so all kinds of different
[1:11] things that we do and all of those
[1:14] things are are special to each person
[1:17] and the interesting thing is and I'll
[1:18] I'll use Dental because I couldn't be a
[1:21] dental person because I don't want to
[1:23] look in my own mouth much less anybody
[1:26] else's mouth that walks in the door
[1:28] Brother Scott I couldn't be a p atrist
[1:30] cuz I'm out on toe funus like it's I
[1:34] it's not me yeah but I'm a firefighter
[1:37] and then so I see things that other
[1:39] people they just can't handle and I'll
[1:41] give you a quick example I won't go into
[1:43] detail but one time we had an accident
[1:45] up on the
[1:46] i7 and uh there was a it was a group of
[1:49] young people they were probably in their
[1:50] 20s and thankfully no one was majorly
[1:53] hurt and by majorly hurt I mean they
[1:55] were all going to live um one of the
[1:57] guys needed transported to the hospital
[1:59] and he had had a basically a a wound
[2:02] that his scalp he it looked like the you
[2:04] know if
[2:05] you if you play Cowboys in Indians an
[2:08] Indian got him like it just ripped it
[2:11] back well it's it bleeds a lot it looks
[2:13] really bad it's like wow this is
[2:15] horrible but he was well like um well
[2:19] speaking from a medical standpoint and
[2:21] that pretty much they're just going to
[2:22] sew that thing up he he was he was there
[2:25] he never lost Consciousness he just
[2:27] caught something and it ripped him so
[2:30] what happened on this particular evening
[2:32] is that our battalion chief had this
[2:34] brainy idea of like we needed extra
[2:36] hands so he saw some some Wildland
[2:38] firefighters and he said hey you guys
[2:41] come help us on this scene well they're
[2:43] Wildland firefighters we're firefighters
[2:44] they're Wildland firefighters were
[2:46] thinking okay awesome we got some extra
[2:47] hands it was a disaster because the
[2:50] instant that they saw this bleading
[2:54] person they lost it we had people in the
[2:57] highway pan you know just freaking out
[3:00] and now we've got a patient and other
[3:02] patients that we have to deal with and
[3:03] all this so everybody's made different
[3:06] that's the whole part of it right
[3:07] everybody has these different things
[3:08] that they have to do everybody has a
[3:10] different way that they need to go and
[3:12] so everybody's just different and you
[3:14] just settle into what it is that you I
[3:17] mean I don't did when you were a young
[3:19] boy Brother Scott did you want to grow
[3:21] up and be a
[3:23] podiatrist maybe I don't
[3:25] know like you know what you thinking
[3:28] that Dental assist I don't know you
[3:31] lawyer I don't know you know but you
[3:34] settle into those things and you think
[3:36] it's like well I've I've got all this
[3:38] plan or whatever and it's really God's
[3:39] put something into you to be exactly
[3:42] what it is that you're ending up being
[3:44] you've got something already in there to
[3:46] be that and to draw you into that and
[3:48] he's positionally placing you not just
[3:50] with the gifts that we read about in in
[3:51] the scripture or not just with the
[3:52] callings that we read about in the
[3:54] scripture but in all of life he's
[3:56] placing you into something and he's
[3:58] doing that for a particular
[4:01] purpose
[4:04] so as we go along here this evening I I
[4:08] I'm going to do a disclaimer just before
[4:11] I announce my sermon title because um I
[4:16] am not an expert on space
[4:19] travel uh I am not an expert on
[4:22] astronauts uh uh I actually am like
[4:24] pretty much every other American I paid
[4:26] almost no attention to what astronauts
[4:28] were doing until some civilians went
[4:30] into space and then it just triggered
[4:33] something to to go back to the countdown
[4:35] and to look at that and and from then on
[4:37] it's been like okay there's things there
[4:39] and so I'm not an astronaut but anyway
[4:43] this evening we're going to talk about
[4:45] mission
[4:46] control and life
[4:48] support and I I want you to to think of
[4:51] it in this way I'm not talking about
[4:53] life support is and the person is dying
[4:56] but I want you to think of it as life
[4:57] support and is there's a need in life in
[5:00] fact there are many needs in life and
[5:03] the whole Christian experience brother
[5:05] brandom told us the whole Christian
[5:07] experience was to live for others so
[5:09] what you're doing is you're supporting
[5:11] life very good everything that you're
[5:13] doing is to support life so it's not
[5:16] life support in the fact that this
[5:17] person is going to die well it could I
[5:20] mean it could be between life and death
[5:22] but at the same time it may just be that
[5:24] they just need a hand up they just need
[5:26] some support they need something to be
[5:28] there something to help them something
[5:29] to get them through and so that's kind
[5:32] of I want you to have that in the back
[5:33] of your mind and so uh what I wanted to
[5:36] talk about and where I got this idea
[5:38] from is there was a mission called
[5:40] Apollo
[5:41] 13 and the Apollo 13 mission was a
[5:44] mission to the moon and uh some of you
[5:47] may have heard of it and it was called
[5:48] the a Successful Failure and I thought
[5:51] that's not a really good title to me
[5:53] because does that mean they set out to
[5:55] fail and they were successful because
[5:57] they failed like is that a Successful
[6:00] Failure I don't know but what was
[6:02] striking about this particular situation
[6:04] with Apollo 13 is it's a group of three
[6:06] astronauts are sent to go to the the
[6:08] moon they're Apollo 13 there's a bunch
[6:10] of 13s that are associated with this
[6:12] thing and I'm going to go kind of fast
[6:13] because I've got a lot to get through um
[6:16] so everybody thinks this is cursed from
[6:18] the beginning except the astronauts
[6:20] they're like no big deal because they're
[6:21] not superstitious now God's astronauts I
[6:24] would hope we're not superstitious right
[6:26] like fingers crossed nobody's
[6:28] superstitious right
[6:30] right we're not superstitious no we're
[6:31] not okay just making sure so they here
[6:35] they've got this trip to the moon they
[6:37] they go off they take off on a date and
[6:39] the time that they left had added up to
[6:41] 13 there was all kinds of like
[6:43] everything's 13 everything's 13 and so
[6:46] they get into this flight and um they
[6:48] had a couple um problems but one of the
[6:51] things that ends up happening is they go
[6:52] to stir tanks and I'm not going to go
[6:54] into the details of it cuz it just takes
[6:56] too long but they have to stir certain
[6:58] tanks they have hydrogen and oxygen and
[6:59] they have to stir these tanks and when
[7:01] they flip a switch an explosion happens
[7:05] and they realize that they have a
[7:06] problem so if you've ever heard Houston
[7:08] we have a problem that's where it came
[7:10] from and actually the the actually what
[7:12] they did say was Houston we've had a
[7:14] problem but they changed it to Houston
[7:16] we have a problem for poetic license and
[7:18] that's kind of what came into the
[7:19] vernacular because pretty much if you
[7:21] tell anybody Houston we have a problem
[7:22] you know what they're saying right
[7:25] there's a situation so that's where it
[7:26] came from is actually Apollo 13 so
[7:29] now you know that there's a connection
[7:31] between you and what I'm preaching on
[7:33] it's Houston we have a problem yeah so
[7:36] very good they they have a problem and
[7:38] and in this particular problem what they
[7:40] find out is that they've had a a a thing
[7:43] that actually occurred before so there
[7:45] was a situation with some wiring in the
[7:47] in the ship that actually was damaged
[7:49] before they didn't know it they send
[7:51] them up into space and when they flip
[7:54] this switch in other words a trigger
[7:56] there's a trigger that happens they flip
[7:58] that switch and boom something goes goes
[8:01] wrong and now they've got a situation
[8:03] that they have to fix so getting through
[8:06] all the details just really quickly what
[8:08] they find out is they they have an area
[8:10] where they can stay but they can't stay
[8:11] there because they need power and they
[8:13] don't have power because the oxygen that
[8:14] they just lost that was part of what
[8:16] blew out um operates the batteries they
[8:19] got to switch the batteries so they have
[8:21] to go into a capsule that's only
[8:22] designed for two people for a short
[8:24] period of time and now they have to put
[8:25] three people in it and try and get these
[8:26] three people back to Earth so
[8:29] the interesting part about this is they
[8:31] end up with in the capsule that they're
[8:33] supposed to stay in it has Square
[8:36] filters that filter the air for carbon
[8:38] dioxide that we breathe out and they're
[8:40] called scrubber filters and in the thing
[8:43] that they have to go into it has round
[8:45] ones so they have to go from putting a
[8:47] square thing into a round hole and
[8:50] that's the situation and it made me
[8:52] start to think about this because they
[8:53] have a whole team of Engineers Mission
[8:54] Control has got this big group of people
[8:57] you've got a mission Commander you've
[8:58] got all kinds of people they're under
[8:59] the direction they've got all these
[9:01] people working to make sure that
[9:02] something is is those guys are going to
[9:05] stay alive that this we're going to
[9:06] support their mission we're going to
[9:08] make sure this is life support for them
[9:10] right now we have to do everything we
[9:12] can to make sure that they're okay so
[9:15] they're up there with this life support
[9:16] and trying to figure that out and what
[9:18] they're going to do and one of the guys
[9:20] comes and figures out that hey if I take
[9:22] this Square thing and I put this plastic
[9:23] that's up in there and I take some duct
[9:25] tape which is awesome cuz he's got duct
[9:27] tape and and and they put duct tape
[9:30] around it everything's going to be good
[9:33] and they they take a hose and connect it
[9:34] and sure enough they take a square thing
[9:36] and basically put it into a round hole
[9:39] and because they've been able to do this
[9:41] this mission is able to come back and I
[9:43] thought you know that's just like the
[9:44] Lord he puts
[9:46] everything everything that we need
[9:49] brother brandom said everything that we
[9:51] need is in us
[9:53] already so everything that the church
[9:56] needs everything that you individually
[9:58] that you need is in US
[9:59] already so but we aren't aware
[10:02] necessarily of what it is that we need
[10:04] at the time that we need it but at some
[10:07] point in time it becomes known to us
[10:09] what it is what do I need what what is
[10:12] this need that I need to fill and God
[10:14] knows exactly what we have need of so um
[10:18] one of the things if you know from the
[10:19] last time that I um well not the last
[10:22] time but one of the times that I
[10:23] preached is I I um actually gave a
[10:25] little bit of a uh a riddle and if you
[10:29] had asked me years ago if I'd ever do a
[10:31] riddle in church I would have said
[10:32] probably not in fact about 99.99% sure I
[10:35] wouldn't now I'm going to do a second
[10:37] one so for those of you that weren't
[10:40] here the first time I'm going to give
[10:41] you the what the riddle was and this was
[10:44] it was a malleable finite cylindrical
[10:45] coil Rod of parallel axes with as athal
[10:48] terminates now many people know what
[10:50] that is in the in the congregation today
[10:52] right some of you don't so I'm going to
[10:53] give you the answer because this this
[10:55] one's already we've already done this
[10:56] one okay it's a paper clip
[10:59] sounds pretty important but it's just a
[11:02] paperclip so um forgive me if I uh if
[11:06] I if I'm giving you something you know
[11:10] if I'm using a riddle in church it's for
[11:11] a purpose okay so there's there there's
[11:14] a reason behind what I'm doing so uh
[11:16] here's your first clue um this thing or
[11:21] things um has inspired Nations and
[11:25] individuals so it's an inspiration to
[11:28] both Nations and individuals okay so
[11:31] that's your first
[11:32] clue so one of the things that um when I
[11:35] was thinking about the the folks that
[11:37] are on this particular mission is
[11:39] there's a thing called Mission
[11:41] creep
[11:43] and I you know when Reggie was preaching
[11:46] about dragons and ghosts and stuff like
[11:50] that and it's like now I'm going to
[11:51] preach on creepers and it's like so I I
[11:55] didn't want to do Mission creep as my
[11:57] title so so cuz I didn't know how well
[12:01] that would go
[12:02] over um but Mission creep is is
[12:06] basically where a person has a
[12:09] particular position they're they're in a
[12:11] position or something and they in that
[12:15] particular position they they get pretty
[12:17] successful at it and so then they're
[12:19] like hey you know I was pretty good at
[12:20] that I think I'm going to try and my
[12:22] hand at the next thing and it's not that
[12:25] actually their position to do it um but
[12:28] they're like you know I'm going to try
[12:30] it so what here's the definition it says
[12:33] Mission creep is the gradual or
[12:34] incremental expansion of an intervention
[12:36] project or Mission Beyond its original
[12:38] scope Focus or goals a ratchet effect
[12:41] spawned by initial success so things are
[12:44] going good and Mission creep is usually
[12:47] considered undesirable due to how each
[12:49] success breeds more ambitious
[12:51] interventions until a final failure
[12:53] happens stopping the intervention
[12:55] entirely so you have these astronauts
[12:59] and all of a sudden they've got a
[13:01] problem and the problem has to be fixed
[13:03] right you've got no choice you've got to
[13:05] fix the problem and and that's the way
[13:07] it is in life you have problems and you
[13:10] have problems that are going to maybe
[13:12] interfere with your relationship with
[13:14] the Lord or interfere with the people
[13:15] that are sitting next to you or the
[13:17] people in your home uh or people at work
[13:20] you you have these different situations
[13:21] that come up and you've got to deal with
[13:24] these particular situations and I'm
[13:26] thinking well these astronauts everybody
[13:28] had a job right you you've got specific
[13:30] jobs that you're supposed to do one is a
[13:31] payload specialist one is the pilot you
[13:34] know everybody's got a job and everybody
[13:35] at Mission Control everybody's got a job
[13:38] but when you find out that there's a
[13:40] situation that has to be fixed it's not
[13:43] Mission creep to fix the problem okay so
[13:48] let me give you an example of what
[13:49] mission creep is that we would know from
[13:52] the Bible
[13:53] Uzziah he's a king right he's a really
[13:56] good King 16 years old he's made
[14:00] King everything's off to a good start
[14:04] the the Bible said he built all kinds of
[14:06] stuff he builds eloth he he he he's
[14:08] while he's working he's reigning he
[14:11] reigned 50 and2 years in Jerusalem he's
[14:14] what uh he did those things that were
[14:16] right in the sight of the Lord
[14:17] everything is going along good he's
[14:19] seeking the Lord and God makes him
[14:21] Prosper so he's going along uh he you
[14:25] know he fights against the Philistines
[14:26] God helps him there he fights against
[14:28] Arabians God helps him there every time
[14:29] the ammonites are bringing gifts to him
[14:31] his name is spread abroad everything's
[14:33] going good for Uzziah he builds Towers
[14:35] he builds Towers in the desert he builds
[14:37] them in Jerusalem at the corner Gates
[14:39] he's digging Wells he's doing all kinds
[14:41] of things because he's the king he can
[14:43] do a lot of stuff and things are going
[14:45] good he's got a host of fighting men
[14:48] he's got Mighty Men of Valor he has 2600
[14:51] of those guys and then he's got an army
[14:53] of
[14:53] 37,500 guys that are really good at
[14:55] fighting his army is amazing they it
[14:58] says they made war with Mighty power so
[15:01] they weren't just your average Fighters
[15:03] these were Mighty Fighters so he's he's
[15:05] commanding these armies he's got all
[15:06] these things happening everything's
[15:08] going
[15:10] great he's a guy that is a mechanic
[15:13] actually so he helps to prepare Shields
[15:16] and Spears and helmets and different uh
[15:18] weapons that they do and along the way
[15:22] he um the the scripture says this in um
[15:25] this is be second chronicles um it says
[15:29] he made in Jerusalem engines and
[15:31] invented by cunning men so he puts these
[15:33] into towers and they're shooting arrows
[15:35] and they can shoot great stones with
[15:37] these engines so he's got like there's a
[15:39] lot of stuff going on in his kingdom
[15:41] things are going great but then one day
[15:44] he's like everything's good everything
[15:46] I've done to this point has been awesome
[15:49] I've wiped out my enemies I've dug Wells
[15:51] I've built Towers I've doing this I got
[15:53] guys that listen to me everything I say
[15:55] everybody does everything's going great
[15:58] and then he gets lifted up and because
[16:01] of that he he creeps into somewhere that
[16:05] he shouldn't have and he tries to go
[16:07] into to somewhere else that he shouldn't
[16:10] have and he tries to operate in the
[16:11] office of the priest which wasn't his
[16:14] thing to do he needed to stay on task
[16:16] and on Focus so the interesting thing is
[16:19] here now I'm going to switch this
[16:21] because yeah he he he did Mission creep
[16:25] that's what it was and let's let's say
[16:27] if we we had somebody in a church so and
[16:30] this is not a church anywhere that you
[16:32] know this is just a composite that I'm
[16:34] making up okay so and I don't think it's
[16:37] going to happen here or anything like
[16:38] that but I want to switch this because
[16:41] we've all heard about getting out of our
[16:43] lane and brother brandham talked about
[16:45] it and like you know don't do what Billy
[16:46] Graham does you need to do what you do
[16:48] so we all understand that we all we all
[16:50] know like hey you need to do this but
[16:54] and and brother Manuel was preaching on
[16:55] this with the depression and anxiety and
[16:57] one of the things about depression and
[16:58] anxiety and that is the last place that
[17:00] we should come to get it is church yeah
[17:03] if you're going to have fear the fear
[17:05] shouldn't be in church unless it's fear
[17:07] of the Lord and that fear of the Lord is
[17:09] just an awesome respect to God it
[17:11] shouldn't be placed into the church in
[17:15] church that is something that you're
[17:17] going to get from reading the news or
[17:19] seeing people or something out there
[17:21] that's where the fear comes from right
[17:24] but somewhere along the line people got
[17:27] from church
[17:29] and I'm not saying any specific church
[17:30] I'm not saying anything like that but
[17:32] from church something happened so let me
[17:34] give you an example you have a person in
[17:36] church who say is a Sunday school
[17:38] teacher and they can sing pretty well so
[17:41] then somebody says you know would you be
[17:43] the song leader and they're successful
[17:45] at at at the Sunday school teacher role
[17:48] and they become the song leader and as
[17:50] the song leader they start to you know
[17:52] throw out a few things here and there
[17:53] and look hey you know this is really
[17:55] good brought the Sunday school lessons
[17:57] from the kids put it behind the Pulpit
[17:59] it's coming along pretty good people
[18:00] start to like him and then he feels I'm
[18:03] I'm led to preach why don't you let me
[18:05] preach and so and it's fine has a
[18:08] calling gets up there because you can
[18:10] tell he's got a calling gets up there to
[18:12] preach and then pretty soon he's like
[18:14] you know what I'm pretty good at this I
[18:16] can I got it down like I got it going on
[18:19] here I think I should be the
[18:22] pastor and the only problem is is that
[18:25] he never had a heart for the people so
[18:28] all it was was he was successful at each
[18:30] thing and then you get so successful
[18:32] you're thinking I I should be the pastor
[18:34] and then they start going around you
[18:36] know what you should make me the pastor
[18:38] I'm the guy and you start to try and
[18:40] convince the people and try and make
[18:43] that person the pastor and what ends up
[18:46] happening is now in this church probably
[18:49] a church split but guess what happens
[18:53] somebody in another church hears about
[18:54] what happened and they hear about
[18:56] Mission creep they hear about somebody
[18:59] that got out of their lane and then
[19:01] they're like worried because what if
[19:04] that happens here yeah and so they start
[19:06] to perceive everything that starts to to
[19:09] work in a direction to help them is this
[19:12] could be Mission creep this this person
[19:14] could be getting out of their Lane and
[19:17] in the person's heart all they're really
[19:19] wanting to do is to help somebody
[19:21] they're just there to to to be a support
[19:24] system they're there for life support
[19:25] that's all they're there for they're not
[19:27] actually trying to become the the leader
[19:30] of the group they're doing whatever is
[19:31] necessary for the group to help the
[19:33] group to prosper because that from the
[19:37] message that's what we're supposed to do
[19:39] if there's something that we can do to
[19:40] help others Prosper that's and by
[19:43] Prosper I'm not meaning money I I'm
[19:45] talking about in the Lord prosper in the
[19:46] Lord if there's something that we can do
[19:48] to help somebody Prosper that's what
[19:50] we're to do but what happens is somebody
[19:52] hears that and then they start to get on
[19:55] guard and that on guard starts to to get
[19:58] it and it doesn't just take the person
[20:00] that's the leader it starts to spread to
[20:02] other people and then as it spreads to
[20:04] other people then people think oh this
[20:06] person could be getting out of the line
[20:07] so then pretty soon the deacons are
[20:09] looking for like everybody that's not
[20:10] where they're supposed to be like wait a
[20:12] second are you getting out of your lane
[20:14] like are you a creeper we don't want
[20:16] creepers in our church and pretty soon
[20:19] there's a fear that comes on the people
[20:22] and when that fear comes on the people
[20:24] there's a real situation that you have
[20:26] that you have to deal with because we
[20:28] have a life support issue that we have
[20:31] going on and when you start to put fear
[20:34] into the people then people don't know
[20:36] what to do so not only do they not take
[20:40] so the the places that we talked about
[20:42] here they won't take those places
[20:44] they're afraid to do anything because I
[20:47] could be getting out of my Lane I could
[20:49] be a creeper I don't want to be a
[20:51] creeper as Believers we don't want to be
[20:53] creepers so uh right I think that's true
[20:58] yes sir okay I'm just making sure you
[21:00] don't want to be a creeper
[21:03] so or a dragon or a ghost is right we
[21:07] don't want to be that either want the
[21:10] Holy Ghost
[21:11] though so we're okay with that
[21:13] one so um so I got to thinking about
[21:17] this particular thought and I thought
[21:19] well let's take the other side of this
[21:22] and um start to talk about that
[21:25] one and the other side of it is is
[21:28] that if a person has an issue with
[21:31] Mission creeple there's another thing
[21:32] that that you may need to happen is that
[21:36] in an emergency situation or in a
[21:37] situation where there's someone that
[21:39] can't fulfill the role you may have to
[21:41] step in and do
[21:42] something
[21:45] yourself so you you may be the one that
[21:47] has to step up to the plate and so I was
[21:50] thinking about in in the
[21:52] scripture um
[21:54] that uh well let's just read it in
[21:57] Hebrew Hebrews um
[22:01] 11:32 it says this and what shall I more
[22:03] say for the time would fail to tell fail
[22:06] me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and
[22:08] of Samson and of jeffa of David also and
[22:11] Samuel and the prophets so the first
[22:14] ones here that we're talking
[22:17] about um are in the Book of Judges and
[22:20] one of the interesting thing about the
[22:22] Book of Judges is that you have all
[22:23] these different ones and we could go
[22:25] into the lives of these different people
[22:26] but here in this particular scripture
[22:29] you you find that that Barack Barack or
[22:32] Barack however you want to say it is is
[22:34] a person that's named as this person of
[22:37] Faith so let's go to um judges the 4th
[22:41] chapter and the 1st through the 6th
[22:44] verse and it says this and the children
[22:46] of Israel again did evil in the sight of
[22:49] the Lord when Ehud was dead and the Lord
[22:51] sold them into the hands of jabin king
[22:53] of Canaan that reigned in hazor the
[22:55] captain whose host was CIS which dwelt
[22:57] in herth of the Gentiles and the
[23:00] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[23:01] for he had 900 Chariots of iron so this
[23:03] is pretty serious like you know this is
[23:06] a day when they didn't have tanks like
[23:09] if you had a chariot of iron that was a
[23:10] serious thing wasn't made out of wood
[23:12] this thing is is built to take care of
[23:15] business so he's got Chariots of iron
[23:18] he's got in 20 years he's he's
[23:20] oppressing the children of
[23:22] Israel and in verse four it says and
[23:24] Deborah A prophetess the wife of lipido
[23:27] she judged Israel at that
[23:29] time so here we have a situation in and
[23:33] now if you know anything about the the
[23:35] israelies or Jews if you want to say if
[23:37] you know anything about it one of the
[23:39] things that they didn't normally have
[23:41] was a woman that was the head of
[23:43] something it just it just wasn't common
[23:46] now in our American history that's
[23:48] fairly common for us now you go back a
[23:51] few you know decades even and it wasn't
[23:54] common right but so for them this was
[23:56] not a common thing
[23:58] so anyways uh so we got Deborah the
[24:01] propheus and she dwelt under the palm
[24:03] tree of Deborah between Rama and bethl
[24:05] and Mount Ephraim and the children of
[24:06] Israel came up to her for judgment and
[24:09] she sent and called Barack the son of
[24:11] abinoam out of Kesh nephal and said unto
[24:14] him hath not the Lord God of Israel
[24:16] commanded saying go and draw toward
[24:18] Mount tabore and take with the 10,000
[24:20] men of the children of naal and of the
[24:22] children of Zebulon okay so just before
[24:25] I get going here here's your second clue
[24:27] it can stop a weapon of mass
[24:29] destruction okay that's your clue number
[24:32] two so here we have a woman that's now
[24:36] the person that is and I've chosen her
[24:39] for two reasons and I'll I'll tell you
[24:40] that in a moment so we now have a woman
[24:43] that is a propheus um and so propheus is
[24:47] female version of a prophet she can see
[24:49] into the future or see things the Lord
[24:52] reveals to this person what is happening
[24:55] and uh because she can see actually what
[24:58] is taking place just like if we saw
[24:59] Samuel Samuel saw into the future other
[25:01] prophets have seen into the future we we
[25:03] know that um you know Eagles are what we
[25:06] talk about or what we say oh by the way
[25:09] you know that first clue that I gave you
[25:12] that you know nations were inspired and
[25:14] individuals it's not an eagle okay it's
[25:16] not Eagles it's not the Chiefs it's not
[25:19] the
[25:20] Rangers yeah there's none of those right
[25:23] it's not golf in case anybody here is
[25:25] worried about that one and it's not
[25:26] hunting or fishing so just get those out
[25:28] of the way okay but it's not an eagle
[25:31] so but so here you have Deborah that is
[25:35] able to the Lord is able to speak to her
[25:37] she's sitting under a a basically a a a
[25:40] palm tree and she's the one that people
[25:42] are coming to now for advice and
[25:44] Direction because this is the time of
[25:45] the judges when they needed somebody and
[25:48] you would say listen it should have been
[25:49] a
[25:50] man and I'd be like yeah I'm not
[25:53] disagreeing with that statement maybe it
[25:55] should have been a man but the reality
[25:57] was
[25:58] they had
[26:00] Deborah they had somebody that could
[26:02] fulfill this role now one of the reasons
[26:04] I chose her is because right now if
[26:06] youve seen in in contemporary things
[26:08] that's going on there are some religious
[26:10] people that are trying to use this for
[26:12] their political agenda to say look at
[26:13] here's Deborah and so the Lord obviously
[26:16] uh you know he he's more fluid than we
[26:18] think he is and Deborah was not
[26:21] operating as a priest she wasn't going
[26:24] into the temple she was not doing any of
[26:26] the things that that a levite would do
[26:29] she was there to guide an army and was a
[26:33] political and and basically a Warfare
[26:35] figure that was what she was doing so
[26:38] she wasn't out of her Lane because she
[26:41] wasn't doing the office of a priest she
[26:44] was doing something that God required
[26:46] somebody to be able to battle against
[26:48] the enemies that were coming against
[26:49] Israel and she was the one available to
[26:52] do it so she's the one there so she's
[26:55] the one that that that can do these
[26:57] things and so brother brandom said this
[26:59] said and and there's not a lot on her I
[27:02] mean that you're going to find in the
[27:03] message there's just there's just not
[27:04] much but he said a few years before this
[27:07] had been the propheus so he's just
[27:09] talking about the time of the judges and
[27:10] different judges that are going through
[27:13] the propheus Deborah and Barack and how
[27:16] that she had prophesied and told them
[27:17] what to do and it was just exactly right
[27:20] so here's a person that it seems like
[27:23] maybe she shouldn't be the one there but
[27:26] yet the Lord is telling her exactly what
[27:27] to do and what she's doing is exactly
[27:30] right so Barack the great warrior and
[27:33] how that they made a song of the triumph
[27:35] over the enemy but as soon as they got
[27:36] out of the twist right straight back
[27:38] into the rut they went again so for the
[27:40] sake of time I'm not going to go too
[27:42] much into the whole life of what happens
[27:45] there for Deborah so we're almost to
[27:47] burn through our first 30 minutes so we
[27:50] we so I've got another 30 minutes after
[27:52] the first half hour is up so just just
[27:54] saying so but what we take from this is
[27:58] that here's a person who in probably
[28:04] everybody's View at that time maybe
[28:07] shouldn't have been that person but yet
[28:08] the Lord's using her as life support the
[28:11] Lord has placed her into position as
[28:13] life support and cis's got you know 900
[28:17] iron chariots and Deborah says listen uh
[28:22] you need to um come baric and what I
[28:25] want you to do is grab 10,000 guys and
[28:27] you know the Lord's told me this is how
[28:29] the battle's going to go you need to
[28:30] climb up to mount tabore this is how
[28:32] what you're going to do here's our
[28:34] battle plan everything's going good and
[28:37] the interesting thing is is Barack when
[28:39] he hears this he's like you know what
[28:40] I'm willing to do this but you got to go
[28:42] with me and I want you to see the heart
[28:45] of Deborah because I think it's real
[28:47] important to see what the person's heart
[28:49] is because it's what the person's heart
[28:51] is is where you get out of a lane or
[28:54] stay in one because Deborah's heart was
[28:57] like
[28:58] I'll go with you but if I do this battle
[29:02] is not going to be to your glory it's
[29:05] going to actually fall to a woman and if
[29:07] you read the story a woman I'm not even
[29:09] going to tell you what she does but
[29:11] anyway she knocks off the the the CIS uh
[29:15] uh but Barack has this whole battle and
[29:17] he ends up chasing CIS and he gets into
[29:20] somebody's tent and in the tent you know
[29:22] they're they're dispatched the the
[29:23] person is knocked off and um and you can
[29:27] the story it's it's it's pretty amazing
[29:29] what she's I mean I I just can't even
[29:31] imagine it personally but uh but they're
[29:34] dispatched so taken care of and so I
[29:38] just thought it was real interesting
[29:40] this this is an interesting thing to me
[29:42] is Barack is the one that's mentioned in
[29:49] Hebrews Deborah
[29:52] wasn't and you know Saints a lesson to
[29:56] us sometimes you don't get get credit
[29:58] that's good you're not always going to
[30:00] get credit and the reality is you don't
[30:03] need the credit now now Deborah and and
[30:06] Barack and they wrote a song I mean she
[30:09] got to write her own song and she got a
[30:10] whole a whole chapter singing her song
[30:14] so that was her reward was like she got
[30:16] a whole chapter in the Bible of the song
[30:18] of this battle and everything that
[30:20] happened and what went down but you
[30:23] don't always get the reward that you
[30:25] would expect now I would have I mean I'm
[30:27] thinking if I know this story and I'm
[30:29] the guy writing I'm probably writing
[30:31] about Deborah not
[30:35] Barack but that's not what the Lord did
[30:39] so when we're in a situation where we're
[30:42] the life support for something you may
[30:45] be the person that provides all the
[30:47] support all the direction you may do
[30:50] everything that's necessary for that
[30:52] person you may get zero credit for it
[30:55] and it's just fine exactly because we're
[30:58] not here to take credit for
[31:00] anything the the reality is the only
[31:02] reason that we're gathered in this
[31:03] building is the grace of God there is
[31:06] nothing else that gathered us here but
[31:09] God's grace nothing else because he's
[31:12] chosen you from the very beginning to be
[31:16] a dental assistant or a podiatrist or an
[31:18] IT person or a lawyer or a preacher or
[31:21] whatever it is that you or a janitor or
[31:22] a farmer mechanic I don't whatever you
[31:25] do to make great coffee I mean you know
[31:28] that's to me that's an awesome thing and
[31:30] I'm not even a coffee drinker but you
[31:33] know he's chosen you for these
[31:35] particular things and that's all is
[31:38] Grace so it the credit going to someone
[31:41] doesn't matter and that was one of the
[31:43] things that Uzziah ran into is he
[31:45] started to think I can do more than what
[31:47] I'm doing and he was wanting to take
[31:48] credit for stuff that he shouldn't have
[31:50] done right but in her heart and in
[31:54] Deborah's heart that wasn't the case she
[31:56] was like hey I'll go with you but her
[31:59] intent wasn't going she didn't say
[32:00] coming right out of the gate you know
[32:02] what I'm going to lead this battle
[32:03] you're going to do the fighting but I'm
[32:05] going to be out there in the Forefront
[32:06] everybody's going to know who I am
[32:08] everybody's going to see me that wasn't
[32:10] her heart from the very beginning her
[32:12] heart was to just Lord told me what to
[32:14] do here's what I need to do I'm going to
[32:15] move on and and that's the way she
[32:18] played
[32:21] it Psalms the 20th chapter and the 7th
[32:24] verse says this some trust in chariots
[32:28] and some in horses but we will remember
[32:30] the name of the Lord Our God
[32:34] yes so as Believers we understand
[32:37] this that there are natural things that
[32:40] some people trust in and there are
[32:42] man-made things that some people trust
[32:44] in but if you're placing your trust in
[32:47] either no matter what it is you'll
[32:50] always be
[32:52] disappointed Nature's awesome you know
[32:54] we talk about eagles in message churches
[32:57] a lot you know in fact brings up a good
[33:00] point you know what's interesting about
[33:02] eagles is you can pretty much go to any
[33:05] church it doesn't matter what their
[33:07] belief is their system is if you say
[33:10] bless God brother you're an eagle or
[33:12] bless God sister you're an eagle they
[33:13] say Glory hallelujah amen any message
[33:17] church now if if you say I'm an eagle
[33:20] they like wait a second I don't know
[33:23] about that but you do have a revelation
[33:26] about me and you got it right
[33:28] no matter where you go you can go to the
[33:30] Philippines you can go I don't care
[33:32] where you go Canada doesn't matter you
[33:34] can go to the southern tip of Africa if
[33:36] there's a message believer there I'm an
[33:37] eagle now they might be an African eagle
[33:40] or a Philippine eagle or American bald
[33:42] eagle or a brown you know whatever Eagle
[33:44] there's 60 some varieties of eagles so
[33:46] but it's a universal thing right I'm an
[33:50] eagle everybody's an eagle in my group
[33:54] but they don't always you know they
[33:55] don't always think that you're an eagle
[33:57] and that's one of the interesting things
[33:59] about the way things go is that some at
[34:03] some point in our mindset we have to get
[34:05] off of the idea that I'm the eagle and
[34:07] everybody else is
[34:09] chickens because you're not going to
[34:11] support any any life doing that there's
[34:14] no way to support it you just can't
[34:18] because you're always going to have an
[34:19] attitude it's your heart again right
[34:21] it's the heart of the person and what
[34:22] they're
[34:24] doing okay third clue it can provide
[34:27] sure
[34:30] Direction okay so we three Clues now got
[34:33] two more to go so we're almost we're
[34:34] getting
[34:36] there
[34:39] so um this is going to be a lengthy
[34:41] quote that I'm going to read in fact I
[34:44] have two and they're going to sound very
[34:45] familiar to you but I just to me this
[34:48] really brings out um in in in the life
[34:53] of the Prophet something that I think is
[34:55] a really good lesson for us to learn
[34:57] so um this is from when uh Divine love
[34:59] is projected Sovereign Grace takes its
[35:01] place it says the house had been full
[35:03] all day and I went out and my little
[35:05] children little Sarah and Rebecca at
[35:07] least this congregation you've heard
[35:09] this just recently so but we're going to
[35:11] repeat it anyway so uh and Rebecca were
[35:14] fighting over some play blocks little
[35:15] Joseph the baby sitting in the floor
[35:17] screaming to the top of his voice wife
[35:18] in the kitchen with her face buried into
[35:20] her hands of weeping and when I finally
[35:22] got the house emptied some in this room
[35:23] and some in that room some in the
[35:25] basement I walked in I thought oh what a
[35:26] confusion she put her arms around me and
[35:28] she said Billy I'm going crazy said I
[35:31] haven't been able to get the children's
[35:32] any dinner and I this is astounding to
[35:36] me in this particular thing that brother
[35:37] Brandon is recounting he says sometimes
[35:39] raging maniacs and saying it reverently
[35:41] so he's trying to say it poly a bunch of
[35:44] sometimes Fanatics so you can't even
[35:46] imagine what it was like in his home
[35:48] running back and forth the house saying
[35:49] the Lord said this and the Lord said if
[35:51] I ain't your manager and the Lord said
[35:53] this and so he's dealing with all these
[35:55] people that are coming through the home
[35:57] and just spouting off just crazy stuff
[36:00] and which he has no revelation of but
[36:02] they have a great revelation of it it's
[36:03] amazing uh how much they really caught
[36:06] this Revelation and he says this now if
[36:08] the Lord wouldn't talk to me about that
[36:10] if he had something to say but you can't
[36:13] help it it's just in the human line and
[36:15] that's what we're always dealing with
[36:17] right it's the human line that we're
[36:18] having to to to get through and she said
[36:22] the children hasn't had anything to eat
[36:23] and I don't know what to do well I
[36:25] thought now there's just one thing to do
[36:28] now I'm tired but I'm going to do this
[36:31] now heavenly father in my heart you help
[36:32] me to to be what you would have me to be
[36:34] on this scene you folks that remember
[36:37] the sermon to help me to be what I would
[36:39] be on this scene and I thought now if I
[36:42] can get just get her quiet so I said
[36:44] Sweetheart would you rush out with me
[36:45] for dinner oh I have to clean up the
[36:48] children and this and that and you could
[36:50] hardly hear yourself think little Joseph
[36:52] just to beat in the floor as hard as he
[36:53] could so I slipped over and I got an
[36:55] apron
[36:59] okay is he getting out of his Lane
[37:02] here because brother Brandon's slipping
[37:04] over and putting on an apron now some of
[37:05] the sisters are saying amen Brothers
[37:07] listen to what he's
[37:09] saying think about that apron right now
[37:12] but in that era of time you have to
[37:15] understand what he's doing because the
[37:17] housewife had a particular role and her
[37:19] role was to take care of the home right
[37:21] to do the dishes you did do certain
[37:23] things and so all of a sudden he's going
[37:25] right out of his
[37:28] laying as a husband and AE of a
[37:30] household in that era of time and I'm
[37:33] putting on an
[37:34] apron right I slipped over and got an
[37:38] apron and put it around me and I began
[37:40] to help her and I said honey you know
[37:41] what I saw the prettiest dress the other
[37:43] day I just so wanted to get it for you
[37:45] and it was in a certain city just here
[37:46] close and we'll go get it and all the
[37:49] time in my heart praying so again
[37:52] where's his
[37:54] heart right cuz it certainly looks like
[37:56] he slipped out of the lane as a husband
[37:58] of of the 50s like what is he doing
[38:03] right you have to understand now I I
[38:05] understand For You Young Folks it's
[38:07] difficult to to to understand what what
[38:09] that era was like but in that era
[38:12] children were seen and and not heard I
[38:15] don't know how many times I heard that
[38:17] growing up children should be seen and
[38:19] not
[38:19] heard nowadays children love to be seen
[38:22] and heard all the time but in that day
[38:25] you did not if you were in a group of
[38:26] adults you you were quiet that was the
[38:29] way it was discipline was a very
[38:32] straight way of doing things the role of
[38:36] of husband and wife was a very set like
[38:39] this was the way it was so now here you
[38:41] see what his heart is cuz he's he's
[38:44] saying all the time in my heart praying
[38:45] Heavenly Father quiet in this dear
[38:46] little woman and I put my hand on her
[38:49] not knowing her not knowing what I was
[38:51] doing I'd say yes honey oh it was
[38:53] beautiful oh Lord quiet in this little
[38:55] woman and just kept on you know her not
[38:58] knowing what was I doing was projecting
[39:00] creating a different atmosphere says so
[39:03] he says this walk in the love of God and
[39:04] have Fellowship so his wife at that
[39:08] moment needed life
[39:09] support right so he had to get out of
[39:12] his Lane of the
[39:14] day he wasn't a creeper do you
[39:17] understand he had to get out of the lane
[39:19] of that day to get into a lane where he
[39:22] could actually help her to get over this
[39:25] particular situation not just her but
[39:27] the whole family because the whole
[39:29] family was in turmoil the house was in
[39:31] turmoil everything is in turmoil all
[39:33] kinds of things are happening right now
[39:35] and this problem needs to be fixed it
[39:38] needs life support and in his heart it
[39:40] wasn't I'm going to put an apron on
[39:42] every day I'm sure sister Brandon would
[39:45] have loved that but that wasn't and he
[39:47] it wasn't like I'm going to take over
[39:48] your job and show you how to do this
[39:50] right he wasn't telling her honey you
[39:53] just don't know what you're doing with
[39:54] the kids let me make dinner I'll show
[39:55] you how to do the dish is I can run this
[39:57] house that wasn't his heart his heart
[40:00] was to step in and support her in her
[40:02] hour of
[40:04] need still being a prophet still having
[40:07] all these other things that he was
[40:08] having to deal with all the you know all
[40:09] the crazy maniac people that were in the
[40:11] house and coming in and saying oh you
[40:14] you're you're Christ you're something
[40:15] and I want to I want to be the guy that
[40:17] manages you know Jesus Christ in the
[40:19] flesh today uh he's dealing with all
[40:22] these different things but he steps out
[40:25] to get into her
[40:26] area to help her to support her now we
[40:30] understand this and I don't know if I
[40:31] said it at the beginning but the Lord
[40:33] will never do anything that's against
[40:34] his word we know that that's right so
[40:37] when Uzziah got out of his Lane he was
[40:40] going against what the word of the Lord
[40:41] was but when Deborah was doing what she
[40:43] was doing she was in the will of God she
[40:45] was still in the lane that that the Lord
[40:47] had created for her she was the one that
[40:50] could do that and brother Brandon's
[40:51] doing the same thing
[40:54] here okay fourth clue
[40:57] it can change
[41:02] technology so this next quote's going to
[41:04] be a little bit
[41:06] lengthy but I I think when we get to the
[41:08] end of it you'll understand why I have
[41:11] this one on here as well so again this
[41:13] is Brother brandom this is what is the
[41:15] works of God he says just reminds me one
[41:18] time I believe it was down in Georgia
[41:19] there was a little lady and it was very
[41:21] crowded in the auditorium this should be
[41:23] a familiar story to everybody and there
[41:25] was a little woman setting on the front
[41:26] seat just a typical little Southern
[41:28] mother and she had compassion on a woman
[41:30] rocking around with a little baby in her
[41:32] arms and there was not even hardly
[41:34] standing room so she thought that's the
[41:37] reason she was feeling so sorry for the
[41:39] little woman and so said the holy spirit
[41:41] said to her go pray for that
[41:44] baby oh she said back ever what was that
[41:47] spoke to me I will not pray for that
[41:50] baby now just to stop there for just a
[41:53] second you know brother brandom said and
[41:55] I I think it bears repeating is that one
[41:57] of the things you don't want to say is I
[41:59] will never do
[42:00] that one one time he's like he saw a
[42:03] woman dancing in the spirit and he said
[42:06] oh that's ridiculous I can't believe it
[42:08] I will never do that if you want to
[42:10] dance in the spirit just say I'll never
[42:12] do it because it could happen to you so
[42:15] don't say I will never do it because you
[42:17] don't know what God has in store for you
[42:18] or what you need so bear in mind at this
[42:22] particular time so and let's put it to
[42:25] to you this way brother random had the
[42:27] most prolific Healing Ministry since the
[42:30] time of Jesus
[42:32] Christ thousands upon thousands are
[42:35] healed of all kinds of manners of
[42:37] diseases dead are raised to life I mean
[42:39] this this hasn't happened in thousands
[42:41] of years so here's this woman she's in a
[42:44] meeting with a man who is known to be
[42:47] throughout the United States and other
[42:49] parts of the world of faith healer is
[42:51] what they called them and has the most
[42:53] prolific Healing Ministry around
[42:57] now I I've run into people personally so
[43:01] this is one of my personal things that
[43:03] you would think that they were the
[43:04] people that walked on water like like
[43:08] they had accomplished so much in their
[43:10] life and it's you know and they they
[43:11] love to tell you about all the things
[43:13] they've accomplished in their life
[43:15] here's someone that's really
[43:16] accomplished something but it's not him
[43:19] because what did he say over and over
[43:21] again I was just there when he came
[43:24] right when he showed up I'm not a faith
[43:28] healer God does the healing I was just
[43:31] there when he showed up I was I just
[43:34] happened to be the one that he used in
[43:36] this situation and that's one of the
[43:38] things that why we can't take credit for
[43:40] this thing because God's just using
[43:43] Uzziah the reason that he had so much
[43:46] success the reason that all those things
[43:48] were working for him is because he kept
[43:50] the Lord at the Forefront he kept his
[43:52] eyes on the Lord and the Lord was giving
[43:55] him success because of that Deborah same
[43:57] situation her eyes were on the Lord the
[43:59] Lord's telling her what to do and that
[44:01] situation is righted in fact they had 40
[44:03] Years of Peace after she led that battle
[44:06] with with Barack because she had her
[44:09] eyes in the right place and as long as
[44:11] eyes are in the right place they're
[44:13] doing the right thing right so as long
[44:16] as you're there that that right thing is
[44:18] taking place so here's a little
[44:21] woman sitting in the church service with
[44:25] a man praying for the sick and and
[44:27] people being healed of all kinds of
[44:28] cancers and other things all this is
[44:30] happening right
[44:32] now that Mother's holding a prayer card
[44:34] that she just received so she sees that
[44:36] this woman has got a prayer card so not
[44:39] only is she in the service now she's got
[44:41] a prayer card and she's got a good
[44:43] chance of going up there and she said
[44:45] that Mother's holding a prayer card that
[44:47] she just received and brother Brandon
[44:48] will be praying for that baby tonight if
[44:49] it's called in the prayer line so this
[44:51] is the woman's thinking and said I would
[44:53] never go pray for that baby there you go
[44:56] Don't Say Never and the Holy Spirit said
[44:59] go pray for that
[45:01] baby and it kept upon her heart so
[45:03] strong that she couldn't get away from
[45:05] that conviction so after a while she
[45:07] thought well I will give that woman my
[45:08] seat so she can sit down with the baby
[45:11] and that'll give me an opportunity to
[45:12] get it off my mind and so you know it's
[45:14] always best to obey what the holy spirit
[45:16] says do and I think we can say
[45:18] Amen sometimes it's not like Pleasant
[45:21] because it may not be something that you
[45:23] enjoy
[45:24] doing but if you're doing what the Lord
[45:27] is telling you to do it's the right
[45:29] thing to
[45:34] do um lost my place
[45:39] there uh where was I at
[45:42] sorry don't talk back oh don't talk back
[45:45] thank you don't talk back just obedience
[45:47] you might not understand why but do it
[45:49] anyhow if it's the Holy Spirit God is
[45:52] always right yes God's always right
[45:55] right so so then when that little woman
[45:57] passed by again she raised up and said
[45:59] sister pardon me he said I see you've
[46:00] got a sick baby there she said yes it's
[46:03] very bad something and he says I forget
[46:06] what it was wrong with it just at the
[46:07] time now she said it's very ill and said
[46:11] we brought it uh for maybe perhaps that
[46:13] brother Brandon would pray for it and
[46:15] she said I see you're holding a prayer
[46:16] card she said yes I'm hoping that it'll
[46:19] be called in the prayer line tonight and
[46:21] she said honey you got to love
[46:23] Southerners honey would you be seeing
[46:25] that you are a Christian would you just
[46:26] give me the opportunity to relieve my
[46:28] soul of a burden that the Holy Spirit
[46:29] has put upon me she said why go right
[46:32] ahead what is it and she said the Holy
[46:33] Spirit wants me to pray for that baby
[46:36] said would you mind if I just prayed for
[46:38] it to get it off my mind and said I've
[46:40] been watching you for about half an hour
[46:42] said if you'll let me do that I'll give
[46:44] you my seat here and she said why you
[46:47] don't have to give me this seat dear
[46:49] said certainly pray for the baby and the
[46:51] little mother laid her hands on the
[46:52] little baby and she said just a few
[46:55] words of simple pray prayer and she gave
[46:56] her the seat and she went she went up
[47:00] into the balcony so balcony people there
[47:04] you go now unfortunately you're not as
[47:06] good as this balcony because it says
[47:07] maybe something like this around two
[47:09] three balconies high so we've got a ways
[47:11] to go we got two or three more to add on
[47:14] and there was a gentleman up there oh by
[47:16] the way brother Freddy that's our
[47:17] balcony yeah so if you want to sit in
[47:21] the nose bed section that's it it's
[47:23] about 8 inches higher than down here so
[47:26] and there was a gentleman up there who
[47:27] had just seen the lady and said take
[47:29] this seat Well about 5 10 minutes from
[47:31] them I come in and spoke for a few
[47:33] moments and I said we will call the
[47:34] prayer cards now and I I like the way he
[47:36] says I spoke for a few moments because
[47:37] that's what I'm doing I'm speaking for a
[47:39] few moments okay just a few moments and
[47:41] I said we will call the prayer cards now
[47:43] and I said now last night we called at a
[47:45] certain place until T night we'll call
[47:47] at another place and so whatever the
[47:49] Lord put upon my mind where it was and
[47:52] most of you are acquainted with the
[47:53] meeting and that's where I called and it
[47:55] happened to be that little mother was so
[47:57] happy because her baby was about second
[48:00] or third in line so here she is she gets
[48:02] called she's like right at the beginning
[48:03] of the line this is awesome because the
[48:06] people at the start of the line
[48:07] definitely got you know they get the
[48:09] discernment they get they get the full
[48:10] treatment like you might if you're at
[48:12] the end of the line you might just get
[48:14] hey everybody you know here you go we're
[48:17] going to say the prayer of faith amen
[48:19] but this was like you got you're so and
[48:21] so you lived at this place you get the
[48:22] full you know the full in lot is coming
[48:25] and it happened to be that the little
[48:27] mother was so happy because her baby was
[48:28] second or third in line so as she come
[48:29] up before the platform to be prayed for
[48:31] of course the only way I catch it is on
[48:33] tape you see because it's a vision so
[48:36] he's saying here's where he's telling
[48:37] you who's in
[48:39] control who who's the one running this
[48:42] show after it's over I mean that's how I
[48:44] understand it then the holy spirit said
[48:46] to the little woman told her who she was
[48:48] and said you have your baby for a
[48:49] certain cause and that was right and she
[48:51] said but said the baby's already been
[48:53] healed Imagine This the blessing is on
[48:56] the baby and he says there was a little
[48:59] woman that's got a certain colored hair
[49:02] wearing a little Checker dress and said
[49:04] that's her setting up in the
[49:09] balcony this is this is striking to me
[49:13] I yeah I it's it's so you know that's
[49:17] her sitting up in the balcony there she
[49:18] is there's the person sitting in the
[49:20] balcony right
[49:21] there and right up there and the Lord
[49:24] has just healed baby and you see how the
[49:27] Holy Spirit works that woman thought
[49:29] because I was the
[49:31] Evangelist he's the
[49:33] prophet faith healer if you want to say
[49:35] that prolific Ministry but she thought
[49:39] cuz I was the Evangelist oh I had the
[49:41] powers to do the healing well he
[49:43] definitely had power because it was
[49:44] being evidenced right in front of her
[49:46] and had been multiple times over and
[49:48] over
[49:49] again and she thought it should be me
[49:52] but see I couldn't have compassion on
[49:54] that baby like that mother mother could
[49:57] now that mother may have never prayed
[49:58] for another person and another person
[50:00] got healed in her rest of her life but
[50:02] at that moment in time she was the one
[50:06] that the Lord saw fit to step out of her
[50:09] Lane if you want to say she got maybe
[50:13] she didn't have a gift of healing we
[50:14] don't know I I don't know her history
[50:16] anything maybe brother Aon maybe you
[50:18] know I I don't know or brother Freddy I
[50:20] I don't know what her history was but I
[50:22] do know one thing on this particular day
[50:25] it was her that had the compassion that
[50:28] was necessary for that baby's healing
[50:31] because if brother brandom had been the
[50:32] one that was supposed to do it he would
[50:34] have been the one that did it so
[50:36] somebody else stepped into that role for
[50:38] a time for life support that was their
[50:42] job life support so they became that
[50:45] channel just for that moment in time yes
[50:48] and the Lord does this all the time so I
[50:52] want just finish with this and the Holy
[50:55] Spirit Spirit didn't choose for me to
[50:57] pray for the baby it chose the little
[50:59] mother to pray for the baby how about
[51:02] that the Holy Spirit made a choice I've
[51:05] got a Prophet this is a prophet from his
[51:07] birth all these different things have
[51:09] happened to this Prophet you've got a
[51:10] light shining outside his window all
[51:12] these things this preaching these
[51:13] different Revelations are coming I know
[51:15] what he's going to do in the future all
[51:17] these things are going to happen I
[51:18] haven't chose
[51:20] you sis I chose you
[51:23] amen and some people think she got it
[51:26] she was cre a creeper she was getting
[51:29] out of her Lane but she wasn't it was
[51:32] life support that's what she was doing
[51:35] this was life support that was happening
[51:37] right there and God honored and healed
[51:40] that baby and it got absolutely well we
[51:43] received its testimony see it pays to
[51:45] obey what the spirit says do do it
[51:49] quickly amen what the spirit says do do
[51:52] it quickly so just going back to to to
[51:57] kind of the Genesis of
[51:59] this fear gets in the church it
[52:03] shouldn't but because people hear things
[52:07] or they have a perception of something
[52:10] what sometimes we forget is God has
[52:12] placed Us in the position just like
[52:16] kingdoms and rulers and everything else
[52:20] if God's placed somebody in a position
[52:21] to be a deacon or a pastor or whatever
[52:23] God's placed them there and if God wants
[52:26] them out of there God will move them out
[52:29] they don't have to worry about brother
[52:31] Aaron doesn't have to worry about his
[52:32] position as Pastor brother Freddy you
[52:33] don't have to worry because God has
[52:35] placed you there when you're placed in a
[52:37] position don't worry about the position
[52:39] that you've been placed in that
[52:41] somebody's going to take it away you
[52:43] know one of the things that's happened
[52:44] in the message and it's a really sad
[52:45] thing is competition has become a thing
[52:48] yes amen it has become something that
[52:50] has overwhelmed the church yes and this
[52:52] is a contest and in the contest every
[52:55] everybody that enters wins it's
[52:58] amazing it's not a beauty contest where
[53:00] there's first second and third prize if
[53:02] you enter the contest whether you enter
[53:04] late or at the start doesn't come in the
[53:07] middle it doesn't matter everybody wins
[53:10] because all you got to do is finish the
[53:12] race and at the end the prize is exactly
[53:14] the same everybody receives eternal life
[53:17] it's an amazing thing but you wouldn't
[53:19] know in the church that that's the case
[53:22] because there's a competition there's a
[53:24] competition between ministers who's the
[53:25] better Minister how can I preach it
[53:27] better you know you know I need to pull
[53:29] these people cuz people need to
[53:31] understand how good I am at doing this
[53:33] it's like that's wonderful guess what if
[53:35] you're really good at doing that who
[53:36] gave you the gift to begin with yeah
[53:39] right it wasn't you right I don't know
[53:43] maybe they're standing in front of the
[53:44] mirror practicing a lot and getting
[53:45] really good at public speaking me
[53:48] personally I hated public speaking I
[53:50] never thought I would be a public
[53:51] speaker because if there was a part in
[53:53] the play that I had to do in school I
[53:55] took the part where nobody spoke like I
[53:57] was the guy that just moved through but
[53:59] you never know what God's going to place
[54:01] you in so who gave me the ability
[54:03] definitely wasn't me cuz I didn't even
[54:05] want it but there you go it's the Lord
[54:08] that does these things it's the Lord
[54:10] that raises people up and so what the
[54:13] spirit says do do that cuz that's always
[54:16] going to be right with and he'll never
[54:18] go against his word so if you're worried
[54:21] about it check it with the word does
[54:23] this does this take me out where I'm
[54:25] supposed to be is am I a creeper now no
[54:28] just look at the word look in the
[54:30] message if you're worried about it just
[54:32] look in the message but don't be so
[54:34] worried about the fear and and
[54:36] depression and anxiety that might come
[54:39] from people in church because that's not
[54:42] to be there if you're going to get
[54:44] relief from it you should be coming to
[54:46] church that's where you can get relief
[54:48] this is the place to get it from it
[54:50] shouldn't ever be put upon the
[54:54] people number five it can unlock secrets
[54:58] so this is your last clue can unlock
[55:10] secrets so let's just read a quote from
[55:12] the God of this evil
[55:14] age says this and when the entire word
[55:16] of God incomplete was headed up in a
[55:18] human body called Jesus Christ and there
[55:20] God made me pay for my sins in him there
[55:23] then he rose me Raised Me Up with him in
[55:25] the resurrection and now we are seated
[55:27] with him with power and authority over
[55:28] every devil oh if you could only believe
[55:30] what God has given but if you're not
[55:32] seated there you don't have it and if
[55:34] you're seated there and don't believe it
[55:35] and afraid to move you'll never use it
[55:38] right but here's a key to what he's
[55:40] saying but if you are seated there yes
[55:42] you will use it for you're ordained to
[55:44] do it yes do what you do so what's he
[55:47] saying look at you're seated there and
[55:48] you don't believe it so some of us have
[55:50] doubt sometimes right and then he also
[55:53] says and you're afraid to move move some
[55:55] of us have fear
[55:57] sometimes sometimes it's ourselves
[55:59] putting the fear on ourselves and
[56:01] sometimes it's other people putting it
[56:02] on us you know it's all satan let's face
[56:05] it right it's all the enemy that does it
[56:07] he's just using you you or or somebody
[56:09] else because he's working through humans
[56:11] right we're not we're not fighting a
[56:13] battle we're fighting against
[56:14] principalities and powers and and
[56:15] spiritual wickedness in high places and
[56:17] there's no higher place than the human
[56:18] heart Saints so that's what we're
[56:21] battling we're not battling the people
[56:23] we understand it's a spirit that's
[56:24] behind it whether it gets on you or it
[56:25] gets on somebody else that gets on you
[56:27] that fear is coming there but I want you
[56:29] to pay really close attention to what
[56:30] brother Ram says but if you're seated
[56:33] there you will use it for you're
[56:35] ordained to do what you do so what's he
[56:38] telling you if you have unbelief
[56:40] sometimes or if you have fear sometimes
[56:42] don't worry because you're ordained to
[56:45] get rid of that at some point in your
[56:46] life it may not be this moment in time
[56:49] when I'm speaking or brother Aaron or
[56:50] brother Freddy or somebody else's but at
[56:52] some point in your life God's going to
[56:54] get a hold of you and the Holy Ghost is
[56:56] going to come and settle upon you and
[56:58] whatever doubt that you have it'll go
[57:00] away and whatever fear that you have
[57:01] that's going to go away as well because
[57:03] that's going to be moved out of the way
[57:06] because God has ordained it to be so do
[57:08] you know what believers do they believe
[57:12] it's an amazing thing it's like who
[57:14] would have thought Believers
[57:16] believe astounding right but that's what
[57:19] we do cuz you're created for that
[57:22] purpose whether you're a farmer or a
[57:24] dental assistant or you're a podiatrist
[57:26] or an IT person or what or your a
[57:27] housewife or whatever you do you were
[57:30] created for that purpose and you orain
[57:33] to it and you can do things that maybe a
[57:37] housewife doesn't normally do so this is
[57:39] a a person remember that story we just
[57:41] read it was a housewife right
[57:43] right not a faith
[57:46] healer right but God placed her and
[57:50] chose her to do what she needed to do
[57:52] for life
[57:53] support
[57:57] and just continuing on with that
[57:58] particular quote and when the entire
[58:00] word of God incomplete was headed up and
[58:01] oh did I repeat that I did sorry skip
[58:05] that one again I need an
[58:08] editor okay so there's going to be a big
[58:11] reveal it's very exciting I'm glad
[58:13] you're sitting down
[58:15] because so did anybody want to offer a
[58:19] guess of what the particular thing or
[58:21] things I was talking about
[58:23] is
[58:28] it's okay you don't have to guess I'm
[58:29] just asking if anybody wants to to to
[58:32] offer a guess
[58:35] so no but that's awesome answer yeah
[58:39] it's definitely an inspiration to
[58:40] Nations and individuals it unlock it
[58:42] does all those things
[58:43] yes no but that's a good answer
[58:46] too you're going to be really
[58:48] disappointed when I tell you what this
[58:49] answer is because those are those are
[58:52] awesome a paper it is
[58:55] it is a paper
[58:57] clip so Brothers if you could open the
[58:59] the thing that says pic on
[59:08] it and just go to the first
[59:18] picture there is
[59:20] suspense now some of these pictures
[59:22] aren't as good as I would have liked to
[59:24] them to be
[59:25] but so you have a paperclip go to the
[59:29] next
[59:30] picture so you can use a paper clip to
[59:32] unlock a diary where secrets are
[59:35] contained yeah so it can unlock Secrets
[59:38] boys don't do that to your sisters or
[59:40] other siblings sisters to sisters or
[59:43] anybody else just stay out of people's
[59:46] Diaries so the purpose of this picture
[59:49] is like so I can use a paperclip to
[59:51] unlock that lock but what works better
[59:53] the thing that was design designed for
[59:55] it so if the thing that's designed for
[59:57] it is there and that's what you have
[59:59] available to you use it but there's a
[1:00:03] lesson here in in all these things so if
[1:00:06] you got the thing designed great but if
[1:00:09] you
[1:00:09] don't you might need a paper
[1:00:12] clip go ahead to the
[1:00:14] next so this is a compass it's actually
[1:00:18] made with a paper clip take a magnet put
[1:00:20] it on the tip and we're going to
[1:00:22] actually show you something in just a
[1:00:23] little bit here but let's come go to the
[1:00:25] next
[1:00:26] slide so would you rather have a compass
[1:00:30] or a
[1:00:31] paperclip but the reality is if you're
[1:00:33] in a pinch and you don't got a compass
[1:00:35] and you got a paper clip and a magnet
[1:00:37] you can make one and if you need to find
[1:00:40] your way North you can find it yeah
[1:00:42] because it's magnetized to it go on to
[1:00:44] the next
[1:00:45] one changing
[1:00:48] technology right changes technology it's
[1:00:51] what you do you didn't even know you
[1:00:53] were changing technology when when you
[1:00:54] mess with your phone but you're changing
[1:00:56] technology go ahead to the next one but
[1:00:58] what works better is the thing that's
[1:01:00] designed for it but in a pinch guess
[1:01:02] what I use a paper clip I'll I do
[1:01:05] because that's what I do go ahead to the
[1:01:07] next one so this I I don't know if you
[1:01:09] can tell but that's actually a missile
[1:01:11] and I'm sorry this is off of YouTube so
[1:01:13] the picture is not so great go to the
[1:01:15] next one so this is a man named mcgyver
[1:01:19] which was a a show taking a paperclip
[1:01:22] and diffusing a bomb
[1:01:25] because this is a weapon of mass
[1:01:27] destruction and yeah he could probably
[1:01:29] make one too he he made stuff out of a
[1:01:31] lot of stuff it was amazing but what
[1:01:34] would work better than that go to the
[1:01:36] next picture is to actually have the
[1:01:38] thing that programs the missile to begin
[1:01:41] with right but in a pinch if I don't
[1:01:43] have the thing to program it you bet I'm
[1:01:45] going to disarm it with a paper
[1:01:48] clip go to the next
[1:01:50] one so and this one it's used to mark
[1:01:54] your place and the thing about a
[1:01:57] paperclip it works great I wouldn't say
[1:02:00] don't use it for a book but one of the
[1:02:01] things that's a danger to it is if you
[1:02:03] have really thin Pages it'll catch and
[1:02:06] rip those pages so what works
[1:02:08] better so a bookmarker because it marks
[1:02:10] your place in history right paper clips
[1:02:13] Mark your place in history that's what
[1:02:14] they do they can but a bookmarks better
[1:02:19] right but doesn't mean you can't use it
[1:02:22] right uh go to the next
[1:02:25] one so during World War II a paper clip
[1:02:27] was a symbol of Norwegian resistance go
[1:02:29] to the next picture so this is a picture
[1:02:31] of Norwegian Fighters I could not find a
[1:02:33] closeup of where you could see a paper
[1:02:35] clip on them but what they would do is
[1:02:36] actually clip it to the lapel and what
[1:02:39] it was a symbol of um was to show that
[1:02:42] they're they're bound together they're
[1:02:44] United go to the next one so the
[1:02:46] Norwegians took this really
[1:02:48] seriously and this is in Norway that
[1:02:51] giant paper clip and that's also a paper
[1:02:54] clip bench and so this is an interesting
[1:02:57] thing about the paperclip that you see
[1:02:59] there uh a Norwegian man was credited
[1:03:02] with having designed the paperclip only
[1:03:04] the problem was is that he didn't
[1:03:06] actually Design This paperclip he
[1:03:08] designed a different paperclip and it
[1:03:11] was never actually used it was never put
[1:03:13] into production but because somebody
[1:03:15] wrote that he was the one that designed
[1:03:17] it that became actually something that
[1:03:20] inspired a nation and the the women
[1:03:23] would wear it as a bracelet spit around
[1:03:24] their their wrist and in fact not just
[1:03:26] them but the French did something
[1:03:28] similar with a paper clip so here it is
[1:03:31] something that's an inspiration to a
[1:03:32] nation so the paperclip was designed to
[1:03:37] hold papers that was its original design
[1:03:41] and your original design is whatever it
[1:03:43] is that God has intended for you but in
[1:03:47] that original design it doesn't mean
[1:03:49] that you can't do something in a role of
[1:03:52] life support for the bride it doesn't
[1:03:55] mean that you can't be life support for
[1:03:57] your neighbor or for your family now
[1:04:00] paperclip does a wonderful job of
[1:04:02] holding a group together and that may be
[1:04:05] what you do maybe you have no other role
[1:04:07] but to to hold a group together maybe
[1:04:09] you're the housewife mother that's
[1:04:11] holding a group together that's where
[1:04:13] you really Excel but don't be surprised
[1:04:15] if God uses you for something else if
[1:04:17] you could open the next um little folder
[1:04:19] it'll say video on
[1:04:22] it so we're coming to a close I know
[1:04:25] everybody loves to hear that we're
[1:04:27] almost
[1:04:28] there I'm into my second half hour sorry
[1:04:31] we're we're we're but we're almost there
[1:04:34] so you you almost get to stretch shortly
[1:04:37] so one of the things that that um I did
[1:04:40] with this particular thing was actually
[1:04:41] made a
[1:04:42] compass and um uh I took um Josh there
[1:04:47] actually loan me his one of his
[1:04:49] compasses from his Wildland class and uh
[1:04:52] so I I tried to make a video I'm hoping
[1:04:55] it plays if not I'll explain to you if
[1:04:57] you can just play
[1:04:58] it and I I don't have a gift of
[1:05:01] photography for like sister Morgan or
[1:05:03] some of you other ones so I
[1:05:05] apologize but this the the one that's
[1:05:08] spinning here it's a that's the whole
[1:05:10] paper clip and I'm just marking to where
[1:05:12] it is and you see how this one so this
[1:05:14] is an actual compass pointing North you
[1:05:16] see how this one's already North and
[1:05:17] it's holding that line now eventually
[1:05:19] this this one here is going to start
[1:05:20] affecting it and pulling it but what
[1:05:23] this is to do is come right back into
[1:05:25] where it's going to Point North to so
[1:05:28] this one I had the magnets on for hours
[1:05:31] this when I put the magnets on for three
[1:05:35] minutes is that it brother brandom said
[1:05:38] that we had to be magnetized I want you
[1:05:40] to think of it this way within your
[1:05:42] system in your natural system you have
[1:05:44] blood everybody sees blood it burns it's
[1:05:47] red right and that red comes from Iron
[1:05:49] and iron is one of the things that is
[1:05:51] magnetic and it magnetizes you so we
[1:05:54] understand that this this um the paper
[1:05:56] clip which is made out of steel it has
[1:05:58] iron in it and that's what allows it to
[1:05:59] be magnetized to something and brother
[1:06:02] Ram said that we're magnetized by the
[1:06:04] Holy Ghost and I want you to think of it
[1:06:07] this way the blood that Jesus shed his
[1:06:09] natural blood went into the ground but
[1:06:12] the Holy Ghost token that comes back on
[1:06:14] you is magnetic because that blood token
[1:06:17] has the iron in it that's necessary for
[1:06:20] you to be magnetized to True North and
[1:06:22] True North is the word
[1:06:24] and it's always going to pull you to
[1:06:26] that word
[1:06:28] um you know what for the sake of time
[1:06:30] we'll just we'll we'll we'll skip
[1:06:31] reading the the um the the rest of that
[1:06:35] but anyways it's going to pull you to
[1:06:38] the word yes and it will always pull you
[1:06:40] to that because it's always going to be
[1:06:42] magnetic true north and the point of
[1:06:44] that three minute versus all those hours
[1:06:46] is if you're a person that's just
[1:06:48] exposed to the Holy Ghost you have the
[1:06:50] same ability to get swung to the right
[1:06:54] right direction and to get to the right
[1:06:56] place as a person that's been under that
[1:06:58] influence for years because magnetic
[1:07:01] north and the magnetics of the Holy
[1:07:04] Ghost work the same way and it's always
[1:07:06] going to pull you in the right direction
[1:07:08] so don't be upset if you're young and
[1:07:12] new and you know the the that experience
[1:07:15] with God has just started with you
[1:07:17] that's okay right because what's
[1:07:19] necessary in you is already there so if
[1:07:22] the musicians could come
[1:07:24] what's necessary in you is already
[1:07:27] there it's all that you need is already
[1:07:29] there everything just like those
[1:07:31] astronauts they they didn't even know
[1:07:33] what they needed but when they needed it
[1:07:36] there was somebody there to supply
[1:07:38] Supply the support to bring it out to
[1:07:40] show them in Mission Control God's in
[1:07:43] control of all of this that that mission
[1:07:46] he's on is is to get you to where he had
[1:07:49] an a mind for you in the very beginning
[1:07:51] you know brother brandom said he doesn't
[1:07:53] do it
[1:07:54] just because he wants to he does it
[1:07:56] because he said he would he said look at
[1:07:58] I'm going to make you you know into this
[1:08:01] bride I'm going to do this I'm going to
[1:08:03] make you with spot wrinkle and blemish
[1:08:05] I'm going to bring these things into
[1:08:07] your Forefront in your life I'm going to
[1:08:09] get you to where you need to do now he
[1:08:11] didn't have to do it he chose to do it
[1:08:14] and he said he would do it and therefore
[1:08:16] he's going to do it cuz that's what he
[1:08:18] promised to do and that's what his word
[1:08:19] promises to do so tonight Saints if you
[1:08:22] get nothing else out of this just
[1:08:24] have the idea that God might need you
[1:08:26] for life support and it might not be
[1:08:28] don't be afraid of what he's doing or
[1:08:31] where he's trying to get you to if
[1:08:33] somebody's put fear or depression or
[1:08:35] anxiety on you step away from that and
[1:08:38] understand that God can take you in a
[1:08:40] direction and he can point you to that
[1:08:43] true north and he always will point you
[1:08:45] to True North he'll always get you there
[1:08:48] amen and so and and just remember you're
[1:08:50] magnetized to him amen through the blood
[1:08:52] of Jesus Christ you are magnetized to
[1:08:55] him and you'll always as Believers
[1:08:58] you're always going to get there you
[1:09:00] might have some doubts you might have
[1:09:01] some fears but at some point you will
[1:09:04] get there so don't be afraid to pick up
[1:09:07] what God has for you and use it for his
[1:09:09] glory god bless you brother Aaron why
[1:09:11] don't you come please
