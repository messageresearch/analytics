[0:00] excited to get to that juncture tonight
[0:02] so hopefully we'll just be able to move
[0:05] quickly in this our title is just a
[0:07] little bit different tonight it's still
[0:09] the year in preview it is part six I
[0:12] believe on this subject but just a
[0:14] little bit of a Twist as we wrap up this
[0:16] series in the next few parts it's I know
[0:19] God's will for me this year we're not
[0:21] asking so much what is God's will for me
[0:23] this year we're saying I know God's will
[0:25] for me this year because we're kind of
[0:27] focusing on things that we've kind of
[0:29] already laid in there and established
[0:31] and set real firm on on Sundays talking
[0:33] about attending church and you're giving
[0:35] and uh supporting missions and we'll
[0:38] pick back up on that on Sunday morning
[0:40] but tonight we want to
[0:42] continue to emphasize the preview
[0:44] because this is how I'm wanting to
[0:46] express it that God has already laid the
[0:48] path out for us maybe a lot of
[0:50] particulars that we fill in in our
[0:51] individual lives but there's some common
[0:53] ground that we're all going to share
[0:54] this is something I could say is God's
[0:56] will for us for all of us who are here
[0:58] tonight regardless of your callings male
[1:00] or female young or old these are things
[1:02] I could say are God's will for us that
[1:04] his word has given us a path to follow a
[1:07] plan established our steps and told us
[1:09] where we can place our feet and on
[1:12] Wednesday nights we're touching on these
[1:13] three things to sanctify your home
[1:15] gather around the word and live for
[1:17] others very simple and we're looking at
[1:19] now not as a question but God's will for
[1:21] me this year is that I continue to or
[1:24] establish a level of sanctification
[1:26] within my dwelling and where I live to
[1:28] gather around the word I would even say
[1:30] even as an individual this is something
[1:32] that you can be doing and then live for
[1:34] others in the sanctify the home I think
[1:37] the phrase apply the token is
[1:38] appropriate to use for that but it's
[1:40] about creating a safe distance from the
[1:42] world or a safe Haven from the negative
[1:43] influences of the world or just some
[1:45] means a fuse so to speak that triggers
[1:48] when there's too much excess it goes too
[1:50] far there's a there's something in that
[1:51] home that can just immediately begin to
[1:53] step in and sanctify and wash and keep
[1:56] us from uh that lack of moderation that
[1:59] the world can begin to spin up and
[2:00] negatively impact us and then in
[2:02] gathering around the word
[2:04] we were looking at how that we want to
[2:06] give have a specific time where we set
[2:10] aside time to give the Lord attention in
[2:12] our lives and in our home life and we're
[2:15] kind of phrasing it even and putting God
[2:16] first and you could do this through
[2:18] praying and reading your Bible there's
[2:19] certain things you can do to put God
[2:21] first and I wanted to kind of tie into
[2:25] this service
[2:26] from last week but maybe just bring this
[2:28] in just as one point of emphasis before
[2:31] we move on to live for others is from
[2:32] the sermon Fellowship and this was a
[2:35] longer quote last Wednesday but I'm just
[2:38] reading the last portion he says I went
[2:39] into Mineo home and the children are are
[2:41] all gathered round for family prayer
[2:44] always he says God bless that family
[2:46] talked about how his daughters love to
[2:47] do that gather around them and they sit
[2:49] there wide-eyed and their eyes twinkling
[2:51] and love to pray and love to read the
[2:53] Bible love to be a part of it when we've
[2:55] had the discipline in our home and we
[2:58] begin to establish this as a young
[3:00] family it was actually it was something
[3:01] that our children just were enthusiastic
[3:03] about and they said can we do character
[3:05] and that's what we had called it for the
[3:06] first year or two it was just something
[3:08] they looked forward to and there's a lot
[3:09] of different ways we tried to engage
[3:10] them and enjoy it at that age that they
[3:13] were at the time but he says God bless
[3:14] that family this is the phrase I really
[3:16] want you to zero in on remember that's
[3:19] the tie that binds so this putting God
[3:22] first or this the sanctification of the
[3:24] home and then even the momentum of that
[3:27] to gathering around the word that's
[3:28] what's going to bind you together as a
[3:30] family that's what's going to give you
[3:31] some common ground and things to
[3:33] Fellowship on and the right kind of
[3:35] bonds that's going to pay off dividends
[3:37] there's going to be a time in your
[3:38] children's lives where maybe that you
[3:41] know maybe you have some camaraderie
[3:42] around natural things and that's
[3:44] wonderful in a relationship there's
[3:46] going to come a time when you want to be
[3:47] able to go to and talk to you more than
[3:49] just Sports
[3:50] and they're going to want to ask hard
[3:51] questions and they're going to open up
[3:53] to you and say hey I'm going through a
[3:54] difficult time or I've made a mistake
[3:55] and would you pray for me you need to
[3:57] have that kind of discipline where they
[3:59] know they can trust you in spiritual
[4:00] things he said that's the tithe that
[4:02] binds and he says if you did that in
[4:04] your home there wouldn't be so many
[4:05] divorce cases and he says and things
[4:08] going on the way there is so maybe
[4:09] that's a phrase that we should relate to
[4:11] a little bit more just the way things
[4:13] are and that that lack of continuity the
[4:16] lack of Harmony even the harmony between
[4:18] spouses gathering around the word is
[4:20] something that brings us closer together
[4:21] prayer softens your spirit
[4:23] it's just something that it does it'll
[4:25] soften your spirit reading the word
[4:27] induce you with wisdom so there's a way
[4:29] that even husband and wife would be
[4:31] joined closer together and not always
[4:32] maybe in uh come in competitive modes uh
[4:36] when you're around gathering around the
[4:38] word of God it says and things going on
[4:39] the way there is you have fellowship
[4:40] with each other and so I want to
[4:43] emphasize that that this gathering
[4:44] around the word is a it's a cement to
[4:46] relationships if there's a stickiness to
[4:49] it that draws us closer together and
[4:50] it's a tithe that binds and it's the
[4:52] strongest bind binder that we can have
[4:55] as a family
[4:56] now let's take a step further if you
[4:59] would like to even just turn in your
[5:00] Bibles to Second Corinthians will be
[5:01] coming to the scripture here in a moment
[5:03] but now on live for others and I want to
[5:05] phrase this at the outset and if you
[5:07] want to jot this down you certainly can
[5:09] but it is an often forgotten or at a
[5:12] minimum overlooked form of family
[5:14] entertainment
[5:18] are you thinking
[5:19] are you pondering that phrase at all a
[5:23] forgotten form of family entertainment
[5:25] living for others when I say live for
[5:26] others I want to at the outset tell you
[5:28] that this is real family entertainment
[5:31] to live for others and to live for
[5:34] others I'm wanting to maybe point to
[5:36] very specific Acts or even acts in
[5:38] general acts of service or
[5:40] thoughtfulness to others that that are
[5:41] edifying that are helpful there may be a
[5:43] lot of different ways that you as a
[5:45] family live for others there might be
[5:47] ways that you have specifically shown
[5:50] kindness to certain people or certain
[5:52] situations many of you have done that
[5:54] for Elizabeth and I get just how
[5:56] different ways you reach out and try to
[5:58] show acts of kindness or service or
[5:59] offer to do different things and those
[6:01] are all ways that we live for others
[6:04] in in thinking about this thought
[6:06] something that stood out to Elizabeth
[6:08] and I as a young couple and many of you
[6:10] know brother Robert and sister Jill
[6:11] McGary spelled differently maybe we
[6:13] could say they spell it right but it's
[6:15] brother Robert McGary they just seem to
[6:17] have a discipline in their family so
[6:19] sister Elizabeth I were impacted by this
[6:21] many years ago how they just kind of
[6:23] reached out and they did acts of service
[6:25] and they showed kindness and we
[6:27] recognize it as them Thinking Beyond
[6:29] themselves and living for others and it
[6:30] really spoke to us as a young family
[6:32] that we we appreciated this testimony
[6:35] that they had where they served beyond
[6:37] their own family and they live for other
[6:39] families and they found ways uh to to
[6:41] show kindness or to be friendly and
[6:43] reach out and so there may be people in
[6:46] your lives that you could even think of
[6:48] that seem to be uh selfless and they're
[6:50] always giving and they're always showing
[6:52] kindness and and I would want you to
[6:54] think about those things and we talk
[6:55] about living for others because that's
[6:58] what is being specifically referred to
[7:00] is this service to those Beyond yourself
[7:04] and living for others and I would even
[7:06] say this that it's it arrives at it's
[7:10] number three or number six however
[7:11] you're wanting to count this because I
[7:13] would say that this is the product of a
[7:15] Sanctified home that's gathering around
[7:17] the word
[7:18] that this is something you don't
[7:20] necessarily start with this because if
[7:22] you start with this and you're you're
[7:24] wanting to use this as a means to
[7:26] achieve uh you know some progress
[7:28] there's just a way to wear self and
[7:30] pride you're doing something that is
[7:32] service but there's a lot of selfishness
[7:34] in it there's a lot of pretense mixed up
[7:36] in it there's a lot of look at me what
[7:38] I'm doing wrapped up in it and there's
[7:39] not enough you know we're doing this
[7:41] whether anybody knows or not
[7:43] um one time we came home from a trip and
[7:45] we came home and our house was clean we
[7:46] had no idea who did it we had some
[7:48] suspicions and I'm thinking oh no
[7:50] somebody saw our house the way it was
[7:52] when we left but they just cleaned our
[7:54] house while we were gone and they didn't
[7:56] care to have any attention should I call
[7:57] their name out anybody want to know they
[7:59] didn't care for the attention they just
[8:01] wanted to do something nice and we
[8:02] appreciate it there's things that um if
[8:04] you I feel really feel that if we get it
[8:06] in the right order it's done in the
[8:08] right way for the right reasons and so
[8:10] sanctifying your heart and your life and
[8:12] your home and gathering around the word
[8:13] I think the order is important to
[8:17] um focus and I may be spending more time
[8:19] on this thought completely backed away
[8:20] from it I may just get into it in the
[8:23] month of February how do you like that
[8:24] for planning I already know what I'm
[8:26] going to preach in February possibly is
[8:28] on charity begins at home
[8:30] and there's certain things that we have
[8:31] to first have established at home before
[8:33] we can desire to be effective outside
[8:35] the home and so these are things that
[8:37] you gather around the word and you're
[8:39] saying to find your home it puts you in
[8:40] a wonderful position and the order is
[8:42] good to give you that momentum to then
[8:43] begin to think outside your home because
[8:45] a lot of people will serve others as a
[8:47] way of not attending to the problems
[8:49] they have in their own personal life
[8:51] right I mean this is there's just a lot
[8:53] of Liberty here to maybe go down this
[8:54] path that that just becomes an outlet or
[8:56] channel for an energy that they ought to
[8:58] be focusing back into their marriage
[9:00] back into their children back into their
[9:01] own personal lives and they can do
[9:03] everything for everybody else but they
[9:04] just have this barrier and this Liberty
[9:07] and freedom to really face the facts at
[9:09] home and do the things they ought to at
[9:10] home so by no means do I want to get it
[9:12] out of order I think these first two are
[9:14] important that the order is important
[9:15] that this is the the product of
[9:18] sanctifying your home and gathering
[9:19] around the word it just creates in you
[9:20] this spark to begin to think about other
[9:22] people's needs and now this scripture I
[9:25] want to use is the head of this thought
[9:26] because it
[9:28] it's used to speak of how that we ought
[9:30] to live for Christ but then that creates
[9:32] this domino effect of then being
[9:34] christ-like in second Corinthians 5 15
[9:36] and he that died
[9:38] and that he died for all that they which
[9:41] lived so he died for all but only those
[9:43] that live by that death they that they
[9:46] which live should not henceforth live
[9:48] unto themselves you don't live selfishly
[9:50] you're not living for your own means or
[9:52] your own desires but you live unto him
[9:54] but unto him which died for them and
[9:57] rose again
[9:58] that's just such a beautiful statement
[10:00] he that died for all
[10:02] died so that they that live would not
[10:05] just live for themselves
[10:07] but they'd live for him that died for
[10:09] all and died for them that live
[10:12] and rose again
[10:14] and it is in this uh phrase they which
[10:17] live should not henceforth live unto
[10:19] themselves but live unto him it brings
[10:22] you out of this uh this idea of being
[10:24] selfish and it
[10:27] it gets you thinking about not just
[10:29] living for yourself but living for
[10:30] Christ but I'm talking about living for
[10:33] others so I'll build the living for
[10:34] others uh living for Christ and how that
[10:37] becomes living for others but this
[10:38] living for others it over it's a way of
[10:41] overthrowing pride
[10:42] and it just takes kind of your pride and
[10:44] your selfish ambition or he just stifles
[10:47] that selfishness that we can have and I
[10:49] think that you know showing paying
[10:52] attention to the needs of others is a
[10:54] tremendous habit that you can build for
[10:56] yourself personally but it's a
[10:57] tremendous Habit to establish within a
[10:59] family Dynamic and it's a wonderful
[11:01] lesson that we can be teaching these
[11:02] young men and these young ladies on
[11:04] these first few rows that they begin to
[11:06] think Beyond themselves and think of
[11:07] ways that they can help others and it's
[11:09] this is what it means to not live unto
[11:12] yourself brother Bannerman the sermon
[11:14] faith and the Son of God he says so each
[11:16] day I want to live not for myself
[11:19] if I live for myself I have a selfish
[11:22] life I want to live for others and give
[11:26] what strength I have not to myself and
[11:28] to my own pleasure but for the benefit
[11:30] of others that'll build the kingdom of
[11:33] God
[11:34] think of how that phrasing is so
[11:36] beautiful I don't want to live for
[11:38] myself that's a selfish life I want to
[11:40] live for others and give what strength I
[11:42] have not to myself for my own pleasure
[11:44] but to the benefit of others that will
[11:46] build the kingdom of God
[11:48] and I believe even in the way that he
[11:50] phrases it that even if you're doing
[11:52] service to someone who's not part of the
[11:53] Kingdom or what may never be part of the
[11:56] Kingdom you're still building the
[11:57] kingdom
[11:58] if I live in a kind of life that's not
[12:00] selfish
[12:01] and even as we've been reading it on
[12:02] Sunday in Hebrews chapter 10 about uh
[12:05] let's assemble ourselves together and
[12:07] all the more as we see that day
[12:08] approaching we recognize in verse 24 it
[12:10] says let us consider one another to
[12:12] provoke unto love and to Good Works
[12:15] and so this if I could say this church
[12:17] is a type of the family family is not a
[12:19] type of the church church is type of the
[12:21] family and so Church actually uh
[12:24] patterns itself and it's typed after
[12:26] family Dynamics remember that in the
[12:29] beginning God didn't establish a church
[12:30] he created a family so that's the that's
[12:33] the image that God is in and the church
[12:35] is a mirror of that and Paul doesn't it
[12:37] doesn't describe uh the church
[12:40] um the marriage like the church but he's
[12:42] describing the church like a marriage
[12:43] and like the relationship between
[12:45] husband and wife and so the church being
[12:47] a type of a family if the church is
[12:49] called to assemble themselves around the
[12:52] word for the purpose of encouraging one
[12:54] another and provoking one another to
[12:56] love and good works the Fab the family
[12:58] gathers around the word in order to
[13:01] Foster love and Inspire acts of Love
[13:03] behind it
[13:04] that we are then as a family if this is
[13:07] what the church does as they gather
[13:08] around the word in order to provoke acts
[13:10] of service and that's what we ought to
[13:12] be doing as a family Paul says in first
[13:14] Thessalonians 5 11 wherefore Comfort
[13:16] yourselves together so if we are going
[13:18] to gather together as a church as a
[13:19] means of exhorting one another then this
[13:21] is something we do as a family we
[13:23] Comfort ourselves together and edify one
[13:25] another even as also ye do so we do this
[13:28] within the family we encourage one
[13:30] another but then by the from the source
[13:32] of that encouragement that we gather as
[13:33] a family unit then we want to have kind
[13:36] of an overflow and a strength as a
[13:38] family unit that can then serve other
[13:40] people
[13:41] that's the beautiful thing of building
[13:42] your family on the right foundation and
[13:44] feeding your experience and keeping
[13:46] keeping your hearts and Minds right and
[13:48] freeing yourself from a lot of things of
[13:50] the world that can bind our Spirits down
[13:52] and trap us or if I could say this
[13:55] there's many things that the devil can
[13:57] push us to do that make us feel
[13:59] alienated from The Fellowship of
[14:00] Christian brethren and it's not the ACT
[14:03] it's not the thing you've done that the
[14:05] devil's trying to accomplish it's the
[14:07] alienation from Christ and the Christian
[14:09] Fellowship like that's the goal so
[14:11] there's a victory that you can have that
[14:13] whenever you've made a mistake you've
[14:14] been out of church for a while you've
[14:15] done something it makes you feel less
[14:17] deserving of Fellowship it makes you not
[14:19] feel a part make that diligent effort to
[14:22] re-engage and reconnect and find
[14:24] yourself in fellowship and get around
[14:25] the right things even I encourage the
[14:26] young people uh if sin is dragging you
[14:29] down and thoughts are weighing heavy on
[14:31] your heart don't get distant from your
[14:32] parents fight to get back into
[14:34] fellowship with them spend time together
[14:35] with the family don't let it alienate
[14:37] you from fellowship young people get out
[14:39] of that practice and they feel backslid
[14:41] and there's you know get around the
[14:43] right kind of fellowship and that's the
[14:44] victory
[14:46] and the devil has no victory in causing
[14:48] you to make a mistake his Victors to try
[14:50] to get you out from among the flock away
[14:51] from the comfort away from the
[14:53] edification away from the encouragement
[14:55] so if you just say I know I made a
[14:56] mistake God forgive me and you make that
[14:58] effort to reconnect with the things of
[15:00] God there's the Victory and the devil's
[15:01] like ah
[15:03] I thought I had him
[15:04] and he can't even Point scoreboard
[15:06] because whatever that was God's used
[15:08] amen right for your benefit for his
[15:11] glory
[15:12] and so this these disciplines that we
[15:14] have as a family I know there's maybe a
[15:15] lot of layers that we're building down
[15:17] but when a family can have this and let
[15:20] me reconnect it then if we can be in
[15:22] this habit as a family of encouraging
[15:23] one another then it's going to be so
[15:25] much easier to reach Beyond yourself and
[15:27] comfort and edify and help somebody else
[15:30] and strengthen somebody else
[15:32] so if I could
[15:38] for them which live
[15:41] feeding it from second Corinthians 5 15
[15:42] living unto him which died for them
[15:44] which live
[15:46] it necessitates because it says we ought
[15:48] to live for him which died for us it
[15:49] necessitates a life of service to others
[15:52] not just the life well I'm just trying
[15:54] to serve Christ and I'm just trying to
[15:55] serve Christ but there's no
[15:57] self-sacrifice there's no unselfishness
[15:59] there's no service to others there's no
[16:00] reaching out Beyond yourself I would
[16:02] even say that we cannot be a Christian
[16:05] church and always just internalizing
[16:07] focusing on our own and only worried
[16:09] about who's here and only worried about
[16:11] what takes between these four walls we
[16:13] ought to have a mind to what takes place
[16:15] in our community within our
[16:16] neighborhoods and with our extended
[16:17] families and and the body of Christ
[16:19] around the world that's what makes us a
[16:21] genuine Christian Church not when we
[16:23] become cultish
[16:25] all right there's some message churches
[16:26] that have closed the doors anyone that
[16:29] doesn't believe the same way they do and
[16:31] they're only after satellite churches to
[16:33] build a following after their leader or
[16:35] their you know their their cult leader
[16:37] their eighth messenger and they don't
[16:39] have a burden for lost souls some even
[16:40] teach them that the door of Salvation
[16:41] was shut in 1963 and so they don't have
[16:44] a heart to for the for the lost and the
[16:46] burden to evangelize and a burden to see
[16:48] Soul saved and we ought not to be that
[16:50] kind of church we ought to have a mind
[16:52] for those that we come in contact with
[16:54] the heart for our co-workers our
[16:55] extended family
[16:57] and to live a life that is ministering
[17:00] and an encouragement to other people
[17:04] John Bunyan said not Paul Bunyan but
[17:06] John Bunyan said you have not lived
[17:08] today
[17:09] until you've done something for someone
[17:11] who can never repay you
[17:13] right that's
[17:14] that's a lot to think about we could
[17:16] probably have a breakout session on this
[17:18] you have not lived today I mean then
[17:21] maybe you almost feel like well I ain't
[17:22] started Living yet John you have not
[17:25] lived today until you've done something
[17:27] for someone who can never repay you
[17:29] I mean that's that's an unselfish act
[17:32] whether you're not expecting anything in
[17:33] return and as a matter of fact there's
[17:35] no expectation that they may do anything
[17:37] in return you're not doing it because
[17:39] you will get something out of it that's
[17:41] a selfless act and he says you haven't
[17:43] lived until you've done that and I
[17:45] believe that's the idea that brother
[17:46] Adam's pointing to that I want to live
[17:47] for others and and we ought not to live
[17:50] unto ourselves as Jesus as Paul is
[17:52] saying
[17:53] now in Revelation the sermon Revelations
[17:55] chapter 5 part one this is when brother
[17:56] Brown was preaching
[17:58] the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[18:00] then becomes the the kind of the the
[18:02] form for the church age book listen to
[18:05] this conversation he's having with Dr
[18:06] Sam Adair he says a few days ago I was
[18:09] sitting talking to my loyal little
[18:10] friend here in the city of medical
[18:11] doctor Sam Adair and he said how are you
[18:13] doing bill and I said oh pretty fair I
[18:15] suppose doc I said yourself and he said
[18:18] oh a lot of patience patience is in you
[18:21] know medical patients he said I've had
[18:23] 15 examinations this afternoon I said
[18:25] well that's good as long as it's just
[18:26] examinations and finding nothing wrong I
[18:29] said you know and he says we got to
[18:30] talking about back when we were boys and
[18:32] I said well doc I don't know just how
[18:34] long I'm going to be around
[18:36] we're both in our 50s
[18:38] is that when you start having that
[18:39] thought oh boy
[18:42] and he said that's true bill and I said
[18:44] but all these years about 31 years of
[18:46] ministry now I've kept my heart prepared
[18:48] for that hour when he comes so it
[18:50] doesn't matter when he comes so he said
[18:52] that is true
[18:54] I said the greatest thrill I have is
[18:57] living for others and he said that's
[19:00] what life is makes life real it's not
[19:03] what you can do or accomplish for
[19:04] yourself but what you can do for others
[19:06] brother random affirms this seed that's
[19:08] when you're really living
[19:10] this is the idea conveyed by John Bunyan
[19:12] that's when you're really living if
[19:14] there happens to be someone Among Us
[19:15] who's never did that try to live for
[19:18] somebody else give that a try this is
[19:20] what I'd like to say to us as a church
[19:22] to all of our families and individuals
[19:23] here everyone here who's listening to
[19:25] this let's give this a try watch what he
[19:28] says let's just see how much more life
[19:30] holds for you when you'll not live for
[19:33] what you can get yourself out of life
[19:35] but what you can give someone else in
[19:37] life
[19:38] complete Paradigm Shift of of the layout
[19:42] mentality of get rich or die trying
[19:44] right and that's the attitude that this
[19:46] world has and this is kind of I'm going
[19:48] to get mine I'm going to fake it till I
[19:49] make it there's got to be some a
[19:51] Prestige that comes from it something
[19:52] that I can acculate a badge something I
[19:54] can wear but he says and even nowadays
[19:56] there's so many acts of service that are
[19:58] actually done for the views
[20:01] and not for the real service it's done
[20:03] as it may be a means of income for
[20:05] themselves and as a means of getting
[20:06] attention so let's not do it for the
[20:08] views right so he says does this see how
[20:11] much you can get out of life when you
[20:12] can give someone else in what you can
[20:14] give someone else in life and you'll
[20:16] find that it's more blessed than riches
[20:18] or anything that can be thought of
[20:20] what is the the act of doing something
[20:23] for somebody else
[20:25] it's what you can do for someone else
[20:27] that makes life's burdens which life in
[20:29] itself is a burden and everyone said
[20:31] amen
[20:32] and it'll make it a little lighter for
[20:35] somebody else
[20:36] and you just don't know the joy unless
[20:38] you've tried it once to do something for
[20:41] someone else
[20:42] I hope this can inspire you for all of
[20:44] us we can be inspired by this to think
[20:46] how can I serve other people what is it
[20:49] I can do and we don't all and I say I
[20:52] say we don't all I would say that the
[20:54] you know the first thing you should not
[20:56] be thinking about is money
[20:57] right well who can I give money to can I
[21:01] make balance this Ledger here no it's
[21:03] something even beyond that what you can
[21:05] add what you can lend what you can do
[21:07] for someone else and Romans chapter 15
[21:09] verses 1 to 3 it says we then that are
[21:12] strong ought to Bear the infirmities of
[21:15] the weak and not to please ourselves
[21:18] this is something that we we should take
[21:20] consideration of and then I think it
[21:21] gives some comfort to those of us who
[21:23] may be wounded or we may be hurting we
[21:25] may not feel that we're at our spiritual
[21:27] best I mean what a comfort in knowing
[21:29] that there's others around us who are
[21:30] strong who are willing to Bear the
[21:31] infirmities of those of us who are weak
[21:33] and wounded and trying to find our way
[21:35] back or get our feet back underneath us
[21:37] but if we are strong and we feel
[21:39] confident in our relationship with God
[21:41] and we feel that we're going in the
[21:42] right direction this is kind of the next
[21:44] level in terms of the way we think and
[21:46] we live our lives as we don't please
[21:48] ourselves verse two that every one of us
[21:50] please his neighbor for his good to
[21:52] edification
[21:54] for our own good and for our own
[21:56] edification
[21:57] brother uh Stephen Bryant told me one
[22:00] time that when he testifies he says it's
[22:01] like watering yourself when you're
[22:04] saying something doing something good
[22:05] and testifying and speaking of the good
[22:07] things of God it has a way of Watering
[22:08] your own experience in your own
[22:09] testimony and thrilling you a little bit
[22:11] he says let every one of us uh please
[22:13] his neighbor for his good edification so
[22:16] that moderates what you're doing for
[22:18] your neighbor right things that edify
[22:21] things that are for his good and you say
[22:22] well I just thought what I would do is
[22:25] um you know throw a keg party for him or
[22:27] whatever and five dollars a cup he's
[22:28] like well that's probably not to his
[22:29] good and for his edification
[22:31] and says for even Christ please not
[22:33] himself
[22:35] but as it is written the reproaches of
[22:37] them that reproached thee fell on me
[22:41] notice how Christ plays not himself this
[22:43] is how we Circle back around to they
[22:45] that live live not henceforth live not
[22:48] unto themselves but unto him
[22:51] into his image and and for him and for
[22:53] his purpose and so I could say just as
[22:55] brother Branham said if you ever want to
[22:56] do anything for me do something for my
[22:58] children
[22:59] then this is the attitude of Christ if
[23:01] you want to do something for me you want
[23:02] to serve me you want to give vent to
[23:04] your your inspiration and you want to
[23:06] give vent to your Revelation uh all the
[23:09] Adoration and praise you want to pour
[23:10] out on me that's fine he's saying to
[23:12] Christ saying he says but now you be
[23:14] Christ to somebody else why my hands are
[23:16] absent from this Earth you be my hands
[23:18] while my feet have yet not come back in
[23:21] that Millennial coming back under the
[23:22] feet on the earth you be my feet you be
[23:24] my hands you beat my eyes you be myself
[23:26] extended so he is as Christ pleased on
[23:29] himself then we ought to Bear the
[23:31] infirmities of others and not just
[23:33] please ourselves and we ought to do good
[23:35] unto our neighbors for their good to
[23:37] edification
[23:39] and I believe this makes an excellent
[23:41] family goal
[23:43] to find opportunities to serve others
[23:45] to find ways to be a blessing to others
[23:47] and I would even welcome the
[23:49] conversation
[23:51] with any heads of household or any young
[23:53] people or anyone that would say brother
[23:54] Aaron I want to know what I can do for
[23:55] God I want to know if there's more I can
[23:57] do I want to serve others I would
[23:58] welcome the conversation to explore the
[24:01] opportunities that can be made available
[24:03] to you to live for other people
[24:06] in Philippians chapter 2 verses 3 to 8
[24:10] Paul says let nothing be done through
[24:12] Strife or vainglory that has relates a
[24:14] lot to politicking vanity selfishness
[24:16] party making trying to gain followers
[24:19] but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem
[24:22] other better than themselves it's so
[24:24] easy to for it to roll off the tongue
[24:26] but there's something about it that just
[24:28] kind of hits the center of a lot of
[24:30] issues where you think about yourself
[24:32] more than you think of others you think
[24:34] better of yourselves and you think of
[24:35] other people and you you're quick to
[24:37] give yourself the benefit of the doubt
[24:38] but not to other people it says you
[24:40] should esteem other better than
[24:42] yourselves look not every man on his own
[24:44] things but every man also on the things
[24:46] of others in no way is he espousing that
[24:49] we ought to forsake our own
[24:50] responsibilities and obligations but
[24:52] it's a lack of selfishness that we who
[24:54] are strong begin to think of ways that
[24:56] we can support and help the weak and
[24:58] those that have can find ways to give
[25:00] though to those that have not even as
[25:01] we've read in the scripture that during
[25:03] that time of feasting and celebration
[25:05] those who gathered their things together
[25:06] and feasted they're also to give an
[25:08] offering to those who did not have who
[25:11] could not Harvest who couldn't bring
[25:12] Things To The Feast
[25:15] there's a provision even made in the
[25:16] Feast of the Passover that a family for
[25:18] a lamb and that if one family had a lamb
[25:20] and another one wasn't big enough to
[25:21] have a lamb or it was too much for one
[25:23] left that they came together and they
[25:24] shared provision
[25:26] an image you see even in the beginning
[25:28] in the the Church of the the book of
[25:30] Acts that there was a given and there
[25:32] was a service and there was a common
[25:34] ground that they all had so let every
[25:35] man not just look on his own things but
[25:38] also the things of others let this mind
[25:40] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[25:42] this is why I Circle back to living unto
[25:45] him they that live will live unto him we
[25:47] have to live unselfishly we have to have
[25:49] this mind of Christ who've been in the
[25:51] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[25:53] equal with God
[25:55] that also means not that not there was
[25:58] no illegality to it it was not contrary
[26:01] to the law it was not wrong the equality
[26:03] is not wrong but also it wasn't
[26:05] something easily grasped
[26:07] God likeness isn't just something easy
[26:10] if we think we're just going to be
[26:11] perfect and going to be in His image
[26:12] gonna be the full word born into
[26:14] manifestation again and there's not
[26:15] going to be some birth pains they're not
[26:17] going to be struggle for life there's
[26:18] not going to be pressure it's going to
[26:19] be overcoming no it's going to be a hard
[26:21] thing something not stolen or easily
[26:23] grasped
[26:24] but made himself of no reputation took
[26:27] upon him the form of a servant
[26:31] and was made in the likeness of men
[26:34] and being found in a fashion as a man
[26:37] he humbled himself and became obedient
[26:39] unto death even the death of the Cross
[26:42] if we have time tonight we'll come into
[26:44] the image of the Rich Young Ruler who
[26:45] was asked to take up the cross
[26:47] and so we have this scripture I think
[26:50] that's just so plain doesn't necessarily
[26:52] need a lot of definitions and a lot of
[26:54] different translations for us to get
[26:55] this that we ought to if we're going to
[26:58] become come into the image of Christ the
[27:00] image of Christ is the form of a servant
[27:02] it must be in that image the image of a
[27:04] servant not one who is seeking to be
[27:06] served but one that is seeking to serve
[27:09] that's our attitude as Christians not
[27:11] what can Christ do for me but what can I
[27:13] now do for Christ if I can do all things
[27:16] through Christ which gives me strength
[27:17] then what can I do for Christ if he is
[27:20] my sufficiency what is it that I can now
[27:22] do for him and to build the kingdom of
[27:24] God and do things the right way
[27:27] in the sermon at Thy word brother
[27:28] Branham says a person who lives their
[27:30] life for themselves
[27:32] for their self lives a selfish life we
[27:36] must live for others bear ye one
[27:38] another's burdens and so fulfill the law
[27:40] of Christ I believe it's coming from
[27:42] Galatians just think of that how
[27:44] beautiful that is bear you one another's
[27:46] burdens and what is what does it say in
[27:47] Galatians that every man ought to bear
[27:49] his own burden right so we all have our
[27:52] own burden that we ought to care we
[27:54] recognize this one went through this and
[27:55] one uh sometime over the last couple
[27:57] years where that scripture the word
[28:00] burden there is that what you were Laden
[28:02] with that you are made to carry as a
[28:05] ship Laden with goods and it's tasked
[28:06] with carrying goods across the across
[28:08] the pond
[28:09] um that's its job and so it's Laden down
[28:11] it's built for it the whole is built a
[28:13] certain way it can it has ballast and
[28:15] things to balance it and it's it's made
[28:16] to carry that load and you ought to Bear
[28:19] the load you were made to carry but then
[28:22] it says that we also are to Bear one
[28:24] another's burdens and that burden there
[28:25] is a complete different word and it
[28:27] means something else that's dragging
[28:29] somebody down
[28:30] and so we have to then be in a position
[28:33] to recognize that someone needs a little
[28:35] bit of support somebody needs a little
[28:36] bit of help and then we can therefore
[28:38] fulfill the law
[28:40] by burying one another's burdens and he
[28:42] says and we've got to have a feeling for
[28:44] one another
[28:46] and if that's what it is for some of us
[28:47] that we just simply don't feel it maybe
[28:49] we can ask God to give us the burden
[28:51] I believe I've shared this story before
[28:53] I ran into a situation one time where I
[28:55] was talking to somebody and I mentioned
[28:56] to them they had this opportunity it was
[28:58] it was just they were made for it they
[29:00] had everything to do for it I said man
[29:01] you're in a tremendous opportunity and
[29:03] position to do this for that church and
[29:05] they said yeah I don't have a burden for
[29:06] it
[29:07] and and immediately my thinking was no
[29:09] this isn't a situation where you have to
[29:10] get a burden this is where you pick one
[29:12] up
[29:13] this is where you take the initiative
[29:15] and you say I don't feel burdened to do
[29:17] it but I see the need so I'll take it
[29:20] and I'll begin to exercise my exercise
[29:22] myself in it and I'll take it on myself
[29:25] to carry this burden and so if some of
[29:27] you have all the resources and energy
[29:30] and opportunity to do something for
[29:32] somebody or even for this church and
[29:34] you're just waiting to have the burden
[29:38] pick it up right just take it take it on
[29:42] he says and therefore when you do all
[29:45] you know to how to do then when you do
[29:47] lay down at night well you have the
[29:48] consolation knowing that you tried your
[29:50] best
[29:51] that's just even help you go to sleep
[29:54] these are some of the best this is the
[29:55] best melatonin you could pay for it says
[29:58] pure grade no side effect melatonin
[30:02] you'll be able to go to bed at night
[30:04] laying down knowing you tried your best
[30:05] and I can't make everyone else believe I
[30:07] can't make everyone believe that's
[30:09] impossible I think this phrase is just
[30:11] so gorgeous so beautiful Jesus couldn't
[30:12] do that when he was on Earth and I know
[30:14] there'll just be a few that believes but
[30:16] if anything I can add to help the gospel
[30:18] that's my duty of being here is to try
[30:21] to help somebody along the way
[30:23] did you catch that
[30:24] even if they don't believe
[30:27] it's it's not even contingent upon well
[30:29] we'll just give them the word test we'll
[30:31] see whether they're elected or not right
[30:34] I remember one time I there was a
[30:35] minister who came over from overseas
[30:37] he's from India and after I shared this
[30:39] story with one Pastor he said brother I
[30:41] never met a preacher from India has head
[30:43] on Square uh head on straight but um and
[30:46] I guess he just ran into some of the nut
[30:47] jobs like I did that one night when no
[30:49] matter what I said about the message
[30:50] this guy believed it and already saw it
[30:52] and I was like I could probably say
[30:54] anything right now he's like hey man
[30:55] that's right that's right baptize the
[30:57] name William Branham because they're
[30:59] just and at that point I said you know
[31:01] what why don't you get out of my car
[31:02] right
[31:03] but I still took him home and fed him
[31:05] and and we were nice to him even though
[31:06] we realized he was just looking for any
[31:08] church whatever Church would feed him
[31:10] that night and that ought to be our
[31:12] heart I'm not doing this only for uh
[31:15] Believers or see things the same way I
[31:16] do I know that there's nothing wasted if
[31:18] I'm doing it under the one whom I know
[31:20] my reward comes from and I'm doing it
[31:23] just as Christ laid down his life for
[31:24] all he died for all that they which live
[31:27] could then do the same thing he did pay
[31:29] the price for all so it says if I'll do
[31:31] anything it's my duty to help try to
[31:33] somebody along the way even if they
[31:35] won't believe because it's not his job
[31:37] to make them believers but it's our job
[31:40] to treat them with respect and decency
[31:41] and it's our job to be to do service to
[31:43] others
[31:44] Galatians chapter 6 verses 8 9 and 10.
[31:48] for he that soweth to his flesh shall of
[31:50] his flesh reap corruption
[31:52] but he that soweth to the spirit shall
[31:53] of the spirit reap life Everlasting what
[31:56] is that eternal life
[31:58] is is implied in that but abundant reap
[32:00] life Everlasting is Abundant Living you
[32:03] know this is a life of abundance of Life
[32:04] of fulfillment like it's what brother
[32:06] Brown was talking about I believe it
[32:07] says when you lay your head down at
[32:08] night you have a consolation of knowing
[32:09] you did your best
[32:12] there's uh there's some of us there's
[32:14] people who have maybe just uh a real
[32:17] Consciousness do they they couldn't live
[32:19] with themselves if they cheated somebody
[32:21] they couldn't live with themselves if
[32:23] they if they lied if they stole it they
[32:25] took a disadvantage of somebody and it's
[32:27] something that haunts them and they they
[32:28] say well I I wouldn't do that just so I
[32:30] can go to bed at night just so I can
[32:31] sleep at night is that not the phrase
[32:32] you know I do it just so I I wouldn't do
[32:34] that because I want to be able to go to
[32:36] sleep at night but now this is the it
[32:38] the the further extension of that when
[32:40] you serve others the consolation it
[32:42] brings
[32:43] the Abundant Living so now with this
[32:46] life Everlasting now kind of brought
[32:49] into our view he says and let us not be
[32:50] weary in well doing
[32:52] for in due season we shall reap if we
[32:54] faint not I think we've used that here
[32:55] recently
[32:57] about this is you know be not weary when
[32:59] doing right when doing the will of God
[33:00] doing the right thing
[33:02] we should not be weary it really is the
[33:05] the the fuse that we need the the
[33:07] endless views we need in this war of
[33:09] attrition and constantly denying the
[33:11] world and constantly saying no to the
[33:12] devil we need Christ in there in the way
[33:15] keeping us from being weary and well
[33:17] doing so that we don't have that Fallout
[33:18] it says for in due season we shall reap
[33:20] if we faint not
[33:21] as we have therefore opportunity now
[33:24] this is kind of the logical progression
[33:26] of sowing to the spirit and reaping life
[33:29] Everlasting and being not weird and well
[33:30] doing as we therefore have opportunity
[33:32] we have therefore opportunity let us do
[33:34] good unto all men
[33:36] as you have opportunity let us do good
[33:39] unto all men especially unto them who
[33:41] are of the household of faith
[33:42] this is this is what I am thinking of
[33:45] when I say live for others is doing good
[33:47] unto all men especially them who are of
[33:50] the household of faith so there ought to
[33:51] be a special service there ought to be a
[33:53] special attention there ought to be a
[33:55] caring for our own and looking after the
[33:57] needs of those that are amongst us and
[33:58] those who are part of our body I believe
[34:00] that we have that Duty first it would be
[34:02] the idea of uh at Jerusalem first or
[34:05] charity begins at home that's that idea
[34:07] of looking after the needs of the those
[34:09] that are within our orbit within our
[34:11] lives within our reach but then if we
[34:12] have that practice and that habit of
[34:15] within our own family and then looking
[34:16] after the needs of the church and how we
[34:18] can help others and make others feel
[34:20] apart and be mindful of the things that
[34:22] make life difficult for them there's
[34:24] families that drive distances to come to
[34:26] church and then we have a youth meeting
[34:28] in the afternoon and they might find
[34:29] themselves orphaned while their kids are
[34:31] at a youth meeting and eating some of
[34:33] the best food and having some of the
[34:34] best conversations I'm telling you
[34:35] adults are missing out
[34:37] but there's uh there's maybe a way where
[34:40] if you could begin to think Beyond
[34:42] yourself you're like oh well you know
[34:43] what we're local we're not too far away
[34:44] from the church uh maybe we could have
[34:47] this family over why they're Children of
[34:48] the youth mean there's ways that we can
[34:50] begin to think Beyond ourselves or how
[34:52] can we help what can we do this is how
[34:54] we can live for others
[34:57] can we get an amen for those who don't
[34:58] live in Maricopa Valley
[35:01] it's something to think about
[35:03] and this to me establishes establishes
[35:07] that eternal life is living for others
[35:09] he says you sow to your the spirit if
[35:11] you sow to the flesh you're going to
[35:12] reap corruption that's that's not living
[35:15] but that's the most important thing is
[35:17] life that's not really living John
[35:18] Bunyan said you haven't lived today
[35:20] unless you've done something for someone
[35:22] who can never repay you so living is
[35:25] serving others right if we can get that
[35:28] idea and Paul is saying that if you sow
[35:29] to the spirit you're going to reap a
[35:31] living real living life Abundant Life
[35:33] and so he says therefore as you have
[35:35] have opportunity do good unto all men he
[35:38] establishes I believe clearly that
[35:40] eternal life is living for others
[35:43] Abundant Living is living for others and
[35:46] that's exactly what brother Branham
[35:47] taught us in that sermon that day on
[35:48] Calvary
[35:50] he says but don't look to what you've
[35:52] done
[35:53] look what they that look what that day
[35:55] on Calvary did to you
[35:59] it paid your price
[36:00] it settled the question
[36:03] your sins be a Scarlet they're white as
[36:05] snow
[36:06] red like Crimson white like wool then
[36:08] you have no sin you're perfectly sinless
[36:12] no matter what you've done or what you
[36:13] do you're still sinless praise the Lord
[36:16] can we just say praise the Lord
[36:18] thank you thank you Lord for
[36:20] justification
[36:22] now but is that what does that create
[36:24] inside of us now this idea of like
[36:27] what did you say sinless no matter what
[36:29] I do say it doesn't create this
[36:31] selfishness right so it says he says as
[36:35] long as you've accepted Christ Jesus
[36:36] Christ is your savior sins are forgiven
[36:38] anything that's forgiven is remitted and
[36:40] forgot about then what does it do
[36:43] it gives you after that condition
[36:45] he says uh
[36:47] as as long as you've accepted you Christ
[36:48] your savior your sins are forgive
[36:49] anything that's forgiven is remitted and
[36:51] forgot about then what does it do it
[36:54] gives you after that condition his
[36:57] Spirit to follow him and to do as he did
[37:00] for others who is following for you
[37:06] now
[37:07] I mean I feel like I'm just live for
[37:09] others who is falling on sorry yeah
[37:12] gives you his Spirit to follow him and
[37:13] to do as he did for others who is
[37:15] following on he was just one man the
[37:18] perfect man he gave his life and he made
[37:22] an example for you
[37:24] now what must we do
[37:28] this is a a beautiful thought Justified
[37:31] sinless no matter what you've done no
[37:33] matter what you do there's this
[37:34] representation that purges you and gives
[37:37] you this representation that you're
[37:38] clean that you are forgiven that you're
[37:40] Justified now what does it do it doesn't
[37:43] give us a get out of jail card whenever
[37:45] we do something wrong it gives us the
[37:47] spirit to follow him
[37:49] and then he being the perfect man gave
[37:51] his life and made an example for you
[37:53] then what's the example now what we
[37:55] might now what should we do now the
[37:57] first thing I want to say is Jesus never
[38:00] lived for himself his life was spent for
[38:03] others
[38:04] that is perfectly eternal life
[38:07] when you say you go to church and you do
[38:09] good things that's fine
[38:11] but when you live your life to yourself
[38:13] you haven't
[38:15] eternal life
[38:17] eternal life is living for others
[38:21] remember how you said hey if you haven't
[38:22] tried this yet you should try it
[38:24] so let me put it in this way if you have
[38:26] been Justified but you still are selfish
[38:29] and haven't lived for others then you
[38:31] don't even know what you have yet
[38:33] because you haven't begun to walk in the
[38:35] eternal life that you've inherited you
[38:37] haven't begun to walk in in the the
[38:40] power and the life and the overcoming
[38:42] and the Victory of what you've been
[38:44] forgiven until you begin to live for
[38:46] others
[38:48] he says eternal life is living for
[38:50] others it proved it when it come to the
[38:52] Lamb of God he lived and had eternal
[38:54] life because he did not live for himself
[38:56] he lived for others and you receive
[38:58] eternal life by receiving that day and
[39:01] you don't live for yourself no more you
[39:03] live for others
[39:05] is that very familiar with to you I know
[39:08] we've heard this many many times before
[39:09] as a matter of fact I believe this is
[39:11] one of those sermons where just about
[39:12] every scripture and every quote I read
[39:14] tonight I know I've already read over
[39:15] this pulpit
[39:16] here as since we've been passionate at
[39:18] this church because these are things
[39:19] that are familiar to us things that we
[39:21] ought to be reminded of in this way it's
[39:23] the year in review but now so a year in
[39:26] preview these are things I want to
[39:27] always and consistently on some regular
[39:29] basis reinforce that we live for others
[39:33] and the the all even all six of these
[39:35] principles are things that I never want
[39:36] to be far from our thoughts
[39:38] as a church and so he says and you don't
[39:41] live for yourself no more you live for
[39:43] others this is the reflection of Christ
[39:45] this is the the heart of true
[39:48] Christianity and true eternal life even
[39:49] the true religion
[39:52] is expressed and visiting the fatherless
[39:55] and the widows and and keeping yourself
[39:56] unspotted from the world this is this is
[39:59] what Christianity is
[40:00] then he says someone said how can you
[40:02] stand and let anyone call you such bad
[40:04] names you don't live for yourself
[40:07] I I kind of the way he all of a sudden
[40:09] interjects that he says you live for
[40:11] yourself and this is how you do he says
[40:13] but how could you do it for someone who
[40:14] calls you bad names how is it then you
[40:16] have the right response when people
[40:18] mistreat you because you're in the habit
[40:19] of living for others
[40:21] you're not in habit of self-protection
[40:23] you're not in the habit of
[40:24] self-justification you're not in the
[40:26] habit of self-defense right I'm in the
[40:28] habit of living for others when someone
[40:30] says something bad about you your your
[40:31] knee-jerk reaction is it to preserve
[40:33] yourself
[40:34] you already are walking free in your own
[40:36] justification so your knee you need your
[40:38] creation isn't to justify yourself
[40:40] so beautiful how he puts this you don't
[40:42] live for yourself you live for others
[40:44] that you might redeem that man
[40:46] you know what Manny's talking about the
[40:49] one that calls you such bad names that's
[40:51] the one he's talking about you become
[40:53] sons and the trouble of it is that the
[40:56] church has forgot they were Sons
[40:58] we've forgotten that we're children of
[41:00] Christ that we are children of God he
[41:01] says you are Sons you are taking
[41:03] Christ's place you are Sons
[41:06] so don't live for yourself live for
[41:08] others
[41:09] kind of a wake-up call isn't it I'm a
[41:12] Christian I'm a Child of God so that I'm
[41:14] not living for myself and I know this is
[41:16] going to sound strange I'm not just
[41:18] living for God
[41:20] I'm not just to praise him and just to
[41:22] exalt him and lift him up and write
[41:24] beautiful songs and have awesome worship
[41:26] services and all my praises to Him and
[41:29] all my adoration to him and then have a
[41:31] life void of a heart for people
[41:33] and then be selfish and stingy and rude
[41:35] and mean and cold-hearted and and fight
[41:38] like a bus song all these other things
[41:40] that sometimes are brought into the the
[41:41] vernacular we use when we're talking
[41:43] about our response to others he's saying
[41:44] No this is the first and foremost
[41:47] if I could say our first praise to God
[41:50] is how we treat other people
[41:53] says you're taking Christ's place your
[41:55] son so don't live for yourself live for
[41:56] others will brother Branham I can live
[41:59] for this brother because he sure is a
[42:01] nice man
[42:02] that's not it
[42:05] Live Well I think wait so he says
[42:09] that's not it live for that man who
[42:11] hates you
[42:14] do we have a lot of people to live for
[42:16] live for that person who would kill you
[42:19] if they could
[42:22] hmm
[42:25] what year did he say this
[42:29] how come they how come they found this
[42:31] reel to real
[42:33] hey
[42:35] we need to check the authenticity of
[42:36] this is this a deep fake you know the
[42:39] message
[42:40] but this is exactly this is it live for
[42:42] the man that hates you live for that
[42:44] person who would kill you if they could
[42:47] now let's just be real
[42:49] that ain't easy
[42:51] I don't even know what that looks like
[42:52] right
[42:54] I mean how could I live for the guy that
[42:55] would kill me if they had the
[42:56] opportunity
[42:58] that's what they've done to him they
[43:00] killed him and he died that he might
[43:02] save them
[43:03] that's eternal life when that's in your
[43:06] bosom you're facing heaven then
[43:09] we haven't even done an about face to
[43:12] Heaven until we can live for other
[43:14] people we're not even facing Heaven
[43:16] properly and fully until we can live for
[43:18] others who would even do wrong to us
[43:21] just taking the words of the message of
[43:23] the hour I'm reminded of the scriptures
[43:24] doing good unto those that would use you
[43:26] and despise you and do hateful and mean
[43:28] things to you that there's a good that
[43:30] we ought to do to all men there's an
[43:32] Integrity that a Believer has
[43:34] that is greater than the Integrity of
[43:36] the world because this world has its
[43:37] limits and they have their they have
[43:40] their freedoms and they have their Bill
[43:41] of Rights and they have their extensions
[43:43] of certain uh Liberties that we afford
[43:46] other people until it crosses a
[43:48] particular line but even as Christians
[43:50] we don't even have the same barriers
[43:52] that a lot of people in the world have
[43:54] that oh I'll be your friend until you
[43:55] cross me I'll be good to you till you
[43:57] cross me and then I've got to get mine I
[43:59] got to protect mine there's a
[44:01] selflessness of a Believer and again if
[44:03] you need to refer back to the series on
[44:04] berries and boundaries to not let this
[44:06] be taken to the the devil's extreme but
[44:08] there's a selflessness that a Believer
[44:10] has to where if you can't do something
[44:12] for them you're even willing to pray for
[44:14] the one that would kill you
[44:17] and that's us maybe those most simple
[44:19] way you can live for others
[44:22] he says when that's in your bosom your
[44:24] face in heaven then but you sacrifice
[44:26] your own things give them up like shape
[44:28] gives its wool you look on towards
[44:30] Calvary
[44:32] why because eternal life this life that
[44:34] I have inside of me is made to not live
[44:36] unto myself
[44:37] not even made to serve my own purpose
[44:39] but there's a self-sacrificing that's
[44:41] done to to fulfill the will of God if
[44:44] they lay that enters the caveat to
[44:46] fulfill the will of God that there's
[44:48] there's an unction inside of me that'll
[44:50] act in the in the face of hatred in the
[44:53] face of a murderous intent in the face
[44:54] of those who do wrong to me there's an
[44:56] unction inside of me called eternal life
[44:58] that is willing to live and to be
[45:00] self-sacrificial and to not respond in
[45:02] kind
[45:04] in order to be christ-like
[45:08] in Galatians chapter 5 verses 13 and 14.
[45:12] this is backing up from where we were in
[45:13] Galatians chapter six for Brethren you
[45:15] have been called unto Liberty
[45:17] only used not Liberty for an occasion to
[45:19] the flesh but by love serve one another
[45:24] it's just it's beautifully written it's
[45:25] plain it's in the scripture
[45:28] that this Liberty we have in Christ the
[45:30] sinlessness this anchor of our souls to
[45:33] know that our Salvation is permanent and
[45:35] cannot be taken away from us is not an
[45:37] occasion then to just continue to
[45:39] gratify the flesh without the fear of
[45:41] Eternal punishment
[45:43] but it's to give us freedom to love
[45:45] one another through service
[45:48] for all the laws fulfilled in one word
[45:50] even this
[45:52] Thou shalt love
[45:54] thy neighbor as thyself
[45:58] that's what Christ was teaching us
[46:00] all along the prophets hang on this and
[46:02] Paul is saying all the law is fulfilled
[46:04] in one word even this all the law is
[46:06] fulfilled and thou shalt love thy
[46:08] neighbor as thyself
[46:10] loving thy neighbor as thyself is living
[46:12] for others living for the neighbor
[46:13] giving yourself to to in in service to
[46:17] someone else living for somebody else
[46:19] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[46:23] the text that we read in the beginning
[46:24] Luke chapter 10 if you recall the lawyer
[46:27] introduces the subject of what can I do
[46:29] to inherit eternal life
[46:31] and so Jesus says well
[46:33] you've asked a good question I guess you
[46:34] could say you know Jesus saying well you
[46:37] know what do you think what's written in
[46:38] the law how great is thou in other words
[46:40] what's required of the law
[46:43] and he recites this Thou shalt love the
[46:45] Lord thy God with all thy heart and with
[46:47] all thy soul with all thy strength and
[46:48] with all thy mind and love thy neighbor
[46:50] as thyself
[46:51] and Jesus says you got it
[46:54] do this and live because what does it
[46:57] really take to do that it takes you have
[46:59] to have eternal life to do this
[47:01] he says do that now shall live Thou
[47:03] shalt have eternal life this is life
[47:04] this is the what eternal life is eternal
[47:06] life is living for others what can I do
[47:07] to have eternal life well I'll tell you
[47:09] live for others it is it
[47:12] something selfless about it and so the
[47:14] lawyers retort this well who's my
[47:17] neighbor
[47:18] now who do I have to be good to
[47:20] how far does this go and Jesus uses the
[47:23] story of the Good Samaritan
[47:25] to provoke the thought
[47:27] within the lawyer's mind that it's not
[47:30] just the believer it's not just the one
[47:31] that sees the seventh seal just like you
[47:33] or it's not just those of your own
[47:34] household and their own blood
[47:36] but your neighbor
[47:38] being neighborly is showing Mercy
[47:42] and it's actually such a beautiful
[47:44] thought the way Jesus challenges so many
[47:46] different things and uses these
[47:47] characters in this Parable to bring Rey
[47:49] so many questions and bring so much into
[47:51] our view but when you ask them you know
[47:53] who do you think is the neighbor to this
[47:55] one
[47:56] and the answer says in Luke 10 37 and he
[47:58] said he that showed Mercy on him
[48:02] then Jesus sent Jesus unto him go and do
[48:05] thou likewise
[48:06] because Jesus is answering the question
[48:08] of eternal life
[48:10] eternal life is living for others
[48:12] we who claim to possess the gift of
[48:15] eternal life then do not live selfishly
[48:18] but we live beyond ourselves
[48:20] not that we we can't live foolish we
[48:23] can't live perishly we can't give what
[48:25] we don't have we should never give
[48:26] Beyond there ought to be a prudence and
[48:29] a wisdom to this so there's not there's
[48:31] not any implication nor should there be
[48:33] any
[48:34] um uh inference on your part that I am
[48:36] you know expressing some sort of
[48:38] Reckless living where I'm just living
[48:40] for others but you didn't have to give
[48:41] everything away I mean you do need a car
[48:43] to get to work well my neighbor needed
[48:45] it right signed it over to him you know
[48:48] there's there's a there's some wisdom
[48:49] here
[48:50] that that in your giving if you could
[48:52] think of it this way that if you're kind
[48:54] of inclined to extremes and fanaticism
[48:56] right if you're a Peter who's like Lord
[48:58] you can't wash my face hey if I don't
[49:00] wash your feet you can have any part
[49:01] with me just dump me man
[49:03] head to toe just get every part of me
[49:05] wet and that's kind of the Peter
[49:07] mentality if that's kind of your
[49:08] tendency is to kind of be extreme and
[49:11] you're already trying to plot ways that
[49:12] you can just give away your 401k and and
[49:14] give out give away all your Bitcoin and
[49:16] everything because you want to live for
[49:17] others think about it in this sense that
[49:20] God is not going to require your service
[49:22] to others that's going to compromise
[49:23] your ability to serve him and to
[49:25] continue to serve others
[49:27] there's some wisdom that we can begin to
[49:29] have with this that living for others is
[49:31] not wasting my ability to serve God or
[49:33] compromise the ability to serve God or
[49:35] to continue to serve my family right
[49:37] continue to be effective within my own
[49:39] home within my own church and so I you
[49:41] know I'm saying this maybe not for us
[49:43] but for the neighbor in the apartment
[49:44] next door who just may be prone to
[49:47] fanaticism there's a wisdom that comes
[49:49] with this living for others but I feel
[49:51] that I can't uh
[49:53] can't say it with more fervancy or
[49:55] enough fervency that we ought to have
[49:57] this mind to love our neighbors as
[49:59] ourselves
[50:01] and the sermon the world has fallen
[50:02] apart
[50:04] brother bam says I'm I was talking to
[50:06] the cab driver coming down for those who
[50:09] don't know what a cab is it's kind of
[50:10] like an Uber driver Lyft I might have
[50:12] heard of those I was talking to the Uber
[50:14] driver coming down
[50:15] we was talking about some delinquent
[50:17] children up there and he said I think
[50:18] it's the parents I said amen and he's
[50:21] like yeah you get my tapes he says amen
[50:24] fella I don't know who you are but
[50:26] you're right on the right Road it's a
[50:28] good thing to say to your driver
[50:30] and I said that's right I said it's too
[50:33] bad that they've took the Bible out of
[50:34] the home and give them a deck of cards
[50:39] why is it getting so quiet
[50:41] and that started in the church I would
[50:44] stand on the elevator a few moments ago
[50:45] and a certain woman on there talking to
[50:46] another said well you know he said this
[50:49] is a wonderful thing our church is given
[50:50] a card party and how they're going to
[50:52] have some kind of a Thanksgiving turkey
[50:54] Affair that they was going out out of a
[50:56] Protestant church gambling Lottery Bunko
[50:59] dances
[51:03] he says stuff like that to entertain the
[51:06] church
[51:08] remember when I said in the beginning
[51:11] eternal life
[51:13] is an overlooked or often forgotten form
[51:16] of family entertainment
[51:19] eternal life is living for others
[51:21] Billy Graham says the church born again
[51:23] the Holy Ghost entertains the church
[51:26] with eternal life
[51:30] so how can the Holy Ghost entertain our
[51:32] families
[51:33] by us living for others
[51:36] this is probably the best form of family
[51:39] entertainment that we can have
[51:41] is living for others that as a family if
[51:44] there's a moment a time and a way even
[51:47] if it's just at the minimum through
[51:48] prayer who could we pray for tonight
[51:51] who is it that we can think of and ways
[51:53] that we can reach out and show kindness
[51:55] there's enough prayer requests that go
[51:56] out over this Pulpit where we have
[51:57] things that we can pray about as a
[51:59] family and we're living for others
[52:00] there's enough things and needs that
[52:01] come up we can always ride a nice car to
[52:03] think of a way that you could do
[52:04] something kind for somebody else our
[52:06] church has a wonderful testimony beyond
[52:08] our church here where I get uh my own
[52:11] family's been ministered to by the
[52:13] people in this church people sending
[52:14] gifts they heard my aunt had cancer
[52:16] people sent things and have provided
[52:18] cards and letters and we hear back and
[52:21] even have done that brother Michael I
[52:22] think even your own families testified
[52:24] to our prayer request goes out and says
[52:25] what can I do to help how can I help
[52:27] them and people have made things and sit
[52:28] things out as it's a wonderful testimony
[52:31] that now I get text messages from people
[52:33] and say hey I just had some somebody do
[52:35] really really nice something for me was
[52:37] this someone in your church
[52:39] right and they start here
[52:41] because that's because there's people
[52:43] who've taken this to Heart
[52:45] and I'm wanting I'm like uh should I
[52:47] claim it I mean should I say well
[52:49] technically you know they're all part of
[52:51] my church you know I mean I don't know I
[52:53] just say hey it wasn't me right or I
[52:56] don't know or maybe they need to be a
[52:57] part of our church what's their number
[53:00] but there's a it's wonderful when we can
[53:02] have that instinct and testimony of a
[53:04] church that you know what they're the
[53:05] reaching out kind
[53:07] they're the thoughtful kind they're the
[53:08] ones that are always looking Beyond
[53:10] themselves and I couldn't think of a
[53:12] better way for us to grow and prosper as
[53:14] a church the right ways than for us to
[53:16] begin to begin to be unselfish with what
[53:18] we have and live for others I desire for
[53:21] us to have um facilities I think these
[53:23] are very very nice and I thank God for
[53:24] it and the sacrifice that have been made
[53:25] for us to have this there may be some
[53:27] changes coming up to facilitate larger
[53:29] facilities and more room for people and
[53:31] I'd love to have
[53:33] um maybe maybe the short ceiling makes
[53:35] me look tall I don't know but maybe I'd
[53:37] love to have something a little bit more
[53:38] clearance so we can have brother Eli
[53:40] pray sometime you know and other things
[53:42] where he's worshiping back there and his
[53:43] hand is just like this on the ceiling
[53:45] right it's like how does that texture
[53:47] feel up there you like that huh
[53:49] is that a satin finish semi-gloss on the
[53:52] roof there I haven't been able to touch
[53:53] it you know there's there's just things
[53:55] that we might we want may want more of
[53:57] as a church I know and it doesn't need
[54:00] to begin by having a fun drive it could
[54:02] just Begin by having a fun drive
[54:05] right entertain ourselves by living for
[54:08] others
[54:09] like just just thinking Beyond ourselves
[54:11] and how can we help and how can we give
[54:13] and and why we would sure love to build
[54:15] a church but you know what we could
[54:16] probably have a faster track to building
[54:18] this church by building a few churches
[54:19] in Tanzania sure yes yes right why
[54:23] because we begin to entertain ourselves
[54:25] with eternal life
[54:27] and if you're saying wow that's kind of
[54:28] a neat little trick okay fine
[54:30] eternal life is living for others and
[54:31] the holy goes to Interchange that
[54:33] entertains the church with eternal life
[54:34] I believe there's some way by some
[54:36] degree we can arrive at our
[54:38] entertainment should be part of it
[54:40] should be living for others
[54:43] and that's how
[54:44] we can have some entertainment in our
[54:46] fans that's how we can allow the Holy
[54:47] Ghost to entertain us we maybe let
[54:49] Hollywood and and sports and movies and
[54:53] games and a lot of things entertain us a
[54:54] lot of recreation a lot of hobbies a lot
[54:55] of Endeavors we do whether it be hunting
[54:57] whether it be certain things that we
[54:59] enjoy for Collectibles you name it
[55:01] there's a lot of things that we can do
[55:02] that we have fun around I'm not saying
[55:04] anything about that I'm just saying
[55:06] there's another area of entertainment
[55:08] that we can have
[55:10] and that's living for others
[55:15] it's an interesting statement in Mark
[55:16] chapter 9 verse 35 and he sat down and
[55:19] called the twelve and said to them if
[55:20] any man desires to be first
[55:22] the same shall be last of all and
[55:25] servant
[55:26] of all
[55:28] this is what we ought to have as a
[55:29] church a servant's heart
[55:36] to be Servants of all
[55:39] in this pair or not the parable but in
[55:41] the story of the Rich Young Ruler
[55:45] Mark chapter 10 verses 21 to 22 I just
[55:49] want to refer to it very very quickly
[55:52] just make this point I believe we made
[55:54] this point in
[55:55] uh the series on talking about practice
[55:59] he said then Jesus Behold Him loved him
[56:00] said unto him because he gave what he
[56:02] came kind of with the same question
[56:03] right same question as a lawyer it says
[56:06] one thing about lack is go thy way so
[56:08] whatsoever thou Hast and give to the
[56:09] poor
[56:11] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[56:13] come take up the cross
[56:16] and follow me
[56:18] this is that that christ-like mentality
[56:21] who made himself of no reputation
[56:23] who being in the form of God thought
[56:25] about robbery to be equal with God but
[56:27] made himself with no reputation took
[56:28] upon him the form of man humbled himself
[56:30] became obedient even to the death of the
[56:32] Cross he's willing to be selfless
[56:34] unselfish and bear the sacrificial
[56:37] burden which was death
[56:39] and so Christ is asking the rich wrong
[56:41] ruler not not an easy thing but a very
[56:43] very difficult thing he tells him to
[56:44] sell everything he has to give to the
[56:46] poor that he may have treasure in heaven
[56:48] come take up the cross and follow me and
[56:50] it says and he was sad at that saying
[56:51] and went away grieved for he had great
[56:53] possessions
[56:56] see the goal of Christ was not to make
[56:58] the Rich Man Poor
[57:01] but the goal of Christ was to get him to
[57:03] turn his eyes towards heaven
[57:05] and no longer live Desiring to
[57:08] accumulate wealth and maintain prestige
[57:12] and have for his own sake but to turn
[57:15] his eyes towards heaven and live for
[57:17] others
[57:18] so the goal of Christ was that poverty
[57:19] the goal of Christ was service
[57:21] the goal that Christ wanted to have
[57:23] within this young man's heart was to
[57:24] stir up whether or not there was any
[57:26] inkling of of eternal life inside of him
[57:29] that could be lit at the thought of
[57:33] serving someone else
[57:35] is it isn't that the only way that we
[57:37] receive eternal life is when we're
[57:38] willing to no longer live to satisfy
[57:40] ourselves but willing down to live for
[57:41] God and it's this desire for him to
[57:43] become our Lord and to no longer live
[57:45] unto sin and live in the pleasures of
[57:46] this world but we turn the other way and
[57:48] we turn towards Christ and we repent of
[57:50] our sins and we are now willing to
[57:51] Humble ourselves and live for him
[57:54] and the reason why we can do that is
[57:55] that germ of life is eternal and it's
[57:58] it's designation is not to live
[58:00] selfishly but to live for others Christ
[58:04] first and then by extension therefore I
[58:06] have to live for others so what he was
[58:08] provoking inside of this Rich wrong
[58:09] ruler wasn't this thought of well I
[58:11] could I guess I could live with nothing
[58:12] I don't doesn't matter to me I mean
[58:14] there's some people that they don't they
[58:16] don't need a bed they'll sleep anywhere
[58:17] I mean even as grown adults it's like
[58:19] hey I can live out of my car hey and
[58:23] they don't need a lot but it's it's not
[58:25] so much just how much you can be a base
[58:27] and how poor you can be and hey man I'm
[58:29] completely worthless you know I'm so
[58:31] broke I can't even pay attention
[58:33] no it's it's this idea of just changing
[58:35] your mind to where I'm not living for
[58:38] myself the goal is not poverty the goal
[58:40] is service
[58:41] and if I could put it this way the goal
[58:43] is neither riches nor poverty the goal
[58:45] is being christ-like the goal is service
[58:48] service to Christ and therefore by
[58:50] extension to others
[58:54] I've got two minutes before we make it
[58:56] to the after hour
[58:57] in the church age book chapter six it's
[58:59] my last statement chapter on thyterra
[59:03] Jesus said he that is greatest of all is
[59:05] servant to all
[59:07] there's that statement
[59:10] the servant of all
[59:12] the wise man commented on that saying
[59:14] here's what he said only history will
[59:16] prove the truth of the that dictum
[59:18] that man was right
[59:20] you notice I know he's going to express
[59:22] he's going to express it and begin to
[59:24] amplify it but do you realize what he's
[59:26] saying
[59:27] it's only once we give account of how
[59:29] you lived your life
[59:31] it's only in the final analysis that
[59:32] we'll know those people who truly lived
[59:34] not under themselves
[59:36] but unto others only history will prove
[59:38] the truth of that that man was right all
[59:41] the truly great men of history have been
[59:42] servants
[59:44] they who demanded to be served they who
[59:46] oppressed they who sought to always be
[59:48] at the head and have got have gone down
[59:50] in shame
[59:52] even the very rich are condemned by God
[59:54] when they have not used their wealth
[59:56] right
[1:00:00] but look into history and you'll find
[1:00:02] that the truly great were those who
[1:00:05] served others
[1:00:06] are we not taught in the message that a
[1:00:08] great man makes you feel great
[1:00:10] history can never claim those for whom
[1:00:13] much was done
[1:00:15] but will forever praise those who did
[1:00:17] much for others
[1:00:19] now let us apply that to ourselves
[1:00:22] even as the son of man came not to be
[1:00:26] ministered unto you but to minister so
[1:00:28] we are to follow that example oh I just
[1:00:32] love this
[1:00:33] see him as he bows himself over the feet
[1:00:36] of the Apostles
[1:00:37] and washes their tired and dirty feet
[1:00:40] he says you don't know now what I'm
[1:00:42] doing
[1:00:43] but you will know hereafter
[1:00:45] but what you see me doing you ought to
[1:00:47] also
[1:00:48] to do
[1:00:50] he became a servant in order that God
[1:00:53] could Elevate him to the highest Heights
[1:00:56] and one day in the Judgment of the
[1:00:58] Saints we are going to hear him say Well
[1:01:00] done good and faithful servant
[1:01:03] enter thou under the joy of the Lord I
[1:01:05] think he's using that scripture at a
[1:01:06] very specific application to the
[1:01:08] believer
[1:01:09] it is hard to be always a servant
[1:01:13] but those who spend and are spent for
[1:01:16] others will one day be seated with him
[1:01:18] in his throne
[1:01:19] it will be worth it all
[1:01:22] then
[1:01:24] if I could say if it's very difficult
[1:01:26] for you to even begin to comprehend the
[1:01:30] benefits that you may receive within
[1:01:31] your family within your personal life by
[1:01:33] living unselfishly by living for others
[1:01:35] if it's hard for you to think how this
[1:01:38] may Express itself in some sort of
[1:01:40] material benefit here on Earth or
[1:01:41] greater consolation when you lay your
[1:01:43] head down even if you don't seem to
[1:01:45] experience it like maybe you say well
[1:01:47] man brother Aaron made it seem like I
[1:01:48] was going to be a millionaire in six
[1:01:49] weeks if I just started Living for
[1:01:51] others if it doesn't happen exactly the
[1:01:53] way you're thinking it should tonight
[1:01:54] let me say this one day it will be worth
[1:01:58] it all
[1:02:00] thus saith Lord one day it will be worth
[1:02:03] it all and so let me just uh take this
[1:02:06] moment now as I believe will be next
[1:02:09] Sunday this coming Sunday we're going to
[1:02:10] maybe try to wrap up on those three that
[1:02:11] we've been focusing on Sunday and sum
[1:02:14] all this up on next Wednesday night and
[1:02:16] in this series if God will allow me to
[1:02:18] and permit you let me just say this that
[1:02:20] I believe that we've been given some
[1:02:22] very clear footprints that we can follow
[1:02:23] in
[1:02:24] to achieve Godly success this year
[1:02:27] and if we could even have this as our
[1:02:29] aim as we see this as breadcrumbs these
[1:02:31] are things I know ought to be doing
[1:02:32] these are things I know ought to be
[1:02:33] doing and for some of you you might be
[1:02:35] in that mode of already doing all these
[1:02:37] things and I'm giving you a big pat on
[1:02:39] the back Jose I'm giving you a lot of
[1:02:40] ambition and a lot of encouragement to
[1:02:42] keep doing what you're doing but if I
[1:02:43] could just say for the next uh maybe for
[1:02:46] some of us maybe the thing that we've
[1:02:47] got to move into is this unselfishness
[1:02:49] to begin to serve on a greater level and
[1:02:51] a greater capacity if I can say this way
[1:02:53] in the image of the son of man
[1:02:56] because that's what the son of man is
[1:02:58] manifesting himself in in this hour is a
[1:03:00] bride not saying what can he do for me
[1:03:02] what can he do for me but giving
[1:03:04] expression to our Revelation in service
[1:03:06] to others let's bow our heads in prayer
[1:03:09] our gracious Heavenly Father Lord I just
[1:03:11] want to pray for these people now and
[1:03:13] this this climax of this service with
[1:03:15] such a strong anointing and a desire in
[1:03:18] the people's hearts Lord for the things
[1:03:19] of God and a desire to be right a desire
[1:03:22] to serve a desire to be found faithful
[1:03:24] Lord I pray now for these families for
[1:03:27] the heads of household for the young
[1:03:29] ladies who are living on their own and
[1:03:31] for the young men who are bachelors in
[1:03:33] their apartments and their houses Lord
[1:03:35] for the for the the veterans amongst us
[1:03:37] and the elders the grandparents those
[1:03:39] who have already raised their children
[1:03:40] those who are in that season of the
[1:03:42] different seasons of life may we all
[1:03:44] come under this common bond in this
[1:03:46] common burden that we can give vent to
[1:03:50] this revelation of the message by how we
[1:03:52] treat others and how we live for others
[1:03:54] and I pray Lord for us us tonight that
[1:03:57] as a family as a church family we can
[1:03:59] have a heart and a burden for others I
[1:04:02] pray for our own families as I said it
[1:04:04] in the very beginning may this not be an
[1:04:06] overlooked form of entertainment
[1:04:08] may we as we would find ways to sanctify
[1:04:11] our home and find moments
[1:04:13] to gather around the word may we find
[1:04:15] some way in our lives and in our homes
[1:04:19] Avenues and opportunities to live for
[1:04:21] others
[1:04:22] Granite I pray Lord as I commit the
[1:04:25] people to you now
[1:04:26] Lord if there be a heart that would
[1:04:28] reach out to you and lift their hand and
[1:04:30] say Lord I want to live for others
[1:04:33] made you endure us Lord may your Holy
[1:04:37] Spirit give us strength to live for
[1:04:39] others give us the resources to live for
[1:04:41] others I do not believe that there can
[1:04:43] be a desire unless there be a provision
[1:04:44] there'll be something there to meet that
[1:04:46] desire so Lord I'm praying that you
[1:04:48] would drive away any selfishness any
[1:04:51] fear for lack of provision may we be
[1:04:54] like that Widow is there a fat Lord who
[1:04:57] is just so willing
[1:04:59] willing to give of her resources
[1:05:02] and may we Lord take even
[1:05:06] from our little Lord
[1:05:08] pledge it to you
[1:05:11] for a little as much when you are in it
[1:05:15] may we labor for the right things Lord I
[1:05:17] commit the people to you tonight
[1:05:19] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:05:21] pray amen
[1:05:24] Hallelujah could we stand together
