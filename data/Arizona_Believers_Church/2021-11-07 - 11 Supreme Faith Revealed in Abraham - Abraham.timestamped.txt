[0:02] genesis chapter 17 we're going to begin
[0:04] with verse 1
[0:05] and when abram was 90 years old and nine
[0:08] the lord appeared to abram and said unto
[0:10] him i am the almighty god
[0:12] walk before me and be thou perfect
[0:14] and i will make my covenant between me
[0:17] and thee and will multiply thee
[0:19] exceedingly and abraham fell on his face
[0:22] and god talked with him saying as for me
[0:24] behold my covenant is with thee and thou
[0:27] shalt be a father of many nations
[0:30] neither shall thy name any more be
[0:32] called abram but thy name shall be
[0:34] abraham for a father of many nations
[0:37] have i made thee and i will make thee
[0:39] exceeding fruitful and i will make
[0:41] nations of thee and kings shall come out
[0:44] of thee and i will establish my covenant
[0:46] between me and thee and thy seed after
[0:48] thee in their generations for an
[0:51] everlasting covenant very important
[0:53] phrase everlasting covenant to be a god
[0:56] unto thee and to thy seed after thee and
[0:59] i will give unto thee unto thy seed
[1:01] after thee the land wherein thou art to
[1:03] stranger all the land of canaan for an
[1:06] everlasting possession and i will be
[1:09] their god
[1:10] amen god bless you can have your seats
[1:15] we've been in the
[1:17] subject of supreme faith revealed in
[1:20] hebrew abraham
[1:21] and looking at
[1:23] it from the standpoint that the life of
[1:26] abraham tells our testimony we're not
[1:28] just reading about the events in
[1:30] abraham's life but yet it speaks to us
[1:33] it tells a testimony to us from his
[1:35] election
[1:36] to the perfect expression of his faith a
[1:39] supreme expression of his faith on mount
[1:41] moriah from faith to perfect faith we
[1:43] can see ourselves in the journey of
[1:45] abraham and brother branham even makes
[1:48] the statement that when god called
[1:49] abraham out of er that was the beginning
[1:52] of christianity so we ought to be able
[1:53] to begin to see ourselves
[1:56] in the life of abraham
[1:58] and i realized it and it's actually
[2:01] it was just something that kind of
[2:02] gripped me right before i came out that
[2:03] um
[2:04] i don't take this the wrong way but oh
[2:06] no what's my point
[2:08] and um and i realized that kind of just
[2:10] in a moment had forgot that really this
[2:12] is foundational
[2:13] and that it builds on the things that we
[2:15] have been ministering
[2:17] and that uh
[2:19] we're wanting you to see yourself in the
[2:21] life of abraham so there's a lot of
[2:22] things i'm trying like like kind of what
[2:24] i mentioned before sometimes i just try
[2:25] to get all the lumber laid out and then
[2:27] i'll put it all together in upcoming
[2:29] services there's a lot of principles i'm
[2:30] wanting to put out there to share with
[2:32] you so it's kind of in the middle you
[2:34] think brother aaron it's part 11 how
[2:35] could this be foundational wanting to
[2:37] look at it from a different vantage
[2:39] point or just another take another step
[2:41] in this
[2:42] and but it's important to relate
[2:45] personally
[2:46] to the story of abraham and relate
[2:49] personally to the things that god has
[2:50] preserved in his word because they're
[2:52] preserved for our benefit
[2:54] and not for a bedtime story uh not to
[2:57] just have kind of a knowledge of history
[2:59] and exercise our minds but it really is
[3:02] for our benefit to achieve rapturing
[3:03] faith that these things have been
[3:05] preserved for us
[3:06] and we've been looking at for the last
[3:08] few services how that god called abraham
[3:10] out of babylon and in genesis chapter 11
[3:13] genesis chapter 12 god is calling
[3:15] abraham out of babylon and we've seen
[3:17] just what a perfect type this is for of
[3:19] the bride of jesus christ especially in
[3:21] the end time and so we see how abraham's
[3:24] life is foreshadowing events in our own
[3:26] life foreshadowing events with the
[3:28] church and that brother branham
[3:30] specifically says what god is showing
[3:32] abraham and what he's doing to abraham
[3:34] he's going to do to his seed after him
[3:36] and i want to take just a few moments to
[3:39] express
[3:41] some principles about babylon
[3:43] in addition to what we had expressed
[3:45] last sunday
[3:46] and even wednesday night uh repeat one
[3:49] thing here a statement from the pergamy
[3:51] in church age chapter 5 of the church
[3:52] age book
[3:54] and just identify a few things so we
[3:55] could kind of orient ourselves today
[3:58] brother braham said monotheism turned to
[3:59] polytheism in babylon so prior to
[4:02] babylon there would have been a word the
[4:03] worship of one god and there would have
[4:05] been some consciousness of a true god
[4:07] and this narrative being passed down
[4:09] from noah and his sons there would have
[4:10] been this familiarity with
[4:13] uh with the one god but yet once babylon
[4:16] begins to take hold and nimrod begins to
[4:17] build cities
[4:19] and the civilization is again taking
[4:21] root that first took root um in the cane
[4:23] seed line
[4:25] the worship of one god turns to multiple
[4:27] gods or false gods and this statement to
[4:29] me is just
[4:31] you know it just hits really really hard
[4:32] right now it's almost as if sometimes
[4:34] you read something in the message like i
[4:36] feel like i've never read that before
[4:38] even though you know you've read that
[4:39] before and it says the devil's lie and
[4:41] the devil's mysteries rose up against
[4:44] the truth of god and the mysteries of
[4:46] god in that city
[4:48] in babel the tower babel in the city
[4:50] thereof and that region there in
[4:52] mesopotamia in that plain of shinar
[4:54] where this tower was built up and this
[4:56] city has been
[4:57] erected it says the devil's mysteries
[4:59] and the devil's lies
[5:01] rise up to oppose the truth of god and
[5:04] the mysteries of god so this is what
[5:06] this city represent this is what this
[5:08] tower represents and so this kingdom
[5:10] begin with nimrod building his kingdom
[5:13] and this takes place after the flood you
[5:15] begin to identify these things in
[5:16] genesis chapter 10.
[5:18] now for and i just want to make
[5:20] reference to this and i feel very good
[5:22] looking out upon the congregation today
[5:24] to be able to make statement statements
[5:26] like this because i'm really building on
[5:29] your your revelation and understanding
[5:31] of some fundamental truths in the word
[5:33] of god
[5:34] but in genesis chapter 11 remember that
[5:36] the entire earth is populated with what
[5:38] we could call a hybrid humanity
[5:41] that it is not it is not pure suns from
[5:44] adam that are inhabiting the earth but
[5:47] there is a mixed blood and there's a
[5:49] mixed seed upon the face of the earth
[5:51] and there's nobody that could take a 23
[5:53] in me and brag over the other person
[5:55] because they're all by one blood through
[5:57] noah's sons have spread out over the
[6:00] earth in other words there's no pure
[6:02] descendants of seth there's no direct
[6:05] descendants of adam but all have come
[6:07] from noah's sons
[6:09] and coming from noah's sons they're all
[6:11] this is this mixed blood it's a mixed
[6:13] humanity of cain's line and seth's line
[6:16] and it's been completely mixed over
[6:19] and so it's important to kind of
[6:20] identify how that abraham now exists
[6:22] within this culture and this climate and
[6:25] he's one of this massive humanity a
[6:27] massive gentiles we could say in nations
[6:30] and
[6:30] and another part is kind of like i just
[6:32] want that to kind of stand there
[6:35] on on its own just recognizing that kind
[6:37] of see the full
[6:39] uh sweeping over of the sin that began
[6:41] in the garden and now it's taken root uh
[6:44] in a mixed humanity and it's weakened
[6:46] the nations is a phrase that the bible
[6:48] uses
[6:49] and in genesis chapter 10 and verse 11
[6:52] we see that satan is building his eden
[6:54] with this fallen humanity with this
[6:56] mixed blood
[6:58] and he's be and it's right here in this
[6:59] land of shine arts it's in this babylon
[7:02] and it's in this region that is being
[7:04] zeroed in on and genesis chapter 10 and
[7:06] 11.
[7:08] and so this is just again a simple
[7:10] concept of satan building his eden
[7:13] and something is transpiring at this
[7:15] time of genesis chapter 10 genesis
[7:17] chapter 11 genesis chapter 12. now just
[7:20] ponder the role of satan in this
[7:22] in second corinthians chapter 4 verse 4
[7:25] it says in whom the god of this world
[7:27] hath blinded the minds of them which
[7:29] believe not lest the light of the
[7:31] glorious gospel of christ who is the
[7:33] image of god should shine unto them
[7:37] paul calls satan
[7:39] the god of this world
[7:41] so it's it's identifying
[7:43] some dominion some power some influence
[7:46] that he has we know he's not the god
[7:48] he's not the creator but he is a
[7:50] perverter of creation and as such he has
[7:53] become the god of this evil age he's
[7:55] become we know that this is satan's eden
[7:58] that we're living in now
[8:00] and
[8:00] jesus even speaks in john 12 31 now is
[8:03] the judgment of this world now the
[8:06] prince of this world be cast out so
[8:09] jesus identifying lucifer satan as the
[8:12] prince of this world the god of this
[8:14] world as paul says it
[8:16] again a writing in ephesians chapter 2
[8:18] verse 2 where in time past ye walked
[8:21] according to the course of this world
[8:23] according to the prince of the power of
[8:26] the air
[8:27] this is the god of this world the the
[8:29] prince of this world the prince of the
[8:31] power of the air the spirit that now
[8:33] worketh in the children of disobedience
[8:36] so this is what we see even in genesis
[8:37] chapter 10 in genesis chapter 11 the
[8:39] spirit of the prince of the power of the
[8:41] air we see this course of the world
[8:43] again gaining this quick momentum
[8:45] because it's remarkable to think that
[8:47] god had just destroyed the world
[8:49] because of their sin and their
[8:50] debauchery and then post flood and
[8:53] post-destruction of the world very
[8:55] quickly gets right back into the same
[8:56] frame of mind wherein they're they're
[8:59] the imagination of man is only evil
[9:01] continually and they're wanting to build
[9:02] a city and they're motivated to bypass
[9:04] judge
[9:05] god's judgments and they're working
[9:07] against the plan of god in the will of
[9:08] god and so what we see
[9:11] in the beginning in genesis 10 and 11
[9:13] this initiating and beginning this
[9:16] building of babylon and then we know how
[9:18] it sweeps through and we see babylon
[9:21] being very instrumental in the judgment
[9:22] of israel
[9:24] after they became a nation in the old
[9:25] testament and then we see that it turns
[9:27] into a papal babylon and there's a
[9:30] spiritual babylon and then there's this
[9:32] babylon that spiritually that's fighting
[9:34] against the church and against the bride
[9:36] and the scripture even calls it mystery
[9:38] babylon
[9:39] so there's this association of babylon
[9:41] with the agenda of satan and the working
[9:43] of satan whether it be in the natural or
[9:44] the spiritual and we know that the time
[9:47] that we're living in now is the climax
[9:49] of satan's eden
[9:50] like this is where satan is like hey i
[9:52] got it right this is it this is what
[9:55] i've been trying to achieve
[9:57] and brother bennett makes this statement
[9:59] god pronounced in genesis where satan's
[10:01] seat was
[10:02] and that was in babylon
[10:04] it's always been satan's seat
[10:06] now i know that in our minds when we
[10:08] think of a seat we want to we want to we
[10:10] want to know that there's a literal seat
[10:12] somewhere
[10:13] so we think of a literal babylon
[10:15] geographical locations a certain borders
[10:17] a zip code an area code can i use ways
[10:19] to get there and we want to and we think
[10:21] there's a literal seat but here we're
[10:23] just talking about a figurative seat
[10:26] that is in a way that there's this place
[10:28] where his power resides and it's not
[10:30] just over there between the tigris and
[10:32] euphrates river somewhere in iraq where
[10:34] satan is this is now a spiritual babylon
[10:37] the whole world is a babylon now his
[10:40] religion his mindset his influence is
[10:42] spread out through the whole world
[10:44] it's remarkable if you begin to read in
[10:46] mythology and you begin to read
[10:48] in different religions and whether it be
[10:51] uh buddhism or hinduism and all in all
[10:54] sorts of religions of the world you can
[10:55] see that it's been tainted by an
[10:57] influence by the agenda of satan in
[10:58] genesis chapter 10 to spread this this
[11:01] polytheism and this this perversion
[11:04] throughout all the world
[11:06] so it's in and again this is for the
[11:07] context of supreme faith being revealed
[11:10] in abraham and how it influences us and
[11:12] encourages us and
[11:14] helps us to understand the process that
[11:16] god has entered us into in this hour
[11:19] it's god chooses abraham
[11:22] where in er
[11:25] of the chaldeans he's calling him out of
[11:27] babylon and he does it to show us a
[11:29] pattern he does it for abraham and his
[11:32] sake but something's been expressed to
[11:33] us in this great truth of calling
[11:35] abraham out of babylon
[11:38] so this is uh let's maybe kind of
[11:40] summarize it genesis chapter 10 genesis
[11:42] chapter 11 which provides the context
[11:44] for god calling abraham in genesis
[11:46] chapter 12. like if you really want to
[11:49] understand the story of abraham and not
[11:50] just oh god told abraham to move you
[11:52] want to understand what god was calling
[11:54] him away from
[11:56] and what god was expressing what the
[11:57] conditions and the character of that age
[11:59] were and so in those chapters we see the
[12:02] rise of the devil's mystery against the
[12:04] mystery of god
[12:06] and this is what's coming to its
[12:07] preeminence this is what's rising up you
[12:09] could say there's this total blackout of
[12:11] the truth of god so god identifies one
[12:14] man and he calls them out
[12:15] and this is what god is doing to a bride
[12:17] in this hour
[12:19] now
[12:20] just uh maybe reset a little bit
[12:23] and
[12:25] and i'd just like to express it this way
[12:27] that abraham's faith in a lot of ways is
[12:29] mysterious we talked about it before how
[12:31] it could be so mysterious that it
[12:32] becomes legendary and
[12:34] idolized as opposed to something we know
[12:36] that we can achieve ourselves
[12:39] and his journey is mysterious
[12:41] and
[12:43] i believe this is what how god's been
[12:45] dealing with my heart that what struck
[12:47] me when i first began to look into these
[12:48] things recently uh for in this thought
[12:51] not that i've
[12:52] recently just started looking into the
[12:54] life of abraham everybody here anybody
[12:55] hear this guy
[12:57] um
[12:58] or started looking at it again freshly
[12:59] what struck me is
[13:01] man to really understand abraham's faith
[13:02] you want to understand the context of it
[13:04] and you understand what was going on
[13:06] what was happening in this his life that
[13:08] it's not just this
[13:09] legendary faith of this man that one day
[13:11] heard a voice that told him to sacrifice
[13:13] his son and that we all need to be
[13:15] obedient to that voice when it tells us
[13:16] to kill a family member like just do it
[13:18] it's god you just got to do it that this
[13:21] was there was context to the evolution
[13:23] and the growth of abraham's revelation
[13:25] and faith as i began to look at the
[13:27] context being like wow this is very
[13:29] relatable abraham's life is relatable
[13:31] and this is the process that god is
[13:33] putting me through as a man to bring me
[13:35] to my mount mariah my mount zion
[13:38] showdown of rapturing faith
[13:40] and and so i want to be i think in
[13:42] looking at it this context is required
[13:45] i'm getting more context to abraham's
[13:46] faith to just help us to more fully
[13:49] understand our own faith not just
[13:51] abraham's faith
[13:53] and i want to introduce it this way this
[13:55] morning
[13:56] that the mystery of abraham's faith and
[13:58] the mystery of abraham's journey is
[14:00] hidden in genesis chapter one to four
[14:03] that we've kind of looked at you start
[14:05] with genesis 12 to tell abraham's life
[14:07] maybe the end of chapter 11 and then you
[14:09] kind of go all the way to chapter 25 and
[14:10] you're looking at that to understand the
[14:12] faith of abraham but we just took a step
[14:14] back and began to look at the beginning
[14:15] of chapter 11 and realize wow there's a
[14:18] lot more context to the story of abraham
[14:20] than just how did we get here then god
[14:22] calls abraham but the details that god
[14:25] is sharing prior to the story of abraham
[14:27] are very very important and i began to
[14:28] look at the first four chapters of the
[14:30] book of the bible and realize wow
[14:33] this is connecting deeply and directly
[14:35] to the life of abraham
[14:37] because there's many intriguing aspects
[14:39] of his life that cause us to ponder to
[14:42] think and to wonder and
[14:44] hypothesize or maybe postulate or ask
[14:46] questions and try to figure out well
[14:48] why are these things the way that they
[14:50] are and oftentimes we could ask the
[14:52] question say well it just is
[14:54] but you could ask a question why did he
[14:56] have to leave her
[14:58] why is it that god could not have just
[14:59] given him the promise in her and god
[15:02] just given him the possession of her
[15:05] and driven out all the inhabitants or
[15:06] made him a great ruler in er and toppled
[15:08] over polytheism and he became a great
[15:10] ruler and leader to bring everyone back
[15:12] to monotheism why did he have to leave
[15:14] er
[15:14] this is the city this a thriving city
[15:18] there in babylon why did he have to
[15:19] leave that and maybe we've answered that
[15:22] to some degree in terms of god was
[15:24] calling them out of babylon the seed of
[15:25] satan these evil powers
[15:27] but then you could say well then why did
[15:29] he have to say separate from his family
[15:31] why couldn't he take his father why
[15:33] couldn't he take his brothers why
[15:34] couldn't he take his nephew why did he
[15:36] have to separate from his father and
[15:38] then his brothers but then even his
[15:39] nephew why did it have to this division
[15:41] keep going down in this separation these
[15:43] are interesting questions to ponder
[15:45] because you find it that the bible even
[15:47] referring to when he separated from lot
[15:49] he says um then after he had separated
[15:52] from lot then god gives him maybe a more
[15:55] detailed and more profound promise so
[15:58] hey you're just going to father a lot of
[16:00] kids and your kids are going to have a
[16:01] lot of kids and their kids are going to
[16:02] have a lot of kids he gets more specific
[16:04] and more detailed once he's separated
[16:06] from lot and and the context is now that
[16:08] he's separated from lot i can tell him
[16:10] more
[16:11] and so there's
[16:12] it's an interesting question why god had
[16:14] to narrow it down
[16:16] why did he have to wander so much
[16:19] why didn't god just take them out of er
[16:22] and place them right smack dab in hebron
[16:24] and say you're going to live here you're
[16:25] going to die you're going to be buried
[16:26] here
[16:27] and why did he why did he take the path
[16:29] that he did why did god you think about
[16:31] it why did god allow him to have a son
[16:33] by hagar
[16:35] like this is the father of our faith
[16:38] all right why why did god preserve
[16:40] conversations where god says hey abraham
[16:43] you're going to have a son by sarah and
[16:45] his name's going to be isaac and he's
[16:46] like oh no no no god just let ishmael
[16:48] live before you that this is preserved
[16:51] in the testimony of abraham this one who
[16:53] came to this perfect faith and by faith
[16:56] you know staggered not at the promise of
[16:57] god through unbelief yet these things
[16:59] are perser preserved we think well why
[17:01] did god allow him to have a son by hagar
[17:05] are you expecting me to answer all these
[17:07] questions today because if you are i'm
[17:09] going to stop because man i've got like
[17:10] a list of ones i could come up with god
[17:12] i'm just scatter shooting here
[17:17] and so maybe i'll just leave it at those
[17:18] questions i'm sure you got some real
[17:19] doozies and we could talk about them
[17:21] later but there's a lot of questions
[17:22] we'd want to ask why this way why this
[17:24] way and i will say this i believe that
[17:27] as i preach today
[17:29] these questions can be answered not that
[17:31] i'm going to say this is the reason and
[17:33] this is that but i believe the answer's
[17:34] in the word
[17:37] so
[17:38] let's begin to think and and i realize
[17:41] that my thought today is very
[17:42] foundational very very very simple
[17:44] i hate to disappoint anybody but since i
[17:47] began pastor depreciation last sunday
[17:49] we're going to get more and more simple
[17:51] more and more simple
[17:52] and they
[17:54] but please focus because i think
[17:56] sometimes when it gets real simple
[17:57] sometimes we kind of check out
[17:59] right so please stay very very focused i
[18:01] don't want to lose any of you today
[18:04] and i i want to say this the story of
[18:07] abraham
[18:08] or let me phrase it this way the story
[18:10] of redemption in abraham
[18:12] is connected with the story of the
[18:13] fallen adam
[18:15] so the story of redemption that we see
[18:17] in abraham is connected with the story
[18:19] of the fall of adam
[18:22] and in genesis chapter one two three and
[18:24] four we could say that this not
[18:26] incomplete because then i know there's
[18:28] some narrative as to uh generations but
[18:31] there it tells adam's story
[18:34] and i want i'm not going to do it
[18:36] completely today
[18:37] at all i'm not going to do it on a
[18:38] surface level i'm just merely
[18:40] referencing it today that is the first
[18:42] four chapters of the bible tell a adam's
[18:45] story i want to compare it to abraham's
[18:47] story in genesis chapter 12 to 25
[18:50] and just start looking at how the life
[18:52] of abraham compares but also contrasts
[18:55] to the life of adam and they're
[18:57] connected together
[18:59] and i want to start with genesis chapter
[19:01] 2 verses 8 to 15
[19:03] and read this
[19:05] and i've been studying more on this
[19:06] particular aspect of it
[19:09] and i've taken some things and just
[19:11] moved them to the side to hopefully get
[19:12] to on wednesday night
[19:15] but it says in genesis chapter 2 verses
[19:17] 8 to 15 and the lord god planted a
[19:19] garden eastward in eden
[19:22] and there
[19:23] he put the man whom he had formed
[19:26] man what is adam it's not really a name
[19:28] as much as it's a word used for humanity
[19:31] or mankind so adam's name is really
[19:34] it's humankind during the man
[19:36] and that's where we get adam and it says
[19:39] and out of the ground
[19:41] made the lord god to grow every tree
[19:42] that is pleasant to the sight
[19:45] and good for food the tree of life also
[19:47] in the midst of the garden
[19:50] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[19:51] evil now it gets descriptive of this
[19:54] region this area
[19:55] and a river went out of eden to water
[19:58] the garden so there's a river that goes
[20:00] out of eden it's a river that would uh
[20:02] have its
[20:03] genesis or its origin out of eden and
[20:07] then it waters this garden that god had
[20:09] planted in in eden we realize those are
[20:11] two different
[20:12] as you have eden a garden in eden and so
[20:15] even after mankind is sent out of the
[20:18] garden they still dwelt in eden
[20:20] and there was this uh
[20:23] allure to the east gate to worship
[20:25] because there they had been driven out
[20:28] and so it says and from fence it was
[20:29] part of this river that went out of eden
[20:31] it was parted and became into four heads
[20:34] and so this is
[20:36] this region is not geographically
[20:38] identifiable today
[20:40] they're not able to find one river in
[20:43] this in a particular location that
[20:45] breaks out into these four heads uh that
[20:48] satisfied anybody there's a lot of
[20:49] speculation as to where it is and a lot
[20:51] of speculation as to uh exactly where it
[20:54] is located but it's not that we could
[20:56] find uh this exact these exact
[20:58] geographical descriptions today the name
[21:00] of the first is paisan
[21:02] that is it which compasseth the whole
[21:04] land of havala where there is gold so
[21:06] there's a lot of things that kind of
[21:07] give us this context to
[21:11] the resources and the topography and the
[21:14] layout of the land and the gold of that
[21:15] land is is good there is bedlam in the
[21:17] onyx stone and the name of the second
[21:19] river is gehon the same is it the same
[21:22] as it that can pass up the whole land of
[21:24] ethiopia
[21:26] and the name of the third river is
[21:27] hiddekel that is
[21:29] this is that this is it which goeth
[21:31] toward the east of assyria and the
[21:34] fourth river is euphrates
[21:36] now even the the hittakel is also
[21:39] referred to as the tigris river
[21:41] and so this land that's being described
[21:43] as describing
[21:45] what's actually between the tigris river
[21:47] and the euphrates river which uh
[21:50] we could eat we could safely assume
[21:51] we're named after the flood
[21:53] right because these these rivers would
[21:55] have
[21:55] been underwater during a flood but after
[21:57] the flood waters receive
[21:59] noah and his sons would have had some
[22:01] knowledge of these geographical
[22:02] landmarks and these rivers and so post
[22:05] flood whether these are the actual
[22:07] rivers themselves in the exact same
[22:09] place you know i guess some could argue
[22:11] and speculate but it's between the
[22:13] tigris and the
[22:14] euphrates river ahead to kell that
[22:16] babylon arises
[22:18] and so i believe the bible is orienting
[22:20] us to a general location and that these
[22:23] rivers are given
[22:25] this placement of being the whole land
[22:27] of ethiopia and euphrates and the and
[22:29] the assyrian these different things it's
[22:30] kind of orienting us to a particular
[22:33] area
[22:34] and it says in the lord god took the man
[22:36] remember it says there he planted a
[22:37] garden eastward in eden and there he put
[22:40] the man now it says the lord god took
[22:42] the man and put him into the garden of
[22:45] eden to dress it and keep it
[22:48] and so eden would be a larger region the
[22:50] garden a specific location within it
[22:53] and i want to mention this now that
[22:56] garden of eden a lot of different
[22:57] translations and even within the the
[23:00] uh the oral tradition of the jews the
[23:03] garden of eden would be called the
[23:04] paradise of god
[23:06] and that's what it would be referred to
[23:07] as as a paradise a paradise even the the
[23:10] persian word for paradise would be
[23:12] pleasant
[23:13] a pleasant ground a a pleasant place and
[23:16] it would speak of pleasantness and eden
[23:18] means delight so this is a paradise
[23:20] that's being described in in this eden
[23:23] this paradise there's this garden this
[23:25] planting of the lord
[23:27] and
[23:28] it's in this
[23:32] the garden that we're looking at the
[23:34] garden eastern end there he put the man
[23:36] and god took the man and put him in the
[23:38] garden of eden this is the setting for
[23:40] adam's existence
[23:42] then we begin to ponder his origin and
[23:44] his life and how his living this is
[23:46] where this is exactly where he was
[23:48] placed even his body originates from
[23:50] this land and this is adam's home this
[23:52] is where adam exists this is where he
[23:54] dwells
[23:55] and you are being well read in the
[23:57] scripture and i realized even this past
[23:59] week that
[24:01] there's a lot of things that connect
[24:02] into the things that we fellowshipped on
[24:04] and in the beginning god created a
[24:06] family and that focusing in on those
[24:08] first few chapters and how profound the
[24:10] bible lays out this creation and the
[24:12] family and the promises of god and the
[24:14] foreshadowing and the types and when god
[24:16] pla takes adam gives him a body plants
[24:19] him puts him right there within the
[24:21] garden of eden he gives them dominion
[24:24] over everything upon earth he gives them
[24:26] power over everything on earth and he's
[24:28] given a possession
[24:30] of the land of possession of eden
[24:31] possession of the earth you could say
[24:33] and he's given a responsibility over
[24:36] eden he's to dress in and he's to keep
[24:38] it and there's these things that he must
[24:40] do upon the face of the earth and in
[24:42] genesis chapter 1 verse 28 it says god
[24:44] bless them and god said unto them be
[24:46] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[24:50] earth and subdue it
[24:52] and have dominion over the fish of the
[24:53] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[24:54] over every living thing that moveth upon
[24:57] the earth
[24:58] this is a commandment notice he says
[25:01] god
[25:02] really in your mind i want you to just
[25:03] grasp or not grasp i know you understand
[25:05] this but
[25:06] kind of put this image in your mind that
[25:08] god
[25:08] creates a man
[25:10] spirit being then takes a body puts that
[25:13] spirit in the body and basically takes
[25:16] him and plants him
[25:18] right in the middle of this garden and
[25:19] then he tells him to be
[25:21] right be fruitful
[25:23] multiply replenish he's telling him what
[25:25] these things that he must do this is
[25:26] your to-do list subdue the earth have
[25:28] demeanor with the fish and over the foul
[25:29] there everything that lives and moves
[25:31] upon the face of the earth you you you
[25:33] take it you control it
[25:35] and there is this commandment and be
[25:37] fruitful multiply and replenish the
[25:38] earth that there was they were to spread
[25:41] out over the earth they were to possess
[25:42] every inch of it and starting with the
[25:45] man and the woman how that they would
[25:46] possess the garden and they would have
[25:48] seed that the seed after them would then
[25:50] likewise go forth and mo be fruitful
[25:53] multiply and possess and they were to
[25:55] spread out replenish the earth fill it
[25:56] up
[25:58] and then the the first figure in the
[25:59] first representation of this would have
[26:01] been in the man and the woman so this is
[26:03] a commandment to spread out to possess
[26:05] every inch of the earth and it's against
[26:07] this commandment that they rebel in
[26:08] genesis 11 to spread out over the earth
[26:11] they said let's build us a city in a
[26:12] tower so that we don't spread out over
[26:14] the earth
[26:16] so it is called in some
[26:18] this covenant that god gave adam the
[26:20] adamic covenant or even the edenic
[26:22] covenant maybe refer to two different
[26:25] ways and we know there's another
[26:27] covenant given to adam in the fall
[26:29] but this eden covenant contained
[26:32] blessings
[26:33] and also warnings
[26:36] there was blessings in it or
[26:38] commandments do this do this but there's
[26:40] also a warning
[26:42] and the image that i'm wanting just to
[26:44] very narrowly focus on right now is you
[26:46] have one man
[26:47] and a woman the woman you could say his
[26:49] wife
[26:50] under a commandment
[26:52] with
[26:53] in a conditional covenant
[26:55] this is the image of genesis chapter two
[26:57] in genesis chapter three one man and his
[26:59] wife under commandment with the
[27:01] conditional covenant
[27:03] and adam has just placed in this
[27:05] beautiful garden
[27:06] he is he's in a perfect land and adam
[27:09] himself and the woman are fully equipped
[27:12] with the promise
[27:14] and the ability to fulfill that promise
[27:17] and adam does not need to journey to
[27:19] find the land wherein he's going to
[27:21] fulfill the he can fulfill the promise
[27:23] he does not have to seek after the
[27:25] resources to achieve the fulfilling of
[27:27] the promise he's just placed there
[27:29] everything's perfect everything is
[27:31] exactly in order god gives them a
[27:33] promise he gives them the ability to
[27:35] fulfill the promise and so we can say
[27:36] that abra adam's life begins in
[27:38] perfection
[27:41] it's life it's power it's dominion it's
[27:43] abundance and it's fertile with
[27:45] possibility
[27:47] adam
[27:49] is fertile the woman is fertile they're
[27:52] ripe with all this possibility and
[27:54] everything when you say the world is
[27:55] your oyster that's where it begins right
[27:58] right there the word this was this is
[28:00] the first oyster
[28:02] and adam and the woman can have whatever
[28:04] they want live in abundance and and they
[28:07] could speak and bring forth and they
[28:09] could control and might talk about just
[28:11] an extraordinary
[28:13] condition the eden condition perfection
[28:16] sublime you couldn't even you can't even
[28:18] describe it just talking about it right
[28:20] now
[28:21] you know
[28:22] adam's thinking man you're really
[28:23] painting a bleak picture
[28:26] because it was so great it was so
[28:28] powerful and beautiful that's the story
[28:31] of adam that's how the story of adam
[28:32] begins
[28:34] listen to the beginning of the story of
[28:35] abraham
[28:36] remember i didn't talk about comparing
[28:38] and comparing there's a lot of
[28:39] similarities
[28:41] but there's some contrast too
[28:42] genesis chapter 11 verse 27 to 31 now
[28:45] these are the generations of terror
[28:47] terror begat abraham nehor and haran and
[28:49] haran begat lot and haran died before
[28:52] his father death right at the beginning
[28:54] of the story of abraham
[28:56] his brother dies before his father taran
[28:58] the land of his nativity in ur of the
[29:00] chaldees
[29:01] and abraha abram and nahor took them
[29:03] wives the name of abram's wife was sarah
[29:06] and the name of nehor's wife milka the
[29:08] daughter of ron the father of milka and
[29:10] the father of iska
[29:12] but sarah was barren she had no child
[29:16] this is this is we're
[29:18] we're being introduced to abram
[29:20] and you can say well uh here's nehor
[29:22] here's his wife milka and she's the
[29:24] daughter of haran who's the father of
[29:26] milk and the father iska
[29:27] and they say oh and this is sarah
[29:30] abram's wife and she can't have kids
[29:33] well who's her dad you know you know
[29:35] tell me more about her but it's oh sarah
[29:37] she can't have kids she's barren
[29:39] it says that tara took abram his son and
[29:41] lot the son of haran his son's son and
[29:43] sarah his daughter-in-law his son
[29:45] abram's wife and they went forth with
[29:47] them from ur the chaldees to go into the
[29:50] land of canaan to go into they leave to
[29:52] go into the land of canaan so there's a
[29:54] journey and they came under haran and
[29:56] dwelt there
[29:57] i think of how differently the story of
[29:59] abraham begins than the story of adam
[30:03] i know it's really really obvious very
[30:05] very elementary but just let me get
[30:07] started you got to you know walk before
[30:09] you can run and i still have training
[30:10] wheels on my ministerial bicycle i
[30:12] understand but just be patient with me
[30:15] that here
[30:16] adam's story begins in perfection
[30:19] and it's sublime and it's wonderful
[30:23] commandment covenant
[30:25] and here's everything you need you're
[30:27] where you need to be you have everything
[30:28] you need and be fruitful multiply
[30:31] replenish yours subdue have power have
[30:33] dominion i've given it all to you
[30:35] but abraham's story starts with the
[30:37] barren wife and then it's kind of like a
[30:39] never-ending road trip
[30:42] and it begins this meandering journey
[30:46] and abram is called to go to a land he's
[30:48] called to a destiny that even in the
[30:51] beginning he doesn't know
[30:54] adam is just created and planted in the
[30:57] garden of eden is like this is where
[30:58] you're going to live possess this subdue
[31:00] it it's all yours bbb
[31:05] and adam has every ability and uh to do
[31:07] it and bring it to pass and then with
[31:09] abram it's like hey i want you to leave
[31:10] your family come with me
[31:14] but like adam
[31:16] he was given a covenant
[31:19] like adam he's given a commandment
[31:21] it says in genesis chapter 12 verses 6
[31:23] to 7 i know that we're skipping in this
[31:25] story of abram but we've been covering
[31:26] it through many services and it says
[31:28] abram passed through the land under the
[31:31] place of shechem under the plain amore
[31:33] and the canaanite was then in the land
[31:35] he's now in the land of canaan that he
[31:38] had started off to go to when he left ur
[31:40] and the lord appeared unto abram and
[31:43] said
[31:44] this is where
[31:45] this promise begins to take
[31:48] on
[31:49] more detail because he tells him at the
[31:51] beginning when he says the lord when he
[31:52] called him out of er he had said i'll
[31:54] make you a great nation and i will bless
[31:55] thee make thy name great you're going to
[31:56] be a blessing
[31:58] and
[31:58] his
[32:00] promise begins with blessing
[32:02] and there's cursing but who's the curse
[32:04] to
[32:05] and who's the warning to there's no
[32:06] warning to abraham it's i'm going to
[32:09] curse whoever curses you
[32:11] so it's all blessing to abram
[32:13] but now god is going to be very
[32:14] particular and specific because now he's
[32:17] calling them out into a land that i'm
[32:18] going to show you here after so this is
[32:19] where i think these two
[32:21] jumping into this part because these two
[32:23] parts now come together because he said
[32:25] i'm going to make you a father of many
[32:26] nations though his wife had no children
[32:28] but now he says unto thy seed i have no
[32:30] children as of yet but you're going to
[32:32] have a seed unto thy seed i will give
[32:34] this land
[32:37] this is the promise to your to thy seed
[32:39] i will give this then thy seed this land
[32:42] and then abraham's response there he
[32:44] builded an altar unto the lord who
[32:45] appeared unto him
[32:47] this is where i want to make the
[32:48] connection adam and abraham are
[32:50] connected by the promise of land and the
[32:52] seed
[32:54] this is where we begin to see this
[32:56] connection between adam and abraham adam
[32:59] is given a covenant conditional covenant
[33:01] he's given a promise he's given a
[33:03] commandment with blessings and warning
[33:06] abraham's given a covenant he's given a
[33:07] promise and he's given a promise with
[33:08] blessings and then a warning to his
[33:10] enemies but this promise is to thy seed
[33:13] so there's seed i'm going to give this
[33:16] land
[33:17] and adam was given a land to possess
[33:19] presently when he was planted in the
[33:21] garden of eden god said this is it and
[33:23] he has this
[33:24] this physical consciousness in this
[33:26] garden everything you look everything
[33:28] you see is yours the earth is yours this
[33:30] garden is yours have dominion possess it
[33:32] anything that moves flies
[33:34] the herbs the tree the fruit of the
[33:36] trees it's all yours take it possess it
[33:39] adam had this present possession and the
[33:41] present commandment to be fruitful with
[33:44] every ability to carry it out
[33:47] but abraham has no possession in the
[33:49] land
[33:50] he has no possession of land
[33:53] and he has no seed
[33:56] but yet god promises both
[33:59] adam had the land and he had the
[34:01] virility he had the he had the ability
[34:02] to give life he he had a wife whose womb
[34:05] could bring forth uh children and so
[34:07] here uh the image of adam is be fruitful
[34:12] this commandment i just summarized it as
[34:14] a commandment
[34:15] and the possibility and the promise
[34:18] and then abraham he's got his land he's
[34:20] got his garden abraham has no land and
[34:22] he has no seed but god promises both
[34:24] unto thy seed will i give this land
[34:29] this i this is a part to me that um
[34:33] is i know i'm i'm not rehearsing a great
[34:36] mystery to you but i'm wanting you to
[34:37] ponder this connect it uh let it be
[34:39] settled in your heart this promise that
[34:41] god makes
[34:43] to abraham
[34:44] is the promise of the redemption of what
[34:47] adam lost through the fall
[34:49] when he begins to speak to him and he
[34:51] says unto thy seed will i give this land
[34:54] this promise to abraham is the promise
[34:57] to is connected with the promise to
[34:58] redeem what adam lost and to fulfill
[35:02] what adam failed to fulfill
[35:04] adam was under a commandment adam had a
[35:06] job to do but adam failed to do his job
[35:10] and he lost possession and he lost power
[35:13] and he and he never fulfilled the
[35:14] commandment of god and so now when god
[35:17] begins to speak to abram even though he
[35:19] has no present possession though he has
[35:21] no seed and he does not even have the
[35:22] ability to bring it forth to his wife
[35:24] god promises both and he says unto thy
[35:27] seed will i give this land and that is
[35:29] god promising to fulfill through abraham
[35:32] what adam failed to fulfill
[35:35] and redeeming speaking of redeeming what
[35:37] adam had lost
[35:41] now ponder this aspect of how adam lost
[35:43] it
[35:44] because adam's covenant was broken when
[35:46] the woman pro proposed
[35:49] the fruit of the tree of knowledge of
[35:50] good and evil
[35:52] right
[35:53] it was her suggestion
[35:55] genesis chapter 3 verse 12 after the
[35:57] mistake takes place and what a a
[36:00] innocent way to describe what took place
[36:02] but after the sin and the man said the
[36:05] woman whom thou gave us to be with me
[36:07] she gave me of the tree and i did eat
[36:10] does the bible not tell us that she took
[36:12] the fruit she offers it to adam and he's
[36:15] saying my wife suggested it it was her
[36:17] idea
[36:20] uh this is what she told me to do
[36:22] so adam has got a job to do he's got a
[36:25] promise he's got a possession
[36:26] everything's right there before him all
[36:28] you got to do is wait for god's time and
[36:29] do it according to the will of god and
[36:31] then all of a sudden his wife comes says
[36:32] you know what why don't we do it this
[36:34] way
[36:37] and god even
[36:38] speaks to it in verse 17 of chapter
[36:40] three and unto adam he said because thou
[36:42] hast hearken unto the voice of thy wife
[36:46] so god even is identifying that adam's
[36:49] deviation the bible teaches us that adam
[36:51] is not in the transgression or he's not
[36:53] deceived
[36:54] but the woman being deceived was in
[36:56] transgression so it's through her
[36:57] her deceit and then her suggestion her
[36:59] offering this other way that adam falls
[37:02] and god himself says you've hearkened
[37:05] unto the voice of thy wife
[37:08] and in listening to the voice of his
[37:10] wife
[37:11] he bypasses the promise of god and and
[37:14] and humanity falls
[37:16] and it's the woman it's through it's
[37:18] through eve she's later called eve it's
[37:21] through the woman
[37:22] that sin is brought into the world
[37:25] and the woman
[37:27] gave birth to cain
[37:29] who was wicked
[37:32] the bible even says in first john 3 12
[37:34] not as cain who was of that wicked one
[37:37] and slew his brother
[37:39] he's the murderer from the beginning
[37:42] so this child that is born of the woman
[37:44] through her her deception
[37:46] it produces this wicked cane very
[37:48] murderous and combative and unwilling to
[37:51] humble himself unwilling to listen very
[37:52] difficult to get along with this is this
[37:55] is the cane that is born of the woman at
[37:57] the time of this fall and this deception
[37:58] and the woman brings adam into to
[38:01] participate into the sin through her
[38:03] suggestion
[38:04] you've hearkened unto the voice of thy
[38:06] wife now i'm not expanding beyond just
[38:08] those details we understand that there's
[38:10] something being portrayed in adam's
[38:12] willingness to step out for his wife but
[38:15] notice that in the beginning
[38:17] is the woman that suggests to adam
[38:19] another way and it bypasses the promise
[38:22] of god and it voids the covenant
[38:26] and they never fulfill genesis 1 28
[38:30] then notice what happens in genesis
[38:31] chapter 16. because i mentioned there
[38:33] was some similarities
[38:34] in genesis chapter 16 verses one and two
[38:37] now sarah abram's wife bear him no
[38:39] children we keep getting reminded of
[38:41] this and i'm sure sarah appreciated it
[38:43] and she had a handmaid an egyptian
[38:46] whose name was hagar
[38:48] and sarah said unto abram behold now the
[38:51] lord hath restrained me from bearing i
[38:53] pray thee go in unto my maid
[38:56] it may be that i may obtain children by
[38:59] her
[39:00] and abram hearkened to the voice of
[39:03] sarah
[39:05] just as adam had hearkened to the voice
[39:07] of his wife
[39:09] and voided the covenant
[39:11] now abram listens to the voice of his
[39:14] wife
[39:15] and has a child
[39:17] of his wife's servant her handmaid hagar
[39:21] and notice what it produces in verse 12
[39:24] and he will be a wild man
[39:27] his hand will be against every man and
[39:29] every man's hand against him and he
[39:30] shall dwell in the presence of all his
[39:32] brother he's going to be right there in
[39:34] the middle of all his brains he's going
[39:34] to dwell right in the thick of it right
[39:36] in the middle east right there around
[39:37] everyone it's going to be difficult to
[39:39] get along with he's going to be
[39:40] cantankerous his hand is going to be
[39:41] against every thing every man and every
[39:44] man's hand against him
[39:48] and so when abraham listened to his wife
[39:51] it brought forth a wild man against
[39:52] everything against every man
[39:56] just like when
[39:58] eve was deceived and it brought forth
[40:00] cain this wild child adam hearkening to
[40:02] the voice of his wife nullified the
[40:04] covenant
[40:06] and brother bannon says this
[40:08] and the seed does not air with the shock
[40:11] he said god promised abraham through
[40:13] sarah to have this child
[40:16] but now watch
[40:17] the first seat of abraham by the
[40:19] bondswoman come by sarah doubting that
[40:22] this could happen
[40:23] because she was old and past the age of
[40:25] bearing now that's how the church starts
[40:29] that's how it always starts
[40:32] interesting isn't it
[40:34] you start from the bottom you don't
[40:36] start from the top i appreciate humble
[40:39] beginnings
[40:41] he says a man trying to come climb a
[40:42] ladder he tries to get on top first
[40:44] he'll break his neck
[40:47] you ever heard the saying easy tiger
[40:50] slow down a little bit stay humble stay
[40:52] low you know take it easy he says you've
[40:54] got to start and build up to that what
[40:56] beautiful principles are being expressed
[40:58] if something begins watch the start of
[41:00] it how strong does it come on how uh uh
[41:02] brash or flamboyant and how how great
[41:05] are you trying to be you got to start
[41:07] and build up to that and then he says
[41:09] and here we find the beginning of the
[41:11] promise of god being made manifest
[41:14] through a slightly doubted
[41:16] interrupted program of god
[41:20] so notice the beginning of the promise
[41:21] of god being made manifest he's talking
[41:23] about abraham abraham is the beginning
[41:25] of the promise of god being made
[41:27] manifest not adam anymore
[41:30] not noah
[41:32] but adam abraham is the beginning of the
[41:34] promise of god being made manifest and
[41:36] how does it begin where does it start
[41:37] saying through a slightly doubted
[41:39] interrupted program of god this is in
[41:41] the beginning he says that's the same
[41:43] way sin began in the garden of eden
[41:46] so he's making this connection of sarah
[41:49] slightly doubting the promise and
[41:51] through her slight doubting makes the
[41:53] suggestion to uh to abraham and it's
[41:56] through her suggestion maybe we should
[41:58] just do this that causes abraham to
[42:01] deviate from what the promise of god was
[42:03] what the protection would be what the
[42:05] provision be would be what the course
[42:07] was you know i said this is what god
[42:08] wants me to do this is thus saith the
[42:09] lord this is what this is where i'm
[42:11] placed and this is what god wants to do
[42:13] through me he's going to do it but all
[42:14] it took was for his wife said well maybe
[42:16] it could be through hagar and he
[42:17] deviates slightly doubting the promise
[42:22] and the parallel to adam is so
[42:24] remarkable
[42:26] but it's not the parallel that's so
[42:27] remarkable
[42:29] it's the contrast that's even more
[42:31] remarkable
[42:33] when adam doubted
[42:35] when adam sinned the whole thing was
[42:37] voided
[42:39] but the mystery of abraham's faith is
[42:41] that the promise slightly doubted can't
[42:43] stop the promise
[42:46] the promise lightly doubted does not
[42:48] nullify the covenant
[42:49] abrahams could not abraham's covenant
[42:52] could not be broken when his wife
[42:54] proposed the wrong womb and he made the
[42:56] mistake and produced a wild child god
[42:58] doesn't say that's it i'm starting over
[43:01] is there another name that starts with a
[43:06] he doesn't stop he doesn't start over
[43:08] but abraham's covenant could not be
[43:10] voided even though he slightly doubted
[43:12] the promise even though it was
[43:14] interrupted the program of god the same
[43:16] way that sin entered the garden of eden
[43:19] here now god is saying even though the
[43:21] same sin manifests in abram's story it
[43:25] does not void the covenant
[43:30] adam is never given an opportunity to
[43:31] fulfill his commandment
[43:33] here's the commandment be fruitful
[43:34] multiply replenish the earth
[43:37] just doubt the promise god says never
[43:38] mind it's not yours
[43:41] can't have it
[43:42] he doesn't even give him a chance to
[43:43] restore the covenant
[43:46] sorry adam but if you'll go sacrifice
[43:48] this and do that he doesn't say you know
[43:49] what because you've sinned the
[43:51] judgment's going to pass upon your son
[43:53] and he's going to die and then that's
[43:55] going to get you back into eden no
[43:58] even though that son did die
[44:00] and was murdered is it foreshadowing a
[44:01] pre-figure of christ
[44:03] and you see these things just begin to
[44:05] accumulate type after type after type
[44:06] but that didn't open it back up to him
[44:09] it's like one mistake and it's all over
[44:11] yep that's exactly what god said
[44:13] blessing blessing blessing with the
[44:14] warning this is a conditional covenant
[44:18] but though abram sinned in a similar
[44:20] manner
[44:31] at the time of the fall just think about
[44:32] what the recourse was to adam
[44:36] as soon as adam makes his mistake
[44:40] and i say as soon as the warning was the
[44:42] day you eat that day you die so there's
[44:44] consequence that immediately begins to
[44:46] set in
[44:47] and everything gets
[44:48] revised um i think we could speculate as
[44:51] to what their understanding was of that
[44:53] i don't know if it was like hey if i'm
[44:54] gonna die at least i'm gonna die in eden
[44:56] or in the garden of eden and then all of
[44:58] a sudden it's like no i'm taking that
[44:59] away too he's like what
[45:01] you know i can't live in this beautiful
[45:02] hospice no i mean it was like everything
[45:04] was gone
[45:06] and so the time of the fall because this
[45:08] promise slightly doubted and adam
[45:11] transgressing with his wife adam is
[45:13] driven out of the garden of eden he
[45:15] loses his possession
[45:17] he loses the promises
[45:19] he loses his fellowship with god he
[45:21] loses everything that was his it's like
[45:24] just like that almost it's like i placed
[45:27] you per in a perfect eden now i'm taking
[45:29] you out of perfection death sorrow
[45:32] labor conflict everything changes that
[45:36] that lion that you used to get along
[45:37] with now he could be you could be prayed
[45:39] to him uh the ground that used to
[45:41] cooperate with you now you're gonna
[45:42] fight with it all these things
[45:44] everything changes and what it says and
[45:47] notice how it says in genesis chapter 3
[45:48] verses 22 to 24
[45:51] and this is this judgment this final uh
[45:53] slamming the door on adam as he loses
[45:55] this land and the lord god said behold
[45:58] the man has become as one of us
[46:00] it reminded me of what god says in
[46:02] genesis 11 behold
[46:03] man is one
[46:06] and nothing is restrained the the the
[46:08] they is one this is the people is one in
[46:11] genesis 11 it says now man has become as
[46:13] one of us to know good and evil and now
[46:16] lest he put forth his hand and take also
[46:18] of the tree of life and eat and live
[46:20] forever
[46:21] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[46:24] from the garden of eden
[46:26] to till the ground from whence he was
[46:27] taken he's driven out of the garden of
[46:29] eden
[46:30] and he's now going to till the ground
[46:32] that he was taken out of
[46:34] so he drove out the man with him the
[46:36] woman
[46:37] and placed at the east of the garden of
[46:40] eden cherubims
[46:41] and the flaming sword which turned every
[46:44] way to keep the way of the tree of life
[46:48] this is
[46:49] this is the judgment the final climactic
[46:53] judgment
[46:56] on adam
[46:57] he's he's living in paradise
[47:00] in communion with god the place of god's
[47:02] presence and here
[47:03] and his comes down and he walks with
[47:06] adam and there's this communion and
[47:08] fellowship and there's this harmony and
[47:10] everything is perfect but now with sin
[47:12] he says he's sent out of the garden of
[47:14] eden
[47:15] and then god places once his journal
[47:18] he's placed at the east of the garden of
[47:19] eden cherubim
[47:21] and these place terms they're guardians
[47:23] of god's dwelling place
[47:25] what does god say in exodus that out
[47:27] that's where i'll meet you between the
[47:28] cherubim
[47:30] and so there's this image that the
[47:31] cherubim they're the ones that guard the
[47:33] dwelling place of god
[47:36] adam is being kicked out of the paradise
[47:38] of god
[47:39] he's being ushered out of this it would
[47:41] be even described maybe as a city not in
[47:43] a civilization like cain would build but
[47:45] it was this inhabitation this dwelling
[47:47] place even the language that i find
[47:49] myself kind of venturing into where i
[47:50] want to be wednesday night but even the
[47:52] language that's used as god gives
[47:54] warning is that it had the same image of
[47:56] a city that's wakeful and watchful to
[47:58] protect and to keep and to guard and
[48:00] subdue and have dominion he was in a
[48:03] city of god he was lit dwelling in a
[48:05] dwelling place with god inhabiting a
[48:07] paradise and when god drives them out
[48:09] and places these cherubs it's denoting
[48:11] that what abraham has been driven away
[48:13] from is this dwelling place of god's
[48:15] presence
[48:16] even such to when cain goes away he goes
[48:19] away from the presence of the lord he's
[48:21] running further away from that place
[48:24] that represented the garden where god
[48:26] dwelt with adam and the woman
[48:29] and it's therein that paradise is lost
[48:33] but even though
[48:35] let me say this i want to read it in a
[48:37] moment but even though adam is
[48:39] pushed out of the garden of eden
[48:41] before the door is shut
[48:43] he prophesies
[48:46] so there's another promise that is given
[48:47] at the time
[48:48] that this judgment is being struck
[48:52] now when god calls and so maybe i'll
[48:54] just repeat it here before i read the
[48:55] scripture when god calls abraham
[48:57] in genesis chapter 12
[49:00] it's connected with the promise
[49:02] and it's connected with the seed
[49:05] because even though adam is the door is
[49:07] being shut on adam and his covenant is
[49:09] gone
[49:11] his power is gone the promise has gone
[49:13] his communion is gone the fellowship is
[49:14] gone and there's no you know
[49:17] key code that he can use to get back in
[49:20] there's only one way back in and it's
[49:22] through genesis 3 15.
[49:24] and when i say back in it's not so much
[49:26] a way back into that eden
[49:29] a way to fulfill what god desired to
[49:32] have what god envisioned and
[49:33] foreshadowed in the garden of eden is
[49:36] genesis 3 15.
[49:38] and in genesis 3 15 he says and i will
[49:40] put now is he
[49:41] so beautiful that as he curses the
[49:43] serpent he's giving blessing to the seed
[49:46] his seed
[49:47] and i'll put enmity between thee and the
[49:49] woman
[49:50] and between thy seed and her seed it
[49:52] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[49:54] bruise his heel
[49:56] this is then we gather from this
[49:59] the seed of the woman
[50:01] we understand this to be the first
[50:03] gospel the first sermon this is the the
[50:05] first announcement and proclamation of
[50:07] jesus christ it says i will put enmity
[50:10] between thy seed and the seed of the
[50:12] woman and christ is the seed of the
[50:14] woman so as the adam covenant is being
[50:17] closed and that adam covenant is gone
[50:20] and that eden is gone he prophesies the
[50:23] second adam and he's sowing the seeds of
[50:26] another endemic covenant or eden
[50:28] covenant but not necessarily that one
[50:30] that adam had but another one
[50:36] brother branham says this
[50:37] i don't believe i provided the statement
[50:39] uh in in the church age but because it's
[50:41] just a principle i wanted to read but
[50:42] the man says in the garden of eden when
[50:44] he promised the seed to the woman
[50:47] and then later designated that seed had
[50:49] to come through abraham
[50:51] so notice how brother branham is
[50:52] connecting this there's the seed of the
[50:55] woman and then he designates that seed
[50:58] to come through abraham so he gave the
[51:01] prophecy that prophecy doesn't move
[51:04] until god calls abraham and that
[51:07] prophecy is now attached to abram
[51:10] and this prophecy is now upon him
[51:13] influencing him and if i could say it
[51:15] this way he is under the protection and
[51:18] the provision of that promise
[51:21] god has now designated genesis 3 15 to
[51:25] abraham oh if there was any way that he
[51:27] could get that revelation that i am the
[51:29] carrier i am the conduit and i am the
[51:32] embodiment of genesis 3 15 he would have
[51:34] known that no devil out of hell could
[51:36] have ever stopped him
[51:42] in genesis chapter 3 the promise is
[51:44] given
[51:46] and then adam is driven out of the
[51:47] garden of eden think about that adam
[51:50] who's full of promise full of potential
[51:53] full of possibility
[51:54] all that is stripped away from him
[51:57] and then god speaks of promise as adam
[52:00] is walking out
[52:01] of the garden
[52:07] and driven
[52:09] by these flaming swords out of the
[52:11] garden
[52:12] but then in genesis chapter 12
[52:15] abraham who had nothing
[52:18] is given a promise
[52:20] and now just as adam was driven out
[52:24] he's driven out this promise has given
[52:26] and he's driven out of eden and he's
[52:28] driven away from the promise he's driven
[52:30] away from the possibility he's driven
[52:32] away from the potential when you begin
[52:34] to look at
[52:36] abram's beginning in ur from that moment
[52:38] you look at it the opposite just as adam
[52:41] is driven out and away adam is being
[52:44] driven to abraham is being driven too
[52:48] adam was kicked out of the land he was
[52:50] driven away from that land but with
[52:52] abraham he is he is under its influence
[52:56] adam was driven away from the garden he
[52:58] was kicked out of the paradise of god
[53:00] abraham comes under a burden and he's
[53:01] seeking it
[53:03] having never seen it he's under its
[53:05] influence the hit the city that abraham
[53:07] sought was the hidden place that adam
[53:09] was driven away from
[53:13] and he's under its influence
[53:15] he has nothing he has no power he has no
[53:17] potential but he has a promise and that
[53:19] drives him but here's adam who loses
[53:22] everything and he's driven away from it
[53:24] now abraham's going back
[53:31] well let me say this way
[53:34] not back forward
[53:38] it's it's it's back in type it's back in
[53:40] analogy it's back in image
[53:44] but now
[53:46] the city that abraham is seeking
[53:52] is this hidden place that adam has
[53:53] driven away from
[53:55] he goes forward not backwards
[53:59] and this is a thought that is
[54:00] interesting to ponder on a number of
[54:02] levels but abraham is between two edens
[54:06] he's between the garden of
[54:08] eden in satan's eden
[54:12] before another eden
[54:15] because you know there's an eden restore
[54:16] there's a new there's a new eden
[54:19] the garden of god
[54:21] paradise lost
[54:23] now he's in satan's eden but he's
[54:25] between these two edens of god
[54:29] and he's seeking a paradise restored
[54:32] and that one's greater than the one that
[54:34] was lost
[54:36] right
[54:36] would you agree the one that could can't
[54:38] end
[54:39] would be greater than the one that did
[54:40] end
[54:42] it's a greater glory
[54:45] and then notice what it says in
[54:46] revelations 21 2 and 3. we read to verse
[54:48] 2 verses 1 and 2 last sunday and i john
[54:51] saw the holy city new jerusalem coming
[54:53] down from god out of heaven remember
[54:54] this is the city that abraham sought
[54:57] when he when he this genesis 3 15 is
[54:59] designated to him
[55:02] this is the city he begins to seek
[55:04] prepared as a bride adorned for a
[55:05] husband and heard a great voice out of
[55:07] heaven saying behold notice his part
[55:09] behold the tabernacle of god is with men
[55:12] and he will dwell with them this is what
[55:14] those cherubims represented that they
[55:15] were guarding the way to the tree of
[55:17] life guarding the way to christ guarding
[55:18] the way to the presence of god the place
[55:20] where god dwelt and he will dwell with
[55:22] him and they shall be his people and god
[55:24] himself shall be with him and be their
[55:26] god notice the language that's spoken in
[55:28] the end revelation 21 this great city
[55:31] that follows the image of the mystery
[55:33] babylon that john was just in awe of the
[55:36] mystery babylon the great harlot this
[55:38] that city and all of its amenities
[55:40] but then its filth and its destruction
[55:41] its disease now the contrast now is the
[55:44] glory now that's the beauty the new
[55:46] jerusalem
[55:49] that's the city that abraham sought
[55:52] and the language is that god will be
[55:54] with them and he will be their god
[55:59] what is this is the this is the garden
[56:01] of god this is the new jerusalem it says
[56:03] in revelations 2 7 the tree of life
[56:06] is in the midst of the paradise
[56:08] of god
[56:10] what were those cherubims doing in in
[56:12] genesis chapter 3
[56:14] guarding the way
[56:16] of the tree of life
[56:19] but then it's given this promise is
[56:20] given a revelation the tree of life
[56:22] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[56:24] god this is a new paradise this is the
[56:26] paradise restored this is the paradise
[56:28] that abraham was seeking
[56:31] so now if we could take a step back
[56:34] just for a moment i'm literally taking a
[56:36] step back for a moment
[56:37] and uh
[56:38] it kind of helps me to figuratively take
[56:40] a step back
[56:42] and
[56:43] the
[56:45] atom
[56:46] at the suggestion of his wife sins
[56:48] and through her sin and his following
[56:50] her the covenant is void nullified
[56:53] possession promised gone
[56:56] kicked out of the garden of eden
[56:58] now abraham
[57:00] is called with no possession no and no
[57:02] power but is given a promise
[57:05] unto thy seed will i give this land
[57:08] but then abraham through the slightly
[57:10] doubting of his wife and through her
[57:12] suggestion
[57:14] acts in genesis chapter 16 and brings
[57:17] forth a wild child brings forth a child
[57:19] that is not the heir
[57:21] and god says hey this guy is going to be
[57:23] this nation is going to be crazy and you
[57:24] have to deal with them all the days of
[57:25] your life
[57:27] the next chapter genesis chapter 17.
[57:29] notice what god says
[57:31] this is immediately after the promise
[57:32] slightly doubted immediately after the
[57:34] image of sin in the garden is
[57:36] resurrected in god's own language as
[57:38] adam you hearken to the voice of your
[57:40] wife and now in the story of written of
[57:42] abraham abraham hearken to the voice of
[57:44] his wife the the the uh the image of the
[57:47] sin is so similar that with this is
[57:50] reverberating oh no here's another
[57:51] promise given and another man has made a
[57:54] mistake in the promise in the very same
[57:56] area related to a seed
[57:59] and this is god's response in genesis
[58:01] chapter 17 verse 1 to verse 8 and we
[58:04] read this as a text and when abram was
[58:05] 90 years old years old and 9 the lord
[58:08] appeared to abraham and said
[58:11] you should have never done that with
[58:12] hagar because you did i got to go find
[58:14] somebody else thanks a lot you've ruined
[58:16] my program again
[58:19] what's with you humans
[58:22] i pick at him i give him a promise he
[58:24] breaks and i pick no i give him a
[58:25] promise he breaks it now you
[58:27] you abraham of all people i thought
[58:29] you're going to be the one now you stab
[58:30] me in the back which one of you is next
[58:34] he says i am the almighty god
[58:37] walk before me
[58:39] and be thou perfect
[58:42] i know you made a mistake
[58:44] i know i've told you there's
[58:45] consequences for your actions but i
[58:47] don't want you to doubt for a minute
[58:49] abraham about whether or not my promise
[58:51] still stands if i've led you somewhere
[58:53] i've given you a promise i've shown you
[58:55] my way if i've made a promise i'm not
[58:57] going to take it back it's yours and i'm
[58:59] going to appear to you now because i
[59:00] want to show a pattern to my your seat
[59:02] after you i want to show a pattern to
[59:04] the bride i want to show a pattern to
[59:05] the royal seat of abraham that your
[59:07] mistakes and your slightly doubted
[59:10] cannot void my covenant with you
[59:13] and he's quick to appear again to abram
[59:15] and say walk before me and be thou
[59:18] perfect the takeaway for abram would
[59:19] have been even though i made a mistake i
[59:21] can still be perfect yes you can still
[59:24] be perfect because i am the almighty god
[59:32] and so to remove any doubt whatsoever
[59:35] he says i
[59:37] will make my covenant between me and
[59:39] thee
[59:41] and i i'm saying i because it just
[59:43] follows and i will multiply the
[59:46] exceedingly
[59:48] he's he's taking it out of the realm of
[59:50] abraham abraham i know you just recently
[59:51] listened to your wife and you and by
[59:53] listening to her you slightly down to
[59:55] the promise and you brought forth
[59:56] ishmael and that's going to cause you a
[59:57] lot of problems but i want to remind you
[59:59] i
[1:00:00] will do it
[1:00:02] it's not your wife's suggestion that's
[1:00:04] going to do it it's not you trying to
[1:00:07] cherry pick or find a needle in the
[1:00:08] haystack he said i will do it i will
[1:00:11] make my covenant
[1:00:12] between me and me i will multiply the
[1:00:15] exceedingly and abraham fell on his face
[1:00:17] abram fell on his face
[1:00:19] and god talked with him saying he's not
[1:00:21] going to stop
[1:00:22] he keeps talking to him as for me
[1:00:24] behold my covenant is with thee
[1:00:28] just hear from me and thou shalt be a
[1:00:30] father of many nations no to the length
[1:00:32] notice the language now neither shall
[1:00:34] thy name any more be called abram but
[1:00:35] thy name shall be abraham for a father
[1:00:38] of many nations have i made this
[1:00:39] connects to genesis 12 when he told him
[1:00:41] this is what i would do but now he's
[1:00:42] going to change the name there's got to
[1:00:44] be consequence and i will make the
[1:00:46] exceeding fruitful and i will make
[1:00:49] nations of thee and kings shall come out
[1:00:51] of the notice i will i will i will i
[1:00:55] will i will i will as for me this is my
[1:00:58] promise
[1:00:59] abraham you didn't shake hands with me
[1:01:01] we didn't make a deal you don't have
[1:01:02] some kind of contract with me where
[1:01:04] there's a termination clause this clause
[1:01:07] has no termination this contract has no
[1:01:10] termination clause
[1:01:11] there's no 45 days with written notice
[1:01:14] with cause without cause it cannot be
[1:01:16] voted you know what abraham was stuck
[1:01:18] hallelujah you've been trapped into this
[1:01:21] you're stuck with it
[1:01:24] my goodness i think some of us have
[1:01:26] probably tried to figure a way out of it
[1:01:27] you realize i can't this hits me
[1:01:33] i will make the exceeding fruitful i
[1:01:35] will make nations
[1:01:38] i will establish my covenant between me
[1:01:40] and thee and thy seed after thee in
[1:01:42] their generations for an
[1:01:45] everlasting covenant in other words it's
[1:01:48] a covenant can't be avoided can't be
[1:01:49] broken it's unconditional
[1:01:51] then he says to be a god unto thee
[1:01:53] and that i see after thee notice the
[1:01:55] language he's using now
[1:01:57] and i will give unto thee and to thy
[1:01:59] seed after thee
[1:02:00] the land wherein thou art a stranger
[1:02:03] this land you know not of this land that
[1:02:05] was not yours this land that you don't
[1:02:06] aren't familiar with all the land of
[1:02:08] canaan
[1:02:10] for an everlasting possession eternal
[1:02:12] possession this is where he realized
[1:02:13] that the promise given to abraham was
[1:02:15] eternal
[1:02:16] so what he began to seek is something
[1:02:17] that would never end
[1:02:19] that abraham fully caught the revelation
[1:02:21] of an everlasting covenant and an
[1:02:23] everlasting god it meant a permanence
[1:02:25] that would never end
[1:02:27] and i will be their god
[1:02:30] what is the proclamation
[1:02:32] when the new jerusalem comes down out of
[1:02:34] god from heaven
[1:02:36] the tabernacle of god is with men
[1:02:38] and he will be with him and be
[1:02:41] their
[1:02:42] god
[1:02:44] it's it's repeated
[1:02:46] because it's there
[1:02:49] that the seeds of the new jerusalem
[1:02:52] begin to take hold
[1:02:54] in the life of abraham
[1:02:58] just in this passage here these eight
[1:03:00] verses i want to look back over him here
[1:03:01] for a moment and pull some things out i
[1:03:02] was going to do it as we went through it
[1:03:04] but let me just look back over and pull
[1:03:05] some of these things out
[1:03:07] he in this in this passage he says
[1:03:08] neither shall thy name anymore be called
[1:03:11] abram but thy name shall be abraham
[1:03:14] in genesis chapter one to four adam it
[1:03:17] means man or mankind in some ways adam's
[1:03:19] not even given a name
[1:03:21] he's just man
[1:03:23] humankind it comes from a root of ruddy
[1:03:25] and kind of red and we kind of maybe
[1:03:26] more speak to just something descriptive
[1:03:28] but we know he is the first man he's man
[1:03:31] mankind
[1:03:32] and then the woman which came out of man
[1:03:36] she's the only one that gets named but
[1:03:38] not by adam after the fall
[1:03:42] and she is given the name of eve
[1:03:45] and what does that mean
[1:03:47] mother of all living
[1:03:50] but adam never has another name even not
[1:03:52] after the fall he's not given another
[1:03:53] name he's never called the father of all
[1:03:57] he's not given another appellation
[1:03:59] another designation he is just merely
[1:04:00] described but what he represent in the
[1:04:02] beginning this is humanity this is
[1:04:03] humankind this is where god is starting
[1:04:05] but after the fall the woman she becomes
[1:04:08] the mother of all living we understand
[1:04:10] that because we realize that the
[1:04:11] children she brings forth are not all
[1:04:13] entirely atoms
[1:04:16] but now in the story of abram we were
[1:04:18] introduced to him in genesis chapter 11
[1:04:20] as it's more pronounced and we realize
[1:04:22] what's happening when he leaves er the
[1:04:23] chaldees that abram means exalted father
[1:04:28] comes from ab which is head
[1:04:30] founder or father and room
[1:04:32] which means to rise up or exalted abram
[1:04:35] it would be the head father a right to
[1:04:37] rise up be an exalted father but now
[1:04:40] when god is going to
[1:04:42] catch abram after the promise is
[1:04:44] slightly doubted in genesis 17 wants to
[1:04:46] appear again to confirm his presence
[1:04:48] with him and unfold the promise even in
[1:04:50] a greater way and just reaffirm this is
[1:04:53] my covenant my covenant might come
[1:04:54] everlasting everlasting never going to
[1:04:56] end never going to end i will do this i
[1:04:58] will do this i will do this i will do
[1:04:59] this in great contrast
[1:05:02] to what he did in the first covenant
[1:05:04] he changes his name
[1:05:07] he changed his name from abram to
[1:05:08] abraham which is father of a great or
[1:05:11] numerous multitude
[1:05:14] and there's a lot of a lot of ways that
[1:05:16] we look at this
[1:05:18] how that god takes abram and he kind of
[1:05:21] divides it
[1:05:22] and he puts this h in there and we could
[1:05:24] say that this represents god and to the
[1:05:26] jews he took h which is a part of his
[1:05:28] name it's yahweh he's put it in there
[1:05:30] and it's inserted so it's god dividing
[1:05:33] abraham and putting himself in there
[1:05:34] beautiful image beautiful type that's
[1:05:36] been expressed there and there's other
[1:05:38] ways that people look at the root of
[1:05:40] raheem and different ways they try to
[1:05:41] see how that this was an actual name
[1:05:44] change and it is it's from exalted
[1:05:46] father but now it would be exalted
[1:05:48] father of many or numerous the father of
[1:05:50] many nations as god gives it the meaning
[1:05:54] because he says i will multiply thy thee
[1:05:56] exceedingly thou shalt be a father of
[1:05:59] many nations and as such i will name
[1:06:01] thee abraham because you're going to be
[1:06:05] a father of many nations i've made the
[1:06:07] father many nations so god is attaching
[1:06:09] the name change to how numerous his seed
[1:06:11] is going to be and when god does that he
[1:06:14] attaches abraham to the first covenant
[1:06:17] of genesis 1 28.
[1:06:19] when he says this and you and i think i
[1:06:22] said you you've got to catch this or
[1:06:23] you're lost that's not what i mean
[1:06:25] but just just i'd recognize what he's
[1:06:27] done here he says i'm going to multiply
[1:06:30] the excellent he's using a very specific
[1:06:31] language and you're going to be a father
[1:06:33] of numerous people
[1:06:35] and so i'm going to change your name
[1:06:38] and he gives them the name abraham
[1:06:41] the father of numerous multitudes
[1:06:44] in genesis 1 28 he told adam to be
[1:06:48] fruitful
[1:06:51] right any time he said
[1:06:53] adam be fruitful
[1:06:56] be a multiplier
[1:06:57] replenish the earth he's told to be
[1:06:59] these things but in genesis 17 6 i will
[1:07:03] make thee exceeding fruitful
[1:07:06] it's the same word the para it's the
[1:07:07] same word be fruitful but adam was
[1:07:09] responsible for being fruitful and as
[1:07:12] soon as he voided the covenant he
[1:07:13] couldn't be fruitful
[1:07:15] but now god is using the same
[1:07:17] commandment and instead of telling abram
[1:07:19] to be fruitful he says i will make the
[1:07:23] exceeding fruitful
[1:07:24] really in reality adam wasn't fruitful
[1:07:26] at all in light of the promise because
[1:07:28] god we are taught that that genesis 128
[1:07:31] was never fulfilled by adam and the
[1:07:33] woman
[1:07:34] but now he says i will make the
[1:07:36] exceeding fruitful and in genesis 17 2
[1:07:38] and i will make my covenant between me
[1:07:41] and thee and will multiply thee
[1:07:43] exceedingly
[1:07:46] adam under genesis 1 28 was to be
[1:07:48] fruitful para which abraham is going to
[1:07:50] be exceeding fruitful but also he was to
[1:07:52] multiply which is
[1:07:54] he was to multiply which is to become
[1:07:56] numerous
[1:07:58] adam
[1:07:59] be fruitful adam multiplier become great
[1:08:03] become numerous so when god changes
[1:08:05] abraham's name from abram to abraham
[1:08:09] because he was going to become the
[1:08:10] father of multiple or numerous
[1:08:12] generations he joins him to genesis 1.
[1:08:16] abraham it takes the
[1:08:18] ba in there and it makes it part of his
[1:08:20] name why adam never was the father of
[1:08:22] that multiplication but abraham you will
[1:08:25] be
[1:08:27] and the name change why the genesis 3 15
[1:08:30] is designated to abram and so that picks
[1:08:33] up and carries with it genesis 1 28 so
[1:08:36] it wasn't right that he be named abram
[1:08:38] anymore he had to become abraham to
[1:08:40] signify the seed is now attached to
[1:08:44] abram and therefore he must be called
[1:08:47] already change his name before the sun
[1:08:50] even comes forth why because i have made
[1:08:53] thee already with an everlasting
[1:08:56] covenant it is not presumptuous to
[1:08:58] change your name from an exalted father
[1:09:00] to the father of numerous
[1:09:03] to multiply
[1:09:06] it's remarkable
[1:09:09] what god is doing and connecting
[1:09:12] that abraham is now connected with
[1:09:13] genesis 3 15 he's connected to genesis 1
[1:09:15] 28 these very profound substantial
[1:09:19] scriptures in genesis 1 to 4
[1:09:22] that sow the seeds of god's program in
[1:09:25] his plan
[1:09:26] now we know that worked out what worked
[1:09:28] out in the garden of eden was exactly
[1:09:29] according to god's plan
[1:09:31] right
[1:09:32] and we know that the man and the woman
[1:09:34] could have brought forth the seed
[1:09:38] they had the promise they had the
[1:09:39] potential
[1:09:40] everything was there
[1:09:42] yet they fell
[1:09:44] working out god's plan
[1:09:48] so in genesis
[1:09:49] 3 genesis 4
[1:09:51] the program of god
[1:09:54] gets lost
[1:09:58] and everything god spoke
[1:10:01] the genesis 128 man doesn't have access
[1:10:03] to that anymore
[1:10:06] the only thing that you have is i
[1:10:08] will bring a seat of a woman
[1:10:12] and that's going to be your promise this
[1:10:13] is going to crush the serpent's work
[1:10:15] it's gonna it's gonna do away with this
[1:10:18] curse
[1:10:20] and this would have been part of the
[1:10:21] consciousness of man as he begins to
[1:10:22] leave the garden and this is why you
[1:10:24] this is why you find satan standing
[1:10:26] ready to do what
[1:10:27] kill the first child of the woman that's
[1:10:30] connected with adam and cain kills abel
[1:10:33] because this is something that who's it
[1:10:35] going to be right who's it going to be
[1:10:37] who's this man
[1:10:39] from satan's agenda and satan's
[1:10:41] perspective who's the one that's going
[1:10:42] to try to crush what i'm trying to do
[1:10:43] here
[1:10:46] and so when the man and the woman fail
[1:10:48] to fulfill that promise it's like that
[1:10:51] that seemingly lost to mankind
[1:10:53] especially through the passage of time
[1:10:54] the judgment of noah's generation
[1:10:57] but now i'm closing with this
[1:11:02] i know that's misleading i'm closing
[1:11:05] generally
[1:11:09] are we not in the closing time of the
[1:11:10] rapture
[1:11:13] i mean do we expect god to end in 30
[1:11:15] minutes
[1:11:16] the rapture neither should you expect a
[1:11:18] preacher
[1:11:20] to do it in 30 minutes when he says
[1:11:21] we're closing
[1:11:23] i was referring to the age
[1:11:28] right
[1:11:32] but now think of it in light of that now
[1:11:35] abraham and sarah because in genesis 17
[1:11:37] changes her name too
[1:11:40] think of how the designation eve with
[1:11:42] the eve eve the mother of all living but
[1:11:44] really we realize how horrible of the
[1:11:47] designation that became
[1:11:51] because then it's through her
[1:11:53] that murder came
[1:11:55] but then god takes the name sarah
[1:11:58] sarah i weeks with i and then changes it
[1:12:01] to sarah with an h again taking the same
[1:12:03] part
[1:12:04] that he gave in abraham he gives to
[1:12:06] sarah so now they're connected in the
[1:12:08] name they're joined together
[1:12:11] this is where sarah becomes a part of
[1:12:13] abraham and she can't be judged in
[1:12:15] genesis 18.
[1:12:17] when she laughs again and slightly here
[1:12:19] goes again
[1:12:20] what did you do in genesis 16 a couple
[1:12:22] chapters later it's a it's an even
[1:12:24] chapter time for sarah to do something
[1:12:25] crazy and starts laughing
[1:12:29] about elohim's promise
[1:12:31] and god can't judge her why he did it in
[1:12:34] 17 he made sarah part of abraham in the
[1:12:36] name change
[1:12:38] and sarah means noble woman
[1:12:41] princess from prison this is noble woman
[1:12:43] and so she has this royalty that's
[1:12:45] attached to her but now it's abraham and
[1:12:47] sarah they are the beginning of the new
[1:12:50] generation to come
[1:12:51] they are the beginning of the new race
[1:12:53] the super race
[1:12:55] say were they that no but god had to
[1:12:57] start somewhere
[1:12:59] and so genesis 3
[1:13:02] my whole buildup has been this because
[1:13:03] this is how god it struck me a couple
[1:13:06] weeks ago this was the image that god
[1:13:08] gave me when i began to look at why did
[1:13:09] now i'm not trying to answer the
[1:13:10] question but this is how i looked at it
[1:13:12] why did god start with abram and his
[1:13:14] wife with a bunch of family and then
[1:13:16] finally narrow it down to it was just
[1:13:18] one man and a wife
[1:13:20] because in genesis chapter three have
[1:13:21] one man and one woman driven from eden
[1:13:24] with no children and no promise
[1:13:29] but genesis chapter 12 the story of
[1:13:30] abraham begins with one man a husband
[1:13:33] one man a wife
[1:13:35] with the promise of the seed
[1:13:38] foreshadowing what in the end it will be
[1:13:40] the husband the seed
[1:13:42] and his bride
[1:13:44] the bride
[1:13:46] so what is it that god is portraying
[1:13:48] when he wants to get abram alone with
[1:13:50] sarah
[1:13:52] he wants to begin to do in them
[1:13:54] what adam and the woman never did do
[1:13:58] eve's name was changed but not adams but
[1:14:00] now in abram and sarai
[1:14:03] the story of abraham starts with abram
[1:14:05] and his wife but there's all these other
[1:14:07] things in the picture so god has to give
[1:14:09] him a promise and the promise is
[1:14:11] a seed and a land
[1:14:14] and he says i'm going to give you both
[1:14:18] now to leave you with uh to give you
[1:14:19] something to ponder
[1:14:21] for wednesday lord we'll get there get
[1:14:23] to this on wednesday
[1:14:25] in genesis chapter 15 verse 18 it says
[1:14:27] in the same day
[1:14:29] the lord god made a covenant with abram
[1:14:32] saying unto thy seed
[1:14:35] have i given this land
[1:14:38] from the river of egypt under the great
[1:14:40] river the river euphrates
[1:14:44] ponder this description
[1:14:47] and the description that moses gave when
[1:14:48] he wrote the book of genesis
[1:14:51] of the land of eden
[1:14:54] and the garden of eden
[1:14:59] when god tells abram
[1:15:02] i'm going to give you this land
[1:15:04] and says from the great river of egypt
[1:15:05] into the uh uh to the river of the
[1:15:07] euphrates he describes a land
[1:15:10] that's entirely encompassed by eden in
[1:15:12] genesis chapter 2.
[1:15:16] and when you see where god called abram
[1:15:18] out of because he said i'm going to give
[1:15:20] you this land all the way up to the
[1:15:22] euphrates river has anybody in the last
[1:15:26] 10 services looked at a map and tried to
[1:15:27] figure out where er was anybody here
[1:15:30] i feel like a failure
[1:15:33] my single desire ministry is to create a
[1:15:35] hunger in you for the word of god so
[1:15:37] hopefully you've been listening to more
[1:15:38] tapes about what brother man preached
[1:15:40] about abraham at the very least who
[1:15:41] cares about the maps right
[1:15:43] hey siri show me a map
[1:15:45] of abraham's journey
[1:15:48] and what will it show you
[1:15:50] show you the river euphrates
[1:15:52] and just to the east of the reeve
[1:15:54] euphrates on
[1:15:55] the other side of the border
[1:15:58] is a city called ur
[1:16:01] just east
[1:16:02] on the other side of the river
[1:16:04] on the border of that land
[1:16:07] and so when god calls abram out of er
[1:16:11] he then follows euphrates but he stays
[1:16:14] on the wrong side
[1:16:17] until he starts journeying into canaan
[1:16:20] and then he crosses that boundary and
[1:16:22] then god tells him in genesis 15 i'm
[1:16:24] going to give you this land from the
[1:16:26] river of egypt all the way to the river
[1:16:28] euphrates and god is revealing to
[1:16:30] abraham that he's granting him this
[1:16:32] portion that would have been in eden
[1:16:36] he showed them to abraham what i'm
[1:16:38] giving to you what is your possession is
[1:16:41] something that adam lost
[1:16:43] and was driven away from
[1:16:45] oh this is a beautiful story of
[1:16:47] redemption that's connected with the
[1:16:49] fall and this is how we can have
[1:16:51] confidence that me and the figure of
[1:16:53] abraham despite my doubtings despite my
[1:16:56] weaknesses despite how long it may take
[1:16:59] one day i'll be on top of mount zion
[1:17:05] but the mike if you'd come
[1:17:09] i want to end with this statement from
[1:17:10] identified masterpiece of
[1:17:14] god says after a man had fallen and
[1:17:17] deliberately opened the door to the
[1:17:19] enemy
[1:17:20] and come in and marred him
[1:17:23] and set death in him
[1:17:26] still god was not willing
[1:17:28] this be defeated
[1:17:31] his purpose his plan his program
[1:17:35] he came down
[1:17:37] and started all over again
[1:17:40] he was going to make that man again
[1:17:45] that's powerful
[1:17:47] that man had fallen
[1:17:50] and he wasn't just gonna take adam and
[1:17:52] patch him back up again
[1:17:55] and just say adam i want you to look
[1:17:56] into my eyes
[1:17:58] follow my finger
[1:18:00] you're getting sleepy
[1:18:02] i'm gonna put you to sleep and take away
[1:18:04] your memories and start all over could
[1:18:06] have done that right can he just erase
[1:18:07] his memory
[1:18:09] i mean he's god couldn't have he flown
[1:18:10] around the world really really fast and
[1:18:12] just reverse time i mean superman can do
[1:18:14] it i mean couldn't god just rewound the
[1:18:16] earth
[1:18:17] and everything just kind of back up and
[1:18:18] boom right here and adam's like hey
[1:18:20] whatever you do there's gonna be a snake
[1:18:21] talk to you today
[1:18:22] don't buy his apples
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:26] and everything be kosher right
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:29] that's not what god does
[1:18:31] he's gonna make that man again
[1:18:34] [Music]
[1:18:36] it's gonna be greater too
[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:41] notice what he says continuing he's
[1:18:42] going to make that man again the very
[1:18:44] next statement he put adam on a covenant
[1:18:46] do this not this this and not that touch
[1:18:48] not handle not taste not you may feel
[1:18:50] like you're under that covenant but
[1:18:52] you're not he says but we find out when
[1:18:55] he started again
[1:18:57] he started with abraham
[1:18:59] amen
[1:19:00] this is where it starts
[1:19:02] this is where it begins when he started
[1:19:04] again he started with abraham that's
[1:19:07] when he started to make that man again
[1:19:08] who's that man it's your savior who's
[1:19:11] that man it's christ
[1:19:12] who's that man it's what you're a part
[1:19:14] of who's that man it's the one you came
[1:19:16] from
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:17] we find out when he started again he
[1:19:19] started with abraham i'm so glad he
[1:19:21] didn't take me from adam
[1:19:23] to still be undercover do this do that
[1:19:25] do this do that but we find out when he
[1:19:27] started again he started with abraham
[1:19:29] and in abraham he started him on an
[1:19:31] unconditional covenant
[1:19:34] a covenant without condition a covenant
[1:19:36] without a termination clause a covenant
[1:19:39] that was everlasting and perpetual a
[1:19:42] covenant which i am a part of as the
[1:19:45] seed of abraham
[1:19:48] oh hallelujah this was the beginning of
[1:19:50] the mystery of god that was hidden by
[1:19:53] the devil's mystery this was the
[1:19:54] beginning of making that man this image
[1:19:58] this idea this thought this will this
[1:20:00] predestination that had been lost in the
[1:20:03] garden this is why the devil was so busy
[1:20:06] with civilization in commanding and
[1:20:08] killing
[1:20:09] and conquering and erecting a tower he
[1:20:12] wanted man to forget the promise
[1:20:15] but in the middle of nations with
[1:20:17] mankind swallowed up by monotheism god
[1:20:20] undercover slips down into earth on just
[1:20:22] the other side of the euphrates and says
[1:20:25] abram follow me
[1:20:27] because right at the beginning of
[1:20:30] babylon
[1:20:32] at the beginning of babylon
[1:20:35] when he's satan's finding now after the
[1:20:37] foot now i've got my i got my race
[1:20:39] hybrid
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:41] there's there's no pure line from hey
[1:20:43] adam here it is it's on earth now my
[1:20:46] kingdom begins in earnest
[1:20:49] and it begins to build it
[1:20:51] and right at the beginning
[1:20:53] right at the end genesis 11 is really
[1:20:55] what genesis 10 11 but then god says
[1:20:57] abram even while i think seth is still
[1:20:59] uh or uh sham is still like abram
[1:21:02] come on let's go
[1:21:05] it was the beginning of the kingdom
[1:21:07] that's gonna topple babylon
[1:21:11] so in his beginning god began his ending
[1:21:15] right in the beginning
[1:21:17] right is this starting i'm going to
[1:21:18] start your ending
[1:21:19] abram come on let's go
[1:21:21] you're ticking time bomb
[1:21:24] and i'm going to begin to i'm going to
[1:21:25] lay charges through thousands of years
[1:21:28] because he begin with abraham with an
[1:21:30] unconditional covenant
[1:21:32] and right
[1:21:33] under the cover of darkness
[1:21:35] when the mystery of god had been lost
[1:21:38] it begins again
[1:21:39] in abraham
[1:21:41] you're the finishing of that mystery
[1:21:44] can we stand together today
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:21:52] brother michael could you maybe prepare
[1:21:54] in just a moment maybe to come and sing
[1:21:56] and lead some worship
[1:21:58] part of my depreciation today is i don't
[1:22:00] know if i'm going to be able to sing a
[1:22:02] little bit
[1:22:04] bower heads in a word of prayer
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:15] i encourage you that if your faith
[1:22:18] [Music]
[1:22:20] if your faith has risen at all
[1:22:23] reach
[1:22:25] reach
[1:22:26] reach for the promise
[1:22:29] believe that it's to you and to your
[1:22:31] children
[1:22:33] wednesday night we were
[1:22:35] focusing on i just i remember wednesday
[1:22:37] night there was
[1:22:38] different situations on my heart and in
[1:22:40] particular just one that was really on
[1:22:42] my heart
[1:22:44] and it kept coming back to me over and
[1:22:46] over again
[1:22:48] [Music]
[1:22:50] and how god calls abram and his wife
[1:22:53] out of babylon and then he has a son
[1:22:56] and when he's time for him to have a
[1:22:58] marriage and get married god
[1:23:00] doesn't send him back into babylon to
[1:23:02] get married but he calls his wife out of
[1:23:04] babylon
[1:23:07] and then when isaac has a son and the
[1:23:09] promise is attached to jacob and it's
[1:23:10] time for jacob to get married he says go
[1:23:13] get another wife out of babylon bring
[1:23:14] her out don't go to babylon but get her
[1:23:16] out of babylon
[1:23:18] bring her back to this land wherein
[1:23:19] we're to dwell in this promise and it
[1:23:21] struck me
[1:23:23] god's going to keep on sending
[1:23:25] messengers into babylon
[1:23:28] until the last one is married to christ
[1:23:32] and abraham's seed
[1:23:34] don't worry
[1:23:36] he's gonna go get him
[1:23:39] why don't we just send a messenger right
[1:23:40] now to wherever they are
[1:23:42] lord i've got children in babylon lord
[1:23:44] i've got children under the darkness of
[1:23:45] laodicea lord there's family members and
[1:23:48] loved ones
[1:23:49] who are out there wondering in babylon
[1:23:51] the lord send a voice
[1:23:54] all but they heard it before they heard
[1:23:56] it before all right well you know what
[1:23:57] laban
[1:23:58] laban saw what god did
[1:24:00] to his sister rebecca it was in the
[1:24:02] family they talked about the message
[1:24:05] they had the gifts presented before him
[1:24:07] god didn't write the family off many
[1:24:09] years later he goes right back again
[1:24:11] says there's more seed from this family
[1:24:13] they got to come home
[1:24:16] let's believe all things are possible
[1:24:18] let's keep on believing
[1:24:21] there's still more chairs to put out
[1:24:22] here
[1:24:24] a few more that could have been filled
[1:24:25] this morning
[1:24:27] let's not stop believing
[1:24:30] claim your promise right now seat of
[1:24:32] abraham it's an everlasting covenant
[1:24:34] it's an everlasting possession this one
[1:24:36] isn't going to end in 2021 what you
[1:24:38] think he called you years ago to stop
[1:24:40] now
[1:24:41] he's a god that doesn't quit
[1:24:43] this is what he declared to abraham when
[1:24:45] just the chapter before he made a
[1:24:47] foolish decision it would seem and
[1:24:49] everything's upended and now what have i
[1:24:51] done i proposed my servant son before
[1:24:53] and god corrected me on that now
[1:24:55] seemingly went ahead again and did
[1:24:56] something and i lied in egypt now i'm
[1:24:57] doing this and like surely three strikes
[1:24:59] you're out right three strikes are out
[1:25:01] and then god comes with his most
[1:25:02] forceful reassurance yet and he never
[1:25:05] tells abraham for him to do anything he
[1:25:07] didn't say hey abraham pick a name any
[1:25:09] name
[1:25:10] he changed it for him
[1:25:13] he didn't tell him hey what did i
[1:25:14] promise you to do if you did this and
[1:25:15] days he just said look as for me i want
[1:25:17] you to know abraham as far as for me i
[1:25:20] know you might be struggling i know you
[1:25:22] might be fearful i know you might be
[1:25:24] wondering how it's going to happen but i
[1:25:25] want you to be assured as for me i meant
[1:25:28] it when i said it as for me my heart
[1:25:30] hasn't changed as for me what i said i
[1:25:33] will do and if you believed it for years
[1:25:35] don't stop believing now the promise is
[1:25:38] lie
[1:25:40] it will happen the word is thus saith
[1:25:43] the lord
[1:25:45] healing deliverance restoration whatever
[1:25:47] it might be
[1:25:51] the breaking of pride it's remarkable
[1:25:54] how that some people can be have such a
[1:25:57] rough exterior
[1:25:58] and so much pride and try to have
[1:26:01] everything put together and make
[1:26:03] themselves seem to be uh seemingly
[1:26:05] spiritual in some ways and
[1:26:08] and want everyone to look to them that
[1:26:09] they got everything put together and
[1:26:11] it's all a friend it's all a facade it's
[1:26:12] all pride but what lurks behind the
[1:26:14] pride is a tremendous shame and reproach
[1:26:16] that they bear in their hearts because
[1:26:18] maybe something they've done that others
[1:26:19] don't know
[1:26:21] and they're afraid just to
[1:26:23] accept what god has done in their lives
[1:26:25] let it go
[1:26:27] real and be free of that and move
[1:26:29] forward and allow a meekness and
[1:26:30] humility to break them down and really
[1:26:32] to be able to be of service
[1:26:35] we try to cover too many of our
[1:26:36] complexes with this facade
[1:26:39] of well i'm well maintained and put
[1:26:40] together and i got everything figured
[1:26:42] out and what can i do to help you
[1:26:45] when really what we need is help with
[1:26:46] our complex
[1:26:48] and the hurt and the transgression
[1:26:50] that lurks inside
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:53] and there's still help
[1:26:55] our gracious heavenly father today as we
[1:26:58] stand in your presence
[1:27:01] there is a hunger in the hearts of the
[1:27:02] people today for redemption
[1:27:05] there's a hunger in their hearts for
[1:27:07] righteousness
[1:27:09] lord i believe that there is a bride in
[1:27:11] the land today that is being driven by a
[1:27:14] promise
[1:27:16] that though it may seem to the natural
[1:27:18] eye that here we are without
[1:27:20] power without promise without potential
[1:27:24] of any of the things that we look to and
[1:27:26] believe in as far as a body change and a
[1:27:28] new heavens and a new earth but yet lord
[1:27:30] we're pregnant with it
[1:27:33] we have received it
[1:27:36] and lord just as the woman went out of
[1:27:38] the garden pregnant
[1:27:40] [Music]
[1:27:42] with evil into babylon lord we are a
[1:27:44] bride that's pregnant with righteousness
[1:27:46] leaving babylon into eden
[1:27:49] even understand that the millennium
[1:27:51] will be the garden of god restored the
[1:27:53] paradise of god on earth restored just
[1:27:55] for a time
[1:27:56] before we go to the new one
[1:27:59] lord what beautiful imagery we have in
[1:28:02] our minds today
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:05] and though we may feel weak and we may
[1:28:06] feel
[1:28:07] down we may feel
[1:28:10] and we keep making mistakes
[1:28:15] lord
[1:28:16] as for you your covenant is sure
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:22] and i believe that it would be
[1:28:23] appropriate today lord if what we did
[1:28:26] is just fell on our face before you
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:29] abraham did that being willing to accept
[1:28:31] whatever you would say next
[1:28:34] be willing to accept whatever
[1:28:35] pronouncement that you would make upon
[1:28:37] him
[1:28:38] may we likewise lord just bow our face
[1:28:41] to the earth and humility to you
[1:28:44] be willing to right now examine
[1:28:46] ourselves by the sunlight examine
[1:28:48] ourselves by the word of god
[1:28:50] to see if there be any
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:52] any influence or way
[1:28:54] that we are taking that deviates from
[1:28:56] the course and plan that you have for
[1:28:58] our lives
[1:28:59] bless us father i pray may you be
[1:29:02] mindful of our needs the needs that
[1:29:04] represented behind hands and lifted
[1:29:06] hearts lord

[1:29:11] restore lord restore
[1:29:14] i ask this in the name of the lord jesus
[1:29:16] christ
[1:29:17] amen
[1:29:18] amen
