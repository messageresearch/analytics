TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Acts chapter 2, start with verse one, read to verse 45. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized. And the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls. And they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers, and fear came upon every soul. And many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. And all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need. Amen. You could take your seats. Continuing on the subject of community and in these first several services on this I'm hoping to kind of express the idea and the burden that I have in using that phrase community and specifically looking at Christ church and a Christian. And so there is a some definite characteristics that we're identifying here. And with the subject of community maybe with just a few things to pick up where we were on Sunday. We're identifying God's purpose for community. We have this innate need as human beings to be a part of um a social network or have some sort of belonging not just in a family but a community at large. Uh we could see even in anthropology and different things where it's necessary to be part of a group even for survival but we're not looking at it from just merely the standpoint of human need uh but rather God's design and why he designed us to be that way. why we have that innate need, how the devil would want to exploit that, but also God's purpose for it and it and how it meets these God's design and God's purpose meets the human need and fulfills also in meeting our human need, it fulfills God's purpose and will. And so we're using that uh these elements Christ, church, and a Christian. Why? Because Christ is the foundation of the Christian community. We are not a Christian community because we're made up of Christians, but rather we're a Christian community because we are founded upon the same foundation. We are a part of his body. We are his church as he refers to it. That scriptural word for community is fellowship. And if we are a part of that community by one spirit, you're baptized into that body of Christ. The purpose of his church or his community is to bring us all as individuals into the unity of the faith in the knowledge of the son of God. And if we look at Christ, the church, his church, and a Christian, those things are unified together in that image of a Christian community. And then we have what the Bible refers to as a church or the church or these local churches as we looked at a number of different ones in the scripture on Sunday. But that local church exists because of the church &gt;&gt; and it aids in the uh equipping and the and building of the individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. individuals belonging to families, having responsibility in families. So, it continues and extends to that. But the local church isn't focused on growing themselves, isn't focused on becoming this behemoth and this mighty machine. And we say when you stand on your feet and you be an invincible army, no, that that applies to the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; But then the local church then has this uh vision that well then we're supporting that invincible army, &gt;&gt; which is made up of individuals who received the revelation of Jesus Christ. Our goal is to equip and to support the growing of individuals into the measure of Jesus Christ. Not that we could somehow as a local church become the fulfillment of that. But we recognize that those who are here part of this body of Christ who are connected around the world with other believers, you are to grow into that image. And I'm drawing heavily from Acts chapter 2 and taking a lot from the book of Acts because I do believe that the the acts of the apostles were the acts of the Holy Spirit in the apostles and whatever they did then uh the same works will do also. And so there's this pattern of that first church uh is the image of even this last church. So we believe in salvation. We believe in divine healing. We believe in signs and wonders. There was no cessation of laying hands on the sick. There was no ceasing of the gifts. We believe in all those things because that's what the Holy Spirit can do through individuals. It says here in verse 41, we'll read through this again and we want to really focus on uh something in particular here. Again, we're identifying God's uh definition, what it takes to be part of his program or his his purpose. Then they that gladly received his word. That that's one of the most outstanding things here. They received the word of God. The word is preached by Peter. They were baptized uh according to Christian baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. And the same day were added unto them about 3,000 souls. The Bible says God adds to his church, not man. And they now it begins to describe something that I would say this isn't just the 24-hour period, but it's kind of this characteristic of this body that was being formed. They continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship. The Greek word there fellowship is speaks of community or this group this commonness and in breaking of bread and in prayers and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together. I think that phrase is uh important. All that were believed were together. There was this togetherness and had all things common. And as we read that we think this is uh this is a beautiful image in the scripture. But then verse 45 kind of just arrest all of us or kind of a cost us because uh if uh if you know if this tree ever puts forth another branch &gt;&gt; right they'll write another book of acts &gt;&gt; so get your deeds ready you know don't put it up on eBay and keep all that money now you got to sell everything you have right it says here in verse 45 and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need. This is uh quite a statement. And it's something I don't know if much of you have many of you have thought about it or even considered what it says here and what that commandment would be and what it looks like today, but it says they had all things common. This word means ordinary or belonging to all. So they kind of owned or used all things jointly, shared by all or shared by many is the idea that is being expressed. They had all things common and in doing so they sold as verse 45 says they sold as much as was necessary to have the means of providing for the needs of everyone. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So if there was as they all they were all together and had all things common as there was a need that could not be met they they sold those needs and they gave of themselves so that everyone's needs were met. And it is it is good to look at this in within context because these are Jews that are receiving the word of God and these are the church at Jerusalem and there was a prophecy that Jesus gave that this city's going to be besieged, this city's going to be destroyed and you're going to be dispossessed. A and so there was a certain urgency about uh that time and the circumstances and there was maybe less of a need to hold a really good plot downtown and have a nice uh condo in the downtown district. They knew eventually there's, you know, they were going to be chased out of that city. And so there is some very specific context to what they might have been reacting to, but they sold what they had, their possessions, and they got money from that and different uh means of exchange so that they could provide for those who didn't have. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So that's what it means. They had all things common. But there's a meaning to this word common. And it kind of just really started to click for me because the the word and I'm wanting to maybe give a little bit of a twist on it later, but this word common is actually translated to unclean, undefiled or unholy. So they had all things unholy. And some of us are like, "Yes, yes." You know that thing you said we can't have, Dad? Right? There's these they had all these things common. But what it means that all things common meant they regarded all things as ordinary. In other words, of things common or things profane or things natural that they regarded them as these are just they're not that important &gt;&gt; that if there's a need within the body if there's a need if there's something there that's worth giving up. This is what Jesus means that you should be willing to forsake lands for the sake of the gospel &gt;&gt; that there was this this attitude towards all the things common to them that well if if I've got to give that up for the sake of the gospel that that's an easy question. I remember that a dear friend of mine about the time I had graduated from graduate school and I had received um some nice pens as gifts and two Mont Blancs and so I was fellowshipping with this pastor and he said he said brother Aaron if if if you had two of uh two motorcycles and and I didn't have any would you and he went through this whole scenario he says what about two pens you know if I if you had two Mont Blancs and your brother didn't have one would you be willing to give that up and he said I was like well hold on now you know I've got two Mont Blancs and so there is this idea of sharing you have something well what does it matter to you &gt;&gt; that's their attitude they had this attitude where it was common is to be willing to part with it as it was needful to supply for the needs of others &gt;&gt; so it wasn't just like well I'm a Christian I'm going to sell everything and now I've got all this all this uh money from selling all my bitcoin now what do I do with this it was they regarded as if there's a need these common things don't matter as much as meeting this need &gt;&gt; and that that's what is being emphas emphasized here and you'll see that it unfolds in chapter 4:es 32-37. I believe it's it's good for us as Christians, as believers to look into the scripture and study it and gain wisdom from the scriptures. Specifically, um this kind of it's a scriptural survey, but I believe the teaching is good for us on these things. Says, "And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul." Notice kind of these characteristics about the church. Neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common. So now in the mouths of two or three witnesses, let everything be established. Acts chapter 2 wasn't just the church feeling really good on that day and just doing one thing. And but now you see that this is a characteristic. And again, nobody thought that what he had w was was so important as to keep it uh and hoard it for themselves, but as it was necessary, it was it was just ordinary to them. Look at it in this sense, as we mentioned on Sunday, that Christ was what they had in common. And we'll maybe be coming to this later. Paul counted everything else as worthless &gt;&gt; for the gospel's sake. &gt;&gt; And for them, they're holding the fulfillment of all these things. and they're saying this is so precious that this is what matters the most and everything else pales in comparison to that. So if we have if we have this glorious revelation that's dawned upon our souls and then there's this need or some burden or circumstance but that would hinder somebody in participating in the gospel or the full benefits of the atonement. Uh if I can help let me know if I can help and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all. And again, it this is kind of amplifies what we read in verse 32. Neither was there any among them that lacked. For as many as were possessors of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the price of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles feet, and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. The uh I'm trusting everyone's familiar here with these scriptures. Very specific, you know, portray this. A lot of times we say, well, in the book of Acts, you know, you know, the the serpents were shaken off of hands into the fire and the sick were healed and the dead were raised and they spoke with tongues and they were slain in the spirit. And there's a lot of things we really like to think about in the book of Acts, but this is written right alongside it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe we could argue that if this isn't happening in your church, it's because you haven't sold all your land. &gt;&gt; You haven't sold all your houses. There was a an attitude towards natural things and natural possessions. It didn't have this preeminence. And so those that had lands or houses sold them as was necessary to distribute to those that had need. And it says, "And Moses, who by apostles were surname Barnabas, which is being interpreted the son of consolation, a Levite and of the country of Cyprus, having land, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet." And so one guy gets called out. This is what he did. He was a he was a of a certain country and a Levite and he had land. He sold it, brought the money, laid it at the apostles feet. It wasn't just one person that did it, but those who had things maybe that the common man didn't have. They didn't just have a plot of land, but they had lands. They had houses. Uh there was a there was this reordering of priorities, &gt;&gt; right? It's like I'm not here just to uh with a rich dad poor dad mentality and I just want to accumulate wealth so I can pass it down to my sons. There was this attitude towards these things. It says look the most important thing is the gospel. The most important thing is being faithful over those things that God had given me. And to the extent that I'm able to bless those that are more unfortunate and support this great cause of getting the gospel out. I I I don't need to be so concerned about investments in natural things. I want to invest in things that are eternal. &gt;&gt; And what I could I could say if we were to just distill this down and maybe separate it from these individual acts of selling land and houses and the collection of money, it does identify some sense of community that was united around something and a responsibility that that they felt towards one another within that. &gt;&gt; Right? It wasn't let's sell everything we have and identify a charity that we could give it to for tax purposes, but rather it was like we have these needs within ourselves and among ourselves and we we look at everything we have as potentially being used for the benefit of somebody else and for the furtherance of the gospel. So there was this sense of being together, this united uh uh this group that's united together and this responsibility they had to one another. And so this act of selling uh their possessions and gaining uh income from that and selling assets or whatever it might be and then distributing it didn't create this precedent of having a commune. Does that name sound familiar to was anybody part of a hippie commune in here? I've got stories. My dad tells stories. There there was a time when kind of this idea of being communal and everyone being together. It's this sense of a commune. And that's what some people draw from this scripture. They had all things common. So it's like sell everything you have. Pull the money together and we'll all live in one place as one community. All possessions are shared. You know, I don't own I don't own a a comb. It's we all own this comb. And that's not my milk. That's your milk. We all together share the same toothbrush. Everything else everything is one another's. A commune by definition is a group of people living together and sharing possessions and responsibilities. &gt;&gt; The idea of a commune is we live together. We have no individual possessions. It's all for the use and benefit of everyone. So, some read these scriptures and interpret it. And there's been some Christian communities that have tried to create a commune. Everyone dresses the same. There's no private ownership, everything. Or it's all owned by the pastor or the cult leader. It's all run by a a group of men. Uh because this is the way that the scriptures did it. But you do not find Paul or any of the other apostles for that matter exhorting the Christian or even the Christian churches to sell all their possessions and live together and share all their possessions. These are very specific things that happen early on in the book of Acts amongst these Jews at Jerusalem. And they're selling their possessions. They're providing for the needs of others. And it doesn't mean that today what we need to do, and this may be come as a relief to some of you if you're wondering where I'm going, that we need to sell houses and lands and possessions. And if you had two Xboxes, you know, wouldn't you sell one and and put the rest into the offering? And if you had two cars, aren't you good enough with one? And it's not that. It's this uh it was something that's being identified about a sense of community and a responsibility to it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The precedent or the example that is set is that there is this necessity of being a part of something and the responsibility you have as being a part of it. Let's survey a number of scriptures then that as if we could I would read all the other scriptures that I could find where Paul is saying sell what you have and distribute it amongst everyone equally. It actually doesn't say that. It says they sold what they had and gave it to people who had need. And maybe there's some kind of leveling up where everyone then finds the same stasis, but rather it's just speaking to these events in Acts chapter 2 and Acts chapter 4, and there's other places we'll read some other time where they're specifically selling things and giving things. But what we can draw from that in the later books of the Bible is that there was this need uh uh there was a responsibility that people had to each other. That's &gt;&gt; right. in Galatians chapter 2:10. And I know I'm just grabbing the the the the principle out of the the middle of larger teaching, but just in the book of Galatians, there's four scriptures we could read. Only they would that we should remember the poor, the same which I also was for to do. It says we should remember the poor, the less fortunate, those that do not have what we have. We should remember the poor. &gt;&gt; This is akin to the attitude that they had early on the church. all were together and all that believed and and they saw needs and they distributed. They took what they had and we realized that assets and income and money are different today. So you may not need to sell a house to give to the needy. You may have resources or income that you can use. And so it says that we should remember the poor. And I believe that as Christians we ought to remember the poor. And it's not just the the common poor, but even though especially those amongst them in chapter 5:13, for brethren, you have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. Right. &gt;&gt; So, as you've been given liberty, as we have liberty, whether it be to exercise your rights within a capitalist economy or to pursue certain priv uh privileges, we don't use that liberty for ourselves, but we by love serve one another. Remember the poor, serve one another. Chapter 6:2, bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. So there is a laden. There is a burdening of others that when you see that you want to assist or aid to the extent that you're able. &gt;&gt; That doesn't that doesn't contradict with when he says bear we must bear our own burden. Every man in this chapter he says must bear their own burdens. But that burden is that which you are tasked with carrying. &gt;&gt; This burden here is that which brings somebody down. And so we have a responsibility that if we are carrying that burden that we are tasked with carrying, then there's a blessing that comes with it. God is providing all your needs. All our sufficiency is in Christ. Then is there someone that has a need, we have this responsibility to bear their burdens. He says, "And fulfill the law of Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember this great principle of love thy neighbor as thyself. Verse 10. And as we there have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men. Someone please do a search for me. I want to know if all men includes liberals. Does it include Democrats? Truly, there's no real men in the Democratic party. So maybe we're safe there. But it says, "Do good unto all men." Was it not that that lawyer's question? Well, who who is my neighbor? Right? Love thy neighbor as thyself. Well, I'm going to determine who my neighbor is, and I don't have any neighbors, right? That's the that's the way that we could describe it. or my neighbor is the one that dresses this way, acts this way, believes this way, and is this way, and has the same last name as me, and gives money to me, and takes care of me. That's my neighbor. But it says, do good unto all men. And if you struggle with that, should we do evil to anyone? No, &gt;&gt; shouldn't. He says, "Do good unto all men, especially," now this narrows down whom to whom we have this direct responsibility to, especially unto them who are of the household of faith, &gt;&gt; this family of God, this community, even this uh this body that would be gathering locally where these believers are coming out of the world, Gentiles coming, Jews coming from all these different walks of life, they're accepting the gospel. There'd be this responsibility to each other and they would identify some a sense of commonality, communion amongst themselves. He says we ought to do good especially to the household of the saints. Romans 12:13 as he goes through these different characteristics he says distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality. There should be a distributing to those needs. We share in the needs of believers. We share in the needs of those of our own church. Our own families should be given to hospitality. 1 Timothy chapter 6 18 that they do good. This is what we ought to be teaching. That they do good. This is something we ought to expect of those in offices. That they do good. This is what we're teaching young men. This is what we teach young women to do good. That they be rich in good works. Ready to distribute. Willing to communicate. &gt;&gt; There should be a willingness to communicate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To distribute. That means ready to give. So could you see where these principles that are being expressed in Galatians and Romans and now in Timothy that when it said that all things they had all things common and so they sold their possessions and distributed them as others had need. It was because they were ready to distribute. It's not compulsory now. It's just saying you should be ready to as there is have need bear one another's burden serve one another in love distribute to the necessity of the saints. And it says willing to communicate. Ready and able to maintain. That word communicate means community and fellowship. &gt;&gt; Ready and willing to maintain that. In Acts 20:35, I showed you I have showed you all things how that so laboring you ought to support the weak. &gt;&gt; Right? And remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." I I love this one because now go try to find that in the Gospels and you say, "Well, he's just making this up." But he says, "You ought to support the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus." How he said it is more. And we believe this. We believe this to be the scripture. I think theological schools might say, "Well, we don't have any reason to believe that Jesus actually said this." So, we kind of cut that out. Maybe it's because they want to keep receiving and not giving. But says it's more blessed to give than to receive. Why does he say this in uh in in uh support of supporting the weak, &gt;&gt; distributing uh those things that are necessary to the necessity of the saints, bearing one another's burdens, you ought to support the weak. And again, this responsibility is first to your own house, the household of faith. It's not identifying some third parties. It doesn't mean we have responsibility to make sure all the homeless in downtown Phoenix have a place to stay. uh that's a kind of a a changing uh uh and this this outward uh uh kind of expression of these principles where it's just in charity alone. It's not that there's something that draws you together, something motivating you, some vision and goal that you have. It's not just to clothe those who don't have clothes. It's not just to house those that don't have housing. It's for the sake of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; In Acts 20:35 is we just read you ought to support the weak. This is again in this context of this axe church. It's more blessed to give than to receive. In Hebrews chapter 13:16, but to do good and to communicate, forget not. We could say it this way. Do not forget to do good. All right, I got that. And do not forget to communicate. And this may make some of us nervous, the introverts nervous, those who have a hard time communicating. But the word actually says do not do not forget to fellowship or have community. &gt;&gt; This is communication as we we're we're tracking this for future services. This uh this this idea and this concept of communication and how important it is to relationships and community. But we ought to forget not to communicate or to fellowship. For with such sacrifices, God is well pleased. The sacrifice of doing good. Why would doing good be a sacrifice? Because you're distributing to necessities, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You're bearing one another's burdens. You're using where you might have excess or you might have abundance and you're distributing that. Where you have time to give, you give time. Where you have certain uh wisdom to give, you give of it. Where you have certain resources, you share that. This is the idea to do good and to fellowship, to have community. This sacrifice, God is pleased with this. And he says, don't forget to do it. &gt;&gt; It's described this way in 1 Corinthians chapter 16:es 1 and two. And we know that we're kind of it feels as if we're kind of peeking into something that we don't know fully. He says, "Now, concerning the collection for the saints, we're going to be taking up a love offering. We're taking up a missions offering. We're we're taking up a special offering for certain needs." He says, "Now concerning this giving of all yourselves for these needs of believers elsewhere, I've given order to the churches of Galatia. Even so do ye. As I have asked the churches in Galatia to take uh uh to gather funds and to gather certain resources for the distribution to saints, I want you to do in Corinth as well. So he says, upon the first day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in store as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. In other words, collect now as God has blessed you, and then when I come, I can take that and distribute it to those who have need of it. Again, there's this principle in scripture. I know that when we taught on total worship in the the principles of Christian giving that we could see in the scriptures that over and over again there's this idea of how we have a responsibility as believers to give not just tithes but also offerings for the needs of the church and then also for the needs of others beyond ourselves. Right. &gt;&gt; This is I'm I'm reading these things to show you that there was a sense of community within Christian churches and a responsibility that Christians had to that church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not to determine who's in it and who's out of it, but this responsibility that one felt to this community. We we're and not to if I I just feel maybe need to clarify myself. We're building off of chapter two and chapter four, how they had all things common and they sold lands and possessions and what they collected they distributed as people had need. We see this teaching carried over not in the command to sell everything but in the command to give as you are able. &gt;&gt; Right? In acts 11 19 to30 I just read through this I think the beginning verses here up to verse 26 or so uh verse 27 describes the Christian community this growing as I have it identified here this growing community of believers and Christians. Now they which were scattered abroad upon the pu persecution that arose about Steven traveled as far as Phoen Cyprus and Antioch preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only. So now they're being scattered because of the persecution. We read some of that on Sunday. And some of them were men of Cyprus and Sirene, which when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians preaching the Lord Jesus. And the Lord was with him. And a great number believed and turned unto the Lord. Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem. So now you have believers in Finis and Cyprus and Antioch. Now Grecians are receiving Jesus Christ in Antioch. Then tidings came to uh the church in Jerusalem, and they sent forth Bonafice that he should go as far as Antioch, who when he came and had seen the grace of God, was glad and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should cleave unto the Lord, for he was a good man and full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith, and as much people were added unto the Lord. Then departed Barnabas to Sarsus, for to seek Saul. And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. This is the dynamics of God raising up believers. They heard the gospel. They believed. They're baptized. The Holy Ghost falls out upon them. Now they're being taught. They're being instructed. They're being established in the gospel. And as they begin to live their life within the community of Antioch, this community, this body is identified as being Christians. And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. So now we see these ministries working within the body. They come from Antioch. And there stood up one of them named Agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dur throughout all the world. So now one is prophesying there's going to be a famine. It says which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. This is the response now to this oncoming famine. We might say, "Well, I'm going to I want to buy all the toilet paper for myself, and I want to buy all the MREs, and I want to get all I want to have my basement stocked full of all the things I need for myself." But it says, "Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief under the brethren which dwelt in Judea." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because of the famine. &gt;&gt; Because maybe they weren't impacted as much as the others, and they had these means. They determined as they were able what was within their ability. They weren't it wasn't compulsory. &gt;&gt; Well, you you you shouldn't be living in a 3,000 foot house. You can downsize and go move in with them and take your money and give it to those in Judea. No, as each one was able according to his ability, they determined in their hearts voluntarily and willingly to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea, which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. What we read here is this response of, and I know I'm using, maybe it just seems to be a buzzword, community, but the Christians, this body of Christ, this sense of belonging together, this united cause. And when they saw a need somewhere else, they supported it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I believe that's what this church has tried to do. And they're giving for certain causes through the years. And how when there's war in Ukraine, there was believers who've given and there's been individuals and churches and families that have been supported through that giving. It's the same thing here that as there was a need there &gt;&gt; and you realize they don't have money for oil, they don't have money for for these certain things in bread. And as we had within our own ability, we give in 2 Corinthians chapter 9 5-10. Therefore, I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they should go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, wherefore you had noticed before that the same might be ready as a mantra of b as a matter of bounty and not as as of covetousness. I just kind of uh fun language there, the bounty. And here he's saying you you made up your offering there. There's been a collection of of things and we could say according to their ability as one had had need to give. you you've made up your offering, your gift beforehand. So, but this I say, he which seweth sparingly shall al shall reap also sparingly, and he which seweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. So, there is in this another sense of a collection for the saints. So, this gathering together is there is needs and making up this giving this collection saying those that give a lot will be blessed a lot and those that give little will be blessed a little. Every man according as he, notice this, as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give. &gt;&gt; This isn't being uh forced. The monitor is taking exception to this. Think of it in this way. As we've mentioned before, in the Old Testament, they had compulsory giving, &gt;&gt; which God said if you don't give, you're cut off. Yeah. &gt;&gt; As we go through the blood and we go through the cross, we come to the New Testament, there being grace and not this law. We see in grace, it says give and you'll be blessed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, as there was something punitive for not giving the Old Testament, there's a blessing that comes when you give in the New Testament because you do it, you're not compel compelled to do it by law, but you're compelled to do it by love. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says, "As you are able, purpose in your heart to give, not grudgingly or of necessity because you have to, for God loveth a cheerful giver." &gt;&gt; I can't remember which writer was it Spurgeon, one of these great writers said, "Cheerful holiness is the most forcable of sermons." &gt;&gt; Why? Because when one is cheerful, when one is happy, when one is free, when one recognizes who they are and their position in Christ, a and they still live a life of godliness and holiness and they're still giving, that is that is a great witness. &gt;&gt; But if we all give because we have to and well, I guess I have to do this and I have to do that. No, God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency. And then notice this phrase again, all things may abound to every good work. And then he begins to quote, as it is written, he hath dispersed abroad. He hath given to the poor. His righteousness remainth forever. This is what God does. He giveth to the poor. Now he that minister seed to the sewer both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a perverting of this of these principles I think within modern Christianity where you want to sew a seed what is it to this ministry and God will bless you. You know you you you sew to this ministry and God will give you a bigger house. You sew to this and God and there and there certainly is a manipulation and perverting of this. But don't let the scarecrows uh turn you into one who doesn't want to give and one who doesn't think you should give and I'm just going to look out for myself. There is a principle that we being a part of something beyond ourselves want to serve beyond ourselves. &gt;&gt; And God says,"I will provide those things that you have need of having all sufficiency in all things. As you give, as you are able, as you purpose in your heart, give not grudgingly, not of necessity, but I'm going to cheerfully give. And I'm going to as I give, it's going to be dispersed to the needs that are h that we have amongst ourselves. And God will bless that. Amen. &gt;&gt; These these are a number of scriptures. We've read some lengthy statements in Acts 11 here in 2 Corinthians 9 and some of these quick hits in Galatians and Timothy in Hebrews. But all these scriptures demonstrate that there is a body of Christ. We could call it a Christian community just to serve our subject matter. And this responsibility that's being taught to those who are a part of it by one spirit. You're baptized into one body. And that as being a part of that body, you have a responsibility to the household of faith. You ought to support the weak. Be ready to distribute, willing to communicate, distribute to the necessity of the saints. Do good unto all men, especially those of the household of faith. Bear ye one another's burdens by love. Serve one another concerning the collection for the saints concerning the distribution as you are able to those in Judea and and giving of this making up of a bounty to distribute to others who have need. All these things are scriptures and teaching to the New Testament church. And it shows that there was a community and that there was a responsibility to it. &gt;&gt; And this community and responsibility begins from something. I say this and I took time to maybe focus on this aspect because then kind of what we're doing is we're saying this is how the community operates or this is how it operated. But you have to you can't back into community. In other words, we can't say well I tell you what, we just seem to be kind of disjointed and we're not all on the same page. So, why don't we just kind of pull all our money together this year a a and simplify and have a lot of garage sales and pull our resources and get our money real tight. And if you have a car that you're not using, sell it. And if you have a vacation property, sell it. If you have a second home in in in Aspen, Colorado, just deed it to the pastor. All you don't need those things. Let's just put them all into one big trust and let's all get on the same page. It doesn't work that way, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You you don't you don't create community by forcing everyone to have everything in common. Right. &gt;&gt; That is cultish. &gt;&gt; That is talk about an interesting word study. Communism &gt;&gt; and its association with community &gt;&gt; and all things common and communion. &gt;&gt; So there is a perversion of this that becomes communism. &gt;&gt; It's godless. &gt;&gt; It's not tied to and connected with the heart of God. to this community, the things I'm preaching, and I know I may be using a a a modern buzzword to some, and it might scare some people off. I don't know. But it there is a body of Christ. There is this this supernatural uh union that takes place with the word of all these individuals. So, you are part of something very very real. Then there's literal churches that are then exist as a result of that. But this this feeling of together, this unity that transpires begins with having a common foundation and a common purpose. &gt;&gt; We don't just look at it and say, "Well, we should be sharing our resources. We should be given our money. You should be doing this. We should have all things in common. We should dress the same. We should talk the same." No. There's a human way of producing that. Right. &gt;&gt; And that's what produces hippie communes &gt;&gt; and Jesus people movements a &gt;&gt; and certain sects that put their uh draw their their teachings from the Bible, but they've turned into uh things that lift up traditions of men, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AND ESPOUSE certain things by legalism. It's got to be this way and you you can't do this and you can't do that and this is wrong and this is wrong. So it creates this fear of anything else outside of that. So you all share out of fear &gt;&gt; and not out of love. &gt;&gt; And that is communism. In Acts chapter 2 verse 44, we've already read this so we could just read it now. It says, "And all that believed were together and had all things in common. Had all things common." What were they? They were believers &gt;&gt; and together first. &gt;&gt; They believed. If you don't believe, that's going to be an interesting dynamic, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Take somebody that doesn't have faith. Take someone that doesn't really believe, but they just want to be part of community. They they just want to be a part of something. And regard we don't all have to believe the same, but we need each other. Right? All we need is love. There you go. Right. And said, "Well, that's all we need to do. Let's just all get on the same page." Right. Michael, row your boat to shore. kumbaya and let's just kind of just we're together because we need togetherness. Well, THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT going to work. &gt;&gt; Cuz after a while, if you're if you're not united in faith, then after a while, it's like, well, I don't think that's right, and he doesn't think that's right. And we have all these different ideas. And then somebody's got a better idea of how we can be together. And what happens? Split. &gt;&gt; And then every so there has to be they believed because they believed that was the most important part. And they were together. That phrase means they had the same kind of per the same purpose. &gt;&gt; Notice what it says in Acts 4:32. This is this precursor to everyone selling everything they had or distributing. And the multitude of of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul. I ought to identify that this happened first before the next part happened. &gt;&gt; So then the emphasis isn't on Come on, brother Elazar. Please, please, you have five fishing rods and this brother doesn't have any. At least you could break one in half and GIVE HIM TWO AND A HALF. That's not THEY'RE NOT COMPELLING. IT'S LIKE THERE IS A TOGETHERNESS. THIS IS WHAT YOU want to promote. This unity of faith. The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul. &gt;&gt; And because of that, there was this product that was produced within themselves and this attitude towards others. Neither said any of them that ought of the thing which he possessed was his own. But they had all things common. They were all willing to forsake &gt;&gt; the common things, the ordinary things, the things that pald in comparison to the grace that they were receiving. &gt;&gt; And we're willing to distribute and willing to give and to support others of like faith who were of one mind and one accord. &gt;&gt; I I can say this. I know God knows human nature. &gt;&gt; He knows how hard it is to forgive. &gt;&gt; And he asked you to forgive. &gt;&gt; Thank God he doesn't ask us to forget. That's why I like to say to forgive is human. To forget is divine. &gt;&gt; God forgive for for doesn't even have any knowledge of your sins. They're cast behind his back. You're justified. But he ask us as humans to forgive. And that means he knows that we can the right way. &gt;&gt; There is a right way to do it. Don't just forget about it a and move on. No. Go forward with and a part of that going forward is by forgiveness. And so he's not asking us to give the wrong way. or just to give for the sake of giving. He's going to teach us the secrets. It is believing being rooted and grounded in faith of one heart and one soul. Philippians chapter 2:es 1 to8. If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit community, that's the togetherness. If any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that you be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Is it canes that has the mantra one love chicken tenders? &gt;&gt; I got some yeps and some last but no amen. So we're safe. Don't want to create a Chick-fil-A canes war here. Fulfill ye my joy that you be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. THIS IS WHAT HE DESIRED FOR THERE TO be is the these things. So how is that going to be uh transpire? There's been some uh meetings I've been asked to minister, some ministers meetings to be a part of. And a lot of times the questions are and some recent ones it's posed is, you know, how do we all get together despite doctrinal differences? And so there's a way that you look at that and you say, "Oh, we want unity." So the goal is unity for all of us to be together and on the same page. Well, that's not what we're trying to do is to create unity. What we want to do is have the same love, &gt;&gt; the same faith, &gt;&gt; have the same heart, the same mind. And what mind is that that we want? He says, "Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory. &gt;&gt; But in loneliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look not every man on his own things. This would be I've got lands. I've got possessions. I've got all these things. But every man also on the things of others. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO IT says uh let look not every man on his own things. It's not saying that don't look on what you have but you would see what you have in view of what others have and you have a better understanding OF WHAT GOD HAS BLESSED YOU with and the means that you have to provide FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE what you have. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Let every man look at his own things. But not just only on his own things alone, but look upon what he has as something that can be distributed to those who don't have what you have. But every man also looks. So he says we we we recognize what we have, but what do others have? Let's be concerned about the burdens of others. &gt;&gt; Every man must bear his own burden, but bear ye one another's burdens. So he says, "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus." I think there's maybe uh have you seen those word graphs where um they can create a chart of words that are mentioned the most in a book or a document and they get bigger and bigger as they uh uh and within the context of the chart based upon the number of times that they're mentioned. I wonder just how many times some of these scriptures just keep getting mentioned over and over again. No matter what subject you cross, &gt;&gt; no matter which way you approach it, it ends up passing through one of these verses. So we they're mentioned a lot. There's a lot of repetition, especially this scripture as of late. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. What was that mindset? &gt;&gt; Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. &gt;&gt; He was not just in the form of a servant, he was a servant. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; This is what Paul is saying. there be any any fellowship. Fulfill my joy, my desire that you be like-minded, same love, of one accord, one mind. And we what does this look like? Not every man is concerned with himself, but he's concerned about others. &gt;&gt; And so, let this mind be in you. What mind? You could say this mind that he's already recited. &gt;&gt; This mind of love, this this mind of togetherness in one accord. Let this mind be in you. in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 10. Now I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and the same judgment. In each one of these instances, the reason why I'm reading these things is we've already read where it says serve one another. Bear you one another's burdens. Distribute to the necessity of the saints. Don't forget to communicate. Don't forget to do good. Take up a collection. Give to those that are in need. And there's a lot of requirements and there's a lot of things we say, well, these are the overt acts of Christians is they give of what they have. And we can emphasize THAT A LOT. GIVE, GIVE, GIVE, GIVE. BUT the real heart of it is there that there be no divisions. &gt;&gt; That you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and the same judgment. As you come into more of the unity of the word of God, as you come more into the unity of the faith, then it's just a natural outflow &gt;&gt; to see needs, to see burdens, to see difficulties, TO SEE TRIALS AND WANT TO HELP out &gt;&gt; and feel a genuine burden. Say, oh my, there's a need. Let me help. &gt;&gt; You realize, oh, I I I've looked upon my own needs and I realize there's this need. So, let me give uh not grudgingly, not of necessity, but I'm able to give cheerfully. I'm happy I can help. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to find out you can help? &gt;&gt; Like, oh, I didn't know they needed that. I didn't even know that was a need. &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 1 verse 27. Again, I'm wanting just to identify in these several scriptures here how they there was a foundation and this uh this growing this cultivation of a spirit of a mindset of a faith. first only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else be absent I may hear of your affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel &gt;&gt; he doesn't just come out the gate and say you guys need to keep giving give your money pay your ti DO THIS DO THAT no he says stand fast in one spirit &gt;&gt; stride together for the faith of the gospel I would much rather that we labor together for the unity of the faith, for the knowledge of the son of God, than to figure out a process whereby we can make sure that everyone's giving enough and that we have enough to do this and that we have programs and we're we're clothing the poor in Uganda and we're building a church in Tanzania and we have all sorts of programs, but yet we're bereft of faith and love and knowledge of God and revelation and we've been able to project all of our inner energies into missions and resources and programs at the sake of what? The real union and togetherness of the BODY OF CHRIST AROUND THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I believe that the word as it's lifted up, as the word is properly taught, it turns us turns us into evangelists for the word. &gt;&gt; It turns us into lovers of others to see souls saved. But you can't make a PROGRAM OUT OF THE RESULT. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE COMMON FOUNDATION FIRST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S BASED UPON STAND FAST IN ONE SPIRIT WITH ONE MIND STRIVE TOGETHER FOR THE FAITH OF THE GOSPEL. NOT NOT JUST THE PROMOTION of it, but the faith of it first. &gt;&gt; This has been working just fine until brother Aiel showed up. I'm just kidding. It's not your fault. He's like, "Oh my god, I'm not sitting on the front row ever again." I don't know why it's doing this. Apologies to the parents of just joking. Rowan usually gets all the beef. Aren't you glad to share it now? community, &gt;&gt; Christ Church and a Christian. &gt;&gt; The Christian is a part of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Serving the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; The mentality isn't, oh, community, what can it do for me? Ask not what your church can do for you. It's this the you're compelled then as a member of this body, not this local church, but the body of Christ to serve the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; And therefore, God knowing that that's going to be a hunger, a thirst within any real believer's heart provides opportunities such as a local church. And we're not the only one locally. &gt;&gt; There's many, many churches that you could be a part of. But it becomes a place where you can serve &gt;&gt; this common goal. But when you look at it in the sense of this the body of Christ and his church and you have Christ the church and a Christian that Christian now is being instructed within this context of local churches to serve and to give. But the way the scriptures lay this out is it shifts the focus away from the local church and church services &gt;&gt; to a deeper purpose of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you read, if we could read all these verses again, &gt;&gt; you could realize that what's being taught here is a life or if I could, if I could put this, a religion, an experience that has heart, &gt;&gt; that has feeling. &gt;&gt; Don't just look on your needs. Look on the needs of others. bear you one another's burdens as you see necessities do good to the HOUSEHOLD OF FAITH. IT'S ACTUALLY ASKING YOU WHEN HE SAYS be of one mind, of one love, of one heart. What is he asking you to do? To feel. &gt;&gt; TO TO HAVE HE SAYS DON'T NOT GRUDGINGLY BUT CHEERFULLY. &gt;&gt; And you find that there's a there's an emphasis now on the way that we think, THE WAY THAT WE FEEL, THE WAY THAT WE ACT. AND IF I COULD SAY it this way, I'm being very deliberate to choose this this wording. Religion without emotion is dead. &gt;&gt; AMEN. RELIGION WITHOUT WITHOUT LIFE IS DEAD. &gt;&gt; WE'RE TAUGHT, BROTHER BRAM SAID, IF IT DOESN'T HAVE LIFE IN IT, BURY IT. &gt;&gt; We should bury it. We if there's no emotion, there's no LIFE IN IT, IT'S DEAD. IT DOES IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING. &gt;&gt; But feeling, emotion, and life are not just displayed in church services. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Feeling, emotion, and life just isn't what we do when we come here. &gt;&gt; We're just dead through the week, then show up ON SUNDAY MORNING. LIFE CHECK. [screaming] AH, I guess I'm alive. &gt;&gt; Monday morning at work, I'm going to cheat. I'm going to rob. I'm going to steal. [laughter] Beat the wife when you get home. WEDNESDAY NIGHT, I'M ALIVE. NO. LIFE, FEELING, EMOTION. Formal religion consists of making everything formal. In other words, it's a duty. It's required by law or for wrong motive. &gt;&gt; See, formal religion is starchy and cold and indifferent and doesn't do anything. Full religion is also by prescription loud &gt;&gt; and busy &gt;&gt; and active. BUT IT'S GOT TO HAVE FEELING in it. &gt;&gt; It's got to have and what feeling? Let this mind be in you. &gt;&gt; This togetherness, this sense of duty and responsibility. Christ did not establish a Christian church for church services &gt;&gt; in church sermons. Right? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, this is a very dangerous ground to to stand on as a preacher, is one who is a laboring as a pastor of a church that I I'm here in Phoenix for the sake of church, MOVED HERE TO START A CHURCH, A PASTOR TO CHURCH." HE SAY, "WELL, Christ didn't come to start a church, a local church. He didn't come for church services and sermons." But yet, that's what we have this responsibilityility for as our family and as church. BUT WE REALIZE THAT there is a need for that, &gt;&gt; right? But that's not the ultimate &gt;&gt; Christianity has been turned into the church &gt;&gt; and has been turned into what this is what it's all about. We need to have good church services. We need to have we need to have church order. We need to we need to have good things working as a church. We have programs as a church. We need to feel a part of the church. And the church all along is just the local one. &gt;&gt; It's the one that exists here. It's the one that has these four walls and this parking lot and this structure and this order. But that's not it. Christ and the New Testament. These different dynamics that rose up, church services and sermons are to SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A Christian service. &gt;&gt; YOUR NOT CHURCH SERVICES, BUT YOUR SERVICE IN YOUR HOME, IN YOUR COMMUNITIES AT LARGE, IN YOUR FAMILIES. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE IS TO SUPPORT YOU IN YOUR CHALLENGE. &gt;&gt; Not so we could all just let's just forsake everything we have and come together and this will become your new family. And then we're just going to cut off our families. &gt;&gt; This is your new family now, brother Elazar. I don't want you to ever have anything to do with anybody in New Mexico again. You never leave the state unless you get my permission. This is your new family now. And we laugh maybe nervously, right? Because we've been a part of situations like that before. &gt;&gt; I don't have any fellowship outside of the church now. It's just all of And that's how you create a forced negative dynamic of being together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. because it's it's all about optics and politics &gt;&gt; and pretenses and not real feeling &gt;&gt; for the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Things that may be out of your control. You don't have a right to decide this. You don't have a right to judge this. But you have a responsibility for the faith of the gospel. &gt;&gt; In James chapter 1, well, let me ask for permission. May I please continue? &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Sure. James 1:es 21-27. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity superfluity of naughtiness. James has bars. That's a good one there. And receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls. This is this is good stuff. Lay apart all filthiness, all this excess of naughtiness. Receive with meekness. There's got to be a receiving of the word of God. All that received the word believed and were baptized, received the word gladly. All that believe were together. Let us receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save completely develop, cultivate, enrich, and nourish your souls. Says, "But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves." For if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he's like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass. I think this could be described as the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to come to my church services and say, "Amen. And that's what we do. We just come and Amen. &gt;&gt; or we come and we respond to the word. We're a maners of the word. We're hearers of the word. But it says you've got to be a doer, not just a hearer. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; For if any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he's like a man beholding his his natural face in a glass. For he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetth what manner of man he was. But who so lookth into the perfect law of liberty? Now notice this perfect law of liberty, like I'm free. where the spirit of the Lord there is liberty. Now we can really be who we're called to be. And notice what he begins to describe and continue there. And he being not a forgetful here, but a doer of the work. This man shall be blessed in his deed. So you're a doer of the work. You're a doer of the word. You're a doer of what you hear. So he says, "If any man among you seem to be religious, embridleth not his tongue, &gt;&gt; but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain, &gt;&gt; empty, lifeless. So religion with emotion, a religion without emotion is dead. But so is a religion that won't control your tongue, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So is a religion that still tends to naughtiness &gt;&gt; and a lack of meekness. So is a religion that tends to arrogance &gt;&gt; and bitterness and mean-spiritedness. &gt;&gt; So is a religion that assassinates other people's character, &gt;&gt; right? So is a religion that allows you to say whatever you want without the fear of God. &gt;&gt; Cannot control his tongue. You deceive your heart. This man's religion is vain. And as he's talking about hearing the word, the engrafted word, being a doer of the word, and being blessed in your deed, he says pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this. &gt;&gt; To shout, to dance, to speak with tongues, to lay hands on the sick, and they recover. And wait, the copy and paste failed me. No, he says to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world. &gt;&gt; That's pure religion. &gt;&gt; No wonder they're losing their religion in the 80s. Pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's pure religion. &gt;&gt; Remember James will go on to explore you. you you say you have faith without works. I'll show you my faith by my works. &gt;&gt; This is where James is going to explore this in great detail and he's going to uncover these different principles. I think I've held some of these things for a later service. But as he's saying these things about a one who uh from the fountain precedes different things and how we act and how we ask and these things that we uh cultivate in our lives and this outflowing of our faith. He says faith without works is dead. And the works HE'S REFERRING TO AREN'T THE KIND OF WORKS that any one of us can uh uh uh that he's not referring to works that we would just merely try to assimilate &gt;&gt; and do easily, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But it's actually works that the Bible says is a sacrifice unto God &gt;&gt; that pleases God. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we read in the scripture, it says God God enjoys, he's pleased with that sacrifice. God loves a cheerful giver. Musicians, if you could come, do good, communicate, for with these sacrifices, God is well pleased. We bring the sacrifice of praise into your house. You can do that. But what about the sacrifice of doing good? &gt;&gt; What about the sacrifice for the sake of the body? What about the giving? Pure religion and undefiled is to visit the fatherless and the widows. What is he referring to? He's talking about a religion that's real. Now, we could create a program where what we do is we visit the fatherless and widows and we have this program where we're just going to go to community centers and we're going to have an outreach in Sun City. We're going to try to find the widows and we're going to serve the widows and we're going to try to find the orphans. We're going to serve the orphans and we can bind up our identity in supporting orphanages and supporting widows and tell ourselves that's religion. &gt;&gt; But James isn't [music] advocating for that. He's talking about receiving the word of God in faith being known by your works and how that a living faith, a real faith has feeling. It has life in it. &gt;&gt; It's animated according to the gospel. It serves others. That is eternal life. &gt;&gt; So many different ways that we could go with this, but I was reading in the sermon, a man running from the presence of the Lord. This is so beautiful. Listen to this. It's a little bit lengthy, but I want you to really just hear [music] this. He says, "We find out that so many have easy ways to go." He's talking about a man running from the presence of the Lord is Jonah. He goes, "Ships going down to Tarsus for it's easy." And he uses the phrase the unresponsibilities. Reminds me of George Bush saying he's the decider. The unresponsibilities. It just flows in. You have everything coming. [music] Everybody likes you. Nobody disagree with you. You disagree with nobody. I'm liking this. Now, if that ain't a dish rag, you push over, flop over. Why? Anybody? I don't care who you are, what you're standing for. Decent thinking people will think more of you if you'll stand for your conviction of what's right. &gt;&gt; So, reading this, in other words, there's a we can just go an easy way, but there's a way [music] that we ought to live our lives that maybe is against the grain. He says, "Take [music] a woman. She might not be very attractive, whatever she is, but you let a woman stand for principles of womanhood. Let her stand like a lady. If a man's got to ounce a man about him, he'll take up for her. We appreciate something that somebody has that they believe it's the truth [music] and will stand for what they think is right. I I feel this way. You see, people make difficult decisions and say, "Well, I don't agree with you, and so I I've got to make this difficult decision." If they do it with respect, you can admire that. &gt;&gt; How wishy-washy. That's what too many Christians today are so soft soaked in everything till they think all they do is join church, go in somewhere and put their name on the book. So there's that kind of what we call formalism, intellectualism, starchy, formal church joiners. It's maybe this uh we we've got it figured, we got the fundamentals figured out. Let's just put those in place and now we're a Christian. He says, OR DO A LITTLE SOMETHING, JUMP UP AND DOWN, SHOUT or something like that and call it Christianity. All right. So now they're all they're all the same thing anyways, right? the the intellectual and the emotional are the same person. &gt;&gt; He said, "Christianity is an everyday rugged life living for God in this present world. It's a constant burning of the fire and love of God in the heart that sets you a fire and puts you out yonder with the people in making converts to Christ." [music] He says, "Responsibilities." Notice that Christianity isn't at every Sunday morning life or a Saturday night of a conference life, but it's an everyday rugged life living for God. Not in church, but in this present world with THE CONSTANT BURNING FIRE, NOT TO RUN PEWS and to shout and to dance or just to join a church, but with THE LOVE OF GOD THAT SETS YOU ON fire amongst people &gt;&gt; so that the WARMTH OF YOUR LIFE COULD CONVERT OTHERS TO CHRIST. [music] He says, "Responsibility." But it's easy to go the way the world goes. It's easy to flow downstream. Go out there and set down the river with your boat, get your oars, and start pulling against the current. You don't make much time. It goes hard. But once you let loose the oars, and watch how fast you pass the trees going down. But look where you're going. [music] When things are floating easy, remember you're going towards a great waterfall, great cataract down there of some sort. You're going toward the falls. and it won't be long you'll go over the falls just floating with the world easy the way it goes. He says you don't want that. You must accept your responsibility. What is your responsibility? It's a good question. But you have a responsibility. [music] You may look at these things and be so convinced of and say, "Well, brother Aaron's made a really strong case that if I'm going to be a Christian, I'm going to have a responsibility beyond myself. I'm gonna have responsibility to the body of Christ. I'm at a responsibility [music] a as as a member of the body of Christ and I don't want that. So I I I'm just going to begin to forsake [music] my responsibility as a Christian. You know, some people do that. &gt;&gt; They protest. And how do they protest? They stop supporting. They they stop [music] they stop being a part of the body of Christ. They stop giving of their resource. And they have a lot of excuses and sometimes a lot of good reasons to do it. It's not that they just came up with it on their own, but they're abused. They're mistreated. They don't like this reflection. They don't like certain things. And so they say, "Well, I don't want to have anything to do with it." But look into the word of God today and recognize you do have a responsibility. It's a responsibility that's not born from being told you have a responsibility, but by being a Christian by by the the truth being preached by, as maybe we'll explore this in more detail, by coming of same mind, by speaking the truth in love, by by feeding on the same word, we're becoming one. We're becoming united. And as that's lifted up, as that's promoted, then the [music] rest begins to take care of itself. You have a responsibility as a Christian. You have a responsibility to Christ and his church. And as a church, we want to we want to give you opportunities to fulfill your responsibility. If we could stand together this evening, let's pray. Our heavenly father, tonight, Lord, as we bow our heads, we're asking [music] for grace, just a uh a grace upon our lives that we could rightly divide the word of truth. Lord, I could just do a search in scripture, not just a word search and but just take time to comb [music] through the pages and just believe that I'm following the leadership of the Holy Spirit to identify these different scriptures that speak of this responsibility that a member of the body of Christ has, a Christian has to Christ [music] church and how it worked out in the book of Acts and how it worked out in the church at [music] Corenth and in Galatia and all these different uh ways that the individual the Christian being a part of Christ's body served the church through the means of a local body through the means of a local gathering and ministries in [music] those local who could receive the the the distributions and make sure they got to the right place and just the giving as they would weekly that would actually [music] support their gathering together and the deacons looking out after certain things. We just see a beautiful picture painted in the scripture. But Lord, I just I don't want to just put these [music] things together in such a way to where we can be convinced. Yeah, I got to look on the needs of others. Yeah, I got to give and I got to do this. I got to do that. But Lord, may we recognize [music] that there was something genuine about the unity, about the togetherness, about the goal, that it was the faith of the gospel, the one faith, the one Lord, the one baptism. That's what they were united around. That's what they desired at the end of the day would be promoted. That's what they desired at the end of the day would receive receive the have the preeminence. So Lord, I'm not trying to turn ourselves around to where we can [music] back into community by doing community service, but Lord, may we become so rooted and grounded in your word that we could recognize our responsibility as Christians to [music] do service. And as a church, may we provide opportunities for those responsibilities to be fulfilled. Encourage and inspire others, maybe to take initiative in certain areas. May we be sensitive to your leading, Lord. We commit ourselves to you in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music]
