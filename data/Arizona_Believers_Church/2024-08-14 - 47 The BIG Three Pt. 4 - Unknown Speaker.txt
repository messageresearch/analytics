TRANSCRIPT
========================================
going to continue on the big three I think I missed a real good opportunity to only have three parts on the big three but we're going to push it a little bit further and keep going as we've tried to make this connection over the last couple services on The Big Three As We introduced it before and we'll touch on it here in a minute uh make that connection with money women and popularity as brother brandham uh brought those things out it admonished ministers about these traps and these things that'll get a minister off the Beaten Track uh We've we've been making this association with the big three and just feel to spend some time on each one maybe not a lot of time but look at the aspects of money women and popularity brother brandham in The Harvest Time talks about the three Temptations of Christ the three Temptations of a minister the three Temptations of the church three Temptations of an organization and he brings it down he says three Temptations of the individual and he says where they make their fall or where they fail so these three Temptations and however you'd want to change the wording or divide it up we know that in 1 John 2:16 it says all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life these things in the world that are not of the father uh because the good things come from God every good and perfect gift comes from God so those things that we see that are lustful that are desirous that are contrary to the word of God Timothy or John just lumps them all into one group and says you can find them in one of these three headings or categories and there's always an overlap there's maybe a VIN diagram that we could do with different circles and find where they all three meet but the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life are something that all of us battle believe even from the youngest to the oldest no matter how old you are in some ways uh you're learning uh what it means to wrestle with the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life John in writing in first John he's saying I write unto you children because your sins are forgiven and he writes under the young men because the word of God abideth in you and you've overcome the wicked one I write unto you adults because uh you've known him from the beginning so there's this continuity of these challenges that we all face to every time of life every season of life and I believe there's a word for everyone there's a word for everyone to encourage them wherever they are Jude verse 11 it says woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the heir of balum forward and perished in the gain saying of Kora I want to just get into our thought we we some pick up a little bit review from Sunday but I just want to get into this these are three different Temptations you could say you have a way you have an error you have a gain say but in describing this these particular group of people and Peter even touches on them in very similar language they have gone in the way of Cain ran greedily after the heir of balum for reward and perished in the gains of Kor we could say that it reads that they've done all three we could also say say if you just did one that's enough we know that in baseball uh one out of three is a Hall of Fame and the same would go for being evil if you got one out of these three you're not doing good so it's the way of Cain Run the heir of balum and the gain Sayan of Kora as we may have opportunity in the future the way of Cain represents the lust of the eye it is satisfying conscience or desire something your eyes sees and you covet after it Genesis 4 4:3 it says and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord I've read a lot of different studies on this and how some commentators look at it and traditionally how some people view it and they look at this and they are immediately uh I don't I guess I wouldn't say defensive of Cain but they see the good in it and they say well this offering uh is not necessarily wrong because you have a meal offering and the word are similar to that which is required in Leviticus and and so what Cain was doing is it seems natural that the first fruits of the ground would be offered just as the same as the first fruits of the flock would be offered and and so he's offering this there's nothing wrong with the offering in itself and and they wrestle uh maybe not wrestle but they just interpret the fact that he worshiped as being that's fine everything okay there was nothing wrong with what he did one particular commentator drilled down on some of the words that are used on the fruit of the ground and offering un the Lord and and suggested that he probably just offered up the least of what he had the leftovers of flax and hemp seeds and uh and that's what he that's what he offered up anymore I guess flax and hemp are some of the most desirable things so uh jokes on you commentator but they say that he was just offering his leftovers but we're informed by the message of the hour that tells us that Cain made a beautiful offering that he looked out after it in such a way to where it would have been pleasing and it would have been uh it would have been a beautiful attractive way of worship and so Cain's offering and I'm just touching on this very quickly and drawing from what brother bam taught which I know you all know very well that Cain's offering was driven by the eye that he was looking at the Optics I want this to look good and whether he was motivated to worship first by Cain uh by Abel's Revelation in seeing that Abel offering so Cain thought I could do better and I can make it look better smell better sound better and be a little bit more visually pleasing whatever it was he was it was pretense and it was Optics that drove him to worship we realize that his worship is a false religion it's even associated with a dead religion or an impersonation and the offering that Cain brought though beautiful failed to please God in Hebrews 11:4 it says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which Abel's offering by faith he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh Abel pleased God by faith not by sight whereas Cain thought that if he could uh visually represent it in a certain way it would be accepted if he thought maybe again the pretense the Optics the way things look and feel the lust of the eyes to maybe even make it pleasing to himself and brother Brandon makes a statement in one place that Cain uh did it the fruit of the ground and he says as he was taught and the garden by his parrots maybe missing the paraphrase a little bit there but He suggests that maybe Cain is offering the fruit of the ground because in the telling of what happened is it was the allegory of a fruit the fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is the reason why we fail and Cain goes right back to fruit fruit of the ground it goes right back to things from the earth that fig Leaf religion the offering of fruit things from the ground that has been cursed and that's what he offers unto God and it was a offering by sight not by revelation of faith that Abel had so it's the way of Cain is that lust of the eye it's something that we could look at our own lives by and examine ourselves to see whether or not we wrestle in these things and woe unto them for they have gone in the perished in the gain saying of of Kora I would associate this with the pride of life this Lust For popularity this desire for status as it says in Numbers chapter 16 veres 1 2 and three now Kora the son of isar the son of kth the son of Levi and Dayan and Abram and the sons of elab and on the son of pth the son of Reuben took men and so now here's the the the gain say of core and they rose up before Moses with Now Catch the language with certain of the children of Israel just weren having anybody go you had to have the right kind of income right the right kind of uh testimony 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation I saw here this week that Famous Amos died uh moment of silence God bless him he's the one that invented the Famous Amos cookies and got his recipe from a family recipe but anyways it's not Famous Amos Famous in the congregation men of renown so this is a pretty Elite group this is premium this is as they might say today premium Ministry that they got together and rallied them to the elite eight they got the greats together and they said we got certain children of Israel princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown and they gathered together to do what gathered themselves together against the prophet against the message of the hour against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation Are Holy every one of them and the Lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord it's called a gain saan of core because it's not true made false accusations and lied and didn't tell the truth about Moses and even the arrangement but at the end of the day if you look at the story of Kora he was just mad that he wasn't doing it they were mad as princes of the congregation and Men of renown and famous that they hadn't been selected among the Levites to serve in the priesthood and felt like they should have a right just like Moses and Aaron and his sons did so it was this Lust For position and in doing so it causes them to gains say against the prophet and they built consensus by having well this is a big name and this is a good guy and this guy's famous and they they use that it's the pride of life to actually come against the word of God now let's take the remainder of our evening together as we have opportunity to look at the eror of balum again I say that the ER of balum is rooted in the lust of the flesh this was that wandering the air the Wonder to be led astray which led to lust lust is excited and then when it's entertained and and someone is enticed then it bringeth forth sin and then let sin finish its course it brings forth death as we used balum as an example on Sunday and we looked at his ministry just those few chapters that tell us about about it on its face it appears as if balum is resisting the bribes of Balo and it looks like balam's doing a really good job because he seems sincere and he's regarded as a prophet and and Balo says there's this group that's come up out of Egypt I need you to help me I need you to curse them because I'm afraid they're too great for me a and and balum goes before the Lord and the Lord says don't go with them and I can't curse them but bam goes back to Bao and says the Lord told me not to go with you and he says hey I'll give you something I'll give you money I'll give you houses I'll give you lands I'll give you things you want and he says well let me just go see what God would say and he already knows what God was going to say but he goes back and the Lord says I tell you what if the princes come back to you and ask you to go go with them but you have to say what I say and in the morning what did Bam do got up didn't even wait for someone to ask went his way and God stopped him and the Bible says that this was iniquity in bam God was rebuking him through speaking through his donkey and we're reading it and you're thinking wait what did I miss and you realize that balum had been showing or at least forecasting that he was wanting to hang close to this opportunity so he didn't completely miss it in case he got a chance at it and so God knew that this was in his heart and when the story finishes it looks like they both just go their ways but in the very next chapter numbers 25 and I'm just reviewing this for you but uh I've got a I got a an to fill there's a uh the next thing we know that the sons of Israel are committing whoredom in fornicating with the daughters of Moab and the Bible then tells us that they did it at the Council of balum Revelation says that it was the doctrine of balam who taught Balo to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel so Revelations 2:14 the doctrine of bam was to teach the adversary teach the enemy how to cast a St stumbling block before the elect to eat things sacrificed unto idols and then to commit fornication so the stumbling block of the lust of the flesh leads to fulfilling the lust of the eyes or the eating the then the fornicating and if I could say this the L cannot be cursed the Born Again cannot be cursed the bride cannot be cursed but Satan so only the only thing Satan can do is tempt her to stumble tempt her to get out of Step Le deene Church age descended into chaos tongues and tinkling and dancing and shouting and all sorts of stuff descending Into Darkness and chaos and the bride dressed holy marching to Onward Christian Soldiers sober uh filled with the Holy Ghost holy but a few of them at the back begin to get their eyes on that wild and crazy blackened out Church going descending into chaos and they got their eyes on it and got out of Step a little bit he came can't keep you from ascending but he can make you get out of Step can't curse you but he can tempt you to stumble the Bible says that these women caused the children of Israel through the Council of balum to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of p peor and the plague was amongst the congregation of Israel because of the congregation of the Lord because of this Council of balum he taught Bao how to get the people of Israel to fall through the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes first through enticing them through sweet meats and offering a discount an opportunity just may seem real simple and real humble that's why the Bible counsels Us in certain situations not to do certain things and to be careful what ground you get on and the word of God is is asking us to use some discernment and wisdom because Satan has a plan he has a scheme of trying to entice us and and what balum does it's really it was nothing new but he dim demonstrate Satan's tactics from the beginning in other words when bam begin to counsel Balo he knew enough and he knew how to get Israel to bring God's Wrath down every time balam opens his mouth Israel's cursed so he realizes I can't curse them but maybe I can cause them to essentially curse themselves bring God's Wrath and judgment cause many to perish and so he knew how to get Israel to stumble in the sermon the contest brother bam says and now the enemy is going to study our strategy with the word so he's watching he's he's using the table app just as much as we are he's listening he's hearing he's he's pulling quotes he's running search strings he's studying these things and now Satan studied that all out so perfectly till when he come to Eve he had the best strategy he could use upon her and that was to reason with God's word now I would like you to think about how that Satan studied temperament Stan Satan studies the individual Satan has been not only studying human nature but designing it a and sewing things into it and laying traps and snares so Satan is an expert on human behavior he's an expert on uh economic behavior he's an expert on hertica and why we act the way that we do and how we make decisions and he's been doing a good job in many ways of programming us for quite some time so Satan studied it out so perfectly till he knew the right kind of strategy to use on the woman that was to cause her to reason with the word and I would argue that balam's approach was not any different that he had studied enough knew enough and had strategized enough to where he would technically not open his mouth to curse Israel but he found a way to get the money from Bao and teach Bao how to cause Israel to stumble because of all the knowledge that he had and I do not believe that anyone needs to necessarily wake up in the morning and choose to put on the balum hat and and sell their soul out out and sell out for money and do this and do that but there is a spirit that is also subtle to the point to where balam actually thought he might have been doing the right thing there's many Jews that postulate and I think it may even be Josephus if I'm wrong please forgive me Josephus who said that Judas believed that Christ was the Messiah thought he saw an opportunity to make a little Gus right because after all he's the Messiah and if they try to come and take him he's going to over throw him and he's going to beat them and they one even says that Judas was doing this as a way to provoke the Messiah to step up into his Royal office to step in and overthrow the oppressors but it was the money at the end of the day that he was after and concerned about and so AB balum isn't necessarily somebody who uh is intentionally trying to destroy God's word but acts by the wrong incentive to cause Believers to stumble or ourselves tempted so he demonstrates Satan's tactic continuing now you never want to reason with God's word just believe it God's word just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out now you cannot figure out God so God is the word and it's just made to believe and that's our strength just accept the word anyone knows that that a seed in the right kind of ground will produce its kind and we just take the word if our strength is to accept the word Delilah wants to change it Delilah would want to add to it she can't cut our hair but if we could take our strength and put pluses on it and mix it and defile it then our strength can be gone so we got to stay with the word of God just take the word Israel stumbled through the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the Eyes by the Council of balum we can say Israel stumbled through the those sweet meats and then delay with these women and the fornication we can say the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes but on balam's part his weakness was money 2 Peter 2:15 it says which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balam the son of basor who loved the wages of unrighteousness money controlled balum and if money controlled balum balum used money to control that's the danger that's the the running greedily after the heir of balam for reward that's the caution to us is that we cannot be controlled by money nor should we use money to control we read this statement on Sunday money was the prophet balum who sold out his gifts to go on the account of money when Balo offered so much money he was greedy for reward we I could say this that the he of balum was all he was concerned about was the paycheck he thought well I I just need a paycheck a man's got to work to eat so I I I I got to work and I want to get uh money and I want to provide for my house and Bible says a man doesn't provide for his own he's worse than an Infidel so there's a way that you could rationalize into making the paycheck have preeminence rationalize into money and getting ahead and finances and things just to become this Albatross and this weight and this burden that's upon us because we run greedily after the wages we run greedily after the salary we run greedily after the things of the world and there's a way that this money becomes a problem because if all you want is money not worried about testimony character uh uh sleeping well at night and things like that uh there's a you begin to cut Corners you begin to lie and cheat there's a lot of ways that this problem with money that's not just a preacher's problem can get all of us we covered a lot of this in Parts one and two on a mortgaged home earlier this year and so I would just make reference to that and say that we've covered this a lot we've touched on this a lot and I believe it Bears repeating though I don't I'm just going to repeat maybe a few things as we go forward but in Proverbs 15: 27 says he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house but he that hateth gifts shall live I remember this very well it's like ouch I you I got to hate gifts but that one that's eager to be rich desirous of wealth puts a lot of stock in having material possessions he troubles his household even though he may be acquiring possessions and getting rich and accumulating wealth it says it's a it's a trouble to his house and then it says but he that hateth gifts shall live I don't want to just I don't want to just live in a sleep in a house I don't just want to breathe uh in Nice Clothing I I want to live I want to have life and have it more abundantly I don't want to just get by and so there's this caution that don't trouble yourself or your house being greedy for gain by satisfying the lust of the Flesh and let allowing that to have preeminence and he that hateth gifts shall live that word gifts there means bribes something that's given to influence judgment given to influence a decision and the these gifts that were offered by ba to Bam it it made him vulnerable to Temptation because it was kind of that that enticement that trap for the Bible even I think being silent and it doesn't let balam get away with it it calls him out later on in numbers 31 it calls him out in Revelation and second Peter he gets called out but in the silence the Bible allows it to be silent how balum goes undercover and silently and works something out with Bao to cause Israel to stumble what did that he was greedy for reward he loved the wages of unrighteousness greed caused balum to overvalue money to overv Value possessions just as Judas might have thought well I can Christ will get out of this he's the Messiah I I can make this all work but what got him in that position he loved the money that was in the bag it caused bam to overvalue money to overvalue oportunity and he might think well if I've got money I can do this if I have money I can do that many times people say well they rationalize well if I can do this and I can do that I'll have a lot of money I'll be able to help this out you know brother Aaron I'm GNA go do this and I'm GNA do that and you know don't you worry I'll be making so much money we'll we'll build two churches one in Phoenix and one in Jackson Wyoming and I say praise no brother pray about it right there's a and the promises are made but then you realize is that just a way to make somebody feel good about what they're about to do and their family never sees them again for the next 3 months got to be very very careful we put too much value on money and I'll say this as families we've got a balance sheet and we got line items in this balance sheet that are worth a lot more than anything tangible or material and though this greed caused him to overvalue money I would say worse it caused him to devalue God's word worse it caused him to devalue God's people worse it caused him to devalue the gift that he had it drove balam to disarm honesty because of this opportunity he held a little bit back and then he began to lie then he began to act wrong it corrupted his decisions it it was undermining his teaching every time he opened his mouth Israel was blessed so they were blessed people what does he do he causes the wrath of God to come upon Him by teaching them how to stumble if you look at the scripture balam went from being a prophet to a soothsayer because of money because of the lust of the flesh as these things are related we mentioned this maybe a couple Services ago brother bandam saying these are things a minister must watch a minister must watch in 1 Timothy 3:3 it speaks of a bishop the one holding an office of a pastor should not be given to Wine no Striker not greedy a filthy ler but patient not a brawler not Covetous the Bible's not just saying this as uh if it all possible you know as much as lith within you don't get into fist fights he said you can't be that you you can't be Covetous you can't be a striker you can't be a brawler you you can't be somebody who's quick to punch somebody out you can't be somebody who's jealous and possessive you can't be given to these other intoxications so it it's not just simply a well when you're interviewing pastors just see how many check marks you can get next to these things but it says a not greedy of filthy looker that means eager for money he's concerned or D driven by money and we say well as long as we don't uh as long as we're poor we're okay but it's not just a matter of being wealthy as the scriptures teach us in other places that it's a trap to be rich but for the poor it's a trap to want to be rich so it's not just in the having but it can also be in the not having so it's not just being wealthy but it can be the wrong attitude towards money or the wrong use of money you worry about it you're controlled by it you're selfish with it you only use it at times where it fits you uh uh meets your own means and needs I've seen many situations where in a church I think we've alluded to this a little bit on Sunday where the money is Consolidated in with the pastor and most people are very good at their tithing and in tithing that 10% going to the pastor uh and for the pastors used to support Ministry and in churches where uh maybe everyone ties but they don't pay offerings then there's a lot of tithing but there's no offering and it comes time to do something the church needs something a and the pastor says well I tell you what I think we should do this and I think we should do that and some of the people and the trustees are like well I don't know that kind of sounds illegal brother right and the pastor says well fine then I won't I won't I won't Finance it I won't support it I'll just take my plans and a and go do my own thing a and and the trustees are kind of left out of it because they realize well at the end of the day the pastor's the one with the money so if he's not on board with it and what can he do he can control the whole thing through money whether it be a little or a lot but brother Brandon is talking about uh these types of things in church order and he says the trustees don't have to ask brother Neville if he wants the roof put on the Tabernacle that's the pastor no no that's nothing to brother Neville it's nothing to me remember when they were remodeling the Tabernacle and brother bam says I I would have voted against it putting all this money into the church and we believe Jesus is coming he said I would have voted against it and that's just brother brandham saying that's what he would do and he tells us because as a prophet even one with the contrary opinion to what the people were choosing he didn't bud in and say my name's on the sign you're not doing it the pastor didn't say well I've got the money you're not doing he says that's a decision that's entrusted in certain individuals to make that decision with this particular money and it's not for the pastor to control and just as pastors can be tempted to misuse the money in those ways and I'm only using as an example that sometimes money means more if money is a problem the lust of the flesh is a problem it can be more pervasive and more subtle and be applicable in a lot more ways than just wow he's rich and that's his biggest problem or he just wants to be rich and that's his biggest problem it's a vast area if all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life that covers a lot doesn't it therefore money women and popularity cover a lot it covers it all probably as we read this earlier 1 Timothy chapter 6 and this godliness with contentment is great gain is what he's building this on brought nothing into this world surely we're going to take nothing out so he says but they that will be rich now it's not saying it's not the proposition that anybody who's rich will do this but it's the wrong attitude towards the money wrong attitude towards the wages wrong attitude towards the reward remember when Jesus said it's harder for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God than it is for a camel through the eye of the needle and there's no rationalizing with that and trying to say well it's just difficult Jesus uses an extreme almost impossible example to get the people's attention that there is a great Temptation when it comes to wealth great Temptation for rich people to trust in the richest a great Temptation for rich people to use their riches in the wrong way so it's a caution about money they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare into many foolish and hurtful lust which drown men in destruction and predition let's say it together this phrase for the love of money is the root of all evil let's say it together for the love of money is the root of all evil why were you mumbling some of you the love of money is the root of all evil that's right which while some coveted after what money they have aired from the the faith and Pierce themselves through with many Sorrows as I was studying this phrase this week it's interesting um maybe just the word choice the love of money is the root of all evil and the root would be the progeny or offspring and you can say that money is definitely love of money lucer Springs forth from something evil but it's used in uh we recognize this to be and most people would agree on this and brother Bram shows this way that it's the love of money from which Springs forth evil and we could certainly say it's the root of these things in verse nine the love of money is the root of many foolish and hurtful lust which drown men in destruction and predition the love of money is the root of all evil in other words it leads to Temptation it promotes jealousy it encourages arrogance it'll cause murder remember the error of Judas who for money participated in a conspir conspiracy against Christ we mentioned this before I think it was in May of this year how that one out of 10 verses in the gospels I think 288 Total Focus directly on the subject of money one out of 10 in 16 of Jesus's 38 Parables he deals with possessions material possessions posessions or money there's over 2,000 verses in the Bible that address money and possessions around 500 on prayer and less than 500 on faith but over 2,000 dedicated to money and material possessions why because it's those things that are a stumbling block to prayer they'll cause us to pray the wrong way we fleece God so much he's thinking that we we got a flock of sheep just 500 on prayer less than 500 on faith but 2,000 that address money and possessions why because the Love of Money diminishes character it increases our anxiety it distracts us from the word the word of God I is is instructing us and showing us that to spend money wisely is it going to make you a Christian to be broke doesn't make you more spiritual but the fact that we want to grow and be cultivated and develop in the word of God we want to use our Liberty to become like Christ we know that power apart from character satanic we know that we're to come into the image of God and that has nothing to do with necessarily what's seen then we know that in our hearts the devil would want to do anything he can to keep us from becoming all that we can be and so stumbling blocks are the only things that he can use in money is one of his biggest stumbling blocks because it causes us to to Veer from the right path Paul in writing to Timothy said which while some coveted after they have aired from the faith they didn't aim at Faith they didn't aim at the word like Abel who pleased God by Revelation and that was satisfactory he says many when they get their eyes on money are no longer aiming to please God by faith but to please themselves by lust they've aired from the faith brother Bram said when a man gets his mind on money he loses god wow because if you if you listen if you got your if when a man gets his mind on money he loses God he says in another place when a man gets to a place he just has to scream and cry and Carry On and think so much of money he forgets God he's gone that's all there is to it that's right he says it takes him out of God's harness words God's using you God's blessing you and then as soon as you begin to yell and scream and push and pull for money God's like whoa I that's not me I'm not driving you to do that you're not doing my will when a man gets his mind on money he loses God so you don't want your mind on your money and your money on your mind you want to keep God the word at the Forefront when a man gets to a place he has to carry on about money he forgets God what his trust is no longer in the Lord he said that's all there is to it he's gone not only have they coveted after they've aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with many Sorrows you want to bring a dark cloud over yourself get your mind on money you want to drive yourself crazy get your mind on money you want to lead yourself to doing a lot of things that are out out of character get your mind on money money can cause people to act in very strange ways we can be so distrustful from God that were afraid to do something because of the financial impact and not just trust God I can relate to times in my life where I felt like God was calling me to do something and situations were getting to where it was untenable it was no longer pleasing to the Lord but yet you find some comfort in what you know you find some comfort in a standard of living based upon where you can work and and whatever support you might be getting and there's this feeling of well I I it's really hard to forsake the known to launch out into the unknown and and I remember I was in a situation where I just didn't know what to do and I knew God wanted me to change things and I was just going to have to trust the Lord and step out and I begin to make a stand for the word of God I begin to make a stand for my family I begin to purpose in my heart that I wasn't going to be controlled uh by money women or popularity and politics and as I begin to make that decision God laid it upon someone's heart I don't think I've ever told this testimony publicly they let it on their heart they flew into town they shot up they said I want to go to lunch with you and they told me said brother Aaron God's put it in my heart to to support you financially and this is how much I want to give you and he said this is how much I want to give you H H it was a group said we want to give you this much uh uh and we just we'll do it for a year and then we'll re-evaluate at the end of that year and I I took that that offering and I put an account that I used for Ministry a year and a half later when I moved to Phoenix that amount that they said they would give to me a year and a half before was to the dollar what my rent was when I moved here and I had it in the B when I got here and I I testify that to say I know what it's like to be in a panic when it comes to providing for your family paying bills I can testify I'm not up here thinking well he's a rich lawyer he can rail on money all day long show me someone who will pay me my hourly rate who wants to pay me my hourly rate and I can get rich but people don't want to pay that hourly rate I'm not a rich lawyer or am I I got to keep people guessing I'm not a rich lawyer trust me there's it is a battle and so listen to what brother bham says in the sermon to whom would we go the the date on this kind of stands out to me and he's speaking of Christ he is the only Eternal Foundation we have many other foundations but Christ is the only Eternal Foundation he's going through these different things that Christ is he is 1 2 3 and this was the fourth one he says everything else will fall except Christ you might build your foundation upon riches remember when you're talking about the house of the Lord and the right kind of foundation he says you might build your foundation upon riches you might have plenty of money leave plenty of money for your children what will it cause you know if you have you if you leave a lot of money for your children chances are it's just going to be a fight when you're gone right I want this and I want that give me this I didn't get my portion it's just a heartache somewhere so it says what do riches lead to heartaches disappointments fusses disagreements falling out shooting rape murder and finally sometimes to Suicide money there it is that he covers every country song every rap song every rock and roll song every blues song it's all in there heartache disappointment fusses disagreements falling out shooting rape murder and finally sometimes just suicide he gets the emao group in there it's all in there money he said the banks can go go broke close up or something happened that you in a gamble you lose your money take a gun and blow your head off the foundation's not Eternal your money doesn't have an eternal Foundation money problems aren't just for preachers for people BMS aren't just for Bishops they're for believers to be cautioned by and does God ever change his mind about his word he says balum had a gift of faith and could have used it to the perfect original word of God could we just be a little bit mature tonight glad it's on a Wednesday night what is the perfect original word of God what is God's perfect and original way to receive anything what is it that pleases God what is it that we're to look to above everything else the word the word the word that's in no means limiting God in the way that he can move it certainly by no means limits how God can manifest himself but it does limit what our emphasis should be it does limit on what we put our faith in and what we put our evidence in we don't put our evidence in sensation we put our evidence in believing and receiving the word of God that doesn't mean just because you can say Amen to the message of the hour like this doesn't mean you've got it but it's when you can receive the word have a clear understanding and demonstrate by a life lived by the word that the word is dwelling in you bam had a gift of faith and could have used it for the perfect original word of God to stay true to how the messenger taught it to stay true to the word in that Exodus and he says many men on the field today with gifts of healing could do the same thing many men out here people speaking in tongues people prophesying a gift could use it for the kingdom of God but they don't do it they don't use it for the perfect original word of God they use it for the tongues and the prophesying and the gifts they don't use it to lift up the pure word of God they do it to lift up personalities and themselves this is the temptation of a for AUM he said they take and God blesses them anyhow gets the permissive will now it's God permits it he said but for popularity and Pleasures personal gains sold their birth rights as Esau did sold out to an organization sold out like balum did so many are doing the same or doing today the same thing we know that's right they sell out their Birthright don't any of you sell your Birthright Esau was a profane person sold out his Birthright you can say for popularity for Pleasures for personal gain even if it's not a Pulpit even if it's not a gift even if it's not a Ministry none of us should sell out our birthrights as Believers for popularity for Pleasures for personal gain he says women professing the Holy Ghost wearing shorts man per permitting them in the Pulpit bobbed haired women in the pulpits pain on their face with religious gowns on the biggest stuff stumbling block the church has ever had the misuse of a gift inordinate emphases the wrong the the the the true anointing on the false expression brother B time and time again was constantly he doesn't he doesn't say that Pentecost is wrong if we say Pentecost is just emotion or Pentecost is happiness and joy and shouting and dancing speaking tongues he doesn't say that's wrong but where he saw the air is when the people with the bobbed hair and the makeup and the worldly living and everything we're doing we're doing it right and participating in it and people are saying r on you got it you done good and not calling it out as hey you know that's wonderful letting out the steam every once in a while but you better be sure you're born again by the word of God he say it's the biggest stumbling block the church has ever had I believe in the day and age that we're living in the Love of Money the lust of the flesh is a problem not just for pulpits something that all of us must be uh uh sensitive to brother Micah please come brother Elliott can come to your instruments and the sermon show us the father and it'll satisfy I want us to end with this and this could be our prayer he says if you ever want to pray for me it's not to have money not to have big homes or be popular but just pray that I can stay in the hands of Christ mold clay that he can mold me and use me in any way that he sees fits to do it could you look at that don't pray that God bless me with money don't pray that God gives me a big home let don't support me in those things so I can do that or or don't pray that I could be popular don't pray for money women and popularity don't don't pray that I have these things but if you could just pray that I stay in the hands of Christ as a lump of clay to be molded in a way that he could use in a way that he see sees fit to do it if brother Brandon would say could you pray that for me couldn't we shouldn't we pray that for ourselves that Lord I don't want to pray that I have money I don't want to pray to have a big home I don't want to pray to be popular I don't want to pray to have friends you realize how many people make decisions based upon social things they make decisions based upon the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life when it comes to where they go to church because they're praying for money big homes in popularity and what they don't want is to be on God's will to be a piece of clay that could be molded wow brother Bram says could you pray that way for me and next statement he says I'll pray the same thing for you that you'll be the same way am it's good for us too he'll pray the same thing for you that you'll be the same way then let's make a promise no offense to anybody here but I'm not going to pray that you get rich I'm not going to pray that you have big homes I'm not going to pray that you're popular but I'm going to pray that you as God's clay could be molded therefore that you could be used as he sees fit isn't that where we want to be isn't that the place we want to find ourselves in knowing that there there's provision there there's pleasure there there's peace there God satisfies what the lust of the flesh can never satisfy there God satisfies what the lust of the eyes can never satisfy there God promotes and honors to which the pride of life could never satisfy so we pray today that we would be in the hands of Christ as clay molded and used in a way that Christ sees fit pray that for one another pray that for yourself let's stand and pray this tonight
