[0:00] isaiah chapter 32 verses 9 to 20
[0:03] and i'm reading these first several
[0:06] verses
[0:07] up to verse 17 just for context and
[0:10] background and also you'll see
[0:12] a contrast and some connections to what
[0:16] we're going to be speaking on this
[0:17] morning it says rise up you women
[0:19] that are at ease hear my voice you
[0:21] careless daughters
[0:23] give ear unto my speech many days and
[0:26] years shall
[0:26] ye be troubled you careless woman women
[0:29] for the vintage shall fail the gathering
[0:31] shall not come
[0:32] tremble ye women that are at ease be
[0:34] troubled ye careless ones
[0:36] strip you and make you bear and gird
[0:38] sackcloth upon your loins
[0:39] they shall lament for for the teats for
[0:42] the pleasant fields for the fruitful
[0:44] vine
[0:44] upon the land of my people shall come up
[0:47] thorns and briers
[0:48] yea upon all the houses of joy and the
[0:50] joyous city
[0:51] because the palaces shall be forsaken
[0:53] the multitude of the city shall be left
[0:55] the forts and towers shall be for dens
[0:57] forever a joy of wild ass a joy of wild
[1:00] ass as a pasture of flocks
[1:02] until the spirit be poured upon us from
[1:04] on high in the wilderness be a fruitful
[1:06] filled and the fruitful field be counted
[1:08] for a forest then judgment shall dwell
[1:11] in the wilderness and righteousness
[1:13] remain in the fruit fulfilled
[1:15] and the work of the righteousness shall
[1:17] be peace
[1:18] and the effect of righteousness
[1:19] quietness and assurance forever
[1:22] and my people shall dwell in a peaceable
[1:25] habitation
[1:26] and ensure dwellings and in quiet
[1:29] resting
[1:29] places you may be seated
[1:33] i hope to come back to that uh those
[1:35] last two verses
[1:38] towards the end on how the work of
[1:40] righteousness is peace the effect of
[1:42] righteousness is quietness
[1:44] and assurance forever and then my people
[1:47] shall dwell
[1:47] in a peaceable habitation and ensure
[1:50] dwellings
[1:51] and in quiet resting places doesn't that
[1:54] just describe something you want
[1:57] just a wonderful wonderful description
[2:00] my title today is back to the beginning
[2:02] and simplicity by faith and we're
[2:05] continuing on the theme of how things
[2:07] have become very complicated
[2:09] focusing on genesis chapter 1 and
[2:11] chapter 2 we saw how that life was
[2:13] simple in the beginning
[2:14] and then genesis chapter 3 is what
[2:17] brings the complication
[2:18] and complication started to set in as
[2:21] soon as a question
[2:22] was asked of the woman that god had
[2:24] already answered
[2:25] and she began to ponder what those
[2:27] implications might be
[2:28] the lie that followed and this had an
[2:30] impact upon her spirit
[2:32] it gave her knowledge that god had not
[2:34] given her knowledge contrary to the word
[2:36] of the lord it was a lie you shall not
[2:38] die
[2:39] it was a lie that you would become as
[2:40] god knowing good and evil and you'd be
[2:42] wise and you'd have this understanding
[2:44] that would be opened
[2:45] but the knowledge opened herself up to
[2:48] desire
[2:49] and long for an experience so it went
[2:50] just beyond information and it turned
[2:53] into experiencing something
[2:55] which manifested in the fall and
[2:58] we we've acknowledged that life in the
[3:00] beginning though it was simple it could
[3:02] be described as complex but god gave
[3:04] them a rule to live by a word to live by
[3:07] and with structure with order and with
[3:09] boundaries and with roles and certain
[3:11] irrational a godly rationale to approach
[3:14] creation
[3:14] it took the complexity away so that the
[3:17] man and the women could just live simple
[3:19] god gave them a word to live by they
[3:21] could have faith in that word and they
[3:22] could just walk forward
[3:23] in that promise and so complication was
[3:26] born from something that was not
[3:28] true wisdom something that had not been
[3:30] in the word of god something
[3:32] that was contrary to truth and once
[3:34] complication enters into the picture
[3:36] it's irrational it's unpredictable you
[3:39] don't know
[3:40] which is up or which is down you don't
[3:42] know exactly what the reasoning is
[3:44] behind it because a lie
[3:45] doesn't need to have any kind of
[3:46] rationale a lie doesn't need to have
[3:48] reasoning lie
[3:49] doesn't really need to have a foundation
[3:51] or a base though those who use lies
[3:53] often try to bolster with a lot of facts
[3:55] and a lot of data a lot of information
[3:57] and sometimes when a person's giving a
[3:59] little bit too much detail
[4:00] you start to wonder is this are they
[4:02] making this up because how could
[4:03] somebody remember that
[4:04] that much detail but but something
[4:07] that's not true doesn't really have
[4:08] anything to back it up so it's
[4:10] unpredictable you can't rely on it you
[4:11] can't
[4:12] you can't trust it and so today i'm i'm
[4:15] just beginning
[4:16] on the thought of getting back to
[4:18] simplicity or back to the beginning and
[4:20] simplicity by faith
[4:22] and so that this is exactly how i want
[4:24] to present it
[4:25] how do we get back to simplicity how do
[4:28] we get away from things that are
[4:29] complicated how do we not get caught up
[4:31] in
[4:31] in the labyrinth of complexity you go
[4:34] back to the beginning
[4:35] and i believe we can go back to the
[4:37] beginning and identify the very things
[4:39] that complicates life
[4:41] we've looked at it in genesis chapter
[4:42] three but now i want to take a step
[4:43] further in genesis chapter four so
[4:45] that's kind of just my little bit of a
[4:47] foundation and let's turn in genesis
[4:49] chapter four
[4:50] and read verses one to two and then
[4:53] we're just going to stay in genesis
[4:55] chapter 4 skipping just a few verses
[4:58] here and there
[4:59] to follow this as a story
[5:12] so genesis chapter four we'll start with
[5:14] verses one and two and it says and adam
[5:16] knew
[5:16] eve his wife and she conceived in bear
[5:19] cain
[5:19] and said i have gotten a man from the
[5:22] lord
[5:23] and she bear again his brother abel even
[5:26] the
[5:26] the jews when they look back upon these
[5:28] scriptures believed that cain
[5:30] and abel were born as twins and so it
[5:33] says
[5:34] cain was born then abel was born and
[5:36] then it lists abel first which is a very
[5:38] interesting uh factor
[5:41] to name abel first even though cain was
[5:43] bore first or it shows in the scripture
[5:45] he was born first to mention
[5:46] abel first is an interesting point but
[5:49] then it says this and abel was the
[5:50] keeper of sheep
[5:52] but cain was a tiller of the ground and
[5:54] i just want to start right here
[5:56] um and i'll preface by saying this even
[5:59] though we're looking at genesis chapter
[6:01] 4 we're trying to understand
[6:03] 2021. so even though we're going back
[6:06] to genesis chapter 4 we're only doing
[6:08] this because these scriptures we're not
[6:09] only doing it for this reason but we're
[6:11] doing this because
[6:12] the scriptures were written for our
[6:14] benefit and for our learning they're
[6:15] written so that we can draw
[6:17] strength and comfort from them and they
[6:19] can be instructive to us so there's
[6:20] something that we can learn today
[6:22] from these very verses that are written
[6:25] and when you read it you have adam and
[6:27] the woman adam and eve they have two
[6:28] sons
[6:29] cain and abel it says abel was a keeper
[6:31] of sheep and cain was a tiller of the
[6:33] ground so you have a shepherd and a
[6:35] farmer
[6:36] and when you begin to think about it
[6:37] there really wasn't very many other
[6:38] professions outside of that
[6:40] so when they're born daddy what can i be
[6:42] when i grow up and
[6:43] and and adam was like well you could
[6:46] either be a farmer or you could be a
[6:47] shepherd
[6:48] you could either plow on the field or
[6:50] you could herd the sheep there really
[6:51] wasn't any other choices so they had a
[6:53] very simple decision to make as they
[6:55] were growing up
[6:56] and some speculate that cain being the
[6:58] firstborn adam being described as a
[7:00] tiller of the ground
[7:02] uh asked that cain be the designated him
[7:04] to be the farmer
[7:06] but in these two professions and these
[7:08] two walks of life and these two callings
[7:10] and these
[7:10] two daily tasks that adam that abel and
[7:14] cain were to bear
[7:15] from these two tasks you find that every
[7:17] necessity of life could be met
[7:19] within these professions as adam excuse
[7:22] me
[7:23] abel being a keeper of the sheep this
[7:25] the sheep themselves could be a source
[7:26] of meat a source of milk
[7:28] a source of clothing a source of you
[7:30] could tan the hides to make tents and to
[7:32] make dwelling so the
[7:33] the sheep itself could be something that
[7:35] could provide even if they were never
[7:37] um killed for meat it could be used for
[7:40] milk they could be used for wool there's
[7:41] a lot of things that could be done
[7:43] from this sheep to provide resources to
[7:47] preserve life and
[7:49] cain being a tiller of the ground he
[7:51] could grow fruit he could grow grain
[7:52] there could be vegetables there's herbs
[7:54] that he could grow
[7:55] so just think i'm just trying to want
[7:57] you to think about how simple life was
[7:58] even after the fall in some sense
[8:01] and we might call this primitive labor
[8:03] labor it means it was
[8:04] this was the first kind of labor that
[8:06] was done by man it's the first it was
[8:07] primary
[8:08] uh we could even say it's primitive in
[8:10] the sense that it was extremely basic
[8:12] but it was only what was necessary to
[8:14] sustain life
[8:16] that's all that that's all that able was
[8:18] doing that's all that adam was doing
[8:20] that's all that cain was doing that
[8:21] which was necessary to feed the body to
[8:23] clothe the body
[8:24] and those are the things that they
[8:25] engaged in those are the things that
[8:26] they did on a daily basis
[8:29] and we could if you i was even just
[8:31] pondering it this past week of how many
[8:33] professions are there now
[8:34] compared to how many there were then and
[8:37] say well if you can take an aptitude
[8:39] test there was only two results you're
[8:40] either going to be a farmer or you're
[8:42] going to be a
[8:42] shepherd and but nowadays there's
[8:45] thousands and thousands of professions
[8:48] and there's always new ones that are
[8:49] coming forth
[8:50] there's always new ones that are being
[8:52] created there's who would have thought
[8:53] that you could have on your resume
[8:55] influencer
[8:57] right i mean that's what you do for a
[8:59] living you're an influencer
[9:01] and well what do you do i just make
[9:02] little short little video clips and i
[9:04] get paid for it like wow that sounds
[9:05] like the life right
[9:07] but there's people who who make living
[9:09] and not just make living they make
[9:11] some of them make millions of dollars
[9:13] it's a very very small segment so don't
[9:14] start thinking lord i want to grow up to
[9:16] be an influencer
[9:17] very very small segment of the
[9:18] population but when you think of the
[9:20] millions of dollars that are being
[9:21] earned
[9:22] in some industries or some professions
[9:24] and some
[9:25] uh some jobs you think where did that
[9:27] come from
[9:28] where did that money come from but yet
[9:30] there's constantly new areas of
[9:32] revenue and new areas of income and
[9:34] things that can be done and so nowadays
[9:36] someone says well what do you want to be
[9:37] when you grow up mutants well i want to
[9:39] be a
[9:40] a blacksmith or i want to be a farmer i
[9:42] want to be an innkeeper
[9:43] it's so much more broad now than it's
[9:45] ever been before
[9:46] and that adds to the complications of
[9:48] life
[9:50] especially when we we got further away
[9:51] from agrarian society into an industrial
[9:54] society the things about home and
[9:55] community begin to break down
[9:57] and now things are very fragmented and
[9:59] and even within
[10:00] industries you say well i'm in this
[10:02] industry but you can be in a niche
[10:03] within that
[10:04] industry then you can be a niche within
[10:06] a niche
[10:07] and then you could be within a niche
[10:09] within that niche of a niche
[10:11] and that's just the way that it works so
[10:12] somebody asks you a question i have no
[10:13] idea well i thought you were in this
[10:15] industry
[10:15] but i'm in this part of the industry
[10:18] just when people ask about lawyers they
[10:20] say well do you go to court do you go to
[10:22] trial
[10:22] but less than five percent of all
[10:24] lawyers um even go to court
[10:26] less than 10 percent they're they're not
[10:28] litigators they're more than
[10:29] a great majority over 90 or in areas of
[10:32] law that you probably haven't even
[10:33] thought of they
[10:33] oh lawyers do that yes they do that why
[10:36] because it's more complicated or you
[10:38] could say complex
[10:39] than it ever was so i'm just wanting to
[10:41] bring this contrast here at the very
[10:42] beginning
[10:43] how that abel was a keeper of sheep cain
[10:45] was a tiller of the ground
[10:47] and this is what they would do every day
[10:49] they would wake up and they would begin
[10:50] to till the ground they'd wake up
[10:52] they'd begin to shepherd the sheep but
[10:54] it wasn't a life without hope
[10:56] and this is where we're zeroing in on
[10:58] something that it's just so easy kind of
[10:59] to lose
[11:00] track of what was there in the beginning
[11:02] because they say well man and the woman
[11:03] were placed
[11:04] in the garden of eden it was perfect
[11:06] they had a promise a word to live by
[11:08] and when they sinned they were just
[11:09] shoved out into chaos and life has been
[11:11] chaotic ever since
[11:12] and we're all just kind of chaotic
[11:14] sinners pleading for the grace of god
[11:16] but you can go all the way back to
[11:17] genesis 4 and see that there was some
[11:19] order and there was some sense of the
[11:21] divine that still gave meaning and
[11:23] purpose to the lives that were being
[11:24] lived
[11:25] because it wasn't just a life without
[11:27] hope it wasn't a life that was worthless
[11:29] it wasn't just a life where man was just
[11:31] living
[11:31] to return to the dust well one day i
[11:33] guess i'm just going to go to the dust
[11:34] but in genesis chapter 3 specifically
[11:37] genesis chapter 3 verse 15
[11:39] god had prophesied of a redeemer god had
[11:42] prophesied of one that would come who
[11:44] would bring a remedy who would bring a
[11:45] help who'd be a savior
[11:46] or a deliverer to man these feelings
[11:49] that man experienced the fallen nature
[11:51] that man would have
[11:52] though it may be expressed in very
[11:54] simple words and maybe even to some
[11:56] degree
[11:56] symbolic of all the things that god
[11:58] might have actually said to adam
[12:00] god told adam and the woman as they're
[12:02] going don't fear
[12:04] i will send you a man who's going to
[12:06] rescue you
[12:08] don't worry it may look bad right now
[12:10] and you may be fearful right now and you
[12:11] may
[12:12] may be worried about your future but one
[12:14] day a woman will bring forth a man
[12:16] and this man will destroy everything
[12:18] that this serpent caused
[12:20] woman i know you feel deceived i know
[12:22] you feel duped i know you feel
[12:23] responsible for ruining this eden but
[12:25] one day
[12:26] a woman will bring forth a child and he
[12:28] will be the help that you need he will
[12:30] be the remedy to sin
[12:31] he will be the answer to all this
[12:33] confusion you're feeling right now
[12:35] and so they had a source of
[12:37] encouragement
[12:39] god had given them a word still even as
[12:41] they left the garden he'd given them
[12:42] something that they could place their
[12:44] faith upon
[12:45] something that they could believe for so
[12:48] although they were doing the things that
[12:50] were necessary to sustain life by being
[12:52] a keeper of sheep and a tiller of the
[12:53] ground
[12:54] it was most necessary to have faith in
[12:56] god
[12:58] it was most necessary that they looked
[12:59] to the promise because god had given
[13:01] them a promise
[13:02] before they're completely banished out
[13:04] of the garden god said i will send you a
[13:06] deliverer
[13:07] so adam and the woman now are living
[13:09] with this con
[13:10] with this consciousness of the promise
[13:13] that god said he would send us help
[13:15] now could you just get that in your
[13:17] minds as simple as it might be
[13:18] and i feel that's really the remedy to
[13:20] all the complications is just to address
[13:22] this
[13:22] very simply in the scripture not try to
[13:24] dig out all the types and count the
[13:26] numbers and say
[13:26] see notice that that's the seventh word
[13:28] it has seven letters and it's seven
[13:30] in the seventh column of your bible i'm
[13:32] getting let's get past that right now
[13:35] sometimes what people do is they find a
[13:36] type and then build the truth around it
[13:39] instead of finding truth and then
[13:41] looking for the types we want to stick
[13:43] to truth what i wanted to share with you
[13:44] today is truth
[13:45] and if there's beautiful types we could
[13:47] talk about it at lunch because i enjoy
[13:48] them
[13:49] but we want to just look at it very
[13:51] simply now at how that god had given
[13:53] them a promise
[13:54] so they're conscious of this promise and
[13:56] it gave them something to take the faith
[13:58] that they had
[13:59] and place it on that promise so faith
[14:02] becomes the foundation upon which
[14:03] they're now living their lives in
[14:05] genesis 4.
[14:06] not the same faith that we would have
[14:07] today on particular promises that we
[14:09] have now
[14:10] but look at it in that simple dynamic of
[14:12] a man and a woman with children
[14:14] who are thrust into a chaotic world
[14:16] where they're not sure what's coming
[14:18] next they're not sure what to expect
[14:19] but they knew one thing god spoke and
[14:22] said if you eat that fruit you die and
[14:23] they learn that was true
[14:25] and they knew this god's the one that
[14:26] created heaven and earth this is the god
[14:28] that walked with them and visited
[14:30] them in the eden and the voice of the
[14:31] lord that would come and make his
[14:32] presence known
[14:33] and now he's thrust them out they've
[14:35] seen his mighty hand even in being
[14:37] banished from the garden
[14:38] and now he said listen i will send you a
[14:40] deliver i will send you a helper
[14:42] and they knew to take their faith and
[14:44] base it upon that
[14:46] and so you could even imagine that for
[14:48] adam and the woman there was one thing
[14:50] that was necessary
[14:52] there was one thing that was needful as
[14:53] jesus told mary this
[14:55] she has chosen she had chosen the good
[14:58] part
[14:59] he told martha martha you're so busy
[15:02] being encumbered and that was the
[15:03] feedback i got from wednesday night as i
[15:05] kept getting mary and martha mixed up so
[15:07] that's the feedback i get on the drive
[15:09] home is
[15:10] dad when are you ever going to figure
[15:11] out who mary is and who martha is
[15:14] so and who abel and who adam is today
[15:17] so things are there just so my kids know
[15:19] i'm human otherwise they would just be
[15:20] thinking
[15:21] who is this guy he's from another world
[15:27] but mary had chosen the one thing
[15:29] necessary as jesus said it
[15:32] and chosen that good part and so we're
[15:34] going back to the beginning to see that
[15:36] there's always been one thing necessary
[15:38] there's always been the good part that
[15:40] could be chosen and it just seems to be
[15:42] the very thing
[15:43] that makes sense of everything else or
[15:45] gives you a confidence to believe
[15:47] that if it's outside this i'm not going
[15:49] to worry about it
[15:51] if it's outside this i'm not going to
[15:53] try to make sense of it and i can't use
[15:55] the things that are outside of that to
[15:56] turn this upside down or take it away
[15:58] from me
[15:59] and so this was the one thing necessary
[16:02] faith and the promise
[16:03] so now verse three and and and this
[16:06] this next act to me is connected with
[16:08] this promise
[16:09] and in the process of time it came to
[16:11] pass that cain
[16:13] brought of the fruit of the ground an
[16:14] offering unto the lord and abel he also
[16:17] brought of the firstlings of his flock
[16:19] and of the fat thereof and the lord had
[16:22] respect
[16:23] unto abel into his offering but a
[16:25] decaying into his offering he had not
[16:27] respect
[16:28] in cain was very roth and his
[16:30] countenance
[16:31] fell now if you could just
[16:34] imagine how that cane offers an offering
[16:38] from the ground it would have been a
[16:39] very beautiful altar it would have been
[16:40] fruits that were given things that he
[16:42] had cultivated and grown
[16:44] fruit and grain and herbs and vegetables
[16:46] and you'll find that even in the old
[16:48] testament there's a grain offering
[16:49] you'll find that there's things that
[16:51] could be given as tithes or things that
[16:52] are
[16:53] given from from a worshipper that god
[16:56] would receive
[16:57] and so cain builds an altar and he
[16:59] offers these
[17:00] these sacrifices of fruit from the
[17:03] ground to the
[17:04] lord then abel perhaps at the same time
[17:07] maybe even before but in some proximity
[17:09] to cain's offering
[17:10] he offers the firstling of his flock and
[17:13] the fat thereof
[17:14] and so this was a bloody mess literally
[17:18] right this was an altar that would have
[17:20] smelled this is something that would
[17:21] have been repulsive
[17:22] this could have been an act that was
[17:23] very off-putting uh even decaying or
[17:25] maybe there
[17:26] if there were sisters alive or other
[17:28] siblings alive at the time this is
[17:29] something that could have been like oh
[17:30] my goodness what are what are my older
[17:32] brothers doing
[17:33] but he offers this sacrifice and god in
[17:36] some way
[17:37] respects abel's offering but doesn't
[17:39] canes
[17:41] and there's a tremendous lesson in this
[17:43] as we pondered this
[17:45] that there's abel does what he feels in
[17:49] his heart to do and having done it god
[17:51] gives this respect to it whether
[17:52] he consumes it with fire god does
[17:54] something to show that he respected his
[17:57] offering
[17:57] and cain's take takeaway from this
[18:00] abel's sincere offering
[18:01] cain offers sincere worship god respects
[18:04] abel
[18:05] cain though says he's very roth he's
[18:08] angry he's very very mad
[18:09] and his countenance has fallen in other
[18:11] words he's going to let you know he's
[18:12] mad
[18:14] he looked mad he wasn't just putting on
[18:15] a happy face and making it look like
[18:17] everything's fine no
[18:18] nothing's wrong i promise nothing's
[18:19] wrong he was he was very
[18:22] you could tell he was something was
[18:23] wrong now kane
[18:26] abel's offering was connected with god's
[18:28] promise
[18:30] the very offering of this lamb he was a
[18:32] he was a keeper of the sheep so he would
[18:34] have taken a lamb a sheep an innocent
[18:36] lamb
[18:36] and he was slain it upon the altar and
[18:38] allowed that blood to be shed
[18:39] and what abel was doing reflected
[18:42] genesis 3 15
[18:44] because the man that would be born of
[18:45] that woman that would crush the
[18:46] serpent's head
[18:47] he would do it as being a lamb he would
[18:50] do it as being a sacrifice that would
[18:51] shed his blood
[18:52] so whether or not abel fully understood
[18:54] that even in his revelation and his
[18:56] offering it was connected with that
[18:59] and then it was also connected with the
[19:00] provision that god had given in 3
[19:02] 21 genesis 3 21 dressed them in skins it
[19:05] would have been a bleeding lamb it would
[19:06] have been a bloody sheep
[19:07] that was slain that adam took and slew
[19:10] and then made coats
[19:11] and made skins to cover himself in so
[19:13] abel's worship is connected with the
[19:15] promise of god
[19:16] connected with the prophecy of there
[19:18] being a deliverer and even how it says
[19:20] in revelations 3
[19:21] 13 8 that the lamb was slain before the
[19:24] foundation of the world
[19:26] so this is something abel has his
[19:28] worship is connected with something
[19:30] divine it's connected to
[19:31] god's promise and in hebrews chapter 11
[19:34] verse 4 it says by faith
[19:36] abel offered unto god a more excellent
[19:39] sacrifice
[19:40] than cain by faith in other words by
[19:42] revelation
[19:44] abel was able to offer a more excellent
[19:47] sacrifice
[19:48] so what made his worship greater than
[19:51] cain's you can say well because it was
[19:52] connected to the lamb and it was
[19:54] connected to genesis 3 21 it was
[19:56] connected to genesis 3 15.
[19:57] it's connected to revelations 13 8. it
[19:59] was connected to this it's connected to
[20:01] that
[20:01] it represented christ and we could see
[20:03] yes those are things that make the
[20:05] revelation
[20:06] seem so significant but what abel did is
[20:08] he acted by faith
[20:11] he acted by revelation god had quickened
[20:13] it god had revealed it to him
[20:14] he by faith offered up that offering by
[20:17] which he obtained witness that he was
[20:18] righteous it was by his faith that he
[20:20] obtained witness that he was righteous
[20:22] god testifying of his gifts wherein god
[20:24] had respect
[20:26] unto his offering and then it says
[20:29] and by it by the faith he being dead yet
[20:34] speaketh
[20:36] now this is this is how it's instructive
[20:38] even still to us today
[20:40] abel's righteous acts still declare
[20:43] still speak that it's best to act by
[20:46] faith what he did in the beginning if
[20:49] you just look at him in the most simple
[20:50] basic terms
[20:51] without the types and without book of
[20:53] revelations without before the
[20:55] foundation of the world without even
[20:56] fully understanding genesis 3
[20:58] just looking at the very basics of what
[21:00] was done the word of god identifies that
[21:02] abel offered the lamb
[21:04] by faith cain did not offer by faith
[21:08] and so abel still testifies his blood
[21:10] still speaks today that it's best to act
[21:13] by faith
[21:15] it's best to be doing what you're doing
[21:16] by faith and since it's written this way
[21:19] it directly implies that cain
[21:21] acted without the necessary requirement
[21:23] of faith
[21:25] it directly implies this it's it's
[21:27] absolutely
[21:28] right that we would take this from it um
[21:31] because it's being implied
[21:32] it's been we're being told this to look
[21:34] at this and abel is recognized as having
[21:36] faith
[21:37] therefore it's telling us that cain did
[21:38] not have faith
[21:40] that cain and acting he acted as if the
[21:42] ceremony was enough
[21:45] that as long as i just give the worship
[21:47] that'll be enough as long as i just give
[21:48] him his due
[21:49] yeah yeah yeah he's a god it doesn't
[21:51] matter how you worship him just give him
[21:52] some kind of worship
[21:53] cain was a little bit dismissive and
[21:55] though he may have been sincere in his
[21:56] offering
[21:57] and though it may have been perfect and
[21:58] it may have been beautiful cain lacked
[22:00] something deep down on the inside
[22:02] to know that he was offering this
[22:04] offering by faith
[22:06] and brother branham even makes a
[22:07] statement in one place and maybe a
[22:09] couple places
[22:10] where it's uh if it says well why did
[22:12] cain bring this and why did abel bring
[22:14] that
[22:16] he makes a statement referring to cain's
[22:18] offering and and he says
[22:19] as he was taught by his parents
[22:23] there may have been a reluctance on the
[22:25] part of adam and the woman
[22:26] to share everything that had happened in
[22:28] the garden
[22:30] and there may have been they may have
[22:32] spoken even symbolically
[22:34] say well why did you why did you why did
[22:37] this happen or why did that happen
[22:39] uh and they say well god told us not to
[22:41] eat of the tree of knowledge of good and
[22:43] evil
[22:44] and and we partook of that fruit in
[22:46] doing so we were cast out of the garden
[22:48] and cain takes it very literally it was
[22:50] fruit that done it
[22:51] then i'm gonna offer fruit now think of
[22:53] how sincere he would have been then
[22:55] but then abel gets more a deeper
[22:57] revelation there's something that's
[22:58] quickened to him
[22:59] and by faith he doesn't just stick to
[23:01] what may be symbolic he doesn't just
[23:03] stick to even what his big brother was
[23:05] doing
[23:05] there's something inside that says i
[23:07] have this unction and this feeling of
[23:08] faith
[23:09] based upon what what has been shared to
[23:11] me and what god is showing to me
[23:13] to offer a lamb an innocent lamb and
[23:15] sacrifice
[23:16] and so cain thought ceremony was enough
[23:18] but abel knew he needed to act by faith
[23:20] and did
[23:22] the bible says in hebrews 11 6 but
[23:24] without faith it is impossible to please
[23:25] him
[23:27] this stands for us today it's impossible
[23:29] to do things that please god
[23:31] unless faith is underneath it and
[23:34] that goes for anything that if there's
[23:37] not faith with it it doesn't please god
[23:39] without faith it is impossible to please
[23:41] him this is something
[23:42] that though we read it within the
[23:44] context of coming to god and believing
[23:46] that he is and believing that he's a
[23:47] rewarder this is a statement that stands
[23:49] on its own without faith it is
[23:51] impossible to do things that please him
[23:56] now cain's act of worship was not
[23:57] worthless in itself
[23:59] but since it was offered without faith
[24:01] it condemned him
[24:04] and there's a lot of theologians that
[24:06] debate on
[24:07] the the the fruit offering itself wasn't
[24:10] sinful
[24:11] uh and the offering of abel itself as a
[24:14] lamb was not even was
[24:15] was it more righteous and and you can
[24:17] see that just in the language that's
[24:19] used within the bible
[24:20] that's all the bible's dealing with the
[24:24] abel offered by faith cain didn't so
[24:27] what was it that made
[24:28] cain's offering uh displeasing it was
[24:30] the fact that he did not have faith in
[24:32] offering it
[24:33] and that's what condemned him that's why
[24:35] when he saw that god had respect
[24:37] unto abel's offering he was wroth and
[24:40] his countenance fell
[24:41] because he didn't have that confidence
[24:43] in the end that what he did was right
[24:46] because had cain offered by faith and
[24:48] abel offered by faith
[24:50] though it may look like abel gets all
[24:52] the recognition cain by faith would have
[24:54] been satisfied
[24:55] that his offering was enough because
[24:57] it's faith that pleases god
[24:59] and do you realize that's where we get
[25:01] pulled into situations and scenarios
[25:02] that are very very
[25:03] hard on us and tear us apart and life
[25:06] becomes very very confusing
[25:07] because someone acts by faith and god
[25:09] blesses their faithful acts
[25:11] and then you are torn well i don't know
[25:12] what to do just act
[25:14] in faith and even if it doesn't turn out
[25:16] the way theirs turned out
[25:18] you can only go by what you know is
[25:20] right
[25:22] you can only act in faith so as
[25:24] immediately cain is exposed
[25:26] when he saw that god had respect unto
[25:28] abel's offering his lack of faith was
[25:29] exposed
[25:30] in that his emotions began to stir up
[25:32] within him that he was angry
[25:33] and his countenance fallen he knew
[25:35] immediately he wasn't right in what he
[25:37] had done
[25:37] he knew that he had only acted out a
[25:39] ceremony he knew he had only acted
[25:40] out of a head knowledge the bible says
[25:43] in romans 14 23
[25:46] for whatsoever is not of faith is sin
[25:52] if you're not fully persuaded that it
[25:54] pleases god it condemns your conscience
[25:58] now you want to talk about simplifying
[25:59] life
[26:01] you want to talk about resolving
[26:02] paradoxes and get rid of complexes
[26:05] and avoiding scenarios that bind us and
[26:08] hold us down
[26:10] if you're not fully persuaded that it
[26:12] pleases god then your own to you it is
[26:14] sin
[26:17] without faith it is impossible to please
[26:19] him but then also for us whatever is not
[26:22] of faith is sin
[26:23] our conscience will condemn us if we
[26:25] know we're not acting fully persuaded
[26:27] that it pleases god
[26:29] and i want to focus on this at the
[26:31] beginning and highlight it because this
[26:33] is what i want you to see this pattern i
[26:35] want you to see it as we continue
[26:36] all the way to genesis chapter 12 and
[26:38] we're going to read every single verse
[26:40] very slowly at my hourly rate
[26:44] i want you to recognize this variance
[26:46] now in the beginning because this
[26:48] variance on the part of cain cannot be
[26:50] overlooked
[26:51] because once you could focus in on this
[26:53] and realize what cane did you have a
[26:55] shepherd and you have a farmer
[26:56] these are the two walks of life they're
[26:58] raising sheep they're growing corn
[27:00] they're raising sheep they're growing
[27:01] fruit they're raising sheep
[27:03] and they're growing herbs and and kane
[27:05] can always say i've got a lot more
[27:06] diversity in my field than yours and
[27:08] okay that's fine but they both
[27:09] one was a farmer one was a shepherd they
[27:11] both brought things to the table
[27:13] they participated in communal living and
[27:15] they had a promise that they were living
[27:16] for
[27:17] and according to that promise they
[27:18] offered up worship
[27:20] to the god who made the promise as an
[27:23] acknowledgment of his greatness and his
[27:24] power as a
[27:25] a as an act of sincerity within their
[27:28] hearts
[27:29] but now if we when we look at this this
[27:32] part
[27:32] of this act on cain's part this missing
[27:36] part
[27:37] and what what his act lacked so we want
[27:39] to call it his variance or his step away
[27:41] from something what he overlooked
[27:43] it highlights the complications of life
[27:45] even to this day
[27:46] it highlights what's wrong with religion
[27:48] and what's wrong with worship and what's
[27:50] wrong with so many different ways of
[27:51] trying to find god
[27:52] is because cain left something and his
[27:54] step away from this
[27:56] is what you can see in every single act
[27:58] of disobedience every single act of
[28:00] rebellion
[28:00] in every single complication that exists
[28:02] in life
[28:04] and so i want to focus on cain varied
[28:06] from
[28:08] this act in worship he varied from faith
[28:10] and immediately his lack of faith was
[28:12] exposed in his emotional state
[28:14] then god tells him well why are you
[28:16] angry why are you so upset cain
[28:21] that dynamic in itself is shocking
[28:25] god's still speaking to man god is still
[28:29] somehow communicating
[28:30] to cain so he said well then how did
[28:32] abel know to offer a lamb
[28:33] well how did cain know that what he
[28:35] offered was wrong
[28:37] god talked to him in whatever way he
[28:40] spoke in whatever way he communicated it
[28:41] says that god spoke
[28:42] and this is the question that god asked
[28:44] in verse 7 if thou
[28:46] doest well shalt thou not be accepted if
[28:49] thou doest not well sin
[28:50] lieth at the door that's the first part
[28:53] of that verse if thou do as well shalt
[28:55] not not be accepted
[28:56] if thou doest not well sin lieth at the
[28:58] door here god is bringing cain to the
[29:01] threshold of the promise
[29:04] he's telling him that there is something
[29:05] that you can do well there is a better
[29:07] way that what
[29:08] abel did was a more excellent sacrifice
[29:10] what abel did he did it by faith
[29:12] and he's telling cain if you do it the
[29:14] way that abel did it then you could be
[29:16] accepted
[29:18] he was giving cain the opportunity to
[29:20] receive something that could he could
[29:21] believe in
[29:23] if thou doest well that means well
[29:24] pleasing or to do good
[29:26] so it's not just merely doing the work
[29:28] but doing it right
[29:31] it's not just merely going through the
[29:32] motions and performing the act but doing
[29:34] it correctly
[29:35] he said so if you do it well you will be
[29:37] accepted as abel was accepted now in
[29:39] order to do it pleasing and to do it
[29:40] right
[29:41] cain would have to do it by faith so he
[29:43] said if you can do it by faith
[29:45] then you will be accepted he says but if
[29:46] you do not do it well if thou doest not
[29:49] well
[29:49] sin lieth at the door
[29:53] another sin is in your mind it's in your
[29:55] heart if you're not doing it by faith
[29:58] then sin lies at the door cain's
[30:01] conscience condemned him already and
[30:02] he's telling look
[30:03] if you don't do it by faith your
[30:04] conscience will condem you continue to
[30:06] condemn you he was already angry he had
[30:09] a fallen countenance he was already very
[30:10] roth when he saw that abel
[30:12] abel's offering was respected and it was
[30:14] because he lacked the faith in his own
[30:16] offering and god is saying as long as
[30:18] you act without faith you're going to
[30:20] remain in this condition
[30:21] sin life at the door it's right there at
[30:23] your heart sin lies there
[30:25] he knew he was wrong immediately even
[30:28] before god talked to him he knew he was
[30:29] wrong
[30:30] he knew he was wrong by the emotions he
[30:32] was feeling he knew he was wrong by the
[30:33] way he responded to his brother
[30:35] jealousy can't be right he knew these
[30:38] things were wrong so as god
[30:40] says sin lieth at the door there was
[30:42] actually two things that were set before
[30:44] him if thou
[30:45] doest dwell he was showing him the door
[30:47] of faith
[30:49] he was given him an opportunity to
[30:51] consider that there was something
[30:52] different than what he had been doing
[30:53] already that he could walk into and that
[30:55] he could receive and on the other hand
[30:56] you could keep doing what you're doing
[30:58] and sin is going to eat at your
[30:59] conscience
[31:00] and you're going to feel this
[31:01] condemnation all the time
[31:06] so there was doors that he could take
[31:09] choose your own adventure came
[31:12] do you want to take god at his word who
[31:13] says there's a way that you can do this
[31:15] right and there's a way that you can do
[31:16] this well
[31:18] or you just want to continue doing what
[31:19] you're doing
[31:22] and cain had opportunity in that moment
[31:25] to say
[31:26] well lord why was it that you respected
[31:29] abel's offering
[31:30] lord what is it that i must do to please
[31:33] you i offered in sincerity
[31:35] believing that it would please you if
[31:36] i'm wrong then lord what is it that i
[31:38] need to know what
[31:39] what can you share with me what can you
[31:41] show me could you give me some
[31:42] leadership could you give me some
[31:44] guidance could you show me the right way
[31:45] to take in this instance
[31:46] i'm not sure what to do versus what
[31:50] get angry and kill your brother
[31:53] you could almost take that that that
[31:56] that dynamic and impose it on many
[31:58] different instances that take place in
[32:00] our lives all the time
[32:01] humble yourself to god admit that you're
[32:03] wrong
[32:04] ask him to show you what's right or take
[32:06] a step back and start criticizing this
[32:08] other person and running them down and
[32:10] making up
[32:10] reasons why they're not doing the right
[32:12] thing and why they're this and why
[32:13] they're that
[32:14] and that's exactly what cain chose to do
[32:16] he chose jealousy he chose envy he chose
[32:18] murder
[32:20] all he did was make it more complicated
[32:24] because one moment he he offered the
[32:25] wrong sacrifice he's wrong
[32:29] and the the worst thing about being
[32:31] wrong is being wrong
[32:34] it's got a huge upside right as soon as
[32:37] you know you're wrong you can get right
[32:39] and to a member to a son or daughter of
[32:41] god to the bride there should be no fear
[32:43] in being wrong because if you find out
[32:45] you're wrong that's your opportunity to
[32:46] be right
[32:47] it's your opportunity to make things
[32:49] right it's your opportunity to say i'm
[32:50] sorry i made a mistake lord forgive me
[32:52] to whomever you would make that apology
[32:54] to
[32:54] and you get right so don't live in fear
[32:56] of finding out you're doing something
[32:58] wrong
[32:58] live say lord if i'm doing something
[33:00] wrong show me because i want to be right
[33:03] and so cain then further complicated
[33:06] life because now he's just didn't offer
[33:07] the wrong sacrifice and do it without
[33:09] faith not only was he just angry
[33:11] and jealous but now he's a murderer
[33:14] and and he and and obviously he's not
[33:16] thinking through just how much more
[33:17] complicated he's been yeah your little
[33:19] brother got a better
[33:20] grade and your little brother is more
[33:21] popular and your little brother gets
[33:23] more attention
[33:24] and you know sometimes you see this
[33:25] dynamic in twins where there's a twin
[33:27] that's more athletic
[33:28] more fun more funny and more even
[33:31] identical twins but the one twin could
[33:34] be more gregarious and outgoing and more
[33:35] accepted have more friends be more
[33:37] popular
[33:37] be more athletic and it creates a
[33:39] complex in the other twin
[33:41] and they grow up in an adult life and
[33:42] it's almost as if they've never gotten
[33:44] past eight years old when they lived in
[33:45] their twin shadow
[33:47] and so cain if he had looked at all the
[33:49] studies and
[33:50] and saw all the research they'd been
[33:52] doing in the universities at the time he
[33:53] could have been fearful that he was
[33:54] going to live in his brother's shadow
[33:55] the rest of his life
[33:57] but that would have been that's all that
[33:59] it would have been but instead he
[34:00] becomes a murderer now it gets really
[34:02] complicated
[34:03] and cain acknowledges it to in his
[34:05] response well now that i've shed blood
[34:06] i'm going to be hunted i'm going to be a
[34:07] miserable creature
[34:12] this is what happens when you leave
[34:13] faith
[34:15] this is what happens when you won't just
[34:16] humble yourself to the word of god
[34:18] and accept that its right
[34:21] so when god condemns cain he's worried
[34:23] that he's going to be hunted and
[34:25] but then god says in verse 12 genesis
[34:27] chapter 4 verse 12 when thou tillest the
[34:29] ground
[34:30] it shall not henceforth yield unto thee
[34:32] her strength
[34:35] cain when he was a farmer before as it
[34:37] said it came was a tiller of the ground
[34:39] he was gifted with the ground there was
[34:41] something that he did with the soil
[34:42] there was a knowledge he had
[34:43] an experience that he had where he knew
[34:45] how to plant and he knew how to
[34:47] uh to put in these rows and to sow these
[34:49] seeds he knew how to bring stuff
[34:51] out of the earth but now god is saying
[34:53] because you are a murderer because
[34:55] you've shed the blood of abel upon the
[34:57] ground
[34:57] the earth is no longer going to yield up
[34:59] her strength unto thee
[35:02] the earth was already cursed but now his
[35:04] labor was increased
[35:05] the earth being incursed and adam's
[35:07] labor already being multiplied now he's
[35:09] saying that the labor that comes upon
[35:11] you
[35:12] will and be increased and you will not
[35:14] be as fruitful as you were before
[35:17] we cannot even imagine what it was like
[35:19] in the garden
[35:21] we cannot even imagine what it would
[35:22] have been even in the fall because the
[35:24] ground we work with now is ground that
[35:25] cain made sure came forth
[35:28] it's a ground that was further cursed
[35:29] and cursed within humanity that whereas
[35:31] cain could get strength from the ground
[35:33] and there was a certain way that he
[35:34] could use the soil
[35:35] said something changes now with the
[35:37] curse that follows cain
[35:38] to where it's not going to be as
[35:39] fruitful for him as it was before
[35:42] and this is a direct result of
[35:44] disobedience
[35:46] this is a direct result of refusing to
[35:48] humble himself to the will of god
[35:50] so he had already put himself in a
[35:51] position to realize he's wrong and to be
[35:53] angry
[35:54] by not offering by faith but god said if
[35:56] you just do it by faith you'll be
[35:58] accepted
[35:58] and you could have said lord what can i
[36:00] do to please you what can i do in order
[36:02] to live by faith but instead he chose
[36:05] murder and he chose to slay his brother
[36:07] and in doing so he made a bigger mess by
[36:10] defying
[36:10] the will of god consciously going
[36:13] against
[36:14] and opposing the will of god
[36:18] and then it's cain's unrighteousness
[36:21] that continues in his descendants
[36:24] cain chose this fleshly gratification
[36:28] over the promise
[36:30] and the fleshly gratification of revenge
[36:33] the fleshly gratification of avenging
[36:36] himself of this jealousy and this hatred
[36:38] towards his brother
[36:38] that this uh coming back and getting
[36:41] back at abel for offering a better
[36:42] sacrifice
[36:43] this act of jealousy this act of rage
[36:46] even cain
[36:46] in offering the fruit of the ground
[36:48] could do it without sacrifice
[36:50] cain and offering the way that he
[36:52] offered there was it was not connected
[36:54] with faith it was not
[36:55] real obedience to the word of god so
[36:56] there's something within the way that
[36:58] cain
[36:59] thinks and now this i want you to notice
[37:01] this just using some brief scriptures
[37:03] how that this act of cain continues in
[37:05] his children
[37:07] choosing the flesh choosing the mind
[37:09] choosing the will of the flesh over the
[37:11] promise
[37:12] verse 16 of genesis chapter 4 we'll read
[37:14] verse 17 as well
[37:17] and cain went out from the presence of
[37:18] the lord and dwelt in the land of nod
[37:21] on the east of eden the land of nod
[37:23] whatever you do don't go there this
[37:24] morning
[37:27] but the land of god that word nod means
[37:28] aimless it means wondering
[37:30] no expectations cain went into the land
[37:33] of not it receives that designation
[37:35] because cain went
[37:36] without any promise cain went he was
[37:39] aimless
[37:40] he was wandering he he didn't know what
[37:42] the future would hold and not knowing
[37:43] what the future would hold not knowing
[37:45] that there was a place for him not
[37:46] knowing that there was anything that
[37:47] belonged to him
[37:48] he went aimless he just was wondering he
[37:50] had no expectations so cain goes
[37:52] from the presence of the lord think of
[37:55] that
[37:56] he left from the presence of the lord
[37:58] what distinguished the presence of
[37:59] that place where god was speaking
[38:02] the place where god was making his will
[38:04] known god speaks to king
[38:06] that's what cain was running from cain
[38:08] was wanting to run from the voice of god
[38:10] that made him conscious of his heir that
[38:12] made him conscious of the way that was
[38:13] right and made him conscious of the fact
[38:15] that he was not walking in it
[38:18] and so he went out from the presence of
[38:19] the lord to a place of aimless wondering
[38:22] and came to his wife and she conceived
[38:24] and bear enoch and he builded a city
[38:26] and called the name of the city after
[38:28] the name of his son enoch
[38:31] so he has a son he builds a city and
[38:33] calls it enoch city
[38:36] a city is a place that is guarded
[38:39] the very word that's used there is he
[38:41] builded a city a
[38:42] an encampment a place guarded by waking
[38:45] or by watch
[38:46] and the very word for city there from
[38:48] the root and the hebrew comes from
[38:50] excitement or
[38:51] terror now why did cain feel the need to
[38:54] build a city
[38:56] because of his dread because of his
[38:59] terror
[39:01] his motivation behind building a city
[39:03] was so that they could build up walls
[39:04] and have an encampment and do it in such
[39:06] a way for they could always be on watch
[39:08] for abe for his brothers always be on
[39:11] watch for man who would be out to take
[39:13] him because he shed innocent blood
[39:15] so now he's worried that the family is
[39:16] going to avenge themselves so he cannot
[39:18] just live
[39:19] peaceably in the wilderness he can't
[39:20] just go and find a place that's suitable
[39:22] for raising sheep and suitable for
[39:25] for growing crops he has to build an
[39:27] encampment and build a city which would
[39:29] have never been needed before
[39:31] never needed this kind of civilization
[39:33] but because of his fear because of his
[39:35] dread it means because of excitement or
[39:36] terror
[39:37] all because of his own sin all because
[39:39] of his own fears he had to build a city
[39:41] an
[39:41] enchantment which was waking and
[39:43] watching so they had to always be on
[39:45] guard
[39:48] stripped of contentment stripped of
[39:51] peace
[39:52] he had to devise ways to protect himself
[39:56] not being able to rest not being able to
[39:58] know that he could just work
[39:59] and put his shoulder to the plow and put
[40:02] his eye towards the line and look at his
[40:03] sheep he had to keep watching over his
[40:05] shoulder
[40:06] and because he couldn't have that peace
[40:08] he could not have that contentment
[40:10] he had to come up with ways to protect
[40:12] himself he had to devise ways to bring
[40:15] that sense of satisfaction
[40:18] because he lost it as
[40:22] as just as just a farmer he could farm
[40:24] and look to the promise
[40:25] farm and look to the promise but now
[40:27] that he was a murderer he had to farm
[40:29] and he'd lost sight of the promise and
[40:31] he had to worry about vengeance he had
[40:32] to worry about karma he had to worry
[40:34] about what was coming to get him so he
[40:35] could not just
[40:36] live life simply in getting things from
[40:38] the soil and using the things or at his
[40:41] at his disposal to sustain life and have
[40:43] children and tell them about a promise
[40:45] that god had made to his family many
[40:46] many years ago
[40:47] now he needs to protect himself and
[40:49] devise ways to protect himself
[40:50] and now he has to quiet the fear the
[40:52] condemnation and the wrath and the
[40:54] jealousy
[40:55] that he has within his heart so now he
[40:56] has to devise ways to silence that voice
[40:59] of conviction that's down in his heart
[41:03] he had to come up with some way to dole
[41:05] the fear to dole the conviction
[41:07] we're reading this from genesis 4 but
[41:09] can we get a hearty amen that that's
[41:11] today
[41:12] that's why mankind is so full of all the
[41:14] things he has today
[41:16] so you'll find in his progeny as his
[41:19] seed comes forth as his children are
[41:20] born and their children are born
[41:23] and as you contrast the two lineages of
[41:25] of seth and those of cain
[41:28] it's in kane's lineage that you find
[41:30] polygamy
[41:32] that you find more murder with lamech he
[41:34] was a polygamist he was a murderer
[41:36] and you see an expansion of civilization
[41:38] you see an expansion of certain sciences
[41:41] in verse 20 of genesis 4 6 4. it says
[41:44] jabel was father of those who made
[41:48] tents and raised cattle so this seems
[41:50] innocent enough it's a means of
[41:52] sustaining life it's one of the sons of
[41:53] lamech i believe
[41:54] and it's a pla you can get protection
[41:56] from it you can make tents
[41:58] uh you can you can get meat there's so
[42:00] many things in milk it was very
[42:02] simple maybe on this part of jabel but
[42:03] his brother jubal who shared the same
[42:05] mother he was the father of all as such
[42:07] as handle the harp and organ
[42:10] now see these are generations that come
[42:12] forth he says he was the father of those
[42:14] who made tents this was the father those
[42:16] that handled the harp and organ
[42:18] now you see musical instruments making
[42:20] their appearance
[42:21] and so yes you still had one who could
[42:23] be a farmer or be a
[42:24] sheep herder one who would be a shepherd
[42:26] one who'd be a cattleman
[42:27] but now there's these other things that
[42:29] are coming and families are being
[42:31] characterized by these instincts and
[42:33] these abilities and they're cultivating
[42:35] these skills
[42:36] and now jubal and his family he's the
[42:38] father of this whole
[42:39] family that comes forth that can handle
[42:41] the harp and the organ they're skilled
[42:43] in they're skilled in instruments these
[42:45] men are inventors
[42:48] even it says in verse 22 of tubal kane
[42:51] an instructor of every artificer
[42:53] in brass and i in iron which is they
[42:56] made weapons and they
[42:57] and they made armor and they could
[42:59] construct things by smelting and by
[43:01] welding and putting things together and
[43:02] they could get this ore that was in the
[43:04] earth and they could fashion these
[43:06] things
[43:06] whoever needed a weapon
[43:09] if all you were needed was a sheep
[43:11] farmer and all you needed
[43:12] what was uh was the the the contents
[43:15] from the soil
[43:16] but now they need armor they need
[43:17] weaponry these are inventors of
[43:20] instruments and
[43:21] warf weapons of warfare and this is in
[43:23] the seventh generation from king
[43:27] by the seventh generation is you have
[43:28] this great great great great grandson
[43:30] that comes forth of cain
[43:31] now they're inventors and they're
[43:33] devising different ways of entertaining
[43:35] themselves protecting themselves
[43:36] even offensive weapons to to kill and to
[43:38] hunt and to destroy
[43:40] and so within the lineage of cain you
[43:42] see great accomplishments and
[43:44] great advancements and even the
[43:45] polishing and refinement of skill
[43:47] you see it in music you see it in
[43:49] industry you see it in science you see
[43:50] it in knowledge
[43:51] and all these things are increasing yet
[43:53] sin is increasing
[43:55] so it's not that man is living righteous
[43:56] and these things are coming forth from
[43:58] righteous living
[43:58] but sin is increasing with polygamy and
[44:00] murder and they're devising more ways to
[44:03] do what to protect themselves
[44:05] and quiet that voice that keeps telling
[44:07] them you're getting away from something
[44:10] your great great great great great
[44:11] grandfather cain didn't worship by faith
[44:14] and that little step away from how he
[44:16] ought to have lived
[44:17] the one thing necessary he took one step
[44:19] away from that and now seventh gen
[44:20] seven generations later where is
[44:22] everything brother brother made
[44:24] an extraordinary observation and he says
[44:27] this and i believe it's in the 1950s it
[44:29] could have been an early 60s
[44:30] where he says in just 100 years or 50
[44:32] years at the time
[44:34] man has gone from a horse and buggy to a
[44:36] rocket ship to an astronaut
[44:37] now think about that in just five
[44:39] decades went from propelling themselves
[44:41] to natural horsepower that's where the
[44:43] term
[44:44] horsepower comes from for those that
[44:46] didn't realize that
[44:47] they drew themselves with with a
[44:49] carriage with a horse and buggy
[44:51] and mankind went from that as the
[44:53] primary means of transportation
[44:55] to where now there's a rocket ship
[44:57] taking men to the moon he says how did
[44:59] we get there he said man let loose of
[45:01] his faith in god
[45:02] and gave himself over to his own
[45:04] abilities
[45:07] is man able to do these things are men
[45:09] able to do these things
[45:11] yes man can do these great things
[45:15] but what let loose his power to do it
[45:16] when he left off just simply trusting in
[45:19] god
[45:20] just believing in god his simple faith
[45:22] in him as abel would have kept this
[45:24] righteous
[45:24] living and this faith in god if cain
[45:26] would have said well how did you do that
[45:27] how did
[45:28] this i don't understand how did that
[45:29] work he said well i just pray to ask god
[45:31] then god does the same thing for cain
[45:33] then man would have never varied from
[45:34] that
[45:36] if we could assume that had the woman
[45:37] never fell in the garden that all of us
[45:39] would have come forth in a perfect eden
[45:40] that it may be safe to assume that had
[45:43] there never been
[45:44] one step away from the faith and the
[45:46] promise then we would not have known all
[45:48] the things that we knew today
[45:50] but yet it was sown within the flesh of
[45:52] cain this weakness to where he could not
[45:54] humble himself to the word of god
[45:55] and again to accomplish god's objective
[45:57] here's one that can step
[45:59] outside of the promise and in doing so
[46:00] it lays this imprint and all of his
[46:02] progeny to where they're let loose of
[46:04] their faith in god they're no longer
[46:06] trusting god they're trusting their own
[46:07] ability and they can fashion instruments
[46:09] they can build great cities they can
[46:10] form weapons
[46:11] they can invent things they can devise
[46:13] things they can increase in all these
[46:14] industries but yet while they're doing
[46:16] it sin increases
[46:19] and we'll come to where the bible refers
[46:20] to that here in just a moment in genesis
[46:22] chapter 6
[46:24] but look at genesis chapter 4 verse
[46:25] 25-26
[46:27] all those things that we say about cain
[46:32] says and adam knew his wife again and
[46:33] she bear a son and called his name seth
[46:36] for god saith he she hath appointed me
[46:39] another seed instead of abel whom cain
[46:42] slew it's act even appointing her
[46:45] another seed instead of cain
[46:47] not only does it replace abel but it
[46:48] replaces cain and to seth to him
[46:51] also there was born a son and he called
[46:53] his name
[46:54] enos so here you have adam who has a son
[46:57] named seth
[46:58] seth has a son named enos and this is
[46:59] how we describe the sons of adam
[47:02] then begin men to call upon the name of
[47:04] the lord
[47:06] as we read about cain and his lineage
[47:08] they're inventing instruments and
[47:10] they're
[47:10] and they're building cities and they're
[47:12] crafting weapons and
[47:14] and they're coming up with this and
[47:15] they're coming up with that and let's
[47:16] just be honest if we wanted to hang out
[47:18] with the crowd
[47:19] like who do you want to go live with you
[47:20] want to live with enos you want to go
[47:22] live with
[47:22] jabel uh can i live with uncle jabel
[47:28] i want to hang out with jubal he's got
[47:30] instruments i want to go live with tubal
[47:32] kane he's got weapons and he's got a ps5
[47:34] there's all sorts of awesome things that
[47:36] they had in cain's lineage
[47:38] but how does it describe adam's family
[47:41] the the family of seth and enos then
[47:44] began men to call upon the name of the
[47:47] lord
[47:48] the sons of adam or the sons of god is
[47:50] what it's saying sought god
[47:52] then began men to call upon the name
[47:54] lord it could be written this way then
[47:55] sons of god begin to seek god and call
[47:58] on god
[47:59] the sons of adam were still connected to
[48:01] the promise
[48:03] whereas cain ran from the presence of
[48:05] the lord now they're not running from
[48:07] his presence but they're seeking it
[48:09] cain wanted to get as far away from it
[48:10] as possible i didn't want to hear what's
[48:12] right i don't want to hear god talking
[48:13] anymore
[48:14] i don't want to be challenged with what
[48:15] happened in genesis 3. i don't want to
[48:16] be challenged with what happened with my
[48:17] brother abel i just want to get away
[48:19] from here where are you going i don't
[48:20] know i'm just wondering
[48:21] i want to go i got to build a city i
[48:22] want to raise children and they give
[48:24] themselves over and over and over
[48:25] towards seven generations later they
[48:27] have a family
[48:28] of instrument makers they have a family
[48:30] of of weapon makers they have a great
[48:32] big huge
[48:33] civilization with this big thriving
[48:35] economy but god is nowhere in their
[48:37] conscience
[48:38] but now with enos and his sons and as it
[48:40] begins to come forth
[48:41] these men begin to call upon the name of
[48:43] the lord
[48:44] not running from the promise seeking the
[48:46] promise
[48:48] and established an unbroken rule that
[48:50] you can
[48:51] take from this very moment in genesis
[48:52] chapter 4 within the very shadows of the
[48:55] fall of genesis 3 that despite the fall
[48:57] men could still seek god's presence or
[49:00] disregard it
[49:02] you could not just make the excuse well
[49:03] now that we've been banished from the
[49:05] garden they've sealed up the way to the
[49:06] tree of life
[49:07] no no no you couldn't use that as an
[49:08] excuse because god said one day i'll
[49:10] bring a man that'll take you back to
[49:11] that tree of life
[49:12] and so you had a you god had put it
[49:14] before you to choose
[49:16] life to choose blessing to choose to
[49:18] deliver to choose the promise and i'm
[49:20] going to choose to live by the promise
[49:21] and i choose to live by faith
[49:23] and somehow that's going to be
[49:24] foundational somehow that's going to be
[49:26] headship
[49:26] somehow this is going to be what leads
[49:28] me and guides me within the confines of
[49:30] everything else my life has but cain ran
[49:32] away from that so it establishes an
[49:34] unbroken principle that even though
[49:36] mankind had fallen
[49:37] you could choose to seek god's presence
[49:39] or you could disregard it
[49:44] and cain's descendants departed further
[49:46] and further and further from the
[49:47] righteousness that god had intended for
[49:49] man
[49:50] cain as he would have married his
[49:52] half-sister and begin to have children
[49:54] that line becomes even more entrenched
[49:56] in that way of thinking more entrenched
[49:58] in just releasing their their their
[49:59] human talents their human gifts and
[50:01] giving themselves over to what they
[50:03] think and what they feel and by the
[50:04] seventh generation you have polygamy and
[50:06] you have murder
[50:08] but then in the line of seth genesis
[50:10] chapter 5 verse 24 and enoch walked with
[50:12] god
[50:13] and he was not for god took them
[50:17] think of the difference between the
[50:18] seventh generation from adam
[50:20] through seth and the seventh generation
[50:22] from cain
[50:24] or even the seventh generation from adam
[50:26] through kane if you wanted to number it
[50:27] that way lamech
[50:28] a polygamist and a murderer but the
[50:31] seventh generation from cain
[50:32] is all sorts of inventors and divisors
[50:34] of different things and so you have the
[50:36] seventh generation from adam what is
[50:38] this guy doing
[50:38] he's walking with god in such a pleasing
[50:41] way to where god's like i don't want to
[50:42] share you with anybody
[50:45] walking so pleasing with god but god was
[50:47] so in love
[50:48] with the with enoch for these 365 years
[50:51] where he was so
[50:52] moved by the way that enoch lived how he
[50:54] was so dedicated to the promise
[50:56] so dedicated to the things that he
[50:58] understood the things that he knew and
[50:59] he so sought god that god took the
[51:01] seventh generation from adam and he took
[51:03] him and caused him to go on a rapture
[51:05] cause him to go into translation so that
[51:07] he would serve as a reminder to those of
[51:09] us who live in the seventh church age
[51:11] that there's a way that we can live and
[51:13] conduct ourselves 365 days a year
[51:15] in such a way that god plea is so
[51:17] pleased to one day take us home
[51:22] it's remarkable just to think of that
[51:24] and the historians from josephus and the
[51:26] different other other writers and
[51:28] commentators especially within
[51:29] the jewish tradition and oral history in
[51:31] written history they believe that adam
[51:33] and eve if you look at the lineages and
[51:35] how long
[51:35] adam lived adam was talking to these
[51:38] sons
[51:40] adam talked with seth adam talked with
[51:43] enos
[51:44] adam talked with enoch and enoch was
[51:47] catching a revelation
[51:49] of what adam was telling him what life
[51:50] was like in genesis 1 and 2.
[51:53] he was catching a revelation of all the
[51:54] promises of god he was telling him maybe
[51:56] one day
[51:57] adam told him said enoch i don't know if
[52:00] i've ever shared this with anybody
[52:01] before
[52:03] but you know that word that god gave us
[52:04] in the beginning
[52:06] he gave us a word that would take us
[52:08] from eden all the way to a body change
[52:10] in two
[52:11] to meet god without facing death can you
[52:14] believe that enoch he gave me a word
[52:16] that if we would have lived by it it
[52:18] would have taken us all the way from
[52:20] eden into the rapture
[52:21] and he never says that ain't nothing but
[52:24] the truth adam
[52:25] i believe that that is true and he just
[52:28] lived by that he talked with god
[52:29] and it so please god that enoch would
[52:31] have a simple faith towards the promise
[52:33] he walked with god and he was not for
[52:35] god took them that's the difference
[52:36] between the seven generations and the
[52:38] generations of the sons of adam who
[52:40] begin to call upon god and seek god
[52:42] in the seventh generation from cain who
[52:44] begin to devise more ways to protect
[52:46] themselves
[52:47] and to dull the consciousness of a god
[52:48] that was above it all
[52:52] we're not going to read all of genesis 5
[52:53] but we'll make reference to it genesis
[52:55] chapter 5 gives us the lineage of adam
[52:58] giving us the lin these are the
[52:59] generations of adam that's kind of
[53:00] walking us through what these
[53:02] these generations as he in the day that
[53:03] he created the heavens and the earth
[53:05] and these are the generations and it
[53:06] talks about how long seth lived and how
[53:08] each one lived and we could follow all
[53:09] these descendants of enos and canaan
[53:11] and all the way down to uh to lamech to
[53:15] noah
[53:15] and we come to noah and that's where
[53:17] genesis chapter 5 ends is with noah
[53:21] and it says this in genesis chapter 6
[53:24] verses 1 to 3. it says and it came to
[53:27] pass when men began to multiply in the
[53:29] face of the earth and daughters were
[53:30] born unto them
[53:31] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[53:33] of men that they were fair and they took
[53:35] them wives of all which they chose
[53:37] and the lord said my spirit shall not
[53:39] always strive with man for that he also
[53:41] is flesh yet his days shall be 120 years
[53:47] i'm not saying it is but could it be
[53:51] no one lives above 120 really when you
[53:54] look at how many in the last
[53:55] 200 years that they can keep track of
[53:57] how long people are living one person
[53:59] has lived i believe above 120 lived 122
[54:01] years old
[54:03] and and maybe so maybe it's a little bit
[54:04] of a soft ceiling there
[54:06] but god's base said hey you know what
[54:09] you could pretty much
[54:10] fix it there's going to come a time
[54:12] where man's not going to be living much
[54:14] beyond 120.
[54:17] and now he's saying this in a very very
[54:20] heavy words
[54:21] let's just start with verse 3. he says
[54:24] my spirit shall not always strive with
[54:26] man god is declaring that the entirety
[54:28] of mankind has become
[54:30] severed from him my spirit shall not
[54:33] always strive with men
[54:34] it's it's implying that maybe god's
[54:36] spirit is dealing with
[54:38] man but man is no longer dealing with
[54:40] god
[54:41] man has no longer opened himself up to
[54:43] god's spirit dealing with him this is
[54:44] what cain ran from he ran from the
[54:46] presence of the lord he built cities and
[54:47] encampments and they devised inventions
[54:49] and distractions and everything to do
[54:50] what
[54:51] to keep the spirit of god from striving
[54:53] with them so god is saying man is
[54:54] closing himself off from me so that my
[54:56] spirit cannot deal with him i will not
[54:58] always be striving with man for that he
[55:00] also
[55:00] is flesh that's a very very heavy word
[55:04] if you think about it because wouldn't
[55:05] we just say
[55:06] haven't they always been haven't they
[55:09] always been flesh
[55:10] but mankind had so lost focus of the
[55:13] promise he says my spirit will not
[55:14] always strive with men
[55:15] they lost focus of the promise and now
[55:17] he's saying he is flesh he no longer has
[55:19] an infinity or a connection to god
[55:21] even within his flesh there's been
[55:24] something that has taken place where
[55:25] he's become corrupted he's become
[55:27] degraded he has entirely lost the image
[55:29] that adam had in the beginning
[55:31] the image that adam even retained that
[55:33] he passed down to his sons it says in
[55:34] genesis 5 3
[55:36] and adam lived 130 years and begat a son
[55:38] in his own likeness after his image
[55:40] and called his name seth
[55:45] verse 1 it told us that adam was made in
[55:47] the likeness of god
[55:49] so whatever adam had he passed to his
[55:51] descendants
[55:52] so as adam as having children this image
[55:55] that still remained within mankind
[55:57] is being passed that's why when you get
[55:58] to enos the great grandson
[56:01] the grandson of of of adam he's
[56:04] he's calling upon god and these sons
[56:06] that come down
[56:07] the sons of god the sons of adam they're
[56:09] still caught upon god
[56:10] seventh generation still calling upon
[56:12] god taken away in a rapture why they're
[56:14] connected to the promise there's been
[56:16] something passed down there's something
[56:18] there's a nurture by the words that
[56:20] adam's using to deal with that nature
[56:22] that adam had imparted to his children
[56:24] where they could walk in a way that was
[56:26] pleasing to god they were willing to
[56:27] seek after god they are willing to have
[56:29] his spirit strive with them
[56:31] josephus wrote this it is said of seth
[56:33] and his posterity
[56:35] that they were very good and virtuous
[56:37] and very happy
[56:38] without any considerable misfortunes for
[56:40] seven generations
[56:43] it was said of seth and his children
[56:45] that they were very good they were very
[56:46] virtuous they lived very happy lives
[56:48] and they did not suffer calamities did
[56:50] not suffer misfortunes and they did so
[56:52] for seven generations
[56:55] but how does genesis chapter six open up
[56:58] it opens up by describing how the sons
[56:59] of adam begin to mix with the lineage of
[57:01] cain
[57:03] the sons of god saw the daughters of men
[57:05] that they were fair
[57:07] the sons of adam began to see the women
[57:09] that were born into the lineage of cain
[57:11] and they begin to say these are very
[57:13] beautiful women they begin to see what
[57:14] cain's seed had to offer
[57:15] they began to see this other
[57:17] civilization that was sprouting up
[57:18] around him there's other people
[57:19] that were coming in close to him and
[57:21] verse two describes how the godly
[57:23] descendants of seth
[57:24] intermarried with the ungodly
[57:26] descendants of cain
[57:28] and what began to happen as the line of
[57:31] seth begin to marry with the line of
[57:33] cain
[57:33] immorality increases violence increases
[57:35] witness wickedness increases
[57:37] that's exponentially increasing why
[57:39] because man no longer has it within his
[57:41] nature
[57:42] to hinder this wickedness that's being
[57:44] sown into his flesh
[57:48] so by the time you get to verse 5
[57:51] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[57:53] was great in the earth
[57:54] and every imagination of the thoughts of
[57:57] his heart was only evil continually
[57:59] now all of society is corrupt
[58:03] wickedness had increased to the point
[58:04] where now all of humanity is united in
[58:07] desire they're united in the pursuit of
[58:09] ungodly things
[58:10] god looks at mankind all of humanity and
[58:12] he says
[58:13] they are only imagining evil
[58:16] they're not thinking about the promise
[58:19] they've completely forgot about what
[58:21] adam's been trying to say all these
[58:22] years
[58:23] that i made a promise in genesis 3. god
[58:25] they've forgotten the symbolism of the
[58:27] sacrifice in the garden they've
[58:28] forgotten the symbolism and what
[58:30] abel's blood was speaking they've gotten
[58:32] so far away from that as the
[58:33] intermarrying they begin to mix with the
[58:34] line of cane
[58:35] that now this this habit of cain is sown
[58:38] into the flesh of all mankind where
[58:40] they're living apart from the promise
[58:41] they're holy
[58:42] wicked they're holy corrupt and god's
[58:44] assessment of them
[58:45] is it so great that every imagination
[58:48] in every in other words all of them
[58:53] if they have a billion thoughts he's
[58:54] saying they're all evil
[58:56] what faith is missing faith was lacking
[59:00] this this variance of cain in the
[59:02] beginning one step away
[59:04] from faith what does it result in
[59:05] there's a absence of any no
[59:07] acknowledgement of god there's an
[59:08] absence of any consciousness of god it's
[59:10] only evil continuing
[59:12] and now all of humanity is united in
[59:13] this pursuit
[59:15] of ungodly things and what are they able
[59:16] to accomplish civilization
[59:18] science technologies even the building
[59:21] of the pyramids and things that they say
[59:22] even now
[59:23] would be a technologically a challenge
[59:25] to do
[59:28] and the perfection of those things and
[59:29] their alignment and how that it's done
[59:32] even with respect to the stars and every
[59:34] that the things that man was
[59:35] accomplished in the days of nowhere far
[59:36] beyond what we could even grasp what was
[59:38] able they were able to do at that time
[59:39] because man had let loose of his faith
[59:41] in god and given himself over
[59:43] completely to the flesh to the point
[59:45] where god says
[59:46] i'm going to destroy all mankind
[59:50] i'm going to wipe them all off the face
[59:51] of the earth
[59:53] now if someone had said well
[59:54] pre-adventure god if you could just find
[59:55] 15 righteous would you save it god would
[59:57] say
[59:58] i don't think you're listening to me
[59:59] buddy there's not 15.
[1:00:02] well what if you could find 10 hey sorry
[1:00:04] i know there's not 10.
[1:00:06] the bible says in genesis 6 11 to 12 the
[1:00:08] earth also was corrupt before god
[1:00:10] and the earth was filled with violence
[1:00:12] and god looked upon the earth and behold
[1:00:14] it was corrupt
[1:00:15] for all flesh had corrupted his way upon
[1:00:18] the earth
[1:00:19] this was man's doing this is the doing
[1:00:22] of those men who once called upon god
[1:00:23] and even josephus and some of the jewish
[1:00:25] historians
[1:00:26] say it was right about this time in
[1:00:27] adam's lineage that certain sons began
[1:00:29] to cross over
[1:00:30] and begin to marry with the children of
[1:00:33] with cain
[1:00:34] and as they began to do it it deluded
[1:00:35] their convictions it deluded their
[1:00:37] consciousness of a promise
[1:00:38] it brought them more into civilization
[1:00:40] it brought them more into the ways of
[1:00:41] cain it brought them more into being
[1:00:43] flesh to when god says
[1:00:44] all man is flesh he's saying they're no
[1:00:47] longer adam like
[1:00:49] they're cane-like they're no longer
[1:00:52] perfect to adam
[1:00:54] they have this mixed blood this hybrid
[1:00:56] blood with the blood of cain
[1:00:57] and because they're mixed blood and
[1:00:58] hybrid they're all completely corrupt
[1:01:00] the whole earth is caught the earth is
[1:01:02] filled with violence because of him and
[1:01:03] he says
[1:01:03] this all flesh has corrupted his way
[1:01:05] upon earth this was man's doing
[1:01:08] he's also wondered after cain's
[1:01:10] wondering
[1:01:12] he's now consumed with the same sins of
[1:01:15] cain
[1:01:17] and listen how jesus says in luke
[1:01:18] chapter 17 verses 26 to 30
[1:01:21] and as it was in the days of noah so
[1:01:22] shall it also be in the days of the son
[1:01:24] of man
[1:01:25] so god is going to call out the days of
[1:01:27] noah hit them where it hurts god
[1:01:30] go ahead get them tell us what they were
[1:01:31] doing all their wicked violence god said
[1:01:33] they were
[1:01:34] every imagination of their thoughts were
[1:01:35] evil continually the whole earth was
[1:01:37] corrupt the earth was filled with
[1:01:38] violence
[1:01:39] tell us jesus tell us about their
[1:01:40] violence they did eat they drank they
[1:01:42] married wives
[1:01:43] they were given in marriage wait hold on
[1:01:45] no no i want i want to get the dirt
[1:01:48] come on tell me give give me the give me

[1:01:54] days
[1:01:55] just wrong until just tell me the truth
[1:01:56] i can handle it tell me everything they
[1:01:58] were doing and jesus basically
[1:01:59] no that's that's where the sin was
[1:02:02] the sin wasn't in the violence the sin
[1:02:04] wasn't in the murder the sin was in all
[1:02:06] the other things but the sin
[1:02:07] first originated in what they're doing
[1:02:09] here they did eat they drank they
[1:02:10] married wives they were given in
[1:02:11] marriage until the day that noah entered
[1:02:13] into the ark and the flood came and
[1:02:14] destroyed them all
[1:02:15] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:02:16] lot wherein god abraham pleaded lord if
[1:02:19] you could just find 15 righteous will
[1:02:21] you spare it
[1:02:22] and he couldn't find it so today when we
[1:02:24] talk about
[1:02:25] sodom and gomorrah and we use phrases to
[1:02:27] describe certain acts that are related
[1:02:28] to
[1:02:29] the sodom and these this awful filthy
[1:02:32] perverted
[1:02:32] horrible cities as described in the
[1:02:34] bible here's jesus opportunity to give

[1:02:43] their relationships their physical
[1:02:45] relations right that's what made them
[1:02:46] awful and
[1:02:47] filthy and that's what made him putrid
[1:02:48] in the eyes of god so jesus is going to
[1:02:50] tell us the real dirt

[1:03:17] but think about it just describing what
[1:03:19] we do every day
[1:03:21] it's just sunday and we've already eaten
[1:03:23] we've already drank some people are
[1:03:24] getting married tomorrow others are
[1:03:25] gonna buy and
[1:03:26] sell and plant and build but the same
[1:03:28] day that lot went out of sodom it rained
[1:03:29] fire
[1:03:30] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[1:03:32] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[1:03:33] in the day
[1:03:34] when the son of man is revealed i want
[1:03:37] you to recognize that jesus when he
[1:03:38] wants to call out the depravity of the
[1:03:40] days of noah the depravity of the days
[1:03:42] of lord he rever
[1:03:43] he's pointing out their lifestyle of
[1:03:45] consumption
[1:03:47] he's identifying that they had a certain
[1:03:49] way of satisfying themselves that
[1:03:51] satisfaction was a way of life
[1:03:53] synthetizing the flesh was the way of
[1:03:54] life and what's more amazing is jesus
[1:03:57] doesn't make
[1:03:57] mention of the evil that we think he
[1:03:59] should mention because the evil isn't
[1:04:01] what was lacking
[1:04:03] they had no faith in god that was the
[1:04:05] evil
[1:04:06] jesus that's all they did and even if
[1:04:09] they never did anything else as cain
[1:04:11] they if they would have just been
[1:04:13] farmers but if they lacked faith
[1:04:15] that is displeasing to god that was the
[1:04:17] evil look at the accumulation of evil
[1:04:19] through seven generations by the time
[1:04:20] you get to genesis chapter six
[1:04:22] man is holy evil what because they left
[1:04:25] off believing
[1:04:26] in god and if it can happen over
[1:04:28] thousands of years to the point where
[1:04:30] you get over 2 000 years to where we get
[1:04:32] to genesis chapter 6
[1:04:33] and you can see this kind of
[1:04:34] accumulation of sin and this evil that
[1:04:36] would accumulate to this point
[1:04:37] to where mankind is holy evil you think
[1:04:40] well good thing i'm only going to live
[1:04:41] about 120 years no this can accumulate
[1:04:43] by minute
[1:04:44] by a day by hour by day by week by month
[1:04:47] by year in our own personal lives
[1:04:52] jesus didn't mention the adultery the
[1:04:53] fornication the sexual perversions and
[1:04:56] all these other things the murder
[1:04:57] and the evil continually and all those
[1:04:59] different things because the evil was
[1:05:01] merely in what was lacking they did not
[1:05:03] have faith in god
[1:05:04] see it wasn't even a divided pursuit it
[1:05:07] wasn't like man was calling upon god and
[1:05:09] wrestling with sin and calling upon god
[1:05:11] in wrestling with the temptations of
[1:05:12] cain's seed and calling upon god
[1:05:14] and really wanting to hang out with
[1:05:15] tubal cain's daughter it wasn't like
[1:05:17] that they weren't even thinking about
[1:05:18] right what was righteous anymore they
[1:05:20] weren't even divided in their pursuits
[1:05:21] mankind had become holy flesh
[1:05:23] by their own doing by mixing themselves
[1:05:25] with the world they didn't even look for
[1:05:27] genesis 3 15.
[1:05:29] if you would even went up to one of them
[1:05:31] said did you know that god
[1:05:33] promised to send us a help that god was
[1:05:36] gonna
[1:05:37] god's gonna send a man one day a man
[1:05:39] born of a woman and
[1:05:40] it's gonna crush is gonna remin change
[1:05:42] all this and take out this evilness and
[1:05:44] this adultery and this polygamy and all
[1:05:45] this nasty stuff and they say
[1:05:47] where did you get that from yeah well
[1:05:50] which god
[1:05:52] which god are you talking about oh well
[1:05:54] that's just mythology and we've been
[1:05:56] inventing these stories
[1:05:57] listen man these are just stories we've
[1:05:59] come up with that we could talk about
[1:06:00] when we get high
[1:06:03] you know your great-great-great uncle
[1:06:04] ate something really crazy one day and
[1:06:06] shared these stories and now we're still
[1:06:07] telling them all these many years later
[1:06:09] it was nothing to them anymore
[1:06:14] genesis chapter 7 verse 1.
[1:06:18] in the middle of all this
[1:06:21] had there not been one god would have
[1:06:22] destroyed the whole earth it seems
[1:06:25] in genesis chapter 7 verse 1 and the
[1:06:26] lord said unto noah
[1:06:30] come down all thy house into the ark for
[1:06:31] thee have i seen righteous before me in
[1:06:33] this generation
[1:06:36] in other words noah only in you
[1:06:39] you're the only one in all the earth do
[1:06:41] i see righteousness
[1:06:43] not even in his wife not in his sons
[1:06:46] he says only in thee have i seen
[1:06:49] righteous before me
[1:06:50] in these generations if you see in
[1:06:52] genesis chapter 6 verse 9 these are the
[1:06:54] generations of noah
[1:06:55] noah was a just man and perfect in his
[1:06:59] generations
[1:07:00] and noah walked with god
[1:07:05] he descended perfectly from seth he's
[1:07:07] perfect in his generations
[1:07:08] there's no unrighteous image in within
[1:07:11] him when he says he's perfect in his
[1:07:12] generations that means noah can be
[1:07:14] traced all the way back to adam
[1:07:15] and you won't find any seed of cain
[1:07:18] being mixed in
[1:07:20] that's exactly what the bible's saying
[1:07:21] he is a just man perfect in his
[1:07:23] generations
[1:07:24] he can say i am a son of adam i am a son
[1:07:27] of righteousness
[1:07:28] i am a son of god i go all the way back
[1:07:30] to adam he descended perfectly from seth
[1:07:32] who descended from adam there's no cane
[1:07:34] mixed in him there's none of the hybrid
[1:07:35] blood mix in him and he can say that he
[1:07:37] is perfect in his generations
[1:07:39] and that's why god said he was a just
[1:07:41] man he says in thee
[1:07:42] only have i seen righteousness in all
[1:07:44] the generations canoa because noah could
[1:07:46] still
[1:07:46] hear adam tell them about the promise
[1:07:50] noah still sought god noah still
[1:07:52] believed in god and there's many that
[1:07:54] speculate that noah recognized and
[1:07:55] realized that he was the only one left
[1:07:57] on the earth who had not mixed himself
[1:07:59] with the blood
[1:08:00] of cain's seed and that's why he waited
[1:08:02] so late in life to even get married
[1:08:04] because he married very very very late
[1:08:06] in life for a man i mean like something
[1:08:08] like 19 years old right
[1:08:10] now i mean they're talking about
[1:08:11] hundreds of years old before he ever
[1:08:12] gets married which was rare for them
[1:08:14] in those days and some speculate perhaps
[1:08:17] noah was just he did not see a virtuous
[1:08:19] woman he did not see a woman he would
[1:08:21] like to marry there was none left think
[1:08:23] about how sad of a day it would be
[1:08:25] if there was no daughters of adam left
[1:08:27] to marry
[1:08:32] he says he was a just man
[1:08:35] we know the just live by faith
[1:08:39] it says in hebrews 11 7 by faith noah
[1:08:42] being warned of god are things not seen
[1:08:43] as yet
[1:08:44] moved with fear prepared an ark for the
[1:08:46] saving of his house
[1:08:48] by the which he condemned the world and
[1:08:49] became the heir of righteousness
[1:08:51] which is by faith so however many
[1:08:54] millions and billions of people that you
[1:08:56] could estimate there were upon the face
[1:08:58] of the earth there was one man who
[1:08:59] remained righteous
[1:09:00] god himself said there's one man in thee
[1:09:02] have i seen righteousness before me
[1:09:04] and you alone you're the only one that's
[1:09:06] perfect in your generations
[1:09:07] you're the only one who still remains
[1:09:09] yet who has not mixed himself with the
[1:09:11] ungodly seed you're the only one left
[1:09:13] still upon earth who calls upon me
[1:09:15] who worships me who still thinks of the
[1:09:17] promise
[1:09:18] and as you imagine genesis chapter six
[1:09:20] just think of how far it had fallen
[1:09:23] from a shepherd and a farmer
[1:09:27] and just two chapters and really genesis
[1:09:30] chapter five is just kind of trying to
[1:09:31] give us background to how we get to noah
[1:09:33] but god's whole point
[1:09:34] is you went from abel who who
[1:09:37] tended the sheep and cain who tilled the
[1:09:40] ground
[1:09:41] and essentially the very next time he
[1:09:43] begins to describe the actions of man
[1:09:45] it's genesis chapter six
[1:09:47] genesis chapter 4 to genesis chapter 6
[1:09:50] look at how far had fallen
[1:09:52] the passing of time increased the
[1:09:54] complications increased the chaos
[1:09:57] and what caused it the ghost of the
[1:09:59] original sin
[1:10:01] still haunting humanity not content to
[1:10:05] seek god not content to rest in his
[1:10:07] promises
[1:10:07] not content to keep his word they had to
[1:10:09] devise other ways to make sense of the
[1:10:11] world
[1:10:13] mythology religion science
[1:10:16] all the things that have been the
[1:10:17] disciplines that we even enjoyed the
[1:10:19] fruit of today
[1:10:20] many of them in their genesis were ways
[1:10:22] to number one protect themselves against
[1:10:24] the
[1:10:25] fears and the concerns that mankind has
[1:10:29] because of cain's actions in genesis 4
[1:10:31] and also to silence the conviction to
[1:10:33] rationalize with eternity to try to
[1:10:35] figure out why we're all here instead of
[1:10:37] just taking god at his word
[1:10:39] the word that would have survived the
[1:10:41] garden by adam teaching these children
[1:10:43] for hundreds of years telling his
[1:10:46] grandson
[1:10:47] his grandson his great-grandson his
[1:10:49] great-great-grandson
[1:10:50] sharing with him this is what god said
[1:10:52] this is what the word of god says
[1:10:54] and they would have had something to
[1:10:55] live by how else do you have a man of
[1:10:58] such integrity such as job
[1:11:01] if there was an opportunity to live
[1:11:02] simply before god though he was a man of
[1:11:04] great means
[1:11:05] a man of many friends and a man of many
[1:11:07] children and he had a lot of wealth but
[1:11:08] yet he had this conviction in his heart
[1:11:11] to serve god and even pre-adventure that
[1:11:13] his children may be sinning
[1:11:14] he offered up sacrifice on their behalf
[1:11:16] what was he doing he was acknowledging
[1:11:18] that god there is going to be
[1:11:20] a provided way god i can in the midst of
[1:11:23] commerce and
[1:11:24] community and civilization and science
[1:11:26] and friendship and all these religions
[1:11:28] i'm still holding fast my integrity that
[1:11:30] what you say is truth what you do is
[1:11:32] just
[1:11:33] that you made a promise in one day oh
[1:11:35] god one day
[1:11:36] i will stand upon the earth with my
[1:11:38] deliverer
[1:11:40] day i will see my redeemer what was he
[1:11:42] quoting from genesis 3
[1:11:45] who was he quoting adam what was he
[1:11:47] quoting by faith
[1:11:50] but this ghost of the original sin
[1:11:52] drives mankind to the place
[1:11:55] toward genesis chapter 11 they say hey
[1:11:58] let's go make brick
[1:11:59] this is after the flood now i need to do
[1:12:01] this very quickly
[1:12:03] very very very very very very very very
[1:12:06] very very very quickly
[1:12:08] let's go make brick let's burn them they
[1:12:10] come up a way where
[1:12:11] they had invented these kilns to to
[1:12:14] harden to make it even harder he says
[1:12:15] we'll use this
[1:12:17] uh brick for stone and slime from order
[1:12:19] they were inventive and genius they're
[1:12:21] already getting back
[1:12:22] in the groove again and how they can
[1:12:23] build and they say go two verse four
[1:12:25] let us build us a city and a tower whose
[1:12:29] top may reach unto heaven
[1:12:30] and let us make us a name out of pride
[1:12:34] out of selfish ambition they want to
[1:12:35] erect a monument to glorify themselves
[1:12:38] not god cain built an altar to glorify
[1:12:41] god it was altered though he was sincere
[1:12:43] in his worship
[1:12:43] he was sincerely wrong and god said cain
[1:12:45] if you do well will you not be accepted
[1:12:47] cain at least built it to glorify god
[1:12:48] now mankind is so severely deluded they
[1:12:51] want to build a monument a million times
[1:12:53] bigger
[1:12:53] and exponentially than what cain offered
[1:12:56] but now it's not to glorify god but it's
[1:12:57] to defy god
[1:12:59] glorify themselves not god
[1:13:04] they said lest we be scattered abroad
[1:13:07] upon the face of the whole earth
[1:13:09] they were united to build a city to make
[1:13:11] a name for themselves and keep
[1:13:12] themselves from being scattered
[1:13:14] and josephus says it was done in
[1:13:15] disobedience to god's command to
[1:13:17] replenish the earth
[1:13:19] god wants us to disperse god told noah
[1:13:22] to multiply
[1:13:22] and replenish and the thought behind
[1:13:24] what noah was telling his sons and
[1:13:26] telling his children disperse replenish
[1:13:27] go
[1:13:28] go out don't do like kane did
[1:13:31] go replenish the whole earth branch out
[1:13:33] expand go expand
[1:13:34] and they said no instead of we're not
[1:13:36] going to go in defiance to the word in
[1:13:38] defiance to the message that god had
[1:13:40] given noah they said no
[1:13:41] in disobedience to his command and in
[1:13:43] absence to god we're going to defeat his
[1:13:45] will
[1:13:46] let's build a tower so it can just keep
[1:13:48] spiraling higher and higher and higher
[1:13:50] so that we don't even have to branch out
[1:13:53] just build a city that reaches into
[1:13:55] heaven
[1:13:57] we'll see if he wants to flood the earth
[1:13:58] let's see how high he can get the water
[1:14:00] next time
[1:14:01] so we'll build a spiral into heaven
[1:14:04] and it says in verse 5 and the lord came
[1:14:06] down to see the city and the tower when
[1:14:08] the children of men
[1:14:09] they're all flesh now they're the sons
[1:14:11] of adam they're the children of men
[1:14:13] he said all flesh has become corrupted
[1:14:14] man is corrupted his way
[1:14:16] completely corrupt his weather now it's
[1:14:18] the children of men
[1:14:19] not sons of god and the lord said behold
[1:14:21] the people is one and they have all one
[1:14:23] language and this they begin to do
[1:14:24] now nothing will be restrained from them
[1:14:26] which they have imagined to do
[1:14:29] why because they've given themselves
[1:14:30] over to the flesh
[1:14:33] and they're not thinking about the
[1:14:34] promise
[1:14:37] so he says let's go down verse seven go
[1:14:39] to let us go down there confound their
[1:14:41] language that they may not understand
[1:14:42] one another's speech
[1:14:44] so the lord scattered them abroad from
[1:14:46] fence upon the face of all the earth
[1:14:48] and they left off to build the city
[1:14:52] this is the condition of humanity as it
[1:14:54] disperses throughout the world
[1:14:57] no matter where we find them later
[1:14:58] hundreds of years later thousands of
[1:15:00] years later no matter where we find them
[1:15:02] we could say at one point they were all
[1:15:03] gathered around this tower of babel
[1:15:06] united in one purpose to defeat the will
[1:15:08] of god
[1:15:09] united in one purpose to to offend god
[1:15:12] to not do as his word said
[1:15:13] and now with this in their hearts and
[1:15:16] god recognized they're united still yet
[1:15:18] in this purpose
[1:15:18] look we're in genesis chapter 11. we're
[1:15:21] like
[1:15:22] wait when did the flood happen is that
[1:15:24] in another book
[1:15:25] how could we go from genesis chapter 11
[1:15:27] where they're just getting off the boat
[1:15:31] just just getting off it would be like
[1:15:32] if you try to imagine it
[1:15:34] leaving leaving america living in the
[1:15:37] this first world and all that it has
[1:15:39] and getting on a boat and then
[1:15:40] everything being destroyed that's in
[1:15:41] america
[1:15:42] and then you arrive on another place
[1:15:44] where there's nothing there
[1:15:45] and then just a few short years it's
[1:15:46] already back the way it was before
[1:15:49] it's like didn't we reset it's like when
[1:15:52] you have your house cleaned
[1:15:53] you know when you get your house cleaned
[1:15:54] by somebody you clean it for them before
[1:15:55] they clean it
[1:15:57] that's just what you do you hire a house
[1:15:59] cleaner to put pressure on you to clean
[1:16:00] your house
[1:16:01] i love how that works i think but then
[1:16:05] once it's clean how long does it even
[1:16:06] last it's like
[1:16:07] did we did we just cleaned the house i
[1:16:09] thought we cleaned the garage yesterday
[1:16:10] yeah we did oh
[1:16:11] what happened this is the nature of man
[1:16:15] how quickly it was deluded and the
[1:16:20] part the part i guess i want to drive
[1:16:23] home but
[1:16:23] i'm not going to have time to do it now
[1:16:26] god just confounded the complication
[1:16:29] someone's going to make you all speak
[1:16:30] different languages now now mankind can
[1:16:32] even communicate to each other
[1:16:34] but why did god do it because man's
[1:16:36] continued arrogance continued defiance
[1:16:38] of the promise
[1:16:39] continued disregard of the promise and
[1:16:41] he melod
[1:16:42] humanity
[1:16:46] fell to this depraved state by
[1:16:47] continually
[1:16:49] leaving the one thing necessary
[1:16:52] by continually forsaking it the one that
[1:16:55] found righteousness the one that found
[1:16:56] deliverance the only one that found it
[1:16:58] and then because of that his household
[1:16:59] was noah who still was connected to the
[1:17:01] promise
[1:17:03] that's why even in ezekiel later on it
[1:17:05] says you know what god says i'm going to
[1:17:06] curse this land i'm going to destroy
[1:17:08] this land he says even if
[1:17:09] daniel enoch and and i came in noah even
[1:17:12] if these those three lived in the land
[1:17:14] i'd still destroy all
[1:17:16] of it and the only way that daniel enoch
[1:17:18] can know it be saved is because of their
[1:17:19] own righteousness
[1:17:21] that's exactly what it came down to is
[1:17:23] that there was only one righteous in all
[1:17:25] the world they had left off the one
[1:17:27] thing necessary
[1:17:28] to there was only one man who believed
[1:17:29] in the promise
[1:17:31] and if you want to just quickly let's
[1:17:33] just i want to do this very very fast in
[1:17:35] romans chapter 1
[1:17:38] because this is where all humanity stops
[1:17:42] this is where this is where all of
[1:17:45] humanity is painted with this color
[1:17:47] painted with this brush we can all say
[1:17:49] that we descended from the tower of bow
[1:17:50] but we were all there represented before
[1:17:52] that
[1:17:53] that edifice we were all represented
[1:17:54] there in whatever nationality whatever
[1:17:56] language what
[1:17:57] ethnicity wherever we we dispersed upon
[1:17:59] the face of the earth we came from this
[1:18:01] place
[1:18:01] of confusion disobedience and rebellion
[1:18:05] against god
[1:18:06] the bible says the wrath of god romans
[1:18:08] chapter 1 i want to read verses 18 to
[1:18:10] 32.
[1:18:13] i'm i'm instead of asking for permission
[1:18:15] i'll just apologize later
[1:18:17] for the wrath of god is revealed from
[1:18:18] heaven against all ungodliness and
[1:18:20] unrighteousness of men i want to read
[1:18:22] this as god's assessment of humanity
[1:18:24] in genesis chapter 11. i want you to
[1:18:26] recognize that it's a perfect assessment
[1:18:28] of where we are today
[1:18:30] and it's a perfect assessment at the
[1:18:31] time that paul is obviously writing this
[1:18:33] that the wrath of god is revealed
[1:18:34] against all ungodliness and
[1:18:36] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[1:18:37] truth in unrighteousness
[1:18:38] because that which way that which may be
[1:18:40] known of god is manifest in them
[1:18:42] for god has shown it unto them now think
[1:18:44] about cain sin
[1:18:46] in light of the way paul writes he is
[1:18:48] describing
[1:18:49] the sin of cain the similarity of cain
[1:18:51] for the invisible things of him from the
[1:18:53] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:18:54] being understood by the things that are
[1:18:56] made even as eternal power in godhead
[1:18:58] so that they are without excuse because
[1:19:00] that when they knew god they glorified
[1:19:03] him not as god think about man when they
[1:19:04] still were connected to some sense and
[1:19:07] idea of god
[1:19:08] but still refused to worship him so that
[1:19:10] they're
[1:19:11] so it neither were thankful but became
[1:19:13] vain in their imaginations and their
[1:19:15] foolish heart was darkened
[1:19:16] professing themselves to be wise they
[1:19:18] became fools and changed the glory of
[1:19:20] the uncorruptable god into an image
[1:19:22] made light to corruptable man there's
[1:19:23] your mixing of a righteous
[1:19:25] seed the mixing of the sons of adam with
[1:19:28] those of the sons of cain
[1:19:29] and to birds into four-footed beasts and
[1:19:31] creeping things wherefore god also gave
[1:19:33] them up to uncleanness through the lust
[1:19:35] of their own hearts to dishonor their
[1:19:36] own bodies between themselves
[1:19:38] who changed the truth of god into a lie
[1:19:40] and worshiped and served the creature
[1:19:41] more than the creator who is blessed
[1:19:43] forever amen
[1:19:46] so we could see that in man's sin to
[1:19:49] worship the creation instead of the
[1:19:50] creator
[1:19:53] it types and exemplifies how mankind
[1:19:55] became became all flesh
[1:19:57] and was deluding themselves as they try
[1:19:59] to make god merely a man make him a bird
[1:20:01] make him a beast make him a creeping
[1:20:02] thing
[1:20:03] how did this happen it didn't happen
[1:20:05] with seth
[1:20:07] the further away you got from the image
[1:20:08] of god that's when man fell to these
[1:20:10] things
[1:20:11] and likewise this god gods gave them up
[1:20:14] to vile affections for even their women
[1:20:16] to change the
[1:20:17] natural use into that which is against
[1:20:18] nature and likewise also the men leaving
[1:20:21] the natural use of the woman
[1:20:22] burned and they're lost one toward
[1:20:24] another men with men working that which
[1:20:26] is unseemly and receiving in themselves
[1:20:27] that recompense of their air which was
[1:20:29] meat
[1:20:30] and it doesn't need any interpretation
[1:20:33] or does it
[1:20:34] i won't interpret it and even as they
[1:20:36] did not like to retain god in their
[1:20:38] knowledge
[1:20:38] god gave them over to reprobate mind to
[1:20:41] do those things which are not convenient
[1:20:43] being filled with all unrighteousness
[1:20:45] fornication wickedness covetous
[1:20:47] maliciousness
[1:20:48] full of envy murder debate deceit
[1:20:50] malignity whispers backpackers haters of
[1:20:52] god despiteful proud bolsters
[1:20:53] inventor of evil things disobedient to
[1:20:55] parents without understanding covenant
[1:20:57] breakers without natural affection
[1:20:59] implacable unmerciful
[1:21:00] who knowing the judgment of god that
[1:21:02] they which commit such things are worthy
[1:21:04] of death
[1:21:04] not only do they do the same not only do
[1:21:07] the same but have pleasure in them that
[1:21:09] do
[1:21:09] them this is a perfect synopsis of
[1:21:12] humanity in genesis chapter 11.
[1:21:15] this describes what happens in genesis 3
[1:21:17] to genesis 11.
[1:21:18] each one of these things we read in
[1:21:20] these several verses have their genesis
[1:21:21] and are born from genesis 3 and they
[1:21:23] come forward and they manifest they come
[1:21:25] to their perfection by the time we get
[1:21:26] to genesis 11
[1:21:28] even though god had wiped the face of
[1:21:29] the earth off and just left it with noah
[1:21:32] his wife and the three sons and their
[1:21:33] wives but yet mankind
[1:21:35] it's in them and he describes everything
[1:21:38] that humanity is
[1:21:41] this is all it's 11 55.
[1:21:46] it's this is all humanity every single
[1:21:49] one of them
[1:21:50] none exempt there's not even a noah
[1:21:52] anymore
[1:21:55] there's none that's perfect in their
[1:21:56] generations there's none that are up
[1:21:58] there's not a job there's not a noah
[1:22:00] there's not a set there's not an enoch
[1:22:03] there's none left upon the face the
[1:22:04] earth man is totally completely
[1:22:06] and as the word would be used in the
[1:22:08] bible it would be used for gentiles
[1:22:10] which means nations or people
[1:22:11] the entire earth is spread over of
[1:22:13] nations and all of them are heathens
[1:22:17] all of them are worshiping the gods of
[1:22:19] their imagination
[1:22:20] all of them are living evil all of them
[1:22:22] are speaking different languages and
[1:22:24] they're
[1:22:24] they're pursuing different pursuits
[1:22:25] they're establishing different kingdoms
[1:22:27] and they're advancing themselves in
[1:22:28] certain technologies in certain ways of
[1:22:30] life and they're
[1:22:31] and they're good at this and they're
[1:22:32] good at that and they're spread over
[1:22:34] whole the whole earth
[1:22:35] every single one of them reprobate
[1:22:37] heathen godless
[1:22:38] wicked vile filthy and we're just in the
[1:22:41] 11th chapter of the bible
[1:22:48] genesis chapter 12 verse 1.
[1:22:52] now the lord said unto abram
[1:22:56] when you read that you should say well
[1:22:58] what what just happened
[1:23:01] god spoke to one man in the midst of all
[1:23:04] the millions of people in the face of
[1:23:05] the earth
[1:23:06] god spoke unto abram because was it
[1:23:08] because he was righteous
[1:23:10] no was it because he was doing something
[1:23:12] right no
[1:23:13] was it because he maintained an altar
[1:23:15] like that abel had did he find the
[1:23:17] original place of the sacrifice did he
[1:23:19] by revelation know
[1:23:20] exactly what to do and how to live and
[1:23:22] how to continue sacrifice no
[1:23:23] he was building groves just like his
[1:23:25] father's he was worshiping false gods
[1:23:27] just like everybody else was on earth
[1:23:30] that's why the god we serve today is
[1:23:32] called the god of abraham
[1:23:35] because nobody else knew who he was
[1:23:36] until this moment of grace he made
[1:23:38] himself known to one man named abram
[1:23:41] he says the lord god said unto abram get
[1:23:43] thee out of thy country and from thy
[1:23:44] kindred and from thy father's house
[1:23:46] unto a land that i will show thee and i
[1:23:48] will make of thee a great nation and i
[1:23:50] will bless thee and i'll make thy name
[1:23:51] great
[1:23:52] he's going to do it now jesus 11 let us
[1:23:54] make us a name let us be great
[1:23:56] but i will bless thee and i'll make thy
[1:23:57] name great thou shalt be a blessing and
[1:23:59] i will bless them that bless thee
[1:24:01] and curse them that curseth thee and in
[1:24:02] thee shall all families of the earth be
[1:24:05] blessed
[1:24:06] god is reviving genesis 3 15. god said i
[1:24:09] made a promise that there would be a
[1:24:10] deliverer
[1:24:11] i made a promise that there would be a
[1:24:12] redeemer i made a promise that there
[1:24:14] would be one come one day that would
[1:24:15] save you from your sins
[1:24:16] and even though there's not anybody left
[1:24:19] on the face of the earth that remembers
[1:24:20] that promise
[1:24:21] i will by election choose one not
[1:24:24] because he's better not because he has
[1:24:25] better blood not because he has better
[1:24:27] lineage
[1:24:27] every single one share the same lineage
[1:24:30] back
[1:24:32] all came from that tower of babel here
[1:24:34] he says god gives abraham a promise
[1:24:37] and he says i will i will i will i will
[1:24:40] i will i will i will and what did
[1:24:42] abraham have to do
[1:24:43] just choose to serve
[1:24:46] his will choose to accept
[1:24:49] his will he didn't leave saying i will i
[1:24:51] was like your will be done your will
[1:24:53] your will
[1:24:54] your will god gave abraham a promise
[1:24:57] now abraham's life is different than all
[1:24:59] the others
[1:25:01] he has a different purpose beyond the
[1:25:02] depravity of the flesh the fallen
[1:25:04] creation everything around him
[1:25:05] now just like adam he has a promise that
[1:25:07] there's going to be a seed come
[1:25:09] there's going to be one come and what
[1:25:10] does the bible say by faith abraham when
[1:25:12] he was called to go out into a place
[1:25:14] which he should after receive for
[1:25:15] inheritance
[1:25:16] obeyed hebrews 11 8-10 by faith abraham
[1:25:20] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[1:25:22] whether he went
[1:25:24] now that sounds a lot like cain except
[1:25:27] abraham had a promise
[1:25:28] cain didn't so cain could only go into
[1:25:31] the land of god because he didn't know
[1:25:32] where he was going
[1:25:33] and he didn't have any place he was
[1:25:35] trying to find
[1:25:37] that's why it's a true saying if you
[1:25:38] don't know where you're going any road
[1:25:40] will get you there
[1:25:41] and that's the way that cain was taken
[1:25:43] but abraham's not with the promise
[1:25:45] because by faith
[1:25:46] he doesn't know where he's going but he
[1:25:48] knows there's some place he's getting
[1:25:51] he knows there's something ultimately by
[1:25:53] faith he's so adjourned in the land of
[1:25:54] promises in a strange country
[1:25:56] dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and
[1:25:58] jacob the heirs of with him in the same
[1:26:00] promise for he looked for a city which
[1:26:02] had foundations
[1:26:03] whose builder and maker is god
[1:26:06] he though he wandered around and not
[1:26:08] knowing where he went he wasn't just a
[1:26:10] wonder
[1:26:10] he had a promise which was his
[1:26:12] foundation he had the promise which
[1:26:13] was his guide he knew that god had made
[1:26:15] a promise and that was what he was
[1:26:16] living for he sought something eternal
[1:26:19] something permanent something that had
[1:26:20] real value
[1:26:24] and this is where humanity's last
[1:26:25] divided in the old testament
[1:26:28] this is the last division you read of
[1:26:30] genesis chapter 12 because now
[1:26:32] in the beginning god created the heavens
[1:26:33] and the earth and you have one man and
[1:26:35] one woman
[1:26:36] that one man and one woman fall and they
[1:26:37] bring forth twins bring forth a farmer
[1:26:39] and a shepherd
[1:26:40] and the the farmer kills the shepherd
[1:26:43] and then the farmer runs out and creates
[1:26:45] a civilization in a world
[1:26:46] in his own seed in his family and they
[1:26:48] grow in evil and evil and evil
[1:26:50] and then it begins to mix and combine
[1:26:51] with the sons of adam and it climaxes in
[1:26:53] genesis chapter 6 where all the world is
[1:26:55] evil and filthy and corrupt
[1:26:57] so god judges the world and brings noah
[1:26:59] out through on the other side of the
[1:27:00] flood but that same nature comes in
[1:27:02] in the flood through the marriage of the
[1:27:03] wives they come back and in genesis
[1:27:05] chapter 11 it's all just
[1:27:07] filthy and ungodless and everyone's a
[1:27:08] heathen and everyone's a reprobate and
[1:27:10] now god says i'm like one final division
[1:27:13] and from this point on genesis chapter
[1:27:15] 12 the rest of the old testament's gonna
[1:27:17] be the story of one man and his children
[1:27:19] because i promised in genesis 3 that i
[1:27:21] would bring a seat of a woman
[1:27:23] and he never forgot that and god had
[1:27:26] never left off in
[1:27:27] making that promise and to this day
[1:27:30] it's that seed of that woman that if you
[1:27:32] believe in today makes life worth living
[1:27:36] the only one that makes sense of this
[1:27:37] world it's the only one that makes sense
[1:27:38] of this life
[1:27:40] and this is where god divides all of
[1:27:42] humanity because now you have abraham in
[1:27:44] his lineage
[1:27:45] and the rest everyone else
[1:27:48] what are they called gentiles abraham
[1:27:51] was one too until god called him
[1:27:54] what did god give them the sign of
[1:27:55] circumcision what did they begin to
[1:27:56] identify themselves as the children of
[1:27:58] god
[1:27:59] they had a promise that they were
[1:28:01] identified by even to this day
[1:28:04] israelites a nation why are they called
[1:28:08] israelites because they descend from
[1:28:10] israel
[1:28:12] by election from abraham
[1:28:15] from isaac this is this is god
[1:28:19] carving out a people and the rest are
[1:28:20] called gentiles
[1:28:23] though cain's sin had overwhelmed all of
[1:28:24] humanity and all of mankind
[1:28:26] god re-establishes his promise with man
[1:28:37] if musicians would come
[1:28:44] jesus says about those who worry about
[1:28:47] what they're going to eat what they're
[1:28:48] going to drink and what they're going to
[1:28:49] wear what does he say
[1:28:51] that's what the gentiles seek
[1:28:54] that's what that's the difference
[1:28:55] between the children of abraham
[1:28:57] and everyone else the children of
[1:28:59] abraham believed in what the promise
[1:29:02] that's what they were marked by that's
[1:29:03] what they live for that's what they long
[1:29:04] for it the promise that god had made the
[1:29:06] gentiles they're only worried about what
[1:29:07] am i going to eat what am i going to
[1:29:08] wear where am i going to sleep
[1:29:10] that's all they're worried about and
[1:29:12] even paul said don't live as the
[1:29:13] gentiles live in the vanity of their
[1:29:15] mind
[1:29:16] because they live in the living in the
[1:29:17] vanity of their mind all they ever do is
[1:29:19] they try to satisfy their lust and their
[1:29:21] desires and their hungerings and because
[1:29:22] they do that they just work all
[1:29:23] uncleanness with greediness
[1:29:26] what is is the inability to know what is
[1:29:28] necessary
[1:29:30] the inability to keep the main thing the
[1:29:32] main thing the inability to know
[1:29:33] what is sufficient it's the lack of
[1:29:37] contentment and simplicity
[1:29:38] jesus said hey the gentiles are only
[1:29:40] worried about that stuff
[1:29:42] paul is saying the gentiles are only
[1:29:43] worried about what they're going to eat
[1:29:44] and what they're going to dress and what
[1:29:45] how they're going to look and how
[1:29:46] they're going to wear where they're
[1:29:47] going to sleep and how they're
[1:29:48] what the kind of car they're going to
[1:29:49] drive and all the consumerism and all
[1:29:50] the consumption and they're basically
[1:29:52] jesus is saying but we've got to have a
[1:29:54] promise
[1:29:55] there's got to be something you're
[1:29:56] living by there's got to be something
[1:29:58] you're looking for
[1:29:58] are you only looking at your paycheck
[1:30:00] and what it can buy you're only looking
[1:30:01] at your retirement you're only watching
[1:30:02] the stock market
[1:30:03] are you only worried about all the other
[1:30:04] things are you tethered to everything
[1:30:06] else in this world
[1:30:07] that sensitizes the five senses of your
[1:30:09] spirit and the five senses of your flesh
[1:30:10] or is there something deep down on the
[1:30:12] inside of you that by faith there's one
[1:30:14] thing necessary
[1:30:15] god made a promise
[1:30:19] and man today as we can see it in
[1:30:21] genesis chapter 4 he's become the
[1:30:23] mastermind of his own chaos
[1:30:25] why because he doesn't know how to
[1:30:27] discern what is necessary
[1:30:30] cain in a moment in one moment
[1:30:33] had a choice there's one thing necessary
[1:30:36] cain
[1:30:37] faith and he could have said god give me
[1:30:40] that faith i lack it
[1:30:43] but instead he chose jealousy
[1:30:47] the inability to discern what is
[1:30:48] necessary
[1:30:50] mankind left off the one thing that is
[1:30:53] necessary
[1:30:54] faith in god believing his word
[1:30:59] living for a promise and that's where
[1:31:02] i've took taking a long time just to say
[1:31:04] this to get real practical
[1:31:06] this is where simplicity begins have
[1:31:09] faith in god
[1:31:13] simplicity begins in a promise of god
[1:31:16] and he said what is that what does that
[1:31:18] even mean take a promise of god and put
[1:31:20] your faith in it
[1:31:21] that's where simplicity begins wherever
[1:31:24] you are today there's some that need to
[1:31:25] be baptized with the holy ghost there's
[1:31:26] some that need
[1:31:27] real repentance there's some that need
[1:31:29] god to deliver them from things wherever
[1:31:30] you are whatever walk
[1:31:32] point you are in your life right now
[1:31:34] take a promise
[1:31:35] and put your faith in it and that's the
[1:31:37] simplicity we got to get back to
[1:31:39] what are we doing it all for anyways is
[1:31:41] there some
[1:31:42] is there something connected to it or
[1:31:44] are there things in our lives if we
[1:31:45] begin to take this
[1:31:47] this this faith in our heart and this
[1:31:48] conviction our heart that there's one
[1:31:49] thing necessary
[1:31:50] and come back to simply believing god
[1:31:52] and taking god at his word
[1:31:54] and living for a promise is there a way
[1:31:55] that that promise can begin to loom so
[1:31:57] large in our lives
[1:31:58] that there's things outside and that
[1:32:01] deal with our hearts and deal with our
[1:32:02] minds and in cumbersome things that we
[1:32:04] pursue
[1:32:05] that we begin to realize wait a minute
[1:32:06] this doesn't bring peace this doesn't
[1:32:08] satisfy
[1:32:08] this has nothing to do with this and
[1:32:10] then we can begin to simplify our lives
[1:32:11] in light of the fact that i'm living for
[1:32:13] a promise
[1:32:14] and i'm taking god at his word and i'm
[1:32:15] believing
[1:32:19] you take a promise of god
[1:32:24] any promise of god and so that i won't
[1:32:27] vary from it i'll stay with it
[1:32:30] you made me a promise
[1:32:34] even the promise of
[1:32:38] long hair you take a promise of gone and
[1:32:41] say lord i believe in that
[1:32:43] i was asked a very difficult question
[1:32:45] recently someone facing treatment where
[1:32:48] they would lose their hair
[1:32:49] and they were told you know if you do
[1:32:50] this you're going to lose your hair and
[1:32:52] it created this conflict
[1:32:54] things began got complicated real fast
[1:32:55] for this sister
[1:32:57] while she's growing her hair out for
[1:32:59] decades and decades
[1:33:00] as a testament to god as her glory in
[1:33:03] obedience to the word and now she's
[1:33:04] being told by those that care for her
[1:33:06] health
[1:33:06] saying you might want to cut your hair
[1:33:07] before it falls out
[1:33:09] now do you realize it gets complicated
[1:33:12] and why because science
[1:33:16] because at one time you just would have
[1:33:18] you wouldn't there wouldn't even been
[1:33:19] cancer
[1:33:20] right thanks hybrid foods thanks fear
[1:33:23] but now
[1:33:23] there's diseases and because of science
[1:33:26] there's certain diseases but science
[1:33:27] tries to remedy the disease so now
[1:33:28] there's treatment for that cancer
[1:33:30] and now but the fallout of that is the
[1:33:32] falling out of your hair now what do i
[1:33:33] do
[1:33:34] there's nothing else you can do just
[1:33:36] believe god's word take him at his word
[1:33:38] the same word that you believe that he
[1:33:40] says by my stripes you're healed and
[1:33:41] you're believing
[1:33:42] that you're going to be delivered that
[1:33:43] cancer is the same faith you put in that
[1:33:45] promise it says
[1:33:45] the bible teaches me that my long hair
[1:33:48] is a glory
[1:33:49] so god preserve this keep it strong
[1:33:52] let it grow for your glory lord let it
[1:33:54] be healthy for your glory
[1:33:55] and you take god at his word and you
[1:33:56] take a promise and you're simple towards
[1:33:59] the word of god and you let everything
[1:34:01] else fade away
[1:34:05] you remove the promise all you have is
[1:34:07] vanity
[1:34:10] you remove the promise all you have is
[1:34:12] chaos and complication
[1:34:15] take away the promise life doesn't make
[1:34:17] sense anymore
[1:34:20] can i give you a promise promise that we
[1:34:23] could all point to
[1:34:25] it's 1207
[1:34:28] isaiah chapter 32 verses 17 to 18.
[1:34:33] and the work of righteousness shall be
[1:34:34] peace this is what mankind lost in
[1:34:36] genesis chapter four this began to lose
[1:34:39] there was a time when enos was calling
[1:34:41] upon the name of the lord what did he
[1:34:42] have
[1:34:42] peace peace and the promise
[1:34:46] do you know when it's going to come enos
[1:34:47] no but i know he made it
[1:34:49] do you know what's going to look like no
[1:34:50] but i know he made it what is it going
[1:34:52] to be it's going to be what destroys
[1:34:54] what this serpent has caused
[1:34:56] it can be thing that deliberate delivers
[1:34:58] humanity
[1:35:01] he says but a work of righteous shall be
[1:35:02] peace and the effect of righteousness
[1:35:04] quietness and assurance forever and my
[1:35:07] peace
[1:35:09] and my people shall dwell in a peaceable
[1:35:12] habitation
[1:35:14] and ensure dwellings and in quiet
[1:35:17] resting places
[1:35:18] are you his people are you his person
[1:35:21] today
[1:35:22] are you his son or his daughter then
[1:35:25] this is a promise
[1:35:26] to dwell in a peaceable habitation to
[1:35:28] live in a sure dwelling
[1:35:30] to have a quiet resting place you can
[1:35:33] make this a promise
[1:35:35] you can make this scripture right here a
[1:35:37] promise and measure all pursuits and all
[1:35:39] possessions by this
[1:35:41] lord you made me a promise to have a
[1:35:42] peaceable habitation one that's not
[1:35:44] disturbed one that's not alarmed a place
[1:35:46] of there's no fighting there's no
[1:35:47] struggle there's no strife
[1:35:48] it's not a place of enemies lord you
[1:35:50] made me that promise i'd have a
[1:35:51] peaceable habitation
[1:35:52] you said i'd have a secure dwell and a
[1:35:54] sure drawing someplace secure
[1:35:56] confident a place where there's
[1:35:57] provision a place where there's no worry
[1:36:00] and a quiet resting place not just a
[1:36:03] place of labor and vanity
[1:36:05] but a place i can rest this is the
[1:36:08] existence that god could give his
[1:36:09] children
[1:36:10] today that regardless of whether you
[1:36:11] live in a basement suite or apartment or
[1:36:13] a house or wherever you might dwell
[1:36:15] you can find yourself having a peaceable
[1:36:16] habitation a sure dwelling
[1:36:18] and quiet resting places why because he
[1:36:20] made the promise
[1:36:21] and you put your faith towards it and
[1:36:23] then you measure everything else by that
[1:36:25] promise
[1:36:26] there's promises of god today if you
[1:36:28] took that promise and you let
[1:36:30] have preeminence you say lord this is
[1:36:31] what i'm believing for then there's
[1:36:33] other things in your life that say
[1:36:34] listen
[1:36:35] this just complicates the simple promise
[1:36:38] that he said i could have this
[1:36:39] if i would put my faith towards it and
[1:36:41] everything else is keeping me from this
[1:36:43] and you can start making decisions that
[1:36:44] simplify your life
[1:36:46] why you get back to simply believing him
[1:36:49] taking god at his word it's going back
[1:36:51] to the beginning
[1:36:53] simplicity by faith
[1:36:56] and living i just want to live by faith
[1:37:00] if that's where cain sinned is one step
[1:37:02] away from faith
[1:37:04] then i know today being a being a man of
[1:37:07] flesh
[1:37:09] and being one that cannot brag as noah
[1:37:12] did
[1:37:13] that my generations are perfect then i
[1:37:16] know there's a place
[1:37:17] that i can go it's the place that cain
[1:37:20] ran from
[1:37:22] i know there's something i can hear is
[1:37:24] the voice that came disregarded
[1:37:26] and right now in the middle of a crazy
[1:37:28] crazy
[1:37:30] world we can find peace let's stand to
[1:37:33] our feet
[1:38:00] let's pray for peace today
[1:38:04] that may be what you were asking for
[1:38:06] this morning
[1:38:08] it could be what you notice is missing
[1:38:10] in your life
[1:38:11] that that no worry no strife
[1:38:15] let's pray for that today our gracious
[1:38:17] heavenly father
[1:38:19] lord we learned
[1:38:23] a lesson from abel's blood that's still
[1:38:28] speaking
[1:38:30] that if we act apart from faith it's our
[1:38:33] conscience that condemns us
[1:38:37] when we're not doing those things that
[1:38:38] we know please you
[1:38:41] even if it would not be technically or
[1:38:44] lawfully a sin our own conscience
[1:38:48] condemns us
[1:38:50] because how could we as sons and
[1:38:52] daughters of god ever find sure footing
[1:38:55] if we're not sure we're standing on what
[1:38:57] you said was right
[1:39:01] your bible being true it teaches us that
[1:39:02] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:39:04] you
[1:39:07] then my ambition lord is solely to
[1:39:08] please you
[1:39:10] therefore i must live by faith
[1:39:14] if noah in genesis chapter 6 was the
[1:39:17] only one that
[1:39:18] you saw righteous in because he was a
[1:39:22] just man
[1:39:24] and you teach us that the just live by
[1:39:25] faith
[1:39:29] then i'm instructed by your word that
[1:39:31] it's not a matter of me trying to clean
[1:39:33] up
[1:39:33] straighten up fess up
[1:39:37] figure it all out get clean get right
[1:39:39] get holy
[1:39:44] get saved so to speak and then live a
[1:39:46] good clean life for a few years hoping
[1:39:48] that you
[1:39:51] accept me because of my good works
[1:39:56] but i can lord hear your voice right now
[1:40:01] right now speaking to my heart
[1:40:05] and as cain ran from it
[1:40:09] i can't like abraham walk into it

[1:40:36] show you

[1:40:50] i pray for those that experiencing
[1:40:53] great tragedy father and
[1:40:57] dilemmas in their hearts
[1:41:01] not knowing which way to go and what to
[1:41:03] do
[1:41:04] i pray lord you give them this peace
[1:41:08] that the effect of righteousness
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:12] is peace what is righteousness living by
[1:41:15] faith
[1:41:17] not my own works but just doing what you
[1:41:19] said lord if it's quicken in my heart
[1:41:20] you must make this decision you must go
[1:41:22] this way you must do this thing
[1:41:24] lord regardless of the cost regardless
[1:41:25] of the consequences regardless of what
[1:41:27] it might mean
[1:41:28] to this flesh and to my uh my position
[1:41:31] to my status all these other things lord
[1:41:33] i can only find a peaceable habitation i
[1:41:36] can only find a sure dwelling i can only
[1:41:37] find a quiet resting place
[1:41:39] in your will let me come back to the
[1:41:42] beginning lord that thing that cain left
[1:41:44] the thing that the woman left and let me
[1:41:46] come back to simply taking you at your
[1:41:47] word and believe in you

[1:41:54] midst of thousands and thousands and
[1:41:56] tens of thousands of jobs in millions of

[1:42:17] and the daughter of god that pleases you
[1:42:21] lord for brother ian today
[1:42:25] as he takes a step to water baptism lord
[1:42:29] you've been dealing with this heart for
[1:42:31] a year or so and what else could it be
[1:42:35] that stirs up within a ten-year-old's
[1:42:36] heart
[1:42:39] wells up within him and says i want to
[1:42:41] give my heart to god now
[1:42:44] i want to be baptized now it's the
[1:42:47] same god that spoke to abram in genesis
[1:42:50] 12.
[1:42:51] the same god that spoke in the beginning
[1:42:53] and created the heavens and earth
[1:42:56] and lord may it be that reality for
[1:42:58] every single one of us who are standing
[1:42:59] in your divine presence today
[1:43:01] that is the faith of abraham
[1:43:04] to take you from that very simple moment
[1:43:07] that you would speak to a
[1:43:08] child's heart and he would say here i am
[1:43:11] lord
[1:43:12] may we like why you say here we are we
[1:43:15] choose to believe you we choose to walk
[1:43:17] in faith we used to
