[0:00] and this is Jesus praying he begins
[0:02] praying for himself and for the
[0:03] disciples and then as he's praying for
[0:06] the disciples he then expands this
[0:08] neither pray I for these alone not just
[0:10] the disciples there present but for them
[0:13] also which Shall Believe on me through
[0:16] their word that the word of the
[0:17] disciples so this is Faith to Faith this
[0:19] is how this body is going to be built
[0:21] that they may they all may be one as
[0:23] thou father art in me and I in thee that
[0:26] they also may be one in us that the
[0:28] world may believe that thou Hast sent me
[0:31] and the glory which thou gavest me I
[0:33] have given them that they may be one
[0:35] even as we are one i in them and thou in
[0:38] me that they may be made perfect in one
[0:41] that the world may know that thou has
[0:43] sent me and has loved me as thou Hast
[0:46] loved me father I will that they also
[0:49] whom thou Hast given me be with me where
[0:51] I am that they may behold my glory which
[0:54] thou has given me for thou lovest me
[0:56] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:00] man we desire that God would just bless
[1:01] these things to us tonight you may be
[1:08] seated my my title tonight is art for
[1:11] God's sake and it's uh something that I
[1:17] think will make a little bit more sense
[1:18] as we go forward and I know that I ended
[1:20] uh Sunday morning sermon right in the
[1:22] middle so I'm actually trying to finish
[1:24] it but do so in a way that it doesn't
[1:26] leave too many people stranded who
[1:27] weren't here on Sunday morning and and
[1:30] I'm going to begin uh from the from the
[1:32] art side the natural side that
[1:34] perspective we've been looking at
[1:35] through these first few Services of the
[1:37] year and just mention that in the 1800s
[1:39] and the the 19th century there was a
[1:43] movement that began to hold the opinion
[1:45] or and teach that art should be
[1:47] appreciated only for its beauty and its
[1:50] form and so I want you to think about
[1:52] that that the work of art itself should
[1:54] be appreciated solely for how beautiful
[1:56] it looks and it art did not need to
[1:58] serve any other purpose whether it was
[2:00] political or social or religious or
[2:02] moral or scientific uh had it didn't
[2:05] need to have any other value other than
[2:07] as you looked at it you thought it was
[2:09] pleasurable or it was beautiful and I
[2:11] think it's good for us to think back to
[2:14] Genesis chapter 3 how that in the
[2:16] beginning when man fell the most
[2:18] beautiful creation that has ever existed
[2:20] the most beautiful woman that was ever
[2:22] brought forth and this uh tapestry of
[2:25] God's creation this masterpiece family
[2:28] this woman is presented with a different
[2:30] definition of beauty and Satan was able
[2:32] to sell Eve on Beauty for pleasure sake
[2:36] and that's it not necessarily any other
[2:39] utility other than he caused her to see
[2:40] that it was beautiful and that in it in
[2:42] itself it was pleasurable and so this
[2:45] movement which is called the aesthetic
[2:47] movement it sought to free art from
[2:49] moral constraints and it wanted to
[2:51] liberate art from practical constraints
[2:53] in other words it didn't need to be
[2:55] useful and of not being useful it was
[2:58] essentially useless
[3:00] and so they this is what they kind of
[3:03] their thesis would be art exists purely
[3:06] for its own Beauty not to convey any
[3:09] moral message or practical message I
[3:12] want you to think about this and I was
[3:13] just curious as I was uh preparing even
[3:16] over last year and looking at some of
[3:17] these things is well how do you use art
[3:21] uh and God as a Creator and as an artist
[3:23] and begin to look at these things and
[3:24] explore these things when you see things
[3:27] in art that are so anti- good and
[3:29] anti-christ
[3:30] and this is where I believe it stems
[3:32] from is this idea that art doesn't need
[3:34] to convey anything real it just merely
[3:37] needs to be beautiful so art was not a
[3:39] tool for Morality it was not a tool for
[3:41] moral instruction or education shouldn't
[3:43] be used to convey a specific message it
[3:46] was as they called it Art For Art's Sake
[3:49] and when it's Art For Art's Sake you
[3:51] they just wanted to evoke emotions that
[3:54] when one was view viewing the art or
[3:55] reading it as it was a literary uh
[3:57] movement as well they wanted it to your
[4:00] senses purely through its form as we
[4:03] mentioned it on Sunday uh the uh life
[4:06] imitates art from Oscar wild he was one
[4:08] that championed this notion that art
[4:10] should exist for Art's Sake and he
[4:13] believed that art the beauty of art
[4:15] Justified the art so Beauty was the
[4:18] excuse for
[4:20] lying right as long as it's beautiful
[4:22] the decay of lying the decay of The Art
[4:24] of Lying was decreasing Beauty in the
[4:26] literary world and in the art world and
[4:28] these realists were sh taken away art he
[4:30] felt that we should be able to tell
[4:31] beautiful lies that would please the
[4:33] people and cause them these
[4:35] imaginations and so his theory was if it
[4:37] was beautiful or evoked emotion who
[4:39] cares if it's a lie let alone useless
[4:42] just enjoy
[4:43] itow I want to give you an example of
[4:46] this and this might delay here this is a
[4:50] um an abstract painting by the artist
[4:52] Mark Rothco I believe it was painted in
[4:54] the
[4:55] 1950s it was Untitled so it's been
[4:57] titled uh yellow and blue and it sold
[5:00] for 46.5
[5:02] million I understand the color
[5:04] combination certainly would invoke high
[5:06] value the scarlet and gray was useless
[5:09] but this one sold for $ 46.5 million and
[5:13] really it doesn't look like anything
[5:14] different than what we would create if
[5:16] we were trying to make a color palette
[5:19] for our baby's bedroom right we're just
[5:21] going to put this together see if these
[5:22] colors go together but yet this thing
[5:24] sold for $ 46.5 million this you could
[5:28] see is a banana duct tape to a wall
[5:31] there's no frame there's no other
[5:32] nothing behind it it's just the wall of
[5:35] the art uh the museum and this was
[5:37] entitled
[5:38] comedian and the joke's on you right I
[5:42] was an Italian artist and it was
[5:43] entitled comedian it sold for $6.2
[5:47] million I want you to consider how much
[5:50] value was placed in this work of art for
[5:53] $46 million and this work of art for
[5:57] $6.2 million when it was a banana that
[6:00] was bought for pennies right outside the
[6:02] exhibit and duct tape to a
[6:05] wall I believe these examples of Modern
[6:08] Art reflect modern religion that when
[6:11] you look at it this religious life is
[6:13] imitating art and the art that it's
[6:16] inspired by this is L to see in a
[6:18] nutshell that we would value something
[6:20] like this for $ 46.5 million that anyone
[6:23] would pay $6.2 million for this even if
[6:26] it is just a joke and they're flush with
[6:27] money so something's being lost and and
[6:30] something is no longer valued in this
[6:33] picture here it's by a James Whistler
[6:35] this is called nocturn in black and gold
[6:38] or the falling rocket I failed to
[6:41] remember I failed to recall just how
[6:42] much this piece of art is worth but this
[6:45] is one that represents this movement of
[6:47] Art For Art's Sake that you don't
[6:50] necessarily need to know what this is to
[6:52] enjoy it but just stare at it and
[6:54] imagine certain things and and see some
[6:56] beauty in it and it's called the Falling
[6:59] Rock ET if I recall this is a painting
[7:01] of what's supposed to be fireworks over
[7:03] a lake or some water
[7:05] scene and this this artist Whistler was
[7:08] a huge proponent of Art For Art's Sake
[7:10] that art solely needs to excite your
[7:13] senses and be pleasurable and move you
[7:15] in some way to some emotion even oh
[7:16] that's scary or for boing or that's
[7:18] repulsive or I don't even know what this
[7:20] is and this is interesting that's all it
[7:22] needed to do and there was an art critic
[7:25] that uh criticized him and uh wrote up a
[7:29] piece that was uh criticizing his art
[7:32] and so as this artist did or Whistler
[7:35] followed the lawsuit and in his lawsuit
[7:37] he claimed this that the value of art
[7:39] lies in its ability to evoke an
[7:41] emotional response and provide visual
[7:45] pleasure that that's all that's all you
[7:47] need for art is for it to evoke an
[7:49] emotional response and provide some
[7:51] visual pleasure he argued for the
[7:53] independence or the autonomy of art that
[7:55] it should serve no other purpose than to
[7:57] entertain you that believed that art was
[8:00] complete in itself because it was art
[8:04] for art sake and if you'll notice this
[8:07] we none of us recognize what this is
[8:09] this is just pure gibberish to everyone
[8:11] here but NG GM this is their logo this
[8:14] is the updated one if you'll notice on
[8:16] the crest it's ARS gratia artist art for
[8:19] art
[8:21] sake that that's all you need to do is
[8:23] if its art within itself it's complete
[8:26] doesn't need to convey a message doesn't
[8:28] need to be used for moral educ ation
[8:30] doesn't need to you don't need to gain
[8:32] any knowledge but you by interacting
[8:34] with it and observing it and imagining
[8:36] different things and allowing it to
[8:38] influence your spirit on some level you
[8:40] can look at this art whether it be this
[8:44] or or that or that and look at it and
[8:47] say to yourself This is this moves me in
[8:50] an emotional way and it doesn't have to
[8:52] have any more value beyond that I was
[8:54] thinking about it and came to this
[8:56] conclusion this is The Emperor's New
[8:58] Clothes right
[9:00] that what is happening is and in that
[9:02] particular telling by Hans Christian
[9:03] Anderson which is an interpretation of
[9:06] one that was written in Spain and then
[9:08] de uh then demonstrated again in England
[9:10] and they found copies of Indian ones uh
[9:13] back in the 1100s so it's just kind of a
[9:16] it's a tale for a long time of this idea
[9:18] that you can be tricked into believing
[9:20] something and accepting something
[9:21] through social
[9:23] pressure some of the earlier tellings of
[9:25] this story predating Hans Christian
[9:27] Anderson was that anybody who was an
[9:29] illegitimate child would not be able to
[9:31] see the
[9:33] clothes so it was used uh to determine
[9:35] adulterous paternity and so if somebody
[9:37] walked by naked you would be like wow
[9:39] that's a great
[9:40] suit right Dad and and you wouldn't want
[9:44] to be the one that was found to be an
[9:46] illegitimate child and in the telling of
[9:48] Hans Christian Anderson some swindlers
[9:50] come by and they convince the emperor
[9:52] that they're weaving the most beautiful
[9:54] garment in the world and that and
[9:57] tricked him into believing that it was
[9:59] there
[9:59] weaving their tails and their lies and
[10:02] eventually the advisers to the emperor
[10:04] pretended to see the beauty so they
[10:06] didn't look
[10:07] foolish and everyone was in on the game
[10:10] to our now you have a society that
[10:12] exists where people will stand around
[10:14] looking at yellow and blue and saying
[10:17] it's just
[10:18] remarkable right the duct tape have you
[10:21] seen duct tape like that and they're so
[10:24] enamored with it and because it's art
[10:26] for art sake there's no other purpose
[10:28] behind it in Proverbs 31:20 it says
[10:32] favor is deceitful and beauty is vain
[10:34] but a woman that feareth the Lord she
[10:36] shall be praised in the empress knew
[10:39] clothes it was fear that caused people
[10:40] to conform uh they weren't even trusting
[10:43] their own senses and surely some
[10:44] eventually begin to believe their own
[10:46] lies and imagine that there was a
[10:47] beautiful garment and could convince
[10:49] themselves after the fact that I saw it
[10:51] it was gorgeous it was beautiful but yet
[10:54] it was a child with these innocent eyes
[10:56] that said Mom the emperor is naked he
[10:58] has no cloth on sir and so it is through
[11:02] fear that we begin to be deceived it's
[11:04] through that fear that we begin to
[11:06] accept something that's very shallow is
[11:08] beautiful but favor is deceitful and
[11:10] beauty is vain amen what we could see in
[11:13] art for art sake and what we could see
[11:15] in these different examples of art that
[11:17] are valued at millions and millions of
[11:18] dollars is the failure of discernment
[11:21] the failure of proper judgment the
[11:22] inability to Value things and have the
[11:24] appropriate worth for them and it's a
[11:27] prideful fear that one who does not for
[11:30] this says favor is deceitful and beauty
[11:32] is vain that puts it in this realm of
[11:33] art for art sake is in that realm of
[11:36] vain Beauty because all it is is it
[11:38] Beauty for beauty's sake and others
[11:40] would be afraid to acknowledge its
[11:41] beauty uh for beauty's sake they would
[11:44] therefore kind of Co coales into the
[11:46] whole and say yeah that's fine that's
[11:47] beautiful and be deceived because they
[11:49] want favor with people am so it's a
[11:52] prideful fear it's that Conformity I
[11:54] don't want to be perceived as different
[11:56] so I'll say yeah that's amazing
[11:59] what we find is it's a lack of light
[12:02] it's darkness that is set it over the
[12:03] people and so groping in darkness they
[12:06] they they can't perceive correctly
[12:08] whereas the True Light would expose the
[12:11] vanity of that
[12:13] beauty so there is this idea that art
[12:16] should merely exist for Art's Sake and
[12:18] all that it should do is excite the
[12:21] senses but I want to turn it around
[12:22] seeing that we've looked at life
[12:24] imitating art and created to create and
[12:27] these different things that we've beun
[12:29] with this year on how that you are the
[12:31] art of God in the beginning when God
[12:33] created he brought forth a beautiful
[12:35] Earth that in itself was not just Beauty
[12:37] for beauty's sake it's not just creation
[12:40] for creation's sake so I want to look at
[12:42] it from the standpoint of art for God's
[12:44] sake art for God's sake created for a
[12:47] purpose existing for a reason and what
[12:50] God wants from you in terms of Holiness
[12:52] and demonstration of the life of a
[12:54] Believer and proper discernment and
[12:55] putting the right value on things is he
[12:57] wants to use that not for the sake that
[12:59] it would be beautiful in itself but for
[13:01] his
[13:02] sake in Isaiah 28: 1-6 I believe it just
[13:06] beautifully describes and I say
[13:08] beautifully but just exceptionally and
[13:10] really on the nose the L desen age woe
[13:12] to the crown of Pride to the drunkards
[13:15] of Ephraim whose glorious beauty is a
[13:18] Fading Flower it's just temporary it's
[13:20] shallow it's not Everlasting which are
[13:22] on the head of the fat valleys of them
[13:24] that are overcome with wine behold the
[13:26] Lord hath a mighty and strong one which
[13:28] is a tempest of of hail and a destroying
[13:30] storm as a flood of Mighty Waters
[13:32] overflowing shall cast down the Earth
[13:35] with the
[13:36] hand the crown of Pride the drunkards of
[13:38] Ephraim shall be trotted under feet and
[13:41] the Glorious Beauty which is on the head
[13:43] of the fat Valley shall be a Fading
[13:45] Flower and as the Hasty fruit before the
[13:48] summer which when he hath that look he
[13:51] that lookth upon it seeth while it is
[13:53] yet in his hand he eateth it up there's
[13:57] your there's your picture of it all that
[13:59] the beauty is consumed at the desires of
[14:01] the flesh as a woman an adulterous woman
[14:03] when she eateth she wipeth her mouth and
[14:05] says she has done no wrong she's acted
[14:07] on impulse and animal Instinct in the
[14:09] beginning when Satan deceived the woman
[14:11] she was acting with that same sense she
[14:13] couldn't wait it was an oncoming promise
[14:16] and the Very power that Humanity was
[14:18] given and Mankind was given to create
[14:21] themselves brother Bram said that's
[14:22] where they fell because it changed to
[14:24] Art For Art's Sake it wasn't in God's
[14:27] time or God's purpose and as that Fading
[14:30] Flower he says here these drunkards
[14:32] their glorious beauty is as a Fading
[14:34] Flower and their crown of Pride will be
[14:37] destroyed remember on Sunday we talked
[14:39] about life imitates art and how it's but
[14:42] the supposition is that people mod model
[14:44] their actions and their attitudes based
[14:46] upon the art that inspires them it's art
[14:49] for art sake that when they see
[14:52] something that is merely for the the the
[14:55] demonstration of pleasure to excite the
[14:57] senses that's what they're modeling
[14:59] themselves after Isaiah 60:2 says for
[15:03] Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[15:04] Earth and gross Darkness the
[15:06] people now this is the time that we're
[15:09] living in of gross Darkness it's the
[15:10] darkest age there's ever been the world
[15:12] is groping in darkness and Paul said if
[15:14] our gospel be hid it is hid to them that
[15:16] are lost 2 Corinthians chapter 4 now
[15:19] verse 4 in whom the God of this world
[15:21] hath blinded the minds of them which
[15:23] believe not lest the light of the
[15:25] Glorious gospel of Christ who is at the
[15:27] image of God should shine unto them this
[15:30] is the blinding upon the minds and the
[15:32] hearts of the people in this day and age
[15:34] so that they can see something that has
[15:36] no value in it and believe that there's
[15:37] True Value they can see a false light
[15:40] they can see a perversion they can see
[15:41] something mangled they can see a banana
[15:43] taped to a wall and be willing to spend
[15:45] $6.2
[15:47] million regardless of the rationale
[15:49] regardless of how someone say well that
[15:51] amount that was spent by this uh Tech
[15:53] billionaire or whatever it might have
[15:54] been uh it's such it's just like you
[15:56] going to buy a coke uh uh after after
[15:59] school or something now forget all those
[16:01] kind of metrics and those analogies $6.2
[16:03] million for a banana that was worth
[16:05] pennies in tape that had no value is
[16:08] ridiculous yes sir but we live in a day
[16:10] and age where content is made for the
[16:13] sake of the content to merely entertain
[16:16] and make people uh happy and it's become
[16:19] a reflection it is a reflection of the
[16:21] spiritual condition of Leo DEA Modern
[16:23] Art reflects modern religion Modern Art
[16:26] reflects modern Christianity yes Amen to
[16:29] whom the gospel has been hid they're
[16:32] groping in darkness they have been
[16:33] blinded they're blind leaders of the
[16:35] Blind and the gospel's been hid to them
[16:37] to them that are lost because if the
[16:39] light of God's gospel ever shined into
[16:41] their hearts they wouldn't give into the
[16:43] Performing of Arts their services
[16:45] wouldn't just be uh for
[16:49] show in the message Shalom brother
[16:51] bram's talking about the day we're
[16:52] living in now and he makes a comparison
[16:53] to what it was like in Genesis 1: 2 he
[16:56] said it's just like it was in the
[16:57] beginning where there was gross darkness
[16:58] of upon the earth and the spirit of God
[17:01] moved upon the face of the water and
[17:02] said let there be light and God
[17:04] separated the light from the darkness
[17:06] and I believe that we're living in that
[17:08] hour
[17:09] again the hour where it is dark it's
[17:12] chaotic it's grotesque it's just a blob
[17:14] a mass it's UND discernable what we see
[17:18] and the world says this is
[17:22] beautiful but then God says God brother
[17:26] says the hour when God is separating
[17:28] light from Darkness
[17:29] and it's pre he's pressing into the
[17:31] other side of the world that the light
[17:33] might be made manifest and whatsoever do
[17:36] make manifest is light it exposes it's
[17:38] what shows true beauty and Symmetry and
[17:41] form and shape and
[17:42] purpose and as we continue there at
[17:44] Isaiah 28 as it says The Fading Flower
[17:47] the crown of Pride and this glorious
[17:49] Beauty will fade but it says in that Day
[17:51] verse 5 in that day shall the Lord of
[17:53] hosts be for a Crown of
[17:56] Glory and for a diadem him of beauty at
[18:00] a time of darkness and despair and
[18:03] destruction a time when the crown of
[18:05] Pride upon the drunkards of Ephraim I is
[18:08] causing their beauty to fade and their
[18:10] false Beauty exposed there will be a
[18:12] light in that day the Lord of hosts will
[18:14] be a Crown of Glory he shall if this is
[18:18] the crowning achievement of Christ his
[18:20] bride he's going to be a Crown of Glory
[18:22] not a crown of Pride but a Crown of
[18:24] Glory and a diadem a crowning of beauty
[18:28] judgment this discernment of beauty
[18:30] under the residue of his people because
[18:32] it says in verse 6 and four a spirit of
[18:34] judgment to him that sth in judgment and
[18:36] for strength to them that turn the
[18:38] battle to the gate in this hour God's
[18:41] restoring true beauty he is going to be
[18:43] a crown of beauty a Crown of Glory Glory
[18:47] this diadem of beauty it's a crowning of
[18:50] discernment it's a crowning of proper
[18:51] Judgment of what's valuable and what's
[18:54] right in Isaiah 42: 5 and 6 it says thus
[18:58] sayith the Lord
[18:59] thus sayith God the Lord he that created
[19:02] the heavens and stretched them out he
[19:05] that spread forth the Earth and that
[19:07] which cometh out of it he that giveth
[19:10] breath unto the people upon it in spirit
[19:12] to them that walk therein I the Lord
[19:14] hath called thee in righteousness and
[19:17] will hold thine hand and will give thee
[19:19] and will keep thee and give thee for
[19:21] Covenant of the people for a light of
[19:24] the
[19:25] Gentiles when Jesus was in the world he
[19:27] said I am the light light of the world
[19:30] as long as I am in the world I am the
[19:32] light in the world but yet this light
[19:35] was not just to the Jews it was a light
[19:37] to the
[19:38] Gentiles and so just building off of
[19:40] your Rich knowledge already of the
[19:42] history of the church and God bringing
[19:44] forth the body of Christ which is the
[19:46] Gentile bride in Ephesians 5:8 it says
[19:50] for ye were sometimes
[19:51] Darkness but now are ye light in the
[19:55] Lord walk as children of the light
[19:59] this goes back to verse one where H he
[20:01] said be ye dear followers of be ye
[20:03] followers of God as dear children
[20:05] children imitating the model of the
[20:08] father and not imitation in art for art
[20:11] sake or not just modeling an attempt to
[20:13] mimic it but rather you are children of
[20:15] God with his life and his nature bone of
[20:17] his bone flesh of his flesh therefore
[20:20] imitate his life imitate his character
[20:24] as his children so that your life will
[20:27] imitate him amen we're to be followers
[20:30] of God as dear children because we were
[20:32] sometimes Darkness but now we are light
[20:35] in the Lord you are characterized as
[20:37] light so therefore we should walk as
[20:39] children of light verse 13 now just
[20:42] enhancing what it means to be a Child of
[20:44] Light and all but all things are
[20:46] reproved that are reproved are made
[20:47] manifest by the light for whatsoever
[20:50] doth make manifest is light it's light
[20:53] that brings you to life and now it's
[20:56] your life that is the light of the
[20:59] world as Jesus Christ came into the
[21:02] world and the life was the light of men
[21:03] now it's your light which is the light
[21:06] in the Lord your life is the light of
[21:09] men therefore Our Lives should reveal
[21:12] the order of God's word the proper
[21:14] symetry of God's word the proper
[21:16] composition and beauty of God's word
[21:18] that we should reflect true
[21:20] beauty not be bananas taped to a
[21:24] wall in Matthew 5: 14-6 he says ye are
[21:29] the light of the
[21:30] world a city that is set on a hill
[21:33] cannot be
[21:34] hid neither do men light a candle and
[21:36] put it under a bushel but on a
[21:38] Candlestick and it giveth light unto all
[21:39] that are in the house Jesus drawing upon
[21:42] these very simple principles that a uh
[21:45] City in that day and age not lit up by
[21:47] these lights that we have but candles
[21:49] and other means of natural means of fire
[21:51] would uh light up a Hillside and you
[21:53] would know that the city is there he
[21:54] saiding in the same sense that as a city
[21:56] on a hill can be seen round about
[21:59] and a candle lit is lit only for the
[22:01] purpose of light to others he's saying
[22:03] you are that
[22:05] light you realize that when we are
[22:07] holding light it's not necessary that
[22:09] we're illuminated for our own purposes
[22:11] but when you hold a lantern you are in
[22:13] darkness but the path is illuminated you
[22:16] are not a candle for your own sake but
[22:18] for the sake of those that are beholding
[22:19] the hill that are beholding the candle
[22:22] amen CU he says let your light so shine
[22:25] before men that they may see your good
[22:28] works and glorify your father which is
[22:31] in heaven we are that city of God come
[22:34] down out of Heaven you are a bride
[22:36] adorned for her husband the bride hath
[22:40] made herself ready with that those
[22:42] things that God has given her she's
[22:44] adorned in
[22:45] Beauty Psalms 50:2 out of Zion the
[22:49] Perfection of beauty God hath shined
[22:52] where is God shining not in the halls of
[22:55] art not in denominational churches not
[22:57] in the the in attainment venues it's not
[23:00] even properly seen anymore nature as
[23:02] it's constantly changed and misused but
[23:04] it's out of Zion not in Utah but right
[23:07] in the body of Christ out of Zion the
[23:09] Perfection of beauty God
[23:12] shines out of her is light and her light
[23:15] is beautiful and
[23:17] clear Psalms 149:4 for the lord taketh
[23:20] pleasure in his people he will beautify
[23:23] the meek with
[23:25] salvation he's going to be his Beauty
[23:27] it's his Beauty Beauty the Perfection of
[23:29] beauty that shines in you to beautify he
[23:32] going to Adorn you in true beauty to be
[23:34] glorified it means with salvation which
[23:37] is Victory and
[23:39] deliverance therefore it's that that
[23:41] light that we see when we see him as he
[23:43] is therein we see true true beauty and
[23:46] that's what ought to inspire
[23:48] us that ought to give us some
[23:50] inspiration then to be light I am the
[23:53] god who is the father of light in him
[23:55] there's no Shadow or variableness or
[23:57] shadow of turn therefore I as a child of
[24:00] the light I am light therefore I I'm
[24:03] inspired by my Creator I'm inspired by
[24:05] the one who brought me forth and his
[24:07] characteristics Lord beautify me with
[24:10] salvation Lord I want to make myself
[24:12] ready Lord out of us may the Perfection
[24:15] of beauty
[24:17] shine Isaiah 60: 1 to5 arise Shine for
[24:21] thy light is come this day this
[24:24] scripture is fulfilled and the glory of
[24:26] the Lord is risen upon thee for it is
[24:30] the rising of the Sun for behold
[24:32] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[24:34] Darkness the people now notice this but
[24:36] the Lord shall arise upon thee and His
[24:39] glory shall be seen upon thee now it's
[24:42] not just that we're all beholding a
[24:44] risen son but to those who cannot
[24:46] discern the Risen son it should be
[24:48] reflected in your countenance it should
[24:50] be part of your disposition in your
[24:52] character that his glory should be seen
[24:56] upon you why the word world do grow up
[24:59] in in darkness why they are deluded with
[25:01] these modern arts and therefore modern
[25:03] inventions and modern religion you ought
[25:05] to be the true beauty that can begin to
[25:07] shine and cause someone to wonder is
[25:09] there still Beauty in this
[25:11] world Glory that out of you the
[25:14] Perfection of beauty God who is the
[25:16] Perfection of beauty Zion who is
[25:18] representative of her will shine that he
[25:21] will beautify the bride with
[25:24] salvation brother eler this is just fits
[25:26] marries perfectly with good morning
[25:29] bride this is where we're living this is
[25:31] the time that we're living and the
[25:33] Gentiles shall come to thy
[25:38] light and the Kings to the brightness of
[25:41] thy
[25:42] Rising she's begin to rise he
[25:48] says and there will be Gentiles that
[25:50] come to that
[25:52] light the message that's rejected
[25:54] anymore it's not that people would name
[25:56] the name of William bradam and say he's
[25:57] a false prophet and therein reject the
[25:59] message they can just simply reject the
[26:01] reflection of Christ in
[26:05] you that's the Christ that's being
[26:07] rejected the Jesus whom they
[26:10] persecute therefore we understand
[26:12] according to the teaching of the message
[26:14] that the bride from around the world
[26:15] must be the word expressed to those who
[26:17] can
[26:18] see Jesus Christ when he prayed he said
[26:20] I pray not just for them alone but all
[26:22] them that would believe through their
[26:25] word therefore when we look at this if
[26:27] you want to turn to our text and I'll
[26:28] just try to bring a few things out
[26:30] before we close the glory of the Lord is
[26:32] risen upon
[26:33] you so that his glory can be seen upon
[26:37] thee amen that when your G the glory of
[26:39] God would be seen in you and I know that
[26:41] there's this way that we want to paint
[26:43] that picture to where it's like oh wow
[26:45] you got to come see this but it's it's
[26:47] not religion for religion's sake it's
[26:50] not church for church sake it's not art
[26:52] for art sake if God's going to show his
[26:54] Beauty in you it's so that his light
[26:57] shining into to and through you would
[26:59] bring others to the light not to you but
[27:03] to the light it's art for God's
[27:07] sake John chap 17: 20- 24 neither pray I
[27:12] the pray I for these alone but with them
[27:15] also which Shall Believe on me through
[27:17] their word it's from Faith to
[27:20] Faith God was going to use his body and
[27:22] their as his voice to preach the word
[27:25] we've seen these Dynamics so clearly in
[27:27] scripture we have we were saved by the a
[27:29] similar Dynamic the very same
[27:32] thing that they all may be
[27:35] one as thou father art in me I feel
[27:39] Vindicated there's art right there do
[27:41] you see it you catch
[27:44] that and I in thee that they also may be
[27:47] one in us that the world may believe
[27:50] that thou Hast sent me how is it the
[27:53] world is going to
[27:54] believe that he was sent when we become
[27:58] one with
[28:00] him it is not merely through the Oneness
[28:02] of Christ with the father that brings
[28:05] salvation but when we can begin to
[28:07] recognize that we are also in him and he
[28:11] in us when we can believe on his word
[28:15] and he says this this to me is just the
[28:16] real gold and the glory which thou
[28:18] gavest me I have given them that they
[28:21] may be one even as we are one i in them
[28:24] and thou in me that they may be made
[28:26] perfect in one
[28:28] and that the world may know that thou H
[28:30] has sent me and has loved me as thou
[28:33] Hast sent me and Hast loved them as thou
[28:35] Hast loved me notice that when he's
[28:38] calling out for this shared glory and
[28:41] this Oneness it's that the world would
[28:43] see and believe through
[28:45] you father I will that they also whom
[28:48] thou has given me be with me where I am
[28:50] that they may behold my glory which thou
[28:52] Hast given me for thou lovest me before
[28:55] the foundation of the world this Glory
[28:58] that Christ desires for you to share in
[29:00] is not glory for Glory sake or as I'm
[29:03] using the term art for art sake art for
[29:06] heart sake is vain
[29:09] self-serving it evokes only pleasure it
[29:12] just does something to your senses woo
[29:13] that was a good service and all that
[29:14] looks beautiful and this is fun that's
[29:16] great but this is Beauty for God's sake
[29:19] this was shared glory for your sake
[29:22] Christ is saying I have been glorified
[29:24] and the father has glorified me and he
[29:25] will glorify it again and there's a lot
[29:27] of things is saying about his own Glory
[29:29] but he's not just saying that this glory
[29:31] is a glory that he shares but now it's a
[29:33] glory he wants to
[29:35] give this is how real this art that I'm
[29:38] have been pondering and thinking about
[29:40] it's when there's some value that
[29:41] someone can take away for themselves I
[29:44] can look at a banana tape to a wall and
[29:46] say that's sold for $6.2 million I wish
[29:50] I had have thought of
[29:51] that I got some other I I'm going to
[29:53] glue some asparagus to a wall right
[29:56] maybe maybe the people who really into
[29:58] that the green stuff they'll like that
[30:00] and that what it does is just this
[30:01] selfishness and this vanity nothing to
[30:04] take away from it but just so horrible
[30:07] questions but when there's some art
[30:10] that's moving it brings you to something
[30:11] that has
[30:12] utility something that has a purpose
[30:14] Beyond itself Art For Art's Sake is Art
[30:17] is uh complete within itself that within
[30:20] itself it needs nothing else to give it
[30:22] beauty or color or purpose that it's
[30:24] achieved some Symmetry and it moves upon
[30:26] your flesh and you think it's glorious
[30:28] and beautiful but Jesus says the glory
[30:30] that I have the beauty that he had that
[30:32] the world couldn't see he wanted to
[30:33] share it with
[30:36] you there's uh a book that I had I I
[30:41] bought just recently it's a it was
[30:44] published and printed in 1896 and I was
[30:46] able to find a first edition copy and
[30:49] it's uh these concise devotions that
[30:52] were given at Harvard College to the
[30:54] Seminary school and my son jack and I
[30:56] were doing a devotion this morning and
[30:58] not we were reading this together and
[31:00] he's speaking of this very scripture he
[31:02] says this one who gave this devotion he
[31:05] says it was not his capacity to receive
[31:08] which glorified him now thinking of
[31:11] Christ now it was not his capacity to
[31:13] receive that glorified Christ it was his
[31:15] capacity to give the beauty of Christ
[31:18] was not merely in what he held but what
[31:20] he was willing to share it was not the
[31:22] beauty that we could behold ourselves
[31:24] but it was the beauty that we could get
[31:26] from what we beheld
[31:28] in most of the great pictures of the
[31:30] glorified Christ there is a Halo of
[31:32] light encircling and Illuminating his
[31:35] face and he says that is the fictitious
[31:39] Glory the glory of
[31:41] possession there was a
[31:43] theory a principle within art especially
[31:46] within the Renaissance and some of the
[31:47] influence of the church that art that
[31:49] depicted the the holy family and
[31:51] depicted Christ to the church it had to
[31:53] be sacred it had to have Grandeur it
[31:55] could not evoke Earthly things it you
[31:57] had to see be like that never seen
[32:00] anything like that right you had to look
[32:02] at and say I could never afford that
[32:04] there's churches like Christ look like
[32:05] that there's always a Halo just imagine
[32:07] the
[32:08] cherubs they all look like that babies
[32:11] with rosy cheeks and there's things that
[32:13] it was things that were
[32:15] unworldly that's how it had to be
[32:17] presented even the Dutch reformist would
[32:18] not allow you to paint the holy family
[32:22] so that a throne was painted with it as
[32:24] an empty chair and you were to imagine
[32:27] that was the Throne of
[32:29] God what was it they were producing in
[32:31] their art were things that were sacred
[32:33] that really had no earthly utility
[32:36] except to tell you this isn't you you
[32:39] can never be this and the Catholic
[32:41] Church forced poverty on an entire
[32:44] continent making them feel contrite and
[32:46] broken and needy and and presented this
[32:49] idea that opulence and Grandeur was the
[32:52] power of God and they could never attain
[32:54] to it because they were Sinners subject
[32:56] to purgatory
[32:58] wow it's a fictitious Glory the glory of
[33:01] possession and if it's a glory that was
[33:03] merely possessed it was one that was to
[33:05] Christ alone as he's depicted with
[33:08] Halos he says in a few such paintings
[33:10] the light streams from the Master's face
[33:12] to illuminate the other figures of the
[33:15] scene that is the real glory the glory
[33:19] of
[33:20] transmission the glory of transformation
[33:23] I'll put it in those words that when
[33:25] artists begin to express Christ in more
[33:27] human ways so we were showing the the
[33:30] the head of Christ through Rembrant and
[33:32] how he showed a Meek man a humble man a
[33:34] human that you could see this and say oh
[33:36] well who might have this been during
[33:38] that time frame and who is this
[33:40] depicting and you would have believed
[33:41] that that would have been human but the
[33:44] alien looking Christ who always had a
[33:45] Halo and there was always this
[33:47] otherworldly Look to Him that's not what
[33:49] Christ
[33:50] was the Glorious beauty of Christ is the
[33:53] glory that can be given to
[33:56] us and it's that that should be seen in
[33:59] us the glory he wanted to share the
[34:02] glory that he had wasn't one that was
[34:04] Vain and selfish and glory for Glory
[34:06] sake but it was glory for your
[34:09] sake so we are we must be
[34:12] Christlike now in the sermon images of
[34:15] Christ brother Bram makes this
[34:17] statement he says now that doesn't mean
[34:19] that we're to grow a long beard as the
[34:21] artist pictures have him him having this
[34:24] is a a
[34:25] CIO uh I think it's painted in the 1600s
[34:28] or 1500s and it's actually at the Getty
[34:30] museum in La currently under threat of
[34:32] fire almost this is a very old ancient
[34:36] painting that paints Christ and is
[34:38] supposed to be reflecting uh his image
[34:40] that was impressed within a
[34:42] veil but this says it doesn't mean that
[34:44] we're to grow a long beard and Artist as
[34:46] the artist pictures him having where we
[34:49] would wear crown of thorns and grow our
[34:51] hair long and try to look like this he
[34:52] says neither does it mean that we grow
[34:54] long hair as the artist pictures him
[34:55] having or wear a robe as he wore
[34:58] for we're living in another day this
[35:01] isn't the day we're living in we're not
[35:04] living in the in the day when it looked
[35:05] like
[35:07] this he says we don't necessarily have
[35:10] to be that to reflect his physical image
[35:13] but we must in our souls reflect his
[35:16] Spirit image and his manner of life I
[35:19] may not have that highlighted but it's
[35:21] worthy of it in our souls we must
[35:23] reflect his Spirit image and his manner
[35:25] of life we do not see the work of and
[35:28] see him rendered in a certain image and
[35:29] say I want to be like that I want to
[35:31] dress like that I want to look like that
[35:32] but rather you've got to have his spirit
[35:35] and reflect him now as a creation of God
[35:37] in this hour his spirit and his manner
[35:40] of life he says I do not believe that
[35:42] Christians consist of joining churches
[35:45] or Creeds I believe it's a reflection of
[35:48] Jesus Christ and a human
[35:51] being that's what it ought to be the
[35:53] glory that I have I've given to you the
[35:55] glory of transmission which we now share
[35:56] that we now have is Christ in human
[35:59] beings for we are his members the
[36:00] members of his body and we bear His
[36:02] Image the scripture says now what kind
[36:05] of image was he isn't that the question
[36:10] what kind of image was he listen how
[36:13] easy would it be for us to find the the
[36:16] the full photo of Hoffman's Christ at 33
[36:19] or Christ and the Rich Young Ruler and
[36:21] be able to take all those garments and
[36:24] those colors and perfectly match them
[36:26] and just dress that way
[36:28] and we all show up and we all look like
[36:30] you know Burger King in here and we're
[36:32] all with long beards and we're all
[36:33] wearing gowns and we're all just trying
[36:34] to look the part and we feel that we've
[36:36] achieved some sort of sacredness or some
[36:38] sort of
[36:40] Glory but he says that's not that would
[36:42] be easy it' be easy to do
[36:45] that oh I wish that just growing a
[36:48] measly beard like this would make me
[36:49] more
[36:51] Christlike but it has nothing to do with
[36:53] it what kind of image was he
[36:59] now ye are
[37:01] light ye are the light of the
[37:03] world we could ask what kind of
[37:06] image was
[37:08] he and I believe that your life should
[37:12] be the answer
[37:14] amen it may not be the complete and
[37:16] total answer but if somebody wants to
[37:19] know what Christ is today and what image
[37:21] he's in today your life should be
[37:23] reflecting that not not in a snapshot
[37:26] not in a self-portrait not just in an
[37:27] image where we quickly view you but
[37:29] something about your life is declaring
[37:31] The Narrative and the story of the
[37:32] nature and character of God we could all
[37:34] look the part in church and we could all
[37:36] say well they were really Christlike and
[37:38] God had his way but it's your life that
[37:40] begins to unfold and it answers the
[37:42] question what kind of image he is in
[37:44] this hour amen sir I'm part of the
[37:47] mystery unveiling the nature of
[37:50] Christ Colossians 1: 12-13 giving thanks
[37:54] unto the Father which hath made us meat
[37:57] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[37:58] the Saints in
[38:08] light again it's that disposition of
[38:10] light without light there is no beauty
[38:13] without light there is no color light is
[38:15] intrinsic in art and even in darkness
[38:18] there should be a great deal of light
[38:19] that falls on everything until the bride
[38:22] is taken out of the way there's no more
[38:24] color there's no more life there's no
[38:27] more
[38:28] Beauty because we are partakers of the
[38:31] inheritance of the Saints in
[38:33] light who hath delivered us from the
[38:36] power of Darkness you were sometimes
[38:38] Darkness but now are you light we have
[38:39] been delivered from the power of
[38:40] darkness and have translated us into the
[38:42] kingdom the kingdom Reign this Kingdom
[38:44] of Light of his dear
[38:47] son that we too could be like
[38:51] him I had considered entitling this uh
[38:55] painters of light I had kind of a dig at
[38:58] Thomas concade who is the self-professed
[39:00] painter of light nobody ever called him
[39:02] that he called that he called himself
[39:04] that and then Trey marked the term so I
[39:05] didn't want to got a didn't want to get
[39:06] a copyright strike or something from his
[39:11] estate but brother bam says and Christ
[39:13] identified the same in all generations
[39:16] there's even a connection of those
[39:17] titles he was using to works of art he
[39:19] says now remember don't forget our theme
[39:22] is and our text that Jesus Christ is the
[39:25] same yesterday today and forever
[39:28] now my my text subject for tonight is
[39:30] Christ identified the same in all
[39:32] generations he's identified by his
[39:35] characteristics he he's identified in
[39:37] his word Christ revealed in his own word
[39:41] is another way of uh putting these
[39:42] sermon titles Christ identified the same
[39:45] in all generations now the Bible said
[39:46] he's the same yesterday today and
[39:48] forever and we want to know how he could
[39:50] be how we'd recognize him are we looking
[39:54] for a Rembrant are we looking for a
[39:56] Hoffman what are we looking uh for a
[39:59] Leonardo uh Rafael what is it what's the
[40:01] image we're trying to find to see Christ
[40:04] if he's here just as he was any other
[40:06] time then we'd like to know how he is
[40:08] recognized Among Us
[40:11] amen there's so many people have so many
[40:13] different ideas about him each one as an
[40:16] individual try to draw up our ideas
[40:18] about Christ what he was what he looks
[40:25] like and how the psychologist has
[40:27] painted the
[40:28] picture this is a Salman Salman head of
[40:32] Christ probably recognize this many of
[40:35] you probably recognize this type of
[40:37] art brother it says like Hoffman's head
[40:39] of Christ at 33 or Salon in different
[40:42] ones but we see we don't know he looked
[40:46] like
[40:47] that think of the the exercise of one
[40:50] trying to characterize this and it's not
[40:51] belittling if I could say this that when
[40:54] men rendered images like this it wasn't
[40:55] art for Arts sake they're trying
[40:57] convey a parable there's works of art
[41:00] that spelled uh like seven Works of
[41:02] Mercy H and these and some of these
[41:05] paintings that in the very image there's
[41:07] a sermon after sermon and scripture
[41:09] after scripture and there's a lot of
[41:11] symbolism and details trying to convey a
[41:12] moral message is trying to trying to
[41:15] share something it has usefulness beyond
[41:17] the the talent and the technicality of
[41:20] the art itself amen he says no matter
[41:23] how much this would even capture his
[41:25] physical image he says we don't know
[41:26] that he looked like that so we could
[41:29] never understand what he looked like by
[41:31] just painting a
[41:33] picture sir if somebody would come to
[41:35] the platform among us and have scars in
[41:37] his hands and nail prints and Thorn
[41:38] prints on his forehead and bleeding that
[41:40] wouldn't be
[41:41] Christ because when he comes every eye
[41:43] shall see him and every knee shall bow
[41:45] when that body returns to Earth again
[41:48] but what why could he be the same
[41:50] yesterday today and forever then we have
[41:53] to learn now what he is
[41:59] we have to learn what he
[42:00] is and the whole world now if I could
[42:03] say this about modern religion modern
[42:04] Christianity and if we're not careful it
[42:06] becomes a very the the message of the
[42:08] hour is just right lock in step with it
[42:09] maybe just a little bit of behind or
[42:11] message churches just a little bit
[42:12] behind schedule and they become art for
[42:15] art sake and you'll never see what God
[42:18] is in that sir you'll never see who
[42:20] Christ is you can never learn who Christ
[42:23] is Sir when it's art for art sake amen
[42:27] we need to learn what he
[42:31] is in order to know what he looks like
[42:35] today Jeremiah 13:16 give glory to the
[42:39] Lord your
[42:40] God notice how there's this urgency to
[42:43] it give glory to God before he caused
[42:46] darkness and before your feet stumble
[42:48] upon the dark mountains and while you
[42:49] look for light he turn it into the
[42:51] shadow of death and make it gross
[42:54] Darkness this is a great warning
[42:58] to give glory to God Amen give him the
[43:01] glory turn your eyes to him yes sir
[43:04] before he cause the light to be taken
[43:06] away and your Candlestick to be removed
[43:08] give glory to God seek his face before
[43:11] your feet stumble in darkness when
[43:13] you're looking for light and he turns it
[43:14] all to the shadow of death and makes it
[43:16] gross
[43:17] Darkness I say this with some with some
[43:20] Authority based upon the message of the
[43:22] hour religion and Christianity have all
[43:24] become mausoleums of Art yes sir or
[43:27] modern museums of Modern Art amen where
[43:31] all there is is abstraction and false
[43:32] Beauty and people are falling for it wow
[43:36] isn't this amazing isn't this beautiful
[43:37] and it's nothing more than false Beauty
[43:40] amen but there is on earth a living
[43:43] exhibit it's not Arizona Believers
[43:46] Church but it's those who are beholding
[43:48] the beauty of the
[43:49] Lord not a duct tape banana to a
[43:53] wall not
[43:55] comedians that was the name of that
[43:56] piece to Art you know uh comedy is art
[44:01] for the purpose of
[44:02] amusement that's what that's what it's
[44:04] become is a
[44:10] comedy brother Reggie shared this quote
[44:13] with me on
[44:14] Sunday I just feel It just fits
[44:16] perfectly here as we close this
[44:18] service when I was uh looking at life
[44:21] imitates art I had found many of those
[44:24] places where brother bam said that when
[44:25] he saw something he imitated it and he
[44:27] wanted to be uh you know would act out
[44:30] these scenes and that was the basis of
[44:32] the phrase originally life imitates art
[44:35] because the the author witnessed his own
[44:37] Sons reading these old stories and then
[44:39] acting them out in
[44:41] life and so brother bradam says when I
[44:45] was a little boy I read Edgar Rice's
[44:48] Burrows Edgar Rice Burrows Tarzan of the
[44:53] Apes I cut my mother's fur rug up to
[44:56] impersonate arzan this is a first
[44:59] edition this is what it would have
[45:00] looked like way back then with the time
[45:02] that brother Brandon may have read it
[45:03] they started coming out with subsequent
[45:04] editions but it says I remember reading
[45:06] Tarzan of the Apes and I cut my mother's
[45:08] fur rug up to impersonate Tarzan what
[45:11] would cause him to do that what he read
[45:14] what inspired him what he begin to
[45:16] imagine in his mind what it would be
[45:18] like and what it would feel like when I
[45:21] read the Lone Star Ranger I rode a hobby
[45:23] horse everywhere I went and there's the
[45:26] the book that he would have
[45:28] read what what was it that he read
[45:30] something that was maybe art for art
[45:33] sake and yet had inspired him but what
[45:35] did he represent what he had read but
[45:38] there was no truth in
[45:40] it but one day I picked up the
[45:44] Bible one day I picked up the Bible
[45:46] since then my desire is to be like him
[45:50] God let me let his life so flow through
[45:52] me may I clean myself away professing to
[45:54] be dead for 31 years now that Jesus
[45:57] might reflect himself only way I know he
[45:59] can do it is by his word just to be like
[46:02] Jesus oh yes just to be like
[46:07] Jesus what is it we're beholding I'm
[46:10] telling you right now there's a lot of
[46:11] art for art sake there's a lot of
[46:13] entertainment for entertainment sake
[46:15] that we spend a lot of our T time
[46:17] amusing ourselves with listen I love a
[46:20] good meme any time of the day but what
[46:22] is it for it's to amuse us it's caus us
[46:25] to laugh it's for volty it's art for art
[46:28] sake and the more we look at that the
[46:30] more that we're going to reflect that
[46:31] and unless we can get our eyes back to
[46:34] the word of God beholding that we'll
[46:36] never be the light Bringers that we are
[46:38] called to be thank you Lord one day I
[46:42] picked up the Bible and that's when the
[46:43] desires changed yes
[46:45] sir yes
[46:47] sir what God has written in his word
[46:50] what he has spoken in his word in this
[46:52] hour he wants to be displayed in flesh
[46:55] this the phrase that you should constant
[46:57] remember a life lived by the word would
[46:58] be the word
[47:00] expressed our life should imitate art
[47:03] and that your life would reflect the
[47:04] beauty of the
[47:06] Lord Brothers you could come to your
[47:08] instruments tonight if we can behold his
[47:11] Beauty in the
[47:13] word we'll learn his principles of
[47:16] beauty because it's not just art for art
[47:19] sake we're not just going to look at
[47:21] like wow that's a that's a banana and
[47:22] that's duct tape and people like this
[47:24] and everybody's wondering what this is
[47:26] but you're going to see something
[47:26] something in it because the word of God
[47:28] the Bible the scriptures given by
[47:30] inspiration brother Bram said it's the
[47:31] art of God he's the artist he's the
[47:34] author and it's it's for reproof and
[47:37] instruction it's
[47:38] profitable it's not just word for word
[47:40] sake it has a meaning and a purpose and
[47:42] intent to mold you as we read his word
[47:45] as we listen to the message of the art
[47:46] we're learning true principles of
[47:48] beauty it's art for God's
[47:51] sake where he wants to use your life not
[47:55] for the purpose of you bragging about
[47:57] how Christian you are but so that it
[48:00] would draw others to
[48:06] Christ I think we get super defensive
[48:08] sometimes when we
[48:09] hear criticisms of of the message and
[48:13] some of the ways that it's run down and
[48:15] dragged through the mud and they could
[48:17] go on a a two- week long series of
[48:18] articles that hit the front page of a
[48:20] newspaper just dragging the message
[48:21] through the mud and we might get our
[48:23] Gander up about it but you know if
[48:24] you're honest with yourselves you said
[48:25] some of the same things about people
[48:26] people in the message about church
[48:29] experiences and I'm not saying you were
[48:30] necessarily right but some of us have
[48:32] seen nothing but art for art
[48:37] sake and it it didn't attract us it
[48:39] didn't draw us if anything we just kind
[48:41] of bared it and just wanted to see the
[48:44] clothes so that we didn't appear to be
[48:46] unbelievers and we wanted to pretend it
[48:48] was right and it was good like yeah it's
[48:49] okay if we get beat up by the deacons
[48:51] right right it's okay this is good this
[48:52] is good right they're going to beat the
[48:54] devil out of us people endured things
[48:56] for the sake of Conformity and fear and
[48:58] everyone blending in and looking the
[49:02] same and what what what did that do it
[49:04] pushed people away and were honest for
[49:07] good
[49:08] reason but God is calling us to be the
[49:11] kind of light that others can see not
[49:13] everybody's going to see it but they'll
[49:15] see it and it'll draw them to
[49:19] him when he says now you are light and
[49:22] he prayed that we would share Glory it
[49:23] was not that we would that our life
[49:26] would be seen or that our light would
[49:29] shine but it would be his light his
[49:32] glory and it's actually that that hides
[49:35] your
[49:37] life that the more of him that could be
[49:40] expressed the less of you that is seen
[49:42] and the more that you exhibit
[49:44] Christ this life is light for the world
[49:50] today I want to finish from reading that
[49:52] devotional I just read to you a moment
[49:54] ago or this collection of morning
[49:56] devotions at this Theological Seminary
[49:57] in the
[49:59] 1800s he writes this way I'll try to
[50:01] express it in a way that doesn't seem to
[50:03] be too uh too much anent language but
[50:05] indeed there's rarely much that is
[50:07] glorious or great about so slightly or
[50:09] evanescent of a thing a thing as a human
[50:12] life in other words human life in itself
[50:15] isn't really glorious and nothing really
[50:17] radiant or evanescent about it he says
[50:19] the glory of it lies in it being able to
[50:22] say the glory that thou Hast given me I
[50:25] give them this is the real glory the
[50:28] real light of a human life is to be able
[50:30] to say its real powers and be able to
[50:32] say the glory that I have received I
[50:34] give them the worth of life is in its
[50:36] transmissive
[50:38] capacity in your ability to shine light
[50:41] in your ability to reprove and make
[50:42] manifest in the wonderful system of the
[50:45] telephone I love this this is great
[50:47] written in the 1800s uh 1890s or so in
[50:50] the wonderful system of the telephone
[50:52] with its Miracle of intercommunication
[50:54] there is as you know at each instrument
[50:56] that little film of metal which we call
[50:58] the transmitter into which the message
[51:00] is delivered and whose vibrations are
[51:02] repeated scores of miles away real
[51:05] brother Bram uses the same example in
[51:08] some of his sermons about a microphone
[51:09] and a transmitter he says every human
[51:11] life is a
[51:12] transmitter take away from it its
[51:15] transmissive purpose and what a poor
[51:17] insignificant film a human life may be
[51:21] yes sir but set it where it belongs in
[51:24] the great system where it has its part
[51:26] and that insignificant film is dignified
[51:28] with a new
[51:30] significance it is if it is as if it
[51:33] said to its God the message that thou
[51:35] givest me I give to
[51:38] them and every word of God that is
[51:41] spoken into it is delivered through it
[51:43] to the lives that are wearily waiting
[51:46] for the message as though it were far
[51:49] away I know it may describe it in a
[51:52] language that children can't understand
[51:53] today and some of us have gotten so far
[51:55] away from but perhaps another analogy
[51:57] could be given to the very technology
[51:59] that exists within our computers and our
[52:01] phones and our iPads to say that that
[52:03] peace in itself is insignificant but
[52:06] once it's incorporated into the great
[52:08] system that insignificant peace is
[52:11] dignified with a new significance as if
[52:13] it has said to God the message which you
[52:16] are giving me I give them and every
[52:20] light that you shine into me every word
[52:22] that you speak into me I will deliver it
[52:24] through my life and to the lives of
[52:26] those those that are eagerly and wearily
[52:28] waiting for the message even though they
[52:30] may be far
[52:33] away oh God let me be light for your
[52:37] sake notice when we read it that we
[52:39] might be
[52:43] glorified that men might
[52:46] see let your light
[52:49] shine so that men would see your good
[52:52] works and in doing so go my that brother
[52:55] Michael's quite a guy isn't he
[52:57] they would glorify their
[53:00] father your father which is in
[53:03] heaven we're to we are to be art for
[53:06] God's sake not for the church's sake not
[53:09] for your Pride's sake if it's for
[53:10] yourself you're complete in yourself
[53:13] you're art for art sake if it's merely
[53:15] to give pleasure to other people to
[53:16] impress other people that's art for Arts
[53:18] sake but when you can be a light for
[53:20] their sake and for God's
[53:23] sake that's
[53:25] light let's pray tonight you could stand
[53:27] to your feet thank you for your
[53:30] attention the feedback has been
[53:32] encouraging though I realize that maybe
[53:34] in some ways it's a unique way to
[53:36] approach the
[53:37] word but there's a lot in here for us to
[53:39] be encouraged
[53:42] by step into our place and our position
[53:44] in this hour our gracious Heavenly
[53:47] Father Lord we believe that the whole
[53:49] world is groping in
[53:52] darkness and that as long as we are HID
[53:55] as long as we are allowing the word
[53:56] World itself to shut out our light and
[53:58] to keep us covered up with complexes and
[54:01] insecurities and as long as we're hiding
[54:04] behind pretense and
[54:06] vanity This Little Light of Mine is
[54:08] never going to
[54:11] shine and if it shines not Lord then
[54:14] who's going to see you who's going to
[54:16] know
[54:18] you I pray Lord that you
[54:21] would let my life be a reflection let it
[54:24] be a voice
[54:29] Lord as a song is sung ain't no stone
[54:31] going to sing in my
[54:34] place as long as I'm alive I'll glorify
[54:36] and praise your name I want it to Lord I
[54:39] need it to so Lord I know nothing else
[54:42] but to ask that your light would shine
[54:44] on me Let It Shine into my heart let the
[54:46] light of this glorious gospel shine into
[54:48] me that I might see and know this
[54:50] glorious image of you that I would not
[54:53] just behold your beauty but understand
[54:55] that this is a sh shed in transmuted
[54:58] mitted
[54:59] beauty that there is a Transfiguration
[55:01] again in this hour where I am coming
[55:03] into your image and the flesh is
[55:05] becoming
[55:08] word as unorthodox as that may seem and
[55:11] as unreal as that may seem that is the
[55:14] realism in this hour is that as the word
[55:16] impresses us there is this new
[55:19] Renaissance Lord there is this new
[55:20] Revolution of faith and belief where God
[55:23] is being expressed in flesh again
[55:28] and Lord I pray that we would not let
[55:29] Art For Art's Sake and that
[55:31] movement that wants to stoke our
[55:34] imaginations and our
[55:35] emotions to Thrill us in our minds
[55:38] either to intellect or emotion may it
[55:40] not sway us from this godsent truth that
[55:43] you're here in our midst revealing
[55:46] yourself the same yesterday today and
[55:48] forever and revealing to us through your
[55:50] word who you
[55:52] are that we can manifest you your nature
[55:54] and your character thank you Lord and
[55:57] Lord I pray that we would not find Value
[55:59] in things that are lies things that are
[56:01] untrue and things that exist merely for
[56:03] art sake or the abstract or the false
[56:06] Beauty and where Lord we can't seem to
[56:09] make sense of the picture and things
[56:10] aren't clear may you shine your light on
[56:14] it so that your beauty could Inspire us
[56:16] to Greater
[56:18] Beauty and more Beauty in our lives
[56:21] bless your people tonight I pray be with
[56:23] us as we are
[56:24] dismissed and you encourage us greatly
[56:27] Lord in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we
[56:29] pray amen
