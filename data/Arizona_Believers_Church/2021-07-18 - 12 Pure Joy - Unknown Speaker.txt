TRANSCRIPT
========================================
nehemiah chapter eight i'd like just to read one um one verse verse 10 and uh realizing that there's some things maybe that we might be missing a little bit by not reading verses one two 14 which is kind of what i've been looking at and studying but we'll just read verse 10 for time's sake this morning nehemiah chapter 8 verse 10. then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet can we say amen to that too many fat free things and no sugars anymore brother vincent hey man right we just claim it we accept it go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto our lord neither be sorry for the joy of the lord is your strength for the joy of the lord is your strength god bless you you can be seated if you look at the title slide we're preaching today on pure joy and you say brother aaron you've been preaching on pure joy for the last several services well today we're finally preaching on pure joy we first begin to look at it god dealt with the hearts on different subjects in terms of uh i think invert always invert i hadn't really premeditated doing a little bit of a review but maybe we'll just do it as it comes to mind and then we spoke on the joy of motherhood and then on vietnam and the victory ahead is victory now and then over the last few when we preached on a clean conscience and then over the last few services we had been preaching on being wide awake and each one of those elements uh dealt with the conditions for pure joy but what initially inspired this thought on pure joy is really what i'm going to be preaching today and in doing so maybe throwing a lot of things out there for us to digest and to ponder and to think about and i trust that you could just be real attentive and uh and just open in your hearts because it might be easy to hear some things and then kind of try to put them in a particular category and say oh well this is the point that's being made there if you begin to quote brother branham a lot sometimes there might be a tendency think oh well this is the direction he's going there but if you're a christian today if you are a believer in your heart then you can say god you desire to speak to me and that's the vessel that's standing there today to speak so you use him to speak to my heart and you just have that confidence in that dynamic that it's not about vindicating brother aaron it's not about confirming whether or not arizona believers church is is the right thing but rather as far as you as an individual in your relationship with christ there's a there's a man standing before me today with the bible open before him who's going to be preaching the word of god therefore as a believer and as a son or daughter of god then you use that to speak to me because that's what's most important is your individual relationship with the lord and how he speaks to you and directs you so i gonna just take this subject and actually i'm just gonna start with the statement from this third seal and i think yourselves you can maybe see who've been here through several services see all these things connect together brother branham is talking about how that the church has as god dealt with the church through the church ages there had been this birth of the christian church then the scriptures teach us that the antichrist spirit comes into the church defiling it making it lukewarm and powerless and eventually gets to the place where it goes into the ground and dies and then god's going to bring it back to a process of reformation and in doing so it's going to bring back certain elements and things into the church but it in this process of restoration and this reformation it comes to a place where it still has not yet received that life messenger and hasn't received that final climactic restoration back to what god had envisioned the church to be in the very beginning so he's identifying that even through what seems to be a reviving in building back of the church god's sending a message god bringing back certain truths and god establishing certain things within the within the church that there had not yet been a prophetic a fulfillment of things promised to come to the church and he makes this statement in the third seal now that's what's the reason today that the revivals we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we have not had a real stirring so think of that phrase i want to come back to it stirring we've had revivals denominationally qualified as a denominational revivals but not a real stirring no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they got millions and millions of church members but not a revival nowhere that that instructs us that we do not we're not counting church members to determine whether or not god is moving i could you imagine if we use those metrics today we would look at jesus with 12 disciples and say failure right you only got 12 people that want to follow him you think of we you think in the upper room after jesus's ministry and everything that he had said and done you think 120 people in the upper room we'd say that's nothing that doesn't even get into message mega church category that that's we would we would just begin immediately begin to have a lot of different judgments but he says it's not the church members he says no no so it's seven times that he's making this uh a reference that there's not has not been a real stirring or real revival and then he qualifies it this way the bride has not had a revival yet so the church he's going to maybe background a little bit more well you see how he says it here the the church has had revivals denominations have had revivals but as far as the bride's revival that has not come yet there has been no revival there and then he says he kind of defines revival this way no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet said real stirring now there's been no manifestation to stir the bride yet we are looking for it he says it will take those seven unknown thunders back there and he's referring to the seven unknown thunders that are prophesied in the book of revelation to wake her up again he will send it he promised it so there's there's a lot here i want you to hold in your minds and again don't try to make this theology or even history please don't just make it history and don't make it these mysterious things and the symbols in the book of revelation that you just lead leave to the theologians but make this very personal how god would want to strike this in your heart but brother branham is saying that the seven thunders are the manifestation of god that wakes up the bride and so now that may seem to be oh the seven seven thunders uttered their voices when each seal is open there's a a thunder that goes forth there's a way that we begin to think historically or theo as far as theology and it can become something that's much bigger in our minds and detached from something very personal but i want you just to take the language and not attach anything to it but just say well lord what does that mean to me personally and so once that those thunders as he called the seven mysterious unknown thunders once that wakes up the bride she now has a spiritual consciousness to see the word unfold as long as she's slumbering and sleep as long as she's laying there remember there was a stimulating cry that goes forth and the parable of the ten virgins and it's at that stimulating cry that the wise virgins wake up and that they have oil in their lamps and they can go out and meet the lord so there's something that wakes her up and then even when you read it and i had this discussion one time with another a number of different ministers and and i i kind of just made the point it doesn't say that the stimulating cry wakes up the foolish it just says there was a stimulating cry and all of them awoke and it was the wise who had oil on their lamp and and and they're the ones that are stimulated and have the right materials and the things necessary to go out and meet the lord so once that cry goes forth and wakes us up and and causes us to raise to our feet then we have a spiritual consciousness of the things that unfold thereafter it wasn't like an alarm went off and they wake up like all right what are we doing kind of like sometimes we'll we forget to change our alarm or set it to where it doesn't go off on a saturday and our alarm goes off and we wake up we're like oh i got to get oh no it's not work today what am i up for why am i awake oh i forgot to set my you know turn my alarm off and there's really no purpose now for waking up they are awake to then understand what what's taking place next and where they needed to be next and so this is kind of the process that begins to unfold in type here how there's a awakening up of the bride think individual members now and then they have a consciousness of what god is doing what god's will is and what he desires for your personal life what he's doing with the bride and then walking in that unfolding word is what's going to be the bride's revival or the bride's joy being woke up it's not a dream this message is not a dream and in this world we may say it's a nightmare and it's chaos but our reality is something very very great something very very wonderful what we believe in what we're fellowshipping in is not imagination uh what we believe is not fables and stories and i hope so and so when we wake up it's we're waking up to a spiritual reality that we can begin to walk in even in the midst of laodicea in the midst of chaos and then that becomes our joy walking in the word of god and so that's ah that's you gonna be your satisfaction if i could say this that there's a there's a god wants to wake us up to the word of god and in waking us up he wants to then teach us and cause his word to unfold and then walking in this now don't make that something very weird and strange it's just your daily life him him living through you fulfilling the word of god that's what we're talking about you say well does that mean i i got to go overseas and raise the dead in an evangelistic missionary trip no just do what god called you to do right in whatever zip code you're in that's what we mean about walking in the word of god and watching unfold and that's how you're going to be satisfied there there's there's sometimes there's this emptiness and this longing in our hearts things just aren't right and things just start lining up and and we feel that maybe something is wrong and really we just need we can keep doing what we're doing we just need to get into the channel of god's word and reestablish a connection with jesus christ it's like oh i don't need to quit my job oh i don't need to move over here i just needed to be in that channel where the word of god is feeding my heart and then then life becomes more fulfilling can anybody say amen to that that there's things that maybe don't dramatically change in the outside but something changes on the inside and then everything feels right that's what we're identifying a satisfaction and a fulfillment that comes to the believer and as the children of god we're we're moved by the word of god as the children of god were ant animated and moved by the spirit of god and it's in being moved by the word of god being excited and inspired by the spirit of god that is what becomes the source of our happiness when we know that we've done the right thing when we know we have this consciousness of the things around us a spiritual conscience that kind of directs us and says this is the right thing to do and then when we've done that regardless of what everyone else has to say about it we have a sense of satisfaction and it's when you're uncertain about what you're doing whether it's right or whether it's pleasing to the lord that's when the critics seem to have some weight it's when you're uncertain but when you know you've done the right thing you can let family reject you you can let friends forsake you you can let a lot of things begin to happen in the world around you and you say lord i know i pleased you and that's what really that's what thrills me and makes me feel good just as jesus said he said my meat when he's speaking as the son of god my meat is to do the will of him that sent me that's what fulfills that's what satisfies that's what energizes and i believe that we as spiritual sons and daughters of god need to have that kind of attitude that at the end of the day my substance my my thrill my enthusiasm my ambition is to do god's will we know that we're taught very well in the word of god in terms of identifying whether or not it is god's will and we can look to the word first and if it lines up with the word we begin to check our motive and objective but it's when those things are when we're abiding in that and we're in continuity with the word of god in harmony with the spirit of god that's when we can smile and have a real smile not something synthetic or man-made i want to identify two different terms stirring and revival because they are kind of central to the statement brother bannon is making in the third seal about how the church hasn't had a real stirring it hasn't had the and he says the bride hasn't had a revival yet stirring means a beginning to move when you say that um are the kids up well they're just beginning to stir there's something they're beginning to move it means to be an active motion it speaks to being animated or arousing up these are just the words that it means even in its etymology that it's this is the idea and the thought behind a stir beginning to a stirring it's a beginning to move it means to move or to excite so this is a moving there has not been a real moving yet there's got to be a moving an animation emotion as we read in the book of ezekiel that there was there was activity in that these dry bones begin to assemble themselves back together in sin you and muscle and flesh begin to be added to it to where you could look at and says now these are bodies and so there's been a move and there's been activity but it says that the question was can they live not just can they reassemble and look like they're living not can it just look like a body not can it just look like a church and function as a church but can these dry bones live and then when the word of god this prophecy goes forth and it's life that comes into it the prophecy of the word of god life comes into these these bodies that look like their bodies maybe look like they're sleeping life comes into it and they raise upon their feet what an exceeding great army that's the stirring not the adding to the bones and muscle insinion those things but when there's something that animates it and gives it life it moves it and excites it and it stood on its feet and exceeding great army that's that's the thoughts of a story in a moving to have a revival it's an awakening it's the act of reviving a revival is the act of reviving it so it speaks of living again and having life again and sometimes we as individuals and and i want to say this very tenderly we as born-again christians go through circumstances in our lives where we come up against a wall and we feel like we just want to live again any anybody ever felt that way before where it's like man i just i want to feel alive again i want to feel enthusiasm i i want to be excited and i've lost my enthusiasm for this and i've lost my enthusiasm for that and the word of god says that when and i'm saying this on a sunday to people who came to church today and overcame many obstacles so i'm not preaching to you i'm talking to the people on the internet where you read where god says that you know when the church doors are open you should be there and you find yourself just it's difficult sometimes and you just don't have the enthusiasm and you begin to think about all the things that keep your way and so the word of god which ought to be an encouragement just does what just seems to bury you even more and you find yourself just i'm just wanting to feel again and live again and enjoy again and have excitement and and enjoy the word of god and fellowship with one another and that's what god offers to you through the word of god don't despair of your election don't begin to doubt that god has been there dealing with your heart don't doubt the experiences you've had with the word don't doubt the experiences you've had with the holy ghost sometimes what we want to do is go back and re-experience something else but god says you've had that experience i've got something new and different for you our prayers just to be lord i want to live again help me to feel again let me live again but but not maybe something i've been before but may it be this time of maturing and a growing up that's what reviving is it's it's to regain consciousness sometimes it's a little bit of an amnesia that the spirit needs to drive away to revive it means to recover health speaks of a restoration of restoring so he says a real stirring and a revival it's an awakening it's a beginning to move it's an activity it's a motion and in the message the invisible union of the bride the heavily invisible unit of the bride of christ he says some of you people that really believe this to be the truth think of how we're saying this some of you people that really believe this to be the truth that we are entering another age that's a that's uh for people who are well read that all of a sudden becomes a very interesting statement we're entering the rapture age you know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better it must get worse i think of the parallel now to where the church in its condition it's just going to get worse he says how many knows that say amen it's got to get worse in other words no matter how good it is it doesn't have what it takes to get gooder right it's just going it's bad getting worse so there there has to be the crossing of something and the moving beyond something entering into something else to where it's it's all it's good getting better it has to be that way he says it can't go like this it's god and he he's and you say where do you get that from well i kind of read beforehand i know where he's going with this he says how many knows that say amen it's going to get worse it can't go like it's got to be something so there's something coming there's got to be something that comes to the church and it's moving right now friend this is exciting it's on the move is on for the bride that's the truth i love this that thus saith the lord we have thus saith the lord that the move is on for the bride we're not sitting around waiting for it we have thus saith the lord taking place the something had come this is the truth we entered into another time in another season the move is on for the bride what is it it's a real stirring it's the bride's revival this this he's saying has come do you believe that you believe that god has made available to you today an opportunity to be stirred to be enthused to be excited about the things of god now as brother branham is using this language he's saying how the seven thunders hold this revelation of jesus christ to give life to give joy to give peace this is all these fruits of the spirit and these wonderful things that we read about in the word of god that there's a there's a discipline that we have to have in the scriptures that when we see god doing something and he's fulfilling the word of god we you have to recognize that there's things that are in the word of god that are permanent and there's things that must proportion and when god begins to move and to do something and we're entering a rapture age engine of the rapture he's doesn't mean we're leaving divine healing behind could you imagine that i was having this fellowship with brother tim pruitt here recently and how that when i was in the uh when i raised in the message we believe in divine healing and so whenever you read in the uh in the word of god where it says and that denying divine healing and believing the days of miracles are passed it's like well we believe in miracles we see miracles how can there be a people that believe the days of miracles are passed and then the more you learn and the more you understand in the in the economical world and the in the secular world and the world around us and then even sometimes it begins to kind of creep into those we fellowship with to think that well because this has happened the days of miracles are past and we have to we have to be very disciplined in the word of god to say let's just say that god there's a prophecy in the word that billions of people are looking to that this is going to be fulfilled this is one day going to happen when it begins to dawn on us that god is fulfilling his word we have to realize that this fits within the context and the whole of god's word and so when we talk about oh the word of god in the last days whatever's in the word of god is a part of that word and we can't we don't want to separate ourselves from the fruits of the spirit and in life and joy and peace and overcoming and holiness and sanctification and those things are all part of this great climactic move of god to translate your body into a brand new one and so it's those may seem to be real spiritual real theological these seven thunders which reveal jesus christ but in revealing him it gives you life and reveal him it gives you joy and revealing him it gives you peace but ram says on the first seal and i don't believe i have this statement there because it's a real short man short statement i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith i think that's just real good summary language to say well uh you're taken out of context well this is a statement it's very direct he's given us a definition seven thunders will be revealed in order to or for the purpose of getting the bride together so the revelation contained in that word gathers the bride together and it brings rapturing faith now this is i've been saying this uh a few times already don't get mysterious with it don't try to make yourself different think very practical think very practical think about the things that matter to you in this life think about the things that weigh upon your soul think about the decisions you're having to make think about raising your children loving your wife think about uh uh all the things that relate to this natural life and instead of getting in your minds that there's some sort of virtual reality that we're trying to enter into and i'm just gonna detach myself from laodicea and i'm gonna live in this fake that's not fake but this world of my faith imagine faith and this hope and i'm going to live detached in this realm over here and somewhere in there all the sevens line up and all the threes line up and then we enter into an eight and then we have this and we have that and it's just this some other world over here very ethereal that we're trying to live inside of and then we're missing the whole point in the whole thing it's very very practical it's very practical these things when you begin to talk about the seven seals and the open of the word of god and the third poll in the reveal and the son of man we go wow that's really really deep well it's very very practical extremely practical and so don't don't so think practically today if you've had a prayer if you've had a need if you have something in your life that you feel that god needs to address he's going to do it through the word of god and he's going to do it through opening up the word of god to your hearts and giving you understanding in the word of god so there's a lot it goes into it and i say well you know i really want to understand the seven seals but i'm really having a hard time knowing how to raise my kids if you could just somehow not think of those being two separate things but realizing what you really want at the end today is the mind of christ how to address emotional needs in your family and how to address rebellion or hardness of heart and your children and what you really need at the end of the day is the revelation of jesus christ to come and connect with your love of god you have for your children and give you the direction that you need and those aren't two separate things one's a need and the other's the solution and these things can harmonize and line right up maybe we've created this dichotomy in the message where you have the deep preachers and you have the practical preachers wow let those brothers do the marriage banquet let them do the men's meetings let them do the marriage counseling and then we've got these brothers over here that can dig into the deep things listen the time has come to where they are one and the same and there's not a dichotomy where it comes to where the word of god is leading and where the spirit of god is leading is because we need that revealed word to come to bear on the things that matter and there's not a separation maybe we need to kind of change our attitude a little bit towards certain ministries that really emphasized certain truths and certain things and maybe we put these in the chat oh they're just a deep preacher well they're just a simple preacher maybe you begin to realize that the deep preachers dealing with simple things and the simple preachers making a deep impact in people's lives and not make them two different camps or two different approaches but all the word of god for the benefit of the bride to come to rapturing faith now revisiting again the message invisible union we had read from paragraph 379 i'm going to read from two places paragraph 49 and then paragraph 202 just so you can see how some things that we will read in the message of the hour where it appears as if brother branham even late in his ministry is saying something that projects something way into the future so we could take that steps oh well brother man said we're looking for it and this was in november of 1965 and you find that within the same message he kind of closes that loop and and the very thing is trying to condition the people to open their eyes to consider and see he closes it at the very end and says and what i told you you were looking for in the beginning do you see it now in the end he brings that out so he says but watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival now he says it later on in paragraph 379 the move is on for the bribe her stirring her move her awakening the move is on for the bride so earlier in the message he says when that spiritual bride when she begins to have revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of god that's all it takes for you to have a revival in your life just line yourself up with the word of god you've been praying for revival then ask yourself where do i know i'm not lining up with the word of god and just line yourself up that's all it takes for revivals someone the other day confessed to me they said they they they said that they were backslid i'd asked them a very simple question they said i'm backslid i'm like whoa tmi i was just wanting to know i had a simple question and now you really opened up to me but the reality was they confessed that because they were doing they were not doing one thing that they knew god wanted to do they were backslid and you know what's so awesome about that if they want to have revival all they have to do is do what they know they should do and it can bring a revival so this is part of the bride's revival coming back and lining ourselves up with the word of god when that happens watch then again you see how the scriptures at that time there'll be a message sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman elect so there's a message that catches as he says it's going to be those uh seven known unknown thunders that wake her up again and give her that revival it's the seven thunders that gather the bride together get the bride together for rapturing faith he's saying it's the message that goes out and catches so paragraph 49 it seems to be kind of future looking that when she begins when she does there will be but now notice paragraph 202 remember what time is it sir how many ever heard it he's going back to what he preached at the end of 62 and i had some statements from that sermon but i realized i i don't need to substantiate that in great detail we'll just make reference say say amen if you heard it what was it exactly and in that he's talking about the seven thunder's coming to gather together the elect he says then we've got now how he says it then we've got the revelation in the last days for the message of the lord god to gather his bride together he says in one hand it's going to come and now he says we've got it we've got the message of the lord god to gather his bride together so the elements that are necessary to gather the bride together are not a future promise in that we're still waiting for a point in time in a juncture to pass to where once time has come to this place and we begin to enter this rapture and age that's when this is going to be made available but it's just like it was when he told the disciples to go and tarry in jerusalem until and what did they have to wait until until the day of pentecost because that was a particular junction in time and then so they waited until that time and then once that time came the spirit of god was poured out upon them from that moment on it became from then on until the rapture the age of the holy ghost for the true believer and nobody has ever been waiting for a day on the calendar in that sense ever again because the fullness of time had come this time had come where it reached this point where now god says now i'm transitioning and he poured out a spirit from that point on you can walk in that now we could say that there's many came along and then the gospel turned to the gentiles and there was times where other people came into the revelation of it and it's in that same sense i know i'm going really fast but i'm inspired it's in that same sense that there comes a point in time where we say we've entered into a new dispensation the message has come to gather the bride together and though it took decades before we were gathered the time had come and the season was now and we're walking in that and living in that and i believe there's others that need to hear about the gathering and can benefit from it so he says we got the revelation the move is on thus saith the lord the move is on for the bride he says in the fourth seal there's a power now this is where i realize now in my mind it makes perfect sense but now i want to connect this back to he says there's a revelation in the last days and i'm wanting to see this as a child of god what inspires you what thrills you if you felt like something's been lacking in your heart it might just be simply understanding something again nothing needs to change you just need to understand i'm looking too much to the natural things for my joy i'm looking too much to natural signs and natural wonders i'm looking too much to natural factors when i can just look to god fulfilling his word and that stimulates me job may never change raise may never come borders may never open that vacation you paid for to go to europe may never may never be used all these other things may never happen but when you see god with fulfilling his word then there's something a deep contentment a deep satisfaction saying lord i know i know you're with me but tomorrow i don't have any word on the lord about vacations or europe so you just whatever god's whatever before i know he loves to travel and i think they got a vacation coming up you know i hope the lord makes a way for you but that's the way we have to be right hey even if all these other things aren't happening when we can see that the word of god is being fulfilled that brings my contentment that brings my joy and he says it this way there's a lot more that can be shared in this but i just wanted to say it just to bring that impact there's a power of the revelation of the word that gives stimulation of joy to the believer there's this access to something there's the power of the revelation of the word that gives stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction the stimulation that it's vindicated it's proved have you ever watched somebody and maybe this could be said more to us um our the boring parents those of us here who don't connect with the youth of today and we see them doing something like you enjoy that that's fun and like oh yeah this is just amazing this is awesome you just kind of look at it going i i don't i don't see what's in it i i don't get it but people can just be enthus enthusiastic about it really really loving it doesn't have to be the kids i think sometimes the kids look at us adults like you like that that's boring anyways different people could be stimulated by different things and entertained by different things like oh i'm gonna go bird watching and i'm gonna sit around and watch birds and they got the binoculars and they got the book and they're part of the national autobahn society and they just they just love it right and like yeah i mean i i'm part of the grass growing society i love to watch grass grow and some people just have different things that excite them enthu and give them enthusiasm but notice this there's a power of revelation of the word this is for every believer there is a stimulation there is a source of enthusiasm there's a source of ambition there's something that can give you get you out of bed in the morning no matter what you're going through there's a power of the revelation of the word of god there's a lot like what a natural body that gives stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction the stimulation that it's vindicated it's proved praise the lord i believe sometimes what the devil wants to do with us is not merely uh not just completely destroy our lives but just give us this sense of accepting delayed joy and lord you can't you can't convince me this isn't right you can't convince me that this is not a promise you can't convince or this is a promise that's not for me there's just a way that maybe the devil says well i'm going to leave you alone in that but if there's just a way that he can get us to this place of your joy is delayed your hope is delayed what what you're wanting what you're looking for what you want to have what you want to see well it's it's not going to happen for a while and since it's not going to happen for a while then you can't receive the benefit of it you can't be happy about it you can't uh you can't be enthused you realize in the scripture paul preaches and he says he talked about the joy and the uh of the of the coming of the lord and a joy that they ought to have just expecting it there was a joy and enthusiasm that the believer could have just expecting the promise to come so if if something has not yet come and you've received it faith is the evidence of it right faith being the evidence of it gives you substance that you can celebrate of with and you can be happy of just as abraham and sarah could have just been just as excited that a baby was coming without any evidence of it and been happy and joyful and encouraged and looking forward to it that's the way that we ought to be and not allow the devil to get us to accept some delayed joy because when he does that we become unsettled we come become a little bit restless and i think what satan tries to preach sometimes to us is someday has anybody heard his sermon someday recently have you heard anybody heard his sermon someday he preaches it to us all the time i mean he's on part 100 billion right i mean brother donnie reagan's got nothing on the devil when it comes to continuing a series i mean this is this is somebody who preaches it all the time someday someday someday now i want to look at nehemiah chapter nehemiah chapter 8 and let me just give some real quick summary language about the nehemiah it's a time of revival children of israel in bondage exiled in babylon and now they're granted this leave to come back and build back the walls of jerusalem and there's it's an incredible story of god restoring and building back and i believe it's even some say that the book like the book of esther is you know in this chronology it fits there between the sixth and seventh chapter so you can see that there's a time when children are in babylon they're in captivity these are the things that are taking place uh uh the walls have been torn down they were worshiping false gods and false idols they've been taken captive because of that so as a direct result of their disobedience that they're made captives in babylon but god just grants this moves upon the king's heart and they're allowed to go back and begin to build back the walls and there's a there's people that oppose it there's these three different ones is sambaloft and these different ones are coming against them trying to intimidate them and threaten them and uh and sending letters and wanting to get them to meet in the valley of of oh no and all these different ways that they're trying to come against them and so what we we're seeing in the book of nehemiah is a restoration restoration of the things of god it is a revival it's the people coming back to the word and lining up with the word of god and as we've read already how that there's going to be a message that gathers the people together this verse 1 stands out to me it says in nehemiah chapter 8 verse 1 and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the watergate and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had commanded to israel now when you read this i want this to stand out to you it just says all the people gathered themselves together when you read that it is only the people that are mentioned and then the people speak to ezra to get the book so the gathering this is a supernatural gathering this is a gathering that is not inspired it's not done it doesn't say it was done by nehemiah it doesn't say it was done by ezra but this was a gathering that was done by god he caused the people to be gathered together and the desire of the people was that the word would be brought forth bring us the word anything that we've lost anything that's been taken away anything that's been hid the people gather themselves together as one man that's got to be a supernatural gathering where people could come together as one and then something is moving in their hearts they're all in one spirit in one accord and they're all gathered together one heart one mind one accord all gathered together as one man and they've got thousands of this place this is god that's bringing them together and you'll find a parallel prophecy in zephaniah chapter 3 verses 14 to 20. and when i read this just pick up on the principles because i just want to read through it as we run out of time saying oh daughter of zion and brother brown says in one place zion is the bride always the bride is what he says in that one place a daughter's eye shout o israel be glad and rejoice with all the heart oh daughter of jerusalem the lord hath taken away thy judgments he have cast out thine enemy the king of israel even the lord is in the midst of thee oh praise the lord thou shalt not see evil anymore in that day it shall be said to jerusalem fear not and to zion let not thy hands be slack take this as prophecy to you as an individual prophecy to the bride be glad and rejoice with all your heart because the lord is in the midst of thee let these hands that have been bound and been hanging down let them be raised verse 17 the lord thy god in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy over thee with singing this is the attitude of a bridegroom to his bride he will rest in his love he will rejoice over thee with joy he will joy over thee with singing what will that produce in you a same joy the same rest the same love and he says i will gather them not man not man's revival not teaching not organization not ecumenical moves i will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly who are who are of thee to whom the reproach of it was a burden behold at that time i will undo all that afflict thee i will save her that halteth and gather her that was driven out and i will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame at that time will i bring you again the lord bringing against zion restoring back the bride bringing her back for her revival even in the time that i gather you says the people gather themselves together this was god doing it this was god bringing them back for the restoration of the temple the restoration of these walls i will bring you again for i will make you a name and a praise among all the people of the earth when i turn back your captivity before your eyes saith the lord and just as we see in the scripture nehemiah chapter 8 that the they were gathered together as one man and we see in zephaniah that it prophesies that he will bring you again and gather you together it's the exact language that god is using this end time that there's going to be a message to gather the bride together maybe there was a time we thought we'd all gather in some particular place right well everyone's going to move to tucson or everyone's going to move to lima everybody's going to move here it's not geographical saints it's not geographical maybe the borders shut down just so that we don't get in our minds that we're all got to end up somewhere in some place and that's where the bride has gathered she's gathered in christ she's gathered the entrance is ministered unto her no matter where she is in the jungles of south america if she's in the the deserts of africa whatever it may be the word is going to find her and bring her to the place where the bride is gathered and so as they gather together as one man the word of god gathering them to the word to himself it says in verse five and ezra opened the book and the sight of all the people for he was above all the people it says he opened the book everyone saw that the book was opened you catch that that's exactly how this had to be when they were all gathered gathered together as one man and god brings the spiritual gathering ezra opened the book inside of all the people and everyone could agree he opened the book is open there was nobody beginning well no i don't think he's opened it they did it in such a way god when they brought him together and they seated everybody and raised him up they could see that he had opened it and it was once they knew the book was open all the people stood up take these things into your heart today and make spiritual application yourself this is such a beautiful scene when ezra who is a scribe and a priest he comes and he opens the book and as people's book was opened that's what caused them to stand to their feet maybe someone was talking at the time and they were just saying well i don't know did we bring enough bread or what you know this is really neat look at all the oh so-and-so is here in that gray someone's here people start standing up and like man why is why is everybody standing up and then you look up you see the book's been opened and so you stand up too and as the as you continue to read this in this particular chapter ezra reads the books of the law and then the teachers teach from the book of the law and the word is made plain and it's made plain to them as they read genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy they were there for a long time as you read in the bible they were there listening to the word being read now think of it if you could somehow put yourself in their position they here they are exiled into strange lands these things they believed have been lost they're not worshiping in the temple anymore they're worshiping strange gods and then they're being restored back and they're building up the walls of jerusalem and then god supernaturally gathers them together and they say go get the books of the law of moses get what our prophet had written want to hear it and they start reading genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy these books start to be read out to the people and they start hearing the book of the law and as they're being reading these things he's actually telling them their church history and actually showing them the prophets that god had sent to him the prophet he sent and the judges that they had and the different things that are taking place and how god is dealing with their hearts and brings them out and they're learning everything god had established to bring them to the land of their promise so they could see now their church history they could see the word that they were given and how their fathers had fallen away from it and now they could understand why they were in bondage well we could never figure out why we're in babylon now we know god sent a prophet he gave us a word he had a word that we had abide by and the word actually says if you don't keep this i'll allow your enemies to come and drag you into bondage and now they can begin to see this is what the word says this is what happened and this is where we are it's as if they're hearing their church ages read out to them they're hearing their church history they know exactly where they are and one thing to notice here this book of nehemiah comes and malachi is a contemporary to nehemiah this has come at the very end of the old testament even though it may be in your bibles kind of front loaded this has happened at the very end and it's their failure after this that requires malachi to prophesy god will turn to the gentiles and the book of malachi is actually the strongest argument of the gospel turning to the gentiles of any book in the old testament because it's malachi chapter 1 that says my name is going to now be great among the gentiles and that becomes the prophet that turns everything back to the gen or to the gentiles and that's why the that very book ends with prophecy to a gentile people behold i send you elijah the prophet so these are the things that are taking place they can stand there and they hear and they understand oh this is why we are where we are this is what's happened to the ages this is what's happened through these years and the response to the people was to mourn as you read in the bible you said they weep and they lament there's a lamenting that takes place and they're sorry oh what have we done what have we done look at what's happened but god desired something otherwise you would think that that god would be like yeah you better you better repent you better weep you better you better beat yourself up and and and let me know you mean business i don't think you're serious until you start crying no god wasn't going to let him wallow in it he desired something different because he understood what it represented he knew he knew that this is this is how the person that when you come and begin to line up with the word of god it's the revival not a pity party you find some times that when they when they find out you you it and i think this happens with correcting our children that there's a point at which you correct them and then they can just wallow in the sorry it's like no no no no no we've corrected it we've addressed it let's go forward let's do it right and we could be the same way as christians that we we realize we're wrong and maybe we we enjoy the fact that we were able to finally repent look i realize it now i'm sorry forgive me lord i've done wrong and we enjoy that feeling so we kind of want to nurse that a little bit and feel sorry for ourselves and really lean into it yeah i'm really sorry yeah i'm really and there's a point in which god says yes you brought fruit meat of repentance you're sorry you're repentful but there's got to come a joy that follows there's a recovery from that there's a moving forward don't stay in that condition all the time don't stay in that place all the time listen if god wanted us to live at the altar he would tell us to live at the altar but what we do is we come to an altar to make things right to to have that time with god but then he wants us to take him from the altar back to where we live and so he says in verse verse 9 and nehemiah which is the tashatha and ezra the priest the scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto all the people because in verse eight they're lamenting they're crying they're willing oh it says this day is holy unto the lord your god mourn not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law so as the word was being restored back to them their instinct was right to weep they ought to have been sorrowful like if they would have said yeah we've had this figured out yeah that was easy yeah we knew that ah this is old news and god would not have been pleased but yet they had this contriteness but now the message is okay you've heard it you recognize you're not there but recognize your day that you're living in this is not a day of mourning this is not a day of weeping it says so don't don't don't mourn nor weep then he said unto them verse 10 go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared this isn't a time of woe is me and we're so sorry this is a time of feasting this is a time of celebrating this is a time to enjoy the many benefits of god and he says this he says for this day the lord this day is holy unto our lord he's sorry don't be sorrowful don't be crying don't be cast down for the joy of the lord is your strength his happiness his excitement his enthusiasm his love his passion his zeal is your strength as it said the lord thy god is in the midst of thee he is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy over thee with singing then it's the joy of the lord that is our strength as he rejoices over us with singing as he rests in his love as he rejoices over us with joy that becomes our strength it please god to see them call be brought together ask for the word of god to be expressed of their hearts every single one of them understand and begin to repent and that please god he says now now that you've repented now that you have eyes have now that you've been clothed now that you have gold come unto me and fellowship with me behold i stand at the door and knock don't always just be wallowing in the sins of laodicea but now there comes something where we enter into a different time of fellowship hallelujah he says the joy of the lord is your strength and then the levites they answer the same thing they don't have a different message they answer the same thing saying hold your peace for the day is holy neither be you grieved and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth we use that phrase all the time right what are you guys doing all we're just making great murph what is that vegan you're making great mirth great joy because they had understood the words that were declared unto them they rejoiced in understanding it even though even though it might have exposed a shortcoming even though it might have exposed the heirs of their fathers they they rejoice because now they knew it now they understood it now they could do it and if you continue to read this and i reference this very quickly in nehemiah chapter 8 verse 14 as it says and they found written in the law which the lord had commanded by moses that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month the sukkot the the feast of booths the feast of tabernacles they immediately restored the feast of tabernacles according to the law of moses because it happens at that very time it's taking place in that very time and when they read it and they recognize the moment they're living in and they realize and god had ordained this he allowed the walls of this temp this the temple to be restored and the people would supernaturally get men gathered they didn't necessarily even know because it's not until it was read that they understood do you recognize the day this is do you recognize the season that he told us that on the seventh day of the seventh month and these different things that this is the feast that we're supposed to have and it's in leviticus 23 40 and you shall rejoice before the lord your god seven days this is the feast of the tabernacles rejoice before the lord your god seven days another name for the feast was actually the season of our joy so notice how god says look don't be sorry because do you realize that the time and the season that you're living in according to my word is not the season of mourning and repenting it's the season of joy it's a season of celebration and joy is actually referenced several times many many times in reference to the feast of tabernacle or the feast of booths in deuteronomy chapter 16 verse 15. i'm reading this from a different translation i found three or four different translations that use the same language for seven days you are celebrate in the presence of the lord your god at the place where the lord will choose because the lord your god will bless you in all your harvest and in everything you do and your joy will be complete wow so powerful this is the season when they are wanting to lament and they're wanting to cry and they're wanting to be sorry and they're wanting to beat themselves up he says you've got to recognize your day and it's message this isn't a day of repenting this isn't a day of sorrow this is the feast of the tabernacles this is a time of celebration brother makes not very many statements about feasts of the tabernacles or feast of tabernacles he just references it a few times but one place he says that's where we're fellowshipping now and then he says that's what we'll be fellowshipping in the millennium this is where i could just add this caution that when it comes to the children of israel they work by a calendar and then we work from the types of that so we don't we don't try to get in this very rigid counter well the day of pentecost came and then this feast and then once you once you start doing that you'll start your head will start getting dizzy and you'll have to subscribe to some man's explanation on it in order to make sense of all of it and be able to place well if that was pentecost then so many days later is this and then the next year's that and then you try to make sense of all the dates and get the calendar line up we don't go by a calendar we go by the word okay so there's types that we draw from feast of the trumpets the tabernacles uh feast of pentecost there's a lot of types that we draw from it but for them it was by the calendar and so since they were in that september time they were in that time of that season and it fit with leviticus 23 and deuteronomy 16. they were they they did what was required of them at that time and it's this very same feast the feast of the tabernacles that came up in the dedication of the first temple it was at the very time of the feast of the tabernacles not because they said all the temples built let's have the feast it fit in the calendar so now as gentiles we don't go by a rigid calendar in that way we go by what god is revealing and doing in our lives at the time and we see the truth in our lives this is what we're doing this is a time of celebration this is the time of exaltation this is a time where god's going to be translating us into what new tabernacles new bodies and so we can see that type in it and this is how significant the feast of tabernacles were this time when they dedicated the first temple it comes at this time in nehemiah as they're rebuilding the walls of jerusalem but notice how he said that it's god will bless you in all your harvest they actually called it the harvest festival so notice the type then for the bride it's called the harvest festival they actually called it the feast of the inn gathering why because it was a time for gathering in for them it was a calendar that related to a natural harvest so it was the feast of the inn gathering where they brought in now we're living spiritually in a time of a gathering where god is gathering his bride together for what a rapture a harvest harvest time and in every day of the celebration in the feast of the tabernacles the priest would perform what was called the water libation ceremony and the priests would actually walk down travel down to the pool of shalom and they would actually get buckets of water and have to bring them all the way back to pour it out upon the altar now to them this spoke of it to them it spoke of the the just not only a cleansing of the altar but it was done in a way of prophecy because the word the language in isaiah and other places in the psalms it was the well of salvation you shall draw from the well of salvation and it was the wells of joy and happiness and one day that's going to come and they went through this exercise pouring out this water as a as a symbol of the messiah that was going to come i trust i'm not i'm not losing anybody at this point i know it's it's a little hot right but we woke up in maricopa right we're in the valley i don't know anybody came down from flag but the other day it was 100 degrees in flag that's hot if i was in flagstaff it was 100 degrees i would go to phoenix to cool off because that's hot in that in that elevation where i don't know it's hot in here right maybe a little bit muggy but we all realize we're in phoenix and i know that i'm going along i'm just right at about an hour already and i just want to finish this thought on pure joy i really really want to finish it and i'm just kind of hitting a highlight on this but it's real beautiful stuff if you just ponder it these are all little things you could branch out from but here as these priests would do this every day if these seven days during this time of feast of the tabernacles they took the water and poured upon the altar in the temple then in john chapter 7 at the beginning of the chapter it says now is the time for the feast of the tabernacles and the disciples and that was one of the three feasts that everyone was commanded to do in jerusalem you had to go you had to go to jerusalem remember the jews work by calendar and they work by geography the bride doesn't do that she goes by the word and she goes by the spirit so it's not geography and it's not calendar so this is there's this difference in what god does to the jews and what he does to the gentiles so in their season in john chapter 7 the disciples were going to go to jerusalem and jesus says well i'm not going to go but the bible says he went up in secret what a beautiful type for the time we're living in now when he comes up and he goes up in secret and it's then in the very notice verse 37 in the last day the great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink that the spiritual significance of this don't let's not miss it brother bam talks about it in broken cisterns and then one other place the spiritual significance of jesus standing up on the last great day of that feast in the feast of the tabernacles while every day these priests were going down getting a bucket of water from the pool of siloam and walk into the altar and pouring out this water and they're doing this as a symbol symbolism and that the messiah is going to come and then the messiah comes in secret and stands amongst them and says i am that living water i am that fountain of joy i'm the one that if you come and take of me out of your belly will flow living waters and you won't have to trudge down to that pool and come back to this physical altar one day there will be a birth in your heart that will not bind you by calendar not bind you by geography but out of your heart and out of your belly will flow living water and it's then at the feast of the tabernacles that christ speaks of himself and says i am alone the source of your joy i am the source of living water that's what happens in john 7 it's at that very time in nehemiah 8. it's at that very time when they solomon built the temple and dedicated it it was that very time in leviticus and deuteronomy that god established it and when you begin to recognize that continuity would it not be the same today when god is building again zion restoring his temple which is his body and brings us to that place of habitation where the headstone is uniting together again it's a season now where it's not don't weep anymore don't lament don't cry i am singing over you with joy i love you i'm rejoicing over thee with joy now is the time that i favor you now is the time to rejoice now is the time to sing not because one day it's coming but i the lord am in your midst fulfilling your word i am your source of living water i i it's not going to ask for permission i'm just going to try to go go with some expediency and speed uh very very quickly there's several scriptures that we could use this to emphasize this but joy is always connected with the revelation of jesus christ it's connected with his presence and in this first coming you see this theme in luke chapter one as it said that when elizabeth when mary came to elizabeth and and i don't know if i have these scriptures in there in luke but mary comes to elizabeth and he sees her says for lo verse 44 for his low as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded to my ears here's elizabeth being approached by mary and it says the babe which was elijah leaped john the baptist in the spirit of light of the babe leaped in my womb for joy upon thy salutation what was your salutation when mary began to declare how an angel came to her and gave her this message and that she would conceive of the holy ghost and she would have a child who would be the messiah and his name would be jesus that announcement that salutation caused the forerunner in the womb of elizabeth to leap for joy it was something that a mother could recognize would be different she felt that sensation that this child now was moved it was animated and it began to leap and be excited for joy and what the excellent the salutation of mary about the coming messiah why because he's associated with joy and then mary responds in verse 46 and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior why because that's what the messiah brings is he brings joy and in luke chapter 2 verse 10 when this the shepherds are just stunned at this awesome spectacle that they're witnessing and says the angel said to them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy we shall be out to all the people the revelation of jesus christ is associated with great joy the word we received is good tidings that's that's that's what we emphasize let me express this to you if you've taken the approach with your co-workers and your family and your friends who don't know this blessed truth to sit there and point out to them the judgment that's awaiting laodicea and the judgment upon their sin and how perverted the world is and how it's sodom and gomorrah that's wonderful but don't miss the revealing of christ which is love which is joy which is peace which is satisfaction which is the stimulation of joy which is the release from the bondage of depression which is the tearing down of thoughts of suicide which is the healing of the body of the mind we can make them realize all day long how dark the world is by using the message of the hour but don't forget to show them how bright the light is shining in the time that we're living in this message is one of good tidings of great joy that's what we share not judgment to laodicea judgment to sodom judgment to gomorrah judgment to the democrats judgment to the liberals judgment to this and judgment to that not life and peace to the sons and daughters of god brother abraham says in christ is a mystery god revealed they're singing take the name of jesus with you and you realize it's even as they're singing i said i don't know if you recognize the spiritual significance it begins to point these things out he stops and he says the threefold revelation hope and joy of heaven revealed in him the hope of earth and joy of heaven is he singing in that song he says the hope of earth and joy of heaven it's revealed in him everything is manifested in christ god the church everything else is manifested in christ the bible is christ the bible is the written word which he is the word it's manifestation to me this is the revival its manifestation is the evidence of the life coming into the flesh of the word to manifest it this is this is what revival is it's the word of god working in the life of god of an individual according to the spirit of god by the spirit of god the word of god working in your hearts the manifestation is the evidence of the life coming to the flesh of the word to manifest it the hope of earth and joy of heaven who is it jesus christ it's revealed in him and brother brown says excuse me in psalm 16 11. i don't amplify these things very much to you but just to throw these things out there for you to ponder this prophecy psalm 16 11 that will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy in the feast of the tabernacles it says god will bless you in your harvest and everything you do your joy will be complete this is the bride's revival today god's saying that i will bless you in your harvest and i will bless everything you'll do and your joy will be complete how can we have the fullness of joy and complete joy unless he hath shown us the path of life and his presence is with us in thy presence is the fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore that's where i want to be brother brandon says in the message shalom it's breaking day church think about this beautiful imagery it's darkness upon the people but it's good morning to the church it's darkness upon the age gloom sadness depression anxiety fear perversion upon the people but at the very same time the paradox is as there's a setting sun upon laodicea as it descends into darkness and chaos and is completely blacked out spiritually there's been a rising of the sun and so he doesn't say good night to the bride he says good morning he says shalom good morning to the church christ is peering is appearing among us shalom peace this is why sometimes when i get a phone call or see somebody it doesn't matter what time of the day it is i say good morning not because i'm mixed up to my time zones but to the bride it's good morning christ is appearing among us shalom peace he said it's good morning psalms 30 verse 5 for his anger and dearth but a moment in his favor is life thou shalt show me the path of life in his favor grace grace coming to the bride in his favor his life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning we weep because we still feel that we're in the night you're weeping even still yet now because you feel that you're in the night time of a situation a difficulty a problem that you're going through and as long as you're in the weeping because weeping takes place in the night but joy comes in the morning should we not be praying for the rising of the sun in our lives lord let me see your light shine let me see the sun come up lord even though it may seem dark in these other areas of my life that's just the darkness settling on the people that's darkness upon natural things but oh lord let me recognize that it is shalom it is good morning and if i know that it's good morning and i know that it is the rising of the sun then i know my joy has come i have a place of rest i have a place of sanctuary i have a place that i can hide and listen it's not a place where you just sit there going oh whoa it's me oh whoa it's me oh well good morning oh what was me good morning no it's then that you say yes there's darkness but hallelujah shalom peace joy thanksgiving rejoicing shouting blessing honor praise glory be unto his name why because joy comes in the morning the two link these quotations from the message shalom and then a man running from the presence of the lord it's 11 43. if some of you are regretting not having your watch today it's 11 43 you know exactly what time it is the temperature is warm and and we're uh i was getting kind of picked on this weekend by a deacon from another church you know we were eating dinner and i said well i think we're getting ready to leave was haha you know listen those preachers getting ready to close we got another two hours guys and i say well it's just like a deacon to pick on the preacher i said i guess this is the time for you guys to go off in the foyer and start talking right i mean if you want to tell preacher jokes we got deacon jokes but um i'm not saying i'm fixing to close i just have two two lengthy quotations to read you here they are those of you with really good eyesight brother martin you can see that you probably read it for us with that uh 520 vision it's just two lengthy quotations if you're feeling good at all about just having this left the entire sermon to this point has been this so if we've been an hour and 20 minutes i've gotta i don't know maybe i got about 40 minutes here 45 50 minutes in just one page all right enough let's read this this is from shalom and i do want to wrap this up before noon in the message shalom listen to this just i want to read it through i just felt compelled to read this whole thing just exactly like you showed us the seven church ages think of how they would have experienced this in nehemiah chapter eight what would come just exactly what he showed us what would come and when he set that light up there in the revelation to it to show the world when he sent the seven angels to reveal the seven messengers that had been down through here there and show the loose ends each angel coming each day and revealing the loose ends that luther left and wesley left and pentecost left is all represented in there you can see all the different symbolisms that have been expressed at that point and in the very type and shadow of the great shalom jehovah jvhu exactly throated in the skies and there is the mechanical eye taking a picture of it thank the lord now without getting into that i mean just what he described there to that point is a lot of stuff right but again let's make it very very very practical so he does for us shalom peace listen listen this is god's message to you he wants you to hear this don't be weary jesus is here his great light has come to us and we're thankful for it yes his word the great mystery here he is today manifesting himself doing the same as he did then just the same doing the very same we are creatures of time he's the god of eternity we try to press ourselves we try to make something different all this has got to be now that's that's a lot too and then he says remember he knows all about it it's going to happen anyhow let him do it just commit yourself to him all this has got to happen this has got to take place no he knows all about it whatever he said is going to be is going to be you just let him do it commit yourself to him look up and shine with joy of the lord to know that you've been privileged your eyes have come open and see this day trust him for the future let's do that from this moment on trust him for the future how can i trust him you've seen him vindicate his word in days past he that vindicated his word in days past and made all these other things happen just exactly to the hour that we're living everything exactly to the seventh angel's message both showed it in the heaven and on earth made it known their way in three ways so there can't be no slip up remember he promised he'd come again hallelujah that word will be vindicated god's promised word with two thousand years of waiting he will arrive on time don't be weary he'll be here as he have vindicated his word in every age the church ages show the same thing and revealing of our lord by the seventh message and so forth god revealed it manifested it and proved it and in among us today he showed himself here with us and proved and vindicated his word so will he what is the great stimulation of joy to the believer the stimulation that it's vindicated it's proved he says he shows himself here proved and vindicated that's the source of our joy i'm not gonna i'm not gonna listen to another one of satan's podcast called someday i'm i've unsubscribed i've blocked him i don't i don't follow his sermons i don't go to his website my time is now this is the time this is the season this is the moment when god reveals his word to his people is a time for joy they called it the season of our joy when god reveals his word to his people it's a time for joy and rejoicing not weeping or mourning and he says he's among us today what did zephaniah say i'm in the midst of thee be glad and rejoice with all the heart and the message man running from the presence of the lord by the mic if you'd come and begin to play as you feel led this is the my final uh the final statement to close this series on pure joy and he's praying it as a prayer i pray dear god for each one of these these dear people that i stood yandere in the mountains in arizona

presence today in this harvest time and this feast of the inn gathering in type there's a feast of the tabernacles taking place in type lord we're in this holy convocation type lord we have a solemn assembly lord so many different things that we could identify in type but we know the truth is that you are here according to your word gathering the bride for a rapture and lord we may ask ourselves what does it look like what should i be doing what does this mean for my life lord it's in your word i can look in my own life and identify that you've called me as a a man therefore i i have a labor to perform i have a work to do you giving me opportunities professionally or giving me an education when it comes to my flesh and i haven't i have a job to do as a man and in doing that job lord i i have a sense of fulfillment and then falling in love with the daughter of god i invite her to be a part of my life and part of my vision and then i i enter into that office of a husband and then i i have responsibilities to her as a husband then as an expression of our love we begin to have children and then my i enter into a new office and lord i'm a father and then when i begin to challenge myself well what should i do and what should i be doing this rapture this gavin together lord i realize that there's this season where you're making yourself known in your word and connecting with my heart in a very personal way not that i would have very lofty ideals and very lofty revelations but that i could live a very salty life that in knowing you i become a better man and knowing you i become a better husband and knowing you i become a better father and that it's in living that life as man lawyer husband father pastor walking in the calling and yielding my gift that i personally am getting closer to that change lord there may be young sisters here and young brothers who in this season of life begin to wonder what's it all about and if there's a rapture what does that mean for me and do i need to do this and do i need to do that lord we will not take that last step unless we're walking unless we're doing the things that we're called to do so i pray lord that you could wake us up from our slumber begin to lead us and guide us in our lives to be where you want us to be to do the things that you want us to do lord if it be in terms of education and profession and job and who we're gonna marry and where we're gonna go to church may these things begin to be quickened to us as we walk in your word that we can take a step further in your grace and in your goodness knowing that we're living in a different season at a different time that we've entered the rapturing age and just because we're in the rapture and age doesn't mean we've just laid all our utensils down and our service down and our calling down and our gifts down and we're just all kind of waiting for something climactic to happen lord the move is on for me may those who stand in your presence today say thus saith the lord the move is on for me and may we be up and doing may we take heart lord and go forward and to fight and just persevere and do the things that are necessary and may we lord love you with all of our hearts love you more than anything else pour into us the oil of gladness may we see the word made manifest in our life and father we trust you for the future and may your word fulfilled be our joy bless your people i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
