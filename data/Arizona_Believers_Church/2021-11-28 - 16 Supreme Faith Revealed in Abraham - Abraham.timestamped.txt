[0:00] genesis chapter 18
[0:02] verses 1 to 15 by god's grace and i've
[0:05] actually been so bold as to put the end
[0:07] on my title slide
[0:09] i think i may be finishing this subject
[0:12] but the way
[0:13] these things connect
[0:15] it's really just jesus christ part 1
[0:17] billion and 12 or whatever we're just
[0:19] really preaching christ every service
[0:22] but in this
[0:24] i just feel it just sealed up in my
[0:25] heart and something that had been
[0:28] kind of a target of mine we're going to
[0:30] get to today and i'm just very very
[0:32] excited to be able to minister this
[0:34] morning
[0:35] in genesis chapter 18. i'd like to read
[0:37] verses 1 to 15
[0:40] uh just to set this uh
[0:42] kind of the context for where we're
[0:44] going to end today and the lord appeared
[0:45] unto him in the plains of memory he's
[0:47] speaking about abraham
[0:49] and he sat in the tent door in the heat
[0:51] of the day
[0:52] and he lift up his eyes and looked and
[0:54] lo
[0:55] three men stood by him and when he saw
[0:57] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[0:59] door and bowed himself toward the ground
[1:01] so abraham in the tent door sees the
[1:04] lord coming and he sees that there's
[1:08] these two other men with the lord and he
[1:10] said my lord if now i have found favor
[1:12] in thy sight past not away i pray thee
[1:14] from thy servant let a little water i
[1:17] pray you be fetched and wash your feet
[1:18] and rest yourselves under the tree and i
[1:21] will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort
[1:24] you your hearts after that you shall
[1:26] pass on for therefore ye come to your
[1:28] servant and they said so do as thou has
[1:30] said
[1:31] and abraham hastened into the tent unto
[1:33] sarah and said make ready quickly three
[1:35] measures of fine meal knead it and make
[1:37] cakes upon the earth and abraham ran
[1:39] under the herd and fetched it fetched a
[1:42] calf tender and good and gave it unto a
[1:44] young man and he hasted to dress it and
[1:46] he took butter and milk and the calf
[1:48] which he had dressed and set it before
[1:49] them and he stood by them under the tree
[1:52] and they did eat and they said unto him
[1:54] where is sarah thy wife he said behold
[1:57] in the tent and he said i will certainly
[1:59] return unto thee according to the time
[2:01] of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have
[2:04] a son
[2:05] and sarah heard it in the tent door
[2:07] which was behind him
[2:08] now abraham and sarah were old and well
[2:11] stricken in age and it ceased to be with
[2:13] sarah after the manner of women
[2:15] therefore sarah laughed within herself
[2:17] saying after i am waxed old shall i have
[2:19] pleasure my lord being old also and the
[2:22] lord said unto abraham wherefore did
[2:24] sarah laugh saying shall i have a surety
[2:26] bear a child which i'm old
[2:29] is anything too hard for the lord and
[2:31] that the time appointed i will return
[2:33] unto thee according to the time of life
[2:35] and sarah shall have a son
[2:37] then sarah denied saying i laughed not
[2:40] for she was afraid and he said nay but
[2:42] thou didst laugh
[2:44] let's bow our heads in prayer
[2:45] heavenly father we thank you for your
[2:47] presence which we have felt this morning
[2:49] lord just the atmosphere of worship and
[2:51] the praise and thanksgiving that's been
[2:52] offered
[2:53] we ask that you would come now and take
[2:55] the words which we have read and just
[2:56] anoint them and bless them to our hearts
[2:59] as we desire to see jesus christ in the
[3:01] word lord may you make yourself known to
[3:03] us through it as we surrender ourselves
[3:05] to you pray in your blessings upon this
[3:07] part we commit it to you in jesus name
[3:09] amen
[3:10] you can be seated
[3:13] as i mentioned where
[3:16] the looking at the subject of supreme
[3:18] faith and hope hoping to come to the end
[3:21] of this series that has been in 16 parts
[3:24] and kind of was a continuation of the
[3:26] subject of blind trust and bad faith
[3:30] i would just
[3:31] really encourage you maybe to pay close
[3:33] attention as we have maybe a very simple
[3:35] thought very direct but it's going to
[3:37] get tied together um very strictly and
[3:41] just would probably need your attention
[3:42] as we do so
[3:44] we've been through these prior parts and
[3:46] i'm going to summarize uh last sunday
[3:50] um try to use some statements to
[3:52] summarize last sunday but through the
[3:53] first
[3:54] 15 or so parts 14 parts we were just
[3:57] looking at how abraham is an example of
[3:59] our faith and he has been determined and
[4:01] set we even see scripturally
[4:04] he's the father of us all he's a father
[4:05] of faith he's affording us this example
[4:08] that god was beginning something in
[4:10] abraham the beginning of christianity
[4:12] the beginning of
[4:13] judaism and a very important figure in
[4:15] scripture and so he's also determined to
[4:19] be and set in a particular way to be an
[4:21] example in the time that we're living
[4:23] today and so we view him and we
[4:26] recognize him as being holding even the
[4:28] example of rapturing faith
[4:30] and our desire in looking at the example
[4:33] of abraham was not to create a greater
[4:36] legend about abraham to where we kind of
[4:39] looked to him as an idol but rather we
[4:41] could look to him more as a role model
[4:43] and and him being a station being in a
[4:45] position that we ourselves can achieve
[4:47] so we wanted abraham's faith to become
[4:49] relatable we saw that in different
[4:51] aspects of whether we looked at genesis
[4:53] chapter 1 to 4 and how abraham's calling
[4:56] in his life connected back to what was
[4:58] happening in the first four chapters of
[5:00] genesis we saw even how genesis chapter
[5:02] 11 sets the context for god calling
[5:05] abraham now he was called out of babylon
[5:07] we saw it even in him being called away
[5:09] from lot there's a lot of different ways
[5:11] that we could relate to it
[5:12] and so that's what we were going through
[5:14] those many different parts at the
[5:16] beginning
[5:17] and last sunday we wanted to make this
[5:19] simple point that the story of abraham
[5:22] is meant to reveal the character of god
[5:24] not just the testimony of abraham that
[5:26] when we read about abraham's life we
[5:29] gather a lot about abraham and we learn
[5:30] a lot of details and we can piece
[5:33] together how old he was and how many
[5:35] children he had and the different wives
[5:36] he had after sarah was passed away and
[5:39] him being remarried and having children
[5:41] there's a way that we could begin to
[5:42] gather a lot of information about
[5:44] abraham and his sons and then his
[5:46] grandchildren and great-grandchildren
[5:48] but the story is meant to reveal god's
[5:51] character not just tell us something
[5:52] about abraham or just tell us something
[5:54] about the faith of abraham
[5:56] and so god uses the life of abraham to
[5:58] hide a mystery about himself
[6:00] that there's something about god that's
[6:02] being revealed in the story of abraham
[6:04] so we use we want to
[6:07] look at the life of abraham and allow it
[6:09] to reveal to us the attributes of god
[6:11] something about god's disposition
[6:14] something about his character
[6:16] and what really
[6:17] began to stand out to me as i looked at
[6:19] the life of abraham and just was reading
[6:21] through his life over and over again it
[6:23] really stood out to me how that god took
[6:26] abraham and he didn't just tell them hey
[6:28] this is what you're going to do or this
[6:30] is what you're supposed to do like
[6:31] here's a to-do list
[6:33] and i want you to get it done but god
[6:34] literally took abraham under his wing
[6:38] and mentored him and discipled him into
[6:40] supreme faith
[6:41] that abraham was not just told go out
[6:44] there have a son and then sacrifice him
[6:46] to me he was like all right here i am 75
[6:48] years old i guess i need my wife needs
[6:49] to have a boy and then he needs to be
[6:51] old enough for me to sacrifice him and
[6:52] he had to kind of walk through those
[6:54] paces with this this goal ahead of him
[6:56] that seems to be so insurmountable but
[6:59] god just mentored him to the supreme
[7:01] faith that he expressed on mount moriah
[7:04] when he offered up isaac upon the altar
[7:07] and so as god
[7:09] took abraham
[7:11] and put him through different trials and
[7:12] different testings and different
[7:14] circumstances we realize that abraham's
[7:16] learning something about himself he's
[7:18] learning something about the promise but
[7:20] more importantly he was learning about
[7:21] god
[7:23] and this is a god that was unknown he
[7:24] was shrouded in polytheism and the one
[7:27] true god was not being worshiped and so
[7:29] god want needed to put abraham in
[7:31] circumstances to where abraham would
[7:34] learn the nature and character of god
[7:36] that when he makes a promise he's going
[7:37] to fulfill it so when there's a famine
[7:40] that comes up in the land that i've
[7:41] promised you you don't need to abandon
[7:43] the land i promise to bless you in the
[7:45] land and even though it doesn't look
[7:47] like you're being blessed in the land
[7:49] persevere in the land that i called you
[7:51] in but abraham gets a little worried
[7:52] because of the famine goes down into
[7:54] egypt gets in trouble
[7:56] and and we'll look at this here in a
[7:57] moment about those particular instances
[8:00] but then god rescues them right out of
[8:01] that and he's learning god made me a
[8:03] promise he's not going to abandon me
[8:06] and i think we could all probably just
[8:07] for a moment be honest with ourselves
[8:10] we've made great professions of faith
[8:12] i'm the elect i'm his daughter i'm his
[8:14] son i'm going into rapture i'm filled
[8:15] with the holy ghost and then we have
[8:17] those very moments where we wonder what
[8:19] if god's abandoned us
[8:20] and maybe i've made a mistake too many
[8:22] times and maybe i should have done this
[8:24] and i should have done that and there's
[8:25] this feeling that we begin to have of oh
[8:27] no i'm in i'm in trouble maybe god's uh
[8:30] not going to bless me maybe god's
[8:31] abandoned me maybe i deserve to be
[8:34] kicked out and become an orphan again
[8:36] but all these circumstances that
[8:38] happened in abraham's life speak also to
[8:40] us we realize that what god was doing
[8:42] with abraham is revealing his character
[8:44] and he was teaching abraham to trust
[8:49] and god also is teaching us to trust
[8:52] and god is demonstrating his
[8:53] trustworthiness
[8:55] we can read it you know trust in me and
[8:57] we read it and we ought to believe it
[8:58] okay i can trust in him but there's
[9:00] something different about experiencing
[9:02] someone's trustworthiness you can trust
[9:04] me and i can say hey i promise you in
[9:06] the coming year my new year's resolution
[9:08] is to wash every single one of those
[9:10] cars and wax your car i'm going to do it
[9:12] and you can say hey he said he was going
[9:14] to do it i trust him but there's not
[9:15] there would be nothing like me actually
[9:17] doing what i said i would do and
[9:19] realizing you know when he says he's
[9:20] going to do something he's going to do
[9:21] it
[9:22] and so we might trust people implicitly
[9:25] in the beginning just trust them take
[9:26] them at face value but once they do
[9:28] something then you're actually building
[9:30] trust and this is what god was doing he
[9:32] was demonstrating this trustworthiness
[9:34] he was demonstrating faithfulness god
[9:35] was
[9:37] we talk about faithful abraham well he's
[9:39] called faithful abraham why because he
[9:42] submitted himself to a faithful god and
[9:44] he became what he was submitted to
[9:46] that abraham was called a friend of god
[9:49] so abraham's faithfulness was an
[9:50] expression of the kinship and the
[9:52] relationship and the intimacy he had
[9:54] with god he was faithful abraham because
[9:57] he had a faithful friend god
[9:59] and that's what we we begin to recognize
[10:01] for ourselves god is teaching us to
[10:03] trust and then whenever we find
[10:05] ourselves again in similar circumstances
[10:08] we don't all of a sudden say wait a
[10:10] minute wait a minute i thought you were
[10:12] teaching me to trust
[10:14] and and in that circumstances you taught
[10:15] me that i could trust you and now i'm
[10:17] right back in the same situation what is
[10:19] he wanting us to do demonstrate trust
[10:22] and so in abraham's life he was given
[10:23] opportunities to trust and then once he
[10:26] learned to trust then he could
[10:27] demonstrate trust and ultimately that's
[10:29] what he does on mount moriah is he
[10:30] demonstrated this absolute trust and
[10:32] confidence in god to the point to where
[10:34] the very nature of god is relied upon to
[10:37] be able to raise the dead
[10:39] and that's that supreme faith that's
[10:40] expressed in abraham and i feel that
[10:42] even in that it really summarizes the
[10:45] point that we've been wanting to express
[10:47] and so i want to take some moments i'm
[10:48] just going to some of these things i
[10:50] know will be a very strict review
[10:52] for us but this is just my way of trying
[10:54] to end
[10:55] this series on on supreme faith revealed
[10:58] in abraham
[10:59] and our goal i remember in the very
[11:01] beginning we expressed it this way our
[11:02] goal was to make the faith of abraham so
[11:04] practical
[11:06] that it can work in us to do to see the
[11:08] supernatural to experience the
[11:10] supernatural that we make abraham's
[11:12] faith not legendary and an idol but
[11:14] rather something so practical and
[11:16] attainable that it work we allow faith
[11:18] to work in us to the supernatural or to
[11:20] the supreme to perfect faith to achieve
[11:22] the things that god desires to achieve
[11:24] in our lives
[11:25] and in hebrews chapter 12 verse 2 it
[11:27] says this is instructed to us that we
[11:29] ought to
[11:30] be looking unto jesus the author and
[11:34] finisher of our faith
[11:36] now we recognize scripture that abraham
[11:38] is the father of our faith he's the
[11:40] father of us all he's the father of our
[11:42] faith but christ is the author and the
[11:45] finisher of him one the the dis the
[11:47] expression that abraham is the father of
[11:49] our faith holds a certain image and a
[11:51] certain relationship to us but christ is
[11:54] the author and the finisher of our faith
[11:57] christ himself is the author or the the
[11:59] originator of our faith and if faith has
[12:02] begun in you the same one who has
[12:04] started the work is just and faithful to
[12:06] finish the work he is the author and
[12:08] finisher or the perfecter of our faith
[12:11] so it's important for us to realize that
[12:13] if we know that we have genuine faith
[12:15] then that has this origin this genesis
[12:18] of of coming forth and being raised up
[12:21] within our lives but faith is to lead us
[12:23] to a destiny it has a beginning and it's
[12:25] going to have a destiny it's going to
[12:27] have something that it achieves and
[12:29] brings us to
[12:30] and as abraham believed god he is the
[12:33] father of our faith abraham believed god
[12:35] so therefore he gives us this example as
[12:38] dear children we follow after his
[12:40] example in that he believed god and then
[12:43] following his example we believe in
[12:45] christ
[12:47] that we're not believing in abraham but
[12:49] we believe in christ and as abraham
[12:51] believed in the promise and then he
[12:53] believed in the power that promised and
[12:55] achieved the potential of it then we
[12:57] likewise believe in christ the promise
[12:59] of christ the power of christ in order
[13:01] to receive and fully participate in all
[13:04] the potential of christ that's the
[13:06] example that abraham has given us he
[13:08] believed in god and in the same way we
[13:10] believe and trust in god we believe in
[13:12] christ
[13:14] now a statement that has been
[13:16] um just the real driving force behind
[13:19] this and i've read it several times but
[13:20] it's been many services since we've read
[13:22] it i wanted to read it again
[13:24] just to read to to bring this in at the
[13:26] very end here
[13:28] he says one thing that we brother
[13:29] branham making this statement in the
[13:31] sermon balm and gilead the one thing
[13:32] that we have to move up to now is a
[13:35] supreme faith to what we've had so we
[13:37] have faith but then faith is a supreme
[13:40] can come to supremacy to its full
[13:42] expression it's perfect expression he
[13:44] says we we need to move up to a supreme
[13:46] faith to what we have had
[13:48] he says you cannot have that faith until
[13:50] you know perfectly what you are doing
[13:54] you cannot have that faith until you
[13:56] perfectly know what you're doing now
[13:57] that seems to be
[13:59] a
[14:00] um uh we could say
[14:03] uh to know perfectly that almost could
[14:05] make it seem a little bit unreachable
[14:07] but i love the steps that we do we can
[14:09] take to get there and he says that he
[14:11] uses this as the example you just say
[14:13] well i'm going home i'm gonna go out and
[14:14] start the car so if we said i'm going to
[14:16] go start the car i'm going to drive home
[14:18] he says that's all an act of faith
[14:21] for us to say i'm leaving this room and
[14:23] i'm going to go get in my car i'm going
[14:24] to start my car and drive home this is
[14:26] on some level an act of faith tomorrow i
[14:29] meet you at a certain place and when it
[14:30] happens we'd say he says that's all
[14:33] an act of faith because you've just done
[14:36] it so much because it's a regular
[14:38] routine with you you realize tomorrow
[14:40] morning at 7 30 when you get your coffee
[14:42] at just exactly the same time or whether
[14:44] you drive to do it or your coffee maker
[14:46] does it and you you're on that same
[14:47] routine every morning that's an act of
[14:49] faith
[14:51] and you expect it i'm going to have
[14:52] coffee at 7 30 in the morning you know
[14:53] there's some people that you know you
[14:54] could meet them at certain places and
[14:56] right on the dot i know they're going to
[14:58] be there right at this exact moment some
[15:00] of us who uh commute to work if we're
[15:02] not all still working remotely and you
[15:04] drive to work and you always leave the
[15:05] house at the same time you'll find
[15:07] yourself at stoplights and you can
[15:08] always see somebody else who's right
[15:10] there with you
[15:11] going the same way and you don't even
[15:12] know where they live and where they come
[15:14] from or where their work but you go
[15:15] there's the white tesla again and you
[15:17] just know this is the routine we're all
[15:19] in the routine it's in this routine that
[15:22] brother venom is identifying that on
[15:24] some level these are all acts of faith
[15:27] he says you've just done it so much it's
[15:28] a regular routine with you and he says
[15:30] well that's the way the things of god
[15:32] are
[15:33] this is important to i think to
[15:34] recognize that things that become
[15:37] routine and take preeminence in our
[15:38] lives naturally there's a way that the
[15:41] things of god can begin to take
[15:42] preeminence and become routine in our
[15:43] lives spiritually he says after you've
[15:45] trusted him watched him do so many
[15:47] things until it becomes just like a
[15:49] regular routine
[15:51] so this is something that i'm wanting to
[15:52] emphasize in this last service you trust
[15:55] him you watch him do things over and
[15:56] over again and since you trust him and
[15:58] he and he demonstrates his
[16:00] trustworthiness then it just becomes a
[16:02] regular routine
[16:03] and then he puts it in this pinnacle
[16:05] this climax and that's the condition i
[16:07] think the church will be in just before
[16:09] the coming of the lord so the rapture
[16:11] will just go right on that way
[16:13] the rapture is going to take place and
[16:15] go on and come to its completion it's
[16:17] summation in the same way that you every
[16:20] day through daily acts of faith achieve
[16:22] the things that you're supposed to do
[16:24] that the chur the rapture is going to go
[16:26] on that way it'll just be a regular
[16:28] routine of following the scriptures and
[16:30] the plans of god
[16:32] we can make the rapture the change of
[16:34] our body this resurrection and rapture
[16:36] that's to transpire and we can make it
[16:38] this just a specific particular moment
[16:41] on the calendar that wow we're just kind
[16:43] of holding on and abiding our time until
[16:46] this great climactic moment when we're
[16:48] all going to be caught up to meet the
[16:49] lord in the air but we have to recognize
[16:52] that if we want to participate in that
[16:55] then we need to be in the regular
[16:56] routine of following the scriptures and
[16:58] the plans of god
[16:59] so we're not necessarily planning every
[17:02] moment of every day to somehow figure
[17:05] out a way to change our body to make it
[17:06] like this huge climactic event every day
[17:09] where something supreme something of
[17:11] mount moriah experience every day but
[17:14] just having daily acts of faith towards
[17:16] building us to the place to where we can
[17:18] trust god follow the scriptures and the
[17:20] plans of god
[17:22] and i believe the example of abraham
[17:24] shows us how supreme faith
[17:27] comes by daily acts of faith towards
[17:30] just a routine
[17:32] and i think even that phrase acts of
[17:34] faith
[17:36] it uh pondered it yesterday this the
[17:38] acts of faith it can seem to have to be
[17:40] very high
[17:42] you know acts of faith it seems to be
[17:44] out of reach and because we've
[17:46] designated certain events to be acts of
[17:50] faith that if i could somehow have an
[17:52] opportunity to pray for someone who is
[17:54] sick and then pray for them and then
[17:56] immediately they get well we think
[17:58] that's the that's an act of faith you
[18:00] know lay hands on somebody if if there
[18:01] was somebody who was dead and and we
[18:03] were able to pray for him and they were
[18:05] to raise the life that's an act of faith
[18:07] and we we have certain things that we
[18:09] would place in the level of acts of
[18:11] faith and really the truth of the matter
[18:13] is some of us narrow acts of faith to
[18:15] such a strict definition that we would
[18:17] never have the chance unless a preacher
[18:19] said hey it's saturday night why don't
[18:20] you come up and join us in the prayer
[18:22] line so you can benefit and participate
[18:24] in the acts of faith because that's
[18:26] almost where we put all of them
[18:28] is in in atmospheres like that and
[18:30] circumstances like that
[18:32] and and i as i was pondering i thought
[18:35] that it's and i'm not saying that this
[18:37] is so but i want to share this just to
[18:39] broaden our understanding of what an act
[18:41] of faith is we think about the book's
[18:43] book of acts
[18:44] and we say well when the god when that
[18:46] tree puts forth another branch he's
[18:48] going to write in other books of acts
[18:49] behind it
[18:50] but remember the book of acts are not
[18:52] the acts of the apostles or the acts of
[18:54] the disciples but it's the acts of the
[18:56] holy spirit
[18:57] and so it was the it was god
[18:59] demonstrating power through yielded
[19:01] vessels and god taking chosen vessels
[19:04] and working himself through them so it
[19:06] was the acts of the holy spirit and it
[19:08] was the disciples then it wasn't their
[19:11] acts but the the acts of the disciples
[19:14] was very simply to believe the word
[19:17] to believe it and to not narrow it i
[19:19] mean if they would have said well we
[19:20] believe in christ but we don't believe
[19:21] in divine healing we believe in christ
[19:23] and we don't believe in miracles we
[19:24] believe in the gift of the holy ghost
[19:26] well we believe that all you must do is
[19:27] be circumcised and recognize the laws
[19:29] and just accept christ so it's kind of
[19:31] judaism plus jesus uh they they had to
[19:34] believe the word and all the word and
[19:35] because they believed the word and they
[19:37] yield it to the word then the holy
[19:38] spirit could act through a vessel that
[19:41] believed
[19:42] so it takes it out of this realm that
[19:44] daily acts of faith for us are not i
[19:47] must be doing the acts of the holy
[19:49] spirit but i have to do the act of
[19:52] faith
[19:53] i have to believe that's my action
[19:55] that's what i'm doing is i'm believing
[19:57] and in believing that i put myself in a
[19:59] position for the holy spirit to act on
[20:01] my behalf or through me
[20:04] and so the daily acts of faith are is
[20:07] just that believing the act of faith i'm
[20:09] believing today
[20:12] in john chapter 6 verses 28 to 29 it
[20:14] says then jesus said unto him
[20:17] then then said they unto him this is
[20:19] their question what shall we do that we
[20:21] might work the works of god what can we
[20:24] do to have acts of faith
[20:26] what can we do to demonstrate the power
[20:29] of the holy ghost jesus answered and
[20:31] said to them this is the work of god
[20:34] that you believe on him whom he hath
[20:35] sent
[20:37] how can i do the works of god i love how
[20:39] it's narrowed from works and so oh let's
[20:41] just think about all the things we can
[20:43] do all the works that we could
[20:45] set forth and the things we could do
[20:46] with our hands and the things that we
[20:48] could demonstrate the things that we
[20:49] could display and jesus just distills it
[20:51] all down to one he says this is the work
[20:53] you want to do mighty works well then
[20:55] you just have to do one that's to
[20:56] believe on christ
[20:58] like that's the work that's what we do
[21:00] and if we if our faith has limits if our
[21:02] faith is qualified if our faith is not
[21:05] um fully uh uh fully open to believe all
[21:08] things then that's the that's the
[21:09] limitation on the acts
[21:12] that's why sometimes people just want to
[21:13] know whether or not you believe uh do
[21:16] you believe that god is a healer do you
[21:18] believe in divine healing do you believe
[21:20] that the bible says you shall lay hands
[21:22] on the sick and they shall recover
[21:24] i was in a circumstance i'm just using
[21:26] this one time as an example that then
[21:28] there's when the circumstance demands it
[21:30] and you're a believer then you can
[21:31] demonstrate an act of faith and all if
[21:33] you're going to pray for somebody you
[21:35] don't need to sit down and say now um
[21:36] which bible do you use i believe in the
[21:38] king james version oh you believe the
[21:39] american standard version well you know
[21:41] good luck take an aspirin get some rest
[21:44] and you just kind of back out because
[21:45] they don't read the same bibles you do
[21:47] you just could say do you believe in god
[21:49] yes i believe in god do you believe that
[21:50] jesus christ is a healer do you believe
[21:53] in the bible these certain principles
[21:55] and they
[21:55] and they're in that moment they give a
[21:57] cent to the word of god and faith then
[21:59] you're creating an atmosphere to to pray
[22:02] for them because they're believing the
[22:03] word
[22:04] and i was in a circumstance one time
[22:06] there's hundreds of prospective lawyers
[22:08] taking the bar exam in dallas 100 it may
[22:10] have been a thousand and we're all
[22:12] gathered in this lobby of this building
[22:14] uh to go up and and take this over three
[22:16] days you took the bar exam
[22:18] i don't mean to lose anybody right now
[22:20] if you're finding out i passed the bar
[22:22] isn't that a good testimony if a
[22:23] preacher passes the bar you're like good
[22:24] good work uh but this was a different
[22:27] bar and i did pass on my first try
[22:30] and so i am a licensed lawyer so i don't
[22:32] know if we need to sing take the name of
[22:33] jesus with you
[22:35] but um in that we're there in the
[22:37] basement and somebody that i had been i
[22:39] think they'd graduated number one in
[22:40] their class at ut law and they had been
[22:43] in my pre-my bar prep course and i knew
[22:45] them and i kind of got to know know her
[22:48] husband a little bit and
[22:50] in the on my way walking up she's having
[22:51] a complete meltdown in the parking lot
[22:53] her husband's there going it's going to
[22:54] be okay and she's completely lost it and
[22:56] as we walk into the lobby i asked her
[22:58] husband i said what's going on she's had
[23:00] an adverse reaction to medicine she was
[23:02] disabled and she was given special
[23:04] accommodations to take the exam
[23:07] she had a disability
[23:08] and then
[23:09] she was completely this is a brilliant
[23:11] student
[23:12] number one in her class at ut law i
[23:14] believe and here's the second day of the
[23:16] bar exam third day of the bar exam and
[23:17] she's she has lost herself and hundreds
[23:20] of people begin to gather and there's
[23:22] it's a big commotion and i had a prayer
[23:24] cloth that i had in my pocket
[23:27] um and that my dad had given me and i'd
[23:29] taken it and i was gonna wear it each
[23:30] day that took the bar exam
[23:32] and i just went up to her and i said do
[23:34] you ask do you mind if i pray for he
[23:36] goes no please and in the presence of
[23:38] everybody i took the prayer cloth out i
[23:40] said in the bible they took garments of
[23:42] paul and they prayed over them
[23:44] and then they and they put them on
[23:46] people who were sick and had evil
[23:47] spirits and they were delivered i said
[23:48] do you believe that she says yes i
[23:50] believe i said do you mind if i take
[23:52] this prayer cloth it's been prayed over
[23:54] it was uh that was worn by a prayed over
[23:56] by a man of god and i gave it to her and
[23:58] i said i want to lay this on you i want
[23:59] to pray for you and believing in the
[24:01] word of god that you're going to be
[24:02] healed and everything's going to be okay
[24:04] and we prayed for her and i put in my
[24:05] pocket and i went up to take the exam
[24:08] and right before the exam started she
[24:10] had uh she come over and she
[24:12] she said i'm feeling fine everything's
[24:14] left i feel like i'm doing great i'm
[24:16] doing fine and at lunch break i was
[24:18] sitting off to the side and she ran up
[24:20] to a table of friends she said i don't
[24:21] even know what happened but all of a
[24:23] sudden it just left me like that she
[24:25] said she was completely fine and because
[24:27] all i had to do is point her to the word
[24:30] just to believe in the word that's the
[24:31] work of god that we all have to do is
[24:34] believe god believe in his word believe
[24:36] in christ i don't necessarily like to
[24:38] share a lot of my personal testimonies
[24:40] and you could just take that as
[24:41] anecdotal from brother aaron but it's an
[24:43] example of in the moment just you point
[24:46] to the word get them to believe in the
[24:47] word of god
[24:49] and this is what jesus is doing this is
[24:50] the work of god that you believe on him
[24:52] whom he hath sent
[24:54] so we find in the book of acts the acts
[24:56] of the of the apostles was to believe
[24:58] the word and then the acts of the holy
[25:00] spirit begin to demonstrate itself in
[25:03] acts chapter 12 verse 24 it says but the
[25:05] word of god grew and multiplied this is
[25:08] what you find to be
[25:10] the the real indication of the book of
[25:12] acts is the word of god grew it became
[25:14] greater and it multiplied it increased
[25:17] the word of god is increasing getting
[25:18] greater that gives greater opportunities
[25:20] to faith because faith cometh by hearing
[25:23] hearing by the word of god so as the
[25:24] word increased and grew faith becomes
[25:27] more robust it says it again in acts
[25:29] chapter 19 verse 20 so mightily grew the
[25:31] word of god and as the word of god
[25:33] mightily grew which means to increase in
[25:35] strength it says and it prevailed it
[25:37] gave power to overcome
[25:40] so this is the work of god to believe
[25:42] the word the example of abraham shows us
[25:45] how that supreme faith comes by daily
[25:47] acts of faith then i must daily then
[25:49] what i do daily is i daily believe the
[25:51] promise
[25:53] that's what i do i daily believe the
[25:54] word of god so that the word of god can
[25:56] grow and multiply increase in order for
[25:59] there to be power to overcome
[26:01] and that was abraham's challenge
[26:04] his challenge was to believe god every
[26:06] day
[26:07] not necessarily to see any difference in
[26:09] his his physicality not to see any
[26:11] difference in in sarah and not
[26:13] necessarily to see that he could build a
[26:15] fence around all of canaan that was
[26:16] promised to him and chase out all the
[26:18] canaanites and become the ruler of this
[26:20] great nation and to see thousands of
[26:23] progeny in his lifetime that wasn't his
[26:25] challenge to see that his challenge was
[26:27] to every day just believe god
[26:30] to trust him daily
[26:32] and
[26:32] could we all agree that's our challenge
[26:35] just to everyday trust him did you find
[26:37] yourself kind of hitting your stride and
[26:38] you're kind of believing
[26:40] you know hey everything's gonna be fine
[26:42] everything's gonna be great god's gonna
[26:43] take care of me ever all that's going
[26:45] well and all of a sudden a new variant
[26:46] comes out
[26:48] i don't i've only read it so i don't
[26:49] know how you say it omicron or something
[26:51] there might be a more fancy way to say
[26:53] it
[26:54] but um and all of a sudden a new one
[26:55] comes out and you're like
[26:57] oh no
[26:59] it's another opportunity to trust god
[27:01] right another opportunity just to take
[27:02] god in his word and just believe and
[27:04] trust in him and that's what our
[27:06] challenge is regardless of what happens
[27:08] oh it looks like they're going to lay
[27:08] people off or looks like this is going
[27:10] to happen it looks like that's going to
[27:11] happen that we have to daily learn to
[27:14] trust god
[27:15] second corinthians chapter 4 verse 16
[27:17] for which cause we faint not but though
[27:19] our outward man perish yet inward the
[27:22] inward man is renewed day by day
[27:25] just taking that phrase to ponder that
[27:27] phrase the inward man is renewed day by
[27:29] day it means to cause to grow up to make
[27:31] new
[27:32] to make fresh i love to make unworn
[27:35] anybody feel weary sometimes
[27:38] come on i could testify for a while
[27:40] i i just there's just a weariness that
[27:43] that takes place and you just get weary
[27:44] and wearing like i just need a break why
[27:46] because we feel worn and maybe the the
[27:49] outward man whether it be your physical
[27:50] body
[27:52] and even your mind can be weary there is
[27:54] a renewing of the inward man
[27:57] it's to be fresh to be unworn that's a
[28:00] promise to us this is something that we
[28:02] could recognize no matter how much pain
[28:04] i have in my joints no matter how much
[28:06] my mind plagues me there can be a
[28:08] renewing and a refreshing
[28:10] of the inner man
[28:12] this is a daily it says the inward man
[28:14] is renewed day by day i wouldn't take it
[28:17] to say oh well since it's not being
[28:18] renewed i must not be a christian if
[28:20] it's not being renewed you're not
[28:22] participating in all the benefits of
[28:24] being a christian
[28:25] because the inward man can be and is
[28:28] renewed day by day
[28:32] listen you you're not going to get the
[28:34] inward man's not going to get a a
[28:36] spiritual or soul arthritis
[28:39] you don't you don't need you don't need
[28:40] a fair gun
[28:42] for your soul so to speak
[28:44] it is renewed day by day it's it's it's
[28:47] there for you to take benefits from
[28:50] jesus says in luke chapter 9 verse 23 if
[28:53] any man will come after me let him deny
[28:55] himself and take up his cross
[28:58] daily
[28:59] and follow me
[29:01] i realize that there is a there's a
[29:03] danger in kind of watering down what the
[29:05] meaning of the cross is and and to make
[29:06] it into something that's oh it's just
[29:08] your tax burden or it's just this or
[29:10] it's just that it's putting up with the
[29:12] in-laws on holidays
[29:14] and to make the cross seem really really
[29:16] innocent and neat and clean and pretty
[29:18] because it does speak of a death it was
[29:20] a very gruesome death to speak of the
[29:22] cross as a crucifixion and so if jesus
[29:25] said take up your cross everybody they
[29:26] would be going
[29:28] this this is in the this is speaks of a
[29:30] crucifixion and and the tradition of one
[29:32] burying their own cross to be hung on as
[29:34] a as a murderer as a criminal or as one
[29:37] that was a revival this would be
[29:39] something that would be a tremendous
[29:40] reproaching and so i believe that we
[29:42] ought to take it in that context but
[29:44] then to also we don't want to
[29:47] put in such a way to where we're not
[29:48] daily having opportunities to take up
[29:50] the burden
[29:51] now well i'm not being asked to die
[29:53] today and i'm not being you know
[29:54] threatened to be killed tomorrow so i
[29:56] must i don't have a cross to bear but
[29:57] daily there's a burden there's a cross
[30:00] there's a responsibility that we pick up
[30:02] and we daily don't miss this part daily
[30:05] follow him
[30:06] such an important aspect of just
[30:08] beginning to realize this has to be a
[30:09] daily walk a daily communion a daily uh
[30:12] yielding a daily opportunity to be
[30:13] renewed and refreshed day by day to
[30:15] become unworn to take up my cross this
[30:18] burden this belief in jesus christ the
[30:20] reproach of it and to follow him
[30:23] something that i've been reminded of
[30:24] through fellowship recently and then a
[30:26] sermon uh that had been
[30:29] shared with me brother tim daughter
[30:30] preached
[30:31] on what is that to you follow me follow
[30:34] thou me
[30:36] it doesn't matter whatever what you know
[30:37] what is it to you that this person does
[30:39] this and this person says this has
[30:40] happened and this person says they're
[30:41] going to do this what is it to you what
[30:43] everyone else is doing you must
[30:45] personally be following christ
[30:49] daily take up your cross daily
[30:52] in the message is your life worthy i
[30:54] believe it's in another place it's
[30:55] called is your life worthy of the gospel
[30:57] i think there's a couple instances maybe
[30:59] where it's preached or just it could be
[31:00] i could have abbreviated it here is your
[31:02] life worthy of the gospel i think
[31:04] there's a few titles on it and brother
[31:06] branham says it this way we have to
[31:08] follow every day every hour of the day
[31:10] every step of the way
[31:14] we've got to be led by the lord jesus
[31:16] christ this is the standard now
[31:19] every day every hour of the day every
[31:20] step of the way
[31:22] we've got to be led by the lord jesus
[31:23] christ if we don't we take an on take an
[31:26] organizational life
[31:28] quite a mouthful organizational life
[31:31] doesn't necessarily have to have an org
[31:32] behind it or an ink or have to be
[31:34] associated with an official organization
[31:36] but you can just become so organized
[31:39] in your own self to where it's just more
[31:42] discipline
[31:43] and carnal
[31:44] effort and it's more organizational life
[31:46] as opposed to true genuine leadership of
[31:49] the holy spirit in your life and he says
[31:51] and the life that doesn't follow christ
[31:53] daily is not worthy
[31:56] now i am not i'm not setting this forth
[31:58] at all i believe we have we all have an
[32:00] opportunity to uh to read this these
[32:02] sermons and to listen to this and the
[32:04] thought that he's sharing and so what
[32:06] i'm expressing to you in this is not
[32:08] does not change the meaning at all in
[32:10] this but yet i'm kind of approaching
[32:13] the mindset that immediately we begin to
[32:14] say something that somebody is worthy
[32:16] is your life worthy of the gospel it
[32:18] says a life that doesn't follow christ
[32:20] daily is not worthy now there's a way
[32:22] that we immediately begin to think of
[32:25] of i'm not worthy
[32:27] but worthy means having or showing the
[32:28] qualities or abilities that merit
[32:30] recognition in a specific way so it's
[32:33] having or showing qualities or having or
[32:35] showing abilities that merit or
[32:37] recognition a specific certain kind of
[32:39] uh um
[32:40] recognition and so when we read this it
[32:43] says a life that doesn't follow christ
[32:45] daily is not worthy we ask ourselves is
[32:46] my life worthy of the gospel it's not
[32:49] that we would be worth the gospel
[32:52] or am i deserving of am i worthy to
[32:55] receive it am i worthy of it am i uh
[32:58] have i been deemed privileged enough uh
[33:00] to be a beneficiary of it and am i good
[33:03] enough that i could receive it and be
[33:05] blessed by it that's not the question is
[33:07] your life worthy of the gospel if that
[33:09] was the question none of us would have
[33:11] it
[33:12] right
[33:13] if here's the gospel ready to be
[33:15] received and then well is your life
[33:18] worthy
[33:18] is your life worthy and just every
[33:20] sunday we got together and i had the
[33:22] gospel in a bowl the gospel here and
[33:24] you're going to get some gospel
[33:27] and i had you had to demonstrate
[33:28] worthiness to get it then we would never
[33:31] it would still if we started with a 10
[33:32] it would be out of 10.
[33:34] the church has been here 100 years and
[33:36] no one's ever gotten a dip out of this
[33:38] because we would never be worthy in that
[33:41] sense of the gospel
[33:42] but this is what i want you to ponder in
[33:44] terms of the question is your life
[33:45] worthy and it says a life that's not
[33:47] daily following christ is not worthy
[33:49] it's not are you deserving of it but
[33:52] rather think about it this way is our
[33:55] life getting the value or the worth of
[33:57] the gospel
[33:59] that's the question that's being asked
[34:00] of us if these things aren't in your
[34:03] life are you really getting the benefit
[34:06] and the value of the gospel is your life
[34:08] indicating
[34:10] that you're receiving the benefits of
[34:12] the gospel
[34:14] in no way is it to turn it around to
[34:15] where now it's it's works and you've got
[34:17] to deserve the holy ghost and you've got
[34:18] to make yourself good enough to be
[34:19] sealed by god but it's a question of if
[34:21] a life that doesn't daily follow christ
[34:24] is not
[34:25] recognizing the value and the worth of
[34:28] the gospel
[34:30] and what's made available to us
[34:32] and i see this example in the life of
[34:34] abraham in a very simple way and again i
[34:37] want to i want to kind of qualify once
[34:39] again that the life of abraham and i'll
[34:42] mention it here in a moment lord willing
[34:43] the life of abraham details very
[34:45] significant peaks in his life very
[34:48] significant events that take place in
[34:50] his life and so we see these very
[34:53] dramatic images of abraham trusting god
[34:55] and these supernatural miracles that
[34:56] take place
[34:58] but that's not all that's transpiring in
[35:00] his life
[35:01] but abraham in his life there's daily
[35:04] acts of faith daily contacts with god
[35:07] that are the same ones that we can have
[35:09] it's not that we're all waiting for the
[35:11] day that we're just sitting there
[35:13] in our front door in our subdivision
[35:15] kind of looking around drinking our our
[35:17] mud water and all of a sudden we see
[35:19] three men walking down the street saying
[35:21] jesus is coming hey honey
[35:23] make some bread
[35:26] you know son go fetch a lamb and that
[35:28] that's the experience we're gonna have
[35:29] that's that's a that's a special
[35:31] instance in abraham's life but brother
[35:33] bannon makes the statement in going
[35:35] beyond the camp in the case of abraham
[35:37] in his camp it was almost an everyday
[35:40] occasion that abraham met god he talked
[35:43] to him
[35:44] now you could take this back into that
[35:46] whole that mindset of acts of faith
[35:48] they're laying hands on the sick and
[35:50] they're recovering that's an act of
[35:51] faith but you take it toward daily acts
[35:53] of faith have to be on that level and
[35:56] then you think that every day abraham
[35:57] got a vision from god every day
[35:59] melchizedek visited him every day god
[36:01] bailed and fleshed that sat down and ate
[36:03] a lamb sandwich with him but that's not
[36:05] what he was saying every day abraham met
[36:07] god and talked with him
[36:10] now you have that opportunity every day
[36:13] the greatest privilege a mortal man has
[36:15] ever had is to bow his head in his heart
[36:16] and speak face to face to god and you do
[36:18] that when you pray
[36:20] child of mine when you look into this
[36:22] word you're looking at me face to face
[36:24] do you realize that we have been what's
[36:26] been made available to it
[36:28] to us is the same experience that
[36:30] abraham had almost an everyday occasion
[36:33] where he met god and he talked to him
[36:35] in the message without money and without
[36:37] price brother ben i'm talking about the
[36:39] exodus and how that god gave them uh
[36:41] manna from heaven and quail said god fed
[36:43] them every night with bread made by
[36:45] angels hands without money without price
[36:48] and today that bread represents christ
[36:50] spiritual life come down from heaven to
[36:52] give his life
[36:54] and says and god gives his children
[36:56] every day a new experience
[37:00] this is not done to be a litmus test of
[37:03] whether or not you're worth a daily
[37:05] experience with god and are you worthy
[37:07] of every day do you have a new
[37:08] experience every day well if you don't
[37:10] then you're not a child of god no it's
[37:12] to remind us that as children of god he
[37:16] gives us a new experience every day and
[37:19] if we don't have one it's just merely
[37:21] because you haven't exercised your right
[37:23] to get it
[37:26] i know i've been a rito's evangelist for
[37:28] some time i don't know if i've ever
[37:29] evangelized matt's big breakfast highly
[37:31] recommend it
[37:33] i went to their grand opening of their
[37:35] store off of in um in glendale we know
[37:38] the owners we got to know them years ago
[37:40] when we lived here before don't read
[37:41] into that at all we just ate there a lot
[37:44] and
[37:45] uh and so we were one of the first 50
[37:46] people at the grand opening so all six
[37:49] members of my family got a card for free
[37:52] bacon
[37:53] for six months
[37:55] every visit
[37:57] and that means every single day every
[38:00] single member of my family can go into
[38:02] matt's big breakfast and wave the card
[38:04] and get a plate of really really good
[38:06] peppered bacon thick cut cooked
[38:08] perfectly
[38:10] and we could do that every day if we
[38:11] wanted
[38:13] and i don't even think we do it every
[38:14] week
[38:15] but i could if i wanted to right
[38:18] because that's what the card gets me
[38:21] and you may not every day have a new
[38:23] experience but you could have one if you
[38:24] wanted to
[38:26] because that's what god does that's what
[38:28] he gives i don't want there to be any
[38:30] defeat in the fact that you're not in
[38:31] the practice or routine of doing that
[38:32] and feel like well i must not be a
[38:33] christian no i'm telling you this is
[38:35] just something you can strive for this
[38:37] is something you can believe for this is
[38:39] something that you can have faith to
[38:40] believe that tomorrow morning when you
[38:42] put your feet on the ground you can say
[38:43] today i have the benefit of receiving a
[38:46] new experience a fresh experience a
[38:48] daily renewal the inward man to be
[38:50] renewed and just to have that kind of
[38:52] attitude to believe that this is god's
[38:54] promise and if it doesn't happen to you
[38:57] and you feel like it hasn't taken place
[38:58] lord there must be something wrong on my
[39:00] end because your word never fails i'm
[39:02] going to keep believing because that's
[39:04] the challenge that i'm in right now is
[39:06] to learn to trust and so i want to
[39:08] demonstrate trust
[39:12] it's the daily acts of faith and their
[39:13] simplicity that's going to lead us to
[39:15] this place in our own lives of a mount
[39:17] moriah experience
[39:19] that abraham had that the scripture
[39:21] recognizes as being the moment that
[39:22] abraham's faith was made perfect
[39:26] i'm not leaving that or transitioning
[39:28] from that but this just forms an
[39:30] important foundation and now there's
[39:32] just going to kind of be just two turns
[39:34] here
[39:35] and i want to just look at abraham's
[39:36] life in
[39:38] very quickly some
[39:40] uh some something uh some some something
[39:43] up there you go yeah some something some
[39:45] some dim sum that's a good idea today
[39:47] for lunch
[39:49] are there any good dim sum places in the
[39:51] valley i haven't found one yet
[39:53] still looking in genesis 15 15 says thou
[39:56] shalt go to thy fathers in peace
[39:59] this is god's speaking to him this is a
[40:01] prophecy to him that he must have
[40:03] recognized jehovah shalom is making
[40:06] himself known to me i'm going to go to
[40:07] my my father's in peace i'm not going to
[40:09] die of violent death i'm not going to
[40:10] it's not going to be tragedy you're
[40:11] going to go to your fathers in peace
[40:13] thou shalt be buried in a good old age
[40:17] god promised abraham long life
[40:20] and a good old age in genesis chapter 25
[40:23] verses 7 to 8 it says and these are the
[40:25] days of the years of abraham's life
[40:28] which he lived 103 score in 15 years 175
[40:33] years he lived 103 score in 15 years
[40:36] then abraham gave up the ghost and died
[40:38] in a look at this
[40:40] a good old age
[40:41] exactly what god said you'd be buried in
[40:43] a good old age and he died in a good old
[40:45] age an old man and full of years and was
[40:48] gathered to his people
[40:50] now ponder this for a moment the life of
[40:52] abraham is said to be 175 years old
[40:56] what we what we have covered
[40:58] scripturally is bake about a hundred
[40:59] years from genesis chapter 12 until
[41:02] genesis chapter 25
[41:04] about 100 years of living so if we look
[41:06] at this from genesis 12 to genesis 25
[41:09] that covers a hundred years of a man's
[41:11] life
[41:12] and then when you begin to look and you
[41:14] could just read the headings in your
[41:15] bible and begin to read about the
[41:17] instances you'd find that there's not a
[41:19] lot of stories about a man's life if he
[41:22] lived 100 years
[41:24] in other words my goodness you have
[41:26] books on former presidents that are this
[41:28] thick
[41:29] right
[41:30] and all they're doing is just kind of
[41:31] covering a little bit of their military
[41:32] history and eight years of presidency
[41:35] and you get volumes and volumes and
[41:37] volumes but then when it comes to
[41:38] abraham's life i want you to just look
[41:40] at what it looks like in my bible
[41:44] 175 years right here
[41:47] this is it
[41:49] and think about the books that are
[41:50] written about other people
[41:52] and here's a life 175 years of living
[41:55] and all that's recorded in some of our
[41:57] bibles is it maybe a dozen pages a dozen
[41:59] chapters about a man's life but what's
[42:01] recorded are the highlights
[42:04] that god wanted us to learn by
[42:06] i really do believe that if there was
[42:08] something significant in the life of
[42:10] abraham that would
[42:11] that would would be critical or
[42:13] necessary for us to believe more in
[42:15] jesus christ than it would have been put
[42:17] in there for us to learn by it because
[42:19] the scripture is the things that are
[42:20] recorded of abraham are there for our
[42:22] instruction and for our benefit
[42:24] as it says in romans 15 4 and for
[42:26] whatsoever things were written before
[42:28] time were written for our learning that
[42:30] we through patience and comfort of the
[42:32] scriptures might have hope
[42:35] every event recorded in abraham's life
[42:37] is given sufficient context
[42:39] to encourage our daily faith
[42:41] that you can read these and take
[42:43] something from it this is the word of
[42:45] god this is this has happened this isn't
[42:46] mythology this isn't a love story that's
[42:48] just some sort of fiction you haven't
[42:50] gotten this story out of the fiction
[42:52] section of the bookstore but this is
[42:53] something where every event that's
[42:55] recorded in abraham's life i believe
[42:57] there's sufficient context within the
[42:59] scripture that god can quicken something
[43:01] to us to encourage us in daily faith
[43:03] that we might have comfort from the
[43:05] scripture comfort from the story that it
[43:07] can make us patient because it says the
[43:09] patience and comforts of the scripture
[43:11] will give us hope
[43:14] there's something written in these
[43:15] stories
[43:17] then if we take from abraham and i'm
[43:18] wanting just to emphasize just what a
[43:21] narrow view of abraham's life that we
[43:23] have
[43:24] abraham lived and i think there's maybe
[43:27] two different schools of thought but the
[43:28] definitive that in genesis chapter 12
[43:30] he's 75 years old i think it's generally
[43:32] accepted but only 70 to 75 years of his
[43:35] life are recorded or not there's up to
[43:37] 70 or 75 nothing's recorded of abraham
[43:40] because in genesis chapter 12 he's 75
[43:42] years old
[43:44] in chapter 16 when ishmael is born he's
[43:46] 86 years old
[43:48] genesis chapter 21
[43:50] isaac is born he's 100 years old
[43:52] and genesis chapter 22 just one chapter
[43:55] later 15 years later he's 115 years old
[43:57] when he offers up isaac upon the altar
[44:00] 40 years are covered
[44:03] from genesis chapter 12 to genesis
[44:05] chapter 22 and you look at the events
[44:07] that are recorded
[44:09] i could just rattle them off too in two
[44:10] minutes but i'm not going to do it
[44:11] because i need every minute this morning
[44:14] there's 40 years covered very very
[44:16] quickly from the moment that he leaves
[44:18] out of iran and he's going to travel
[44:20] down into canaan to the moment that he's
[44:22] offering isaac upon the altar it's a
[44:23] he's 115 years old 40 years is
[44:25] represented
[44:28] in genesis chapter 23
[44:30] when sarah dies he's 127 years old
[44:34] when you think about that the
[44:35] significant events that are recorded in
[44:37] his life it's only 57 years that are
[44:39] recorded
[44:40] the moment that he's called out of haran
[44:42] to the moment that he it that his wife
[44:44] dies sarah dies which is really uh you
[44:46] know the next significant event in
[44:48] chapter 24 is finding a wife for isaac
[44:50] so the story begins to focus in on isaac
[44:52] chapter 25 um is just the descendants of
[44:55] abraham and his death and so you think
[44:57] sarah dies in chapter 23 isaac gets the
[44:59] wife in 24 abraham dies in 25 57 years
[45:03] of his life recovered
[45:05] and then in the in up to chapter 23 43
[45:09] years
[45:11] is glossed over in his death
[45:13] 43 more years
[45:15] by genesis 25.
[45:17] i'm sharing this just to think about
[45:19] when we view his life
[45:21] over a hundred year period
[45:25] i would want his faith to become more
[45:27] relatable
[45:28] and at the same time more admirable i
[45:30] wouldn't wouldn't want you to lose
[45:31] respect for it
[45:33] because think about it
[45:36] he only melt he he met with melchizedek
[45:38] had communion with melchizedek once
[45:41] had lunch with the lord once we realized
[45:43] it's the same manifestation of god but
[45:46] in in these years of these visitations
[45:50] and a hundred years of life that's
[45:52] recorded
[45:53] has communion with melchizedek has a
[45:56] lamb sandwich with the lord in genesis
[45:57] 18 and you realize he has these visions
[46:00] in genesis 15 the lord speaks to him in
[46:02] genesis 17
[46:03] these are the highlights of a man's life
[46:06] every day wasn't a dream
[46:08] every day was in a vision every day
[46:11] wasn't well it's noon i guess the lord's
[46:13] gonna show up
[46:14] that wasn't the life that he lived
[46:17] but he did have the privilege of every
[46:19] day communion with god
[46:21] he did have the privilege of every day
[46:23] having a touch point with god with
[46:24] respect to believing the promise he had
[46:26] the privilege every day of communion
[46:28] with god by building an altar by
[46:30] worshiping by communion with him saying
[46:32] lord i believe lord lead me lord guide
[46:34] me he had the opportunity every day in
[46:36] the greatest way to commune with god in
[46:38] simplicity and quietness
[46:42] it wasn't a daily visit to melchizedek
[46:44] daily lunches with elohim it wasn't
[46:46] daily visions and daily dreams a hundred
[46:48] years of his life but yet daily
[46:50] opportunities almost every day to have
[46:52] this experience with god and what is it
[46:54] it's something that god grants to us
[46:56] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:58] and access to his word to daily commune
[47:00] with him
[47:06] that's the example of abraham
[47:10] that's the beauty of the life of abraham
[47:13] as at 175 years
[47:15] we just see the peaks
[47:18] and then we could take from that
[47:20] that where we live most often is in the
[47:22] valley
[47:24] of a daily walk with christ
[47:26] and that's what abraham had that allowed
[47:29] him to achieve the peaks
[47:34] now with abraham i feel like my part of
[47:37] my almost all of my burden of abraham
[47:40] delivered i want to close
[47:42] and my my closing
[47:44] statements you know closing arguments
[47:46] sometimes could take days in a trial
[47:50] in my closing i want to express this
[47:53] the thought of supreme faith revealed in
[47:54] sarah
[47:56] and i know that i'm not doing her life
[47:58] justice by just trying to
[48:00] sum it up here
[48:02] in at the end of this
[48:04] series but let's just begin again with
[48:07] genesis chapter 11 verses 29 and 30.
[48:10] and abram and nehor took them wines and
[48:12] the name of abram's wife was sarah we're
[48:13] introduced to abram
[48:15] immediately introduced to his wife the
[48:17] wife of nehor's wife named neher's
[48:19] the daughter of haran the father of
[48:21] milka the father of iska
[48:23] and then this statement so striking in
[48:25] the narrative especially when you read
[48:27] of the other
[48:28] genealogies and the the begettings it
[48:31] says but sarah was barren she had no
[48:33] child there's a harshness to it sarah
[48:35] which means princess immediately
[48:36] followed up with baron which means
[48:38] sterile comes from the root to pluck up
[48:40] to root up to hamstring or to cut
[48:43] and so it signals there's something
[48:44] that's been uprooted in her she is
[48:46] barren she she's not fertile she's not
[48:48] able to bring forth children
[48:50] and this is the glimpse that we have of
[48:52] sarah and the as the narrative unfolds
[48:53] we realize that sarah is traveling then
[48:56] with abram and abram's given a promise
[48:57] he's going to be the father of many
[48:58] nations going to make his name great and
[49:00] so in genesis chapter 12 because of
[49:03] famine abraham goes down into egypt
[49:05] and she's 65 years old at this point in
[49:08] genesis chapter 12.
[49:10] and we read by in the scripture that she
[49:12] was a fair woman she was a beautiful
[49:13] woman
[49:14] and that
[49:15] abram is telling her listen sarah you're
[49:17] a beautiful woman uh you need to lie and
[49:20] say that you're only my sister so that
[49:22] you um they do not kill me in order to
[49:24] have you as wife
[49:26] and so at 65 years old her being um
[49:30] from babylon and from a different region
[49:32] a different country traveling down into
[49:34] egypt there would have been a different
[49:36] uh beauty to her and a different
[49:38] appearance and she would have been fair
[49:40] she was beautiful by nature and then
[49:42] there would have been this attraction
[49:43] even at 65 years old to where she would
[49:46] have been viewed as desirable
[49:48] and pharaoh wanted to have her as a wife
[49:50] and abraham begins to lie and this is
[49:52] really
[49:53] kind of our this is where we see sarah
[49:55] participating in the story but then 25
[49:59] years later
[50:01] in genesis chapter 20
[50:03] nearly 25 years later should have been
[50:04] almost 90 years old we know for certain
[50:06] she would have been
[50:07] 89 years old in genesis chapter 20
[50:10] abraham goes down into gerar
[50:13] and a similar situation happens in
[50:15] genesis chapter 20 verse 2 and abraham
[50:16] said unto sarah his wife
[50:19] said of of sarah his wife she is my
[50:21] sister and abimelech king of gerard sent
[50:24] and took sarah
[50:27] at 65 years old here it is it's
[50:29] happening in in egypt pharaoh wants
[50:32] sarah to be his wife because of her
[50:33] beauty
[50:35] 25 years later king abimelech wants her
[50:37] to be wife it's striking that in genesis
[50:40] chapter 26 the same thing happens with
[50:43] isaac and rebecca
[50:44] just one of these things i guess it ran
[50:46] in the family
[50:47] uh something about this abimelech but it
[50:49] says a bit like kim guerrar wanted to
[50:51] take sarah and i'm just going to say
[50:53] this and i'm not hiding anything because
[50:54] i know you know the truth of it most of
[50:56] you
[50:56] to be taught in these things but there's
[50:58] a beautiful mystery that is silent in
[51:00] this verse
[51:02] yes she's beautiful and she's fair
[51:04] and genesis chapter 12 but 25 years
[51:07] later when she's nine nearly 90 years
[51:10] old there's still
[51:11] this draw on this attraction where the
[51:13] king
[51:15] wants to take her to a wife and there's
[51:17] this paradox many people have recognized
[51:19] that the commentators and different
[51:20] theologians have recognized this paradox
[51:22] of a king wanting to take a 90 year old
[51:24] woman to be a wife there's some that
[51:26] have speculated that when being a king
[51:28] it was all about economics and forging
[51:29] relationships and abraham had possessing
[51:31] many things this would have been a
[51:33] marriage according to economics to
[51:34] participate and benefit in the different
[51:36] possessions that abraham had there's
[51:38] others that uh knowing that king
[51:40] abimelech would have been about 90 years
[51:41] old they say hey he's 90 she's 90 what a
[51:44] perfect match
[51:45] uh or they attribute to the fact that in
[51:47] those days you lived a longer lifespan
[51:49] so 90s really not as old as we may think
[51:51] it is or they just say hey look she's
[51:53] already beautiful and she was if she's
[51:55] beautiful at 65 she's probably beautiful
[51:56] at 90. but this is just mankind trying
[51:59] to resolve the paradox of why a king of
[52:01] 90 years old would want a woman who was
[52:02] 90 years old right they're just looking
[52:05] hey would a nine-year-old man today want
[52:07] to have a nine-year-old woman today and
[52:08] that's they're just wrestling with maybe
[52:10] a paradox and trying to figure out give
[52:12] an explanation to it but there's a
[52:13] mystery that's hidden in this
[52:15] when the king wants sarah and to marry
[52:17] sarah it's not just going to be
[52:19] explained away by oh that's rational and
[52:21] that makes sense and maybe it means
[52:23] something
[52:24] to somebody but if we look into the word
[52:25] of god the bible already sets up to tell
[52:28] us that sarah is aging
[52:31] and in genesis chapter 18 verses 10 to
[52:33] 15
[52:35] the lord speaking he said i will return
[52:37] i will certainly return unto thee
[52:38] according to the time of life genesis 18
[52:41] we're going to read 10 to 15 and lo
[52:43] sarah thy wife shall have a son
[52:46] and sarah heard it in the tent door
[52:48] which was behind him
[52:50] and abraham and sarah the bible is
[52:52] telling us and abraham and sarah were
[52:54] old and well stricken in age
[52:57] and it ceased to be with sarah after the
[53:00] manner of women
[53:02] this means that she was unfit for
[53:03] conceptions to cease to be after the
[53:05] manner of women in other words there
[53:07] could be no hope of her having a
[53:09] conceiving a child in a natural way we'd
[53:11] already been told that she was barren
[53:14] but now she'd reached a time in her life
[53:15] to where she's no longer able it ceased
[53:17] to be after the men or women where she's
[53:19] in the cycle she's able to conceive this
[53:21] is long past and the bible's wanting to
[53:24] know that if there ever was a moment or
[53:26] window there was a time when sarah
[53:27] naturally is going to be able to
[53:28] conceive we've moved way past that and
[53:31] god does it for a reason so that nobody
[53:32] say well i guess you know she was young
[53:34] enough she's healthy enough and you
[53:36] finally got lucky and you just finally
[53:37] got the rhythm right and everything
[53:38] worked out great and that's why she's
[53:40] had a baby but no god is moving it way
[53:42] past that when we're told she's barren
[53:44] she's not able to have children now it
[53:46] specifically says it ceased to be with
[53:48] sarah after the manner of women she can
[53:50] no longer have a baby the natural way
[53:54] therefore then it just kind of gets real
[53:56] um direct therefore sarah laughed within
[53:58] herself saying after i am waxed old so
[54:00] the bible says old well stricken in age
[54:03] and i'm waxed old now there's maybe a
[54:05] pretty big pic put down after i'm waxed
[54:07] old shall i have pleasure my lord being
[54:11] old also my lord my husband he's waxed
[54:14] old he's even older than me and i'm wax
[54:16] old and well stricken in age and it
[54:18] ceased to be after the manner of women
[54:20] i've passed this particular time shall i
[54:22] have pleasure
[54:25] we could think of this as adults today
[54:26] and realize that she's indicating that
[54:28] something is even different in her
[54:30] relationship with abram where it's
[54:32] physically impossible
[54:34] as brother branham identifies in
[54:36] different places how could this be when
[54:37] abraham and i haven't had well we
[54:40] haven't been as young people family
[54:41] relationship maybe for 20 years
[54:44] this is brother i'm just dramatizing it
[54:45] quoting sarah well maybe we haven't been
[54:47] as young people family relations
[54:50] relationship for 20 years another place
[54:52] see it certainly as a social
[54:54] affair it had ceased many many years and
[54:56] so they didn't have any family affair
[55:00] you see what's being spoken of in the
[55:01] bible
[55:02] in other words this was not going to
[55:04] happen
[55:05] because it doesn't happen by osmosis
[55:09] it couldn't be a
[55:11] uh it wasn't going to happen physically
[55:14] it ceased to be with sarah she's even
[55:16] acknowledged were we even going to have
[55:17] pleasure this doesn't happen anymore
[55:20] so i want you to recognize how sarah had
[55:22] waxed old as well stricken in age and
[55:25] then the lord even speaks to it the lord
[55:26] said unto abraham verse 13 wherefore why
[55:29] did sarah laugh saying shall i have a
[55:31] surety bear a child which i'm old how
[55:33] can i have a child i'm old and then the
[55:36] lord seemingly acknowledges
[55:40] her assessment of her physical condition
[55:42] and her testimony about her current
[55:44] status of a relationship with abraham
[55:46] says is anything too hard for the lord
[55:49] in other words he didn't object oh no
[55:51] sarah you're young you're beautiful
[55:52] you're healthy you're able he
[55:54] acknowledges yeah you're sick you're
[55:56] decrepit you're waxed old you don't have
[55:58] pleasure anymore but is anything too
[56:00] hard for the lord
[56:01] can we not recognize even for ourselves
[56:03] no matter how bad the symptoms are no
[56:05] matter how bad the condition is no
[56:07] matter how bad our circumstances are
[56:09] it's not a matter of denying the
[56:11] symptoms or denying the circumstances
[56:13] but not denying christ that is greater
[56:18] that's the challenge because the
[56:19] symptoms are right in our face
[56:22] and the devil just rubs our face in it
[56:24] you smell that huh you get that and
[56:26] you're like yep but god's greater
[56:28] that's the challenge it's not saying i
[56:30] don't smell anything i don't see
[56:31] anything no but god's greater
[56:33] and so the lord doesn't necessarily
[56:35] argue with her he just says but is that
[56:37] too hard for the lord
[56:40] at the time appointed i will return unto
[56:42] thee according to the time of life and
[56:44] sarah shall have a son
[56:48] and sarah denied saying i laughed not
[56:50] for she was afraid and he said nay
[56:53] but you did laugh
[56:56] notice what's standing out now about
[56:58] sarah is her doubt
[57:01] she's incredulous about the promise
[57:04] imagine that i don't know if there was
[57:05] any ambiguity to her if she wasn't clear
[57:07] on who was visiting but here the lord is
[57:09] saying
[57:10] i am going to allow sarah to conceive
[57:12] and she's like
[57:15] whatevs
[57:17] that's not going to happen
[57:19] and and then she's so she's incredulous
[57:21] about the promise and then when she's
[57:23] called out and she's i didn't laugh me i
[57:25] didn't laugh
[57:26] you know it was hagar where's hagar
[57:28] hagar
[57:29] right she she wouldn't even she lied
[57:31] about it
[57:35] why because she's afraid doubt and fear
[57:39] are the two things that we can gather
[57:40] from genesis 18 about what's working in
[57:42] sarah
[57:43] but when the lord visited her
[57:46] think about right now in this scripture
[57:48] when the lord visited her she's an old
[57:49] woman
[57:51] bible says she's old waxed old
[57:54] well-stricken in age
[57:56] the lord even acknowledging it i don't
[57:58] even have pleasure with my lord anymore
[57:59] and the lord even acknowledges it by
[58:00] asking is anything too hard for the lord
[58:04] romans 4 19 it said about abraham his
[58:06] own body was dead and about sarah the
[58:09] deadness of sarah's womb the bible
[58:11] coming in the new testament saying
[58:12] abraham's body was dead and sarah's womb
[58:15] was dead
[58:16] this is an old woman
[58:19] this is what we see in genesis chapter
[58:21] 18 but it's within the next year
[58:24] that abraham and sarah go down into
[58:26] guerra
[58:27] the next year
[58:28] genesis 18 and then we see 19 tells us a
[58:31] story a really of lot but then it tells
[58:34] us abraham journey with sarah down in a
[58:35] gerard and it's one year later the king
[58:38] wants to take her as a wife
[58:41] why
[58:43] not because of economics
[58:45] not because the king was looking for
[58:46] someone his age
[58:48] not because she was just well she was
[58:49] just a beautiful woman and she she
[58:51] looked young but something supernatural
[58:53] had happened to her
[58:55] because in genesis chapter 21 remember
[58:57] her womb is dead her body's dead cease
[58:58] to have relationships with her husband
[59:00] and genesis chapter 1 21 verses 1-3 in
[59:03] the lord visited sarah for he had said
[59:05] as he had said and the lord did unto
[59:08] sarah as he had spoken what a beautiful
[59:10] poetry he visited sarah as he had said
[59:12] and the lord did unto sarah as he had
[59:14] spoken lord visit me as you have said do
[59:18] unto me as you have spoken
[59:20] see it's almost exactly what mary says
[59:23] be it unto me according to thy word as
[59:25] you did unto sarah as you had spoken do
[59:28] unto me according to thy
[59:30] word for sarah conceived and bear
[59:33] abraham a son in his old age at the set
[59:37] time which god had spoken to him and
[59:39] abraham called the name of his son that
[59:40] was born unto him whom sarah bare to him
[59:42] i love it just keeps repeating over and
[59:44] over again
[59:45] isaac
[59:48] sarah who was barren
[59:51] from genesis chapter 11
[59:54] and then well past
[59:57] the physical possibility well past you
[59:59] know the luck of the lottery and just
[1:00:00] keep trying maybe you'll have your baby
[1:00:02] it had ceased to be with her she was
[1:00:04] waxed old she was aged she would have
[1:00:07] had the appearance of an old woman but
[1:00:09] she goes from that barrenness
[1:00:11] to birth
[1:00:13] to bringing forth the sun
[1:00:18] at 100 years old
[1:00:20] or at the age of 90 years old
[1:00:25] and
[1:00:26] this is just a very simple statement
[1:00:30] and i could end on it but i'm not going
[1:00:31] to end on it
[1:00:33] but this is the thought i want to
[1:00:34] amplify for the next few moments that
[1:00:36] the process
[1:00:39] sarah's process
[1:00:40] from baroness to birth is a type of our
[1:00:43] process
[1:00:44] from birth to body change
[1:00:47] her process of being absolutely barren
[1:00:50] and coming to the place where she's
[1:00:51] going to bring forth a son at 90 years
[1:00:53] old is a say is a type of our process of
[1:00:56] going from the new birth to a body
[1:00:58] change
[1:00:59] she shows us and i want you just to grab
[1:01:01] ahold of this i am closing i just got
[1:01:03] some statements i want to read to you
[1:01:04] from the message of the hour for as part
[1:01:06] of my closing the harder you pull the
[1:01:07] faster i'll preach but she shows us that
[1:01:10] we too can go from doubt and fear
[1:01:14] to bring forth the promise of god
[1:01:17] and not necessarily taking decades
[1:01:20] because she goes from genesis 18 89
[1:01:22] years old fearing lying doubting
[1:01:24] laughing to bringing forth the sun
[1:01:28] and it was something that happened very
[1:01:29] quickly within her life it was something
[1:01:30] that transpired to where god is taking
[1:01:33] this old woman and something takes place
[1:01:35] in her life that brings it from a place
[1:01:37] of doubt to manifesting the promise
[1:01:39] and really as i began to look at the
[1:01:41] life of sarah over the last several
[1:01:42] months only
[1:01:44] just by using this story in genesis 18
[1:01:46] and then in genesis 21 almost nothing
[1:01:49] else is recorded of her
[1:01:51] before this
[1:01:52] except when it relates to hagar
[1:01:55] and what did she do in genesis 16 hey
[1:01:57] maybe hagar's the one
[1:01:59] right maybe you could have a son by
[1:02:00] hagar why don't you
[1:02:02] have a child by my servant and then what
[1:02:05] does she immediately do resents it
[1:02:07] immediately
[1:02:08] and she changes her mind and she's
[1:02:10] jealous of it and really all you really
[1:02:12] see is this contention this conflict
[1:02:14] relating to hagar and even the son
[1:02:15] ishmael later on after isaac's born
[1:02:17] outside of that there's not a lot that's
[1:02:19] told of us about sarah uh
[1:02:21] that we would know except that she was
[1:02:23] beautiful in chapter 12. she uh she
[1:02:25] suggested hagar in chapter 16. and
[1:02:27] before this all oh this is the greatest
[1:02:29] details we have about her now she's old
[1:02:31] she's well stricken in age she's
[1:02:33] doubting the promise once again like she
[1:02:34] did in chapter 16. she's laughing at
[1:02:36] she's fearful she's lying
[1:02:39] but think of it the lord visited sarah
[1:02:41] as he had said and the lord did unto
[1:02:43] sarah as he had spoken all it took was
[1:02:44] one day with the lord
[1:02:46] that was it
[1:02:47] all it took was a moment
[1:02:50] and all of sarah's doubted in chapter 16
[1:02:52] all of her age in chapter 18 oliver
[1:02:54] laughing in chapter 18 all of her doubts
[1:02:56] in chapter 18 all of her fears and lies
[1:02:58] in chapter 18 all it took was the lord
[1:03:00] to visit her
[1:03:02] all it took was for the word to be
[1:03:04] spoken over her
[1:03:06] and then nothing could stop the effect
[1:03:08] of the word upon her
[1:03:11] the lord
[1:03:12] did unto sarah as he had spoken
[1:03:14] as he visited her as he had said
[1:03:17] it was the word that brought her to a
[1:03:19] change
[1:03:20] and the unconditional covenant that god
[1:03:22] made with his people he says we know
[1:03:23] that god had to do something speaking of
[1:03:25] sarah to the womb of sarah didn't he she
[1:03:28] had been barren all these years nearly
[1:03:30] 100 years old and was barren now
[1:03:31] remember the process of sarah going from
[1:03:33] barrenness to the birth of isaac is a
[1:03:36] type of the process of us going from
[1:03:37] faith to body change i'm preaching about
[1:03:39] the supreme faith revealed in abraham
[1:03:41] supreme faith revealed in sarah and he
[1:03:44] says
[1:03:44] well in order it's a mixed audience but
[1:03:46] you listen to your doctor i'm your
[1:03:48] brother in order to do something to make
[1:03:50] this he had to recreate something in
[1:03:52] that woman's womb to make it fertile is
[1:03:54] that right in order to do it he had to
[1:03:56] stimulate her heart because she couldn't
[1:03:58] go into labor like that a woman almost
[1:04:00] 100 100 years old is that right couldn't
[1:04:02] do it and another thing what about the
[1:04:04] milk veins god doesn't and god doesn't
[1:04:06] he says god doesn't patch up anything
[1:04:08] but let me say he's wanting us to think
[1:04:09] about this a 90 year old woman having a
[1:04:11] baby
[1:04:13] wax old well stricken in age cease to be
[1:04:15] as it was at the met of men or women no
[1:04:18] longer having pleasure with her lord all
[1:04:19] these things are true of sarah and
[1:04:21] saying if she's going to have a baby i
[1:04:24] want you to notice that she's going to
[1:04:25] have a baby at 90. god has a process god
[1:04:28] has a way
[1:04:30] and and to us we'd say oh he's still god
[1:04:32] he can take an old weak
[1:04:35] a woman who can't have a baby and just
[1:04:37] let her have a baby
[1:04:39] right just imagine a nine-year-old woman
[1:04:41] having a baby but god's way is different
[1:04:42] than our way he says i'm going to do
[1:04:44] something i'm going to make her able
[1:04:48] so listen there's a process and i had a
[1:04:50] lot of things maybe there'll be a part
[1:04:52] 17.
[1:04:54] there was a lot of notes i wanted to
[1:04:55] share with you on the process god has a
[1:04:57] process god has a process god has a
[1:04:58] process in yielding to that process
[1:05:00] there's a way that god wants to take us
[1:05:02] to a body change we can't just sit
[1:05:04] cross-legged and hum long enough to get
[1:05:06] rapture in faith you've got to go
[1:05:08] through the process
[1:05:10] there's got to be faith and the
[1:05:11] experiencing the working out of that
[1:05:14] faith and god has to take us through the
[1:05:15] process so god just didn't take an eight
[1:05:17] a 90 year old woman then one day she's
[1:05:19] like oh i feel funny i think i'm having
[1:05:20] a baby no he took her through a process
[1:05:24] because god is looking at he had to make
[1:05:26] a womb that was fertile he had to give
[1:05:27] her a heart that could
[1:05:29] last through labor he had to give her
[1:05:31] the ability to nurse that baby god
[1:05:33] doesn't patch up anything he made sarah
[1:05:36] a new woman he made her a young
[1:05:37] beautiful woman again and he made
[1:05:39] abraham a young man again he turned them
[1:05:42] back to show what he's going to do in
[1:05:45] the rapture to us
[1:05:47] oh in the beautiful the beginning of
[1:05:49] christianity he expresses the end and
[1:05:52] the goal of christianity
[1:05:55] eternity newness of life even a new body
[1:05:59] in the beginning he's already showing
[1:06:01] the end
[1:06:03] and feast of the trumpets he says notice
[1:06:05] what happened immediately she turned
[1:06:07] back to a lovely young woman
[1:06:09] showing in there portraying what he's
[1:06:11] going to do to the royal seat of abraham
[1:06:13] to receive the son that's been promised
[1:06:15] there's a lot with the order here that
[1:06:17] i'm wanting you to catch that your
[1:06:18] change is going to become before the
[1:06:20] meeting
[1:06:21] you're not going to meet him in the air
[1:06:22] and change you're going to change before
[1:06:24] you meet him in the air it's important
[1:06:25] that you recognize that because if
[1:06:27] you're thinking the image of a 900-foot
[1:06:29] jesus is going to stimulate rapturing
[1:06:30] faith to put you in a new body you're
[1:06:32] going to miss it or you're missing it
[1:06:34] you've got to recognize the christ who
[1:06:37] is present with you now wanting to take
[1:06:39] you under his wing and mentor you into a
[1:06:42] new body
[1:06:46] she turned back young they went down
[1:06:48] into garage what happened abimelech the
[1:06:49] king fell in love with her said she's
[1:06:51] fair and beautiful and was going to
[1:06:52] marry her is that right old grandma
[1:06:55] and all them other pretty girls down
[1:06:56] there granny she's beautiful she's fair
[1:06:59] to look upon
[1:07:00] god changed her body and turned them
[1:07:03] back
[1:07:04] notice how he places it it's a mystery
[1:07:05] that's to be revealed now in this day by
[1:07:08] the son of man the evening message
[1:07:10] turn back this is the mystery in genesis
[1:07:13] 20 where it says that the king wanted to
[1:07:15] take her to be a wife what's silent
[1:07:17] there is it's not economics it's not
[1:07:19] politics it's not that she was it's not
[1:07:22] the the the physical popularity what she
[1:07:24] would have been as a 90-year-old woman
[1:07:26] she just lived a good clean life never
[1:07:28] did drugs and i never wore makeup and
[1:07:30] her skin was perfect and she used cold
[1:07:32] water every morning splash cold water in
[1:07:34] her face she never got a wrinkle because
[1:07:35] she knew just use the coldest water and
[1:07:37] you'll never get a wrinkle she had good
[1:07:38] genetics none of that was the case it
[1:07:40] was a mystery that god had turned sarah
[1:07:43] back to a young woman again
[1:07:46] and even abraham
[1:07:49] he says turn him back and that's the
[1:07:50] last sign they seen was that discernment
[1:07:52] the last thing that we see in the
[1:07:53] scripture is genesis 18
[1:07:55] before the change of the body comes and
[1:07:57] before we can ever receive the sun what
[1:08:00] happens
[1:08:02] before we can ever receive the sun it's
[1:08:03] like this meeting in the air the trump
[1:08:05] of god shall sound the dead in christ
[1:08:06] shall rise first a new body and we which
[1:08:09] are alive and remain shall be changed in
[1:08:10] a moment in a twinkling of an eye and
[1:08:12] shall be caught up together to meet the
[1:08:14] lord in the air this statement to me is
[1:08:16] so beautiful the secret has been made
[1:08:17] known
[1:08:19] the seals are open i know that sounds
[1:08:21] maybe mysterious and oh what does that
[1:08:23] even relate to it's very simple it's
[1:08:24] very practical it's the fact the bride
[1:08:27] has all she needs to overcome
[1:08:29] to prevail
[1:08:31] to rise above omicron to rival rise
[1:08:33] above
[1:08:34] everything that would come against her
[1:08:35] to rise above anything that would try to
[1:08:37] weaken your faith not that we don't get
[1:08:38] sick not that we don't lose jobs not
[1:08:40] that we don't have financial pressure
[1:08:42] but we have what we need available to us
[1:08:43] to learn to trust and demonstrate trust
[1:08:46] we have god has not holding anything
[1:08:48] back to us
[1:08:50] the secret has been made known
[1:08:56] this is
[1:08:57] a beautiful statement here in question
[1:08:59] and answers part three
[1:09:01] someone asked brother brandon the
[1:09:02] question please explain the mystery of
[1:09:04] the translation of the bride it's like

[1:09:20] with me a story one time he'd ask to
[1:09:21] brother branham uh what can we do to be
[1:09:22] more spiritual and the way he kind of
[1:09:24] shared the story with me it's kind of
[1:09:25] like everybody's weighted with baited
[1:09:26] breath like right get this down don't

[1:09:37] no seriously what can i do to be more
[1:09:39] spiritual
[1:09:40] pray pray read your bible every day
[1:09:43] that that's the simplicity of it so
[1:09:44] here's the question please explain the
[1:09:46] mystery the translation of the bride
[1:09:48] just to change he says our bodies now he
[1:09:50] says let's say our and then he says you
[1:09:51] know what i mean when i say that i don't
[1:09:53] mean to be sacrilegious i don't mean to
[1:09:55] say ours i don't mean to say this church
[1:09:57] i mean to say every believer
[1:10:00] abraham so now he's going to get into
[1:10:02] this he was looking for a promised son
[1:10:04] that was promised him
[1:10:06] and the church is looking for a promised
[1:10:08] son
[1:10:09] the bride is looking for the prominent
[1:10:12] son
[1:10:12] before the promised son could come to
[1:10:15] sarah and abraham their bodies had to be
[1:10:17] changed she was too old to have a baby
[1:10:19] she had no milk veins in her breast her
[1:10:21] breasts were dried up her womb wasn't
[1:10:22] fertile she was sterile she could not
[1:10:24] have the baby her heart was too old to
[1:10:26] stand labor so what happened god
[1:10:30] changed her back to a young woman and he
[1:10:33] did this abraham the same thing because
[1:10:35] he said his body was as good as dead and
[1:10:38] he had to change their body in order to
[1:10:40] receive the promised son and we cannot
[1:10:43] re receive the promised son that's
[1:10:46] promised us today in these bodies that
[1:10:48] we live in these bodies are sin
[1:10:51] and this is what i and i want to share
[1:10:53] this if the musicians would come i i
[1:10:55] just have another statement i'll read
[1:10:57] before we stand in prayer
[1:10:59] that this if you could take now
[1:11:00] everything that we've expressed in the
[1:11:02] life of abraham when it comes to this
[1:11:04] point the translation it this is going
[1:11:07] to be achieved what did sarah do she had
[1:11:10] to believe god she had to be have a
[1:11:13] promise she was elected to it she was
[1:11:15] ordained to it despite her doubting
[1:11:17] despite her laughing despite her line
[1:11:19] god had made her a promise and he was
[1:11:21] going to bring the promise to her and
[1:11:23] she just had to be in position to
[1:11:25] receive it and to accept it and there
[1:11:28] she stayed faithful to her husband there
[1:11:29] she walked by his side abraham himself
[1:11:32] stayed faithful to the promise despite
[1:11:34] his doubtings and his journey as it's
[1:11:35] all a walk of faith and then one day
[1:11:38] please explain the translation the
[1:11:40] mystery of the translation of the bride
[1:11:42] it is going to be a change of the body
[1:11:44] just like it was in abraham and sarah
[1:11:46] then i know that what i must do is
[1:11:49] believe god and walk with him
[1:11:53] and that what
[1:11:55] we need for that is here
[1:11:58] that we're not waiting on another
[1:12:00] visitation
[1:12:02] because if that's what's needed to
[1:12:04] receive the promised son
[1:12:06] that's what's needed to see him
[1:12:08] than i have already at work within me
[1:12:10] now
[1:12:11] what's needed for the change
[1:12:15] the word is here
[1:12:19] to give us rapturing
[1:12:20] faith my last statement in the message
[1:12:23] the faith of abraham
[1:12:25] he says god turned sarah and abraham
[1:12:28] back to a young man
[1:12:30] and a young woman again
[1:12:33] he will do all the seed of abraham the
[1:12:35] same way
[1:12:37] turned them back young again
[1:12:40] when they come from the dust of the
[1:12:41] earth not all great headed and broke
[1:12:43] down but young in the very splendor of
[1:12:45] health
[1:12:46] always will be that way forever and ever
[1:12:49] never to blemish
[1:12:51] sin will be done away with
[1:12:53] there'll be no serpent in that garden of
[1:12:55] eden
[1:12:56] he will be done away with forever
[1:12:58] it'll all be renewed again
[1:13:01] god's great purpose
[1:13:03] and he cannot be defeated
[1:13:05] because he's god
[1:13:07] this is what we're living for
[1:13:09] this is what we're believing in
[1:13:11] that there is a life beyond this one
[1:13:14] that there is an eternity awaiting us
[1:13:16] and that the supreme faith revealed in
[1:13:18] abraham speaks of the faith that we have
[1:13:19] in this end time and i say just trust
[1:13:22] him with everything that is in you
[1:13:24] believe in the miracle
[1:13:26] of his word in your life and in your
[1:13:27] heart
[1:13:28] and daily
[1:13:30] daily yield to him that you too could be
[1:13:33] like sarah
[1:13:34] and just watch yourself walk right into
[1:13:36] a new body
[1:13:38] to receive the promised son
[1:13:40] remember her process of going from
[1:13:41] barrenness
[1:13:43] to birth
[1:13:44] we can see ourselves going from faith
[1:13:46] to rapturing faith could we stand today
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:13:57] let's pray together
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:07] our gracious heavenly father
[1:14:14] it's inspiring to read
[1:14:17] a book
[1:14:18] that we know you wrote
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:24] and the list of critics that have
[1:14:28] said
[1:14:29] disparaging things about this book
[1:14:33] will never end
[1:14:34] [Music]
[1:14:36] until the day that
[1:14:41] all natural life is vanquished
[1:14:45] because it's questioned it's doubted
[1:14:47] it's assailed it's picked at it's
[1:14:51] even people who claim to believe it tear
[1:14:53] its pages out and deny parts of it
[1:14:57] but it's so refreshing
[1:14:59] to be a christian that believes this
[1:15:00] book is true
[1:15:03] and not through dissonance or just you
[1:15:05] know
[1:15:06] overcoming doubt but to have a real
[1:15:08] anchored faith deep within our hearts
[1:15:10] this is the word of god
[1:15:14] and that's why we could read the story
[1:15:15] about a 75 year old man who begins to
[1:15:17] travel down into a land he'd never been
[1:15:19] before with his wife
[1:15:20] believing in his heart that one day he'd
[1:15:22] be the father of many nations
[1:15:26] that's why we can believe and be
[1:15:28] encouraged by his journeys and his
[1:15:30] pathways what he went through and what
[1:15:31] he experienced
[1:15:33] even to 115 years old
[1:15:36] when he offered up that son isaac upon
[1:15:38] an altar
[1:15:40] we believe it's true lord
[1:15:43] and we believe that you preserved this
[1:15:45] story of abraham that it might
[1:15:47] not necessarily not create a faith in us
[1:15:50] in abraham but create a greater faith in
[1:15:52] us for you
[1:15:54] and a longing for you
[1:15:56] my prayer would be today as we close
[1:15:59] this service and also this series
[1:16:02] that there'd be a greater love and
[1:16:03] thirst for jesus christ
[1:16:06] and not for religion and not for
[1:16:08] churchianity and not just
[1:16:10] and some sort of ism or an
[1:16:12] organizational life
[1:16:15] but a true thirst for you
[1:16:18] in light of the promise that you've
[1:16:20] given
[1:16:22] for abraham and sarah no matter how many
[1:16:25] acres of cattle
[1:16:28] they had or land they had or how many
[1:16:30] head of cattle they had no matter how
[1:16:31] many servants no matter how rich you
[1:16:33] made abraham none of that is emphasized
[1:16:36] and given preeminence in their lives
[1:16:38] though it's referenced
[1:16:40] that's not what they sought after that's
[1:16:42] not what becomes the focal point of the
[1:16:43] story the focal point of the story is
[1:16:45] the promise you made them
[1:16:47] to have a son
[1:16:49] and lord may we have a craven and a
[1:16:52] desire in our hearts not to be good
[1:16:53] church members and not just to play the
[1:16:55] part and not just to be able to say oh
[1:16:57] look at me i'm blessed i'm getting
[1:16:58] promotion i'm getting this i'm getting
[1:17:00] that i i'm doing good but to truly
[1:17:03] thirst
[1:17:04] for your word as it relates to the
[1:17:05] promise
[1:17:08] and i believe that you want to do
[1:17:09] extraordinary things with us
[1:17:11] as we see a year coming to the close
[1:17:14] to think lord that we're soon entering
[1:17:16] another year it just seems like they go
[1:17:18] by so fast
[1:17:19] this is a time where humanity stops and
[1:17:21] looks back and
[1:17:23] and maybe turns a new page and looks
[1:17:25] forward to resolutions and a new
[1:17:27] beginning a new start lord may we become
[1:17:29] more inspired than ever to be genuine
[1:17:32] christians
[1:17:33] that display the love of christ to
[1:17:35] others that it can humble themselves
[1:17:36] when they're wrong that can be willing
[1:17:38] to risk rejection lord when it when it
[1:17:41] calls for standing for truth
[1:17:46] but i was inspired by my friend
[1:17:48] brother stephen sharing with me
[1:17:51] how fearless he's become with the
[1:17:53] message to share it
[1:17:55] regardless of the consequences
[1:17:58] i pray that we likewise as a church
[1:18:02] would not be ashamed of this gospel
[1:18:06] knowing that we have something to offer
[1:18:10] lord we can preach grace we can preach
[1:18:12] safety we can preach
[1:18:13] uh
[1:18:16] loving kindness and forgiveness
[1:18:18] but we must demonstrate it ourselves
[1:18:20] lord
[1:18:22] may we not merely be those that speak of
[1:18:24] it but may we be those that live it
[1:18:27] and my prayer is that we would
[1:18:30] continue in this process from faith to
[1:18:32] perfect faith by your grace
[1:18:36] may we experience daily acts of faith
[1:18:38] get into the routine of trusting you and
[1:18:40] believe in you and watching your word be
[1:18:42] fulfilled
[1:18:43] i commit us to you now lord as we always
[1:18:46] do
[1:18:48] asking that you take control of us use
[1:18:50] us for your glory
[1:18:52] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:18:55] amen amen
