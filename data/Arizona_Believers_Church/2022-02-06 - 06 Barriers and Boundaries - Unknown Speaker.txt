TRANSCRIPT
========================================
luke chapter 6 start with verse 27 but i say unto you which here love your enemies do good to them which hate you do you believe that these are the words of jesus christ it's written in red so even the the nominal christians the denominational christians these are the ones that they ought to believe and practice it says bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away the cloak forbid not to take thy coat also give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again and as you would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise for if you love them which love you what thank have you for sinners also love those that love them and if you do good to them which do good to you which thank have you for sinners also do even the same and if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what thank have you presenters also lend to senator sinners to receive as much again but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your word reward shall be great you shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil be therefore merciful as your father also is merciful just to interject this in matthew chapter 5 where the full sermon on the mount has been given their beginning in matthew chapter 5. these same scriptures are uh same sayings are being said and as he says you'll be the children of the highest for he is kind and the unthankful and to the evil says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so these things are quite remarkable characteristics of a true believer be therefore merciful as your father also is merciful judge not ye shall not be judged condemn not ye shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you met with all it shall be measured to you again and spake a parable and you spake a parable unto them can the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into the ditch the disciple is not above his master but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye but perceiveth not the beam that is in thine own eye those words relate to one being larger than the other and as the scripture would have it the one who's wanting to remove uh the obstruction the other person's eye has one it's even bigger than the one in the eye the one that he wants to remedy says and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye but perceives not the beam that is in thine own eye either how can't thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye when thou thyself behold us not the beam that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shall shalt thou see clearly to pull the mote that is in thy brother's eye and power heads heavenly father as we are gathered together today and have worshiped and praised and lifted you up and exalted your name as we have laid aside the demands upon our time in our minds and even labored to set aside all the thoughts about the resources that are being used and the things that are scarce and how necessary it is to do certain things lord we're just washed now in this moment and we're looking to you to come to break the bread of life and to speak to us give us those things which we have need of and lord as you speak to us we'll we'll hear and we'll know that it is you so i pray father that you bless your people that you give them strength and courage today as we are living in a great time and the the most wonderful time to be alive as a christian it's also the darkest time this world has ever been in and there's another side to that lord and this law of contrast and i pray that you could just so get our attention today to pull away from all the nastiness of the world and all the darkness of politics and all the frivolity of society and not look at all those things and not look at this layla to see an age descending into chaos but lord just stay in step and continue to ascend and we just commit all things to you today desiring that you take control this part of the service for your glory in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you you can be seated continue on the subject of barriers and boundaries there's been a lot that has been said to this point and i find myself reflecting on some of the initial services and realizing that i hope that we're not too far away from some of the foundational points that we've ministered on this because in a lot of ways it was kind of setting laying the foundation and setting the parameters and the boundaries of uh what we want to talk about so that we we realize uh where the where the emphasis is and where my burden is because i think there's maybe a lot of ways you could just cherry pick certain principles or just assume what direction i may be going and so i think it's very important to maybe keep in mind some of these other things that we've been ministering on today we're going to begin a subject on this same topic i want to finish some of the things on pride but also can segue into another part on setting limits and so we are going to be discussing on setting limits because a boundary is the limits of something that's something that determines the extent or the furthest point to reach of something uh barriers are obstacles to entry uh a boundary would be a wall a part of a boundary could be a door but then a barrier would be something put in front of that door to keep you from entering in so there's a difference between barriers and boundaries and today we're going to be using looking at the thought of setting limits and i do want to i don't know how much time we'll spend on this part but then in the future services lord willing talk about recognizing limits so we set limits but we also recognize limits our own limitations the limits of others and in the subject of recognizing limits and i've done a lot of been doing a lot of studying on what love ain't and uh and there's things that we have to even recognize uh certain things how love expresses itself how love responds and hopefully we'll touch on those things in recognizing limits and then hopefully have some time and inspiration to uh talk about addressing barriers in our lives and even other people's barriers and how that we ought to approach those so it kind of gives you a little bit of a road map of the things that we're wanting to look at but on uh the subject of barriers and boundaries we spent two services i believe it was on the pride paradox and we said it used this terminology if you'd use different terminology it's this is not a doctrine so i wouldn't object but we've talked about a good pride and a bad pride if you want to talk a good pride is confidence and self-respect or uh um faith and those different things that's certainly fine with me but we used it in the phrasing of a good pride and a bad pride and we've emphasized how if you have that bad pride or the the pride that we're most familiar with it doesn't respect boundaries and it's always laying barriers it's always setting traps and so it's something that we recognize that bad pride is gonna go right beyond barriers um and it's gonna it's gonna go right beyond boundaries it's gonna set barriers and it's a it's something that prohibits us from walking in the fullness of the character of christ now let's look at these last two verses of our text luke chapter 6 verses 41 and 42 because i want to pick up where we were on wednesday night and and kind of wrap up some things on this dichotomy of a good pride and a bad pride jesus says and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye but perceiveth not the beam that is in thine owner you've got they've got a splinter you've got a stick and and he's saying why would you why are you doing this either how can't thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the moat that is in the eye when thou thyself behold this not so now it's like you're not even aware you're not even conscious you're not even sensitive you don't even recognize the hypocrisy in this or the contradiction behold it's not the beam that is in thine own eye so there's a i don't know if it would be narcissism if it would just be cluelessness insensitivity some brashness he jesus relates it to hypocrisy which is rooted in pride he says thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eyes in other words remove your barrier first recognize your obstacles your hindrances in some sense maybe even recognize your limitations then you can see yourself soberly then you can see yourself in such a way to know that this impediment in my own eye has been removed i can be more empathetic to my brother as i begin to remove his and you can also he says see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye so now you're actually seeing the right way you see the need the right way you can respond the right way and so it's really i know a lot of times the emphasis is on the hypocrisy of the person and the brashness and he is dealing with this negative pride but it's such a deeper principle and that's one thing i want to touch on is how he's talking about uh even in a healthy way recognizing yourself and in the healthy way helping others but as he refers to hypocrisy it's it's identifying this presumptive arrogance that we would call the bad pride or this nasty pride and we put it in these terms on wednesday that jesus is looking at it may have even been last sunday as well that jesus is saying take care of your problem first and and we recognize that this might seem to be kind of a counter intuitive to what paul teaches later look upon the needs of others and eternal life is living for others so we might think that instinctively i i don't worry about my own problems i don't have to take care of my own house and it doesn't matter what's wrong with me i'm just going to try to help everybody else and i'm going to help this person and in some ways or what jesus is identifying is just how much hypocrisy that is when you yourself are not taking the medicine you yourself are not obeying the word of god you yourself are not in the position that you ought to be in in order to be of service and of you so he's saying that you have to take care of your problem first and there are some other scriptures that are coming to mind that we've used over the last couple services but this one i think um identifies it it was in galatians where paul is uh in galatians we are using those scriptures and how paul is talking about good pride and bad pride in addressing those in order for us to be in the position to bear your own burden and bear you one another's burdens and so he had to deal with these two opposite sides of pride and so the solution to arrogance was a proper opinion of yourself the the solution to pride and this presumption and these and arrogance is to see yourself the right way not a negative opinion of yourself but a correct opinion not a bad opinion of yourself not a a an idea that you're broken and you're unable and you're no good but an honest opinion of yourself because jesus says you know why don't you get the beam out of your own eye because you're completely unfit and unable to help anybody in the first place you fool he says no just get the beam out of your eye then you'll be able to see clearly to pull the moat that is in thy brother's eye so there's not even rebuke of motive to want to remove the moat there's not even a rebuke of ability that you can't even do it he's just saying hey let's just first things first let's address things in the right order and i think we've touched on this last year through different um different services on how you have to do things in the correct order it wasn't talking about practice even i think it's like you have to do things first things have to be done the right way and we can look at all these things in the word of god that you must do that you must do but you have to recognize where you are and if you're a sinner repent first there's in order you have to repent first in order to do the other things to walk in the paces of god's word and so that's the solution uh to pride is to see yourself the right way and as jesus is talking about removing the mote that is in thy brother's eye he's talking about one getting rid of hypocrisy so there's a proper opinion of oneself there's a view as paul talks about it ye who are spiritual restore such a one who has a moat in their eye and and restore that one but do so in a spirit of meekness considering your own self this is the proper opinion of oneself so it's only safely in within the boundaries of what god has called us to be safely within god's borders that we can help others with their barriers if we're kind of out if we're drowning you're not going to save somebody else's drowning and so there has to be some position of safety and confidence to be able to help others and we use these uh these principles that pride is about self-control uh pride is about defining yourself in boundaries or about defining yourself and boundaries are about controlling yourself and we looked at how that self-control is at the heart of pride self-control is at the heart of setting boundaries and so if you are a victim of pride which we all are so we just need to be honest with ourselves it's something that we need to guard and they say that humility is a funny thing as soon as you think you have it you've lost it and so that's the that's kind of the the proper edge that we must always have is never oh you know if there's just one thing i'm so grateful for i'm so glad i'm humble like if i didn't have this humility i mean come on uh you you it's one of those things that you just kind of always have this edge lord keep me humble lord i want to humble myself because if you have a bad pride you can't help yourself you certainly can't help others and without a good pride you can't help yourself and you can't help others so just that little balance set with the good pride which is a healthy view of yourself a pride and christian virtue a dignity a respect a recognition of what you're called to a belief now your shoulders back i'm a son of god i'm an heir of a kingdom my confidence is in the election and the seed not the flesh as brother brown talks about how it's not the man that comes predestinated in the church book i believe it is but it's the seed and you're recognizing yeah i mean i inherited this body basically from my mom and dad and my nature from my mom and dad but by the new birth by election there's something of value there's something of worth that's making sense of that nature and nurture and bring this gold that god has ordained for me to come into perfection of and so there's you got to have a good pride now in matthew chapter 5 verses 12 to 16 and it's just really i'm just kind of skimming over some just kind of touching the surface of it and i've been studying on the subject of salt and my goodness there's a lot a lot to be said on this and i just kind of want to brush over it maybe we'll come back to it later if the lord would inspire but i just want to stay very close to what he's quickened to me jesus says rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you you know what he's talking about we should rejoice and be seating gladden in the persecution and so he says ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt hath lost its savior wherewith shall it be salted how can it get it savor again if it's lost it it is then forth good for nothing but to be cast out and be trodden under foot of man so think of this because i want to come i don't necessarily want to spend a lot of time on this aspect but this image comes to mind that if something loses its power or the salt if it loses its efficacy if it no longer retains the qualities that make it valuable it becomes trodden under the feet of man so once it loses its uh characteristics then it's a doormat once you lose its characteristics it's stepped on it's despised it's rejected it's thought less of he says and verse 14 ye are the light of the world this is now salt and light these are two incredible elements that jesus is relating us to you are the salt of the earth and now the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven what amazing characteristics that jesus wants us to align ourselves with and as we've been addressing a good pride and want us to think more healthy about ourselves and our calling and how see ourselves as god sees us and see others as god sees sees them to compare us to salt and light i mean he takes these elements and presents them to uh the believers say this is what you are you're the salt of the earth not just your neighborhood but of the earth you are the light of the world this is incredible position and calling that the believer has now just specifically on the subject of salt he says when salt becomes tasteless it means it's kind of lost its the root of the word is foolishness when it's become foolishness it's not serving its purpose anymore this is what it's good for when it loses its characteristics when it loses its taste not just its taste and its seasoning power but its preserving power and its power to hold away corruption and all the positive benefits of the that salt has is at that point it becomes worthless so if it's not demonstrating its power if it doesn't have if it's not expressing these essential uh the nutrients and the effect and the impact and there's so much that can be said just on the subject it says then it just is kind of good for nothing it's stepped under the feet of men men don't regard it in other words if salt didn't have its characteristics then man would just treat it like dirt so as the salt of the earth if i could express it this way we cannot lose uh we cannot fail to express our essential qualities we are the salt of the earth we have to have a confidence that i'm salt therefore i i come with certain characteristics i have certain qualities i have a certain power as salt then i'm seasoning something and paul uses that analogy later with our our speech if i'm salt then i can hold away corruption i can preserve if i'm if i'm salt i have a i have a certain benefit that comes with it and so we cannot lose our essential qualities we cannot fail to express uh what we are and and what god has made us brother adam says you just get salty the earth will get thirsty you live such in your neighborhood and around your people the people know say there's a real christian i tell you that if there ever was a christian there she is or there he is that's the way to be this is a kind of a theme that brother venom uses about getting salty just gets salty the earth gets thirsty and it seems to be maybe a little bit of a trick in some restaurants and where they're going to serve you a salty appetizer in order to kind of quicken this desire in this thirst and they that's one of the ideas i think behind a happy hour is that they want to serve you a lot of cheap salty snacks so you keep drinking a lot of ordering a lot of drinks and running your bill up because salt makes one thirsty or it causes you to crave and that's at least the the logic or a principle that's used about it but brother man is saying we have to be salty now salt is symbolic of a lot of things there's just so much imagery and meaning and so much to draw from when he says you are the salt of the earth and i think you yourselves can begin to think about this it's symbolic of many things it's used to preserve it's used for for health it's used for seasoning food and salt is even was regarded as a currency something that could be bartered for it was something that was just not readily available you there wasn't just all these different salts and salt and salt shakers everywhere it was something that could even be used as currency something could be used in exchange so salt had a lot of meaning in jesus day maybe more than it does now so it's a very powerful illusion not an illusion but an illusion to think of us in these terms of salt but there's two sides to salt you could be salty in a good way or you can be salty in a bad way it says you are the salt of the earth salty or salt has an interesting history of negative connotations it was even i found the etymology etymologist in me found that there was a time in the 16th and 17th century where salty was used to kind of express somebody who's a little bit risque and maybe a little bit too forward or inappropriately forward and aggressive in that way so it has there's a lot of negative connotations historically with the insulting uh maybe even we're more familiar with the use of something salty being angry or irritated or maybe a semen or something would be salty and he's tough or aggressive someone who's salty can be exceptionally bitter they're so they're bitter they're angry they're resentful they're upset and then some of the more fun uses of salty uh we might be familiar with uh in in the kind of the slaying like you're jumping salty right that's the way we use it back in philly as you're jumping salty it talks about somebody who's unexpectedly are suddenly angry man he was jumping salty and so it's a way that it's used even for someone who's kind of embarrassing or annoyed annoyed well they got all salty when i brought up the fact that this that happened and that happened so there's i mean you've said something oh he's salty i mean uh i mean the world would be like i know tell me about it right in a negative sense but then there's this you are the salt of the earth certain characteristics and attributes certain expression certain way you're carrying yourself an attitude that you have but it's used in a positive light and i i realized now i did bring it with me i have a few pages of notes here where brother branham in the question and answers in 1964 in august of 1964 he uses his term be salty in response to several different questions i'll just maybe count them real quick i think six six seven questions he uses the the principle of b salt in response to him and the questions are very interesting very varied but they're mostly focusing on uh relationship where there's an unbelieving spouse and my husband uh wants to go to a church that i don't want to go to and he says well you're a christian go to church with your husband right he says go he says be salty and he talks about criticism and opposition and maybe going to other churches and in this context he's saying when he says be salty he's not saying well you should just be annoyed you should be jumping salty at your husband suddenly unexpectedly angry on sunday morning says honey let's go to church he's saying no you ought to be salty in the sense that jesus was saying that this is in a positive way this is in a seasoning way this is in making somebody thirsty i'm like wow maybe there's more to this belief more to their conviction than just this is the right church and this is the only doctrine and this is the truth in my eyes maybe there is a real life behind this and he's using kind of this phrasing of be salty here's one particular instance it's question 417. i have a friend who i love very much she's had some tapes and letters that i believe that have uh that have that i believe and it's kind of a fragment never talk to her so the way it kind of reads is she knows she's had some tapes and letters of what i believe but i've never talked to her mate really i guess i'm afraid of destroying her and losing her as a friend friendship what should i do and so here's somebody who that believes the message somebody else who doesn't believe the message how how do i navigate this because i don't want to destroy my friendship and brother brahms answer is well if you're not willing to destroy all your relationships for this message then you don't really believe the message and so i think it's really instructive so musicians if you could come i want you to chew on that uh no his answer is speak to her in love it's not like well any friendship that won't survive your testimony of this message isn't a friendship word of heaven he says speak during love and he says i believe i answered that and i think this is the last question he answers yes it's the last one reference where he talks about being salty so he says i believe i answered that yeah for the last uh three other services he had used this kind of language to express to someone who's in this difficult interpersonal relationship differences in beliefs and difference in actions and even one wife was being real aggressive to the husband well you don't even practice what you preach and he said well if you're not practicing what you preach maybe you deserve it it says but if she's maybe she's not that kind of person where she's mean he says i don't know he says but just be salty and so his answer is i believe i answer that but don't try to push anything on anybody i i want to go into it hopefully wednesday night on this use of force to accomplish things he says don't try to push anything on anybody just be salty just be salty they'll long to be like you remember jesus stood at the door and not the one who can just knock the door down do whatever he wants he knocked and so that we would permit and consent so he says don't try to push anything on anybody just be salty the long to be like you be salty be influential exert an influence be powerful but not too salty be salty but not too salty in other words don't uh don't get aggressive don't get pushy don't become overbearing there has to be this right balance and if people who cook will find this that something without salt you can immediately know something with too much salt you immediately know something with just the right kind of balance you won't even comment on it because what happens and you're like it's a little salty but maybe not too much but probably just a little bit past the line and so there is a there's this and i'm just using salt as another way of thinking about this line between a positive pride and a negative pride this perverse arrogant arrogance that you can carry and there is what is called a salt paradox um there is a lot of scholarship and research on it scientifically especially when it relates to nutrition and health and i'll just i'll just summarize it for you there's two different schools of thought we've heard a lot of it for many many years salt is bad get it out of your diet you're gonna die and then there's a lot of other research that comes around and says you know what that was a little bit misguided and so it's just like with msg i'm sure we're gonna find out that the lack of msg is the reason why kovid prevailed so much or something odd like that they're just going to come back around on you know what trans fat get as much as you can and oh okay so i can have olean chips again great um there's so many different things uh that back and forth within these uh academics but there's a lot of scholarship and research it's very pointed uh factually based and there's a lot of harmony accord that they're finding in their research and so i'll just summarize it for you you ready too much salt in your diet you can die not enough salt in your diet you can die right kind of similar to what happens when you have a funny pain and you want to google it let me just tell you what the final answer is you have cancer and you're going to die so don't even google it it's not even worth it no matter what it is that's weird my elbow hurts you have cancer and you're going to die and so when it comes to the salt paradox too much salt in your diet detrimental to health it could cause you to die but not enough salt because you're like salt's going to kill me i don't want any salt but hold on no not too far because if you don't have enough you're going to die and so it's assault paradox reminds me of pride too much pride you're going to fall not enough pride you'll never stand too much pride headed for destruction not enough pride you'll never recover from calamity you never overcome difficulty too much pride you'll never respect boundaries not enough pride you'll never defend boundaries too much pride every every every boundary's a barrier you're just gonna kick it down disrespect it and then throw barriers up in other people's way who are trying to possess their boundaries and and and there's so there's this give and take a healthy pride you're going to set your own boundaries you can defend your set your boundaries defend your boundaries and with the right kind of pride and healthy pride just the right amount of pride you're going to be have this uh ambition to overcome barriers instead of oh it's in my way i don't know what i'm going to do you this the kind of perseverance that grit the determination for the brandon identifies to be persistent that that's the kind of confidence i believe in what i'm doing i believe there's fruits and the results and i'm going to press through this i'm going to overcome it and so too much pride you're going to fall not enough pride you'll never walk in the place that you want to brother man says salt is the savor if it contacts there has to be contact you just be salty the world will get thirsty god give us men and women who are real men and women who stand gallantly to stand gallantly uh maybe put another way shoulders back chin up confidently and there's there's this idea of not uh of not somebody gloating and sticking their nose up and looking down on everybody else but somebody who's got some confidence in who they are and what god's calling them to be and we touched on it just briefly and making comments that when the bible says the meek shall inherit the earth and we think in terms of meekness that this is just people who are broken and impoverished and have nothing going for them or their pushovers and they never want to say anything and they always give up in a fight and they always run away when accosted and never willing to uh confront anything and can't handle contention and there's a way that we just describe meek people as weak people but the true idea of meekness is to have the power to force but not use it i mean that's what meekness means it just means like hey i could if i want to but i won't and that's the beautiful part of the meek someone who has and think of it this way in the language that jesus is using the meek are those who if they wanted to by force could take the earth and since they don't they'll inherit the earth you can take it by force you can take about opportunity and privilege you can do it by power but instead of doing it that way you'll inherit it the right way it's accomplishing the right thing the right way and so in the message it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness the other man says and after you've made a confession you must stay with your confession that's right it's behooving you becoming as a christian as a believer to stay with your conviction don't let the devil push you off here and there they said listen a christian who stands gallantly salt has a characteristic it's something that's strong and something that perseveres and something that can uh hold things at bay in terms of its uh power to preserve and keep corruption from setting in you have a position to call him to hold things off to fend things off he says don't let the devil push you off here and there you're always mudded up you're always off the main road don't let people do this to you don't let circumstance do this to you don't let um others the devil do this to you says you're always in and out that's the way you can't stay nowhere that's the reason why you can't it's because you're being pushed over you're being tossed to and fro you're not standing by your conviction you're not standing galilee you're not being salty in a gallant way you're you're not holding this meekness and it's truth he says you can't have confidence in yourself interesting we can have a look we can have a fun discussion at lunch if we just want to cabbage down on one statement you should have no confidence in the flesh right like okay that's our marching orders and then all of a sudden other scriptures and statements start coming up hmm okay what does that mean then what do we do with this and so so this idea of being confident in yourself yeah there's a real nastiness to it right there's a real uh there's a real negativity that can be associated with it but remember that scarecrows are used to keep crows away from good stuff it's used to cause fear and listen if i could say this i've alluded to it there are so many beautiful truths about the opening of the word the third pool the seventh seal the seven thunders the open the revealing of the mysteries the things that have transpired in this message and the devil has been really good at getting a lot of scarecrows to run out and take the lead on what all those things are and what they mean and a lot of bad characteristics and conduct associated with it so some people like you know what i don't even want to mess with it because look at all the nonsense that's associated with it and that's scaring you away from these beautiful things that have happened in the word of god and that are available to us as the members of the bride and so we can have such a negative connotation about confidence and we're like well i don't have any confidence in anything or anyone it's like well there is a right way that you can have confidence he says you can't have confidence in yourself so just know there's a healthy way to do that or no one can have confidence in you he says you've got to stand and when you've done all you can do to stand this illusion to ephesians 6 then stand just keep on standing something beautiful about knowing your worth not inflating or overestimating what you're worth but knowing your true value paul was we've emphasized this in a lot of different ways especially over the last in this subject of barriers and boundaries that i need to understand the measure of faith that has been given to me because i have one in any measure is worth value right think of it it's it you we say oh well jesus had it without measure we have it by measure that in no way was meant to limit you it's just to understand dispensation it's to understand uh expression and manifestation it's not to take away from you anything it's you have to recognize no know yourself recognize yourself jesus was who he was not because of circumstances and rumors and because he didn't have anything but jesus knew perfectly who he was and that's what caused him to overcome and how did he overcome by the word and humility so in this you can't have confidence yourself and no one can have confidence in you you've got to take care of yourself think of yourself in the right way and know your value know your work take care of yourself and think of yourself as someone who has the responsibility of caring for someone else and thinking about your thinking about their needs because it's like what the bible says the bible says look not upon your own needs but the needs of others so it's kind of making us realize i need to think of myself the right way and regard the value that i have because i've been given the responsibility to look on the needs of others right so i i need to i need to draw from this this resource of scripture that so beautifully lays out and we recognize it even we say well let this mind be in you it's this mind of christ that we begin to take on and accept an assent to and receive and let to let it loose in our lives is from this position of acceptance and belonging and oneness with the father and i know my value i'm taking care of myself i'm thinking the right way about myself and with this healthy opinion of myself i realize i'm going to think of myself as one who's been given the responsibility to look on the needs of others because why why would we be called to to look upon the needs of others and to bear one another's burdens if you haven't been gifted to do it if you're not going to be given the op the power and opportunity to do it so you start changing i'm not just somebody who's got nothing to add and i'm just looking for an opportunity to kind of trick everybody right you're not an imposter hanging out in the hospital pretending to be a doctor just waiting for the chance to practice your your wares on an unsuspecting patient you've got the goods you've got the calling it's something inside of us and however that strikes home to you we've got to start thinking about ourselves the right way in living the right way is one who god wants to use for the right things now i realize had i just maybe expressed and shared a little bit more on salt we could have just been finished and gone to an early lunch but i wanted this is uh the we're moving from the thought of the pride paradox now into setting limits it's very important though to have this fresh in our minds these things here i just expressed here are going to come back around as we move on this morning setting limits setting limits is um what i'd like to do by the word of god and especially drawn so much from the message of the hour it's so beautiful people want to take brother branham as just some sort of paint tote carry backwoods you know kentuckian you know who uh wasn't very graceful or educated or well studied all right fine listen what he had to say so profoundly beautiful and relevant so deep so instructive touching on every element he's not approaching these things academically he's not approaching these things with psychology he's approaching from the word of god and it has the answer to every human behavior every human thought and idea so we're wanting to take the word of god and address myths regarding christian virtues there's myths about christian virtues that actually are counterproductive to christian virtue there's ways that we approach church that's counterproductive to what church ought to be there's myths even about personal liberty that are counterproductive to personal liberty there's a way that we want to define personal liberty in such a way where it takes away our liberty and so i want to uh as we've been saying fi tapping into the the the boundless love of god and the limitless power of god by identifying the boundaries of god yes it's a paradox but we have we can only fully understand and appreciate personal liberty when we recognize personal limitations and experience the richness of the relationships that god has placed in us in when we recognize our limitations and respect the limitations of others so there's just so much in this that i feel overwhelmed that i'm looking at something and i'm looking at all this all these things that are just being quickened to me from the word of god and then i only have just a moment to try to describe you what i'm seeing and so if you could be very patient with me this is just one you're just getting one slice and there's so much that you could the word of god can things the holy spirit can bring into view to make it a perfect picture so if something seems i don't know you just let god bring the rest into the view make it relevant for you and i have been very very burdened heavily on this subject to the point to where i wrestled with uh the simplicity of it and how easy it might be for someone to kind of escape just how pertinent it is to the bride's ministry and how pertinent it is to the bride's advocacy and how pertinent it is to understanding and walking fully in the oneness that we're to have with the word and so one thing that has been very real to me in the commission that god gave me in coming here uh very direct very scriptural a very distinct my wife and i are very clear in the vision that god has given us in coming here and i recognize that the things that i'm ministering are necessary in order to heal us necessary to set us free and there are so many different negative experiences that some of us have had there's so many i'm not saying this is for everybody so i'm not trying to put something on you oh he says i need healing oh he says i need to be free i'm not saying that about any all of us just as a need that god wants to meet there's been so much an abuse and bondage uh that many of us have experienced and negative dynamic mechanics and even dynamics in churches that have warped our experiences and so we're even not even we're not even conscious anymore of the of of how we really relate to one another and how we look at church and ministry and the word of god we're not even we're not even viewing the message the right way because so much of it begins to take on this veneer and this facade of humanity and personality and so much emphasis is are on natural things and personal things and politics we're never really getting past the human part and getting into the divine part and the christ part and and we're not even recognizing that that's what we're relating to and that's what's really binding our experiences and holding all of us together and there's a lot of things that we go through that then maybe some people get a little bit more aware of that like oh my goodness look this is what it is it's human it's political there's so much pretense there's so much that's wrong and they're turned off by it because now what that what they're finally recognizing and perceiving is the hypocrisy of it and the and how this principle is contrary to this one and this behavior is hypocritical and inconsistent with this teaching and so what they begin to do is their perception begins to get warped and they're like you know what there's nothing to this because they think what they're seeing is what it is but they're not really seeing it and the bible christianity this message has been weaponized to cage people it has been weaponized to to bind people by fear and control and people are holding to things and fearful of doing things and fearful of expressing something or overcoming or making a decision and they're bound and they think that oh well this is this is right to to uh kind of bind to myself this is right to limit myself this is right to be controlled and to beat my body and hold myself into subjection and what you're operating is under these negative dynamics instead of operating under faith because at the root and at the core christianity is believing god's word it's trust it's faithfulness it's it's this uh an unwavering commitment to the to jesus christ that's what faith is and all these other things begin to muddy up the water and we find ourselves living in this tension between denial and desire and i'm not talking about this this tension of well i really desire um a joint right now but i'm going to deny myself the joint there's this there's this um dynamic i just uh modality or way of thinking a way of processing things a way of acting to where it fits and i'm just really i just find i'm so encouraged by the the the liberty by your your openness today and you're just pulling the word of god i can just i can just speak freely and i love this that we we take this idea of and i'm coming right to it in in luke chapter six and uh mark chapter eight wanting to come back to that so this is just beautiful kind of setting this up we've experienced like the proper application of denying an evil desire of of desiring something evil and then by conviction by faith denying it and so is we have that we have that uh that experience and we recognize that process that there's things that you can be tempted by and i have to say no to it and we see that in the word of god and we've experienced it but then we take that same instinct and it can be used against us when we have a righteous desire and a righteous leading of god and we find ourselves denying it because we've just that's what we're used to we're just used to the pastor telling us what to do we're just used to being told this is the only church that's got the truth we've been told that if you leave you won't have this we've been told that if you believe something else then you don't believe the message and we have and there's just a lot i can keep going on and on and on in all other ways that we find ourselves limiting our growth in the word of god and but we i i'm longing for more i sense that there's got to be something more to this and i feel that god is leading into more beautiful areas into the message of god and the word is opening up to me but all of a sudden you find yourself being told just deny yourself we've seen where that's gone or we just deny yourself you just need to stick with this just deny yourself because you're going out on a limb and we live in that tension and there is a if i could find myself again in the salt paradox and the pride paradox there's a tension paradox too much is a bad thing not enough is a bad thing but brother lucas did a um a youth meeting on stress it was very beautiful to identify and he used some natural examples of how important it is to have certain tension in certain stressors you've got to have that but then there's a there's a tipping point to that and we don't want to walk forward in the word of god and god is wanting to lead us into greater things and we have a desire but then we begin to repress that and hold it back is that something that's uh you can understand and relate to now in luke chapter 6 and i'm going to go ahead and read verses 27 to 36 we've already looked at verses 41 and 42 but i say unto you which here love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and sorry let's just how do we all envision that right boom and you're kind of like i think you need to get this one too right that's the way that's the way it sounds so he says and take and him that take away thy cloak forbid him not to take thy coat also give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again he says give and lend without expecting anything in return and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise i want to touch on this later but the reason why we allow others to treat ourselves poorly is because we treat ourselves so poorly there's there's there's a lot there and so it says as you would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise do unto others as you would have them do unto you and sometimes we're acting towards others in a way that we do to ourselves right for if you love them which love you what thank have you and i i find for time's sake i just want to i want to skip to verse 35 he's saying there's got to be a higher character that we operate by because the world will appreciate those who appreciate them and the world will be happy to give to somebody who's going to give in return and the world can easily love somebody who loves them but where's the divinity where's the deity where's the christ it says but love your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and you shall be the children of the highest as we mentioned before this similar way be therefore perfect be merciful as your father is merciful now with this image in mind of love your enemies jesus is teaching on how we treat others and and and so we ought to treat others the right way do as you would that men should do to you and what you think you deserve and what you think is right and appropriate for yourself do that to other people so you recognize how damaging it would be if you don't have the proper opinion of self right then how can you have a proper opinion of other people well i think it's fine if people violate my piece so it's going to violate your peace right so there's a real richness to this and because we all we automatically think oh wouldn't you want a million dollars so give a million dollars to somebody else and you know do unto others as you would have them duty to praise you and lift you up and encourage you and and we think of it only in the positive sense but you realize there's a darkness to this that that whether if you think this way you've got to you've got to have a uh you got to break out of this negative mindset and as we look at these things you strike you on the cheek turn the other one if someone takes sushi for your cloak give them your coat also we can read this to mean you have to stay very very close to me it's 11 17. i'll tell you the time so you don't have to look you don't have to get all you know uh i can just tell you it's 11 17. uh don't ask me what time it is um if you need to know maybe you can just pull on that gift and i'll tell you future but it's 11 17. we could read this you have to be very very careful here we could read this to mean that we must welcome all offenses that we should just be willing to give everything away and expect nothing in return that jesus oh well just you know i should i can let you borrow money brother aaron can i borrow 100 bucks and that i should just be fine and happy if i promise i'll pay you back be happy if you never pay me back and there's a way that we begin to process this we're just oh we've got to be fine with being the doormat i got to be fine with being taken advantage of and that we therefore offer ourselves to be trodden under the foot of man that we that we ought to just put ourselves in position to always be taken advantage of because this is what christians do and and isn't it amazing how you're always the christian that has to take the high road not the other christian you're talking to well why don't you just humble yourself and forgive it's like okay are you am i the only christian in this conversation i told my wife one time she was dealing with somebody and this is somebody you know twice her age and she got off the phone i said honey you were the adult in that conversation you're the only adult in that conversation and uh and just to that point of what we expect i remember one time i was i had a client who had a particular need that they needed some representation on and it was just kind of a new relationship and it was a student from a seminary there's a number of uh students from the seminar that would do these real estate deals and uh they needed some representation and so we talked about it was gonna be and we're talking about what needed to be done and so it's time for me to tell what my fee would be and he said also remember he said i'm a christian he knew i was a christian who has a ministry says so i'm a christian so you know adjust accordingly and i just said praise god praise god i'm so glad to finally have a brother who's willing to pay me more for my services since i'm a christian for too many people it's a one-way street we know that christian characters consider it we know that christian character is compassionate but we also know that there's boundaries to christian character and it's always the word of god as i've been studied on love uh love is not what you think it is if god is love and god is his word then love has to operate strictly within the parameters of the word of god and it's not it doesn't adjust itself to what's sappy and syrupy and what's all warm fuzzy when he says love your enemies it doesn't mean like oh isn't he just i just want to pinch his cheeks it's not a warm fuzzy feeling when you love your enemies right but we think that's what it means you got to really have a warm fuzzy feeling about the people who hate you and we're like not gonna happen right never gonna have a warm fuzzy feeling about some people but i gotta love them right so maybe love's not what we think it is contrary to dc talk love isn't a verb always it's not the verb they're thinking about i don't know what they're thinking about the christian character is forgiving self-sacrificing these are the truths of the word of god this is the red letter this is what paul taught but yet there's there's a question i want to pose in light of luke chapter six are there boundaries of safe boundaries for a christian is jesus just kind of saying hey here you go be rip to shreds taking advantage of whatever they want to do to you just let them do do because that's what christians do let me ask you this are there limits or parameters within is there a better way of understanding luke chapter six and the things that are being said here and even the beatitudes and these things that jesus is listening who we just don't take this far extreme without any kind of limit without any context or understanding just like well you're a christian you should just allow yourself to be taken advantage of and so you just have to subject yourself to abuse and torment and negativity and harshness and ridicule and and all sorts of things that are damaging to your faith right but you just have to go you just have to do it in mark chapter 8 verses 34 and 35 we use this wednesday night and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said to them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me i love how himself yourself is is united with the cross and that's where we find ourselves in union with christ the cross for whosoever will save his life shall lose it so immediately again think well whoever's trying to preserve themselves and save their lives and and protect it is going to lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it so it's not just a matter of losing yourself and letting yourself go and not caring and being abased at every opportunity and subjecting yourself to whatever happens in the whims of people and the evils that can be perpetuated and say well i'm not going to protect myself because if i try to save my life i try to protect myself i try to protect my spirit and set up my defenses then i'm just going to lose it but he says if you will then lose your life for the gospel sake and for the sake of christ so there's a way that he wants you to abandon things there's context for it there's a boundary for the losing of your life he says it's go that's going to be saved and this self-denial this denial of self he talked about and i didn't mean to get into it because it's a subject in itself the tension between desire and denial the self-denial that jesus mentions let him deny himself he joins it with individual choice you recognize that let him deny himself and take up his cross it's his cross so the denial of self to let him deny himself has a richer meaning than just some sort of well i've got nothing i've got no choice i'm not my own anymore uh there's no autonomy here he's saying let him deny himself and he joins it with the individual choice to take up your personal cross so there's still some recognition of self there's some denying of yourself but then there's also some deeper understanding that i have a burden i have a task i have a responsibility and i'm going to take up this cross and take up this cross my responsibility my task my burden my boundaries my who i am i'm going to deny myself anything that would be a barrier to following christ any ambition any idea any nature and nurture contrary to what he's called me to do but i still have a choice a personal choice to take up my cross and follow him and therein lies your true identity and self-denial is a dot not a doctrine of self-hatred there's this thing this i know that we're not living in the uh the mental ages is that what we called it uh the medieval ages uh the middle ages and the times where there was like this uh even as luther wrestled with his sins he inflicted upon himself in his penance physical pain and and i just used luther as an example because it's one personal testimony i've read but then this ah there's the self beating and and and causing pain and inflicting says why it's this in this sense of i i need to feel i need to express repentance i need to show remorse i need to express just how horrible i am and and foul i am and we may have moved beyond the physical flogging or the the making myself physically uncomfortable but they're still like the ghost and the shadow of self-denial and christianity has to do with self-hatred and it's a lie it's an absolute line to deny yourself and to take up a cross is not to consent to abuse well jesus is telling love your enemies do good to those that despite that hate you and bless them that curse you and pray for them to despitefully use you this is not a a an invitation to be taken advantage of like we're singing you know you know jesus i'm available to you and to everyone else you can take advantage of me you know it's not we don't we're not singing a chorus to the world like hey i've signed up for yeah go ahead take it you want my money here's my money you want my car here's my keys it's not it's just a little bit of an imbalance and if if it seems like maybe i push too far in the one side from being kind of extreme that's just maybe my personality but i do it to make a point that maybe you could just back up a little bit like yeah he's kind of pushing it real aggressive on that end but you know what this has there's a there's a real applicable point here in matthew chapter 10 verse 16 he says behold i send you forth the sheep in the midst of wolves thanks thanks you're sending me out i'm as a sheep in the midst of wolves i think i preached a graduation a banquet one time called behold the wolves or it was a you know like here they are let me introduce you to the wolves behold i send you forth a sheep in the midst of wolves be therefore wise as serpents and harmlesses doves now this is teaching of jesus christ he's telling us you are going out as sheep in the midst of wolves what the wolves want to do want to eat the sheep rip them up tear them limb to limb and jesus says therefore offer your limbs to the wolves they may rend you and rip you apart and destroy you and take away your life because if we misinterpret luke chapter 6 matthew chapter 5 we might just say well as sheep we just we just yield to whatever happens whatever comes we can't defend ourselves we can't do anything against it but he says to be wise as serpents the words exercise prudence concerning your own safety i'm gonna send you out it's gonna be peril it's gonna be difficult it'll be a lot of tension a lot of rebukes a lot of chastising a lot of difficult circumstances but be very prudent and wise concerning your own safety i'd be very cautious to avoid harm because the why the wisdom of a serpent is quickly can evade a danger but then also be harmless as dubs it speaks of an innocence that a dove is not going to provoke injury a dove is not going to act in a way that invites harm right the tenderness the meekness of a dove it it it quickly itself is going to be alarmed in more of a tender meek way maybe not in the the the serpent's way of evading and disguising itself and blending in with its area or setting up its defenses to warn a dove is very meek and uh and harmless as he says be harmless as doves doves in their inability to offend you ought to be the same way in other words you want to be wise as a serpent to avoid harm but also don't be so bold and brash to invite it be innocent of evil it's a combination of unflinching zeal but then calm discretion an amazing combination of attributes it's another paradox per se the wisdom of a serpent would save them from the unnecessary unnecessary exposure to danger if you're wise as a serpent you're not just inviting harm you're just not inviting yourself to be trampled over your head cut off and to be abused you he says this to be wise as a serpent you're going to be cautious and avoid danger but to be harmless as a dove would allow them to escape the kind of conduct that brings harm and escape sinful conduct that's hurtful interest to themselves or even to others avoid the conflict and danger he's saying be harm you're going to be sheep in the midst of wolves this is dangerous this is precarious you ought to be you have to be aware that there's forces and because of your nature and because of how god's called you're considerate you're self-sacrificing uh you you're you're you're denying yourself you're taking up a cross you're compassionate you're forgiving uh you're willing to serve you're all these things you're willing to humble yourself you're the one that is willing to get beneath somebody else because of these things and this nature and these essential qualities of the holy spirit he's saying i send you forth and it's going to be dangerous so be wise as a serpent a harmless as a dove in other words avoid conflict and danger and don't return it if you're unable to avoid it so it's it's part and parcel it comes together avoid conflict be wise as serpents and harmless as doves avoid it if you can but if you come into conflict don't return it therefore i want to come back to luke chapter 6 verses 29 to him that smites you on the cheek offer him the other also turning your cheek doesn't mean you offer the cheek that hasn't been slapped up to be slapped right i mean if you don't see it that way i'm not going to ask you to say amen but and when you think very deeply about this and what christ is trying to say is that if somebody slaps you in the face is it's literally not telling them that you've got to let them slap you on the other side of your face to even out the burn or the red mark it's not to invite the slap again but not to slap back right you can't you can't slap back and then ask why did they slap right you just say why how can you slap right this is what jesus is saying in matthew chapter 5 verse 39 but i say unto you listen to how he says it that you resent not evil resist not evil that you resist not evil now this has been taken into non-resistance of violence and to some extremes towards like you can't you can't do anything if somebody shows up at your door and demands your stuff you can't take do anything to defend yourself against it it's a very interesting doctrine in theology and i've written read some of the books on it a part portions of it and one in particular he says you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also so when he uses this illusion of being smitten on the right cheek it's not so much that someone is is going to shoot you and they kind of miss and just kind of catch you in the shoulder oh were you aiming for the heart it's right here it's right here i know you missed but just get me right you want to get closer maybe you're not a good aim it's talking about within relationships somebody does something to demean you hurt you offend you humiliate you and jesus is talking about forgiveness says if you get smile if someone smites you on one cheek offer also the other it's a it's a language to suggest forgiveness and he's talking about responding the right way after personal defense he's talking about about not not acting out what would be you have to actually not act you have to act against instinct if someone punches you your instinct is to punch back and so it's very beautiful that he would uh use it in this context because when someone hurts you what our instinct is to hurt back you've hurt me so i want to hurt you back you've said something rude i want to say something rude back. and so he's jesus is talking about not returning the same conduct out of spite not returning the same conduct out of vengeance that if someone smites you in a way to humility you embarrass you to cause a personal offense he's saying i know that it would be very easy for you to offend and return but you can't do that and i want to go into this deeper with using the message of the hour maybe it'll be wednesday night but i want to i want you to pause on that thought that there that when it says that if someone hits you just let them hit you again is not what he means if someone hits you don't hit back i'll tell you right now that if you find yourself hitting back take notice something's not right you're not who you are anymore that's not you you're in a situation you're hitting back something's got to change you're not operating anymore by the character of christ like lord what have i become what am i doing this is not in the nature of the word of god this isn't how i believe i'm acting out what happens to people and i guess this is getting into what i'm wanting to come to you know people who hate something so much they can become it so you have to recognize that fine line what have what it means to turn the other cheek and and so with that that principle and that idea and i want to revisit it i want you to consider the following when pondering this pondering whether the word authorizes us and gives us the liberty give us the power but then also the permission the approval to set limits using luke chapter six kind of like well look what it says right this is what this is what it says you're a christian you ought to do this you ought to do that um after all we're christians right we should be able to treat each other however we want we've kind of take this we're christians we love one another uh not only should we chew one another's chewing gum but you also should be able to put up whatever whatever i spit in your face right it's kind of the idea that we begin to characterize of when it comes to uh christian character christian virtue and personal autonomy and liberty but consider this and just thinking about whether or not the word establishes limits in relationships in hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us we got to run our own race and he's addressing barriers to the finish line so he says let us lay aside every weight it's 11 35 for the person who's wanting to know let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us you're operating the gift appreciate it let us lay aside every weight and the sin which death so easily beset us this besetting weight which is a burden an encumbrance a barrier this be said in weight or sin it means an offense something that could even cause you to stumble to be setting weight a burden an encumbrance or sin a besetting sin we're to lay aside these so i ask you are you conscious of the things it calls it besetting that something that envelops or surrounds or wraps you up are we conscious of the things that press against us the things that cause pressure the things that are kind of pushing us to act against who we really are the things that are kind of it's besetting in that it's it's it's hindering me it's enveloping me it's changing the way i think the way i act and my instincts and i'm really a serving person and really i'm a caring person and really i'm sensitive and really i love and i want to fellowship and really i have this desire but what's causing me the self-denial the self-hatred what's enveloping me and pressing me are we are we conscious of those things because disrespect can be a barrier to bearing your own burdens let's lay aside the weight of sin what so even if you said us let us run with patience the race that set before us what is causing you to lose your patience in other words what's frustrating you take a step back what is causing you to lose it what's causing you frustration what's causing you to no longer be patient and ask yourself maybe i don't need that test and that's why i keep failing and it's more of an idea of walk away let it go i said i'm going to sit here until i can just be patient with it it's it's really a beautiful picture if you can let the lord speak to your heart abuse manipulation control these different personal attacks that we may experience and i'm maybe using really supercharged uh language just to describe conflict in our daily relationships and responsibilities within marriage and raising our children and things at work and things in church and even our relationship with the lord there's a lot of things that can be a barrier to us being able to bear our burdens things that stumble us things that block us and we know as it's emphasized rightly over and over and over again there's some personal weight some personal sins that we must lay down lay aside the weight lay aside the sin lay aside the personally the personal weights the person will be setting sin lay aside all these barriers and all these encumbrances every man must bear his own burden so find the burdens that are yours and unload everything that you ought not to be carrying there are personal things that we must lay down but then there's also weights and sins that we must avoid there's some that are yours it's this is your responsibility this is your problem lay it down but then there's others that we ought not to willingly accept and invite because they become besetting sins or besetting weights that are holding us back and we ought to learn to avoid them things that rob us of our peace things that still are joy things that disturb our mind if you peace is gone your joy is gone uh your stability safety everything is compromised then a boundary is being violated somewhere you've either stepped beyond protection or something's got within your spirit and is in his defiling it and you have to recognize wait a minute this is not how a christian ought to feel this is how i i should not be made to feel this way in relationships if you're feeling a certain way and you don't feel safe there has to be a way to communicate that and hopefully the person is making you feel that way oh i'm sorry i didn't realize i was doing that and what respect that and isn't it horrible that churches anymore have become what they become places where you come here and the sword's just going to be exercised on you this is the judgment see you're in the judgment house i hope you brought your band-aids and your stitch kits and everything because you're going to get slaughtered this morning and some people just actually take the motto that you should come to church and your goal is to afflict the comforted and comfort of the afflicted it's like well that's your job then you better bring it all around in the end because everybody's afflicted you might as well comfort us and that's what relationships become beating down and tearing up and destroying i said if you feel if you don't feel welcome maybe you're not welcome right if you don't feel maybe maybe you're in the wrong spot in other words there's got to be some acknowledge understanding that some boundaries being violated if i feel this way paul's paul's referencing it verse 14 to the same chapter to 15. follow peace with all men that's the goal is to follow peace that that there would not be contention that there would not be strife there would not be war in in acrimony follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord whoo that escalated quickly looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god we must look diligently in this lest we are failing of the grace of god experiencing his grace lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled listen to your emotions as they talk to you a root of bitterness one of the most damaging things to a relationship is resentment and we begin to experience that resentment the contempt i think even in in some ways it's described this that when people come to the stage in a relationship where they're they're contentious they just resent the things that are done that that's a terrible marker if you've you've come into one of the most the worst dynamics of a relationship when you resent and it's amazing how some people will continue to subject themselves to an atmosphere that only creates resentment instead of trying to work out what how did we cross this line where now no matter what this person does even if they're sincere or right you resent it 11 40. if somebody's getting uncomfortable what time is it they're running analytics right now in the duration of my prior 140 services or whatever like what time are we nearing the metric now where should i use my timeout should i go for two what does the sheet say well my sheet tells me i'm doing good hebrews chapter 12 verse 14 15 is where we're at lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled you have to recognize when you're being defiled when you when there's this bitterness something's wrestling you follow peace with all men if you can't have peace you're not always obligated to welcome contention you can't have peace you're not always welcome to you don't have to invite that circumstance if you can't have peace this is important you don't have to invite the contention the fighting the attack but what is it that's often said but we're family right it's like this is what families do we fight in the backyard and it's like you know what we don't even have a front yard like we spend our whole lives in the backyard right it's like you might as well just say where are you the backyard car's the backyard church is the backyard the restaurant's the backyard because this is what we fight in the backyard it's like i found a new name for earth the backyard but we're christians you're my brother you're my sister i had a man tell me one time a brother tell me one time at the time i didn't think he'd be a brother so i really wanted to invite him to do it but he said like this brother here i want to punch him in the face but i can't because he's my brother and at the time i was like you're not my brother take a swing and uh but we they kind of have this attitude that if your family or church or whatever all's fair in love and war sorry uh-uh that's not how it works romans chapter 12 verses 17 to 21 recompense to no man evil for evil this is what jesus said it says resist not evil and turn the other cheek your natural instinct is to hit back right i remember one time my sister told me she said you need to pop that zit and i just said well you need to lose some weight whoa if you get anything out of service today don't ever say that all right if you just haven't been there at all 11 43 you haven't been in you know you're finally tuning in hey take that home as like real gold don't ever say that and just have the rule to say don't say that to anybody that way you don't get in the habit of always saying it to your buddies and you don't accidentally say it to anybody else your wife your sister your mom just somebody at the store if they offend you don't try to offend them back but hey what are we we're in the we're in the uh a rap battle era right if somebody uh releases a diss track on you you are obligated to release one as well right and i think i sometimes i don't know if i've ever shared this but some people tell me you know i stream so-and-so services i'm like oh that's awesome and i string so-and-so services and i'm like oh well how's that tennis match going right i mean they're just playing tennis with each other somebody preaches you know one plus one equals two this brother's preaching against math and it's like you know they're just kind of cueing off one another anyways recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as lieth in you as much as was within your power as much as you are able if it be possible i love how much grace is expressed here if it be possible as much as life is within your responsibility as much as you have power over the situation to affect it live peaceably with all men recognize he's not saying that you are with a contentious uh angry violent mob and you've got to live peaceably in the midst of it he said as much as it's within your power to create peace and harmonize then do it if it be possible as much as you are able it's within your control live peaceably with all men why we must follow peace with all men wrote it to the hebrews in chapter 12. now the romans in chapter 12 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves in other words if you can't live in peace if there's contention if there's fighting if there's acrimony if there's offenses things being lobbed your way and criticisms and there's violations and things done that are not right and is that might be really uh aggravating language even in this in the smaller things if there's just little things that kind of poke at you and prod you and you don't appreciate then let's not get in the cycle of returning and kind even in the small little petty things that can happen in relationships and where well they did this to me so i'll do this they'll do that to you there's a way of responding where you don't need to avenge yourself there's a way that you can de-escalate he says but rather give place unto wrath i like that for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord so you got to let the lord do it let the lord deal with somebody therefore find enemy hunger feed him if he thirsts give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head just don't tell him that's what you're doing while you're doing it hope you enjoy the hot coals no i asked for coffee be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good i would say this is our goal right love your enemies therefore that enemy hunger feed them thirst give them a drink this is our goal this is what we want well i want to come to a place where my spirit is free i want to come to a place where i'm not bitter i'm not resentful i want to come to a place where if i found that my enemy needed something i would be willing to give it to him that's the goal don't do be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good the word in no place ever empowers the believer the christian to treat others with contempt i challenged you last week who do you look down on who is it we look down upon and someone say the devil say all right that's scriptural we will look down upon him one day i'm like this is the thing that bothered me all right you got me but in this room is there somebody you look down on there's a there's an attitude where we have to realize there's just there's not place given in the scripture where we ought to treat others with scorn we're not authorized to mock or belittle anybody and the word does not so the word does not empower us to mistreat others and the word does not exempt christians from accountability for how they treat others amen we are not exempt from the accountability for how we treat others so accordingly as christians we have a duty to set limits in order to protect our hearts and ultimately hopefully hold other people accountable and i've run out of time so i'm going to stop or i'm going to jump to the end i'll come back to it but i'll say this we have the full authority of god to set boundaries to establish protective boundaries for ourselves for our family we're fully authorized to do it and therefore if you could take what little i've shared and some of the things i'm leaving off now it's a warning because hopefully that in one way what i'm addressing would some people somebody take this as you know what i have to set limits but hopefully it's also instructing others as a warning to not bypass or violate boundaries yeah there's a conduct then that i can engage in where i'm the enemy i'm the cheek smiter i'm the one grabbing the cloak and taking the coat like there's a way that you've got to begin to recognize that there is a possibility according to human behavior and influence that maybe i'm the one that's breaking that's passing boundaries maybe i'm the one that's being insensitive maybe i'm the one that's engaged in hurtful conduct and therefore i realize oh my i need to be sure that i'm not doing this anymore and so much about this subject of barriers and boundaries is about demonstrating to others what is right what is right for their correction and for their instruction that if you constantly allow somebody to always violate a boundary you're enabling them to continue to be boundary violators and some people raise their children constantly violating their children's boundaries and they're all shocked and hot under the sports caller when their children violate everyone else's boundaries in adulthood it's because you never established that a child can say no that a child has a right to certain things and they think the whole world is about being told what to do and whoever's the strongest survival of the fittest and so there's a way that we must act to establish certain things and to regard certain things so that it's instructed to those who are repetitive in their bad behaviors oh my i do want to close i will say that as a as a positive confession i would like to end this but so many ways the way that we we shriek back and we don't stand for ourselves and we don't say and do the right things it's just constantly enabling the person i was sharing this with my wife in conversation that if somebody asked you to do something if it's not appropriate to ask tell them kids you're like oh you know what i just don't have time tomorrow oh what about the next day well you know i just you know we got then what about the next day right because they see it as a barrier oh it's fine this is just a barrier let's work on the barrier and you haven't articulated to them i feel like if i express this we could just end the series you haven't articulated to him wait a minute i'm sorry that's a that's something you don't cross that's disrespectful you don't talk to somebody that way or that's you don't you don't approach it that way or that's not right that's not appropriate and you establish you don't use the excuses to that to the person think well that's just a barrier let's overcome it does that make sense it's your responsibility to let that person know wait a minute this is a boundary and then they might go oh i never knew that thanks for letting me know and they walk away going i've been doing that my whole life telling those sisters they need to lose weight what have i done and and we've set the boundary today we've told you don't do that it's insensitive you're never going to get married that way sister i i'm interested but what are your thoughts on slim fast what's it called thin healthy mama what's this the weirdest diets we got out there all right all right romans chapter 16. verses 17 to 19 i'm bringing this just down to close here now i beseech you brother and mark them which cause divisions and offenses you know what defense refers to the trigger of a trap i think it's a very good modern word triggers something's true something triggers you why do you always subject yourself to it mark them which cause divisions and offensive offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them brother reggie was sharing something with me that he preached on defense and offense i was thinking pondering that and actually wanted to call you yesterday and and get more get more like kind of load me up you know i want to revisit this subject says and avoid them the lord could have been translated to shun all right a christian is to love their enemies turn the other cheek if you're sued for your cloak give your code also right there's this whole idea but then paul we're talking about limits we're just looking at the word does the word of god authorize us as christians to take to take measures to promote growth in our lives and to avoid the things that bring us down and to be sure that we're proceeding right in the right spirit in the right direction in the word of god he says mark those that cause divisions and offenses and avoid them for they are that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly it's arrogance it's presumptive pride it's satisfying themselves it's it's immediate gratitude it's that nastiness of self that they're serving and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple for your obedience has come abroad unto all men i am glad therefore on your behalf but yet i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil i would that you would be wise concerning that which is good that's what you associate with that's what you harmonize with that's what you feed on that's what you know that's what you're pursuing that's what you're understanding and innocent and simple concerning evil in other words we do not have to invite harm we are not forced to consent to evil we are not forced to serve to subject ourselves to unrighteous conduct in personal relationships he says i would that you would be wise unto that which is good cleave to that which is good abhor that which is evil there's a it's a joining yourself too he says be simple concerning evil be wise as serpents harmless as doves mark those which cause offenses and avoid them think about all these different scriptures lay aside the weight don't let a bitterness spring up inside me if it be possible and it's within your power live peaceably with all men but if you can't have peace and harmony in accord then something's got to change we need to learn and i was going to use an example when i realized now by skipping it i i might kind of have you and i realize now maybe would have just pushed us farther but you have to be very careful to understand where my heart's at and what i'm identifying hopefully it can become more personal to you in a very relevant way but we need to learn to set boundaries we need to know how to clearly define them and we need to learn how to address the violations i kept coming back to this over and over and over again and i could not get away from it yesterday i think i just don't know where i don't know where this is um it's just what kept coming to my mind over and over and over again too much salt and you'll die too much pride you'll die but not enough you won't live you won't stand the pride paradox setting limits according to a limitless word all these things i i know it's kind of like this difficult balance and you might be following me like i you feel like oh brother aaron's going over go back over here but hopefully just in time we just find that balance and that rhythm to just start going forward and i was thinking of this scripture in first kings second kings chapter seven verses three and four is what i want to read to you but in this time the syrians have besieged samaria i think i believe it's king bin hadad besieges samaria and it's in a time of a great famine so now it's being sieged and so if it had been a time of plenty it still ultimately would have been very bad but it'd be in a time of famine it makes exasperate circumstances and as the city's being besieged it gets so awful that the bible relates the story of how a woman told this other a woman let us eat my child this is desperate this is grieving this is terrible and it tells us interest so this is the circumstances within the city it's a famine it's being besieged it's being torn down there's not being fed they're dying they're devouring one another it's complete utter chaos is stuck within this and those barriers come and there's so much that i could try to express to but in second kings chapter seven verses three and four so there were four leprous men at the entry and end of the gate and said they said one to the other another why sit here until we die that's what kept coming to me over and over and over and over again why sit here until we die why why would we sit in a place where we're dying you know i die daily not in that way right the way that you just have to turn around like oh well you know this is what this is my cross and this is what i have to bear and this is what i have to go through and and if you're not suffering you're not getting perfect character and there's a way that we can take all these beautiful principles in the word of god that have their place and we misapply them and we're forcing ourselves into dynamics and mechanics that are not healthy to our spiritual growth why sit here until we die these four lepers finally come to this understand they're sitting there at the entrance of the gate if we say notice their their thought process we will enter to the city and then the famine is in the city and we shall die there we're gonna die i'm dying where i'm at spiritually dying i'm completely nothing is good nothing is healthy nothing's reviving nothing is revitalized if if i if we enter the city says i'm going to die there he says and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall into the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die in other words i'm going to die where i'm at i'm going to die if i go in there i'm going to die if i stay but there's a chance that i might live if i act upon this desire there's a chance that i might live if i get myself out of the situation why sit here until i die i'm dying i don't have to die christianity is life it is liberty it is joy it is happiness let us not take the sackcloth and ashes of downtroddeness and brokenness and being a doormat and being abused being marginalized and being and manipulated controlling well i guess that's just what i do i'm sheep and i just let the shepherd do whatever he wants with me no you're letting another sheep do that to you your shepherd doesn't do that to you you're christ your lord and savior jesus doesn't do that to you we've entered the wrong kind of dynamics we're living in the wrong kind of tension we're getting too much salt we have too much pride it's time to to act why sit here until we die it's such an amazing thought to see these four lepers sit there go you know what if we stay right where we are we're going to die that much is certain if we go in there we're going to die so here they are just kind of at the gate they know they're not fully invested they know they know they're not in there enjoying whatever the city has to offer they've they've already they already know they're they're the lepers right they're not in the upper crust right they're in the wrong kind of cast in this scenario you know what we can't really go in and live we know we're going to die if we stay here we're going to die it's like so you know what i need to let's go because if we sit here why sit here until i die and brother branham the message who is this melchizedek i know this is good i i know this will help the way he places this because if you're given the alter if you're given the choice say sit here till i die go in there and die or go to the enemy and maybe they'll let me live that that uh maybe that creates an idea of well the chances are i'm going to die and i don't want to risk death at the hand of my enemies i'd just rather resign myself to die in circumstances that i have control over in circumstances that are familiar to me right right it's the idea that people don't like change and so afraid of change they know they need change but they're so afraid of it and like i know i'm gonna die but change is a more horrible thought to me than death so i'll just take what's comfortable and die a comfortable death uh or an uncomfortable death at least in settings that are familiar to me i'm just using a language that hopefully can become relevant to your life in whatever circumstance you're in and the message who is this melchizedek he says one time there were three lepers sat at the gate of samaria and then leper said why do we sit here till we die because all the syrians starving to death and eating one another's children they said if we go down to the enemy camp the syrians if they kill us we're going to die anyhow if they save us we'll live and they took that chance and by that faith what a very what beautiful language brother branham they took that chance and by that faith not that we would ever encourage him but say well what do you got to lose but i'll say this if you continue doing what you're doing just listen listen to me if you keep doing what you're doing there's no doubt you're going to die something needs to change and they took that chance and by that faith they not only saved their selves but the whole group and elijah just prophesied by this day tomorrow so much is going to be sold for so much it's like that's impossible that's impossible that's impossible but what it took was for these four lepers to say if we stay in this situation we're going to die something needs to change and then brother brahms says this this is the the beautiful switch now now you're going to die you can't live but you're not asked to go to the camp of the enemy you're invited to the house of the father and live that's what you're being invited to and where we're living today what's been opened up to us to what we have a choice over i'll say this take away the message of the hour i believe that god would have something so i'm not i'm not just being presumptuous that in the absence of the message of the hour there would be no god but yet that's what god did that's what god opened up that's what god made available and our choice anymore is not like well they're all wrong so i'll pick the one that's the least wrong it's all awful it's all perverted it's all bad it's all no good so i'll just do the pros and cons and i'll look at amenities and i'll look at price average now look at how much gas cost or i'll choose this and i'll choose that this isn't a scenario where it's like well these are your treatment options you can do this one and live six months you can do this one live seven months this one's more expensive though but this one's less painful what kind of part why would you want to be in that situation so you're saying if i do this i have this chance it's painful and it costs a lot but this one i have a greater chance but it's more painful and it costs more and that's not you're hearing me that's not your choice well our choice isn't that you're gonna die choose the way you're gonna die he says you're invited to the house of the father and live your choice isn't i guess i just need to take the the quickest death the longest death the easiest death the least expensive death no we're not living in a time of death we're not living in a time of of dying and shriveling up and we're not living in the age of just eking it out we're living in the age of triumph we're living in the age of more than a conqueror we're living in the age where even death comes under your feet you are not the one to be trampled on you're the one doing the trampoline if i can say this is under inspiration our feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel our feet have its peace that our feet are standing in it's peace where we find ourselves not in war not in strife not in contention so it's in this place of safety in this place of peace that we can conquer our enemies not by responding in kind what is the statement that today they fight fire with fire but we will fight fire with water you're not asked to go to the camp of the enemy you're invited to come to the house of the father and live come and see you're invited to something beautiful you're invited to something great and i felt to say this to those of us who are experiencing certain situations and challenges right now and where you are in your lives i'm saying to you today why sit there till you die take a chance and by that faith come to a place to live your own personal lives your own circumstances and situations the choice isn't death or death you have the choice of life deny yourself take up the cross and follow him god bless you today if you'd stand together with me
