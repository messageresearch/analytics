TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you'd like to look at matthew chapter 27 again i want to look at verse 50 and this is going to help me get started and i really appreciate your attention today there is a lot that's in my heart to deliver i think at the end and at the end of it all it's very simple but we might be picking up a lot of different pieces to put it together into a puzzle that i think is going to have really great clarity and uh strength for you so in matthew chapter 27 verse 50 uh it says and i want to read this and then come back to it but i wanted to take it to verse 54 with you says jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice and yielded up the ghost and behold the veil the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were open and many of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went to the holy city and appeared unto many now when the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god and in other writings it's very clear that it's the centurion that's remarking this in the other gospels it said this meant truly this man was the son of god this is a a remarkable narration of events just in these these few verses that we're looking at right here and what matthew does when he in these verses this is what really i wanted to start here because when i was just looking at um the breadth of the subject matter that i wanted to share today i had i found that i had to find a starting place to begin to build and i kept coming back to and my subject was on the uh on the veil being torn and some of the symmetry with the open of the seals and i'd been looking at that and i kept coming back to this passage here and notice just what an incredible journey that matthew takes us on as we begin to read this is in verse 50 we hear jesus cries with a loud voice as soon as he cries again with this loud voice and that's going to have significance as we'll come back to and yields up the ghost john and matthew begins to write and behold the veil of the temple so in verse 51 we go from christ on the cross and we enter into jerusalem and we go we go into the temple and inside the temple he describes and we were able to see by his narration that the veil is torn in two and then he goes from the temple and watching this veil be torn in verse 52 he actually jumps forward in time and the events that he describes and he jumps forward to the resurrection morning at the time when the graves are opened and the saints are rising because it says after his resurrection and and you'll find that this is many just concur with this and brother branham oriented us to the resurrection morning when this event would have happened and so you see these sleeping saints rise up and this is in verse 52 but then our we kind of follow them into the holy city so our view shifts back to jerusalem as the bible says the old testament saints appear unto many and then in verse 54 we come right back to the crucifixion day so notice what we've just done jesus cries with a loud voice and then he brings us into the temple and we see the veil rent in two and then once that happens he fast forwards to a resurrection and i hope you kind of realize how these things are now there's a reason why matthew writes it this way he fast forwards a couple days later to a resurrection and then he comes back to the cross at the time where christ has cried out and those that stood near hear him and the centurion declares uh that this truly this is the son of god so matthew jumps from the cross to the temple on friday over into sunday then comes back to friday at calvary and so there's uh there's this moving around because jesus will look at later he's not in jerusalem he's just outside the city as it were when he's when he's crucified so he goes from calvary into jerusalem into the temple then it goes forward to sunday wherever wherever that view would be bringing in the view of the old testament states raising together and then when you hear the uh when you know the people that brother brown says were there then you know there was this place where they the forefathers were buried so it's almost as if our view goes over there and then they appear in dominion jerusalem and there's this moving around and all these things are connected together so if i don't come to a resurrection scripture this morning where we talk about the grave being empty what we're talking about we're going to be focusing in verse 51 because my easter message is the breaking of the veil and as soon as that veil is broken there's a resurrection as soon as it's broken matthew says and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept the rose and came out of the grace after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to me so this the breaking of the veil is what we want to focus on because this is a significant happening that we want to see and i and i say i say we want to see we just want to fellowship on so i believe that you understand these things and they're very precious to you but i want to look at this br the breaking of the veil is a type of what transpires in revelations chapter 5 in the open of the book and the revealing of the i am which you are a part of and so in matthew chapter 27 verse 50 it says and jesus had cried when jesus had cried again with a loud voice he yielded up the ghost and there's two other notable instances where christ cries with the loud voice and we even in what we just read he cried with a loud voice my god my god why hast thou forsaken me but i want to look at these two other notable instances where christ is crying with the loud voice and you'll find that they're they match they're matching what transpires here in matthew 27. in john chapter 11 verses 43 and 44 it's the resurrection of lazarus there's so many types we could dig into there in john chapter 11 a lot of things that we could mine out and enjoy but it says and when he had thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and so he's it's not a general cry it's a very specific direct cry uh had he just generally called to those that were sleeping uh and under that promise and and under those sacrifices looking to come then what happened in matthew chapter 27 would have happened at that very moment because he had that voice of the resurrection with them and he said lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with the napkin jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go what is it that we read in john chapter 11 the voice of the resurrection waking sleeping lazarus so this is even lazarus is a type of the old testament or the the saints that sleep the new testament saints he's a representation of those that sleep that are going to be resurrected and this is the voice of the resurrection he cries with a loud voice lazarus come forth we know this is the same voice in first thessalonians chapter 4 verses 15 and 16. for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent or hinder uh them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven this is christ himself the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first christ himself does all three as he's descending the shout it's the message it's the living bread of life it's christ that final attraction that final pull gathering together for the bride and then the next is the voice of the archangel and very clear what the teaching is on this it's the voice of the resurrection it's the same voice in john chapter 11 brother branham said so in matthew 27 he's crying with a loud voice and it says and when he cried with the loud voice he gave up the ghost he yielded up the ghost so when he cries with a loud voice in matthew he he gives up life to give up the ghost it means to expire to breathe out to breathe out one's life to it's to breathe your last breath and there's some that describe when they're near one when they're dying there's this breathing that takes place and there's this expiration of breath it even means when he gave up the gave it the ghost means to expire so notice he cries with a loud voice and his life leaves him and he dies but in john chapter 11 the same one who cried the voice of christ gives life to the one that was dead he cries with a loud voice and like life is it expires from him but the same one in john 11 when he cried it brought life to one that was sleeping now another notable instance where the same one christ cries with a loud voice is in revelations chapter 10. we'll read the verse three these things are extremely familiar to us it says and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven the very word used there is descend from heaven i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven it's very notable to remember this coming from heaven and there's some there's some uh movement there's something that's crossed over in this and this mighty angel we know is christ that's who this mighty angel is i'm glad at least one person knows this if anybody else agrees with him as we go forward you can amen him he says and i saw another mighty angel which is christ come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire this description is very uh will be even stand out to you even more when you begin to associate christ being a high priest in the holy of holies uh him even being a type of the mercy seat and all the all the elements that would have existed in the sacrifices and in the temple and the tabernacle and this description of christ here it would be so profound to a rabbi or to a jew so he descends from heaven he's clothed with the cloud a rainbow upon his head his face as it was the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had his hand a little book open it's that book of redemption the sealed book in revelations chapter 5 he has a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea in his left foot on the earth so his foot is uh he has one foot on earth one foot on sea his head is in heaven as it were but he's descending down from heaven and cried with a loud voice once again it's the same uh same verbiage actually when you read it um it reads in the greek it would look like it says uh a megaphone because it's it's crying it's the very word phone and megas it's a it's he's crying he cries with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he cried the seven thunders uttered their voices this is the same one in matthew 27 that cried with a loud voice at his crucifixion it's the same one at the grave of lazarus when he said lazarus come forth but in matthew 27 it says when he cried again with a loud voice this is a lamb that is uh crying out in anguish and pain he's suffering and and he cries out he's a bloodied sacrifice he's life is leaving him and he's beaten beyond recognition and he's crying out in pain and the anguish of even the being rejected by his father and the father turned his back to him and he's left completely alone and in his pain and his agony he cries with the loud voice that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me what an anguish what a crime and this is one of as a lamb who's bloodied who's slain but in revelations chapter 10 he cried and as when a lion roars and he's described as a mighty angel here's the mighty angel here's the one who is conquered you have the the lamb his breath is expired and he cries with the loud voice and life leaves him but now you have one who cries the same one cries and it's not a forsaken son on the cross it's as a lion roaring which brings us to revelations chapter 5 verses 5 and 6. one of the elders john is weeping because the book is closed and no one is worthy brother brandon even says in one place worthy to interpret it that makes it puts in a different light even in revelations chapter 5 verses 5 and 6 and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof no one is worthy in the earth anywhere nowhere no one's worthy to take the book even to look on the book but there was one who was worthy and he's described as the lion of the tribe of judah he's the one who is worthy to take the book and it says he prevailed he conquered he overcame to take the book and to loose and to open up that book and to loose the seals of it and he's the lion of the tribe of judah and that's why when he descends in revelations chapter 10 and he cries with a loud voice it's as a lion that is roaring because he's the mighty conqueror if you even think about the picture that was taken in the cloud we look at it as a wig but it looks like a lion's mane too because this is what's being expressed this kingship this deity this lion this of the tribe of judah and then john knows it's the line of the tribe of judah and he would he would know very well with the line of tribe of judah the root of david would refer to the messiah and be i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and we know these four beasts the four gospels represented the four gospels uh that are the protectors of the mercy seat in the midst of the throne or something very focal uh specific that's being looked at here and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits that god sent forth and all the earth now he's not looking at something else he's looking at the line of the tribe of judah it's the lion of the tribe of judas that office it's that in the taking of the book he's the lion who that hath prevailed and then he looks and the lion is the lamb it's the same one who was slain he looks and sees the lamb as it had been slain so it wants to give you this image and we know this is symbolism and its revelation is the book of symbols and i can still remember the first time uh that i ever heard brother lonnie jenkins preach it was on tape and uh and so he's the teacher right and so he says and i want to read over here in revelation book of symbols i was like does he gotta call it the book of symbols i mean and he was just reading from the sermon revelation uh book of symbols and it was when i learned that i was being a little snarky i was like wow that's how teachers like they they just it's just the way he said it it seemed very kind of you know book of symbols i was like i got a revelation yes it's the book of symbols and it's actually a sermon called revelation book of symbols so we know this is and he was quoting brother branham so sorry brother lonnie he got me back later on uh the uh where am i here so it's we know this is a symbolic representation there's something that's being expressed here that we see in symbolism and so it's the line of the tribe of judah that takes the book and opens the book but john wants us to see a bloody lamb in the midst of the throne in the presence of these four beasts in the midst of the elders there's a lamb as it had been slain it's bloody it's wounded it's the one that paid the price of redemption and so when we go back to matthew chapter 27 when the lamb which was on the cross cried again with a loud voice and life leaves him immediately says and behold look at verse 51 and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain torn in two from the top to the bottom so it's from the top to the bottom and this they say that um studying the bible doesn't say exactly how thick it was but they say that it was four inches thick and that it was it was so heavy uh and all the different elements of it to be carried that it was impossible for man to rip it and so just to be very clear that it wasn't man that did it it tore from the top to the bottom and at the same time it says the earth did quake and the rocks rent we know that there's a earthquake signifying judgment and so he cries with a loud voice and as soon as he cries with a loud voice the earth is quaking and rocks are breaking open open there's there's a shearing there's an opening up of these rocks and this is in the shaking this is very important to recognize because it's that we cries with a loud voice and the earth is shaking and rocks are being broke open but he wants us to look inside the temple and see that the veil is being torn into and in hebrews chapter 12 verses 26 to 27 it says whose voice then shook the earth and we know that the voice shook there on the mountain but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also the heavens so see these two things coming together again and this language is i'm going to shake not just the earth but the heaven and yet this word and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain remember that the tabernacle the temple was made with hands it was made by men and so in when the when the ground the earth is shaking and the rocks are breaking and the veil of the temple is torn this is a removing of those things that are shaken it's a fulfillment there's a fulfillment to israel that paul was talking about that there has been a fulfillment of this judgment of the shaking and this tearing down of things that were made a removing of the sacrifices the removing of the priestly order and this is a this is fulfilled to israel but he says yet once more is signified it's going to happen again so there's a fulfillment to the bride there's a fulfillment to zion and so this was judgment i i'm i'm deep into my subject already so if you're kind of waiting if i've established some kind of pavlov's dog thing with you guys let's just not do it i'm deep into what i'm preaching i'm going i love it i i i'm i'm inspired i don't don't know that i have a lot of fluff brother andrew's dad told me one time he wanted me to do a devotion at a men's meeting and he said take a sermon remove all the fluff and told me a little bit about how he prepares his sermons uh but i thought i don't have any fluff so i'll just try to find a short sermon but um and so i'm i'm in it this is not foundation stuff and this is just not me warming up if you need me to sweat i'll try to sweat turn off the air so i can people think i'm anointed so this was at this very moment this was judgment to the jewish church jesus here's the lamb on the cross he's dying he's bleeding out he dies and and the loud voice and the shaking of the earth and then the renting of the veil it's judgment to the jewish church when at the end of their jewish ages at their very climax it's the ending of the ordinances it's the ending of the government as we went through this in a couple services there's this signified the end of the jewish church state the end of the priesthood all these different things i say end you see the fulfillment of everything it pointed to so it says the veil of the temple was rent and twain from top to bottom i think about the very moment that this is happening if you could if we could just have matthew lead us into the temple at this very moment i wish he could have maybe described it in more detail but he makes sure that we know it's between the sixth and the ninth hour he's wanting us to kind of think about the very things that are happening because we call it easter what are the jews calling it the feast of the passover and the feast of unleavened bread they're keeping these feasts and so they have they are coming to jerusalem to celebrate this feast there's people bringing in their sacrifices they're using their temple to celebrate the feast of passover just like we're using our church they're using their synagogues and there's all these events are transpiring in this at this very time and so at the time of the passover sacrifice this very time that christ is being sacrificed the priest would have been in the holy place at the altar of incense at the golden altar it says in exodus chapter 30 verse 6 and thou shalt put it before the veil this altar where where the feast of passover the blood of all the lambs that would be brought would be poured out upon this altar he says it put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony so in order to not show off my artistic skills artistic skills i didn't do any kind of diagrams or anything like that but you just have the the ho the holiest the holy of holies the most holy place where the ark of the covenant was and is there's a veil and it says that this altar is by before that veil and the veil is by the ark of the testament before the mercy seat that is over the testament which is the law all those tablets where i will meet thee so this is this kind of gives us why don't you start thinking about this picture of the tabernacle and the temple that you would have the place where god meets the high priest it was between the cherubim over the mercy seat which was that gold piece and underneath that was the law was the tablet which it says the testimony so it's the ark of testimony and remember that law was a witness against israel and then how paul turns it right around and now he says the blood is sprinkled upon our hearts and the law is written in our hearts and we have a mediator of that of that offering and we realize oh my now i'm in the very image of what god was drawing out in that holy place the most holy place so there is the holy of holies the ark of the covenant inside is the testimony overlaid with the a lid was made of solid gold with the cherubim attached to it and then there's a veil that separates the most holy place from the holy place the holy of holies from this sanctuary where the uh the altar of incense or the golden altar would have been where this priest would have been pouring blood out upon it so here at the feast of the passover this very time we have our christian resurrection the crucifixion of the lamb but to israel the priest would be applying the blood of lambs to the altar and they're saying this is just going by tradition and and the the scholars and the ones that have poured into this and lined these things up they'd say about the ninth hour the passover lambs are being slain in the temple and we read in our bible is from the sixth hour to the ninth hour and about the ninth hour jesus is crying with the loud voice and so at the very moment that god tore the veil there at the same at that very moment there's all these people whether you want to look at it over those many days of this these feasts walking in these ordinances walking in the sacrifices but at that very moment that a priest could have been there before the altar of incense god tore the veil that separated the golden altar from the ark of the covenant that tore down that partition that a high priest could only enter in behind once a year on the day of atonement but here they're making this sin offering upon the golden altar and it's at that moment that god takes that veil and rips it apart and so the breaking of the veil the opening it's called the curtain of testimony in some places the breaking of that veil or the opening of that curtain signaled a great revelation and it signified a tremendous event so i want you maybe look at this event and a revelation and maybe we'll try to use those two different distinctions to bring something out there was uh very significant historical things unfolding very literal things so as we read matthew describe it this is literally happening but there's a they have great spiritual uh representations so there's a literal tearing or dividing of the veil and in that ripping of the veil it represented the ending of the jewish ages an ending of their systems now that maybe this is just a more historical context when the veil was torn so let's just dramatize it and i don't think you have to get picky on whether or not there was actually a priest in there and whether they would have been there on that day because it's wonderful to see people debate the days and the times and the months but we're just looking at the truth of it all right but it's if we could just imagine that maybe there was a priest in there with a lamb's blood pointed out upon the altar and at the very moment this veil is torn from top to bottom and when it happens it would have exposed the view to the holy of holies and as he looked do you know what would have been the most pronounced thing at that very moment there's no mercy there's there's no mercy seat there as a matter of fact the history is and now i'm forgetting the the name of the stone that they would apply the blood to there is no mercy it had been taken and with no mercy seat there was no blood upon that mercy seat there was no place where he would meet them between the cherubim therefore there was no shekinah glory as a matter of fact if you were a jew and you believed that once a year the high priest went in behind that veil and applied blood the of the atone toning sacrifice upon the lid of the ark of the testimony between the cherubim and there would be a cloud even upon that lid and the presence of god would come in there and you thought that was atoning once a year for the sins of the people and all of a sudden you got to peak behind the curtain and saw there was no ark of the testament these guys are a bunch of phonies this is fake this is fraudulent this is bloodless worship there's no blood here there's no atonement here they're not even doing what they were told to do and that's what's represented when this veil is taken away you look into the holy place and nothing there that god said should be there is there anymore and now watch how what this represents and the indictment brother bram says christ is god's provided limb now notice how appropriate it was showing that that jerusalem was ceasing that language is uh very i think we a lot of us probably recognize that language that jerusalem is ceasing that order those church ages that dispensation uh the law is ceasing the law has been fulfilled why because christ is the end of the law he is the fulfillment of the law so it's showing that that jerusalem is ceasing ending terminating expiring so when the very breath of the lamb and the breath comes out and that in the life of the lamb is expired at that very moment everything that every sacrifice always pointed to ends itself why because the bleeding lamb that was sacrificed pointed to that one the bullocks and the doves and the blood and everything that transpired through all those ordinances and all those offerings was pointing to the perfect one that would come so it's only appropriate that when that lamb died the rest of the system ceased to exist and he says when he says it was in effect until that hour the blood of the lamb was all right until that day the paschal lambs all the lambs that were being bought all the lambs that were being brought a lamb to a house he says but at that crucifixion but now at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done there was a new one and the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds i was pouring through the psalms and and looking at the different images that we could bring up before you in the scripture of the very things that they were singing and the psalms that they were crying out at the very moment the christ the true paschal lamb was there on the grounds being crucified and as he hung there he is not in the temple his blood is not being applied to the altar of incense or the golden altar it's not going beyond that veil and his blood being sprinkled upon the mercy seat but he's outside the camp he's outside the city and why because it was written in the law in the ordinances that there were certain things that took place and things were dealt with outside the camp what was it showing that god was foreshadowing by prophecy that you're going to reject the sacrifice he had them acted out every time they did it the sacrifice was brought outside of the city to be burned there was even a sacrifice that was let go outside the camp signifying that you're not going to receive the sacrifice you're not going to receive christ so there hung jesus christ outside the gate beyond the camp and what was it it was the mercy seat i know sometimes people struggle with the concept of a mercy seat they have it in their minds maybe it's a literal chair that says mercy on it or it's a cushion and it's bolted to the ground but really in the bible the mercy seat was always in motion even in the tabernacle in the days of the tabernacle witnessed in the wilderness that the staves and the poles and everything i put it on a cart they had to move it and so this is an event that matthew takes us from he cries with a loud voice we're watching the lamb which was deity bloodied and it's the mercy seat hanging there on the cross every element you need for the mercy seat is there in christ as it hangs across upon the cross so matthew says come real quick and look there there's no mercy seat there there's no ark of the covenant there's no there's no golden lid there's no cherubim there's no shekinah glory there christ was hanging and we would say in plain view and in hebrews chapter 13 verses 11 and 12 it says for the bodies of those beasts it's referring to the ones that were sacrificed whose blood is brought into the sanctum the sanctuary is the holy place not the holy of holies so it's referring to these different offerings where the blood would be brought into the sanctuary where the the table of show bread was the golden altar and the candlesticks for those bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp so they're brought in and their blood is poured out but then they're taken out of the temple out of the uh of the tabernacle and they're burned outside the gate without the camp it says wherefore therefore and that this is why jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate you can read it leviticus 4 21 where the sin offerings were brought outside of the gate and burned there's other instances in numbers and different place where they bring some of these images out but christ now is the fulfillment of this act of taking the beasts that were sacrificed and their bodies in bringing them outside the gate and disposing of them and burning them it says paul now catches this revelation and says that christ suffered beyond or outside the camp or beyond the gate or without the gate this is what christ did now that what took place in the old testament was pointing to the lamb that would be rejected and crucified without the camp without the gate but now there's still a representation in it brother batman going beyond the camp he says he rebuked them and they put him out of their camp what happened the days of his first coming jesus suffered without the camp so he brings in hebrews 13. they put him out of the camp outside way beyond their camp we find out that the bible said in this last day under this laodicean age they would do the same thing they would be put out of the camp now he's saying that there's a not there's not just an image that foreshadowed in the old testament of his first coming but now in the end of the cr the gentile church ages it would happen again now this is um this is to me is very striking i hope you can just see these pieces uh coming together i think it's going to be up to you maybe to put the puzzle together with the holy spirit's help but i feel that i'm giving you a lot of material to work with so now he says it happens again the same thing he's going to be put out of the camp in the last days in laodicean age where is that going to be revelations 3 20. behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me this is definitely descriptive symbolic language but a door is an entrance it's a way or a passage and the door is what's keeping the separating the fellowship because that's what he brings up that if this door can open then we can fellowship so the open of the door is the removal of a barrier that's keeping christ from having fellowship with somebody and so there's a separation what we could take from this there's a separation from the presence of christ we know all the things that brother graham said because he deals with the scripture quite a bit the word has been pushed out and so when it's described this way behold i stand at the door and knock if any man will hear my voice and open the door there is a symbolic representation of christ haven't been removed or put outside the camp and when christ is pushed out then there is a ch we could say a change of dispensation or even a change of administration because something has changed something has changed from how it had been think of it this way in revelations chapter 1 verses 12 to 15. okay before we start reading this can we if you're looking at revelations 3 20 ponder this again we know and we're taught very clearly very plainly that christ is no longer in the church he's pushed out he's made a refugee he's kicked out he's rejected he's no longer in the church this signifies a change or transition because now he has to deal with the people at this moment he's having to say listen i'm knocking on the door you have to hear my voice and has to be removing of what separates for us to come back into fellowship again and the first age they had left their first love and it culminates where eventually finally they get so lukewarm they pushed christ out it took a long time but it finally happened now to understand this image how striking it is to read that christ is no longer in the church in revelations chapter 1 verses 12 to 15 and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothe with the garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with the golden girdle brother batman one place says that this is even representing the bride which is very easy to understand that she is him so there's a representation of them in their oneness and his head and and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow again you can see even how it's the the same the white head of the uh the wigged one the mighty angel in revelations chapter 10 and his eyes were his flames of fire and his feet like undefined brass as they burned in a furnace in his voice as the sound of many waters this is describing uh this christ one likened to the son of man we know this is christ it's a sim it's symbolic of christ in the midst of his church through seven church ages because verse 20 comes to tell us the seven candlesticks are the seven churches that are in asia so these these seven golden candlesticks represent in the gentile ages the seven gentile churches through seven church ages and this depiction of this one in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks shows that christ was in his church in every age all the way all the way up to the seventh age here he is in the midst of his church in the midst of her in the midst of them and so these seven golden candlesticks with christ in the midst of them it's christ in the midst of his church but what are we reading in revelations 3 20 a different description now let's uh let's think about this imagery that's being described in revelations one the seven golden candlesticks correspond to the seven lamps that are in the sanctuary so if we were if we were wanting to focus on maybe the type of the tabernacle we could already see that what's happening for john right now as is he's come in from the outer court and he's in the holy place because now he sees the the uh the can seven golden candlesticks which are represented in the tabernacle the seven lamps in the holy place before you get into the holy of holies brother brahm said he said i'm the one that walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and on the last church age here he was on the outside i should have put the quote on the slide so you could read it because that's the image i want you to see here he is in revelations one christ in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks but now at the end of revelations chapter three in the last church age he's on the outside the one that was in the midst is on the outside they kicked him out whereabouts in this laodicean age standing again trying to get back again at his own door to his own church but it talks about how pathetic that is now there is a historical significance there's a symbolic significance just as we could say that there was literal events unfolding at the breaking of the veil but it also signified spiritual things in this imagery that uh that john is describing there's literal things that have transpired but these things are happening in a spiritual sense i want you to see the image of the temple in revelations 1. so let's look at hebrews chapter 9. i'm going to read verses 1 to 5 and then i'll skip to verse 23 then verily the first covenant it's uh there was one point i was tempted to just read the entire book of hebrews to you just hoping that somehow some way we could kind of just see the picture uh come out in 3d as we read it because it's it's amazing just how much depth paul goes into to proving who christ was by their own law by their own images by their own symbolism by their own traditions by the own arrangement of the tabernacle shall christ fulfill it christ will feel that christ will feel that christ fulfilled it says then verily the first covenant had also ordinance as divine service that would be the old testament the old covenant the first covenant had ordinance of divine service and a worldly sanctuary there's that's sanctuary thing now for there was a tabernacle made the first wearing was the candlestick and the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary see the outer court then you had the sanctuary which called also the holy place and in there's the candlestick the table the showbread and is also going to be the golden altar the altar of incense is in the sanctuary and after the second veil so there was a uh they called it a a gate i believe into the outer courts and then there was a a door the first veil or the first door into the sanctuary but now the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all paul's wanting us to see this image so he says which had the golden sensor and the ark of the covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the golden pot that had manna and aaron's rod that butted and the tables of the covenant and over the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly it must have been a mystery there that he wanted to share he's described the sanctuary and now what he calls the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all not just the sanctuary but this place behind the veil where is the ark of the covenant and overlaid with gold skip to verse 23 as he's established this image he says it was therefore necessary that the pattern of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly these the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these because he's talking about how the natural the the things that were in the image of the heavenly war were consecrated or sanctified with blood they were sprinkled with blood and these things were literally happening to the jews and their church ages and their traditions are in their doctrine and their belief in their system but he's saying but then the things that are heavenly are themselves sanctified or purified with a better sacrifice than that of bullocks and rams and lambs so he shows us the better sacrifice for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands christ has not come into the sanctuary at the table of showbread and candlesticks and a golden altar or he hasn't just come into behind be through a linen a veil a curtain made with hands four inches thick top to bottom uh very very heavy men had to carry it many men it had it was was not easily moved he says christ has not entered into the sanctuary or even the the uh the holiest of all which are the figures of the true so the sanctuary and the holiest of all or the the holy place and the holy of holies are the most holy place they symbolize and represented something that was literal as well but he says they're figures of the true remember i don't think i had them here i might come to it here in a moment where moses makes the tabernacle after the pattern that he saw and so there was a representation of these things in heaven and earth that the tabernacle is supposed to represent just as the tabernacle has outer court inner court and a holy of holies that even represents the man the three part of the man the three three parts of the person body spirit soul so christ is entered into that which are uh not the ones the holy place is made with hands but which are figures of the true but into heaven itself so catch that here's christ the high priest the fulfillment of what all those things pointed to it says he's entered into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us so he draws this image just as the high priest once a year on the day of atonement would come in behind that veil i himself have him in the it's called the anointed priest the anoint the one that is anointed the one that is anointed he had to make a sacrifice for himself he had to dress a particular way he had to be uh covered uh and prepared to go in there and they made preparation just in case he didn't do it all right there's no more bells ringing tug on the rope all right we lost them drag them out uh there's a ah this image now paul is saying that christ has not just done what these natural priests have done but now the high priest after the order of melchizedek has not entered into holy places made with hands he hasn't just merely come to a sanctuary and then is the holiest of all but he is now entered into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god now catch what paul is doing he's distinguishing between the sanctuary and the holy of holies and that veil and i think lord one i'll just spend more time on the veil and other services because i just feel really uh impressed that there's just so much more for us to look at in this but the veil in the temple separated the priest from the holy place where god's shekinah glory was and it was a veil of protection because if you entered into that improperly you would die and the veil then was a barrier between god and man it was a barrier between god and the high priest it was a place where god dwelt and it was there to keep god to mark off where god was so it held god the veil held god and god dwelt there and god was arrested behind that so the veil is the holding in of something but then the veil has another effect of keeping something away and so in when paul is separating out the sanctuary from the holy of holies and maybe you should have said this in the beginning i hope you're really really focusing if i could use a carnal type this is like a counting 101. if you miss a day of accounting 101 when you're in college you might as well just drop the course that's what i did because i missed a couple classes i was going to louisiana youth camp this very weekend so many years ago and i got back to class i'm like wait what what are we doing now what is this did i am i have the wrong class because it just all built or i don't you had to know what you had to know was on tuesday to get was if you're just now listening enjoy the the manner okay and i'll maybe try to use more hand gestures and and work work the platform a little bit better to keep you engaged but i hope you've been focusing this far because everything i've said everything i've said have been very deliberate about even if i can't put the make make the point that all the pieces are just being laid out every single one of these and hopefully at one point what happens is all sudden you see because they're starting to just all come here paul is saying that there was a first covenant old testament old covenant that in that covenant there was a sanctuary and a holy of holies sanctuary holy place or what he called the holiest of all there's a veil that separates those two one's the sanctuary but when he says that christ is now entering into heaven itself there's an image that's being expressed tabernacle was arranged to tell the story of redemption in earth and in heaven i've read this to you before in the jewish writings i said the structure of the tabernacle corresponds to the structure of heaven and earth the tabernacle below like was likewise made after the pattern of the supernatural tabernacle in all of its details so there was a dwelling place of god there was a spiritual image that god had in his mind remember genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth god right there just put all the elements of redemption right in front of us told the story of redemption a heavenly bridegroom and an earthly bride it's all laid out there and he told us that the bride was gonna be in chaos and his word had to bring order he tells all that in the first few words of his book first few verses of his book so in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth you have the dwelling place of god you have the place where the bride's going to be raised up but he's also portraying in words what the tabernacle is going to represent i know a lot of you are familiar with josephus and in his writings he presented the tabernacle as portraying creation he said the tabernacle represents creation in three parts and the outer parts of the outer court and the holy place or the sanctuary represented land and sea but then the holy of holies he uses this phrase a heaven peculiar to god because the priest would be in the sanctuary where there was a man-made light the candlesticks and they would be offering a sacrifice and instance performing their service and it was a consecrated place but there was one place that was separated out where god dwelled and there his presence would be as chicano glory would be and to go in there not properly dress and just for anyone to go in there with certain death because it was a heaven peculiar to god that is where the father is that is where god is he is in heaven and so this jewish in jewish tradition you have the most holy place the holiest of all and there's a veil that that separates the sanctuary the high priest and the service of men from the presence of god and this veil and jewish tradition symbolized the sky even you could even as i think even josephus calls it the panorama of the entire heavens in captivity it was a babylonian tapestry i thought that was really remarkable for the end time type because it's a babylonian denominational veil that needs to be torn down and so thanks brother josephus for that and they in this and even the colors if you look at the colors in the in the bible the colors were associated with the color of the sky that even the elements and the images and the things that were on it was this representation that this is the sky and this these are the heavens and god dwells in heaven his throne is in heaven his presence is in heaven and so even in genesis chapter one when he gets begins to get into creation he divides the firmament from the heaven and he is dividing the earth and the firmament from the heaven he's making these distinctions and he has a veil there and he puts these barriers that's going to separate the heavens god was putting in these layers to separate the heaven from the earth and so to a jew they saw the veil as being symbolic of the heavens that hid god in psalms 11 4 the lord is in his holy temple it says the lord's throne is in heaven and this is a statement this is the phrase when josephus is writing on the war he says thus the veil which screamed the holy of holies was also the boundary between earth and heaven right because the sanctuary could get cloudy all right could this the the the man-made light the lamp stand it had to be maintained all right the table show bread the altar of incense these there's men doing service i'm i'm having again this is like this is a 5 000 level course right this is your masters i can preach this on an easter morning to message believers there's a lot of things you already know that i'm capitalizing on these elements in the sanctuary in the holy place are relate to the earthly things in man but then once you go beyond the veil everything portrays deity god heaven and in in the ordinances there were different offerings that men would perform on a regular basis in the sanctuary but in leviticus 16 which god said this you'll keep on the tenth day of the seventh month forever as a memorial he's calling it it's the day of atonement where once a year a high priest entered through that veil that curtain into what paul says the most holy place the holy of holies so when the priest did it the high priest did it once a year as as the as in their oral tradition the veil screened the holy of holies it was a boundary between earth and heaven and so the high priest when he would go from the sanctuary and go behind that veil it was as if he was leaving the earth and entering into heaven even with the very language that's used to describe what's happening when the high priest enters in there and says and there's no man there there's some that even take it to say there's been a tran transition of the person where he's no longer human but now he's divine and by the blood this is that's beautiful by the blood now he crosses through that veil we'll come to it a little bit that veil would have already been sprinkled with blood i don't know how many times i tried to imagine what it would have smelt like but he walked in through that veil and he comes in and now it's as if he's entered into heaven because he's coming into the presence of jehovah before the mercy seat which was a symbol of heaven which is representative of heaven so this is a very supernatural thing it wouldn't be hard for us to imagine that right because you're seated here in heavenly places right already right now seated in heavy places so this high priest then when he entered in behind that veil there's this great spiritual transition translation a temporary resurrection to her now he's coming in behind the veil and he's entered into the presence of jehovah and heaven as it were heaven and tight but then paul says christ has entered into the holy of holies he says as into heaven itself why because it was imagined and it was represented in the sacrifices in the temple but now he says christ has entered into the heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us so there's the sacrifice there's the high priest there's the blood there's the mercy seat there's the shekinah glory on top of it it's all represented in that union between god and his son and the sacrifice of christ he's entered into heaven itself nice and he's literally not just what was represented in the tabernacle and the sanctuary into the holy place but now christ has done it what it represented my revelations 3 20 then behold i stand at the door knock what's representing that image then remember how we arrived there is the breaking of the veil was the ceasing of jerusalem i'm just trying to catch us all back up the break in the bill was the ceasing of jerusalem brother man says it's going to happen again in the end time when he's put out of the camp according to revelations 3 20. and in revelations 3 20 there is christ is pushed out of the church and so he was that that in the church was represented the sanctuary seven golden candlesticks christ just pushed out so paul uses those very same images to describe how the high priest would be in the sanctuary and then he would enter in behind the veil into heaven and type to offer that sacrifice on the day of atonement and then he says but christ has not entered into the sanctuary or even behind that veil into the holy place but he's entered into heaven itself as the sacrifice once and for all in the presence of god for us and so then we come back to our type of our time in our day behold i stand at the door knock the church has separated itself from christ so there's a transition that's taken place just like at the crucifixion when brother brahma says jerusalem is ceasing and at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done so it was in effect until that hour right jerusalem is ceasing in effect to that hour crucifixion it changes the old system is done why because the sacrificial lamb has there's there's something that's changed in relation to the mercy seat something changed in relation to where the shekinah glory is so brother adam in that very statement i was reading to you earlier the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the ground jerusalem was ceased it was effective this hour he says god be blessed for seeing this wonderful heavenly light in this last day because the churches are doing the same thing today what what was the church doing in the days of his first coming crucifying christ he's hanging on the cross but what did it represent their time is over until the hour that organized organized religion organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing christ's word from then on comes the word and the word only from the old paschal lamb passed away and christ became our lamb at the day of the crucifixion and the day so there's the there's the transition then at the end of the jewish ages when the breath is expired it shows as his life is given out it's fulfilled all the shadows and types of the law christ is the end of the law so the veil of the temple is rent showing this system is done it's over here he hangs on a cross that's the duke that's the new mercy seat so he says and the day that the denomination crucified the word of god and accepted a creed instead of the word that's the day the word come into full effect that's just been recently what would have been recent in july 7 1963 the opening of the seven seals that's the significant event that it transpired he says that's just been recently so when these things transpire and the revelation is giving then it's it's opening up something to where brother branham could say that what the jewish church did to christ christ's church is now done to him in the end of the gentile ages and but notice just as christ is being crucified and his breath leaves he's forever consecrated a new covenant so he said oh he died well he's but he by his blood the shedding of his blood he's consecrated a new covenant a new testament and there it exposes the old system but something new is being born and going beyond the camp brother man says the son of david a few hundred years after that set on the same hill and wet because he was the rejected king among his own people it's christ always talking about david feeling rejected then christ the son of david is rejected and today when it's prophesied that christ must come into the camp you know what happened so now he's got us today it's be it'd be just exactly like it was then it's got to be that way to fulfill what the word here promises he will do now remember christ was in the age of noah that was christ jesus christ the saying yesterday forever the rejected word of the hour notice and his prophecy of revelations 3 revelations 3 20 is prophecy then when he come in the last days as he prophesied he would come in this last days and how did he find the church at laodicea rich have need of nothing said as a queen and can see no sorrow and put him outside the church prophecy in revelations 3 of the laodicean age when he would come he would be put outside the church had no use for him he went without the camp again where does that place just think of this where does that place christ in this moment what images are being brought here he's veiled again once again or he says he's failed i'll say this once again there's been a system established in a pattern of the real a false vine and in in that there they it appears to be the real genuine thing but god is saying i'm not in there i'm not in it but don't we do this don't we do that don't we do but i'm not in it now if you could with me um i'm just over halfway through we're good now i want the image in the picture just to get very very stark to you i want it to be very focused now so on calvary christ is hanging on the cross deity is dripping with blood his life is being poured out and he cries with a loud voice and the breaking of the veil the loosing of that curtain exposed that god had left their temple and at that moment the old veils tore apart and the system's done right at that moment it's like who's ever going to go back to that you could see your testimony right if you were if you were dragging a lamb up there that day and you come to find out there's wait we don't even have an arc wait there's no presence of god behind that veil why would i ever go back to this church right there's something exposed that was lacking but god god doesn't ever just tear down something if he doesn't have something uh else just as we see it's all in the parable of the who is who is my neighbor that there's a lot of times we act like thieves because we strip people of their religion we strip them of their beliefs we strip them of their comforts but we don't give them anything else so at the very moment that the old system is proved to be wrong it was a good to that moment there's a new veil right because he's consecrated a new covenant the old veil had been abolished the old veil had been removed but then there i want you i want to use this language and maybe i'm just seeding something for later the new veil a new veil was raised up because in the message the unveiling of god brother and says god is always behind the veil did you know that you know what you're going to see in heaven his son because god is always always behind the veil he said god is hid from the public so god is not into a public show even when the most remarkable significant most sublime things are going to happen god isn't going to do it as a 900 foot jesus god is not going to do it as a pie in this guy god's not going to do it openly it won't be a public show it will always be hid behind something humble even if it seems like it's within a great big cathedral it'll always be something very small something private something intimate because god does not clown for the devil god is always hid from the public he's always behind the veil in hebrews chapter 10 verses 19 to 22 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus now this is this is blasphemy to a jew but this what he's saying is hey you know that carpenter you guys crucified you know that blood you shed that was shed and that one that you say the disciples stole his body because he died and shed his blood but my confession that he died for my sins and the returning of his spirit upon me i have been anointed to enter in behind the veil to come before the mercy seat into the presence of god and a jew begins to rip his garments and blasphemy and pull out his curls but he's saying we have boldness to enter the whole list by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us notice through the veil that is to say his flesh the the way the way to in there he consecrated it through the veil that is his flesh and having a high priest over the house of god christ who has what entered into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us now having this high priest let us draw near with the true heart and full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience so now we like the elements of the tabernacle we likewise are being sprinkled he says our hearts being sprinkled uh from an evil conscience and where is the tablet of testimony it's written in your heart now it's sprinkled with the blood and our body's washed with pure water he's putting us in the very what steps of the high priest who is cleaned and washed and anointed and has the right to stand before the shekinah glory so one one veil was abolished when he cried with a loud voice and it rent the veil of the natural tabernacle the natural temple but there still was another veil because he said it was the veil of his flesh that forever consecrated the way now i recognize it in some way maybe we're using veil in a different sense but they're connected it's kind of that paradox nature of the veil that brother brown begins to talk about in the end time but there was a veil that was written that was torn that exposed that veil was covering nothing it hid nothing but a stone the foundation stone i think is what they call the the founding stone with the connected to creation connected to different things in the garden and they they say that in their later tradition after the captivity after the ark of the covenant was gone they sprinkled the blood upon this stone they at least were trying to be sincere with what they had if you can't get a full ark get it get a slice and now this veil of his flesh it was a bloody veil covered in blood and leviticus 4 it goes through sin offerings and have have you anybody ever kind of sat down and tried to figure out the feast and the sacrifices and which ones which and which you know it just all points to christ right just i want to just see jesus christ in all of them because you've got grain offerings and you have burnt offerings and you have some that are done this way and you have turtle dubs and you have this this and you have the scapegoat and you have all these different things like well which ones which one well you're not gonna be able to figure it out with all the different people just all somehow in some way expresses what christ has done for us it's all forward-looking in a way that's pointing to something so in leviticus 4 you have the sin offerings if a leader sinned of a high priest if the people sinned if they said ignorantly there was things that they could do to bring the blood and a sacrifice in a bullock and that blood would be shed and it would be sprinkled upon the altar but then this notice in verse 17 leviticus 4 17 and the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the lord even before the veil so the the veil in the would be uh covering the ark of the covenant covering that room that contained the which was the most holy place which was the scatter course kind of going where the lord dwelt so he would stand before it and he would take the blood and he would sprinkle it says before the veil and in the language of other translations and in the and the tradition he would be doing it to the veil towards the and it would be on the veil of the sanctuary he would actually be sprinkling the blood the veil with the blood of the sacrifice and so the veil then had blood that had been scattered was placed upon it blood placed upon that veil and so this veil is a bloody veil that hangs in the natural tabernacle pla keeping the blood uh the the mercy seat hid from the people in the sanctuary still a bloody veil that keeps people from seeing them in second corinthians chapter 3 verses 13 and 14. i am going to come back to some of these things on this because i wanted to read much more if you recall we've been reading from 2nd corinthians 3 a lot in terms of the new testament able ministers of this new covenant and there's there's a lot in this entire chapter you can draw from but now the veil comes into view again because this is the function of a veil he says and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished they what was abolished the laws the sacrifices the ordinances and they moses himself after he had gone into the presence of god he'd go in the presence of god remove the veil come back out put the veil on to talk to the people he was already symbolizing before the tabernacle was even built that the children of israel couldn't look upon them why because moses became a god to the people and i kind of may be getting more into it than i wanted to but there's a veil is there to symbolize something to represent this was duplicated and replicated even in the tabernacle but their minds were blinded for even and we've read this recently for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away the same veil not unveiled the same veil remaineth the same veil untaken away not unfolded in the reading of the old testament so they read the old testament which points to christ but the veil is still standing between them and the scene of christ but he says which veil is done away in christ so the veil that kept mo the glory that was upon moses's face for the people one is hit that veil is taken away don't be afraid to look into his glory when it comes to the veil before the shekinah glory that veil is done away with christ so paul says we have boldness to enter the holiest by the blood of jesus why there's been a consecrated new and living way and we are washed with that blood and we have a right to come before christ raised seated together with them in heavenly places because that veil that separated man from the sanctuary from the the dwelling place of god has been done away in christ so christ did away with one veil but christ himself is a veil because he said he did away with that veil through the veil that is his flesh so he took one bloody veil and tore it down but what was hanging on the cross another bloody veil so the break-in of the veil signifies an exposure right exposing of the jerusalem systems that we're ceasing exposure of something that is bankrupt something is godless something that is bloodless that god is no longer in there's no life in it but this is the last part i want to share with you is that it also is a great revealing and an unveiling christ is there on the on the on the cross as the mercy seat in plain view and they're looking right at it the same way they would be looking at a bloody veil in the sanctuary right same way billy bran now so this what i want you to see is that when christ when the veil was torn it was there was an opening up an opportunity is there an it opportunity for advancement but i said the opening veil on that day at calvary revealed the way to the total victory the open of the veil revealed the way so that's what i wanted to amplify for a few more moments now the opening of the veil is a revealing it opened up the way between the sanctuary which was the earth and heaven which was the presence of god it was opening up away so in mark so on the on the cross as he cries out with the loud voice it says the veil of the temple was rent it was divided it was separated it was opened up now notice this in mark chapter 1 verses 9 to 11. and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth under galilee and was baptized by john and jordan now now watch what's going to happen here i think this is very very important it might seem a little bit disjointed i apologize that's that's entirely on me because i'm the one that's been up here preaching for an hour and ten minutes because in straight way now so jesus comes to john and straightway coming up out of the water so what's happening we know the dialogue between them two jesus is baptized by john and as he's coming up out of the water he saw the heavens opened now remember what the tabernacle represented and how you had the sanctuary which was the earth you had the outer courts and the sanctuary land and sea and now as this one comes from the land and to the water and now there's an opening as he's in the water he sees the heavens open and the spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i'm well-pleased this is now this whole image i know we're very familiar with it but it says he saw the heavens open that could have just as easily been read translated to i saw the heavens rent because it's the same word so just as the veil the temple was ripped into and you could see into the the the holy place the most holy place the holiest of all and you could see that there was no mercy seat there was no shekinah glory there was nothing there and then on calvary there's the new veil that's hanging there upon the cross and he cries with a loud voice that veil is rent here he is he's standing in the waters and it says heaven is opened up heaven has been rent and when that opens up what gets out the spirit descending from heaven the spirit like a dove descended upon him and a voice comes from heaven so it's like a curtain's been opened up a veil has been opened up and it looses the shekinah glory to come down out of heaven and there's a voice tracking right behind it thou art my beloved son and whom i'm well pleased to dwell god announces at this moment i will dwell in this tabernacle i will dwell in this place this is where i put my name oh how does brother branham describe it heaven and earth embraced right heaven and earth kissed that's when the word was made flesh that's when god and man this is why christ had become the way that he did because he looked like an earthly man he had this semblance of an earthly man he had the earthly lineage he was the root and offspring of david he had to be connected to the earth but he was also the lion of the tribe of judah he had to be connected to deity so at his baptism heaven opens up and it rinse open and the spirit gets out and the chicano glory descends upon that body and he's joined together with the man and it's heaven and earth kissing heaven and earth embracing then the word was made flesh the shekinah glory that was on the ark had now settled on another tabernacle christ and in matthew 27 the natural veil of the temple is supernaturally tore open and it's the same language heaven is opened up now the in which the veil represented remember what jose brother josephus was telling us how the the veil itself signified the separation between heaven and earth and so when heaven opens up it's as if that curtain has been removed and god joins with all the all the symbolism all the types now it's all coming together it's all blending it's all mixing together and he says this is my beloved son in whom i dwell in whom i'm pleased to dwell in and so when we come forward and that natural veil is supernaturally tore open catch us at the very same moment that it happens i'm trying to find another place where i wanted to read this it says in matthew 27 54 i think i have that one it says now when the centurion so he says he cried at the loud voice the veil of the temple is rent and what does matthew do he takes us on a journey so hold on here let me let's back up let's go on this journey cries with a loud voice come to the temple real quick i want to show you something see the veil it's been torn now watch what just happened as soon as that veil was torn let's go forward to sunday morning look what it look what happened look what it made away for old testament saints or reservation let's follow them back into jerusalem on sunday they've seen them many say now let's go back he cried a loud voice the veil was torn in that very moment when this takes place the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god and mark it says he said the centurion the satarian which stood over against him saw that he so cried and gave up the ghost so now mark connects the crying of the voice the expiration of life he said truly this man was the son of god what does the centurion say he says when the that veil is torn he says the same thing that god said when the heavens opened in mark 1 when the sacrifice was washed when the sacrifice came to the water and was washed god the heavens opened up and that veil was opened up and the shekinah glory came down of the heaven upon the new mercy seat upon upon christ that was going to be the sacrificial lamb he was the lamb he was the high priest he was the mercy see it was all pointing to christ it was going to be satisfied in one god said this is my son this is the son of god and then on the cross when the veil was torn the centerian is moved he was moved his words are recorded in the scripture he was moved if i could say he was inspired and god caused his lips to confess the same thing that god did on the jordan river truly this man is the son of god oh and i got so much joy and pondering it it was a centurion so there's there stood at the cross a gentile a gentile who fully couldn't comprehend what was happening at the ceasing of jerusalem but yet something in that moment inspired him to say this is christ this is the son of god and we have a gentile witness that day of what happens when heaven is open when the veil is torn oh praise the lord the break-in of the veil is a symbolic opening of heaven the break-in of the veil is a loosing of the mystery to reveal christ the brother man says in the unveiling of god go listen to that go listen to the mighty god unveiled brother jared i know you were listening to it recently and going through it studying it god brother says god veiled in a human being he was in that flesh and that flesh was his veil the veil was rent the god might be made manifest there was a veil that was torn in the temple but then there was a veil that was bloodied bruised and beaten in rent on the cross that god might be made manifest the veil being opened is to manifest god that's exactly what this i want you to see in the opening of the veil when he cried with a loud voice and a veil was opened it's sick there's a literal happening there's symbolic representations but it also represents a revealing so now in the unveiling of god i want to read more if those of you have good eyes this is all i got left and this is usually about a half hour 45 minutes we'll see where we end up and the unveiling of god i want this to be a special service right brother andrew kept telling me came all the way out here just to be in service with you all and i'm like all right i better give him a good one didn't get much feedback on wednesday so i'm hoping that we can just make up for it tonight today tonight glory gonna get there so the unveiling of god paragraph 108 follow him please please stay closely with me that the time is it's noon uh we'll preach long enough so all the restaurants empty out he was in behind the veil now he was behind what skin veil and he says see badger skins and i believe what he's doing then is he's he's representing what the whole thing wrap the tabernacle the whole thing from the outer walls and then behind the veil and when that veil was rent on the day of crucifixion the veil that he was wrapped in was rent on the day of crucifixion see the the two breakings of the veil the whole mercy seat came into view the whole mercy seat came into view that's what's that's what he was behind the veil now i'm skipping to paragraph 112. oh brother sister that's what the jews did when he was the veil was rent and brought god in plain view hanging on the cross but i mean two to everyone else a lot of people standing by oh let's see if elias will save him this is god this is the mercy seat god is in plain view in this image of this if i be lifted up and then here's this image on the cross that the brass serpent represented it all the sacrifices everything the veil upon most everything's there it's all signified and represented here here he hangs on the cross god is in plain view he was in plain view but they couldn't see it oh that you think behold him israel behold him your messiah your savior your redeemer your kinsmen behold him here is the mighty god before you do you see him can you know him he was in plain view but they couldn't see it could it be possible that the gentiles have done the same thing oh god when they have had church ages of the son of god you should recognize what he just did he reveals himself as the son of god through the church ages but at the end of the church ages he reveals himself again as the son of man they've had him in the church ages of the son of god but now when now the veil of denominations and things the veil of tradition that we've got since pentecost when the church traditions have been rent the things that the people said days of miracles passed and these things and god has took the veil off of it and brought it in plain view and they're ready to crucify it again just exactly like think about it it's history has repeated itself it has come back around and this is the reality of laodicea revelations 3 20 behold i stand at the door and knock and now you have denominational veil traditional veils you have all these veils that availed god from the people and now a prophet is standing there crying with the loud voice and he's tearing down all the veils that'll keep the believer from christ so how and when is this veil torn how was it represented in scripture we kind of walked you through revelations uh in the revelation the image of the tabernacle so revelations 3 20. behold i stand at the door not christ is on one side of the door the church is on the other everyone else is on the other side then chapter four read this with me verses one and two after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven so now we see a door opening in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show you these things which must be hereafter so revelations one it's christ in the midst of the golden candlestick so it's it within that that's in the sanctuary represent the sanctuary the lamp stands and the showbread here he has christ in the midst of him and in revelations chapter two and chapter three describe those seven golden candlesticks the complaints the compliments christ in the midst of his church the rewards but he says after this let me show you the things that must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne set in heaven and one sat on the throne church ages christ in the midst of the candlesticks the sanctuary but now he goes from the sanctuary a door is opened in heaven what does the veil represent signifies the panorama of heavens and he's called to come up higher and it's as if he's transferred now from the sanctuary into the throne room because chapter four he just describes the throne room described in the midst of the throne brother i said the same voice that was walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks also was the same voice he heard in heaven saying come up hither john went up yes so in chapter four a door is open in heaven it's another entrance and i'm gonna i'm gonna run out of time here and i'm just gonna have to clip my mic back on in case i start to run but think about the scene then it changes it changes from the earth to heaven you have to recognize that revelations one two and three is a there's a transition and a change in from chapters two and three explicitly from earth to heaven and it says that a door is opened in heaven there's a veil torn there's a dispensation change and i'll just use some summary language john is lifted from the church ages lifted from revelations three and what he begins to see thereafter he describes the throne room which would be like in the symbol of the the mercy seat he's the way he's describing it would have these different elements and what does he begin to see the sealed book of redemption opened and as he continues to watch what happens when it opens he sees the book come back down to earth again think about that think about what's transpiring what's taking place so brother brown says oh brother sister now unveiling god are you catching it look don't you see it's been veiled through these ages according to what god said and it will be opened in the last days those seven seals would be broke and the full thing would come into view of the people so when john is describing when john sees the symbols of the church ages and he comes to the end of the church ages and christ who had been in the midst of the golden candlesticks is no longer there and he says he's knocking at the door the very next scene is a door opened in heaven and christ is speaking from heaven now he is in the throne room now he's going to go to the father now he's going to take the sealed book from the hands of him that sat upon the throne and he's going to open the book he's going to loose the seals and so now john's view changes from earth to heaven and john is going to watch things take place there before the throne but he's going to see that book come back down to earth and he's going to have an opportunity to take it need it so once again a veil is breaking a veil is opening and in that opening it exposes the church right he's no longer in those systems god doesn't know his presence is no longer there they're sterile they can't give life uh they can only produce stillborns they can only produce after their their mothers their brother is very explicit about what god has done in this age but not only does it expose the church but it reveals christ when the veil is torn it exposes the church but it also reveals christ amen and i want to leave you with this thought i said two statements i want to read from the unveiling of god but i want to leave it with this if there's been one veil torn down there must be another veil because god's always behind a veil there must be another veil that not only hides him but reveals him another another place where the shekinah glory dwells and as we've been preaching i am an open book i want you to see your place in this and i want to use this story to close in the unveiling of god i mean it's only taken me eight minutes to get halfway through this page see how hard you're pulling and unveiling a god no you remember the story but i wanted just to read the story so you can this could build there was an auction one time and they got an old fiddle up you've heard it many times an old violin the auctioneer said what am i offer what am i offered for it i may not have done this just right according to the poem it's been many many years but it comes on my mind and they picked up the old fiddle it didn't look very much looks crummy and everything he couldn't even get a bid on it finally i think he got a bid for a dollar or something like that and there was one standing there that didn't think it ought to sell for that so he went picked it up he struck in his hands and picked up the bow and rosined it and he played a tune and when he did everyone started crying they'd never heard such music in their life then the auctioneer said what am i offered two thousand five thousand ten thousand what was it catch this the master's hand revealed what was veiled in the old instrument the master's hand revealed what was veiled in the old instrument i'll leave it up there for just a little bit longer if you want to jot it down take a picture however you want to remember this the master's hand revealed what was veiled in the old instrument did not the master reveal what was hid in the old testament take the same master's hand to reveal what's veiled in the new testament the master's hand revealed what was veiled in the old testament same now the old book gets ragged it's laughed at burnt made fun of but the time has come that they got a denominational auction the world council of churches they're sounded like nobody's business there's a denominational auction coming but remember there's something in the old book that promised that there would be predestinated ordained hand come one day that would pick it up and make the word of this book through a predestinated heart to the task that it's made for and reveal the promises that's in it oh i say in type you could just say to him oh master come and take this book come and take this book and open it up god come and take this old mocked abused and persecuted book confused whatever it may be and open this book why because all that is in the book is the believer it's you the words and the book he says there's got to come a predestinated ordained hand to take this book through a predestinated heart to the task that it's made for and reveal the promises that's in it oh it might look like a bunch of holy rollers or something other but just takes the master's hand to reveal on it to reveal that word and it becomes more than a holy roller it becomes that to the very every one of us hasn't it friends it's not a bunch of fanaticism it depends on whose hand has the bow depends on whose hand the bow is in let me say this there's something even if we wanted to use it about the books and tapes and the mp3s and the message there's something bound up in that there's something sealed in it there's something sealed in this book he says it's been mocked it's been laughed and it's been scorned it's been burnt but it holds a mystery he said the master's hand revealed what was veiled in the old instrument if you're this new testament it's the master's hand that will unveil what is veiled in this book and brother braham says and god in the unveiling of god you are the veil that veils him you are the veil that veils him i think a lot of statements that may be being read this morning is what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is he resurrected out of dark denominationalism he's revisiting so many themes that i've loved to preach through the years on easter and they're so beautiful they're so precious they're so important i i think there's nothing wrong in revisiting regularly even if it was just every easter to remind ourselves that we're in a time of a resurrection out of dark denominationalism and what happened then has happened now spiritually for the bride my closing statement brother brown said he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to others let us die to the traditions and things to reveal him to other die in the denominations to reveal him to others it is our duty this generation must reveal jesus christ and just as he died to reveal himself to us then we've got to die to our veils we've got to have veils torn down doors and doors of the heart denominational veils denominational interpretations our own personal ambitions all our desires we die let us die as he died to reveal himself to us as a veil was torn to make a way of revealing let my life which is a veil though him and let me die to all my other ideas let those veils be torn down that i can be a true veil of the shekinah glory i think one of the things that saul stirred brother brown him up in christ as a mystery as he came to this place and said just think just think christ revealed right in us now right now in us where is the shekinah glory today it is in his people so let us die to reveal him to others that'll that's what's going to make this a true easter is when they see the resurrection in you and you know what to some to some they may see nothing more than a holy roller to some that may seem nothing more than a man that is beaten and blooded upon a cross they may see nothing more than the veil but you've got to be that because it's the way to christ let's stand today
