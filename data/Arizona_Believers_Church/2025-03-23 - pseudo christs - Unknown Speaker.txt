TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Romans chapter 1 vers 18 to 2 and I'm going to be focusing specifically on verse 25 but this will give us a little bit of the background for this Romans chapter 1 verse 18 for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God hath shown it showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even even his eternal power in Godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and a four-footed beast and creeping things wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen amen you can have your seats you can see uh from my title Slide the title of my sermon today pseudo christs and I'm not capitalizing either word there I wouldn't want there to be any confusion as to the legitimacy of a false Christ if you uh want to dig into some places in the message where or a place in the message where this thought is explored in much greater detail anointed ones at the end time would be something that would be very on point for this but we're going to use this title pseudo Christ on Wednesday night we were wrapping up a thought on how unbelief is anti-faith and using that thought that sin is mistrust or doubt in God and it's not just those attributes of sin where we see somebody doing something that might be ungodly we say that's sin that's sin we know that at the root of it is mistrust in God or doubt and so sin is unbelief unbelief is against or anti-faith and to be anti-faith or to doubt or to fear that's the product of Satan's system if he has a something that's working and something that's moving the product is death out and he he will always work he's always laboring he walketh about seeking whom he may devour he's always looking to erode our confidence in God and His word if you can just get us to question his character even to the point where you say well that's true but I just don't think God knows what he's doing or I don't like the way God does it if he could just cause you to put a question mark on the word or on God's character then it will that's Satan's objective and I would even go so far as to say that doubt or mistrust in God's word is is one of the consequences for those of us who abuse the world so the overuse of the world and too much interaction with the world uh doesn't feed our faith but feeds our flesh and therefore in the weakness of our uh spirits and the weakness of the inner man we can begin to doubt or lose confidence in God so Satan's working to do it and sometimes we can do it to ourselves now on this title pseudo Christ like is I mentioned anointed ones at the end time we could put it this way that there's many that will profess uh Christ and profess to be Christians or to Believe In Christ but in fact are influenced by the Antichrist or they're driven by anti-faith and the what I what I'm speaking who I'm speaking to today is very clearly the bride I almost titled this pseudo Brides but I wanted to use pseudo Christ so I'm not I'm not taking this as an opportunity to really needle the a pseudo Christ or the Antichrist or to Target uh you know some group but I'm speaking in a way that's to encourage the Bride of Jesus Christ and anything that is a pseudo Christ as we're using that phrase and we'll substantiate it here through the scripture really at the end serves to distract the true bride or tries to at least deceive the believer now if you look at verse 25 of where we just were in Romans chapter 1 it says who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who was blessed forever amen now it's talking about those that hold the truth and unrighteousness and really speaking to humanity and Mankind it's not that we're specific names mentioned here but this is all of us collectively as humankind have been guilty of doing this in our societies and through history it says they changed the truth of God into a lie and I want to focus to on this middle phrase just for a moment and worshiped and serve the creature more than the Creator so their worship and service those two things together they were Incorrect and they were taking the creation obviously out of context because it says they were worshiping the creation or that which was created the creature more than the Creator and by with their service and their worship being Incorrect and they're worshiping the creation they've taken creation outside of the plan of God they don't recognize that uh God they may say well God put this here and God created it but they begin to worship it and it's separated from the plan of God and being separated from the plan of God they there's no there's no glory to God in their service uh there's no worshiping of God in their worship and so they worshiped and served what God had made or what he had created what he had brought forth by his word and not the God who created it so you see that separation uh that they begin to do is they're honoring or venerating or giving uh glory to the creation but it's separate from God and once they've once they've changed and separated God or take separated that God out of the creation and that separation from the context of it God the creator of it God in the process of doing it uh it changes their worship it changes their service I'm going to give service to I'm going to do something we could say that uh as Believers and as Christians we should have a we should be conscious of how we're using the Earth's resources and that there's a certain conservationist uh in US as Believers that we want to take care of the environment we want to do things right but if you separate the context of God being the creator of all of it it there's really no service that's being done to God or any value to the creation and once we've been once Satan is able to and this is drawing from where we were last Sunday to kind of question God's character or separate God from something to allow us in ourselves to take shortcuts and in doing so maybe model an idea maybe manufacture something or pretend without being genuine some of these are just foundational things I like to share in this that this worship and service to the creature more than the Creator if we can do that it'll get it'll allow us to model something but not be genuine about it so it says that they changed now if you could just look at this first part here they changed the truth of God that means to change it means to exchange one thing for another it means to transform so it's a cause to take the form of it's a very interesting phrase they change the truth Althea of God which is truth into aive and that word there is pseudos so they change the word word of God into pseudos which is a conscious intentional falsehood whatever or whichever that is not what it seems to be it's a change into another form into a form that it actually isn't and in doing so it's perverted or deceitful and those are the things we identified as Abomination so this Greek word pseudo it's a word that we're we're familiar with in terms of something that is a pseudo have you ever heard it as a noun I'm not sure if you have maybe we're used to hearing it as pseudo as a word forming element that kind of points to something that is false or that's only in appearance only and it's not to deceive or to cheat or to an untruth but a pseudo is a false or spirous thing especially a person falsely claiming Divine Authority that's its original meaning I think you're probably all jealous of my cup now I am drinking hot tea because my allergies have gotten my throat feeling funny relax if it's co we're all immune by now but to be a pseudo is something that is false and that was used originally because it's scriptural meaning of one that is turning the truth of God into a pseudo it has to do with one who claims to be divine Authority but falsely so in our modern parlament that what we would probably say is something that is imitated or exaggerated something that is pretentious or insincere so that's what I'm looking at in terms of a pseudo Christ what they've done here is they have transformed the truth into a falsehood they change changed the truth into a lie now maybe to help you understand what's being presented here is they make a lie or falsehood appear as truth so you can't if you have the truth truth is immutable it's especially as it relates to God in his word and his character you can't change truth so what do you do you take a lie and you make it look like truth I remember brother John La Fontaine telling a story many years ago of how uh truth was uh walking into a city and saw a nice little place to swim and so he took his clothes off and went for a swim and as he was swimming a lie came by and put on truth's clothes and went into the city so he says a lie is uh has truth's cloth on but in the heart in the end it is a lie now if you'd look at John chap 14 verse verse 6 for me and then Mark 13:22 those two places I want to go to see this phrase pseudo Christ let's first begin here in John 14:6 how they make a lie appears truth Jesus says unto them I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so when they turn the truth into a lie they've taken Christ and they've they've falsified something and presented it as Christ they've taken a lie and said this is the truth that's where you get the pseudo from I am the way the truth and the life they've changed the truth of Christ the reality of Christ and they've and they have cast that aside and taken a lie and present that as truth or as Christ in Mark chap 13: 22 it says for false Christ and false prophets this word in the original is the pseudo Christ pseudo Christos pseudos Christos for there shall be false Christ and false prophets that will arise and shall so show signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the elect so where I'm drawing this idea of pseudo Christ from they're not really Christ they pretend to be Christ they're not really truth they just purport to be truth but in the heart at their core they are a mistruth or a lie it says pseudo profits they act as divinely inspired prophets they utter falsehoods under the name and the pretense of being divinely inspired so it's not just false Christ but it's false prophets these pseudo prophets pseudo Christ they purport to be something and notice they purport to be anointed or Christ or they purport to be prophets and they do it as a means of seducing another into unbelief false Christ and false prophets will do things and purport to be something in order to seduce that's what a pseudo does they purport to be something that they're not in 2 Corinthians 11: 3 and 4 but I fear lest by any means as the serpent begil Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ for he that cometh preacheth another Jesus what would it be a pseudo Christ if they preach another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him what is the what is this pseudo Christ it's another Jesus and he's not saying that they preach another Jesus in the sense that they say oh I know this Jesus is really cool but you should meet the Jesus from Syria no they will purport to be preaching Christ and because it changes Christ it is a so-called another Christ another Jesus and it's done to corrupt or what It ultimately does is it corrupts our faith in the word of God and this is what we could parallel to what happened in the beginning he's saying that what he is concerned about is that as the serpent beguiled Eve and just subtly corrupted her faith that another Jesus we might be patient with it and bear with it and it has this ability to corrupt our own faith Galatians chap 1: 6 and 7 I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel we could say another Jesus another gospel but here he says which is not another other words because there is no other gospel there is no other Christ another Jesus is not really another Jesus it's something false per purporting to be Jesus which is not another but there's be some that trouble you and would pervert turn around change the gospel of Christ and he says they'll trouble you which means to agitate you to take away the calmness of mind to cause this inner turmoil it make you feel anxious or strike you with fear so they want to throw the gospel into a different form they want to Fashion it in in a shape that it's actually not and to adulterate the word of God by mixing it here Paul specifically talking about mixing it with works of the law so it changes the nature and composition of the word it changes the nature and composition of Christ let's pull from here and pull from here and it forms something that in itself he says will trouble you and cause you turmoil and C cause you anxiety the way that it says it here that he'll come in a very subtle way and he's concerned that if you will entertain another Christ it'll trouble you if you'll give it room if you'll give it space to work if you'll if you'll ponder it if you'll believe its lies if you allow something to throw the gospel into or paint the gospel in a different picture by mixing things in it it takes away your inner peace Amen in 2 Corinthians 11: 1314 and 15 for such are false Apostles deceitful workers I want you to focus in on that phrase deceitful workers and as deceitful workers they transformed themselves into the Apostles of Christ these would be pseudo Apostles because they're deceitful workers they couldn't be true Apostles and being deceitful workers uh they are working in a a way to present themselves as one way here they transform themselves they turn themselves into the form of an apostle of Christ then he inserts this in verse 14 and don't Marvel at this because Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of Light he presents himself as light he presents himself as truth he presents himself as one that has understanding yeah hath God not said and this is why he said it and this is the reason behind it therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose ends shall be according to their Works deceit F Works their end is going to be according to what they do now this puts a false anointed one or even a sudo Christ into a very alarming category that they're not going to appear as Angels of Darkness but they'll appear as angels of light they transform themselves into Apostles so there's pseudo Christ pseudo Apostles pseudo prophets who will present truth in a certain way and present themselves in a particular way all for the purpose of dis seat and these pseudo christs if you'll look at 1 John chapter 3 I I I really want to be able to nail this down through the scripture before we go further but pseudo Christ are not where we're wanting to zero end on this and remember I'm speaking to the bride of Christ I'm not trying to call you out as being a pseudo Christ that's not my goal today at all I don't believe I'm doing that but pseudo Christ are not in the world but they try to get as Clos to the word as they can pseudo Christ if I could put it this way this is uh at the core here and I'm going to use Cain and you're already picking up on some of these things here as you look at this but pseudo Christ I want to ident where you'll find them and what they're identified as are unbelievers pretending to be Believers so we're going to draw a little bit from Brother bram's teaching on three kinds of Believers so they pretend as deceitful workers they pretend for the purpose of destroying faith faith or causing the believer to stumble so a believer is impersonated by the unbeliever are you following me now pseudo Christ or pseudo bride or anything pseudo or fake or false or something purporting to be something that's not or impersonating something a True Believer you have a True Believer but when that believer is impersonated by an unbeliever it creates a hybrid called a makeb Believer so we say there's three categories of people there's the believer and there's unbeliever and we would put those in categories because we feel that we could identify them one that rejects the word of God outright another one that claims to believe the word outright but if you take an unbeliever who tries to be a believer he produces this middle category of a mate believer where he has hybrid the True Believer by joining it to an unbelieving heart and here we see in 1 John chapter 3 Cain was a make believer not as Cain verses 12 and 13 not as Cain who is of that Wicked one he himself was a hybrid and slew his brother and where slew he him why did he slay him because his own Works were evil and his brother's righteous so he says Marvel not my brethren if the world hate you Cain was a hybrid between the woman and a serpent and in being a hybrid between the woman and the serpent he is now bred between what should have been the pure and something else he is a make believer when Cain brought forth of the fruit of the ground he worshiped and served without faith he did not have a revelation of God's will so when he worshiped he didn't worship as an unbeliever but yet he didn't worship as a True Believer when presented with an opportunity to worship correctly he resisted it so what was he he was a makeb Believer so a make believer or the make believer is a unbeliever that masquerades as a Believer and you'll find them among other believers a wolf in sheep's clothing among other wolves is just inviting an attack and so the make believer is an unbeliever who's paraded himself as a Believer among other believers Judas is another one that is identified in the word of God as a make believer again not one that outright rejects the word of God but one that is a hybrid in Mark chap 14: 18 Jesus sitting down uh there here at one of his last meals with the disciples and they sat and did eat Jesus said verily I say unto you one of you which eateth with me shall betray me' so it was one that was at the table Judas was not uh in the halls of another Court he was not in the government of Rome he was not even within the Pharisees or the Sadducees he was one that sat amongst them as a disciple Jesus said in John chap 6: 70 and 71 have not I chosen you and one of you is a devil well that's putting it in plain language and though this is early on in the writing of John John gives us tells us who it is he spake of Judas the scary the son of Simon for he is not for he it was that should betray him being one of the 12 I love how John never really calls himself out but he's always quick to name other people Peter gets it Judas gets it but John is just the one that Jesus loved and you just have to guess I wonder who he's talking about have I not chosen you but one is a devil and it is Jesus who was one of the twel so notice how close this comes that whenever in the very beginning when a man and a woman have children but one is born of The Serpent and born by the will of Satan it's not something from the outside that attacked but it was something from the family within and here you have a a spirit or you have one who is betraying and he is one of the 12 there's a lot of things brother brah says about Cain and Abel and Judas and Jesus they're Brothers in the same church and I'm not saying this to cause us to try to figure out who in the church directory is a Judas and who's a make believer and wondering if there's ever going to be another tab where it says families birthdays and make Believers and and if you ever if you get on probation you're put into this category and there's an asterisk or your name why is my name a different color well we're trying to figure out whether or not you're a genuine believer but he said that in the seat of discrepancy the enemy joins church and becomes very Orthodox in a Creed or something it's the enemy who will join and become very Orthodox but that's discrepancy anything that interferes with that strain of the genuine truth of God's word the make believer is a hybrid believer with the fake faith and he can be very adamant about certain things but notice how he says that this enemy will join church and then interfere with that strain of genuine truth of God's word this is the goal of a hybrid is to interfere with the genuine anything that is mixed or anything that is solidated the purpose is to take away that which is pure and to confuse it or to to degrade it Judas was there there as one of the 12 this is the effect of this make believer John 13:2 and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him he's now influenced by the devil when we Are Born Again by the word of God and we have his Spirit dwelling in us we can be influenced driven to do minor things that we don't want to do we can make mistakes but when we make those mistakes we repent amen but here one who has a is a make believer can be driven to actually betray truth we can make mistakes but we or a mistake wouldn't be saying well I don't believe there's anything such thing as God and just going ahead and living that way and then well I'm sorry I I made a mistake I should have never done that we're talking about one that is going to oppose truth interfere with the strain of the truth of God's word the devil now puts it in the heart of Judas to betray Christ it's a strong word there's one of you here who will betray me there's one of you who is a devil the devil then puts it in the heart of Judas to betray Christ now this is where I'm having to take kind of a a fast forward a little bit so you can see how this directly impacts the True Believer in Luke chap 22: 47 to 50 we find ourselves here in the garden and Jesus is praying and he's speaking H and he's encouraging the disciples and they're having the convers ation and while he yet spake this is in the Garden of Gethsemane this is at the very moment that he is betrayed Behold a multitude and he that was called Judas one of the 12 this is the one that betrays him this is the one who was a devil this is the one that the devil has now put it in the heart of Judas to betray him went before them and Drew near unto Jesus to kiss him that Judas kiss what a what a what a action he told them this is how I'm going to identify the one that I'm betrayed I will kiss him and Jesus said unto him Judas betray us thou the son of man with the kiss and then the disciples who are of the TW but they're not the one that's a devil they're not the one that has betrayed him when they which were about him saw what would follow they said to him Lord shall we Smite with the sword should we defend you should we go to battle here and what happens is Peter draws his sword it's described here in verse 50 and one of them smok the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear what it what happened is the action of the Judas caused Peter to act out of character and to actually fight against what Christ had been prophesying over and over again needed to happen so we need to be very sensitive to how the make believer is going to act up in an acting up he's wanting to draw you off sides he's wanting to get you worked up or get you thinking about something or get you really really defensive you're not the one betraying Christ but you draw your sword seemingly in defense of Christ but what has provoked you is not Christ himself who said it must be that I uh give my life and this is going to happen but it's your response to the make believer this is that thorn or the bur that needling that agitation that the make believer can be the make Believers we're using the phrase pseudo Christ and that may be a really strong word but I wanted that to kind of catch in our heads but the make believer is a fabrication it's a hybrid it's an unbeliever pretending to be a believer and it's meant and used for the purpose to dissuade you it's used for the purpose of discouraging you or deceiving you if you don't like to think in terms of you being the genuine believer and somebody else being the make believer it's the make believer in you that exist to try to discourage you it's your own thoughts as a shadow of that person who's now dead and buried in the sea of forgetfulness that kind of hovers around in your memory and it's meant to discourage you and dissuade you or deceive you 1 Timothy 4: 1 and two now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter time some shall depart from the faith why will they depart from the faith they give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils these seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speak lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with the hot iron they depart from from the faith because of Seduction acts 20:30 just some quick scriptures here to look at this uh this principle of this thought of Seduction influences very near us also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them make themselves prophets they make themselves leaders and what did what do they get they get pseudo Brides for pseudo Christ also of your own selves of your own uh people of your own congregations of your own beliefs and those that may be near you they will rise up and speak things that change or pervert the gospel of Christ and they do it to bring people to themselves 1 Corinthians 11: 19 for there must be also heresies among you that heresy means Visions among you that they which are proved may be made manifest among you refers to separatists who set up their own tables and they try to distinguish themselves through their unique doctrines and teachings they they'll subtly change the message and maybe they'll do it at the beginning uh in a way of just I'm trying to bring clarification but give it enough time and eventually it's such a huge departure from truth that if nobody catches it at the beginning and they stay steadfast with the word they can find themselves totally off the word of God and deceived into a heresy a seducing Spirit doctrines of devils lies in hypocrisy in other words it's a lie presented as truth a lie with truth closing on there will be divisions arise among you men who separate themselves or set up their own tables but he says this is done this is remarkable statement it's done so that they which are approved may be made manifest among you in other words it'll prove your character can you give me that that slide again there for First Corinthians I the division reveals character it's that it's that make believer that God uses to bring out the True Believer in 2 Timothy chapter 2: 18 who concerning the truth have aired saying the resurrection is passed this would be a false Doctrine this would be a mistruth this would be somebody who's not preaching against Christ being the Messiah but preaching M the Messiah and the Christ in a way to change the truth and they're saying oh but this Resurrection is passed and because they perverted the truth it overthrew the faith of some notice that phrase to overthrow the faith of some somebody who teaches the word of God incorrectly may be sincere and may not in their heart s have evil intent or evil motive but there's no level where false Doctrine is innocent and it shouldn't be where we get all nasty and costic about it it's like I want to I want to I want to honor the word of God I want to keep the message pure I don't want to interpret the Bible for my own purposes and God helped me to discern truth help me to know what truth is and and let me not be dismissive if the if the word of God is being changed and presented in a way to just feel like well we can make that piece fit in the overall puzzle false Doctrine only serves to seduce and and and false Doctrine only serves to corrupt or defile it will overthrow or cause Faith to fall that overthrow means to be laid down overthrow pressed down hinder the faith of some well could you imagine if a preacher got up here whether it be me or maybe somebody that you really look up to or more confidence in and they got up and said I'm here to tell you now the Rapture is over and the last have been translated and we're all left behind a and what that might do to cause you to think we've missed it what's happened that's this is just a he's saying that some had been told the resurrection has passed and it shook their faith their faith was overthrown now if you'll turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 10 veres 1-6 there's a parallel I'm not going to be able to get through the entirety of this story today but I want to use the Exodus now as a parallel of this makeb believer the pseudo Christ and how that it's impacting it's very near it's going to be right there with us and how The Exodus gives us a great example of this 1 Corinthians chapter 10: 1-6 moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and the language is all and all passed to this sea and were all baptized into Moses and the cloud in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank all of that spiritual rock that follow him and that rock was Christ it's great movement this great Exodus and all are participating in the Supernatural aspects of it they're under the cloud they pass to the Sea they're baptized in this in the cloud and in the sea they eat the same spiritual meat they eat the quail they eat the Mana they drink from the same Rock and that rock was Christ verse five but with many of them God was not well pleased what happened what what does it take to please God with sin you cannot please God with unbelief you cannot please God what they were receiving as far as the quail and the man and these Supernatural things it was not being mixed with faith and when they heard it and when they were told it and when they experienced it God was not pleased because they lacked faith for they were overthrown in the wilderness despite all these Supernatural happenings they are laid low and they die Jesus said your fathers did eat man in the wilderness and they are all dead they were overthrown in the wilderness now Paul is telling Timothy there's some that are among you there's those that will rise up of their own themselves there's going to be those that depart from the faith there's going to be those who have heresies among you there's going to be those who speak perverse things and in doing so it'll overthrow or hinder or bring low the faith of some and in The Exodus the faith of many were overthrown and they died in the wilderness in verse six he says now these things were our examples to intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted this example of those in The Exodus who all do this and all do that and all do this and all do that but they were overthrown they are an example that we should not lust after evil things so it was their lust for evil things that caused their faith to be overthrown so The Exodus is an example to us it is there for us to realize just as their lust LED their faith to be degraded to be overthrown we cannot let ourselves experience the same there's a pattern that evolves in this Exodus where we can look at how their faith was overthrown and in Numbers Chapter 11: 4 to6 it says and the mixed multitude that was among them fell austing this mixed multitude was just a it kind of means a collection or a rabble it's the diverse group of non-israelites who were following Israel in The Exodus and could you imagine if you were not an Israelite and you were in Egypt and you saw what was happening you might be like I'm going to get on board with this especially if they started taking things of your ears and you're like well I figure I might as well go out with you but there were many that left who were not Israelites so when the Bible says that there were many that were overthrown in the wilderness it's actually speaking of Israel but it's not just Israel that leaves there's a multitude of others that follow with them and it says and the children of Israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat do you catch what happened here happens really really fast you need to see it if you're looking at it there in numbers 11:4 there's a mixed multitude amongst Israel and they start to lust they don't know they're not Jews by ethnicity they not Jews by birth these things AR really real to them as it would be to a Jew because listen to be a Jew then you just had to be born one so there there there is that's what so remarkable about uh being an Israelite or a Jew is your religion is your birth uh it's everything was encompassing in it so it shares a great type for us but now these are people that were born of other nations and have other beliefs and did not serve the true God and they start lusting and the Bible says that the children of Israel begin to weep and ask for flesh to eat we remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leaks and the onions and the garlic the garlic but our soul is dried away but there's nothing at all beside this Mana before our eyes man they really they had become jaded bread bread from Heaven which is said to taste in their uh their lore their tradition taste like whatever they wanted and they got tired of it maybe they just needed a better imagination but here they go lusting and the Bible already tells us why it's because somebody was complaining and it wasn't the children of Israel initially but it was the make believer amongst them the one that started out who was driven by the flesh driven by lust and it influenced the Israelites to begin to look at the Mana differently I could imagine at one point it's like this is what our God does right here he gives us Ros for breakfast lunch and dinner in the form of what appears to be nothing more than a tortilla but it tastes like whatever I want it to you can eat the Mana for an appetizer for the main course and for dessert and it was Supernatural but then all someone had to do is start to act get them to question it and just look at it differently well you do realize it's the same thing every every morning and they don't played it properly and the timing is really really awful and they begin to think very very differently about the meals they're eating and it's the makeb believer who lusted and is now calling those who are under the promise to lose their faith it's the make believer that'll cause you to complain it's the make believer that causes you to lust it's the make believer who hand you the question mark and suggest where you ought to put it in Jude verses 3 4 and 5 beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to Rite unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith there's only one Faith there's only one truth there's only one way of righteousness contend for stand for the faith which was once delivered under the Saints for there are certain men crept in unawares subtly they crept in they snuck in these men are described as who were before of old ordained to condemnation ungodly men certain men crept in it says and change turn the grace of our God into lasciviousness they changed the gospel of Christ they're not on the outside protesting not on the outside throwing Spears they're on the inside now questioning changing the grace of God in lascivious and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ I will therefore put you in remembrance and now notice the parallel put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that that shouldn't come as a surprise to you believed not maybe to put it in a really strong way make belief is a greater danger than blatant unbelief it's covert it creeps in unawares this it's uh make belief is undercover unbelief right it's what it is as we said before uh that it's uh make belief is unbelief with up on trying to present it it's not real truth and I guess it was the PLS who said in that good or whatever it is they do when they hear something they really like the preacher does that's where I got it from make belief for ourselves is a greater danger and in The Exodus the children of Israel were caused to doubt and to question in by those who fell austing verse 16 there in Jude we'll read a few more verses here it says these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lust and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having men's persons and admiration because of Advantage a lot to unpacked there the carnality of it the politics of it but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before of the Apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lust these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit these are ones that will carve out something it's this uh a little departure deviation and then it's come Feast at this table because that's what the separatist the heresies among you it's not uh laying down all ideas and laying down all false doctrines and coming to the one true table which the prophet has set up and asking us to come and eat of this particular Feast but it's coming out and setting up your own table and then asking that a bigger Circle be drawn to include him they separate themselves he says they do not have the spirit I'm I'm going to cut the sermon short today because I think it would do us some good maybe to think about these things and not go too much further into the Exodus but in The Exodus there was clear influence that caus the one who ought to have overcome to fail and it was written for our example not that we would have an example of our failure but the example of our over how we overcome not that we would look back and say well there's going to be those who are under the promise those that are born again those who cross to this and did that and they're not going to make the they're not going to make the Rapture no I'm not presenting that at all we're looking back and seeing through this lens that God has given us to recognize the tricks of the devil and say that's how he works and because he's going to open our eyes to how unbel Bel Works within our hearts and how make belief Works within our hearts or works in the in the the atmosphere around us in the environments that we're a part of and it all works to try to dis dissuade us discourage us deceive us to overthrow our faith to to push it down in 2 Corinthians chapter 6: 14 to8 be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers to be unequally yed is to join with them in one Spirit you can't they have a different nature they have a they have a different desire that would cause conflict well the make believer is of The Same Spirit as the unbeliever so be not unequally Yol together with unbelievers for what Fellowship notice this run of comparisons what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what communion hath light with Darkness what Concord with C hath Christ with b or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols that's a lot the fellowship communion Concord part agreement of righteousness light Christ belief in the temple of God they have none with unrighteousness Darkness bile Infidel Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate amen sayith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and will be a father and you and you shall be my sons and daughters sayith the almighty the word of God calls for a total separation from unbelief it is a separation from unbelief we cannot mix with anti-faith I know that we've probably got this figured out to where well what we want to do is when we separate ourselves we're separating ourselves from the person but if you if you don't recognize the spirit of unbelief if you don't recognize the spirit that is anti-faith then then we become of no use to who are subject to the spirit we just write off anybody who doesn't believe like us and we all do it in the name of the scripture but it's a sensitivity to recognize I have to separate myself from all unbelief I cannot mix my faith with something that is anti-faith and just as the Bible says be not unequally yolked to yoke yourself with an unbeliever would be something that would be unlo unequal it's the same with make belief we can't out have that Fellowship communion that part that agreement that Concord speaks of Harmony and unity and commonality we cannot do that with make belief remember a make believer is an unbeliever pretending to be a believer what you'll find in The Exodus is the make believer ultimately was the one who couldn't follow all the word of God in 1 Corinthians chapter 5: 11-13 I'm sharing this these these next few scriptures I'm just sharing these uh for wait for you to consider but now I have written unto you not to keep Company If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or Covetous or an idolator or a or a drunkard or an extortioner with such a one know not to eat it's heavy stuff isn't it don't you wish we had a list some of the things I do there's a black list of attorneys you can't use and uh I don't check that list I want to know if I'm on it no they uh I know that I'm not on it because I continue to do work for this the for this agency but there's they they blacklist somebody they don't trust anymore and it makes it very easy if they're on the list you can't you can't be used and some of you going to try to find it and in some ways it would be good if we could just be told who do who should who should I not mix with and who is it that I shouldn't have anything to do with but you know let's dispatch with trying to identify people in particular but just notice how heavy this is don't keep company or sit down to eat with a person who claims to be a brother but it fornicates as Covetous as idolator a a drunken or extortioner now at the very least what I want you to do is to recognize that Paul is identifying some Lev some influence some danger line that we ourselves are presented with if we keep company or mix with someone of that for what have I to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within but them that are without God judges therefore put away from among yourselves that Wicked person the Bible teaches that it's done for the purpose that the one who is wicked and doing the sinning could recognize that something is wrong I believe that there has to be a Christlike way that we can measure ourselves my wife and I were discussing this morning on what it means that charity thinketh no evil and when you're presented with evil Behavior by somebody or somebody does something and and you feel that it's for the wrong motive or the wrong objective or there's something that's not right are we to just kick that out of our minds are we to learn from it to understand it how do we wrestle with it this scripture presents to us a similar situation that I'm to put a wicked person from among myself whatever that might be literally Paul is saying that the wicked person the make believer has a leav influence hallelu Hebrews 12:16 says a fornicator is a profane person or our F person as Esau Esau as a fornicator sold his Birthright for a morsel of meat the message teaches us that Esau himself too Cain Judas Esau were make Believers and all because of how hungry he was he was quick to despise the birthright and sell it for a bowl of soup these are strong influences 2 Timothy 3: 5 to8 they have in this end time these have a form of goddess they take on the shape and form of God they take on the pretense as a Christian they have a form of godess they are pseudo Christ but they don't have the power of Christ because they've denied the power of Revelation from such turn away do not behold them do not admire them do not let them influence you I think it should give us great pause the people that we listen to in their podcast there's a wonderful brother in Tucson named brother Jordan Peterson who started a podcast and watched his numbers just Skyrocket not quite realizing why but even though uh Dr Jordan Peterson might have some really neat takes on things that's not the gospel you want to swallow wholesale and I can't remember some of these other ones that are out there the Kirks and the Ben and the Von John's or whatever the people out the Joe rogans they might have a lot of talking points that speak to something in your heart but you have to realize those things can solely your minds to to very great levels those should be the ones that we would naturally have a very strong all the filters on when it comes to listening to those we should not be so quick to digest them turn away it's saying but not just from those who are overtly in the world and and espousing and and sharing things that are ungodly or or destructive but to turn away even from those who have a pretense of Christianity for this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with diverse lust there is the influence now of The Pretender the make the pseudo Christ creating a pseudo bride ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as Janice and jambers with stood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith what's the one thing I like to always point out when we refer to jennice and J how did they withstand Moses they didn't call him a false prophet they just did what he did they just impersonated there's a lot of men today that'll try to impersonate the prophet with gifts of discernment prophecy that fail and never repent now what kind of influence would that be what are you opening up your spirit to now I wouldn't necessarily just judge it in the moment look at the trajectory of something and many people find themselves there is one that we might have all called brother Edgar Rosco for many many years and thought of him as a as a brother that preaches the message and maybe he got off into these different ways but now they call him Elohim and and uh I was fellowshiping with brother Tim do the other day and he referred to brother Edgar Rosco and I said I believe he's Elohim don't misgender him and so I thought well there's a new a new take but how do people get there slowly subtly and you become numb maybe even in your own country you don't want to accept the fact that this person you looked up to this person you love this person that God used mightily is now prophesying falsely and everything the whole story gets changed so that they're never wrong wow Janice and jambre withstood Moses by impersonation that's what the make believer does he withstands Truth by impersonating truth not having it Hebrews chapter 3: 12 to 19 Brothers if you could come to your instruments we'll we'll close here and then we'll get into The Exodus and another service go back to the Book of Numbers take heed Brethren lest there be any of you in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the Living God now that's that's remarkable isn't it that he would say you take heed think about yourself think about what's in your heart and consider whether or not there be any unbelief because it's unbelief that causes us to depart from God so we must exhort one another daily why it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin this is what unbelief will do it's deceitful and it hardens us for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast un the end now this is hearkening back to the resurrect excuse me The Exodus which he's already referenced earlier just even in this chapter while it said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke how how did they provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses so some provoked but not all but with whom was he grieved 40 years who was it was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness this is what Paul described as their faith being overthrown in the [Music] [Music] wilderness it's those that Jews said did afterwards believed not and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but them that believed not sin is unbelief he says so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief and I want to go back to numbers 11 and I want you if you have time follow through in The Exodus you could go to chapters 13 and uh 14 of numbers and even carry it on through maybe just picking spots and reading and you'll find it was the influence it was that influence that ultimately caused people to reject the truth that there was going to be a crossing over our faith must remain unsoed by unbelief it cannot be influenced by it cannot be motivated by cannot be shaped by pseudo Christ one of the big biggest dangers to us as Believers is not the unbeliever that bold outspoken blatant unbeliever but it's the unbeliever that assumes the character of a True Believer and becomes the source of friction becomes the force the source of criticism becomes the source of uh seducing spirits and again this is true this is just the reality we have there's three kinds of Believers and there's those that reject there's those that pretend to accept and then there's those that do accept and if that reality sometimes has been used to abuse and to used as a a a a bully Club to bully people well look at it within your own self look at it within your own self just how easy it is to wrestle and to fight and when you would do good there's evil present with you what is it it's that one who was born by the first birth still has breath still has memory still has affection it's that make believer that wants to influence the faith that you have in your soul and he's the one that you've got to bring under subjection so if it makes you anxious to look without just look within if it makes you anxious to look within get over it look within and recognize that what I'm ministering to you today is not a metric by which we can begin to measure others and determine whether or not they make Bel but something that we can use to try to keep the forces of unbelief at Bay to recognize that instead of saying that person's an unbeliever that person's a makeb Believer recognize the power of anti-faith to take a believer and cause them to begin to act as a conduit of make belief that they could recognize that we could all see together we have been given a word which is right a word that is correct and I want to stand for that I want to support it I want to live it and it's make belief it's the pseudo Christ that may be leading pseudo brides and I don't want to jump into the parade oh my goodness this one looks fun and next thing you know it's going it's descending down meanwhile there's a genuine Christ with a genuine bride there's been many churches churches Brides brides a lot of pseudos there's been a lot of pseudo Christ there's been a lot of pseudo Brides but there's come one in this hour the revelation of Jesus Christ there's come one in this hour and it's calling forth the true bride and the devil wants to use the make believe the make believe the make believe to keep you from going all in on Jesus Christ God help us today let's stand to our feet brother Michael if you don't mind getting ready just uh need a little bit of help with my throat thank you for your attentiveness today I'm excited about getting into the Exodus on this and just how they were influenced the spirit of unbelief if we could just bow our heads in a word of Prayer [Music] let's bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord today as we close this service as we worship for a few moments afterwards and as we are dismissed we can say within our hearts Lord I believe in you and as our brother said one day in the scripture Lord I believe help thou my unbelief perhaps Lord the reason why unbelief is so powerful in our lives as we look inward is because we mistook it for belief because it's pretending and Lord I pray that none of us would be confused by unbelief that we would not be deceived by unbelief but that we could just call it out for what it [Music] is it's a failure of intellectual Faith it's a failure of emotional Faith so Lord even if we could just realize that sometimes it's just our minds it's just a hope so but dig down deep to that spot that's within us that says Lord I believe you at all cost I believe you and let Faith take its final resting place on your word and nothing else and Lord as I struggle today to bring forth this thought in Greater Clarity and perhaps the same intensity that you revealed it to me I trust that we could all take it in the balance that it's intended that these pseudo Christ these false christs these things that pretend to be Christian pretend to be m message purport to be true they're the things that end up influencing us the most it's where this battle has evolved Lord if there's a brother here today who's addicted to something evil and something filthy Lord we know to fight that battle through prayer we know to fight that battle maybe a demon needs to be cast out but Lord It's these religious ideas it's this false doctrines it's the pretense of sincerity it's those things that can so subtly hold our faith back lord I don't want to I wouldn't want anyone here to exaggerate in their response like a Peter and draw their sword and go to cut and no Lord that's not it at all we cannot respond to make belief as a make believer help us Lord to stand our ground for the sake of the one that's pretending for the sake of the one who has not renounced all unbelief for the sake of one who's caught up in error the one that's caught up in movement the one that's caught up in a cult the one who's being deceived led to sleep Lord help us to not be drawn off sides to be too defensive and to be CTIC to be Antichrist in ourselves Lord I pray that you bless us today with your presence as we worship seal these things in our hearts as only you can we commit each one to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
