TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Joshua chap 10 verse 12 down and then Mark chapter 10 Joshua we start then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said and he said um excuse me yeah excuse let me start then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel son stand thou still upon gibon and that moon in the valley of aalon and the son stood Stood Still In the and the moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jesa so the son stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before it or after it that the Lord hecken unto the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel amen Mark chapter 10 verse 49 Mark 10:49 and they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and it was and a great multitude of people blind bimus the son of os Sat by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus th son of David have mercy on me and many charg him that he should hold his peace but he cried out the more a great deal thou son of David have mercy on me and Jesus Stood Still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good Comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away His Garment Rose and came to Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto him what will thou that I should do unto thee and the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy [Music] way thy faith have made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way may the Lord bless the reading of his word shall we please be seated [Music] praise the Lord hallelujah so once again it's a privilege to be in the house of the Lord and I in particular also want to thank the almighty God for this opportunity to stand before his people last year by this time I was very sick I could not even walk so it's a great privilege for me that the Lord pull me through and uh he has brought me this far yes amen I was sharing with Pastor the last year by this time I have just gone through a surgery prostrate surgery when they said my prostrate became so big and for 9 months I was wearing ctia 9 months and it was very difficult for me I gone through the surgery and uh at a point even I could not walk I have to be using the worker to walk it was so difficult at a time that I could not raise my leg or my feet and put it here to this little step and walk it was so difficult that at a time I could when I lie down I could not t this way or that way it was so difficult that if I lie down somebody has to pull me my wife has to pull me it was so difficult that if I have to sit in the car I have to find a way to sit backward and then they have to raise my leg and put it in and here to put it in it was so difficult even to eat I was it was difficult for me after the surgery has been done some few weeks two or three we I had uh an infection they it was a blood infection and so I have to stay in the emergency for about 6 days when the surgery was done about 5 hours surgery they distract me the next day but when I had this this complication or this problem I have to stay there for 6 days and it happened that I went to the hospital the doctor asked me to do some uh cystogram like a scan or whatever and so I went to the hospital with my wife and uh I was on the table for the cogram to be done or be taken and then the table was just begin to shake as if somebody was shaking it and the doct what is happening I don't know and from there I didn't know what happened again I only saw myself in the emergency so my wife said they called her because I was I knew I was shaken so they called her they call who brought himo okay she's the one and then she went out and then she I was on the table there and then it seems all my system was shutting down kidneys my wife is a midwife n so and the nurses and doctors she was there and everything was going down but she was praying and because God has not yet finished with me he brought me back yes when I was told back in Ghana I went to the doctor and uh they found out that um the problem with the prostate and then also the doctor said no there is cancer if your prostate is divided into 10 there is a portion one portion that has cancer where he and he begin to come me down you don't have to be afraid don't have to worry it's a little something but I was not afraid because when he just mentioned cancer the only thing that came to me do you fear cancer CU I remember the prophet preached that and the prophet told us there is no fear there is no virtue in fear right and fear only torments right so the Lord help me and no I was not afraid but I was just having pains and just pains so finally the brothers like brother B coffee they got to hear about that and then he advised that no brother Timothy if you can get out get out now to come we see our best will help to to see what the doctors we have doctors we have this so I came in so at this time I have to stay there and then uh it was very difficult and uh not e b to eat everything was just going down but once again the grace of God came down and he pulled me out of it because brother Bram said when God has not finished with you nothing can take you out of here I strongly believe in that am am I be in the flight when the plane is just just good and I sat down with somebody I told a brother brother B said that if God has not finished with us nothing can take us so I strongly believe in that and let us believe in that yes because we have not come here accidentally right somebody brought us here and the one that brought us here is mindful of us and I used to tell the people when the bible say that God is mindful of us it means his mind is full of you right mindful of you his mind is full of you we did not save ourselves but he save us and he has purpose in saving your life right and nothing can defeat that purpose of God so we as children of God we are told not to fear right the prophet of God said God don't want his children to fear right God wants his children to believe because to them that believe all things are possible so he wants you to believe no matter what happens around you God wants you to believe and I've spoken and encourag the brothers that um we should never try to compare ourselves with one another yes right don't compare yourself to anybody because you are not any body you are who you are yes right so it is not wise to compare yourself to anybody because we are all made differently for different purposes that's right my trial will not be your trial and your trial may not be my trial so it is not even for you to be asking why should it be me why should I suffer this why shouldn't you suffer that that should be the question if why you ask why should it be mean who should it be so don't compare yourself to anybody because Satan sometimes want us to pity ourselves to feel bad because if you look at yourself and you question why should it be me and you maybe you look at others say ah this one is okay this one is okay everybody is say why I me then you have self-pity and that is sin so don't compare your life to anybody because brother Bram said if you have a trial or a test from God you find favor with God right yeah and he said then God has has confidence in you and God knows that you will stand the test like job right right God has confidence in you it's not because God is against you it's because God laughes you is because God has confidence in you and remember when the enemy came to test job it was not job that called for the test it was God that called for it it was the Lord that told Satan have you considered my servant's job right that there is no like him yes a man that fearth God and andth Evil have you consider him you might have gotten everybody you might have gotten the young men and the young women the old and all the ages but what about job you that's my servant and God is proud of his people and God is Not Afraid for any of his own to be tested he allows it to prove a point to the enemy that this is mine and I love to read the scripture and the scripture said that Satan was speaking and he said to God he it is job serving God for nothing is it not because you have done this and you have done that for him and you've made a edge over him right I said praise the Lord how did he know that there was a edge over job how did he know that the door was locked how did he know he could not touch job because he tried many times and he failed so nothing can touch us and nothing can harm us and nothing can come to us unless the shepherd opens the door how did he know that there was a hedge of a job because he has tried on his own and he couldn't touch him right so God has to give the permission so if anything will come to you or to me God has to give the permission amen and he has a purpose for that so that you will be a witness and then the prophet said sometimes a witness must suffer a little yeah amen so God is mindful of us after this after even I wear the ceter for nine good months when they even took the ceter I have to wear Pampers for about a month praise the Lord I became a big baby baby boy praise the Lord but if I've not gone through this how will I be testifying and God allow it so that I can be here today and testify to you so that you will know he has not forgotten you so that you will know that whatever you might be going through through it's not permanent something yes sir it's just temporal very good the sun will soon rise and the Darkness will be despaired yes Hallelujah don't feel sad oh you think I prayed too much I prayed too long I've been serving God why should it happen to me because you are serving God that's why it happens yeah brother BR said The more loyal you are the more the test wow amen so in our trials and our difficulties let us put on cheerful attitude yes like I said the Bible told us one day Paul and Solas were thrown to jail because of the Gospel not because of anything that they have done but because of the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the same gospel that we believe in today they took them they beat them and they throw them into jail they have brues over their bodies but the Bible tell told us when they went to prison they decided to sing and worship God right in your trials you got to make a choice whether to sing whether to be happy or whether to complain whether to complain and Mama against God or to blame God why should this happen to me but Apostle Paul and Silas the Bible told us they begin to Worship the Lord they begin to sing praises and they sang Praises so much until other prisoners heard them singing and that's my problem that if they were singing and worshiping God in prison What About Us in church we think as if we are ashamed of what we are doing we sing as if we don't know what we are doing but this men were beaten and nobody has beaten us this morning this men were beaten this men has been their clothes have been torn this they have been disgraced in the public and they have thrown them into jail for nothing and they decided we will sing and they begin to sing two brothers two brothers and they sank and other prisoners had and singing and they sank so much until the walls and the doors and everything was shaken and they sang until the doors were open yet they have been beaten yet they have been disgraced may God help us yes amen so that when we are worshiping God we should worship god cheerfully with joy oh Hallelujah because it doesn't own us anything he has done all for us he paid the price for us he redeem us he's worthy of Praise he's worthy to be adored he's worthy he worthy he worthy all hell King Jesus all hell Emmanuel is the king of Kings and is the Lord of Lord we is redeemed will is people is depending on us there is one thing that God cannot do for himself God cannot worship himself he can't do it God is an object of worship the worship must come from his children from his subjects we are his subjects and we are created to worship the king let's worship him let's bless him let's exalt him let's glorify him amen hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord yeah you should never be ashamed to sing his Praises you should never be ashamed to worship him oh Hallelujah to be identified with [Music] him amen they Worship the Lord and they praise the Lord and they were happy the Bible told us in the book of Acts when the disciples went out and they were beaten they came back rejoicing not crying rejoicing that they have been accounted worthy to be beaten for Christ to suffer for Christ to be laugh at to be called names they came back rejoicing and they came back they said Lord see all that they are doing give us strength that with courage than ever before we will proclaim the gospel not running back yes not retreating right there is no retreating Christ we go forward no matter what is there hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord I love Jesus and I love his people and I just love to encourage the people let's go forward thank you Lord let's keep pressing on Oh Brother s he has a purpose yes think about it the Bible tells us when they sank and the doors open they stay in the prison right they didn't go out they could have run away but they stay right there because those that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God yes they could have gone out Peter was in prison Peter was was sleeping between two men and he was sleeping Two Soldiers one year one day and the Believers prayed the Believers were praying the Believers were praying and the Bible told us and the angel of the Lord came down midnight and I said the angel did not come midnight because he was afraid of the day yeah because the same God of the day is the god of the night right he's the many potent God he is the almighty God but he used to come at night time because the Believers were praying at that time and he decided because in answering prayer he is Sovereign nobody tells him what to do he does what he want to do because he has a reason and he has a purpose and he does everything for his own Glory Hallelujah and he came down and when he came down I told the people and he was not working like no he was not afraid when he came down he was in charge he was in control there is somebody that is in control he controls the Affairs of nature almighty God rules in the Affairs of men amen our God is our God yes he's our Lord he controls everything and if you have a God that controls everything why do you worry what's your problem what's your fear your God controls everything am our God is the creator he's the provider he's the almighty is's the all in all so why should we fear Hallelujah all you see this boy is getting out now praise the Lord Jesus what a mighty God we are serving he's so great he so mighty if if we believe that our God controls all things if you believe then why worry then what's your fear why are we worrying why are we living brother Brenham said God don't want us to be Memory he said he was talking about these spirals or whatever Robin and they were talking and they were whispering to one another and they said oh look at these human beings they are always sad look at these human beings every day with long faces yeah and one of them said maybe they don't have a God Like Our God but if you have the god like The Sparrows if you have the god that is the almighty God even in your trials in your afflictions you'll be cheerful hallelujah praise the name of the Living God oh Lord help us the angel of the Lord descended midnight and the chains fell off from Peter and I pray that your chains will also fall off yes your shackles will fall off that you'll be loose you have your Liberty Hallelujah that the Lord the presence of the Angel of the Lord made the chance to fall off delivered him lose him and the angel said Come Peter get up take your shoes take your jacket follow me Hallelujah and every door was open and I pray that your doors open also will be open so that you'll be free like God said let my people go so that they will serve me that you be free and be delivered from any bondage of sin and any bandage of fear and any bondage of worry knowing that you god reigns hallelujah praise be to God Amen I say today by God's grace I am standing here I said today God Grace has brought me this far he preserved my life because he has not finished with me and because he has not finished with you nothing can take you out of here hallelujah what a mighty God we are serving yes indeed he's great yes indeed he's Almighty Peter was taken out of prison Paul and Silas even when the prison doors open they were sitting down there yes what of Sunday said you remember Peter went out of prison why don't you people go quickly no you don't compare yourself to anybody right we are saved for different purposes Paul and Salah stayed and when the morning and the officer woke up and he saw the doors were open and he thought the prisoners have run away he took knife sword or whatever he wanted to kill himself but said no don't do it we are here and I believe that officer might have seen a lot of prisoners run away and he might have know the consequence that if you let anybody go you you replace him you exchange with your life so he wanted to kill himself but said no don't do any evil to your we are here H you are there yes sir what type of prisoners are these These are different prisoners the prisoners of Love prisoners of God prisoners of the word oh brother Bram said God is looking for prisoners to the word of God prisoners that will not do what they like what they think or what they feel or what anybody want or what anybody is doing prisoners that will just stay behind his [Music] word the man said the next thing that man said what must I do to be saved why did they go to prison they went there because of that man and his family if they had run away that man would have died his family would have been lost but because they stayed there that's why we have this verse of the scriptures amen yes amen what shall we do to be saved an apostle PA believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy household shall be saved right what of if they have run away do you know what the Bible talk about the soul brother BR said one Soul was 10,000s of this words one soul 10,000s of this words and the Bible tells us there is joy in heaven when one Soul come to repentance so one so me so much to God yes thank you Jesus amen Lord help us we should not lose our passion for Souls brother BR said we have a responsibility to tell somebody about Christ when we are saved we have a responsibility he said you cannot even C somebody unbeliever until you first witness that fellow you have a responsibility how many people have you tried to speak to oh don't go there brother how many people what are we living for why are we here is God save us and we are okay with it what about our loved ones what about our neighbors what about our colleagues in the place of work who is going to witness to them who is going to talk to them who is going to share with them wake up Church yeah very good let's be up and be do it because until the last El let come say we are tired of this word amen but until the last elect comes we are not going and who will bring in the last elect maybe you are the one who is the last elect maybe your neighbor maybe your uncle maybe your relation or somebody you meet on the street somewhere may the Lord help us hallelujah so that we be up and be doing so that we can do something for the kingdom of God so that we can we can do because if they don't come in we will not be ready to go the Bible say they our fathers of old they without us will not be made perfect right and we without those ones will not be made perfect right so saints of God may God help us and let us trust the Lord and don't come to a place where you think that uh why should this happen to me why if Apostle Paul and Sil had not gone to prison at that time that man would have been lost so God allow look at the way they were beaten look at the way they were treated and after this the message came to the officer let those men go and Paul said we are not going anywhere wow what type of prisoners are these yeah he said we are not going he said they took us they disgrace us they beat us in the public being Roman citizens and now you are telling us to go secretly look let them the man magistrate whoever put us here let them come wow let them come themselves to the prison we are not getting out of here oh God help us hallelujah and they came and begged him please we are sorry please please prison you can go wow the prison became the bses God help us yes we should not we should not give up we should not pity ourselves why no no no I don't believe in that no I don't believe in that I believe in trusting the Lord amen I believe in standing on God's word let me say this a little with you before I go when I was a young man I was about 26 when I got first marriage I married somewhere when was that I think 1984 yeah 1984 I got married 85 I lost my wife a Believer I was a young boy 26 year old that was the first time we lost somebody in our group we just young men and young women have come to believe the message of the hour and we're happy and preaching and everybody and and what what a shock yeah I was shaken we were troubled because not only that did she died she died when she was expecting so I lost my wife I lost my baby it was a big blow and in Africa there's a lot of superstitions especially for some somebody to die when he's expecting hey it's a big issue it's a big issue even today is a big issue what am I going to do and I look around and I everywhere SE to my goodness and then I was I was in the hospital that morning and uh I went to the hospital early in the morning to visit her andh the Nur said oh just wait your man and and then said ah they said the doctors might be I said for some time what is happening they didn't know what how to release they news to me I said wow so after I said something might have happened I went today oh they say yeah yester night about 11 oh goodness it was a big bro what am I going to do I said can I see the body yeah I said she's right on the bed there my goodness and I came and stood by the body I was crying but then something dropped into my heart God Don't Make Mistakes it's true and I said Lord I know you don't make mistakes and I know but it's not by mistake that my wife should go and I said God father if this is your way for me I will still serve you amen and thank God I'm still serving him yes I didn't say why should it be me my challenge is how am I going to face the word after they said this boy make so much noise talk here we were preaching against all denominations

there's a lot of superstitions and then my father comes in my uncles my aunties everybody want me to go and do some superstitions you have to that is they will take you to the beach see midnight naked they have to use sea water to Bath you all kinds of superstitions here but I said no I'm not going to do it I'm not going to do it they say why if you don't do it you will die I said what the Bible said to death will do part I said never do any evil to my wife if if she want to kill me that's fine but God said to death so I'm not going to no you have to be separated with the dead I said we are separated the Bible say this that's okay oh my father talk yeah you have to do the and they said no we can do this they can even go and take the water from the sea and they will bring it on they will

God want me to die let me die we should not be tormented with fear of death right amen no you no no I'm ready to die if God want me to go I'm ready to go what am I going to stay here for brother Bron said when God is finished with me I'm finish with this word we should stand on the word brother Brandon say our strength the strength of the believer in every age is is knowledge of the word of God and is adherence to the word of the Lord amen if you have the knowledge you know what God has said and you hold on to that and by that you fight the battle that's why you have to feed on the word because you are what you eat John was told to go to the angel take the book and eat the book and when you eat the book prophesy so friends we have so many books we have oh my goodness Lord help us yes when we believe the message back in our country we didn't even have sermon books right somebody get one seron book I remember just I have to copy seron book with pen take paper and copy when we listen

around us yes on tapes on your phones and everywhere what are we doing with it this material to make us ready to get us ready for the Rapture has been given to us what are we doing with the material Hallelujah glory to God someone say you are shouting too much you can also shout amen yes praise the Lord listen saints of God we got to wake up yes we got to wake up we must know who we are amen because your strength lays in knowing who you are yes amen amen if you don't know who you are and whom you have believed then you'll be tossed up and down right Hallelujah the importance of Revelation by the spirit of God to the True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation gives us prevailing power oh Hallelujah it gives you authority over the devil yes oh Hallelujah let's make Satan ashamed of himself amen for you to know that we are the redeem Jesus died for us we are no more in the Kingdom of Satan we are in the Kingdom of Light the kingdom of the Son of God we are Sons and Daughters of the king hallelujah praise the name of the Living God oh young man May God help us young women let's put in our strength let's put in our life this is life this is all to us yes oh Hallelujah I thank God for Calvary and I thank God for the message of the hour yes amen his grace is always sufficient stay with the word of the Lord don't move away from the word of the Lord no matter how much the Enemy Fight stay with the word of the Lord Brother Bram said Joshua stopped the s n is that right right somebody said all things are possible with God nothing impossible but all things are possible to you too all things are possible possible to you too because to them that believe all things are possible he said all things are possible he brought it right down to you and made you he said and if you only know what God was or who God is yeah well he said I am afraid that the church doesn't know their Authority I am afraid that Holy ghostborn men doesn't realize their Authority or the authority that God has permitted to the church Joshua stopped the Su by faith But Blind bimus sto the s o n by faith amen blind stop the s o n by faith we are taught without faith none of us can please the Lord without faith it is impossible to please God and the Bible tells us he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he is the rewarder of those that diligently seek him not sluggishly but diligently seek Him how we serving him we become too slothful we have to be up the doing yes Hallelujah be fent Hallelujah give your soul oh he worthy to be praised he said that we will serve the Lord with all our might yes with our spirit we our soul with everything that is in us he gave it to us we give it back to him amen let's s oh Hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy but that's okay it's only your thinkings so fine I don't care about what you think I'm concern about what he says and do you know by the way the only way that you can serve God is to lose your mind that's all if you don't lose your mind you cannot serve him you lose your mind and get the mind of Christ let this mind which was in Christ be in you so with your kind of man you can never serve God and you can never please God so what we need is the mind of Christ the mind of Christ is the word of God so you have to forsake your way forsake your thought forsake your opinions your ideas you must die to them and take what God says we must die to ourselves Church of the Living God Amen sometime we think oh we are doing God a favor by coming to church what whose favor you are doing you are doing yourself not God God is the creator it's a privilege he has given to us to serve him it's a privilege don't think you are doing something for God God is giving us opportunity privilege to serve him so that tomorrow you be somewhere better he a privilege to serve the Lord I'm so glad he took me I'm so glad oh my brothers and my sisters there are millions there are thousands millions when God pick you right right many people read the Bible they read the messages they read and this they don't see it they read it they don't see baptism we were doing it I was preaching Pentecostal Church Pentecostal group we were preaching Trinity all kinds of things but thank God for Malachi 4 yes that God open my eyes oh Hallelujah to know that God is not three God is one yeah oh Israel the Lord our God is one M praise the name of the Lord what are we saying you can stop the s o n amen by faith the prophet said huh by faith why he said faith is the most common thing there is Faith is the most common thing there is forget about your thought on it now Prophet is speaking he said faith is the most common thing there is how many say Amen to that that's the prophet speaking that is the mind of God that is the voice of the spirit am so whatever you have about faith whatever your thought is about faith the prophet of God said faith is the most common thing there is amen you can't even get a drink of water without faith you couldn't even come to the church or meeting without faith you cannot move your finger without faith he said when they had to apply the blood in Egypt they use H or ES whatever you call it brother BR said it was a common we common he said it grew goes everywhere in Palestine you can get it anywhere so God made it simple for them get this thing yes take it deep into the blood Mark your door post here and there and here hallelujah you know what that's the cross strike your door post the cross thank God for the cross Hallelujah our God is so good he made it simple now this is what the prophet is speaking and we try to press it out and make it something that no one can take a hold of right it's so simple that you go over the top of it trying to find it out it's so simple as we are sitting down he said it's simple with that f you can't even raise your hand you cannot he said how did you come here you just sat in your car just Dr you are here the same way you know as if you take water to drink it's simple but sometime we have make it we are making it complicated but it's simple that is faith in the finished work of Calvary Faith bases on the word of the Lord God said this I believe it finished childlike Faith just obey just follow it how did Joshua Stop The Sound by faith right Hallelujah and brother BR said Not only did Joshua do do do that now it wasn't just for Joshua it wasn't only for Joshua only it was for any believer that can take God's word yes are we any believers here yes we are so he said for any believer who can take God's word that's all what did God told Joshua as I was with Moses I will be with you amen I will not fail you am no man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life and he told him wherever you will go whether soever th go I'll be there and Joshua believe it do we also believe because Jesus spoke to Mata at the grave when Mata met Jesus when Lazarus passed away and M M Jesus came there MAA went out to meet him and he said oh Lord if you have been here my brother would not have died but now that you are here I know that whatsoever you shall ask the father it will be done Jesus said matter your brother shall live again shall rise oh yes I know in the resurrection she would rise he will rise say I am the resurrection so in the crisis of Lazarus the family crisis the Revelation came out that Jesus is the resurrection they didn't knew that before he had never said that to them before but now he tells them listen I am the resurrection when they said Lazarus was dead and they was sick they s for Jesus he didn't come because the father has not asked him to go so he continue with his work and he go go go go until Lazarus passed away and they said Lazarus is dead he said let us go Lazarus our brother is sleeping our friend is sleeping let's go and wake him oh if he's sleeping he's doing well said no no he's dead he spoke the language that they will understand oh he dead he he said but I am glad I was not there for your sakes listen he is in charge over our lives he knows everything about us nothing will happen to you without he knowing whatever condition we are in today he knows if he allows it it's for a purpose Hallelujah he knows amen amen and nothing can do defeat the purpose of our God he is our God know that he is your god am he's our savior he's Our Redeemer he perchas us with his own blood Hallelujah and brother Bram said some everything brother Bram said yes it's not me that said it he's the one who said it I'm just saying what he said oh I don't you say the Bible say oh the Bible say which part of the Bible you quote without quoting your manou yeah if you say Genesis you say Moses that's Moses you talk of Joshua yeah yeah even Jesus the Lord Of Glory when he came down he quoted a prophet Jesus mentioned the name of Isaiah he said Isaiah said he said Jeremiah's said yeah he said David said so if I said the prophet said what did I say wrong amen hallelujah oh you know this boy is crazy I'm really crazy for Jesus don't be ashamed Paul said to Timothy don't be ashamed of me and my message and my preaching and my word don't be ashamed of me and I'm not ashamed of the prophet of God the MTH piece of God for my generation hallelujah oh made mistake yes said these mistakes are always there he said as a man these mistakes are always there but when it come to the teaching of the word he said this Prophet we of necessity has the power of infallibility to teach the word of God to teach us the word amen he said as Paul was sent to set the church in order so he sent me to set the church in order when Paul thought the people said oh Paul is taking too much upon on and Paul said to them if anybody think himself to be a prophet or spiritual he should acknowledge what I am saying at the Commandment of God Amen Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord thank God for Malachi 4 thank God for a prophet in our generation yes thank God for a man that can stand and stood on the word of the Lord thank God for the Jesus man amen they call him the Jesus man the old husband Tommy husband said this is the man that leave what we preach that man he leave Christ somebody was talking say ah I think brother per was giving a testimony somebody said what I don't like about your Prophet or your your pastor is that people mistake him to be God or to be Jesus Christ ah say that so he said has anybody ever mistaken your pastor to be Jesus Christ said oh no no no I say yes that is the different do you think it's easy for somebody to be mistaken to be Jesus Christ that man live Christ didn't only preach he live it and he was such a humble man and they said about brother Braham they said you don't even can't tell you can't even tell difference between those who love him the way he treat those who love him and those who hate him he treat the same oh God help us if we are believers may God give us Grace woo Hallelujah that the love oh he told us he told us the strongest force the strongest weapon the strongest power is love he said love can defeat the strongest [Music] enemy that's why the Bible tells us Jesus said love your enemies right love those who despise F use you and pray for them so that you become the children of your father in Heaven let me see if I have a little something that I can read it and he said we should love our enemies pray for those who despitefully use us hey those who misuse that pray for them Jesus said we should pray for them don't be against them you know as I've been talking to people you see is rightel today fighting never never since they became a nation has such a thing happened to them to lose in a day over thousand people in their own land has never happened it has never happened but what happened at that time they were fighting among themselves they were almost about to break into Civil War among themselves there was a big misunderstanding confusion among them this one accusing this one this one accusing this one and in their unguided moment Satan came in their enemies took advantage said these people are busy talking against themselves fighting against themselves so the enemy just came in and look at the price they paying today heavy price since they started this war and Lord has died many of the soldiers that is is not common because one person to die for Israel is a big thing and you talk about how many soldiers over 100 soldiers have already died but all because in their unguided moment let me read this that the prophet said I have never talked like this to a group of people but in this locality here and throughout the Nations it is becoming now if the devil can keep us separated he's got us shooting at one another he's got a open Target anywhere he wants to shoot and what is the use of shooting we are shooting one another see so he can just sit back and relax when we are shooting one another he can just sit back and relax he will say just go ahead that your brother is not a good brother that just just go ahead shoot him whatever you know about him tell him the prophet said said let me just give you if I found in your sight if I found Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this Breen if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing how many want to be a blessing how many want to get a blessing I want to get a blessing and I want to be a blessing and the prophet say if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing and get a blessing listen to this when a man has done you wrong when a man has done you wrong and he has absolutely I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil right he said don't mention that he said don't mention that he said what don't mention that he has done you wrong I mean he has done you evil oh God help us somebody call what brother BR he said brother you are Antichrist you are devil he said praise the Lord he said if the will of my father if that is the will of my father for me fine you go to it say fine if God want me to go to he said I will still love him there he said he said I want to do his will so if his will for me is to go to her be he said that's fine oh such a life will make Satan ashamed of himself that is the messenger God sent to us and that is the message we are following because the messenger and the messageer are one don't mention that and they said to him brother how can you be fine with people they call you they speak so much about your family call you all kinds of names and you are still he said Christianity is living for those who hate you those that if they get you they will kill you he said that is the one you live for I'm just quoting the prophet go and check it the one that if he get you will kill you he said that's the one you live for he said Jesus did that for us and we are to be like Christ if the spirit of him that ra go raise up Christ from the dead dwells in us it will Quicken our mortal bodies he will bring it to the same spot as Sons and Daughters of God that's why they call the Christians Christ life like yes in Antioch because they were like Christ are we also like him yes in our behavior in our reactions in our attitude that on the cross he can say father forgive them they don't even know what they are doing amen well I'm sorry if I'm not making you happy but that's okay this should make you happy later later you'll be happy yes right amen that's why we are here we're talking about going to the Rapture the purpose the way to go to the Rapture is what the prophet give to us the life that will be pleasing to our father that's what the prophet give to us please my brothers and my sisters all of us all of us we've come to church enough oh we know the prophet said this the prophet said that we have the quote we have we have the mystery we have the Revelation what life is coming out of that yes amen Amen brother Bram said a life full of excuses is not worthy of this gospel amen you better Shake yourself because listen God will not change his program to fit your program we have to change our program to meet his program has done enough for us brother Bram said oh my goodness everything brother BR yes he the one who said it it's not me he said God cannot take you and pass pass you through a pipeline and pick you here and say that you have overcome overcome what he said God does not take our decisions for us we are left to take decisions when the word of God is preached the pastor come and preach or any come and preach or you read the message or you listen to the Tes you got to take your decision amen I got to take mine amen Lord help us I know the next time tell pastor don't let this brother come here again but I will come Hallelujah you love him we love Jesus I'm just here to encourage one another provoking ourselves to laugh challenging ourselves checking ourselves are we lining up with the word because it is our we have to line up to make it if it is not necessary why did he send the prophet why do we come to church there is a requirement we have to meet don't mention that you take him to prayer before God so whatever is done take it to prayer before God he said and don't take it in a way of just a selfish and say well I am supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our Father where a prayer should be made in the presence of of God and say father here is my brother and is justly he deserves a punishment because he has done me evil and I don't see why he did it then listen to this place then let God go to talking to you not to the fellow who wrong you that's right not to the fellow who wrong you but let God go to talking to you that have been wrong let go go talking to you I know sometime we pray God let the brother see what he has done to me so that he can come and apologize and let my sister realize in apologize say sorry let the brother let the let God go to talking to [Music] you and you will see maybe what that man has been through you may see maybe what that man or that woman has been through to wrong you what that man has been through the devil has Twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that God will speak to your heart and God will make you to know maybe what that fellow that has wrong you has gone through the devil might have Twisted him somewhere and caus him to speak against you and tell lies about you and accuse you the devil might have Twisted him and the prophet said though he is absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man amen though he is absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man the prophet was in Portland Oregon and while he was there this demon possessed man we know the story came in and Cur him and you a snake and the grass and you before people right you are devil you are deceiving the people the prophet said I didn't hate him I love him I said because he said he said this man might have a family wife and children he say it's the devil that has caused him so he said I rebuke the devil he said I didn't hate I love him and I rebuke that Spirit behind there is a spirit behind every action there is a spirit malice bitterness hatred all kinds of spirits so we should not attack the person we should attack the spirit you realize what that man has gone through to do what he has done amen are we together yes the prophet said before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother huh the one that has WR you you'll be sympathizing with him and when you get back down to Earth again that's after prayer you will go over to that brother and shake his hand me to do that you will go over to that brother and shake his hands it takes the spirit of God to do that amen it takes us Dy to ourselves to do that I don't want to talk to this one again I don't want to do this one again because of this small small people even left church I don't want to go to church again I ah this one did this one did that you will be sympathizing and you will

help me because I want to please God Amen that's amen Our Father want us to do this am if you love those who love you alone said the Edens they do the same but the Christianity is to go the extra M to do good if your enemy is hungry giving food to eat if he tested giving water to drink hey that's Christianity this we cannot do on our own except the spirit of Christ comes in except we let him have his way the more I Surrender the more he takes control we surrender to what the word right this is what your word says lord I can't do it but do it for me take control over my life let them call me foolish and stupid Lord let me die to myself the only way we can do this and oby is to die to ourselves and the prophet said your greatest enemy me it's yourself Lord help us I'm sorry if I'm not making you happy but I'm making you to think yeah that's good I don't regret I pray God to help me because when the pastor stand to preach he preach to himself we preach to ourselves because all of us must meet the requirement of God amen amen am and what I'm saying you can make it we can make it because if we cannot make it he will not say it he has already provided he has already given us Grace so we can make it because the world will know that we are the sons of God because only sons of God can do that only children of God can do that and we are his children the same spirit that was in Christ when he said father forgive them did anybody repented before he said father forgive them did anybody apologize to him before he said father forgive them huh did somebody apologize no you said father forgive them they don't even know what they are doing the same Spirit Ste said father forgive them when they Stone him they Stone him they forgive them they don't even know what they the same

about a brother that has made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes he accused wrong when he's not even wrong but if he is wrong well if we would take him to the throne of God stand there shoulder to shoulder with our brother knowing this is another Point knowing he is a mortal and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him I remember a story they said the man went to church and his mobile phone R come go out the man went out he never step in church again he went to drinking bar they give him drink he P sorry
