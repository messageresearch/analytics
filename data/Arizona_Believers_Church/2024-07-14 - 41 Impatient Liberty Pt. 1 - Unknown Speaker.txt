TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title today is impatient Liberty we talked about imperfect Liberty perfect Liberty uh today we're going to look it at from the standpoint of impatient Liberty my choice of that title might have more to do with uh trying to keep that uh connection to imperfect Liberty and then impatient Liberty could have called it uh patient Liberty just to tie into perfect Liberty but I think you'll get uh the gist of this I would call it part one if you're droing that down I think it this would will probably have another part on this uh to to just background and lay some things out so that we're all on the same page perfect Liberty is to live and to do as we ought to do it is to fulfill our duty it's to act right or correctly uh perfect Liberty is not Liberty just to do whatever you want to do but when you're free you can be as you should be and be as you ought to be and we realize that that Liberty in Christ is to uh live as the word would ask us to live or fulfill God's desire in our lives uh to live under what is the expectation of the word in 2 Corinthians 3:1 17 it says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty we've been looking at that phrase and how the idea that where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty to say that well whatever he wants to do we're going to let him do and then at the end of the day all we've really seen is things that we can do things that we can do without inspiration or instigation and so there is sometimes this conflation of uh different human behaviors and activities or certain um manifestations as being what the the scripture means what it says where the spiritual Lord there is Liberty but scripturally we would identify this Liberty as being able to live as we ought to to fulfill the word of God and we see that in James and Corinthians how that this Liberty is connected with fulfilling the word of God now over a couple Services we talked about perfect Liberty and to have imperfect Liberty is to use your Liberty or your freedom to live as you want to so that if you're free you live just however you feel whatever you want to do it's doing what one wants to do in order to please the flesh that's the principles of perfect Liberty and imperfect Liberty as I'm using those terms now impatient Liberty as we use that phrase now impatient Liberty it's to use Liberty as an excuse to act out of order to use Liberty as an excuse to do things untimely if I could put it that way as we were touching on last week on Sunday and Wednesday this lie of Liberty we saw very pronounced in the Scripture it uses the word it uses it is written to entice the believer to cause the believer to act out of Pride to act out of lust or to fulfill the desires of the flesh so the act in itself isn't necessary neily doesn't have to be in itself wrong just in general but it's just what are what's your motive and objective why are you acting and as Satan uh enticed Christ we see these different Dynamics and uh certain ways that he tried to entice him and he say it is written and Jesus said but it's also written and so he didn't want to Jesus was careful to not act out of Pride out of lust or just to satisfy the flesh now if you'll turn your Bibles to Matthew 4: 1 to1 I'm I'm intentionally trying to go maybe at a little bit better Pace because brother Alfonso is trying to translate into Spanish today and I'm hard enough to translate if I'm up here stopping after every sentence let alone doing it in the back where you can't take a breath now I want to go back over today everything I think I'm going to be reading today as so far as scriptures are ones that we've used very recently and used quite a bit but I want to go back some over some of the foundational scriptures for our thought on the Simplicity that is in Christ uh the Labyrinth the maze that this that the devil tries to cause and even that home life that simple life in a home of Honor we've been drawing a lot from these different scriptures I want to go back over them just to set these back set these forth in a way that we're it's in our conscience and try to look at it in a little bit stronger detail then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wild Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward in hunger and when the tempter came to him he said now give some hard uh thoughtful consideration some real hard thought to the concept of Temptation he's led to be tempted of the devil the tempter comes and just look at what this how this temptation is for a lot of us temptation is uh sweet rolls or chocolate cake or something and we find ourselves wrestling with that Indulgence for others it might be music or entertainment or lust there we think of Temptation in a lot of ways but just give some real strong thought to Temptation and what it might be not to what you're tempted by the concept of Temptation find people just going it says and the tempter came to him and he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread but he answered and said now contextually Christ is hungry Jesus is hungry he's fasted uh beyond what would be appropriate uh for human endur endurance and tolerance he's hungry and so when Satan comes and ask him to turn the stones to bread the the supposition is if you are the Son of God then feed Yourself by manifesting a miracle that would meet your immediate need and so in that in that ask it would seem like what would be wrong if I turn stones into bread what would be wrong if I was able to use power or this gift or this ability to feed myself because I need I need nourishment I need I need strength but Jesus gives us such a key to overcoming every day of Our Lives he says it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so he he is telling Satan this he's saying I will stand stand on the word of God Alone that I will not allow my fleshly desires or even my fleshly needs and Necessities to be greater than the will of God in my life that my I have your word is my meat I have esteemed your word more necessary than my daily bread and my daily food so he's saying that it's written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God that's what man lives by that's brother bram's text in the sermon Harvest time that's his anchoring point when he's talking about the different temptations that come and how the Satan works against us and it's in that sermon that he establishes that once Jesus said I won't leave the word he said the devil realized that if you won't reject the word he'll just give you a supernatural offer and it'll it'll be that offer where it says Okay since you're not going to deny the word of God or the word of the hour you're not going to be a word rejector then if I could just get you to act out of the character of the word or start to make the word compete against itself or just in some way cause you to not reject the word but not properly manifest the word he makes him a supernatural offer and here's another Temptation then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and Seth him on a pinnacle of the temple we see those images in the word of God how that now this Supernatural offer is there's going to be some display it's here at the house of the Lord it's it's public and he saith unto him if thou be the Son of God so now it's still the same ask but now it's prove it it prove it without rejecting the word prove it without abandoning the word or going beyond the word if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down jump for it is written because the word of God says that you believe in the the the prophet said or the the this says he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against to Stone the ask is the word said that you would be this would happen if you were in this situation the word says this would happen if you found yourself doing this certain thing so he's saying jump so that God would fulfill his word jump so that if you're the Son of God the angels will catch you they'll be your safety net and Jesus said unto him it is is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God this is the also it is written that he goes back to in this in the face of trying to be encouraged to do something Supernatural encouraged to give a sign or a proof or Vindication that he was the son of God he says Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and sayth to him all these things will I give thee if thou Wilt Fall Down and Worship me now we realize that Christ has promised all these kingdoms already they stand to be his already and Satan is saying this is yours anyways take it now you can have these things you can have it now then saith Jesus unto him get thee hint Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve there was something greater something greater than just getting to the end there was something greater than just uh circumventing H uh hardship and getting the promise that was given to you he says there's something this overarching principle in my life that I live by the word of God I don't tempt God and I only worship God you could just distill uh his answers to just principles of daily living these are my my standard operating procedures this is my this is the the the principles by which every day I govern thought and action and how I would respond in a particular situation how do I face how do I overcome Temptation now brother brandham when he's writing the church age book chapter nine and he's addressing the Le Dey in church age he tells us that in Matthew chapter 4 Jesus was tempted of the devil he says he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word so it's a personal Temptation where Satan is working on him in a very particular way uh Jesus maybe in his uh if thou be the Son of God well if there ever was a Son of God that's the Son of God right there here he is he's the son of God and so he's tempting him in a very personal way he's tempting him about his his instincts or his desires even at the time he's hungry oh well you have need of this why don't you do this a a and there's this maybe this need for affirmation maybe he's trying to find what his complexes might be what his bent is do you are do you tend to be more need this affirmation do you do you need to be uh patted on the back do you want others to know who you are and to recognize you so it's a personal Temptation he says that he overcame by the word and the word only it was the word only by which he overcome and he says each of the three major trials that he experienced that Jesus experienced correspond exactly to the temptation in the Garden of Eden this is what brother bam is making this connection the three uh Temptations and the trials that he endured in the wilderness correspond exactly to the temptation of the woman in the Garden of Eden and then he brings it to the scripture in first John the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life so Jesus in these three Temptations was tempted to by the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life and he said Jesus Jus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word to use the word and the word only there's your contrasting Temptations one in a perfect uh Garden a perfect Eden one in an imperfect Wilderness one overcame by the word the other one fell because they didn't use the word of God now since these Temptations correspond and we're wanting to look at these more carefully now to understand Temptation and this idea of we're free we're Christians we're message Believers the word of God says this the word of God says that and then being impatient in Genesis 3: 1-6 says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman y hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden Satan uses the question if thou be the Son of God so it's kind that's the the question could say if you are the Son of God wouldn't you be able to turn these stones into bread and it's a here again there's this question if did God say you could eat of every tree of the garden this is a Temptation and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die there's some commentators that identify how she said neither shall ye touch it and how that in the the original Commandment that God gave and that prohibition that God gave he doesn't say anything about touching it some surmise that maybe this is her adding to the word of God I certainly think that this that would be something fun to discuss around a campfire but it's uh it and I'm not sure just exactly if that indicates anything but we do know that on its face she's at least saying no I know what I can eat and I know what I shouldn't do and the serpent said un the woman ye shall not surely die so she knows what she can partake in now the very thing that was Pro prohibited she knew that if she engaged in it it would cause death but now he directly contradicts the word and says oh you you won't die and that's the door that opens up to say that to imply that God has lied and not only does he lie about God he lies about his character he says for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil now if you follow in the path of the scripture we've pointed this out before that exactly what Satan said would happen is exactly what happened because once she ate God himself said they become like one of us to know good and evil so there was there was this reality that it happened just exactly like he said and it manifested in the same way that he suggested this is the problem when the woman saw that the tree was good for food so her her perception is changed from what God said about it and the consequence for indulging she saw that it was good and that it was pleasant to the eyes the language that is used here has nothing to do with eating it speaks of a lust and a desire in the flesh to indulge uh um and some excitement in the flesh it says and a tree to be desired to make one wise so it was good for food Pleasant to the eyes but now it's desired to make one wise God doth know that when the the day the day that you eat you'll be changed the day that you eat you will have experienced something that'll make you more Godlike the day that you eat will be the the next Evolution or the next step in what God has for you so she desired that wisdom she longed for that knowledge she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also under her husband with her and he did eat we all on the same page trust that we're each one in um these these these two things put together now we're considering the Temptation in the wilderness the temptation of the woman in the sermons The spoken word is the Original Seed I'm just I'm going to go over these very quickly I didn't provide I don't think I provided these quotes because I just took several places and as you look into this sermon you'll find dozen at least a dozen more instances where brother B is saying this very similar thing speaking of the woman he says Adam's bride could not wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the Earth it was an oncoming thing a promise so it was going to happen if we could say that the woman by experiencing conception and and childbirth that it was going to change her understanding and her perception that she was going to become more Godlike and bringing forth life and regardless of how you think it would happen brother bam said it would have happened by them mixing themselves together the man and the woman and and however we would believe or feel that that would take place it was going to happen and I want you to consider that that it wasn't that for her to bring forth children was wrong that that's not necessarily the error and it's not that we need to necessarily say oh well the fact that it was The Serpent and and that alone we want you I want you to recognize how brother brandham identifies the very first thing that began to happen in her heart and in her mind that led her to the original sin like what's the and if I could say this there are there are things that happen in our lives especially when we see people fall in sin and we ask ourselves how in the world did it ever get there sometimes we think man they must have always been rotten they must have always had that problem and this must have always been the case but a lot of times it's it's it's people who lived well done good but something happens along the way and the devil finds just the right way to work within them you'll find people who very adamant about the truth of the message very against um eighth Messengers and people who make themselves God and people who uh try to do certain things to draw people to themselves and they're very vocal against it and in the passage of time they become the very thing they were against and say oh well maybe they were all just rotten they were all just uh uh it was always there at the core well it the woman didn't start out lusting she didn't start out uh with this uh this longing and this desire to do something wrong she has moved into that place where she considered these things and it happened out I've gone down that whole path to say let's recognize how brother bradam said that Dynamic that was something that happened inside of her that caught cused her to act she couldn't wait something was going to happen but once Satan was able to get her to think that it was more necessary immediately brother Bram says again she got in a hurry what did she do she crossed her seed mingled it with the serpent seed she brought a child of death the child that she perverted every child after that I think maybe we'll pick up on more of that on Wednesday night she got in a hurry I notice he says got in a hurry then she made the mistake so there was some urgency some uh excitement that takes place and she gets in a hurry and then she brings forth death he says it again Adam's bride could not wait she mingled her seed illegally in another place and those of you are familiar with a servant I'm kind of CH just cherry-picking these sentences where he says Adam's bride could not wait he says it again now Adam's bride could not wait but she went forward first first now notice in that he says she went forward first she got out of her place and in going forward first she went ahead of her husband there could have been and I maybe this is just conjecture there could have been this Enlightenment in her mind to be like whoa okay didn't know that never thought about that but ended it there and said I'm going to go to my husband and I'm going to tell him and a and I'm going to I'm going to have this conversation with him but she went he said that she went forward first she went ahead of her husband she left that that relationship she got out of her place and she was brother brand if I could put it in my own words she was impatient she could not wait she got in a hurry he says she could not wait she could not wait she was in a hurry and became impatient please please catch this principle Temptation isn't always being encouraged or enticed to do something wrong when we are tempted we're not always tempted or encouraged or enticed to do something sinful but it can be to do the right thing the wrong way or at the wrong time we can be tempted to do right things we could be tempted to do Godly things we could be tempted to do right ious things we could be tempted to do things that are things that the spirit does or things that we know Christians ought to do and I know maybe I'm head a lot of verbiage to it that makes it harder to accept but we could be tempted to do right things the wrong way and we can be tempted to do things the right things at the wrong time now not I'm not emphasizing this aspect above all other aspects and I'm not wanting to diminish all the other ways in which Satan is working against the woman but in just putting a microscope on this aspect he used he prayed on her in a way to where she got impatient so Satan schemes and we'll look at this let's look at this in terms of Christ his schemes prey on impatience that he's wanting to incite encourage to cause us to act either out of order or out of time so this is the right thing thing to do and we could say that it was the right thing to do for the woman to bring forth uh to bring forth children and so Satan causes her to be impatient and her impatience caused her to bring forth a child of death which was Cain but also Abel was not the promised son that she should have brought forth had she waited brother bam says she would have brought forth Christ and we realize that God allowed it to happen to bring forth what was necess NE for the Plan of Redemption to unfold so there's this looking into and recognizing Satan's Dynamics but we're learning from this what God wants us to learn about how Satan operates and how he works against us he was able to get the woman to act out of time and in acting out of time even the child that she had with her own husband wasn't the proper one in Matthew chapter 4 if we if we looked at it and we were able to take more time with it I I'm just wanted to be very careful about time and just our our uh patience today and endurance Jesus was hungry right J says you're hungry why don't you eat now and we don't need that scripture quite yet he's hungry why don't you eat now you why wait you can do it but he offered this into the record well the word of God is more important than my daily bread said the angels will bear you up so jump he says that this could happen so why don't you why don't you bring it to pass brother Braham touches on it in the question and answers and he says about tempting God to um handle snakes and the person said I'm around snake handlers what about it and brother bham says that's tempting God God just like drinking poison or doing something um to say well the word says this happen so let's make it happen there's there is a there is a scriptural principle things that are word-based it's promises in the word of God a and whether it be casting out Devils or laying hands on the sick or speaking with new tongues anything that we might find in the scripture we could find that unless it's God doing it through us it avails us nothing do we realize if we could distill the the word of God and the message hour of the hour down to 1162 laws that we can govern ourselves by and that we can live by that unless God is doing it through us all of those things mean nothing that you must be born again you must have the late nature of Christ inside of you and so there's things that are right things that are true but notice how if you jump this is what God said he would do he said well do you want Power do you want these kingdoms are these kingdoms promised to you then you can have them right now if you just bow and worship me Jesus Christ was being tempted to tempt God that's why he answers in that Supernatural offer he said thou sh it is written it is written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God he was wanting him to tempt God through Pride lust of the eye lust of the flesh the pride of life through impatience what would have he done if he turned stones to bread he would have fed himself and that's it clearly he could do this cuz then he fed over 5,000 he he would he would have fed only himself if he was to cast himself off the temple he would have only Vindicated himself he could have taken Power by his own act according to his own program in each one of these instances there could be is uh uh what's the final outcome what's the final result and we have to look at it in the eyes of what Temptation was in those three major Temptations in the garden and of Christ and how it connects to the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and how that Jesus would have been feeding only himself he would have only been vindicating himself and he would have taken all the kingdoms and the power promised to him and that was rightly his but he would have done it on his own and he would have done it according to his own plan I tou on this in terms of impatience because Matthew 4:1 it says then the devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him in other words he demonstrated patience he demonstrated it he said well you're hungry why don't you make turn stones to bread so that you can get your nourishment Jesus did not uh he Jesus did not give into the needs did not give in to the ask he didn't clown for the devil but he demonstrates patience because ultimately the Angels come and minister to him and I believe that in the ministering to him it was ministering to the need that he had in his flesh I believe it was ministering to his hungering it was ministering to his Spirit it was something that was nurturing to him in his given situation and his condition know words Jesus didn't need to act out he just needed to wait he was hungry he all he had had to do is wait he was the Son of God the Angels were going to Bear him up but all he had to do is wait he's going to get the kingdoms but all he had to do is endure all he had to do is wait so there's this principle of impatience that's working at the core of these Temptations to be impatient is to feel the wanting of something to happen as soon as possible there may be some here that want this service to end right now and you're being impatient the idea of wanting something as soon as possible and I and sometimes the question is you know can you wait for this and I can't wait for this and that's just to convey the idea of impatience because in reality it'd say well I can't wait for it well yeah you can because you're going to have to right I can't wait for Monday who says that I I I can't wait for Monday and then it's like well if you can't then what happens what happens if you don't wait do you just poof you just disappear you die or does Monday come for the record I can't wait till Monday Monday it's it's to convey this idea of that I want something it's this feeling I want something to happen now I really don't want to wait I want it now but the word means the word then is expressing this this is at the very heart of impatience a Restless desire for change or or excitement the Restless desire for change the Restless desire for excitement at the very core it's restlessness to be restless we could say what's impatience to lack patience when you become when you're patient you may want something but you're not being agitated it's not becoming Restless to where now when you're when someone's impatient or Restless they begin to fidget they begin to want to act they begin to think and move and and they're not resting so at the heart of patience is rest at the heart of impatience is a Restless desire you'll find over and over and over again that Satan's schemes are intended to provoke a Restless longing Satan schemes to Pro provoke some sort of anxious desire where there's this I want that I I'm longing for that I need that I need it right now now if in this Matthew chapter 4 where he says there in Jerusalem at the Pinnacle of the temple cast yourself down because if you're the Son of God the Bible says that his angels will have charge concerning thee and will keep you from dashing your foot against a stone Satan is making a supernatural offering taking that directly from the message of the hour and Jesus said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God so it was that him doing that even the asking in the Temptation Of Christ maybe this is the distinction I really we should have pointed out earlier or this is the moment to do it Satan is tempting Christ and there there's that's the one temptation is being asked by the devil to do something for Jesus to have done it would have been de clown for the devil Jesus using that scripture oh well my he said my foot wouldn't be dashed against a stone that the Angels would intervene and stop this for Jesus to have done that would have been Jesus tempting God so Satan's not tempting God directly but by proxy he's trying to get Jesus to act in a way where God's going to do something not necessarily out of character but out of order so Jesus quotes from Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 16 if we could look at this uh very just in a very focused way so that we can understand what is Jesus referring to what is this temptation referred to Deuteronomy chapter 6:16 you shall not tempt the Lord your God as you tempted him in Massa verse 17 says you shall diligently keep the Commandments of the Lord your God and His testimonies and his statutes which he hath commanded thee so it's not tempting God to do what you ought to do it's not tempting God to do what he has specifically asked you to do but there can be a tempting of God wherein you act in a way that's beyond what he has prescribed it's beyond the character and the timing of what he has asked you to do or what you think you should do we understand there's a principle trying to do God a service without it being his will says you shall not tempt the Lord your God as you tempted him in Massa Massa there means temptation scripture speaks of the days of provocation the Temptation in Hebrews it speaks of it so let's go to this place in scripture where he's saying don't tempt the Lord your God as you tempted him in this place in Exodus chapter 17 says that the people were tempting Moses and complaining to Moses and says why do you want me to tempt God because they were saying why did you bring us out here to die in the wilderness and and it says in verse for Moses cried to the Lord saying what shall I do unto this people they be almost ready to Stone me and the Lord said unto Moses go before the people and take with thee the of the Elders of Israel in thy rod where withth thou smolest the river take in thy hand and go they're hungry they're thirsty they have no water we we need we need water we need water notice just even this symmetry to Christ in the wilderness they're being tempted he needs bread here's the children of Israel in the wilderness they need water and they're begging and Moses saying why do you want me to attempt God why are you asking me to do this I I apologize if maybe more context in those first few verses would be helpful I want to quickly get to where he this idea of Temptation he says behold I will stand before thee upon the rock in Horeb and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of the Elders of Israel now very very interesting the people are thirsty they need water Moses feels uneasy about the way that they're trying to make this happen he goes before the Lord and he says I don't know what to do they're about to sto he says I'll stand on the Rock Smite it water will come forth I'm going to give the people what they ask for this is going to be Supernatural the same Rod that you used to part the water you're going to Smite The Rock it's going to bring forth water but notice how this place is characterized it's not characterized with the language that says oh Bountiful fountain water from the rock it it doesn't have all those uh that doesn't create a word picture of what we believe Christ is to be in the wilderness but rather it says and he called the name of the place Massa and meah because of the CH the chiding of the children of Israel maraba means Strife or contention this chiding mass of Temptation and maraba because of the Ching of the children of Israel and because they tempted the Lord saying is the Lord among us or not is God really with us and it's this statement that becomes the basis for God saying in Deuteronomy 6 you shall not tempt the Lord as you tempted me in Exodus 17 as you tempted me in the wilderness where when you were in a situation your question was basically well is God not among us is he is he really a man of his word when he says is the Lord among us the phrase means is God a liar is God a god of his word God had thoroughly declared his presence with the children of Israel no question about it signs and wonders and miracles had preceded them but now in this moment they demanded more proof as if God had not done enough to vindicate his presence and tell him that the promise was true it was a temptation because God wanted the children of Israel God help me to say this the right way God wanted the children of Israel to look back and see what he had done to bring them to where they were and to recognize where he promised to bring them and say I don't know how he's going to do it but somehow he's going to take this hungry thirsty dehydrating believer and get him into the promised land where it's flowing with milk and honey and I just believe he's going to do that but in that moment moment of crisis in that moment of weakness they demanded that God prove and vindicate who he was instead of taking God at his word and God was gracious to give them what they asked for to manifest his presence yet again to bring forth water from the rock to to show uh his grace to them and his presence with them but yet it was a Temptation and he said don't tempt me like that he's not saying don't ask me for things and and don't don't ask me according to my word he's he's not he's not trying to get us to where it's like we we don't ever want to go before the Lord we said there's something at the heart of the ask where they are requiring more from God in a moment when he wanted them to take him at his word because Jesus overcame by the word and the word only you if you were to just follow in the that path once you've tempted God once it becomes easier to tempt him again especially when he answers and it was that Dynamic that ultimately gets Moses in trouble where in Anger he smites The Rock twice and God was so displeased with that I want I want you to to cons consider the danger of those things so the Temptation in the garden of Eve and the Temptation in the wilderness of Christ they are at the heart about proving about evidence is is the Lord among us or not is God With Us is he a man of his word is is he really real has he made a promise cuz if he if he has then let him do this now so it was about proving it was about evidence even Christ if thou be the Son of God if thou be the Son of God the Temptation is a trial or a test of faith through enticement you recognize that Satan is tempting Christ to prove who he is are you who you really say you are so we can be asked to clown for the devil we can be asked to clown for the world we can be asked to demonstrate and be demonstrative or do things in order to prove to somebody else who we are but then also we could be asking God you prove to me who you are and therein is the crisis the Temptation is about proof and evidence I'm just going to push a little bit further here this morning I'll try to go rather quickly in 2 Corinthians 11:3 he says but I fear CU I want to bring this to the end time remember how that brother bam says you watch there in the Harvest time he says you watch in the end where that Temptation comes watch when you get to the end where this temptation comes maybe he might let some of you speak in tongues and think you got it remember they in the Harvest Time this temptation watch where it comes at the end and he goes he says a lot more but I want just to recall to you those things but I fear less by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ there had been a corruption from Simplicity in the garden there certainly was an attempt to corrupt Christ in the wilderness now in the end we're facing Temptation Paul is touching on it to the Corinthian Church as Eve was beg guiled your mind should not be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ Simplicity remember means free from pretense to live simply in Christ it speaks of that liberality that generosity it is to live and not be self-serving what did the people want God to prove himself but not for himself for themselves they wanted him to feed them they wanted to be cold they wanted to be uh uh watered they they wanted it only for themselves they didn't think about God they didn't think about his will or his program or his promise this is true Liberty to be free from pretense to be free from self-serving or self-seeking maybe a better word to use Simplicity is not self-seeking we read it on Wednesday from The Trumpet gives an uncertain sound brother BR says not something you try to do something you manufacture you can't manufacture you can't manufacture salvation you can't manufacture the gifts he says and the Church of the Living God doesn't inject this to try to make themselves look like something that's that's being corrupted from the simp is in Christ where you try to inject this you try to inject the word to make yourself look like something so then brother brandham says and spoken word is the Original Seed I've provided the paragraph numbers here on these I believe so that you could just see that I'm skipping that's exactly what Adam found that's what Christ found he's talking about the New Testament Church couldn't wait that's what's the matter with the people today they can't wait for the real Holy Spirit to take the church in position what in what positionally places a Believer they've got to manufacture something work up something initial evidence speaking in tongues to get more members in the church all these kinds all these kind of Tommy rot instead of waiting upon the Lord for the real manifestation of the resurrection of Christ making himself known among the people she can't wait says it shortly after that now Adam's bride could not wait but she went forward first we've already read that to you that's the wrong that's the way today the bride today she wants to manufacture something glory to God she's got to work it up on the platform she's got to have everything what is she doing manufacturing something let me say this these things that he's talking about we wouldn't use one scripture against it as being sinful whether it be tongues whether it be uh the moving of SP the spirit remember how that there's things that God does and only he can do it Discerning the thoughts causing a limb to grow raising the dead there's a lot of things uh prophesying accurately according to the word there's a lot of things only God to do Revelation these are things that God does and then there's a response of the flesh to the stimulation of Revelation there's the response of the flesh to a healing there's a response of the flesh to the spirit where we are in our flesh responding to some stimulus and the word of God could take place and we go yes yes or we could be listening to the lottery numbers being read the same thing just like those meetings I were in like I'm describing to you a rock concert because you realize there's just a limited Spectrum in terms of how it's it's large but it's limited in terms of how the human can body can react to stimulus so there's things that in themselves are not sinful they're not wrong we wouldn't want to preach against them we wouldn't want to put a Scarlet Letter on them to where uh these things that brother Bram is saying is to say that if you do these things you're of the devil but notice at the core it's not the product that is that issue as much as how you got to it and it's how you get there that identifies the problem paragraph 81 if that child has been for brought forth right there' have been no death but she couldn't wait talking about the woman that's what's the matter today you want some kind of phony makeup with screaming jumping speaking in tongues or something instead of waiting for the real word of God to be made manifest through the bride who is the bride the kind that takes the word is God's true bride bringing forth children so what is the principal error I'll be closing here shortly I have uh just one lengthy statement to read but I'll just chop it up a little bit what's the what's the principal error now brother brandham is going to Great Links to identify what had gone wrong in the Leo desan Church age and where Pentecost had failed a and the the Dynamics that caused them to go into organization to adopt evidences and to uh to make it Showmanship all these things brother brandham is clearly calling out the Pentecostal organization and the the slipping away and the Sliding Away of the Christian church where in Christ is kicked out the doors and he's been kicked out of his own church so I want you to understand that he's he's saying that very specifically and precisely in the time that he's saying it about very specific things but what's the principle we can draw from it for today because we're not UPC we're not independ independent Pentecostals we're not Pentecostal organization we don't are we shouldn't believe that tongues or any manifestation in the flesh is the evidence of the Holy Ghost I trust that none of us have bought into that uh error or that theology so what is at the core the principal error if we look at what brother bam is saying in the garden and then now in the end time is the and even at the initiation of the church this impatience that leads to a human effort to manufacture proof or to manufacture signs or to manufacture some outward working at the core it's impatience leading to human effort the underlying motivator in this is is is this we want it we want it we can't wait we want it this is what he said we got to have it he said this would happen let's make it happen and really at the core if we look at what Jesus said in Matthew 4 if you look at Deuteronomy 6 and exodus 17 and especially if we look at the woman the very thing that prompts the impatience is some sort of unsettledness with respect to Faith it has something to do with doubt in God's promise if you were anchored in the word only you would say well he said it's going to happen then it's going to happen but if he could create a little bit of Doubt but what if it doesn't so then what do you want to do well let's make sure it does let's make him prove it now I I what if what if it is wrong let's let's put it to the test it's when it becomes what you ought to do and not what he said he would do spok con word is the Original Seed Brothers if you could come to your instruments we'll we'll wrap it up here remember the power of patience and we are taught in the message of the hour that to see God's word fulfilled requires patience to see God's word perfected and manifested by God requires patience that being true and the power what do patience perfect work let patience have a perfect that you would be perfect so if we could take patience out of the equation you'll never be perfect and God's word will never be manifested if he can just cause you to be impatient I don't necessarily have to make you want to reject God's word I don't even have to make you reject God words God's word I just have to make you impatient about his promise and cause some slightly slightly doubting well maybe maybe God isn't with the bride maybe it hasn't been working maybe all these 50 years has proved that there's something wrong with Ministry maybe there's something wrong with the message the are maybe we ought to be working in these Realms maybe we've got away from the things that the church ought to be doing and he wants to cause you to slightly doubt and step out and get ahead of him to force his hand and prove his word or who you are but for God's word to be fulfilled it requires patience meaning this at the core of Temptation is impatience and impatience isn't always to do the wrong thing but it can do be to try to do the right thing the wrong way or in the wrong time good spoken words of the Original Seed paragraph 121 what's she trying to do she manufactures a little jumping on the platform not making fun of it it's all right God forbid that we would ever mock it or make fun of it ridicule it or shame it there can be so much violent rhetoric when it comes to certain things and certain people and certain circumstances and you're you're only you're only asking for it yourself make making fun of it and mocking it he says don't make fun of it it's it's all right but what does he want us to learn not to mock jumping and dancing and shouting don't ever do that don't don't ever uh uh uh speak against it with a nastiness or negativity he says it's all right but what is he trying to teach us as the bride what does he wants to know that there's a there's this motivation she manufactures something else why I to get members in the church what's the matter she just can't wait she can't wait for God to do it they've got to get members in there somewhere so they tell them you have to do that and away they go there's the seed coming right up you have to do it if I could say this a little jumping on the platform not making fun of it it's all right if I could jump higher I probably would do it but he say it's when it becomes you have to do it but there's a way that we begin to say well if it's not this way it's not the right way now there's groups of people that if you are sweating and you're perspiring and you're preaching and you're and you're more charismatic there's you know there's just a a Pentecostal they're this they're that and we make it a have to this is what you have to do somebody who doesn't preach this way or say these things he's wrong because this is what you have to do to the point to where it's been said that if you're church I'm just being very transparent if your church doesn't have this your church is dead and they're talking about shouting dancing passing out screaming speaking in tongues and what's the implication this is what you have to do or you're dead that's air that's the Tommy rot that brother Brandon was calling out we shouldn't make fun of those who shout and dance and maybe it would be good if some of us were those but the problem is is we make fun of those who don't and that's just as wrong that's the seed of discrepancy that's the seed coming right up you have to do [Music] it I was when I was mentioning earlier about just the human response to stimulus concept is is if you do not respond to stimulus begs the question whether or not something's dead right feel no pain in your in your some extremity is there is there dead nerves is something wrong is something been breached is something wrong and so if a person has no emotion brother bam says they're dead bury it in other words if there's no activity if there's no response to stimulus maybe your brain dead maybe you're dead it was it to say that we had to have a certain manifestation of emotions to prove we're living that's just that's just human basic human biology that he's referring to on one level he says when you have to do it and then he goes to this he says I'm a I've been a missionary I've been to Africa and he said I've seen him get all painted up and hang hooks into them a a and pour things over themselves and blood and Stripes themselves and all this thing and he says and shout and dance in the spirit and speak in tongues and worship devils and he goes evidence of the Holy Ghost I've seen natives who reject God act in the same manner that you think blood Point coming out of your hands doing all these things and you say that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost he says I've been right there in India where they walk on fire they sew their lips up a and they run a saber through their lips and they do all sorts of things with Fish Hooks and stuff he said they go over there and dance around an idol and kill a goat and worship like this and walk through hot fire with without a Scorch he says some of you Pentecostals try it think about those things these Feats of endurance and these testings and and being preserved for these painful things and walking on coals and not being burnt and then brother BR says this but it was done the Hebrew children they stepped into the fire one day they didn't just walk on coals they walked into a furnace that was heated seven times harder than it had ever been heated before he said but they never tempted the Lord their God they were just thrown into it right they didn't try to manufacture something that's what's the matter with Pentecostals today they're manufacturing something they can't wait oh God they just can't wait so they commit adultery tears to manufacture something and what does it bring forth what's the mixing what's the hybriding it's to take divine nature and mix it with human nature outside of God's timing outside of God's will or the wrong way because the flesh is becoming word and word is becoming flesh we are partakers of his divine nature but that doesn't mean that everything that we put our hand forward to do when we think it's the will of God is the right thing it can produce tears he says like it did the first time the first bride couldn't wait she brought death through a bastard born child which we all are children of but God Came In the Flesh to give us another birth I hope to come to this more on Wednesday to bring us back to original Sons and Daughters of God there you are the life sperm of Eve never happened in never did why she mingled it kept it away instead of Adam coming for her bride coming to her for a bride when the time appointed would be just like Christ would have come to the group Christ would have come to his church he promised to do it God promised to multiply them but they had to wait until God's time that's what's the matter today they don't wait want to wait God's time if it's God's time then let him do it but let us not allow our flesh or the devil to place upon us a burden or a bondage or a Temptation that we need to make it happen to prove that we're his bride brother Brandon was very clear what our Revival is he very clear about what would matter the most and I believe that in this Exodus we can make the same mistake of meah and Massa by tempting God when he's already fir thly Vindicated his presence to us therefore I believe that we ought to do what he asked us to do and do what we ought to do and leave the rest to him let's pray today if we could just bow our heads and just stand with me
